<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Just give mommy a few hours, and I will-&quot; Frost&#39;s assurances to Squall were interrupted by a pulse going through her. She stumbled for a second, confused. Trying to forget the strange feeling, she cleared her throat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like I was saying, I&#39;m sure I will find an-&quot; another, stronger pulse, emanating from deep within her core struck her down, forcing Frost to collapse, barely catching herself before she crushed her daughter, the mere thought almost stopping her heart. Squall, for her part, didn&#39;t seem to notice, curled up and mewling on the ground like a distressed cat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mommy... help...&quot; she pleaded. <br />
<br />
That was too much for Frost.<br />
<br />
She roared as her motherly instincts exploded, striking at her inadequacy. Here she was, the pinnacle of dragonkind, and yet she couldn&#39;t lessen her daughter&#39;s suffering. She tried to reason with herself. She could find a mate in no time. There was no rush. But her own body was having none of it. If she couldn&#39;t resolve the situation, then she would simply have to be better.<br />
<br />
Frost&#39;s heart beat a thousand times faster than normal as untold amounts of energy were released from her core suffusing her body.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-Impossible!&quot; She grunted. &quot;I am a Primordial Dragon! I am the top, what else could I- UNNNGH!&quot;<br />
<br />
But motherhood was denying her claims. It was true, Primordial Dragons had been the peak of their evolution... in the old world. But she had broken through the limits by producing a child, and now she would have to change accordingly to fill in this new role. Not as a Primordial.<br />
<br />
But as a Progenitor.<br />
<br />
Frost blew up in size, her previous growth spurt nothing in comparison as she burst through her mountain, her head reaching for the clouds and then passing them, and still growing and growing, her body swelling with new muscle, new size, new power, her icicle spines multiplying as they gained the ability to be launched from her back as continent-destroying missiles. Her sides bulged as new appendages burst forth, her diamond scales clattering to the ground as house-sized boulders as they were upgraded, now actively repelling harm instead of merely blocking it. A third pair of wings graced her back as the old ones grew, effectively being able to wrap the evolving goddess in a cocoon of membrane.<br />
<br />
She grew, and grew, and grew, her head breaching the edge of space just as she lost the need to breathe, or eat, or drink, or sleep. Her body functions were now completely autonomous, unstoppable. With a devastating roar of actual, genuine pain, new appendages were birthed from her torso, Frost&#39;s country-sized head soon joined by two others as new necks stretched out to add to her majesty, the features of a hydra assimilated into the supreme being. Two new brains contributed to her monumental intellect, and should anything within the universe actually manage to cut off one head, two more would simply grow in its place. As counterbalance, two more tails also grew in, becoming completely prehensile and developing an icy stringer at their ends like a scorpion, as if she had a need for more weapons.<br />
<br />
But beneath her tails the real reason for the change was brewing. Her womanhood was deemed inadequate by existence, and it was desperately trying to make amends.<br />
<br />
Ocean-filling amounts of hypercooled liquids were drooling out as Frost&#39;s dragon pussy grew, desperately trying to keep up with its mistress despite knowing that with every meter of growth it was abandoning the possibility of ever being mated with again. But that stopped mattering as a new reaction was happening deeper within, her womb bulging as it prepared for a metamorphosis.<br />
<br />
Frost screamed as the organ stretched, pulled, burned, seemingly tore itself apart, until finally...<br />
<br />
POPPOPPOPPOPPOPPOPPOPPOPPOPPOPPOPPOPPOPPOPPOPPOPPOPPOPPOPPOP!<br />
<br />
Eighteen new ovaries grew in, completely surrounding her womb as a halo of maternity. Squall&#39;s previously impressive setup paled in comparison as these new ovaries fired up, getting to work immediately as they swiftly and violently began to self-fertilize, ova after ova flowing into the cavern-sized womb that was larger than her previous lair, thousands upon thousands of cells attaching to the walls and beginning development into new dragons. Frost had abandoned egg-laying entirely in favor of just birthing fully developed dragons immediately. Something within her soothed as she knew that within hours Squall would have a mate, as well as several hundred siblings.<br />
<br />
But there was no stopping the change as her chest and stomach rumbled bursting forth as ten pairs of milky breasts that blew out a veritable shotgun blast of unevolved diamond scales, laying waste to an unfortunate kingdom. Unendingly nutritious milk flowed freely from the heaving, scaly nipples, filling in rivers and lakes around her. Any creature that tasted a mouthful would never cease its development, the nutrients within Frost&#39;s milk providing them for the rest of their lifespan. Good for ice dragons... bad for anything not possessing the extreme cold resistance of Frost&#39;s progeny.<br />
<br />
Speaking of cold, it was time for the world to change.<br />
<br />
Within Frost&#39;s core, her power source, the origin of her abilities, work was ending. For the duration of her transformation, the core had been feeding endless amounts of power to fuel the developing goddess, but now it was preparing for its final stunt.<br />
With a last burst of power, the core overcharged and went beyond reality itself.<br />
<br />
An imaginary thermometer that had always hovered around Frost, displaying the temperature around her, trembled and struggled as something new was happening, until at last it gave up and plunged, moving below absolute zero.<br />
<br />
Seeing as absolute zero is the complete stillness of matter, there seemed to be no way anything could be colder. But as a Progenitor, Frost found a way. So, with world-shaking effort, the matter around Frost began to reverse, becoming so cold that it wasn&#39;t just not moving, it was actively going back. Time and space shuddered as this impossible phenomenon took place and time began to reverse around Frost.<br />
<br />
Sensing what was happening, Frost&#39;s triple brain sensed that she had to take the initiative. So, she followed her first instinct: to nest.<br />
With no mountain left capable of holding her, she dove into the last remaining option, the planet itself.<br />
Millions of tons of rock were excavated in an instant as Frost&#39;s claws dug in, her new arms expediting the process as she dove into the earth live water. It barely took a minute for her to reach the blazing core of the planet, the supreme temperatures immediately yielding to the superior power.<br />
<br />
&quot;A new age... is beginning.&quot; Frost managed to grunt through the effort of containing her world-shaping power.<br />
<br />
With a gulp, she ate the core of the planet, immediately nullifying it as she took its place.<br />
<br />
Now subject to its new core, the planet began rapidly cooling, an ice age arriving within minutes. Billions upon billions of living beings froze to death and were subsequently erased as Frost&#39;s time-reversing coldness began to remake the planet. Within the planetary clock, seconds began to tick back, then minutes, then hours, days, weeks, months, decades, centuries until finally time lost its meaning as civilizations disappeared and millions of years were flowing past, the planet rotating inversely as tectonic plates shifted to their previous configurations, bursts of cold erupting from volcanoes in place of magma to reshape the surface as frozen land masses crackled in their reversion to the state they were born in, until finally...<br />
<br />
A newborn planet floated in space. Shiny, sparkling, completely covered in ice. Devoid of life, except for a rapidly growing population of dragons.<br />
<br />
Time stood still.<br />
<br />
Then, the dragoness within its core, encased within the planet like a child in its egg, breathed out and lowered the temperature imperceptibly.<br />
<br />
Time resumed, and the planet began rotating. Over the following millenia Frost&#39;s descendants would take over as the last remaining living beings, adapted to the extreme temperatures of their newborn planet. Tales of Frost, the Progenitor, would be passed down through Elder Broodqueen Squall, the matriarch of an entire species, containing vast knowledge of future unhappened within her immortal mind. Vast oceans were filled with milk flowing from deep beneath the earth, new dragons perpetually crawling out from the gigantic hole in the earth known as Frost&#39;s Maw. The Ice Dragons watched as new life developed on the surface, impossible life forms crawling out from within the frozen crevasses to being populating the planet once more. But never would anything emerge to threaten their reign. The era of dragons was immortal. Infinite. Unending. Absolute.<br />
<br />
And somewhere within this new world, a small pond of unexplained, flowing water emerged, shimmering with potential...</p>
