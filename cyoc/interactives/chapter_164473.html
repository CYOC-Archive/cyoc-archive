<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Deion woke up the next morning to a feeling of his head aching, his body still every bit as muscled as it was when he fell unconscious that last night, and then slowly sat up, stumbling to his feet as he did. &quot;Oh...man, feels like my head just got a beatdown from Mayweather...&quot; He started to realize then that his voice indeed sounded...different somehow from how he knew it. He rubbed his forehead and almost fell backward when he saw that blond hair fell down in front of his eyes.<br />
<br />
A scream echoed through the house, followed by the sound of someone almost flying up the stairs.<br />
<br />
Deion couldn&#39;t believe it, he wouldn&#39;t believe it, at least until he saw it for himself in the mirror. He threw the door open to the bathroom and stood there in front of the mirror, looking at the form of Alec Tourville. He didn&#39;t even know how to react to this, he didn&#39;t know whether to laugh, scream, or hit something. After so long and having resigned...no, not resigned, accepted and embraced his path forward as Deion Dalton, he had now been turned back into Alec.<br />
<br />
All of a sudden, it was like his life had been turned on its head all over again. He&#39;d gotten used to, even appreciated, all that happened when he had become black. He had learned a lot, found out how bad it was for him to be as he was before FROM the other side of the street. Deion had rejected living like that, decided he was gonna put his best foot forward. Move on with his life away from Spencer and his goon squad. But now?<br />
<br />
Now he was back. And as much as Deion knew he should be happy, feel amazing to be Alec again, that he&#39;d finally reclaimed his identity, he just...didn&#39;t. This just didn&#39;t feel right.<br />
<br />
Deion stumbled out of the bathroom and entered into his bedroom, wondering what he could even do right now. He knew he would need to go ahead and set up his return to school and find some way to deal with Deion&#39;s &quot;disappearance&quot;. But just thinking of that made him feel so much like the world was jerking him around. First he turned black over the course of what, a few days, and then just when it seemed like things were on the up and up, he&#39;d lost even that sight of a life he&#39;d accepted.<br />
<br />
He looked at the mirror beside his bed and sadly smiled, &quot;Well, Alec, the world&#39;s your oyster again. Your messy, Spencer-stained oyster.&quot;<br />
<br />
He started to wonder now, having gone through this transformation once one direction and then the other if there was any hint of a method to do this. Deion didn&#39;t know what he wanted right now, whether that was to return to...to just living day by day as he had before, or... No, he couldn&#39;t well just live like this. He had to...to find a way to get back to how he was.<br />
<br />
It felt so ridiculous and spoiled. That he finally got what he wanted having ordered all these damned books, and then when one of them worked, he just wanted to go back to how things had been as Deion instead. &quot;Stupid...I&#39;m just a stupid fuck living outta his parents&#39; mansion. Well, better try the way I know...&quot; He remembered what seemed to bring on the changes before and decided to test it out here.<br />
<br />
He brought up his laptop and brought on his favorite pornography. A lazy smirk showed on his face as he watched Lilah Landon taking two cocks, one in her mouth the other in her pussy, and he felt his manhood stirring. It was...not the manhood he was used to after living as Deion Dalton, but it&#39;d work. He wrapped a hand around it and felt the sensitivity burn through him.<br />
<br />
He started to push his hand up and down on his manhood, laying back and letting the porn play as he listened to it. Deion lightly bit his lip and tweaked a nipple, feeling a spike of pleasure as a result. He grinded his hips into the bed and felt his leg kick a bit as he thrust into his eager hand. Deion was hoping that this would have some sort of effect on him...<br />
<br />
He kept going and found himself absorbed into the sounds of the porn as his hand started going faster and faster over his increasingly hot, throbbing manhood. Deion groaned and gripped the bedsheets, &quot;F-Fuck...!&quot;<br />
<br />
Deion tried to keep himself from cumming too soon, he wanted this to take, to possibly even bring him back to the specimen of masculinity he had been earlier. To regain who he&#39;d decided he&#39;d accepted he was. But even as he kept masturbating, feeling his body heat up and stain the sheets with his sweat, he couldn&#39;t feel any of the pleasant changes he knew from memory. His muscles were straining, flexing as his forearm ached from the pistoning action...<br />
<br />
Deion felt his body strain, his sphincter clench, and then he was cumming, even when he tried to reach for his usual rag to try and take it. His emission lasted for a good fifteen to thirty seconds with a few additional spurts as he started to rest back into his bed. The pleasant feeling of orgasmic completion was taken momentarily for the feeling of his body changing, so Deion leaped back up and looked at the mirror...only to see Alec. No changes, no differences, no closer to it.<br />
<br />
Emptily, he got up and pulled the sheets off his bed and brought them out into the washroom to clean up. Even as the nude Deion put the sheets in the washer, he just hoped that the changes were being delayed or some such. A return trip to the bedroom dashed these hopes. No such luck. He just saw Alec again.<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean,&quot; He said to himself as he started getting dressed in some of his old clothes, which seemed to fit a bit better, but not excellently on his outstandingly muscled physique, &quot;I should be happy. I know I should. But...I&#39;m not. I just don&#39;t know any more. What do I want? I spent all that money, but I won that football game. And...&quot;<br />
<br />
His outloud musings were interrupted by a phone call, and Deion froze as he wondered who it might be. How could he disguise his voice? What if it was Savannah? He answered his phone after a moment&#39;s hesitation and was very surprised by the voice on the other end that spoke up, &quot;Hey, Deion, man I really think we need to talk. It&#39;s really kind of urgent.&quot;<br />
<br />
Deion managed to achieve a modicum of his former voice, &quot;...Dave?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, something...something HAPPENED to me man, and I think you were probably right.&quot; The man on the other end said, followed by a pause and then returned with an angrier tone, &quot;Deion, I know you&#39;re involved in this SOMEHOW, and I&#39;m not gonna be doing this. I&#39;m NOT who I see in the mirror. I&#39;m not a-a half African American! You are gonna tell me what&#39;s going on and how you did this to me, or I&#39;ll make it more peoples&#39; problem.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;D-Dave! You don&#39;t know what you&#39;re saying!&quot; Deion responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, don&#39;t I?&quot; Dave answered, sounding increasingly desperate and emotionally unwell, &quot;Somehow this is contagious, and you did this to me. So until you return me to fucking normal, I&#39;ll spread it around. Till you have more people to reckon with. Fuck you and so long Deion Dalton.&quot; And with that, Dave ended the call.<br />
<br />
Deion slumped backward against a wall of Alec&#39;s house. &quot;This is just...just great. I&#39;m back to being Alec, Dave&#39;s gonna affect other people due to some weird, twisted revenge scheme, and...and I need to turn back into Deion Dalton somehow. This is just...great.&quot;</p>
