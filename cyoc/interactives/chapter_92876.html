<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As he sniffed his cellmate in the dark, Dan wondered why a dog would be called Stewart. He even wondered why anyone would be called Stewart. He remembered Stewart at school who is a year behind him. He was very good looking and athletic. All the girls were after him, even his sister, Kat. She had invited Stewart over several times where he and Dan had become quite good friends, sometimes pushing and wrestling, rolling around with each other. Kat was three years older but had taken Stewart on two dates, obviously intent on seducing him as she had done with several of the best looking guys in her class as well as Dan&#39;s. But she had come home early on the second and in a very foul mood not wanting to talk about it. Dan hadn&#39;t seen much of Stewart since though he called a few times to join him going somewhere, but Dan was always busy.<br />
<br />
 Dan continued his sniffing. Stewart smelled different. Of course, Dan didn&#39;t have that much experience smelling dogs, but Stewart didn&#39;t have that earthy, sweat, and poop scent that the other dogs did. He smelled -sniff- clean -sniff- like he just had a bath -sniff- with body wash -sniff- fragrance of -sniff- a field of -sniff- hay and -sniff sniff- fresh cut wood.<br />
<br />
 The scent of the bitch was drifting in the evening air again, and it mixed with Stewart&#39;s scent. It filled Dan&#39;s nostrils and flooded his mind setting off his male dog hormones. Without thinking, Dan&#39;s nasal investigation had taken him down Stewart&#39;s side and around to his rear hole. He had even dipped underneath in front of Stewart&#39;s rear legs and was now using his tongue to taste Stewart between his rear legs. To Doggy Dan it was pleasant and almost intoxicating.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Hmmm? Friendly.&quot; Dan enjoyed the feeling he got of not being alone and having a companion. He pondered the flavor before he caught himself. &quot;WHAT THE #@$% AM I DOING?&quot; He backed away and tried to spit, but a slobber is the best he could do. &quot;How much of a dog am I becoming that I just act automatically?&quot;<br />
<br />
 Stewart had similarly moved around Dan, nose and tongue caressing many parts of Dan&#39;s doggy self. When Dan backed off, Stewart thought it a game and began a bit of pseudo-nipping and pushing trying to get Dan to play fight. Dan felt depressed but his torment only grew as he noticed his arousal from a combination of bitch and Stewart. Soon, though, reacting part by his continuing disgust and part wanting to have fun, Dan let his happiness wash away his disgust as they ran and rolled around together with friendly growls as if fighting.<br />
<br />
 Dan finally ran apart and caught the strong bitch scent again. He wandered up wind following the aroma of sexual invitation. His body became warm as blood rushed to his dogginess as it grew out of his sheath.<br />
<br />
 While Dan was lost in his growing desire, Stewart was following him, taking in Dan&#39;s scent and an occasional nip or lick. Dan was oblivious to Stewart as he roamed the enclosure in a haze of lust. The smell of heat also wafted into Stewart&#39;s snout, energizing the same reactions as Dan. However, Stewart did not pursue the source, instead just following Dan as they both grew hot.<br />
<br />
 Dan pressed himself into the corner of the enclosure where the bouquet was most intense. His ears were raised listening - for what he didn&#39;t know, but it seemed right. His tail began to slowly swish, and he raised it tall over his back. He wanted to squeeze through somehow but knew he couldn&#39;t. The frustration of this made him put his front paws up on the fence deliriously thinking maybe he could climb out. He tried to control himself, but found his human logic overwhelmed by dog instincts. In his scared boy mind he knew that he needed something to bring him back from this doggy state, and that&#39;s exactly what happened.<br />
<br />
 Just then Stewart climbed his back from behind and starting to hump him. Shocked, Dan tried to move but was trapped between the much bigger Stewart and the fence. He twisted and growled, but Stewart was persistent. More than persistent, Stewart crushed Dan into the fence. The wire pressing hard to his snout and face. Stewart returned Dan&#39;s warning growl with a ferocious, guttural deep growl that Dan knew meant he would not get away. Dan now realized that his recent actions were a sign to his cellmate that he was his bitch and Stewart wouldn&#39;t let him go.<br />
<br />
 Letting out a mournful howl, Dan&#39;s mental and physical state was now in excruciating pain. The sound drew forth the attention of something in the dark. From the corner of his eye, he saw a spot of light sending a beam swinging around the area until it fell on his and Stewart&#39;s activity.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Well, well.&quot; a familiar voice came out of the dark from behind the spotlight. &quot;I see you two have become very close friends. Pardon my intrusion while a I watch.&quot; and there was a devilish chuckle followed by several flashes of light. &quot;Just some mementos.&quot;<br />
<br />
 Dan whimpered and remained immobilized by Stewart for what felt an eternity. He knew that somehow Kat had orchestrated all of this, and it all suddenly came clear to him. Kat had found out Stewart didn&#39;t want to be with her, but with him. She had probably turned Stewart into a dog as well and sent him here. She knew where Dan was all the time and was controlling his continued transformation and humiliation.<br />
<br />
 The light then disappeared, as if acknowledging Dan&#39;s revelation, and footsteps faded into the distance. Eventually, Stewart fell off and went across the yard and lay down. Dan just cowered in the corner shivering from what had happened and feeling completely abandoned and helpless to do anything.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Am I really to be a dog forever?&quot; Dan worried ready to cry if he could. &quot;How and why would Mom let this happen? Will Kat really be my master, forever and ever tormenting me? Please Mom, don&#39;t leave me like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
 Dan was exhausted in mind and body. The only thing he could do was sleep and hope he would wake up from this terrible dream and find someone there to rescue him.</p>
