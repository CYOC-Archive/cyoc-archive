<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Robert lied nude in the warm waters of the pool, if this had been normal it would have been almost calming but it was far from normal as he waited for the drug which had just been injected to go into effect and turn him from a 6’2 former solider turned firefighter into a mermaid of some kind. He cursed the monster virus and then after a few minutes about when he wondered if anything would happen he felt his chest and back tickle a bit. He looked down at his chest fearing he would see budding breast, however nothing happened.<br />
<br />
“Maybe I am just imagining it?” thought Robert as suddenly with a snap and a little bit of pain, his shoulders shot together shrinking in size as his whole frame began to shrink and change. He lost a lot of height very fast and mass as well.<br />
<br />
From the outside his wife Sally watched as her husband’s broad shoulders shrank as his hairy arms, chest, back and even his short well-trimmed beard fell away. The water pulled it away toward the filtering system. Then before her eyes, her husband’s strong jaw began to smooth out and his dirty blonde hair turned darker and darker until it was black. She had meet everyone in his family and none of his family had black hair, the closest was a brown and now he had an almost pitch-black hair. <br />
<br />
On Robert’s end, he felt and saw his hair fall away and felt it as his entire body shrank, he could hear bones popping as his bones shifted a bit. Then he felt something brush the back on his neck which was still above water. He raised his hand out of the water, to see that it was now a lot thinner, slander and graceful with perfect fingernails. He looked at for a moment and before his eyes a thin membrane grew out of his hand filling the spaces almost to the last joint turning his hands into webbed hands. The membrane was thin enough to see through but it was shifting colors…now that was his entire skin tone. He felt something on his back of his neck again as he reached back and found his short hair had become much longer and it was now brushing the back of his neck. <br />
<br />
Sally watched as Robert’s skin tone shift, it took her a moment but it soon became clear that her husband, who was almost 100% German decent besides for a little Swedish was clearly becoming an Asian woman, Japanese she would guess but she wasn’t sure. His strong jaw was now gone, replaced by smooth delegate jaw with large dark eyes instead of his natural blue. <br />
<br />
“A race change, rare but not uncommon.” Said the doctor<br />
<br />
His wife couldn’t see this because it was below the water line but he did feel his manhood began to be pulled into his body. He wanted to grab it and he attempted to but felt another pair of hands move to stop him. He looked down to see the mermaid Nurse holding his arms back, she was shaking her head no even with a slight pop he felt his manhood disappear into his body leaving a slit behind. He was now a she, then he looked down a saw his new womanhood. Then he couldn’t as his chest began to expand outward into a pair of breasts. His heart rate was through the roof as he tried to get some air but it was hard and each breath was coming faster.<br />
<br />
Sally watched as her husband became a woman and a pair of breasts grew in, she would have to guess B cups maybe a small C cup, it wasn’t that big of breasts not a bimbo a version of a mermaid some put into pop culture but giving Robert’s new frame they where large enough. The only thing which really told her that this nude woman in the pool was her husband Robert was his military tattoo which somehow had shrunk with his now slender arm keeping the same perfectly. Then she saw the panic look on her husband’s face as he struggled to breath.<br />
<br />
“You need to go underwater.” Said the doctor as Robert struggled to stay up, something was pulling him or her down. Then she remembered the mermaid nurse which was in the pool with him. <br />
<br />
Robert tried to stay above water, but he couldn’t breath, he was beginning to pass out he knew and he felt something or someone pulling him down. Finally he slipped below the water and for a moment attempted to hold his breath but in the end he did take a breath only to have water rush into his mouth over his gills which pulled the oxygen out before expelling the water through slits along his neck which had some scales around them.<br />
<br />
“Good, you finally came down.” Said the mermaid nurse as Robert began to get some oxygen into his body. “Your first breath of the sea…now just relax your already over halfway there.”<br />
<br />
“What?” said Robert his voice sounding totally different, it was a woman’s voice for sure and he reached out to his throat and saw that the thin membrane skin between his hands had shifted, it was taking on a soft purple color. He looked down and for a moment he was transfixed by the fact that he now had a pretty good set of boobs on him, he finally looked past them to see his skin from the waist down was shifting colors as a scales began to grow over his flesh. <br />
<br />
“Just relax…” reassured the nurse as she swam around and with skill and grace slipped a simple white bikini top over his new breasts. He was so transfixed by the tail coming in he didn’t notice it at first. His legs grew out even as they began to press together into a single limb, his feet extended to form a fluke as his toes grew out and membrane grew between them to make a large powerful tale fine. It took on the color of deep purple with a lighter purple membrane in the hands and at the end of the tail. The scales moved up to his or rather her waist before thinning out merging with her skin around her bellybutton. Some scales also graced the area around her gills but not a lot. <br />
<br />
“There…I think you are done.” announced the nurse to the new mermaid.</p>
