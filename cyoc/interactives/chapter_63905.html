<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>Reading on, Cally found the entry on:
<br />
<blockquote>Gender Ring<br />
As its name suggests the Gender Ring allows its wearer complete control over their own gender, as well as that 
of those around them. Now one may ask what is so special about an object that controls only gender in a 
collection of much more versatile artifacts. The answer lies in the unique way in which this control is 
exercised. Once the ring is put on, the users body enters a state of flux. During this period, the wearer 
possess the sexual organs of both male and female. In all other ways, the wearer will remain unchanged until 
the first time the wearer is sexually stimulated. At that point, the users appearance will change according to 
the nature of the stimulation. That is, the user will become progressively more male or female depending on 
which set of organs is involved. Removing the ring will not restore the users original appearance, but does 
allow for multiple simultaneous users. The period of flux ends after 24 hours at which time the user will be 
rendered completely male or female depending on which gender the user most resembles at the time. The ring can 
be used as many times as desired.</blockquote>
<br />
<p>Hmm, now this just sounded bizarre, even more so than anything she'd come across so far. Cally was tempted 
to stay away from this particular artifact but... she still hadn't come across anything that struck her as 
particularly dangerous, and this ring was no exception. At most, this artifact seemed to provide the potential 
for some awkwardness. Still, she hesitated for a second before putting the ring on. 
<br />
<p>As soon as the ring was firmly on her finger, it began sending jolts of electricity up her arm. These 
surges coursed through her body before they started to coalesce at her groin, intensifying as they grouped 
together. Cally began to gasp at pleaurable feelings coming from her crotch, her arousal building higher and 
higher. But to her immense disappointment, just as she was just about to peak, the urges stopped, leaving her 
teetering just on the brink. Oddly enough however, her arousal seemed centered in two places at once. Looking 
down, she saw no obvious changes. Exploring with her hands, she found that, just like the manual had said, she 
now had a fully functional vagina located just behind her ball sac. 
<br />
<p>As her fingers searched she accidentally brushed her clit, sending a wave of pleasure up her spine. The 
feeling was so intense, and strange in that it almost felt unfamiliar. As if this was the first time she had 
felt it. Still aroused from her transformation and unable to resist, she brushed it again sending another wave 
flowing through her body. And another, and another, and another until she was slipping her fingers in an out 
of her pussy and working her clit furiously. As she neared orgasm, she was too distracted to notice that her 
hand were slimmer and daintier, or that her feet had shrunk. 
<br />
<p>She came hard, a spasm wracking her body as her hips flared out with a sudden crack. The orgasm brought no 
relief from the need she felt, so her hands kept working, her arousal slowly building again. As it did, her 
arms and legs began slimming, muscles fading away as her features began to soften. Her limbs became thin and 
dainty, all hair disappearing leaving them soft and smooth. Her waist pulled in slightly as her abs faded and 
flattened. Her moans of pleasure began rising in pitch as her face began shifting again. 
<br />
<p>Her hands finally brought her to another orgasm, and her hair exploded from her scalp, cascading down her 
back. Still her arousal refused to subside, though all the while she was looking more and more feminine. A 
third orgasm brought no relief, but with a series of snaps and cracks she felt her bones shorten as she 
dropped another few inches in height. Finally she neared her fourth climax. This time she found herself 
building up further than for any of the previous ones. Sensing an end, she redoubled her efforts, climbing 
higher and higher until she came, screaming in an explosion of ecstasy. With a crunch her shoulders were 
pushed in, as if by some unseen force, while at the same time her chest seemed to explode with delight as two 
small breasts burst from her chest.
<br />
<p>Finally, it was over. Worn out from her exertions, Cally looked wearily into the mirror. She looked like 
any normal 14 year old girl, minus the 9 inch penis still dangling from her crotch. But Cally was surprised to 
notice that the girl staring out from the mirror looked unfamiliar. Thinking for a second, she realized that 
she had still been in the body of her fantasy lover when she had put on the ring. Thus, the girl she was now 
was what he would have looked like at 14 instead who she had actually been 5 years ago. And of course she 
still had a penis, for the next 24 hours. 
<br />
<p>Hoping to maybe find some way of correcting that, she flipped to the page on...</p>
