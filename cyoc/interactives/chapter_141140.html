<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Thanks to FMAlkemist for tips, especially the game names.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Do ya know who youse talkin’ to?<br />
The Queen of rappin’, Hela G, not Mary Sue!<br />
So OUTTA HERE! Ya lesbian hag!<br />
If ya don’t, I’ma kick ya-ya fuckin’ FAG!”<br />
<br />
SLAM!<br />
<br />
Cassie was astonished by the incredibly rude speech from the rapper girl behind the dorm, which was supposed to be her girlfriend’s address. Flabbergasted by the pure homophobia by that...Hela G?<br />
<br />
She was visiting her girlfriend’s school, while Rayne always adored about how she was alone at her own place, she always preferred to be around her gorgeous flower Cassie and hated the fact that they lived so far away from one another.<br />
<br />
Wanting to surprise her GF with her impending transfer and how they even slotted them together! It was the only empty dorm left! She wanted to bring the good news personally to Rayne Koh.<br />
<br />
But for some reason...<br />
<br />
Her...or at least what used be her dorm however...was completely different than what it looked like over a week ago. Door tattooed with skulls, bling and all the kind of shit she did not like, specially with her annoying cousin Raiden and his ‘straightuber’ douchebag of a roomate. <br />
<br />
When the door flung open, it was even worse as it displayed numerous unsightly things that Rayne would never have approved of. She had thought she was playing on her phone too much that she knocked on the wrong dorm, but it was not...and once again-<br />
<br />
Who the heck is Hela G?<br />
<br />
Dressed in dark brownish sweater with the monkey hoodie being reminiscent of the game Seven Days at Charlies-which had a incredible blockbuster movie, a first for a non FPS game which gave she and her girlfriend a one up over those ‘gamer gurrrls’ on twitch.<br />
<br />
Her moderately fit body was concealed under that layer of warmth. Unzipped to display her favourite TunnelMaker shirt of a green bomb. Adding on to her collection of said game was a lanyard over her tee, which was attached to a building block that’s just directly below her B cups-currently being concealed under her sports bra.<br />
<br />
Pressing against her still slightly chubby booty was an earthly brunette, brown skirt which showed that her thighs definitely gained muscle from her former fats. <br />
<br />
Having previously been overweight, she clearly trained hard and wanting her girlfriend to do the same, not wanting to impress any of those rude heterosexual wankers but to show them that this 5ft 8 ‘chimp’ could kick any of them down with her jogging black sneakers if she wanted.<br />
<br />
Her nails and accessories was of a split monochrome, black and white, which was reminiscent of an anime courtroom game as her wrist spotted a Square Anicapture Wristband, currently turned on to generate steps so that she could catch another mystic in the worldwide phone game, Anicapture Stop.<br />
<br />
Pushing her fingers up, large black framed glasses framing her slightly rough squarish features and slightly brutish nose as she left walking away from the apartment, not wanting to explode with anger especially since she had to deal with all those homophobic trolls online-and now this. <br />
<br />
Almost giving her some sort of a pent up frustration as her boobs hardened, nipples erect.<br />
<br />
Long brunette hair hidden behind her hoodie as she flicked and decided to dial her girlfriend’s number-<br />
<br />
RING!<br />
RING!<br />
The number you tried to call does not exist.<br />
<br />
“Da fuck?” She roughly responded, as she continued to walk down...not even realising where she was going, or the fact the last girl solidified her frustration into her soon to be new self.<br />
<br />
———————<br />
Unknowingly, as those trolls continued to spam her account, almost like an angry mob as it continued to ban away all forms of the homosexual girl across gaming websites. Running all over it until it disappears from existence.<br />
<br />
Instead, unknowingly, her rarely used social media account, CassieCan, began flooding itself with likes and suggestions, thousand follows were done and unfollows were made to the LGBT community. Shifting their focus to the hot-end celebs, with mutual follows from nearly every rising company and notably-<br />
<br />
Jessica Bling and her boyfriend.<br />
———————————<br />
<br />
As Cassie stormed off angrily, it almost as though caused a greater burn to her weight, almost as though the petty homophobic insults were literally burning her fats as while her gaming skills deteriorated...her body certainly did not.<br />
<br />
Shrinking it greatly as though the time spent on games were more fulfilled in her routine, tummy shrunk all the way in as she recalled new exercises to lose her weight faster, preferring these almost as though she had known the secrets for a long while.<br />
<br />
Her waist simmered down almost as though those rude words did not phase her anymore and instead-were assisting her. Those ‘Not sexy enuff’ comments ended up causing a sway in her hips as she walked down the hall, her buttocks slightly plumping while firming up, almost like a legendary mixture as the trolls and douchebags from beyond the screen gasp in amazement elsewhere before those booty vids poofed and re-digitalised in somewhere in a magazine... <br />
<br />
“Ugh...huh....hmmm...why was I visiting the dorms?”<br />
<br />
As she pondered, memories and knowledge of games almost seemingly foreign to her, but the comments stuck, shrinking her legs as while they became leaner yet thinner as she almost seemed to be crisscrossing her footsteps as she made the way down the stairs.<br />
<br />
-Clunk, Clunk-<br />
<br />
As she placed her feet down, her sneakers began to refine themselves gracefully, almost a mirroring the elegance in her steps as they elevated her heel, placing the back of the foot down before the front as they lifted like a curve into the toes. <br />
<br />
Unable to comprehend the beauty and expense, her socks briefly became transparent as they showed her toe nails transfiguring into bright gorgeous turquoise like the underneath, almost like symbolising her growing new...hidden nature as her feet grew fairer and seemingly daintier.<br />
<br />
The underside becoming a turquoise green, while the top remaining under foot black as ever. Heel spotting on a luminous yellow as the remains of the black sneaker cover and laces moulded into a single solid white strap of her high heel shoes.<br />
<br />
The milky whiteness trailed up her now slender thin legs, rising the stocks as her height increased to a 5 ft 10 with socks turning silk, much more well off as they crawled all the way  below her skirt, and certainly over her gentle-like feet.<br />
<br />
‘A lady can’t dirty herself in front of her colleagues’<br />
<br />
Well...at least just in front of them.<br />
<br />
—————————<br />
Unknowing to her, a door appeared at the bottom floor, almost as though it was a portal to another world...or location as it closed itself shut for now. Readily waiting for its target to enter through it before transporting back to its original location.<br />
<br />
Of course the curse had measures of transportation, especially since he was making a Queen out of that aggressive gaymer girl.<br />
<br />
As for the Queen part...you will find out what kind of royalty she is turning into.<br />
<br />
—————————<br />
<br />
Her posture straightened, as she hit the lower floor, her very own jacket began letting loose out without disturbing their master. Bowing down as the kiddish fabric divided themselves into sheets, reorganising into a simple file labelled ‘Clients’ on the very top.<br />
<br />
That was why she was visiting Ms Hela G, she was one of her clients after all, and a very rising star in the music industry.<br />
<br />
In fact, she did not even have time for games, much less the kiddish adventure ones. Sure she had nothing against it, considering her little sis BFF, Jae Bang, had a sibling that skyrocketed online with her Youtube Gaming Career. <br />
<br />
What was her name again? AlphaGrrl or sumthin’? Anyways she should pay her a visit sometime in the near future...<br />
<br />
Not even realising the reality and memory change, her monstrous anger simmered down, sure she was aggressive-but she should save for that...in private, would not want to create a scene for no reason.<br />
<br />
Unless, it was for a purpose.<br />
<br />
She arrived at the ground floor, as her arms were a far cry from that dyke incoming mess that she had. Almost agreeing with the conservative hate that women should have a more ‘feminine’ approach, too bad they believe that a well off, successful business owner such as herself was not ‘feminine’.<br />
<br />
They could have gotten along too...such a shame. But nobody stands in her way in what she wants, and especially those that question her and her female clients’ femininity.<br />
<br />
Her fingers were drawn to the doorknob in front of her, it was a really...classy mahogany, as they slowly...traced around them, seemingly gentle and manicured...as they tightened their python-<br />
<br />
GRIP!<br />
<br />
Stepping in, as the door behind her closed off-teleporting back to its original, celebrity located position.<br />
<br />
——————————<br />
As nearly the final changes take place, her world clearly revolved around her as buildings rose and collapsed according to her will. Like a goddess, she does and commands as she pleases.<br />
<br />
At her new designated located, rising to the top floor was her as a huge label -Str8 Hop Records- was on a gigantic sign at the top. Almost hypnotising and commanding everyone in the city to focus on her-as her building was right at the center.<br />
<br />
As well as many more of her buildings at various locations...<br />
————————————<br />
Inside was numerous mahogany cabinets, picture frames of CDs above and a large long table-stretching all the way from what seems to be her office throne, numerous well furnished chairs stemming from the Queen, as it ought to be, as her open glass windows were covered by shutters as to not reveal her company’s trade secrets.<br />
<br />
Big desk, wide window. Lots of gold and platinum records on the walls. Awards and celebrity photos too. Big comfy executive chair. As well as  A small bar with...booze? Incredible! What a place for a high roller such as herself.<br />
<br />
Cassie felt confused and a sense a dissonance...her head was spinning and she felt like she was in a completely different reality...somewhere she did not belong...she had to...had to...<br />
<br />
‘Why not stay a little longer~?’<br />
<br />
Upon that seductive...familiar tone, she felt so...confident..so strong, so in control. Not like those hate comments from social media, she WAS the hate comments. Merciless as her crew did Everything she posted, everything she did was a trendsetter.<br />
<br />
And that is the way the Blings intends to keep it.<br />
<br />
She smiled, her hips swayed further as her lady bits felt a sense of euphoria from within. Feeling the strengths of a grown woman as it pulsates...desiring something rougher...more ferocious within!<br />
<br />
SWITCH!<br />
<br />
As she walked down, her slender model like arms were exposed for the world to see, like a tight coil, squeezing her body into an hour glass shape that she new possessed. Fitter than before as her complexion fairs up-knowing how to keep in style while working out.<br />
<br />
Her clothes were definitely out of place for a lady like her, as the uninteresting beta gaming clothing was seen centred around her ego. The gamer tee stretching and merging with the skirt as it formed a white elegant dress hugging her lady like back, with yellows accents near her hips. The lanyard detached itself and coiled around her waist as it formulated a belt-tightening and maintaining her weight as she had to look stunning regardless.<br />
<br />
‘Dats what Im talkin’ bout babe!’<br />
<br />
A loud, trashy voice sounded within her ears. From the outer appearance, she looked like a high class celebrity. Which she was, as that cartoonish wristband crawled and solidified its way into a diamond ring on her finger, while the tunnel...whatever...thing sharpened into a large gorgeous turquoise diamond-shape jewel, which was placed firmly around the cleavage.<br />
<br />
But in reality , trashy rap music really got her on, which made her a total monster in bed with her bombshell C cups erect, large round and clearly meant to be groped by the entire hand, pressed and fondled hard as she hurriedly pulled down the lever at her office door. Can’t wait for what’s in store!<br />
<br />
-CHUNK!-<br />
<br />
On one side posh and clean, but as the lever was pulled, the boardroom shifted to large speakers, lasers firing all over as the table top shifted to a pair of CD spinners and tons of switches.  Completely closed off and private to the outside world now, as her new room had a wide closet, completely filled with snapbacks and especially jerseys.<br />
<br />
She can finally be herself.<br />
<br />
Putting on a silver shiny jacket over her business attire, a mixture of class and blinding dominance which struck the final straw to the old gay Cassie, as the letters C and B are reflected arrogantly over on the breast areas of the garment, emphasising her newfound personality.<br />
<br />
Her brunette short top spread far and wide into a long dirty blonde, butterfly wing curl, forming a single large wing barely missing the floor as her bangs were slid onto the snapback, crowned and spun around like one of those thuggish babes as her eyes scanned the room for any intruders to her private sanctuary.<br />
<br />
She was posh in the board room, but a total savage always, and they thought those large pics of her booty all over social media were an accident-HAH! It was all planned.<br />
<br />
Her red lips curled deviously, flashing her perfect pearly whites as her gorgeously sculpted jaw rested over her soothing-pale vocal chords, supported by her neck. Cheek bones rising and blushing for the eldest gal in her fam, nose pointed outward while resting innocently below a powdery substance, concealing the deviousness of her intentions, hair curling outward like tentacles ready to invite and devour their prey.<br />
<br />
Specially men whom are captivated by her, submitting to her, belonging to her. Whether they know it or not, there’s nothing they could do...Not that any of her prey would want to anyway. Though she did have a dyke problem at hand.<br />
<br />
With that remark, as her eyebrows trimmed to perfection as they furrowed briefly, thin and blonde like the topaz earrings she is spotting. She pinched her forehead as her eyes thinned out, shallowness and a prideful attitude mirrored in them, reflecting a emerald green vision of her true self as C@$$andra Bling. The head elder sister in charge of marketing, celebrity gossip, and a huge baller babe to a certain hottie whose the star player in her life.<br />
<br />
Behind her dainty outlook was the Real Queen of Rap, and queen needs a king befitting of her true tastes within.<br />
<br />
‘BA DUM DSH!’<br />
<br />
Said Baller Babe answered with a flick of da phone. Poppin’ a large wad of bubble gum as her heart leaped in anticipation to her Hawaiian Rappin’ boy toy on the other line. She had plans for their little show tonight.<br />
<br />
-FLICK!-<br />
“YO BABE! HOWS YOUSE DOIN’!”</p>
