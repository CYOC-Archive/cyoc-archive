<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">William felt a bit more comfortable with some things  after the conversation with Samantha and Frances Twist. Both he and Martha had been to the City Council meeting and thus they both knew how the vote was reached. William had never studied politics and never pretended to understand them, beyond maybe how writers portrayed politics in their literature, but he did get the sense that Tom Herald and used some facts in making his argument. William could commend the man for that much, even if he had his own worries about the possible negatives that might come out of a reveal.<br />
<br />
And those negatives were all possible, and to a certain level, both William and Martha worried on that possibility. For if the response was negative, it would come back to hurt their family, which neither wanted. William knew that he&#39;d made his fair share of mistakes in his life. Not noticing or realizing that Martha had been struggling with being bisexual when they first married and then letting himself be lead by his own lusts was the biggest of them. But he&#39;d never let himself be a bad parent. Nate and Eric deserved long happy lives, and William was determined to give the best chance at that. But a negative response would risk that and William knew enough about the world that not revealing Moon Lake in the reveal wouldn&#39;t necessarily keep Moon Lake from being discovered if the result was negative and the last thing he wanted that to happen and see his sons lose their happiness as a result.<br />
<br />
&quot;There will still be some concerns that are there...&quot; Martha spoke as she watched Samantha walk around the table and then sit down in the chair next to Frances and her own chair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Though... you&#39;ve put some of our greatest worries at ease,&quot; William added, &quot;and for that we thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d think that if you went to the meeting, you&#39;d be a bit more aware on the reasoning for the vote,&quot; Samantha commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;As said... we know how they got to the decision they made,&quot; Martha answered, &quot;but not on how it would work out in the long term... For if they rush things and the response is negative...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well a negative response would be bad, regardless of how long it takes to make the decision,&quot; Frances corrected, &quot;the bigger thing for the moment would be more that making sure the plan is coherent and covers everything and gathers as much information as possible to assure a more positive response is likely.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which is what the City Council will do,&quot; Samantha nodded in agreement with her wife, &quot;if the vote had been more one sided... then &quot;rushing&quot; things might be possible, but given that this relates to the were secret, that sort of vote was likely never likely given the way things are right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that has put our worries with the potential negatives at ease,&quot; William nodded in reply.<br />
<br />
&quot;And the worries with the potential positives?&quot; Frances asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;More on what we&#39;d be allowed to do if the response is positive,&quot; Martha spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Such as being who we truly are more often,&quot; William nodded, &quot;the fox in me... he seems more real to me than anything that I was before moving here. And since you turned Martha... she&#39;s been happier and more confident in herself, which makes the fox in me happy to see her happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which is good to hear,&quot; Samantha commented, &quot;but as said earlier... all of that really won&#39;t be determined until we know more on the nature of the response. And until then... Moon Lake will do what it can to make sure that the worst is avoided and that the town stays safe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that&#39;s really all we wanted to hear,&quot; Martha reached over to touch Samantha&#39;s hand.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
A few houses down and on the opposite side of Wood Street, Martin Stovall quietly walked down the hallway that lead to the master bedroom where he and Melissa were due to get some much needed sleep. The day had been relatively taxing with all the calls from supporters and/or opponents regarding the City Council&#39;s decision. It was frustrating in that the first reaction from those against the proposed idea was to panic and the first response from those that wanted it was if they could transform more often and in public places. Most of the calls had come from those against the reveal, but that didn&#39;t make the fact that Martin&#39;s day had been spent having to deal with people from both camps any better.<br />
<br />
In this, there were times where he wished his day to day worries were less and he could simply enjoy treating Melissa as though she was the most beautiful woman on Earth, and as far as he could see, she was. As he glanced to her, the soft glow that surrounded her was still there, even after all the years since first seeing her at the gas station on the south entrance into town. It showed that she was his one true love and would always be so, and now that glow was even stronger. For Melissa was presently pregnant with what would be their second child. It was very early and a part of Martin worried about a little one coming into a troubled world, but he resolved himself to do his best to keep Moon Lake safe.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m glad things are quiet for the moment,&quot; Martin said softly as they walked by the hall, passing the door to Julie&#39;s room and then turning into their own room, &quot;the day was trying...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can imagine,&quot; Melissa commented as she turned on a small bedside lamp to its lowest setting.<br />
<br />
It softly illuminated the room and allowed both to undress with some degree of safety at not stubbing their toes in the dark. Unlike most other weres that were based of known animals, weremers didn&#39;t get as much of the boost in terms of their senses. They weren&#39;t exactly blind in the dark, as water could potentially add layers of protection from things like sunlight, but their senses were really best for working under water. In this, being able to breathe, talk, see, and hear under water without difficulty or creating difficulty were trade offs that weremers took with the acceptance that out of water their vision, hearing, and sense of smell wouldn&#39;t be as good as other weres.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I&#39;m sure things will settle down,&quot; Melissa commented to him, &quot;they always do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure... I just...&quot; Martin paused to look to see his wife approach him as he stood by the laundry hamper, dropping his shirt into it while lifting up her own shirt, &quot;I just wish that all of this wasn&#39;t potentially going to put strain on you... stress on you. I mean... we haven&#39;t even had much chance to tell people that you&#39;re pregnant. And now... not that many will care. I care. Julie cares... Your parents and my mother down in California will care. But many of the people that we&#39;re friends with up here... they&#39;ll either be too worried to care…&quot;<br />
<br />
His voice fell off at the end and his shoulders slumped as a result as he looked down. Melissa could see his frustration as she tossed her shirt into the hamper and as soon working to undo the clasps on her bra.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t need fanfare,&quot; Melissa told him, &quot;and you&#39;ve done a lot of good for Moon Lake. The people should know that the City Council will take this seriously and will make sure things are covered and that if their plan doesn&#39;t cover all the angles that you wouldn&#39;t sign off on it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Martin replied as he turned and took Melissa into a firm hug, &quot;but all the same... I&#39;d love to give that to you. The love of my life. The most beautiful and smartest women I&#39;ve ever met. Just knowing you has made me happy. Everything else has added to that happiness. And I&#39;d want our newest bundle of joy to come into a world that isn&#39;t tearing itself apart over a reveal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you honestly think that will happen?&quot; Melissa asked, &quot;or are you letting a bunch of overly concerned weres jumping off the dock because someone proposed a surprise and explained it well enough to earn the support of the City Council and the Deputy Mayor?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose... I am letting it get to me a little,&quot; Martin admitted.<br />
<br />
He soon felt Melissa&#39;s hands slide down his chest and move toward his pants as she began to pull him back toward the bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then let me refocus your mind on something more enjoyable,&quot; Melissa said to her husband, &quot;For you already know that all of this will take time to put together. Until then, we&#39;ll just have to wait.&quot;<br />
<br />
Seeing Melissa smile was enough for Martin to let his wife pull him to the bed.</p>
