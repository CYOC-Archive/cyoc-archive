<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jensen sat calmly on a large comfortable chair with one leg on a footstool, so that Darla could change the bandages. Fran, Kaylee, Isabelle, Hope, and Grace were all still present as well. Fran was there to remain close to her twin, while Jensen learned that Kaylee was primarily there for the moment to learn about first aide from Darla, and that the shadows had been instructed to order a training dummy for the two she-wolves to practice on. He felt it odd, at first, but then shrugged. Marcy and Kevin had proved that he wasn't invulnerable before their mental transformations kicked in, so the more wolves that could at least do first aide, the better.<br />
<br />
That then made Jensen wonder about a few other things, mostly relating to medicine. In time his pack's females would eventually go into heat and it would expand naturally through the pregnancy of each female, which might be the only time that Roger, Lawrence, and Ulysses might get a legitimate shot at mating, given the far more masculine forms that Nick and Zack held by comparison. But, Jensen didn't know how many puppies each female could carry. Would it be like a normal wolf, which could be up to fourteen at a time, and usually ranged around six? Or would it be like a human where one was the norm with exceptions of twins and triplets, but anything more then that being extremely unusual. And who would deliver the pups? Fran and Darla knew first aid, and Fran had a family that would be joining the pack eventually, so they might be able to help in that regard. But, if Fran was one of the she-wolves giving birth, she wouldn't be able to help all that much.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe we could &quot;dare&quot; the local gynecologist to treat the she-wolves without question or opposition when that time comes,&quot; Jensen thought, &quot;or transform one person into a wolf with that knowledge and have it on hand...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That bridge can be crossed when we get to it,&quot; Jensen then dismissed it, &quot;Maybe Fran's wife, when she became a triplet of the current twins could be given all the necessary knowledge to prepare his pack for the eventual birth of new puppies.&quot;<br />
<br />
Darla, meanwhile carefully removed the bandage that had been applied after they had found the Master in his wounded state.<br />
<br />
&quot;We should have changed this yesterday,&quot; Darla spoke to Kaylee, as the Alpha Female stood behind her, looking rather intrigued, &quot;the wounds Marcy and Kevin left weren't life threatening, but leaving the same bandages on for too long invites bacteria and infection.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaylee nodded as the bandages were removed, letting her look at the wounds as they healed. She heard semi-frightened gasps come from Jensen's former click come from behind her. Darla meanwhile carefully looked at the wounds and sniffed them. She then gestured for Kaylee to come closer and do the same.<br />
<br />
&quot;As you can see, they're not bleeding anymore and nothing looks infected at the moment,&quot; Darla explained, &quot;and thankfully, nothing smells infected. But, for basic treatment, it's still a good idea to take no chances until the skin grows back over the bite wounds and the fur grows back... although the Master seems to be healing rather quickly. I think he'll be fully healed in a day or two.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaylee nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Those little pups did THIS to the Master?&quot; Grace asked in a shocked voice while Darla turned fetch what would be needed next.<br />
<br />
&quot;They were disciplined FIRMLY for it,&quot; Kaylee informed the pack's newest she-wolves, &quot;and they were really sorry when then they realized what they had done. And you'll see that all of the pups love their father now.&quot;<br />
<br />
All four she-wolves nodded. Darla then turned and raised the proper ointments so that Kaylee could see them.<br />
<br />
&quot;These are to be dabbed gently on each wound before the new bandage is placed to insure that the wounds heal,&quot; Darla instructed, &quot;although, again, the Master is healing faster then a human would. So, it won't be long before this won't be necessary anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
Darla then carefully dabbed the wounds that Kevin had left. Wincing as Jensen cringed each time. Grateful that the master would heal quickly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, Alpha Female, duplicate what I did with Kevin's wounds on the bites Marcy left,&quot; Darla instructed, knowing that the best teacher was to actually do the act, and letting Kaylee get the experience. She and Fran could easily correct any mistake Kaylee might make.<br />
<br />
Kaylee nodded and moved to kneel beside the wound that Darla was treating. She was actually fighting an urge in her mind to simply lick the wound constantly, which was likely what a normal wolf would do.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry if this hurts you, Master,&quot; Kaylee apologized to Jensen ahead of time.<br />
<br />
&quot;It isn't as bad as an amputation,&quot; Jensen replied, &quot;Go ahead.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I would think an amputation would be a doctor's decision, Master,&quot; Fran commented, &quot;Not a first aid giver... although, I don't think any of the Pack has had the training to be a doctor, so I can't tell you the procedure they would follow for that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd think they'd still dull the pain first, though,&quot; Darla finished.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's like they're clones,&quot; Isabelle whispered to Hope, knowing that Hope and Grace could also hear, although not knowing that the twins could also hear her. Fran and Darla, however, didn't notice or didn't care.<br />
<br />
Kaylee, however, ignored the background conversation and went about doing the application of the ointment to prevent the bite wounds on Jensen from becoming infected. Jensen, again winced, which made her nervous, but she followed her instructions from him to continue. Once she finished, Darla took the clean bandage they had gathered and began to wrap it over the bite wounds.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, the bandage is wrapped tightly over the wounds to limit the amount of air flowing over them,&quot; Darla explained, &quot;but not so tight that it restricts the blood flow to the Master's foot. That way it helps keep it from getting infected and insures that the wounds do not open again when he moves... or mates with us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would we not want the blood flow restricted?&quot; Kaylee asked curiously, not having any prior first aide training.<br />
<br />
&quot;Having it THAT tight would be like a tourniquet,&quot; Darla answered, &quot;It would actually kill everything below it and would require that everything in the Master's lower leg be amputated.&quot;<br />
<br />
Every wolf there then shuddered at that, as they didn't want that to happen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah,&quot; Kaylee answered after a few moments.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is all we can do for now,&quot; Darla commented.<br />
<br />
There was a silence for a few moments before anyone heard or said anything. When it was something, it wasn't necessarily something that they had expected.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think something just fell down in the main entry way,&quot; Hope commented turning her head back to the empty doorway and hallway beyond.<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Who is that?&quot; Marcy asked Martha as they all looked at an elderly man who currently stood just inside the main entrance way near the living room they were in at the time.<br />
<br />
The man looked halfway shocked and frightened, with some disappointed as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;That would be Mistress Jenny's grandfather and Master Jensen's great-grandfather,&quot; Martha answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;The man I was sent to spy on,&quot; Alice added as she also turned to see him and recognizing him from her earlier mission.<br />
<br />
&quot;He's still alive?&quot; Anne asked from her position behind the sofa, &quot;I do not remember her coming to the estate that often.<br />
<br />
&quot;Obviously he is,&quot; Beatrice commented and then turned toward him.<br />
<br />
The old man did the one thing he could do wolves from that room, including Martha and he pups turned to him and began to approach him. He fainted.</p>
