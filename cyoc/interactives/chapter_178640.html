<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Luke stirred in his sleep, feeling something warm and soft wrapping around his cock. His eyes slid open and he looked down to Gio with his mouth wrapped around his rigid cock, sun light trickling in between the bedroom curtains. He was surprised the man could still go after last night. He was surprised he could still go. They had had sex twice after dinner, both times Gio taking Luke&#39;s large member between the cheeks. He had learned two things about the man so far, first he was insatiable, second he had a thing for big cocks.<br />
<br />
He reached down and tangled his finger&#39;s in Gio&#39;s long curly hair, rocking his hips slowly as the man took a surprising amount of Luke&#39;s cock down his throat. So far he hadn&#39;t used the bracelet on Gio, but his curiosity was slowly getting the better of him. Would it even work, he focused for a moment, a hard thing to do with someone doing such and expert job in bringing him towards orgasm, but it only took the right thoughts.<br />
<br />
His skin darkened just a bit more past the lightly sun-kissed shade he had to an olive-tinged tan a little lighter than Gio&#39;s own complexion. <br />
Even his nipples and cock darkened slightly. The brown bush around the base of his cock thickened and turned black. In fact all his body hair followed suit. Luke had always been a smooth guy, but now a black strip of hair grew up the middle of his stomach, a small patch forming in the middle of his chest from the blond fuzz, dark and short. It was nothing on the fully furred chest that Gio sported, but it was still more than Luke had ever had before.<br />
<br />
He moaned softly as he shot his load right into Gio&#39;s eagerly waiting mouth. He swallowed every drop, licking Luke clean before he came up for a kiss, salty and musky but very welcome. &quot;Good morning, Lucca.&quot; He purred in his accent, hand running across the light patch of hair now in the middle of Luke&#39;s chest. He didn&#39;t notice anything different of course, but he did seem to enjoy stroking Luke&#39;s chest hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning.&quot; Luke said with a smile, then.. &quot;Morning.&quot; He looked over to the clock on Gio&#39;s nightstand and groaned. &quot;I gotta get to work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can use my shower.&quot; Gio said with a nod to the bathroom door. Luke thanked him with another kiss and went to do just that. He stopped in front of the vanity, the reflection peering back at him slightly unfamiliar. It was still him in a way, he could make out his features but other things had changed. Not only was his skin a little darker, his now black brows were thicker and his nose was a bit more prominent. Scruff lined his jaw, and not just in his old patchy beard, this completely connected. His hair had gone from mousey brown to a shiny black with just a little wave to it, not Gio&#39;s full curl. He didn&#39;t know if the bracelet could swipe ethnicity, but it did, and did it in such a way that he was still a version of himself not a copy of the one he borrowed it from.<br />
<br />
He only took a moment to admire the changes before hopping in the shower, his morning jack off session no longer needed after last night and this morning. He wasn&#39;t sure he could cum again yet. He did explore his body as he cleaned though, marveling at just how different he was after less than a day. He could spend every day as someone different. He got out of the shower and toweled off, slicking his hair back with a little product he found on the sink. He considered shaving but rejected it, liking the way the stubble looked for now.<br />
<br />
Gio watched from the kitchen, eating a bowl of cereal as Luke walked around his apartment naked, finding his clothes before pulling them back on. Though he couldn&#39;t seem to find his pants, the other man teasingly pulling them out from behind him as Luke asked, only relinquishing them after another kiss and forcing Luke to put his contact info in his phone with a promise to call him this weekend. Not that Luke needed much convincing.<br />
<br />
His clothes were a little rumpled. But there was nothing to do for it now. At least he didn&#39;t have any important meetings today. He went downstairs and hopped in his car, luckily he was closer to work now than he would be at home, but he was still running a little late. His phone dinged and he looked at the screen. Gio had wasted no time making sure Luke had his contact too, by sending him a nude that got him tenting his pants again.</p>
