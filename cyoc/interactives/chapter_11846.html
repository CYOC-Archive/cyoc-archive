<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">They searched the computer desperately... the program was nowhere to be found!  The boys began to panic.  Jake searched for the date... it was still 2004... What had happened?  He loaded the internet to see if he could find the game, but again, to no avail.  His parents had set up blocks so that he couldn't find anything of &quot;questionable nature.&quot;... he was only 7 after all.  &quot;I can't get it back!&quot;  Jake cried.  &quot;We're stuck like this!&quot;<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
  The two boys decided that they would resolve themselves to this new, old life... but they didn't do it for lack of trying.  Every day that passed, the boys were still fighting for the solution.  At 7 years old, they were now privvy to games such as cops and robbers, though they still felt 'too mature' to play them.  Instead, they watched their old friends, still 14 year olds, going to dances and beginning to date.  Jake refused to give up.  He spent everyday in front of his little computer trying to find the program.  Soon, their second trip through grade 2 was over.  Jake's incessant searching had kept him from getting much excercise, and by halfway through grade 3, he was getting somewhat pudgy.<br />
<br />
  Grade 3 passed slowly, just as grade 2 had.  Jake's computer was improving, but nowhere close to what he had gotten for his early birthday present when he was about to turn 15.  Tim had started going to Karate, so he was at least using this chance to learn new things.  Grade 4 came and went, and the boys watched their friends get their liscences... it would be another 6 years for them.  At 10 years old, they were slowly reaching their original ages.<br />
<br />
  Grade 5 began after the boys had become 11.  After 3 years of eating, sleeping, and breathing in front of the computer, Jake had become the fat kid.  He didn't need to worry about being picked on though, Tim had his back, and everyone thought Tim was &quot;real cool.&quot;.  Grade 5 ended with the boys being 12...  Grade 6 came with slight changes.  Tim began to grow a little taller... so did Jake, but the girls had them beat.  Soon, they were 13 and in the 7th grade.<br />
<br />
  Jake sat once more in front of the computer, and the phone rang.  He called to his mom in his almost-normal-again voice.  &quot;I've got it!&quot;.  He picked up and heard Tim on the other line. &quot;Well, I don't know about you Jake... but I think we're going pretty good this time around.  I've got all my pubes back... my dick is 5 inches again. My voice is back to normal, too!  I'm just a few inches under my old height!&quot;.  &quot;Yeah&quot; Jake Replied. &quot;My body is almost normal again too... besides the fact that I've got almost 90 pounds on my old, 14 year-old body.  My dick is a little shorter though.. I guess cause I'm so fat.&quot;  Jake was right.  At 14, he had been a lean 120 pounds... now he was fat, really fat at 206.  &quot;No worries though.  When I get that program again, we're growing up.  We'll make ourselves 21, with all our friends.&quot;.<br />
<br />
  The year went by. The boys got bigger, their bodies changed as they grew to 14.  And, just a month before Jake turned 15, he got his new computer.  The now 220 pound teen, and his much more fit friend had the sleepover one more time.  They spent their time trying to find the program.  On the day of May 8th, 2011, they found it.  The program installed, and the computer updated it's files.  As it did, the boys had a conversation.  &quot;You know Tim, in less than a minute, we'll be hitting the exact time we turned ourselves back like that...  god, I can't wait to fix this.&quot;.  The boys watched as the computer reached it's half-way point in the update, and Jake's watch beeped.  &quot;Oh look... our anniversary.&quot; He said to Tim jokingly.  He suddenly began to feel weird.  &quot;Whoa... got dizzy for a second there.&quot;.  &quot;Me too.&quot; said Tim, then they felt their stomachs drop.  Both of the boys began to shrink.  &quot;Oh no!&quot; Jake shouted.<br />
<br />
  The boys, who had both grown to thei old 5'7&quot; heights had shrunk a few inches.  Tim knew what was happening!  He opened his pants to see his new pubic hair retreating into his body around his shrinking dick.  &quot;It's happening again!&quot; He said, causing his voice to &quot;un-crack.&quot;  He looked 11 again.  Jake was now a fat little boy sitting in front of a computer.  The two boys shrank away from puberty, becoming younger and younger with each passing second.  Soon they were 10 again, then 9... then 8... and once again... 7.  Jake surveyed his body, which was still substantially fat... why hadn't that changed too?  He was hairless, short, and his dick had to be less than an inch!  Tim was fairing a little better, keeping in shape.  Jake's mother walked into the room, and the boys gasped.  She was fat too!  Jake's world was unaware of the changes that had occured to them, and as a result, his mother and father were now the genetic responsibilities to his weight.  <br />
<br />
  &quot;What's going on in here, Jakey?&quot;  She said, holding a laundry basket.  &quot;Timmy, you're staying over tonight, right?&quot;.  Tim nodded, and looked back to the now childish computer sitting on the counter.  It flashed the date 05/08/2011.  The boys were now 21 year old's trapped in 7 year old bodies... what were they going to do?</p>
