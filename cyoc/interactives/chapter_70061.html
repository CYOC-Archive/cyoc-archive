<br />
<br />
Jeremy sat down at the dinning room table. His friend Jacob had bought him a prank item. As a fifteen year old Jeremy thought it was pretty stupid but he decided he might as well entertain his friend.  The joke of the item was that it was a pair of dice. You were supposed to roll and then “transform” into whatever the number corresponded with on the sheet that came with it. Jeremy and Jacob figured it was a acting game. You roll something and have to pretend that is what you are.<br />
<br />
“Let's get started Jeremy. This will be fun.” Jacob said. Jeremy laughed, took the dice in his hands and rolled.<br />
<br />
A Five?<br />
<br />
“Haha it says become a five year old man.”<br />
<br />
Jeremy chuckled as he started to feel a warm tingle spread over his body. “What the hell bro. I feel weird.” Jeremy said. Jeremy could feel his shirt loosening around him until it started to just slip off of him.<br />
<br />
Jacob watched as Jeremy shrunk in height and his body hair receded into his skin. Now completely soft. His clothes fell off his body and Jeremy lay in practically nude in over sized clothing.<br />
<br />
Frightened Jacob said, “Dude, are you alright? Oh I hope it's temporary. I feel like I'm going insane. This isn't real. This can't be happening.”<br />
<br />
Jeremy started to cry. “Now you roll. I can't believe this is happening. You can't leave me like this. You have to play too.”<br />
<br />
“Alright. Alright. I don't want to but it is only fair. Not to mention I don't want to have to explain what happened to anyone. It might be best if we're both...well I'll just roll.” Jacob picked up his dye and threw it onto the table.<br />
<br />
He threw a 20. Jeremy started to get larger and taller. Body hair started to grow back in the places that had body hair and he stopped crying. Jeremy was back to his fifteen year old self. Although, with slightly less clothes.<br />
<br />
Jeremy gathered up his clothes and put them on completely embarrassed.<br />
<br />
Jacob laughed, “Well that wasn't so bad. So it is temporary. Wanna roll again? It might be fun. I know none of this should be real but hell, it's pretty interesting.”<br />
<br />
Jeremy chuckled nervously. “Why not. It even felt sort of good to be five again. At least a small bit. It was pretty scary though. I'll play another round though.” <br />
<br />
Jeremy grabbed his dye and rolled it again. 9.<br />
<br />
This time Jeremy started to regress again. Losing body hair and height but stopping at a almost mature age. Nine. Jeremy cursed. “Why am I only getting regressed. This is weird bro. Without hair. I feel nine again. Haha”<br />
<br />
Jacob grabbed his dye and threw it. Eighteen. Nothing happened.<br />
Jeremy grabbed his dye. “Damnit dude! We're going to play until something happens to you.” <br />
Jeremy threw it, 13.<br />
<br />
Jeremy started to grow again. Body hair started to form on his face. Some peach fuzz mostly. Jeremy stopped at about thirteen years of age.<br />
<br />
“Well at least I aged up this time.” Jeremy laughed. “Your turn!”<br />
<br />
Jacob picked up his dye and threw it. 3.<br />
<br />
Jacob felt a itching sensation flow over him. Looking down he saw light brown hairs sprouting on his arms. He looking into his shirt and saw a offwhite patch on his stomach. The hair started to thicken into a coat of sleek fur.<br />
<br />
Jacob felt a pushing sensation from where his but should be and taking off his pants/underwear saw he had a tail. He also could tell the fur was spreading over his whole body.<br />
<br />
Jeremy looked at Jacob and laughed, “Haha finally something happened. You're a cat person dude.”<br />
<br />
Jacob said, “For now. Your turn bro.”<br />
<br />
Jeremy threw the dye: 9.<br />
<br />
Jeremy regressed again. “Well it was fun while it lasted I suppose. Back to being nine.”<br />
<br />
Jacob grabbed his and threw it. 5 Jacob felt his fur vanishing but with it he was also shrinking. Becoming younger and more human. His tail sank back into him and he became a five year old. Just like Jeremy when he was five Jacob starting to cry. He couldn't help it.<br />
<br />
Jeremy smiled, “Now you know how I felt dude. My turn again I suppose. I guess I'll roll for you next round.”<br />
<br />
Jeremy rolled: 18<br />
<br />
Nothing happened to him.<br />
<br />
Jacob's turn. Jeremy took the dye and rolled for him hoping the game would allow it.<br />
<br />
Jacob rolled a: 13<br />
<br />
He became thirteen. Peach Fuzz and hair growing as well as him getting taller.<br />
<br />
Jeremy rolled: 18.<br />
<br />
Nothing again.<br />
<br />
Jacob rolled: 13<br />
<br />
Nothing.<br />
<br />
Jeremy rolled: 13<br />
<br />
He aged to thirteen again. Peach Fuzz, body hair, height. All of that grew.<br />
<br />
Jacob: 18<br />
<br />
Nothing.<br />
<br />
Jeremy rolled: 19<br />
<br />
This time Jeremy could feel something happening but it wasn't obvious. Something in his head was churning and changing. Jacob felt the same way. Looking around he forgot that he was ever really older than thirteen. He must have rolled something in the game to make him older for awhile. He'd never been any older than this in reality.<br />
<br />
Jacob felt the same way. “Well my head hurts but I think I could go for one more round.”<br />
<br />
Jacob rolled: 10. (My own rules here)<br />
<br />
Jacob and Jeremy felt a churning again. Jeremy got up and hugged Jacob tightly in an embrace. “I'm sorry Jacob I just had to. You're so...huggable. Haha that's so weird to say man but...there's something about your eyes that just makes me want to see you happy.”<br />
<br />
Jeremy then kissed Jacob on the lips and Jacob kissed back. After the kiss Jacob stood back and said, “Alright man I think we've played enough. This is getting weird. Let's go play some video games or something.”<br />
<br />
Jacob grabbed Jeremy's hand and walked up stairs with him like that. Leaving the dice on the table for someone else to deal with. Having totally forgotten about the game in the first place.</p>
