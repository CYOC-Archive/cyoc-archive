<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;We ought to do something for the both of you...&quot; Tabby commented as she lead the small &quot;wedding party&quot; out of the church.<br />
<br />
&quot;You and Dave have already done so much for Molly and me,&quot; I told her, &quot;you don't have to do more.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;George, without your help during the summer my vineyard NEVER would have gotten started,&quot; Dave spoke from beside his wife, &quot;we're currently processing the grapes that grew over the summer and it will take a while to get things into peak production, but without your help we'd still be planting rows of grapes...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You made sure Beauregard didn't go after Molly while I was at the academy,&quot; I replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;But this is something special,&quot; Tabby commented, &quot;your wedding day. The fact that a bunch of idiots with an ax to grind shouldn't be able to keep you from doing something... a reception... or something...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We don't have that many friends to invite to such a thing,&quot; I commented, &quot;most of Molly's friends in college, while they stayed friendly to her... it was no longer all that close...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And the girls I grew up with in high school haven't even talked to me since my transformation,&quot; Molly spoke, &quot;and for sticking with me, George is in much the same boat. People see me and they think &quot;man-eater&quot;. They then see George and they think &quot;crazy&quot;. It isn't really conducive to having something like a reception.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about the other officers here in town, or the school staff?&quot; Dave wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Some of the school workers are R.A.M. members,&quot; Molly grumbled, &quot;they're still hoping Mrs. Fitzpatrick gives the superintendent a report that is negative enough to justify firing me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And those that have been friendly... it's been more of a professional relationship rather then a personal one,&quot; I added.<br />
<br />
&quot;We still ought to do something,&quot; Dave grumbled, and then snapped his fingers, &quot;we'll host the reception for you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We don't want to impose...&quot; I began.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nonsense,&quot; Dave answered, &quot;we have a big juicy ham... as well as leftovers from Christmas dinner. I can clear our back patio of snow and the two of you can dance, and your folks can get a lovely view of the mountains.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It'll give you a chance for a real family photo,&quot; Tabby added.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't have to do this...&quot; Molly spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Doesn't mean that we don't want to,&quot; Dave replied and shook her hand, &quot;you and George are our family's friends, and you invited us to your wedding. Let us give you some small celebration in return...&quot;<br />
<br />
I thought the line ended there, but Dave continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;Besides,&quot; Dave finished, &quot;with George supposed to go in to work in a few days and Molly back to her work at the school, it's not like you have time for a real honeymoon...&quot;<br />
<br />
I could only shake my head and I heard Molly sigh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, Dave,&quot; I said slowly, &quot;You are a true friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The reception wasn't much more then a quiet get together at Dave's home. Dave spent most of the start of it shoveling his patio while Tabby started on what would be the preparations for &quot;dinner&quot;. Veronica helped Dave a bit and took delight in showing my parents the view of the mountains that the Choir family had from their home.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you again for all this,&quot; I said to Tabby sipping from a wine glass, &quot;This is really above and beyond.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's no problem,&quot; Tabby answered, &quot;and our patio is large enough for the two of you to actually dance together, and it's something for friends to do to to be friendly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now if only George could dance,&quot; Molly quipped.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can dance,&quot; I protested.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not well,&quot; Molly chuckled, &quot;but I love you anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not even slow dancing?&quot; Tabby asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;He's better at that then others,&quot; Molly said with a chuckle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that was the type of dancing that I was thinking about,&quot; Tabby answered, &quot;not this sort of club dancing that people do now...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What can I do to help, mommy?&quot; Veronica asked as she came in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go get your CD player dear and set it by the door to the patio, dear,&quot; Tabby told her and then turned to Molly and I, &quot;Dave and I have our wedding music on CD, which you can slow dance to, and I have some CDs that are you can slow dance to as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
About ten minutes later, Molly and I danced quietly on the back patio of Dave's house. It felt cold, and it felt odd doing this in a winter jacket, but it was a nice quiet moment as we danced to quiet it music in the background.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is nice, George,&quot; Molly said softly and lowered her head to nuzzle the top of my head. I could feel the warmth of her fur through my hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, it is,&quot; I agreed, &quot;atypical of most weddings, but then I suppose we're not most couples.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, we're not,&quot; Molly smiled, &quot;but then who wants to be most couples?&quot;<br />
<br />
We danced on for a little while more before dinner was ready, which proved to be a wonderful meal. It involved a lot of toasts to Molly and I, and many of them were things we had both heard from Dave and his family and my folks as well. My father never had any wine, and he was the designated driver for the rest of us. I found myself in the backseat of my truck being hugged and nuzzled by Molly when we drove back to Bandhavgarh Cabin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your mother and I have a little wedding gift for you as well,&quot; my father spoke as he opened the door to let Molly and I out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hm...&quot; I replied, feeling slightly drunk from the reception.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your mother and I have a hotel room,&quot; my father spoke, &quot;you and Molly have the cabin to yourselves tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Have a good night,&quot; I told him before Molly lifted me up into her arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;You too,&quot; my father gave a smirk that I didn't fully recognize.<br />
<br />
Molly then began to carry me toward the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Isn't it the groom who carries the bride across the threshold?&quot; I asked her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who wants to be &quot;normal&quot;?&quot; Molly retorted, &quot;besides, I'm afraid you'd hurt yourself trying to carry me.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
I was pretty sure I knew what was coming as we made our way in. Molly had to hunch herself over slightly because of her height to get through the door, but she was still able to hold on to me. It showed how strong she was in her present form. Once inside she headed straight up the stairs to the second floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you, Molly,&quot; I said to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you, too,&quot; Molly answered and lifted me up to nuzzle my face with her muzzle, tickling my cheeks with her fur and whiskers.<br />
<br />
&quot;We don't have to if you don't want to...&quot; I told her.<br />
<br />
&quot;We are married now,&quot; Molly answered, &quot;we've done it right... and right now... I NEED you... why are you so nervous?&quot;<br />
<br />
I gave an embarrassed gulp.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I'm not sure I'm big enough... to... um... please you,&quot; I said slowly.<br />
<br />
She nuzzled me more.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are all the man I could want,&quot; Molly said as she sat me down on our bed, &quot;I don't care if you're large or small down there. I care about you being you.&quot;<br />
<br />
I was then pushed onto my back. Molly then began to climb onto the bed with a smile on her muzzle, &quot;now, George, make love to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Again she nuzzled me while bringing her hands to undo the zipper on my jacket. While she undid the zipper tentatively raised my hands the row of buttons going down the front of the dress that Molly was wearing, which had a very Chinese style to it (even though her ancestry was actually German and the subspecies of tiger she had been turned into was from India, Bangladesh, and Nepal). Around her waistline the seem seemed to stop.<br />
<br />
&quot;It goes around to the other side, George,&quot; Molly spoke, &quot;right around the base of my tail.&quot;<br />
<br />
I nodded and kicked my shoes off while Molly worked with pulling off my jacket, which was tossed on the floor nearby. Once my arms were free and Molly began working on my shirt, I moved to follow her earlier directions. I found the seem again right at the base of her tail. I began undoing the buttons there and elicited a soft growling moan in the process.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did I do something wrong?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Molly nuzzled me again, tickling me with her whiskers again, &quot;you're rubbing against the very base of my tail. Right were it meets my butt...&quot;<br />
<br />
I heard her snicker a little.<br />
<br />
&quot;...it feels good,&quot; Molly finished and then nuzzled me again.<br />
<br />
And with that she let her dress fall off her before tossing it toward my jacket on the floor. Her nipples stood firm on her breasts and there was some sign of arousal at her own loins, which surprised me a bit as I hadn't done much to actually stimulate her.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're... you're ready...&quot; I stammered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I NEED you,&quot; Molly spoke as she managed to undo the last button on my shirt and began working on my pants buttons.<br />
<br />
I sensed some urgency in her voice, which I couldn't picture, but I didn't decide to question. I slipped out of my shirt and then reached up to caress her breasts. Her fur there was very soft, though I could feel that they rested on extremely firm pectoral muscles.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooooooooorrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrmmmmmmmmmmmmm,&quot; Molly gave a low moan, &quot;I hope you're ready...&quot;<br />
<br />
She had gotten my pants undone and pulled them and my own underwear down far enough that I was able to kick them off of me, leaving them in a pile on the floor at the end of the bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Getting there,&quot; Molly smirked and then wiggled my rising member. <br />
<br />
The pads on her hand and finger tips felt fairly rough, but again her soft fur tickled me a little bit. But looking up at her naked chest, which looked to be very firm on her chest, even without a bra, her brown nipples poking out through her white belly fur was more then enough to help get a &quot;rise&quot; out of me, which seemed to be Molly's goal.<br />
<br />
&quot;We are man and wife,&quot; Molly said in a sultry voice, and began to lower herself onto my erection, &quot;and now we are mates.&quot;<br />
<br />
The feeling of sex was a somewhat odd sensation at first. Part of it reinforced my fear that I would be too small for her, but the other part is that I seemed to hit a &quot;wall&quot; and couldn't get all the way in.<br />
<br />
&quot;What...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hymen,&quot; Molly growled and pushed herself down, &quot;push in...&quot;<br />
<br />
It took a moment. I got my hands back onto Molly's posterior and pulled her down while trying to thrust my own member in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rrrrrrrooooooooorrrrrrrrrr!&quot; Molly gave a small pained roar as I pushed through the hymen.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry,&quot; I said quickly.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's supposed to hurt the first time,&quot; Molly nuzzled my cheek and began to thrust herself down.<br />
<br />
I began to counter her thrusts with thrusts of my own, but at the present time I don't think either of us were getting much out of it. I could feel Molly's vaginal walls gripping my erection, but it was a loose grip. Fearing my human sized penis wasn't enough, I moved my hands to her breasts, slowly and gently messaging them and then running my hands down Molly's stomach.<br />
<br />
&quot;That feels good, George,&quot; Molly moaned slowly as I caught scent.<br />
<br />
I couldn't really identify the scent, and if I had been one hundred percent sober, I would have recognized that I should not be able to catch the scent. But the scent seemed to drive me wild. It was like it did more then anything the sight of Molly's breasts bouncing with each thrust did.<br />
<br />
&quot;You smell good, Molly,&quot; I spoke and then rolled Molly onto her back, and beginning to feel Molly's opening grip my penis somewhat tighter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rrrrrrrrmmmmmm, yes,&quot; Molly moaned as I thrust into her with greater purpose. She closed her eyes and raised her paw like hands up to my shoulders to help her thrusts counter mine.<br />
<br />
As we continued, the pleasure seemed to grow greater with each thrust I made into her, but I was also beginning to feel some other tingles. Some of my skin itched a little in places and I half noticed my human hair falling out, but I was too engrossed in the pleasure of my coupling with Molly to really notice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rrrrrrrrrroooooorrrrrrrrmmmmm,&quot; Molly moaned as my finger nails began to lengthen into curved claws and as reddish-orange fur began to grow on the back of my hands.<br />
<br />
I still didn't really notice, even as I felt a sort of tugging sensation at my ears. As this happened, a lot of the sounds around the cabin seemed to get sharper, louder. I could hear the bed straining slightly under the weight of myself and Molly on it, but my mind didn't register it at the moment. The scent that Molly was giving off drove me on, even as the sound of ripping cloth reached my ears and the bones in my feet throbbed a little, like many of them were getting longer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oooooooorrrrrrrrrmmmmm,&quot; Molly moaned as I was thrusting into her as hard as I could, &quot;you'rrrrrrrrre getting biggerrrrrrrrrrrr.&quot;<br />
<br />
My mind barely registered her &quot;r&quot;s running together as she spoke. I had to be in her. Her scent told me so, even as my eyesight began to get sharper, though I didn't lose the ability to see in color. I could also feel some pulling at the end of my spine.<br />
<br />
&quot;Georrrrrrrrge,&quot; Molly gasped in some surprise that startled me a bit, &quot;oooorrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrmmmmmm!&quot;<br />
<br />
I looked down to her, and she was looking back at me with a great deal of shock in her eyes, though the growing pleasure was messing with her as well. I couldn't understand it to a certian ability. Either I was too drunk, or the sex felt that good, but I didn't quite understand her confusion. Even as the bones in my face snapped and crackled a little and began to push forward into a rather feline muzzle.<br />
<br />
&quot;You'rrrrrrrrrrrrrrre perrrrrrrrrrrrrrfect,&quot; Molly managed, &quot;ooooOOOOORRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRR!&quot;<br />
<br />
My own moan followed her as I felt barbs on my erect member dig into Molly's vaginal walls, &quot;ooooOOORRRRRRRRROOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRR!&quot;<br />
<br />
Somehow, I had transformed into a male tiger, but at the moment... for our wedding night that wasn't on our minds.</p>
