<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer ran to the bathroom yet again to vomit, leaning over the bowl as she retched she wondered why she was so sick. Saxon hearing his mate in distress again came in through the open door padding softly and licked the side of her face. Jennifer smiled at him weakly patting him. She knew she had put on a bit of weight recently and she had had a few weird cravings but she had passed it off as nothing... now though with the vomiting... she sighed before shaking her head there was absolutely NO WAY she was pregnant... especially not from Saxon. Was there?<br />
<br />
Getting up from the toilet bowl still smiling at Saxon she cleaned herself up removing any and all traces of vomit before bending down to kiss him Saxon eagerly pushing his tongue in demanding entrance to her mouth and Jennifer letting him. Since no one was home she quickly stripped down then and there and got on all fours eager for Saxon to mount her again and stuff her pussy fill of his dog cock. She LOVED mating with him and having his huge knot in her, she loved being pumped full of his semen. She also enjoyed giving him a blowjob right after it was just as good as him fucking her. Every chance she got she would strip down to all fours and let him mount her. Wondering if she truly was pregnant with his pups and if it was such a bad thing she didn&#39;t notice the large dog coming closer until he was on top of her and lining himself up with a single hard lunge Saxon once more breached his mate. Jennifer immediately gave a loud cry of pleasure as he started slamming into her.<br />
<br />
Saxon&#39;s heavy panting and grunts as well as Jennifer&#39;s whines and whimpers along with the wet slapping sound signaling every hard lunge Saxon took into his mate&#39;s slick hot tight channel. Jennifer&#39;s  fingers dug into the small carpet beneath her straining as Saxon bounced her smaller body under him.  Jeniger was quite loud this time continously crying out and whimpering desperately with every shove of the animal. The only sounds that were heard in the household were that of two canines mating even though one was only a partial bitch.<br />
<br />
Saxon soon forced his full length into the bitch beneath him and Jennifer screamed in pleasure as Saxon pressed his huge knot between her lips and into the gripping wetness within. In seconds Saxon completed the tie. Jennifer could feel his hairy balls pressed tightly against her stuffed pussy as Saxon humped quickly inside her until his knot was expanded to maximum. The flat head of his cock was pressed snugly against Jennifer’s cervix while the walls of her pussy gripped his shaft like a vice. The sense of fullness was amazing  as she enjoyed the dog fucking her ruthlessly like the bitch she was.<br />
<br />
Saxon&#39;s thrusts were strong as he pulled Jennifer in tight, grinding and humping her until his knot expanded to maximum inside her. Saxonslowed his motions but he didn’t taper off like a normal dog would instead he kept rocking himself, drew out the breeding with soft whimpers from them both. Eventually though, he slowed and came to a stop, resting over Jennifer muzzle resting on her shoulder as the animal panted and unloaded inside her once more Jennifer panting her tounge lolling a bit as she finally came after he had finished unloading inside her.<br />
<br />
Well if she wasn&#39;t pregnant before she sure was now... she truly wouldn&#39;t mind it though these were her pups. Hers and Saxon&#39;s. The girl smiled happily at the thought that soon she would have pups, she would see her belly expand and grow full of life. After a while Saxon&#39;s knot slipped free with a wet squelch and a pop making her whimper at the loss. The dog panting happily licked the side of his Mate&#39;s face to comfort her making the girl smile a bit. With a sigh she got up and cleaned herself off none of her mate&#39;s sperm remained on her as her pussy had eagerly accepted it all but she still reeked of Sex and she couldn&#39;t have her parents find out. It wasn&#39;t right or normal for anyone. Well anyone but her and Saxon. To her and her mate this was perfectly normal and how things should be. <br />
***********************************************<br />
A few weeks later she had quit the cheer team and started wearing looser clothing to hide her growing belly. She wasn&#39;t that large yet but you could still tell something was there if you looked hard enough for she DID indeed look pregnant.<br />
<br />
Kyle smirked as he notched the changes and that she had quit the cheer team. Deciding to approach her he gave her a shit eating grin &quot;How are you enjoying being a pregnant bitch?&quot;<br />
<br />
She growled at him like a dog would as soon as she heard that all the pieces falling into place &quot;It was you! You did this to me you twerp!&quot;<br />
<br />
He laughed &quot;Yes but by the looks of it you&#39;re enjoying it now. You&#39;ve been fucking him regularly from how much of a canine you&#39;re acting like. By the way Transform or Dare Jennifer?&quot;<br />
<br />
Growing again she spat out a single word &quot;Dare.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle smirked &quot;Very well then Jennifer. I Dare you to let your parents catch you fucking your dog and to never use this curse on anyone no matter how tempted you are.&quot;<br />
<br />
She scowled at him and  whirled around storming off trying to stay calm for the sake of the pups inside her. On one hand she adored being fucked by Saxon she loved being his mate. His bitch. She loved the feeling of their pups growing inside her but on the other all this was wrong... it was all because of that stupid transform or dare curse. And now she wouldn&#39;t even be able to use it. Hell her parents would soon find out she was fucking Saxon and that more than anything terrified her. She didn&#39;t want to lose her mate or the father to her pups.<br />
<br />
Rushing home she smiled seeing no one was home and once more stripped down and got on all fours Saxon wasting no time and mounting her immediately. This had become routine for them, neither could get enough of the other. In the middle of their mating neither heard the door open and her parents come in both stood shocked at the scene but thr first part of the curse came into effect thankfully and slightly altered their perception so they would be fine with it.<br />
<br />
Jennifer looked up at them horrified as she spotted them. Her parents sighed her mother being the first to speak &quot;Just Be careful no one else finds out. If you want to be a dog and his bitch you can I&#39;ll get you a collar at the pet store and you are to wear it at all times. No taking it off am I clear? You&#39;re also not to wear any clothing in this house and to only walk on all fours at all times. You&#39;re his bitch now and another dog to us. Your room will be converted to suit your new...needs. especially with the pups coming soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer smiled and was about to speak but instead howled with pleasure as Saxson finally came inside her leaving her panting and her parents to go off and do their own thing.</p>
