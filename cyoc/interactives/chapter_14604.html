<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The passing of time found Tina and her sister nancy being settled down into the pattern of life known to mares. Light work and an occasional ride but it was those yearly meetings when to each found that delight as  they mated.<br />
<br />
All this time the Medallion lay in the pasture. As horse hoofs trampled it and drove the bright bobble of grest powers into the American soil, it too had to wait the test of time.<br />
<br />
Twenty four years passed till as it happens to all Tina died in her sleep. The farmer and her proud owner towed her body out of the stables a rope tied to her hind feet. Out into the open pasture she was dragged and to a waiting hole dug with a backhoe. <br />
<br />
As Kyle used the backhoe to bury his fairest possession as he scraped the dirt and sod over her last resting place there in the sandy soil loomed a bright and shiny object.<br />
<br />
One great possession gone Kyle found now a small silver coin and jumping from the backhoe seat he scraped it into his grasp.<br />
<br />
Then on the ground he stood for a moment his mind going over the fond years he'd owned and had this fine and sweet mare. His thoughts were of those great times as the poorer ones had no passed into the mist of time. His hand grasp the Medallion its power beginning to stir he felt it prickle his hand, this made him look at it, then poked it into a shirt pocket.<br />
<br />
Forgotten in the haste of daily toils Kyle was busy with his life and business. He that night took off the shirt tossing it into the wash hamper and then after a relaxing shower went to bed he and his wife Maruska.<br />
<br />
It was the next day when from her laundry came a racket making her stop the drier and search inside for what was banging around. Her hand pulled out now a well cleaned, washed, and heat dried silver coin of some size and not of American origin.<br />
<br />
At first she toyed with it but the duties of a housewife called and she layed it down.<br />
<br />
4:15pm the school bus rolled to a stop out front the house and Kyle junior ran into the house. A fine strapping young man of fifteen he was a good son the kind everyone wished they had. He was respectful of his parents and elders as also having the wit and sense to stay out of trouble and harm's way.<br />
<br />
Entering the house he headed for the three cookies and glass of milk which were his reward every day he came home from school. A tasty treat before then having to go out to the barn or pastures and help for his parents as they worked the family farm. <br />
<br />
Two hours of chores, then wash up for supper was the norm for Kyle. A helper to wash dishes he then would retire to his bedroom and desk for the homework which needed to bew done. A late time of television and off to bed as did his parents for yet another day to come.<br />
<br />
So it would have been if not for Kyle getting up in the wee hours of the morning, he had a thirst and went to the kitchen for a refreshing drink.<br />
<br />
Apple juice poured into a glass he stood there looking out into the moon light and to the pasture where Tina had been buried. His heart saddened like his father's as to the loss and for having known a wonderous creature that really enjoyed life.<br />
<br />
Setting the glass down his thirst quenched he turned out the light and was on his way back to the bedroom when from an end table loomed a funny silver white glow.<br />
<br />
The Medallion was maybe feeling the life tide of yet another it could trap or curse into a life not wished or wished but not rightly. Kyle picked it up and wondering took it with him to his bedroom. Sleepy he was yet his thrist gone he crawlled back into bed the Medallion on his bedstand.<br />
<br />
The alarm clock was his next thing to hear as it was Friday and the last day of school before the Fall round of teachers meetings. A Saturday, Sunday, Monday and Tuesday off from school there would be chores but lots of free time too.<br />
<br />
All ready for school Kyle gave his room a last good look for anything forgotten. He spied the Medallion and scooped it up he thought to ask Mister Shepperly his science teacher of its origin. Kyle had with this teacher a profound friendship as both had the same interests and hobbies.<br />
<br />
Lunch and Mister Shepperly sat with the teachers at their seperate table. Kyle approached the table showing courtsey and waiting his turn to ask a question. Showing then the Medallion of Mister Shepperly the two walked off together returning to the teachers office and a book on rare coins.<br />
<br />
The lunch hour flew by and try as they might not a coin style could be found of whatever this coin came from. Mister Shepperly asked to keep it and check further and with some reluctance Kyle agreed.<br />
<br />
Mister Shepperly was off the next hour and continued to toy with finding out the origin of the silver coin. It was then that Cassandra came in she a teacher's aide was blonde and totally an airhead. As then she reminded Mister Shepperly of a teacher's meeting that afternoon she saw the bright coin.<br />
<br />
Now at this point what is written can only be surmised as with the next hour's classes Mister Shepperly went to his class and Cassandra came back to find and toy with the Medallion.<br />
<br />
She had while walking the halls during class change did remove improper items from students in accordance to school rules. So with they other items of her pride and joy she looked in on the office of Mister Shepperly. <br />
<br />
Being the blonde airhead she was the thought of stealing the bight bobble was not what ever touched her weak mind. Instead she wanted to look at it as being female the silver luster was tantalizing. <br />
<br />
She plopped down and sat during that class hour rolling the coin over and over tossing it in the air and being just what she was, till!<br />
<br />
Maybe she rubbed her thumb on the coin face, or whatever but she awakened it from slumber since entrapping nancy and Tina both as a mare for life.<br />
<br />
Doctor Jessup the school's physician in matters of sports and the assorted injuries that come along was he himself walking the halls when there came a real comotion. <br />
<br />
Running to meet whatever was making the racket he soon stood at the door to teacher Shepperly's office. Inside he could see a dark form moving around as the frosted windows were meant for privacy they worked to cover Cassandra at that moment.<br />
<br />
Slowly he opened the door and peered inside not knowing what in the world some crazy students might have placed into Mister Shepperly's room.</p>
