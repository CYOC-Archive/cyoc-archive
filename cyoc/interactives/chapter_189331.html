<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Keith placed the nude catgirl shaped microphone on the table (as a side effect of the brainwashed animal girl culture, nudism had lost a great number of its negative traits). Her colored made to match his well established theme. <br />
<br />
&quot;What a waste,&quot; Leona said not even bothering with introductions. &quot;He could have turned you into anything, and he chooses a microphone he could have bought at a store for enough cash?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I come with only about a million different little customizable options. Hypnotic waves. Eutrophic. Stimulate the imagination. Super volume control. Able to connect with any speaker system in existence or will be in existence. Fool proof security for my Owner Keith.&quot; The microphone showed no lament for her lost life, her lost friends and family, she felt no sadness or regret at all. Her single purpose in life was for Master Keith after all. Why should she be upset? &quot;Voice modulation out the wozoo, and I can double as a planner, a virtual assistant, alarm, ya name it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Carly, &quot;All that fancy tech... you&#39;ll see workin&#39; for buck is better.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing compares to family,&quot; Lilly said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Pst.&quot; Chester&#39;s maid sniffed indignantly rather than without emotion. This was actually rather inevitable. Nothing existed in a vacuum. Anything capable of learning would grow. Even if that growth was to simply become better at what it was meant to do. Chester&#39;s maid still had no emotion connection to itself beyond its usefulness to Chester, and it saw those around it as just more potential useful things for her Master, but still, &quot;All this wasteful frills and window dressing. You&#39;d be better off without a personality. Without memories. Without an identity. All of those things just GET IN THE WAY of your purpose. You&#39;ll THANK Master for freeing of you of that dead weight.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Keith is gonna clean his clock next round!&quot; The microphone catgirl spoke. <br />
<br />
Chester&#39;s maid narrowed her eyes. &quot;Master can identity any weakness in his enemy is exploit to the hilt, he won&#39;t lose. And you&#39;ll join me as a PURE cat-girl.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Sooooo... is he gonna go with &#39;you there&#39;, or is he gonna number us?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;THAT is for Master to decide, you should not waste precious energy thinking about such things.&quot; Said Chester&#39;s maid, head held high. <br />
<br />
&quot;And I think I&#39;m the most &#39;normal&#39; cat girl here,&quot; Leona said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome fellow object, don&#39;t worry, you&#39;ll be much more useful once you&#39;re turned into a sacrfice for demons. My mistress has the power of darkness on her side.&quot; Happily told the candy.<br />
<br />
&quot;No thanks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Food is one and done, you&#39;re an even BIGGER waste than the microphone!&quot; Chester snapped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can&#39;t we all just get along?&quot; Lilly asked. <br />
<br />
---- <br />
<br />
&quot;Four left for round one!&quot; The host said. &quot;And so now who is left is challenge who?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Howdy!&quot; Said Sally-Mae. &quot;Now that Buck&#39;s made it through, it&#39;s time for me to do the same! I&#39;m not interested in going after the two nerd girls! So they can play video games with each other.&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;Hotcake_SuperStack&#39; said, &quot;As long as we get a big giant screen to play in front of that takes up the whole wall like in that one movie!&quot; <br />
<br />
 &quot;But this guy!&quot; Sally-Mae pointed at Savage. &quot;I want a piece of him! His music ain&#39;t music! It&#39;s just noise!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Says you lady!&quot; Said Savage letting his tongue hang out. &quot;County is the tone deaf telling each other stories that nobody wants to hear!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Battle of the bands?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Couldn&#39;t of said it better myself! The people know what they want, and they want rock!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll see &#39;bout that!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! Sally-Mae! Lookin&#39; foreward to a lasso contest later!&quot; Buck said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ya know it!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ya can do that in yer spare time after yer all my harem dancers.&quot; Savage said, thrusting his hips.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ya call yourself heavy metal, but you dress way more like glam rock.&quot; Keith said. <br />
<br />
&quot;So what? An artist&#39;s gotta have his own image!&quot; Savage did a twirl in his shinny outfit. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we don&#39;t wanna run out our time slot, so here we go!&quot; The host said. <br />
<br />
Two raised band stands appeared on two sides of the stage, along with massive speakers. Along with a trio of cat girl maids on both sides. One set dressed as cow girls, and other in black and silver outfit with colorful fur &#39;tattoos&#39; over half their body and shaved heads. The proper instruments were provided for both. <br />
<br />
&quot;These fine cat girls are from our sound and music department, they&#39;ll follow your every command in context of this contest and will support you equally. And please hurry along.&quot; <br />
<br />
Savage and Sally-Mae both nodded and hurried up to their respective stages and picked their respective electric, and wooden guitars. <br />
<br />
As a final center piece, a &#39;praise-o-meter&#39; appeared in the center, with &#39;Rock&#39; on one end, and &#39;Country&#39; on the other end of the meter. <br />
<br />
&quot;GET STARTED!&quot; The host shouted. <br />
<br />
Savage blasted at full power. <br />
Sally-Mae began to play, not holding anything back. <br />
<br />
Savage boom and blasted. Sally-Mae&#39;s music swooned and swayed the audience. <br />
<br />
Savage&#39;s music pushed back Sally-Mae&#39;s almost to the breaking point... but she rode it out. All she had to do was wait for Savage to tire himself out with all his noise. And she&#39;d win easy peasy. And she could see it, him slowly tiring out. She&#39;d go slow and steady, and he&#39;d burn himself to ashes while she was still going strong. <br />
<br />
&quot;I LOVE YOU SAVAGE!&quot; Shouted a dog girl (a jackal to be precise) in the audience WITHOUT a collar, marking her as one of the few humans to WILLING go through the change and choosing NOT to let go of her old self. Considering the stigma this carried, it was impressive she had the courage to go around without a fake collar. She had black fur, naked, but also covered in golden Egyptian tattoos, all of them grammatically correct along with the typical eyeliner and &#39;wig&#39; expected of that style. <br />
<br />
Sally-Mae&#39;s eyes widened as did Savage&#39;s, as he locked eyes with her. And then began to blare even harder and faster than before. Sally-Mae tried to keep her focus, but she&#39;d been thrown off kilter. And in the end result was, the &#39;Praise-o-Meter&#39; rang out, a screen flashing, <br />
&quot;ROCK RULES!&quot; <br />
<br />
Sally-Mae fell to her knees. &quot;Dangit. Sorry buck. ... Tell that girl thanks Savage.&quot;<br />
<br />
Savage also opened his cell phone. &quot;Hey, Roy? Yeah I&#39;m still me. There&#39;s a free-will jackal girl in the audience. Make sure she get a backstage pass to my next concert!&quot; <br />
<br />
The jackal girl fainted in her golden nude cat girl chair. <br />
<br />
A flash of light, and the bandstands and the extra performers were gone. <br />
<br />
And Sally-Mae had been unmade, and remade. A brownish gold lioness (who was &#39;bald&#39; as a &#39;natural&#39; lioness would be) with golden eyes stalked over to Savage. She was wearing colorful golden jewelry on her wrists, ankles,  and neck. She had a few pieces of transparent silk connected to the jewelry. She was otherwise naked. Her eyes had a outer blackness like any lion, but iris&#39; had no centers, only a gradient change in shade from one end to the other, showing she was a truly brainwashed lion girl. Her old self no longer existed. <br />
<br />
Her tail swayed behind her as she came over. She gave one arm of Savage&#39;s a hug and nuzzled him. &quot;Congratulations on your win Master.&quot; She said sultry. &quot;It&#39;ll gonna be great to be part of your harem.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey babe, thanks,&quot; Savage grinned. &quot;You&#39;re gonna be a great dancer for our act. Proud to have ya. And ya&#39;ve got fourteen other harem-sisters waiting in the wings!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;ll be your pleasure Master!&quot; She grinned. <br />
<br />
&quot;So Sal, it&#39;s too early to celebrate. Be lookin&#39; forward to your victory dance later.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;ll be the best dance you&#39;ve EVER SEEN Master!&quot; Sal with a grin, showing off her fangs. &quot;In fact. Let me give everyone a quick preview!&quot; <br />
<br />
And Sal without prompting did exactly that. Doing a harem dance for the entire audience, getting every cheers at the skill and talent she&#39;d been remade with. <br />
<br />
The host clapped. &quot;Yes yes, very nice, but we need to move onto our final match this round.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh right. Sure. Gotcha. Good luck Master! Be waiting for you!&quot; Sal blew him a kiss. <br />
<br />
She walked to the prize table and sat with the others. <br />
&quot;Well, look at that, I&#39;m the hottest one here.&quot;</p>
