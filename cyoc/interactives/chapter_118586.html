<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Agent Peters, Detectives Holmes and Smith made their first stop with the docks after getting the information that the poison they&#39;d recovered from the Drake family complex mostly belonging to a highly venomous sea snake. In theory, he could have gotten it from a zoo, as they would often either employ scientists researching the chemical properties of snake venom, usually for medical potential and for antivenom production, but the sheer volume of poison they&#39;d recovered from the trailer at the Drake complex was not conducive to medical experimentation or antivenom production. There was no medical equipment and the venom stored was in large vats that served no other purpose but to hold the venom before it could be used to kill someone. There was simply too much of it for it to have been taken from a zoo or even several zoos. There might be some formal questions asked of some local zoos, but for the moment that wasn&#39;t consideration as there was too much of the venom present for it to have gotten from a zoo. That meant that it had have been acquired directly from snakes in the wild, and that required a boat, which the Drake family did possess.<br />
<br />
The arrival at the docks was to see if the Drake&#39;s boat was present and if Dymixious was there. The Seattle PD detectives, Holmes and Smith thought about calling in some back up in case there was an issue, which was suspected given that this Dymixious was presently thought to be a serial vigilante out killing people who were suspects in other crimes. They weren&#39;t about to take any chances of running into Dymixious and finding him armed and unwilling to be arrested. However, after the shootout with the Rat Pack that had been a part of the arrest of Lionel Ulysses, they didn&#39;t want to raise too much of a ruckus, and since they suspected that Dymixious was operating on his own, such a presence would likely serve to cause more trouble than it solved. They figured two detectives and an FBI agent, all armed, would be able to handle one man.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I help you?&quot; the harbor master spoke as they approached a small shed-like building that was the entrance point to the private docks for the privately owned and other small ships that were supposed to be there. He was seated behind a desk built into the wall and looking through a glass window that was raised enough that one could reach under it to offer papers through.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I&#39;m Agent Peters with the FBI&#39;s Seattle Field Office, these are Detective Homes and Detective Smith with the Seattle Police Department,&quot; Agent Peters answered, &quot;we have a warrant to search the vessel &quot;Dragon&#39;s Horde,&quot; which his registered here as DH1804 and to arrest a Dymixious Drake if found on board.&quot;<br />
<br />
Agent Peters raised her wallet which opened to reveal the identification card with the blue lettering and and her picture. The detectives also held up their own wallets that held their badges and the man serving as harbormaster noticed this and quickly nodded. Agent Peters watched him turn and look into a filing cabinet  and was soon looking through it. They listened to the soft &quot;thp&quot; noise as each page was flipped along while the harbormaster looked for the paper that had the &quot;Dragon&#39;s Horde&#39;s&quot; registry. After a few moments he stopped and turned back to Agent Peters and the detectives.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you need the registration?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not at the moment,&quot; Agent Peters spoke, &quot;the ship&#39;s registry was online... which we uncovered in other parts of our investigation. At the moment, we need where it is presently moored.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... it should be here,&quot; the harbormaster spoke, &quot;I haven&#39;t seen the two guys that normally take it out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Two guys?&quot; Detective Smith asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... both look pretty healthy, like NFL Linebacker healthy, though one is older,&quot; the harbormaster answered, &quot;the younger one has a odd name... Die... Dy...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dymixious,&quot; Agent Peters said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... that,&quot; the harbormaster answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;The other guy was probably his father,&quot; Detective Holmes commented, &quot;Did they describe what they were doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; the harbormaster answered, &quot;I just know that they&#39;d periodically head out, would be gone for a few months and would come back carrying some large barrel full of something.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you said it IS here?&quot; Agent Peters asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; the harbormaster nodded, &quot;Pier B86, shouldn&#39;t be too hard to find.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Agent Peters answered.<br />
<br />
The two then moved around  to make their way down to the piers where the various private boats were moored. They were well kept and well formed with the main part of the sidewalk being concrete and cement with large cylindrical columns that rose up to Agent Peters&#39; knees with a lettered stamp on them to identify the pier grouping. The smaller piers that branched off were wooden, but the wood was well maintained and there were a few boards that looked brighter than the others, which indicated they were boards that were replaced. They could also see small wooden columns where the pier&#39;s had small sections that branched off to allow people to move and walk onto their boats comfortably rather than having to hop over the bow or stern of their boat. Many of them also were also full at the moment.<br />
<br />
Eventually they came to the pier B and made their way up the pier. Eventually they came to an individual pier marked &quot;86.&quot; Tied to the pier was a modest sized yacht with the words &quot;Dragon&#39;s Horde&quot; written in green block letters on its bow. The size of the yacht wasn&#39;t that much of a concern, but they did note that all of its windows were tinted so that they looked to be a solid black color from the outside. It would be impossible to see inside the yacht from the outside and could well mean that if Dymixious was there and wanted to fight, he could easily ambush them. Detectives Smith and Holmes both looked to each other and then to Agent Peters.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll be able to shoot if he&#39;s waiting for us, right?&quot; Detective Holmes asked to Agent Peters.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can be ready in case there is an attempt at a last stand,&quot; Agent Peters nodded, &quot;but I&#39;d think this overall case has had enough shooting. The Rat Pack launched a shootout, got all but Ulysses killed, and in the end he was killed besides. I&#39;d think all of us deserve having someone to answer questions.&quot;<br />
<br />
Detective Holmes and Smith both nodded. Smith moved forward first and then pounded on the door leading to the inside of the yacht and yelled, &quot;Police and FBI, we have a warrant!&quot;<br />
<br />
There was no answer. Granted it was a Saturday morning, but it wasn&#39;t early morning by now, so in theory, if anyone was there, they should be up by now. They waited a few moments before Detective Smith yelled at the door again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dymixious Drake, this is the Seattle PD and the FBI, we have a warrant for your arrest, come out with your hands up or we will come in for you!&quot;<br />
<br />
Again there was no answer. This time, Detective Smith checked the door handle, and found it locked. He then looked back to Detective Holmes and Agent Peters. They both nodded and Detective Smith backed up enough to land as strong a kick to the door near handle. The plastic door bent inward and forcing Detective Smith back. It didn&#39;t open, the door was bent inward a bit. Detective Smith grumbled and then tried again and kicked at the same spot. This time the metal frame broke and the door swung inward. With that, they made their way in.<br />
<br />
&quot;You okay?&quot; Detective Holmes asked to his partner.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll be fine,&quot; Detective Smith answered, &quot;Though I won&#39;t be kicking anymore doors in again any time soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
They ultimately found the boat rather spartan in decor and with no one on it. It was more as if the yacht was a military vessel and not owned by a private citizen. It proved to be frustrating as that there was little in it that would indicate that anyone had been on it recently.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... this was a total failure,&quot; Detective Holmes grumbled as he came into  room that was made to look something like an office.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not a total failure,&quot; Detective Smith commented as he looked a list of paper tacked to a cork-board, &quot;we got a bunch of phone numbers here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Detective Holmes come closer and looked at the paper that Detective Smith was looking at. Sure enough, on it were a list of phone numbers. One was the home phone number/cellphone number that was Dymixious&#39;s own number, which they had found on the online yellow pages earlier in the investigation when trying to find Dymixious&#39;s home address, the others, however, were different.  None of them were numbers that they knew, however. A few had area codes that looked like they were weren&#39;t even US area codes.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure how much this helps...&quot; Detective Holmes commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Some may not help much,&quot; Detective Smith commented, but then pointed to one specific number, &quot;but this number here is a Washington State area code. That might be a number to call. It might be someone who knows Dymixious and thus may have some clues as to where he is now... and who knows, that&#39;s a Washington State number, it might also be a safe house and thus where he is now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So... we&#39;ll have a shot?&quot; Detective Holmes asked to his partner.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Detective Smith answered, &quot;We may need Agent Peters&#39; help, but it&#39;s the only lead we have that could lead us to where this Dymixious might be...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... that&#39;ll give us something,&quot; Detective Holmes sighed, &quot;Rather than a wild goose chase.&quot;</p>
