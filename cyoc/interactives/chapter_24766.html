<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chris’s subconscious mind took over, and he knew what he had to do. Utilizing his newly acquired muscles, he carried his large, unconscious friend over into one of the larger handicap stalls at the far end of the bathroom. Once inside, he propped Jason up so it merely looked as if he had fallen asleep against the wall; although he had to bend his legs a bit to keep the long, hairy limbs or the big feet on the end of them from sticking out under the stall. Now that Jason was inside, Chris closed the door and, being as tall as he was now, reached over it to slide the latch and lock the stall.<br />
<br />
And then he set off, barely noticing the empty locker room.<br />
<br />
Derek had watched from the stands as he saw what he thought must have been the entire team leave. Looking over at the clock on the score board, he realized it had been almost twenty minutes since Chris had disappeared into the locker room. He decided to go and wait by the entrance (that was also the exit) for 10 more minutes until he would just give up on this joy ride, and go home. It was fun while it lasted, he thought, more than a little bitterly, to himself.<br />
<br />
It had been just over five minutes since he’d begun waiting by the locker room, and Derek was seriously considering just leaving. He was turning to go when he heard a deep, yet somewhat-familiar voice, call, <br />
<br />
“Master!” <br />
<br />
Derek spun around to see someone it took him a few seconds to place as Chris McNamara. Standing before him has a very tall, muscular, hairy blond man in the nude. It occurred to Derek somewhere in the back of his mind that it was ironic how he was too shocked and even scared to be turned on.<br />
<br />
“Chris? Is that you?! ” Derek asked, incredulously. “What—”<br />
<br />
“Master, I need you! Please, come with me!” Chris’s tone was insistent, but more than that, Derek noticed that his eyes were pleading and sincere. Derek found himself walking behind the blond giant, having to almost run to keep up with his long, quick strides. In no time, they had reached the bathroom stall and Derek couldn’t help but marvel at Chris’s height as he unlocked the stall.<br />
<br />
Derek entered the stall and found another giant of comparable size to Chris, although with some obvious differences, unconscious and resting against the wall.<br />
<br />
“Master,” Chris began. “Jason has become like me and he needs your help to adjust. Please help him.” Chris, although considerably large and manly, had a child-like fear and sincerity that just seemed to negate all his imposing qualities. Derek’s mind began to race until he heard a voice coming from the locker room. He heard it coming closer and didn’t realize that he was in the doorway of the stall until he saw the football lineman enter the bathroom with his right hand holding a cell phone to his ear. Derek jumped out of the doorway to avoid being seen and nearly fell over one of Jason’s furry legs.<br />
<br />
“No, baby, I won’t be able to tonight. It’s the last day of training camp, and some of us guys are goin’ to celebrate at Wild Joe’s. Sorry, baby but it’s a guys-only thing, you understand, don’t you?”<br />
Derek was beginning to worry. This guy, who was apparently on the football team, didn’t seem to be anywhere near ending his phone call, and Jason was stirring. If Jason was going to make a ruckus, the football player would discover them for sure, and Derek had no idea how to explain anything. Derek looked over at Chris who was staring at Jason who would twitch intermittently. Chris was standing up, straight and tall, and was sure to be seen above the stalls.<br />
<br />
“Chris!” Derek hissed. “Bend down!” Chris complied with a puzzled look on his face. The football player continued his conversation with his girlfriend and was nowhere near using the bathroom for its intended purpose. Derek made a quick decision.<br />
<br />
“Chris,” he whispered. The blond looked at him obediently. “I can’t help Jason if that guy is going to discover us. I want you to...take care of him. So he won’t...tell on us.” Derek now began to wonder if he was indeed dealing with a child that somehow got really big.<br />
Without wavering in voice or gaze, Chris replied, “Yes, master.” Remaining in a crouched position, Chris crept from the stall and toward the unsuspecting guy on the cell phone. Derek just prayed that no one else would wander in.<br />
<br />
“Alright, I’ll—hey!—aw, damn!” he groaned as he look down and picked up each of his feet. “Oh, sorry, baby. I think I stepped in dog shit. I’ll call you back later.” He flipped the phone closed and slipped it into his T-shirt pocket. He picked up his left foot, examining the bottom of the shoe. Chris, in the same crouched position, stalked ever closer, now, less than five feet from his goal.<br />
<br />
“Shit,” the guy said in dismay, and laughed briefly at the word choice. He removed the shoe to reveal his bare foot. Chris’s dick quivered slightly as he closed in on three feet, but it had remained soft. Derek had said bare feet, after all. The guy dropped the soiled shoe, and then began to examine the right shoe. Had he been looking at the mirror in front of him, he would have seen a blond behemoth coming toward him. But alas, dog doo is more engrossing.<br />
<br />
Chris was just closing in on the guy when he pulled off his right shoe. Chris’s dick immediately reared up, rock hard, and jabbed the guy in the back as it unleashed yet another load all over him. The jizz had been propelled up the guy's back all the way to his head where it then began to slide down his front, sufficiently covering him in the warm, sticky liquid.<br />
<br />
“WHAT THE—” but the strange sensations that began in his body stilled his voice. Chris watched what came next as he had watched Jason. In fact, he expected the guy to look just as Jason did, but that wasn’t going to happen, not quite. <br />
<br />
The sensations began in the guy’s feet, something he had no reaction for. It was a mixture of warmth, pain, pleasure, and who knew what else. He glanced down and realized without question that his feet were now too big for his shoes. The sensation didn’t stay there. He next felt it in his groin, and it was now more pleasure than anything. Soon, he felt very tight in his boxers, but he couldn’t quite see over his gut. That was when he looked up and noticed the mirror. He could see his crotch was now bulging through, not only his boxers, but his athletic shorts, too. Suddenly he noticed something in the mirror. Actually, it was someone, and it was behind him. He turned quickly to face Chris, who stood, slowly, to his full height.<br />
<br />
Chris was now able to see the changes progress. The guy had feet that nearly matched his own in size, and an obscene bulge in his shorts. In a few moments, Chris also noticed the guy getting taller. He was about to Chris’s chin, when the muscle growth set in. Chris almost couldn’t believe it when he noticed the muscles steadily increasing. Before the growth had started, the muscles had already been the size of Jason’s, and yet they continued to bulge larger and greater, surpassing even Chris’s in bulk. Something that went along with the muscle growth was the increase in the size of the gut the guy had, too. Chris watched as it swelled and ballooned, larger and larger, but always becoming rounder and more firm than it had been a moment ago. <br />
<br />
As all this growth progressed, the clothes had been getting tighter and tighter, until they couldn’t take it any more. The T-shirt had rode up his inflating belly, and then been ripped to shreds as his back became wider, and his chest became fuller. The cell phone had popped out of the pocket at some point and skittered across the floor into a urinal. It was when the football player was almost the same height as Chris that the final change commenced. The guy had been naturally hairy, but that had been nothing compared to what he would become. His face now had a full beard and that trailed down his thick neck to his chest that was covered in a thick pelt of hair that also covered the entire surface of the spherical stomach. His crotch was a bush that almost completely obscured his dick. Almost. His legs were thick tree trunks covered in hair all the way down to his feet and even his toes.<br />
<br />
The man stood there in shock, no longer seeing Chris, who eyed him warily, uncertain of what was about to happen. After a few moments, Chris realized that this guy wasn’t going to move on his own, and so moved slowly to help him along, back to the waiting Derek and the unconscious Jason.</p>
