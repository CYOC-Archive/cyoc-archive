<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Trisha and Amber each thought they must have broken speed laws, if not speed records, getting to Trisha&#39;s apartment.<br />
<br />
Trisha didn&#39;t expect this would work out so well.  Amber didn&#39;t know exactly where this was going to wind up but this thing didn&#39;t only add horse tails to a body...it couldn&#39;t...could it?...and she was already thinking of how she and Trisha were going to figure out the sex part of it...that tail felt amazing, but what a bitch to drive sitting on it!<br />
<br />
Trisha fumbled through her keys for the ones to her building, Amber quickly right behind her.  They went in, and Trisha had the key to her apartment door ready when she reached it at the end of the first floor corridor.  She was never so grateful for so short a walk as she was today, trembling with excitement, and seeing the same tremble in Amber.  <br />
<br />
The door opened, the girls walked in, then closed the door behind them.  Shades and full curtains were already closed, covering any windows, and the cool, refreshing air conditioning was running still when they entered.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you want to do first?&quot; asked Trisha.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is real, isn&#39;t it?&quot; responded Amber.  &quot;Part of me just wants the feel of your hands on my tail again.  Another...wants all of you.  Another...wants to see what that remote can really do.  I haven&#39;t been this excited since I was little.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds like any of those options probably involves stripping.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.  I&#39;ve never.  I mean.  With a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you mean what you said at the beach?  About, you know,&quot; started Trisha.<br />
<br />
&quot;Every word.  And can&#39;t deny the evidence of my eyes.  Or my sense of touch.  So, what do we do?&quot;<br />
<br />
Two sexy, bi-curious virgins alone in an apartment left so many options, but Trisha remembered what Amber said.  &quot;Ok, let&#39;s start with you.  Maybe I can give you exactly what you said on the beach.  And then it&#39;ll be my turn, and we&#39;ll try out the changes.  Does that work for you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess.  Let&#39;s do it.  I don&#39;t think either of us knows what we&#39;re getting into yet.  And I&#39;ve already got a tail.  I&#39;d be a little disappointed if I had it and nothing else happened,&quot; Amber responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, let&#39;s do what you wanted on the beach.  We&#39;ll make it so we can ride each other.&quot;  With that, Tricia took out the remove, slid off the screen cover, and pushed at the screen.  Moving up from the ...Tail>Centaur screen, back up to ...Body Parts>Tail, then ...Female>Body Parts, then Gender>Female.  Hmmm...Gender was at the top.  What was it Amber said?  Ride each other?  But Trisha was somehow decided she was attracted to how Amber looked as a woman.  That was ok, wasn&#39;t it?  The lists on this thing were pretty comprehensive.  She went back down first, and found what she wanted, as she&#39;d guessed.  ...Body Parts>Sex Organs.  ...Sex Organs>Multiple.  She kept at it, found what she was after, pointed at Amber and pressed.  In the same way Amber&#39;s tail grew in when she was asleep, this time she saw as a human-looking penis grew in just within her pussy lips, above her clitoris.  Human for color and texture, but something more than thirty inches long by the time it fully came in a minute later, it turns out the device figures this is what a centaur&#39;s penis should look like, just like a centaur&#39;s tail had hair that looked more human.<br />
<br />
This time, the transformation was an experience for Amber.  &quot;Oh.  Oh!  This is...I don&#39;t even know how to describe it.  You really want me to ride you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If we&#39;re going to do this, let&#39;s do all of it.  I hope you like it, because I&#39;m figuring the rest of this out.  That&#39;s just the start.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, don&#39;t forget to do you, too, while you&#39;re at it.  If we&#39;re both doing this.  Should be as easy as just pushing that button again while it&#39;s pointed at you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry.  I was staring.  No, I was starting to have sex with you with my eyes.  I totally forgot me.&quot;  With that, Tricia decided to strip.  A moment later, she was standing naked in the middle of her apartment.  &quot;Before I go further, I can give you a hand.&quot;  She walked forward to Amber, reached out, and took her long, slender penis in her hands.  Walking closer, she lifted it, but it between her breasts, squeezed them together, then put the mouth briefly around its tip.  &quot;Should I?&quot;  She felt Amber&#39;s penis get a little harder, then give a twitch.<br />
<br />
It took Amber a moment, with Tricia&#39;s tongue licking a slow circle around the tip of her new penis.  &quot;This is so good!  But, I remember what I said on the beach, and I can&#39;t wait to see what you&#39;re going to come up with.  You seem to have the hang of that thing already.  Let&#39;s get to the end, then enjoy it all the way.&quot;  Amber took her new endowment in her hands, carefully backing away from Tricia, trying hard not to get herself too much more excited, but failing.  She felt her new, sensitive penis, just like the tail, and it was intensely stimulating.<br />
<br />
Tricia stepped back and pointed the device at herself now.  Her reaction seemed much stronger than Amber&#39;s, as her own penis grew in, it was immediately hard, and was quickly a little longer and a lot straighter than Amber&#39;s semi-flaccid rod.  &quot;Oh god!  What&#39;s it doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Seems she&#39;s excited and wants to come out to play.  Are you ok?  Do you need me to help you before you go on?&quot;  Tricia looked back at Amber almost desperately, intensely excited, not really knowing what to do.  Amber, a little more aggressive, supplied her own follow-up.<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve just added dicks to our bodies.  You&#39;re not going to get much more intimate than that anyway.  Here, let me.  You keep going with the device, and I&#39;ll help for a minute while you do.  Sooner or later we were going to need to do something anyway.&quot;  She stepped forward, this time taking Trisha&#39;s cock between her breasts, hands on its shaft, tip in her mouth, and sucked slowly.<br />
<br />
Trisha hadn&#39;t had a chance to adjust.  This sensitive new appendage had a life of its own, and even more than Amber she was just along for the ride.  She started to moan in deep enjoyment.  In less than a minute, she felt more new sensations, &quot;somethings happening, it&#39;s just, I don&#39;t know.&quot;  That was all the warning Amber needed, as instinct seemed to take over, and she took a flow from Trisha right into her mouth and simply kept swallowing.  &quot;Oh, wow.  What else can I say?  I just kept getting excited, and felt a pressure inside, and I didn&#39;t think about stopping myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s ok.  I think we just had our first sex act.  You tasted terrific, too.  I didn&#39;t know what to expect, but I liked it a lot.&quot;  She just stepped a little closer and hugged Trisha, their new appendages caught between them.  The hug felt wonderful, but after a minute, Amber looked at Trisha, &quot;maybe you should keep going again?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If it&#39;s going to get much better than this, I&#39;m not sure I can take it.  But, yeah.  I think you&#39;re right.  And I think I figured something out.  The buttons use the last setting in the category, so if I point at myself with the Tail button, I should get my version of the one you got.&quot;  She reached the device again, pointed at herself, and had a tail with hair very much like the long hair on her head, perhaps just a little longer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooh.  I was right.  I was expecting you to look even more sexy with a tail.  I like it!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I think I figured out a shortcut.  When I was at one of the top level menus, you can see other pulldowns and buttons.  There&#39;s this one, &#39;Full Species Change,&#39; and instead of one part at a time, I&#39;m betting on it getting us finished faster.  Let me try.&quot;  She found what she was looking for again, pointed at Amber, and was suddenly staring at a magnificent centaur mare...human female up top, an equine look with a twist below...with that long penis showing excitement, bobbing up and down hitting her in her equine chest, over and over, and a human-looking pussy from the outside that was just far deeper than human and still hiding for now under her tail.  The change was almost instantaneous this time, and Amber stumbled for a moment before adjusting to a new set of impulses and center of gravity.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, I brought you to an orgasm a minute ago.  I think this is the finished product.  And I need it, too.  Really need it.  So,&quot; Amber started.<br />
<br />
Trisha looked her over and interrupted, &quot; No need to even ask me once, that is so awesome to see.&quot;  She turned the device around, pointed at herself, pressed the same button, and changed.  Just as Amber had.  &quot;You said something about a ride?  Don&#39;t just stand there, cover me!&quot;  With that, Trisha turned around, flipped up her tail, and made it as easy as she could figure for Amber to go for a long ride in the middle of her apartment.</p>
