<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next morning, Kevin woke up with a lazy yawn, he looked at the clock and saw that it was 6:30 in the morning a few hours before the store opened. He noticed that the room seemed brighter than it usually was for an early morning, and it was mid autumn, the sun wouldn&#39;t be up until 8 at least. He dismissed this strange change of lighting as coincidence and proceeded to bring one of his hands to his face and lick it absentmindedly with his tounge, which grew wide and flat over night, longer too, but her did not notice.<br />
<br />
must....clean.... mmmmmm is that steak sauce I taste? Kevin realized at that moment he was licking his hand. He immediately sputtered and spat then rubbed his hand on his fur. surprised he looked down to see that he slept in his costume. What did he do last night? The last thing he remembered, he was snuggling with Auron on the couch. He needed to get to work though. Sighing, almost regretfully, Kevin got up and took off the costume, folding it neatly on his bed and placing the head, gloves, and feet on his desk counter. He felt naked without the costume for some reason, like he needed to wear it to be himself. Shaking away the strange thoughts, he put on his uniform and prepared to leave for the morning. He was pulling on some pants when he noticed that his belt was missing. He looked everywhere for it, but time was running out. He suddenly got the idea to wear the belt from his costume, the belt with the tail attached. He reasoned with himself that he shouldn&#39;t take such a thing to the work place, but he felt compelled to wear that tail, so he did. Halloween was less than a week away, he might as well start wearing bits of his costume now. In fact, it felt kind of kinky. With that embarrassing thought in mind, he felt his dick swell in his pants, embarrassed, he quickly ate some breakfast, which tasted bland to his new taste buds, and hurried off to work, hiding the tail inside of his long trench coat while he was in public.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, back at the house, Auron slowly woke up, letting out a loud yawn, stretching himself along the couch. He had a good rest last night. The costume kept him especially warm. But now he had to get ready for class. As he put away the costume, he did notice that there were some smells he hadn&#39;t smelt before. Something musky and pungent but smelt wonderful. Even more strange was as he brushed his teeth, he noticed two things. First, his muscular build had somehow seemed to have shrunken in stature. Second, he thought his lips seemed bigger, especially the upper. Did he get stung by a bee or something. That would explain why they&#39;d turned so dark red, as if he&#39;d just put on makeup. Brushing his slightly sharper looking teeth, he had some more of that steak from last night and then headed off to class.<br />
<br />
As he walked down the street, what went on with him and Kevin was in his mind. What happened back there? It got so weird that night. But there was no time for that, Professor Marv was teaching physics that day.<br />
<br />
Work for Kevin was interesting that day. He stayed in the back and focused on inventorying the stores supplies and watching over the employees, always wearing his jacket to hide his tail. He felt energized, rejuvenated evn, and felt like he could enjoy work rather than focus on his troubles. It was strange, the feeling of the tail bouncing along behind him on its spring felt wonderful, it felt like he had a counterbalance on life that allowed him to think of the good things that were happening. After all he was getting paid, he lived with a good friend and lived in a nice cozy place away from prying eyes, what more could he want? Perhaps a companion to share the bed with? He shook his head and said under his breath, &quot;One step at a time my friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
He found that he also felt stronger as he lifted crates of game shipments to help out the other staff in the back. His diet must have been doing something for him lately. At lunch, he ate a nice steak sandwich at the local bar savoring every meaty taste. He purred and licked his lips then his fingers with his lengthened rough tongue absentmindedly. He did not notice however, that his lips became darker by several shades and thinner as well starting to feel like another texture altogether.<br />
<br />
The rest of the work day was agonizing for Kevin. He couldn&#39;t stop thinking of the costume. He wanted to put it on, wear the gloves and the boots and revel in the touch of the fur of the costume. He wanted to be different, he wanted an excuse to be lazy and lounge around the apartment. Strangely he wanted to wear his costume with Auron and snuggle with him again.</p>
