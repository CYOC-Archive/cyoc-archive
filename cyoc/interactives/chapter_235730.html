<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Matt’s hands hovered over the keyboard as he scrolled through the options one last time, his breath catching when he saw it: “Eastern European Porn Star.”<br />
<br />
His heart raced. It felt taboo, exhilarating—exactly the kind of wild fantasy he&#39;d been craving for so long. Before he could overthink it, he clicked on the selection and hit the “Apply” button.<br />
<br />
The room around him began to blur, and his body felt warm, tingly, as though electricity was running through his veins. His vision faded for a moment, and when he opened his eyes, he wasn’t in his familiar bedroom anymore.<br />
<br />
He was in a sleek, modern apartment, sunlight pouring through large windows overlooking a picturesque city skyline. The unfamiliar surroundings made his pulse race faster—he wasn’t in his home, or even in his own body.<br />
<br />
Matt stumbled toward the reflection in the mirror near the window, his bare feet padding across cool wooden floors. His breath caught in his throat when he saw the reflection. The man staring back at him was... stunning.<br />
<br />
His new body was tall, at least 6&#39;3&quot;, with rippling, muscular definition that made his old slim frame feel like a distant memory. His skin was lightly tanned, his arms thick with veins, and his abs cut like they were sculpted from stone. A square jawline, sharp cheekbones, and striking blue eyes framed his face, his hair a short, messy blonde that only added to his rugged, masculine appeal.<br />
<br />
He let out a breathless laugh, flexing in the mirror as he traced his hands over his new, bulging pecs. His muscles felt firm, powerful, and with every movement, he was aware of the weight and strength of this body—a porn star’s body.<br />
<br />
A rush of arousal surged through him, his cock—thick and hard—straining beneath the tight-fitting underwear that hugged his sculpted hips. He was massive in every sense of the word.<br />
<br />
“Holy shit,” he muttered, hearing a deep, accented voice that was distinctly not his own. It was smooth, confident, and unmistakably Eastern European.<br />
<br />
Looking around, Matt noticed the apartment had an air of luxury, like it belonged to someone important. There were posters of himself—well, this body—plastered on the walls, and the titles were in Latvian. It dawned on him: he was in Latvia, and this wasn’t just any body. This was a famous porn star’s life he had stepped into.<br />
<br />
His phone buzzed on the kitchen counter, and instinctively, he grabbed it. A message flashed across the screen in Latvian. Despite never knowing the language, Matt’s mind somehow translated the words:<br />
<br />
“Ready for the shoot? Meet us in an hour at the studio.”<br />
<br />
His heart raced. He was really about to live this out.<br />
<br />
Matt stared at the phone in his hand, the message replaying in his mind. He couldn’t believe it. He was scheduled for a porn shoot—in this muscular, chiseled, Eastern European porn star’s body. His nerves buzzed with excitement and a touch of fear. What if he messed it up? What if he couldn’t act like the man whose skin he now wore?<br />
<br />
But then again, wasn’t that the thrill? He had always fantasized about transformation, about becoming someone else entirely. Now, here he was, standing in Latvia in a muscular, sexy porn star’s body, with all the confidence and allure that came with it.<br />
<br />
He glanced back at the mirror, his breath catching as he flexed his new muscles again. His pecs bounced as he squeezed them together, the sheer size and strength intoxicating. His thick, veiny arms felt alien yet thrilling to move. Even the way his abs tightened as he breathed in deeply felt powerful. He couldn&#39;t stop touching his chest, his abs, his thighs—every part of him felt surreal, like a living fantasy.<br />
<br />
Matt looked down at the underwear barely containing his new, impressive cock. He let out a low whistle, smirking at how different he looked—and felt. He had never imagined being this hung, let alone with a body like this. The sheer size of his package made him feel dominant, desirable. He imagined what it would be like when he got to the shoot, how everyone would look at him, admire him.<br />
<br />
But first, he needed to get ready. He rummaged through the apartment’s wardrobe, pulling out some sleek designer clothes. The closet was filled with tight shirts, leather jackets, and fitted jeans—clothes that screamed confidence and sexuality. He threw on a pair of black jeans that hugged his thighs and a tight white tank top that showed off his massive biceps and shoulders. He caught himself flexing in the mirror again, marveling at how perfectly the clothes fit.<br />
<br />
After taking a deep breath, he grabbed a pair of shades and headed out the door, his pulse quickening with every step.<br />
<br />
As he stepped out into the city, Matt felt the cool breeze on his skin and the warm sun kissing his shoulders. People on the street stared at him, some sneaking glances, others outright gawking. A few women smiled flirtatiously, and some men shot him envious looks. It was as if he was an instant celebrity—and maybe in this body, he was.<br />
<br />
Walking through the streets of Riga, Latvia, he was struck by how different everything felt. The architecture was a beautiful mix of modern glass buildings and old-world charm, and the streets buzzed with life. He didn’t recognize a single face, but he felt like he belonged here. People seemed to know him, nodding or waving as he passed. He gave a casual nod back, trying to play it cool.<br />
<br />
After a short walk, Matt found himself standing in front of the address listed in the message. It was a sleek, modern studio building with large windows. His heart pounded as he entered, but he forced himself to walk confidently inside. He was greeted by a stunning receptionist who smiled warmly at him.<br />
<br />
“Good to see you again,” she said in Latvian, and once again, his brain instantly translated the words. “The crew is ready for you. Go ahead and head to the changing room.”<br />
<br />
Matt’s pulse raced. He gave her a smile, trying to act like this was totally normal. “Thanks,” he said, his new voice deep and smooth.<br />
<br />
The receptionist pointed him down a hallway, and Matt made his way toward the changing room. As he walked, he caught glimpses of cameras, lights, and crew members setting up for the shoot. A few people nodded at him as he passed, some murmuring about how great he looked.<br />
<br />
When he entered the changing room, he was alone. The space was sleek and professional, with a large vanity mirror and a rack of clothes on one side. Matt stood in front of the mirror, pulling off his tank top and admiring his reflection again. His body was flawless—sculpted muscles, perfect tan skin, and not a single flaw in sight. He flexed his arms, watching the veins pop as he tightened his biceps.<br />
<br />
His cock twitched again in his jeans, and he couldn’t resist pulling them off. Standing there in nothing but his briefs, he admired the thick, hard bulge that strained against the fabric. He had never felt so sexual, so powerful.<br />
<br />
Just as he was getting lost in the sight of himself, the door opened. A tall man walked in, another porn star by the looks of him—also muscular, with dark hair and a square jaw. He smiled as he entered, giving Matt a knowing look.<br />
<br />
“You ready for the shoot, man?” the guy asked in Latvian, but again, Matt understood every word perfectly.<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Matt replied, his voice confident, even though inside he was still a bundle of nerves. But he wasn’t just Matt right now. He was someone else. He was a porn star. A fantasy made real.<br />
<br />
The other man gave a smirk, then nodded toward the set. “Let’s do this.”<br />
<br />
Matt followed him out into the studio, where bright lights and cameras were set up, casting everything in a warm, glowing light. The director greeted him with a pat on the back and began giving instructions. Matt listened, his pulse pounding in his ears, but the body he was in seemed to know exactly how to move, how to stand. His muscles flexed naturally, and he felt like a star, confident and powerful.<br />
<br />
As they prepared for the scene, Matt couldn’t believe this was happening. He had chosen to become an Eastern European porn star, and now he was about to live that fantasy to the fullest. His cock strained in his briefs as he waited for the cameras to roll, and he couldn’t help but think about what this experience would feel like once the shoot started.<br />
The bright lights felt warm on Matt’s skin as he stood under them, his muscular body gleaming. The studio was set up to resemble a luxurious, sunlit apartment, complete with plush couches, modern decor, and large windows that let in the golden glow of the afternoon. It felt almost surreal—he had watched plenty of these scenes online, and now he was about to star in one.<br />
<br />
The director, a tall, lean man with slicked-back hair, approached Matt and the other actor. He smiled, his eyes scanning Matt’s body with approval.<br />
<br />
“Alright, boys, let’s make it good,” he said in a thick accent, motioning to the cameras. “Just be natural, have fun. You know the routine.”<br />
<br />
Matt nodded, his heart racing but his body moving on autopilot. The transformation had not only given him this incredible physique but also a natural ease in this world. His previous anxieties faded, replaced by a growing sense of anticipation. The other actor, now standing beside him, smiled and casually placed a hand on Matt’s shoulder.<br />
<br />
“Relax,” he said with a grin, his deep, accented voice carrying a sense of confidence. “We’re gonna have some fun.”<br />
<br />
Matt took a deep breath, feeling the electric charge of excitement pulsing through him. The cameras clicked on, capturing every movement. His mind buzzed with disbelief. He was really doing this—a Bel Ami-type shoot, a polished, sensual display of male beauty. It was everything he&#39;d fantasized about for years, but now it was real.<br />
<br />
The director gave a small nod, signaling for them to start. Matt instinctively leaned into his role, feeling the tension and attraction building between them. The other actor, whose name he now knew was Dmitri, stepped closer, their bodies inches apart. Dmitri&#39;s hand traced the contours of Matt’s chest, the touch sending a shiver down Matt&#39;s spine.<br />
<br />
The chemistry between them was immediate, the atmosphere charged with desire as Dmitri’s fingers slid over Matt’s sculpted abs. The feeling of another man’s hands on his new body was intoxicating. It wasn’t just lust; it was the thrill of being desired, of knowing that he was now one of those perfectly sculpted men people craved to watch.<br />
<br />
Dmitri leaned in, his breath hot against Matt’s neck as he whispered, “You look perfect.”<br />
<br />
Matt’s heart raced, and without thinking, he leaned in for a kiss. Their lips met, and Matt was consumed by the sensation—the warmth, the taste, the raw sexual energy between them. Dmitri’s hand traveled lower, brushing over the waistband of Matt’s briefs, teasing the growing bulge beneath.<br />
<br />
The cameras zoomed in, capturing the intensity of the moment. Dmitri peeled off Matt’s tight briefs, revealing his rock-hard cock. Matt’s new body responded instantly, his cock throbbing with desire as it was freed from the fabric.<br />
<br />
Dmitri smirked, looking down at Matt’s impressive size. “Damn, you’re bigger than I expected,” he teased, his hand wrapping around Matt’s shaft, slowly stroking him. The cameras captured every second, focusing on the way Matt’s body tensed with pleasure.<br />
<br />
Matt moaned softly, his mind clouded with lust as he gave in completely to the moment. He had never felt anything like this before—the sheer intensity of it all, the pleasure amplified by his new body’s heightened senses. His cock felt huge, more sensitive than ever, and Dmitri’s skilled touch made him tremble with anticipation.<br />
<br />
Dmitri wasted no time in dropping to his knees, his eyes never leaving Matt’s as he leaned forward and took Matt’s cock into his mouth. The sensation was overwhelming—Matt’s head fell back, his fingers tangling in Dmitri’s hair as he let out a groan of pure ecstasy.<br />
<br />
The cameras panned around them, catching every angle as Dmitri worked his mouth up and down Matt’s shaft, his tongue swirling around the head. The combination of the studio lights, the attention of the crew, and Dmitri’s expert blowjob had Matt’s pulse racing. He was living the ultimate porn star fantasy—strong, desirable, and in total control of this new, powerful body.<br />
<br />
Dmitri pulled off with a grin, standing up and guiding Matt toward the plush couch in the center of the set. Matt’s body moved instinctively, the muscles in his legs flexing as he followed Dmitri’s lead. They both settled onto the couch, their bodies pressed together, heat radiating between them.<br />
<br />
The director murmured quiet instructions to the camera crew as they adjusted their angles, making sure to capture the sensual closeness between the two men. Matt’s cock throbbed as Dmitri climbed on top of him, grinding their hips together in a slow, teasing rhythm.<br />
<br />
Dmitri leaned down, whispering in Matt’s ear, “Ready for the real fun?”<br />
<br />
Matt nodded, biting his lip as the other man guided his cock inside him. The sensation of being inside Dmitri was overwhelming—tight, hot, and impossibly pleasurable. He had never felt anything like it before. His hips bucked instinctively, thrusting deeper as Dmitri moaned softly, their bodies moving in perfect rhythm.<br />
<br />
The cameras zoomed in, capturing every flex of Matt’s muscles, every thrust of his powerful hips. His cock plunged deeper into Dmitri with every movement, and Matt felt a rush of adrenaline as the intensity built. His abs tensed, his pecs flexed, and every inch of his body glistened under the studio lights as he fucked Dmitri with all the force and confidence of the porn star he had become.<br />
<br />
It felt so good, so right. The pleasure coursed through his veins, and he could feel the pressure building, the moment approaching where he wouldn’t be able to hold back any longer. Dmitri moaned louder, his hands gripping Matt’s shoulders as their movements became faster, more urgent.<br />
<br />
Finally, Matt couldn’t take it anymore. With one last powerful thrust, he felt himself explode, waves of pleasure crashing over him as he filled Dmitri. His entire body tensed, every muscle on display for the cameras as he rode out the intense orgasm, groaning deeply with satisfaction.<br />
<br />
As the scene ended, Matt collapsed back onto the couch, breathless, his chest heaving as he tried to catch his breath. Dmitri slid off him, smirking as he wiped sweat from his brow.<br />
<br />
“Not bad for a newbie,” Dmitri said, giving Matt a playful wink.<br />
<br />
Matt grinned, still buzzing with the high of it all. He had just lived out one of the wildest, most erotic fantasies he had ever imagined—and it wasn’t over yet. <br />
<br />
Matt barely had time to catch his breath from the first shoot before a studio assistant approached him, clipboard in hand, with a smile that was equal parts professional and knowing.<br />
<br />
“Next up, muscle worship with the twins,” she said, glancing down at the schedule. “You good to go?”<br />
<br />
Matt blinked. Twins? He felt a surge of excitement pulse through him. He nodded confidently, despite the flutter of nerves in his chest. “Yeah, I’m ready.”<br />
<br />
As he followed her down the hall toward the next set, he mentally prepared himself. This wasn’t just another sex scene—he’d have to step into the role of Markuss Balode, the Latvian porn star whose body he now occupied. He needed to sound convincing, act the part, and dominate like he’d been doing it for years.<br />
<br />
The next set was a luxurious, all-white studio with velvet couches and large mirrors, creating an almost ethereal atmosphere. Soft lighting enhanced every muscle, every curve. In the middle of the room stood two slim, young men who could only be the twins. They were both about 5&#39;8&quot;, with identical lithe, toned bodies and delicate, handsome features—high cheekbones, narrow chins, and shaggy blond hair. They were unmistakably Latvian, their bright blue eyes gleaming with a mixture of excitement and nervous energy.<br />
<br />
As Matt stepped onto the set, both twins turned to greet him. The assistant handed him a bottle of water and a towel, which he took as the director approached.<br />
<br />
“Alright, Markuss,” the director said with a grin. “This scene’s all about muscle worship. The twins are supposed to be in awe of your body. You talk for a bit, get to know each other, and then let things heat up. We’ll roll into domination at the end—sound good?”<br />
<br />
Matt nodded, wiping the sweat from his chest. “Sounds good,” he said, hoping his accented Latvian was convincing enough.<br />
<br />
The director clapped his hands. “Alright, let’s get started.”<br />
<br />
The cameras whirred to life as Matt stepped closer to the twins, forcing himself to exude the cocky, dominant energy of a porn star who had done this a thousand times before. He flashed a charming smile, placing a hand on each of their shoulders, feeling how small they were next to his massive frame.<br />
<br />
“So,” Matt began, his voice deep and accented as he channeled Markuss, “let’s introduce ourselves for the audience.” He flexed subtly as he spoke, watching as both twins stared up at him in awe, their eyes roving over his massive chest, his thick biceps, and his tight abs.<br />
<br />
The twin on the left smiled first. “I’m Kaspar,” he said, his voice soft and shy, his gaze lingering on Matt’s pecs. He looked identical to his brother but had a slightly more playful gleam in his eyes.<br />
<br />
“And I’m Kristaps,” said the twin on the right. He was just as slim and fit as his brother, though he seemed a bit more reserved, biting his lip as he stared up at Matt’s hulking form.<br />
<br />
Matt smirked, crossing his arms over his chest, the muscles bulging under his skin. “Well, I’m Markuss Balode,” he said, trying his best to sound as natural as possible, “and I hear you boys want to see what real muscles look like, yeah?”<br />
<br />
Both twins nodded eagerly, their eyes wide with anticipation. The cameras zoomed in, capturing the tension as Matt raised his arms and flexed, his biceps swelling to impressive size. Kaspar let out a quiet gasp, reaching out hesitantly to touch Matt’s arm, his fingers tracing the hard lines of muscle.<br />
<br />
“So big…” Kaspar whispered, his hand sliding down Matt’s arm to his chest, where he gently pressed against the solid wall of muscle. Kristaps followed his brother’s lead, placing his hand on Matt’s abs, his touch timid at first but growing bolder as he explored the tight ridges of Matt’s stomach.<br />
<br />
Matt let them worship him, a cocky grin spreading across his face as their hands roamed over his body. “You like that, huh?” he teased, flexing harder, making his pecs bounce. Both twins looked mesmerized, their hands moving faster now, eager to feel every inch of his powerful frame.<br />
<br />
“I work hard for this body,” Matt continued, his voice dripping with confidence. “You boys ever seen anything like this before?” He bounced his pecs again, and both twins let out breathy laughs, clearly aroused.<br />
<br />
“No,” Kristaps admitted, his voice breathless as his hands slid down to Matt’s thick thighs. “You’re… perfect.”<br />
<br />
Kaspar leaned in closer, pressing his cheek against Matt’s chest as he ran his hands down Matt’s sides. “We’ve never touched anyone like you before,” he said, his voice a mixture of awe and lust.<br />
<br />
Matt couldn’t help but feel a surge of power. He was in total control, and the twins were completely captivated by him. He could see their cocks tenting their tight shorts, their excitement growing with every touch. He chuckled, running his hand through Kaspar’s blond hair, pulling the twin closer so his face was practically buried in Matt’s chest.<br />
<br />
“You boys ready to see what these muscles can do?” Matt asked, his voice low and commanding. Both twins nodded eagerly, their hands trembling with anticipation.<br />
<br />
“Then let’s get these clothes off,” Matt said, pulling Kaspar’s shirt up and over his head in one smooth motion. Kristaps followed suit, quickly stripping off his own shirt. Their slim, toned bodies were revealed, their skin pale compared to Matt’s tanned, muscular frame. They looked up at him with hungry eyes, ready to worship him in every sense of the word.<br />
<br />
Matt stood over them, towering and dominant, his massive chest heaving as he looked down at the twins kneeling before him. He flexed again, this time more intensely, and both twins moaned softly as they ran their hands up his thighs, their eyes glued to the bulging muscles straining against the thin fabric of his briefs.<br />
<br />
The director gave a subtle nod, signaling for the scene to escalate. Matt grabbed Kaspar by the chin, tilting his head up to meet his gaze. “You like what you see?” he asked, his voice rougher now, more authoritative.<br />
<br />
Kaspar nodded eagerly. “Yes, sir.”<br />
<br />
“Good,” Matt growled, pushing him back onto the couch. Kristaps was next, Matt guiding him down until both twins were kneeling on the floor in front of him, their faces level with the bulge in his briefs. He tugged the waistband down, his cock springing free, thick and heavy, and both twins gasped in unison.<br />
<br />
“Worship it,” Matt commanded, his voice dark and dominant. “Show me how much you want it.”<br />
<br />
Without hesitation, the twins moved in, their hands and mouths eager to please. Kaspar took Matt’s cock into his mouth, sucking with desperate hunger, while Kristaps kissed and licked Matt’s abs, his tongue tracing the ridges of muscle. Matt groaned, grabbing Kaspar by the back of the head, guiding him deeper as he watched Kristaps work his way down to his thighs, worshiping every inch of his body.<br />
<br />
Matt’s dominance took over completely as he thrust his hips forward, fucking Kaspar’s mouth with slow, deliberate movements. His other hand grabbed Kristaps by the hair, pulling him closer, making him kiss and lick along Matt’s thick, veiny cock. The feeling of being in complete control, of having these two beautiful twins at his mercy, sent a rush of adrenaline through him.<br />
<br />
He switched their positions, pushing Kaspar back onto the couch and pulling Kristaps up to take his brother’s place. The twins obeyed without question, their lustful eyes wide with submission. Matt grinned, savoring the power as he thrust deep into Kristaps’s mouth, his cock throbbing with each movement.<br />
<br />
The cameras captured every moment—the raw power of Matt’s muscular frame, the way he dominated the twins with effortless control, the twins’ eager, worshipful expressions as they did everything he commanded.<br />
<br />
Finally, Matt could feel himself getting close. He pulled both twins back up, pushing them onto the couch and positioning himself over them. “You boys ready to be dominated?” he growled, his voice low and dangerous.<br />
<br />
“Yes, sir,” they moaned in unison, their eyes filled with anticipation.<br />
<br />
With one last powerful thrust, Matt came, groaning as he coated both twins with his cum. The twins moaned, trembling beneath him as they worshiped his powerful body, their hands still running over his abs and pecs, even as the scene reached its climax.<br />
<br />
The director called, “Cut,” but Matt barely heard him. He was too lost in the moment, still feeling the rush of dominance, the thrill of having completely controlled the scene. As the lights dimmed and the cameras powered down, Matt collapsed onto the couch between the twins, breathless and triumphant.</p>
