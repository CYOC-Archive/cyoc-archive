<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You watch out the window as you get to what appears to be a tall cobblestone wall. &quot;Huh, didn&#39;t expect this to be such a private place.&quot; You comment, but the driver just shrugs. <br />
<br />
&quot;Its walled off for a reason. This is the limit of the effect zone. Anything beyond theis set of double walls will be effected unless given a series of special serum injections 2 days prior to entering. I get them regularly since I make numerous trips here, but you have not gotten a single one correct?&quot;<br />
<br />
You nod at the question. If what the driver says is true, then that means that the company is fully aware of the effects of the town of New Jenda, and are more than happy to accommodate you through whatever change you will be going through. Well, your new job came with an extremely generous pay raise, and honestly the extra zero made the offer too hard to refuse. A rumor you heard before you left work on your last day was that the future head of the company would also be moving to the town as well. <br />
<br />
The one thing you were still a bit hung up over, was that you will not be able to see your secret office love for quite a long time. You have been secretly dating the daughter of the owner, Jessica, for the past 8 months. Normally, this is a huge no-no for the office protocols, but you just couldn&#39;t resist, and neither could she. So durring work hours, you both would be extremely cold with each other, so as to not raise suspicions. But after hours, when just the two of you would be left, things often turned quite warm between you two. And while you two never actually had sex, making out in the branch manager&#39;s office (her office) was not a rarity. <br />
<br />
Not seeing her for quite a long time was really bumming you out. And if it wasn&#39;t for her especially pushing for you to take up the new position, you would likely have rejected the offer. You likely could try maintaining a long distance relationship though. That at least helped you keep it all together enough to not draw extra attention to your secret romance. <br />
<br />
The new position would keep you tied down here for at minimum 18 months, durring which, you were forbidden from leaving the town. According to the driver, due to the nature of the transformation, if you were to leave midway through, it could have severe consequences. Things such as growth defects, improperly formed organs, etc... not something you would ever want to risk having. This was why your pay raise was so lucrative though. Tough it out for 18 months and then live in luxury for the rest of your life. Plus it isn&#39;t like you will be alone. If that rumor is true, then someone big from the company will be here too, and if you can get on their good side, then you will be set for life.<br />
<br />
The car pulls up to a quite nice looking house, ut was just shy of being a mansion in your opinion. Definitely out of your tax bracket at least. But since the company is footing the bill, you aren&#39;t complaining.<br />
<br />
You exit the car and walk inside the door after being told that the movers will handle all the luggage and moving your items. It is just as fancy on the interior as it looks from outside. Well, at least your living space is going to be quite nice. It was then that you heard a very familiar voice from the second floor. <br />
<br />
&quot;I see you arrived just fine. So, ready to spend the next 18 months together?&quot; Said Jessica as she walked down the stairs. The chauffeur stepped out of the room leaving you two alone. <br />
<br />
&quot;What? How, why are you?&quot; You start to ask in disbelief until Jessica silences you. <br />
<br />
&quot;What? You didn&#39;t think I could become the new owner and not have my most trusted secretary come along with me did you? Or perhaps maybe I just didn&#39;t feel like having a long term relationship. Honestly either work as an excuse, so just pick whichever one pleases you most. Oh, and has anyone told you yet about the special trait of this town?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I... no, not yet. All I have heard is that it turns you into something.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you are mostly correct. This town changes everyone similarly, yet differently. Everyone will change the same way, but their final outcome, and if anything extra happens, is completely unique to the individual.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see... so, what will we be turning into to? I can&#39;t imagine it being so crazy that it would impede our ability to work right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm hmm, your right about that. We won&#39;t be inconvenienced enough to not work, but maybe you will, every couple of weeks or so&quot; teased Jessica with a playful grin. You were quite use to her teasing, as you have learned that it is a very obvious sign that she is very excited and happy. But you also were getting impatient too. <br />
<br />
&quot;Can&#39;t you just say it already?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine, if you won&#39;t guess, I will tell you. We are going to turn into our opposite gender! Isn&#39;t it exciting? I will become a very attractive man, and you will become my sexy lady. This will be so much fun! I can&#39;t wait to shove my cock between your tits, or fuck you over my desk, or have you give me a blowjob. And you are going to love getting pleasured by me too, since as a former woman, I will know all the right tricks.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jessica was for some reason extremely happy to go through with this. But hearing that you were to become a woman left you quite shocked. However, you snapped out of it when Jessica whispered into your ear. <br />
<br />
&quot;You know, once we undergo this, I also plan on making you my official wife, if you are interested. Just something to think about, because I am going to go through with this whether you are willing to as well or not.&quot;<br />
<br />
You look outside just in time to notice the U-haul truck speeding away, followed by the company car. You sigh, understanding that you will be committing to this and nod. You love Jessica more than enough to go through with this, even if she had beaten you to the proposal.</p>
