<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">First thing&#39;s first, everyone seemed to already have a drink on hand. After poking around the fart house a bit, Mark was able to find a refreshment table set up towards the back. A pair of zombie frat brothers were still trying to get the keg set up, but there were more than enough cans of beer to go around.<br />
<br />
Mark bent down to one of the many coolers, digging through the ice to see what brands of beer the house had bought. He was vaguely aware of someone wolf whistling across the room, but he didn&#39;t realize who it was directed at until he heard someone shout, &quot;Shake that ass goatman!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark immediately grabbed a beer at random and stood back up.<br />
<br />
He knew he was going out on a bit of a limb showing up shirtless. It fit the outfit though, and the costume was cheaper for it. Still, he hadn&#39;t quite appreciated how err, tight the leggings were? There was fur on his rear sure, but this was probably a little more revealing than he was going for.<br />
<br />
He cracked open the beer, trying to put those thoughts at the back of his mind. He&#39;d relax once he had a beer in him. He&#39;d just have to make sure not to spill anything on his pants.<br />
<br />
Sure enough, his anxiousness started to recede as the pale ale washed over him. It was a nice crisp brew, and-<br />
<br />
&quot;Gah!&quot; Mark yelped, leaning back as some of the beer dribbled down his chin. He needed to be more careful! Clearly someone had just dumped all of the cans haphazardly into the cooler.<br />
<br />
He reached up, rubbing his chin with his bare arm. He didn&#39;t have any sleeves to wipe the beer away with, but he hadn&#39;t spilled that... much...<br />
<br />
Mark blinked, reaching up and rubbing his chin with his fingers. The beer was almost completely gone, but his chin was... scruffy? He had a hard time growing a five o&#39; clock shadow, let alone any facial hair. Somehow though, his chin seemed to be sporting quite a few hairs. He rubbed his fingers together, giving it a curious tug. Youch! It was long enough where he could actually pinch it! He needed to find a mirror-<br />
<br />
&quot;How are you doing that with your tail?&quot; a voice spoke up from behind Mark.<br />
<br />
He quickly spun around, his hooves clopping loudly on the frat house floor. An upperclassman named Chase was staring down at his legs, trying to get a better look. <br />
<br />
&quot;Doing what...?&quot; Mark tried to look over his shoulder, &quot;Oh, I think there&#39;s a wire in them or something?&quot; He couldn&#39;t get a good look at the costume&#39;s tail, but he could feel a surprising amount of movement back there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it looks great.&quot; Chase grinned, &quot;You look pretty great actually. Did you go to that costume shop?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark blinked, &quot;Err, yeah. They had a pretty big selection.&quot; Did... did Chase just make a pass at him? &quot;This isn&#39;t too over the top, is it? I feel like it should have included a loin cloth or shirt or something.&quot; He scanned the room, &quot;Actually, do you know remember where we&#39;ve got that mirror hung up?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chase made a halfhearted effort of looking around the room, &quot;Nope.&quot; He immediately started looking back down at Mark again. &quot;But I&#39;ve got one back in my dorm room?&quot; he offered suggestively.<br />
<br />
Mark felt his face go red. &quot;I uh... I think it&#39;s over by the fireplace.&quot; He laughed nervously, &quot;Maybe some other time?&quot; He quickly started to clop across the room. Did... did that seriously just happen? Did Chase even swing that way!?<br />
<br />
Mark&#39;s hooves kept echoing throughout the room as he clopped loudly on the frat house&#39;s floor. It wasn&#39;t just his imagination this time, he was getting quite a few looks as he crossed the room. Mark wasn&#39;t used to this sort of attention, and was starting to feel a little exposed. Almost naked even. He finally found the room&#39;s mirror though. It was an ostentatious old thing, and gave him a good view from his shoulders up.<br />
<br />
He could hardly recognize what he was seeing. His face was looking back at him, but it was somehow more... wild? His already messy hair was completely disheveled, and creeped down past his neck. The extra mess of hair completely covered the plastic headband on the horns, making them look like they were coming out of his head. Even the sides of his hair had grown out, making the scruffy goat ears poking out of the side of his head look completely natural.<br />
<br />
Most striking of all though was the goatee. Mark had a long tuff of brown hair on his chin. He could easily run his fingers through it, coaxing it into a distinct curl.<br />
<br />
&quot;How on Earth did I grow a uh...&quot; Mark took his eyes off his goatee and looked back up at his face. He thought he saw a flicker of movement and err, the headband hadn&#39;t had goat ears on it, had it?<br />
<br />
He quickly reached up, running his hands through his hair. He... he needed to get out of this costume. Mark rubbed his scalp, trying to figure out where the headband was. His fingers continued to just brush up against his dense hair. The horns wouldn&#39;t budge when he bumped them, and even tugging on the scruffy ears didn&#39;t do anything other than send a jolt of pain onto the side of his head.<br />
<br />
Mark&#39;s goat ears flickered against his hands as he let go. He stared in bewilderment at the apparent beast-man in the mirror. What was going on in this frat house tonight...!?</p>
