<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I just wish things weren&#39;t so weird between the two of us anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Granted,&quot; Gaz muttered beneath his breath.<br />
<br />
As Ryan and Gaz continued their conversation about Carter, Ryan was oblivious to the changes occurring in the next room over.<br />
From the bathroom, Carter was standing over the sink throwing some water over face, desperately trying to calm the throbbing coming from his boxers. But as a wave of energy washed over him, it almost felt like the throbbing was getting even stronger. Carter untied the robe and pulled down his underwear to at least let himself breath. Leaned up against the wall, he stood there wondering what was going on.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, recently, before all this, I started going to the gym. I always told him that if he came with me, he could wind up looking really attractive. I mean the kid has potential.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Ryan&#39;s words left his mouth, Carter started to feel a tingling all over his body. His skin suddenly started feeling incredibly sensitive, but strangely enough in a pleasurable way. Even so, the robe was too much, and he dropped it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you imagine Carter posing on the beach. Massive python looking biceps...&quot;<br />
<br />
Carter felt the tingling concentrate in his arms. As he looked down, he watched as his muscles begin ballooning larger and larger. Flexing his right arm a little, he saw the bicep tightening and shifting from underneath, the veins starting to pop into view as they become more toned. He looked across the bathroom at the mirror and stared at the odd view of his regular body with massive, disproportionate arms attached.<br />
<br />
&quot;A pair of mountainous pecs and set of washboard abs you could almost literally clean clothes on...&quot;<br />
<br />
The feeling in his arms moved up his shoulders and down throughout his torso. His normally flat front slowly started expanding outwards, mostly concentrated in his chest. He held his fledgling pecs in his hands as they pumped forward, almost as if someone had a tire pump attached to them. As they grew, he squeezed them and noticed that they were squishier than he thought pecs would be. As Carter played with his chest, he didn&#39;t realize his abs were defining themselves two by two down towards his waist. Between the groping and pleasure from his erection, Carter was beginning to lose himself in pleasure.<br />
<br />
&quot;Plus, even with his height, he would look amazing if he had some bulging calves and sturdy thighs, you know, ones you could probably pop a watermelon between...&quot;<br />
<br />
The pleasure eventually continued moving downwards towards his legs. Not being as distracted by his pecs, Carter&#39;s gaze followed the tingling sensations. Strangely enough, as he was looking down, he felt a slight sense of vertigo as the floor seemed to be getting further away from him. As he regained his balance, he looked over to the mirror and saw that that he was indeed taller than before. Additionally, he got to watch this time from a third person perspective as the muscles in his thighs and calves started thickening with muscle, like two tree trunks attached to his hips.<br />
<br />
&quot;And who doesn&#39;t like a nice ass on a man...&quot;<br />
<br />
In watching his legs, Carter was caught off guard and let out a loud moan as all the pleasure concentrated completely around his ass. Being that he was leaning against the bathroom wall, he could feel his body pushing away from it as he grew two bulbous globes of muscular ass.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just wish sometimes he was a bit more mature, you know? He acts like a kid in high school sometimes when the both of us are adults at this point...&quot;<br />
<br />
This time, the tingling spread throughout his entire body once again. Although, instead of pleasure, it started to feel itchy. Carter began scratch at himself, but no matter what he did, it wouldn&#39;t go away. After a few moments, he started to feel something weird underneath his hands when he went to scratch certain areas. He could feel something on his face, his chest. He looked into the mirror and saw that he was starting to grow hair all over his body, and in the places where he already had hair, it began getting thicker.<br />
<br />
Carter watched as hair began to grow in the middle of his pecs, spreading out, fanning over the rest of his chest. At the same time, he saw as the treasure trail he had began to thicken and spread out over his stomach, crawling upward until it met with the growing thatch of hair on his chest. The hair growing on his face came in a little patchy at first, only really growing on his chin, upper lip, but as with the rest of his body, the hair started getting thicker and spread out across his cheeks and jaw until he was sporting a proper beard, much like the one Mr. Desmond had. Looking down, he saw the body hair on his arms and legs was much thicker than he was used to, and as he rubbed the rough hair across his thighs, Carter noticed that even his pert ass had a slight dusting of hair on it as well.<br />
<br />
As the hair seems to slow in its sprouting, he took the time to take in how much has actually grown. Carter ran his hands across the dense covering of hair on his strong pecs, something he coincidentally imagined himself doing to Ryan not too long ago. Carter found it interesting to look at himself in the mirror, but upon closer inspection of his face, he noticed the hair growth wasn&#39;t the only change. He noticed there were a lot more lines and creased on his face around his eyes and mouth. Plus, up close, he could see some gray hairs starting to come through in his beard and in the hair around his temples. He realized he didn&#39;t just get hairier. He got older. As old as Mr. Desmond even.<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean, that&#39;s why I asked him to live with me, help with his get on his feet, build confidence and stuff, plus he&#39;s so hot...&quot;<br />
<br />
The sensations stopped meandering around his body and once again localized, this time in his head. The thought of him being older was maybe something concerning in the long run, but that was just a part of getting older in general. That&#39;s why he was happy to have a friend like Ryan who could be there for him. He was feeling a lot more confident in himself again. It didn&#39;t matter that he was in his 30s if he had good friends like these around him. Carter just wished Ryan wouldn&#39;t try and hide it when he checked him out.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s why started fooling around. Both of us just couldn&#39;t keep our hands off each other for too long...&quot;<br />
<br />
At least, that was how Carter felt at first. He knew that Ryan wouldn&#39;t have been able to last a week or two without doing something. The sexual tension was always there. Plus, both of them had mind-blowing orgasms whenever they were with each other. They always joked with each other about how it was like they were made for each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;A year ago I asked him to marry me. I can show you some wedding pics. That reminds me of that first night, God it was so good. Still is...&quot;<br />
<br />
Carter stood in the bathroom basking in the memories of their wedding. When they met at the end of the aisle, their first dance with each. All of their family and friends cheering them on. His mom bawling her eyes out as they drove away later that night. And to top it off, they made love to each other the entire night, or at least until both of them were sore enough to stop. Carter smiled as he thought about the man he loved, and the life they built together. But especially right now, he was thinking of the Ryan waiting in their bed. At this point, Carter was so horny he was nearly ready to blow, but he knew it&#39;d be worth it if he could hold out a little longer. He walked up to the sink and splashed some cold water on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s why he went to the bathroom, to get ready. Should be out any moment now.&quot;<br />
<br />
As soon as Ryan finished speaking, a nude Carter burst through the door with his hard dick out in front of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll leave you two be,&quot; Gaz said. But he was lying. He watched from the chair in the corner as Carter walked hastily towards Ryan, grabbing him by the face as the two of them passionately made out.<br />
<br />
Carter sat on Ryan&#39;s lap and began to quickly pull his shirt off, which was soon followed by his pants. At this moment, it was clear to see both of them were excited and as they threw themselves further back onto the bed, the two of them, still in the throes of kissing, began jerking the other one off.<br />
<br />
For the next hour or so, Ryan and Carter took turns giving each other blowjobs, topping each other, and putting themselves in every position imaginable. That was until they both had the other&#39;s members in their mouth and simultaneously blew their loads down the other&#39;s throats. They both eagerly swallowed the cum, but whatever was leftover or landed around their mouths was shared between them as they kissed each other, lying there cuddling with their strong, hairy bodies.<br />
<br />
Ryan broke the kiss to say, &quot;Wow, something must&#39;ve gotten into you tonight. It&#39;s almost like this was our first time again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryan and Carter soon fell asleep in each other&#39;s arms, enjoying their first night in marriage.</p>
