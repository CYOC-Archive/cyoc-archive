<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When we finally got back up, our appetites were ravenous again, and the three of us slipped into robes and gathered in the kitchen. Meg and I sat at the table while Veronica whipped us up some steak fajitas-heavy on the meat.<br />
<br />
Our repeated three ways had only strengthened the bond, and we shared the intimate glances that only lovers share as Veronica cooked. Even though we&#39;d had a two hour marathon of sex, the undercurrent of lust was still strong in the air, and I found myself almost eager to have the women again, despite the fact that any normal person would have been almost exhausted.<br />
<br />
Veronica joined us, serving us up large plates heaped with the mexican comfort food and large glasses of red wine, lovingly stroking our hands before raising her glass in a toast. “To my mate and to my packmate..” she said softly, “may we never be apart, and may our fortunes never turn sour.” We smiled and clinked glasses, before exchanging kisses all around.<br />
<br />
The first few minutes were spent in a gorging silence, with the only noise being our gulping of the food and drink, but as the immediate hunger pangs were subdued, conversation resumed.<br />
<br />
“So, my loves..” Veronica said, “What of the meeting tonight? We&#39;ve got about two hours until then, but we need to discuss what to do.”<br />
<br />
“Meeting?” Meg asked, doing that same precious head-cocking motion that had proven charming earlier in the day.<br />
<br />
“Last night shortly before you met us..there was a bit of an orgy at the club. Everyone in the club, from patron to dancer cast off their human guises and Joe asserted himself as alpha over them all after a rut,”<br />
Veronica deftly explained.<br />
<br />
“I commanded them to go bite someone and bring them back tonight,” I added. “And they listened, so there should be quite a turnout.”<br />
<br />
“A turnout of  rather unpredictable proportions,” Veronica corrected.<br />
<br />
“Oh?” Meg asked.<br />
<br />
Veronica nodded. “You see...while he and I are accepted as dominant..the rest of the werewolves were not our true pack. As such, they listed to Joe based on his dominance, and due to post sexual euphoria. They don&#39;t share the pack bond with us the way that you do, and they never will. As such, they&#39;re not obligated to listen to him or myself tonight, or any other night. The ones that they turned will be subordinate to THEIR wishes, not ours. In effect, Joe spawned the start of 25-30 new packs, all around our size, and half of them haven&#39;t had their first change yet. Things could get...tense.”<br />
<br />
I knew what she was saying was true, and I didn&#39;t think to wish it away. I knew consciously that I COULD do it..but something inside me wouldn&#39;t let it happen. This was natural. I was a werewolf, and this was OUR law. I realized that the wish to be a werewolf had unintended consequences, as I couldn&#39;t make a wish that the werewolf side of me found to be unnatural. Indeed, I found a moment later that I couldn&#39;t even visualize a world where other werewolves were automatically subservient to me. Our world was one of strength and dominance. While Veronica and I had tools to enforce our vision that others didn&#39;t, I realized that I couldn&#39;t rewrite the rules of the werewolf reality that had asserted itself.<br />
<br />
“And it&#39;s just us three..against ALL of them?” Meg asked. Her eyes narrowed and she let out a soft growl. “Then let them come. They might win, but we&#39;ll show them we won&#39;t roll over without a fight.”<br />
Her nails grew, and she dragged them unconsciously across the tabletop as her anger fueled a reflexive transformation. I could feel my own change getting ready to start as I grew aroused at her beast emerging again, before Veronica interrupted us with a quiet smile.<br />
<br />
“Easy, pup..” she said, reaching out to nuzzle Meg&#39;s twitching hand as she brought it to her cheek and kissed the popping digits. Meg exhaled, immediately calm and her humanity reasserted itself in a few seconds. “We&#39;re not alone. While the dancers and staff may not be pack, they&#39;re friends, and they&#39;re loyal. It&#39;s some of the patrons that might not be so ready to accept our word as law, and the newly-turned ones are going to be unpredictable. Some of them are going to love the idea, others will be convinced, and still others will rebel. It&#39;s unavoidable. But we&#39;re not alone, and odds are that we&#39;ll have the numbers. Plus, there&#39;s every chance that we won&#39;t have a physical confrontation yet anyway, even if they all rebelled.”<br />
<br />
Meg nodded thoughtfully and looked rather relieved. “Good,” she said, “No need to weaken our numbers so soon.”<br />
<br />
“Exactly,” I replied. “The full moon&#39;s still a few days away, and I want every one of us intact for our push on this city.”<br />
<br />
“Do tell,” Meg said excitedly.<br />
<br />
“I&#39;ll explain more at the meeting tonight,” I told her. “I&#39;m still working out details  in my head, as far as how my exact plan is going to work.”<br />
<br />
Veronica gave me a sideways glance. “I hope you plan to tell both of us. We ARE your pack, after all.”<br />
<br />
I nodded. She was absolutely right. “I will. I&#39;m just trying to get it straight first, love.”<br />
<br />
Meg cleared her throat quietly. “Umm..just in case things go..badly, it wouldn&#39;t hurt to have another loyal member, would it? You know...just to have another wolf at our back?”<br />
<br />
“Oohh..someone&#39;s feeling fangxious!” Veronica teased.<br />
<br />
“Fangxious?” Meg replied sarcastically. “Seriously?”<br />
<br />
Veronica nodded earnestly. “Yes. Fangxious. Someone you REALLY want to bite when you think about them.”<br />
<br />
Meg blushed. “Uhh..yeah, I guess so..”<br />
<br />
“Someone you already can picture changing when you think about them..” Veronica teased.<br />
<br />
Meg blushed harder. “Y..yes...”  Her eyes faded slightly, and the soft snaps and pops of a change starting punctuated the silence.<br />
<br />
“Someone you want to fuck while your bodies shift and the animal courses through your veins?” Veronica said, her own teeth starting to grow as Meg moaned and slid a hand under the table to touch herself. The scent of musk was filling the air, and as much as I wanted to give in, I had to pull us all back to humanity for the time being.<br />
<br />
“LADIES!” I said loudly, startling them into a reversion again. I smiled once things had calmed. “So..you have someone in mind then?”<br />
<br />
Meg blushed hard and nodded.<br />
<br />
“Tell us about them,” I said. I was genuinely curious now, and because she was a pack member, I felt obligated to listen to her suggestion.<br />
<br />
“Well..umm..it&#39;s..” Meg began.</p>
