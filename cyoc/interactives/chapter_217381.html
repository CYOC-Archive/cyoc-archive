<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It all began at a summer camp for fortunate and athletic boys and girls in Germany. One of the rules was to have received the anti-shrinking virus vaccine. Sure it’s not 100% efficient, but it’s rare that kids for rich families got shrunk. But, there are always exceptions, and one of those happened to Hans and Klaus, adorable blond hairs and blue eyes 10 years old twin boys. Because they won several medals for swimming, a good man sponsored their acceptance to the camp.<br />
<br />
During almost half of the duration of the summer camp, everything went very nicely for everyone.  But in the middle of June, a twist of fate happened for the adorable twin boys. They were with other boys their age at one of the tables in the refectory when they suddenly began to shrink down. They did their best not to fall from the large bench several other boys were seated on. As they got smaller and smaller, they found them-self inside their way too large shorts and underwear. Because of the reaction of the kids at that table, everyone else in the refectory became very quiet, having a serious clue of just happened.<br />
<br />
Hans and Klaus knew that their life, as they knew it, was about to dramatically change. On a few occasions, they have played with shrunken boys and teens before, having fun seeing how quickly they had erections as soon they were hand-held. That always made them giggle. But suddenly, one by one, they were fished out from their giant clothes because they became 6 inches-tall living toys.<br />
<br />
It was the summer camp manager and his assistant who recovered the shrunken kids. For that point, it’s their responsibility to make sure the new tiny guys will be used properly. The manager is Karl, 40 years old, married with two kids, one annoying girl sulking all the time, and a very smart son who is his pride.  His assistant is a nerdy teen boy names Peter, 16 years old, very talkative but a good worker and loyal.<br />
<br />
As they carried the shrunken twins to the camp’s main office, they caressed them, kissing their tiny heads now and then. The boys loved being handheld, it was so comforting and warm. As they were inside the office, Karl laid the tiny guy he was holding, Hans, on a soft foam rubber surface and told Peter to lay Klaus next to him. Seating at the desk, they both looked down at those perfect athletic naked shrunken boys.<br />
<br />
(Karl) Now, Peter, you have to check out if their bodies react the right way.<br />
<br />
(Peter) Understood! He said with a nice smile.<br />
<br />
He gently began to stroke the tiny boys&#39; legs he spread just wide enough. He probed their tiny abdominal muscles, also their pectorals. The boys were very relaxed and trusting. Both Karl and Peter were staring at the tiny twins&#39; genitals which became erect after a while. With gentle touches and stroking, the boys moaned a lot.<br />
<br />
(Karl) Good, so they are fit for duty then!<br />
<br />
As the camp’s protocol regarding shrunken kids and teens obligates,  they sent a message to the other kids’ parents informing them that there is/are shrunken boys available for a reasonable extra fee. So parents can buy some renting time for their kids may spend it with the shrunken boys. Because they are twins, they have to be used together, not separately.<br />
<br />
It was not long before they has been flooded with requests. So they tried to sort them by arrival orders. <br />
<br />
The first one was from a dad who has his 14 years old son in the camp. He heard from the boy that he has a girlfriend who’d be willing to have her first-time sex with him, but only if a shrunken boy is there because she finds it more arousing.  His request has been granted, but with double fees because not only one person will use the shrunken kids, but two. Anyway, it was the teen boy&#39;s first-time sexual relationship with a girl.<br />
<br />
The teen has been told by the assistant, Peter, that a private shack will be provided. Yeah, they have lots of money, and there are many privileges provided, no questions asked. So on time, he was there, awaiting for his girlfriend to show up. On the dresser desk was a tiny cage where the two 6 inches tall, 10 years old, athletic blond twin boys were seated, legs crossed and already naked.<br />
<br />
Then, the girl arrived. She has not knocked on the door, she just stepped inside. She was older than the teen as she was 17 actually. The tiny twins stood up to see her better. She have noticed and exclaimed “OH GOSH THEY ARE SO ADORABLE!”  The teen boy was very aroused, his brain switched to the “off” position, well sort of. He walked to the tiny cage and opened the tiny door. He picked up Hans first he handed to the girl, he than picked up Klaus.<br />
<br />
(Girl) Lets find out how they taste like, shall we? <br />
<br />
Se she began to lick Hans tiny naked body from toes to face. The teen boy imitated her doing the same with Klaus.<br />
<br />
(Teen boy) Mmm, he tastes very nice actually, I did not expect that!<br />
<br />
So he shove half the toy boy’s body, feet first in his mouth and sucked on him to really savour him.  Klaus was like heaven, he loved it and moaned. Seeing that, the girl did the same with  Hans who also adored the experience. As they were sucking on those kids, they got naked and laid on the bed. Laying on her back, she spitted Hans and orders him to hump on her left nipple. The teen boy did the same and put him on the right nipple. The twins are very into their task. <br />
<br />
Then the girl has a very odd idea, she asked the teen boy to lie on his back, so he did without asking any questions. She put the shrunken twins next to that huge erect dick which was thick and uncut 8 inches. She wanted to see what they might do in that situation. The tiny kids were very impressed, that thing was bigger than them. They were so excited, they teamed up to grab it from each side and pump it up and down to pleasure the giant teen. They succeed as the teen was moaning. Then the girl removed them and stuffed them between her boobs.<br />
<br />
(Girl) Fuck me good not boy!<br />
<br />
So the teen has his first-time sex... but he was so aroused, he ejaculates a few minutes after.. it was obvious it was about to happen anyway.  Then the girls remove the twins, then she left.<br />
<br />
As it was the rule, the teen had to wash the tiny twins before he brought them back to the office.<br />
<br />
The second request was for Elena, 15 years old. She was able to afford to have the tiny boys because her mom paid for them. Here need was more like a fashion thing though. She just wanted to were a transparent bikini but with the tiny twin boys hiding her tits with their tiny bodies. Well, they caressed it a lot though.<br />
<br />
The last one before the end of summer who got them was Tommy, a shy closet gay 12 years old boy. His parents do not know about his preference, so it’s an uncle of his who paid for his time with the shrunken twin boys. Yeah, he is the only one who knows. As the tiny guys are always horny, they don&#39;t care so much about who they are with.<br />
<br />
Tommy was alone in the dorm when the tiny twins has been brought to him. The other kids were at their activities. He was very happy to see them, so he held them in both of his hands for a while. Laying on his bed, he made the tiny boys snuggle against his both cheeks. He loved to got those tiny caresses and kisses, he felt very special. Grabbing them again, he licked their tiny dicks, one after the other, which get hard very fast. <br />
<br />
The boy was in the mood to have a walk so he shoved both kids in front of his underwear before he left. All along, he felt them hugging and caressing his erect penis. However, it was very hot outside, so Tommy sweated a lot, and his underwear was damp. So, concerned about the tiny twin boys, he came back to the camp and took a shower with them.<br />
<br />
Well his time was up, so he had to bring them back to the office...</p>
