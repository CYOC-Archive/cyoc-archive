<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Chloe very much wanted to make certain that her former Master met his dues for the manner of his treatment towards her, she was aware (thanks to her increased intellect) that she didn’t have the best grasp on her new power (thanks to the Ring-now-Bracelet) just yet.  Before she could make her retributive move on him, she first needed to be able to properly wield this Power she held.  <br />
<br />
Fortunately for Chloe, she had not one, but two subjects on hand to test on right now.  Herself and Ana, which offered her the chance to test several elements at once.  The transformation power she already knew could be done, but controlling the pace and extent she still needed practice with.  Another critical part that she needed to gain experience with included awareness, to make sure that only select subjects could know about it, and on her whim.  <br />
<br />
Thinking hard about the words to use, Chloe spoke.  “I Wish, that I was, seated, next to the woman driving the, car(?) in front of me.  That she isn’t surprised by my being there in, any form, I’m in, that to her, it’s completely, normal.  And thinks, nothing of it.”  <br />
<br />
A moment later, and her entire field of view became an unfocused blur, fading as fast as it came with Chloe now seated to the right of Ana, who looked at her a moment before turning her eyes back to the road ahead.  So far Chloe’s plan was working she noted with a smile on her human face, she was now next to this human, and her appearing there, without clothes, and hoofed feet didn’t faze her in the least.  <br />
<br />
“You know, you might want to put on that seatbelt.”  Ana spoke to her casually, like she would to anyone travelling with her.  <br />
<br />
Which confused Chloe for an instant before she worked out that it meant the strap next to her with the metal bit that slotted into the plastic part on the other side, pulling in on her, but not uncomfortably so.  “Sorry, forgot about it.”  Chloe apologised to hide her delay in complying.  <br />
<br />
“It’s okay.  Better to be safe than sorry.”  Ana replied calmly, completely unaware that Chloe was already thinking up the words to her next act.  <br />
<br />
Knowing that she could make things happen with her bracelet by thinking about it from the first use of it, she thought:  <br />
<br />
‘<i>I wish that the woman next to me, has feet like mine, and only I am aware of it.</i>’  <br />
<br />
A wish that as worded, made Ana yelp as she took one hand off the wheel, grabbing one boot and wrenching it away from her foot.  A foot that was covered in hard bony hoof and built to be stood on it, doing the same with the other before putting it on the Gas again and driving on.  <br />
<br />
“I don’t know why I bothered with these.”  Ana complained as she tossed the unneeded items into the back seats.  <br />
<br />
“True, who needs them?”  Chloe agreed, inwardly delighted that she was still seeing great results from her experiments.  “By the way?  I never did learn your name.”  <br />
<br />
“Ana.”  <br />
<br />
“Chloe.”  She replied, now able to speak more informally(?) with this human.  <br />
<br />
With the both of them in the same basic state, human but with hoofed feet, Chloe was ready to start a Big Experiment.   <br />
<br />
‘<i>I wish that, over the next, hour(?), both myself, and Ana, will transform into, full horses.  I will be the only one aware of this.  Ana will maintain control over this, vehicle.  Anyone outside who sees us will dismiss what they see and not speak of it.  These, seatbelts, will adjust to fit.  Both Ana and myself will be able to speak as we currently, are able to.</i>’  <br />
<br />
As soon as she finished making her lengthy mental wish, the first signs slowly became known to Chloe, a slight itching of returning fur that while not uncomfortable, was certainly noticeable, and looking at Ana, her nose was larger, the nostrils more flared.  <br />
<br />
“So what do you do?”  Chloe asked her, curious as to how she lived.  <br />
<br />
“Oh, I’m a farmer Chloe.  The work is hard, but it keeps me active.”  Ana answered while not registering her more pointed ears.  <br />
<br />
“Could you?  Describe it more?”  Chloe felt her spine push out ever so slightly.  <br />
<br />
“Sure.  It’s not a huge one, but not small either, fields need tending year-round, but there’s help for that, and enough free time every now and again for some fun.”  <br />
<br />
“Such as?”  <br />
<br />
“Well, there is one horse I keep, and she gets to go out more than enough to stay healthy.  But I think she gets lonely, so I decided to buy another one to give her some company.”  <br />
<br />
Chloe took time to process this information.  So this Ana did own horses like herself, but unlike her old Master did at least treat her better, or at least she believed herself to.  She could find out later she decided as Chloe turned her head to see the passing fields, mostly empty masses of farmland, but sometimes some horses, or cows could be seen.  <br />
<br />
“Then who works for you?  At your, Farm?”  By the time Chloe resumed their conversation, her entire body had its red-blond fur back, hair a mane once more, head back to its normal (though smaller) shape and she was quite a bit larger now, in both height and width.  <br />
<br />
“Two workers, and my daughter sometimes.  She turned fifteen not that long back.”  Ana was the same as Chloe, though with clothes on that were being slowly torn apart by the stress on them.  <br />
<br />
The dungaree straps ripped off the front and the blouse and bra(?) forced open to expose her front.  Legs squeezed into the bottom save for where the growing tears let them breathe.  Her own tail free and swishing while Ana readjusted her seat again to keep comfortable.  <br />
<br />
“And what are they like?”  Chloe pressed on, aware of her stiffening fingers.  <br />
<br />
“Well, Samantha’s what you’d expect for a fifteen year-old but she means well, and the others do what they’re told to.”  Ana adjusted her grip on the steering wheel as she answered Chloe’s question.  <br />
<br />
Their conversation continued for some time.  Ana’s life, how she managed, her lack of husband but how she was fine with that, and Chloe did begin to find herself taking a liking to this human woman.   In fact she did start to think if using her for her experimentation with the Ring-turned-Bracelet was so great, before deciding she could fix things later if she so desired.  <br />
<br />
Which brought Chloe’s focus back to the continuing effects of her current wish.  <br />
<br />
Neither of them had anything on, Ana’s attire a mess of torn fabrics that rested around her and under her wide rump that spilled over the seat edges, a rump that brushed against Chloe’s when they moved.  Ana’s hooves around the steering wheel and still able to control the car, even as she had to lean forward to keep her head off the ceiling and see where they were going.  And Chloe could tell that for now, she could still stand and walk on her back legs.  But they were still becoming larger, and now Chloe could tell that if she could reach the release system for their seatbelts, that wouldn’t be the case for long.  <br />
<br />
“Say?  How much longer before we get there?”  Chloe asked, realising she hadn’t checked that detail.  <br />
<br />
“Still another hour-and-a-half, if the road’s good.”  Ana replied through a mouth that usually wouldn’t be capable of human speech.  “Just as well as I need to go.”  <br />
<br />
And the time now told Chloe that they had fifteen minutes left before her wish was completed.  Meaning a good deal of time a full horses inside this thing, and Ana had been nice, so she did consider pulling back on her wish a bit.  But then again, that could defeat the purpose of her tests.  What to do?</p>
