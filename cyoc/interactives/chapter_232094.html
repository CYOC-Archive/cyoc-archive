<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">a female doctor came in to give Lily her change. &quot;hello&quot; she greeted as she looked at the paper she was given. &quot;hello. so how are we doing this miss?&quot; Lily asked sitting at a doctor&#39;s table. the entire 10 by 10 room was like a typical doctor&#39;s office save for the height of the room was exactly 100 feet tall. &quot;well each type of change is different. some use a magic stone, were-animals have a a magical virus infused with the DNA of the animal they will transform into. you will have to have several enchanted feathers placed on whichever body part you choose. limbs and tail feathers are mandatory for those becoming harpies. any more is your decision. you could have it just on your limbs or have it cover your entire torso or face. You&#39;ll still have your human shape though&quot; the doctor said while ignoring Lily asking her name.  <br />
<br />
She then opened a box with several feathers. &quot;I&#39;ll be back in thirty minutes to see the results. if you need anything just press the intercom by the door. Oh and one more thing you should strip down if you want to keep your outfit.&quot; and with that she left for Zoey&#39;s room. Lily sighed as she knew this was her best option.  <br />
<br />
she then stripped down to her birthday suit and approached the box on the counter. she placed feathers on her legs a few inches above her knees. the tag attaching it to her glowed with runes before vanishing. the feathers then turned black with a hint of purple before more grew from her skin. it left a subtle jagged separation between her skin and the new feathers before spreading down her legs.  <br />
<br />
after they had gone a few inches past her knees they turned a deep purple and stopped at her ankles. this proved arousing and the next part pushed Lily over the edge. her ankles raised and gave her an extra foot in height. black scales covered them with some ridges on the front. her pussy gushed with cum as her feet changed. her big toe moved to the back of her feet. the little toe was lost when the three toes grew in size becoming nearly identical.  <br />
<br />
the middle grew a few centimeters longer as black talons grew and sent sparks across the protected floor. after that, Lily calmed down but it took a bit. the change itself only lasted a minute but the clock said she had been aroused for several minutes. &quot;well now I know why they said thirty minutes.&quot; she said aloud. figuring they noise-proofed the rooms for privacy she attached the next feather to the base of her spine.  <br />
<br />
As expected she grew extremely horny as a tail grew. it was quickly covered by more black feathers at the base. longer and extremely long teal feathers grew. If Lily was at her original height they would have dragged the ground. when lily came after her second cuming she found a test tube jammed into her pussy.  <br />
<br />
before she could pull it out it transformed into a dildo. &quot;for a place that advises against pregnancy they sure do offer plenty of temptations. she pulled the dildo out and grabbed two more feathers. placing them like the ones on her legs she saw tame give the same subtle jagged line before spreading down her arms. her mind filled with lust she quickly grabbed the dildo again and plunged it into her pussy.   <br />
<br />
it they glowed and vibrated sending her into pure bliss. two of her fingers on each hand merged with its neighbor making the two remaining longer and covered in black scales. smaller talons grew on them and her thumbs. under her arms, long black feathers grew with a line of long blue feathers and ended with white ones. her brain was given new information on how to fly and position her wings when not in flight. the urge to fly was too great and she flew to the ceiling where a net-styled hammock lay.  <br />
<br />
She lay in it as her juices fell to the floor. the excess magic turned her hair blue and after with black pointed ears. She then heard the door open below her. She should have been scared of how high she was but instead, she took a leap off the hammock and gracefully glided down. She now did a bird squat on the table as the doctor smiled.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I apologize for the arousal you got. the intern at the desk accidentally put both of you sexually active for the two of you instead of your sister&quot; She then handed her a sleeveless shirt and shorts that were just short enough to not mess up her feathers. &quot;your clothing will be put in storage until you leave mythtopia. if you do leave well have a person come to your place and remove your changes. until then this will be your form for the next five years&quot; Lily felt like she said that a lot as it was most likely practiced. She had some difficulty putting the shorts on but eventually got them past her talons and buttoned them around her tail feathers.  <br />
<br />
the shirt was easier as it had a clip for both sides and she realized it was only covering her upper torso. it was around this time she realized her hair and ears had changed. &quot;excess magic, like lightning has to go somewhere&quot; the doctor said after she noticed. after getting dressed she was escorted to a room with several other myths. &quot;this is the housekeeping arrangement room&quot; an elf said as she watched the doctor leave.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry your sister will be your roommate. the others are here to see where they will be staying for the next 5 years.&quot; the elf then showed Lily to a perch that looked similar to a normal seat. from there, she saw the other myths. there were two dragons one male and one female. from the way they acted, she guessed they were a couple.  <br />
<br />
there was also a large amount of griffins here. given how they needed them for Griffin&#39;s roost she wasn&#39;t surprised. a sphinx was looking irritated at the other staff. it took a second but she realized they must have thought it was an Egyptian sphinx, not a Greek one. &#39;they probably should mention that on the form&#39; she thought as she saw the last myth.  <br />
<br />
it was a nervous-looking were-boar. the man was very anxious. from his wince sitting cross-legged, she realized he must&#39;ve been a woman. from the form, she saw the were-boar paid the best of them all. she then heard an unfamiliar voice call to her.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Lily the harpy as I live and breathe&quot; It sounded vaguely like her father before he disappeared but younger. turning her head she saw a seven-foot blond werewolf in tan shorts and a red hoodie. it took until the shock went away to realize who this was. &quot;Zoey?&quot; she squawked. She then realized she did this instead of a slight squeal.  <br />
<br />
&quot;yeah but I&#39;m dropping the y in my name until I&#39;m done,&quot; he said as his body had already begun to shrink. however, it wasn&#39;t becoming his old body. &quot;why&quot; was all she could say as Zoe&#39;s clothes magically re-shifted to fit his six-foot human frame. &quot;it was an option and an excuse to be who I truly am&quot; he chuckled as he remembered his change. <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Zoey was excited and nervous when the doctor came in. She barely paid attention to what the doctor said until a question was repeated. &quot;what?&quot; Zoey realized she was asked something. &quot;I said how do you want your werewolf virus administered? we could do an injection. we could do ingestion or a patch.  <br />
<br />
I would offer the typical bite-scratch fantasy but that would make you a female werewolf, not a male one&quot; The doctor put three packages on the counter. Unlike most doctor rooms this one was large enough were you couldn&#39;t see the other walls, especially with the false trees in it. &quot;um if I&#39;m gonna be a male for the next five years id like to use my pussy on last time&quot; Zoey blushed as she said the last part. sighing she grabbed all three packages. &quot;ill be right back&quot; it took a few minutes before she came back with a single package.  <br />
<br />
&quot;some of our more sexually active employees prefer this method&quot; She then opened the box for Zoey to look into and saw a pink transparent dildo with a white translucent liquid inside. &quot;you just slide it in and when you release so does it&quot; the doctor looked less than happy with this. &quot;I should warn you that our sexually active employees can quickly become permanent members of our staff,&quot; she said before giving Zoey thirty minutes to get used to her new body. &quot;after that the virus will remain dormant in your systems until night or when we need you. if the latter is needed a pill will be given to you to allow you to become your werewolf version in daytime hours.&quot; the doctor soon left the room allowing Zoey to strip down and grab the dildo.  <br />
<br />
&quot;so long femininity it&#39;s been good,&quot; she said before plunging it into her pussy. As she pushed it in and out of her pussy she imagined how it would feel to have a cock. soon she cumed and felt something cool enter her pussy. She moaned for a second as her pussy shifted. the dildo now falling to the floor.  <br />
<br />
fluids wouldn&#39;t stop gushing from her pussy as her clit began poking up from her pussy. the slit between her legs began to shift and surround her growing cilt. her nails shifted as she fell to the floor. her new claws left deep gouges in the stone beneath her. her ears became pointed as blond fur grew above her ass.  <br />
<br />
more fur grew by her ears and on her nose. The latter had become black and canine. her ears continued to shift and were covered in blond fur with some dirty blonde mixed in. The fur above her ass quickly gained length as muscle and bone grew as well. her tail grew over a foot and wasn&#39;t stopping.  <br />
<br />
white fur grew in a line down her middle with thick chest fur between her shrinking breasts. while all this happened white fur covered her crotch as two bulges appeared on either side of her shifting pussy. her feet gained pads and claws. white fur covered them and spread just below the knee where more blonde fur grew. her three-foot tail rose showing off her large testicles.  <br />
<br />
they soon sealed most of her pussy leaving only what surrounded her mutating clit. the fur quickly spread over her back as white fur covered her hands up to her elbows. thinner white fur began to spread across her front. As the fur continued to spread her muscles and height swelled greatly. rising to her feet showed the last of her pussy becoming a furry white sheath wrapped around his cock.  <br />
<br />
his once long hair merged on his back into a mane with dirty blond fur mixed into it. his face pushed out into a muzzle line with fangs. his yellow eyes glowed as he reached for his sheath. a dirty blond bush grew around his sheath as it began to poke out from its home. the moment Zoey touched his cock his breasts finished sinking into firm pecs.  <br />
<br />
he grabbed his dick as it came out and began jacking off with it. after the knot came out he cumed better than he ever did as a woman. after he finished he felt like he had some much energy. it was like he downed an entire tanker of coffee. he then ran into the fake forest and was amazed at his speed.  <br />
<br />
that was until he tripped and landed on his tail. after that he was more aware of his surroundings. he had more sex with himself as well as testing out his improved strength. Eventually, his enhanced hearing allowed him to hear the door open. running to it he got there before the doctor could even step into the room.  <br />
<br />
he grinned while panting as she gave a reluctant smile. &quot;your sister finished a few minutes ago. put these on and you can follow me to the housing arrangement room&quot; She then handed him the clothes and stood outside the room. he found he was okay with his masculine body but understood nudity was frowned upon. he put on the red briefs first and then the rest.  <br />
<br />
the only thing he kept from his wardrobe was his shark tooth necklace their mother gave him when he was six. he was thankful it hung around his neck barely. after getting dressed he banged his head on the door frame before ducking. &quot;don&#39;t worry your house and work will have doorways taller for you.&quot; the doctor said as they walked down the hall opposite of how they came in.  <br />
<br />
After the doctor left him in the room he could feel the energy begin to leave him. he then spotted a harpy with a familiar face and torso. &quot;Lily the harpy as I live and breathe&quot; he smiled as Lily turned to face him. After her shock faded she squawked his name like a bird &quot;Zoey?&quot;. she covered her mouth with her new wings as he smiled.  <br />
<br />
&quot;yeah but I&#39;m dropping the y in my name until I&#39;m done,&quot; he said as he began to lose his werewolf appearance until the next time he needed it. &quot;why&quot; was all she could say as his clothes shifted to fit his human male body. &quot;it was an option and excuse to be who I truly am,&quot; he said before an elf greeted them both. &quot;Zoe and Lily good to have you on board&quot; he shook Zoe&#39;s hand and nodded to Lily before looking at his clipboard. &quot;okay from now on you&#39;ll be staying at 235 Twilight Flight. It is where those who become nocturnal myths stay. it also is close enough to your area of patrol.&quot; he then gave Zoe the address and showed them to an outdoor parking garage.  <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
the doctor who gave Lily and Zoey their changes walked into the employee break room. &quot;did you get a male employee again.&quot; a voice to her right said. turning her head she saw Brad the Tanuki pouring a cup of coffee while giving a smug yet understanding look. &quot;no a woman wanted to be a male myth, a werewolf&quot; she said as her form was covered in translucent blue fire. when the fire was done his true form was shown. the kitsune sat at the table with his feet up. &quot;hey Kion, it&#39;s our job to transform the humans who want to work here. we can&#39;t pick what they want to be. unless you want to be fired from your job and serve the rest of your life in prison.&quot; the tanuki smiled as he let his balls grow to their beanbag size.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I know but one more male means one less female to hit on&quot; No one could prove it but Kion was responsible for quite a few permanent employees and their kids. As a shapeshifter, he could look like the lady&#39;s perfect mate. he didn&#39;t mean for them to get pregnant but if they did they never saw their perfect mate again. he did get caught once and was now a permanent employee himself of course. &quot;dude you should stop with this tramp stuff and find a good woman as I did with Alice&quot; brad said finishing his coffee.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, where&#39;s the fun in that&quot; he said as the clock chimed at the end of their break. &quot;well I hope you find what you&#39;re looking for,&quot; Brad said as they shifted to their work-approved outfits. brad said one last thing before he left. &quot;I&#39;ll have to tell you about the man who became a female sphinx and the woman who became a were-boar&quot;. one of those caught the doctor&#39;s interest and it wasn&#39;t hard to guess which one. <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
even in the parking garage, the myth themes ran strong. the vehicles were all themed to different places and periods. some looked like they were from medieval times while others looked like chariots. A four-foot gremlin approached them. he wore typical mechanic clothing.  <br />
<br />
after giving him the paper he handed it back. &quot;your cars will be in long-term parking for the next five years. you can use it whenever you leave Mythtopia, until then use the company-issued car.&quot; he said as he walked to their new vehicle. it looked like a normal car but had a unique seat for Lily. &quot;even here we follow the laws. besides I think you&#39;ll get places faster flying, the special seat is for when you get tired or injured and need Zoe to drive you&quot; he then typed in code on a nearby wall and a small door opened.  <br />
<br />
he grabbed a key and tossed it to Zoe. &quot;until you get used to the place I suggest you ride with him,&quot; he then approached the were-boar looking unsure about his new form. &quot;guess driving&quot; Lily just gave an eye roll and her sister... no, her brother&#39;s joke. after they drove out of the parking garage it felt like they had been taken to a fantasy world. mythical creatures both regular and anthro were lining the streets and skies.  <br />
<br />
there were humans as well but they were mostly tourists. it was a fifteen-minute drive from the enrollment building before they reached their new home for the next five years at least. it was a two-story house that looked like it had a Greek/roman theme to it. a tower was on the side of it. after they parked in the driveway they looked at their neighbors. to the left looked like a Gothic house.  <br />
<br />
a pale man and woman with fangs smiled and waved to them through a shaded window. on the opposite was a vacant house. it wasn&#39;t vacant for long because a car rolled into the driveway. They soon saw the new homeowner was a 6&#39;5&quot; African American man. Zoe smelled the air as it blew his scent towards her.  <br />
<br />
he recognized the scent as being the one the were-boar had. the man looked completely uncomfortable as he rushed into his house. shrugging they did the same and went to their door. when they got in they saw...</p>
