<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Hey, Sal, sorry to keep you waiting, let&#39;s go into my office,&quot; said McGurk as he arrived, he added brusquely, &quot;You too Jason,&quot; he said nodding at Snake, and then looking at Horst and Carter, he nodded his head toward the locker room, &quot;I think you boys have something to do, don&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, sir!&quot; said Horst with a snicker jumping to his feet.  <br />
<br />
Carter nodded and they disappeared off to the locker room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have a seat, Sal.  Horst and Carter will deliver the boots for Ryan.&quot;<br />
<br />
Snake glanced over at where Sal was sitting and smiled knowingly at him. Even though he had blown a load into the boots only a few minutes ago, he was already tenting his shorts.<br />
<br />
Coach McGurk pulled out a pair of boots and an olive green jumpsuit from under his desk, and thrust them at Snake.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jason, strip out of your gear and put this on now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Here?  Now?&quot; Snake sounded confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes!  Now change.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t have anything, Sal and I haven&#39;t seen before,&quot; but you can change in my private restroom, if you&#39;re shy.<br />
<br />
Snake was through the designated door in 10 seconds flat.  It slammed shut.<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;ll be a few minutes.  Until he realizes that there&#39;s no way out, and then he&#39;ll change.  So how&#39;s Sinclair?  Still the same old pain in the butt?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know it, coach,&quot; laughed Sal Cost.<br />
<br />
A pounding at the coach&#39;s door was followed by a nearly naked Ryan Standish - okay, he was completely naked except for the boots he was wearing.  Sal&#39;s tongue slipped between his teeth as he recognized Chad on Ryan&#39;s feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck, coach, is going on?  I just ran 25 friggin&#39; laps.  I lay down in the sauna for a few minutes, and then the power goes off.  No lights, and the furnace is off.  I go to shower, and the water&#39;s off!  Go to my locker, and my clothes and gear are both gone except for these friggin&#39; boots.  Heck the towel cage is even locked, so I couldn&#39;t get a towel.&quot;  Ryan was livid, whether he was red from exertion, the sauna heat or anger was debatable, probably all three contributed. <br />
<br />
The coach pulled another pair of olive green coveralls from under his desk, and through it at Ryan. <br />
<br />
&quot;Put this on, then we&#39;ll talk, Standish.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryan looked flustered, but noticing that the coach had a guest, he shut up, and put the coveralls on right there.<br />
<br />
Sal almost burst out laughing, since Ryan didn&#39;t take his boots off first.  He struggled and managed to get the legs over the size 12 boots.  His dick was still flopping out of the zipper, when Snake emerged from the coach&#39;s bathroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice touch, Coach McGurk, but next time you put my name on clothing, I prefer &quot;Snake&quot;,&quot; Snake said pointing at the black block letters emblazoned on the left chest above the pocket, &quot;J. Tyler.&quot;  He added, &quot;Oh, look you got one for Standish too.  Shipping us off to bootcamp?&quot; he asked smugly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, you two are going to boot camp for two weeks.  You&#39;re going to be bunk mates,&quot; Coach McGurk said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait - boot camp?  I&#39;ve got a job, and-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your boss and Aunt  have all signed the paperwork, and agreed to let me ship you out, Tyler,&quot; said McGurk, and looking at Ryan, he added, &quot;That goes for your parents too, Standish.  Coach Cost here will escort you by train to the boot camp, where you two will be put through an excruciating two weeks of training.  Hopefully, you will come back broken of bad habits and bad attitudes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I need to go home to pack-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You are taking what you&#39;re wearing.  Everything else will be supplied to you. The school is paying for your trip. You two are our lucky scholarship winners.&quot;<br />
<br />
Three, thought Cost with a grin as he stared at Chad.  He could hear muffled unintelligible gibberish coming out of Ryan&#39;s stuffed right boot.  Poor Chad, Ryan should be wearing a size 12.5, but Chad was only a 12.  Coach McGurk had said Ryan liked his shoes tight. All the better for teaching Chad a lesson.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, you will be spending the next 14 days in the swamps of Louisiana, and you will learn to work together, buddy system.  It&#39;s a survival course, so you will be on your own for part of that time. You will be marching through the muck, mire and mud in hot humid conditions, rain is forecast, so you will probably get wet.  You will be carrying 50 lb packs-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ryan&#39;s a big strong lad,&quot; interrupted Snake slapping Standish on the back, &quot;How about he carry both our packs?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sal laughed.<br />
<br />
Coach McGurk growled.<br />
<br />
There was a knock at the door.  Coach McGurk walked over and opened it a few inches.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, oh, thank you,&quot; McGurk said, &quot;That will be all.&quot;<br />
<br />
He closed the door, and shoved a jockstrap with the name Standish written on the waistband against Ryan&#39;s belly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You may want to put this on first, Standish,&quot; the coach said with a sigh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, oh, damn.&quot;<br />
<br />
Flustered but obedient.  Ryan Standish stripped naked to put on his jockstrap, but again he left his boots on. Snake put his hand to his chin and took a step back admiring the blond athlete&#39;s butt.  From his straining shorts, Snake obviously had intentions on Ryan&#39;s virgin ass.  Coach McGurk glared at him, but remained silent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, can I go to my locker and get my inhaler?&quot; Snake asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Inhaler?&quot;  McGurk said, then he added, &quot;Oh, yes.  Sal, you wouldn&#39;t mind escorting Mr. Tyler, I&#39;d hate for him to wander off, and miss his train.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing,&quot;  said Sal.  A few moments later, the two were headed to the locker room as Ryan struggled with the jumpsuit.<br />
<br />
&quot;You think jock boy will figure out he should put his pants on before he puts his boots on?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eventually.  But it&#39;s more fun watching him struggle.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason snickered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I saw you eyeing his butt, but I&#39;d suggest you might have more luck just blowing your loads in his boots.  Horst and Carter said he sleeps like a log, but I bet he&#39;d wake up if you put your cock inside him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah? Well, we&#39;ll see.&quot;<br />
<br />
At his locker, Snake grabbed his inhaler, comb, toothbrush, and a plastic baggie filled with pills. He shoved them into the front right pocket of his coveralls.  He did it thinking that he had concealed them from Coach Cost.  He hadn&#39;t.<br />
<br />
Coach Cost picked his pocket, and glanced at the baggie filled with small white pills.  There was also a bag of white powder mixed in with the pills.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sleeping aids.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Roofies, and-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Scopolamine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, so you plan to use those on Standish?&quot; Cost said thoughtfully.<br />
<br />
Snake didn&#39;t answer, he rolled his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, as long as you fuck each of his boots nightly, I guess it will be okay,&quot; said Cost handing the surprised young man back his bag of tricks.<br />
<br />
Snake took the bag and put it away silently.  They started to walk back to McGurk&#39;s office.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who are those boots?&quot; Snake asked as they walked back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, don&#39;t play dumb.  I don&#39;t know why Horst and Carter couldn&#39;t hear that whiny voice coming out of the right boot.  The left boot wasn&#39;t talking, so I didn&#39;t mind fucking it.  Guess, I won&#39;t mind fucking a talking boot, as long as know who it is.  Don&#39;t play dumb.  I know you heard it, cause you shoved your limp cock in it quickly to gag it.  I could even hear a muffled sounds coming from it when Ryan was wearing it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You part gypsy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe? Dunno? Why?&quot;  Snake answered, &quot;Now about your talking boots.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Remember that Chad kid, we talked about?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, he&#39;s going to boot camp too, as Ryan&#39;s boots.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Boots or boot?  I only heard his voice coming from the right boot.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, his upper body is the right boot, you put your dick into his mouth.  The left boot, well that&#39;s his lower body, so your dick was in his ass.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sweet!&quot; said Jason, &quot;But why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, the school board only had enough scholarship money for two incorrigible athletes, and I really wanted Chad to experience boot camp.  Humiliation does wonder to- well, you will find out, if you don&#39;t already know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Only the jockboy, and the champ are going to be humiliated.  Here I was afraid, I might not get any action,&quot; laughed Snake as they walked back to McGurk&#39;s office. <br />
<br />
Ryan was properly dressed when they returned.  He was arguing with the coach about it not mattering whether his parents agreed, he was an adult now.<br />
<br />
As Snake entered, Ryan pointed at Snake, &quot;Hey, he&#39;s 18 too.  You cannot make us go, no matter what our folks say.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, I can. You two bright boys signed these consent forms at the start of the school year. Now look at it as an all expense paid vacation to Florida.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought you said Louisiana?&quot; chimed in Snake.<br />
<br />
&quot;Warm humid weather down south, what&#39;s the difference?  It&#39;s getting late.  Get these two hunks of meat out of here, the train leaves in an hour.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can we eat first?&quot; asked Snake.<br />
<br />
&quot;Does it have to be a train?  I kinda get motion sick,&quot; moaned Ryan, as Cost put them both in the backseat of his car.<br />
<br />
Snake whispered to Ryan, &quot;No worries, I got motion sickness pills.&quot;</p>
