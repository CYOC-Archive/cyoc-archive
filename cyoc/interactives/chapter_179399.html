<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After Mark left, Aidan decided on doing his homework. Now he looked disgusted by the smell and taste again, as he now had no one to foul, while he still sucked on the sock in his mouth. It was hard doing his homework with his stiffly covered hands, rendering his writing nearly unreadable even to himself.<br />
When he finally finished his homework over an hour later, Aidan was exhaust and his hand ached. He made himself a cheese-sandwich, which also wasn´t easy. But he managed, through he made a mess out of his kitchen in the process. He only removed his sock-pacifier to eat it, not happy when his sandwich tasted like shit as well.<br />
Soon after, Aidan went to bed still as dressed as before, after doing his business in the bathroom. While Mark had made Aidan wear a diaper, he never said for him to use it, therefore Aidan saw it as normal clothing and was still able to use the toilet normally.<br />
It was the next morning, earlier than Aidan raised normally, when Mark ringed his doorbell. Mark wanted to see Aidan and maybe add a thing or two he had thought about before they would head to their uni. Aidan opened the door, looking tired but instantly grinned around his sock-pacifier to foul Mark about the taste and smell.<br />
“Morning, Aidan. Did I wake you?” Mark greeted him smiling.<br />
Aidan removed his sock-pacifier to answer: “Morning Mark. Yeah, you woke me up. It´s still so early. What do you need?” He then put his sock back into his mouth.<br />
Mark moved in and closed the door before answering: “I thought I forgot something here yesterday, and wanted to get it before classes. We can go there together afterwards.” It was a lie that he thought he had forgotten anything, but he didn´t need Aidan to know that.<br />
“Okay, I didn´t notice anything, but you can look while I change my clothes so we can go afterwards.” With that, Aidan headed back towards his bedroom, yawning and stretching.<br />
Mark powered up his laptop, at the table, and sat down after tipping the door to Aidan´s bedroom open without Aidan´s notice. So, he had a clear view on Aidan stripping off his clothes with some difficulty. <br />
Aidan tossed his sock-pacifier into the laundry-basket, followed by his bib-sock, removing only the cord. After a bit of work, he got out of his stiff glove-socks, also throwing them in the basket. Next in were his normal worn socks, then his pants and shirt, leaving him in only the diaper.<br />
Mark noticed that the diaper was still clean and raised an eyebrow at that. How had Aidan not needed his diaper by now?<br />
Aidan stripped out of the diaper, throwing it into the trash. He carefully removed the sock on his slightly erected cock, then from his ass crack. Now standing naked, he turned to his wardrobe. The first pair of socks he grabbed went into their special places, left on his cock, right in his ass crack. He pulled a diaper out of his drawer and slipped it on. He slipped on bright green pants to cover his diaper, then a yellow shirt with a blue moon over his torso, pushing it into his pants.<br />
Taking two more pairs of socks out of the drawer, quickly slipping them onto his feet and hands. He connected the cord to the sock that had been on his cock since yesterday, throwing it over his head and around his neck, before balling up the other sock and put it into his mouth. Only then he turned around and noticed Mark was watching him though the wide-open door and blushed as red as a tomato.<br />
“You watched me change?” he asked in a meek voice as he came over to the kitchen, noting Mark had his own laptop powered up.<br />
“No, at least not the whole time” Mark lied. “I was looking at something on my laptop before I noticed you had your door open and looked a few times. But didn´t you forget something?”<br />
Aidan nodded at the first part, still bright red, but was confused by the question. “I didn´t forget anything, I´m wearing all I ne…” Mark clapped at that, having decided to add something.<br />
“No Aidan, you forgot to put your shoes on. You wear them always, only removing them when you go to bed or change your clothes, right?” Mark said. It had to do with what he had planned afterwards that Aidan had to wear his shoes all the time.<br />
Aidan nodded at that, quickly moving to get his shoes and put them on. Mark altered Aidan´s shoes the evening before, alongside the other clothes, but had not thought about Aidan wearing them always then. They now fitted Aidan´s “colorful” clothes, as they were now dark blue with red stars, and a pink sole. And to help Aidan a bit, they now had Velcros instead of shoe-laces.<br />
After Aidan fastened his shoes, he moved to make himself a sandwich for breakfast. It worked better than the evening before, as his sock-gloves weren´t as stiff as yesterday, but he still made a mess.<br />
Meanwhile, Mark decided to ask Aidan what had wondered him before: “Aidan, how was your diaper still clean? Didn´t you need it sometime since I left yesterday?”<br />
Aidan turned around, again getting red in embarrassment, but answered: “You know, while I wear it the whole time, I still use the toilet normally, right?”<br />
Mark looked unsatisfied with that. Something he needed to change right now. Grinning evilly, he asked: “You know how to use the toilet, Aidan?”<br />
Aidan looked at him confused, but started to answer: “Ye…” But Mark stomped his foot loudly. Suddenly, Aidan had no idea how to use a toilet anymore, as all this was erased out of his mind. Now, he was never potty-trained in his life. <br />
Mark grinned and said: “’No, you never learned that, because you never wanted to. That´s why you wear your diaper after all, to use it if needed. Much more relaxing to go if needed, you said, right? Not that you could hold it in longer than a minute or two, as you don´t do so if your diaper is removed, right?”<br />
It clicked into Aidan´s mind, filling the void that was created seconds before. “Yeah right, I never wanted to learn, as I can´t keep it in anyways.” As to underline that statement, Mark could clearly hear that Aidan just emptied his bladder into the diaper. And he couldn´t do anything but laugh, even when Aidan looked annoyed at him. “Why is that funny, Mark?” But Mark gave no answer, still laughing too hard. Aidan put his sock-pacifier back in while he waited for an answer.</p>
