<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Midnight was standing beside Talia as everyone got ready to leave, well eccept Lia and Luna, Midnight looked right at Talia. &quot;Will you come with us? I mean I enjoy being with you and well...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Midnight, settle down, hun, please. Look, I&#39;m your friend, and will always be such. But I belong here in Egypt. I can&#39;t leave.&quot; Talia said, hugging Midnight close to hir.<br />
<br />
&quot;No. I won&#39;t accept that. You belong with me.&quot; Shi said, starting to cry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Midnight, hun,&quot; Sally came forward. &quot;Dear, Talia has things to do here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Midnight glared. &quot;No. Shi doesn&#39;t. Shi belongs with me. I need hir.&quot; Shi looked at Talia. &quot;To a child, I am unconditional, many do anything to show me, regardless of what happens, I am in the hearts of many families.&quot; Midnight turned and walked with hir mother, ears flattened and tail between hir legs as shi walked.<br />
<br />
Talia stood there thinking before walking up to Midnight. &quot;It is love.&quot; Shi hugged hir friend. &quot;Midnight, you are my dearest of friends. Should you need me you can always call. And I&#39;ll fly to you as soon as I can.&quot;<br />
<br />
Midnight shook hir head. &quot;You don&#39;t get it, do you?&quot; Shi yelled at hir. &quot;I walk and I feel a tugging of my heart and it hurts too much.&quot; Shi turned towards Talia. &quot;I need you with me all the time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sally walked up. &quot;I think what Midnight&#39;s saying is you belong where you&#39;re heart belongs.&quot; Sally smiled. &quot;I understand what shi&#39;s saying. Shi loves you, and shi&#39;s right. You belong with us.&quot; Shi rubbed Talia&#39;s shoulder.<br />
<br />
Talia looked. &quot;Do... do you really want me along?&quot; Shi asked.<br />
<br />
Midnight looked. &quot;Either you go with, or I stay with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Talia lifted Midnight and hugged hir close. &quot;I think, since you put it that way, I&#39;ll go live with you. But, I will teach you how to speak my language and teach you every riddle in the book. You will be my student, and then in six years, you will become my mate. Is that agreed on?&quot;<br />
<br />
Midnight&#39;s ears went up, tail wagging. &quot;Oh you bet your hot ass it is.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sally smiled. &quot;Now to find those two.&quot;<br />
<br />
Midnight looked. &quot;You know, I think they are going to go against what Snowy said. I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll accept that the new them isn&#39;t related.&quot; She said softly. &quot;I know Lia as a human was my cousin, but as a dingokat, shi is someone totally different.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sally sat there thinking. &quot;Of course.&quot; Sally smiled. &quot;They met after they changed and accepted each other as friends. Long before...&quot; Sally kissed Midnight. &quot;You certainly are smart, my dear.&quot;<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Luna and Lia were deep in the base of the sphinx, snuggling. &quot;You know, they won&#39;t allow this back home.&quot; Luna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then why not we go back to Sydney? The pack will accept you as their member. After all, a wolf and dingo are very similar.&quot; Lia said kissing Luna.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d love to, but I have to look after Midnight. I keep hir out of trouble, plus I promised mother that I would be there to make sure shi grows up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lia smiled. &quot;Fine, We won&#39;t hide it, and we won&#39;t care.&quot; Lia kissed Luna right on the lips, Luna returning the kiss.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, what do you say to you mating me then Lia, my love?&quot; shi lifted hir tail up.<br />
<br />
Lia smiled hopping onto hir back and kissing at Luna&#39;s neck. Lia then pushes right in, thrusting hir cock right into Luna&#39;s pussy, and wrapping hir hands around to play with hir breasts. Luna moaned out of pleasure as the two were now going to become lifemates. Lia thrusted into Luna with meaning, as the two lovecanines kissed deeply and passionately. Lia then brought hir forleg up to Luna&#39;s hardening cock and began stroking as shi picked up the pace. &quot;My dear, you are nice and tight.&quot; She licked hir ear.<br />
<br />
Luna moaned at the pleasure as shi thrusted into Lia&#39;s handfoot, rocking with hir thrusts. &quot;Oh and you&#39;re big, hun.&quot; Shi looked at hir. &quot;I can&#39;t wait for my turn.&quot; Luna moaned lowering hir front half to give Lia better access.<br />
<br />
Lia picked up the pace once more, both girls getting very very wet from the pleasure, and sweeting as well. &quot; Oh this is amazing...&quot; Lia exclaimed as shi bit down on Luna&#39;s neck and kept going, picking up speed.<br />
<br />
Luna let out a loud moan as shi climaxed onto Lia&#39;s cock and the floor, hir tightening walls were clamping down onto Lia&#39;s cock as Lia&#39;s knot began forming. Lia let out one more moan, thrusting, knot and all into Luna&#39;s pussy, knot swelling in there, tying the two together. Shi then released hir load deep into Luna. The two panting as Lia dismounted and turned around, both tails going at one hundred miles an hour as Luna looked. &quot;You know, I think I&#39;ll take my turn.&quot; Shi turned, lifting hir hind leg then smiling, mounting Lia while Lia was still tied to Luna. Luna thursted right into Lia&#39;s pussy, playing with hir breasts like shi did hir.<br />
<br />
Lia moaned loudly as shi reached and scratched Luna&#39;s ears. &quot;We&#39;re inside each other, and it feels so hot.&quot; Lia said as shi licked Luna on the nose. The two then went in and kissed deeply and passionately, Lia&#39;s cock getting stimulated inside Luna&#39;s pussy as Lia was fucked by Luna&#39;s cock. Both were enjoying each other&#39;s bliss, as Luna&#39;s knot was forming and both girls were nearing their orgasm together. Luna gave one final thrust, pushing hir knot deep into Lia, it swelling and tying them together like this as well as both girls filled eachother&#39;s pussies with cum. Luna and Lia were both panting as they held eachother like that until both cocks swelled down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow. Now we are for life.&quot; Luna said kissing Lia on the cheek.<br />
<br />
About thirty minutes passed before they were able to pull free. Just as they did, Sally walked in looking. &quot;Girls. Are you two ready?&quot; Shi looked at them. &quot;And are you finished?&quot; Shi teased again.<br />
<br />
Luna smiled as shi walked up and hugged hir mother and walked out with a smile on hir face, Lia then followed suit. &quot;Well, I see nature can&#39;t even stop the most powerful loves.&quot; Shi giggled following them.<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------<br />
<br />
After a long drive to the Airport in Cairo, all of them walked through. Snowy in the lead. &quot;I need....&quot; Shi looked and started to count, &quot;One... two... ten tickets to Denver Colorado.&quot; Shi said softly. <br />
<br />
The attendant looked. &quot;Are you those who helped in Cairo?&quot; the attendant asked, before waiting an answer. &quot;I&#39;ve been given specific instructions from the President to escort you to his private aircraft to take home. As a personal gift and thanks for what you&#39;ve done. The pilots will fly you home, directly.&quot;<br />
<br />
She smiled leading the lot to the aircraft. To their surprise it was built specifically for chakats, or more modified. &quot;The president is taking advantage of all this and having his factories make aircrafts that are specifically designed to accomidate humans and kats. Now I must go. Enjoy your flight.&quot; She said walking out.<br />
<br />
In less than twenty hours the plane landed in Denver, where they had a vehicle waiting for them. Just as they got there they saw Jess...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
While all that was going on, Jess was in Washington there was enough people who donated their blood so that way they can make various types of vaccines. Shi even made some for the animals. Shi was happy to do so to stop this mad man from changing the world. Shi was very busy and very homesick. Shi looked up as shi made a new Vaccine, shi decided to call the Justin Vaccine 2.0. A vaccine that is ment to kill off the virus. Shi looked at the Sec Def, who examined. Jess, was thankful he didn&#39;t ask her to explain everything. Shi was tired, having to work day and night to perfect this vaccine enough that it can be sent throughout the country. Jess then made a massive batch to take home with hir to make for the ultimate vaccination. This shi had to call the other four in Hong Kong to meet hir at the Denver airport. Jess had given the Sec Def what he needed and they dismissed hir to be able to go home and rest.<br />
<br />
Jess was happy to be on the plane home. On the way home shi got word that the rest were headed home from Cairo, and decided shi&#39;d meet them there.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------<br />
<br />
They were happy to see Jess as shi pulled up. All hugged hir then they were on their way home. Shi drove until they were back on the ranch, to which Talia loved. Many reasons. It was beautiful, not as hot and dry as the desert, and it&#39;s peaceful. Midnight led hir to the room beside hirs and each of the others when to their own place. Sally first ran in to Charlie&#39;s room. Seeing hir nursing their kits put a smile on hir face. When shi walked up, shi noted Charlie was asleep. Shi sat on the floor and petted the kits, then shi looked down, ashamed of what happened. However regardless, shi was one who didn&#39;t believe in abortion, so either way shi would have hir pup. Should shi be pregnant. Shi then got up and walked into the clinic that they had there, and went to take a test. When shi seen it was a positive hir ears went flat. &quot;How am I going to explain this? I mean...&quot; Shi just broke down into tears.<br />
<br />
Nikole who was walking by seen Sally in tears. Shi walked up. &quot;Sally, dear, what&#39;s wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sally looked. &quot;Hi mum.&quot; Shi said, then explained what had happened in Cairo, then showed hir the strip.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hun, you may be pregnant from some rape thing, but if I know Charlie, shi won&#39;t hold that. Shi&#39;d love the pup as if shi is hir own. Trust me. Charlie ain&#39;t about to abandon you for something that wasn&#39;t your fault. Besides, I wager the little ones will be as cute as the others.&quot; Shi hugged Sally, who relaxed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope you&#39;re right Mum.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now since when have you been calling me mum?&quot; Shi teased.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, right now, you are the closest to a mom that I have. So might as well.&quot; shi said standing up.</p>
