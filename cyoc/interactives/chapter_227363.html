<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In the end, Monica wanted to make Damon happy.  She loved him with all her heart and if he wanted to breast feed from her for the rest of his days, then she&#39;d allow it.  She looked over to Madame Illusia and said, &quot;I&#39;ve thought about it.  I&#39;ll make Damon&#39;s desire come true.  I&#39;ll let him nurse from me and I&#39;ll even change his diapers.&quot;  Madame Illusia said nothing.  Instead, a comfortable looking bench appeared on stage and she guided the couple to sit on it.  Madame Illusia then asked Monica to unbutton her blouse while she magicked away most of Damon&#39;s clothes leaving him in nothing but his underwear, socks, and shoes.  After Monica removed her blouse exposing her bra, Madame Illusia asked, &quot;Are you ready?&quot;  The couple sitting on the bench simply nodded.  Madame Illusia addressed the crowd, &quot;Damon here wants to nurse from a goddess, so let&#39;s give him a goddess!&quot;  She then turned toward Monica and simply pointed a finger at her.  Monica grew taller, 7 feet three inches,  while her muscles toned up and grew stronger, though she still retained her feminine look.  Her breasts grew from size C to size DD as her skin tanned.  Monica&#39;s hair straightened out, developed a glowing sheen, and went from brunette to honey blonde.  Her eyes went from brown to emerald green.  Meanwhile, Monica&#39;s bra morphed from a lacy black bra to a more conservative looking pink maternity bra with detachable cups as a burp cloth appeared on Monica&#39;s shoulder.  Beside Monica, a pink diaper bag appeared fully stocked with spare diapers, diaper changing supplies, spare bottles, and a breast pump.  Madame then pointed over at Damon and said, &quot;It&#39;s time to change Damon.  Since he wants to nurse at his goddess&#39; breasts he needs to be shorter and have his digestive system changed so that he can enjoy his meals.  However, he also needs new clothes to accommodate his new eating habits.  Since he will no longer be able to control his bladder or his bowels, we need to give him some new underwear.&quot;  Damon&#39;s underwear took on a white color as it thickened up and developed a plastic backing.  A yellow stripe appeared down the center and through the crotch as the words &quot;Small Maximum&quot; in a dot matrix font repeated itself along the side of the stripe.  The diaper then split apart at the sides, formed wings with tapes and refastened itself back onto Damon completing itself.  Afterwards, a green terry bib with vinyl backing appeared out of thin air and wrapped itself around Damon&#39;s neck.  Afterwards, Madame pointed towards Damon and said, &quot;Now we need the physical changes.&quot;  Damon&#39;s body pubic and facial hair receded back into his skin as his penis shrank down to one inch long and a third of an inch in circumference.  His balls simply disappeared leaving a small empty ball sack.  Afterwards, Damon&#39;s size shrank from five feet, nine inches  down to four feet, two inches as his weight decreased down to 54 pounds.  Inside Damon&#39;s body, many things were changing.  Damon&#39;s teeth receded into his gums as his stomach adjusted itself to process Damon&#39;s new meals.  Damon&#39;s bladder shrank while his bladder and bowel muscles weakened.  Damon&#39;s brain was also changing.  Damon&#39;s knowledge of potty training, toilets, food, how to feed himself, clothing, personal hygiene and how to dress himself was completely disappearing while newborn instincts were returning.  Now, if Damon got hungry, he would cry, thrust his tongue out, smack his lips, and root to indicate he was hungry.  Damon&#39;s knowledge of sex and sexual urges diminished to newborn levels as his thoughts of Monica turned from wife to goddess, provider of food, and care taker.  Monica&#39;s brain also changed, she no longer thought of him as her husband, but though of him as her charge to be taken care of instead.  She no longer thought dirty diapers were disgusting and instead looked forward to changing is diapers, bathing and dressing him, and feeding him.  Meanwhile unknown to the couple, their house changed.  Damon no longer slept with Monica, but instead had his own room.  The house grew into a mansion while Monica mysteriously won the lottery and lost her job at the same time.  Of course, Damon also lost his job.  After Madame Illusia finished her job, Damon grew hungry.  He laid down on Monica&#39;s lap and started to smack his lips as he wimpered.  Monica, meanwhile, noticed Damon&#39;s actions and knew that he needed to be fed.  And so, she unclasped her bra and removed her right breast.  She then lifted Damon&#39;s torso so that Damon was looking at her breast and rubbed her breast against his cheek.  Damon latched on and greedily sucked on her glorious nipple, milk dribbling down his chin, and enjoyed his meal as he slowly got drowsy.  Madame, satisfied with her work, just let the couple nurse while she looked towards the audience to see if someone else wanted to join this couple.  She wanted to create a new family for Monica to enjoy.</p>
