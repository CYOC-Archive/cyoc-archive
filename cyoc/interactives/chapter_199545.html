<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Feeling her body impregnate itself made Eve hornier and she stuck her fingers back in her pussy. she couldn&#39;t get the image of herself being hugely swollen with children out of her mind and came again falling to her knees whimpering as she felt another egg release and joined the first. The hormones that were getting her pregnant were also fueling her seemingly endless need creating a feedback loop. She came over and over each time having a stronger orgasm and each time adding another child she would give birth to. Finally after cumming 6 times she squirted one last time passing out in a puddle of her own juices. She was pregnant with a total of 7 kids. She was given the knowledge that her pregnancies would only last 9 days and that they would bring her great pleasure.<br />
<br />
9 days later<br />
Eve spent the first couple of days of her pregnancy tending to the garden and naming all the animals like God had instructed but after that her belly had gotten so big it made those tasks a lot harder. she had to drain her breasts 10 times a day or they would hurt and leak everywhere. Now she looked like a fertility goddess with how huge her belly and breasts had gotten. She layed on the ground with her legs spread leaking large amounts of pussy juice. Luckily she had told her it would be 1 day after the pregnancy before she could get pregnant again but that it could only happen when her body felt a need to breed. <br />
<br />
Currently she was having contractions back to back as her babies worked their way out of her womb. Each contraction brought her huge amounts of pleasure and she was basically having back to back orgasms. God had sent down several angels to help with any complications with birthing and to help take care of her many kids. He had told Eve that he would send as many as he needed as long as humanity kept multiplying and expanding the garden and that if they did that eventually they could take care of themselves without his direct intervention.<br />
<br />
Once the last child left her Eve had one last especially strong orgasm causing her to squirt everywhere and feel exhausted. The angels cleaned the babies of Eve&#39;s juices and put one by each of her tits while they breastfeed the rest of them. Eve couldn&#39;t help but notice that 2 of her kids had penises above their vagina&#39;s. &quot;why do some of them have that?&quot; eve asked one of the angels<br />
<br />
&quot;God thinks that diversification is key to humanity&#39;s survival so he made it so that although all humans are females some have penises as well. so the next generation can choose to be impregnated or do so through parthenogenesis.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eve smiled at that imagining girls all around her fucking and having hugely swollen bellies. It made her pussy incredibly wet. She was sad that she would have to wait until tomorrow to get pregnant again.<br />
<br />
8 years later<br />
<br />
Hanna and Suzzy were playing together in part of the garden laughing and enjoying life. They had been part of the first children that Eve had given birth to. Hanna had a cock like around &#8531; of the girls in the garden did. They had been told by some of the angels that they would feel an urge to breed soon. This was deemed “going into heat” which currently was something only Eve did but now that it had been 8 years soon her children would feel the urge too. <br />
<br />
Hanna watched as Suzzy bent over to pick a flower. Her perky ass on full display. Hanna felt her cock give a twitch and started to feel a little uncomfortable. She walked up and gave Suzzy a hug from behind. Suzzy smiled. “You felt it too huh” she said turning around and kissing her sister on the lips pushing her onto the ground<br />
<br />
“The angels said to just follow our instincts right?” Hanna asked.<br />
<br />
“Ya and right now my instincts are screaming for me to have your cock inside me.” Suzzy said panting and lining Hanna’s 12 in cock with her tiny hole.she slowly lowered herself and let out a high pitched moan. <br />
<br />
Hanna was moaning as well as she started to thrust up into Suzzy’s pussy causing her to gasp in pleasure. “I might cum and get pregnant just from riding this thing.” Suzzy said slowly bouncing up and down. <br />
<br />
Hanna thrusted into her, matching her pace as they slowly built up speed. “Then I&#39;ll just have to make you even more pregnant with my cock. I’ll fill you with more babies than mommy had 2 years ago when she couldn’t move from it.” <br />
<br />
Suzzy’s pussy clenched at the thought of that. She bounced faster and faster until she felt Hanna slam into her cervix which caused her to cry out in pleasure. Hanna didn’t stop though and slammed right on through and that set her off causing her to squirt down Hanna’s cock and an egg to be released. This flooded her brain with hormones and made her wildly more horny. She layed down and pulled Hanna on top of her. Hanna waisted now, smashing into the back of her fertile womb. Hanna came into her sister’s womb as Suzzy’s pussy spasmed from another orgasm. After cumming Hanna’s cock was still hard so she kept going. <br />
<br />
Hanna passed out next to her sister last night after cumming in her multiple times. Every time she came she had felt her pussy cumming as well meaning she was probably also pregnant with her own litter of kids hanna looked around the garden and saw a few of the kids had went into heat last night and been fucked or masterbated until they passed out from exhaustion. She knew it wouldn’t be long before the garden would be full of humans as civilization started taking off.</p>
