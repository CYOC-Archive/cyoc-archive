<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Doug now made his way out into the hall, if memory served him correctly than he and Nancy had a free period together. Scanning the bustling hallway though, he frowned. Nancy was nowhere in sight. &quot;Weird,&quot; he thought as he made his way through the crowd.<br />
<br />
Doug now began to search his memories, trying to figure out where she could have gone. So caught up in his thoughts, he wasn&#39;t paying attention as he now collided with someone rounding the corner. Stumbling, the teen now blushed, offering an apology before noticing who he had bumped into.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sharon?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sharon was blushing crimson, the young teen gathering up her belongings as she gazed at Doug. &quot;S..s..sorry,&quot; she stammered. Doug now knelt down, helping the flummoxed girl gather her things before helping her to her feet. &quot;Its okay,&quot; he smiled. &quot;It was my fault.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sharon now gave the teen a small smile, her cheeks still rosey as Doug assisted her to her feet. As he studied the girl he could tell she was obviously smitten with him. A contented smile, a long sigh, and her glazed over eyes gave Doug the impression of a girl experiencing her first crush. This hypothesis only strengthened as she noticed Doug holding her hand in wide eyed horror. Quickly pulling her hand back, Doug now watched the girl nervously avoid eye contact as she pushed her hair behind her ears.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everything okay Sharon you seem tense.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Everything&#39;s cool,&quot; she squeaked. Doug smirked, how was this attractive girl so socially awkward. How could Nancy have even thought Sharon was a mean girl. Before he could ask Sharon anymore questions, the pair were interrupted by Nancy&#39;s arrival. &quot;There you are,&quot; she sighed. &quot;Sorry but this one here needed to pee. AGAIN!&quot;  Doug now glanced behind Nancy, noticing the very shy Johnny hiding behind his teenage sister.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey your Sharon right,&quot; Nancy asked. Sharon paled, the teens eyes wide with fright as she nodded. &quot;Um yeah,&quot; she stammered. &quot;I..um..I...I gotta go. Nice to met you!&quot; Without another word, Sharon now bolted down the hall, leaving Doug, Nancy, and Johnny alone. &quot;Weird,&quot; Nancy said softly. &quot;Whats her deal?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s shy,&quot; Doug stated. &quot;And kind of awkward. And I think she has a crush on me.&quot; Nancy frowned, taking a deep breath before exhaling and chuckling softly. &quot;Okay wow that was weird.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Nancy blushed. &quot;When you said she had a crush on you, the younger me got super jealous and possessive. Like, who does this girl think she is liking my boyfriend and oh my God what if Doug like her? She&#39;s super hot!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay that&#39;s weird yeah but I don&#39;t have a crush on her,&quot; Doug laughed. &quot;Still, kind of funny. How on Earth could you think she was a mean girl?&quot; Nancy simply shrugged, it made no sense. &quot;So Johnny had to use the bathroom,&quot; Doug asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;He always seems to have to use the bathroom,&quot; Nancy groaned. &quot;I swear it&#39;s like he has a bladder the size of a walnut and then he gets super scared whenever he goes in. I&#39;ve had to walk into the boys bathroom twice already to act as his bodyguard.&quot; Doug paused, something felt amiss about all of this. A supposed mean girl reduced to a socially awkward teen, a former teacher who had embarrassed Doug about useing the bathroom, now reduced to a 7 year old with a tiny and shy bladder. It couldn&#39;t be a coincidence, could it?<br />
<br />
&quot;What,&quot; Nancy asked. &quot;What is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Follow me,&quot; Doug said solemnly. Nancy simply nodded, taking Johnny&#39;s hand as Doug led them to an empty classroom. Handing over her cellphone to keep Johnny occupied, Doug and Nancy now moved to the rear of the classroom, lowering their voices so as not to be heard by Nancy&#39;s newly minted kid brother. &quot;I think we maybe unconsciously affecting the wishes,&quot; Doug said softly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh how?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Think about it for a second Nancy,&quot; Doug said softly. &quot;Sharon, you said she was kind of a bitch before I made my wish.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah but I don&#39;t remember her now,&quot; Nancy replied. &quot;I don&#39;t even remember saying that to you beforehand.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I do,&quot; Doug stated. &quot;What if what you said to me influenced my wish. I mean think about it? Why would a girl that hot be that shy and that awkward?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You think she&#39;s hot,&quot; Nancy frowned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thats not the point,&quot; Doug groaned. &quot;What I&#39;m saying is this. How often do you think a high school girl that&#39;s, for lack of a better term, cute acts like a complete wallflower, is socially awkward, and doesn&#39;t flaunt her beauty?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nancy paused, it was out of the ordinary. Their could be other explanations though. Sharon may have just sprouted into a cute girl, she could have low self esteem, maybe some body issues. &quot;Okay maybe,&quot; she said. &quot;But that&#39;s only one example.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about your brothers?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dickie and Johnny,&quot; Nancy asked, raising an eyebrow. &quot;What about them?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Doug stated. &quot;Remember what I said about Johnny before I went back to class?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah you were pissed at him,&quot; Nancy shrugged. &quot;Cause he embarrassed you about having to go pee.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And now Johnny pees more than a cocker spaniel.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nancy balked, turning to gaze at the small boy sitting at the front of the class. Could they be subconsciously affecting the people they changed? Watching Johnny carefully, she could see the boy beginning to squirm in his seat. A telltale sign that it was only a matter of time before he would ask to use the bathroom again. Memories of Johnny and his shy bladder flooded her mind. Whenever Johnny got nervous, his bladder seemed to magically shrink to thimble size.  &quot;No way,&quot; she gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;And don&#39;t forget about Dickie,&quot; Doug added. &quot;You may not remember him but Coach Dick was....well...kind of a racist dick. I wished him back to preschool after he said some really nasty things to Luis.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait hold on Dickie hated Luis,&quot; Nancy exclaimed. &quot;No way! Whenever I bring him to practice and Luis is around he follows him around like a puppy. He loves Luis!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah now he does,&quot; Doug added. &quot;What if when I made the wish I subconsciously changed him. What if all the wishes I&#39;ve made subtly changed everybody.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You think it happened to us too?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably,&quot; Doug shrugged. &quot;I mean I know when I was a teenager the first time I wasn&#39;t in band and you told me you were never a cheerleader. Maybe, maybe subconsciously we&#39;re influencing these wishes to change things more than we thought.&quot;<br />
<br />
Doug shrugged, the two teens now gazing at the coin. If they were going to make more wishes they would need to be more careful with how they went about it.</p>
