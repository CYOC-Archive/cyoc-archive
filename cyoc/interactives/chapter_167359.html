<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Taylor, wake up!  You are late for breakfast!&quot; yelled Dion&#39;s mom outside his door<br />
&quot;Coming mom!  Jeeze!&quot; replied Dion.  Since when do I say Jeeze?<br />
Dion rolled out of bed and put his feet onto the plush carpet.  Was it this plush before? <br />
On standing, he was shaken out of his reverie, but the shaking on his chest<br />
Running to the mirror, with breasts bouncing along the way, he took stock of his room.  There was no doubt a girl lived in this room.  There was a full length mirror, a small vanity and a desk.  The posters were of what Dion guessed were popular boys on the Disney Channel.  The closet was bigger, now a double door instead of a single one.  His bedframe was the same purple as his shirt from yesterday.  Looking in the mirror, he was all girl.  His long light brown hair was almost to his waist, which was a little thinner than when he went to bed.  His boobs were bigger than last night too.  Massive to him, since he didn&#39;t have any hope of hiding them.  He pulled down his jeans to see from frilly underwear that was still flat in the front, just like yesterday.  <br />
He couldn&#39;t bear to look at himself in the mirror any longer.  He walked away to his underwear drawer, which now had bras.  Looks like 32B, whatever that meant.  He noted all the panties were colored in some way.  He took the pair he thought was blandest, and put it on.  He also grabbed a bra at random and stared at it.  They he stared around the room a little more.  Walking to the closet, his body put the bra on while on autopilot.  It wasn&#39;t until he open the double doors to his closet that he realized it was on.  <br />
&quot;How&#39;d that happen?&quot; thought Dion.<br />
He chose the least colorful clothing in his larger closet, grabbed a pair of non-frilly socks and some sneakers.  He opened the door and saw Holly.<br />
&quot;Hey Taylor, how&#39;s it going?&quot;<br />
&quot;What&#39;s your game Holly?&quot;<br />
&quot;What do you mean, can&#39;t a girl say hi to her sister?  You&#39;re in a mood.  Have you started the change to womanhood or something?&quot;<br />
Dion just gave a look of confusion back.<br />
&quot;Your period, goofball.  I got my first one when I was about 12.  I&#39;ve hand them regularly for about a year now, so I can help you if you want.  It was weird talking about it with mom.&quot;<br />
Dion changed his confused look to one of shock.<br />
&quot;You OK over there Taylor?&quot;<br />
&quot;Sure...  Are you really not messing with me?&quot;<br />
&quot;Not in the least sister.  We girls gotta stick together.&quot;  said Holly as she walked off to breakfast.<br />
Dion just watched his 14 year sister walk away, and realized that she was not messing with him.  She had forgotten she had a brother.  His mom had called him Taylor as well.  He was back to being Denise Taylor again, and now no one remembered him as him, but only as her.  <br />
He went downstairs for breakfast.  While everything was strange to him, the family acted like nothing was wrong.  He mechanically ate his eggs, and asked to be excused.<br />
&quot;You can go, young lady, but make sure you brush your hair.  It&#39;s a mess, &quot;replied his mother.<br />
he went upstairs to the bathroom, brushed his teeth and then went to the vanity.  He started to brush his hair and hum a tune.  He caught himself at that moment.  He didn&#39;t realize what he was huming, but it was a Selena Gomez song.  Satisfied his hair looked OK, he got up and went downstairs.  He and Holly walked to the bus stop and parted ways to be with their friends.<br />
Dion went to sit with Davis and Henry, but was flagged down by Brianna.  He knew who she was, but hadn&#39;t talked much to her before, since she was a girl.  He couldn&#39;t get away, and they sat together.  Brianna started to talk about some new nail polish her mom got her, some clothing and finally some TV she saw.  Finally, something Dion knew something about.  Thankfully, both Brie and Dion liked Phineas and Ferb.  This then parleyed into the powerpuff girls.  They were having a full debate about which of the 3 was the most powerful when they were getting off the bus.  The matter was tabled when they got to homeroom.  They hugged eachother and went to their desks.  Only then did Dion realize, he had only ever watched 1 episode and didn&#39;t know that much about it.  How&#39;d he have a conversation about it for 15 minutes?<br />
First period was math, which went OK, then then moved classrooms.  Dion didn&#39;t know where to go.  When he was 10, they stayed in the same room the whole day.  Brie helped him get to class.  There joined by Terri, a shy girl that was good friends with Brie, and apparently Dion as well.  English was about grammar rules he didn&#39;t know when he was in 5th grade, but were expected to be known by a 7th grader.  Then came social studies, reading, lunch and &quot;free time.&quot;<br />
Finally, recess.    Only, no one was running around.  They were just hanging out in groups talking.  Terri and Brie were talking about their lipstick, and Dion made an offhand remark about how good his Plum tube is at home.    Brie asked if she could trade if for her Mint lipgloss, and Dion agreed.   Dion then got lost in his thoughts.  How did he know what color Plum was?  He had lipstick, wasn&#39;t it lip gloss yesterday?<br />
&quot;Earth to Taylor,&quot; said Brie<br />
&quot;She&#39;s probably thinking about Henry,&quot; said Terri<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; grunted Dion<br />
&quot;Isn&#39;t he coming over?  You have been good friends for years.  You wanted to have him over tonight for some...you know.&quot; said Terri, blushing<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; grunted Dion again<br />
&quot;That is getting old, Taylor.   You told us how you thought he was cute yesterday when we spoke.  You had just called him, and then you called us.  You are so lucky that your parents are OK with that.  My parents would have a lecture for me if I tried something like that,&quot; explained Brie.<br />
Dion realized that instead of a sleepover, Henry was coming over for a DATE!<br />
The rest of the school day was a blur.  Somehow he finished the day and got home.<br />
Walking in the door, his mother gestured to come over to talk to her<br />
&quot;Denise Taylor, we should talk.&quot;<br />
Uh oh, back when he was a boy, Dion knew that using the first and middle name meant trouble.  Dion saw down and crossed his legs, then uncrossed them<br />
&quot;Dear, you are having a boy over tonight.  I&#39;ve talked with his mom, and he should be on his best behavior.  If he does anything that makes you feel uncomfortable, you come to me immediately.  If you got to your room, leave the door open.  Boys need to treat girls with respect, and if they don&#39;t, they should be punished, understand?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes mom.&quot;<br />
&quot;I know this is your first date, and I&#39;m glad you are having it at home rather that at a movie theater or something.  That way I can help if you have questions about anything.  Speaking of questions, did you have anything you wanted to ask now?&quot;<br />
&quot;Mom, what else about me is going to change?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, you will get taller, your going to have more complex emotions, your breasts will get bigger...&quot;  At that point, Dion spaced out.<br />
&quot;I can see this is a bit much, so we can talk about puberty another time.  Your sister and I had that same talk around your age, when she started to have her cycle.  All the changes are natural, so just accept them as they come along.&quot;<br />
Dion actually felt a little better after that, for some reason. He then went up to his room to get ready for her date.<br />
She went to the vanity and did her hair again, brushed her teeth and got the Plum lipstick almost to her mouth when she stopped.  <br />
&quot;What am I doing?&quot; thought Dion, &quot;I&#39;m just having Henry over to turn back into a guy.  I shouldn&#39;t be doing this girly stuff&quot;<br />
With that, he got to thinking about how he could turn into a guy.  Could he have Henry take over his shirt and then use that?  Maybe he could keep a sock somehow?  Then came the knock at the door.<br />
&quot;Taylor, Henry is here!&quot; Yelled Holly up the stairs.  Dion came running to the stairs, then realized he was bouncing and then walked down them more slowly.<br />
&quot;Hey Henry, &quot; said Dion, putting some hair behind his ears.<br />
&quot;Hey Taylor.  I brought these,&quot; said Henry as he gave her some flower.<br />
&quot;How sweet, thanks!&quot; replied Dion, blushing.  &quot;Come in and let&#39;s hang out or do you want to do something outside before dinner?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, that sounds great.&quot;<br />
With that, Taylor&#39;s mom grabbed the flowers and put them in a vase while Henry and Dion went for a walk.  Dion noted that Henry was wearing a backpack, which was odd since he couldn&#39;t spend the night anymore. <br />
&quot;It was so much fun back when Henry could sleep over.  We play until dark, then tell jokes until we fell asleep, then I turned 10 and mom didn&#39;t want him sleeping over any more.  I guess I understand a little now,&quot; thought Dion.  Then he thought, &quot;He could sleep over tonight if I were a boy, why did I think he couldn&#39;t sleep over after I was 10?&quot;  Dion then realized, that his mind was being affected too.  He started to take some deep breaths to calm down, when he felt a hand grab his.<br />
Dion looked down and saw that Henry was holding his hand.  It felt weird to hold another boys hand, but it felt comforting too.  His old friend was literally reaching out when Dion felt worried.  he blushed again.<br />
&quot;What&#39;s in the backpack?&quot; asked Dion after he calmed<br />
&quot;It&#39;s the new football jersey you asked for on the phone last night.&quot;<br />
So reality left that alone.  There was a light at the end of the tunnel.  Dion was saved!  After a few more minutes outside, they went into the house.  They said hi to Taylor&#39;s mother and went up to her room and left the door open.<br />
&quot;Mind giving me the jersey now, so I don&#39;t forget?&quot; asked Dion<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; he reached into the backpack and passed Taylor the jersey, which she put under the bed<br />
&quot;Want to watch something until dinner?&quot; asked Dion<br />
&quot;Sure, what are you thinking?&quot;<br />
&quot;Powerpuff girls?&quot;<br />
&quot;Na, not my thing.  How about we play a game?&quot;<br />
&quot;What are you thinking?&quot;<br />
&quot;Do you have any board games?  Yahtzee or something.<br />
&quot;I have cards?  Does that work for you?&quot;<br />
&quot;Sounds great, let&#39;s play some poker, I&#39;ll deal.&quot;<br />
They played a few hands, when Henry spoke up<br />
&quot;Want to make it more interesting, Taylor?&quot;<br />
&quot;What are you thinking?&quot;<br />
&quot;The winner gets to ask a question of the loser, and the loser had to answer truthfully.&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m in,&quot; replied Dion.  He was good at poker<br />
The first few hands were all in Tayler&#39;s favor.  She now knew Henry&#39;s favorite band, color and TV show.  Then Dion realized he know all that stuff, but Taylor wouldn&#39;t.  He had to focus on staying Dion until he could use the Jersey.<br />
&quot;Ha!  I win one!&quot; exclaimed Henry.  Dion wasn&#39;t focusing as much because he needed to focus on keeping reality straight in his mind.<br />
&quot;Taylor, did you like holding my hand?&quot; <br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; replied Dion truthfully.  The support the gesture provided felt good<br />
Henry won the next hand too.<br />
&quot;Taylor, do you like me?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; replied Dion.  He liked Henry, he was a good friend.<br />
Dion won the next hand<br />
&quot;Henry, what would you do if you were a girl?&quot;<br />
Henry thought for a second, &quot;I have to answer truthfully?  I would probably go into the girls lockerroom and see if they really have stalls.&quot;<br />
&quot;They do, Henry.  I can vouch for that.&quot;<br />
Dion won again<br />
&quot;What if you were a girl, but couldn&#39;t turn back into a guy?&quot;<br />
&quot;Taylor, you ask some weird questions.   I&#39;d probably have to get used to it.  I think it would be fun for a little while, the novelty of it.  But as I got further from my original life, I think I would get sad.  I hope I would get used to it, I mean I never really thought about that.&quot;<br />
Henry won the next hand<br />
&quot;Taylor, what would you do if you were a boy?&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;d run without these breasts in the way, and have more comfortable clothing.&quot; replied Dion<br />
&quot;That&#39;s funny, Taylor.  Your clothes look great and so do you breasts...oops&quot; replied Henry<br />
Taylor blushed, Henry has been looking at her breasts.<br />
&quot;Henry, since we are friends, and you don&#39;t have a pair of your own, you can touch mine&quot; whispered Taylor.<br />
Henry&#39;s eyes went wide.  Taylor took his hand and put it to her left breast.  Henry&#39;s hand went from limp to squeezing in a split second.  Taylor was happy Henry was interested in her.  They had some much in common and Henry liked her body too.  This was a great date.<br />
Dion then snapped back and realized his good friend was groping him.  He pushed the hand away.  He had lost control for minutes that time.  <br />
&quot;Kids!  Dinnertime!&quot;  <br />
Dion and Henry got off the floor where they were playing cards, and other things.  They walked down the stairs.  Henry trying to grab Taylor&#39;s hand, but Dion pushed Henry away.<br />
Dinner was a collection of pleasantries.   Henry asked how people were doing and Dion&#39;s family asked about how Henry and his family were doing.  Soon the meal was over, and Henry mom picked him up.  Dion waved goodbye at the door<br />
&quot;How&#39;d it go, Taylor?&quot; asked his mom<br />
&quot;It went OK.  We both had a good time.&quot;<br />
&quot;Not too good of a time I hope...&quot; his mom said looking at Dion carefully.<br />
&quot;Everything went great mom, thanks for asking.&quot;<br />
With that Dion went upstairs and back to his room.  He took out the unworn Jersey and the medallion in the bag. He closed his door, and touched the medallion to the jersey.</p>
