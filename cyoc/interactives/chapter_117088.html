<br />
After much time spent deciding what he would do, Rowan finally made a choice.  If he was to become a ruler of everything, as Zebulon said, he should start by ruling a kingdom.  The sleepless nights Rowan had were all spent reading, expanding his wealth of knowledge, and deciding what he would do for the rest of his eternity.  While he was never a fan of the politics of being nobility, when he was before his awakening, he felt that this was the right way to go.  The only question was how.  How would he take over a whole kingdom?  Which one?  It took an excruciatingly long time for him to realize the easy choice.  Take over Kelper.  He lives there already!  Might as well return the capital to its original, historic location too!  Rowan wasn&#39;t going to give up his commandeered castle, especially without telling you.  There was a huge, empty area of land near the castle, where Porentia used to be.  Magic up a city, and boom!  New capital!<br />
<br />
After taking a day to make plans for his takeover of Kelper, Rowan was ready.  He walked out of his castle, and felt the cool, mid-autumn breeze flow through his long, flowing, dark auburn hair.  He started off his plan by preparing his capital city of Porentia.  He never used his rendering magic on this large of a scale before, but considering his significant power boost from Zebulon&#39;s gift, he thought it would be fine.  With both hands raised high into the air, and his golden ring shining brightly, Rowan crafted a capital city next to his large, imposing castle.  Buildings, markets, streets, and many other city components appeared out of thin air in the crater that was once a dense, nearly deserted forest.  Within minutes, a booming metropolis was created.  The only thing it was missing was people.  &quot;Soon.&quot;  He told himself, exploring his newly built city.  &quot;Kelper will be mine.&quot;  He laughed evilly as he summoned his demonic wings and flew off to the capital of Kelper.<br />
<br />
The flight was a long one.  Flying across an entire kingdom, even for someone as powerful as Rowan, takes a considerable amount.  He could have teleported, but where is the fun in that?  As he landed in the square in front of the castle, people around him started to scream in terror.  &quot;IT&#39;S ROWAN TYRELL!!!  EVERYONE RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!!!&quot;  Someone yelled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please people.&quot;  Rowan smiled calmly.  &quot;I am not here for violence.  Far from it.&quot;  People did not hear his statement, as they continued running as quickly as they could away.  &quot;Like running from me would change anything.&quot;  Rowan chuckled, looking at the large castle in front of him.  &quot;Time to see a familiar face.&quot;  Rowan smiled as he calmly walked towards the castle&#39;s gate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Freeze!&quot;  The guard yelled.  &quot;Entry to the royal palace is prohibited!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you know who I am?&quot;  The demonic looking Rowan asked intimidatingly.  &quot;Judging by what you just said, you don&#39;t.&quot;  The guard started shaking, realizing the intimidating, yet calm Rowan&#39;s threatening existence.  &quot;You are very lucky that I&#39;m trying to turn a new leaf, otherwise, you&#39;d be dead too quickly for you to even know I existed.  Let me in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I cannot.&quot;  The guard cried.  &quot;My king has prohibited any visitors.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I&#39;ll let myself in.&quot;  Rowan laughed as he pushed the guard away with enough force to knock him back 15 feet.  He then stood in front of the large gate.   While it would be easy to fly over, Rowan wanted to have some fun.  What&#39;s the point of being demonically strong if you never use that strength?  With a simple shove, the gates of the castle flew off of their hinges.  The guard, now lying on the ground in his suit of armor, started to quiver in fear.  Rowan, with his enhanced hearing, could hear the rattling of the armor.  He continued to laugh as he telekinetically lowered the drawbridge into the castle.  Once it was fully lowered, he proceeded into the castle, ready to see someone he had not seen in many years.  A former friend of his.<br />
<br />
Rowan traversed through the castle, figuring out his way through every nook and cranny of the place.  Eventually, he found his way to the entrance to the throne room.  The doors were ornately decorated, and soon to be open.  Rowan shoved the doors open, and found an elderly man sitting on the throne, surrounded by many other people ranging in ages.  Small children were playing together around the hall, adults were talking together, and food was being eaten.  When Rowan walked in, he noticed all of the festivities cease.  &quot;Hello there King Kelper.  It&#39;s been a long time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Rowan?&quot;  He asked feebly.  &quot;Why are you here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s simple really.&quot;  Rowan smiled, flying towards the throne, stopping right before it.  &quot;It&#39;s time that the rules of Kelper changed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot;  The old man asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s time the rule of Kelper changed hands.&quot;  Rowan started.  &quot;Changed families.&quot;  The crowd of people around him started to talk amongst themselves.  Rowan overheard people questioning what their status would be.  &quot;Is this your family?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;  The king replied.  &quot;Four generations of my family are gathered in this room.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s nice.  I have no family anymore.  Ever since that day...&quot;  Rowan sighed.  &quot;I still have nightmares about that day.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay Rowan.  I heard that you&#39;ve obtained a familiar.  He can fill that void.&quot;  The king smiled in a friendly tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;He already has.&quot;  Rowan smiled.  &quot;I promised myself that I would change.  I wouldn&#39;t be the evil destroyer of kingdoms anymore.  Fate has guided me to this place, to start my rule of Kelper.  I promised myself that no people would be harmed in this takeover.  Unfortunately, due to my lack of knowledge of my own strength, I injured your guard.  I want to keep the kingdom peaceful.  This wanton destruction that I&#39;ve caused will cease, and a new era of peace will grace the world.  I only ask you to allow me to take your place as King of Kelper.&quot;  Rowan spoke elegantly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Allow me some time to think this over.&quot;  The king replied.  He took to his throne, and thought.  His family joined in and it became a full discussion.  Too bad they didn&#39;t know just how powerful Rowan was.  He secretly used his magic of manipulation to persuade the king into giving him the kingdom, and moving the capital to Porentia.  It was a good day.<br />
<br />
November 30, 695<br />
<br />
Rowan sat comfortable in his throne.  Word spread through the kingdom that he&#39;d peacefully taken control of the kingdom.  Many people were very angry at this fact.  Who would want to live under the rule of an evil sorcerer like Rowan?  Many people were so infuriated that they came to Rowan&#39;s castle to challenge his authority.  While Rowan wanted to be a good king, a king for the people, he still had to quash rebellions.  And with his power, he could do it with a snap of his finger.  In some cases, he did.  One group of people tried to storm his castle, armed with nothing but small swords and shields.  Rowan shot each one with a bolt of lightning.  They were exterminated like flies.  It came to pass that Rowan thought humans less as the living beings they were and more as pitiful mortals with power akin to a fly.  They were his pawns.  Nothing more.  He needed to develop a strategy to have his pawns obey him.  He&#39;s tried public appearances, yet they did not go well.  He was greeted with many screams of derision and anger.  He&#39;d almost given up on making the people like him.  They needed to respect him instead.<br />
<br />
December 8, 695<br />
<br />
&quot;Master?&quot;  You started.  &quot;I think my dragons can help you gain the respect you need.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s more than true.&quot;  Rowan smiled.  &quot;Tomorrow, discuss with your dragons the plans for quelling the anger in Kelper.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Will do.&quot;  You started, before being interrupted by a yawn.  &quot;I think I&#39;m going to sleep.  Good night Master.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good night Gannoth.&quot;  Rowan smiled, ceasing the head petting.  &quot;I&#39;ll wake you up when I need you.  For now, rest.&quot;  Rowan smiled as he left the room, presumably to read some more.  You closed your eyes, and drifted off into slumber.<br />
<br />
The next day, Rowan woke you up at a comfortable time.  You let out a big, draconic yawn, before switching to your human form.  After breakfast, you flew over to your draconic kingdom, where Izedin was waiting for you.  &quot;My Lord.  Where have you been?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve been with my Master.&quot;  You answered.  &quot;Sorry to have you concerned.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is fine My Lord.&quot;  Izedin responded.  &quot;Is there anything you need me to do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.  I&#39;d like you to spread word around the kingdom to have all of the dragons congregate here.  I need to give a speech.&quot;  You stated.  &quot;Also, I think I need to get back into dragon form.&quot;  You laughed as you became a 50 foot tall dragon.  &quot;Much...  more draconic.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You prefer being in your human form, don&#39;t you My Lord?&quot;  Izedin chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...&quot;  You laughed.  &quot;As I said, it&#39;s much more convenient.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll take my leave now.&quot;  Izedin said, bowing his head to his king, and leaving.  You were alone once more, practicing the speech you were soon to give to your subjects.  You were going to quell Kelper&#39;s newly forged tensions, and you knew just how to do it.<br />
