<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kat pointed the wand at Dan and began to recite something from the book. Worried, Dan tied to stop his sister, but found that for some reason he could not speak or move. As Kat chanted more and more, a blue light began to form at the tip of the wand. As the light grew, the colour began to shift so that it in the end was blended with a pink colour.<br />
<br />
The light shot out of the wand and engulfed Dan and he silently wondered what Kat had changed him into. Looking at Kat, who had shut the book and put the wand somewhere, Dan asked with a hint of trepidation, &quot;What did you do?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kat grinned at this and replied nonchalantly, &quot;You&#39;ll find out over the next couple of days. In fact, I&#39;d say that your transformation will start probably when you wake-up tomorrow. Will it be something horrible? Something fun? Who knows. Enjoy.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that said, she turned and left the room, a single thought on her mind; one that guaranteed Dan would not be able to get the best of her and use the book and wand against her.<br />
<br />
Dan watched his sister leave the room and suddenly he wanted tell mom or his dad, but he figured that if he did, Kat would find some way to not only punish him some more, but also alter his parents memories so that they knew nothing of what Kat had done and think his transformation was normal. Sighing, he asked himself, &quot;What did I do to deserve this,&quot; as he headed up to his room to start on his homework.<br />
-----<br />
<br />
The evening passed without incident. Mom and Dad took them out for dinner at a nice restaurant and then home afterward. There, Kat opened her presents and the family had cake. Afterward Kat disappeared over to one of her friends and returned a half hour later with her friend.<br />
<br />
Dan avoided her and stayed in his room for the rest of the night. Around ten, he dressed in his pajamas and went to bed. Next door Kat and her friend where giggling about something.<br />
<br />
In the morning, Dan awoke, and looking himself over figured that Kat was just trying to scare him. Deciding that his sister had no magick powers, Dan headed for the bathroom. Afterward he returned and opened his dresser. Only what he saw made him stop, because where his normal clothes where usually, the dresser was now filled with clothes for a girl.<br />
<br />
Taking out a pair of black jeans that was all one piece in the front, had an elastic band in the back and a button was sewn in place to give the illusion that they unbuttoned, he left his room and headed for his sister&#39;s room.<br />
<br />
Opening the door, he strolled over to his sister&#39;s bed, almost tripping over her friend, and gently tapping her, Dan said, &quot;Wake up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kat slowly opened her eyes, making noises about being woken up so early. Upon seeing Dan inside her room, she was immediately awake and growing defensive she told him, &quot;Get out here you pervert. You know you don&#39;t belong in my room.&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking at his sister, Dan retorted back with, &quot;Give me back my clothes! Why&#39;d you stuff my dresser full of your stuff?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kat looked at her brother and then said with an evil look on her face, &quot;You know very well that stuff is yours. You wore it yesterday and the day before that. All your life in fact because it&#39;s your normal wardrobe. Now, if you don&#39;t leave right now, I&#39;m going to get my wand and book and make your transformation worse. We could have suckling pig for dinner.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan looked at Kat&#39;s friend who was still asleep and then threw his arms up in disgust. Not seeing a way to win this, he started to leave. He was just at the door when Kat said, &quot;Have a good day at school, Dan. Oh, and for the record, woman in our family become witches, but you&#39;ll find that you have been excluded from such practice,&quot; and then she began to laugh.<br />
<br />
Dan turned around and was about to say something, when Kat&#39;s friend began to stir. Not wanting to create a ruckus in front of her, Dan turned and left.<br />
<br />
Back in his room, he searched the dresser and closet, but it was no use because all of his clothes had become girl&#39;s clothes and a few costumes. Upset with what Kat had done, Dan sat down on the bed and looked at the jeans he was still holding. Figuring his mom would say something, he went to his dresser and began to pull clothes out.<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s one thing I&#39;ll never wear,&quot; Dan told himself as he looked at the briefs inside his dresser.<br />
<br />
Taking out a pair of Bobby Socks with pink lace around the top part, Dan sat down on the bed and began to dress.  From the second drawer, he pulled out a purple t-shirt with a pink star in the middle with the words &#39;Girls Rock&#39; printed in the center of the star. Really disgusted with how cute it looked, Dan put it on.<br />
<br />
Next he put on the pants, which turned out to be really tight in the crotch. Looking over the whole ensemble, he noticed that there was for some reason there was a hole in the back, as if the owner ripped the pants or had a tail. &quot;Why is that there,&quot; Dan asked himself, but no answer came as to why the pants where designed like this. With a hint of dread mixed with hope that his parents would say something, he headed down to breakfast.<br />
<br />
At the table, his mother and father didn&#39;t say anything about the way he was dressed, instead his mother pinned a pink bow in his hair, kissed him on the cheek and as she handed him a light purple jacket with a pink liner, she told him, &quot;Have a good day at school, Cathy.&quot;<br />
<br />
This bothered him even more and slipping on a pair of high tops, he let himself out the door to wait for the bus, asking himself, &quot;How can things get any weirder?&quot;</p>
