<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>the person who wrote the last part got Sam&#39;s bodys age wrong with Sam&#39;s body being 10 years old and not 8, </div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As I stepped into the warm embrace of the shower, I let the water wash away the tension of confronting Sam in my body. As the water fell down my body, I thort what the rest of the day had in store for me.<br />
<br />
Once I finished my shower and dried myself off, I headed downstairs to join Sam, who was now occupying my body, at the breakfast table. The aroma of freshly brewed coffee and the sound of sizzling bacon greeted me as I entered the kitchen. It seemed Sam had taken the liberty of preparing a feast for himself—a pile of bacon, eggs, and sausages. I smiled at him seeing it, even if it wasn&#39;t the kind of breakfast I would normally eat.<br />
<br />
seeing Sam, wearing my body with a mischievous grin, motioned for me to take a seat. and said &quot;I hope you&#39;re ready for a taste of my world,&quot; gesturing toward the boal with fruits, yogurt, and whole-grain toast spread out on the table. It was completely different, to the sugary cereal and pastries I used to have in the mornings, with him seeming much happier after the talk we had upstairs. <br />
<br />
Suppressing a sigh, I reminded myself to keep an open mind. and with a smile, I picked up a piece of fruit and took a bite, trying to appreciate the flavors and textures that were foreign to my taste buds, but now having Sam&#39;s body, it tasted realy nice and fresh! and took another bite<br />
<br />
As we ate,Sam shared what I would need to know for the week coming up, from his friends to the classes I would need to attend when I went to his school in two days, with it being Saturday.<br />
<br />
After breakfast, I decided to go outside for some fresh air and a change of scenery, ignoring Sam protests. The sun was shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the neighbourhood. I walked along the familiar streets, noticing how different they looked from my smaller body now. I started to think of the possibilities that lay before me.<br />
<br />
I decided to visit the local park, a place where I had spent countless hours when i was 10 like i am now again, When I arrived, I was greeted by the sounds of children laughing and playing. Watching them I couldn&#39;t help but join them. I could even see some of Sam&#39;s friends who I knew Tom and Adam, when i got closer to the play equipment.<br />
<br />
accepting who i am now, I ran up to them in the and found myself, throwing my self into being Sam, pushing myself on the swings with them, louahing at there childish joke they where telling me and i was saying such jokes back, I even attempted some daring acrobatics on the playground equipment, trying to show off. They clapped seeing me do a backflip, which reminded me why I am loving being Sam right now. me and Sam&#39;s now my new friends, found ourselves laughing and enjoying the day, telling story each other what where ovesly lies with how over the time they where, and daring each other to do more and more stupider things, what i found was wiked.<br />
<br />
As the day came to an end, it became clear that this swap was a good thing, Not realising how much happier I feel in this body, I found myself i even found my self sharing funny secrets what i claimed was my brothers with me now being Sam, to my new friends. and I realised that despite being a age and a body, I thort i wold hate being yesterday, i feel like i belong in this body, and want to be Sam, and i am even looking forward to going to middle school!<br />
<br />
As the sun began to set, I said goodbye to Tom and Adam saying i will see them at school on Monday, and returned home, exhausted but happy having a great day in this great body, i sighed knowing i cant let Sam now how much i like his body and life. so I sat on the porch not wanting to confrint him again,,. well not today, i looked up watching the stars coming out, one by one, thinking what the fuchar holds, now i am Sam?<br />
<br />
In that moment of me looking up, Mom came out and sat down next to me. She smiled down at me and said how proud she was of me for accepting being my younger brother so easily, hearing from dad how well i did with gymnastics this morning, and she hugged me with one of her arms pulling me right next to her as we sat there looking up at the sky, gazing at all the stars. After 10 minutes with me in Mom&#39;s embrace, it felt nice, nerve getting this treatment back in my old body, with once again i am now Sam what means i am now moms favourite and I asked, &quot;Where is Sa... sorry, I mean David?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mom smiled down at me and pulled me onto her lap, wrapping both of her arms/hands around me, what felt great being so comfy and warm. as i settled into her lap, She said, &quot;don&#39;t worry honey but... but Your big brother is in his room with his girlfriend.&quot; I felt a jolt of fear. I had forgotten about Amy, my love, the woman I wanted to spend the rest of my life with. But looking down at my now small kid&#39;s body sitting in my moms lap, knowing she would never want to be with me now, and that is if she even believed that Sam and I swapped bodies, I could run in there and play the annoying little brother, not relay liking the thought of my little brother messing around with my girlfriend, or rather, mostly ex-girlfriend, if i still cosider that me and her were a thing with me being in Sams body now and having his life now, running in to mine now Sams room would ruining their night like the old Sam always did to me. Or I could just stay here and awy from the new David/Sam  and Amy.<br />
<br />
And keep on enjoying cuddling up to Mom and tell her about the fun day i had with my new friends, with her putting a blanket around us both, and see what tomorrow brings?</p>
