<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next few hours were a bit of a blur for Liz. She put out the washing and couldn’t help but inspect Rogers underwear. Then she went shopping and purchased everything on Maureen’s list. She went to her supermarket where she was familiar with the aisles rather than the supermarket Maureen usually used. While out she checked out some other shops. Partially because she was scared of facing Roger again and wished to delay her home coming. Several times people said hello to her who she did not recognise. It was a bit awkward.<br />
<br />
Eventually though she headed back to the house. It was past lunchtime. She didn’t know whether she was expected to make Roger lunch and if so what time?<br />
<br />
She found Roger in the kitchen making himself a toasted sandwich. She was grateful that he helped to pack away the groceries.<br />
<br />
“I’ve made a reservation for Bernado’s at 7.30” he did not bring up the earlier conversation about Liz.<br />
<br />
Bernado’s was a fancy restaurant on the waterfront. Liz had often gone there when she was dating. She was unaware whether Maureen had ever been there. They made small talk about the crib Roger was making. He had started assembling it.<br />
<br />
When Roger returned to the shed to complete his project Liz returned to the bedroom to inspect the wardrobe once more. Bernado’s certainly merited dressing up – and what she was wearing though nice wasn’t good enough for when she was going out on a date – with her Husband none-the-less!<br />
<br />
She did wonder how Maureen was going at the spa and indeed sent a message to her own phone (they had swapped phones along with everything else) to let her know the ‘Roger is taking me out to dinner at Bernado’s’. She didn’t get an immediate reply but that did not worry her as she knew Maureen would be at the spa.  She decided she needed a bath and took the opportunity to shave her legs. Mind you, she felt like a whale in the small bath.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile Maureen was enjoying being pampered at the spa. She was tempted to ask the hairdresser to do something radical to Liz’s hair but decided against it, remembering Liz’s final words before she departed. She opted for just a trim and dye. She did go for a different colour on the nails though. For as long as she could remember Liz always had red nails, different shades but always red. Today she decided to get the nails done in a silver to match the silver dress she had found in Liz’s wardrobe and was planning to wear to the dinner party tonight. It was so exciting! The idea of attending a dinner party as a single woman was something long married Maureen could only dream of.<br />
<br />
At 4 pm Roger came in saying the crib was finished. Liz presented him with some hot muffins just out of the oven. Roger was suitably impressed and gave Liz the kiss she had been hoping for. They spent the next few hours watching footy on the TV. Liz was not a footy follower herself but knew that Maureen supported the same team as Roger who was rather passionate. Unfortunately, that team had a disappointing loss.<br />
<br />
By the time the footy finished Liz was getting butterflies in her rather large stomach. She found the idea of dating Roger very appealing. She went to the ensuite to commence making up her face.<br />
<br />
She was doing her lashes when the door opened and Roger wearing only boxer shorts walked in. She had heard him showering in the other bathroom and was not expecting company. He opened a cupboard and grabbed a bottle of something, probably aftershave before disappearing again. Liz held her breath during the brief visit. Roger looked extremely fit and toned. For a man his age (51) he was hot. <br />
<br />
She finished her makeup and decided to get dressed for dinner. Earlier she had settled on a black dress which she was planning to accessorise with Maureen’s jewellery. It didn’t hide that she was overweight but she thought she looked presentable. If ever she had to have this body again she decided it would be a slimmer version.<br />
<br />
She dressed and was grateful she wasn’t disturbed by Roger. The effect his presence was disconcerting.</p>
