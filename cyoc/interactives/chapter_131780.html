<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After a long relaxing bubble bath I dressed in jeans, a tee-shirt and sandals. Underneath I had on the largest panties I could find in Jenna&#39;s drawer. I inserted a pad knowing that a period was imminent.<br />
<br />
My washing was done and I put it in another basket. I put the whites into the machine and set it going. The clouds had blown away so I decided it was safe to hang the clothes outside. Mums load was a little damp to the touch so I decided to put them back out as well.<br />
I managed to put the clothes on without incident and was walking back to the house when a voice said &quot;Hi Jenna&quot;<br />
<br />
The voice belonged to a little blond girl about 5 years old looking over the fence. It was the house that overlooked the clothesline. &quot;Hi&quot; I replied<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s a G-String?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm It&#39;s a type pf panty&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your really pretty&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, You are very pretty too&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why are you always hot?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do you say that? Sometimes I&#39;m hot and sometimes I&#39;m cold. Right now I&#39;m just right&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But Daddy says you always look hot&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Does he now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Chrissie, you leave Jenna alone&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok Mummy&quot;<br />
<br />
Mummy was a brunette who looked to be in her early 30&#39;s &quot;Hi Jenna&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, Ummm, did I have an audience earlier&quot;<br />
<br />
She giggled &quot;It was quite a show&quot;....&quot;Don&#39;t worry it was just me and Chrissie&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was just trying to save the clothes from the rain&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Embarrassing things can happen to all of us......... I wanted to ask if you had any more news about Sarah&#39;s fiance?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think they were hoping wake him from the coma today. Unfortunately his prognosis is not good. I haven&#39;t spoken to Sarah this morning&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh well pass on my best wishes when you speak to her, Bye&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bye&quot;<br />
<br />
I went back inside to my room and decided to look at Jenna&#39;s diaries. However I quickly discover they had not been updated in years. The last entry was from Christmas two years ago. &#39;I now have an iPad&#39; I guessed if she had continued keeping a diary it was electronic.<br />
<br />
I had noticed a small 3 step ladder in the laundry so fetched it deciding to see what was up on the top shelf of the wardrobe. I bought down various boxes and bags that were up there. <br />
<br />
There was a small and a larger suitcase both were empty. There was a dusty box of books. The titles meant nothing to me. I selected a couple of the books to look through at a later date then returned the box to it&#39;s place. There was a shoe box filled with old birthday cards and another shoe box filled with school reports. Jenna had actually been and A grade student but lacked effort according to her teachers.<br />
<br />
Inside another shoebox was another box containing something called &#39;The Millionaire&#39;. Bingo! I thought as I worked out what it was - Jenna&#39;s version of Norman. I opened the box to find a purple rubber thallus. When I read the instructions I realized it was a vibrator. Something to try out tonight. I put that box in my nightie drawer.<br />
<br />
There was a bigger cardboard box on the shelf. I reached up and pulled it down. It contained some old sporting trophies. I pulled them out. There were several swimming trophies including two for club champion freestyler in both under 12 and under 13. There were numerous netball trophies, including 4 best and fairest awards from under 13 through to under 16. Impressive I thought. Lastly there was a duffel bag. I was surprised to see it contained several wigs. One was long and brown, another was a redhead and lastly a bright pink wig. I returned everything back to the shelf.<br />
..............<br />
While I had the house to myself I thought it wise to check out the other rooms. It wasn’t exactly snooping as I now was Ted and Eileen’s daughter. However it felt like it was. If I was going to be Jenna McKenzie then I need to know what belonged where. What was in the linen cupboards etc. I went through the house systematically opening cupboards and seeing what was inside them. Of interest I found a collection of family photo albums in a cupboard in the lounge. It made me realize I would need Sarah to tell me who all the people in the photo’s were. Who were my new cousin’s. Did I have any living grandparents and where all the family holidays had taken place. I found pictures of Jenna at her year 12 formal and at other special occasions. <br />
<br />
In Monique’s old room where the family PC was located there was yet another collection of dresses and other female clothes. Were these Monique’s, Mine, Sarah’s or Mum’s? I did not know. I really needed time with Sarah alone in the house to explain all these things. The only room I did not enter was Eileen and Ted’s bedroom.<br />
<br />
The second load of washing was done so I took that load out to the line and bought in Eileen’s load which by now was dry. I noticed Chrissie jumping on a trampoline in her yard.<br />
<br />
I came back in and rang Sarah. I wanted to ask if she could possibly come around later and help me to adjust to my new life. “Hi Sarah it’s me”<br />
<br />
She cut me off. She seemed annoyed that I had rung her “Jenna, can I call you back later. I’m at the hospital about to meet with the doctors who are looking after Rod” <br />
<br />
Uh Ok”<br />
<br />
“Bye Sis” She hung up. Had she forgotten who I was? It seemed like she really thought I was Jenna.<br />
<br />
Feeling a bit depressed I returned to the PC and logged into Jenna’s account. I typed in ‘Sarah Sucks’ as the password. It actually felt appropriate right now. She was more concerned about my rapist than me her former fiancé. <br />
<br />
I checked out all the different folders within Jenna’s account. There were quite few photo’s. Some obviously from Monique’s wedding. She and Sarah were the bridesmaids, looking like greek goddesses in toga style pale pink dresses. I recognized the dress as one of those in my wardrobe. <br />
 <br />
In some other photo’s I recognized Em and Gabby from last night, posing with Jenna. Obviously it was taken on a night of clubbing. I, or should I say Jenna was wearing a tight fitting white dress with thin black stripes dress. Again I recognized it from the wardrobe. It revealed a lot of cleavage. Interestingly my hair must have been curled. I very much liked the hairstyle.<br />
<br />
I was still looking through the photo’s when I heard a car pulling up outside. It was Mum and Dad returning. I left the computer running and met them at the door. “Hi Mum & Dad, How was brunch?”<br />
<br />
“Hi Jenna” said Dad<br />
<br />
“Very nice” said Mum “We went to ‘Archies on the Park’. Margo and Jim are going to join us on the cruise next month” I knew that Ted and Eileen were off on a cruise in the near future. “Monique rang. She and James coming to town and will stay the night. I’m thinking I’ll put them in Sarah’s room. I must get the room ready” She hurried down towards her bedroom. Ted was already ahead of her.<br />
<br />
I returned to the computer room. I wanted to check out Jenna’s emails better. I took the account details off Jenna’s phone and entered them on the PC. Soon enough I was able to get into the email accounts. Firstly I found a new email from KatieC  &#39;Emma, Please ring me if you can’t make a lesson. Call 47xxxxx5 to reschedule&#39; I wrote the number down.<br />
<br />
I found the message from Alison Banksville. A search for old messages from her showed that ‘Emma’ had been doing occasional jobs with her over the last 6 months. They didn’t reveal what the work was. I guessed Emma may have been a fake name that Jenna used. I wrote down Alison’s phone number as well.<br />
<br />
I searched but could find no more email messages from James. If was here tonight maybe I would find out more. I shut down the computer and returned to my room<br />
<br />
I dialed Katie C. A woman answered “Hello, Meteor dance studio” <br />
<br />
“Hi I’m ringing to apologize for missing an appointment last Thursday night with Katie”<br />
<br />
“Is that you Emma? It’s Katie. What happened? I’m doing this as a favor for Alison. I’ll have to start charging you for the lessons if you don’t turn up” Dance lessons I thought. I had enjoyed dancing the other night. I will do this.<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry Katie. I started a new job on Thursday and it slipped my mind. Can we reschedule?”<br />
<br />
“Well it would have to be Monday or Thursday. How about Monday?”<br />
<br />
“I have a medical appointment at 5.30, Maybe later?”<br />
<br />
“How about 8pm?”<br />
<br />
“Sure, what should I wear?”<br />
<br />
“Just gym wear would do for the 1st lesson” <br />
<br />
“And what was the address again?”<br />
<br />
“79 Baker St”<br />
<br />
“Ok see you there”<br />
<br />
I put a reminder into the phone. <br />
<br />
Next I dialled Alison “Hello Emma” a woman answered.<br />
<br />
“Hi Alison”<br />
<br />
“Thanks for ringing back. I was wondering whether you might be available for a job tonight?”<br />
<br />
“Well I’m not sure. My sister from Gladesville is in town. What’s involved?”<br />
<br />
“I know you don’t want to work in town but the clients are willing to pay top dollar. I have JC and Bess lined up but a fourth would be nice. It’s at the Sheraton in the penthouse. I’ve always wanted to see in there” The Sheraton penthouse – Roberts Bucks party!<br />
<br />
“Ah no. Sorry Alison I can’t do that”<br />
<br />
“No worries. I understand. I’ll contact you next time something comes up”<br />
<br />
I couldn’t hang up quick enough. Was Jenna a stripper? That might explain the false name. She doesn’t like to work in town. Does that mean when Jenna disappeared for days she was off to Melbourne or somewhere as a stripper? What had I stumbled into? I must talk to Sarah.<br />
<br />
I needed to settle I locked the bedroom and headed down to the kitchen. I put the kettle on. I needed a coffee. <br />
<br />
“Thanks for getting the clothes in Jenna” <br />
<br />
“No worries Mum” My own should be dry by now. I thought to get them off after the coffee.<br />
<br />
“What’s Monique in town for?”<br />
<br />
“I think she is just down to console Sarah” <br />
<br />
“Have you heard from Sarah this morning? I tried to ring earlier but she was just about to see the doctors”<br />
<br />
“I will give her a ring shortly. Maybe invite her over for dinner. Are you around for dinner?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah that would be nice. When are you expecting Monique?”<br />
<br />
“She was going to leave straight after she closed the agency at 1 so maybe around 3” Monique and James had recently started their own travel agency in Gladesville.<br />
<br />
I finished my coffee than went out to collect the clothes off the line.<br />
<br />
When I returned Mum was in conversation with Sarah. She waved me away, she had a very concerned look on her face. It took the basket of clothes to my room and started putting away the clean clothes into the wardrobe. When finished I remade my bed.<br />
I returned to kitchen thinking it was time for lunch. Mum and Dad were walking back from the shed. Neither looked happy.<br />
I was making myself a salad sandwich. This body had only a small appetite. Mum and Dad came in the back door. “Jenna, as you may have guessed that was Sarah on the phone before. She has had some horrible news. Rod has not come out of the coma and they have seen no signs of brain function. He has been diagnosed as brain dead. Only the machines are keeping him alive…..” Mum was sniffling and couldn’t carry on.<br />
<br />
“We are planning to go to the hospital to comfort Sarah” said Dad. “Did you wish to come?”<br />
<br />
I was feeling faint myself. “Yes, I’d like to come with you”<br />
<br />
I ate my sandwich as Mum and Dad went to their room. I then went to my own room and grabbed Jenna’s handbag. When I emerged Dad was waiting near the front door. Mum was on the phone talking to Monique. Letting her know we would be at the hospital. She hung up “Let’s go”</p>
