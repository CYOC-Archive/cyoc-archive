<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I don&#39;t remember much about the day after that. Maybe I still had a little bit of a concussion, even if all other evidence that I&#39;d been in any sort of accident had disappeared right before my eyes. But mostly, I think it was just such a boring day that there wasn&#39;t much to remember. Watching TV, playing video games, existentially dreading the thought of having to go back to work tomorrow morning, masturbating once I got bored of everything else, and finally going to bed. You know, your typical Sunday. Maybe I would&#39;ve remembered it better if I&#39;d known just how much my life was about to change - and how I&#39;d never live through another boring Sunday like that again.<br />
<br />
I was lying on the couch, realizing that it was getting pretty late already - probably almost midnight - and idly starting to unzip my jeans and reach for what lay inside. This part I remember pretty well. I don&#39;t know what I was fantasizing about, though. Maybe I was bored enough that I didn&#39;t need much of an excuse to start playing with myself. I could feel my cock throbbing in my underwear, crying out for some attention, and I knew I needed to take care of it before I could even try to fall asleep. So, staring blankly at the ceiling, I reached in there and started to get the job done, without any particular passion in it.<br />
<br />
But I had barely gotten my hand around my penis before I felt something... weird. The shaft, I could tell, was rubbing against a patch of some kind of hair - and not the scraggly mounds of pubic hair I was used to having down there. This was soft - I could even call it fluffy - and it didn&#39;t seem to be attached in any way to my nether regions, either. Confused, I pulled my hand back out and...<br />
<br />
Holy shit. Right there, in the middle of the skin on my palm, was an unmistakable patch of thin white fuzz. I brought my fingers down to try and rub off whatever it was that had gotten stuck to my hand, but no luck. All those little tiny hairs were actually attached to me - and I could practically feel them pulsating as they continued to grow outward little by little.<br />
<br />
I glanced at my other hand, too, just in case, and... Yeah. Wow. Exactly the same thing. And in a perfectly symmetrical shape when I compared it against the other one, too. My mother had always warned me something like this might happen, but I had always thought it was an old wives&#39; tale. And I didn&#39;t put much stock in it right now, either. I&#39;d been masturbating almost daily for at least fifteen years by this point - why would it suddenly start up and cause this now?<br />
<br />
The confusion over what the hell was happening to my hands, though, wasn&#39;t enough to distract my attention away from the need for release that was going on downstairs. In fact, I think it only became stronger the more worried I got. Eventually, I had to tear my eyes away from the hairy growths and do something, because there was no way I would ever be able to focus on the problem at hand (no pun intended) if I didn&#39;t take care of this first.<br />
<br />
A wave of distracting heat ran through the whole length of my body as I shifted my underwear down from around my waist. What I saw, when my desperate cock had finally been freed from its confinement, confused me just as much as the stuff stuck to my hands. I couldn&#39;t even recognize my own penis at first - it had somehow been replaced by a slender, snaking red thing, which now simply tapered to a point with no head flaring out on top. The mound of curly brown pubic hair that normally surrounded it had been replaced by more of that strange white fuzz. And before my very eyes, this thing that had replaced my dick was sinking down into the fuzz around it - not actually getting smaller, but pulling back into a pocket in the surrounding flesh like it was making itself a little cocoon.<br />
<br />
Only, when I reached out for it with one of my increasingly hairy hands, that movement suddenly started to reverse. I could feel the blood rushing in to make it erect again, and the cock slid back out of its new hiding spot and flared up at my touch. I was overcome with heat and needed to get this over with, but I couldn&#39;t tear my eyes away from it long enough to think about something sexy. So, even though I was far too scared to be enjoying this, I found myself masturbating to the sight of my own freakishly changing body, and jolts of pleasure sprung out of it so easily as I did. How was I supposed to resist?<br />
<br />
I stroked the alien shaft in front of me frantically, trying to keep it from going back into hiding with constant stimulation. Every time I rubbed a finger down its bizarrely smooth skin, I shuddered with pleasure, hearing my own breath catch in my throat every time. But as overwhelmingly good as it felt, I wasn&#39;t getting to completion. I kept stroking it, harder and faster, right up until my hand started to disappear into the sleeve of my sweatshirt.<br />
<br />
Wait. <i>What?</i><br />
<br />
I was so focused on the bizarre penis right in front of me that I had completely failed to notice what was happening elsewhere. My clothes hung all over my body awkwardly, as big and baggy as if I was a kid playing dress-up in my dad&#39;s work outfit. I stopped masturbating for long enough to fight my way out of this steadily growing shirt, then turned my attention back to the task at hand. But it wouldn&#39;t be that easy. Now I saw my whole naked upper body, covered all over in the same occasional patches of white. In some places, especially as it got closer to my aching crotch, it was starting to look more like occasional patches of bare skin surrounded by an ocean of fuzz.<br />
<br />
None of this was going to stop me from finally getting my rocks off, though. If anything, it just made the idea more appealing, as the fuzz trapped the heat against my skin and stopped me from sweating it out. The pressure just kept growing until I didn&#39;t care what was happening to me anymore - all I could think about was the punishing sensations of pleasure that wouldn&#39;t leave me alone. I had to get them off my back somehow. So, with the fuzz on my palms squeaking audibly against my bright red cock, I carried on, ready to get on my knees if I had to and beg for a release.<br />
<br />
In all the confusion, it took me an embarrassingly long time to connect the dots. There was that weird little fuzzy white creature I had seen the night before - and now I seemed to be looking more and more like a weird little fuzzy white creature myself. It dawned on me at almost exactly the same moment that I finally came, a spurt of jizz shooting up into the air and splattering back down on the sweatpants that still bunched up loosely around my legs. I panted heavily, exhausted - I needed to expel all that heat somehow if I couldn&#39;t sweat anymore.<br />
<br />
As my cock finally calmed down and stopped bothering me, I was relieved in more ways than one. Now I could finally focus on the much more important issue of &quot;what the hell was happening to me!?&quot; But I soon realized that my mind was not getting any clearer. I was so overwhelmed, and so tired, that all I could do now was to lean my head back on the couch, close my eyes, and...</p>
