<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Making her way back to the motel, Sarah pondered what her team had discovered in their inquiries. She realized that afterwards, a talk with Dave would be needed. Maybe after comparing notes the two experienced agents could get a better idea of what was going on in this small New England town. &quot;Greg how did the interview go?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay I suppose,&quot; Greg stated, fidgeting in place. &quot;I didn&#39;t know they made Marines THAT big though.&quot; Sarah chuckled as she studied the young agent. Greg Benson had impressed his superiors, first with his military service followed by his performance within the academy. Standing at six feet tall with ebony skin and an athletic physique, the young man exuded a confident air about him.  &quot;So what were you able to learn,&quot; Sarah asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Greg started. &quot;Sgt. Harris wasn&#39;t a fan of Agent Dyson. I could tell by the look on his face when I asked him about Alec. The guy just stood up, glowering at me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah probably should&#39;ve mentioned Cole a little better,&quot; Sarah smirked. &quot;Apparently him and his father were both legends. Most of their missions are still classified. But, should of told you he was six and a half feet tall and 250 lbs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Would of helped,&quot; Greg grumbled. &quot;Regardless though, he didn&#39;t seem to know the whereabouts of Agent Dyson and I tend to believe him.&quot; Sarah nodded, although Greg was still getting his feet wet, she had noted he had very good instincts when interviewing subjects.  She trusted the young agent. Turning towards the youngest member of her team, she now awaited Michelle Wong&quot;s report.<br />
<br />
Michelle was brilliant, the young Asian woman having graduated from Princeton in three years before obtaining a Masters in Criminal Justice. Unfortunately, when it came to social interactions, she was a bit awkward and unsure of herself. This was why Sarah had sent the young woman to interview Derrick Harris. Being inside a school was probably the best way to put Michelle at ease. &quot;So what were you able to gather Michelle?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I spoke with Derrick and his wife Morgan,&quot; she stated, pushing her glasses up her nose. &quot;Neither one had a tremendous amount of information on Agent Dyson. However, I did conduct background checks on them individually. They married recently. Honeymooned in the Caribbean. Doing a further search I was able to determine that Derrick Harris had been depositing a few hundred dollars into his savings prior to the Honeymoon. It appears he was saving up for this trip and drained a good deal of it in the process. Oh, and a check on his wife showed that she inherited a sizable inheritance from her grandfather yet she appears to not have informed her husband about it. I think she doesn&#39;t want to hurt his feelings.&quot; Sarah&#39;s head was spinning from the amount of information she had been bombarded with. Michelle had certainly been thorough but once again they had no further leads on Alec&#39;s whereabouts.<br />
<br />
&quot;So Michelle did you find out what he had for dinner last night,&quot; Greg teased.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wasn&#39;t aware we needed that,&quot; Michelle replied nervously, brushing her brunette hair behind her ear. &quot;I can reinterview Mr. Harris and his wife again if you want Agent McMillan.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No that&#39;s okay Michelle,&quot; Sarah said quickly. &quot;We&#39;re good. You two did great. Why don&#39;t you get some rest I need to talk with Dave.&quot; The two young agents nodded making their way towards their rooms as Sarah let out a sigh. &quot;Well they certainly are thorough.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ya think&quot; Dave laughed. Sarah smirked, locking her door before turning to her old friend. &quot;So Dave what were you able to turn up?&quot; <br />
<br />
Listening closely, Sarah now listened as Dave reported on everything. Honestly, she wasn&#39;t expecting to learn anything that had already been said. The Harris siblings most likely didn&#39;t know where Alec Dyson was. This exercise was simply to gage their reactions. From what Sarah could see those reactions were expected. Cole Harris didn&#39;t like him and Derrick Harris had no Idea. For Sarah it was Claudia Harris that intrigued her the most but, Dave did have information that could prove useful.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just like you thought Julia didn&#39;t know much,&quot; he said. &quot;She didn&#39;t know where Alec was and barely remembered him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I figured as much,&quot; Sarah sighed. &quot;But I&#39;m guessing you found something rather interesting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you guessed right,&quot; Dave grinned. &quot;Did you know Julia recently got married? She even just gave birth to her first child.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No idea but congratulations.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thats what I said,&quot; Dave replied. &quot;And then I started checking out her husband, Rick Moreland.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what did you learn?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Dave started. &quot;He owns a small tech company. Security systems, home defense, computer encryption, stuff like that. What was really interesting though was his older brother Jacob.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what&#39;s up with big brother?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing,&quot; Dave replied, causing Sarah to raise an eyebrow. &quot;And I mean nothing. It&#39;s like he doesn&#39;t exist. The guy is a ghost. All I could turn up was a former address in Wyoming, a residence here, some pension paperwork from the Vatican.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A pension from the Vatican?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah I had the same look on my face,&quot; Dave replied. &quot;I tried digging deeper but nothing. All I got was a medical bill paid by the Vatican last year for a catastrophic injury and guess who big brothers doctor was?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Julia Harris.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Give the girl a cigar,&quot; Dave exclaimed. &quot;It&#39;s crazy though Sarah. Someone went through alot of trouble to cover up this guy&#39;s existence. Maybe Alec was on to something.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah bit her lip, this nugget of information was definitely intriguing. It now made her wonder if what she had seen with the Harris children was real. &quot;You might be onto something, &quot; she said softly. &quot;And it kind of explains what I saw.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you see?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah paused, feeling somewhat foolish as she explained her interview. While Claudia hadn&#39;t been home she had seen the kids. &quot;Wait the kids were part animal,&quot; Dave asked.<br />
<br />
&quot; I know how it sounds okay,&quot; Sarah exclaimed. &quot;But I know what I saw. One second it was just a regular kid and the next second they had...tails. like a cat or a fox or something. And I think the babysitters knew about it too, judging by how nervous they were. <br />
<br />
Dave rubbed his chin as he turned the information over in his head. Half animal children? A mysterious man whose bills were paid by the Vatican? Not to mention all the other weird happenings around this town.  Something very strange was going on. &quot;Sarah what have we gotten ourselves into?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah shrugged, she couldn&#39;t be sure but she was determined to find out.<br />
