<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Miles awoke the next morning and got dressed. Another change he had to get accustomed to were the suits James wore. They were cheaply made and not as comfortable as his own tailored suits. It also seemed that James didn’t own a pair of dress shoes, which Miles could only assume was due to the lack of sufficient funds, and put on James’ converse chucks. Miles brushed his teeth and attempted to comb James’ hair to no avail.<br />
<br />
Looking at his reflection, Miles couldn’t help but get lost in the cute twink staring back at him. “Damn!” Miles thought, “this little twink bottom could probably have any top they wanted.” A brief head shake and Miles came back to focus. “No! I have to focus on getting to the office.”<br />
<br />
Miles made sure to grab his stuff and make his way to the bus stop. Another uncomfortable bus ride later and Miles found himself an hour early at the office. He had agreed to meet James a bit early and hoped that James was already in his office.<br />
<br />
“Hey James,” the receptionist said, “Mr. Wright wants to see you in his office.” Miles merely nodded and headed toward the elevator. Heading to the top floor, he made his way to his office and found James sitting at his desk looking pretty nervous.<br />
<br />
“Oh! Mi-… James! You’re here!” James said enthusiastically as he began to slowly show a small smile. His deep voice sent a shiver down Miles spine as he noticed how much more attractive his body looked than ever. He wasn’t sure if it was because he hadn’t seen James in a few days, but seeing his old body was making his small dick hard. He quickly reached the desk, trying to hide his erection from James.<br />
<br />
Even sitting down James was still at an intimidating height. Miles gulped as he noticed the outline of James’ pecs from his suit. The smell of his perfume filling him with arousal. “Man… I feel so horny. I want him to fuck me so bad right now.” Miles thought as he lost himself in a trance.<br />
<br />
“What? Is there something on my suit?” James said as he looked down to see what Miles was staring at.<br />
<br />
James comment quickly snapped Miles out of it as he blushed at the prospect of getting caught. “Why am I getting so embarrassed?” Miles wondered. “It was just his old body. And why was he getting so goddamn horny?”<br />
<br />
“Hey your face is red? Are you ok?” James asked. So far Miles was acting really strange. James hoped he hadn’t messed up and that Miles was already mad at him.<br />
<br />
Miles remembered his new pale skin tone easily showed his furious blushing and felt his face become more warm. “Sorry I kinda ran a bit to get here early and feel really hot.” Miles lied as he fanned himself pretending to be hot.<br />
<br />
“Oh! Sorry I got you so worked up to meet me early.” James said with a frown. “I hope I can make it up to you.” He lowered his head in shame.<br />
<br />
Miles simply shook his head. The kid still acted this submissive? Even after being in his large, hairy, and muscular body for a few days. The whole idea just turned him on more.<br />
<br />
Hoping to distract himself he began talking about their plan for the day. After conversing with James for a bit, it seemed he had gotten most of it down over the past few days. “Ok. Just text me if you need any help.” Miles said as he made his way back to the elevator. By now his erection had died down but he still felt a bit sexually restless. Perhaps going to work would help relieve him of his pent up lust.<br />
<br />
Miles began his usual shift as James. By now it was all a breeze to him. So he mostly focused on trying to find the mole. He didn’t have much luck until he noticed a man acting a bit suspicious. It was lunch break on the floor and he was the only person still at his computer. Miles was just about to head over to secretly investigate when he got interceded by Abby.<br />
<br />
“Hey, James. Mr. Wright wants you to bring him up a coffee.” She told him.<br />
<br />
“S-s-sure thing!” Miles stammered obediently before becoming annoyed as he realized he would have to quickly leave to avoid acting suspicious. Taking a mental note of the man’s appearance and location, Miles made his way to get James coffee.<br />
<br />
***<br />
James found himself doing a pretty good job as CEO. Luckily, it was a bit easier since he had time to practice over the past few days. Furthermore, Miles clearing out his schedule ahead of time really helped. By lunchtime, James felt he should probably check up on Miles. He decided to tell Abby a coffee order to give to Miles to give him an excuse to return. After a bit, he heard the elevator doors open to reveal Miles with a cup of coffee in his hand.<br />
<br />
“Here you go… sir!” Miles said as he placed the coffee on his desk. He was somewhat annoyed at being interrupted at his investigation but found his anger placating as arousal of being near his old body began to return.<br />
<br />
“James! I just wanted to tell you that I’ve been doing a good job,” James whispered, “and that there seems to be no problems or suspicions so far.”<br />
<br />
Miles gave him a slight smile. “That’s great…” he responded before taking note of James’ slightly messy beard. Miles had always made sure to properly groom his mustache and beard but it seemed that James was unaccustomed to having a beard. In fact, he didn’t even smell any of his usual aftershave on James. “Ja- sir! Didn’t you groom your beard?” Miles asked him.<br />
<br />
“Huh. I guess I really didn’t acknowledge I had to.” James said as he looked down as his slightly messy beard.<br />
<br />
“Here!” Miles said as he walked behind the desk and reached for a beard comb he kept in a drawer. Using it, he began to groom the beard back to its usual perfect state. After he finished, Miles also noticed that James had completely buttoned up his suit. “Also you might need to remember that I don’t use all of the buttons!” Miles began to unbutton the suit as he smelled his old body’s musk enter his nose. Glancing at his old hairy chest, Miles quickly finished and walked back to the front of the desk to hide his boner.<br />
<br />
“Thanks James!” James told him as he examined himself on his phone’s camera. “I definitely look a lot more like you now.”<br />
<br />
“I agree.” Miles said, adjusting his small erection in his briefs. “Anyway if you don’t need anything else, I think I have to go back before people start realizing I’m spending too much time here.”<br />
<br />
James waved him goodbye as Miles returned to his intern position.</p>
