<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff wanted to swap parts; he knew it would be fun. And of all his family members, his mom would be the most interesting target. The opposite sex and much older would be quite a different experience. Add her wardrobe of revealing, tight clothes and plenty of heels and sandals, he could dressup very sexily. <br />
<br />
Putting into the Chronivac, Jeff chooses swapping her feet first. Taking off his socks, he watches as his feet shrink in size to a womans size 9, becoming smooth, hairless and gaining black polish on their toenails. When the swap completed, Jeff wiggled his dainty milf feet. Sitting on his bed, he lifted his legs to look at his new soft, rosy soles. Scrunching his toes made them wrinkle up, so he tickled them. His whole body shuddered and he moaned. Only, it sounded less like his normal moans and more like that of a lusty mature woman. His mother&#39;s feet must be sensitive, as he sported an erection. <br />
<br />
Moving on, he began swapping her legs with his. He made sure to take his pants off first, so he could see as his legs lengthened and lost their hair, becoming shapely as well. Chuckling, he rubbed his legs as he did a split, something he could never do with his own leg muscles. His erect junk hit the floor, so he got up and swapped her ass, hips and waist with his. His rear end and hips flared out, ripping his underwear as he gained a mature plump rump and childbearing hips. <br />
<br />
Next up was his hands and arms; his arms lengthened and his hands shrunk, gaining the matching black nail polish as his dainty toes. After that went his torso and neck, leading to his shoulders becoming less broad, his stomach gaining a bit of chub, and his waist forming a lovely hourglass figure.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s really cool.&quot; He noted, realizing he had his mother&#39;s voice since he had her neck; vocal cords included. He swapped his mouth and lips with hers, acquiring her thick dick sucking lips and pearly white teeth. Licking his lips with his new tongue, he felt a little sultry. <br />
<br />
But, he was still not done. Swapping her chest with his, he finally felt her breasts growing on his chest. They kept expanding and expanding, until they stopped at a gigantic J cup size. They strained against his shirt, the erect nipples poking through it. He twirled and looked over his body, still feeling a familiar thing flopping around down below. &quot;Woops, almost forgot.&quot; He chuckled.<br />
<br />
With another swap, Jeff&#39;s junk was sucked into his body, being replaced with his mother&#39;s pussy and internal parts. Moaning from the sensation, he came as the swap finished. Rubbing his plump labia, he wiggled his manicured fingers around a bit, twitching from the ministrations. <br />
<br />
&quot;I can probably top this off.&quot; He decided, acquiring more of his mother&#39;s facial features. Her emerald eyes, perfectly shaped nose, normal sized ears, her lack of facial hair, and her short pixie cut hairstyle. With the rest of his head being his own however, Jeff looked like a lewd milf version of himself. <br />
<br />
Smiling at this thought, Jeff found he could also swap the wardrobes of him and his mother. He didn&#39;t hesitate to do just that, happily running to his closet to wear something. Since he was gonna be home for the rest of the day, he figured it didn&#39;t matter what he really chose. Settling on a tiny black bikini and black platform thongs that raised him 5 inches, he felt like a true milf. &quot;Being a milf sure does feel better than my old body.&quot; He moaned, squeezing his huge tits and feeling his pussy leak juices through the thin bottoms.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I should stay this way forever.&quot; He concluded, considering this body an upgrade to his original. He can always use the Chronivac to stop himself from aging, so his body can remain in a prime milf state permanently. Jiggling his way over to his bed, Jeff went to town exploring his new mature female form. He said things he never expected to hear his mother&#39;s voice speak, which only turned him on further. He lost count of how many times he climaxed, laying there all sweaty in a bed soaked in his juices. <br />
<br />
He is a little surprised he didn&#39;t hear his mother scream, however. Getting up and leaving his room like this, he goes to find his mother.</p>
