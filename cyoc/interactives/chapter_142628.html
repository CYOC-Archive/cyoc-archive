<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;And what&#39;s your GPA?&quot; Pascal grinned, looking up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, well...&quot; Gabe smiled, &quot;I only have this position because I&#39;m top of my class with a 4.0 and highest honors. I&#39;ve always been an academic overachiever, you know this, Professor.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re welcome.&quot; Pascal winked to a confused Gabe, opening the door to his office. &quot;Thank you for the books I requested. Please follow up with student emails. That&#39;ll be all for today.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gabe ducked out of the office, not quite sure what had happened.<br />
<br />
…<br />
<br />
“That was generous,” Pascal thought to himself, “possibly reckless…” He went to undo the changes, but ended up leaving them.  The terminal produced seemingly stable results, and while Gabe was unaware of the changes, he would surely benefit from his new 4.0 GPA.<br />
<br />
Pascal sat back, admiring the device again: a terminal for reality!<br />
<br />
This device had been in Dan’s possession before. Did the boy even know what he had?  To think he was using it to text his other slaves in class--<br />
<br />
--what was Dan doing in a redhead class anyway?<br />
<br />
# dpascal@chronivac:$ history &#8617;<br />
<br />
Pascal entered the command for reviewing terminal history, but only his most recent commands were returned.  Either Dan never used the terminal for editing reality, or Pascal was only able to see changes he made.<br />
<br />
“Gabe was completely unaware, even after I doubled his height,” Pascal thought aloud.  If only the current user could see changes, it might be possible that Dan altered reality and Pascal was completely unaware.<br />
<br />
“What were you doing in Comp Sci for redheads, Master Daniel…”  Pascal tried to cross his massively muscled arms, suddenly remembering his wedding ring in his shirt pocket.  He jumped, as if he’d been caught by his husband, quickly putting it back on, before returning to the terminal.<br />
<br />
Dan clearly hadn’t made any changes to himself. Nobody would chose to be that short or under-endowed, but what he lacked in cock he made up for in presence.  It was unusual, but not impossible, for him to be in the redhead computer science class.  Even if his slave was in the class.<br />
<br />
“Magnus…”  Pascal squinted at the memory.  A titanic, platinum blond, who won the campus Alpha Bear competition on size alone.  Now that was suspicious; he was almost too submissive to function.<br />
<br />
“Of course.”  Pascal smiled knowingly.  It made perfect sense: Dan used the terminal to make Magnus the alpha bear champion, later adding himself to the class so Magnus wouldn’t be alone.  Everything else seemed perfectly normal, Dan was clearly underestimating the true potential of this device and wasted it on one of his boyfriends.<br />
<br />
# dpascal@chronivac:$ Subject = David Pascal &#8617;<br />
# :$ Age 50<br />
# :$ Height 7&#39;2&quot;<br />
# :$ Weight 520lbs<br />
# :$ Eyes Blue<br />
# :$ Hair Silver<br />
# :$ Measurements 68&quot;c, 70&quot;w, 24&quot;a, 38&quot;q<br />
# :$ Cock Size 26&quot; long, 16&quot; circumference (cut)<br />
<br />
The accuracy of the device was stunning in its conciseness; only the stats that mattered to him displayed.<br />
<br />
While Pascal had fantasized about fixing the politics of his country, reversing global warming, or even solving the P versus NP problem, he couldn’t stop thinking about Dan.  The more he thought about his student, the more he craved him.<br />
<br />
“He’s not even my type!” Pascal whispered in disbelief, looking over at the framed photo of him and his husband.  Dark skin, golden eyes, broad masculine nose…Pascal met his husband on a cruise through Polynesia.  Something about island boys drove him crazy.<br />
<br />
But maybe Dan drove him more crazy.<br />
<br />
# dpascal@chronivac:$ Set race to 100% Celtic &#8617;<br />
<br />
Pascal trembled before applying the change.  THATS what Dan wanted, wasn’t it? A big, hulking, submissive, needy, redhead...that was his type...Marcus and his twin brother Patrick were prime examples.  Even Magnus had the size and submissive demeanor of a redhead lost in their passions.<br />
<br />
He wanted to be certain to get Dan’s attention when he stopped by.<br />
<br />
# dpascal@chronivac:$ Set height to 25-feet-tall &#8617;<br />
<br />
At 25-feet-tall, Pascal would be one of the biggest redheads on Earth.  There’s no way Master Dan could miss him.  But was it enough?  He would have to find out...Pascal hit save and watched the world around him ripple.<br />
<br />
His desk pushed away from him suddenly as his legs ran out of room, furniture creaking against his swelling body.  Everything was shrinking away from him...but just as his head neared the 14-foot-tall ceiling, the room expanded.  No longer able to fit in a private office, Pascal was back in the hangar where he taught those giant redheads...redheads like himself.  <br />
<br />
15...16...17 feet tall.<br />
<br />
He could feel air rushing over his swelling body, eyeing his skin go from tan with silver fur to pale pink skin covered in thick plumes of red.<br />
<br />
20...21...22 feet tall.<br />
<br />
As he grew, his clothes shifted and changed.  At his size, he couldn’t afford a custom-tailored wardrobe, not on a professor’s salary.  His dress shirt simplified to a stretchy t-shirt, then he was shirtless, only wearing a kilt with his family tartan.<br />
<br />
23...24...25 feet tall.  Pascal let out a breath of relief...he had a touch of vertigo and was relieved to be done growing, but the changes were far from over.<br />
<br />
Pascal watched his desk glitch to a height fitting for his new redhead form, the terminal sitting atop it, as if it had always been an appropriate size for him.  He went to sit at his desk and was surprised by the sheer weight of his giant body.  His bloated muscles were so thick they jiggled slightly with his movements, while his muscle gut was so large he had to lean back slightly to stay balanced.<br />
<br />
“Oooffuuuccckkk…” Pascal let out a deep, powerful moan that would have rivaled the current Alpha Bear Magnus.  His oversized redheaded balls were churning--he could feel them clenching and filling larger by the second.  He looked down quickly to confirm...and was startled by his giant redhead cock.  So long that it rested on the floor.<br />
<br />
His thinking was getting clouded.  Pascal wasn’t just horny, he was a horned up REDHEAD.  The intensity of his pent-up sexual desire was so overwhelming that it hurt.  His cock sprung up suddenly, wedged between him and his desk, leaking copious amounts of pre over his chest.<br />
<br />
He wasn’t going to make it to a relief room.  The rate his balls were filling he would cum spontaneously before leaving the hanger.  How did redheads live like this…?<br />
<br />
“Hnnnggg…” Pascal let out another moan.  As horned up as he was, a new feeling was tugging at his heart.  His bloodright of needing to serve and submit as a redhead.<br />
<br />
*bong*  The program had finished running.<br />
<br />
There he was, 25-feet-tall, swollen with muscle, thick red fur, and a cock that was bigger than most of his students...this is what Dan was attracted to…<br />
<br />
“MASTER Dan.” Pascal corrected himself, feeling his submissive entreats take hold.  This wasn’t enough...Dan deserved so much more than a 54-year-old professor.<br />
<br />
But, truth be told, Pascal didn’t even know what Dan would want…<br />
<br />
“Of course…”  Pascal reached around his cock and typed in a new command.  He had been tempted to make himself even bigger, more submissive, more something...but this new command would automatically grow him into what Dan desired until he deemed him worthy of being collared.<br />
<br />
Pascal reached for the empty space where a collar should be…<br />
<br />
“Professor Pascal?” Dan had entered the hanger, his Magnus, Marcus, and Patrick right behind him.<br />
<br />
Pascal blushed, overcome by all the new feelings his redheaded body were giving him.  He felt the need to grovel, to whimper, to beg...his heart was thumping hard, stomach full of butterflies, throat in knots.  Every step Dan made tugged on his heart harder.<br />
<br />
“MASTER DAN!”  Pascal cried out, falling to his hands and knees.<br />
<br />
“Oh!  Hello, Professor.”  Dan looked at Patrick, then back at the professor.  “Huh, I guess I didn’t notice you were a redhead.”<br />
<br />
The air around Pascal shimmered, his red fur growing in more dense, the hair on his head getting longer until it was a thickly braided ponytail, while his beard knotted down to his belly.<br />
<br />
Dan shook his head, trying to clear his vision.  “Yeah, no idea how I missed that...you’re even more furry than my pups.”</p>
