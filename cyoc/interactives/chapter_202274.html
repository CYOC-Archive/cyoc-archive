<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jun stood on the stairs outside the house, but was probably more apt to call it a mansion. There were people out on the street having drinks and chatting, dressed up in all sorts of outfits ranging from old TV shows, to fairytales and even some asian anime or mythology. There were plenty of people in more modest attire, but she did see quite a few, guys and girls, dressed in the more stereotypical risque costumes showing off quite a bit of skin. <br />
<br />
The house stood at the end of the street, taking up almost a double block with a small garden in the front leading up to a garage and 3 stories tall with a wide set of stairs leading up to a oversised door, which was propped open allowing the last of the sunlight in. Struggling to remember exactly whos house this was she made her way up the stairs carefully, drawing some attention from some of the other party goers.<br />
<br />
Heading inside, the entrance hall seemed to give way to large lounge areas on either side with huge marble staircases in the centre heading to the upper levels. The music was loud, and most people appeared to have a drink in hand. There had to be almost a 100 people here. Moving past the open living areas, she sqeezed past a few groups that had stopped in the hallway, gracefully moving out of the way of two girls dressed as fairies coming in the opposite direction. Dressed in tight fitting green leotards and matching brown leather trim, the two had exquistely complex make-up on giving their faces a slightly unnatural <i>glow</i>. The girls giggled slightly, giving Jun a side smile and wave as they disappeared into the crowd, Jun could have sworn that she saw the wings on their back flutter slightly just as they disappeared from view.<br />
<br />
She rounded the corner to enter the kitchen, the benches covered in bottles of booze, a large punch bowl fashioned out of a kiddies blow-up pool as well as large coolers full of beer and pre-mixed drinks. A large group guys seemed to be in charge of the punch, all of whom seemed to be dressed as cheerleaders. They were all topless wearning relatively ill fitting blond wigs, the clumped hair falling over well definied, tan bodies. They all had poorly fitting short jean shorts that were clearly home made and even a few of them had some shoes with a bit of heel, the others in sandals. Upon spotting Jun entering without a drink in hand, one of them dips a large solo cup into the punch and headed over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, awesome costume! Whats that, a goth?&quot;  He asked, holding out the cup. &quot;You&#39;ve got to try the pool punch, its pretty magic! barely tastes like any alcohol at all!&quot; Jun takes a quick look around, seeing if she can see a bathroom where Kelan might be holed up. &quot;Ettto,, ariga... thank you.&quot; looking back up at the man, &quot;Where is bathroom?&quot; <br />
Still holding the drink out to her, he points over his shoulder at one of the side rooms heading further into the house. &quot;Theres a few around down here, but thats the closest one. Think it might be currently occupied though, saw someone darting in there a while ago.&quot; He places the drink into Jun&#39;s hand. &quot;Why don&#39;t you stay a bit here with us whilst you wait?&quot;<br />
Jun takes the cup whilst looking in the direction he pointed. &quot;I&#39;m meeting friends first, maybe later, ok?&quot; as she gives a small bow and heads through the crowd towards the door in question, the other guys pointing and laughing at the cheerleaders failed attempt.<br />
<br />
Raising her gloved hand, she gently uses the back of her kuckles to knock on the door, hearing a familar voice answer \<br />
&quot;Sorry, this ones taken!&quot; Before answering back &quot;Kelan, its Jun&quot;. The door hurridly opens and Jun feels herself almost dragged into the room with the door shutting behind her.  In front of her Kelan is almost naked and in mid attempt to put on the costume.  Still wearning his socks and boxers, he has managed to put on the bikini bottoms, his sizeable thighs straining the material. At the front there is an obvious outline of his average sized cock and the material appears to be causing the skin to buldge out and around. The front and back straps are all twisted and the top appears to be supporting his mild but definitely present moobs. His face is red not from the make-up on the sink, but from the sheer embarrasment of what he seems to have gotten himself into. <br />
Jun can&#39;t help but stifle at the sheer audacity of trying to pull off this look with the kind of physique that he has. Bringing her hand up to cover her mouth as she does so. <br />
<br />
&quot;Jun! It&#39;s not funny! I can&#39;t believe that the saleswoman would give me such a _____ costume like this!&quot; He looks back at the mirror and then back to Jun. The humour in the situation appears to dry up in her mind as she looks back over him and the rest of the accessories. &quot;I think we can make this work, Kelan-kun. Don&#39;t worry about it.&quot; Kelan notices the room spin as the panic in his voice and actions seems to settle down. &quot;Maybe we can body and face paint, use tail and horns with the teeth and then keep pants and shirt ne? I think this maybe best of both. Then maybe as night goes on, you feel more comfortable and natural, ne?&quot; Kelan&#39;s almost hyperventalating state is washed over by a calming wave as he seems to get his head together. &quot;Can you help with the gloves Kelan-kun?&quot; as she holds out her hands. <br />
<br />
Kelan helps to remove her gloves as Jun pulls her long silky hair to the side, rolling up her sleeves and placing the gloves over her open bag. Kelan, standing in front of the bathroom sink hands over some of the red skin paint. &quot;Can you make sure you cover my back? I&#39;ll work on the front.&quot; Jun hops up on the edge of the bath behind him and rubs some of the bright red paint onto her pale hands before rubbing it over Kelans exposed back. Juns small soft hands rubbing over his upper back and shoulders doesnt go unnoticed by Kelan, feeling a slight fullness in the front of his already extremely tight bikini bottoms. He continues to apply the red paint over his face, neck and arms, anywhere that might be exposed, whilst trying to take his mind off the deliberate soft massage he was getting from Jun. The paint applying almost like a thick oil, smoothing out any of the hairs on his forearms and upper chest. &quot;I can&#39;t thank you enough Jun, you&#39;re truely such a supportive girlfriend. I feel like i can really trust you.&quot; The room lurched a little for both of them. &quot;Arigatou, Kelan-kun, I want to help you as much as I can. I feel you really understand me.&quot; She smiled as he turned around, his face now completely crimson, his white teeth showing through. <br />
&quot;I think need accessories!&quot; Jun happily chimes in, grabbing the small black horns and placing them on the sides of his head. &quot;Tail too of course!&quot; grabbing the long spade like tail and attaching it just above his bikini line. Kelan grabs his shirt, pulling it over his now throughly red torso and awkwardly putting on his jeans, now sitting somewhat lower thanks to the tail sticking out over the top. <br />
<br />
&quot;There, You look amazing!&quot; Jun quitely said &quot;You shouldn&#39;t feel embarrased at all, the outfit look great. You&#39;re starting to look like real cute demon girl now!&quot; she smirks. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey now&quot; Kelan says, smiling and eyeing Juns bag. &quot;If im having to wear the accessories, then its only fair that you do too!&quot; Holding up the large cat ears, long black tail and long silk socks . &quot;Here, let me help&quot; He sat down infront of Jun, helping to unbuckle her shoes and slide off her short cotton socks. Her toes and feet equally pale and soft. Slowly sliding the long silk socks up past her defined calves and sliding them up towards her mid thigh. Jun slowly breathed in as Kelans surprisingly soft hands ran up her legs, causing her nipples to stiffen under her corsett before he put the shoes back on her feet. <br />
He managed to find a place to secure the tail just at the base of her lacing at the back and helped to adjust the relatively large ears on the sides of her head. <br />
<br />
&quot;There, you look like such a cute goth cat girl now&quot; Kelan smiled, causing Juns heart to beat a little faster.  &quot;Well I think its time I finally found out what the party is all about yeah?&quot; Taking the cup of pool punch and downing the cup in front of Jun, Kelan opened the door and headed out.</p>
