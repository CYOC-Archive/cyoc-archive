<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A while after Regina left, Darren Struthers entered the building. He was finally done with his morning classes, but he wasn&#39;t ready to rest quite yet. He had a big test in his Economics class tomorrow, and needed to study if he wanted to get above a C. Knowing his roommate was still in class, he intended to make a beeline straight to his room and study for as long as he was able. However, the new addition to the kitchen caught his eye. Curious, he went over to investigate.<br />
<br />
He read the note Regina left behind and couldn&#39;t help but grin as he exclaimed, &quot;Sweet, new coffee maker!&quot; to no one in particular.<br />
<br />
Having stayed up late the night before with his friends, Darren was operating at only about 5 hours of sleep, and thanks to the broken machine he wasn&#39;t able to get his usual cup that morning. Getting one now seemed like the perfect thing to get him through the rest of the day. He scooped out a serving of coffee and dumped it into the coffee maker, then noticed the knob on the side labeled &#39;Strength&#39;. Darren wasn&#39;t entirely sure what that meant, but he figured he didn&#39;t need it all the way at &#39;5&#39;. He turned the knob down to &#39;1&#39;, figuring that it would give him the kick he needed to get through the rest of the day and wear off sometime in the evening so that he could (hopefully) fall asleep early enough to get a good night&#39;s sleep for the test. He grabbed one of the paper cups from the nearby box of them and after making sure it was in the right mode hit the brew button.<br />
<br />
The machine whirred as it started dispensing the coffee into the cup. Before Darren knew it, the cup was filled to the perfect amount. Darren put the plastic lid on the cup, then grabbed the cup and started off to his room. Well, he did after he replaced the filter, of course. He wasn&#39;t sure it actually needed to be replaced every time, but he might as well make Regina happy.<br />
<br />
Darren navigated the halls and finally made it to his room. Breathing a sigh of relief, he set the cup of coffee and bag down and took a moment to look in the mirror at the lanky redhead reflected in it. He wasn&#39;t a bad looking guy by any stretch of the imagination, but even he&#39;d admit that was definitely more in the middle of the hotness scale. At the very least he could stand to work out a bit more to fill himself out with actual muscle.<br />
<br />
Realizing that he was already starting to procrastinate, Darren sighed at the task ahead and grabbed his Economics textbook and coffee. He sat down at his desk and began reading, doing his best to take notes at points he believed would be relevant and occasionally looking up terms online. As he did so, he slowly sipped on the coffee he got from the dorm kitchen. On his first sip he was surprised to find that it had cooled faster than he expected it to. Thus, he started to take bigger sips than he normally would, not having to worry about burning his tongue.<br />
<br />
It was on the fourth such sip that he started to feel... odd. It felt like his body was swelling up, especially around the chest and hips. Darren stopped studying and groaned as the strange feeling became too strong for him to ignore. His first thought was that he was having some kind of allergic reaction to the coffee.<br />
<br />
He got up to reach for his cell phone, but his sense of balance was all screwed up and he fell onto the floor. Darren barely registered the pain, as the swelling sensation was getting worse. He put his hands on his chest and felt it expanding. Startled, he looked down and saw it expanding, only picking up speed as the changes continued. It took several moments for Darren to register that he was growing breasts.<br />
<br />
The shock of this realization was overwhelmed by the tightening sensation around his waist as it continued its expansion. Not being able to take it anymore, he reached around the new protrusions on his torso to unbutton his jeans and kick them off before he ended up tearing them. He laid on the floor panting for several moments longer, his entire body now tingling and shifting under his skin, until finally it tapered off and the changes stopped.<br />
<br />
Darren remained motionless on the floor for a couple of seconds, paralyzed with the shock of what just happened. Slowly, he sat up and looked down at the mounds now stretching his t-shirt out in front of him. He could feel them hanging off his chest, and in disbelief he brought his hands up to cup them.<br />
<br />
His feminine hands.<br />
<br />
His brain now jump-started by this observation, Darren scrambled to his feet, somewhat clumsily thanks to his new proportions. He made his way to the mirror as fast as possible, and what he saw shook him to his core.<br />
<br />
The face he saw in the mirror was only vaguely recognizable to him. A woman that he would call hot as hell if he saw her walking by was staring back at him, her brown eyes wide in terror. Her hair was a similar shade of orange as the old Darren&#39;s, but a bit more vibrant. In fact, thinking about it the woman reminded him of his mother, or a hypothetical younger sister of her at least. Not quite believing what he was seeing, he waved his hand in front of the mirror, to confirm that it was indeed his reflection.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh fuck,&quot; he said aloud, noting with a shudder that he now even sounded like a woman. Wanting to assess the damage to his body, he stripped out of his clothing as quickly as he could. Once he did, he took a long, somewhat awkward look at his new body.<br />
<br />
His new breasts stood out immediately, not just from their size but from the massive areola that capped them. They drooped slightly, no doubt due in part to their size, but they definitely weren&#39;t the perky tits of a college girl. Darren turned around and saw that in addition to wider hips, he now had a good ass to go along with it. Not as massive as his boobs, but definitely plush and healthy looking for the apparent age of his new body, which he was slowly beginning to notice probably had a good decade on his old one at least. Even with the minor wear and tear though, he&#39;d still rate this woman a solid eight at least, likely a nine. He took some small comfort in the fact that he seemed to retain his taste in women.<br />
<br />
He turned back to fully face the mirror and, with a sinking feeling in his stomach, looked down at his crotch. As he feared, his wonderfully average dick was gone, replaced with a vagina crowned with a neatly managed tuft of red pubic hair. He shakily brought his hand down and ran his fingers down the new slit, and shuddered at the sensation he felt. It was far more sensitive than his dick had been, and what little exploration he did of its pink folds was enough to make his crotch damp. The feeling was far from unpleasant, but the scope of his changes was still at the forefront of Darren&#39;s mind.<br />
<br />
Before he could explore much further, Darren was interrupted by a knocking at the door. His head whipped in the direction of the sound, sending red locks of hair over his right eye. His heart leaped in his chest as he realized that he had no idea how he&#39;d be able to explain what just happened to him... mostly because he still wasn&#39;t entirely sure himself. He just hoped that whoever it was, they thought that he was still out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Darren? I know you&#39;re in there, open up!&quot;</p>
