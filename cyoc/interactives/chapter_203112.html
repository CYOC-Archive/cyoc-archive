<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Honestly, I wasn&#39;t quite done with Agent Black. A few ideas had popped into my head and it would have given me ample ability to test out more of the notebook. I quickly added a few lines. &#39;Anything that William Black can use to contact his agency or go to the agency is currently not working. He&#39;s stuck on campus with no way off or way to contact his agency or the agency to contact him until I offer him my phone. All the while, he&#39;ll do whatever I tell him to, happily and without much question.&#39;<br />
<br />
The smell of what was on me hit my nose again. &#39;William Black has something that will make the smell go away.&#39; I quickly added, then headed out of the forest. In the parking lot, William Black was currently sitting in a black vehicle trying his darndest to get the thing to start. But the engine just wouldn&#39;t turn over. He climbed out of it and then lifted up the hood. <br />
<br />
&quot;Having trouble?&quot; I asked, approaching him.<br />
<br />
&quot;No...&quot; Will lied. He was looking around the engine, but there clearly wasn&#39;t anything wrong with it. Then pulled out his phone. Dead. &quot;Are you kidding me!?&quot;<br />
<br />
A coy smile drifted onto my face. The notebook had worked again. &quot;Phone dead?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mind if I use yours?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dead...&quot; I pulled it out. I&#39;d forgotten to charge it the day before and it didn&#39;t last all night. But I also wondered if that was considered an offer. Though, judging by how his car still wouldn&#39;t start, I assumed otherwise. Will put his head against the steering wheel. &quot;How about we just get some lunch? Then I&#39;ll get my phone charged while we eat.&quot;<br />
<br />
He let out a deep breath. &quot;Not really supposed to. But I guess there&#39;s nothing else I can do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OH! Before we go,&quot; I pointed at myself. &quot;You got something for this smell?&quot;<br />
<br />
Will looked at me. &quot;Oh right...&quot; He even added a bit of a chuckle as he reached into a duffle back and pulled out a blue looking ball. Just like the orange one, he squeezed it between his fingertips and a blue powder covered my body. &quot;That should do it. Completely neutralizes the scent. Just in case we have to go back and be civilians for a bit.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Handy,&quot; I said. &quot;C&#39;mon let&#39;s go get some lunch. I&#39;ll buy.&quot; Just like I&#39;d written, without a question William Black followed me through the campus to the sandwich bar. It felt a bit weird having someone who looked to be about 33 following me through the campus who was neither a teacher nor TA but no one seemed to care. That was the difference about college and high school, it was normal for adults to be walking around campus. We went into the building and cool air hit us on the way in. &quot;Go on get whatever you want,&quot; I told him. <br />
<br />
&quot;You sure?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; I was a bit surprised he&#39;d ask that. It was an order, but I guess his curtesy for others was something he held in pretty high regard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright,&quot; Will went up to the bar, pulled out one of the footlong pieces of bread and started loading it up with nearly every kind of meat they had on the bar. Then made sure to add a few veggies. But with just how much he loaded on, it was going to be difficult to properly close. He did his best, but when he smashed the bread completely, he finally gave up as it popped open again. I just grabbed a 6&quot; roast beef and turkey sandwich, then added some lettuce, tomato and vinegar and oil. <br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s go eat outside,&quot; I said as we checked out. &quot;There&#39;s a couple of chargers out there.&quot; Will nodded and then followed me outside. We sat down at one of the benches and I plugged in my phone to the charger. It was the first thing I ever felt my college actually used their money back on the students. It was so much better than the napkin dispensers that didn&#39;t dispense napkins, or the hard plastic chairs that no one wanted to sit in, or the giant black dick looking statue that sat in the middle of the quad. It was supposed to look like a quarter note, slightly tilted but not a single person who looked at it said it looked like anything other than a dick.<br />
<br />
Will&#39;s eyes glanced at it and a smile broke on his stoic face. &quot;Your school really did that?&quot; I didn&#39;t even look back and nodded. He stifled a laugh as his smile only grew bigger. &quot;Guess that&#39;s just part of going to college. Can&#39;t say I&#39;m not a bit jealous.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of the big black dick?&quot; I poked at him more.<br />
<br />
He shook his head, but the smile on his face stayed. &quot;No... Just didn&#39;t get to experience it. You know? You&#39;re lucky to be so young.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not like you&#39;re old. You&#39;re only like 30 something,&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;35,&quot; he specified. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. But you&#39;re built like a truck!&quot; I said. It&#39;s not like he was small. &quot;Give me a flex.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You think?&quot; Will held up his bicep and obeyed the order. The baseball sized muscle bulged, stretching the sleeve of his black shirt. &quot;But I&#39;m still 35...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s not that old...&quot; I stared. Even if he was nearly twice my age, I didn&#39;t want to be thinking that 35 would feel like it was the end of my life. &quot;How tall are you? How much do you weigh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;5&#39;9&quot;. 178 pounds,&quot; he said. &quot;But workouts are starting to get harder. And I still need to be able to keep up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Keep up with the werewolves?&quot; I asked. <br />
<br />
He nodded, taking another bite of his sandwich. &quot;You saw how big your friend got. He may be on the bigger size than I&#39;ve seen, but even the smallest aren&#39;t all that small.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah?&quot; I nodded. &quot;If you could be a werewolf would you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Will let out a hearty laugh, nearly choking on his food. &quot;I so badly want to say no, but I can&#39;t deny how awesome it&#39;d be to be one. They don&#39;t have to workout and are bigger than bodybuilders. They have more energy than they can deal with and have the libido of a teenager. Doesn&#39;t matter how old they get either, they&#39;re strength go with them. But if you&#39;ve seen the shit I have, you&#39;d understand why I can&#39;t be one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But if you could control the beast?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then hell yeah!&quot; Will said. &quot;I&#39;d be able to do whatever I wanted.&quot;<br />
<br />
I nodded absentmindedly. I wondered if I should just turn him into a werewolf, or just hold off on it. Though, the ramifications could have been pretty dire. If his entire life revolved around this agency killing werewolves, I didn&#39;t know what would happen to him. However, that didn&#39;t mean I didn&#39;t have any ideas. I pulled out my notebook once I finished my sandwich. Will&#39;s eyes widened for a second. &quot;I&#39;ve got an idea,&quot; I told him.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you have to write it down now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t want to forget it,&quot; I pointed the eraser of my pencil at him. &quot;How many pushups can you do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pushups?&quot; one of Will&#39;s eyebrows cocked. &quot;Over 100.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;100?!&quot; I sputtered out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. At least. That&#39;s easy.&quot;<br />
<br />
I quickly jotted down my idea. &#39;Every pushup William Black does forces his body to gain another pound of weight. Every 5 he gains a pound of muscle. Every 10 he grows a year younger. Every 15 he grows an inch taller. Every 20 his dick gets 10% bigger.&#39; Then I looked back up at him. &quot;Show me,&quot; I smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Will shrugged his shoulders and then dropped down into the push up position. &quot;One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten.&quot; He counted as he did each one of the reps. It was barely noticeable, but the tight sleeves wrapped around his arms started to look even tighter. The shirt looked like it was pulling tighter against his frame as he continued to do his pushups.<br />
<br />
&quot;One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Twenty.&quot; Will continued to count. The black shirt was really starting to strain. His sleeves jumped up over his shoulders and the bottom of it started to rise up in inch higher. His khaki shorts looked like they were starting to struggle as Will&#39;s ass grew just a bit bigger. The thin waist that he&#39;d clearly spent decades keeping as thin and ripped as possible started to drip down beneath him. The firm abs clearly started to disappear.<br />
<br />
&quot;One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Thirty.&quot; He let out a heavy breath.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you already tired?&quot; I chided him. &quot;I thought you said you could at least do 100.&quot; It didn&#39;t matter that he&#39;d gained at least thirty more pounds onto his body. It was really starting to show now. The shirt that seemed to have been vacuumed sealed to his growing body. The single digit body fat percentage that Will had clearly been working hard to maintain was rapidly growing close to double. With an additional 30 pounds added onto his frame his shirt was really starting to stretch. The belly was starting to get a bit more noticeable, slipping out of the bottom of his shirt. But with his 2 extra inches in height, it wasn&#39;t too bad yet.<br />
<br />
Will gave a determined breath, chanting his, &quot;One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Forty.&quot; His shirt was really starting to strain now. His arms had grown significantly larger as weight was added onto his entire frame. The shirt stretched tightly against his burly muscles and his shorts weren&#39;t doing much better. It looked like the button had come undone and on his 39th rep, he let out a gasp of relief. However, with each rep it was becoming more and more obvious that he wasn&#39;t about to give up. but that didn&#39;t mean his clothes wouldn&#39;t.<br />
<br />
I quickly went back to the notebook. &#39;Noone cares what William Black is or isn&#39;t wearing. He can be on campus completely nude and no one will care.&#39; A sigh of relief left my mouth as I went back to enjoying the show. His big muscular body was rapidly becoming more and more burly. I wanted to squeeze him so badly as more and more soft weight covered his hard muscles. He was rapidly looking more and more like a big fluffy line backer opposed to the lean tough fighter he&#39;d been. His big hands must have still had hard callouses but would be gentle enough to pick me up. <br />
<br />
&#39;Seventy,&#39; Will chanted. I hadn&#39;t even realized that I zoned out. He was still getting bigger. I hadn&#39;t even noticed the hole appearing in his shirt. But a loud tear filled the air as it ripped down his back. His neck was filling the hole completely while the rest of the shirt dangled down onto the ground. The khaki shorts were in even worse shape as they completely ripped off of him. I was a bit surprised to see dark blue boxer briefs currently straining against his legs. His thick meaty quads filled them completely and the stretchy fabric would only be able to last for so long as his ass had doubled in size. Two massive sexy globes stuck out from behind him, shaking ever so slightly as he dropped down for another push up.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t have to keep going,&quot; I said. Worry was starting to take over a bit. He was nearly a decade younger and 50% heavier than he had been. His entire body was nearly double the size it had been. I hadn&#39;t even thought about his boots. The hard leather probably felt so uncomfortable as his shoes constrained his growing feet. He must have been at least a size or two bigger as he had well surpassed 6&#39;. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hell no!&quot; he chanted. The determination in his voice said that he was going to go all the way. And the speed only seemed to pick up as he went up to ninety. By then all of his clothes had shot off of him. Even his shoes couldn&#39;t contain the massive feet contained within them. The hard leather separated from the rubber soles as his toes pushed out past them. Even his socks looked like they weren&#39;t surrounding his feet anymore. <br />
<br />
&quot;No really. You can stop at any time!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;HELL NO!&quot; Will&#39;s voice boomed. Only more determined as he continued doing the pushups. It was more than pride, it was a sheer force of will. Sweat was dripping down his body. Covering every part of his bulky body. I figured he had to be getting tired, but he refused to give up. Going well past 100. Then past 110. Making sure to count each one out. Being over a decade younger, I figured that&#39;s where a lot of his energy was coming from. I just couldn&#39;t believe how much he had. He only seemed to be getting faster. Even as more weight added onto his frame, his arms getting longer, and clothes bursting off of his body, he only wanted to show off just how many he could do.<br />
<br />
&quot;No really!&quot; I repeated. Worry was really starting to overcome me. At the rate he was going, he might have gotten younger than me. &quot;Stop whenever you feel comfortable.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not yet!&quot; Will continued past 120. Then 130. But once he reached 140, it was finally getting to him. He stared at the ground. I could hear his chants getting weaker as he gasped for air. &quot;Three... Four... Five... Si-six..! Se-Seven..! Eight! Ni-nine! One fifty...&quot; he gasped and rolled over onto his back. &quot;One hundred... And Fifty,&quot; he breathed out. &quot;Can&#39;t believe I turned into such a fucking pussy.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit...&quot; I stared at his mountainous body. 25 pushups and I was spent for the rest of the day. I figured that 100 was max. How he could do 150 as he gained 95 pounds of fat I wouldn&#39;t know. Sure, gaining the 30 pounds of muscle probably helped out a bit, but that seemed like too much. &quot;Wait...&quot; I redid the math in my head again. It wouldn&#39;t be 30 pounds of muscle. He&#39;d be losing a year on every 10. But what about the 15. &quot;How much do you weigh?!&quot; I quickly asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh? Something like 330?&quot; Will gripped his hefty belly, squeezing it. &quot;Big ole three-three-zero. Or at least close enough to it. Can&#39;t believe a guy my size got that endurance, huh?&quot; He was still out of breath and face beet red, but he was still bragging about his size. Not to mention, my eyes couldn&#39;t help but wander a bit further down. Even not erect, he was absolutely massive. At least 6 inches soft and definitely a grower.<br />
<br />
&quot;And--And you&#39;re height?&quot; I hazard to ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;6&#39;7,&quot; he smirked. &quot;Big guy gotta be big.&quot; He rolled over and stood up on his knees, giving me a flex of his arm. The small perfectly sculpted baseball had grown into a full on watermelon. He was clearly strong. Just looking at that size, there was a shit ton of muscle built into that arm. But I couldn&#39;t believe just how big he&#39;d gotten. It was hard to believe that he&#39;d nearly doubled his weight and grown six inches taller. But when he stood up, it was obvious. I got a full view of his big muscular belly right in my face. I barely came up to his chest, when we&#39;d almost held an eye line just minutes before. Part of me wanted to bury my face deep into the massive man, feel his soft but strong features as he stood there. &quot;Now,&quot; he looked down on me. &quot;Can I use your phone?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s get back to my room first, then you can use it,&quot; I said. He let out a grunt, then picked me up and threw me over his shoulder. &quot;H-hey!&quot; I felt my face slam into his wide back. And looking down I had a perfect view of his bulbous ass. Those thick babies looked amazing.<br />
<br />
&quot;This&#39;ll be faster,&quot; Will said. He started running towards the dorms.<br />
<br />
&quot;But my phone!&quot; he spun around and took me back to the table, not letting me off his shoulder, only lowering me enough to grab my phone. He started off again. &quot;MY NOTEBOOK!&quot; A deep sigh left him as he spun around again, this time going into a full squat with me on his shoulder and then we were officially off to the dorms. He skipped the elevator and just took the stairs, fireman carrying me all the way up to the third floor. It wasn&#39;t until we were in front of my room that he finally let me down, only to get the door open. &quot;You really were in a rush,&quot; I said as I opened the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;I need to be. I can&#39;t spend all day here. My mission is supposed to observe, not interact with,&quot; he said. &quot;Can I please use your phone?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, you can use my phone,&quot; I handed it to him. But as he dialed the number I quickly went back to the notebook. &#39;William Black is a student at Montana University. He&#39;s got a scholarship on the football team and is a first-string linebacker. He trains harder for powerlifting and simply uses football as a more functional way to use his body. He is still part of the agency he works for, but his mission is to interact and make sure the werewolf is under control rather than to observe from afar. Making friends is the best way to interact, therefore his primary objective is to interact with the other students along with their activities.&#39; <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll be just a minute. Please don&#39;t listen,&quot; Will said as he went into the bathroom. I did as I was told, watching that marvelously built ass all the way in there. <br />
<br />
&quot;Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!&quot; I scolded myself. He can&#39;t be naked. Even if I&#39;d made it normal, he shouldn&#39;t be naked. I quickly added another line. &#39;I have clothes that&#39;ll fit William Black.&#39; Instantly an XXL t-shirt with the school&#39;s logo appeared on it along with some massive workout shorts, some socks and a massive pair of shoes. I held the shirt up to my body. &quot;Woah...&quot; A stupid smile appeared on my face as I measured it against me. I couldn&#39;t believe how big it was. My head could fit through one of the sleeves.<br />
<br />
&quot;Having fun?&quot; Will asked as he returned. My face went bright red. &quot;It&#39;s fine. I know I&#39;m big.&quot; He held up his arm for another flex. &quot;And I&#39;m well aware you like it. Intel and all.&quot; Even adding a bump of his pecs as he took the shirt and shorts from me. He slipped on shirt and pulled the shorts over his legs. &quot;But everything&#39;s fine. They said as long as I was getting closer to the subject, I wouldn&#39;t be in trouble. I just have to go back sometime to make sure all my equipment is in working order.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright!&quot; I clapped my hands. &quot;So now what?&quot;</p>
