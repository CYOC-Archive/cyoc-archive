<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jess decided the best option was to find her supplier.  The girl probably had some kid of antidote, something that could nullify the effects of the pills.  She grabbed her keys and ran out of the house.<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Upstairs, Chelsea eagerly awaited her changes.  Usually the changes were slow, and she didn&#39;t really even notice them.  But she had a feeling that the massive dose was going to have really positive effect on Jess.  Well, on both of them she guessed. She opened the closet to look at her shrine.  She wasn&#39;t that worried if Jess destroyed it.  Then the changes would be permanent.  But she felt a little affectionate towards the little guy who had helped her so much.  She wanted to make sure he was okay.<br />
<br />
She was shocked by the change in the statue.  It was now frowning, and the scales were tilted towards Jess&#39; side.  Something was missing, something that was causing the scales to tip in Jess&#39; favor.  She examined the scale, and saw that the tampon was gone.  She had to find a replacement item, something with Jess&#39; blood.  And she had to hurry.  She already felt a little weaker.  She had to find Jess and get her blood before she realized what was going on.  She considered just destroying the statue.  But the angry look on its face made her think that was a bad idea.  She doubted that would stop the transfer.  <br />
<br />
She raced around the house, calling out for Jess.  But she was gone.  Chelsea ran out of the house in a desperate attempt to find her before it was too late.<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Jess felt so full of energy that she decided to jog to the store rather than take her car.  As she ran, her legs felt good.  They burned, but in a pleasurable way.  And she didn&#39;t feel tired at all.  She didn&#39;t notice as she grew taller, drawing up her shirt and exposing her tight midriff with a developing six pack.  She didn&#39;t notice as her thickening thighs pushed tightly against the cuff of her shorts. She didn&#39;t notice the odd stares of strangers as they watched her run by.  It was the pain in her shoes that finally got her attention.  She thought the running had made her feet sore.  She sat down on a bench, and struggled to pull her sneakers off her larger feet.  She rubbed them with her hands, and was shocked to feel them growing in her hands.  She stood up, and noticed that she was now taller than most of the people in the park, even with her shoes off.  She looked down, and saw her chest ballooning, ripping the straps of her bra, and pressing tightly against her shirt.<br />
<br />
The pills, she thought.  They must be starting to affect me.  Chelsea is already humungous.  If she gets this kind of power, she will become an unstoppable monster.  I have to get to the supplement store and talk to Chris.<br />
<br />
Jess jumped up and continued to run.  It felt so great to grow.  She could understand why her sister Chelsea liked being so big.  It was nice to be the tall one for once, looking down at everyone instead of craning your neck up to have a conversation.  She was really enjoying herself, until she heard the first rip.  It was followed by many more, as her clothes were torn apart by her growing body.  She had to sneak down the alleys to get to the store unseen.  She peaked in the window, and saw Chris working alone with no customers in the store.  She jumped inside, and locked the door behind her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chris, Chris!  I need your help,  &quot; said Jess.  <br />
<br />
Chris was a short girl, just about five feet tall.  She had short red hair, fair skin, and a smattering of freckles across her face.  She was very well developed, with generous D-cup breasts.  But she kept in shape, and had slim toned physique.  Chris turned and stared at Jess with shock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit, Jess!  What the hell happened to you!&quot; said Chris, as she ogled Jess&#39; body.<br />
<br />
Jess blushed, and tried in vain to cover her exposed genitals and breast. &quot;It&#39;s those pills!  My sister forced me to take all of them at once, and then I just grew!&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris&#39; jaw dropped.  &quot;Your sister forced you to do it? You mean she is even bigger than you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, and she is going to get even bigger if we don&#39;t do something quick.  Do you have an antidote?  Something that can maybe neutralize the pills or something?&quot; asked Jess.<br />
<br />
Chris just continued to stare at Jess with admiration.  She was envious.  She had always been small, too.  She worked out, but she knew no matter how hard she tried she would never be as beautiful as Jess was now.  She reached out and touched her thick thighs, and washboard abs. Jess slapped her hand away.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is wrong with you?  We don&#39;t have time for games.  Quick!  I need the antidote!&quot; said Jess.<br />
<br />
Chris chuckled.  &quot;I hate to tell you this - but there is no antidote.  Because the pills don&#39;t work.  It was just some snake oil.  Something to sell to gullible people.  I think something else caused you to grow.  But I am beginning to think maybe I should try them again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?  You mean there is no way to reverse this? I am stuck like a freak!&quot; said Jess.<br />
<br />
Chris moved closer, placing an arm around Jess&#39; tight waist, brushing against her firm ass. &quot;Oh, I wouldn&#39;t call you a freak.  You have a body I would kill for.  I think you are pretty hot, and I know quite a bit of other people who would think so, too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jess blushed.  &quot;Really?  You think I am pretty?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty? No, you are gorgeous.  But what is the deal with your sister?  Is she like you, too? You must have good genes, &quot; said Chris.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no, my sister.  She is going to steal all this strength and I can&#39;t stop it,&quot; said Jess.<br />
<br />
&quot;Steal your strength?  What are you talking about?  Why don&#39;t you calm down, have a seat, and tell me about it?&quot; said Chris. <br />
<br />
Chris brought a large blanket for Jess to wear from the back of the store, along with a cup of cocoa.  Then Jess sat down, and told her about the shrine.</p>
