<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I’m standing in the living room, admiring my handsome body. I’m not afraid to admit it... I’m a total narcissist. I love the way my tight athletic sport clothes struggle to cover up my muscular body. Yeah, check out those biceps and those abs, look at my pecs, look at those two bad boys sporting erected nipples...! Damn I’m such a stud. I’d marry myself if I could.<br />
<br />
Needless to say I’m the target of numerous envious looks at any gym. I’d get into the bodybuilding if I wanted to but I’m not only a good looking guy from the neck down... My face is so perfectly symmetrical, just look at my bright eyes! A face like this belongs in the cover of a magazine! That’s why I was aiming to be a professional model. The world needs me, Kris Stevens, as the underwear model being plastered in every single billboard worldwide!<br />
<br />
I blew my mirror reflection a kiss and I was about to continue on my day when I noticed a tiny inconsistency.<br />
<br />
My mirror reflection hadn’t blown me a kiss in return.<br />
<br />
Thinking about it, since when do I have a full-length mirror in the middle of the living room? The angle was all wrong too. I should be directly looking into my own eyes but I had to look up at them. It was like my reflection had grown taller.<br />
<br />
...That made absolutely no sense. Your own reflection can’t outgrow you. Or maybe... had I shrunk shorter somehow? No, that couldn’t possibly be it... Could it?<br />
<br />
I felt like my heart skipped a beat when my reflection’s eyes started scanning the living room with a cold, pierceful stare. ‘He’ lifted ‘his’ arms and examined them.  He wasn’t admiring his muscle mass like I usually did, instead he was calmly inspecting them like a police offer examined evidence, checking for any possible abnormalities.<br />
<br />
It was very surreal, seeing my body acting on his own like that. I tried lifting my leg, but ‘he’ didn’t. Our movements didn’t match at all.<br />
<br />
My body took out from his pocket what looked like a heavily modified cellphone that I had never seen before. After turning it on, to my utter surprise and amazement ‘he’ spoke.<br />
<br />
“This is G-67. The neural swap has been a success.” At the other side of the line a voice that sounded like a bunch of meaningless high-pitched shrieks could be heard. “The N-device found me the closest healthy Earthling body it could find. Yes, I already hid the N-device where no dumb human would possibly find it before swapping. Those government agents chasing me around have no idea I’ve swapped bodies with a local. Should I let the old ‘me’ get captured, as a decoy?... Understood.” My body touched his own throat with surprise. “There appears to be a minor setback, my vocal chords can only speak in the Earthling’s language, why’s that?... A ‘completely expected side effect’? Don’t come at me with that shit...!” The voice on the strange communicator screeched a long list of excuses. “Fuck it. I’ll deal with it. Somehow.” My body hung up. “That freaking engineer, I’ll tear his breeding hole apart!” He sighed with annoyance.<br />
<br />
I crossed my arms, deep in thought. So that was it. I had been body swapped with an alien invader from outer space... Wait, what?! This was some crazy dream. It had to be... I’ll try pinching my cheek.<br />
<br />
At least that was about to try, but I got too fucking scared when instead of my regularly handsome hand I saw a purplish-grey three-fingered monstrosity reaching out to me!<br />
<br />
I shrieked in utter terror! Oh, shit, shit, it can’t be! I really am in an alien invader’s body?! Fuck! ...A mirror! I needed a mirror! I need to see my handsome face...! I stormed out from the living room, my own body staring at me like I had just gone nuts. I wanted to pry the restroom open ASAP but trying to turn the knob with my new thin and long skeletal-like fingers while in a state of utter panic was harder than I’d hoped for.<br />
<br />
After struggling with the knob for what seemed like a painful eternity I managed to open the door to the small restroom, a mirror on top of the lavatory awaiting me for the scare of a lifetime.<br />
<br />
I shrieked with an high-pitched cry that could’ve made my own ears bled. If I still had visible ears, that is. My head was a now shaped like an purple bulb with no ears or nose that I could see. Two black ovals stared back at me, lifeless like an insect’s. My mouth extremely small. I grasped my own face with my long fingers in disbelief. I looked like straight out from a vintage science fiction movie. I screamed and screamed. This couldn’t be! I was destined to be a beautiful underwear model! Why did I look so hideous?!<br />
<br />
I was hyperventilating through my tiny slit of a mouth. But the horror didn’t end there. Oh, no. I had already noticed that my alien body was too fucking short yet that was no big deal in comparison to my new muscular definition. Or a lack of one. I wasn’t wearing any clothes at all so I could see right away that my stereotypical Grey alien chest had barely any meat on it. I looked so fragile with my skeletal structure in plain view like that. I had no pecs, just two tiny nipples lost in a sea of grey. I had no abs, just an extremely slim, malnourished excuse of a gut. My legs were very separated apart, incapable of covering up my crotch area by themselves. The three toes on both of my bare feet squirmed in shame... Did I mention my groin was utterly, embarrassingly, completely blank?<br />
<br />
I ashamedly covered up my blank groin with both of my ugly hands. NO!! My cock!! What happened to my beautiful cock?! My trustful anaconda, where is it?! I don’t even have a bulge! How am I going to model in my underwear with no bulge?!<br />
<br />
I searched my pelvis frantically trying to find any traces of genitalia. But no luck. There was absolutely nothing. No penis. Not even a peeing hole. Just a completely desolate patch of irrelevant blank skin.<br />
<br />
Let’s be honest, I looked too fucking hideous! This was completely unfair! I’ve spent all of my life taking care of my healthy body, working out, buying expensive beauty products and eating healthy just to end like this?!<br />
<br />
“I expected you’d react negatively, but not at this level. You’re a very peculiar Earthling indeed.” Said my old handsome voice right behind my pitiful alien body.<br />
<br />
Him! It was all because of that body thief! I’ll punch him on the face...! No, wait, actually I don’t want to damage that handsome face, I’ll just tell him what I think!<br />
<br />
I turned and with my oval black eyes still squirting purple slimy tears I opened my slit of a mouth and...<br />
<br />
“Ghyyyyyghghgygghgyy!!!! Ghygyhghy?!!”<br />
<br />
...out came an incomprehensible string of alien-sounding high-pitched shrieks.<br />
<br />
“Ghyyyghyghgyy!!!”<br />
<br />
“Unfortunately I can’t understand a single thing you spew out.” The body thief shrugged. “It’s a side effect of the neural swap, you see. The engineers are still ironing out the kinks. Languages don’t carry over through different brains that well so given enough time you won’t even be able to read or write in your original language.”<br />
<br />
What was this freaking thief saying?! I could understand him perfectly! Don’t try to confuse me you fucking shithead!<br />
<br />
“Ghyhghgygy!” I jumped up and down in anger.<br />
<br />
“I gotta say, your body doesn’t look half bad. All this extra mass will surely help with self-defense...” He flexed his biceps. This fucker! I’m the real Kris Stevens but he was acting cocky, flexing like he had attained those muscles himself! “What are these annoying pieces armor, though? They’re so thin, I don’t think they’d help in a melee battle much. They just limit my mobility...”<br />
<br />
How he dared to mock my taste in clothes! I only buy from top brands! To my surprise he removed his shirt. Seeing his hot bare chested bod only made me more furious. That hot bod is mine, you thief!<br />
<br />
“Ahh, much better. You wear so much junk. What are these things on my feet? My toes feel constricted. Five toes... Why do you fit so many toes inside such a small space like that? In my planet we don’t wear such silly things even with not nearly as many toes...<br />
<br />
“Ghyghgyghy!” Don’t throw my sneakers off the window like that, you jerk! They were so expensive!<br />
<br />
The invader removed the pants as well, exposing my luxurious boxers.<br />
<br />
“TWO layers of armor on the lower part?!” He yelled with surprise. “Why the fuck would you need so much protection on your crotch? So much useless protection in all the wrong parts...”<br />
<br />
“Ghyghgy...!” I felt myself blushing. He was undressing right there like it was no big deal. Seeing my own hot body doing that for me made me feel a bit shameful. Considering I masturbate while watching my own homemade videos of myself stripping, my own body doing so in front of me felt... weirdly arousing...<br />
<br />
Shit! Now is when I’d normally get an erection, but my tackle was now the alien invader’s property! I felt a strange itch in my lower parts but there was no way for me to scratch it...! Did this hideous alien body had an anus, even? I patted my strangely rubbery alien butt, my long finger searching for any orifice that’d let me relief the itch burning my loins... Wait, no, I’m not that kind of guy!<br />
<br />
The thief removed his boxers, his whole body giving me a private show. My alien fingers yearned to touch that prime example of a human being! But even so, the body snatcher was dissatisfied at the huge amount of muscle and body mass he was still ‘wearing’. He tried to pull my six pack off before he realized with surprise that those abdominals were part of my body. He turned around and spread his buttcheeks apart. Feeling cool air penetrating his hole seemed to relax him. “Ah, much better, I was about to suffocate.” He stretched out his whole body, feeling big and strong like never before. There was just one other thing he didn’t figure out the use for yet.<br />
<br />
“What the hell...? More unnecessary junk? What’s with this huge thing?” He asked pointing at my pride and glory. I felt myself salivating at the sight of the manhood I used to have. He reached for it and tried to pull it off. “It’s stuck in my pelvis! Ew! Smells putrid too!”<br />
<br />
The body snatcher gave a few steps around the living room. “I knew it. This weird thing is the cause of the discomfort I feel as I walk, not those layers of armor...! What the fuck, is it some kind of worm parasite? Are these two big bumps its sack eggs? Disgusting! How can you walk around with something like this between your legs? Take this gross thing off me!”<br />
<br />
“Gyy! Gygghgyghy!” It’s not gross! It’s the bulge that’ll lead me to stardom!<br />
<br />
“Look at those ball-shaped things swinging around as I move! This will be a disadvantage in battle! I gotta remove it...!”<br />
<br />
“GYY?!” What the hell?! He couldn’t just ‘remove’ *that*!<br />
<br />
“Where is a laser knife when you need it? Fuck...”<br />
<br />
Crap! This crazy alien was really capable of cutting it off! I needed to convey to him how valuable that specific part was, but how could I show him the joy of having genitals without being able to communicate with words...?! Oh, I know!<br />
<br />
“Gygyghy!” I walked next to my human body and extended my arms, my three-fingered hands desperate to touch the gorgeous penis I used to have.<br />
<br />
“What is it?” The intruder asked me, trying to comprehend why I’d want to touch such a smelly and dirty-looking thing.<br />
<br />
Yeah, it wasn’t a glamorous solution, but I was sure that if I gave him a handjob he’d realize how great genitals could be! “Ghy...” I looked at his eyes (fuck, they were gorgeous!) and hoped he’d understand.<br />
<br />
“Oh, I know, you must be hungry. Sure, you can have this parasite. I for one sure don’t want it.”<br />
<br />
“Ghhy?” No, that wasn’t what I-<br />
<br />
My former body grabbed both sides of my bulbous alien head. He made me kneel and opened my tiny slit of a mouth with his huge human fingers violating its inside.<br />
<br />
“Shit, you’re salivating like mad. I didn’t realize my body was that hungry before the neural swap...”<br />
<br />
“Ghghgh...!” No! I’m not about to-<br />
<br />
Before I could have any say on the matter my former flaccid cock was being introduced into my tiny mouth. The taste was salty and weird. I’d never tasted a cock before, much less my own! It barely could fit inside the tiny cavity I had of a mouth. The worst part was, I knew perfectly well how big and wide that cock could get in a few short seconds...<br />
<br />
“What the fuck...? Your mouth makes me feel kind of good...” My assaulter’s face reddened, his expression changing to one of pleasure. And, as I predicted, the organ in my mouth rapidly expanded and I could no longer breathe through it. Thankfully I could still breathe through some other hole, which was weird because I didn’t notice any nose or ears when I looked at my alien body through the restroom mirror.<br />
<br />
My former body didn’t take long to rebel in the new feelings he was experiencing through such an insignificant-looking organ... Which is to say, he had rapidly begun fucking my face.<br />
<br />
“Shit! Oh, fuck, fuck!” His grip on my head got tougher and meaner, his cock filling my whole head. I wasn’t sure of it biologically-speaking but I think he was literally fucking the brains out of me! He squeezed my ballooning head really hard and my vision spun in circles as his cock raped the fuck out of my alien face.<br />
<br />
He was treating my rubbery alien head like a latex sex toy, in fact my brain being fucked by cock and the precum overflowing through my black eyes didn’t make me much more of a condom to him...!<br />
<br />
“GHG...GHGY...!” I couldn’t yell much louder than that...<br />
<br />
“Oh goddammit, what’s this surge?! This feeling on my chest...! I can feel my whole body about to come into the most intense pleasure...! FUUUCK!!!”<br />
<br />
I couldn’t take no more. His huge muscular grip forcing my head on his cock and his pelvic thrusts completely deformed my alien head and there were lots of cum overflowing through my eyes slits. I could only see white!<br />
<br />
*POP!*<br />
<br />
My head had popped like an overfilled balloon or a souffle. That was it. Fucked to death by my own body and nobody would recognize my weird-looking corpse. That was my bizarre end...<br />
<br />
...Or maybe not. After blacking out for a few moments, I felt my vision come back to me.<br />
I could see the body snatcher was still there, camping naked around my room. Of course,  he hadn’t felt the need to panic even one bit because he obviously knew the heads of his species could pop and regenerate in a few minutes like nothing had ever happened.<br />
<br />
“Ghyghgyghgy!” I yelled at him, my voice even more high-pitched and squeakier than before as my head was still slowly reinflating. He seemed amused at my comical showcase of incomprehensible retorts, but he didn’t bother to answer to any of my pathetic pleas to give me my body back.</p>
