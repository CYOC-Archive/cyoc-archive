<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>While I am not against others adding to Animalia, there are better times to be doing so. Marcella&#39;s arc was interesting for both character and world-building. However, it also ended up taking up a lot more time and causing a very significant amount of backlog. Under other circumstances, I would have welcomed this chapter. However, we already have more than enough chapter options to go through right now.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to add a chapter to Animalia, please do so when there is a low amount of chapter options. We full-time writers of this thread have enough on our plates without additional ideas being thrown in by one-time writers.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeremy thought as fast as he could. Eris had drank that entire canister of Animalian Quickshot. Which means she at least won&#39;t be contagious. However, it was also turning her into a literal grizzly bear. Already, Eris was growing bigger. She was probably already as tall as him, but now she was growing taller. As she grew, more hair was quickly growing over her body, thickening into a thick brown coat of fur. The straps of her sandals were splitting apart as her feet grew, her growing claws helping with that. Her ears were rising up towards the top of her head, getting big and rounder as they grew fuzzy. Eris grunted as her face started pushing out, her dark nose and sharp canines looking less out of place as she was growing a muzzle.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m starting...to feel...good...&quot; moaned Eris. There was something about that moan that caught Jeremy&#39;s attention. It was sounding a lot less like a little girl&#39;s voice, and it wasn&#39;t just because she was becoming a bear. Looking up at Eris, he could see that her dress was straining even more to contain her body and it was beginning to lose at key places. Particularly, it was ripping at the hips, which were starting to grow wider. Jeremy recalled that the Quickshot canister said it was enough for a double-dose. So Eris wasn&#39;t just becoming an Animalian, she was growing into a fully-mature adult.<br />
<br />
To emphasize this, the front of Eris&#39;s dress started bulging out. Eris moaned deeper as she brought her hands up to her bulging chest, feeling the mounds that were forming on it. The dress was ripping even more as her body grew too large to contain it. It was splitting down her widening back and her broadening shoulders. Too soon after that, it reached its final threshold and everything snapped off, including the ill-fitting pair of panties she was wearing.<br />
<br />
It was very awkward for Jeremy to be staring up at a naked Eris. Even if she was an anthro bear now, her body had clearly grown to that of a teenager. He might guess she was about his age, but clearly she was still growing bigger. Her voice had lost its whiny pitch and growing huskier with arousal. She was tweaking the nipples of her breasts which were growing from mounds to spheres. Her hips and ass were growing to womanly proportions as the fur between her legs were starting to dampen with her first secretions.<br />
<br />
Jeremy was embarrassed to admit he was getting aroused in spite of himself. Hopefully, Eris wouldn&#39;t notice his hardon. The last thing he wanted was Eris using him to scratch her growing itch. Fortunately, it seemed her flooding hormones was keeping her from being aware of him. In fact, her eyes were closed as she played with her growing boobs. Jeremy realized this was the moment to escape. He crawled away from the growing she-bear, grabbing the Quickshot canister as he went. Fortunately, Eris&#39;s self-centered nature was working in his favor. She was so busy pleasuring herself, she didn&#39;t even notice as he crawled out of the kitchen. The last he saw was Eris rolling her tongue out as one of her hands reached between her legs.<br />
<br />
Jeremy ran out of the house as soon as he could, though it was rather hard to run with a raging stiffie. When he was outside, he read the side of the canister. He knew there was nothing about undoing the Quickshot, but there were plenty of warnings. Yes, including a hotline number in case of an accident. He pulled out his phone and dialed in the number.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for calling Horizon Labs Emergency Hotline,&quot; said an automated voice on the other end, &quot;If this is a life-threatening situation that requires immediate Animalian conversion/uplifting, press 1. If a recently-converted/uplifted Animalian has lost control over themselves, press 2. If a wrong delivery has been made and you&#39;ve become a different Animalian than you wanted to be, press 3. If someone unintended to become an Animalian has been converted by mistake, press 4. If the formula you received is contagious and has-&quot; Jeremy hit &#39;4&#39;, though he doubted Eris converted herself by mistake. &quot;Please hold while we get a representative. Be prepared to give your name and address so we can send someone to contain the incident.&quot; Jeremy tapped his foot as he waited. He really wished his stiffie would go down, but he had a feeling the image of that sexy she-bear pleasuring herself was going to be staying in his head for a long time.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Fortunately, the whole incident was very easy to contain. Eris was so overwhelmed by her estrogen that she didn&#39;t bother to go after Jeremy until cops from Animalia PD showed up. Thankfully, there wasn&#39;t going to be another media circus as there were no actual arrest. As Alexandria Lynx was able to explain, the situation that led to Eris converting herself was very circumstantial and couldn&#39;t possibly be considered an act of terrorism. The only crimes she could be considered guilty of are theft and simple battery. However, neither Stephanie nor Jeremy were wanting to press charges. Stephanie blamed herself for not being there to receive her delivery and giving Eris the opportunity to get into mischief. And Jeremy wasn&#39;t about to get Eris into legal trouble over a short-lived tantrum, even if she was being a brat.<br />
<br />
That wasn&#39;t to say that Eris was off the hook. Stephanie had paid a fair amount of money for that Quickshot and Horizon Labs might not be so quick to provide her another or reimburse her if they determine she is not responsible enough. While accidents do happen, she could have arranged for the delivery to be made at a time that she would have been home. As such, Eris was going to owe for what she paid for that first Quickshot.<br />
<br />
Her father could see that he had clearly allowed his daughter too much free reign. However, he wasn&#39;t about to throw her out of the house. In fact, Eris was going to be grounded for quite a long time. Not only was she going to be doing her homework without any screentime at all, but she was going to be doing a lot of extra studying this summer. Just because she had the body of an adult bear, it doesn&#39;t mean she was going to skip the rest of her education. At the end of summer, there was going to be an exam to determine whether Eris was going to spend the rest of her middle school years being home-schooled or if she could begin high school at WSA. Fortunately, her double-dosing had given Eris a touch more maturity, though she was still rather willful. Mr. Bernstein was going to have his hands full keeping his bigger daughter in line. He may require a conversion himself in order to be able to enforce his discipline.<br />
<br />
But the real one coming under fire was the delivery man who had dropped off the Quickshot in the first place. Between this incident and the one at the Parker and Erickson households, it was becoming increasingly clear that common couriers are being too careless with what is technically hazardous material. While Quickshot formulas may be unable to start an outbreak, the wrong person getting them is too likely a possibility. As such, either a more specialized delivery procedure was needed to make sure that the Animalia samples are delivered directly to the specific person who ordered them or a completely separate delivery force needed to be established apart from typical couriers.</p>
