<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Had a bit of writers block for a few days. Pretty sure I still do but I wanted to try and at least get something out.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It had been a few hours since Connor returned home from Logan’s shop, and the evening had progressed like it normally did. Dinner was on the table when he’d gotten home by 5:30, and his parents had already taken their seats by the time he joined them. For the first few minutes, everything was quiet, until his dad decided to strike up a conversation.<br />
<br />
“So, how’d the job fair go today?” he asked. “Anything worth looking into?” <br />
<br />
Connor shrugged, taking a sip of water before answering. “Yeah, I think so. There’s this guy, Logan, who owns an auto shop on the edge of town. He offered to teach me some stuff, even offered me a job that I decided to accept.”<br />
<br />
His mom’s eyes lit up a bit. “That’s great news! You think you’ll enjoy it?” <br />
<br />
Connor paused for a second to consider. “I mean, I can’t say just yet. So far though, I think it’ll be interesting. Got to change the oil in a truck today.”<br />
<br />
His dad raised an eyebrow. “You? Changing oil?”<br />
<br />
Connor smirked, shrugging again. “Yeah, Logan walked me through it. He seems like a decent guy.”<br />
<br />
His dad grunted, giving a nod but still looking a bit skeptical. “Just make sure this guy isn’t yanking your chain. You’ve never worked with cars before.”<br />
<br />
“I know, I know,” Connor said, a little defensive but not wanting to push back too hard. “It’s just part-time for now. I’ll see how it goes.”<br />
<br />
His mom smiled, clearly more optimistic. “Well, it’s good you’re giving something a try. Who knows? You might actually enjoy it.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Connor mumbled, not wanting to mention to either of his parents how nervous he actually was. He knew well that his dad wasn’t going to be satisfied until he saw real results, and Connor could already feel the weight of those expectations.<br />
<br />
After dinner, Connor retreated to his room. He tried distracting himself with his phone, but his thoughts kept circling back to Logan. Something about the way Logan had treated him all day—relaxed, patient, but with that underlying intensity—stuck with him. Connor couldn’t shake it.<br />
<br />
Now, lying in bed, he was ready to fall asleep. His room was quiet, the only sound being that of the evening breeze blowing through the curtains. He glanced at his phone to check the time: 9:00. He was never usually this tired so early in the evening, but after everything that’d happened that day, he could hardly keep his eyes open. Pretty soon, Connor was fast asleep.<br />
<br />
Barely thirty minutes had passed before a pair of clawed hands gripped the windowsill. Logan hoisted himself up with the same ease as the night before, slipping silently into Connor’s room once again. His hulking frame blended into the shadows, but his amber eyes gleamed as they locked onto the sleeping figure.<br />
<br />
Connor lay undisturbed, breathing steadily, unaware of the presence looming just feet away. Logan&#39;s tongue flicked over his lips, a low rumble vibrating in his chest. He’d been careful the night before, offering the man just a taste—a hint of what was coming. But tonight, there would be no holding back. It was time for a real dose. <br />
<br />
Moving closer to the top of the bed, Logan began to rub his semi-erect member, doing his best to stifle a moan. With his free hand, he lightly ran his claws through Connor’s thickening hair, grinning devilishly. He wasn’t going to just give his mate-to-be another small dose and run. No, this time, it would be far more intimate. <br />
<br />
Logan climbed onto the bed, the wooden frame creaking slightly from the increased weight that had been placed on it. He threw one leg over Connor’s body, straddling the sleeping man. He leaned forward and gripped the headboard, holding his erect cock just a few inches away from Connor’s mouth. He knew this wasn’t right, that everything he was about to do could end up making things worse, but the beast didn’t care. The beast <i>needed</i> this. <br />
<br />
With a low growl, Logan slowly thrust his hips forward, guiding the tip of his cock to Connor’s lips. He pushed forward a bit more, letting out a low gasp as he felt his cock slip into the young man’s mouth. This was it. There was no turning back now. <br />
<br />
Slowly, the werewolf began to thrust his length in and out of Connor’s mouth, growling in satisfaction as he did so. His tail began to wag as the first few inches of his member up and down Connor’s tongue, making sure that the unsuspecting young man below him would be craving werewolf cock for days to come. <br />
<br />
A soft, unconscious moan from the man below him made Logan’s cock throb. Surely it wouldn’t hurt if he went a bit deeper, right? After all, it wasn’t like Connor was going to wake up and catch him. The first few days following the initial infection drains the energy of the infected individual as their body requires it to adapt to what’s happening to them. <br />
<br />
Lust getting the better of him, the werewolf began to thrust deeper, his jaw opening as his tongue lolled out of his mouth. He closed his eyes and moaned quietly, doing his best to keep the noise down. Logan rubbed Connor’s head affectionately, his thrusts picking up speed as he felt his orgasm approaching. Just a bit more, and Connor would be his. <br />
<br />
With a final moan of pleasure, Logan felt his furry balls tense up before strings of hot, thick lupine cum escaped down Connor’s throat. The werewolf held the man’s head on his cock, making sure that the majority was swallowed. He had to make sure Connor got as much as possible. Of course, that wouldn’t be much of a problem thanks to the size of werewolf loads. <br />
<br />
After what felt like an eternity, Logan’s orgasm finally slowed down. Panting, the wolf slowly and reluctantly pulled his cock out of the sleeping man’s mouth, watching as a string of saliva stretched between his still-erect cock and his mate-to-be’s lips. <br />
<br />
“Sorry I had to do this while you were asleep, kid,” Logan said quietly to Connor’s sleeping figure. “This was for your own good. As long as you have my scent, none of the other werewolves will hurt you.” He ran his claws through the sleeping man’s hair, caressing him gently. <br />
<br />
“You’ll be changing a lot tomorrow…so much that I might have to help you finish. You’ll be such a sexy werewolf when you’re transformed. You’re going to love the new you.” <br />
<br />
Logan stepped away from the bed and moved toward the window much like he had done the night prior. He climbed onto the windowsill and took one last look at Connor before leaping onto the ground below and running off into the night.</p>
