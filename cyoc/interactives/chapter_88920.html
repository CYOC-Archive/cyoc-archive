<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Casper Thomas remembered the griffin and newest lion man. Casper remembered the ring before had only changed a person&#39;s spouse if they were TG&#39;ed by the change. But now it seemed the ring did so automatically, and to any spouse their children had. Was that a random fluke due to the increase in the ring&#39;s power? Or was it a set rule now? <br />
<br />
Casper thought of Lana&#39;s cheer squad and Tommy&#39;s team, how he had made them into the same species with similar themes (bulls and vixens). He remembered how he had begun letting people make the choice of their form unconsciously, but at the same time, that bad been early on, and the ring seemed to take what he did early on VERY seriously. Much like a child does their early lifeless lessons. <br />
<br />
It was VERY POSSIBLE that just like with the families who were all changed of a parent was, he had set a precedent with the teams to all become the same species type.<br />
<br />
He wonder about the scar of the lion man, so extreme heat COULD effect a Synthetic, maybe it was how they could get tattoos? Then again, his ring HAD pretty much branded him with its pattern with his hoof digit. <br />
<br />
He also wondered how to explain to Ashley that his parents had taught him to &#39;wait until marriage.&#39; He had no doubt that Ashley loved her, even if for him it had been a few years, for year it had been most of their lives. <br />
<br />
That made him think about Synthetics handled religion. But if the first Synthetic children were raised by human parents, they&#39;d impart their faith on their adopted children. <br />
<br />
Hmmm. Were the first Synthetics created as full blown adults? Or did have to &#39;rear&#39; them the old fashioned way? But 18 years was a long time to have a product ready. But at the same time would radically alter fate if those people had no lives up until that time. <br />
<br />
Considering their origins and faith, Casper wondered about his own kind. Their seat of awareness seemed to be equally spread out through their whole body. But was it in the rubber, or was it in the air inside them? He wondered what origin the reality warping had created for them, he knew they were originally manufactured, the question was how they were &quot;invented.&quot; He still had the theory they were like golems, an elemental spirit inside a rubber shell. But that seemed to . . . well, like it took away the romanticism of it all. <br />
<br />
Casper thought of the romanticism of the birthday girl, she had WISHED for her and her friends to become magic ponies, and in a way they had, and she&#39;d never know her wish had been granted. <br />
<br />
Ashley Simmons twirled her pink scarf. <br />
<br />
After knocking the door finally opened. <br />
<br />
There were a good number of Synthetics already present, Casper had changed his immediate classmates, except for the students in his math class (sans his teacher, who gave him pain even as a Synthetic) and one of his B-Day afternoon classes he had skipped for number 500.<br />
<br />
Speaking of which, there was Becky. The egyptian feline twilight colored goddess herself. She was NOT a sports fan, at all, she was there for friends, nothing more. She also sported the small bulge in her stomach that hinted at her pregnancy. She was talking with a pitch black rubber jackel with golden Hieroglyphic marks all over his body like an Egyptian tomb. Her boyfriend Casper realized. And from the rings on their fingers he saw now (non-magical) he could guess they were more now. <br />
<br />
He spotted the Blonskis on the couch. The rainbow colors zebra woman and purple ad gold cheetah man just chatting. Casper wondered who they had baby sitting their children. <br />
<br />
Janet and Casey where there, Janet&#39;s beachball sized breasts making her easy to spot. Casper wondered what desire Janet had had to make her have those when he changed her.<br />
<br />
The rest of the team and squad were there. Including the team&#39;s water boy and (still human) second stringers. Casper with a thought used the ring, and the water boy was now a &#39;water calf&#39; with bright bronze skin swinging his tail back and forth, naked except for his jersey. <br />
<br />
Casper wondered if he might able to lure the opposing team and squad over as a &#39;peace offering&#39; and a change to transform them like he had missed at the game. <br />
<br />
However standing in the front door was Tommy and Lana. Tommy easily was taller than Casper now with his bull/minotaur stature. Lana still had her cheer uniform on (though she looked like she&#39;d been half way through ditching the top), while Tommy had ditched his upper body padding and was now just in the lower half of his football uniform. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Ashley, hey Casper, great seeing you at the game,&quot; Lana said flatly. <br />
<br />
Casper lowered his head. &quot;I&#39;m sorry. I completely forgot.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You forgot the first game of the season?&quot; Tommy asked annoyed at his friend. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! Don&#39;t blame him.&quot; Ashley said taking the cheat for him. &quot;I forgot too! Casper and I went out to celebrate our six months together and forgot about the game too.&quot; She lied graciously. <br />
<br />
&quot;Casper, you and Ashley promised.&quot; Tommy said holding his hoofed hand on his girlfriend&#39;s foxy hip.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, and I&#39;m sorry.&quot; Casper said, &quot;Can we come inside please? And try to make up for it?&quot;</p>
