<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer tried to think more options as she wanted to graduate one day but couldn’t do it alone. To her being alone was the worst and she was already missing her past human life. Thinking that maybe things would look normal or maybe that was the issue. She was too obsessed being normal. What did normal mean to her anymore. She was an anthropomorphic raccoon girl for crying out loud. It wasn’t normal in her previous life. Before Jennifer could experience her mental breakdown she spotted someone else sleeping on top of her bed as the slender owl girl sat up on top of the bed’s mattress.<br />
<br />
“Morning Jennie. Up already?” The owl girl who looked like Katherine asked. <br />
<br />
“Yeah. I’ve been awake for a while but how did you get on to my bed?” Jennifer asked from her as she ruffled her feathers.<br />
<br />
“Uhh you asked me to stay here with you after the we had our… I don’t know how many we have had... But it was our thirtieth dinner date I guess?&quot; Katherine replied back to Jennifer.<br />
<br />
“Dinner date? You mean like dating kind of a dinner date?” Jennifer asked as she had to process what she was hearing from the owl’s tongue.<br />
<br />
“Yeah. That kind of a date.” Katherine turned her head to the side as she was confused why Jennifer was acting so strangely.<br />
<br />
“Since when we&#39;ve started to date each other?” Jennifer asked from her as she had no idea what was going on.<br />
<br />
“Since last year? You said you didn’t want to come to the celebrations. So I got worried. I thought you made your final decision to stay home because of me. I couldn’t have ever forgiven myself for that. I didn’t know what you felt that day but as your best friend I thought about you and your needs. I was so emotional that day and we talked about a lot things.&quot; Katherine explained.<br />
<br />
Jennifer was confused and curious. How was this possible. How did she end up together with her best friend. Jennifer had to ask her what happened on that day when they met.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s mainly because of your mother. I’m thankful for her what she did back then. She called my mom and my mom asked me to come here to talk with you. And then well… Then we did the thing… On that night you know… I remember how much you told me that you loved me and... Well... I think your mom made a right decision to call my mom. It really cemented our relationship as a couple don’t you think?” Katherine smiled as she took more suggestive pose on top of the bed as Jennifer had no idea what to say back. “Aww, come on. Why do you look so stiff? Come give your spoony girlfriend a kiss and let’s cuddle for a while before we need to go to the school.”<br />
<br />
Jennifer had no idea that her lack of decisions had affected the world so much. It felt weird that she was now dating someone she just met yesterday. Maybe the curse took the implications as part of the equation for the changes. She couldn’t have guessed that Katherine had feeling for her and that Jennifer had accepted Katherine as her girlfriend. Maybe it was because Jennifer felt lonely all the time. She was deep down an anxious mess that didn’t know what she wanted. So maybe her subconscious feelings had made the decision for her.<br />
<br />
Jennifer looked at the owl girl again and couldn’t ever imagine dating a girl. Jennifer didn’t see wrong with it and was embracing this new sexual awakening inside her but for her it was a first time thing. She didn’t know she had gay feelings inside her waiting to be awakened for someone with same sex. Maybe it was a good sign that she was dating Katherine and having someone to talk with made her anxiety melt away. Jennifer noticed that Katherine had nothing on her. She was naked and had been sleeping like that on the bed next to Jennifer. Her beige and white petite body and her chrome colored arms… When did she get those?<br />
<br />
“What’s up with you arms? They aren’t as feathery as last time.” Jennifer asked.<br />
<br />
“Oh! These?” Katherine said and in an instance her arm became a wing and then turned back to an arm in same instant. “I think I forgot to tell you that last week my dad gave them to me. They are prosthetic arms that mimics mammals arms with thumbs. These are just prototypes and don’t ask me how they work. I don’t know the secret sauce behind them. They just work.”<br />
<br />
Katherine looked at Jennifer with loving eyes and asked again if Jennifer wanted to join with her to cuddle on the bed under the blankets. Jennifer didn’t know what to think of it but it was pretty telling that saying no here meant more trouble than it was worth so she sat on the edge of the bed and faced her back towards the owl.<br />
<br />
Suddenly the owl grabbed Jennifer’s two breasts behind her and bounced them up and down from the underneath.<br />
<br />
“It’s so weird to do this.” Katherine whispered in Jennifer’s ear and gave a small nibble on it. “I can feel how much they weight as if I touched them for real with my talons. Now I can be more gentle with you. I know how much you hate my claws and how sensitive you are right here.”<br />
<br />
Katherine used her both metallic thumbs and pointer fingers to grab Jennifer’s nipples and gently twisted them in opposite directions like car’s radio. Jennifer moaned and started to pant as it was making her excited. Katherine then pushed out her owl tongue and licked back of Jennifer’s neck as if Jennifer was Katherine’s prey. Jennifer realized that the owl girl was the dominant one in their relationship as she was playing with Jennifer.<br />
<br />
Katherine kept playing with Jennifer’s nipples as she kept kissing Jennifer’s neck and ears in swift motions. Katherine started to caress Jennifer’s thigh as Jennifer sprayed her right leg for her. Jennifer also noticed how much control she had with her tail now. The raccoon tail hugged Katherine’s abdomen as Katherine arched over Jennifer’s neck and gave it a hickey under the fur with her beak.<br />
<br />
It sent loving shivers down Jennifer&#39;s spine that surprising she liked. She felt that this was their usual way to cuddle together as Katherine used her beak to give tiny loving nibble on Jennifer’s ear and neck. Not even shoulders weren’t spared from the nibbling.<br />
<br />
“I love it how different you are compared to others. All they think is sex, sex, sex while I want to have these kind of moments with you for months.” Katherine blew air Jennifer’s ear. “They forget how important foreplay is and just want to put their cocks inside their loved ones. I’m glad you let me do this to you.”<br />
<br />
Katherine pulled Jennifer to lie back on the bed as Katherine kept kissing Jennifer’s cheek. Jennifer hadn’t ever felt anything like this before and kept lying on her back while Katherine moved on top of Jennifer’s stomach and lied on top of her as they made eye contact with each other. The slender looking barn owl gave a kiss on Jennifer’s lips as Jennifer felt comfortable around her. She was treating her right and teased her just right. Jennifer shared a sentiment that this was what she was looking for as Katherine lowered her head on top of Jennifer’s voluptuous breasts. Katherine pushed her tongue out and then gently placed it on top of Jennifer’s hardened nipple to circle her owl tongue around her sensitive salami. Jennifer was getting wet from all this as the owl was doing it’s best to show how much she loved Jennifer. It was pure and genuine love that Jennifer didn’t ask for but what she deep down wanted. Jennifer wanted someone to care about her, take care of her and wished for someone who was like Katherine. It didn’t matter what gender she was. Jennifer only cared who she was.<br />
<br />
There was a small pause as the raccoon girl and the owl girl exchanged smiles. Jennifer saw that this was just the beginning and waited what the owl girl was going to do next.</p>
