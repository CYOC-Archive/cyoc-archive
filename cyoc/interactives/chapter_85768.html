<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">(Sex not actually written of in detail. The act is simply mentioned here.) <br />
<br />
Somewhere, Nikki&#39;s heart cried out in total despair. She was not consciously aware of it. But her soul surprisingly was, the fresh chance she had been given, had been robbed from her. A gift given, and then stole back. Her heart cries out in despair. She was crying in her sleep. Somewhere in her soul wondering what cruel god would given her another chance, only to take it away. As she slept in her jail cell. <br />
<br />
+++<br />
<br />
If the pen could think it might be thinking. &#39;The one the pen chose was supposed to only be answerable to the gods themselves for what they changed with the pen.&#39; <br />
<br />
While the pen was not precisely sapient, if it could be said to have one desire of its own, it was to be used. This was why it had nudged fate to escape the immortal undead elite who had no ability nor interest in its use, and had then left Prometheus&#39; after their long time together. <br />
<br />
Ironically it had outright escaped its master who had used it to wipe a tribe of fae even if it meant falling into the hands of the immortal elite again, even though its master had intended to use it much more: even the pen had some principles. <br />
<br />
Some suggested the pen ad been made with the impression of the soul of an extremely submissive slave, but most dismissed this as fiction invented to fill in the gaps of the pen&#39;s origin. Or that its form had once been that of a quill. <br />
<br />
The pen didn&#39;t &#39;desire&#39; for Danielle to use it every moment of every day. But if the pen could be said to have a fear, it would be a fear of again not being used. <br />
<br />
As a matter of course, the pen didn&#39;t twist the words of its holder, and it could not &#39;make&#39; its holder write or &#39;want&#39; anything that the owner didn&#39;t already choose to write down. <br />
<br />
But the pen was nothing if not determined, and fate always found a way. <br />
<br />
And it knew, from all its past &#39;experience&#39; that there was nothing more destructive than trying to &#39;undo&#39; changes thinking it would put things back ideally the way it was. It was not a pencil, it was not good at erasing mistakes. <br />
<br />
Since Ashlee hadn&#39;t written in all the clauses about changes to reality that Danielle had, Dave was still technically male to the rest of the universe, and the change had ultimately just been physical. <br />
<br />
Ashlee had also not been given a &#39;play by play&#39; of every single action Dave had done during the day, only what he told her, and what Dave had written she would be aware of.<br />
<br />
She had no immunity to the changes the pen made as none had been standing orders, (like Dave&#39;s that any change would count as normal to the rest of creation) and Danielle had been too shocked by Ashlee&#39;s object lesson to even remotely think of it. <br />
<br />
As it turned out that evening, Ashlee swung both ways. And she found the experience intense, but the reality was that while she remembered everything that had happened for those moment Dave had told her to see, in reality she still remembered Dave as a lizard man and his co-workers as they had always been to her. He had simply given her samples of memories of a previous universe, and been made aware. In truth, it had all been the principle of the thing. <br />
<br />
As for demanding Nikki second childhood being stolen from her, perhaps that had been simply principle as well. <br />
<br />
Ashlee was not without her fetishes however, or rather, her curiosity. <br />
<br />
She had been upset with Dave mostly for the idea that he had been &#39;lording&#39; over others with these changes. But just animals? There were an infinite number of things the pen could change people into, so many more shapes and forms that the human mind could express itself through. Restraining it to just animals was . . . narrow minded. <br />
<br />
On a completely whim she had told Danielle as they lay on top of each other on the bed, <br />
<br />
&quot;Dear, change me into a lizard sex doll.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I still want to be able to move and speak, but I want to see what it&#39;s like, you know, curious . . .&quot;<br />
<br />
Danielle&#39;s mind was hazy ironically from NOT having her past changed with her transformation, forcing her to adapt the old fashioned way, and this created distractions, in particular with what they had been doing. <br />
<br />
So Danielle, reaching or where the pen and paper were on the table, late at night and not thinking as she could have and wouldn&#39;t likely remember what she had even precisely written the next morning, wrote, her hand twitching ever so slightly as she wrote the words, thinking of &#39;her wife&#39; as she wrote it. <br />
<br />
&#39;Ashlee is my lizard rubber sex doll, she can move, she can speak, and can&#39;t be damaged.&#39;<br />
<br />
She practically slid the pen off the little posted note she had used, the little note was dragged by the pen as she lazily slid her arm down, the note fell into the trash (that would be emptied in the morning with none the wiser), lost among a bound of other piece of paper and non-magically written work notes. <br />
<br />
Danielle was so used to the idea of the changes in reality not effecting her perception that in her sleep addled state she didn&#39;t remember that this didn&#39;t truly apply to her wife. <br />
<br />
Ashlee felt her body become lighter, softer, didn&#39;t hear her heart beat, or herself breathing, the weight of Danielle on top beg to feel like it was slightly squishing her. <br />
<br />
All of Ashlee&#39;s clothes except for her purse vanished. A childhood photo in her purse changed to that of a adorable little rubber lizard girl. <br />
<br />
Ashlee felt her toes and fingers merge into claws much like Danielle&#39;s, but more simplistic. She felt her breasts grow larger, along with her hips, her hair became a rubber inflated imitation of a brightly colored crest. Her eyes remained seeing but were now plastic against rubber. Her consciousness now existed equally throughout her body since she no longer had a brain. <br />
<br />
her eyes became little painted holes on the side of her head but still hearing. Her skin lost all hair and became rubbery and shinny, becoming a rather bright green with a bright yellow down her chest, her face pushed out into a snout, and a long hollow rubber tail grew from her rear that trapped itself around Danielle&#39;s, their breasts pressed against each others an the sound of scale rubbing against rubber was heard. <br />
<br />
And without even remotely noticing it, Ashlee&#39;s entire life changed. <br />
<br />
She was a good doll. She was happy with her master, er, Danielle, she was happy with her owner, er, her wife. She was hers after all. She&#39;d support Danielle in everything she did as a good doll was supposed to. She felt bad for slapping Danielle before, that wasn&#39;t what a good doll did, a good doll supported Danielle, helped her through everything. She could already think of so many things Danielle could do that would be so fun with the pen. She was a good doll, and she pleased Danielle to the best of her ability, after all, she was a doll, she was incomplete without someone to please. <br />
<br />
She was sad to be separated from Danielle during the day, but having a job made her happy, and Ashlee having a job made Danielle happy. There was so much to do with the pen, so many things to change, but for now, she&#39;d make Danielle happy here. <br />
<br />
By the time the night was over, Danielle had decidedly gotten used to the idea of being female, even embracing it. She wouldn&#39;t bring it up unless Ashlee felt the need to first. Which given Ashlee&#39;s new perceptions, wasn&#39;t likely to be for a long long time. <br />
<br />
&quot;I think you&#39;re hot as a rubber lizard.&quot; She whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m happy to be one for you.&quot; Ashlee whispered back as both feel asleep.</p>
