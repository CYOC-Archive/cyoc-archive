<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Is there anything else in specific you&#39;d like your dream girl to have?&quot; asked Matt.<br />
<br />
Ashton thought about it for a second and answered &quot;Nope, not really.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then go wait outside, I want it to be a surprise. If you don&#39;t like something we can always change it back later.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ashton didn&#39;t really know how to feel about this, when Matt said he was into him he wasn&#39;t expecting for this to happen. But still, it was worth a shot. He would finally have his dream girl and, like Matt said, they could always turn things back to normal.<br />
<br />
Hoping for the best, he said &quot;Surprise me.&quot; as he gave an awkward smile and headed for the door.<br />
<br />
Matt rushed to his laptop and looked at all the options he had at his disposal. First of all he wanted to get the basics done and changed his sex to female and his sexual orientation to heterosexual. Then he went on to the physical attributes, there was a huge list of options but luckily all the main ones were neatly placed on top. He altered everything to Ashton&#39;s needs and made a few tweaks of his own here and there. <br />
<br />
Now he had only the mental changes left, he knew he didn&#39;t want to change too much because he still wanted to stay himself. So he cautiously began to adjust a select few personality traits to match up with Ashton&#39;s preferences. When he came across his IQ he was amazed to see it was already at 122. He still raised it a little higher, just to be sure it would satisfy Ashton.<br />
<br />
Name: Elissa Cornell<br />
Sex: female<br />
Sexual orientation: heterosexual<br />
Ethnic group: African American<br />
Weight: 124 pounds<br />
Length: 5&#39; 6&quot;<br />
Breast size: B cup<br />
Eyesight: 20/80<br />
IQ: 136<br />
<br />
Adjusted personality traits:<br />
- Studious: 55% -> 95 %<br />
- Procrastinator: 65% -> 5 %<br />
- Bookworm: 10% -> 75%<br />
<br />
He looked over it for the last time and then pressed the next button. A small screen popped up with a handful of options relating to the change. He set awareness so that only him and Ashton knew about what had happened. He also made it so reality would automatically adjust itself to the transformation. He confirmed all of the changes and a progress bar appeared on the screen.<br />
<br />
At first he didn&#39;t notice anything out off the ordinary, until a tingling sensation began emanating from all over his body. Hoping to see what caused it, he tilted his head down to his lower half. He couldn&#39;t believe what he saw, his skin was getting darker by the second. Soon after, the light tickle had intensified as the change quickened its pace and began making its way to his head. This left him in a state of extreme sensual pleasure, not being able to keep himself standing for any longer he immediately fell down on his bed.<br />
<br />
As the paralyzing feeling came to an end, he opened his eyes. Bringing a hand in front of his face and turning it around, his gaze followed the gradient of his skin from a chocolaty brown to a lighter mocha at the palm of his hand. Mesmerized at the change he wanted to examine the rest of his body. But before he could even glance at himself in the mirror, he began to feel really warm. It felt almost like a really bad cold until it sharpened and began burning at his skin. He looked down at himself, and to his surprise he was getting thinner. Most of his excess body fat was melting away only leaving some at the hip area. After the burning had passed he could finally examine himself in the mirror.<br />
<br />
A lithe figure was staring back at him, slender but with some nice curves in the right places. His last masculine traits disappeared and for the most part he looked like a girl. His hair had grown to neck length, his eyelashes were stunning and his face had softened to a nice round shape. He looked the part but he knew the most important changes still had to come.<br />
<br />
Two mounds of flesh swelled from his torso, filling out to a manageable pair of breasts. The sudden shift in weight had brought him off balance, so with both hands he grasped to support his new cleavage. He grabbed his breasts with a firm grip which sparked a tingle in his brain. An effeminate moan escaped his lips as he massaged over his dark sensitive nipples. Working it a little more made his dick come to full attention, or at least what was left of it. It had already shrunk an inch and it was only shriveling further. At the same time, his insides were churning in a dizzying manner as a slit opened. Loose skin folded into his lips and his now soft nub burned for attention.<br />
<br />
Wandering one hand over to her vagina and rubbing over her clitoris made her shiver and groan in a new-found intense pleasure. The daze soon subsided and although she was back to her senses, she was ready for more. At least from a certain someone.<br />
<br />
The room was now covered in a light pink combined with a lot of pastels. It was decorated with a lot of geeky stuff, like a TMNT poster and signed Dune books. A dedicated study area was filled with pens and notebooks and all subjects were neatly organized to create a productive workspace. She hadn&#39;t noticed it until now but she was wearing a frilly school uniform matched with nerdy thick-rimmed glasses. Ashton was still waiting outside so she ran to the door and shouted in her new higher-pitched voice :”You can come in!”</p>
