<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Frank nor Daryl said anything as Kaylee held Daryl as a human shield, Frank had his <br />
weapon drawn but couldn't risk his partner. And with those claws and muscles Kaylee <br />
looked quite capable of breaking Daryl's neck with a twist.  <br />
<br />
Neither Frank nor Daryl were natives of the twon of Glendale, and thus had no actual <br />
knowledge of the game Transform or Dare.  Frank and Daryl had stupidly assumed Kaylee <br />
was wearing a costume, this idea was quickly melting away as they looked as her muscles <br />
move and her skin fold and her eyes blink and the smell she gave off. <br />
<br />
To be fair, Frank and Daryl when they had signed up for the police -were- supposed to <br />
attention a police briefing on some of the local legends including a particularly dangerous <br />
game started between some long forgotten spirit and a couple mortals. Both brushed it off <br />
as a waste of time and wondered why the police department would waste money on it, but <br />
had never bothered to actually ask. <br />
<br />
This went on for fifty nine more seconds seconds until at last Kaylee said, &quot;Time! Now you <br />
two get both!&quot; <br />
<br />
Kaylee thought, how small minded Kyle had been, in fact, how small minded everyone <br />
who had been struck by the curse had likely been. Kaylee remembered the girl who had <br />
asked him out. Of course Kyle had accepted a date from a hot chick.  Then he found out <br />
that she considered cat to be better than dogs, rabbits, and in particular human beings <br />
and loved to say how great the musical 'Cats' was. And she had no taste in movies either.  <br />
Eventually Kyle broke off with her. <br />
<br />
He saw her walk into a pet store by chance once, and she picked up a cat and she seemed <br />
to talk to it! Of course it couldn't talk back until she took it's muzzle off. The cat suddenly <br />
looked angry and Kyle heard the animal say --words-- 'transform or dare' that was <br />
enough for Kyle and he walked away very quickly away from the pet store.<br />
<br />
The next time he saw Kathy, he had cats ears and a tail he assumed were fake, as did <br />
everyone else, and she got in trouble for refusing to take them off. Kyle caught her as she <br />
left the principle's office crying to gloat. That was when she snarled at him, &quot;TRANSFORM <br />
OR DARE?&quot; And he had in a panic chosen 'dare.'<br />
<br />
He was suspended two weeks from school for walking around school with his lower body <br />
exposed doing the highland flying singing song from Westside story. During those two <br />
weeks, Kathy's family moved away no leaving a forwarding address. <br />
<br />
Finally being allowed back on school grounds the incident with Jennifer happened, and <br />
Kyle chose to use the power of the curse, setting in motion things that had occurred. <br />
<br />
Where before the two police officers had been at an impasse, now they seemed genuinely <br />
paralyzed somehow. Perhaps it was the double-double wammy of the curse? Kaylee didn't <br />
remember any of the myths saying it being able to work on two people at once, but it <br />
clearly was. <br />
<br />
Kaylee spoke, &quot;First for your dare, you'll call from your squad car that the entire incident <br />
was just a couple harmless newly bought dogs getting a bit too excited. Nothing to think <br />
about. Then you'll return to the police station or whatever, turn in your badges so to <br />
speak, making up a decent excuse for quitting, and come right back here. Then you'll also <br />
call any family you have and tell them that you need to off and find yourself and may never <br />
see then ever again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No~!&quot; Groaned Frank who had a wife and two children. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Yes!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yes.&quot; Stuttered Frank. <br />
<br />
&quot;You will do all of this as efficiently and non-suspcion-rousing as possible.   After all that <br />
is done, you will come back here, and not having revealed anything about me or my <br />
master, you two will become identical twin humanoid she wolves. You will act the same, <br />
look the same, think the same, feel the same, be the same. You will love, serve, and obey <br />
my master. You are totally submissive to all his needs and wants. When he's not available <br />
you will listen to me as his Alpha Female. Your loyalty and adoration of my master, your <br />
lord and master is unbreakable and unquestionable. You will use the Transform or Dare <br />
only to further the master' pack but will be unable to use it until you return here and only <br />
after your transformation is complete.&quot; <br />
<br />
The two police men instantly turned around and went back to their squad car as Kaylee let <br />
go of Daryl.  The two police men did precise as they had been told reporting the incident <br />
was just some pets after all and was nothing and drove directly back to the police station. <br />
<br />
Kaylee went back inside, sniffing and looking around making sure none of the neighbors <br />
had seen her and went back inside to inform The Big Bad Wolf of these developments. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good afternoon master Jensen.&quot; Said Kaylee perkily into the Big Bad Wolf's ear. <br />
<br />
&quot;Jensen?&quot; The Big Bad Wolf opened his eyes slowly at his smiling mate. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well you renamed me master, I feel it's only fitting that I rename you... unless... of course, <br />
master doesn't LIKE the name Jensen?&quot;<br />
<br />
The Big Bad Wolf thought about it for a moment, then shrugged. &quot;Sounds like a good a <br />
name as any.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have new master. Two police came after hearing our love making, but I was able to use <br />
the game to make them report it was nothing, and they'll return as two new she wolves for <br />
your pack.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen groaned, &quot;Kaylee! Why didn't you wake me?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because you ordered me to let you sleep master.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen groaned again, Kaylee could still be as dense as Kyle. &quot;I wanted you to save the <br />
game for when your parents got home! Then we'd go back to my family's mansion and use <br />
the game on -my- parents and then tomorrow we'd use the curse on our family maid <br />
Martha.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do not worry master! I told them to come back as quickly as they could after they quite <br />
their job and told their family that they were going on a long long trip likely forever.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen sighed, &quot;You had better hope Kaylee that they get back before your parents do.&quot;</p>
