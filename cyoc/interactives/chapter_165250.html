<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It had been two weeks since he had started his transformation. And though he still fought against thinking of himself as a woman, even as his body and the world around him became more and more sure that was what he was, Roni continued to think of himself using male pronouns. About a week or so ago he had stopped thinking of himself by his male name, which seemed a relief, as accepting the name Roni seemed to ease a mental load he felt like he was carrying.<br />
<br />
Yet, he still was experiencing a few problems that left him wondering if, maybe, he should use the Amulet of Zulo to change back.<br />
<br />
The top of his list was Abby. He could recall, almost like it was from a dream, having known a girl by this name. But, beyond that they had used the amulet together, he could remember almost nothing about her. He was certain she had been his flatmate at some point, even though it looked like he had never had anyone to share with the apartment with and had taken it because the asking price for the two-bedroom apartment was cheaper than a single-bedroom apartment. Left wondering for some time whether he had or hadn&#39;t known an Abby, he found he wanted to believe he had known such a person and that they had shared an apartment. But, as the days went by, he found himself doubting more and more that he had even known such a girl. And when he had gone to where he was sure she lived, it was to find nobody home each time.<br />
<br />
Scared that somehow the use of the necklace had altered reality so much that either Abby no longer lived where he thought she did, or had erased her, Roni found himself thinking more and more of using the Amulet of Zulo to change himself back.<br />
<br />
And it wasn&#39;t only the issue with a girl he may or may not have known that was driving him toward such a decision.<br />
<br />
For lack of a better description, his other problem resided in the what was happening to him. Before the transformation, he had had a plan for revenge, but had never wanted to be the opposite sex and gender. Now, he smelled like a women, was starting to sound like one when he talked, his thoughts and actions were becoming more and more feminine, especially if he didn&#39;t fight against the dream-like states that sometimes over came him. He had started to shrink and was now about five foot nine, whilst his weight was down from around two ten to around one hundred sixty three pounds. And the way he felt a lot of the time was less masculine and more feminine. Plus, there was the urges and desires he was feeling that left him questioning what he had, as well as feeling like he enjoyed being a woman more than he had like being a dude.<br />
<br />
Troubled by this, he had tried to force himself to realise this wasn&#39;t right, that he was a guy, and that when he had gotten his revenge, he would go back to being a man. But this had only led him to question his decision and thoughts about revenge, and then to start see them as not as important.<br />
<br />
A sigh escaped him as he lay in his bed and as he thought about the last two weeks, he rolled over on his side, which caused the top sheet to hug his body even tighter. Feeling the soft cotton sheet against his naked skin, Roni found he liked it as he adjusted himself so that his hands were now under his pillow. Blinking in the morning sun shining through the curtains, he thought about his hands and feet, which had started to shrink as well, and then thought about the one thing he still had that said he was clearly a guy, even though he was certain only he could see it.<br />
<br />
A huff of agitation escaped him and as he sat up, Roni held the sheet so that it covered his front. Stepping out of bed, he stepped daintily across the room and stopped in front of the full-body mirror. A woman&#39;s face peered back at him and for a moment, he stared at it, trying to see even the faintest hint of masculinity in it. Seeing only a round, feminine face, he released his hold on the sheet and as a slight shiver escaped him, he peered down at his body.<br />
<br />
Very little remained to tell that at one point he had been a dude. Sure, his hands and feet were somewhere between a man&#39;s and a woman&#39;s. And he still had a limp dick that never got hard whenever he was horny. And his shoulders and Apple apple had also began to shift and, in the case of his Adam&#39;s apple, disappear. But, beyond the these last vestiges, when he looked in the mirror, he saw a woman. His hips, thighs, and butt were more pronounced, like a woman&#39;s. And had been for a bit now. He had C cup size breasts, something he was finally accepting. Yet, the one thing that seemed to remain, though it was shrinking very, very, very slowly, was his dick. Adjusting his stance so that he was more spread eagle, he lifted a leg and stared at the tiny, white thing.<br />
<br />
Now between his legs, it dangled down in about the spot he guessed a woman&#39;s clit and pee hole would be. His nut sack, he noted, had stretched out between his legs and wrapped around his cock, which he figured was what forced it between his legs. Staring at what used to be his ball sack, Roni noted it looked more like a vagina, though he knew that if he spread the lips, he wouldn&#39;t see the opening for where a man could stick his dick. Shuddered at the thought that he actually wanted that to happen to him, he clamped his legs tightly together and whispered, &quot;No. I shan&#39;t go that far,&quot; as he thought about the urges he&#39;d been having.<br />
<br />
They had started as a couple erotic dreams here and there. Dreams that had found him having sex with a guy and often waking to feeling aroused, with his nipples erect, a moist feeling between his legs, a sensitivity to touch, and often flushed with a warmth that spread throughout his groin, down his legs, and up into his chest. Thinking about Ted, Roni turned away from the mirror and after he collected the sheet, headed toward the bed. Dropping the top sheet on the bed, he then headed for his dresser. Taking from the jewellery box the Amulet of Zulo he turned and went and sat on the bed. Staring at the necklace, and not for the first time, he thought about changing himself back. Wondering if it would be unfair to Ted, as the two of them had been going steady now and it looked like there actually might be something there, Roni sighed.<br />
<br />
Conflicted, he continued to look at the amulet. Thinking, going back and forth, he thought about he hadn&#39;t wanted to be a woman, how he had only had a plan to get revenge on those who had wronged him. But now, now that he was almost a woman, he found that he liked being Roni and that his plan didn&#39;t seem so important. Troubled by the number of problems facing him, he stood and returned the Amulet of Zulo to the jewellery box. Asking, &quot;What would Abby do if she were here?&quot; he headed for the closet. Fetching his robe, glad that he didn&#39;t have to work, he exited the room and headed for the kitchen. And as he sat and ate breakfast, he first considered what the other girl might say and do, but then found himself thinking about Kira and Dakotah, the success of their camping trip a couple weeks ago, and how they were planning another in a couple weeks. Problems temporarily forgotten, Roni finished eating, and decided that, after a shower, he was going to give Dakotah and Kira a call, or, if they weren&#39;t available, Ted.</p>
