<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Who&#39;s The hell is This Now?-by jacob A year ago A TG O Anthro Bovine<br />
<br />
As he was flipping through the pads of paper on his desk that Joe and Anna were wondering what he was looking for, when he spoke about some potential solutions. thinking it was about time as to head out while figuring on how to help Joe with his, her situation by taking her home that something caught Joe&#39;s attention for it was on the desk next to him. getting a better look as to what it was that Joe picked it up, without them noticing on what you were looking at for it had a gold like bell strapped to a brown leather belt of some sort. Joe had seen these on many occasion while on the farm for it was some kind of collar for a cow as it also had its own bell with it.<br />
<br />
This seemed odd for a cow belled collar for a man to have in his office, especially since that there was a sexy hot looking anthro cow. Even though it was meant to be for a farmer to a farm that it definitely didn&#39;t look like one at first glance, yet he was interested to try it on and see if it would fit on him for thoughts of being on a farm as he sees himself in a barn with other creatures from cows, horses, even sheep, to cats, mice, and birds to live in from the storms and winter seasons. He even had thoughts of being on a large enough acres of land for private things to do from public eyes, things people who don&#39;t want knowing to see as a beautiful anthro cowgirl was to name an example that It sounded like a good enough deal at the time. it was not like there was nothing more Joe could do in her condition anyways as it was almost a perfect time of a solution for something to wear, for now.<br />
<br />
to this, Joe slipped the collared cow bell on himself as it was a perfect fit that it soon took Joe on the thought of looking within the mirror nearby. with all of this that had occurred while wearing the cowbell on now, Joe actually started to like being a girl as much to being a humanoid cow for something told him that this was going to get some getting used to. loving the feeling on wanting to be dominated by a hansom being as he was mentally unaware of what he was thinking, let alone of what he was doing on what was happening to him that Joe seems to be happy enough to stay in this form for a little while longer. So much in fact that to this end as he could learn to live with this, Joe hoped in which Anna would learn to... wait a minute. why was he thinking of having Anna to love such the idea of living with a human cowgirl? was it because of this cowbell?<br />
<br />
with so mush going on as everything was on the line that Anna was hopping he had found something of a solution by flipping through pads of paper on his desk. wondering what he was looking for, until he spook. “you know, I might have some potential solutions. If I can only find them...”<br />
<br />
it was then that he noticed something was missing on his desk top as he was now searching for it. “wait a minute... where did it go now?...”<br />
<br />
jumping off from his desk area that when he turn to look away as he shortly sees Joe wearing the cowbell from the desk top, he froze. Anna was starting to wonder what&#39;s the matter while asking on why has he stopped looking for away to get Joe out of the cow suit, but the moment she saw Joe wearing a cowbell around his neck that she started to fear for Joe now then ever. not only did Joe take something off his desk without asking what it dose with the costume Joe has on as he might of stolen it by now, but the shop store owner seemed pretty upset by this that he shortly said to what came next was going to give the two nightmares to this day forth.<br />
<br />
“Oh! that&#39;s just great. not only do I have to deal with a way to undo the process of getting your boyfriend out of there and back to his original body, now I have to deal with his mental state to. that collar there was for my daughter for she wanted to have the mental state of being a cow, when she gets her own cow suit herself. now I have to carefully take that collar off of him as the side effect last for at least three years, before his own mental state can return back to his senses.” the shop owner said as Anna was shocked to hear this while finding out on how long the effects of his brain will be affected by this.<br />
<br />
“THREE YEARS!” the two said with shock as the shop owner gently went up to Joe, to carefully remove the collar off of his neck. once it was off that Joe suddenly felt naked without it, even though she was. wait... SHE?!<br />
<br />
rushing up over to Joe that she shortly asked a few questions. “Joe?... you still in there? are you with me still? are you ok?”<br />
<br />
feeling like she was being asked one to many questions at once as Joe started to slowly gather her own thoughts on how to handle this, she answered Anna&#39;s questions the best way she could. “yeah, I&#39;m ok. i&#39;m still here, for a human cowgirl. however..., it&#39;s Joann now. and yes, it&#39;s still me in here, with this body.”<br />
<br />
Anna became very concerned when she heard this from Joe, now being called out to all by her new name Joann. &quot;Ah, man. sir. I really hate to just leave here with my friend and all, but we got to get to work on that item to get Joe back from this transformation faster than I thought.&quot; Anna said as she took her friend by the are and left the shop, unaware that they left with two items on hand. one was a bull suit in which someone secretly bought for them to wear for the other was the magic milker machine as they were all within a grocery bag, along with two cowbell collars for them to wear. however, these collars don&#39;t do much as they&#39;re just like wearing a normal pet collar to both pets and role playing humans who want to be treated like pets.<br />
<br />
leaving the shop as they seem to be within the mall, they forgotten one thing. leaving the shop meant that they had to deal with the crowd of people who were now with there phones out again as there were more of them then before. insisting of getting out from in the mall as Anna felt sick on the thought for it was one thing to help Joe being milked so early in the morning while having to do it again in the evening every single day, but for the next three years was to much for her that she almost started baling out in tears. having visions of having Joe cooking in the house while mooing as Joe was being milked that she once done, she would have her start her day off out with another man.<br />
<br />
to this thought out of her head as it feared her scared, Anna quickly turned around to look into Joe&#39;s eyes. trying to see if there was any comprehension left from this Joann girl that to her luck, there was still a linger of Joe left somewhere with her. however, it was pretty faint as Anna was now getting scared for Joe. “oh no, this is not looking good. Not one little bit at all.”<br />
<br />
“at this rate, Joe will think that she&#39;s just an actual every day out of the ordinary mill anthro cowgirl. Joe, we&#39;ll get you out of this. I promise you.” She said as they began to rush off and out of there in a hurry, even if she has to battle through the swarm of a crowed people in the mall who wanted to basically have a good time the the cowgirl.</p>
