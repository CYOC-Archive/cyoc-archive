<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake had taken Kenny back to his place - the guy was in no condition to be alone. A few of the guys - Alec, Isaac, George, Peter and Elijah had joined, too, though Jake didn&#39;t know if it was because they felt they needed to care for Kenny, or if they wanted something else. Luckily, his parents weren&#39;t coming home for a few weeks yet, and his younger brother was at a sleepover, so they had the house to themselves. Jake and Peter washed and clothed Kenny, then put him, exhausted as he was, into his bed. Jake took a quick look at Kenny, laying under the sheets in the guest room. Their new classmate didn&#39;t seem too much bigger, after all, but the difference was noticeable. &quot;Well,&quot; Peter said, with his Jim Halpert-like smile, &quot;guess you have to do some explaining to us, then.&quot; <br />
<br />
In the living room, the five guys sat in a circle, Jake looking at each of them as he thought about what he was going to say. <br />
There was Alec, the soccer player, the boyfriend to one of Jake&#39;s closest female friends. Alec was six foot, with lean, tight muscle all over, sitting at 175 lbs. His pale skin made a stark contrast with his dark, tousled hair, and right now he was looking quizzically at Jake, the full lips that Chrissy was crazy about pursed.<br />
Isaac was African-American, one of the few guys in the very white school, and he was a Will wannabe in everything. Constantly working out and running, constantly checking out girls, Isaac nevertheless was a stand up guy. He was six foot, like Alec, though more muscled at 185 lbs, and he often liked to flaunt his large biceps and heavy, round pecs. He had a classically handsome face, with high cheekbones and almond-shaped eyes, but his signature grin was replaced by an intense stare at Jake.<br />
George was blond, like Jake, and six foot four, like Jake, but there the similarities stopped. George had been in a state of constant bulking for the last three years, it seemed, having started just a little more filled out than Jake himself, and now sitting at a mighty 200 lbs, he hadn&#39;t begun his cutting yet. He had a round face, but with still prominent, square jaw, and though he didn&#39;t have visible abs at all, he certainly wasn&#39;t fat - his thick thighs, broad, strong ass, fat pecs and heavy shoulders made him the bulldozer of the group, even with his gentle voice and calm demeanor. <br />
If George and Jake had been opposites, Peter and George still were. Peter was as tall as George and Jake, and lanky, with thin arms, long legs and thick black hair that fell to his narrow shoulders. The Latino, unlike Jake, had a chiseled face with a strong jawline and high cheekbones, though his cheeks were bordering to looking gaunt. Peter was Jake&#39;s oldest friend, and they&#39;d been adopted into Will Barnes&#39; circle at the same time. Fittingly, now, Jake also knew that while Peter&#39;s dick had been just as long as his, if not slightly more so, it was a whole inch slimmer around. Jake then remembered that he&#39;d grown down there, too, surpassing Peter&#39;s length, surely. <br />
Then there was Elijah, who, with his effeminate face and spindly, childish body, was looking at Jake almost ravenously, a little too close to how Kenny&#39;d been for comfort.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Jake began, &quot;I&#39;m going to tell you how I think Kenny...&quot; Well, &quot;blew up.&quot; <br />
&quot;And how you blew up,&quot; Elijah chimed in. <br />
Sigh. &quot;Yeah. Yeah, how I grew a bit too. Okay! Yesterday...&quot; As Jake told the story about how he&#39;d taken a swim in the mysteriously blue pool, then stuffed himself bloated with food, only to gain 20 lbs of muscle in about an hour, the assembly looked stunned. Isaac raised his hand, like in class, and asked: &quot;Do you still have a sample of that... blue jizz?&quot; Jake took it out from his pocket, and passed it around the circle. The fluid inside the plastic canister was a deep blue, slightly translucent, and it seemed just as thick and slimy as regular semen.<br />
&quot;But, uh, did your... y&#39;know, did *it* grow too?&quot; Alec gestured vaguely downward. &quot;Since it looked like Kenny grew down there. Or was that just me?&quot; The other guys murmured in agreement. &quot;Yeah, and so what happened?&quot; Isaac asked. &quot;Do you remember anything from just before Kenny started blowing you?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, kinda.&quot; Jake had to think about what had actually happened - his memory was blurry. &quot;I think my vision turned, not blue, but red-ish? And I remember not being able to control myself, I didn&#39;t want to, you know, shove his head down my... my dick, but... but I did! And I don&#39;t know how!&quot; <br />
&quot;Well,&quot; said a voice from the hall, &quot;I certainly had control over my actions.&quot; Kenny appeared in the clothes lent from Jake&#39;s brother. He looked more solid, more muscular, though not hugely so. He still didn&#39;t look bigger than Alec or Isaac, for example, but his posture looked more... worthy. More masculine. He was still a prettyboy in terms of his face, but his body made him look like more of a movie star. <br />
&quot;You sure you should be walking right now, buddy?&quot; Jake was worried, but Kenny looked fine now. &quot;Yeah, I don&#39;t feel dizzy anymore. I guess you&#39;re talking about your changes?&quot; The boys nodded. &quot;Well, doesn&#39;t your school have really good lab equipment? I&#39;m sure you Chem geeks could do an analysis or something, right?&quot; <br />
&quot;That&#39;s right,&quot; Elijah said. &quot;But we don&#39;t have keys. The school will be locked right now.&quot; That was true - it was nearing 7 PM, everyone would have left campus.<br />
&quot;Not necessarily,&quot; George said. &quot;I know a guy who can get us in. He&#39;s got special permission to use the pool, so the Coach gave him an extra set of keys. I&#39;ve been using the school&#39;s gym on occasion.&quot; <br />
&quot;Well, then, call him, sunshine!&quot;<br />
<br />
As George called whoever it was he knew that had keys, Jake and Peter talked to Kenny, filling him in on the deets. &quot;Now, the question remains,&quot; Kenny mumbled, &quot;how much did I actually grow?&quot; It was a good question.<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Peter said, &quot;it would actually be useful to know that.&quot; <br />
Jake was baffled. &quot;Why?&quot; Peter looked at him like he was stupid.<br />
&quot;Well, because, obviously, all us others want to grow like you two have, too!&quot; Peter sounded angry. &quot;If you have some ability to make guys grow their muscle and junk, then obviously all of us want in!&quot;<br />
<br />
      ____________<br />
<br />
The results were in fifteen minutes later. Kenny walked out of the bathroom wearing only a set of grey boxer-briefs (as did all the others, for that matter; everyone knew those were the best), with a notebook and a pencil. &quot;Okay,&quot; he said, sitting down, showing his killer abs, &quot;You guys ready?&quot; Yes, they were. This was important; apparently they all wanted to grow, and Jake wasn&#39;t about to stop them, as long as he could be biggest. This would show the basic limits of growth. &quot;So: before, I was 158 lbs. Now, I&#39;m 172. Before, and I know this because I obsessed slightly over this for a while, my penis was five and three-quarters of an inch long, and five and a half inches around. Now, it&#39;s six inches long, and five inches and three-quarters around. My balls, they&#39;ve gotten a bit bigger, though not very much. I can still fit both into my palm. Oh, and I got an inch taller.&quot; Putting down his notebook, Kenny was grinning with satisfaction.<br />
&quot;Well, then,&quot; Isaac exclaimed, &quot;let&#39;s get to school!&quot;</p>
