<br />
Rick was sitting on his bed thinking about some things. Particularly he was thinking about Marie and her family. Something felt off to him but he couldn't quite put his finger on it. Suddenly he heard a scream from the bathroom and he quickly ran into it to find Maylene covering her face and looking away from the mirror. Embracing her he asked, &quot;What's wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm a pig,&quot; Maylene said sobbing.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're not a pig,&quot; Rick said in a soothing tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I saw my reflection,&quot; Maylene said through sobs.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've seen myself as a bear in the mirror several times now,&quot; Rick said. &quot;Do I look like a bear to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Maylene looked up and said, &quot;No. You look like yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you don't look like a pig,&quot; Rick said with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then why did I see myself as a pig?&quot; Maylene asked laying her head on Rick's chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kurse twisted our bodies then our souls,&quot; Rick said with a sigh. &quot;That type of... manipulation... is sure to leave scars. I think it's like our urges and may be linked.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know how much longer I can fight the urge to have sex,&quot; Maylene said shuddering. &quot;I was brought up to wait for marriage before having sex and I made a vow not to. Now I've broken that vow by having sex with any male pig on the island.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That wasn't your fault,&quot; Rick said sternly. &quot;What happened was akin to rape but we can't call it that because the men weren't responsible for their actions anymore than you were. It was Kurse that did it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But what if I'm pregnant?&quot; Maylene started sobbing. &quot;What will my child be like? How many will I have? Will they be half pig half human?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know,&quot; Rick admitted. &quot;I just don't know. I wish I did but I don't.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;At least you can't get pregnant,&quot; Maylene said.<br />
<br />
Rick sighed and said, &quot;I was thinking about that. I'm pretty sure that while I was a bear I could get pregnant. If I did what happens with the baby? Does he or she simply cease to exist or does someone else become pregnant with them?&quot;<br />
<br />
As if in answer to Rick's question he started to change. His hair grew longer. His body slimmed down while his hips and butt expanded. His face rearranged into a more feminine face while breasts started growing on his chest. He shrank a little bit so he was the same height as Maylene now. His final transformation to his body was his balls pulling up into his body and the formation of a pussy. He was now a hermaphrodite. Finally his clothes changed. His shirt and pants fused together and became a pale yellow. His pant legs puffed out and merged so he was now wearing a dress. His briefs changed into pink panties and a bra formed supporting his new breasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened?&quot; Maylene asked stunned.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know,&quot; Rick said noticing his higher pitched voice. Reaching down under his dress he noticed that he still had a dick though it was tucked back between his legs. When he touched it he could feel it rub against his slit which made him shudder in pleasure. &quot;I think I'm a hermaphrodite now,&quot; he said with a look of surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;But how can you be?&quot; Maylene asked looking concerned.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think... I think I might have... might have... conceived,&quot; Rick said trying to wrap his head around what he had become.<br />
<br />
&quot;But you're a guy,&quot; Maylene said shocked. &quot;You don't have the equipment to be able to conceive a baby.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do now and I did when I was a bear,&quot; Rick said. &quot;Perhaps I did conceive when I was a bear and this is how the baby is going to survive.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But why become a hermaphrodite instead of a woman?&quot; Maylene asked.<br />
<br />
Rick thought for a moment then said, &quot;I don't know for sure. If I had to guess I would say that I got at least one of the other bears pregnant. It would make sense since I couldn't get pregnant and get someone else pregnant if I didn't have both sets of genitalia.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If this happened to you then how many others are having this happen to them?&quot; Maylene asked with fear in her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lets go find out,&quot; Rick said grabbing Maylene's hand and leading her out.<br />
<br />
As it turned out three other of the former bears had become hermaphrodites, one man had become a full woman, and one woman had become a full man. Each of them looked afraid and confused and one even tried killing themselves right in front of them. Fortunately Rick was able to wrestle the knife away before they could slash their wrists. After they were safely in the infirmary the captain ordered all rooms to be searched for knives and possibly guns. Since Rick seemed to be handling his transformation alright the captain decided to let him help search. If anyone else was being transformed seeing him and how he's handling it might help them.<br />
<br />
After helping to search for weapons Rick went back to his stateroom with Maylene. Dennis was playing with Marie's brother so they had time to themselves. &quot;What are you thinking about darling?&quot; Maylene asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I'm wondering what my name is now and whether or not you will still marry me,&quot; Rick said sadly looking down.<br />
<br />
&quot;I still love you darling,&quot; Maylene said and then kissed him.<br />
<br />
After Maylene broke the kiss Rick asked, &quot;Don't you feel weird kissing another woman?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I had never considered it before but it feels right with you,&quot; Maylene said with a smile. &quot;Look I love you. I love the person that you are. You are kind and caring. You don't want to see other people hurt and will do what you can to make sure they don't get hurt. Look what you did with Daniel. You saved his life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe if he had just become a hermaphrodite instead of a full woman he wouldn't need to have been saved,&quot; Rick said with a sigh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe and maybe not,&quot; Maylene said. &quot;You saved him though and that's the important thing. That's why I love you. Even if you had become a full woman I believe I would still love you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I love you Maylene,&quot; Rick said and kissed her.<br />
<br />
After they broke the kiss Maylene asked, &quot;So what do you want your name to be now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I've liked the names Lisa and Elizabeth,&quot; Rick said after a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then your name should be Elizabeth,&quot; Maylene said. &quot;Lisa will be your nickname.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds good to me,&quot; Rick said with a smile. &quot;I'll be Elizabeth from now on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think I could be pregnant?&quot; Maylene asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll just have to wait and see,&quot; Lisa said stroking Maylene's cheek with the back of her fingers. &quot;Maybe someone has some pregnancy tests that we could use.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I can wait for a bit,&quot; Maylene said laying her head on Lisa's shoulder. &quot;I don't know if could handle knowing if I was pregnant right now. I'd have no idea who the father would be.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know what you mean,&quot; Lisa said rubbing her lower belly. &quot;I'm pretty sure that I'm pregnant and I have no idea who the father is. All I know is that I'm going to keep my baby. I would like his/her father to know him/her but the probability of the father living in the US is pretty low. I think only two or three of the bears are from the US.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Maylene sighed. &quot;I don't think the father of my baby, if I'm pregnant, would be living in the US either. This is going to cause some heartache.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Imagine how I feel,&quot; Lisa said. &quot;Not only don't I know the father of my baby but I don't know whose baby I fathered.&quot; Sighing she said, &quot;The only way we'll know is through DNA tests. I'm not sure how many will agree to the tests not wanting to be reminded of what happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you should talk to the bears about this,&quot; Maylene said. &quot;Especially those that have transformed. It will be good to talk about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think we all need get together to talk,&quot; Lisa said. &quot;But right now all I want is to be with you. Well that and I have the urge to have sex with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I have the urge to have sex with you,&quot; Maylene said her voice breaking a bit. She rubbed Lisa's breast and kissed her. When she broke the kiss she said, &quot;I can't resist it anymore. I want to have sex with you darling.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then lets not waste any more time,&quot; Lisa said taking off her dress. She felt her dick stir as she kissed Maylene then helped her take off her dress.<br />
<br />
They kissed again and each one reached behind the other unclasping their bras. Once their bras were off they moved to their panties and soon they were both nude. They made their way to the bed where Lisa laid Maylene down and started playing with her pussy. Maylene also started playing with Lisa's pussy getting her wet and hard. Once Maylene was good and wet Lisa positioned herself and slowly inserted her dick into Maylene's pussy while Maylene inserted a couple of fingers into Lisa's pussy. As Lisa was pumping in and out Maylene was pumping her fingers in and out. This lasted for about an hour during which the both had a couple female orgasms. During the last orgasm Lisa also shot her load into Maylene.<br />
<br />
Rolling off Lisa asked, &quot;Do you have any regrets?&quot;<br />
<br />
Maylene smiled and said, &quot;No regrets. I love you and will marry you. Even if we don't get married for some reason I'll still be with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I'll need something for my pussy,&quot; Lisa said. &quot;Your fingers were nice but I need something that will fill it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maylene smiled and said, &quot;That can easily be taken care of. But lets not think about that right now. Lets just enjoy being together.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds good to me,&quot; Lisa said wrapping her arms around Maylene and giving her a kiss.</p>
