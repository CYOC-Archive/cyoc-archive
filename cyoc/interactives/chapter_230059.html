<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was really hard for Chad to know where they were or what was happening. He felt the cool breeze and the hot sun and knew they were outside but where? Danny just kept walking and if Chad didn&#39;t want to stumble, he had to let Danny control Chad&#39;s legs.<br />
<br />
Chad thought they walked on flat sidewalk for a while and then Chad thought they were on soft grass for a while and then they were back on flat sidewalk but were they moving north, south, left, right? Chad couldn&#39;t tell. Then they stepped off what seemed like a curb onto what Chad guessed was asphalt. Were they in the parking lot? The whole walk, Chad felt his now giant genitals bouncing between his bare, naked legs.<br />
<br />
Chad could hear but it didn&#39;t sound like anyone was nearby. He heard voices in the distance but it didn&#39;t seem like anyone had noticed Danny or Chad walking through, were they in the parking lot? There should have been more people around but maybe they were walking through the part of the parking lot that no one used.<br />
<br />
Then Chad heard what sounded like a car door opening. Danny seemed to shuffle around and then Chad felt himself pushed into, was it a car seat? Chad felt the hot vinyl on his bare, naked ass. Then Chad was pushed even deeper into the seat as if Danny was trying to sit on top of Chad. Chad was squished mercilessly and then Danny got out and dragged Chad out behind him.<br />
<br />
Then Chad felt himself backed into something. It was a very a small and unusually shaped space. Chad had to back in on his knees to fit. Some surfaces were vinyl. Some were plastic and some were metal. Then Chad&#39;s torso was bent sideways as it seemed that Danny tried to squeeze into the driver&#39;s seat. Chad felt uncomfortable squished and bent but no matter how hard Danny tried, Danny couldn&#39;t sit in the driver&#39;s seat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit, my car wasn&#39;t designed for a jocktaur. What other problems am I going to have to deal with? Guess I&#39;ll have to ride the bus.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad thought that maybe someone would finally notice them. How would they react seeing a jocktaur for the first time? Would they recognize that Chad was the back half of the jocktaur? Would anyone try to rescue him? Probably not but Chad hoped so.<br />
<br />
They continued walking but it didn&#39;t seem they were getting any closer to the crowd. The crowd of course would be other students participating in various extracurricular activities. Chad had hoped Danny meant getting on a school bus but that didn&#39;t seem to be where Danny headed.<br />
<br />
It seemed like they stood on the side of the road and waited. Chad could hear traffic sounds as cars passed by. Surely some of the drivers noticed the jocktaur with the naked back half on the side of the road. Why wasn&#39;t anyone responding? All the cars just kept going on their way, too busy to care.<br />
<br />
Chad heard the sound of the city bus coming to a stop. Danny was actually planning on taking Chad&#39;s naked lower half onto the city bus. How far was Danny planning on going on the bus.<br />
<br />
Chad felt himself step onto the crowded bus where his butt got pressed against various passengers.<br />
<br />
Danny knew something about the magic he had used to transform Chad and himself into a jocktaur. Anyone who got close to Danny would become friendlier and the closer the person got to Danny, the friendlier the person would be. This wasn&#39;t reality alteration. This wasn&#39;t any mental changes done to anyone. Everyone except Chad and Danny was still the same as they had always been and still had the same memories. The magic worked like an enchantment or like magical pheromones stimulating the friendlier centers of the brains of everyone who came within a certain range. The effect was strongest on anyone who physically touched Danny or Chad.<br />
<br />
Chad listened as disgruntled passengers saying things like &quot;Freak, get your ass off of me. How dare you rub your naked ass on me.&quot; changed into apathetic passengers saying things like &quot;It&#39;s okay. Must be tough trying to get around with such a huge ass. I can understand why you can&#39;t help but bump into me.&quot;  and then changed into downright friendly passengers saying things like &quot;So what&#39;s it like to be a jocktaur. You sure look handsome. Best looking jocktaur I&#39;ve ever seen. Mind if I check out your jocktaur cock?&quot; Then Chad would feel hands fondling his huge genitals. Chad knew that some of the people fondling him were male and Chad tried to pull away only to run into other hands reaching for his balls and cock. There was no escape.<br />
<br />
After a while, Chad heard a couple of cops board the bus. One of the cops said, &quot;Alright sir, mind telling me what you are doing riding around the city naked?&quot;<br />
<br />
Danny said, &quot;Sorry officer. I can&#39;t help it. You ever try to find clothes for a jocktaur?&quot;<br />
<br />
The officer said, &quot;Well, I&#39;m going to have to take you down to the station, at least until we can find you some clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Danny said, &quot;If you insist.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad felt as Danny&#39;s arms were pulled behind him and cuffed because Danny rested his cuffed hands on Chad&#39;s back.<br />
<br />
Then the cop said, &quot;You know what? You&#39;re right. Jocktaurs shouldn&#39;t even be required to wear clothes. It&#39;s too much of a burden. I&#39;m sure you struggle enough having two sets of legs separated by a full torso. Let me remove those cuffs and you can be on your way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Danny said, &quot;I&#39;d appreciate it, sir.&quot;<br />
<br />
As the officer removed the cuffs from Danny, he said, &quot;Your cock is really huge. Is that normal for all jocktaurs?&quot;<br />
<br />
Danny said, &quot;I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;m the only jocktaur in the entire universe so I guess the answer is yes. It is absolutely normal for all jocktaurs to have really huge cocks, at least on their back halves.&quot;<br />
<br />
The officer said, &quot;Your front cock isn&#39;t small either, you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
Danny said, &quot;Thank you, sir.&quot;<br />
<br />
As the officer was getting off the bus, he said, &quot;It&#39;s really a shame I can&#39;t take you with me. I would really like to see more of you. <br />
Oh well. Have a nice day.&quot;<br />
<br />
And with that, Chad was left to be groped and fondled for however long the trip lasted. Eventually, Danny got off the bus. Several hands followed trying to stay in contact with Chad&#39;s dangly bits.<br />
<br />
Danny said, &quot;Okay, that&#39;s enough. I&#39;ve got other things to do today.&quot;<br />
<br />
The people on the bus groaned in disappointment.<br />
<br />
It seemed to Chad like they walked in through a lobby and stepped onto an elevator. After the elevator rose a few floors, Danny got off and walked around some more. Then he opened a door and said, &quot;Hi Dad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You went and did it. You turned yourself into a, what did you call it, a jocktaur? I told you to wait. I told you I would make arrangements so that you could have a place to live and a job suited to being a jocktaur but no, you couldn&#39;t wait. You never were patient. And now we&#39;re going to have to scramble to figure some things out. Did they try to arrest you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Danny said, &quot;Yea they tried to arrest me but the magical enchantment worked like a charm.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That enchantment will help but it won&#39;t solve everything. Now I don&#39;t really know how all this magic stuff works and I don&#39;t want to know. I don&#39;t care how you grew an extra torso and pair of legs. Your life is going to be difficult. It would be easier if you weren&#39;t the only jocktaur. A whole group of jocktaurs could build your own little community with appropriate housing, jobs and transportation. I don&#39;t suppose you could convince any of your friends to become jocktaurs too. Or maybe you could star in a commercial convincing others who want to be jocktaurs to come and join you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Danny didn&#39;t think that would work. Nobody, not even Danny&#39;s dad, knew that a jock had to be sacrificed in order to change Danny into a jocktaur. Danny might be able to convince others to want to be jocktaurs but how would he be able to provide all the jocks needed to become their back halves. It was bad enough that Chad went missing and now people were going to be searching for what happened to Chad. Danny felt confident that they would never trace Chad&#39;s disappearance back to Danny but making a whole bunch more jocks disappear would be harder to keep secret.</p>
