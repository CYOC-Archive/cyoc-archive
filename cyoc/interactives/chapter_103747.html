<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Transforming at thirteen&quot; Tad asked to Amy as they continued to walk home.<br />
<br />
He was a bit surprised to see his new girlfriend on the way home and was further worried by what she had said to him. He could understand the fear nervousness that might be there for he brothers, but even thirteen sounded a little young for a naturally born were. He didn&#39;t transform until he was fourteen and his mother didn&#39;t transform for the first time until she was fourteen as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;It isn&#39;t common,&quot; Amy said slowly, &quot;but it does happen from time to time... usually the result of either an early onset of puberty or the were in question has a hormonal imbalance. Thankfully, in terms of medication, we have what is needed to make sure no were has trouble as a result of such an imbalance.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tad looked over to her as she looked down.<br />
<br />
&quot;And that&#39;s kinda what happened with me,&quot; Amy said slowly, &quot;I transformed early, caught my parents by surprise... and they&#39;re now nervous the same thing will happen with my brothers.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tad moved to hold her hand and giver whatever comfort she may need. There were, of course, other issues that he and his mom might have to face in the long run, but all that mattered for the moment was his girlfriend. After all, she&#39;d done a lot for him, even though they hardly knew each other. She was nice, beautiful, and put up with a lot of his own lack of knowledge on were society, based on only having his parents.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;m sure they&#39;re going to be fine,&quot; Tad said to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;But what if they end up interested in each other?&quot; Amy asked nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have they ever shown any inclination that they do?&quot; Tad wondered.<br />
<br />
Amy shook her head to say &quot;no.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Have they been having any odd nightmares or dreams?&quot; Tad asked, remembering some of the strange dreams he&#39;d had before his first transformation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not that they&#39;ve told me,&quot; Amy said slowly, &quot;but... I don&#39;t want them hurt or anything. They can be annoying at times, but they&#39;re still my brothers.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tad nodded and gave Amy&#39;s hand a squeeze, &quot;and I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll be fine. If it happens... it happens. It may help to have a partner... but it isn&#39;t required.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean isn&#39;t required?&quot; Amy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t think I had sex with my mother or father when I had MY first transformation, did you?&quot; Tad asked in a slightly humorous tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose not,&quot; Amy said slowly, &quot;but how did it go for you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When my dad and mom figured my first transformation was coming, my dad arranged to take about one week&#39;s leave and we went out to a pretty nice nature preserve in the Appalachian Mountains,&quot; Tad commented, &quot;it was a fairly decent drive from where my dad was posted, but it made for a good trip. We sat together on a fallen log out in the woods and he provided comfort as my transformation began and he changed with me. It let him talk me through it. It hurt a little... but I came through it okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that&#39;s good,&quot; Amy commented, &quot;though we tend to hope there is an available parter to make things easier.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tad nodded as they walked along. He understood some of that, as that related to how normals were inducted into were society, which his parents had given him some education on. However, his own past wasn&#39;t something to really let Tad claim authority on the subject. He was still &quot;new&quot; to Moon Lake and there was a lot about it that he was still learning. It didn&#39;t matter whether or not it was learning the scents of weres other than werewolf and werecat, or enjoying the freedom that Moon Lake had offered him while understanding the rules and customs of were society.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I&#39;m sure that your folks will have done what will be needed to see that if they need a female were, they&#39;ll find one,&quot; Tad assured Amy, &quot;parents will do things like that. They&#39;ll look for what is best to do for their children.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What if they are more interested in boys?&quot; Amy asked, more nervous than anything else, &quot;werewolves aren&#39;t known for homosexuality. Nate and Alex are in fact the weres in our pack that are gay, and they are an exclusive couple. Which could mean that they might not accept comforting a pair of thirteen year olds.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then would it have to be another werewolf?&quot; Tad wondered, &quot;maybe we could as a male werecat to provide some effort.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... a werecat wouldn&#39;t change their species...&quot; Amy mused, &quot;and that might help them, but then my parents would still be needed to give them more of the direct ins and outs werewolf pack customs, hierarchy, cooperation... and so on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That wouldn&#39;t be too bad, if they lean that way,&quot; Tad commented, &quot;and would be workable...&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy nodded as the two walked along. The streets had now become very familiar as the two ended up on their own home street and were approaching the Howler house.<br />
<br />
&quot;Though have they shown any romantic interest in men?&quot; Tad asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No... they&#39;ve just been typical boys,&quot; Amy answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then... those other options might not be necessary,&quot; Tad told her, &quot;your folks will find a female werewolf... or two... and your brothers will be in the best of hands... or paws, if their transformation does come early. And regardless of what happens, they&#39;re still your family. They&#39;ll love you and in the end, everything will be alright.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two hugged right outside Amy&#39;s home. The female werewolf, still in her human form as it was still daytime, then kissed her boyfriend&#39;s cheek.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; Amy smiled to him.</p>
