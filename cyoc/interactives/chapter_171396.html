<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There are many kinds of exotic dances across the world, few are more prominent than the belly dance. Originating in Egypt, the dancers of this style have had an impact across the world in many imitable forms. Most often, it&#39;s paired with female genies in various interpretations in pop culture. The bedlah style is undeniably one of the sexiest costumes commonly seen. And it&#39;s not much of a surprise that many patrons have requested belly dancers at the Meat Market. Ms. Fabina was more than happy to provide, but first, she needed the right dancer. Leila was an ideal candidate; an uplifted Arabian mare with less care for modesty than a converted one. But Fabina wanted more than just an imitation of a belly dancer. A genuine belly dancer would be more alluring than an imitation. Fortunately, Fabina knew just the teacher.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Having been the &#39;mistress&#39; of a Mafia boss, Fabina had seen many unsightly things. It wasn&#39;t much of a surprise that the boss occasionally wanted some exotic entertainment. And he had happened to have one belly dancer under his thumb that he could call up whenever he wanted. Though thanks to Fabina&#39;s new connections, she was able to help her escape to the USA, where she&#39;d be much safer. And she had already had an interest in Animalia before Fabina extended her offer to her.<br />
<br />
Mi-Soon was the rare type of woman whose beauty didn&#39;t fade with age, but became refined. Though time had made her features sharper than softer. Of course, a lot of it was due to the strict physical regimen that she kept herself in. As a professional belly dancer, her body was her livelihood and she wasn&#39;t ready to pass on the torch quite yet. Though she was interested in lighting a few new ones.<br />
<br />
&quot;Life&#39;s been treating you well?&quot; asked Fabina after they met up at the airport.<br />
<br />
Mi-Soon shrugged and said, &quot;Not as much call for a belly dancer in the States as I would have thought. Most of the jobs I get are for bachelor&#39;s parties. But this sounds more interesting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just so you know, it may not just be Leila you&#39;ll be teaching. Word&#39;s spread to New Zerzura and there are some girls there who are interested in learning to belly dance. Though I&#39;m not sure if they&#39;ll be able to set up a belly dancer club there. You know how conservative Muslims can be,&quot; said Fabina.<br />
<br />
&quot;Say no more,&quot; said Mi-Soon, &quot;As proud as I am of my heritage, I am quite aware of how self-repressive we can be. Sometimes I wonder where it all went wrong.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So anyways, had any thoughts about what you&#39;ll be?&quot; asked Fabina.<br />
<br />
&quot;I already told you I won&#39;t be a snake,&quot; said Mi-Soon, &quot;I have treasured my legs too long to just discard them. I have no objection to teaching serpents, though I will need to figure how best they can apply their bodies.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, anything you&#39;d prefer?&quot; asked Fabina.<br />
<br />
Mi-Soon thought it over, &quot;Something sensual and graceful. A desert cat would be most appropriate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, like a sand cat, maybe?&quot; asked Fabina, &quot;They&#39;re pretty cute.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, too cute,&quot; said Mi-Soon, &quot;If I&#39;m to be a teacher, I want to be taken more seriously.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then maybe a serval?&quot; suggested Fabina.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I want something with a longer tail,&quot; said Mi-Soon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Would a caracal do?&quot; asked Fabina.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm...actually, yes. I think that would suit me just fine,&quot; said Mi-Soon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; said Fabina, &quot;Fortunately, I&#39;m pretty sure Horizon Labs has some caracal samples from Bast.&quot;<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Some people prefer to strip when they&#39;re transforming. Some want to grow out of their clothes and wear something more easily ripped. Mi-Soon had a somewhat more practical reason for what she wanted to do. She was quite aware her figure could receive a big boost from being an Animalian. So she was wearing her belly dancer costume to see just how big she&#39;ll become. She&#39;ll need to get a new costume anyways so she may as well use her old one for a last time.<br />
<br />
After the scientist left her in the changing room, Mi-Soon looked over herself in the mirror. Her body was fit, but still worn. Her skin was on the leathery side and grey was showing in her hair. But all that would change soon. She was feeling her strength increasing as the serum spread through her body. Hairs start growing in a slightly unsightly way before they started thickening into reddish tan fur. She felt a tickle in her ears as she watched them slowly climb up the sides of her head, getting longer as they grew. Her face was also pushing out into a short muzzle, not unlike a housecat&#39;s. She could feel pressure in her lower back as her tailbone started growing out.<br />
<br />
Mi-Soon could really feel it when her body started revitalizing. Her black hair was turning darker and more lustrous. She could feel the skin under her new fur loosen up, but not become saggy. The greatest sensation was how her bra was becoming far too small for her growing breasts. She gasped as the pressure was more than she expected. Fortunately, the worn material didn&#39;t hold for long. Mi-Soon gave a sigh of relief as her bra split open, allowing her much bigger breasts out. She held them in her pawlike hands as she felt their heft. Animalian females were known for being well-endowed, but it&#39;s different to actually have such large knockers on her chest. Her costume&#39;s panties just barely survived, but it looked like they were going to rip apart too.<br />
<br />
Looking in the mirror, Mi-Soon liked the caracal woman she was seeing. Her distinct tufted ears rose up through her black tresses. Her tail was about half as long as she&#39;d seen with housecat Animalians, but it was still long enough for her. She could imagine doing provocative poses with that tail gesturing to come closer. And this curvy, supple body will look so ravishing in a new belly dancer costume. Mi-Soon smiled as she posed. &quot;My students better be able to keep up with me,&quot; she said with a purr, &quot;Because I think I&#39;m going to be on the stage for a long, long time.&quot;</p>
