<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Andy McSean was quiet satisfied with the results of his ice cream so far. And he couldn&#39;t wait to see what was going to happen next. Some might have called him crazy, and Andy would have accepted that as a legitimate possibility, but at least it was a fun kind of crazy. Maybe he was crazy and just imagining all this? Naw. That was TOO cliche. <br />
<br />
Honestly, he was disappointed he wasn&#39;t getting a crowd of people wanting his ice cream, but that was the way things went, maybe he&#39;d have better luck sooner? It was just his first day. And if he got repeat customers, well, he was an ice-cream man, far be it from him to not do is job.<br />
<br />
He spotted an elderly couple inching along the path along the park he&#39;d patrolled the perimeter of with his ice cream truck. They&#39;d be perfect, he wanted to drive alongside them and offer them a free sample! But he knew it was rude to try being an &#39;aggressive&#39; ice cream seller by offering his wares, that was a great way to alienate potential customers in this culture and might even get him in trouble if someone paranoid complained about it. And to top it off, they might think he was just taking pity on them.<br />
<br />
So as much as he wanted to share his ice cream with the world (his original plan had been to simply sell his ice cream to a major manufacturer, but he hadn&#39;t gotten any buyers or even taste testers), he had to wait for the world to come to him. <br />
<br />
Still, he could drive a little slower, and hope for the best couldn&#39;t he?<br />
<br />
&quot;Dear, how about some ice cream?&quot; Asked the husband almost excitedly.  <br />
<br />
&quot;... Oh why not?&quot; The woman said with an odd tone of resignation. <br />
<br />
Andy slowed his truck to a stop, and let the old couple walk up to the side. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello there, what can I get you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A cup of mint chip please,&quot; said the old man. <br />
<br />
&quot;And a cup of straw berry please,&quot; said the old woman. <br />
<br />
&quot;Right away.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andy scooped up the respective ice cream flavors. If one examined his selection closely, some might realize that the collection of ice cream was bigger on the inside than the outside, but this was just another happy little happenstance of &#39;toon logic.&#39;<br />
<br />
And if there was thing toon logic was known for, was that &#39;fridge logic&#39; had no authority around here, that included his own fridge for the ice cream! <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;ll be two dollars and twenty cents.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s cheap,&quot; the old man said. <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s how I stay competitive.&quot; <br />
<br />
The old couple took their ice cream with a &quot;Thank you,&quot; and Andy gave a &quot;You&#39;re welcome!&quot; with a tip of his white hat. <br />
<br />
The  couple slowly ate their ice cream with the pink plastic spoons included with their order. Andy was eager to see what the effects would be, every toon was different after all since every person was different. <br />
<br />
Andy was able to hide his surprised from the couple&#39;s changes weren&#39;t expected even from him! <br />
<br />
First their height decreased. The husband had been taller than his wife before, but as they shrank, they became an even three and a half feet tall! Not that they really noticed. All colors from them faded, becoming either black or paper colored beige. Their bodies became mass of black ink, their species rather hard to tell. Their feet were long paws and had three toes. Their hands from the signature four fingered white gloves. Their arms and legs, were like black rubber hoses that bent bonelessly. Their figures were elongated bean shaped. The husband&#39;s clothes formed into a pair of white overalls with a medal on it. The wife&#39;s dress became a single white ruffly skirt and nothing else that went around her waist and was there to identify her sex rather than hide anything, not that there was anything to show. <br />
<br />
Their necks were short and thin like rubber hoses too. Their eyes became large, shape like black disc pizzas with a slice taken out. Their ears moved to the top of their heads and became tall like antenna, with little droopy bents at the top. Their faces became epic grins, as pushed out into muzzles with a black dot for a nose on each. A mammalian tail snaked out of where their rears should be, completing their change. <br />
<br />
Then, there was a vision of a black screen with a detailed outline, and in the center were the words in quotations, <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow! That was some good ice cream!&quot; <br />
-- Cutesie <br />
<br />
The vision ended, the wife, Cutesie, smiling and nodded, time hadn&#39;t apparently passed as she spoke as Andy noticed from the clock in his truck. <br />
<br />
Then came another vision of a black screen a different styled outline, <br />
<br />
&quot;It sure was!&quot;<br />
- Boxie<br />
<br />
And the vision ended. It took Andy a few moments to realize had just happened. They were silent era black and white cartoon characters! He&#39;d never imagined that different animation styles would come about from his ice-cream! He thought they&#39;d all be the SAME animation style, create a sense of unity among them! He didn&#39;t want the toons to begin to be divided among themselves. Still... Cutesie and Boxie pranced off hand in hand, tossing the ice cream containers over their shoulders, and right into a trash bin without even looking. <br />
<br />
They waved to the toon husky boy and his dog, and his politely waved back with a smile. Well, nothing to worry about then.</p>
