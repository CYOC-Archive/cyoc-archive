<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Removing his shirt, Gus saw where exactly the two pairs of legs had gotten attached to his body. It was actually further up than he expected, as he saw his midreef had gotten wider, and he now had two belly buttons, one an innie and one an outie. His legs weren&#39;t attached to each other at the hips, meaning he had at least some free movement between each pair, even if he constantly bumped into himself as he walked. With every hesitant step he took, he swung his outer hips just a little further to the side than his other hips. It emphasized the new femininity in his walk.<br />
<br />
What frustrated him further, was the mess he had made with the women he&#39;d brought over. It felt like some weird leakage in his left groin, and when he brought a hand down to wipe over his new private parts, it returned with a disgusting thread of his own sperm.<br />
<br />
Not much longer, when washing his hands in the bathroom, he felt the same between his right legs.<br />
<br />
On TV, Gus saw just how severe the Great Fusion Wave has hit his home city, with at least one in three people affected by it. For one in ten, the consequences of their changes were so severe that they no longer had any freedom of movement, whether it was because their new anatomy wouldn&#39;t let them, or their new and unwanted parasitic twin had taken control over their body.<br />
<br />
Here he was, sitting on his sofa, one leg lifted up and spread apart, while he was clumsily wiping off the juices that were leaking out of one of his pussies in the process. He still only had two pairs of skirts on, feeling like he&#39;d maintain at least some of his dignity so long as he didn&#39;t look at his new labia too closely. Thus, he covered them at least a little bit, still, even if he knew he couldn&#39;t delay it forever.<br />
<br />
Gus&#39; movements were at least somewhat prohibited. Not by as much as the living embodiment of &#39;the Thing&#39; he was currently seeing on TV, but still to such an extent that he couldn&#39;t lie down on his side without feeling a painful tugging about where his new female pairs of legs were attached to his normal male upper body. Furthermore, walking was still a struggle, as he still hadn&#39;t figured out just what sequence he&#39;d have to hold in his step.<br />
<br />
He figured his frame would still be narrow enough to have it covered by a long dress, or perhaps even a long coat, so people wouldn&#39;t see just how drastically he had changed, but with four feet sticking out from underneath the fabric, he wouldn&#39;t be granted much leeway.<br />
<br />
Perhaps a long time ago, during his teenage years, he&#39;d have fantasized about being so close to a woman that they&#39;d never leave his side anymore. After several failed, and even toxic relationships, mostly related to his large fortune and their all too eager desire for marriage, he later vowed to himself never to be with a woman again, unless it was for an evening of joy and pleasure. Let them cry it out on court, he&#39;d have his lawyers by his side.<br />
<br />
But this was far too different.<br />
<br />
Each lower limb was that of a woman, and each pair of legs had different plumbing from his original set. This would require twice the upkeep, and double the trouble, given exactly how little he knew about what was down below, except that licking it gave the ladies pleasure, and fucking it gave Gus pleasure.<br />
<br />
Somewhere in his body, his spine would have to be split in two, but wherever his thoughts dwindled, the tingle of arousal travelled from his brain, down his two pussies, and their responses travelled back up again. Where he was still preoccupied with the cleaning, his groin gave no response, but the tingle grew stronger in his right side, as he felt his right pussy beginning to moisten again, and its clit, the one that was disproportionally larger than the other, grew harder and more pleasurable again.<br />
<br />
Gus concentrated on the business he was tending to on his left side, but it wasn&#39;t like his subconscious mind couldn&#39;t feel the increase in his heart-rate, the squirming of his legs, and the grinding of his right hips and ass against the surface of his sofa. It was only a matter of time before it would be drenched by the juices that were constantly leaking out of his new inner walls. His kegel muscles felt considerably more prevalent in his new anatomy, and they&#39;d involuntarily tighten up like he was having some small orgasms just as he sat there.<br />
<br />
The unique sensations didn&#39;t remain unattended to, as Gus sank further into his sofa just to see if he could regulate his breathing. The sensations were already intense with only one pussy growing wet and generally feeling on fire. He felt like some kind of masochist, as he just enjoyed his strange misery, the result of this strange new wave that had washed over him, and possibly his friends and family too.<br />
<br />
His new anatomy, the tingles that travelled through his spine, and the hormones that were fast-firing in his brain, were teasing him and turning the arousal between his legs into overdrive. Taking care of the damage had already been a chore, but as he sat on the bench, his right pair of legs spread wide, his left pair crossed, he pondered whether to test just how good these sensations could get.</p>
