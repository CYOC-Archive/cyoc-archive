<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Once settled in my room again the thought of getting something to eat crossed my mind. A walk out front of the Motel offered little for a place to eat so I decided to walk down main street and see this small town one store at a time.<br />
<br />
Hell was like so many other american towns as history passed it by. All the building were either very old or covered in some paint in an effort to make them look better than they were. It was then I saw the little diner made out of an oldtime interurban car.<br />
<br />
The tinkle of a bell announced my entery as several patrons turned to look at this fool walking inside. I plopped down in a window side booth and picked up the small menu card.<br />
<br />
&quot;You want coffee?&quot; came an abrupt sounding voice.<br />
<br />
I looked up to see what any Holloween kid would know to be the wicked witch of the west, my waitress!<br />
<br />
Poised so well with one hand on a rounded hip and the other holding of all things a metal coffee pot, she gave me a chill. To agree seemed the right thing to do as then I asked for some chilli and crackers.<br />
<br />
One need not think too much about where I was sitting to feel the anxiety building within that small eatery. A quick meal and I was out the door and feeling better to have eaten and be gone from there.<br />
<br />
&quot;You best be on your way!&quot; came a voice from an alleyway.<br />
<br />
Turning to face the young and slinky girl dressed as a Boston whore and painted like an indian ready for war she chewed a small black ladies type cigar.<br />
<br />
&quot;I planned to stay a day or two!&quot; I replied as the girl made a sort of odd snort and walked down the alley.<br />
<br />
My assignment was beginning to intriege me all the more, so at a distance I followed the girl into that alley. I did wonder why the alley seemed so long, as soon enough the building walls changed from old brick to aluminum siding.<br />
<br />
A scream of some person's obviously enormus pain came from inside one of the buildings. I moved with great caution now as a yellow light flooded the alley with rays of light.<br />
<br />
I peered around the corner of that open doorway to see two people walking about what looked like some almost verticle exam table. As another scream turned quickly to a moan of pain I snuck past the doorway and began to zig zag my way ever closer.<br />
<br />
At last I stood behind some file cabinents and had a very good view of what was occuring. The two people were a man and one woman dressed in  lab coats and working about the subject who was strapped to that table.<br />
<br />
Whatever they were doing to the man strapped there and moaning his fate the floor was littered in trampled piles of animal manure and it stunk something horrid. it was as I looked on that the man came very close and opened one file drawer pulling out some folder. He returned to his work and noted to the woman of something she should do.<br />
<br />
Then the man stepped very close indeed to the strapped man on the work table. He looked at the man and then when their eyes met he began to speak.<br />
<br />
&quot;You interfeared with our neat business here and because of your prying ways we feel it was time for you to take your place in the history books! As you can feel even now the serums are working the way into every muscle and organ. These prepair you for the coming of Misses Latier as she will perform your actual change. I know some of what you feel having done this a thousand times on men, women, and runaways who like you have taken their place upon the pages of our stud farm ledger. Oh, bye the bye we have for you made some small and special exception. As with all the others they are in control of their animal selves to a point, but you, you will not be in control but the equine instincts will be the prime force in your coming years. You will be as now strapped down mentally and only able to watch as the animal and beast you are does, as the natural animal would!&quot; explains the man as the woman gives a soft chuckle.<br />
<br />
The sight of the man is like a human form standing on hoofs and without any toes. He is very hairy and has the short beginning of a tail out from under his rump. His wrists are gaining in length as chest muscles bulge looking like those of some large animal.<br />
<br />
I wished I'd brought my infared camera but the click it makes would or might have me on their changing table too. Slowly I snuck my way back out to the alley only to come suddenly face to face with my friendly Boston style whore.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Seen enough there Deary?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
I took her arm and we walkwed some distance from that doorway before I turned and asked what she was doing there. It was explained that the man on the changing table was in very fact her boyfriend. He had insulted Misses Latier the week before and was for that choice moment now becoming one of her prize stallions.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why this goofy getup, why look like some big town whore, do something!&quot; I remember saying.<br />
<br />
Standing there she began to sob and I took her arm as we walked back up the alley to streetside.  She informed me of how the Misses Latier had come by the farm and over as many years she built the farm stud business on some who wished to become a horse and others who didn't.<br />
<br />
As we walked back toward the Motel I asked how she went along like this without bringing attention upon herself. It was minutes later when inside the confines and privacy of my Motel room the girl did show me why she walked about so free.<br />
<br />
I sat there with a mixed drink and watched the show as layer after layer of paint and clothing hit the floor. Soon I gulped the drink and sat up on the edge of my chair. The girl was for all intent and in fact a changling herself. A slim body which could lure any man to his doom stood there from head to foot covered in a Summer's coat of light horsey hair. A pair of tight black nipples adorned her pouty round breasts. A turn to the side offered the view of a tail cut short so as to fit rolled up and held with a postal rubberband so as nobody might see. Her toes had merged together an once outside the high heeled shoes looked like she was soon to walk on hooves permanently.<br />
<br />
I got up and walked about her taking into memory this sweet and slender form while down deep the sensual sight was making me even wish to join her as some sexy filly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You see what that woman can do! I worked for her one Summer last year while doing a study for my college biology class. It was then one morning she came to me and with those two henchmen they strapped me to their table and began what God only knows will happen to me sometime in the years to come.&quot; grumbled the girl.<br />
<br />
I looked at her and she took obvious note of my peering eyes. A quick bend and she presented me with what I knew was not the vagina of a woman but the placement and color of one true equined form.<br />
<br />
I wanted and almost reached out to touch and feel of the large folds of blackened skin but as I moved my hand she stood up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damnit your as bad as they are, a pervert like that dirty Doctor Hindleec!&quot; the girl hollared.<br />
<br />
I apologized about my thoughts but told her of just how her body made me feel allured as if to touch and enjoy.  She told me that was the curse which Misses Latier told her would happen. It was that as she went through life and had pleasured sex with either man or beast she would continue to change. It was only a matter of time before she, wherever she lived would become part of the equine history books.<br />
<br />
The flash of my camera no doubt lighted up the front windowshade of my room as soon a call from the front desk warned me of my actions. Today in my files I have pictures of Salley Ann Brach who one day will take her place as some brod mare in a stud farm in America.</p>
