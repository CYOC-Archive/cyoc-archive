<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Okay, we might have a slight problem,” Paul said. “Before John might have been a baby, but he at least knew what was going on. How do I get him to take his turn?”<br />
 <br />
“Just hand him the dice,” Jack replied. “He’ll have to at least drop them.”<br />
 <br />
Paul did as Jack suggested, putting one cube in one tiny palm, and the other cube in the other tiny palm.<br />
 <br />
In John’s mind, he didn’t know what his Dad was doing. Being pretty hungry, John put one of the things in his mouth.<br />
 <br />
“Nope! No, no, no, no, John-john,” Paul said, trying to stop his brother from choking. “This isn’t food. It’s for play. Play time!”<br />
 <br />
John stared at Paul blankly.<br />
 <br />
Paul tried a different tactic. He put his baby brother on the ground, his big baby head pointed towards the game board. He imitated what he wanted the baby to do, pretending to toss the dice towards the board. “Like this, baby brother,” Paul said.<br />
 <br />
The other players watched in anticipation as the grown man tried to get a literal baby to play a board game. By chance, John limply tossed one dice and the other fell out of his hand. The board seemed to accept the change, moving John forward a few spaces onto a positive space. The orb showed a +9.<br />
 <br />
“Oh, awesome,” Paul said. “I’m sure baby bro here will enjoy being back to his normal age.”<br />
 <br />
And John did start to grow, aging quickly past his toddler years and into childhood. But unlike the other times, his clothes weren’t changing with him. Instead, as he grew into his original ten-year-old state, his diaper grew with him. It became thick and still a little damp from his earlier wettings. John himself had a look of bewilderment on his face as he settled back into a ten-year-old boy wearing only a diaper.<br />
 <br />
The group stared at John as he settled into his changes. They expected an acknowledgement from him, maybe some comment about how embarrassing it was to be a kid in a giant diaper. Instead, his face contorted, and he began to let out a wail.<br />
 <br />
“Ww…wwaaAAA! DaaaAAdDDYY!” John crawled up into Paul’s lap, grabbing on his brother’s neck and sitting his diapered bum face-first towards Paul. John cried into the older man’s neck, much to Paul’s bewilderment.<br />
 <br />
“I think that perhaps he’s still in a baby state of mind,” Paul said. “The special space really did a number on him.”<br />
 <br />
The rest of the group expressed their discomfort over the grown boy in diapers wailing at the top of his lungs.<br />
 <br />
“Can’t you get him to settle down?” Ellis almost yelled over John’s cries.<br />
 <br />
“He seems to be pretty frightened after that change,” Paul responded. “Maybe a binky or a bottle would help? It would give the big guy something to suck on.”<br />
 <br />
“We have some bottles downstairs in the kitchen,” Hank piped up. “Left over from when this one was in diapers.” He gestured to Jack, seemingly trying to lay on another joke. But the other boys were too distracted by the giant baby in their midst.<br />
 <br />
Jack himself was especially annoyed by the noise. “I’ll go down and prepare a bottle. Quickly.”<br />
 <br />
A few minutes later, Jack re-entered the room with a bottle of warmed milk. He walked over to John, who was still crying into Paul’s shoulder.<br />
 <br />
“Hey kid,” Jack said. “You hungry?”<br />
 <br />
John looked up at Jack and sheepishly took the bottle. He placed it in his mouth and started sucking away. The crying had finally stopped.<br />
 <br />
Jack looked down at the transformed John. “Oh dear, oh dear. What a fall from grace. Any of us could have ended up like him.”<br />
 <br />
“I think I much prefer being older,” Paul said, gingerly placing John back on the ground to enjoy his bottle mindlessly by himself. “I mean, being younger is probably okay. But I don’t think I’d want to be like John, a grown boy with a baby brain and no bladder control. Speaking of which, I hope that diaper holds. Chances are that he is stuck like this for the rest of the game, seeing how infrequently any of us end up on a special space. And I don’t think we’d be able to find a diaper that will fit him anymore.”<br />
 <br />
“Yeah, and I can’t imagine having to change my best friend,” Jack said. “I supposed we better hope for the best. He’s sorted for now. It’s your turn.”<br />
 <br />
Paul nodded and picked up the dice. He was eager to get moving with the game, so he quickly tossed them to the board.<br />
 <br />
As his piece began to move, he realized that he had just gotten doubles. His fate was sealed as he landed on a positive space and his body started to age. Paul started to round out a bit more, his muscles taking a back seat to the aging process. His back began to curve, and he sat in his seat more and more hunched over. His head became completely bald, he grew long, wiry hair from his eyebrows, and his nose hair filled out. Paul’s facial hair was snow white now, and the wrinkles and age spots on his face solidified his age. Piercings appeared along his eyebrow and more on his ears. No new visible tattoos appeared, but Paul snuck a peek inside his old man trousers and saw a tattoo had been added to his hairless groin, and his penis had been tattooed over completely to look like a snake.<br />
 <br />
Paul shook his head in disbelief, and he settled into the oldest age of the group. “Well,” Paul said, his voice gravelly and slow, “I think that I’m, uh, over ninety now, right?”<br />
 <br />
Ellis looked at the old Paul with pity. He could tell he was having a bit of a hard time remembering things. “Ninety-six, abuelo.”<br />
 <br />
“Uh, what did you just call me,” Paul said, raising his pierced eyebrow at Ellis.<br />
 <br />
“It means ‘grandpa,’” Ellis said, giggling slightly.<br />
 <br />
“Oh,” Paul said, chuckling a bit himself. “You know, I remember that when this game started, I was the youngest one. And now, I’m the oldest by a long shot.”<br />
 <br />
“We can see that, Paul,” Bob said, turning to Jack. “I thought you said we wouldn’t get too old and possibly, you know, die!”<br />
 <br />
“The upper limit is ninety-nine,” Jack responded. “He’s going to be fine.”<br />
 <br />
“Don’t you worry, Bob,” Paul responded. “Being this old geezer is kind of fun.” He shifted in his seat, groaning a bit. “I do think that, uh, I might need some help with the oversized baby here. Joints aren’t as good as they used to be!”<br />
 <br />
“My god,” Ellis said, grabbing the dice. “He even talks like mi abuelo.”<br />
 <br />
Ellis threw the dice on the board, moving his piece seven spaces onto…<br />
 <br />
“A negative!” Ellis pouted. “I’m never going to be as old as my dad.”<br />
 <br />
“Let’s just hope we don’t end up with too many babies in our party,” Hank responded.<br />
 <br />
A -11 showed up in the orb. “Nope,” Ellis said. “Just have to experience being a teenager.”<br />
 <br />
Ellis’ muscles and height shrunk together. His body hair receded as well, leaving him with a thin happy trail on his stomach and some hairs in his arm pits. His cool stache and stubble receded as well, giving him only a thin bunch of wispy hairs above his lip. He settled in the middle of puberty again, bare chested and clad in a loose pair of jeans and fly sneakers.<br />
 <br />
“Hey,” Ellis said as his own voice cracked, “I think that Bob and I are the same age again.”<br />
 <br />
“Yeah,” Bob said. “Thirteen, for now. It’s my turn, and who knows what will happen.”<br />
 <br />
“Come on, just revel in the moment,” Ellis replied. “There are a hundred ages we could be and we ended up the same one. That’s cool.”<br />
 <br />
“I supposed,” Bob said. “I do want to keep going. I want to win and make everyone back to the way they were.”<br />
 <br />
“Ugh, spoil sport.” Ellis said.<br />
 <br />
Bob picked up the dice and threw them onto the board. He went pretty far, moving a whole ten spaces. His piece moved and landed on the special space, making him the next subject of unknown changes.<br />
 <br />
“Oh no,” Bob said. “Not good, not good, not good!”<br />
 <br />
The crew saw as the orb revealed new words. Instead of a number, Bob read “Gender Swap” in the mist.<br />
 <br />
Ellis started to cackle yet again. “Ha! You’re going to be a girl!”<br />
 <br />
Bob leapt up! “How could this happen?”<br />
 <br />
The boys watched as Bob started to change slightly. The hair under his arms thinned out, his chest and stomach hair disappeared. Everyone could see as his face rounded out and became softer, more feminine.<br />
 <br />
“What is happening?” Bob’s voice was changing to bit higher as he spoke.<br />
 <br />
“Looks like you’re lucky enough to experience the other side,” Jack said. “Or unlucky. Depends on the way you look at it.”<br />
 <br />
Still only being thirteen, not too much changed about Bob’s development. There was an unmistakable change in his body shape, however, as muscle tone was reduced and weight was shown shifting to Bob’s thighs. He was still shirtless, and the group saw as Bob’s chest started to puff out into breasts. Bob felt the weight change, and covered himself in embarrassment. He could feel as his penis receded into his body and form a hole where there once was nothing. His testicles did the same, flattening his bulge nicely in front and forming new reproductive organs inside. His pants changed to be tighter as well, showing off Bob’s change in physique and sex.<br />
“This is too much!” Bob yelled. He ran out of the room, holding his boobs as he went.<br />
 <br />
The group was silent for a bit.<br />
 <br />
“Well,” Jack said, “I suppose this means that I get to spend a bit more time at this age while Bobette figures herself out.”<br />
 <br />
--<br />
 <br />
Bob ran towards the bathroom. He closed the door behind himself, and started to catch his breath. This is definitely not what he has signed up for! Why hadn’t the other guys just played Smash Brothers like he suggested?<br />
 <br />
He knew he had to face the music at some point, especially if he was going to ever be able to change back. Mustering up the courage, he walked towards the mirror. The first thing he noticed was how dirty the mirror was, but he was quickly entranced by the reflection, his reflection, before him.<br />
 <br />
His face was softer, and his ginger hair had lengthened slightly to give him a more girlish haircut. He uncovered his boobs and started to touch his face. There was something…nice about the way he looked suddenly.<br />
 <br />
Bob examined this new body, finding that he didn’t mind his new shape as much as a moment ago. Even his breasts were kind of cute, even though he was used to a flat chest. He jiggled them a bit and giggled. Looking down further, he found himself curious at what his bottom half looked like now. He unbuttoned his pants, finding a plain pair of panties below, instead of the briefs he once wore. <br />
<br />
He slowly revealed his crotch, seeing his new pussy for the first time. He ran his hands over it, feeling slight bits of pleasure in ways he’d never felt before. He pulled the sides apart, feeling the hole that was there, being careful not to overstimulate himself.<br />
 <br />
Suddenly feeling scared to go any further, he pulled his hand back. Bob turned around to view his backside, seeing his new, shapely and girly butt. It was smooth in a way that his old body and boy teenage body had never been. Turning back towards the mirror, he took in the full picture. Once a ten-year-old boy, now a thirteen-year-old girl. Something about the new person before him felt…right?<br />
 <br />
Bob was interrupted by a knock at the bathroom door.<br />
 <br />
“Niña,” Ellis said. “I have something for you.”<br />
 <br />
Bob pulled up his panties and jeans. He unlocked the bathroom door and peered slightly outside, covering his boobs.<br />
 <br />
“This was next to your clothes,” Ellis said, holding out a training bra. “It looks like it appeared after you transformed.”<br />
 <br />
Bob snatched the bra out of Ellis’ hands. Closing the door and locking it behind her, she examined the bra.<br />
 <br />
Her bra.<br />
 <br />
Bob found that she knew exactly what to do. She slipped it on, reaching behind her back to snap the closure in place. Her chest was covered finally.<br />
 <br />
Finding new confidence, Bob opened the door to the bathroom. Ellis turned around, seeing Bob in her new form for the first time clearly.<br />
 <br />
“Oh,” Ellis said. “Wow, that, uh, that game sure did a number on you.” He stared directly at her boobs, gazing indiscreetly.<br />
 <br />
“Yeah. Thanks for the bra, Ellis,” Bob replied.<br />
 <br />
“Yeah, the bra,” Ellis said, still staring. He felt his penis start to chub up inside his pants.<br />
 <br />
“Eyes are up here, friend,” Bob said, noticing his friend’s lustful gaze.<br />
 <br />
“Oh, sorry Bob,” Ellis said.<br />
 <br />
Bob huffed and walked past Ellis, heading back into the room. Ellis watched as Bob walked away, her butt swishing with each step. There was no denying it. Ellis was getting the hots for Bob.<br />
 <br />
Bob walked into the room. “Okay,” she addressed the crowd. “First thing before we continue. I want my shirt back. Taking it off was a stupid rule to begin with.” She found her shirt, which had changed into a tighter fitting bright blue v-neck from Old Navy. She slipped it on to gain some modesty.<br />
 <br />
“Second,” she continued. “I’m not going to tolerate any staring. Let’s keep focused on the game and get all of you back to normal.”<br />
 <br />
Ellis sat down next to Bob. “What do you want us to call you?” Bob stared back at Ellis, who shrugged in return. “It just feels weird calling you Bob, when you look so…like that, I mean.”<br />
 <br />
She had to agree. “Let’s just go with Bobbie for now,” she replied. “The game has made me a girl, there’s no denying that. Might as well go with it while we can.”<br />
 <br />
“Well, well,” Jack piped up. “Seems like a change of tone from little Bobbie here. Glad you are finally enjoying yourself. I’m sure you had a...change of heart, shall we say, after your alone time in the bathroom.”<br />
 <br />
Bobbie shot Jack a furious look. “You’re disgusting, Jack. Good to know you grow up to be a dirty old man.”<br />
 <br />
“And you grow up to have tits, it seems,” Jack retorted.<br />
 <br />
The rest of the group groaned, and tiny Hank piped up the loudest.<br />
 <br />
“Stop acting like that, Jack,” Hank said. “I can’t believe I raised you like this.”<br />
 <br />
“Ah, whatever,” Jack replied. “Let’s just see what this game has for me now. John’s bottle is running out and I don’t want to hear his crying again. Paul doesn’t seem to be up to taking care of him anymore.”<br />
 <br />
Paul didn’t respond, as he was snoozing off in his chair.<br />
 <br />
Jack shook his head and rolled the dice. He only moved a few spaces and landed, once again, on a negative space. The orb showed a whopping -12.<br />
 <br />
“Come on!” Jack said as the changes began. “Can’t I catch a break?”<br />
 <br />
Jack started to become less defined muscularly, his hair started growing back in, and his tattoo faded from his body. Wrinkles faded, his jawline defined a bit more. His cock grew a bit more, but then shrunk down as he once again became a teenager. His beard was there still, but much shorter and had no visible gray.<br />
 <br />
All in all, Jack was quite a looker. But, as he rubbed his head, he felt as if he had lost something with this change in maturity.<br />
 <br />
“You look good, son,” Hank said, moving towards the dice. “Not quite old enough to be my dad anymore, but you&#39;re not the nine-year-old I know.”<br />
 <br />
“Just go, Hank,” Jack said, moodier than ever. “I’m far from the finish line and just want to experience being an adult, but no, the game seems determined to make me young.”<br />
 <br />
Hank threw the dice, his piece moved a lot further than Jack’s had before. When the orb showed bright, it revealed another big change, a +14.<br />
 <br />
“And it’s determined to make you old,” I guess.<br />
 <br />
Hank started to grow from his small childlike stature to match that of his son. He fast tracked through puberty, growing hair on his face, his body, under his arms. His crotch filled back out, and his clothes changed to a cool, slim button up and a pair of jeans.<br />
 <br />
As he settled into the same age as his son, Bobbie and Ellis couldn’t help but notice a striking similarity.<br />
 <br />
“It’s like…” Bobbie started. “You two are twins.”<br />
 <br />
The two young men stared at each other, seeing how similarly they were. It wasn’t too surprising, considering one was the literal progeny of the other, but how similar was just too eerie.<br />
 <br />
“I feel like I’m going to have trouble telling you two apart,” Ellis said.<br />
 <br />
“I feel the same way,” Hank replied, intrigued with his son’s reflection.<br />
 <br />
“I guess we are more alike than I thought,” Jack said.<br />
 <br />
On cue, John’s bottle was finished. He started to moan again, causing the rest of the group to protect their ears from the ten-year-old wailing.<br />
 <br />
“Whuh, what’s going on,” Paul exclaimed, jolting awake with a comically great-grandfather flair. His eyes grew wide as he looked at each of the other players. “It seems I’ve been asleep and missed a few things. Is that you, uh…”<br />
 <br />
“Bobbie,” she explained. “Yes, it’s still me.”<br />
 <br />
Paul chuckled. “Woo! Didn’t see changes like that back in my day.”<br />
 <br />
“Oh goodness, Paul,” Bobbie rolled her eyes. “You may be the oldest, but you’re still the youngest person here, you geezer.”<br />
 <br />
“Ha! And it looks like we have two pairs of people that are about the same age,” Paul said. “Uhhh, I can’t tell which one of you is which, but will either Jack or Hank help me with little John here?”<br />
 <br />
The sixth round of this increasingly interesting board game had ended. John’s body had changed back to his original 10-year-old self, but was still stuck in the mind of a baby. Paul’s age had doubled to 96! Ellis made his way back down to 13. Bobbie had stayed at 13, but had shifted her gender. Jack found himself going down again to 18, and his father Hank had risen to 18, leaving the father and son as generational equals.</p>
