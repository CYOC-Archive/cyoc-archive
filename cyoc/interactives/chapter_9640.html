<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Josh remained lying on the floor, on his stomach, with his head proped up with his arms. He was going through the book, slowly turning each page, just enough so he could see the title of each spell.<br />
<br />
Marco and Ric, who were a 1/4 donkey each, eyed little Josh on the floor. Ric kneeled down in front of his little brother, while Marco circled around him and strateled the back of his thighs. Josh felt the pressure of Marco sitting on his legs, he tried to get up, but Marco wouldn't budge. He turned forward, he saw a large throbbing cock, no more  than 5 inches from his face. It was already wet with pre-cum. He looked past the rod and noticed it was attatched to his transformed brother. Just then, he felt strong large hands grab his waist and lift them till he was resting on his hands and knees. Josh instinctivly closed his legs, but marco's strong arms pryed them apart and plungded into him with his own pulsating cock. Josh began whimpering as he felt Marco's rod tunnel into him. He tried his best not to move and to try and fight Marco's entrance. Marco was still holding on to Josh's hips,  he pulled them towards him. All at once, Marco's cock entered Josh, Josh was still in pain, but now he felt something else, it felt good to have Marco in there, thought Josh. Josh decided to try something, he moved his hips back and forth, that felt good he thought. <br />
<br />
A hand roughly grabed his chin and turned his face forward. &quot;What?!&quot; Josh didn't even get to pronounce the &quot;t&quot;. Ric's tool was already past his Josh's soft lips by the &quot;a&quot;. Ric moved forward on his knees. He didnt want Josh to be able to back up, and with Marco behind them now, he couldn't. Ric held on to the sides of his brother's face and started pumping his cock into his little brother's warm and small mouth. <br />
<br />
All of this was too much for Josh, his own little prick got hard and began slapping against his flat underdeveloped stomach. Marco kept one large hand on Josh's waist and moved the other one around and started jacking off Josh's young cock. Josh didn't even know what he was doing anymore, only that it felt good, the cock in his mouth, the one up his boy cunt, and his own. He didn't even know who was at the front or at the back anymore, or who's hand was playing with his dick. <br />
<br />
They began to slow down. Ric and Marco had the same thought, they wanted this to last for a while.  Marco began rubbing Josh's soft thin back. Running his whole hand along the boy's spine, and rubbing circles arounds his shoulder blades, aswell as stroking his thighs and claves. Ric began petting Josh's hair and caressing his shoulders. They kept on pumping little Josh for an hour. Josh had stopped thinking along time ago and had come three times already. His body just kept on going, his mouth kept on sucking and playing with the cock with his tongue. His ass never stopped rocking, back and forth, and squeezing Marco's tool. Marco and Ric looked at each other, it was time. Marco grabed Josh by his waist and held on tight. Ric held on to his head. Josh was alert now, he knew what was coming. Everyone began to speed up. The sound of slurping and sliding could be heard from each end of Josh. Ric and Marco became ridgid and began to shot their loads into Josh. Josh took it all in. He felt the jets of warm cum hit the back of his throat and slide down, into his stomach. Their was a warmness spreading out from his hole. He guessed that was Marco cuming. The boys seemed to stay there for ten minutes, just filling up Josh. Finally, an exhausted Marco and Ric plopped out of Josh and collapsed on to the carpeted floor. Josh stood there, still on his hands and legs, his mouth was still going, so was his ass. He toppeled over, more tired than the other two. They all fell asleep.<br />
<br />
It was already dark when they came to. Marco was the first to wake up. He looked around, all the lights were off and the house was dark and quiet. He recogzined the room he was in. It was his boyfriends living room. They must have had a really great time out there tonight. He couldn't remember what had happened, all he knew was he was naked and tired. That kinda tired you only get from great sex. He stumbled through the dark living room and hallway, and found the bathroom. He went right over to the toilet to relieve himself, without turing on the lights or shuting the door. He lifted the seat, took hold of his piece, and let it flow.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, in the living room, Marco's stream hitting the water, had woken up Ric. Ric stood up and looked around. He noticed a form curled on the floor, it looked like his brother, but was a little too big. He decided it was a trick of the light. All the lights in the house were off. He slowly began to remember. The book. The spells. And what had happened between him and Marco, and later, what happened between him, Marco, and his little brother. He could still hear Marco pissing in the bathroom. He went over to him. <br />
<br />
Ric stepped inside, shut the door and turned on the lights. <br />
Marco had just finished up, when Ric had flicked the lights on. &quot;What the Fuck!&quot; Marco yelled. That's right, he remembered, Francicso had the boys over, in fact they'd be over all summer. He cursed himself for forgetting about them. He couldn't stumble around the house naked and drunk, he thought. Marco quickly grabbed a towel to cover himself up. He looked over at Ric. Wow! He thought to himself, this boy is really hitting puberty fast. He had remembered Ric as being only at the beginning of manhood. Now it looked like they had a full-fledged teenager on their hands. He must have gotten alot taller, too, he's looking me in the eye. He haden't seen Ric in a couple of weeks. Not since Francisco's Birthday party. <br />
<br />
He was glad the town knew about them. Most people were pretty much alright with it. And when the boys' Mom, who had been the most respected parent in the school district, had decided to let them stay over for the summer, everyone was ok with them.<br />
&quot;Sorry, I forgot you guys were here for the summer&quot; said Marco. He noticed his voice, it sounded odd, wasn't morning voice supposed to make you sound deeper, not higher, he thought to himself.<br />
Ric stared at the 12 year old Marco. He still had hair around crotch, he saw that much before Marco had covered himself with a towel. He could see hair on his legs, and a trail leading up across his belly, on his arms and armpits. From what he had glimpsed, Marco still had a 6 inch soft cock. <br />
<br />
They heard a noise come from the living room. Ric set off to see what was happening and Marco trainled behind, not even looking at his reflection in the mirrow before turning off the bathroom light.<br />
Josh had woken up, sore from their hour and a half long fuck fest. He remembered everything, he wondered if he had gotten taller, and if his muscles were any bigger and about his cock, too. He heard voices in the bathroom and decided to go and look his body over in the mirror. He tripped across a backpack on the way there, no one had turned on the lights yet. Josh fixed that. He reached out and turned on the hall light just as Ric and Marco bumped into him. Josh looked down at his body. He was taller than before! As tall as Ric or Marco. He was a hairy as them and his muscles were just as big as theirs. He took hold of his dick, it was 6 inches long, and he wasn't even hard. They looked like a couple of boys who had been swimming, doing gymnastics, and body building all thier lives. Their muscles were taunt and springy. They had good definition everywhere on thier bodies. <br />
Marco and Ric found themselves face to face with the now-transformed Josh. He looked alot like them now, thought Ric. Marco started to think puberty happened fast in that family. He haden't noticed his own changes yet.</p>
