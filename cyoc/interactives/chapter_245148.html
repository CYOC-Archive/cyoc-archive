<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Well then&quot; Kyle said, sounding incredibly smug, &quot;Time&#39;s up, that means you get both&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why should I ca-&quot; Jen said, trying to sound dismissive<br />
<br />
&quot; You should care,&quot; Kyle interjected &quot;because I&#39;m gonna make sure living a normal life is gonna be Very Hard from now on, I&#39;m not so cruel that I want to make it Impossible though&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyways, we got distracted, we should be discussing your Transformation&quot; <br />
<br />
there was silence for a few seconds, except for the ruffling of paper in the background<br />
<br />
&quot;here it is, i&#39;ve written it down, your transformation will turn you into a human/dog hybrid,your mind will stay entirely as it is now and your body will mostly look the same, but your sense of smell will improve quite a bit, not quite to the level of a dog, but you sense of smell will be closer to a dog&#39;s then a human by a fair margin, same goes for your hearing, your Vocal cords will change too, you&#39;ll still be able to talk, but talking is now a much more conscious effort, so if you get surprised, or become too emotional in any way, or even forget to put in the effort to speak normally, you&#39;ll start barking, growling and whining like a dog,&quot; kyle read off<br />
<br />
Jen was... not quite horrified, sure she&#39;d have to put in a bit more effort in speaking, but most of it felt like getting improvents, not much of a curse. Kyle was not done yet, however not by a long shot<br />
<br />
&quot;Next up&quot; Kyle continued &quot;we&#39;ll have your first of a very limited amount of external changes, your Tongue will lengthen quit a lot, until its about half a foot long, it will widen and flatten marginally to give it a slightly doglike look, and when you get hot, in addition to sweating as normal you&#39;ll also have a slight urge to start panting like a dog, like with talking, it will be quite easy to keep this impulse contained, and when your new tongue is pulled inside you are perfectly able to make it pass like a normal human tongue, but it will still be a conscious effort, and panting will work very well in cooling you down, faster then just using human sweating alone. related to this is your digestive system, it&#39;ll change to allow you to subsist on the same diet as a dog as well as you would on a human diet, and while human food will taste just as good as it always did, Dog food and dog snacks will taste even better to you&quot;<br />
<br />
that was, something, Panting and preferring dogfood would make things harder, especially if she could smell the dog food with that new nose she would get<br />
<br />
&quot;so moving down, Your Pussy and Womb will also change, in addition to your period  you&#39;ll also go in heat once a month, starting about a week after your period ends, during which you&#39;ll be quite horny, and your pussy will emit pheromones that will make any man who smells them go into a state where they want to fuck you and impregnate you, they wont be like beasts, unless they were already inclined to be, but you&#39;ll smell sexy to them and you&#39;ll definitely get a lot of men asking to have sex, this can be relatively easily be solved by covering your pussy as normal and wearing pants, but only wearing a swimsuit bikini or a dress with direct access to panties wont be able to suppress the pheromones completely,  masturbating will take the edge of for a few hours, but keep in mind that doing so will get the pheromones over the rest of your body, so remember to wash that of afterwards. the only ways to get rid of the heat completely is to wait it out, which will take at least a week, often longer, or get knocked up, which will be quite easy, since you&#39;ll be hyper-fertile during your heat, you&#39;ll also give birth to litters, but in your case that means your always have at least twins, with triplets being also common, and quadruplets being about as rare as twins are in normal humans, your pregnancies will be shortened to that of a dog&#39;s so about 2 months, to compensate you&#39;ll need to eat a lot more in that time period, your daughters will be the same as you, but they will be growing up with their condition and will have near perfect control as a result, way more then you will ever have, and the boys will inherit this as a recessive gene that only appears in all daughters they or their descendants may have, after giving birth there will be a roughly 7 month period where you wont go into heat, or have your period.&quot;<br />
<br />
So she has to be pregnant if she doesn&#39;t want to deal with the Heat (and her period!) every month... and random boys will be asking her for bareback quickies if she isn&#39;t careful when she&#39;s in heat, at least the babies wont be a problem, her family is Rich, she&#39;s the heir to the family fortune and estates, and she did want to have a big family, even if she didn&#39;t think it would be as big as she&#39;s suspecting it&#39;ll be getting, and she&#39;s sure she can deal with a few years of having to deal with her heat, so she doesn&#39;t end up a teenage mom, her mother would be devastated<br />
<br />
unaware of Jen&#39;s thoughts, Kyle continued &quot;and Finally we get to your limbs, you wont be growing a tail or anything like that, you&#39;ll still be human, but this will include the rest of the physical changes for you: first of all, your feet. they&#39;ll elongate a bit, making it easier to stand and walk digitgrade with them, but you&#39;ll be able to walk like a normal human no problem with a little effort, though I believe Heels will be a lot more easy for you to walk around in now, in addition the balls of your feet and toes will develop paw pads, allowing you to walk around barefoot unimpeded when walking. your skeleton will also change, walking upright as normal humans do is still perfectly possible but doing so will feel off, as from now on, moving and standing on all fours is much more comfortable, to help with this, you arms will be a little longer, and your legs will be a bit shorter, and like with your feet, the palm of your hands and your fingers will also develop paw pads. looking up, or forwards when on all fours, will feel perfectly normal to help with this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Walking on all fours... she didnt look forward to that but from the sound if it she&#39;ll be perfectly to walk upright and do anything required if her if she needs to. and the changes to her proportions mean&#39;s shell have an excuse to go shopping for a new wardrobe, positive thinking right?<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, the dare is a lot simpler, I wont have to forbid you from trying to reverse the curse, it wouldn&#39;t be that much of a curse otherwise, and believe me, I tried, Transform or Dare can only add to previous curses, not undo what has been done unless reversal is explicitly part of the original curse.&quot; Kyle said, sounding surprisingly bitter at the end there &quot;The dare is as follows, you&#39;ll totally forget who it was that called you, you&#39;ll remember that you got the curse and what its effects were but you&#39;ll totally forget it was me, in addition your changes will not result in you, or your descendants becoming a science experiment unless you or your descendants actively consent, and finally you will spend the next 3 months fully embracing your doggy changes whenever you have free time from school, hanging out with friends, or other commitments, this will feel like your own choice but you will still know it is part of the dare, at the end of these three months, you will be free to do whatever, i mostly want you to form your own opinion on the effects&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know this is rather kind, but i want you to live with being different not make your life hell, after all, the curse made me &#39;different&#39; too, and that resulted in you pantsing me, so I hope these changes will give you a new perspective. Goodbye&quot; and with that Kyle hung up the phone and the changes began<br />
<br />
It was surprisingly anticlimactic, her feet lengthening, her bones and limbs adjusting to make quadrupedal walking possible, a slight tingle in her belly and groin, her tongue changing, and a whole new world of smells and sounds appearing as her senses grow sharper. the knowledge of who cursed her faded, even as all the things they said about the curse remained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello? test, 1, 2, 3, test &quot; Jen said experimentally<br />
&quot;huh it does take a little more effort&quot; she said before trying out the dog part of her new vocal chords.<br />
&quot;Bark! Bark! Grr! Bark!&quot; yep, that sounds like a dog barking, that&#39;s what she&#39;ll sound like if she isn&#39;t careful, at least suppressing it isnt too hard but she knew that it is still a conscious thing, and if she wasn&#39;t careful she might accidentally make dog noises instead of greeting someone if she wasn&#39;t paying attention.<br />
<br />
Experimentally, Jen walked a little on all fours, noting how easy it felt, got up on 2 and took a few steps, it was just as easy, but it did feel off, like she wasn&#39;t supposed to walk like this. satisfied she ignored the feeling. put on her last sock, before deciding to pull both off because of her changed feet and walking downstairs barefoot, experimentally switching to a digit-grade walking stance and noting that the the very slightly nagging feeling got a lot quieter, even it it didn&#39;t completely go away.<br />
<br />
and with that, it was time to go to school</p>
