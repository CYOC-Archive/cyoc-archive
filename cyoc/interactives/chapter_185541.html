<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Apologies to Marv for the doubling up on chapters. I got another bizarre idea and just had to do it.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Aliens tended to be a bit outside of what Sofia and Rhonda usually dealt with; magical bullshit of all shapes and sizes was their normal schtick, interspersed with the occasional dive into weird superscience crap. Still, it had come up once or twice, and in particular the Valkarians had encountered the duo very briefly. They had been... intense. And... she wouldn&#39;t lie, an entire race of matriarchal lizard women, who for some reason still had had a humanoid structure, breasts, and long manes of hair to go with the tails and scales and claws... they&#39;d been kind of hot. Their imperial princess especially, but... the duo had been whisked back to Earth before she could steal a kiss.<br />
<br />
Life tended to clamjam Rhonda a lot in that way. Thank goodness St. Chariot&#39;s had seen a reversal of that fortune.<br />
<br />
Regardless. &quot;The halls go pretty high. We can probably fly over them.&quot; She flapped her wings experimentally. <br />
<br />
&quot;Rhonda, they have laser stun guns.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll just have to fly really fast then.&quot; She shrugged with all four arms. &quot;Either way, we&#39;re gonna have to make a run for it at some point. I&#39;ve lived through enough horror-movie-worthy plots to know that sticking around here and waiting for them to bust in is a quick way to get raptor-napped.&quot; She would go on calling them raptors so long as she lived, damnit.<br />
<br />
May&#39;s jaw shifted uneasily as she considered Rhonda&#39;s words. &quot;I guess so...&quot; As she stepped closer to the door, the doll-dragon paused, as it contemplating something. &quot;Are we talking like... prestige horror, or...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;2006 cable channel original movie horror.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That... that could not get any worse, could it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Starring a C-Tier wrestler.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yup, it can get worse.&quot; She sighed. &quot;Hey, at least we&#39;re, what... a network romantic that gets at least three seasons?&quot; The joke earned a giggle out of Rhonda.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh for sure - but not one of the big three,&quot; the latina agreed as she took the other girl&#39;s hand and carefully opened the door, peeking out to ensure the way was clear before they began to tiptoe out into the halls. &quot;One of those leechy knock-on networks that hosts all the genre shows that the big three are too pretentious to put on the air.&quot;<br />
<br />
In between scanning their surroundings for signs of trouble, May considered the comparison. &quot;Mmmm... I can live with that,&quot; she whispered back, gently squeezing the dragon-girl&#39;s hand.<br />
<br />
For a time, it seemed like they might have lucked out. There was the occasional clack of sharp claws against metal and tile floors, even a few moments where the two of them had to duck against a wall as they heard a patrol of Valkarians nearby. But before long, they had stumbled their way out of the area and back into the residential wing, fumbling in the dark towards their rooms. Chances were good that it&#39;d still be too much of a risk to go back to their own dorms, instead needing to shack up in the same place once they reached a safe spot, but neither girl was feeling especially opposed to this.<br />
<br />
Just as they were nearing that point, though, life remembered its insatiable need for clamjamming.<br />
<br />
They struck out of nowhere, practically, dashing up from the darkness to grab the two girls. May was ripped out of her hands before she could hope to do anything - and despite how much she thrashed and squirmed as reptilian hands grabbed her, Rhonda couldn&#39;t manage to break free. Tears were about to fall into her draconic eyes as she pondered whether this might finally be the time she&#39;d screwed up beyond what she could escape from.<br />
<br />
By no means did she expect help, and neither did the Valkarians expect it - which was why <i>everyone</i> was caught off guard by a bolt of magical lightning striking the wall near her captors. The hissing reptiles staggered back as another, and yet another, and another bolt came searing their way, the flashes lighting the darkness enough for Rhonda to scramble over towards May. She had just gotten the girl back on her feet when they were beckoned by a familiar female voice - she glanced up amidst the flashes to see a certain kitsune slinging electricity with her wand while yelling for them to get over there.<br />
<br />
Not like they had to be told twice. The draconic girls scrambled like crazy as Amelia fell back, still letting off a weakeing array of lightning bolts to help cover their retreat. At the end of the hall, a bedroom door was open, and all three dashed inside, the door just barely slamming shut in time to keep any Valkarians from following them. Clicks could be heard as they stalked outside the door, but the aliens knew they weren&#39;t permitted inside dorms; until the sun rose, Rhond and May would be safe in here.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hollllllly shit thank you,&quot; the latina muttered as she panted heavily, looking up at her savior giving them a thumbs up. The foxy girl seemed to be quite confident in her fur now - it was nice to see. She glanced around to see who else was sharing the dorm with them... and was left taken slightly aback as she looked over the little collection of young women who, she guessed, were Amelia&#39;s roommates.<br />
<br />
None of them were human, for one. &quot;Rhonda, these are my dormmates,&quot; Amelia said, motioning to each girl in turn to provide an introduction. <br />
<br />
First, a young blonde in a cowgirl hat, human from the waste up - and drider from the waist down. &quot;Howdy,&quot; she greeted them in a distinctly Texan accent - Rhonda instantly worried about getting insulted by some crazy hick, but nothing was further from the case. &quot;I&#39;m Sarah. Real fine to meey y&#39;all!&quot;<br />
<br />
Next, was a girl who Rhonda actually recognized from when Amelia had cast the spell that caused her second seat of breasts to appear. Less recognizable was the thirty or so further pairs running down her snakelike body, progressively getting smaller towards the tip of her tail. &quot;Megan,&quot; she introduced herself quietly, letting the endless trail of mammaries do most of the talking.<br />
<br />
Finally, there was the last girl, this one ebony-skinned with equally dark hair, her pigmentation contrasted by the bright blue scales of her mermaid tail. &quot;Keisha.&quot; She adjusted her glasses sheepishly, seemingly a bit more nervous than her friends. Not being able to get around as easily as even the titty-snake girl probably had something to do with that.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re lucky - my and my friends were actually keeping an eye on you,&quot; Amelia explained as she stepped over and stood with her dormmates, getting especially close to Megan - it was obvious to anyone that their relationship had improved far, far beyond their exchange of transformations on the first day here. &quot;Rhonda, you remember that talk we had? About how you&#39;re... kind of inspiring?&quot;<br />
<br />
The latina nodded, and quickly May took her had and squeezed, almost as if to mark her territory as she realized the kind of looks that her crush was getting. Rhonda would, of course, not even think of so much as a flirty remark with another girl in front of May - but she wasn&#39;t about to complain about the attention. &quot;Well, me and my friends, we... we had an idea. Okay, it was mostly Keisha&#39;s idea...&quot; She gestured to the mermaid.<br />
<br />
&quot;You were already the talk of the school <i>before</i> your friends all became dragon-morphs,&quot; she began explaining, scratching her head anxiously. &quot;Now that you and those other girls are all dragons, though, we realized something about the transformations we&#39;ve all gotten stuck with...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There ain&#39;t no rules sayin&#39; we can&#39;t double down on transformations!&quot; Sarah explained, rubbing her frontmost spider legs together. &quot;So we reckoned, wouldn&#39;t it be the darn coolest if added some&#39;a that dragon stuff to our own bodies!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We want to be dragon-hybrids too,&quot; Megan translated from redneck to english. &quot;We wanted to ask you to change us, and combine our nonhuman features with draconic ones, just like you did for May, Abigail, and Sofia. It&#39;d mean a lot to us...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you&#39;d have the beginnings of the most awesome clique in St. Chariot&#39;s history,&quot; Amelia finished.<br />
<br />
Once again, Rhonda felt like her head was spinning. She wouldn&#39;t even deny being turned on by the idea of creating an entire gang of draconic-style girls... not to mention that their gratitude could be a great way to start garnering support for her political ambitions. There was just one very slight problem: they were all looking at her, expecting the latina to pop up and start casting spells. Even May seemed to kind of have an expectant look on her face. Worse yet, she had no idea where Sofia was, and her best friend wouldn&#39;t be able to get here through the valkarians outside. <br />
<br />
For the billionth time in her life, Rhonda wondered how the <i>fuck</i> she ended up in these situations.</p>
