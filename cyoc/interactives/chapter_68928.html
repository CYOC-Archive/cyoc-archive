<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Just then a knock at the door sounded. “Millie, you in there?” came a gruff voice. It was Scott, the captain of the basketball team. Rumor had it that he and Millie had been going a lot more than steady since before high school but no one could prove anything. Indeed whenever either was asked about it they simply smiled and walked away, knowing that rumors of their sexual prowess were not necessarily a bad thing.<br />
<br />
Zoe had once walked in on them in the gym store cupboard, but far from being embarrassed or screaming, Millie had invited Zoe to join them, and Scott had offered no objection. This gave her a great idea. Zoe quickly grabbed a couple of jump ropes that had been tossed to one side and headed over to Millie. “Payback time” she said as she proceeded to disrobe the paralyzed figure. Shortly afterwards the soccer uniform was gone leaving Millie in absolutely nothing whatsoever. Zoe grabbed the jump ropes and tied one to each limb, pulling Millie down onto her knees and to the end of the bench as she did so. Jess was begging to catch on and soon Millie was tied down properly. Her ass was one end of the bench with her legs and knees resting on their floor and tied securely, whilst her arms were outreached in front of her, secure to the other end of the bench. The gave her a quick slap across the ass for good measure, leaving a rosy hand print exposed for all the world to see, before Zoe grabbed the Chronivac from the side and rushed to the door. Not before quickly tapping the unfreeze button.<br />
<br />
Millie instantly flailed; pulling hers arms and legs in desperately to test the ropes. No use, she was stuck. She squirmed and pulled as Jess watched her futile shake her ass from behind. “Let me go you bitch!” She shouted, but Jess simply grinned with the same evil that Millie had shown her before. “All’s fair in love and war” She laughed as Millie continued against her restraints. A bark from behind her caused her to freeze, and an icy chill ran up her spine. She turned her head to see Zoe, Chronivac in one hand, and with the other she was holding the scruffy neck of a large black Labrador. It woofed and barked confused but also excited. <br />
<br />
“Paybacks a bitch” Zoe said before helping the dog to raise its paws onto Millie’s back. She panicked, frantically shifting as much as she could but it was no use. “Go on Scott” Zoe coaxed and before long the full horror of what was happening to her hit her. Scott seemingly needed very little encouragement, true to his past nature and Millie felt his hardening cock press up against her moist fold.<br />
<br />
“Look” Jess laughed pointing down at Millie, “The bitch is getting aroused by this”<br />
<br />
“You Cunts! Stop This! Please!” She screamed as Scott continued to poke at her.<br />
<br />
“Too late” Zoe laughed, “You had your chance” and with that gave Scott a final pat on the back.<br />
<br />
Millie screamed out loud as Scotts canine cock slid into her. She didn’t want this to be happening, she wanted to make them suffer but she couldn’t take it herself. She felt the dog begin to pound in and out of her and her breasts rubbed against the metal surface of the bench, it cold hard touch exciting her nipples and increasing her arousal. She didn’t want to be aroused, she wanted the nightmare to end, but as Scott kept pounding in and out of her snatch, she knew there was no way to stop it now. She was completely at Jess and Zoe’s mercy.<br />
<br />
The two on lookers laughed and truth be told, got a little aroused themselves. Millie desperately tried to imagine that it was Scott in his normal basketball star form that was penetrating her, but the feeling was so alien to her, and the paws digging into her back, the fur brushing up against her ass, all told brought her desperate fantasy crashing back down. Worst of all, she could feel the climax approaching.<br />
<br />
In Scotts mind, he knew what he was doing. He didn’t understand and part of him wanted to stop, but he was fucking his girlfriend doggy style, and okay the situation was a bit odd but he’d had stranger dreams. After all this had to be a dream, right? There’s no other reason that he could be having sex with Millie as a dog. Yeah, why not just go ahead and enjoy it, he might as well.<br />
<br />
Millie could feel it, every inch of her ovaries was tightening around Scotts ever expanding cock. She was on the edge, and whilst her whole body pulsed with the ever nearing orgasm, she fought it all the way. She didn’t want to orgasm from being fucked by a dog, it was sick and wrong, but deep in the back of her mind, a little voice was egging her on. She’d made Jess and Zoe do it? She’d forced them to do exactly what she was experiencing; she must have had a reason? Maybe she enjoyed it? Maybe it aroused her? It certainly felt very good now. The corrupting voice got louder in her mind as her orgasm approached. It was nearly on top of her. Every thrust, every deep penetration into her woman hood, ever pulse of the erect canine member in her as expanded, she could feel them all. They were pushing, growing, tipping her and then she exploded. She squealed in ecstasy as Scott planted his canine seed and she reciprocated. She arched her back and let their juices mingled as she convulsed. Over and Over the waves of pleasure washed over her and she screamed with the glory of the moment. It was over. She’d done it. She’d came to a dog fucking her, and secretly, the thought turned her on.<br />
<br />
Zoe and Jess were helpless as there revenge was exacted. Zoe laughed into Jess’s shoulder as she watched Scott wriggle to pull himself out. He couldn’t and Millie’s face lit up with horror as she realized that she could conceivably be stuck like this for some time. The humiliating position of having a spent dogs penis stuck in you as you lay naked in the locker room, unable to move.<br />
<br />
Zoe whispered into Jess’ ear and handed her the Chronivac. “We’ll be off now, but it would a crime to separate you two lovebirds” she announced and pointed the Chronivac at them both. “Consider this a parting gift. Enjoy your new life BITCH!”</p>
