<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Eliana Hoti and her daughter, Rebecca, were trying hard not to laugh at the moment looking at both Lilith Kane and her daughter Alyssa Kane who were in their Solar Guardian forms and trying hard not to respond the way they usually do to a familiar answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on girls it&#39;s easy, just tell me who you are.&quot; Eliana smirked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No come on Miss Kane, Ally, you two can do this, just say your regular names.&quot; Rebecca encouraged the two as they looked like their mouths were ready to burst.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, I know how to win this bet. Help! Are there any heroes who can possibly save me?&quot; Eliana pretended to call out as Lilith and Alyssa finally broke.<br />
<br />
&quot;FEAR NOT MA&#39;AM, I SOLAR GUARDIAN PLUTO,&quot; Lilith cried out &quot;AND I SOLAR GUARDIAN SATURN,&quot; Alyssa cried out afterwards. &quot;WILL SAVE YOU TOGETHER!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck, damn it Eliana, that was cold dirty cheating.&quot; Lilith grumbled as she changed back to her normal older form.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, is this really the only uniforms the Solar Guardians wear?&quot;  Alyssa asked looking at her outfit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Unfortunately baby girl, it is. So Eliana, you won the bet by cheating, but we did break, so I&#39;ll fix dinner tonight then.&quot; Lilith sighed as she patted Eliana&#39;s shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright girls, let&#39;s get back to it!&quot; Eliana said enthusiastically as the girls groaned at the work before them.<br />
<br />
Alyssa Kane couldn&#39;t have asked for a nicer day to relax, but unfortunately there wasn&#39;t any time to relax at the moment. It had been several days since Dark Garden had attacked the house and destroyed a lot of the front of the house where the front window had once been. Alyssa was glad for one thing in her life: her mother was alive and well again. They had gotten a letter from someone that only read: &#39;Welcome back to the living, I&#39;ve helped set you back on life. Enjoy your second chance.&#39; It was only signed &#39;Life&#39; at the bottom.<br />
<br />
Alyssa and Rebecca were now picking up the remains of what used to be the living room wall, as well as any remaining glass from the floor that had been smashed into. Alyssa accidentally tried picking up a piece of glass and cut her finger making it bleed a little. Rebecca watched and found it cute as Lilith came over to check on Alyssa&#39;s finger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Doesn&#39;t look too bad, but I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve had worse scrapes, come on, I&#39;ll help you get it cleaned and put a band aid on it.&quot; Lilith told Alyssa as they went to get all the stuff for her finger. Alyssa wanted to say she didn&#39;t need her mom&#39;s help with the band-aid, but decided against it as she wanted to experience all the worst, best, and embarrassing moments she could with her mom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay yeah, we should have some in the bathroom cabinet in the next room.&quot; Alyssa informed her mom as they made their way over to the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Eliana was sweeping all of the dirt and rubble away from the living room and back outside into the dirt as Rebecca came over to talk to her mom.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, you and Ally&#39;s mom talked the other night about her living conditions?&quot; Rebecca asked her mom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course she is. You know, she cried when I talked to her too. She was so thankful to me for being there for Alyssa all these years. But her coming here was a true godsend for us.&quot; Eliana said with a smile. Rebecca raised her eyebrow at her mom&#39;s statement.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean? You&#39;ve been doing great raising me and Ally, I couldn&#39;t ask for a better mom.&quot; Rebecca said hugging her mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re very sweet Rebecca, but I mean, Lilith couldn&#39;t have at a better time into our lives because....I&#39;ve been struggling with the payments Rebecca.&quot; Elia admitted.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Oh, mom, why didn&#39;t you say so? Ally and I could have,&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re both 14, you&#39;re still minors in the workplace. You can&#39;t exactly get high paying jobs at your ages.&quot; Eliana argued with her daughter. Rebecca wanted to retort, but knew it was pointless as her mother had a point.<br />
<br />
&quot;So is she going to be working with you then?&quot; Rebecca asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course she is, I put in a good word with my manager for her. This time next week she&#39;ll be working alongside me. Speaking of work, let&#39;s get back to it.&quot; Eliana said as she moved brought her daughter back over to the hole in the wall.<br />
<br />
While Eliana and Rebecca had been talking to each other, Lilith and Ally were talking to each other at the same time in the bathroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;What was the worst injury you ever had?&quot; Lilith asked Ally as she helped clean the wound on her finger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...probably when I was 10, I fell down off my bike and planted my hands on the concrete seriously scraping them. It took a while for them to heal back up, but luckily Eliana helped me clean it up pretty well.&quot; Alyssa explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s been a good caretaker for you then? I&#39;m glad to hear it. I wish Luca could&#39;ve....never mind, I&#39;m sorry. It&#39;s just a little too sad to talk about.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well let&#39;s not talk about....where he is now, why don&#39;t you tell me the kind of person he was like. Eliana doesn&#39;t talk about him too much cause it&#39;s kind of sad for her.&quot; Ally suggested.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well let&#39;s see, he was a damn fine drummer, a pretty good mercenary for hire, and just like your mom didn&#39;t take shit from no one. He once said that he&#39;d ripped Annie Pendragon&#39;s arms off if she broke my heart.&quot; Lilith laughed then caught herself. She hadn&#39;t thought of Annie in a long time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god, I...I hadn&#39;t thought of Annie, she...she doesn&#39;t know I&#39;m....&quot; Lilith said cupping her mouth trying not to cry.<br />
<br />
&quot;We...we...we could call her mom, she&#39;ll be happy to see that you&#39;re...&quot; Alyssa tried to say before her mother interrupted her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alyssa I can&#39;t see her right now because....because she was the one who saw me die in front her own eyes.&quot; Lilith said trying to keep from crying.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh mom, I&#39;m so sorry. Can....can you tell me how it happened? I...I promise I can handle it, I&#39;m strong, like you.&quot; Alyssa encouraged Lilith holding her mother&#39;s hands.<br />
<br />
Lilith took a deep breath and tried to keep herself from crying, but a single tear did fall from her eye.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m too lucky to have you as my daughter. It was around 2027, you...you would&#39;ve been just barely a couple of months old. I had tried to ask Annie to take care of you, but she said it would&#39;ve been too hard as she&#39;d only think of me whenever she saw you. So I decided to leave you with Luca and Eliana. I didn&#39;t want to spend my last day on Earth in a hospital bed, so I asked Annie to drive us to the beach and she obliged.&quot; Lilith said while looking sad.<br />
<br />
&quot;What...what did you do when you got there?&quot; Alyssa asked as she gulped her throat trying to keep from crying.<br />
<br />
&quot;We spoke of how we met, how we both changed each others lives, how....how we wanted to live with each other the rest of our lives. I wanted the two of us to raise you, see you do all the things babies do. We shared our final kiss on the beach and watched the sunset. After that, it was just nothing. Has....has she ever tried to contact you?&quot; Lilith asked her daughter.<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s sent me birthday cards from the same address every year, but she&#39;s never called or visited. I think she&#39;s just been too sad to visit like you said. Maybe...maybe I can help you two get back in touch?&quot; Alyssa asked encouragingly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, no...sweety I...I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a good idea.&quot; Lilith said shaking her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, please, I&#39;m asking you don&#39;t wallow in misery. I want you to live again, I want you to be happy again. Please mom, tell me you&#39;ll reconsider meeting her?&quot; Alyssa encouraged holding her mother&#39;s hands tightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I&#39;ll try, that&#39;s my promise to you.&quot; Lilith said as Alyssa wrapped her arms around her mother and Lilith hugged her back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway, let&#39;s go and see how Eliana and Rebecca are doing.&quot; Lilith said patting her daughter on the shoulder.<br />
<br />
Lilith, Eliana, Rebecca, and Ally now stood in the living room looking at the hole in the wall.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay ladies, we got the rubble cleaned out and all the glass off the floor as well. Now, does anyone know how to fix a hole like this?&quot; Lilith asked as she looked at the three of them with unsure faces.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know good contractor in town that owes me a favor or two. He&#39;ll be happy to help with this, we just have to tell him....a bear did it?&quot; Eliana suggested.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bear did it.&quot; The other three agreed.<br />
<br />
&quot;When my payment comes, I&#39;ll give you my money to help you pay for it.&quot; Lilith said as Eliana nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, between the two of you, do you have any crushes yet on anyone?&quot; Lilith asked with a smirk and her arms on Rebecca and Alyssa&#39;s shoulders.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, mom, come on...&quot; Alyssa groaned and blushed at the same time as they began to tell her about some classmates of theirs at school who they were just friends with.</p>
