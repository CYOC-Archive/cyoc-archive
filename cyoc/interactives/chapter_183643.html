<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The four French adult entertainment stars that had come to Lyre/Animalia had done there best to stay up to date on the various issues that related to the plans that were there for the colony in France at Juliet Renard-Argenté&#39;s chateau and vineyard, along with the various rules and expectations that would go along with the conversions that were to come. This was a complicating factor as there had been a host of rumors that then came out of Juliet&#39;s chateau being the source of a new colony, and for Chablis, the leader of the four, this was the biggest things that was being thought over. Of course there was also some of the other things that related to the other three.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, the club will not be called Juliet&#39;s Folly,&quot; Chablis said to Abella as the four of them sat in one of the hotel rooms in Lyre. <br />
<br />
The room was fairly spacious and accommodated them all fairly well. It made for a good meeting place for them and away from the eyes of people in the area. While the four of them were not unused to attracting attention, as adult entertainment was one of those things that remained relatively active, regardless of the country, and France had some more openness with regard to that entertainment, at least so far as American tourists knew with regard to things like the &quot;Can-Can,&quot; that didn&#39;t mean that they wanted everything being that public. The hotel room was safe enough to let them talk over things that would relate to what would be expected and to converse in their own language. They had a working knowledge of English, which was more than what most Americans knew of French, but in the privacy of their own room they could converse in their language, even if certain subjects came up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh come now,&quot; Abella answered with a pout, &quot;Miss High and Mighty deserves some reminder of things. I mean... just about every Animalian enjoys sex and drawing some attention. And she doesn&#39;t want that attention.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Animalians may be more open when it comes to things like sex and lust,&quot; Chablis answered, &quot;but you do note that MOST Animalians in Lyre/Animalia do not work at the Meat Market, and most of the stories relate more to lovers looking for their romantic partners and nothing more. I would wager that a good bit of that was some of Ms. Renard-Argenté&#39;s motivations. And being something of a mother figure for those she&#39;d taken into her care would be part of that. I would think she&#39;s had enough embarrassment on the issue.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And she did agree to allow for the club to be established,&quot; Vere added, &quot;so there wouldn&#39;t be that much reason to go overboard with it. Particularly as the government did back down enough that Ms. Renard-Argenté still owns the property. The last thing we need is to provoke an all out brawl.&quot;<br />
<br />
That got Abella to back down on her point as she had to accept that. None of them could fully identify the reasons for it, but the French government when they accepted the idea of the Renard-Argenté Chateau becoming a new Animalian colony added the idea of establishing a club that would function much like the Meat Market did in Lyre. It earned frustration from the owner of the chateau and something was only tolerated and accepted when the government agreed not to not force those that had been under Juliet&#39;s care into working at the club and that there would be no brothel on the colony grounds, which was actually in line with every Animalian colony. Animalia had places like the Meat Market, but they did not prostitute their people out to anyone that would pay. Thus with the club allowed for, the four of them did agree not to truly press on that, even if Abella was a bit too interested in ideas that would effectively remind Juliet of what it had taken to get her to accept allowing the club in the first place.<br />
<br />
&quot;It might be best to think more on what Animalians we&#39;ll become,&quot; Dezirae commented, &quot;the government has left that pretty open and Juliet hasn&#39;t given any major restrictions on what Animalian we&#39;d become. The only thing she&#39;s requested is some awareness on what we choose in order make sure that any and all furniture would be made to accommodate us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which would be a good idea,&quot; Chablis commented, &quot;and it should a point to make sure that there will be an appropriate amount of color and balance between Mammals, Fish, Reptiles, Amphibians, or Birds. That way the show is even and can appeal to all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Unless someone wants to be a Dinotopian,&quot; Abella commented while rolling her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that may not be off the table,&quot; Chablis patted Abella&#39;s shoulder, &quot;but given the fact that this chateau was built well before even the Republic was a dream, it&#39;d have to be one of the smaller Dinosaurs or Pterosaurs.&quot;<br />
<br />
Everyone had nodded, as this was all something that they expected. None of them had looked into any of the large modern megafauna as part of their research on what Animalians to become because of the size that Elephants, Rhinoceros, and Hippopotamus reached. An old chateau would likely have some major size limitations, regardless of how well the chateau was maintained over the years. Other than size restrictions they had agreed that no one would become the same kind of Animalian, in order to preserve some individuality and make the shows better. There was also the restriction against any Snake Animalians, as one couldn&#39;t do the &quot;Can-Can&quot; if they didn&#39;t have legs. They&#39;d had a fair number of these sorts of meetings that had looked over each animal&#39;s instinctive behaviors and what would be expected from them. It had also lead to all sorts of guidebooks and items being bought, which proved to be helpful.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I think have a choice on what I&#39;d like to be,&quot; Dezirae spoke up drawing eyes to her. &quot;I was thinking on the Budgerigar and specifically the blue mutation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A Blue Budgie!&quot; Abella smiled, &quot;I bet you&#39;d look cute.&quot;<br />
<br />
That earned a few nods of agreement.<br />
<br />
&quot;So that would take birds off the list,&quot; Chablis nodded, &quot;anyone else have a choice?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was thinking... what about the Fallow Deer,&quot; Vere commented, &quot;Most of the most colorful animals often come from places in the tropics, which is nice... but a the Fallow Deer are native to Europe and the adults will keep their spots. Wouldn&#39;t that be something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It would be, and would take mammals off the list,&quot; Chablis nodded and then looked over to Abella, who&#39;d picked up a tablet and was scrolling through something.<br />
<br />
Because of agreements that had been made earlier, they all had their list of alternatives to pick from in case one or more picked from a specific animal. It assured that everyone had some option, regardless of what kind of Animalian to become. After a few moments, Abella lifted up the tablet to show Chablis the picture. It showed a largely orangish colored fish that had white stripes that went up and down its body, and two stripes that ran along the tail. There was a sort of black band that ran diagonally across a set of silver-white eyes near the top of the head, and to top it all off, the fish had spines just about everywhere that shared the orange and white coloration.<br />
<br />
&quot;They say it&#39;s the Clearfin Lionfish,&quot; Abella pointed to the picture, &quot;I bet I could do something flashy with the spines...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Or sting someone,&quot; Chablis pointed out, &quot;they are venomous.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, if Ms. Renard-Argenté is concerned about overly aggressive men, it might be good to pack a bit of extra punch, if you know what I mean,&quot; Abella commented. This earned some nods from the others which then brought all attention to Chablis, who hadn&#39;t voiced her choice, yet.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose you&#39;re all curious,&quot; Chablis chuckled, &quot;well... I&#39;d think I&#39;d gotten a bit lucky, for while looking through these various animals, I came across a species of Poison Dart Frog that looked rather interesting. It still has all the black stripes and spots that Poison Dart Frogs have, but its head and back is a bright red-orange, it&#39;s sides is more of a yellowish color, and its arms and legs are blue. I couldn&#39;t find a common name for it, but the scientific name is Ranitomeya Amazonica. The articles I&#39;ve found says that they don&#39;t know how many are there, which means it&#39;s probably a new species... and so I&#39;d probably have to wait for scientists to go into sections of South America where it&#39;s been found... confirmed to be in parts of Peru and Columbia... or if other scientists already have genetic samples of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds like it would be all colors of the rainbow,&quot; Dezirae commented, &quot;maybe that&#39;s what it&#39;s name is...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I checked,&quot; Chablis commented, &quot;and no, that&#39;s not its common name. There is a frog that has a name like that, but it&#39;s a rare frog from Madagascar.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you apparently had the defense idea too,&quot; Abella laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wasn&#39;t planning on making poison darts,&quot; Chablis answered, &quot;I just liked the coloring... and make the can-can even more interesting. As it would literally be a frog&#39;s leg&#39;s garnering the attention.&quot;<br />
<br />
The others then laughed at that.</p>
