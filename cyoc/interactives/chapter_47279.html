<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Hey guys,&quot; Brian-Nick said, &quot;Kevin and Dean aren't here!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ya, I know.&quot; Luke sighed, &quot;If something happens to them, or someone else spots them, this could all end very badly for us!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck are we going to do?!&quot; Max looked like he was starting to panic.<br />
<br />
&quot;Easy Max, easy.  We'll all just have to split up to look for them.&quot; Luke patted Max on the back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...&quot; Brian-Nick groaned, &quot;But we haven't even been like this for very long...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry.&quot;  Luke laughed, &quot;None of us have been stuck together for long.&quot;  Luke and Max looked at each other an smiled, &quot;Now let's get you to apart!  Can't have someone seeing you like that.&quot;  Luke and Max grabbed onto the arms of Brian-Nick and yanked them apart;  It took two or three tries before they were successful.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, you three look around the lake and trails, I'm gonna get my car and see if they've ran off down the road, ok?&quot; Luke looked around at the other three, as they all nodded, &quot;Meet up at the parking lot in half an hour.  Let's go&quot;  With that, all four of them exited the gym as quietly as they entered; Each took off running in a different direction to find Kevin and Dean.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Luke was out of breath after sprinting to his car, he was searching through his pockets for the keys when he heard some rustling a few meters away in the trees.  He walked a bit closer to the noise to see if it might be Dean and Kevin, and he was pretty sure it sounded like the two of them were still arguing.  Once he was close enough, Luke could was sure, and could make out their conversation. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck! Stop moving my fucking leg you asshole!&quot; Kevin growled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Piss off! It's not your fucking leg, its MY fucking leg.  And I'LL do with it what I want!&quot;  Dean argued back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not if I have anything to say about it, you're stuck to MY body!&quot; It sounded like Kevin had punched Dean again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck you dude, you're stuck to mine!&quot; Dean gave Kevin a few quick jabs to the stomach, &quot;And if I want to keep walking, than YOU will just have to come with ME!&quot;<br />
<br />
Luke poked his head out around the tree he was hiding behind, doing his best not to laugh.  Once again, the two of them were beating on each other rolling across the ground, and trying to rip each others heads off.  Dean had struggled to get up and was trying to walk away, but being physically attached to Kevin, cause him to stand up too and slam Dean's side into a tree.<br />
<br />
Dean shoved Kevin across the little path, and smashed him into the tree Luke was behind.  Luke could feel the impact of their body slamming into the cedar.  He let out a loud gasping laugh, then instantly covered his mouth.  Kevin and Dean had gone completely silent and had stopped thrashing around.<br />
<br />
&quot;I swear to god I just heard that little shit Luke...&quot; Kevin had turned to Dean.<br />
<br />
&quot;That fucker is the one who did this to us!&quot; Dean cranked his neck to look at Kevin, &quot;You know that right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ya!&quot; Kevin nodded, &quot;Wish I could get my hands on him.  I'd ring his little fucking neck for doing this to me!&quot;  Luke was feeling a little frightened, he had actually managed to piss off two of the meanest guys in school.  He turned around and started slowly walking back to his car, not making a sound.  Not until he slipped on a rock and yelped out in pain.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Get him!&quot;<br />
<br />
Luke's head darted around to see Kevin and Dean lunging towards him.  He jumped up and ran as fast as he could to his car, with the other two close on his heels.  Luke fumbled around with his keys trying to unlock the door, but before he knew it, he was falling to the ground as Kevin and Dean tackled him.<br />
<br />
The next couple seconds were a blur.  Luke felt himself being beaten all over as he lay curled in a tight ball, but the beating had stopped as fast as it had begun.  Luke felt himself begin lifted off the ground as he heard shouting going on all around him.  He opened his eyes and saw a blurry image of Kevin and Dean being held back by someone, when he looked to his sides, he saw Brian and Nick holding him up with his arms around their shoulders.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... guys?&quot; Luke's head was still spinning.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey man, it's ok, we're here now!  We're not gonna let those fucking jerks hurt you!&quot;  Brian was glaring at Kevin and dean.  Luke followed his gaze, and saw that Max had delivered a solid punch to Kevin-Dean's middle section, sending them to the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;Luke?!&quot; Max came rushing over to his friend, &quot;Are you all right?! Are you ok?! I swear... if they broke anything I'm gonna beat the...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm ok! I'm ok...&quot; Luke was looking at Max, fighting back tears.  Max could tell, so he stepped forward and gave Luke a hug.  Luke let go of Brian and Nick and returned the favor, and whispered, &quot;Thank you Max.&quot;<br />
<br />
Max just smiled before turning back around to Kevin and Dean and yelling, &quot;Why the hell were you two attacking my friend?!  We go out looking for you, so we can get you apart, and THIS is how you act!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! He's the one who did this to me!&quot; Kevin screamed as he pushed at Dean's head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ya!&quot; Dean agreed, pushing back at Kevin, &quot;He deserves it! I can't stand being stuck to this fucking ass!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was only a joke!&quot; Max stomped over to them. &quot;It was suppose to teach you a short lesson!  About putting aside your differences and working together!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha! That's not going to happen, no fucking way...&quot; Kevin and Dean were still trying to push the other one's head off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then... The two of you can stay like that until you do...&quot; Max walked back to the car. &quot;Come on guys, lets go.&quot;</p>
