<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The first day was rough, and boring. Jenny would hide under Jeff’s bed most of the day, since the risk of getting caught was too high to try coming out of his room. While Jeff was at school, Jenny figured she would try to crack the password to his computer, but had no luck. When Jeff got home, Jenny expressed how hard it was to live in a tiny room all day. Jeff figured he gave Jenny the short end of the stick, he found it erotic to keep her trapped in his home, but he didn’t want her to be climbing the walls with boredom. He told Jenny he would make a quick edit to make her life easier while she went to the bathroom. <br />
<br />
Jeff scrolled through different solutions to their problem, but finding one was proving to be a challenge. Ideally, Jenny could be sneaky enough to not get caught when she leaves his room, and able to slip into narrow spaces to hide. To make this a fair game, any place that could be a hiding spot, would be a hiding spot. <br />
<br />
Then he found the perfect option, the MALLEABLE PACKAGE. Take something with a rigid shape and bend it to your will. -Warning- use on the human body can have the effect of making a person slime-like in structure, use at your own risk. With this, Jenny could squeeze, stretch or bend her body any way. Adding a few extra changes to make her instinctually hide when she hears someone, and a few others to make her obey whatever he says, and he had a monster in his home that would always be just out of sight.<br />
<br />
Typing up the changes, he ran them, leaving Jenny to figure out what happened. Sitting on the toilet, Jenny felt a wave wash over her. She knew something changed but couldn’t figure out what. Then, her own weight pulled her through the toilet seat, leaving her stuck with a small yelp. It was weird for her to be pulled through like that, and even more weird to be able to pull herself out with relative ease. She cleaned herself up, and walked over to the door. She was lucky Jeff had a bathroom attached to his bedroom, or she would risk getting caught when she walked between them. Before she could leave, Jeff told her to stop.<br />
<br />
Jenny felt herself tense up, “What is it?”<br />
<br />
“I want you to try squeezing under the door.”<br />
<br />
“What?”<br />
<br />
“Just try it.”<br />
<br />
Jenny did just that. She reached under with her hand and then her whole arm, and it passed through with ease. Her whole body emerged on the other side, but her clothes got stuck at the crack so she appeared naked before Jeff. “What did you do to me?”<br />
<br />
Jeff explained what he did, and what her body could now do. Jenny felt despair wash over her. She wasn’t just forgotten, now she was also a monster. <br />
<br />
-Later that Week-<br />
<br />
Jenny could fit in any space with enough volume. That gave her a lot of opportunities to explore outside Jeff’s room. She gave up wearing clothes after the first day, she just kept stretching out of them. Jenny had now seen every aspect of his family’s routine. She would sneak into his sister’s room and kept herself compressed under the rug. That’s how she found out she started streaming some not-so-safe content to the internet. She also listened in on Jeff’s dad while he was on a call, and found out he was cheating with his secretary, she didn’t tell Jeff about that though.<br />
<br />
While Jenny was sneaking to the kitchen to grab a bite to eat, she was almost caught by Jeff’s mom, but she was able to compress herself under the fridge before she was seen. His mom did get suspicious though. For a few day, she constantly felt like someone was watching her. <br />
<br />
Jeff found it entertaining to hear the stories of all the things she would do while he was at school. But he felt like he was seeing her less and less. She felt more like a ghost that he would only see out of the corner of his eye. After day of only barely seeing her, he figured she needed some change of pace to keep their game moving.<br />
<br />
Accepting life as phrogger in Jeff’s home was something she found surprisingly easy to do. What was a bit harder to accept was Jeff bringing another girl home. It made sense to her, that in a world where she didn’t exist, someone else would have become Jeff’s girlfriend. But hearing Jeff make out with someone from his bed made her heart feel heavy.<br />
<br />
The eroticism, however, was not lost on her. Jenny found a hole in the wall that led up to a crack where she could see Jeff’s room from above. She had to squeeze and compress her body in all sorts of ways so she could spy on him with this new girl. Only from there could she see that this was none other than her old cheerleading rival, Mara. Jenny couldn’t believe that, without her, he would go for that floozy. Still, getting everything taken from her, by her enemy, made Jenny hornier than she probably should have been.<br />
<br />
From her little crack, Jenny squeezed her hand in and out of her vagina, taking special care to not be heard from her spot within the wall. The few inches of space would have made this difficult for a normal person, but Jenny’s new body was built different. From her little cranny, she watched Jeff and Mara, and got off on how lucky she was to be living this kind of life, and all the things she could do in this kind of body.</p>
