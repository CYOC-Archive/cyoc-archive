<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Cory Reynolds woke up with sunshine on his face.<br />
<br />
Somehow he had managed to take his clothes off and get to bed the previous night as he found himself in the comfort of sheets with only his boxer briefs on. He remembered having the biggest headache of his life but luckily he was now feeling better. Still his mind seemed a bit hazy. He tried to recall the previous day but while he could remember some events of that peculiar day, somehow they seemed different right now. Cory couldn't quite put his finger on it.<br />
<br />
Cory yawned and rubbed his eyes. Looking at his alarm clock he could see that it was still early to go to school but he really didn't feel so sleepy so he decided to get up. He lazily walked from his bed and stretched himself. Cory felt energized. He really had needed that long rest, considering all the events from the previous day.<br />
<br />
He went to his closet and took a new pair of underwear and socks. As he looked at the pile of clothes on the floor that was his uniform he saw that they still looked good and so he placed them on top of his bed to wear them for school.<br />
<br />
On the back of his mind he knew he should make his bed and at least iron his uniform but that seemed just boring. Sure his mom would probably bother him with that but Cory didn't really want to think much about it. He wasn't the tidiest person who ever lived, so what? <br />
<br />
He went to the bathroom to take a shower. After relieving his bladder, he looked at the mirror and enjoyed the view. He had felt self-conscious about his looks but now Cory couldn't really understand why. His body wasn't all that bad looking. He could see a six pack forming and all around he could see that his other muscles were becoming more noticeable. They weren't big (after all he didn't go to a gym) but they looked good on him and that made Cory smile.<br />
<br />
His treasure trail cut the abs but that didn't make him worry. There was nothing wrong with growing some hair and there was no way he'd shave it. He looked closely at his chest. He was beginning to have some hair growing there as well, just in the middle of his two small forming pecs. He nodded and smiled. He was growing up, no longer was he just a kid. Soon he would be free to live his own life and that excited him.<br />
<br />
His skin looked good as well. Despite living in England he was proud to have a healthy skin tone without much sun exposure. “Must be genetic or something.” Cory was certainly thankful for that. After all the bright sun could sometimes be annoying, especially because his blue eyes were a bit sensitive.<br />
<br />
He now looked at his beard. It seemed fuller than before. It actually made him look good so he once again was opposed to the idea of shaving it. After all not many guys his age could grow a beard quite like his and even fewer guys could be proud of having hair on their chests. He was growing up faster than others, he reasoned. Though didn’t literally mean he was getting taller. “You just can’t have everything.” He thought without much concern.<br />
<br />
Cory moved a hand through his brown hair. It looked great. His mom really didn't like the size of his hair but to Cory it looked great just the way it was. He could see that it was a bit curly. That was strange. His hair was dark brown but somehow it now looked like a chestnut brown. Cory also felt strange that his hair seemed bigger and curlier than he remembered yesterday. <br />
<br />
Suddenly his headache returned. Cory grabbed the sides of the sink as he his legs feel weak. The sudden pain made him forget about what he was thinking and almost instantly he felt better. &quot;Weird.&quot; was all he thought about that.<br />
<br />
Without delay he brushed his teeth and then went to the shower stall. <br />
<br />
He quickly felt relaxed when the warm water touched him. As he washed his body he felt his penis getting erect. His uncut manhood somehow seemed longer than usual, probably some good 7 inches. He didn't think twice about that, anyway. “The bigger the better”. <br />
<br />
Feeling horny he stroke his cock slowly. It felt fantastic, so much better than usual. His hips went back and forwards as he increased the rhythm. His eyes were closed and a bright smile was stamped on his face. He didn't think about anything specific. He just felt so good, so horny. He felt himself getting nearer and nearer to climax. He was grunting in pure pleasure, feeling ever so close to finishing it. Out of nowhere some pictures flashed on his mind about him smoking pot, feeling so in the zone, free... and then he came harder than ever in his life, white jets of cum splattering on the floor of the stall.<br />
<br />
Cory felt lucky the water was still running. Otherwise maybe his shouts of pleasure could have been heard. But damn that felt good! Cory quickly washed his cum down the drain and got out of the shower. After drying himself with a towel, Cory went back to his bedroom to get dressed. However as he looked the clock he saw that he was already late. &quot;Fuck!&quot; he thought and he picked up his clothes to get dressed quickly. <br />
<br />
The teenager found that his underwear felt a bit loose for some reason. But being already late he just wore them. His uniform however felt great. He had completely forgotten that he was wearing someone else's uniform especially since those clothes fit him well now.<br />
<br />
He grabbed his bag and quickly went downstairs. He even considered going to school without eating breakfast but that seemed stupid. One part of him told him breakfast was an important meal the other part of him told him that not eating just to get in time for school was retarded as fuck.<br />
<br />
So he went to the kitchen, where he found his mother having breakfast.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning, Cory. Aren't you late for school?&quot;<br />
<br />
Cory stood silent for a moment. What had she called him? Cory? &quot;Why did she call me Cory?&quot; he thought. He immediately answered his own thoughts &quot;Because my name is Cory, duh.&quot; <br />
<br />
He felt odd. He wasn't Cory... that made no sense. He had other name, his real name. The name &quot;Cody&quot; came to mind but the boy shook that thought away. No, Cody was somebody else, though he wasn’t sure who. He tried to focus on himself. What was his name? Why couldn’t he remember his own name?!<br />
<br />
The headache suddenly came back. He scratched his head, feeling both confusion and pain. Why couldn’t he accept that his name was Cory? No, he couldn't drop this matter. It was important! What was his name? &quot;C... Cr... my name is... Cra...&quot; he mumbled, feeling his headache getting worse and worse. He was sweating and his muscles felt weak. He was closer to the floor but then he was grabbed by someone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cory, Cory! Are you alright? Answer me, please!&quot; his mother urged as she looked him in this eyes, the same blue eyes they both shared.<br />
<br />
She called him Cory. His own mother was calling him Cory so that must mean that it was his name, right? &quot;My name is... Cory...&quot; he thought to himself. His headache seemed to fade away as quickly as it had appeared.<br />
<br />
Cory stood up, feeling better. &quot;Sorry mom, I guess I need some food!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't scare me like that! It's already difficult having to worry about your father and your brother. Don't you get sick on me, understood?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, sorry mom.&quot; Cory answered and kissed his mother on the cheek.<br />
<br />
He thought it weird that his mother said &quot;your brother&quot;. He didn't have any brothers or sisters. He must have misunderstood what she said so he didn't give it much thought. He was more worried about filling his bowl of cereal and eating.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now look at that hair! And that beard! Are you trying to look like a homeless man?&quot; His mother suddenly complained as Cory ate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, mom! I think it looks good! I bet you actually like me like this.&quot; he joked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't even joke about that! Just hurry up, you're already late!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I know.&quot; Cory answered as he chewed on his cereal.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have some manners at the table!&quot; <br />
<br />
Cory rolled his eyes and said nothing more.<br />
<br />
When he finished his meal, Cory placed the dirty bowl on the dish sink.<br />
<br />
&quot;At least put that in the machine!&quot; his mother scolded him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry mom, I'm already late. Gotta go!&quot; and then he kissed her on the forehead, not really wanting to hear more complaints.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you at least make your bed?&quot; shouted his mother as his son reached the front door.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll do it later!&quot; and he left.</p>
