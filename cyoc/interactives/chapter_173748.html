<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was no small feat for Eve to detain a male honey badger. However, after using her honey and several stings, she managed to incapacitate one as it was drinking honey from her tit. While it wqs out, Eve had caged it into a special spot where unless she helped it out by carrying it, it wouldn&#39;t easily escape from the rock pit.<br />
<br />
Eve hovered over the sleeping Eva. She didn&#39;t hold the woman responsible for being a pest. She didn&#39;t know, so it wouldn&#39;t be right to blame her. However, pests needed to be minded. So she used 4 of her 6 hands to pick up Eva and her remaining 2 to cover her mouth and begin to tease her pussy. Eva needed to be very horny for the honey Badger to take her as his mate.<br />
<br />
Of course, Eva didn&#39;t simply go easily. The woman struggled while being flown in the air. However the moment Eve began speaking, she quickly quieted down and listened. &quot;Calm down Eva, I will not harm you if you please stop struggling. If not, I may accidently drop you.&quot; That was more than enough of a threat to stop her thrashing. Eve continued to bring her up to speed as she flew towards the rock pit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen, I was once like you, an incomplete human. But now look at me, I am a beautiful Queen Hive. Myself and my entire colony are maintaining the meadows you live in, and were so rudely destroying with your constant picking and disregard for the flowers. Sure they look pretty, but when you pick hundreds of them, it ruins them. Plus, you have broken so many branches of our home tree. So you left us little choice. Thus why I am here. Incomplete humans are a danger, so I am going to help you out. You will become one of my most loyal servants, and work to defend and protect myself and my territory. In return, I promise to provide you an endless supply of fresh honey, straight from my breasts. I will feed you generously, and often if you wish too. But you must serve me loyally. I am your Queen, and you will become an active member of my colony. My bees won&#39;t harm you, and will even work with you. We even will provide you and your family a proper shelter within out tree too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now Eva was confused. This creature was once a human? And why did she resemble herself so much appearance wise, minus the bee features? Even her name was similar. However, it was a tempting offer. She had happened to taste the Queen&#39;s honey once, and it was like no other. It was the best tasting thing she ever had, and quickly became her favorite. However finding some more was next to impossible. And now the Queen Hive herself was offering her a lifetime supply of it. There wasn&#39;t really any reason to refuse her offer. <br />
<br />
Eve lifted her hand off of Eva&#39;s mouth and moved it down to begin massaging her breasts. Taking this chance, Eva spoke. &quot;I accept, but what do I have to do actually?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is simple enough to explain. You have 3 tasks:<br />
<br />
1) Mate with and become a Queen Honey Badger, who leads a colony of her own, and serves under me, Eve, the Queen Hive. <br />
2) Defend and protect my territory from hostile predators and pests, as it will also be your home now too.<br />
3) Stay loyal to me, and only me. As well as assist me with managing my territory as I see fit.<br />
<br />
Do these, and I will offer my honey breasts as a reward, as well as a home beside me, in my tree. &quot; Eve didn&#39;t go into much more detail than that as she had reached the rock pit. &quot;Your mate awaits you, but you are not aroused enough yet. So allow me to help you out with that.&quot; <br />
<br />
Eve set Eva down and began licking over her body, specifically focusing on her pussy. She used her hands to pleasure her nipples and breasts at the same time. It wasn&#39;t long before Eva was soaking wet and was begging to be fucked by Eve. &quot;Eve, please mate with me. I want to bare your babies!&quot; Eve stopped her pleasuring and corrected Eva. &quot;No, I am your queen, not your mate, your mate is down there&quot; she said pointing at the rock pit. <br />
<br />
Eva quickly decended the cliff face, eagerly looking for her mate. She could smell his musk already and dropped to all fours once she reached the bottom. The Honey Badger didn&#39;t hesitate and jumped on her, quickly claiming her as his mate. The pair fucked for hours, until Eva now sported a set of sharp claws and teeth, a tail, and hightened fighting abilities and instincts. She also gained another row of breasts to nurse her future babies with, as her many hours of sex, had left her very, very, pregnant. But she did keep her sanity, and began following her Queen, with her own mate following her command. After Eve picked them up and carried them back to the big tree, the pair began their work of defending the territory from intruders and ridding the place of all pests. <br />
<br />
Eva was excited to get her reward from her Queen, and soend some fun time in her new home with both her mate, and perhapse Eve as well. Sure, her mate was perfect for her, and she was very satisfied with him. But there was sonething addicting about Eve. The Queen Hive had brought her a certain pleasure which her mate just couldn&#39;t do. She was starting to feel that while she did enjoy her mate and was very satisfied with fucking him regularly, she actually loved Eve more. Like way more too, even more than she did her own mate. Maybe if she asked her, Eve would agree to become her true mate? Or at least fuck her regularly instead of her current mate. She would easily leave him if Eve asked to take his place.</p>
