<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When I opened my eyes, I winced; the light above was annoyingly bright. I close my eyes again, letting out a soft moan. My whole body felt sore and was aching...I tried to sit up, but even the slight movement made my head start to pound and feel a bit dizzy. My mouth felt like it had been stuffed full of cotton, and my thoughts felt disjointed. I opened my eyes again, squinting against the light. Florescent lights dotted the ceiling above - it was a very spartan looking ceiling, very industrial. Weird. Where was I? Why was I here?<br />
<br />
I tried to speak, but only a small croak came out. <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re awake,&quot; a voice said.<br />
<br />
I turned my head slightly. A blurry shape was standing near me. The voice was kind of familiar. <br />
<br />
&quot;Just relax,&quot; the voice said. &quot;You&#39;re safe now.&quot;<br />
<br />
I wanted to ask questions, but...the world was slipping away.<br />
<br />
--------<br />
<br />
The next time I came to, the room wasn&#39;t nearly as bright. Either that, or my eyes weren&#39;t as sensitive to it. The memories from the last time I&#39;d come to were a bit hazy to me. I was able to sit up this time.<br />
<br />
And then it occurred to me.<br />
<br />
I&#39;d sat up.<br />
<br />
Under my own power.<br />
<br />
A sudden shock of ecstatic disbelief went through me, and I looked down at my chest.<br />
<br />
My breasts were gone. My chest was flat!<br />
<br />
&quot;YES!&quot; I shouted in a rough, shaky voice. &quot;Oh thank GOD!&quot;<br />
<br />
I&#39;m not sure how long I sat there, just crying in disbelief. Maybe it&#39;d be hard for someone else to understand just how much of a relief it was to do something as simple as sit up. For months, I&#39;d had trouble doing just that. In the past few weeks, I hadn&#39;t even been able to! And in the final days before my...my incident...I had barely been able to stand up. <br />
<br />
Now, I could sit up! You don&#39;t realize just how incredible something that simple can feel until it&#39;s been denied to you for so long.<br />
<br />
Finally, I wiped the tears from my eyes and looked around.<br />
<br />
I was on the edge of a cot of some kind. Pretty spartan, with just a pillow and some sheets. There was a small toilet concealed by a half wall over at the edge of the room, which was mostly just...concrete. The florescent lights were still humming above.<br />
<br />
Where was I? Some of my euphoria was beginning to fade. This looked...was this a prison?<br />
<br />
I slowly stood up (under my own power, holy shit!) and looked around. There was what looked to be a window on the other side of the room, but it was dark - I couldn&#39;t see anything through it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello?&quot; I called uncertainly. <br />
<br />
Nothing. <br />
<br />
Shit, where was I? What had happened? The military had been there...<br />
<br />
I looked down at myself again. Everything I wore was a soft gray - sweatpants, socks, a basic shirt. <br />
<br />
Was this a fucking prison?<br />
<br />
The door opened, and the female soldier who had been talking to me back during the...incident...came in carrying a tray of food. She smiled at me kindly, but I didn&#39;t return it. &quot;Bronwyn, it&#39;s so good to see you awake and moving around!&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where am I?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I brought you some food--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Where the fuck am I?&quot; I demanded. &quot;What happened to me...?&quot;<br />
<br />
The soldier tilted her head at me, eyes narrowing slightly. &quot;How much do you remember?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;After the growth started again?&quot; I asked, the memory of it sending a shiver of anxiety down my spine. &quot;Nothing.&quot;<br />
<br />
The soldier nodded, looking uneasy. &quot;Take a seat, Bronwyn. Eat. It&#39;ll make you feel better.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t want your fucking food! Tell me where I am! I want to go...I want to get out of here! Where&#39;s my Mom?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bronwyn, please calm down--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I WON&#39;T CALM DOWN!&quot; I shouted, my temper spiking. &quot;TELL ME WHERE THE FUCK--&quot;<br />
<br />
I trailed off as the soldier&#39;s eyes went wide...and I felt a familiar, terrible sensation. A heaviness on my chest. I looked down. &quot;No.&quot; Two small bumps had begun to appear...and with a surge of growth...they began to get bigger... &quot;No!&quot; Anxiety flooded every inch of me. My breasts leaped forward in size, and with a sudden gasp, I found myself shifting forward, landing heavily on a chest that had gone from nothing to beanbag sized in a matter of moments. The soldier had turned to flee the room, shouting something into her walkie talkie. <br />
<br />
&quot;NO!&quot; I shouted. &quot;NOT AGAIN, DON&#39;T JUST LEAVE ME--!&quot; A fresh spike of anxiety shot through me, and the growth seemed to double in size and intensity.<br />
<br />
There was a hissing noise, and something began to fill the room - some kind of...some kind of gas.<br />
<br />
My eyes began to droop, and I collapsed against my tits, once again falling unconscious.<br />
<br />
-------<br />
<br />
In the control room, Ava looked through the window with wide eyes. &quot;Christ, that poor kid.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her commanding officer, General Rick Johnson, let out a small snort. &quot;Sure, what a poor kid. What a poor weapon of mass destruction.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She didn&#39;t do this to herself, General.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, but it doesn&#39;t really matter at this point does it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ava shook her head slightly. Bronwyn had passed out thanks to the gas...and as she had, the growth had slowed, and stopped. And it was just now starting to go down, albeit it at a much slower pace. What a clusterfuck this whole thing had been. They&#39;d managed to find the guy who had been in possession of the Breastinator...the fact that it was Bronwyn&#39;s own Uncle...but they&#39;d managed to find him, and take possession of the Breastinator. They&#39;d managed to use it - again - on Bronwyn, but this time, halting and reversing the growth.<br />
<br />
But by the time they&#39;d done so...the damage had been done.<br />
<br />
&quot;Her genetic code is a fucking mess,&quot; the doctor had said. &quot;It was altered dramatically before she was even born, sent into overdrive once she hit puberty, and then, practically rewritten entirely when her Uncle zapped her again - and for longer! The growth has gone down for now, but...who knows if it&#39;ll stay that way. We&#39;re going to have to keep a close eye on her.&quot;<br />
<br />
She&#39;d been unconscious, drifting in and out of a half-waking state for weeks. Until earlier, when she&#39;d finally come to.<br />
<br />
And made their worst fears apparent. <br />
<br />
Her breasts were still...active was a fitting word Ava supposed. Triggered and heightened by Bronwyn&#39;s emotional state.<br />
<br />
The General was shaking his head. &quot;Fan-fucking-tastic,&quot; he growled. &quot;I think we should kill her, for the safety of the world. But no, I&#39;ve been overruled on that count.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s just a girl,&quot; Ava snapped. <br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s a ticking time bomb! The potential destruction she can cause, and it&#39;s triggered by her state of mind? She&#39;s fourteen!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ava sighed. They had their orders. Monitor and observe. Keep subdued if necessary. Prevent the growth from becoming a threat, and try to find a way to undo the damage that had been done. <br />
<br />
But she still felt bad for the kid. She hadn&#39;t asked for this. And if they couldn&#39;t find a solution, she was going to be spending a lot of time down here.</p>
