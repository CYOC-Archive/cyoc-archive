<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You head towards the faintly visible lights of a small village as the sun begins to set to <br />
your right. In about ten minutes, you reach the village's gates. The guards are <br />
changing shifts and the one coming out sees you. He is paralyzed in fear as you <br />
approach, but manages to grab the sleeve of the guard going in. The other guard <br />
seems annoyed, but when he sees you he takes off inside the gate and sounds an <br />
alarm. The iron gate of the city slams down, shocking the first guard out of his <br />
paralysis. He realizes he is now locked out of the city with you and feebly pulls out his <br />
sword. He is no more than 17, however, he is quite large and muscular, most likely <br />
from farmwork and training. Fortunately for you, though, he is too afraid of you to even <br />
hold his sword correctly. You still decide it's better to stop out of sword reach.<br />
<br />
&quot;Halt, d-demon, w-what do you want?&quot; he asks with a bit of a stammer. <br />
<br />
&quot;May I go in?&quot; you ask nicely. When he continues staring blankly, you add, &quot;Please?&quot;. <br />
<br />
Apparently, most demons don't say &quot;please&quot;, because he then gives you a strange <br />
look and sounds a bit more confident.  &quot;N-no, get back, demon,&quot; he says and adjusts <br />
his sword quickly. You probably should have played it off tougher; now he might <br />
actually hurt you. You try to stay calm. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, now, what kind of village is this anyway? I need a place to stay for the <br />
night and you're just tossing me out? That seems rather rude. Surely somebody can <br />
help me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He's absolutely right!&quot; a strong voice exclaims as the gate is thrown up again. A <br />
knight in silver armor, holding a helmet at his side, revealing a long, scraggly grey <br />
beard steps forward. &quot;This creature has shown no malice, so we must offer it lodgings. <br />
Of all people, you should be aware of this, Roran. Have I taught you nothing? Please, <br />
sir, forgive our inhospitability; there is a room available at my inn.&quot;<br />
<br />
You thank the man and are allowed to enter the small city. The older knight guides you <br />
to an inn named &quot;The White Rose&quot;. It is a large building in about the center of town. It <br />
is right across from the market where many villagers are still out making purchases for <br />
supper. When they see you, they are frightened. The women scurry to get as far away <br />
as possible, shielding their children with their bodies. The men keep a respectable <br />
distance, but seem curious as to why a Grim is being led into the inn by two guards.<br />
<br />
Once you are inside the building, you get a momentary reprieve from the stares as you <br />
walk through a small hallway. As soon as you enter the barroom, however, you are <br />
met with the same fear. The fear of the bar patrons is a little different: they are a lot <br />
closer and they are trapped inside with you. Everyone moves to the farthest corner of <br />
the room except for the bartender (who still moves to the far end of the bar) and a <br />
drunkard who has passed out at the bar.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you all women that you should cower from something different?&quot; the older knight <br />
asks derisively, goading a couple of the men to take their seats again. Of course, <br />
these men still sat at tables far away from you. &quot;Ah, it's good to see our village <br />
contains so many brave men!&quot; He walks over to the bartender, but motions you to <br />
stay. The young guard steps forward and puts himself between you and the other men.<br />
<br />
You found it humorous that they were all afraid of you when most of them were far <br />
stronger than you were. Of course, they didn't know that you had no control over your <br />
powers yet. You overheard one of them mention the fact that you wore clothing, even <br />
as crude as it was. <br />
<br />
Feeling brave, you make a joke about this to the young guard; &quot;If they want me to <br />
disrobe, they can just ask nicely.&quot;<br />
<br />
The boy snickers against his will and you see an opportunity to break down the wall. <br />
&quot;Why are they so surprised that I'm wearing clothes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, most demons like to flaunt their endowments, if you follow my meaning. You are <br />
the most civilized demon we've ever seen. Especially as a harbinger of death, we <br />
didn't expect a Grim to be so...friendly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me assure you that I don't plan to bring any death here,&quot; you say louder so that <br />
they all hear you. &quot;I just need a place to stay and eat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that's exactly what you'll get,&quot; the knight replied, returning to you and the guard. <br />
&quot;I have a room key for you and I have instructed Bill to give you whatever you need. <br />
There is only one thing more to discuss: payment. I understand you demons don't <br />
often carry human currency, so—&quot; he stops short as you take out your wallet and hand <br />
him a large coin labeled &quot;Antioch Kingdom   Ten&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Will that be enough for tonight?&quot; you ask. You have no idea what their money system <br />
is like, so you just grabbed the biggest coin. You had counted out 1,000 by the <br />
numbers on the coins, but that could be cents or dollars or anything.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tonight? That's enough for a month!...Wait, that's not dirty money, is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks clean enough to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, I mean you didn't take that money from a dead man, did you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would I do that? Just because I'm a demon of death doesn't mean I don't have <br />
any couth.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry if I offended you, that was very prejudiced of me.&quot; <br />
<br />
You assure him it's all right and hand him the ten piece. He hands it to Bill and leads <br />
you up some stairs to your room. The rooms are arranged above the barroom around <br />
a balcony which overlooks the dance floor. Yours is on the opposite end of the <br />
balcony, so you must suffer through a long walk of being stared at by the men below. <br />
The knight opens your room and hands you the key.<br />
<br />
The room is small, but cozy. The bed and sheets are clean, there is a desk and chair <br />
to work at, and a small closet offers some storage space. You enter and sit on the <br />
bed, a bench topped by a wool-stuffed mattress and covered by a thick spread. <br />
<br />
&quot;I don't usually familiarize myself with customers passing through, but since you are a <br />
special case I believe some introductions are in order. My name is Alec; I am the lord <br />
and sheriff of Kingston. This is my son, Roran; he will be your personal guide while <br />
you are here.&quot; This elicited a shocked expression from the boy, but he seemed to <br />
accept it. &quot;What may we call you, sir?&quot;<br />
<br />
You hadn't given much thought to a name. Dave just didn't seem like the name of a <br />
demon, but you didn't know what to call yourself. &quot;Padfoot,&quot; you say, thinking of the <br />
black dog of England. <br />
<br />
&quot;Very well, then, Mr. Padfoot, we will let you rest and become comfortable. Roran, you <br />
will take the room next door so you can help Mr. Padfoot with anything he needs. I <br />
have to go inform the guards of what has happened. I'm sorry, again, for all the <br />
trouble. Enjoy your stay.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two men walked out and left you alone to your thoughts. You had no idea what to <br />
do next.</p>
