<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Derrick was  fascinated by the minotaurs, but he did not want to be a baby, and he sure did not want to float around in a cow&#39;s womb for a week.  The older minotaurs were impressive, but it seemed too much like being a grownup.  He had the feeling hat the two adolescent minotaurs were pretty much his age, or the equivalent.  Problem was, while the male looked like an idealized drawing of a bull-man, the female was more animal-like and way less impressive.  He felt no attraction to her at all, while the young male made his heart beat faster.  He flushed, realizing he was choosing to be like the female if he went through with this.  Yet he could not stop himself from approaching the young male.<br />
<br />
Though obviously an adolescent, the minotaur was two feet taller than Derrick and well-muscled.  The beast snorted and seemed to grin as Derrick made his choice clear, then it stepped forward and hefted him up as if Derrick was a child.  Startled, the human had only a moment to protest before hard three-fingered hoof-hands began ripping his clothing off.  &quot;Hey!  I&#39;ll need those!&quot;  Derrick tried to undo his belt and shoelaces, but the minotaur was holding him too tightly.  In less than a minute, Derrick&#39;s clothing was reduced to rags on the cavern floor.  The minotaur grunted and reached down to dig into a leather bag hung form his waist.  The bag jingled, and produced a large brass ring marked with symbols.  <br />
<br />
&quot;What is that for?&quot;  Derrick frowned and then looked at the other minotaurs.  All of them had similar rings in their nostrils.  &quot;Oh.  Uh, I don&#39;t think that will...  OW!&quot;  He jerked away as the minotaur touched the ring to Derrick&#39;s nose and a sharp sting made the boy&#39;s eyes water.  Then the pain was gone and something cool and hard was resting on Derrick&#39;s upper lip.  He reached up and discovered the brass ring was now embedded in the septum of his nose, as if he had been born with it.  Then he gasped as one of the hard fingers pressed into his butt crack and seemed to tear the flesh open.  Weirdly, instead of hurting he felt a shudder of pleasure roll through his body.<br />
The minotaur snorted and set Derrick down, obviously pleased.  He patted Derrick on the head and mooed.<br />
<br />
Reaching back, Derrick felt his rump and discovered a slick, hot opening under his anus.  He looked at his fingers, expecting to see blood, but the fluid was a thin mucus-like substance with a strong scent.   The male was coming erect, and Derrick reached out and used the slick fluid to slide his hand down the bullcock.  His eyes widened as desire swept through him, and the next moment he took the thick cock head into his mouth and started sucking and lipping.  This was crazy!  But passion built, a kind of frenzied lust that the teenager had never experienced before.  It was more than just sex - he had a basic, primal need to mate with the male!<br />
<br />
The bull bellowed as Derrick used a thicker tongue and more muscular lips to masturbate the massive penis.  The boy was aware of things happening to him, his body pulling and swelling, his face pushing out.  A heaviness formed in his crotch, not an erection, but the hanging weight of udders.  Muscles pulled, and he felt  a tail emerge and twitch.  Derrick wanted to see the changes, but his attention would not tear away from the young bull&#39;s cock.  He felt slick and hot and desperate, and bellowed in frustration as the male suddenly yanked him off and spun him around.<br />
<br />
Confused and wildly aroused, Derrick did not understand what was happening until he felt the bull prod and then thrust deep with a powerful lunge.  Derrick bellowed again, this time in shock and pleasure as his...  no, her..  new pussy was filled by the hot, throbbing bullcock.  All thought left her head and she was simply a beast being mounted, total pleasure and fulfillment of instincts that were as overpowering as they were new.  The pleasure built with each thrust, and her transformation raced to completion.  When her bull came, they both bellowed and grunted as full minotaurs.  <br />
<br />
Derrick felt dazed.  She was trudging along behind her male, feeling content and satisfied in a way she had never experienced as a human.  She was part of his herd now, one of the first cows he had chosen as a mate.  The Herd.  It was more than family, more than partners.  She was HIS COW and would be as long as he lived.  Derrick struggled mentally, trying to get past that concept.  No!  This was only for vacation!  But even as the former human thought that, she knew that it would be nearly impossible to escape this new future as a minotaur cow.  Even if she was not pregnant yet, she surely would be soon enough as the MALE continued to mount HIS new female.  And Derrick wanted that almost more than anything - the thought of bearing HIS offspring made her tremble in joy - how could she every leave HIM?  Yet some small corner of Derrick&#39;s mind was still the 14 year-old human boy.  How much longer could that last trace survive?</p>
