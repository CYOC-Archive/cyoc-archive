<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After Frank joins you, the three of you continue to walk down the street, each of you radiating power and confidence. Vinny, of course, takes the lead, being the leader of your little “club”, but you are close behind his right shoulder, signifying your position as second-in-command as well as Vinny’s favourite fuck toy. Frank meanwhile walks behind Vinny’s left. <br />
You can’t help but grin as you imagine what kind of image the three of you must offer; like something out of an old mobster movie. The difference was of course that Vinny, Frank and you were the real deal…or as real as anyone could be who was created by some sort of magic car keys. You watch Vinny play with the keys in his gloved hand. Without those things he’d still be Keith and you’d still be your old self as well, same for Frank actually… <br />
<br />
You glance over at the blond mobster, the newest addition to your “club”. Frank wasn’t like Vinny and you, Keith and your old self had been friends, Frank had just been a random passer-by whom Vinny had transformed on a whim. You didn’t know anything about his old life. <br />
“Oy! Frankie-boy!” you address him “you still remember what kinda fella you were before Vinny cleaned ya up?” <br />
Frank cocks an eyebrow and smirks “Ya,” he scratches his bearded chin “kinda weird actually, almost like watching a movie, ya know?” <br />
<br />
You and Vinny exchange a knowing smirk “Yup, I know what ya sayin’,” you agree and put a hand on Frank’s shoulder, “so who did ya used ta be? What was your name and all that jazz?” <br />
<br />
Frank chuckles “What do you want to know that for, Marco?” He gives you a playful wink as he shrugs your hand away and challenges you to a bit of play fighting, something you gladly accept and comes entirely natural to you. <br />
<br />
“Makes it hotter,” Vinny chimes in. <br />
<br />
“What’s that boss?” Frank asks.<br />
<br />
“Knowing who you were before,” Vinny clarifies, never turning back to the two of you, “knowing who the drip was I erased back there to create you. It makes it hotter.” <br />
<br />
You agree with Vinny on that. <br />
<br />
Frank grins “Alright. My name was Farrell Grady, I was a retirement home attendant. I shared an apartment with my brother…” <br />
<br />
At this Vinny suddenly does turn around, there is a glint in his eye “Brother?” <br />
<br />
“Yeah, my…or rather Farrell’s kid brother, Laughlin, he’s lead singer in a rock band. Fairly successful around these parts. When I ran into you I was just going to get in a bit of exercise before going to Laughlin’s gig tonight.” He chuckled again, “Of course that’s not gonna happen anymore!” <br />
<br />
Vinny winks at you “Why not?” he asks Frank. <br />
<br />
Frank seems confused “It’s rock, boss, some indie crap, that ain’t our style…” <br />
<br />
“That’s true,&quot; agrees Vinny “but it can be changed to something decent,” he jingled the keys “with the press of a button…” <br />
<br />
There was something like worry in Frank’s face “What do you mean by that, boss? Ya wanna turn Laughlin into one of us?” The concern surprises you. <br />
<br />
Vinny’s face is stone “And what would be bad about that?” <br />
<br />
“You not happy being one of us, Frankie-boy?” you join in, leaning on Vinny&#39;s shoulder.  <br />
<br />
“That’s not it!” Frank quickly defends himself “It’s just…Laughlin is family, uh, bloody family, I don’t want him mixed up in our life, and put him in danger…” he grimaced “please understand boss…” <br />
<br />
Vinny’s stone cold visage melted into a suave smile “Don’t you worry your pretty head about it, Frank, I won’t turn your kid brother into a mobster. Still we should show our support, even if it is crap music. After all Laughlin’s family…right Frank?” <br />
<br />
Frank still looked fairly worried, “Sure, boss, whatever you say…” <br />
<br />
And like this you resumed your walk, now with the destination of the bar where Frank’s brother would have his gig. You smirked as you returned watching Vinny play with the keys. You know he is going to do something to Laughlin with them…and you can’t wait to find out what it would be!<br />
<br />
As you reach the bar (a place called “Black Moon”) the three of your noticed a…commotion at the entrance; a big, bald bouncer was keeping a scrawny, ratty looking guy from entering. <br />
<br />
“Come on, you let my friends in!” the scrawny guy protested, he was looking rather run-down. Not seedy, but in a general poor condition. His long, red hair was in need of a cut (and a wash) and his clothes (a simple, white t-shirt and jeans) were so old and worn that they were almost rags. Upon closer inspection, even his shoes had holes in them, including one rather large his toes poked through.  <br />
<br />
“Not with those shoes…”, the bouncer explained.  <br />
<br />
“I can’t afford any others!”<br />
<br />
“Well then you shouldn’t waste your money at a bar, see ya!” the bouncer gave the guy a rough shove. The guy, knowing his endeavor was fruitless, offered a few, feeble curses and hurried into a back alley, presumably to lick his wounded pride. <br />
<br />
The three of you had watched the entire episode, with the guy gone, Vinny glances back at you and Frank, winks and signals you to follow him as he walks after the scrawny guy. <br />
It is a short walk, its barely a few steps into the alley that you discover the guy sitting on a wooden crate. He looks like he’s moping, but considering how scrawny he is you find it perfectly possible that he’s just lacking the energy to walk further. He looks almost malnourished. What is more he smells… you wrinkle your nose as you wonder if he even owns a bathroom. Not even Keith had ever smelled this bad…not often at least…<br />
<br />
Vinny, meanwhile seems undaunted as he walks right up to the guy “Hey there, buddy, you alright?” <br />
<br />
The guy looks up, at first surprised then scared as he gets a good look of Vinny, Frank and you. “I…” he gulps “I don’t want any trouble…who…who are you? What do you want? I have no money…” <br />
<br />
The three of you chuckle. “We’re just some friendly fellas who’re lookin’ out for folks in our city…” Vinny explains “And yous looking mighty troubled, buddy… what are ya doing ina place like this all by your lonesome?” <br />
<br />
The guy bites his lip “I’m not alone, I’m with my friends, we’re…” <br />
<br />
“The same friends who went into the club without you?” asked Vinny. <br />
<br />
The guy looked angered by this, and hurt “It’s not their fault. I always cause trouble like this…it’s my clothes…” he gestured at his grimy, tattered shirt, “I can’t afford new ones…I’m unemployed…can’t find a job…” <br />
<br />
“I might have a job for ya…” Vinny says and winks at you “and a way to get ya out of those rags…” You and Frank exchange a look and chuckle. <br />
<br />
The guy gulps “Uh...no thanks…” he gets up “I…don’t think I’m qualified for any job you could offer me…” He tries to walk away, but Vinny has long since signaled Frank and you to surround him, so he just bumps into you. Lord, up close the stench of old sweat is even stronger. <br />
<br />
“You should really reconsider, buddy…” Vinny continued, flicking the keys in his hand, “…my little club could do you a lot of good. Just imagine what your so called ‘friend’ would say if they’d see you right now waltzing into the bar with me and the others, decked out in a classy suit…” <br />
<br />
The guy shook his head “Whatever you’re offering, I’m not buying…and I don’t like suits…I wouldn’t be caught dead in one!” <br />
<br />
That did it for Vinny, he snapped his fingers, the signal for you and Frank to secure the guy, each of you taking one of his spindly arms and pinning them against the wall. <br />
<br />
The scrawny guy is struggling and screaming to be let go, but its all so feeble, it’s pathetic. <br />
<br />
Vinny smiles at him “I think you misunderstood me earlier, buddy…” he says as he aims the keys at the struggling guy, “this ain’t an offer ya can refuse…” and he pressed the button. <br />
<br />
As soon as Vinny pressed that button the guy’s struggle not only grew more vigorous, but also stronger. You and Frank feel his scrawny arms expanding in your grip as they gained muscle and strength. Soon it becomes difficult for the two of your to restrain him. Struggling to keep him against the wall you are nonetheless mesmerized as you see his bony hand (featuring rather untended, cloudy nails) flex and stretch into a much, MUCH, bigger, meatier, manlier hand. It’s even bigger than yours or Frank’s.<br />
The whole guy is becoming bigger than you or Frank; in height, as well as in muscle, his shabby clothes ripping as he becomes nearly 7 foot of solid muscle. <br />
<br />
“What did you do to me?” he asks as he tears free from you and Frank and explores his changing body. Beneath his tattered clothes you can see his muscles swelling, a carpet of hair sprouts on his chest and along his arms and legs. His dick grows several inches and his feet gain several sizes as they burst his ruined shoes. <br />
“Stop this…st-op…” his voice drops several octaves mid-word. <br />
<br />
Next the guy’s tattered clothes melt together and start to cover his whole body from the chin down, the white and blue darkening to pitch black. Soon what starts out as a uniform, black bodysuit sculpts itself into a classy black suit, not of the same quality as those Vinny and you are wearing, but definitely on par with Franks. <br />
You stare in awe as the guy’s new, broad chest is covered by a black dress shirt, silk tie and suit jacket (with a matching, black silk pocket square) his legs and feet find themselves wrapped in matching pants and dress shoes and those giant, meaty hands find themselves encased in skin tight leather gloves, similar to those you and Vinny are wearing, only that his feature weighted knuckles, perfect to rough up anybody stupid enough to cross him. Along with the clothes, the guy’s rancid smell is also replaced by an odor much more familiar and acceptable to you; a mix of expensive cologne and cigar smoke. Seems the guy had just gained a new, expensive habit to go along with his new, expensive getup. <br />
<br />
“What the? What is happening?” the guy still protests as his facial features rearrange, giving him a strong, prominent jawline and aquiline nose. You notice his eyebrows and scruffy stubble darkening from red to black, the stubbles also disappear, being replaced by a neatly trimmed goatee.<br />
<br />
You can just catch sight of his eyes growing smaller, harder and fading from green to brown before they are hidden behind a pair of dark sunglasses. A silver stud appears in his left ear. <br />
<br />
Finally, his greasy hair retracts back into his scalp, until nothing remains but neatly shaven skin. <br />
<br />
The guy tears the sunglasses from his face “What have you done to me? Change me back right no…” the guy’s face goes blank for a moment, like a mechanical device that has been switched off. <br />
<br />
And just as quickly he switches on again, as like Frank and you before him he starts his new life by standing up straight, seemingly even adding to his impressive stature (he is almost foot taller than the rest of you) as his face takes on a serious, stone-like expression. <br />
He puts the sunglasses back on “Boss,” he nods at Vinny and cracks his leather-covered knuckles “I’m Tony Marino, your man for the dirty work.” <br />
<br />
Vinny seems very pleased with himself “Good to have you, Tony,” he greets his newest crony “but if everything goes well there hopefully won’t be a reason to dirty your suit tonight. You like wearing it, I assume?” <br />
<br />
“’course, boss!” Tony assures Vinny as the three of you follow him back to the bar’s entrance “wouldn’t be caught dead wearing anything else…”</p>
