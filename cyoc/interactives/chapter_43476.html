<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><DIV ...>Princess Sara walked the Prince, as once inside the master bedroom, to his thrill and surprise, the princess immediately slipped out of her gown. Standing then in all her naked radiant beauty, she made a hand motion toward he lower half, and made mention she being still a virgin, was willing to give it to him.<P ...>

<P ...>"Do you like what you see?" The princess asked of Hillbert.<P ...>

<P ...>"Ah..., why yes..., but of course!" Stunned at his luck and the offer of a romp with such as this beautiful young woman. In his days at court the only women who wanted him in there bed were worse looking than an ten-year old sorely used mare.<P ...>

<P ...>Prince Hillbert stood in awe and struck dumb, he had never seen a sight so magnificent. He stared at the two purely white soft breasts, rounded but tapering slightly upward to their tips, this the puckered nipples of a woman aroused by what she can see. He stands there licking his then dry lips and acting as both nervous as well near to drooling for taking and giving suck to her beauty.<P ...>

<P ...>"As to the victor goes the spoils as they say!" The Princess Sara said, she remarking so with a sultry tone in her voice, "See what is here for such as a hero!"<P ...>

<P ...>Two people engulfed in passion, the Prince at work fondling her as to entice from her as much pleasuring as she could imagine to give.<P ...>

<P ...>The Princess doing the same to her hero, she tracing her index finger, twirling it around his pecks, along his strong muscular torso, coming to cupping his family jewels, she gave a squeeze at his erect shafting. The very touch by her made his member seem to grow, becoming as something engorged huge and long. He could not help but enjoy the bliss he felt, aroused far beyond the touch of any woman he ever had a time of manly joy.<P ...>

A burst of laughter from Sara seemed to spoil their moment together, or at the least for the Prince.<P ...>

<P ...>My dearest, I thought you assuredly wanted to have a taste of the creme awarded to those special and as well feeling such the need...!" The Prince remarked, he seemed suddenly feeling very awkward, as if all of this play was to become some ill reward.<P ...>

"Hero, Idiot..., Prince, you know nothing of being a true gentleman with a woman, you act like a brute, and so you should become! Brute, and acting the part you shall soon look the part, begin now!" The Princess demanded, she pointing her index finger at the Prince; poking him in the forehead and trailing her fingernail down to his still aroused prick.<P ...>

<P ...>Then with sudden swiftness the tip of his engorged male member did shrink back down, seemingly churning in his groin, he screamed as if in horrid agony.<P ...>

<P ...>Scream all you like, there is not a sole near to hear you, just me, and I plan to enjoy what you shall become!" The Princess looking sadistic at he who was her prey, she saying of what was then beginning.<P ...>

<P ...>Agony in his groin, the Prince rolled up into a ball, knees pressed tightly to his chest, he screamed for the pains.<P ...>

<P ...>Minutes seemed as if hours as time passed slowly to a man tortured in body and of his mind. The Prince held his tucked legs to the belly until from his belly, just and inch below his navel erupted there a lump, it became a furry pouch, then a sheath, the maleness common to he who would be soon a bull.<P ...>

<P ...>NO..., no as God be my witness no, please stop this thing from becoming me!" The Prince cried out, begging for what he saw was his skin changing to a dark hide, of fur covering his entire form, and worse was the uncircumcised beastly member that stood erect and before his brazened eyes.<P ...>

<P ...>clothing rent from his body, he soon lay naked on the bed, his legs out straight but changing, becoming the hind legs like a bovine animal. Crying and pleading, his lips grew thicker, mouth changing as did his jaw and then his whole head became like that of a bull. Whimpering to this woman did nothing but make her laugh at him. His arms were changing, fingers merged into two lumps of a soon cloven hoofs, his thumb the smaller dewclaw hoof, it feeling as useless as would he.<P ...>

<P ...>Hoofs, he would have screamed the word if words to him were not as impossible as a bull making love to a beautiful woman. He could but watch, seeing how his penis had found a new home, and what were his testicles became as if huge melon hung in a thinly furred sack to hang low, swinging when he walked. He felt the stomach pain again rush to a heightened agonizing thing, only to come and be gone, fading away to leave him feeling strong of body, and confident to the thought of wanting to sniff at the rumps of cows.<P ...>

<P ...>"Congratulations my hero and Prince, you are one fine form of a bull! Do you still understand what I say, you are not a man , but be now an animal, a bull, to go forth and molest cows for your big thrills." Said then the Princess, she guiding the beast off her bed and have him to get to know how to stand properly on all fours.<P ...>

<P ...>Chiding the fool, she laid bet he would love getting all those weather, leathery cow rumps, rubbing his belly to their poop covered rears, his own shaft would do his loving feeling for him.<P ...>

<P ...>If he failed to realize then, this woman was more than a beauty, but no Princess, she was in fact a witch!<P ...>

<P ...>"My, but I would love to chat but I am afraid your not going to be much good for conversationalist any longer, she felt the need to remark he had lost all ability to speak his mind."<P ...>

<P ...>Lead outside, put to the pasture, she showed her Prince were he would find food and companionship. To her rebuking, he stood and mooed.<P ...>
