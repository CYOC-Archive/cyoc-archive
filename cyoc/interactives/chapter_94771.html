<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Would you be willing to be my baby again?&quot; Morgan asked, looking at her daughter with nostalgic sincerity in her eyes.<br />
<br />
May, who was happy to have her teenaged body back, shivered at the thought. &quot;Can&#39;t we wait later in the week?&quot; she asked, trying to prolong her Mom&#39;s wish<br />
<br />
May&#39;s response wasn&#39;t a surprise to Morgan. Her daughter did value her independence, and asking her to become not even potty trained was definitely the opposite of that.<br />
<br />
&quot;We could. I just got to thinking about how sweet and angelic you were so many years ago. Now that we&#39;re here at the resort, this could be my only time to hold you in my arms again before you enter college and become an adult.&quot; Morgan said, not dropping the conversation.<br />
<br />
Understanding her Mom&#39;s fervent wish, May could only think on what that actually entailed. She was still developing into a beautiful woman, and regressing to an age where she could only be small and helpless was terrifying. She planned on becoming a kid at some point in the week, but she didn&#39;t think she would end up too young for pre-school. However, she knew her Mom had good intentions, and it didn&#39;t seem like she would want her that young the entire week.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just don&#39;t want to lose the ability to walk and talk.&quot; May said, hoping her Mom would just delay the inevitable.<br />
<br />
Morgan, sensing May was giving in, went in for the dagger. &quot;Oh you don&#39;t need to be that young. How about two years old? That way you can still walk and talk, but you&#39;ll still need someone to take care of you. May, I know how much you&#39;ve always wanted a motorcycle, as do I. If you do this, I&#39;ll get you one, as well as myself&quot;.<br />
<br />
The guilt worked, and May exhaled in defeat. &quot;Ok, I guess that&#39;s fair.&quot; May said, already dreading the loss of 15 years to her body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks honey! If you could, please don&#39;t have your clothes change with your regression. I&#39;ll want to &#39;change&#39; you myself.&quot; Morgan said, giddy with delight as she waited for May to start regressing.<br />
<br />
May saw no point in arguing, as she knew she would have to be naked at some point. She closed her eyes and concentrated hard, making sure to regard her Mom&#39;s wish, but make the regression as slow as possible.<br />
<br />
Morgan only stared in awe as she saw her daughter slowly get younger with each passing second. Knowing that she blossomed pretty early in middle school, Morgan studied the subtle changes in May intently, as she regressed through her high school years. Opening her eyes, May already could tell she was younger by the way her hair didn&#39;t touch her shoulders anymore. Looking more like a high school sophomore, May stepped out her now roomier flats so they wouldn&#39;t be in the way later.<br />
<br />
As she passed her freshman year into eighth grade, that&#39;s when both May and Morgan held their breaths. The perky breasts that May cherished and that Morgan got to experience earlier in the evening, grew smaller and flatter with every second that passed. They were still pretty big, as May was an early riser in terms of growth, Remembering those moments only made the sudden drop in height and chest even more painful to May, as she tumbled through reverse puberty on her way to the sixth grade. Now standing mid-chest height to her smiling Mom, May started to tear a little bit as her growing shorts fluttered to the ground along with her plain white panties, leaving her now large shirt the only way protect her nudity for the time being.<br />
<br />
Morgan couldn&#39;t have smiled harder even if she tried. Seeing May reduced to ten years old and still regressing, Morgan could only see the shrinking little girl with the eyes of a mother ready to have her baby back. May&#39;s breasts were almost gone as she hit 9. May remembered getting them during a trip in 3rd grade, and her friends were so jealous. As May shifted from nine years old to eight years old, Morgan&#39;s thoughts drifted into how she would wake May up every morning, whose diapers she was sent to be in due to her bedwetting would be soaked(her sheets were dry at least), and usually a missing tooth somewhere. She had tried to tie May&#39;s beautiful and long black hair, but much like Morgan, May loved her hair staying down and loved the feeling of when the wind would go through it. Standing only as tall as her Mom&#39;s hips, May cranked her neck and showed the fragile face of a first grader regressing out of elementary school.<br />
<br />
As Morgan looked down at her now five year old daughter, she could only see May&#39;s head out of the billowing shirt that swamped her tiny body and arms. May was potty-trained about a month into kindergarten. Morgan remembered how awfully lucky they got that no one found out May was still in diapers. When she finally was having success with potty-training, Morgan remembered seeing the cute underwear she was browsing. All the character print ones were cute to her. Her plans for that were altered when she heard one of May&#39;s classmates was ridiculed when her skirt fell off, wearing the same underwear she was considering. Morgan then decided to get her plain white underwear from then on, which May has worn since. Underneath, May&#39;s arms, legs and chest were gaining the same baby fat that was filling out her cheeks. Sitting squarely in pre-school, May looked like an innocent child playing dress up in her older sister&#39;s clothes. When her face made the sudden shift from little kid to toddler, May could only stare and see how big her Mom and the room had become.<br />
<br />
When the regression ended, so did May&#39;s shirt; her toddler shoulders were too small to keep the shirt held up. Morgan wiped her tears with pride, as the 15 year regression had ended and May was now her two-year old bundle of joy again. Before she could do anything, May was picked up like a bag of air by her mother. &quot;Thank you so much sweetie!&quot; Morgan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mama.&quot; May cried out.<br />
<br />
&quot;May, it&#39;s okay, princess. Now then, I think we need to put you in a diaper before you mess the floor.&quot; Morgan says. She takes May over to the changing table.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Mama.&quot; May says.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, my little bear cub?&quot; Morgan asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;&#39;Membew when my bweasts stawted comin in?&quot; May asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;I remember getting that phone call from Rae&#39;s mother when you were 9-years-old.&quot; Morgan answers. The words &quot;Morgan, your daughter is growing breasts already??????&quot; of her friend rang in her head for a second or two. When they returned from their trip to Chicago, she also remembered hearing May&#39;s friends say &quot;Miss Schroeder, that&#39;s not fair!!! How come she&#39;s growing boobs and we aren&#39;t?&quot;, and then explaining that pattern of early women growth in her family. Morgan then remembered another phone call, this one coming from May at home when she was 10 &quot;Mom, why is blood coming out of my crotch??????&quot;. She knew then and there it would be a long 8 years of May going further into womanhood.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gonna stink not bein&#39; so tall fow a bit.&quot; May sighs, as Morgan has now applied said diaper on, but not before getting some powder in there.  May actually was liking the feeling of a diaper on her behind.<br />
<br />
&quot;So comfy. Maybe this won&#39;t be so bad. It&#39;s not like I&#39;ll spend the whole time like this. We&#39;ve got another 2 months or so here. I&#39;ll get her to be a baby yet. That motorcycle is gonna be so worth this.&quot; thought May.<br />
<br />
&quot;You okay, baby?&quot; Morgan asks. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hawd to tawk.&quot; May answers. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll call the front desk to see if they have something to fix that.&quot; Morgan says. She pulls out her phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, my daughter became a 2-year-old and her speech is slurred.&quot; Morgan says.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go into the medicine cabinet in the bathroom and grab one of the blue gummies. That will fix it.&quot; he answers. Morgan does just that. She gives May the gummy, which she chews.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa, that&#39;s much better.&quot; May says.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure sounds like it. May, I&#39;m sorry for imposing my selfish wants on you.&quot; Morgan says.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s okay. I&#39;m looking forward to that motorcycle when we get home. &quot; May says.<br />
<br />
&quot;Despite your quiet nature, you want something like that and that surprises me. I want one too, sweetie. Maybe we&#39;ll take a ride somewhere together. You aren&#39;t getting a Harley though.&quot; Morgan says, drawing the line.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t want one. Only skanks get those.&quot; May says.<br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed. Anyway, is there anything you need?&quot; Morgan asks. May thinks for a moment.</p>
