<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Alright now, let’s see what I got in here.”<br />
After spending some time around the campsite to check and see all the traps that had been created, Seph was now entering the large tent to see what was inside. Now inside, Seph noticed nothing particularly odd, just a rack with some old weapons on them ranging from knives to spears though all needed a good sharpening, a single large bed meaning this place was forced to stay here even if Seph could carry everything inside the tent, and finally was were some chests with no locks on them. Checking the contents of the chest, Seph found them to be strangely organized as one held meats and cheeses while also being cold, the next held normal vegetables like carrots and lettuce that were being kept cold as well and the last held an assortment of bottles and fruits and vegetables though no cooling could be found. Interested in the strange fruits, Seph started to pull different kinds out like a small peach that has small whiskers protruding from the side, and a tubular pod that splits at the end could be found while others vegetables looked like peppers but were either black or red with large knots near the top of them. Unsure with what to do with them, Seph simply tossed them in with the other vegetables and fruit while leaving the strange liquids where they were for now. Done looking through the chests, Seph examined the last item of the room more closely. The bed was covered in furs as well as blankets of what looked to be wool while the pillows were nothing more than pillowcases stuffed with straw. Sitting down on the bed to test how comfortable it was, Seph was surprised by how comfortable it was even with the straw pillows. The only flaws with the bed that Seph could find was that it was somewhat lumpy in some areas while other were completely flat and soft. Knowing he wouldn’t be able to sleep at night in such conditions, Seph hopped off the bed and gripped the underside of the mattress to pick up. Doing so,Seph understood why the mattress was so lumpy as under it was a large carrying back and a small pouch.<br />
Pulling both bags out from under the bed, Seph proceeded to empty them. The small pouch turned out to be completely empty save for only a few small red gemstones and nothing more while the larger bag held a fully undamaged shield inside of it. Picking up and trying out the straps on the back, Seph was surprised by how easily it fit. Taking the shield off his arm, Seph made to put it back where it came from but was stopped upon noticing the new/old contents now in the bag as a perfect replica of the shield was exactly where Seph was planning to put the old one. Starting to freak out again, Seph was soon calmed by some unknown force before looking at it logically.<br />
‘The voice said that all the changes and options I picked stuck with me so that must mean that I have an ability to multiply objects as I use them.’<br />
Wanting to test out the theory, Seph picked up the bag before dumping its contents on the floor. Picking up the new shield, Seph saw no copy inside of the bag now. Feeling he understood it now, Seph leaned the two shields against the weapon rack and out of the way.<br />
“Well i’ve checked everything I could around here so what now?”<br />
Seph rumbling stomach was the answer to that question. Going back to the chests again, Seph opened the food related ones before pulling out only a few pieces of meat and cheese and some fruits and vegetables. Unsure about the strange toobs and peppers, Seph now had a handful of dried meat and cheese in one hand and a few whisker covered peaches in the other. Finishing off the meat and cheese first and then drinking a large gulp of water, Seph watched as the food he ate grew back from literally nothing in his hand. Shrugging and putting his main meal back, Seph also put away most of the peaches leaving only one in his hand. Wanting to get the taste of dry meat out of his mouth now, Seph bit into the soft fruit before chewing and swallowing and starting all over again to finish it. Like the meat and cheeses, The fruit was soon replaced letting Seph eat another of the delicious fruit. After five more fruits were consumed, Seph put his newest copy away and laid on his new bed to let his meal settle.<br />
Suddenly and without warning, a blooming warmth spreads throughout Seph’s body. Unsure of what was causing it, Seph started to take off his clothes, underwear and all to try and cool off. The process helped somewhat but Seph was still sweating like mad. As Seph tried to wait out the unwanted heat, he soon noticed that his lower member was now standing at full attention and throbbing with need. Uncaring of what he did now, Seph started to stroke his five inch rod as vigorously as possible. Soon Seph’s cum started to build up deep within his balls and as Seph continued with his troking, he suddenly felt pain. Stopping for a moment with some sense now, Seph saw his body in the process of changing. His hands were starting to become paw like and his knees were reversing and to top it all off, short brown hair was starting to grow all over his body. While Seph looked at his body, he was suddenly wracked with another sense of what he could only call lust making him look at his penis once again. Instead of seeing his five inch normal penis though, it was more cylindrical with a pointed head and close to a hundred small barbs growing out of the tip with a few covered in his own blood. Even with his apparent lack of surprise at what he was seeing Seph still felt fear at what was happening to him which worked just as well in not making him think straight.<br />
Without much thought Seph knew that it was the strange fruit that he ate that caused his current transformation but he didn’t know how to undo it. Not caring about what would do the trick, Seph ran to the vegetable chest where he put the other strange fruits and vegetables and started to pull them out to look at them.<br />
‘If a fruit turned me into something maybe a vegetable can change me back but which one is the problem...Who cares i’ll just eat the biggest!’<br />
Grabbing the largest vegetable in the bin which was one of the many peppers with knots in them, Seph scarfed it down without a second thought before eating the next one that took its place. After eating close to ten of the large peppers, Seph noticed that he was no longer transforming but he was already fully furred and his hands and lower body were still the same. Dejected, Seph realized how foolish he had acted before getting back up to gather his clothes. Suddenly, like Seph was filled with the same heat as before but it was focused in his now feline cock causing it to reach full mast again. Unsure of what was happening, Seph watched as the small barbs receded into his cock as though the had never been there. Happy to see that he was at least turning one part of his body to normal, Seph continued to watch with more control than earlier to see it change, but not in the way he expected.<br />
Slowly Seph noticed that while his cock continued to throb with lust it was slowly getting bigger in size though it was only when the thing was an inch longer than it had been. Still watching the changes for close to a minute now, Seph’s five inch cock had grown by 10 inches to a abnormal 15. As well as growing in size, Seph’s cock grew in thickness as well giving it a engorged circumference of 3 but, near the base, the growth continued until a 3 inch knots had grown on each side of his penis. Unsure of what to do now with his new penis Seph let his newly made animal instincts take control as he started to stroke again but this time it was with both hands to fully wrap around his new meat stick. Closer and closer, Seph edged himself until finally he couldn’t take it anymore and blew his load all over the dirt ground of the tent. Tired from all his transformations and masturbating, Seph slowly got to his feet and headed to his bed to sleep the rest of the evening and and coming night away with only one final thought running through his mind.<br />
‘At least I don’t have a snout like Wulf-rick.’</p>
