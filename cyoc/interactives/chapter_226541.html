<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Oliver tried deciding what he should do he noticed a baseball cap hanging from his closet. Edgar had let him borrow it a few weeks ago when he went to a football game and he hadn’t gone around to returning it, despite living in the same apartment. He always seemed to forget due to his lack of interest in the hat. <br />
<br />
But now it had his full attention.<br />
<br />
Oliver went to his dresser and pulled a small black box from his drawer. It was the same one from this morning. He had stuffed it in his pocket after placing the ring on his hand and was using it to store the ring. However, it was the folded note inside that interested him. <br />
<br />
Re-reading the note, Oliver found the part mentioning body swapping. “So all I have to do is wear something they own and we swap bodies?”<br />
<br />
He walked to his closet and grabbed the hat, making sure the ring was on his finger, before putting it on.<br />
<br />
“Does it still work if I’m borrowing the article of clothing?” Oliver questioned before the world become black.<br />
<br />
The next thing he knew he was blinking his eyes open in the bathroom, a towel wrapped around his waist. He was currently standing in front of the mirror and although it was fogged up he could still make out who he saw.<br />
<br />
“Edgar!” Oliver shouted in surprise at his roommate’s sudden appearance. Edgar’s blue eyes looked back at him as Oliver examined himself, realizing he now had Edgar’s body.<br />
<br />
Edgar looked very different than Oliver. He was tall, standing at a height of 6 feet, with fair skin. He was also chubby, a layer of fat over his body that gave him a small gut and rounder pecs that looked a little like moobs. His forearms and thighs were also wider than Oliver’s with a matching set of chunky arms and legs.<br />
<br />
Edgar’s black hair was trimmed and short, always brushed into place in the morning. Likewise, his body hair was also black and there was a good amount on him. He had two bushes underneath his pits with strands of hair that stuck out even when they were closed, as well as a thin layer of black hair over his chest and stomach. His arms and legs were also covered in black hairs along with his face, which sported a perpetual 5 o’clock shadow.<br />
<br />
Edgar also had a resting bitch face, looking annoyed at all times despite the actual emotion he felt in the moment. But he didn’t look bad. His dark hair and light eyes made a nice contrast that made him looked attractive in spite of his slight double chin and round cheeks. His height and hairy body also assisting him with good looks.<br />
<br />
“This is insane! I’m Edgar!” Oliver said with Edgar’s voice. It was a little deeper than his original voice and sounded cold and aggressive, matching well with Edgar’s aloof personality.<br />
<br />
Edgar didn’t have many friends. His presence was too intimidating for people to get close to him. However, Oliver had gotten close to him over the years in the classes they shared due to his friendly nature. They found they both had the same major and became good friends, which is how the two ended up rooming together their junior and, now, senior year.<br />
<br />
They had their share of differences and Oliver would often mess up and anger Edgar. But they were often quick to resolve it. This was going to be no different except that Oliver was now in Edgar’s body.<br />
<br />
“Hey, Edgar! Are you still mad?”<br />
<br />
Oliver looked over to the door alarmed as he recognized his voice. He knew he should have expected this but it was still jarring to hear it from an outside perspective.<br />
<br />
Recalling the note, Oliver looked at his hand to see the ring had materialized on to his finger. Exactly where he had placed it before putting on the baseball cap.<br />
<br />
“So… that’s really me out there?” Oliver thought as he grasped the bathroom doorknob with his hand. He wasn’t sure if he was ready to face himself yet but after staring at Edgar’s worried expression in the mirror for a few seconds, he decided to open the door.<br />
<br />
Oliver stepped out of the bathroom and was shocked to see himself waiting outside. His old body looked exactly the same, wearing the clothes he had chosen earlier although he lacked a ring on his hand.<br />
<br />
“Oh, Edgar. Didn’t expect to see you here,” the other Oliver said.<br />
<br />
From his new height, Oliver stared down at his old body with a grim expression. Seeing his old body creeped him out, even if he was expecting it, so he made his way to Edgar’s bedroom quickly. Wanting to avoid as much contact with the other Oliver as possible.<br />
<br />
“Hey! I’m sorry I forgot to give you back your textbook!” He heard him say as Oliver brushed past him.<br />
<br />
He quickly locked himself inside Edgar’s room and sat on the bed, full of disbelief. It was amazing and frightening knowing he had just swapped bodies and lives with Edgar. Guilt also crept into him as he realized he was the only one aware of the swap. Just as the note said, the ring had allowed him to easily slip into the life of his roommate. His original body none the wiser.<br />
<br />
“Well as long as I’m Edgar I better do something useful,” Oliver thought as he opened Edgar’s dresser and pulled out some clothing. He grabbed a pair of jeans, some boxers, and a shirt from the closet and laid them on the bed. Removing the towel around his waist, Oliver examined Edgar’s dick in curiosity. It was about two inches bigger than his own and a bit thicker, large balls hanging below. Similar to Edgar’s hirsute body, a large and messy bush of black pubes surrounded his member. It connected to the hair on his stomach, forming a treasure trail.<br />
<br />
Oliver dried himself off as he put the clothes he chose on. The boxers clinged to his backside, his ass much plumper and larger than before. It was no bubble butt but it was nice, fat, and round. Definitely worthy of catching people’s attention. Oliver put the rest of the clothes on and put on a pair of sandals near the bed. As expected the ring didn’t do anything. Now that he was Edgar it didn’t make sense for the ring to swap him whenever he put Edgar’s clothes on. But it did raise a good question. <br />
<br />
How was Oliver supposed to swap back?<br />
<br />
The question made his heart skip a beat as he realized he had no idea. In the heat of the moment Oliver had quickly put on the baseball cap. Never questioning the process of reversing it. The note had also never clarified how to switch back or if it was even possible.<br />
<br />
On one hand this was bad because he could be stuck as Edgar forever but on the other hand it was sorta good. He hadn’t swapped with some random person and could still see his old body. Only it was now kinda creepy.<br />
<br />
Oliver wondered what he should do next as the ring laid on his finger, ready for his next move.</p>
