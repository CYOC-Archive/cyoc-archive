<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jason grinned.  The Chronivac was still modifying his subject.  Shane <br />
was on his knees fondling his huge heavy hairy balls. His cock was <br />
pointing straight up and his shorts were now around his bent knees.<br />
<br />
SPLOOGE.<br />
<br />
Shane closed his eyes as his hefty balls emptied their contents.  A <br />
bucket of latex like cum covered his head and body.  His balls felt <br />
suddenly light - way too light, lighter than they had been before they <br />
grew.  He wiped the wet sticky liquid from his eyes. He stared down at <br />
his now hairless rubbery round balls which were changing to be covered <br />
with brightly colored rubber panels. He pushed on the left ball and it <br />
felt like a balloon or real beach ball. There was a popping sound <br />
followed by a hissing noise. The ball had disconnected from Shane's <br />
body.  Its open valve stem was allowing air to escape from the <br />
detached beach ball. Quickly Shane closed the valve to keep the air <br />
from escaping. He could feel the rubber beach ball with his hands, but <br />
he could also feel his hands touching his oversized detached ball. It <br />
was so strange. He was afraid to touch his other beach ball for fear <br />
it would come loose. <br />
<br />
Instead he bent over with one ball under his arm to exam the hole <br />
beneath his cock which was left when the ball came free.  It was dark. <br />
He stuck his index finger in it. It stretched like rubber.  He didn't <br />
feel flesh - he was hollow inside. That wasn't possible. He stood up <br />
straight in shock and found himself face to face with Jason.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Shane!&quot; Jason said with a grin. <br />
<br />
The odd device in hand chimed. Shane felt his knees become all <br />
rubbery. Hell his whole body became rubbery. He fell into Jason's <br />
other arm. He was light weight and draped like a wetsuit over Jason's <br />
arm. <br />
<br />
Jason laughed, &quot;I'm really go to get into you, Shane.&quot;<br />
<br />
To Shane's horror, Jason stripped naked, and then shoved his sandy <br />
barefoot into Shane's stretched mouth. The hairy leg followed. It slid <br />
down Shane's hollowed out throat, through his chest and down his <br />
hollowed out right leg. He felt Jason's toes wiggle into his own toes. <br />
It was so freaking weird. Then Jason pulled Shane's rubberized mouth <br />
wider than possible and shoved his other foot down Shane's throat.  <br />
<br />
Now Jason stood there looking down at Shane's legs with his legs <br />
inside them. He smiled.  The rest of Shane was rolled up around <br />
Jason's waist.  Jason reached inside Shane to put his cock into the <br />
sleeve that was Shane's cock. Then he pulled one of his testicles <br />
through the hole where the ball had come loose. Now he pulled the <br />
other beach ball off.  He squeezed the hissing ball until it was flat. <br />
Then he pulled his other testicle through the rubber hole that was <br />
left by removing the beach ball.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shane, dude, I'm just putting you on,&quot; Jason chuckled as he pulled <br />
the rubber skin over his chest and put one arm inside Shane's arm as <br />
if it was a glove. Then he repeated his action with his other arm.<br />
<br />
Jason looked down at Shane's body below is neck.  He ran his hands <br />
over his skin-covered body.  He put back on his red Speedo, which he <br />
had been wearing as underwear. Then he pulled on Shane's shorts.  He <br />
stuffed the Chronivac and other clothes into his backpack.  Then he <br />
put on Shane's wristwatch which had fallen off when he had turned into <br />
a rubber suit.  It took a little while rummaging in the sand to find <br />
the ring that had slid off Shane's finger.  But he found it. He <br />
laughed. He was Shane, and there was nothing Shane could do about it.<br />
<br />
Jason pulled Shane's lower jaw up over his own lower jaw.  The rubber <br />
teeth and tongue slid over Jason's own teeth and tongue.  Now he <br />
pulled the upper part of Shane's rubber head over his own.<br />
<br />
For Shane this was the most traumatic experience.  Shane felt Jason's <br />
mind inside his own.  He couldn't really see into Jason's mind, but he <br />
could feel his own mind being totally exposed.  He could sense - maybe <br />
hear- Jason's snarky comments as he reviewed Shane's memories. Shane <br />
tried to resist but he couldn't.  He didn't understand what or how <br />
Jason had done this to him, but Jason was not interested in explaining <br />
to Shane.  <br />
<br />
The new Shane picked up Jason's backpack.  He shoved the deflated <br />
beach ball in his pocket, and tucked the inflated one under one arm <br />
and started up the beach to the pool and jacuzzi area.  He could see a <br />
beach ball bouncing back and forth as he approached.  Soon there would <br />
be two beach balls in play, and then He was going to use Shane's body <br />
for his own pleasure.  Shane could only go along quietly for the ride <br />
as Jason wore him like a disguise.</p>
