<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I put on Meredith&#39;s coat, checked myself in the mirror and went outside. I was right to think I had to get out of the house. It made my situation all that more thrilling. I walked past people on the street with no idea I wasn&#39;t what they thought I was. People glanced at me, thinking I was just a normal girl. Of course, they had no reason not to think that, it was essentially true. But just knowing they were thinking that about me, as if it were normal, was actually quite fun.<br />
<br />
Then I got wolf-whistled when I passed a construction site. I wasn&#39;t sure what to make of that. On the one hand, it was kinda nice knowing somebody thought I was pretty, something I&#39;d never thought about myself before. But it was also very uncomfortable, coming from an overweight balding man who then leered at me until I turned a corner.<br />
<br />
I reached the arcade, a few blocks from my apartment. I hadn&#39;t been there in a while, but used to go there all the time shortly after arriving in the city. I didn&#39;t have a console at the time so I spent a lot of my free time there. I didn&#39;t have a lot of free time anymore, but now that I did it was instinctively my first port of call.<br />
<br />
I went straight to my favourite game. It was an Arcade shooter, the kind where you point guns at the screen and shoot terrorists but avoid civilians. When I&#39;d been jobhunting, I&#39;d spent a lot of time playing that game and gotten the top three high-score places. <br />
Somebody else was playing it when I got there, so I waited nearby, watching him play. He was a tall, black guy, mid twenties with thick stubble and wild hair. He was on the very last stage and doing well. I watched as he effortlessly breezed through the level, anticipating every action and not missing a shot. He&#39;d clearly sunk a lot of time into this.<br />
<br />
The level ended and a high score flashed up. He cheered to himself and entered his initials &#39;DRT&#39;. When it showed the high-scores list, DRT was the top five places. My old high-score was now number 6.<br />
&#39;Hey, you beat me!&#39; I couldn&#39;t help saying aloud.<br />
&#39;Huh!&#39; He jumped, not realising I&#39;d been there. &#39;What did you say?&#39;<br />
&#39;That&#39;s my score,&#39; I said, pointing to number 6.<br />
The man looked me up and down and scoffed. &#39;That took me weeks to beat. No way that&#39;s you.&#39;<br />
<br />
My eyes narrowed. I wagered he&#39;d believe me if I was still in my old body.<br />
&#39;Oh yeah?&#39; I said. &#39;I bet I can beat your top score right now!&#39;<br />
&#39;Hey, you&#39;re welcome to try,&#39; he smirked, handing me the gun.<br />
<br />
For a second, I regretted what I&#39;d said. I knew I was better than he thought I was, but he had still beaten my score and I hadn&#39;t played in a while. But when I caught sight of his smug grin as he watched me load up the game, I was determined to wipe it off his face.<br />
I focused more intensely than ever before. Once I started, it all came back very quickly, the timings and patterns of the stages. It took a bit to get used to firing with my shorter stature and my smaller hands, but I soon got up to speed. I jammed in more quarters and made it all the way to final stage. When I finished, it flashed up with a high score. 4th place. I&#39;d beaten my old high score by two places, but not enough to place first.<br />
<br />
&#39;Shit,&#39; I spat, throwing the gun back into its holster. &#39;Give me another try, I&#39;ll get that first place if it kills me.&#39;<br />
But when I turned back to the man, he started clapping. &#39;You&#39;re pretty damn good,&#39; he admitted. He looked me up and down again, clearly checking me out, and said, &#39;I&#39;m Troy. What&#39;s your name?&#39;<br />
At first, I was annoyed. Did I really have to prove myself to be worthy of his attraction? Did he think I was going to forget that had he made assumptions about me because I was a woman?<br />
<br />
But then, I had a look at him too. He was quite good looking. He was in pretty good shape and did I mention tall? My eyes wandered to his crotch and I wondered if it was true what they said.<br />
&#39;I&#39;m... uh, Meredith,&#39; I said. <br />
<br />
Before I tell you what happened next, let me say two things in my defence.<br />
First, at this point, I was pretty certain that it was my cock that was cursed. Since my cock was God knows where by now, I didn&#39;t think there was any risk.<br />
Second, Runt must have worked some sort of magic on me because for the second time in as many days, I was spontaneously fucking somebody.<br />
<br />
It happened exactly the same way it happened with Meredith. I felt myself going wet and I could see the bulge in his pants growing. By that point, there was no going back. This was happening no matter what.<br />
He grabbed me, practically lifting me off the ground as he threw open a nearby supply closet. By the time he shut the door behind us, I was already out of my shirt. I unzipped his pants and yanked them off. Then I pulled his cock out of his boxers, which, while not ridiculous, turned out to be pretty damn big actually. I squeezed it in my petite hand, feeling its heat. It didn&#39;t matter that I wasn&#39;t normally attracted to cocks, this one was really doing it for me.<br />
<br />
He slipped off his shirt and shoes then worked on bra. &#39;Damn it,&#39; he said as he fumbled. &#39;Can you do this?&#39; <br />
&#39;Uh.&#39; I wasn&#39;t sure that I could.<br />
&#39;Ah, got it.&#39;<br />
My bra fell to ground and he was fondling my breasts, hunching over to kiss me while he did. I felt so small next to him, a little vulnerable perhaps. It turned me on a bit.<br />
I shuffled out of my jeans and panties, before pulling him back onto a pile of boxes and guiding his meaty cock into my vagina. The moment he came into contact with me, an intense, unnatural pleasure shot through us both. His mouth shot away from my lips as he arched his back in surprise. I shivered as I felt him go all the way up inside. It was like nothing I&#39;d ever experienced before.<br />
After a moment of this, I put my hands on his hips and encouraged him to thrust. It was like he&#39;d forgotten to do it, but quickly returned to form. Each time, I squealed in delight, not caring who heard. The pace quickened. I buried my head against his chest, clutching onto him for dear life. Then I felt him release inside me and I gave into the pleasure.<br />
<br />
I realised what had happened almost instantly. I opened my eyes and saw Meredith, lying naked on a pile of boxes underneath me. I stepped back, my meaty cock slipping out of her as I did. She looked so small now. I stood up and my head almost hit the ceiling. <br />
Meredith sat up, looking at me in confusion. &#39;But...&#39; she said. Then she covered her mouth her hand.<br />
I was in Troy&#39;s body and Troy was in Meredith&#39;s. How could explain to him what had happened? How could I explain to Meredith?<br />
<br />
And so, I did a second thing that day I wasn&#39;t proud of. I ran away, without even bothering to pick up my clothes.</p>
