<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;James, you think you can treat women with disrespect?  Well, I&#39;ve got good news for you!  How would you like to go to school with Becky since you decided to join our little party.&quot;, said Madame Illusia.  She then froze James in place as those left with their mental faculties watched in horror, but the audience watched with deep interest.  The same special pink helmet that Becky had on had formed on James as well.  His black t-shirt turned a light purple as his black denim pants crept up his legs to be morphed into black denim shorts only to split open in the crotch to become a black denim skirt.  That skirt then changed from denim to heavy cotton as the color changed from black to a purple and gray plaid color.  That skirt then continued to grow upward until it became a jumper dress just perfect for school.  James wanted to throw up, but couldn&#39;t due to being frozen.  The audience laughed once again and wolf whistles could be heard coming from it.  James&#39; socks grew longer and softer as they crept up to just above his knees.  His shoes, changed to a gray and lavender color as playful kitties danced around his shoes.  His shoes then started to flash purple and pink as LEDs found their way into his shoes completing them.  The crowd watch in amazement and then roared to life with laughter again as his black boxer shorts then turned into black panties.  After turning into black panties they became white panties.  The crowd noticed that his panties started shift and fill out as his gusset thickened so that it could easily absorb a small amount of moisture turning into absorbent unisex underwear.  The absorbent underwear then started to bulk up a little bit more as they took on a more disposable look that wasn&#39;t plastic or cotton, but was somewhere in between.  Kind of like paper.  yellow lines then formed around the front of the disposable diaper.  They&#39;d turn blue if they were wet.  Afterward, and one final time the disposable underwear once again morphed.  This time It ballooned out a lot as the sides separated themselves, grew tape tabs and then refastened.  The papery backing turned into crinkly plastic as a medical looking design formed down through the crotch.  The words &quot;medium size maximum absorbancy was printed in fine print that repeated through his crotch.  On his right arm, a medical bracelet formed that stated that he was special needs and gave the address to his new home, Madame&#39;s house.  Then, Madame magicked on stage next to Deborah&#39;s playpen a sort of wheelchair that looked kind of like a stroller at the same time.  Using her powers, Madame lifted James up and over to the stroller as the leg cuffs, the torso restraints, the abductor used to separate his legs, and a tray snapped into place securing him in.  &quot;Well, James, since you wanted to join Becky at school, I would have been content to leave you as smart as a fifth grader, but because you tried to run away from me, I think you should need just a little bit more help than she does.&quot;, said Madame.  She then placed her finger on James&#39; forehead.  His whole mindset started to change.  He didn&#39;t know how old he was because he forgot how to count.  But, Madame knew that he mentally would be a 19 year old girl with a six month&#39;s old intellect.  His muscles weakened leaving him to leak a little into his diaper.  He&#39;d never be able to walk again.  In fact, even crawling on the floor would be an extremely difficult task.  His diet would have to consist of only mushy baby food and a vanilla flavored nutrition supplement that he&#39;d be bottle fed afterwards.  Unlike Becky, he couldn&#39;t understand language anymore and never would again.  He had no concept of time nor could he have a concept of who he was.  A line of drool formed in the corner of his mouth and started to pool and wet his jumper.  Madame mentally bonked herself in the head for having forgotten to magic one on him, but she quickly remedied that problem as a mint green terry bib with vinyl backing appeared on James&#39; chest and tied itself around his neck.  Madame then turned to Tina who was raging like a hornet.  &quot;You!  You&#39;re going to get what you asked for!  You will be a 15 year old and you will help me take care of all these adult children as well as Monica!&quot; Madame spat as she guided her hand across the stage.  Madame wanted to get Tina over quickly and so she froze her in place and then placed her hand on Tina&#39;s forehead.  Tina&#39;s change mental change was different.  Tina lost her knowledge of sex, but when she thought of boys, her pussy grew moist.  Madame filled Tina&#39;s mind with images of boys making out with her, groping her, and calling her a slut.  She developed a slutty teen&#39;s fashion style and a disinterest in school work.  She lost all knowledge of her life before her mental change, but she did retain the school  knowledge she had when she was originally 15.  She developed a desire to drop out of school when she turned 16 partly because she hated school, but also because she loved her mom, her brother, her sisters, and her pet dog.  she&#39;d do anything for them from cooking for them to playing with them to changing diapers to giving Monica walkies.  She hoped to have a big family of her own one day.  But for now, sharing her home with her mom, dog, and many siblings was good enough.  Madame made a mental note to give Tina some money later in the week so that she could go pick out some new clothes.  Her old clothes wouldn&#39;t show off her assets.  Madame then thought about who to change next.</p>
