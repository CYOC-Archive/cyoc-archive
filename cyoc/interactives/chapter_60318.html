<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Both Molly an I passed out at the end of first time together. Lost in the pleasure... or the alcohol, I didn't really notice what happened to me, and I just sorta passed out after &quot;cumming&quot;. Molly also seemed to be getting sleepy and she began pulling me into a hug as I collapsed down, my now softening member still inside her. The two of us fell into a fairly peacefully slumber.<br />
<br />
Our sleep didn't last long. About two hours later I heard what sounded like sirens in the distance.<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT'S... OWWWWWWWWWW!&quot; I spoke in surprise and climbed to my feet, only to hit my head on the ceiling, &quot;WHAT THE...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That would be the ceiling,&quot; Molly said nervously as I hunched myself over a little bit to give my head some room. I turned to see her turn her ears to the sound that had woken us up, &quot;and that sounds like police sirens.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;THEY...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You need to whisper, George,&quot; Molly said softly.<br />
<br />
I raised an eyebrow in confusion at that.<br />
<br />
&quot;They sound like they're coming closer,&quot; I commented as softly as I could, and noticing Molly's nervousness, &quot;what's wrong?<br />
<br />
Molly looked up to me, and I could easily see that she looked extremely nervous.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's wrong?&quot; I asked again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't hate me,&quot; Molly gave a whimper.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hate you?&quot; I asked back, &quot;Molly love you as much as life itself. We just got married. I will defend you until one or both of us has died.&quot;<br />
<br />
Molly gave a half smile at that and got up and out of the bed and walked over to me. Once she got to me, she pulled me into a hug. Instead of the tickling feeling of fur on skin, it was more the sensation of fur on fur, which puzzled me a bit. And at the same time, I could still smell a very attractive scent on Molly. It was all puzzling to me and I couldn't understand it. Molly then raised her head to place the tip of her muzzle against my nose.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you see my nose?&quot; Molly asked.<br />
<br />
Despite the low light, I could see it easily. The pink triangle at the end of the reddish-orange feline muzzle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; I said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you see yours?&quot; Molly then asked.<br />
<br />
I raised an eyebrow again and looked down and then the eyes practically bulged out of my head. I couldn't see the triangle nose tip, but I could see the reddish orange muzzle below MY eyes. I then rapidly began to look myself over.<br />
<br />
Somehow I was a tiger! I was covered in fur. White fur lined my chest and stomach, my inner thighs, the underside of my arms. My member was now inside a protective sheath. The rest was a reddish orange and black stripes circled around my body and ran down my arms and legs. A long thin tail with its alternating bands of red-orange and black semi-twitched behind me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no,&quot; I muttered and rushed toward to the mirror that we had in the bedroom.<br />
<br />
What I saw frightened me a little. The fur on the sides of my head and cheeks was larger and wider then Molly's and I could see the pattern of stripes on my own face. They were very different from Molly's. Like Molly, I had white patches of fur above yellow-green eyes, but the black stripe marking there looked like a equilateral triangle pointing down, while Molly's marking above her eyes looked more like the letter &quot;v&quot; pointed down.<br />
<br />
I had only one response to all of that...<br />
<br />
&quot;OH MY GOD!&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The sirens got louder and closer as time went on, which practically gave me a headache as I sat on the floor of the bedroom I shared with Molly. I still loved her and nothing could change that, but the discovery that I had somehow turned into a tiger still puzzled me. I wanted to know how this could happen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why... how...?&quot; I managed as I held out my hands, extending the claws at the tips of my fingers and then retracting them.<br />
<br />
Molly came and sat down beside me.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry, George,&quot; Molly whimpered and moved to hug me, I could feel the soft fur on her breasts press against the fur on my back, &quot;this is all my fault.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No it's not!&quot; I answered back.<br />
<br />
&quot;George, you weren't a tiger when we started,&quot; Molly answered, &quot;I was.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you know this would happen?&quot; I asked her.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Molly said simply.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then that is all that needs to be proved,&quot; I said, &quot;It can't be your fault.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then who could have done it?&quot; Molly asked, still sounding guilty, &quot;for the moment, you and I are the ONLY ones here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know,&quot; I said and tried to turn and hug her back. Once I was successful in doing so, I continued, &quot;but I can't blame you for what's happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you going to do?&quot; Molly asked nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know,&quot; I muttered as the sirens were now deafening and sounded like they were right outside Bandhavgarh Cabin.<br />
<br />
Molly and I both managed to get up. I then snatched up the top sheet off of our bed and began to wrap it around me to cover up everything that wasn't supposed to be seen.<br />
<br />
&quot;You'd best get dressed,&quot; I gave an irritated growl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where are you going?&quot; Molly asked nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;To see what they are after,&quot; I answered and made my way out.<br />
<br />
The increased hearing made the sound of the siren unbearable for me, but I was able to pick up the sound of footsteps approaching the cabin door. As I got closer, I could hear a conversation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do we knock?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do we knock?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do we knock? If the call is correct, she's gone nuts and killed him. Take the battering ram, bash the door in, and we'll go in and blast her to high heaven.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Suppose the call is wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We got several calls of roars, can they ALL be wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Point. Okay, on three. One, two...&quot;<br />
<br />
I then arrived at the door and opened it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Three.&quot;<br />
<br />
The officer slammed the heavy steal battering ram into my gut, taking all the wind out of me, mostly because I'd thought they'd stop when I opened the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooooooouuuuuufffffff,&quot; I grunted as the wind was knocked out of me, making me drop my hold on the blanket I had wrapped around my middle, and I staggered backward.<br />
<br />
The officer with the battering ram also staggered back in surprise, like he didn't expect to run into anyone at the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here he is,&quot; the first officer spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;He?&quot; came a second voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll he's naked,&quot; the first officer responded, &quot;and clearly male.&quot;<br />
<br />
Two officers, each holding shotguns appeared in the doorway, looking at me gasp for breath.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... is... su... som... some... something... wrong...&quot; I wheezed out, trying to catch my breath.<br />
<br />
The two officers aimed their weapons but backed off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where is George Wayne?&quot; the second officer demanded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right... here,&quot; I managed to say.<br />
<br />
The two officers then looked at each other. Then one of them asked the question that had to be on his mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shouldn't the tiger that lives here be female?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;George, are you alright?&quot;  came Molly's voice from upstairs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Could... you... tell... her... I... am... ok?&quot; I asked one of the two officers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your male is fine, ma'am,&quot; the second officer hollered up the stairway, &quot;please come downstairs slowly and with your hands up!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is going on?&quot; I managed to say slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where is George Wayne?&quot; the third officer demanded.<br />
<br />
&quot;I AM George Wayne,&quot; I said with as much emphasis as I could muster.<br />
<br />
All three officers looked at each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;GEORGE!&quot; came Molly's voice, and she came down the stairs as quickly as she could and crouched herself into a hug around me, &quot;what do you want?&quot;<br />
<br />
The second officer put his shotgun barrel to Molly's head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Molly Rhoer, you are under arrest for the murder of George Wayne,&quot; the officer spoke, &quot;you have the right to remain...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'M NOT DEAD! WHAT IS GOING ON?&quot; I roared at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;We got a call a few moments ago saying that they heard roaring come from here and said they were sure George Wayne was being eaten,&quot; the second officer answered, &quot;which is why she is under arrest for murder, and you will be under arrest for being an accessory.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How can I be an accessory to my own murder?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;George Wayne is human,&quot; the third officer spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not anymore, the how I can't explain,&quot; I said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;And supposing I entertain this, can you explain the roars that were heard coming from here?&quot; the second officer demanded.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's our wedding night,&quot; Molly answered, &quot;we were doing what one would expect from a couple of newlyweds on their wedding night.&quot;<br />
<br />
The three officers looked at each other and the two armed officers then turned to third man.<br />
<br />
&quot;Call the boss in,&quot; the second officer spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't move,&quot; the third commanded Molly and I.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
About fifteen minutes later a lone car made its way up the driveway. Shortly thereafter, a lone figure approached. It was Officer Roger Howard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, what is it that has brought me out here this late at night?&quot; Officer Howard grumbled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sir, we have TWO tiger people here, one claims to me Mr. Wayne...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Claims to be?&quot; officer Howard wondered and then approached the doorway where the eyes bugged out of his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, sir,&quot; I said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. Wayne...&quot; officer Howard began.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's who he claims to be,&quot; the second officer answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's who he is,&quot; officer Howard answered, &quot;I recognize his voice...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But he's supposed to be human, we do know that much.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then if you could let me ask a few questions, we can find out,&quot; officer Howard growled at the officer with his battering ram and then turned to the two still holding their shotguns aimed at Molly and me, &quot;Put those away.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But the call...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That Molly went nuts and ate George?&quot; officer Howard growled, &quot;I can see that that call was false here and now. PUT THOSE GUNS AWAY!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;<br />
<br />
Officer Howard then turned back to Molly and I.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, how did this happen?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know, sir,&quot; I said weakly.<br />
<br />
&quot;We just got married today,&quot; Molly added.<br />
<br />
&quot;And well... we were enjoying our wedding night,&quot; I said slowly, &quot;and this just sort of happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can't you explain what caused the transformation?&quot; officer Howard questioned.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't,&quot; I told him, &quot;Molly might be the catalyst for it... but I can't hold her responsible. Whatever caused this... I'd tend to think the ultimate cause was the same freak show that originally transformed Molly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can we figure this out?&quot; officer Howard asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't think anyone here can,&quot; Molly said, &quot;If we could get in touch with the woman that the freak show turned into a lioness. Her name is Leona.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you know where she might be, Ms. ... I means Mrs. Wayne?&quot; officer Howard wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;We haven't head any contact with her since the trial of Eugene Changes,&quot; I spoke, &quot;the only one who might know where she is exactly would be my father.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Where is he?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right now? Asleep at a hotel here, we should see him sometime tomorrow, sir,&quot; I said slowly, &quot;they did that so Molly and I could enjoy our wedding night.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; officer Howard answered, &quot;you have my congratulations, Mr. Wayne. I trust both of you will control yourselves in public?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; Molly and I said together.<br />
<br />
Officer Howard then nodded, &quot;then I'm sorry that your wedding night had to be interrupted by a bunch of people believing the suspicions of a bunch of nincompoops.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;While I have no doubt R.A.M. was ultimately behind this, there isn't much I can prove,&quot; I told him, &quot;and Molly hasn't had much reason to roar all that much before. I'm sure there is some honest person that might have been serious startled by it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure,&quot; officer Howard answered, &quot;I'd suggest that when you return to newlywed activity, you should try to be quiet.&quot;<br />
<br />
I was sure I was blushing, but I don't know if anyone could see it through the fur. Officer Harold then turned to return to his vehicle.<br />
<br />
&quot;And, sir,&quot; I spoke, &quot;my father and I will come down to talk about arranging some &quot;investigation&quot; of this, tomorrow. You'll have to forgive if my attire is odd. At present I'm too big for the clothing I have.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll have someone there to take your new measurements down,&quot; Officer Harold spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll need to make copies of the measurements,&quot; Molly spoke... &quot;or ask if whoever makes your uniforms can make them from silk.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why silk?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It doesn't irritate fur as much as others,&quot; Molly answered, &quot;trust me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They might go for the new size, but silk might be too pricey,&quot; officer Harold informed her, &quot;if you can get it for your private clothing, you could use it as underclothes...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll have to try, I guess,&quot; I sighed, deciding that saying that I'd overheat that would be too much.<br />
<br />
Things had gotten rather tough for us rather quick.</p>
