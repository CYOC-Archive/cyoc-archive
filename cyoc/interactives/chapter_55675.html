<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Did you know that today is my birthday?&quot; Jeremy said angrily, &quot;And <br />
your jerkwad jock buddy Tommy is coming to my birthday party!  His dad <br />
is my dad's boss, so he has to come.  Every year he ruins it.  This <br />
year you're going to help me ruin him!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, master?&quot; is all you can say.  You realize that when asked <br />
something you know the answer.  So while you had no idea it was <br />
Jeremy's birthday, you instantly knew that it was when asked. Just as <br />
you knew that Tommy was invited.  If he had asked you who else was <br />
invited you could have given him a complete list.  As it was, you <br />
checked off the names and faces in your head.  Except for Tommy, the <br />
party was going to be a regular nerd fest.<br />
<br />
&quot;So first, I wish we were safely back in my room, and that your car <br />
was a 1/60th scale model sitting on my dresser.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Done, master.&quot; And it was.  No smoke.  No flash of light. Just <br />
suddenly you weren't in the park, and you were in Jeremy's bedroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa!  That was cool, but a bit disappointing, I thought there'd be a <br />
flash of light and smoke and a whirling sensation while we traveled.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you wish next time I can do that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, that was fine. I'd probably get nauseous if whirled me around. <br />
Okay, first wish, I wish my mirror was a magic mirror that could open <br />
a window to peer into any place on the earth for as long as I want <br />
whenever I command it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As you wish, master,&quot; you say softly. This is a much harder wish and <br />
you tense up and sweat profusely as you concentrate on making it come <br />
true.  You sigh, your shoulders slump, and you  say, &quot;Done, master.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeremy looks at you and then at the apparently unchanged mirror on the <br />
back of his door. You look worse for wear, but the mirror looks just <br />
like it always has.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, mirror, I wish you'd show me Tommy right now!&quot; he ordered.<br />
<br />
Nothing happened.<br />
<br />
&quot;What gives, genie?  This mirror doesn't work!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The mirror will work, you need to be precise, which Tommy, sir?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tommy Dunhill of course!&quot;<br />
<br />
Instantly the reflection in the mirror rippled and suddenly Tommy was <br />
standing there naked washing himself in the shower in his home.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa! Wicked!  Damn, I should have asked to see Ruthann Rogers,&quot; <br />
Jeremy said.<br />
<br />
Instantly, the image shifted again, Ruthann was at beauty salon <br />
getting a facial and highlights in her hair.  A drape covered her <br />
body, tin foil covered her head, and green avocado paste covered her <br />
face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ew! Go back to Tommy Dunhill,&quot; Jeremy ordered.<br />
<br />
Tommy's mouth was moving like he was speaking, but the image was <br />
silent.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish I could hear what was happening like with TV,&quot; Jeremy said.<br />
<br />
You simply nodded your head, and suddenly, the sound of water <br />
splashing against tile and Tommy's singing voice could be heard.<br />
<br />
&quot; - uhh<br />
and the girl caress me down- uhh<br />
and that’s that lovin’ sound- it went uhh<br />
and the girl caress me down- uhh<br />
and that’s that lovin’ sound,&quot; Tommy sang the Sublime song as he <br />
scrubbed his hardened cock.  He looked like he was about to blow his <br />
load.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh great he's jacking off in the shower!&quot; Jeremy bemoaned. Then his <br />
face lit up, &quot;Okay, I wish Tommy cannot cum unless he thinks of hot <br />
naked nerd boys abusing him as their sex slave!&quot;<br />
<br />
Tommy stopped singing.  He began jerking his cock in earnest.  He was <br />
rubbing it red, but he couldn't cum.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha-?&quot; Jeremy asked, and then he understood.  He fell backward on his <br />
bed laughing, &quot;Guess, Tommy may never cum again!  Unless he thinks <br />
about naked nerd boys abusing him! Ha! Oh, that's mean, I guess maybe <br />
I'll just have to help him cum eventually.&quot;<br />
<br />
You can hear the wickedness in Jeremy's voice, and feel sorry for what <br />
awaits your bud Tommy.<br />
<br />
Tommy finally gives up. The water's gotten cold.  He shuts it off, <br />
towels off, and grumpily gets dressed.  He walks downstairs, the <br />
mirror follows his every move like a TV show.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Tommy, ready for Jeremy's birthday soiree?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do I have to go again this year?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Tommy, and you know you'll enjoy it.  You always get some girl <br />
to give you a bj or put out at Jeremy's parties, after all you're the <br />
only real man there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What!&quot; shouted Jeremy hopping out of bed and glaring at the mirror, <br />
&quot;He's been coming to my birthdays since I was 13, and he's been <br />
scoring at all of them?  I haven't even scored once.  Wait, when I was <br />
13 and 14, I only had boys at my party - maybe his dad is <br />
exaggerating,&quot; he sighed with relief.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, last year I did it with two at the same time.  Right in the <br />
nerd's own bedroom,&quot; Tommy said proudly.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Jeremy glared at his bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;But why do I have to go to his party.  He's not even my friend,&quot; <br />
Tommy said looking down at the lifeless bulge in his khakis.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because his father is my best employee.  Your presence makes him <br />
happy and more productive for me.  It also shows your genetic and <br />
hence my genetic superiority to him and his nerd offspring, which <br />
makes him more willing to work for less than he's worth. I haven't had <br />
to give him a pay raise since you started going to his son's stupid <br />
birthday parties.  How else do you think I could afford to send you to <br />
Europe, Australia, Japan, South America and the Caribbean?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Haha, so I'm his annual bonus?  Sick.  I hope his kid enjoys having <br />
me at his parties as much as his father does, cause I sure don't.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, this year you're going to enjoy it, Tommy and so am I!&quot; Jeremy <br />
exclaimed.<br />
<br />
He sat at his desk and started writing.  He was making a list and <br />
checking it twice. In the meantime, Tommy had gotten into his car with <br />
the wrapped gift his father had handed him, and was driving toward <br />
Bristol's.  Bristol's was a sports bar that had a back room where it <br />
served underage jocks like 19 year old Tommy. <br />
<br />
&quot;Genie, I wish Tommy's eyes would automatically drift to guy's <br />
crotches except when he is specifically focusing,&quot; Jeremy said ticking <br />
off an item on his list.<br />
<br />
In less than five minutes, Tommy finished his beer and was back in his <br />
car shaking head.  He looked in his rear view mirror and asked, <br />
&quot;What's happening to me?  I kept staring at guy's bulges! Guess, I'll <br />
go to the party early, maybe I can leave early.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wonder what I'm giving nerd boy this year?&quot; he patted the box.  <br />
Then he grabbed his cell phone and phoned his dad's secretary. <br />
<br />
&quot;Say, Rita, what did ya buy for me to give Jeremy this year?&quot; Tommy <br />
asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;What you said to get him,&quot; she answered grumpily, &quot;A new pocket <br />
protector, a jockstrap, spandex shorts, t-shirt with pocket for the <br />
pocket protector, knee and wrist pads, and an illustrated book on <br />
exercise and men's health, and GNC Gold Card membership.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Perfect. I'll make a jock of him yet. Oh, did you get the extra small <br />
jockstrap?&quot; he asked evilly.<br />
<br />
&quot;They were out,&quot; Rita lied, &quot;I got him an extra large.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, that's even better!&quot; howled Tommy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; said Jeremy even better. He rubbed his hands together.<br />
<br />
&quot;First, let's change the contents of that box.  I think the GNC card <br />
will become a pet license for my new pet ape Tommy Dunhill.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that a wish, master?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Tommy's going to be my new slave. I wish slavery was legal, and <br />
that slaves could be kept as pets and that Tommy's pink slip giving me <br />
free and clear ownership of him is in that package. Oh, and I wish he <br />
was wearing a black leather jockstrap right now instead of boxer <br />
shorts and that it is embroidered in red thread &quot;Property of Jeremy&quot;.<br />
<br />
As he was driving, Tommy jumped in his seat.  He suddenly felt the <br />
fabric of his trousers against his butt, and his cock and balls were <br />
corralled in a tight hot leather pouch. He looked around confused, but <br />
kept driving. <br />
<br />
When Tommy had rung the doorbell and was standing on Jeremy's porch, <br />
Jeremy made another wish.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish the contents of this jar of petroleum jelly was inside Tommy's <br />
rectum right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tommy jumped as he felt something cold and slimy fill his bowels and <br />
leak out his rosebud. The door swung open, and there was Jeremy's <br />
mother.  She was hot.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why hello, Tommy, you're early this year!  Please come in, you're the <br />
first to arrive.  I'll get Jeremy. Just go straight out to the patio <br />
room.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tommy just said &quot;Okay,&quot; and nodded. <br />
<br />
&quot;Honey, your guests are arriving, come on down!&quot; Jeremy's mother <br />
shouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, be down in a minute!&quot; Jeremy answered.<br />
<br />
Tommy felt weird as he walked toward the patio.  He was afraid to sit <br />
down. He was sure he'd ruin his trousers if he did.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, Genie, I wish you were invisible and inaudible to everyone <br />
except me, and I wish that Tommy could only obey me whatever I say or <br />
however he feels about it or me, he will obey me! Oh, and whenever he <br />
sees me or any of my nerd buddies, Tommy will instantly become aroused <br />
- that's part of that wish too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Done, Master,&quot; you say softly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now let's go see my birthday gift!&quot; Jeremy said.<br />
<br />
Jeremy turned on the video camera aiming it at his mirror and the <br />
image of Tommy standing in Jeremy's house.  Then Jeremy ran out of the <br />
room closing the door behind him. You walk through the door following <br />
him like a ghost, and waiting to grant his every wish. He left the <br />
lamp on his bed, you wonder if someone else might become your master <br />
before the night is over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Tommy, so glad you could make it!&quot; Jeremy said as he entered.<br />
<br />
Tommy turned toward Jeremy and instantly he winced.  His cock had <br />
turned rock hard inside its hard leather prison of a jockstrap. The <br />
movement of the bulge was obvious in his tight khaki pants.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like you're glad too,&quot; Jeremy added.<br />
<br />
Tommy blushed and stared at Jeremy's crotch, &quot;Uh, this is for you.&quot; He <br />
thrust the package at Jeremy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gee, thanks. I hope it's a pocket protector, I need another one,&quot; <br />
Jeremy said with a grin.<br />
<br />
Tommy blinked but looked non-plussed. He had a good game face.  Never <br />
let your opponent know what's on your mind.<br />
<br />
Jeremy grinned and added, &quot;You know they make great condom caddies, <br />
keeps my clothing cum-free.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, really?&quot; Tommy replied uncertainly. He kept glancing at Jeremy's <br />
face, but his eyes kept falling to Jeremy's crotch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have a seat, Tommy,&quot; Jeremy said.<br />
<br />
Tommy turned to sit in the overstuffed recliner, but Jeremy said, &quot;Sit <br />
on the wrought iron chair.&quot; He nodded at the ornamental black wrought <br />
iron chair that stood in the far corner of the patio.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; said Tommy as he glared first at the iron chair, then back at <br />
the recliner, and then finally at Jeremy's  crotch.<br />
<br />
He sat down with a plop.  He could feel the petroleum jelly oozing out <br />
of his hole and staining his trouser seat. The strap had tightened the <br />
pouch's grip when he sat, and he now clenched his teeth to control the <br />
pain.  Why was he doing whatever the little dick said?  He didn't want <br />
to sit on the hard metal chair, but here he was sitting there.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's a good, Tommy,so I hear you got lucky at my birthday party <br />
last year?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Tommy said in initial surprise. He gathered his composure and <br />
smiled, &quot;Oh, yeah, I'd almost forgotten. So many chicks, so little <br />
time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not anymore,&quot; Jeremy said, &quot;Now here's a pad of paper and a pen. <br />
Write down the names of each person you got lucky with for each of my <br />
birthday parties, and what you two or three or however many did and <br />
where you did it. List it by party starting with my 13th birthday, and <br />
continuing to last year's.  If you didn't get lucky, just write none.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you kidding? Okay,&quot; Tommy said standing up to take the tablet and <br />
pen that Jeremy handed him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stay seated, and don't speak unless spoken to,&quot; Jeremy ordered.<br />
<br />
Tommy swallowed, but didn't speak.  He sat down gingerly so as not to <br />
crush his cock more than necessary. He found himself staring at <br />
Jeremy's crotch again.  He started to sweat. He turned his focus to <br />
the tablet and started writing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bet there'll be at least 3 nones,&quot; Jeremy muttered to himself as he <br />
carried the package over to the nearly empty present table.  The only <br />
other packages were from his parents and his sister and grandparents.<br />
<br />
The doorbell rang.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, more guests.  Don't get up, Tommy. Just keep writing, I'll answer <br />
the door.  I got it, mom!&quot; Jeremy shouted leaving Tommy alone in his <br />
corner of the patio room.</p>
