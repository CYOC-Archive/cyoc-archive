<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">........toddler’s room!<br />
<br />
It also had a changing table set in a corner in the back of the room to change all of Thomas’s stinky diapers. <br />
<br />
The bed was a Cars themed bed with Lightning McQueen (his favorite Disney character) on the comforter that spread across his toddler bed. <br />
<br />
Thomas was excited to have his own toddler bedroom, one that also had other heroes like the teenage mutant ninja turtles and batman toys and props spread throughout the room. <br />
<br />
Sarah then took Thomas over to his changing table to change his dirty diaper and get him ready for bedtime. She set him down and proceeded to untape his diaper. Thomas giggles as his diaper came off of him and revealed the mess he made to Sarah. “WHOO! You sure made a big poo poo in there Tommy boy!” exclaimed Sarah in a praising manner to Thomas, making him feel giddy and happy that he made poo poo in his diaper. Once Sarah threw away the diaper, she then proceeded to clean him off using baby wipes. She put on gloves too so as to not get poop all over her fingers. Thomas was relieved to have all the poop wiped off of him. <br />
<br />
After that, Sarah threw away her gloves and put on new gloves, making Thomas nervous. “Why do you have gloves on now?” He asked her nervously. “Well I gotta get some Vaseline all over your hiney so you don’t get a rash!” She answered him back. “Ok, will it hurt?” He questioned in a worried manner. Sarah giggled at his question, “No silly! It’ll feel great! But if you’re concerned, why don’t I give you something to calm you down.” She then reached over into a cabinet and pulled out an acrylic jar full of pacifiers, she moved it over to the supply area of the changing table. She reached in and pulled out a pacifier to place in Thomas’s mouth. Thomas wasn’t expecting this as his mouth was left open, so the nipple slid right in without resistance. He was surprised and squirmed a bit, not used to the taste of a latex nipple in his mouth, but his lips and tongue eventually settled around the nipple and he started sucking it. “Feeling better?” Asked Sarah. Thomas simply nodded his head, enjoying the pacifier too much to want to speak. Sarah thought he looked so cute with the shield bobbing up and down around his lips, ‘works just like candy,’ she thought. <br />
<br />
Sarah then reached into the cabinet and pulled out the Vaseline to rub onto Thomas’s crotch and butt cheeks. Thomas looked at her as she moved it to the table, but his thoughts were pre-occupied with sucking his pacifier. Once she set the tub of Vaseline down and opened it, she then took out two fingers full and rubbed them onto her gloved fingers. What came next made Thomas incredibly horny. <br />
<br />
She proceeded to rub his tiny little sac and the area around his crotch a few times to really sunk the Vaseline into his body. Thomas’s little pee pee stood straight up like a flagpole at this reaction. He also moaned a little bit around the nipple in his mouth. Once she was done with the crotch area, she pulled his legs up and proceeded to rub the Vaseline around the sensitive part of his colon. He felt penetrated and helpless at that point, but he kind of liked it too. After that ordeal was over, she then took the gloves off and fetched a clean diaper to put under Thomas. Once she found one and placed it under his bum, she noticed his tiny erection, she laughed too. <br />
<br />
“I don’t think little Tommy is ready for THAT quite yet. You got a ways to go kiddo before that’s done to you.” She lectured to Thomas. He felt dejected, but didn’t have time to react as baby powder was spread all over those same areas and his pee pee too, the only time she touched it was to make sure the powder was tight on there too. Thomas made louder moaning sounds and started sucking his pacifier intensely. Once she finished his backside, she then closed the diaper around his little bum. She then pat the crotch area of the diaper. “Feeling better?” She asked. Thomas again nodded his head more excitedly after his pleasure he received from her. <br />
<br />
Sarah then fetched some pjs for Thomas to wear to bed. She found some with Lightning McQueen on the pj tops to place on Thomas, she fit the pjs on him and the bottoms went snug around his diapered bottom, show a tad bulge to remind everyone that he was a baby now. “There we go little man! All snug as a bug in a rug!” Sarah told Thomas in a motherly manner, “Lets go see how cute you look in the mirror ok?” Thomas giggles around his pacifier and nodded his head excitedly. <br />
<br />
Sarah proceeded to pick him up and take him over to the mirror, Thomas saw his reflection in the mirror with his Cars pjs and the red pacifier in his mouth to match the color of Lightning McQueen. Thomas really enjoyed the toddler that was staring back at him. He missed being this age again. He started sucking his pacifier again as he was being bounced by Sarah in her arms. He enjoyed having her as his mommy for as long as he wants. <br />
