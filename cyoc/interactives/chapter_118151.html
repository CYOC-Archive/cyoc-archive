<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The Seattle FBI Field Office was fairly busy place Saturday Morning as Seattle PD and FBI agents that were collaborating on case relating to the murder of Lionel Ulysses came in for the morning. More often than not, the two agencies didn&#39;t always work so closely together. This often had to do with the fact that more often than not the Seattle PD was dealing with much smaller cases that didn&#39;t often cross jurisdictional boundaries and the FBI was often concerned with the bigger cases that didn&#39;t always cross with the wishes of the local police. Cases that fell into the FBI&#39;s lap were often taken over by the FBI and the Seattle PD would at best be updated on the FBI&#39;s progress with those cases and back up would be called in as needed.<br />
<br />
However, the murder of Lionel Ulysses was something different and something that had ultimately attracted the full attention of BOTH law enforcement agencies. Both wanted him to the point where both were willing to work the case together. It started with the fact that Lionel Ulysses was a fugitive wanted by the FBI for the murder of a Marine Corps officer Jeff Decker. Ulysses had been tracked to Seattle and had been caught there, but had been wounded in the confrontation between the FBI/Seattle PD and the Rat Pack. That had meant that it would take time for Ulysses to be extradited to Virginia to stand trial for the murder, but then Ulysses had been killed while in the hospital and original FBI case came to an end. At first the case was isolated to Seattle, and it was figured that a rival gang had orchestrated the murder.<br />
<br />
Then came the chance identification of their suspect, who they identified as Dymixious. Based off of the files the Seattle PD could find, the man lived outside the city and thus required working with the FBI to investigate Dymixious. They found the FBI all too willing to work with them to make up for being unable to protect Ulysses before the trial and that soon lead to the present partnership as they worked to build a case. However, so far, they hadn&#39;t found anything that would lead to Dymixious&#39;s location, and much of what they had was case building.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have something?&quot; Agent Peters asked to a couple of men that were waiting for her as she and the Seattle PD detectives Holmes and Smith came in to start their day.<br />
<br />
The two men that were waiting for them represented the compromises that the FBI and Seattle PD were making.  One was Dakota Wilson who was in Seattle PD blue and the other was an FBI agent in a suit. Both looked rather tired with heavy bags under their eyes, as though they&#39;d been up all night.<br />
<br />
&quot;I believe we do,&quot; Officer Dakota Wilson said slowly, &quot;Agent Timor and I were up pretty much all night working with the samples taken from Ulysses blood and from the vats you guys confiscated from Dymixious&#39;s home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think more you than me,&quot; the FBI agent, Agent Timor, said with a shrug, &quot;I think I ran out of gas some time in the night...&quot; He then paused to look to Agent Peters and the Seattle PD, &quot;but Officer Wilson did find something out.&quot;<br />
<br />
All eyes turned to Officer Wilson. He gave a small gulp and then spoke carefully.<br />
<br />
&quot;It did took a LOT of checking and wasn&#39;t easy,&quot; Dakota Watson said slowly, &quot;elements Lionel Ulysses&#39; own DNA came off as somewhat... different... but that was likely the result of the &quot;poison&quot; used on Ulysses, but that made analysis on blood samples taken from the body difficult to isolate...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about the vats from his home?&quot; Detective Smith asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was contaminated to a degree by the way it was stored,&quot; Dakota Watson answered slowly, &quot;as though it was mixed with something else, be it some other chemical or poison or whatever had been in those barrel&#39;s previously.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you did isolate the poison?&quot; Detective Holmes asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I managed to isolate the primary poison, yes, though it also took some comparisons to toxicology reports from some local zoos online,&quot; Dakota Watson spoke, &quot;and it&#39;s venom... specifically from the Belcher&#39;s Sea Snake.&quot;<br />
<br />
This raised eyebrows as Agent Peters and the others were all tremendously surprised. This was massive difference from what they&#39;d all initially suspected the poison was when they first examined the barrels that they found that contained venom. Of course, Dakota Wilson did say that the material taken from the barrel was actually a mixture and that the sea snake venom was simply the largest part of the mixture. That probably also meant that that was the only part that the Seattle PD and the FBI&#39;s lab scientists had been able to completely identify. The rest could contain other poisons, toxins, or simply chemicals that could be poisonous, but was simply too mixed up to be identified, yet. However, there was some realization that the rest of the mixture didn&#39;t provide much in the way of options. The sea snake venom, however, had the potential to provide a chance to find this Dymixious given that options that were available for Dymixious to get his hands on the venom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sea snake venom?&quot; Agent Peters said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;d give two possible sources,&quot; Detective Smith said slowly, &quot;either he&#39;s getting it from zoos or he&#39;s farming them in the wild...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;More likely the wild,&quot; Detective Holmes spoke, &quot;this Dymixious doesn&#39;t seem to have the sort of scientific funding for medical experiments and zoos would probably ask a lot of questions if he went to them. And given the AMOUNT we recovered from his home, it&#39;d have to be from the wild as there aren&#39;t enough of those snakes in captivity to milk for that much venom.&quot;<br />
<br />
The others nodded, and Agent Peters soon gave a smile, &quot;that could mean that we have the means to find him. He&#39;d have to know we&#39;re on to him for the murder of Lionel Ulysses and that we&#39;d go to his home to try and find him. It might mean he&#39;s gone to whatever boat he owns...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That could expand the search beyond Washington State, even if his boat is registered here in Seattle,  if he&#39;s left harbor... he could be anywhere,&quot; Detective Holmes warned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then we call in the Coast Guard and call other harbors to see if the boat is there,&quot; Agent Peters spoke, &quot;things may not be easy... but it&#39;s the best potential lead that we have at the moment.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And if we find the boat, but Dymixious isn&#39;t on it?&quot; Detective Smith wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then we&#39;re right back where we started,&quot; Agent Peters gave a frustrated groan, &quot;and we&#39;d need potentially spread the net and alert police departments around Washington, at least, to be on the alert for this Dymixious and to alert us should they have any leads. It isn&#39;t much, but for the moment, it&#39;s the best we have.&quot;</p>
