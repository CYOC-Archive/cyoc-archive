<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As he walked past the hot girl, Alec had an idea. He needed practice with his power and his experience with the harpy had been fascinating.<br />
What if he took, no loaned, the body of a girl. It would provide him with valuable experience in a body unlike his own, while still having the faculties of a human.<br />
All he needed was to make first contact, get his body someplace safe and take over. Actually, this reminded him, he had no place to stay yet.<br />
<br />
Alec walked towards the center of the town until he arrived at the town square. A large fountain was positioned in the middle with kids playing in the water as their parents talked among each other. On the far end Alec spotted a market. He wondered if his ride here was there as well. Along the edge several cafe&#39;s and restaurants were positioned. He also spotted an inn. A simple building with large double doubles. &quot;The cheap eagle&quot; A large wall mounted sign read, behind the curly lettering was a picture of bird holding a wallet. Presumably of an eagle, but whoever drew this probably didn&#39;t get much work in the art department. &quot;Well, you can&#39;t argue with a name like that.&quot; Alec said to himself.<br />
He went in and rented a small room on the first floor, the money he&#39;d made was more than sufficient to hold this room for about a week while still having enough to spend on supplies. But he was going to have to go out on missions more often if he wanted to make something of his life here.<br />
The room he&#39;d received was indeed small and simple. A bed and a bathroom. But at least the room was in good condition.<br />
<br />
Alec left the inn and stood on the city center. Now he just needed someone. He sat down on one of the benches near the fountain and looked around for someone suitable.<br />
He didn&#39;t have to wait long. The girl he spotted at the wizards guild, easily recognizable by the bright blue hair came walking away from the market. She was holding a large bag. Even better, she seemed to be walking towards the inn.<br />
Alec got up and took the long way around the fountain as he walked towards the inn on an intercept course.<br />
However he was too far away. There was no way to bump into her from here without coming across like some desperate and creepy stalker. He needed a different plan. He watched as she went into the inn. He then hurried into a cafe, ordered a coke and quickly left again.<br />
He stood by with his drink in hand, near the corner of his inn. He could just see through the window, so he would have an early warning.<br />
It took at least another half our before he spotted her again. She was on the move.<br />
<br />
With a brisk pace, drink in hand Alec walked across the building. Just as he was about to enter the door, the girl came walking out. With a thump they slammed into each other. Alecs drink flew through the air, splattering them both with the dark liquid. As they stumbled back, his cup clattered on the ground.<br />
&quot;Ugh sorry.&quot; Alec said, this was not is best plan. This hurt, she was pretty strong.<br />
&quot;Watch where you&#39;re going!&quot; the girl shouted at him agitated. &quot;Crap, look at me, I&#39;m drenched!&quot;<br />
Alec was looking alright. He loved those firm curves. &quot;I&#39;m so sorry. Can I make it up somehow? I sleep here, maybe I can get you a towel?&quot;<br />
&quot;Ugh, yuck. I hate this sweet crap. I need to get changed.&quot; she gasped.<br />
&quot;Maybe I can wash your clothes?&quot; As he said that, he internally winced, he sounded like a creep. &quot;I&#39;m really sorry.&quot;<br />
The girl looked at him, she was still fuming. &quot;Ugh, fine you can wash my top. What room are you in?&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m in room 111. Just knock, I need a fresh set of clothes as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
Together they walked in. &quot;What&#39;s your name?&quot; Alec asked as they walked up the stairs.<br />
&quot;Amber.&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Alec.&quot; He said, and quickly added &quot;I&#39;m really sorry.&quot;<br />
&quot;Stop apologizing. Accidents happen. It just sucks. This is my room, I&#39;ll drop by in a bit.&quot; She said and went in. <br />
Alec looked at the number. &quot;101&quot; He smiled.<br />
<br />
Alec hurried back to his room. He jumped on his bed, grabbed a pillow and put it on the floor near the door.<br />
He then went into the bathroom and ran some water while taking his shirt off. He really needed to go shopping for more clothes.<br />
Someone knocked on his door. He had to suppress a massive grin, he was so giddy with anticipation. With large steps he walked to the door and opened it. <br />
Amber had changed clothes. Her top was changed into a more loose fitting low cut sweater, but she still wore the same skirt.<br />
She held out her top. &quot;Here.&quot;<br />
Alec held out his hand. &quot;Possession.&quot; <br />
The light enveloped them and immediately Alec was staring at his own body, which slumped back. He threw away the top he was holding and grabbed his old body&#39;s wrist. His old body felt surprisingly light, but the sudden weight shift in a new body pulled him off balance. And together he and his old body fell down. He winced when he heard the thud of his head hitting the floor. He was going to feel that later.<br />
He landed on top of his old body and immediately became aware of his breasts between them. <br />
He quickly got up and closed the door.<br />
<br />
He looked down at Ambers body. Her hands were smaller than his. She felt strong though, he was afraid of looking up her stats. He ran her smaller hands over her chest. He could feel her large breasts both with his hands and with her breasts. He could feel the bra containing them. He gave them a squeeze. So soft, it felt nice. <br />
He then ran his hands further down, across her hips and shapely firm ass. <br />
His own body was still on the ground.</p>
