<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the two came for the second time in a minute, Ryan leaned his head back in ecstasy, breaking the kiss with Josh. His face began to grow out and a growl rumbled in his throat. A loud canine bark erupted from his mouth, followed by a second. He felt Josh&#39;s hands stop roaming his body, coming to rest on his arm and hip. He bit his lip and looked sheepishly at Josh, who was eyeing him with a mix of curiosity and lust. <br />
<br />
&quot;Heh…sorry, man, I don&#39;t mean to kill the mood. I have no idea where that sound came from. It just...happened, it felt right. Just...maybe don&#39;t tell Alexis about this?&quot;<br />
<br />
Josh&#39;s hand slid down Ryan&#39;s hip and over to where his friend&#39;s cock bulged. He looked Ryan in the eye as he began giving him a hamdjob through his pants. &quot;I think that was fucking hot, man. I feel it too, like I just...I want to...BAA-AAA-AAA!&quot; He threw his head back and a bleat escaped his lips as his face began pressing forward as well, the cleft on his upper lip deepening as small nubs of horn sprouted from his head and peeking through his hair. When his head came back down, Ryan&#39;s lips met his and they locked in another long kiss. Josh broke it just long enough to say &quot;I won&#39;t tell Alexis if you don&#39;t&quot; before resuming the kiss hungrily. Ryan&#39;s hand wandered down to find Josh&#39;s throbbing dick and reciprocate the handjob. Josh walked Ryan back against the wall as their passions intensified. Within seconds they were moaning into each other&#39;s mouths again as they brought each other to another orgasm and their frantic pumping slowed to tender, almost luxuriant stroking. <br />
<br />
&quot;Jesus, dude,&quot; Ryan said. &quot;I don&#39;t know what&#39;s happening to us, but it feels pretty great.&quot;<br />
<br />
Josh grinned. &quot;Oh, just waa-AAA-ait. I&#39;m not done with you yet.&quot; <br />
<br />
He grabbed Ryan&#39;s shirt and ripped it open like it was made of tissue paper. The hair on his chest and belly was thickening into tan fur. He took a sharp intake of breath as he ran his fingers through it. He leaned down and sucked gently on Ryan&#39;s nipple. He flicked his tongue over the bullet-hard nub, moaning as he felt Ryan grab his growing horns and pull his head close against his chest in encouragement. Then he felt Ryan gently but firmly nudge his head lower. He licked his lips, a soft bleat rolling from his mouth as he went to his knees and pulled Ryan&#39;s pants and underwear down. More fur here, too, tan blending into black at the border of Ryan&#39;s abs and inner thighs. Ryan&#39;s cock sprang free, red and hard, precum drooling from its tapered tip. Josh took the turgid member in hand and felt a drip of fluid land on his nose. He looked up at Ryan. His friend&#39;s nose was black and his face had grown into a definitively canine muzzle. His mouth was hanging open, showing teeth that were growing into fangs. His tongue was hanging out of his mouth and another bit of drool dripped down. <br />
<br />
&quot;I think you&#39;re--baa-AAA-AAA! Turning into a dog or something, dude. <br />
<br />
Ryan looked down at Josh, whose hair and beard were now white and blended into fur that accentuated his caprine snout and lengthening ears. &quot;Complaining, goat boy?&quot;<br />
<br />
Josh didn&#39;t say a word. He met Ryan&#39;s gaze with a look of desire and smiled. He leaned in and licked the tapered head, delighting in the musky scent and salty taste. Then he took the head into his mouth and sucked. Ryan held his grip on Josh&#39;s horns, encouraging his ministrations. Josh fondled his balls and bobbed his head up and down his throbbing shaft, never breaking eye contact. He moaned around the member as he reached down to pull his own cock free. <br />
<br />
Ryan growled in approval. &quot;I&#39;ll take that as a no.&quot;<br />
<br />
Josh swirled his tongue around Ryan&#39;s cockhead and reached two fingers back behind his balls to fondle his taint. He felt Ryan&#39;s grip on his horns tightened a bit. He watched in fascination as tiny nubs of black flesh grew and peeked out from under the fur of Ryan&#39;s torso. Three rows of two...more nipples? Kinky...he&#39;d have to give them a bit of attention, too. But another time. Right now he had his mouth around the bigger prize He reached his fingers further back and up, running his fingertips over Ryan&#39;s asshole in circles, pressing gently and stopping shy of penetration. The grip on his horns tightened again, and now he felt Ryan pressing back against his fingers. He could swear Ryan was also making a dog-like whine at his teasing. He pressed his fingers in, hooking them around to stimulate his prostate. His efforts were soon rewarded as Ryan&#39;s dick pulsed and filled his mouth with fresh spurts of cum. <br />
<br />
Ryan threw his head back again in a barking howl as Josh fingered his ass and sucked him off. His face grew into a long canine muzzle and fur sprouted all over his body, giving him black and tan coloration. His nails grew into blunt claws and pads grew on his fingers and palms as he gripped Josh&#39;s horns. He felt a tail sprout from the base of his spine as his ears lengthened and shifted position on his head. His shoes split apart at the seams as his feet bulged, turning into large canine paws as his transformation into a muscular anthro doberman was completed. He looked down at Josh, who was still jerking off and sucking on his member like a popsicle, trying to coax out every last drop of cum. <br />
<br />
Ryan&#39;s dick slipped free as Josh leaned his head back and bleated, a string of cum and saliva hanging between his lip and the tapered tip of the canine cock. Josh&#39;s own dick erupted as he fervently pumped it, launching ropes of jizz into the air that spattered both infected lovers. A short tail wriggled to life in his pants, finding a rip in the fabric to poke through as the shaggy white fur covered his body. His shoes also tore open as his feet grew and warped, transforming into black cloven hooves. His fingernails thickened likewise into hard black masses. <br />
<br />
The new anthro mountain goat rose up onto his hooves. Ryan now stood a few inches shorter than Josh, and had to look up to meet his eyes as he ran his claws through his white fur and felt the bulk of his musclebound chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was incredible,&quot; he growled. <br />
<br />
Josh leaned down and kissed him again. Ryan moaned as he delighted in the taste that he realized must be his own cum still lingering on Josh&#39;s tongue. He felt himself getting hard again and ground himself against Josh&#39;s muscular thigh. <br />
<br />
Josh broke the kiss and looked down at Ryan with a look of unabated desire. &quot;I just fucking wanted you, man. I&#39;ve never felt that way about another guy before. I just had to get my lips around that cock of yours and feel you blow your load in my mouth and slurp all that cum down.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryan kissed him again and reached down for his cum-slicked goat cock. He found it hard and ready, and began humping it. He felt a thrill rush through him as he frotted his friend, a thrill that intensified when Josh moaned into his kiss. He pulled back, panting with freshly renewed arousal. &quot;I fucking want you too, man.<br />
<br />
Josh broke out of the embrace and divested himself of the ruined remains of his pants and shoes. He leaned up against the wall with his hands, his ass pointed out, his tail up, the black pucker of his asshole peeking out from his shaggy white fur. He shot Ryan a smoldering look as his tail flicked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Show me.&quot;</p>
