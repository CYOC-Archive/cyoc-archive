<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rick couldn't believe his luck. Seven months ago he was accused of raping a 13 year old girl. Four months later a jury had found him guilty of the crime, a crime he didn't commit. Now here he was in the courtroom again for his sentencing. At least he would be out of prison. While he was in there he had feared for his life. One inmate awaiting trial had actually raped him and was choking him. Fortunately a guard stopped it before he died. he was glad that the justice system used Card Fighters as sentencing for all but the most heinous of crimes. For those they still had the death penalty.<br />
<br />
The bailiff came in and said &quot;All rise. The Honorable Katherine S. Davis presiding.&quot;<br />
<br />
Judge Davis came in and sat at the bench. After a moment she said &quot;You may be seated. The defendant will remain standing.&quot; After everyone else had sat down she continued &quot;Mr. Poole, you have been found guilty of rape, inappropriate contact with a minor, and causing bodily harm in the commission of a felony by a jury of your peers. Is there anything you would like to say before I pass sentence?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There is your Honor&quot; Rick said. &quot;I did not rape that girl. I hadn't even seen her before the trial.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that all?&quot; Judge Davis said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is your Honor&quot; Rick said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well&quot; Judge Davis said. &quot;Mr. Poole, for your crimes you are hereby sentenced to spend the next 50 years as a Fighter. Your gender will be changed to female and your age will be changed to 13 years old. I will allow you to choose your new name. Sentence will be carried out immediately. You may have a few moments with your family before sentence is carried out however. This court is adjourned.&quot; She pounded the gavel and rose.<br />
<br />
Everyone started to file out of the courtroom except for Rick's family. His mom and dad were there as well as his 28 year old younger brother and 13 year old younger sister. Rick was 20 when his parents had his sister. his family believed him that he didn't rape that girl but they seemed to be the only ones.<br />
<br />
Rick's mom hugged him and said &quot;Don't worry Rick. We'll find some way to get your conviction overturned.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks Mom but it won't be easy&quot; Rick said. &quot;I just wonder how they got my DNA when I never touched that girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is a problem&quot; Rick's dad said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you were set up&quot; Rick's brother David said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Someone did&quot; Rick said. &quot;The only question is who.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll try and buy you Rick&quot; Rick's sister Katherine said. &quot;I just need to know what your name will be.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I appreciate that Kathy&quot; Rick said. &quot;I'm going to go with Elisabeth.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's a good name&quot; Rick's mom said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry to break this up but I need to take him now&quot; the bailiff said as he approached.<br />
<br />
&quot;We hope to see you soon&quot; Rick's mom said with tears in her eyes as Rick was led away.<br />
<br />
The bailiff escorted Rick to a room where he would be turned into a Fighter. He was instructed to stand in a circle while the bailiff picked up a Capture card.<br />
<br />
As the bailiff looked at the card he said &quot;Do you really believe that you're innocent?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I do&quot; Rick said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just can't see how you can be&quot; the bailiff said. &quot;For some strange reason though, I believe you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're one of the few that do&quot; Rick said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right now I really don't like my job&quot; the bailiff said. &quot;I have a duty to carry it out however.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand&quot; Rick said. &quot;I don't blame you. I don't blame Judge Davis. I don't blame anyone on the jury. They did their best with the evidence provided. Will you make sure to tell them that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll make sure&quot; the bailiff said. &quot;Now I need to know what your name will be.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I want it to be Elisabeth&quot; Rick said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok&quot; the bailiff said as he held the blank face of the card toward Rick. he took a deep breath and said &quot;Capture now.&quot; A beam of white light emerged from the card and struck Rick, obscuring his vision. The bailiff then said &quot;Elisabeth, 13 years.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick started to feel a little funny as soon as the bailiff said those words. Teeth that he had lost grew back in. His slight gut shrank until it was flat. He started to shrink after a couple of seconds. As he shrunk he could feel his body hair thin. He had to hold up his pants now since they were loose and no longer fit him. He could tell that he was now the same height he was when he was 13. The changes didn't stop there however.<br />
<br />
Rick shrank a little bit more. He felt his scalp tingle as his hair grew out to his middle back and changed to blond like his sister's. He felt his whole body become slender like a girl's. His waist narrowed a bit more than the rest of his body. His hips didn't become as slender leaving him with a slight hourglass shape. He felt a weight start to form on his chest that didn't stop until he had B-cup breasts. He felt his penis and balls suddenly pull up into his body. It was a weird sensation as his internal organs changed to that of a girl. He felt the area between his legs tingle and after it stopped he knew that he was a girl.<br />
<br />
Rick's clothes changed next. His shirt and pants fuses together while his pants legs split open along the inseam and fuse back together with the opposite side forming the bottom of a dress. His fly fused with the rest of his pants leaving an unbroken dress. The bottom shortened until it was just below his knees and the whole thing changed color. It became white with pink edges at the sleeves, neck, and hem. Five pink hearts appeared over his left breast. He felt his underpants shrink and change into panties while a bra formed around his new breasts. His socks became ankle socks while his shoes became more feminine. The turned white with pink piping and pink laces. Of course his clothes shrank while they were changing so they would fit him. He felt a sudden pinching as a pair of pink crystal stud earrings appeared in his ears.<br />
<br />
Suddenly Rick felt himself jerked forward and pressed flat. He couldn't breath and he started to panic. In his panic he tried to move but found that he couldn't. His vision cleared and he could see the circle that he was standing in, empty now that he was a Fighter.<br />
<br />
Rick was flipped around to face the bailiff. &quot;Well you make a cute girl&quot; the bailiff said looking at him. At least he could still hear and see but that seemed to be about all he could do.<br />
<br />
The bailiff put Rick in a machine on a table. As he passed through it a bar of red light passed over him. he figured that this was to lock his card so he couldn't be released by anyone. When he came out the other side of the machine the bailiff picked him up and said &quot;I have to send you to the card store now. I hope that your family buys you Elisabeth, I really do. Either way, take care of yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
The bailiff put Rick into an envelope to ship him. In the ensuing darkness he thought 'Well, this isn't what I expected. I guess I should call myself Elisabeth now that I am a girl. I might as well get used to this as I'll be this way for a long time to come. I hope that Kathy is the one to buy me. If not, I hope that whoever does is nice.'<br />
