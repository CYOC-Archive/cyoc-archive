<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff had a million ideas flit across his mind, the newest game console and games, decking out his room, he could have his very own pokemon... after a second he decided he wanted an awesome tech friendly backpack with built in battery pack and bluetooth speakers that&#39;s waterproof, comes with its own umbrella and thermos. He clicked the button but immediately continued jumping from topic to topic. After about 20 seconds of scanning, the Chronivac could not read a thought in enough detail to create anything... so its backup measures kicked in forcing him to focus.<br />
<br />
He had just thought of how nice an ice cream sundae would be, flipped to how that would make him fat, and that made him think of those fitness shake commercials. The Chronivac&#39;s effect was immediate. All he could think about was a fitness shake and what his imaginary version of that would be. They have a shake for everything, weight loss, muscle gain, general well being... what if it was all in one? And what if it worked? Phrases jumped into his head &quot;Kickstart your metabolism and loose excess weight&quot;, &quot;Set your body up to get the most idealized version of yourself.&quot;, &quot;Like a full body workout with every sip.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jeff even saw a commercial of his imaginary product advertising that, &quot;No diet or exercise is necessary, just listen to your body!&quot; He imagined testimonials where average people get bodies worthy of personal trainers. Most slimmed down, all bulked up some, though the men much more than the women. <br />
<br />
Jeff imagined the science jargon and how it &quot;hijacks your body&#39;s biochemical network to get these Amazing! results by optimizing your hormones and nutrients in just 7 days with no complex meal or exercise plan, Just one drink, one time, and your journey begins! Just 36 easy payments of 99.99!&quot; <br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s focus slowly came back to reality a few moments had passed. &quot;Pfft, as if.&quot; he chuckled to himself before realizing  there was a 1 liter bottle next to his hand, branded as &quot;Hijacked&quot; with all the same advertisements he had just imagined. &quot;Your new you is just this bottle away...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No flippin&#39; way&quot; Jeff muttered as he carefully inspected the bottle. He opened the lid and took a sip. it tasted like water. He never imagined the taste, just the results. The instructions advised to drink it all within an hour for best results, so he chugged half of it before feeling full and releasing a tremendous belch. Jeff went to the bathroom and when he came back forced himself to drink the rest.<br />
<br />
Jeff had been putting off his homework and began working on it. Evening came and after dinner, Jeff realized he was exhausted but couldn&#39;t understand why... he had wanted to stay up to watch his favorite show, and play on the chronivac more before school tomorrow but was nodding off in his computer chair. It was 6:45 and Jeff dragged himself to his bed not even having the strength to undress or get under the covers.<br />
<br />
Jeff awoke with a start, he was starving. It was dark out but he went to bed early so getting up a bit early isn&#39;t a surprise. He went downstairs and made himself some cereal, having 3 bowlfuls before he began to feel satisfied. He still wanted something but couldn&#39;t figure out what. Going to the cabinet he looked around, eventually his eyes fell on the jar of peanut butter and he had to have it. He scooped out 6 huge tablespoons and put it in his empty cereal bowl and filled the spoon before replacing the cover and putting the previously unopened, but now a third gone, jar back in its place.<br />
<br />
Jeff realized this was weird because he usually didn&#39;t care much for peanut butter, except in peanut butter cups, which sounded gross to him now. As he finished his bowl he rinsed it and was again tired. Jeff looked to the clock dreading the idea of having to go to school. it was only 1:13 am, he still had time, he crawled back to bed, each step feeling like a huge exertion and immediately fell back asleep, again in his clothes.<br />
<br />
Jeff awoke slowly to realize his mother was by his bed... &quot;Hey, are you feeling okay, honey?&quot; I&#39;ve been calling you for the last 45 minutes and even shook you but you didn&#39;t wake up. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yea mom, I&#39;m just exhausted&quot; Jeff said falling back asleep.<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s mom pondered her son&#39;s strange behavior.. She had noted that he was in bed by 7:30 and decided to call him out of classes for the day. He must be sick she reasoned. The last time she tried to work through the flu it lasted two and a half weeks because she didn&#39;t rest, a mistake she wouldn&#39;t make again for herself or her children. She left a note and briefly wondered where the bowl in the sink came from, but was running late. She had pulled a can of food out and put it on the counter top and pulled some sandwich supplies to the front of the fridge in case Jeff feels hungry. A mother&#39;s work is never done.<br />
<br />
Jeff slowly awoke shortly after 10, the house was eerily quiet. He felt disoriented and movement was weird, like when cold and cough syrup kicks in. He looked at the time and realized he was missing school. He blinked slowly several times feeling like he must be dreaming, everything is so far out of the ordinary.<br />
<br />
He changed out of yesterday&#39;s clothes and threw on some basketball shorts  and grabbed a clean t-shirt. Groggily he made his way to the kitchen to find a note from his mother saying she called him out of school, directing him to sources of food, and to feel better soon. <br />
<br />
Jeff felt a rage build, how dare his mother imply that he can&#39;t find food on his own? The indignity of it! In two short years he will be a full grown adult and will get to fend for himself! Maybe he doesn&#39;t want to eat... Jeff picked up the can... mini raviolis... (he did, it was one of his favorites). Jeff set the can down and growled in frustration and stomped off to the bathroom.<br />
<br />
After a moment he realized that he was being completely unfair and was confused as to why he was so angry. Jeff loves and appreciates his mom, she thought he was sick and tried to make his life easier, what&#39;s so terrible about that?<br />
<br />
&quot;I can do it myself.&quot; the bitter and resentful reply came from somewhere in his mind. &quot;So what? You don&#39;t have to and that&#39;s nice.&quot; Jeff thought back putting the topic to rest.<br />
<br />
Flipping on the bathroom light he caught sight of himself. Much to his horror and dismay, between last night and this morning his body kicked into overdrive with oil production and his face was breaking out. With a groan he jumped into the shower.<br />
<br />
After bathing he went to the mirror and ruthlessly attacked every zit he could find. To his surprise, most were ready to pop, and yesterday his skin was clear. Being a teenager sucks.<br />
<br />
Now almost 11 he was ready for food. He went back to the kitchen and started the ravioli, while waiting for it to heat up he went after the sandwich supplies, skipping the bread. He had 3 glasses of milk, which mostly emptied the gallon. His hunger unabated he found himself going after the peanut butter again which seemed to be the only thing dense enough to satisfy.<br />
<br />
With a loud belch, food no longer being an immediate need he began to feel claustrophobic in the house. With his mom thinking he was sick, he wont be able to get out of the house tonight. At best she would call it the 24 hour flu, at worst she would think he had played her.<br />
<br />
Jeff didn&#39;t have a car, or a job, so there was little he could do on his own besides a walk to the park, which wasn&#39;t a terrible option. So Jeff got a jacket on and began his trek. It was a sunny day in the beginning of fall, the temperature was chilly but still warming up. It has been getting up to 60. Jeff found himself at the local park and was reminded that a few short years ago he could play on all the equipment here, but now all he is left with are the swings.<br />
<br />
The park was empty, so Jeff spent a few minutes on the swings but quickly grew antsy. The swings weren&#39;t really engaging his muscles as he had wanted and looking around, none of the equipment would... Jeff noticed the swings were made for adults, reaching 15 feet high and making a huge triangle to support the structure. On a whim, Jeff tried to touch both poles at the same time, but couldn&#39;t.<br />
<br />
Could he climb one pole and then grab the other? Could he make it to the top? Only one way to find out! Jeff struggled and climbed and worked himself to exhaustion, but felt good about it. He walked home feeling satisfied and tired.<br />
<br />
Getting home his body craved a snack so he finished off the sandwich supplies and had some bread by itself... a deconstructed sandwich...</p>
