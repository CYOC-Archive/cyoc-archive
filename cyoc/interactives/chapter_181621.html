<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">An old memory must&#39;ve been dislodged from the innermost reaches of Selicia&#39;s mind as she hadn&#39;t thought about this one since she came up on her own. She was older in this dream, much more confident and stable with her bouts magic and emotion. Still she lived as apprentice to her Mistress, her name... Her name was... Her name was Helena Ironrose... It was buried so deeply within Selicia&#39;s memories now that almost forgotten it entirely, she couldn&#39;t be blamed for it really... Considering just how it had all come apart.<br />
<br />
It was an ordinary morning of waking up early in the morning to practice somantics and control as usual. The knock came at the door about three sets in and Selicia watched Mistress Helena approach the door with overly characteristic swagger. Helena opened the door and adopted a pose of sheer confidence with a derisive smirk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why, Hello Dear Abernathy~ What brings you to my humble home? Hmm?&quot; Helena stood her ground at the doorway without so much as a shift in her stance as the voice spoke from the other side.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it not enough to say that I was in the area and thought to drop by?~&quot; The voice spoke smoothly with an air of grace and arrogance. As Helena stepped back to allow the visitor entry, Abernathy stepped through and Selicia saw her for the first time. Wearing a dress fit for a noble&#39;s ball, Abernathy easily felt a match for Selicia&#39;s Mistress. Her pale complexion and long hair ending in tight curls, even as Selicia observed her, Abernathy had already shot a sly glance her way.<br />
<br />
Seated with Abernathy and Helena, Selicia watched as carefully veiled barbs were shot between the two of them. More than once a simple wisp a spell covertly slid toward one or the other and dissipated before it had any effect. Selicia almost missed one sliding from Abernathy to her and it took a bit more power to deflect than she&#39;d have thought. It was then that she was struck by the stronger wisp she failed to notice because of the first. While the exchange continued in front of her, Abernathy spoke directly to Selicia&#39;s mind in a calm and respectful manner.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... Selicia, is it? Ah, forgive... I did just a little bit of prying. Anyways, I see your time with Helena has been quite fruitful. She really is a spectacular teacher isn&#39;t she?&quot; Abernathy continued hurling remarks while maintaining a casual conversations with both Helena and Selicia. &quot;Do you know quite how many apprentices she&#39;s had in the past?~&quot; The question came with a sweet bait to tempt the curiosity right out of Selicia. &quot;Look around you, she&#39;s got quite the art collection doesn&#39;t she?&quot;<br />
<br />
It was true, Selicia had a few favorites among them from a beautiful statue in the corner to the painting that was hung in her very room. The question brought to mind with it various scenes of struggling young mages doing their best against overwhelming odds. Some of them she recognized from or as suggested by the visions being the art pieces. Helena had defeated each and every one of them collecting what she had made from them as a trophy. Selicia mentally shook the images away as to not draw attention from Helena.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, I overstep my bounds again~ You see, I was there for a number of their ends and I just shared what I saw with you. Tell me, how much longer do you think you have before she does the same to you? I see it in you, you know. You&#39;ll be a match for her very soon and when you are... Well, you&#39;ll look lovely upon the mantle~&quot; A smirk appeared on Abernathy&#39;s face as she shot another knowing glance at Selicia. Another line of magic had followed that glance toward Selicia before Helena herself blocked it. &quot;I have to keep up appearances, I do apologize for the threats your way. Ah but, now I get to the meat of the topic. I&#39;m willing to assist you in taking down your Mistress~&quot;<br />
<br />
The implication struck Selicia like a bolt of lightning, it seemed by the now obvious signs about the room and suggestion of Abernathy that she was in danger. Now Helena was cast in a more malign light as she had been slowing lessons as of late. Could that mean what Abernathy had said about her was true, was she closer to the two of them than she knew? Before she could continue her considerations, Abernathy continued with her offer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, you might still be a little rough around the edges but, I&#39;ll be more than happy to take care of the larger portion of her territory until your ready for it~ All you have to do is agree and we&#39;ll set the date for your ascension. What do you say?&quot; The smile behind those words was felt rather than seen as it seemed Helena and Abernathy were wrapping up their banter. Without much time to decide, Selicia signed upon the line of fate that would lead her to her future.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes...&quot;<br />
<br />
Within a few days, Helena had taken Selicia to a grove clearing for more practical training in precision targeting. Her nerves were strung out by this day, she had planned with Abernathy to remove Helena very soon. Abernathy had said that Selicia couldn&#39;t know exactly when or she might doom the attempt by springing to soon. Just as she made to target another stone on a nearby stump, the bolt of magic had skimmed past her leaving some residual effect on her. It seemed to make her chest fill out enough to make her bust-line uncomfortable. The bolt continued until it was dashed apart by Helena.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is this the reason for your visit, Abernathy? You&#39;ve come, hungry for more territory, to take mine from me?&quot; Helena pointed a general direction away from where the bolt had trailed out from and sent one of her own in that direction. &quot;Have you forgotten that it was I who struck the final blow to our Mistress? What makes you feel you could even attempt to defeat me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Abernathy stepped from the shadows of the trees wearing a traveling outfit and a sneer. &quot;Because my Dear Sister, I haven&#39;t come alone~&quot; Two more young women roughly Selicia&#39;s age stepped out from the woods effectively surrounding Helena. &quot;As you can see I brought more than just the one apprentice you&#39;ve just dispatched.&quot; A small lump could be seen at the edge of the trees where the bolt from Helena had traveled. &quot;Now, be a good sister and fall for me~&quot;<br />
<br />
With that the battle was on in earnest, bolts, lines, and hazes of magic were strewn through the clearing. Selicia had to dodge more than a couple to keep herself safe, even returning the favor in two instances. She had been mentally advised to save her power and that the spells were intended to be close but not strike her. Still instincts had screamed and she couldn&#39;t help except to defend herself. Another one the apprentices Abernathy had brought had fallen as she sank into a pile of her robes and moved no more. Still the castings waged on scoring the landscape with various interesting shapes and forms, even a few tradition gouges and craters.<br />
<br />
Another line of magic and another apprentice was thwarted as the were nothing more than a marble statue tastefully posed without its robes. Now it was down to a duel between Abernathy and Helena, the latter of which hadn&#39;t seemed to slow down despite the odds. Just as Selicia became rapt in the display before her, the mental command came and before she realized it she shot a bolt with everything she could muster straight at Helena&#39;s back. At the same time, Abernathy had sent her own larger bolt toward Helena causing her to defend with her all against it. Selicia&#39;s bolt struck Helena hard in her back and a momentary falter caused her to become pincered by the remains of Abernathy&#39;s.<br />
<br />
Expecting a change similar to the three apprentices, Selicia paused before approaching Helena. Coming closer to her Mistress, she heard her quickened and shallow breaths coming louder and faster. She wouldn&#39;t have believed what she saw if it had been just days before. Helena had lifted the tattered cloth of her dress and torn open its neckline. There she sat fingers deep in her vagina grasping her left breast tightly as she moaned in absent arousal. Before Selicia could say anything, Helena started bucking her hips trying to get her fingers deeper inside herself as the arousal seemed to intensify.<br />
<br />
Something prodded Selicia in her side as Abernathy appeared next to her with a small cylindrical object. Taking it from Abernathy as she was prompted, she saw it was a small woman having been turned to stone with a purpose well suited to the occasion. &quot;Go ahead, give it to her~&quot; The sadistic glee oozed from Abernathy&#39;s tone as she imperiously stood over the increasingly desperate Helena. Even though she had told Selicia to, Abernathy stopped her before she gave the toy over to Helena, who let go of her breast to reach for it. &quot;No no, make her beg for it~&quot;<br />
<br />
Selicia retracted her hand just as Helena swiped clumsily for the toy rolling over from the off balance attempt. There lay Helena, her Mistress, breasts grinding into the packed earth of the clearing as she rocked herself desperately. Drool rolled off of her tongue as she became further lost in her search for sensual release. That was when a part of Selicia normally held in check around Helena surged to the surface, a tiding of what was to come. A ruthless grin with a downcast domineering gaze was born on Selicia&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t believe you&#39;ve earned earned the privilege, my dear~&quot;<br />
<br />
Helena howled in dismay at the denial, her mind scattered by her incessant need as pleas welled up in her eyes. Crawling toward Selicia on her belly dragging her breasts across the hard ground, inch by inch as she left a wet trail behind her. Clutching Selicia&#39;s dress, she pleaded nonsensically to her grasping for the toy that Selicia repeatedly pulled away from her. All the while, Abernathy watched over them seeming to enjoy this moment far more than even Selicia was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do you give her some tasks to complete to earn her prize, Selicia?&quot; Abernathy&#39;s malign grin only grew with each word, her arms crossed as she snidely observed the scenario.<br />
<br />
Selicia considered the possibilities as she felt something wet stroking her inner thigh. Lost in her passions, Helena had resorted to slowly running her out stretched tongue up Selicia&#39;s right thigh. Her hot breath puffing against Selicia&#39;s tender skin. There was an idea, Selicia laid out on the ground before Helena and lifted her skirt. &quot;Please me then, if you want to have your toy~&quot; Helena hastily leapt forward and buried her face between Selicia&#39;s legs, her tongue soaking and lapping the fabric. &quot;Now now... Take them off first~&quot; Selicia pushed the eager Helena back to look her in the eyes before letting her go. Helena&#39;s hands shot forward and were thwarted by Selicia&#39;s own hand getting in the way. &quot;With your teeth, Dear~&quot;<br />
<br />
Gently until the offending garment was pulled a short distance away, Helena then pulled hard tearing one leg hole open leaving them clinging solely to Selicia&#39;s left leg. Again she shot forward and eagerly lapped and penetrated Selicia. As Selicia&#39;s hands came down to push Helena deeper, a foot came down on the back of Helena&#39;s causing a moan from Selicia and a muffled gasp from Helena. Abernathy had come over and now shoved Helena&#39;s face hard against Selicia&#39;s sex. When allowed, Helena took a deep breath before being plunged back in-between Selicia&#39;s legs, a mix of Selicia&#39;s own fluids and her drooling pattered the ground between them. Her ass was thrust into the air with her fingers working tirelessly to appease her with an occasional spasm bucking her legs. There was a muffled howl into Selicia&#39;s vagina prompting her to look up to see a thin wooden shaft pointing straight out of Helena&#39;s ass.<br />
<br />
&quot;It seemed a bit lonely, so I spared an old rival of mine to fill the need~&quot; Sneered Abernathy as she gestured to the wand deeply planted into Helena.<br />
<br />
Selicia&#39;s head swam for a moment as Helena had found just the right spot on her, her own breath hastening with every stroke. Despite the foot on Helena&#39;s head, Selicia placed both her hands to either side of it holding Helena down. Toes curled against the dirt, legs clamping both sides of Helena&#39;s head, and an cry of release, Selicia covered Helena&#39;s face in her fluids. Laying back on the ground, Selicia had nearly forgotten about the toy before a well timed warning from Abernathy had saved it from Helena&#39;s grasp once more.<br />
<br />
&quot;I still don&#39;t believe she&#39;s quite earned it, do you Selicia?~&quot; Abernathy&#39;s gaze was practically devilish as she regarded Helena scrabbling against Selicia.<br />
<br />
Helena still desperate to please to gain her own relief, rubbed against Selicia&#39;s prone form sliding her own clit against Selicia&#39;s. Shoving her off with what she could muster, Selicia wobbled to stand and glowered at the fallen woman.<br />
<br />
&quot;No... You don&#39;t have to right to force yourself on me... Maybe your tongue would better serve the earth after all, hmm?&quot; Pointing at the soaked patch that she and Helena had created, that sadistic glee bubbled forth as Selicia That cackle was so unlike her as she watched Helena proceed to lick the soaked earth with fevered eyes. As Helena licked the muddied earth turning her tongue brown in the process, Selicia and Abernathy regarded one another.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now then, Madam Selicia, I&#39;ll keep hold of the rest of your new territory until you&#39;re ready to handle them. Until then, I would keep your machinations to the forest and it&#39;s outermost lying areas. Don&#39;t you worry, I&#39;ll give them back as I&#39;ve given my word. Beyond that, it was your blow that led to her fall so she belongs to you part and parcel~&quot; Abernathy grinning at the still mewling Helena by their feet.<br />
<br />
Selicia suppressed her glee for the time being as she spoke to Abernathy with a respectful bow. &quot;Thank you, Madam Abernathy, I may have met my end if it were not for you. I look forward to working with you in the future.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Think nothing of it, I owed that bitch a despicable end after she stole the right to our Mistress from me. It was only right that I put an end to her with you. Now, I&#39;ll be on my way to see to arranging the lands for your arrival... Oh, and keep the wand and the other three, I won&#39;t be needed them anyway~&quot; Abernathy took a few steps toward the trees and vanished to somewhere unknown.<br />
<br />
Selicia turned her attention back to Helena on the ground. &quot;Go gather our things, we&#39;re going to MY abode.&quot; Helena dragged her breasts again across the ground for the short distance she crawled before unsteadily standing. She picked up a discarded robe removing her hand from herself long enough to place the small statue and the other former apprentice in it like a sack. By the time she stood behind Selicia, her hand was already kneading her clit once more.<br />
<br />
Back at what was now her house, Selicia ordered Helena into a corner as she inspected the contents of the robe. The first was the marble statuette of a young woman cupping a breast below the nipple while her other hand traveled down her waist. The other former apprentice had been reduced to a ball sporting her most private parts. A pair of nipples, a clit sticking prominently from the vagina, and the asshole behind them. Following a curious rub of the clit caused the ball to twitch and drip slowly. Selicia had determined that Abernathy herself may have accidentally struck down this apprentice. The third of the trio was already in her hand as the leverage against the sex struck Helena.<br />
<br />
Over the next few hours, Selicia toyed with the absolute obedience of Helena causing her to do whatever she might have fancied at the moment. One of those times, she&#39;d tested Helena&#39;s flexibility by ordering her to grab her feet backwards on the floor. So she had said, so Helena had done, she held her ankles and she curled herself about leaving her dripping lips to patter wetly onto her face. Her large breasts flattened by her body against the floor as if only they were stopping her from rolling away. The wand still planted and poking the back of her head as if was forced deeper by the position.<br />
<br />
During the next order, Selicia had come to regard the wand as a sort of tail the way it wiggled as she walked. This time the order was a test to see if the toy in Selicia&#39;s hand was even necessary. Selicia had retrieved the former woods&#39;woman&#39; from her room and gave it to Helena, who feverishly rode the toy. Her waist audibly slapping the floor with each deep desperate thrust of the toy. It seemed even with the toy she was given she would find no release. Finally, Selicia decided she&#39;d become bored with the current state of Helena so, she stopped the thrusting woman taking the toy she was using from her. Selicia moved to a door frame and bound the first toy to one side and the woodswoman to the other.<br />
<br />
Helena didn&#39;t seem to need another order as she planted herself firmly between them and rocked back and forth. Her tongue working the wooden shaft while her rear took a triple threat in spades. Her fingers working her clit, the toy riding deep within her and the wand tip butting the door frame with each rock backward. Louder and and wetter the slapping sounds became as she finally worked her way into a euphoric climax. Her body shook violently as all of the pent up arousal gushed forth soaking the door frame and pooling on the floor. Her eyes glossed over as a vapid smile played across her face. Thus the threat of Helena met with an amusingly messy end.<br />
<br />
In the year following, Selicia had a near mindless Helena do everything Selicia had done for her in the past. Bathe her, please her, cook for her, and more as the months led on. The day came where Selicia had felt that her usefulness had come to its end. So she had given Helena the final order of standing with her legs spread wide and the the wand from the first day stuffed head deep into her ass once more. With a simple wave of her hand, the wand started to grow in size and length even as Helena had begun to shrink in size. The staff had grown faster than she reduced in size causing her stomach to bulge before it stopped. Helena&#39;s own arms, legs and head were swallowed by her torso turning a brilliant shimmering blue color.<br />
<br />
There where once her Mistress stood was a staff sporting the thin shape of a well endowed woman standing legs curled as they dwindled to a point in mid masturbation. At the top of the neck the head disappeared into a large sapphire shaped like Helena&#39;s torso, a delicately cut vagina on full display topped by a large breasts. It was a bit gaudy she admitted but, she&#39;d hate for the well spring of power within Helena to go to waste. She stored it deep below the home in a hidden chamber in case anyone would come to steal it. A minor burst of humor struck at her and she planted a soft goodbye kiss on the raised clit of the sapphire.<br />
<br />
&quot;Goodbye for now, Mistress Helena, may you serve me well again some day~&quot; With that she closed and sealed the chamber until the day of need came to her...<br />
<br />
Selicia jolted awake, sitting up straight in her bed coated in a cold sweat. If there was ever a time she might need that service, it was now...</p>
