<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Jack, this way!&quot;<br />
<br />
Lost in the crowd quickly hopping off the student-filled bus, Jack had gotten separated from his friends. He heard their voices, but could not seem to see where on earth they had went. Trying to simply get out of the mob moving toward the entrance to Lincoln High&#39;s football stadium, Jack finds himself standing next to a battered school bus. Continuing to scan the crowd for his friends, Jack hears a hissing sound as the door to the school bus swings open. Looking up through the windows of the bus, Jack sees it is full of the football players from his school. They&#39;re all pretty muscular for high schoolers and are wearing matching tank tops and basketball shorts. Although he was not friends with any of the football players, he was suddenly overcome with a sense of school spirit. As the team disembarks the bus and stretches their arms and legs after the long ride, Jack begins making his way to the entrance of the stadium now that the crowd had thinned. After only a few steps, though, he hears an ear-splitting yell. Turning back around, he sees one of the football players is standing on one leg and being lowered to the ground by a couple other guys.<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened, Ethan,&quot; an older man with a fat belly whom Jack identifies as Coach of the football team.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I don&#39;t know, sir! I think I stepped off the bus wrong and messed up my ankle.&quot; The football player is now sitting on the ground and wincing in pain as he clutches his right ankle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dammit, son,&quot; The Coach says in exasperation. He looks around and grabs the arm of a player with short brown hair, green eyes, and a good-looking face. &quot;James, I need you to find someone about your age around here and bring them to me. Now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Coach Springer.&quot; The player readjusts the gym bag slung over his shoulder and looks around him. Jack decides to begin walking away to avoid getting tangled up in whatever is happening at the bus, but he hears someone yelling after him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me!&quot; A deep and commanding voice booms from behind him.<br />
<br />
Jack turns back around to see the football player jogging up to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I, uh, help you,&quot; Jack asks questioningly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, uh, can you come with me for a sec? One of my teammates stepped off the bus wrong and did something to his ankle.&quot;<br />
<br />
Although he&#39;s unsure about how exactly he would help, Jack nods. Following James back to the bus and where the football player remains seated on the ground, Jack listens as James clears his throat to get the Coach&#39;s attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;Coach Springer, I got what you asked for.&quot;<br />
<br />
Slowly turning around while doing something on his phone, the Coach looks up and brings the phone down to his side. He does a quick up-and-down look at Jack, and smiles. &quot;Hello, young man! I&#39;m Coach Springer. And you are?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, I&#39;m Jack. I actually go to school at Concord. I&#39;m here to watch the game with some of my friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, wonderful! We appreciate the support, really. But I&#39;m afraid we are in need of more than just a spectator.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Jack asks, genuinely confused.<br />
<br />
Glancing down at his phone again, Coach Springer brings the phone up and holds the screen level with Jack&#39;s face. Looking at the screen, Jack sees one of the football players standing there with other players behind him.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s go-&quot; Jack quickly trails off as he hears his voice. It&#39;s completely different, it&#39;s usually kinda high-pitched for his age, but now it&#39;s deep and booming like the football player&#39;s that was calling after him earlier. Instinctively bringing his hand to his throat, he catches in his peripheral vision that the football player on Coach Springer&#39;s phone is doing the same. Taking a closer look at the phone, and watching in confusion as the football player on the phone&#39;s screen gets closer, Jack takes in what he&#39;s seeing. The football player is wearing the same gray tank top and crimson basketball shorts as the rest of the players on the bus, and he has a thin, silver chain draped around his muscular neck. His shoulders are extremely broad, making Jack think that he&#39;s a linebacker. His pecs are big enough to show through the fabric of the tank top he wears, and his arms are gigantic from delts to forearms. His face is extremely good-looking, with a square jaw, bright blue eyes, tan complexion, and smooth nose. His hair is cropped against his scalp on the sides, but he has length on the top that he has styled up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you,&quot; Coach Springer asks in confusion as he puts the phone down, &quot;still not realize that&#39;s you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Not wanting to accept that despite the phone&#39;s obvious depiction, Jack slowly looks down at his new body. The tank top droops across his massive shoulders, and he can see down that under the fabric, he has a set of washboard abs. The mesh basketball shorts do little to hide the massive rod he now possesses, and he looks down further to see his muscular and defined legs. On his feet he wears a pair of Air Jordan 1s, and a pair of white Nike socks peek from above the high-tops. Catching his reflection in the window of a passing car, Jack sees his full body and just how different it is from the lanky, weak body he once had. He tugs on his chain as he watches Coach Springer pick up the gym bag from the football player on the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here you, go, son. These will fit you.&quot; Jack watches in amazement as the name stitched on the bag goes from &quot;Ethan #87&quot; to &quot;Jack #87&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now follow your teammates to the locker room and get suited up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Coach Springer.&quot; Jack follows his teammates to the locker room and plops the bag down in a locker. Beginning to pull the equipment out, Jack&#39;s head begins to throb. He suddenly finds it hard to remember exactly why he came here.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was with my friends,&quot; Jack thinks. As he reaches in the bag and pulls out his jersey, a flood of new memories embed themselves in Jack&#39;s head: He&#39;s been on the football team since freshman year. He&#39;s a Varsity linebacker. His best friend is James. Glancing over, he sees James throwing his jersey over his shoulder pads and tugging them on. Taking off the tank top and basketball shorts, Jack quickly pulls on the padded football pants. Next, he slips into a pair of athletic socks and then his football cleats. As he&#39;s doing this, he is gifted with the abilities of Ethan and becomes just as good as a linebacker as him. He next throws on a tight compression shirt that hugs his massive pecs and delts before mimicking James with his jersey and shoulder pads. He lifts the pads over his head and brings it down on top of his shoulders. Fastening the straps to secure it against his body, Jack reaches to get his helmet out of the bag. As his hand grabs hold of the face shield, Jack&#39;s changes are made permanent and are how everyone except Coach Springer thinks he has always been. Now a jock for good, Jack begins getting pumped up for the game with his teammates and best friend, James.</p>
