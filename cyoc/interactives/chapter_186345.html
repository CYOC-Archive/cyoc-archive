<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The drive home was without incident. Stopped at traffic lights Henry kept the windows up and his eyes straight ahead. He didn’t try to make eye contact with anyone in other cars.<br />
<br />
Alicia assured him that with her sunglasses on, he passed for a well stacked woman with a rather masculine jaw and short hair. Henry was rehearsing in his head what he would say if he was pulled over by the police ‘We are off to a costume party’. He drove carefully to avoid such a situation.<br />
<br />
Fear got the better of him once they were pulled into the resort car-park. Henry did put the jacket back on for the short walk back to their suite.<br />
………….<br />
“Well I don’t know about you but I’m going to take another shower, freshen up, and laze for the rest of the day” stated Alicia once they were back in the room.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I agree. These legs are tired. I think I’ll get started on that book I bought. Let me know when the shower is free” Henry had already removed the hot jacket once more. <br />
<br />
So, Henry found his book, removed the jacket he had so recently put back on, as well as his shoes and socks, lay down on the couch under the ceiling fan and began to read his book.<br />
<br />
Alicia showered. She took a while because she shaved all the hairs off of what was currently her chest. She would have done it this morning but Henry had been nagging her about not wanting to start the walk too late in the day. She hadn’t asked his permission but the hairs were so unsightly. She figured he had not been too upset when she had shaved his legs.<br />
<br />
“Showers all yours” she told Henry when she finally exited the bathroom. <br />
<br />
“I’ll just finish this chapter” Henry replied<br />
<br />
Alicia went to the bedroom and retrieved some fresh clothes. She put on some panties and a skirt. Then looked at the bra she had taken off for her shower. It was the only bra she had that would fit her chest. “Bugger it” she said audibly “I’m going to go topless”<br />
<br />
“What was that Alicia?” Henry asked from the other room. He had just finished the chapter<br />
<br />
“Oh nothing” then she had another thought. “Would you like a more comfortable top? Something that breathes better? What you’re wearing has no doubt got sweaty”<br />
<br />
 “Yeah, that would be good”<br />
<br />
 “I’ll leave something in the bathroom for you”<br />
<br />
Henry showered. Once more he played with his breasts. He was amazed at how quickly his nipples hardened whenever he touched them, they responded even quicker than Mister Marvellous. He had noticed Alicia enter the bathroom. “I think you will find this really comfy, I’ve also bought in some fresh undies and shorts of your own. I’ll put what you were wearing into the laundry bag. We need to get our washing done”<br />
<br />
Alicia returned to the bedroom and began filling the hotel laundry bag with their dirty clothes. The hotel promised next day return. She would ring reception and get the clothes picked up later. <br />
<br />
Henry finished his shower, dried then saw the clothes Alicia had left for him. He put on his undies and shorts then examined the other garment she had left in the bathroom. The clothes he had been wearing were gone.<br />
<br />
It was some sort of pale, beige lingerie. A camisole if he remembered the correct name. It felt like silk and was all lacy. He held it in front of his chest. Could he? Should he? Clearly Alicia wanted him to wear it. Why else would she have left it here? Mister Marvellous was excited by the idea of wearing it, but Henry was still unsure. It certainly wasn’t macho to wear something like this, but then again it wasn’t exactly macho to have perky breasts. He really didn’t know which way to proceed. In the end he decided on a token protest. Make Alicia think he was reluctant and only doing this for her.<br />
<br />
“Alicia! What’s this? Do you really want me to wear this thing?”<br />
<br />
He quickly got a reply from beyond the door “That thing is a very expensive Dolce and Gabbana, silk camisole. You wanted something comfortable then that is your best option. Put it on! You will love it!”<br />
<br />
“But it’s so feminine”<br />
<br />
“I know! I’ll bet your breasts will look great in it. Oh please! Do it for me!”<br />
<br />
“How come I’ve never seen you in this”<br />
<br />
“I bought it for the honeymoon but just haven’t had a chance to wear it yet. I promise I will wear it on my next opportunity. But right now, it only fits you”<br />
<br />
Henry thought he had her begging enough “Okay. I’ll wear it. But you will owe me big time”<br />
<br />
“Do you need me to help you put it on?”<br />
<br />
Henry took another look at the very delicate looking shoulder straps then replied “I think you had better” He didn’t want to be responsible for tearing the garment.<br />
<br />
It was actually easy to get the garment on Henry. His shoulders were narrowed sufficiently that it fit over them quite readily. Alicia pulled it down over his breasts which sat in ‘Pockets’ of the garment. They filled the bodice out perfectly. There was a layer of lace in the ‘Vee’ of his breasts and around the bottom of the camisole which rested on the top of his stomach. The way his tummy bulged out at the bottom of the camisole made Henry think he looked pregnant.<br />
<br />
“This looks ridiculous on me” he complained.<br />
<br />
“Mister Marvellous doesn’t think so and neither do I” Alicia had noticed the bulge in his shorts. “Don’t you like the feel of the silk on your skin?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, I admit it feels nice and is more comfortable to wear than the sweaty sports bra. But I don’t exactly look manly”<br />
<br />
“Well we aren’t going anywhere. No one will see you. Go back read some more of your book. I’m just going to get someone to collect our laundry. Then read a book myself”<br />
<br />
“Well make sure they don’t come in. I would die if anyone saw me wearing this?”<br />
<br />
“You didn’t die when the hikers saw you. Why should you die now?” <br />
<br />
Henry didn’t have an answer but he had seen something else to complain about “Did you shave my chest?”<br />
<br />
“It looks much better doesn’t it? If I’m going to stay topless for the afternoon, I don’t want to be hairy” Alicia wasn’t looking for a reply. She felt a bit guilty shaving the chest without asking. She left Henry and returned to the bedroom to finish collecting clothes to be laundered.<br />
<br />
Henry actually did feel quite comfortable. The camisole wasn’t restricting him like the bra had, and the silk did really feel nice against his skin. He resumed his spot on the couch and got back to reading his book. <br />
<br />
Alicia rang reception and was told someone would be around shortly. She quickly donned the oversized bra and shirt to be ready to meet the staff member at the door. As soon as the laundry had gone she removed the bra and shirt once more, grabbed a magazine of her own, then made herself comfortable on the patio. Choosing a spot where she could not be seen from elsewhere.</p>
