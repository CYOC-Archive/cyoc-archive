<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle took off his soaked jeans and drenched underwear! He was totaly humiliated, his Mom had seen him loose control twice now! This was the worst thing
<br>
 Jennifer had done to kyle yet! Kyle was fumming mad! Now he would have to wear diepers at his age, the very thought just pissed him off! Kyles dad seemed to
<br>
 have been gone for alomg time and poor kyle who had cleaned himself up and changed into his comfortable pair of well worn and torn faded jeans! Kyle hoped
<br>
 that he had eliminated most of his bladders contents and just tryed to stay with in running distance of the bathroom just in case he felt like he might end up pissing in
<br>
 these jeans! 
<br>

<br>
 Kyle was going to go hang out with some freands that night but now that didnt seem like a good idea! He defenetly didnt want to have an accident in front of his
<br>
 buddys! that would be just to emberissing! But fate would paint a different picture for poor Kyle. Kyles freands came to his house! Kyle heard the doorbell and
<br>
 feared the worst, but sure enough there at the door was Mark Boman and Stan Carter, the schools biggest jocks they were some of Kyles newest freands, it had
<br>
 taken months of hard work and training on both the schools baseball team and its basketball teams just to earn these guys respect and now thaanks to Jennifers
<br>
 cruel joke that respect could be ruined in a heart beat! 
<br>

<br>
 Kyle just stood there in the door way he didnt really want to go out side! But thats what these two guys wanted him to do, they wanted to shoot a few hoops out in
<br>
 front of Kyles garage! God Kyle dreaded this but these guy freandship was important to the 10th grader. The guys were 11th graders and for them to even hang
<br>
 around with Kyle was a feat in its self, so Kyle reluctantly agreed to shoot a few hoops, Kyle thought that he would just stay away from liquids and that should
<br>
 lower the chances of him haveing the dares evil trick pop up on him unexpectedly! 
<br>

<br>
 Kyle told his Mom they were going to shoot some hoops out front, Kyles Mom pulled Kyle off to the side and out of ear shoot of the two big jocks and asked
<br>
 Kyle if he thought he might be sick or something? Kyle was abit emberissed by this and knew what the real reason for the accidents was! but he couldnt tell his
<br>
 Mom that! So he asured her he would be fine and the threesome went and started to shoot some hoops out front. 
<br>

<br>
 Kyle was developing into a some what muscluar young man and he was somewhat proud of this and he liked to show off his young tight wirey build! And today
<br>
 was no exeption and it was a very hot day so all three of the young men ended up playing hoops shirtless, the three young studs was quite an eye catcher for the
<br>
 neiborhood girls and soon there was a small group of young people all hanging around with Kyle and the other two guys who were very well built and also very
<br>
 attractive as well! Mark was the biggest of the three, it seemed nature liked Mark and had blessed him with a very nice body that wasent just well toned it was
<br>
 down right adult looking! Mark could buy beer and he wouldnt get carded! And he had done just that! And Stan and Mark both cohorsed poor Klye into drinking
<br>
 one of the beers that Mark had brought with him! And it was a 16oncer on top of that! Kyle never really liked the taste of beer but he didnt want to loose these
<br>
 guys freandship either, so he drank the beer, guzzled it was more the word for it! And now the stage was set! 
<br>

<br>
 Kyle was Comeing around Stan dribbleing the ball and trying to make a shoot over Marks head! He dodged back and forth and soon had the shoot all lined up!
<br>
 And just as he got the ball in the air and headed right where he wanted it! The dare took over! Kyle landed back on his feet and then felt the flow begging! Poor
<br>
 Kyles eyes were as wide as he could get them to be as the front of his faded jeans formed a dark wet spot that just spread rapidly and then raced down the front
<br>
 of his legs to the knee on one side and to tops of his Nikes on his right leg and spread out all around his shoe as he stood there red faced and clutching his crotch
<br>
 as tightly as he could! Kyle was mortified! Here he was pissing his pants like some little boy and he had absalutly no control over it! 
<br>

<br>
 Mark and Stan were laughing their ass off by now and so were the girls,if they did think he looked good before they certainly didnt think that now! And tears of
<br>
 shame began to form in poor Kyles eyes, Kyle knew he would never live this one down! And his freandship with these two jocks was probably over as well as any
<br>
 chance at getting a date with any of the girls there as well! &quot;WHATS THE MATTER KYLE! YOU FORGET TO WEAR YOUR DIEPERS DUDE!&quot; Mark
<br>
 yelled as the two guys and the girls just watched as the piss just flowed from poor Kyle and form a huge puddle around him as he stood there, now red faced and
<br>
 crying1 Jennerfer had ruined everything for him! 
<br>

<br>
 Mark and Stan were relentluse in there ragging of him and it and everything else was rushing through his very confused mind! Kyle had had enough and just staired
<br>
 at the two big strong guys and yelled &quot;TRANSFORM OR DARE!&quot; Kyle had done the deed and now the two studs were confronted with the evil curse! Neither
<br>
 knew what he was talking about? &quot;Transform or dare? What are you talking about man?&quot; Mark said with a very confussed look on his face, for some reason the
<br>
 words sent chills down his spine, but other then a mild case of goose bumbs Mark was still perplexed over what this guy with the wet jeans meant by it! 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;TRANSFORM or dare Mark! And the same to you Stan! TRANSFORM OR DARE!&quot; Kyle said angerly! Mark just shook his head and smiled, his deep
<br>
 dimpled cheeks were laced with two days growth of beard stuble and the look just made him that much better looking! Stan was just brushing back his long bangs
<br>
 with a look of total confusion on his handsome face &quot; What? TRANSFORM OR DARE THIS ASSHOLE!&quot; Stan said and flipped Kyle the bird and both guys
<br>
 turned around to leive! But before they got far Kyle repeated the words! Mark had,had enough himself and turned around in a fighting stance, &quot;Look! Ya fuckin
<br>
 little baby! Ill take dare ya fuck cause I dare you to say just one more thing to me! Dont try to threatin me! I can kick your baby ass right now if ya want me too!&quot;
<br>
 Mark said as he staired down at Kyles hands that were still clutching his soaked crotch! 
<br>

<br>
 &quot; Fine then Mark DARE it is! I dare you to become a big baby your self I dare you to piss your pants like a kid and to slowly start to sound like one and look like
<br>
 one as well! And you Stan I dare you to become the same thing! Say good bye to those big ass muscles as well!&quot; Kyle said the words and then turned and ran for
<br>
 his house! 
<br>

<br>
 Mark and Stan just laughed at him and started to walk away! They were about a block away when the curse began on them! Mark would be the first to suffer the
<br>
 humiliation of total bladder control! Mark was walking with his big strong arm around the shoulders of one of the girls when it happened, Mark felt like he suddenly
<br>
 really needed to take a leak! But they were in the middle of a subdivision full of houses and there was no place to run behind and take a piss, at first Mark was able
<br>
 to hold it but soon as the curse went on he lost the ability to control his bladdder and soon the froont of his jeans were filling with the three beers he had downed at
<br>
 Kyles place. &quot;WHAT THE FUCK!&quot; Mark screamed as he reached down to cup his crotch! &quot;SHIT NOO!&quot;OH NO! No man whats happening!&quot; Mark said in a
<br>
 very shakey tone! Everyone was in shock over this! Heres this big strong guy wetting his jeans like a small kid! Mark was totaly humiliated! 
<br>

<br>
 Stan soon followed him into the realm of humiliation with his own show of incotenence! Poor Stan was laughing at Mark when his own bladder gave out and he to
<br>
 began to flood his jeans as well! Stans face went red as hell and he to had the look of surprize on his face as the front of his jeans turned dark and the legs of his
<br>
 jeans soaked as well! Soon his shoe filled with the stream and a very large puddle formed under his feet, both were now standing in puddles of there own piss as
<br>
 the two girls just laughed and walked away from the two studs who now loooked as bad as poor Kyle had looked! And now the two biggest jocks at the school
<br>
 were plunged head long into the realm of dieper wearing adults! Neither would have control over there bladders again, and they like Kyle would soon find diepers
<br>
 a part of their wardrobs! 
<br>

<br>

<br>
 The two were quite the site as they finally finished realeasing the entire contents of their bladders into their tight fitting jeans! And Mark was now sniffleing and
<br>
 crying, in total humiliation and total fear! Kyle had made this happen and he had threatened both guys with the loose of their big well developed muscles as well
<br>
 Mark was terrified! He loved his body it gave him power and control and now he had lost at leist some of that control! What if the rest of the Dare came true?
<br>
 Would Mark be reduced to a big baby as Kyle had told him he would? 
<br>

<br>
 Mark and Stan walked the rest of the way to there houses, trying to cover up their accidents with their tee shirts tied around their waist! They both discussed the
<br>
 major realitys of what Kyle had told them would happen to them! And before Mark knew it the second part of the dare started to become a reality! &quot;Do you think
<br>
 Kyle was serious when he mwade tat tweat abwout!!! Poor Marks voice cracked back to its prepubesent tone and he now sounded like a kid again! His deep
<br>
 baretone manly voice had been replaced with a whiney sounding big kids voice! &quot;WHAT HAWPENED TWU MWY VWOICE! WISTEN TWU MWE I
<br>
 SWOUND WIKE A WIDDEL KWID! Mark screamed! Now Mark not only sounded like a kid he was talking like one too! Poor Stans voice and speach
<br>
 became effected as well and soon both of the big studs sounded like and talked like little kids! 
<br>

<br>
 Both walked home with stuned looks on their faces! Marks days as the player of the young ladys was over, neither would be able to get laid with voices that
<br>
 sounded and used the terms that little kids did! And now they would soon be in diepers as well! Mark could feel the last part of the dare takeing its toll on his body
<br>
 now too as his wet tight jeans got looser on him and the waist line traveled down his thighs to his crotch level, Mark was now getting thinner as well, and then the
<br>
 last destuction to him hit him hard his underwear soon filled with his own shit! He had lost bowel control now as well!</p>
