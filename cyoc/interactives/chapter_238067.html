<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Yashka Rosov thought quietly about an apartment in what Animalia was terming its &quot;Russian district,&quot; mostly in relation to the fact that many Russian refugees had taken to living there and had been arriving over the past four years. Many generally represented the sorts that had essentially fled their country when Putin&#39;s all-out war in Ukraine started. Many were outside the ruling elites and knew that if they stayed in Russia, they&#39;d either lose their livelihoods as a consequence of the war or the Western response to it or would face censorship from the government for it, just as various other opponents of Putin&#39;s regime had. Yashka had fallen into that latter camp. Now the apartment would be a home for her as she moved forward with her life, and her mind drifted to it as she walked through Horizon.<br />
<br />
In the past, her family had long lived in Leningrad and then St. Petersburg, and when the Soviet Union fell, they had had hopes that the new Russian Federation would move toward a more westward aligned stance. More democratic, more open, possibly even being able to live alongside its neighbors rather than dominate them and thus see Russia join NATO and essentially recreate the alliance that won World War 2. But things rapidly declined. Economic hardship, that had come from decades of Soviet mismanagement ultimate made things quite open to exploitation, which Putin was happy to provide once he came to power. And over time, while elements of the Russian economy recovered, many of the things that Yashka&#39;s family opposed in the Soviet era came back, just in new ways. She protested and endured some prison time for it, but the war in Ukraine was the last straw, and Yashka knew that she wouldn&#39;t last long if she stayed.<br />
<br />
However, Yashka found that many other issues were hard to work with. Her stays in Russian prisons for her protests of Putin&#39;s actions left a criminal record that many countries in Europe were hesitant to accept, largely fearing that Yashka was some kind of criminal, and not a victim of one of the newest forms of Fascism&#39;s rising tide. Hungary even threatened to deport her TO Russia over her stated reason for entering the country. She only escaped that fate by getting to the Czech Republic and managing to a apply for a visa to the US as a displaced refugee from Russia. The Americans ultimately did accept her, though, the process took years to get through, though it also gave Yashka more time to look into various aspects of America, and she actually found Animalia to her liking.<br />
<br />
They were largely peaceful, fit, and cooperative. And after reaching Lyre/Animalia, Yashka also found that despite many accusations from those outside the original &quot;colony city,&quot; just as individualistic as those outside Animalia. That was pleasing to Yashka, and with her own prime passing her by, she felt that becoming an Animalian would fit well. The only thing she really didn&#39;t expect was the supervisor as she made her way into Horizon for her conversion. The large muscular frame of Aleksi Nozdrin was quite imposing. White Rhinoceros Animalians tended to have that effect, and the police uniform, even without the added armor that the Rhino Guard might wear for any major and surprise missions that would go beyond what standard patrol officers would handle.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve told everyone that my arrests were for protesting things that I felt were wrong,&quot; Yashka said slowly as Aleksi walked behind her toward the waiting room. Her accent was strong, as while she had learned English, both in school and in the course of her travels to get away from Putin&#39;s regime, but she couldn&#39;t fully lose all that she was. &quot;Civil disobedience over bad actions. Something this country CLAIMS to follow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And it does, despite what some may say,&quot; Aleksi answered, &quot;but in times like this... some measure of security is requested. And at the same time, given things... it was also felt that you might respond better to those that have more in common with you than you realize.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What would I have in common with a RUSSIAN police officer?&quot; Yashka asked back, &quot;all of you swear oaths to Putin.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t...&quot; Aleksi answered, &quot;and I left when things really began to go bad. My wife... and my children... they are important to me. Though, the path for my wife and I started with our eldest daughter coming to the US to study and filling for immigration status once she was out of Putin&#39;s control.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yashka blinked to that and then nodded with a small smile, &quot;so you are like me... an exile looking for freedom.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Aleksi nodded, &quot;though... I do wonder why you went with the Russian national animal...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There is nothing necessarily wrong with the Russian Bear,&quot; Yashka answered, &quot;the Eurasian Brown Bear is strong and powerful. Cunning and brave. Protective and nurturing. All things worthy of taking on... and what the Russian government seems to miss. Tyranny is not strength.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aleksi nodded to that, and they continued on. Yashka felt a bit relieved in this. For she had never met any of the Nozdrins before and her experience with police in Russia had never been good. Finding one of the good people from Russia was something that was to her liking and gave her some hope that there might be others in Animalia. Being an Animalian would then help her fit in with them. As they reached the waiting area, Yashka was surprised to find Judy waiting for them. The Rabbit Animalian paid no mind to Aleksi but was fully focused on Yashka and namely the papers in her hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;All the forms are filled out,&quot; Yashka spoke, &quot;hopefully my spelling is accurate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It should be passable,&quot; Judy answered, &quot;the essay needed to assure us that you understand the Eurasian Brown Bear&#39;s instincts and behaviors was a bit trickier... but it also worked out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yashka nodded as she watched Judy flip through the last bits of paperwork that were required. Some of the other legal hoops she&#39;d had to go through had required copies that were given to the front desk, and this section was the last of it to make sure that Yashka wasn&#39;t intending to go &quot;criminal&quot; as an Animalian. It was tedious, but also something she accepted. A part of her was interested in the various sports that Animalians were able to participate in, even if they were only against other Animalians. The closest thing she really had to more &quot;violent&quot; activity was joining some of the anti-Putin Russian units fighting on Ukraine&#39;s side and seeing that as a way to free her homeland from the REAL Fascist in the Russo-Ukraine War. However, with political tensions that related more to American politics, Yashka was also wary of something that would lead to her being a guinea pig for the Russian government.<br />
<br />
&quot;This all looks good,&quot; Judy announced as she folded the papers and then placed them in an inside pocket on her lab coat and then waved Yashka forward, &quot;If you&#39;ll come with me... we can get started. Officer Nozdrin, you can wait out here in the waiting room.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yashka then followed Judy onward and came into the conversion room. She trembled a bit at the inside. True, it wasn&#39;t metal, like a jail cell, but neither was it big. There were no windows and there was a lone bed. She stood there trembling at the white painted walls with memories of some of her stays in Russian political prisons washing over her.<br />
<br />
&quot;We do this for privacy,&quot; Judy spoke from behind her, noting the trembling, &quot;so that you are not embarrassed by anything... like growing out of your clothing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yashka turned back to the Mountain Cottontail Animalian.<br />
<br />
&quot;Large female Eurasian Brown Bears can weigh around five hundred pounds, comparable to a large male Tiger or Lion, and among Animalians, the Tiger and Lion Animalians that were once Human grew too big for their clothes,&quot; Judy spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;They were likely never in a Russian prison for political prisoners,&quot; Yashka answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Possibly... but the transformation IS a big process, and bears can be big predators,&quot; Judy answered, &quot;and there are times when I&#39;ve talked with Bear Animalians. The edicts say they can&#39;t hunt me... and they have been polite, but that doesn&#39;t mean that my instincts go away.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yashka only looked down. She frowned a little bit at letting Judy see her own fear and some of the strains from remaining issues, as she did want to show that she was stronger than her past. Show that she was stronger than what men like Putin would make her out to be. She barely noticed Judy&#39;s hand touch her arm with some gentle kindness.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I&#39;m in control of myself and my instincts,&quot; Judy spoke, &quot;just as you should be able to. Once you&#39;ve transformed and in clothes that will fit the new you... you&#39;ll be free.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then... let&#39;s do it,&quot; Yashka spoke as she stopped trembling.</p>
