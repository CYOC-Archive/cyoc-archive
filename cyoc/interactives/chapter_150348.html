<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mark ignored Aidans frozen form and turned back to the laptop. He liked the feeling of power he had now, and maybe he could make some of his fantasies real with Aidans help. What in the end would happen to Aidan wasn´t really anything that concerned him at the moment. So first off he had to make the chronivac and the laptop his to keep it. “From now on this laptop and the chronivac belong to me instead of you, Aidan. And you aren´t able to use them anymore.”<br />
Aidan didn´t know what Mark was planning, but he feared what Mark would do with him now. Taking the laptop would mean he wouldn´t have a way to get another chronivac, and by forbidding him to use it, he secured his own safety. He wouldn´t be able to change Mark in any way without it, and himself too.<br />
Mark then looked up what the chronivac could do and realized that his comment, “Mark rules” wasn´t posted in Aidans profile, but in the general text input. That could mean he couldn´t only change Aidan and his belongings, but everything. That he had to test on himself for now. “My hair is blond now.” He said and turned to the mirror. And he was right, he could change more then Aidan as his hair was blond in seconds. “No, that isn´t my color, my hair is black again.” And it changed back as fast as it had gone blond. <br />
<br />
Smiling at the possibilities he had now, he decided to be friendly to Aidan. &quot;You can talk again, Aidan. Changing you in any way would be boring if you can´t talk.&quot;<br />
Aidan was taken aback by this. Mark planned on changing him, but wanted him to be able to comment? “What have you planned of doing with me? I would like to stay as I am, you know.”<br />
“Oh, no, you will change. You didn´t know, but I really like fantasy stories and always dreamed of being something from that world. With this program I can finally be whatever I want. But first I want that you take your clothes off for me.” Mark explained smiling. Aidan wouldn´t know what he was becoming. <br />
Aidan looked uncomfortable when he dropped his jeans down and kicked it over to his shirt before taking his socks off. They went together with his underwear on the clothes pile, leaving him naked and bright red in embarrassment, But he didn´t ask what Mark was planning until he saw that Mark got naked himself, dropping his clothes right next to Aidans on a pile. “What are you doing? I don´t like you that way, you know?”<br />
Mark grinned at him. “No worries, Aidan. But my plan needs us both naked, as clothes would be in the way. My biggest dream was being a centaur like creature, and that&#39;s were you come in. I want you to be my back half. The connection will be made by my ass and your shoulders, so lets get started.” Mark laughed at the horrified look Aidan had now.<br />
<br />
Aidan felt a sudden pull towards Mark, who turned around to face the laptop again, showing his ass to him. Before Aidans eyes Marks ass seemed to grow bigger, the asshole itself did also while he moved towards it. “Mark, you can´t be serious with that. What about me? Do you really intend to let me vanish and die this way? Please stop this madness before its to late. Mmmmhhhhhh ppphhhh...” were Aidans last words before he pressed his head right into Marks asshole, his arms trying to push away but to no awhile. His head was stuck, and Marks ass closed around it to keep it in. Aidan could feel his shoulders merge with Marks ass and from the outside after only a minute you could only see where Marks body ended and where Aidans started by their slightly different skin color.<br />
Mark himself moaned in pleasure when Aidans head connected and cummed the moment they had finished merging, before with a sucking motion his cock sunk back into his body and covered over, leaving him smooth between his now front legs. But while his own cock and balls had shrunken away, Aidans former gear grew in response. He could feel Aidans pushing in his back to get free again, as well as the tickling of his hair in his former ass. <br />
“You know, a normal centaur has only four legs of the same length, so I want your arms to wrap around my belly and merge with it. Your hands will merge with my now empty crotch. Oh, and the hair on your head will vanish, its tickling me to much. And then your head won´t need ears, eyes or a nose in there, so the will vanish too.&quot; Mark said laughing at the trashing Aidan did behind him.<br />
Aidans wildly flailing arms slowly stopped moving before they moved forward, wrapping themselves around Marks belly, covering his belly button on the way. His hands were placed just where Marks own cock had been before, and then all started to merge with his body, vanishing from sight.<br />
Aidan screamed when his arms didn´t respond to him anymore and even more when he couldn´t feel them anymore. He didn´t feel his hair shrinking back, but the space his head was in was getting smaller around his vanishing features. His eyes, still in the darkness, closed without him doing anything, leaving him blind. The same applied to his ears and nose, the senses vanished completely. The only thing inside Marks former ass on Aidans head now was his mouth.<br />
<br />
Mark smiled at his new legs, but he wasn´t finished with his new body. “Let´s see. In fantasy real centaurs have hooves and a lower body more like a horse, but I want something different. I want my feet to turn into dragon like paws, each fitting three long sharp claws with won´t hinder me walking. And I have the full control of my body and know how to work with it. Aidan, because your head is still in there I want that it is fixated in there. Then your teeth will also vanish and your mouth will connect with my asshole so that my waste goes through your body. You will be able to taste and smell everything that moves through it.”<br />
Aidan just screamed inside, not knowing whats happening, but nothing was heard outside. He felt his control of his own body slowly decrease. He could no longer move his legs, they just stopped doing what he wanted. Finally his head stopped moving due both his loss of control and the fixation it got. He felt his teeth begin pulled back into their gums and than his lips connected with the asshole in front of it as if he wanted to kiss it. Aidan mentally screamed in disgust, but was unable to do anything anymore. He could still feel his former body and its changes.<br />
Mark watched fascinated as his feet all grow tougher and thicker, gaining small black scales all over the skin. His toes merged together into three thicker ones, and the nails grew longer and sharper until he had six clawed dragon feet. But it stopped there. Mark sighed and added. “I will also have dragon like legs to support my body. My lower body will become stronger and robuster as well as covered in scales and gain a flexible dragon like tail.”<br />
He liked the feeling of the scales slowly covering his legs and lower body. Now it was impossible to see anything of Aidan on his body, as every part of Aidans skin was now covered in said black scales. When his tail grew out he cummed a second time before his new, Aidans old cock vanished into a sheath between his hind legs.<br />
Aidan was mentally whimpering in pain. While Mark enjoyed the changes, to Aidan they were really painful, as he could feel every bone cracking and changing inside. He nearly blacked out when the tail grew out, but he was unable to do so. He was reduced to an extension of Marks body that could only feel and think, the later at least when not in pain. He didn´t know that Mark had let him keep his senses of smell and taste, too, but he would soon find out and hate it.</p>
