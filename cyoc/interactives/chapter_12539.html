<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;And just where do YOU think you're going, little lady?&quot;<br />
<br />
   Looking as I did, I'd known that I didn't have a realistic chance of slipping through without question. It wasn't just my body (which seemed slightly malnourished...dispite the wildly disproportionate size of my breasts and width of my hips), it had also been the lush, thickness of my hair and the beauty of my face.<br />
<br />
   Well...perhaps not &quot;Beauty&quot; as it were. I was sort of cute; with very kissible lips, a natural beauty-mark just above my upper lip and sharp cheek bones, but counterbalanced by a slightly over-large nose and smallish eyes that seemed naturally heavy-lidded...as if I were sleepy...or dumb.<br />
<br />
   No...not beauty. I guess I just looked...to girlish to convince anyone that I was a guy...let alone some Yankee Gringo detective.<br />
<br />
   &quot;I'm jus' tryin' t' geet back to Texas, Seinor.&quot; I said in my new accent. Thank goodness I still spoke English. Even if I did now sound shockingly uneducated. Their was something very &quot;street&quot; about the way I now pronounced words...and I still sounded rather Mexican.<br />
<br />
   &quot;Yeah, but it look's like you're doing so in a stolen car.&quot;<br />
<br />
   I went all &quot;Wide-eyed and Innocent&quot; as I gasped &quot;Aw, no Seinor. Dis ees my car.&quot;<br />
<br />
   &quot;Uh-huh. What's your name, ma'am.&quot;<br />
<br />
   &quot;Maria Garcia.&quot; I answered without pausing. It sounded common enough. Sort of the Mexican equivalent of Jane Smith.<br />
<br />
   &quot;And this is your car?&quot;<br />
<br />
   &quot;Si, Seinor.&quot;<br />
<br />
   He sighed, then looked me straight in the eyes. <br />
<br />
   &quot;You're a very bad liar, Maria Garcia - if that is your real name. If I let you past this check-point you'll likely wind-up in an American jail with a Grand Theft Auto charge that'll get you sent straight back to Mexico...and a Mexican jail.&quot;<br />
<br />
   I sighed...then drew three one-hundred dollar bills from my wallet. I looked at the money...and suddenly didn't want to part with it. As long as I was trapped in this for I'd have no access to my back account, my trailer...anything. I needed to keep a tight grip of my finances.<br />
<br />
   I couldn't afford to bribe him...with money.<br />
<br />
   It felt perfectly natural to unbutton the top of my shirt, then tie the lower half beneath my breasts to make a crude halter top.<br />
<br />
   I leaned out the window and rested my heavy breasts on the door.<br />
<br />
   &quot;Oh, Senior...surely their ees sometheen' I could do to...convince you?&quot;<br />
<br />
   I smiled up at him with my vapid whore's face as open yet empty as a promise.<br />
<br />
   He shifted his erection, then stepped back from my car and said &quot;Pull over to the side of the road, Miss Garcia. I'll have to take you inside...for an inspection.&quot;<br />
<br />
   I gave him another smile, then winked in such a naturally sleazy way that I didn't even notice I'd done it. I stepped from the car and followed him into the little building, to a small room with a bed.<br />
<br />
   I turned to look at him, and all at once I realized he was taking his clothes off. For a moment I was stunned (most of my brain hadn't really believed I'd go through with this), then I smiled...and removed my clothes. Finally I stood naked before him, and asked &quot;So...now what do we do, Seinor. How you want eet? You like eet dirty? You like nasty girls like me?&quot;<br />
<br />
   The words that I spoke tumbled from my mouth so naturally that I was almost unaware of them. Guy's liked it when you talked dirty to them. It made them feel superior.<br />
<br />
   He held his erect member out and snapped &quot;Just come over here and suck my cock. I don't have all day.&quot;<br />
<br />
   I strolled over to him, naturally rolling my hips and wiggling my butt. I sank to my knees, and took his cock into my mouth.<br />
<br />
   And all at once...it slipped into place. My brain seemed to shut down and pure instinct took over.<br />
<br />
   I tickled the head with my tongue first, making him shudder. Then I gobbled him down to the base and started sucking...hard! He almost tried to pull away, but I bit down sharply and looked-up into his eyes. He winced, then settled down and accepted that I was in charge now.<br />
<br />
   I sucked him so hard I thought I'd suck it right off. Over and over I worked his dick, until he finally moaned and came, filling my mouth with his warm, salty spunk.<br />
<br />
   He started to go limp, but some quick action from my tongue made him erect again. He asked &quot;What do you think...&quot; then he moaned. I think he realized what I was doing.<br />
<br />
   Again and again he came. Each time her did I brought him back and started sucking again. After the third time he sank to his knees. The fifth time he started to cry.<br />
<br />
   When I was finished I stood and smiled down at him. He looked unsteadily at me, then nodded and said &quot;You...can go...&quot;<br />
<br />
   Instead of going, I strutted to the rest room and said &quot;Jus' a second, Senior. I need's to piss.&quot;<br />
<br />
   I sat and peed, feeling both content and full. Content, because I'd shown that smartass Gringo who was in change, and full because my belly was literally full of cum.<br />
<br />
   Full of cum!<br />
<br />
   I tried to stand, but my legs went weak and I sank to the ground. I'd just blown another man SIX TIMES! Worse than that...I'd liked it.<br />
<br />
   No...I'd LOVED IT! The salty, thick taste of the semen on my lips was the most delicious thing I'd ever known. I loved sucking cock. For some reason, I knew that's what this talented tongue and big mouth of mine was for.<br />
<br />
   Gradualy I calmed down, wondering how I'd ever get out of this mess. Should I go back to Texas? I'd been intending to only because that's where I came from. But what would I do once I got there? <br />
<br />
   &quot;Maria?&quot;<br />
<br />
   &quot;Si, Seinor?&quot;<br />
<br />
   &quot;I've...got something for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
   She cleaned-up and opened the door. The fellow was standing there with a box in his hands. It was full of various clothes.<br />
<br />
   &quot;This is our Lost and Found box. I thought...you might be able to find something inside...that could fit you.&quot;<br />
<br />
   Twenty-minutes later I minced out of the rest room, dressed in clothes that actualy fit me. A faded, pink halter top decorated with red roses, a pair of black streach pants that clung to my new curves, strappy, pink sandles with three-inch heels.<br />
<br />
   I looked cheap. I looked natural.<br />
<br />
   It didn't help that the box had contained a little black purse that bulged with garish make-up. I took it eagerly, painting my lips a bright, shiney red. Some dark blush, blue eyeshadow and tons of mascara finished the look.<br />
<br />
   I looked like a whore.<br />
<br />
   And yet...I also looked real good. It was nice how the tiny top made my big tits look even bigger. And the pants showed off my big hips and ass. I looked pretty hot. <br />
<br />
   I shook my head (causing the big, hoop earings I'd found to jangle loudly) and looked again. Once again...I looked perfectly natural.<br />
<br />
   &quot;Damn you, Gomez Padraza.&quot; I hissed.<br />
<br />
   I searched the box again, hoping to find something useful.<br />
<br />
   A package of filterless, Mexican cigarettes.<br />
<br />
   I was suddenly filled with a desire for them (though I'd never smoked a day in my life) and I searched for a lighter. Finding one, I slipped the cigarette between my big lips, lit the cigarette, and drew in my first, double-lungful of smoke.<br />
<br />
   It...was...heaven.<br />
<br />
   I smiled and puffed contentedly for awhile, lost in the pleasures of the pungent tobacco. It was wonderful how it seemed to take all my problems away. <br />
<br />
   I strutted from the rest room and shook my tits for the man (what was his name?) before slinking out to my car and sliding behind the wheel. Once in a familiar place I could think clearly again.<br />
<br />
   I drove off, wondering what I could do to get back to normal. I found that while I was smoking, I could focus on my propects more clearly. <br />
<br />
   I could go to Gomez Padraza and beg him. That would get me nowhere fast.<br />
<br />
   I could return home and start my life again. <br />
<br />
   Or...perhaps I should focus on Padraza's gang? Perhaps he's not the only one who knows magic? Surely they didn't call him to Texas to transform that poor boy. Someone in his gang in Texas must have similar powers!</p>
