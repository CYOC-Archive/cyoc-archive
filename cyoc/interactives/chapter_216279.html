<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Well, it looks like your time is up. Too bad. But don&#39;t worry, I&#39;lk make it worth your while, Jennifer!&quot;, Kyle exclaimed triumphantly. It was as if he won the lottery. <br />
Jennifer couldn&#39;t help but roll her eyes. Seriously? He actually believed this stupid curse was real? If it were, then surely everyone would know. People would notice. But it wasn&#39;t. Sure, there was this girl infamous in town for having six breasts, but everyone knows it was a genetic defect she was born with. Not some stupid curse...<br />
Yet she had no time to further think about it as Kyle finally said: &quot;Well, Jennifer, I want to be nice. I will not make it so you lose your pretty face or your breasts and ass you are so proud of. I am not cruel. You stay completely the same... except for your stomach.&quot;<br />
&quot;My stomach?&quot;, she scoffed slightly. Yeah, right. As if that would ever change. She took such great care of herself, there was no way she could lose a great figure like this. <br />
&quot;Yes. For your transformation... You will have four stomachs. Just like a cow. And their sizes will also be exactly like those of a cow. No worries, your belly and waist will adjust to fit them in to you. The rest of you will stay the same. You will just have an obscenely large bloated belly and lose the perfect hourglass shape you were so proud of. And, hey, with all that added appetite, you will probably gain more weight anyways... So the rest of you will eventually adjust. And this change will happen the moment you eat your first meal of the day. But no worries, everyone will think and act as though you always had this &#39;condition&#39;. Now for your dare: You will forget that I was the one who cursed you alongside that eating something for the first time today will cause it to happen and not use the curse to have anyone remember the way you were. You will, however, in the near future grow more and more turned on by the idea of perhaps adding more size to your stomach and use the curse to accomplish that, and only that. You know, maybe a fifth stomach or more. The idea of being that big and yet you are technically still fit and skinny? It will make you get increasingly turned on despite you in reality surely being no fan of your new future. Have fun, Jennifer!&quot; <br />
And before she could retort anything, Kyle hung up. Yet as she stood there in silence, she just stared at her phone in utter confusion. She knew she talked about the town curse and what it was going to be... but who the hell was she talking to? She couldn&#39;t remember at all. <br />
Yet as she stayed there in silence for a whole minute, eventually she scoffed and shook her head. &quot;Clearly it wasn&#39;t real.&quot;, she muttered. She still looked the same. <br />
Though, as she moved to finally head downstairs and sit down in the kitchen after getting dressed fully, she grabbed herself a simple apple and sat down. A light meal was all dhe needed for now. <br />
However, when she took a bite and swallowed her first piece, she dropped the rest and immediatelly hugged her stomach. It hurt like hell..! As if her organs were shifting in ways they shouldn&#39;t at all...! Was something wrong with the apple? But it looked perfectly fine...! However, as the feeling only continued on like the worst stomachache she&#39;s ever had, to her horror it felt soon as if... it was bloated. But there was no way..! Yet when she sat up straight, she could tell it clearly was the case. It was to the point already where she felt even her skirt riding down because her stomach was starting to bulge out further and furher. Even her waist felt as though more weight was added to it with how she felt as if her shirt was struggling to stay in place.<br />
It kept riding up her belly, trying it&#39;s hardest to stay in place... yet the strain on it only made it ride up until it only covered her boobs anymore like a very short top. <br />
Yet her stomach continued to grow as Jen cried in utter terror, trying to press against it in an attempt to make it go back to normal. It looked obscenely huge on her. She was skinny everywhere, yet she looked like her stomach belonged on an overweight person rather than her. It looked ridiculous on her. And when she tried to get up, even the weight caused her to struggle as she stared down at herself in utter horror. &quot;...Four stomachs..! I really have four stomachs like a cow....!&quot;, she cried in utter terror. </p>
