<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kogasa was utterly drained, so she decided that rather than fix stir fry for the 5th time this week, she’d stop by WcDonalds to get a burger and some fries. Upon arriving, she noticed the long drive thru line, so she instead just parked and went inside. What she witnessed was like something out of a dream. Everywhere she looked, girls were smiling and chatting, many having daughters of various ages running around playing. The play area, too, was full of young girls running and chasing each other and generally having a good time, with not a boy in sight. It was a paradise, and it wasn’t until a pair of girls left the bathroom, wiping their lips with a paper towel, that she remembered her predicament. She had wanted to wait till she was in the comfort of her own apartment to empty her bowels, but she couldn’t hold it any longer. Gritting her teeth, she headed to the bathroom.<br />
<br />
What she hadn’t noticed when she was in the women’s room of the arcade, which was now the only bathroom, was the modified urinals to one side of the room. They were higher off the ground, designed so the user wouldn’t have to bend over too much. She also noticed there was a small dispenser with cups next to the sink, which housed complimentary mouthwash. This was now a normal fixture similar to hand soap.<br />
<br />
Various women and girls were using these facilities, acting as if vomiting piss was the most normal thing in the world. She found herself a stall, trying to figure out exactly how she was going to do this. She ended up having to swap around multiple times between bending over and sitting, her annoyance only exacerbated by how, while defecating, she was stuck with the taste of her own urine in her mouth for an excruciating amount of time. Truly, this world was her paradise and personal hell at the same time, like some twisted purgatory. <br />
<br />
Finally, it was over, and after quickly wiping, she flushed and practically sprinted over to the sink, having to wait a second as the mouthwash stand was occupied. Swishing the minty liquid around her mouth felt like heaven, wiping away the nasty flavor with ease. She almost cried, earning her some rather confused looks. Rinsing out the mouthwash with water, she finished washing her hands and exited the bathroom. <br />
<br />
Kogasa walked to the counter and placed her order, a quarter pounder and fries with a sprite, and she sat down with a group of girls around her age who were chatting, initially not really paying too much attention to the conversation. She took a sip from her soda, shivering a little and flushing red as the bubbly soda teased her erogenous tongue. The topic then shifted to their “first time”, with the girls each recounting how they had met their first girlfriends, and going into a little too much detail about their sexual encounters. The idea of girls openly going out and it being seen as totally normal was almost like a dream come true, despite how strange this world was, she still felt oddly comfortable here. Maybe it wouldn’t be so bad, if she had so many beautiful ladies to share her fate with. <br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
The ride home was uneventful, and once she got in she immediately flopped onto the couch and turned on the TV. She looked for her favorite anime, not exactly surprised to find that all the characters were now women. Her various girls love manga were now listed as just listed as “romance”, since yuri and romance were now synonymous, with the former term simply ceasing to exist. She flicked through a volume of a particularly raunchy one, somewhat shocked to find a graphic depiction of the two women cumming from their mouths in unison. It felt more than a little ironic that being a lesbian was now synonymous with having what was, to her, male ejaculate, in her mouth. This all felt like some divine comedy, at her expense in particular. <br />
<br />
She couldn’t help but chuckle. Despite how gross and weird this all was, she had to admit that this was probably the most fun and exciting thing that had ever happened to her. <br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Slipping out of her panties, Kogasa stopped barefoot to admire her slightly larger breasts in the mirror. It wasn’t super noticeable, since they were already large to begin with, but she still felt the difference. The only other visible difference between her current body and her old one was her pussy, specifically her urethra, or complete lack thereof. It made sense, without peeing through it, it was a totally pointless hole, but its absence only served as a reminder of her mouth’s strange new functions. <br />
<br />
Stepping under the steaming water, Kogasa sighed a sigh of relief. Cleaning herself, she discovered just how sensitive her skin now was. Everything felt tingly and just rubbing any part of her body felt so good. She couldn’t help but get distracted from what she was originally there to do. She found herself slowly circling her pussy and nipples, rubbing her tongue against the roof of her mouth while groping her tits. Moaning loudly, she felt her orgasm building both in her pussy and her throat, reaching a peak at the exact same time, resulting in the single greatest orgasm she’d ever felt, but such a margin she simply couldn’t describe it. Cum shot from her mouth in a fountain, and her pussy gushed forth with juices. It was like her whole body was having two orgasms at once, overstimulating her brain to the point she blacked out entirely.<br />
<br />
It wasn’t until the hot water had ran out that she finally woke up, yelping at the coldness of the water. She quickly shut the water off, realizing she never finished cleaning herself. She’d have to do so in the morning. Oh well.<br />
<br />
Having had her fun, she dried off, crawling into bed naked, curled up with her Game Boy in hand, which was now amusingly called a “Game Girl.” Eventually, she drifted off to sleep.</p>
