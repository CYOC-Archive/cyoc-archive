<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Christy and Madison had breakfast and were getting ready to leave when the doorbell rang.<br />
<br />
&quot;Answer the door, Christy. I am very busy with the dishes now.&quot; Christy&#39;s mother said<br />
<br />
Christy answered the door and came across a man wearing a military uniform. The identification on his chest indicated that he was Colonel Armstrog.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good Morning. I am Colonel Armstrong and I need you to come with me. Don&#39;t forget to bring your transformation gun.&quot; the Colonel said<br />
<br />
Christy was scared. She tried to understand what the military wanted with her and how they knew about the transformation gun. She quickly picked up the gun in her room and left, telling Madison that she should hide for a while.<br />
<br />
When she returned to the colonel, he immediately confiscated the transformation gun and took her to a van parked in front of her house.<br />
<br />
Christy was very nervous. the van had no windows and she couldn&#39;t see where it was being taken. After a while they stopped, after a few minutes the van door opened and they put Ella inside.<br />
<br />
When the van moved again Chisty said to Ella &quot;What do they want with us? Did they find out what we did and are we in trouble?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know, they didn&#39;t say anything when I asked.&quot; Ella said<br />
<br />
They didn&#39;t talk anymore for the rest of the trip, because they were so nervous that they didn&#39;t know what to say.<br />
<br />
When they reached their destination and left the van, they saw that they had been taken to a military base. There they were directed to a practically empty room, except for a small table and a few chairs in the center. Once inside Colonel Armstrong joined them.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re in trouble, aren&#39;t we?&quot; Christy asked<br />
<br />
&quot;That will depend on your answers, so I ask you not to lie to me.&quot; Colonel Armstrong said<br />
<br />
&quot;I will answer the best I can.&quot; Ella said and Christy nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;The transformation gun is a  military technology in the testing phase and you are two of the people selected for this test. Nothing was announced because we wanted to know how a civilian would act by suddenly being empowered to transform people. Even so, you are not immune to reprisals if you abuse it.&quot; Colonel Armstrong said<br />
<br />
&quot;So you sent us the guns?&quot; Ella asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Exact. However, there was an incident at a shopping center in which we know that you are both involved.&quot; Colonel Armstrong said<br />
<br />
&quot;I knew this was going to be trouble. A I was careless and my mom found out about the gun, she ended up stealing it from me while I slept and I had to ask Ella for help.&quot; Christy said<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right. All I did was get the transformed people back to normal.&quot; Ella said<br />
<br />
&quot;I already imagined that something like this could have happened due to the images on the security cameras, but I needed to be sure and I had to bring them here and listen to your explanations.&quot; Colonel Armstron said<br />
<br />
&quot;Couldn&#39;t you have questioned us in our homes?&quot; Christy asked<br />
<br />
&quot;No. There was a possibility that important information could leak out like this. Not to mention that there was another reason to be brought here.&quot; Colonel Armstrong said<br />
<br />
Then, without saying another word, he opened the living room door and signaled Christy and Ella to accompany him. They were guided to a room full of computers, where they saw that the two transformation guns were connected to one of the computers by a cable.<br />
<br />
&quot;As the revolver is our technology, we needed to bring the revolvers to update them. To conclude I need only a drop of your blood.&quot; Colonel Armstrong said<br />
<br />
They didn&#39;t question and let him one of the scientists puncture her fingers and they put the bleeding finger on a machine. After that they just waited.<br />
<br />
Three hours later Colonel Armstron showed up returning the guns to them and said &quot;Here they are, already updated and improved. We use your blood to program a new security, now the revolver will no longer work unless the owner is using it, apart from some new functions.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what would be the new functions?&quot; Ella asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Before, it was not possible to transform completely into an animal, now it is possible to make the transformation, while maintaining the human mind. It was also impossible to give human characteristics to animals, which is possible now. Finally, we have the possibility of transforming into inorganic and inanimate objects without losing consciousness and or life.&quot; Colonel Armstrong said<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice. Can I test it?&quot; Ella said<br />
<br />
&quot;You are free to use your revolvers, you can even go home now if you want. We programmed the route back on the GPS of your cell phones.&quot; Colonel Armstrong said<br />
<br />
Ella then pulled Christy out, programmed her transformation gun and fired.<br />
<br />
Christy immediately had her body forced to stand on all fours. She felt her body grow wider, longer and harder, but she couldn&#39;t see it because she was forced to look ahead. She realized that her arms and legs had changed, but she couldn&#39;t say how.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you make me Ella?&quot; Christy asked, feeling no part that was familiar to her and finding it strange that her voice came out of a part where she felt an emptiness in her back.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll see.&quot; Ella said and placed Colonel Armstrong in front of Christy, where she said something in his ear and he agreed. Then she shot him with the transformation gun, causing him to transform into a huge mirror and allow Chisty to see her reflection.<br />
<br />
Christy was delighted to see that she had been turned into a car, a red convertible ferrari to be more exact. She realized she was seeing through her headlights and she was talking through her radio.<br />
<br />
&quot;Incredible, I&#39;m a car. I realized that there were a lot of strange parts in my body, now I know what it is.&quot; Christy said, started her engine and took a few turns, learning to control her mechanical body.<br />
<br />
When she mastered her car body, Christy opened her door telling Ella to sit in her passenger seat for them to go home.<br />
<br />
Ella entered Christy and changed Colonel Armstron back to normal before they left.</p>
