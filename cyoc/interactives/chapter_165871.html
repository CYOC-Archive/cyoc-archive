<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nicky didn&#39;t budge. He stayed huddled up to his rapidly aging friend. &quot;Well, if it&#39;s really my call then I kinda want to see you get even older...&quot;<br />
<br />
Marcus laughed and gave his friend a squeeze. &quot;I knew you wouldn&#39;t let me down!&quot;<br />
<br />
Nicky stroked Marcus&#39; long, white beard and asked &quot;So you actually like this? Getting really old? Even with the whole getting fat and wrinkly and no longer functioning dick? Not to mention the whole shortening lifespan...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I admit there are downsides to being so old, but this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. To live an entire lifespan in under an hour? I mean I don&#39;t really want to reach the end, but the way you&#39;re holding off, I&#39;m probably gonna croak before you wash it out.&quot; He tweaked his nipples and moaned. &quot;Oh yeah, I&#39;m gonna die of old age pretty soon...&quot;<br />
<br />
Nicky laughed. &quot;I won&#39;t go that far, I promise.&quot; He buried his fingers through Marcus&#39; beard so he could feel his furry, flabby chest. &quot;So how do you feel?&quot;<br />
<br />
Marcus shrugged. &quot;Pretty tired, I guess fucking your ass really wore me out. I&#39;ve got some sore joints, and some dull aches. I think my hearing is starting to go too, I used to be able to hear the stream and now I can&#39;t.&quot; He leaned back and sighed. &quot;It&#39;s a little funny, I used to worry about getting old and now I&#39;m taking it all in stride. Just biding my time until the end...&quot;<br />
<br />
Nicky looked into the man&#39;s wrinkled face and sighed. &quot;Do you want me to get the bucket? Because I can get it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no. I want to be older. I&#39;m having the time of my life here!&quot; Nicky couldn&#39;t tell if he was being sincere or sarcastic. Either way, he tried to get up, but Marcus held on tight. &quot;C&#39;mon Nicky, can&#39;t it wait a few more years? When my teeth are gone?&quot;. <br />
<br />
Nicky looked up at Marcus who opened his mouth, revealing an increasingly gappy smile. He frowned. &quot;Isn&#39;t that a reason to be more hasty?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If the choice is between having most of my teeth or no teeth at all, I&#39;d prefer the latter. At least then I can get some dentures...&quot;<br />
<br />
Nicky sighed and patted the old man on the shoulder. &quot;OK, but the moment they&#39;re gone, I&#39;m getting the bucket.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marcus ruffled his hair with a toothy grin. &quot;You&#39;re a good kid, you know that?&quot;<br />
<br />
They laid together, Marcus continually sucking on his mouth as his teeth gradually loosened from his gums and dissolved away. Nicky, meanwhile, snuggled into the old man&#39;s soft, fuzzy body. It was like hugging a teddy bear, warm and comfortable. Before long, he began to drift off. A few minutes passed as Marcus focused on the inner workings of his mouth. With a final sweep of the tongue around his gums, he said with a lisp &quot;OK, they&#39;re gone.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; Nicky mumbled, waking from his doze.<br />
<br />
&quot;My teef, I losht &#39;em all now.&quot; He opened his mouth and sure enough, he was toothless. His breath also stank pretty bad.<br />
<br />
Nicky crawled out of his friend&#39;s grip and stared down at him. He was looking ancient now, with plenty of wrinkles and age spots. His bushy eyebrows and white, horseshoe fringe were surpassed by his incredibly long beard that now reached his belly button. He had lost some weight in his old age, resulting in a lot of wrinkled skin folds and stretch marks, but he was still a big man. He wasn&#39;t pretty to look at, but Nicky couldn&#39;t help but enjoy the view. He knew it was cruel to force his friend to get so old but he couldn&#39;t help it. It was fucking hot knowing his best friend was now a senior citizen. He managed to pull his gaze away and turned to reach the bucket. He picked it up and sighed. He&#39;d forgotten to fill it with water. He quick-walked over to the stream and, After a minute, he turned back with a full bucket.<br />
<br />
He was so concentrated on keeping the bucket steady that he failed to notice the upturned root in his path. With a comedic cry, he caught his foot underneath it and tripped, flinging the bucket back towards the stream and landing flat on his face. He grumbled as he pulled himself onto his elbows. Marcus&#39; hoarse laugh echoed around him. &quot;Oh man, stop it!&quot; he cackled, tears streaming down his cheeks. &quot;You&#39;re killing me here!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, yeah, careful or that&#39;ll be literal...&quot; Nicky mumbled as he pulled himself back to his feet and brushed himself off. He looked at the root that had trapped his foot and yanked at it, unable to free himself. His heart sank a little. Marcus had stopped laughing, now rubbing his gnarled hands over his increasingly aged body. He suppressed a yawn, his eyelids drooping. Nicky couldn&#39;t let his friend down like this, he had to free himself. Instead of the root, he yanked on his shoe until his foot slipped out, then ran back to fetch the bucket which had rolled downstream and got stuck on a rock. He waded into the water to retrieve it, then carefully waded back, this time making sure he avoided any obstacles. He looked to his friend and froze. The elderly man had his eyes closed, his head lulled back. Was he too late...?<br />
<br />
&quot;Snnnn-NKKRGH!&quot; Marcus&#39; eyes snapped open and his head shot up as he woke himself up with a snore, before lazily drifting back to a lulling sleep. <br />
<br />
Nicky exhaled in relief, he was still breathing. He stood over his elderly friend and smiled. He looked so serene, he almost didn&#39;t want to wake him. Alas, he had to. He turned the bucket upside-down and drenched the old man, who spluttered and coughed heavily. &quot;Surprise!&quot; Nicky cried out as the stunned man wiped his face clear of water.<br />
<br />
The water dripped over his head, washing out all the suds and truly revealed his advanced bald scalp covered with age spots, wispy white hair still circled the sides of his head. His large forehead was scarred with wrinkles, his bold eyes were buried within a cage of craggy wrinkles and deep crows feet. The rest of his face was obscured by his massive white beard, even his toothless mouth and thin, shrivelled lips. His nose had grown quite prominent, as well as his ears. Nicky gazed down at the wizened old figure sat on the grass, looking like a fat, naked wizard. Marcus stroked his beard in annoyance and scolded in a loud, raspy voice &quot;You&#39;re lucky I didn&#39;t die of shock...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re lucky you didn&#39;t -&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? Speak up, I can barely hear you!&quot; Marcus shoved a shrivelled finger into his earhole, attempting to improve his hearing. But to no avail, he&#39;d need to get hearing aids. <br />
<br />
Nicky stepped closer and spoke louder. &quot;You&#39;re lucky you didn&#39;t die at all! You looked ready to take an eternal slumber...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was ready to take a nap after fucking your tight ass! Honestly...&quot; Marcus paused then asked &quot;How old do you reckon I am?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nicky looked him up and down and shrugged. &quot;Like eighty-something? You&#39;re definitely getting on in years.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s a bit of an understatement. It won&#39;t be long before I pop my clogs.&quot; He cackled lightly, before entering a coughing fit. &quot;Oooh, that&#39;s gonna hurt tomorrow...&quot;<br />
<br />
Nicky helped him up onto the tree stump behind them before Marcus shook off his grip. &quot;I guess we took this too far, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;On the contrary, we could have gone further. I&#39;m still alive right? That&#39;s always a plus.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you&#39;re not mad?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course not, even if I didn&#39;t ask you to surprise me, I did kind of put it on myself by fucking you until I was an old man. Besides, I kinda like it.&quot; He rubbed his flabby body covered with white fur, feeling it&#39;s soft yet leathery texture with a grin.<br />
<br />
Nicky smiled too, happy that his friend wasn&#39;t upset about losing decades off of his life. Then his smile dropped, his friend had willingly lost decades off of his life without a care in the world! They didn&#39;t even know the extent of the shampoo&#39;s power. He scratched at his stubbly chin and pondered aloud &quot;So suppose this stuff doesn&#39;t wear off and we&#39;re both stuck as we are. What do we do?&quot;<br />
<br />
Marcus combed his shaky hands through the long beard that stretched down to his lap. He said &quot;I suppose you&#39;d have to get a job, and somewhere to live if your parents won&#39;t let you stay at home. And we should find me a retirement home. Somewhere I can be cared for in my twilight years... You can come visit me on the weekends, I&#39;ll tell them you&#39;re my grandson. My hunky, young grandson who just loves to be fucked by his grandpa.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you know the average life expectancy in this country is around 80 years? I&#39;ve definitely surpassed that, I&#39;m running on stolen time. And technically you&#39;re partly to blame for that, given how you decided to keep me waiting. The least you can do is stay by my side in my final years.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nicky sighed, Marcus did have a point. But that wasn&#39;t what he meant. He shook his head, saying &quot;No, I meant dude, you&#39;re kinda pissing yourself.&quot; Nicky pointed down to the old man&#39;s crotch where he was absentmindedly urinating across the ground.<br />
<br />
Marcus leaned over to see past his belly, seeing the golden stream he was releasing across the dirt. &quot;Huh... Couldn&#39;t even feel that happening.&quot; he said, a little confused. &quot;Just another wonder of old age, ay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nicky rolled his eyes. Marcus had incontinence issues. But he was embarrassed to admit that it kind of turned him on a little. This day was just full of weird surprises... As the stream subsided, Nicky sat on the floor and laid back against the old man&#39;s side, huddling up to his furry, bearded body. What if they didn&#39;t find a way to get younger? Marcus didn&#39;t seem to have much time left, likely a few years at most. He would lose his best friend... Which meant they would have to make every moment count together. They sat together in silence for a moment, Nicky resting on the elderly man&#39;s fat stomach, Marcus slowly running his fingers through the young man&#39;s fluffy hair.<br />
<br />
Eventually, Marcus cleared his throat, but his voice remained hoarse and shaky. &quot;I was serious about the retirement home, by the way. I doubt my parents would look after me now I&#39;m so old. I&#39;d much prefer to live my finals moments in comfort, with professionals to care for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nicky patted the old man&#39;s leg and jumped to his feet, saying &quot;We&#39;re gonna have to get you out of the woods first before deciding anything else. Can you walk?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nicky held out his hands and strained as he helped Marcus up to his feet. The old man continued to grip onto Nicky as he took a few steps before slowly lowering himself back onto the stump. He rubbed his sore knees and grunted &quot;I can&#39;t do it without support. I&#39;m going to need a walking frame. Or one of those electric scooters.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nicky sighed. &quot;Well you can forget about a scooter, you wouldn&#39;t be able to navigate one of those out here.&quot; He scratched his chin once more. Plus sized clothes, dentures, hearing aids, a walking aid. Marcus was asking a lot out of him. What was he going to do...</p>
