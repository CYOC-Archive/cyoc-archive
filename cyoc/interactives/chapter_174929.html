<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Joanna couldn&#39;t believe the gall of her mother.  None of this had needed to happen.  This body, its ridiculous proportions, the theft of her name, and now even an innocent clerk was stuck permanently posed as some store piece.  Looking down at her strained shirt, she could barely see around her mountainous tits, capped with absurdly overlong nipples.  Her life for the immediate future was ruined, and her mother had the gall to fish for compliments on her torture?  She ground her teeth, making sure to intentionally avoid saying anything.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well?  Speak up!  Or, are you contradicting me, again?&quot;  Her mother stepped in front of her to prevent movement toward the front.  &quot;I&#39;ve taken a good deal of time away from my busy day to accommodate your needs, and I&#39;m even going out of the way to buy you a machine to help with your body.  I want to hear your thoughts on your milker.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joanna couldn&#39;t stand it any more.  &quot;You want to know what I think about this?  Alright.  The clerk was completely right.  It&#39;s useless for what you claimed to want, and now it&#39;s damaged my breasts so badly that the other cups won&#39;t fit over them.  If your goal was to prove that womens&#39; breasts weren&#39;t udders, you&#39;ve picked the absolute worst way to prove it, because that&#39;s literally what you&#39;ve made my breasts into.  This machine wasn&#39;t made for humans, it was made for cows.  In fact, I think it&#39;d be a better fit for you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How dare-&quot;<br />
<br />
Joanna wasn&#39;t yet done.  &quot;How dare I what?!  Speak my mind?  Oh gee, I wonder why I&#39;m doing that, mom!  You&#39;ve always been a bitch when it comes to anything less than positive compliments, and that&#39;s why you have so few friends.  You get into a hobby, find a new friend group, and then they toss you out when they realize what a toxic person you really are.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her mother looked to on the verge of having an aneurysm.  Her eyes bulged and her teeth were fully bared.  She seemed beyond words for several seconds as she ground her teeth, looking ready to rip the box out of Joanna&#39;s hands and tear her apart.  However, she sucked in a deep breath, and regained her composure.  &quot;You are completely wrong about everything, and you are going to seriously regret what you&#39;ve said.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever.&quot;  Joanna continued to walk toward the front desk, but her body froze in place.<br />
<br />
Her mother re-entered her vision with her phone in-hand.  &quot;You proved the events so far have been woefully unable to properly appreciate the female body.&quot;  She seemed to be tapping through the the chronivac app.  &quot;Now, what&#39;s the most appropriate...Ah-hah, here we are!&quot;  With two more clicks, Joanna began to feel nauseous as her mother pulled the box away from her.  &quot;I&#39;ll even carry this for you, once you&#39;re done getting into shape.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you d-&quot;  was as far as Joanna got before she doubled over.  What she thought was a sinking feeling in her stomach was apparently more physical than she&#39;d realized.  Clutching her stomach, she felt her stomach slowly pulse outward.<br />
<br />
Her first thought was pregnancy.  Surely, the chronivac was capable of spawning a pregnancy?  Her stomach continued to bloat outwards as her mind reeled over how many children her mother may have put in her.  Was she speeding up a pregnancy of one child?  No, her gut was already easily larger than a single child.  Perhaps it was twins?  Or was it ten or a hundred children, but they weren&#39;t accelerated?  She had no idea what the chronivac&#39;s limits were in this area.  She tentatively pressed her hand into her still-growing gut as it burst the button to her jeans.<br />
<br />
It was soft.  She&#39;d expected it to be under some kind of pressure, but this feeling was more like...<br />
<br />
Moving her hands to her breasts, she realized the feeling was similar.  Regaining her composure, Joanna peered past her breasts.  Now that she&#39;d calmed down, she realized her expanding gut was already pulling away from her stomach, separating it from her body just like a giant tit.  It was already larger than both of her regular breasts combined, and it was still pulsing with growth.<br />
<br />
The mass began to reshape, but it stayed a single mass.  The flesh took on a shade of pink as four nipples even longer than her original pair grew on its distant edge.  It didn&#39;t take Joanna long to realize what had happened.  &quot;You grew a cow udder on me?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You said your machine was made for cows.  I don&#39;t think it was.  So now, you can prove you&#39;re right.&quot;  Joanna groaned as she felt milk flood into her new appendage.  &quot;You&#39;ve started with an udder that&#39;d make dairy cows jealous, and you&#39;ll be keeping it until you milk it away.&quot;<br />
<br />
The pressure was far worse than what she&#39;d felt in her breasts.  Joanna attempted to stand, but found the new organ was far heavier than the milk machine.  &quot;How can I-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve added a new rule.  Every day you fully milk your udders, it will shrink a little.  Every minute you leave your udders full, it will grow a little.  All you need to do is never fail to fully milk your udders for a year, and it&#39;ll be gone.  Don&#39;t worry about walking around, the chronivac will improve your legs as needed.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Joanna heaved herself upright as her mother spoke, struggling to keep her pants up as the udder hung heavily on her legs.  She felt a constant pressure that ached far more than her breasts ever had.  The udder had finally ceased growing, or so she had thought.  There was a sudden pulse as it inched very slightly outward.  &quot;You didn&#39;t-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Start it full?  Yes.  You may want to deal with it when we get home.  But first, we&#39;ll need to get you some new shirts, pants, bras, and I&#39;ve got my own shopping list.  I may also have a few other stops on the way home.&quot;  Joanna started to rub the teats of her udder, but her mother swatted her hands.  &quot;Didn&#39;t you hear all the things we needed to get done today?! You can get that done when we get home!&quot;</p>
