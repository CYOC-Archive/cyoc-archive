<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Putting one hoof in front of the other... <br />
<br />
Keeping calm and using your human intelligence in ways that a mere jackass could never have achieved, you found an open gate, made your escape from the farm, and followed the road until it reached the highway that you recognized at once. You, as a human, had traveled it almost daily to and from your work.<br />
<br />
It had felt cathartic to also leave behind the scene of your humbling surrender to the donkey&#39;s base instinct. As you began to put considerable distance between yourself, the farm, and that female jenny, the intense memories began to subside enough that your large donkey cock became less readily apparent inside its abdominal sheath. <br />
<br />
Cars on the highway sped past at speeds that rendered them as dark blurs, but a few of them were driven by idiots who honked horns or even yelled insults out the window at the stray donkey trotting steadily towards home. You ignored them in favor of working out your plan.<br />
<br />
Pleading with the donkey in the aftermath of the switch hadn&#39;t worked. You were prepared for the eventuality he might still not wish to give your body back to you. Keeping that in mind, your thoughts turned to your wife. You had married three years ago. There were no kids yet. Both of you wanted to prioritize careers for the time being. You convinced yourself that, if anyone could do so, she would look past the appearance of the donkey and recognize her husband. You even entertained the fantasy that she had already detected something not right with the former donkey now masquerading as an impostor  in your former life. <br />
<br />
Your hooves clacked on the asphalt as you took an exit off the highway. Your huge ears twitched and you flared your nostrils in nervous anticipation. Your journey was getting closer to its destination. You had reached the outskirts of your suburban neighborhood. The deceiver in your body would soon be unmasked and the world would be right again.<br />
<br />
You wanted to say something noteworthy, but the attempt resulted only in the discordant bray typical for your new species and sparked a new fear. You didn&#39;t want to bring too much attention to yourself as a donkey, which would not exactly be welcomed within the hallowed confines of your suburban neighborhood. <br />
<br />
Clip clop. Clip clop. Clip clop. The sound of your hooves on the quiet roads in your neighborhood worried you. Late in the evening, a few neighbors remained active outdoors. A couple of men used weed-eaters to keep their yards immaculately trimmed. Why did the thought of lush lawn grass make your stomach grumble? You didn&#39;t need to wake the hungry ass at this critical moment. <br />
<br />
An aroma of grilling steaks and summer vegetables from backyard barbecues could not be avoided. Your large nostrils at the tip of your wide snout flared to receive more of the tangible scents.<br />
<br />
Your tail lifted, an automatic response, to let you move a pile of steaming donkey droppings onto the curb. Distressed, you very nearly broke out into harsh braying. You struggled to get your breathing back under control. &quot;Hee...hee...hee...&quot; You sides heaved.<br />
<br />
You trotted past your mailbox. You trotted up the driveway toward the carport. You smelled the odor of a fine cigar. Not just any cigar. One of your own cigars...<br />
<br />
You saw a dark blur standing at the back patio, a cloud of smoke wafting around its head.<br />
<br />
It was you! Or, to be more exact, it was the donkey now occupying your human form. And enjoying the full benefits of your life, including an after-dinner cigar.<br />
<br />
The dark form walked closer. The donkey had seen you and walked over with maddening calm and grabbed the bridle that you had forgotten. The impersonator shook his head. &quot;Now, what do you think you are doing here?&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Use the Medal! Switch us back!&quot; Your demands came out as two loud, obnoxious, humiliating brays.<br />
<br />
The man puffed on the cigar and blew some of the smoke toward your muzzle, which he controlled with the bridle in his hand. &quot;Now, even if I wanted to do that, and I don&#39;t, did you forget? We&#39;re not able to use the medallion to reverse our situations until midnight.&quot;<br />
<br />
The sun looked like a dull tarnished glow on the horizon. Midnight might still be several hours away. You brayed again from sheer frustration.<br />
<br />
The man winced at the sound he used to make. &quot;You should be proud, I suppose. For a mere ass, managing to make your way here is quite impressive, but you&#39;re not changing my mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Honey, what in the hell?&quot; You heard her voice. &quot;I knew I heard a donkey. Where did it come from?&quot;<br />
<br />
For the moment, you could only stare at the woman with the dull brown eyes of a dumb beast as she stepped onto the deck in bare feet wearing only one of your shirts unbuttoned enough spaces to show the familiar swell of her upper breasts. For the first time, you noticed the man was only wearing a pair of lounge pants and no shirt. In a realization that left you feeling betrayed you realized that they had had sex. You could even smell it on them. Your wife had been fooled by the donkey fraudulently posing as human in your body.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s me!&quot; You brayed in desperation. &quot;Can&#39;t you recognize me! I&#39;m your husband! Not him!&quot;<br />
<br />
You needed the medallion. If your own wife couldn&#39;t recognize you and the donkey refused to help, you&#39;d find it yourself. You pulled free of the man and shoved past your startled wife as you tried to fit your sizable form through the back door to your home.<br />
<br />
Your wife screamed from fear. You had frightened her. <br />
<br />
The donkey in your body spoke angrily. &quot;Stay back. It seems agitated.&quot;<br />
<br />
The donkey&#39;s mind had been brought to the surface, and the donkey didn&#39;t want anything to do with the narrow door of a human home. The hesitation the donkey caused allowed the man to regain your bridle.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry!&quot; You brayed toward your wife. &quot;I would never hurt you! Please, please, you have to help me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Go inside,&quot; the donkey happy inside your former body instructed your wife. &quot;Call animal services and have them send out someone.&quot;<br />
<br />
She took one last look at you and her horrified expression shattered all your illusions. She wasn&#39;t seeing her husband and lover. She only saw a hideous, ugly, smelly, dumb donkey as the animal continued to bray in a manner she interpreted as aggressive and dangerous.<br />
<br />
&quot;You be careful,&quot; she warned her husband before stepping inside the house to make the phone call.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are just making things more difficult,&quot; the former donkey said in perfect English. &quot;That was a nice farm you escaped. No telling where you&#39;ll end up now.&quot;</p>
