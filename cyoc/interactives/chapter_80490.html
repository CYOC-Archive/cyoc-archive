<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You have remained undetected so far, but decide not to push your luck. "I wish nobody would not notice me until I wish otherwise." Quickening your pace you catch up with Ms. French and inevitably begin to admire her body. Her nudity from before was still on your mind, it would be a shame to simply turn her into a gecko, or something like that. Your pants began to strain as images of Ms. French covered in scales flooded your mind. The corners of your mouth curled up in a wicked grin.<br>
<br>
Ms. French enters one of the typical family homes and kicks her high heels off with the door still open, giving you plenty of time to slip inside behind her. As she ascends the stairs you notice she has no pictures of a husband and children, a quick wish verifies that she is single and lives alone. You follow her up the stairs -presumably to her room- and make your wish.<br>
<br>
The first signs of transformation appeared on her legs; black scales forming beneath the nylon of her pantyhose. You had trouble peeling your eyes away from her legs as she sauntered into her bedroom, her sexiness only increasing with every second. She herself was still completely unaware of her changes as she plopped down on her queen sized bed. With a smile you note that scales had already appeared on her nose while her eyebrows were falling out as the skin underneath keratinized into a row of black scales. Ms. French sighed as she shifted her hips, somehow unable to get her plump ass comfortable; she fluttered her eyes and swatted at them. She looked a bit puzzled at the eyebrow hairs she had caught between her fingers, but then she noticed her fingernails. "But I just clipped them yesterday." Her eyes went wide when she saw how they were getting longer and darker before her very eyes. If not for your carefully worded wish she would have screamed at her next observation: scales growing on her hand.<br>
<br>
Ms. French shot upright on her bed, leaving behind thick clumps of her hair. She rolled up her sleeve and watched in shock as an already considerable covering of scales continued to spread. A quick look at her other arm confirmed the same thing was happening there. Her eyes darted over her correspondingly transforming legs to her chest. Looking down her cleavage she let out a shocked gasp and in her near panic tore off her blouse. Between her breasts was a patch of scales with a yellow color. With her bra she was more careful, reaching behind her back to unhook it. Her growing claws made it more difficult than usual but it soon came loose and fell down her shoulders. She watched wide-eyed how yellow scales were enveloping her breasts, areolae hardening to join the rest of the patch as nearly circular scales. A clawed finger probed one of the new scales. It was more flexible then the surrounding scales and retained a nipple-like shape in the middle, even getting hard with arousal. Underneath the scales her mammary glands were transforming into soft tissue, leaving her breasts unable to produce milk and purely decorative. She squeezed her firm changing globes. "Why am I getting turned on...?" Standing only a few steps away you smile knowingly.<br>
<br>
Ms. French blinks in surprise as a clump of hair falls on her lap. Instinctively she reaches for her hair and finds that she can easily pull it loose. She looks up at the mirror above the dresser and stares into the yellowing eyes of a woman pulling her hair out. "Is that me? What am I becoming?" At this point it seemed natural to her to rid herself of her remaining hair. Thanks to your wish she was more intrigued and aroused than frightened by her peculiar transformation. Soon her lovely hair lay lifeless on her bed, leaving her head completely bald. She ran a clawed hand over it to get a feel for the large dark scales forming on top. They started on her forehead, a bit below where her hairline had been, getting wider as they went up and over her scalp and down again to her nape where they transitioned to a smaller type that ran all the way down her spine. Their subtle bumps and ridges gave her head an interesting texture. "Hm, almost like crocodilian scutes," she muttered. Her temples were covered in smaller scales that got even smaller and finer near her face. Slowly (slower than she had intended) she got up and took a few steps towards the mirror.<br>
<br>
With slow movements she pulled her remaining clothes down her legs, noting the claws on her feet and the short but growing tail that popped free. She reached for a hand mirror on her dresser with the same annoyingly slow speed. "I must have turned ectothermic." She held it between her legs and spread her scaley labia just in time to witness her urinal tract and anus merging with her vagina to form a single hole. "Well, I have a cloaca now," she said as she probed the pink nub and confirmed that it still worked, causing her to blush for the very last time. Very soon afterward she was completely covered in scales and had a tail dangling behind her. Ms. French was now the reptile woman you wanted her to be.<br>
<br>
Looking back in the mirror she decided to review her changes starting with her head. She ran her clawed hands over the sides. "Hm, seems like an anapsid skull," she began, "No external ears, but my cheeks and nose are still there." Opening her mouth revealed sharp pointy and a forked tongue. "Oh my! Am I carnivorous?" Experimentally she flicked out her tongue and as it retracted it hit her vomeronasal organ, giving her a good taste of the air around her. "Interesting." She licked her scaly lips. "Could be either a lizard or snake tongue, not sure which but I saw a tracheal extension like a snake's." Next she cupped her breasts in slowed movements. "Don't know why these are still here but I'm not complaining. Probably can't lactate anymore, though," she said as she ran her fingers over her nipple scales, "Also, are they bigger? Almost looks like they have gone up a cup." One hand let go and made a long trek down her stomach. "Ventral scales? Sure looks like it. And no navel too. I guess that comes with the territory." Her other hand now ran down her side, creating a rasping sound. "These look like lizard scales, and yet I also have scutes and ventral scales." The hand trailing her stomach had now reached her scaly vulva. Slowly and sensually she dipped a finger between her slit and into her moist pink hole. "Not to mention my cloaca and the fact that I'm now ectotherm. I seem to be a little bit of everything but I'm definitely a reptile."<br>
<br>
You chuckle at the gorgeous reptilian babe in front of you, pondering what to do next.</p>
