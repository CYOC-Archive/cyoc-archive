<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After a month or so of training you had a pretty good control of your magic in your body. You were still using your muscles, but now you were able to sprint and hit things very hard. Although you weren&#39;t quite able to figure out any special magic or how to recreate your youth punch. <br />
<br />
During a dinner your mother was talking about a pilgrimage to some woods to get in touch with relatives that lived there. Pugn said &quot;Sounds like a decent idea, Kid&#39;s gotten strong enough to beat most people down to the ground so no need to worry about animals or danger. Besides maybe the woods can help awaken some sort of unique magic in him.&quot; <br />
<br />
A few days of preparations latter you, your mother, and your sister went on a long trip to the forest. Nearly a whole day of road trip latter you found yourselves in a small village in the trees. The light  was dim, but your family had made plans and going into the only bar in the area your group was waved to by an elf with rag like clothes with unbrushed tangled hair. Your mother went to the table as your sister joined and you lagged behind a little. The elf said &quot;Ah, Stella it&#39;s been too long. You&#39;ve gotten a cute young one and a nice strong bodyguard.&quot; <br />
<br />
Your mother smiled and said &quot;Indeed Sara, My young one and my bodyguard could use a little meditation.&quot; <br />
<br />
Sara said &quot;The young one for sure, but your orc? We&#39;ve got good places for him with some others.&quot; <br />
<br />
Your mother was a little uncertain trying to think if she should tell Sara about your relationship but said &quot;Probably a good idea, have him socialize with other orcs.&quot; <br />
<br />
Sara said &quot;Don&#39;t worry, the orcs here are rather nice. We can quickly get to my hut, and during the day he can come to town and we&#39;ll introduce him to  some of the orcs in the area.&quot; After a small amount of chit chat they stood up and got ready to move to the hut which you followed as their bodyguard. A few hours of walking in the near dark (and one dead bear) later and the three of you had managed to approach a tree hut. After a ladder climb all of you had gotten into the hut where there was a lot of leaves for you to sleep on. Tired you just collapsed and your sister went besides you to sleep as well. Slightly more comfortable than some nights at the Arena so you couldn&#39;t complain, but something about the woods felt odd. When you awoke the four of you went back to the village where you were shown to  a training area where a bunch of orcs were punching each other. Sara said &quot;Oi, Got a bodyguard here wanting to try to do things!&quot; <br />
<br />
One of the Orcs yelled &quot;K, Leave him here and we&#39;ll see how good he is!&quot; You looked to your elven family who were already walking away. The fighting styles were rough, but with seeing people fight in the Arena daily and your training you felt you could fight pretty well. You found a sparring partner relatively fast, an Orc that seemed somewhat younger and less developed. With your magically enhanced speed you struck first and with your magically enhanced strength he was knocked down really fast. Some of the Orcs watching roared and you got a few more challenges. They took a bit longer than the first guy, and you took a few blows but guy by guy you managed to force them down. <br />
<br />
After fighting the last guy you were breathing heavily as your body was pretty bruised when an older orc with greying hair and beard came over where you said &quot;Not another fight... I&#39;m a bit winded...&quot; <br />
<br />
The orc chuckled and said &quot;Nah, I heard there was a new orc. Although I see some interesting features in you. A half-breed of some kind? I just wanted to have a chat over some dinner.&quot; <br />
<br />
You sighed and said &quot;That sound nice... Something to eat sounds good.&quot; <br />
<br />
The orc chuckled and said &quot;Great, by the way my name&#39;s Groth by the way.&quot; <br />
<br />
starting to walk with Groth you said &quot;and mine is Kid.&quot; <br />
<br />
The orc chuckled on your walk where you got to a nearby hut. Outside there was a female Orc cooking on a stove outside and a little girl orc playing joyfully through the leaves. Groth said &quot;Oi, Honey and Sweety! We&#39;ve got company!&quot; <br />
<br />
The little girl looked over and said &quot;Hi PA!!!&quot; and the woman said &quot;Well we&#39;ve got more than enough for us three so that&#39;s fine. What&#39;s the occasion?&quot; <br />
<br />
Groth yelled &quot;Got a guy able to beat up most everyone in the village! Also came with a bunch of city elves, figured he could use a good orcish meal!&quot; Going into the hut there was a largish table set up, and the girl came in happily bouncing to a tall chair. Groth chuckled and said &quot;So this big girl here&#39;s Sonia, and my wife out there is Corin. We&#39;ve been in this forest for over a decade and it&#39;s been happy times for us all. Corin makes some of the best Orc dishes!&quot; <br />
<br />
Corin came in with dishes of meaty and nutty dishes and said &quot;Indeed I do!&quot; After they said some thanks for the food they all started tearing into the food with their forks and knives. The elf in you made you a bit more timid and get less food, but you managed to get a decent amount. The food was a lot more... Raw then what you ate with the elves, but there was something nice about it. <br />
<br />
You let out a sigh of pleasure and said &quot;That was a good meal... Very satisfying.&quot; <br />
<br />
Groth asked &quot;Better than that stuff the elves feeding you?&quot; <br />
<br />
You said &quot;umm... The elves who hire me often let me eat with them. Their food is superior in a lot of ways, better and more varied ingredients, Extremely skilled cooks, but this food is satisfying on a more basic level.&quot; <br />
<br />
Corrin said &quot;Well it warm&#39;s a girl&#39;s heart hearing her cooking&#39;s better than some five star cook.&quot; <br />
<br />
Groth asked &quot;How&#39;d you even get hired by those guys anyways?&quot; <br />
<br />
You said &quot;Well... I was in the Arena working as a sort of slave you could say... Was able to fight once and the Elves saw magic in my strikes... Such magic was why I was able to smack all those orcs down.&quot; You saw them looking at you where you said &quot;although it&#39;s just a strength and speed enhancement right now.&quot; <br />
<br />
Groth chuckled and said &quot;Ah so you can use magic? Ever heard of ancestral might?&quot; <br />
<br />
You wonder &quot;What exactly is that?&quot; <br />
<br />
Groth said &quot;We have some holy sites to some of our ancestors. Pray and get a blessing from our ancestors and our strength is enhanced with that of our ancestors. If you&#39;re interested in magic, I&#39;ll go ahead and show you the way. You obviously are of age.&quot; <br />
<br />
The ears of Sonia perked up as she said &quot;We got some more visitors!&quot; <br />
<br />
There was a knock on the door and you heard your mothers voice ask in a kind of shaky &quot;Excuse me? Is Kid with you?&quot; <br />
<br />
Corrin said &quot;Yes he&#39;s with us! Come on in we were just finishing dinner.&quot; <br />
<br />
the handle opened and looking you saw your mother and your little sister at the door, and your mother said &quot;Kid we&#39;re going to need t- EEEEEEEEE!&quot; and ran away. <br />
<br />
You got up and went to the door and said &quot;Mam! are you what&#39;s wrong?!?&quot; You watched as she went into the woods by herself. Leaving your sister by herself... you asked &quot;Could you look after the Young One here? I need to go and protect her...&quot; <br />
<br />
Corrin nodded and said &quot;We shall for now. Go on.&quot; <br />
<br />
Groth said &quot;I&#39;ll go with you. You shouldn&#39;t go out in the woods alone.&quot; The two of you left  trying to find your mother.</p>
