<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;... I think I am gonna go hit the gym and swim some laps before I study for next week's tests. Tony, I choose you this evening. Strip and turn in to my Speedo for tonight.&quot; said Roger as he bent over and untied his shoes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... what?&quot; asked Tony looking confused. &quot;You are totally insa-&quot; he suddenly jerked upright from the sofa, standing up and pulling his shirt up over his head so quickly he practically threw his shirt at the ceiling.<br />
<br />
Roger continued to casually pull his pants and underwear off as Tony looked at him, wide eyed. &quot;What's going o-&quot; Tony again couldn't finish his statement. He jerked downward pulling his pants off and kicked off his shoes and socks with another stuff motion as if he was under control of a puppet master nobody could see.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell is going on?&quot; Kit asked looking at Roger. &quot;This is weirding me out man.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is he doing?&quot; Hulk said looking at the now naked Tony. He did not understand either, but soon they all would. Roger just grinned and pulled his shirt up as he stepped toward Tony.<br />
<br />
Grunting Tony fell to his knees. He gritted his teeth as he began to feel something strange spread all through his body, like his veins were suddenly filled with spiders spreading down from his head to his toes. He smelled something, then tasted something, then felt his guts rumble. What was that smell? Slightly familiar, and then he was thrust forward hard.<br />
<br />
He had time to say &quot;Hey!&quot; before he suddenly thrust his arms around Rogers naked waist, hugging him tight, wrapping his arms around behind Roger and then stuffing his face in to Roger's crotch. He felt the heat of Rogers sex pressed hard to his face. He couldn't pull away, he was stuck fast, and his arms were suddenly feeling very strange.<br />
<br />
They stretched and darkened, growing flatter as they shrank thin and black, turning to stretchy dark fabric. His back arched and his legs slid between Roger's, his knees bent, his body flexed impossibly. His feet came up behind Roger and connected with the black waistband that his arms had formed. His toes melted in to it, his legs pulling upward and spreading out to become black spandex that covered Roger's ass. At the same time his face felt tight, his head was flattening, his hair smoothing in to the fabric he was becoming as he formed the front of Roger's new Speedo.<br />
<br />
Between Roger's legs the struggling form of Tony ascended, stretching and flattening. All over Roger Tony was growing tighter as he shrank, forming the final bits of Roger's Speedo, a little drawstring emerged from Tony, he felt it as if it was part of his face. He felt the stitches and the logo appear on his shoulder, or the spot on him that had been his shoulder but was now just part of the waist on the Speedo he had become.<br />
<br />
He was tight, stretched over Roger's package which bulged warm in his face. He could see, he could hear, he could feel. He could not move or speak. He was immobile entirely and aware of a yelling noise.<br />
<br />
It was Hulk and Kit. Both babbling hysterically as they witnesses their frat brother become a piece of clothing. Roger stood in front of them now dressed in only a tight black Speedo. He gripped his package and adjusted himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;There. All dressed up and ready to go. Oh stop panicking you two. It's fun! It doesn't hurt and it only lasts until sunrise. Look Kit, you can do whatever you want to Hulk here. Just be careful how you word it.&quot; He said, making gestures with his hands to calm the frightened boys. Kit was understanding, Hulk however was still terrified.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll leave you two alone to talk it over. I'm going to get my gym bag before I walk to the rec center pool. Later skaters.&quot; Roger pulled up his pants, put on his shirt, and turned and walked away toward the front door. Tony could not see, all was darkness while Roger was dressed. He didn't feel uncomfortable, in fact, he felt just fine. He was slightly irritated at the mess he had agreed to, but for now he felt a strange sense of contentment. He was a speedo, and he was being worn, and take to swim. Part of him that had not been there before was satisfied. How strange, he thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... bye.&quot; He heard Kit say, and then heard the door close. He felt Roger's legs moving in him, he felt himself moving around Roger, subtly stretching and contracting as he walked.<br />
<br />
&quot;So Hulk. Um... I guess I can play with you. If that's ok?&quot; Kit said shyly looking at Hulk, who looked back, eyes wide in horror at what he had just seen, mind racing with the thoughts of what would happen next.</p>
