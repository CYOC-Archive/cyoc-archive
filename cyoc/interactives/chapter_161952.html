<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jacob rested his dickhead against the freaky blue thighs of his alien &#39;owner&#39;. Normally, he&#39;d get hard just to show his dominance, but after sixth times in a row, his slit was still drizzling cum for every errand twitch. His mind was pleasantly hazy, almost like he was on the verge of falling asleep after a good fuck. Ah! Almost. But he couldn&#39;t just become quiet right after his owner had listened to him. It&#39;d create the impression that Jacob just needed to be jerked off to be controlled.<br />
<br />
He was the fucking Alpha Cock here and he wasn&#39;t gonna forget why they&#39;d had a bit of a marathon.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, Mint, you gonna listen to your dick or not?&quot; Jacob drawled, rubbing his head against the blue skin.<br />
<br />
Mint softly cursed under his breath. &quot;It&#39;s been fucking two hours, Jacob. I need to get work done too. Our dicking experiment needs a more varied response from the subjects. So far, the fear response lasts far too long. We need a few more cooperative subjects to skew the data the right way. I don&#39;t have time to fulfill your fantasies. They could shut down the project and restore some of the dicks back to human form.&quot;<br />
<br />
That gave Jacob pause. &quot;... Not me, right?&quot; He&#39;d awakened as his true form, no way was he gonna lose it because of some pussy footing scientists from planet Centuri3xfwhatever.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dick if I know,&quot; Mint shrugged, typing aggressively.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, dude, I think I have the solution to your problem.&quot;<br />
<br />
Blue fingers grabbed him by the shaft and shoved him downward. &quot;I am not rubbing you until this evening at the earliest, Jacob.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob shuddered and snorted. &quot;Eh, no, fucker,&quot; he said affectionately. &quot;I meant a real solution. I know just the guys you should dick.&quot;<br />
<br />
He couldn&#39;t see Mint&#39;s face, but he would bet the alien was looking skeptical. And interested. &quot;Your so-called &#39;cock list&#39;?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but I&#39;ll skip to the top for you. Your computer&#39;s got a list of the students on campus, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
A slightly longer hesitation. &quot;Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pull up two names. Charles Powell. Fucking size queen. Takes the best cock right up his ass and he never accepts anything smaller than his own nine inches. Joey Cook. Eh, Joey &#39;Cock&#39; will fit him perfectly. T&#39;was all fated or some shit, huh? Should have known when I saw his meat, bastard&#39;s like ten inches and his python&#39;s spits like a fucking hose. Balls like baseballs too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob felt himself grow stiff, the taste of cum more vivid in his &#39;mouth&#39;. He could picture those cocks perfectly, the memory of a couple of nights of messing around coming back to him. Next time, they&#39;d all be the best part of themselves. Though, strangely enough, he couldn&#39;t quite remember their faces. They were a bit blurry in his recollection, but whatever. In his mind, he could see their dicks at eye-level with him now, and they&#39;d get rubbed together, shaft against shaft, balls slapping...<br />
<br />
He gurgled pre and his view shifted enough to let him see Mint, glaring downward at him. &quot;Is this another one of your revenge plots, Jacob?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The fuck are you on, Mint? Those two are my best mates.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You *want* your friends dicked?&quot; Mint asked slowly.<br />
<br />
Jacob twitched and bopped up and down. &quot;Fuck yeah! Of course I&#39;d want my mates to realize how much better life is when you&#39;re your own meat. They&#39;ll thank me once they learn the truth. They&#39;re always messing around with the reserves on the football team. They&#39;ll get those pussies under their thumbs in like, five minutes. Real alphas, you get me, Mint?&quot;<br />
<br />
A large, sadistic grin split Mint&#39;s face, like he knew something Jacob, his Alpha Cock, wouldn&#39;t. Yeah, right. &quot;Oh, I do, Jacob. I think I need to make a few arrangements.&quot;<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Isaac winced when he heard the locker doors close.<br />
<br />
He&#39;d entered the university&#39;s team to improve his own body. He trained every other day, practiced with the team, but he was still not as built as the stars Coach Walker favored. It hadn&#39;t done him a lot of favor, only left him an a couple others hopeful to play waterbearer and benchwarmers and cocksuckers for most of the games of the season. Till last month, when a few of the best players up and vanished. The dean had released a statement that nothing was wrong, but that was the same as giving free reign to the gossips on campus. And boy, they said the craziest shit. His groin heated up at the thought. Some... some of the rumors sounded...<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, you know the drill!&quot; Joey fucking Cook grabbed him by the arm.<br />
<br />
Yeah. It had always been like this, but since they were missing players and now Isaac was actually playing, any mistake he made meant a lot more servicing...<br />
<br />
Luke, the other reserve, didn&#39;t say much when he was dragged along Isaac into the shower room. He&#39;d already taken off his boxers, knowing they might get ripped if he didn&#39;t comply quickly enough. They&#39;d learned that lesson early on.<br />
<br />
Charles wasted no time turning on the water to &#39;hide&#39; the noise. Why they bothered, he wasn&#39;t sure. Coach Walker didn&#39;t give a shit what his best players did with the second-rates.<br />
<br />
Isaac swallowed as he was pushed against the tiles of the shower wall, Joey looming over him. Objectively, Joey had a great body, like a bull, all muscles and with a big slab of meat right between his legs. Shame his personality sucked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t be a fucking pussy, Isaac. You&#39;ve played with my snake before.&quot;<br />
<br />
Isaac nodded and dragged his hands down Joey&#39;s chest. He teased a bit, not a lot, trying to play to things he&#39;d noticed Joey liked. Maybe this time around, he&#39;d be allowed to cum after service...<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, yeah,&quot; he heard Charles say as the other player grabbed Luke&#39;s hair and started thrusting.<br />
<br />
Isaac tuned out the noise. Tuned out the feeling of the cock stiffening under his fingers. God, he was so hard. Why couldn&#39;t that dick Joey just fuck him instead of just looming over him like a cardboard cut-out of a pornstar?<br />
<br />
There was a flash, and a rush of cold air.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-what?&quot;<br />
<br />
Joey and Charles were gone. Luke choked on the large cock still in his mouth, attached to nothing but its big sloshing balls. With a faint cry of shock, Luke pulled back, the dick making a smacking noise as slid past his lips. Shiny with saliva, the dick flopped about in Luke&#39;s grip.<br />
<br />
&quot;What in the world?&quot; Luke mumbled, unsure how to hold the penis now that he wasn&#39;t being intimidated by a quarterback.<br />
<br />
Isaac opened his mouth, but couldn&#39;t find a proper reply to that. He looked down, and realized the weight on his foot was actually another disembodied dick, one startingly like Joey&#39;s. The rumors on campus came back to mind. Maybe... maybe they weren&#39;t as crazy as he had thought...<br />
<br />
A message in neon green light flickered in the air. <br />
<br />
&quot;Jacob wishes you a &#39;good time, you lucky fuckers&#39;,&quot; Isaac read out loud, even less confident than before.</p>
