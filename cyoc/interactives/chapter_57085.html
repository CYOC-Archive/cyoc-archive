<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The walk home was almost agonising. We walked only 5 minutes but it seemed longer, the anticipation in my gut was truly something else.<br />
<br />
He held my hand at the door, another reminder of this young teen's strength, size and dominance. I was loving every minute of it.<br />
<br />
&quot;This you little man?&quot; Jin asked smiling down at me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh huh,&quot; I breathed, still a little giddy at my luck, &quot;Come in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Give me the key.&quot; Jin didn't ask. I obeyed instantly.<br />
<br />
He then bent forward and lifted me into the air, holding me in his arms he unlocked the door and carried me upstair. All 9 flights of them, although by the 4th he was slowing down.<br />
<br />
Jin joked &quot;You're so light.&quot; Am idea struck me at that comment and I smiled to myslef.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, you're just very, very strong.&quot; I leant up and kissed his cheek.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good boy.&quot; Jin laughed again. He was so dominant, everything he did and said screamed 'I'm in control and you love it.'<br />
<br />
I did.<br />
<br />
He opened my door, supporting my weight in one arm. He then gently lowered me to the ground and bending down kissed me, his large lips meeting mine. His tongue invaded my mouth welcomingly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm, you taste good.&quot; Jin purred.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Jin.&quot; I giggled again. I loved this new coy me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Need the bathroom.&quot; I pointed him the way and Jin headed off.<br />
<br />
Quickly I jumped on the PC and turned the monitor back on.<br />
<br />
I began to type:<br />
<br />
'All Asian men are incredibly strong. On average they can lift a ton without difficulty. All Black men are capable of taking up to 15 inches anally without difficulty and without losing tightness and are all able to achieve orgasm through this method. I am considered a perfect specimen of what Asian men desire.'<br />
<br />
I clicked enter quickly and shut down the monitor again.<br />
<br />
Jin walked back into the room, he looked even more confident.<br />
<br />
I leant back in the chair, lifting my shirt a little as I stretched. I saw Jin's eyes dilate at this. His face a little flushed he smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it true then?&quot; I said caressing my chest a little.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Jin smiled, he was enjoying this game as much as me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Asian strength? I mean you look strong, but are you as strong as they say all Asian men are?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jin folded his arms over his chest and laughed. &quot;Get up.&quot; I did as I was told. Jin bent to the ground and placed his hand on it palm up. &quot;Get on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Confused I did. The he lifted me upwards, his other hand supporting my side a touch so I didn't fall. Without any effort I was now stooping against the ceiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow...&quot; I looked down, for the first time ever I imagined, on Jin who was grinning from ear to ear.<br />
<br />
&quot;And that's not all.&quot; Jin laughed and he lowered me back down.<br />
<br />
&quot;There's more?&quot; I asked winking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Watch.&quot; Kicking off his shoes and socks he stripped off his shirt and shucked off his jeans, leaving him in some colourful tight silk boxers. They were very tight, a python curled in them, the head peeking on slightly out the bottom. He rubbed the front slightly and then stopped looking at. &quot;I think you should strip for me. Get me going.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I don't know I said playfully.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wasn't asking boy.&quot; Jin said his hands on his hips, attempting to look stern but coming across cheeky.<br />
<br />
I lifted my tee slowly. My small but visible abs being revealed two by two. My defined but tiny chest appeared next.<br />
<br />
I saw Jin's penis respond to this. It began to shift under the fabric. The fabric trying it's best to contain it.<br />
<br />
&quot;More.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes sir.&quot; I then undid my jean buttons and slowly lowered them, my lack of underwear made the show a little shorter than expected as my hard 5 incher sprang up and hit my stomach.<br />
<br />
Just then I heard a rip and saw the cock of my dreams spring forward tearing his underwear in half. it fluttered to the ground.<br />
<br />
12 thick asian inches now faced me. When he stepped forward it was a couple of inches from my chin!<br />
<br />
&quot;See. I've been through so many clothes. I have to control myself, all Asian men do, else the muscles supporting our cocks... like this one...&quot; He hefted it. &quot;You see how big it is?&quot; I nodded mesmerised. &quot;the muscles supporting this are so strong they tear through clothes when we're aroused. And they can support a lot of weight on their own. Easily you tiny.&quot;<br />
<br />
The word tiny sent a shiver down my spine. &quot;Want to climb on?&quot; He shook that huge cock at me. It glistened with a lot of precum. It looked so big and hard. I licked my lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...&quot; And before I could say more Jin picked me up and placed my on top of his cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ready? I'm real big and this could hurt a little. Unless what they say bout Black guys is true.&quot; I smiled at him and pushed down. My hole opened effortlessly and engulfed his cock in one go.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's true.&quot; I giggled as I watched him throw his head back in pleasure. I saw his muscles tense as one at the sensation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck that's amazing!&quot; Jin bellowed as he started to pump in and out of me, holding me steady with his arms without even thinking about it.<br />
<br />
We kissed savagely as he fucked me. His huge cock moving in and out of me, lubed up by his precum it was sliding more than moving. I felt it move inside me, the sensation better than pleasuring myself wanking. My cock was rock hard, poking a little at those abs, each as big as my palm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jin... ah fuck... you're so... you're a god!&quot; I screamed as we both came, my seed hitting his abs, maybe a teaspoon or so. His seed almost filling me! It leaked out of my ass and down his cock, and then down one of his hairy, muscled thighs.<br />
<br />
Jin spent a full minute grunting, his orgasm lasting alomst 10 times longer than mine! His balls felt massive as he moved, they kept hitting my ass as he moved forward. He slowly lifted me off his cock and kissed me again before placing me back down on the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Little man, that was amazing. Guess I popped my cherry tonight after all, Sooki said I didn't stand a chance with you, you're like model good looking.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cherry?!&quot; I stood looking up open mouthed &quot;That was you're first time? But that was mind blowing Jin!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jin nodded adn with a shy laugh added, &quot;Yeah, I know.&quot; His confidence and modesty blended into something quite adorable<br />
<br />
&quot;By the way are you single?&quot; Jin looked down and waited for my reply.</p>
