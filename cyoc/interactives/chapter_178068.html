<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Zach grinned as he thought of all the different possibilities he could do with a slave roommate. “This was going to be great”, he thought. He had always hated Tyler for being such a whiny loser. Zach felt it was time to put him in his place and properly humiliate him. <br />
 <br />
Tyler stared at his muscle bound roommate still, still covered in sweat and still wearing his work out gear. Tyler wanted to run away, get away from Zach before he was forced to do something terrible. Alas, something had gone wrong with the chronivac, leaving him a slave and totally at Zach’s mercy!<br />
 <br />
“Okay Tyler. Come over here” Zach commanded with a grin. “Yes, Master”. Tyler’s legs carried him over to Zach against his will. He stopped one foot away from Zach. His nose crinkled as he could smell the thick body odor coming off of Zach. Zach saw Tyler grimace from the smell and he got an idea. Zach lifted up his thick arm, showing off his hairy armpit, and he took a deep sniff of the pit bush. “Damn, I guess I smell pretty bad. That was a pretty intense workout. What do you think, Tyler? Do you like how I smell? You can be honest?”.<br />
 <br />
Tyler was compelled to answer almost automatically; “No, I think you smell awful. You always smell like sweat and BO and I hate it. You smell particularly bad right now, though”, Tyler blurted out. He was afraid that Zach would get angry and punish him, but that was the truth and he was compelled to answer truthfully. <br />
 <br />
Zach grinned mischievously; “Oh, well, thats too bad Tyler, since your my slave, I think your just going to have to get used to it. Come over here and take my tank top off”. Tyler walked over and Zach raised his arms, exposing both armpits. Tyler saw the thick brown bushes and, being this close, the BO intensified. Tyler was seriously grossed out. Tyler grabbed the sweaty off-white tank top and pulled it up over Zach’s head, taking it off. With the tank top off, Zach’s muscular, thick torso was on display. His chest was covered in thick brown chest hair, which was matted down by sweat. The chest hair continued down in an unbroken line and spread out all over his 6 pack of abs. The hair continued down past the waistband, where a thick and prominent bulge stood out. <br />
 <br />
“Good, slave”, Zach said. He lifted one of his arms and put his hand behind his head. “Now, slave. I want you to sniff my armpit”. <br />
<br />
Every fiber of Tyler&#39;s being was screaming at him to run away, to not comply, but his body moved forward against his will. His head was inches away from the messy hair brown bush under Zach&#39;s arm. Tyler took a small sniff and his stomach flipped; it smelled so bad it was nauseating. His roommate was so musky from the gym and he just stunk. Tyler was mortified; he was being forced to smell his roommates sweaty pit. This was so degrading and humiliating; this Chronivac had really fucked him up, he had to find a way to change this!<br />
<br />
Tyler gagged a bit as Zach just laughed; &quot;Oh wow, you&#39;re eager to sniff these pits. Tell me slave, do you like the smell? Do you like my pits?&quot;. Tyler was compelled to answer, although the thick hair under his roommates arm muffled his voice a bit. &quot;Ugh no, this is awful Zach, stop!&quot;. <br />
<br />
Zach grinned maliciously as he said his next command. &quot;Slave, you love my armpits and it turns you on&quot;. Just then, like a switch flipped in his brain, Tyler found he was uncontrollably attracted to Zach&#39;s pits. He was entranced and having his face shoved in them was heavenly. Tyler moaned and shoved his face further in and sniffed harder. His cock almost instantly shot from soft to rock hard in his pants. Tyler knew this was wrong, but his roommate&#39;s pits had planted itself in his brain and he couldn&#39;t think of anything else. This Chronivac was evil, he thought! He wanted to run away or scream but he couldn&#39;t do anything but huff his roommates pit stench. He wanted to scream but he couldn&#39;t, plus he was unbelievably turned on now. His cock was so painfully erect in his pants that it was unbearable. He couldn&#39;t resist. Zach saw his roommate struggling and the inner turmoil he was going through, Even though Tyler&#39;s face was pressed into the hairy bush. Zach just chuckled as he thought about the next command he would make, his large hand crawling under the waistband of his shorts and gripping his slowly hardening cock....</p>
