<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Somehow the day just seemed to drag on more than usual. Maybe it was just because Troy was at home, but he felt like there wasn&#39;t anything to do at all. Most days at work, he&#39;d spend a decent chunk of time on his phone as his computer had a keylogger and could check what websites he was visiting. But now that he was at home, he was able to clean up the house, do some laundry, have the TV on in the background and even take Rosco for a walk. More surprising was just as much, if not more of his work had been done throughout the day. Yet, he couldn&#39;t help but feel a bit unaccomplished.<br />
<br />
It was just nice when 4:30 rolled around and he was finally able to log off. Somehow the stress hadn&#39;t disappeared as he stepped away from his computer and moved around the house. It suddenly felt a little bit more confining. Like he just needed to get out of there. Or have someone over. Looking down at the book, he knew exactly who he wanted that to be. &quot;Is it too soon?&quot; Troy wondered. He&#39;d always heard about all these unwritten rules that a person was supposed to follow if you were to start dating someone. But would they also apply to summoning?<br />
<br />
&quot;If I&#39;m bothering him; I can just unsummon him,&quot; Troy said as he held the book and said, &quot;Monster.&quot; He tried to specifically think of Lancer, hoping that would be the Leonin he would summon. And to his excitement, the handsome lionman clad in armor stood there. &quot;SWEET!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Greetings master,&quot; Lancer said, adding a bit of a bow. Troy let out a bit of a huff. &quot;I mean Troy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, you do remember me,&quot; Troy beamed at the correction. <br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Lancer&#39;s eyes drifted off as one of his claws scratched at his whiskers. Even as he tried to remain stoic, the faintest of smiles appeared on his face. &quot;How could I forget?&quot; Though he was quick to change the subject. &quot;Why have you summoned me this time?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kind of the same reason. Just testing out the book a bit more. Trying to really get a feel for it. It&#39;s kind of surprising how the more I use it, the easier all the spells are getting. Even today, I was able to change dozens of people and not feel much at all but when I started it was like I could only use a couple of spells at a time before passing out,&quot; Troy explained. &quot;But why did you leave last time?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your power faded and I appeared back in my own dimension,&quot; Lancer answered. &quot;After you fell asleep, I could feel the magic holding me here drain and then vanish. Then you were no longer in my grasp.&quot; He looked down at his fingers and then closed them a couple of times as though he were still trying to hold on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm...&quot; Troy started pacing. &quot;So, when I fall asleep there&#39;s a limit to how long you can stay. But then why does Rosco stay?&quot; The dog&#39;s ears perked up at his name. &quot;Is it because you still exist in this dimension?&quot; Of course the German Shepard didn&#39;t know what Troy was saying, but happily wagged his tail as he received the attention. <br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps. That does sound logical,&quot; Lancer said. &quot;But I was surprised that when I returned to my world, it was as though not a second had moved. It didn&#39;t matter that I was here for a few hours, I still felt the same as I had when I had left.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really...&quot; Troy started pacing around his living room a bit. &quot;So that means when you&#39;re plucked out of your reality, your reality stays completely stagnant. But you still have experiences outside of it. Making different versions of you. So would that mean I could pull a character out of a story from different times and then they&#39;ll be changed? So weird...&quot;<br />
<br />
Lancer stood awkwardly in the corner of the room, watching the small human pace around. &quot;Sir?&quot; he cleared his throat and adjusted his armor. &quot;Is that all you summoned me for?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm?&quot; Troy stopped in his tracks. &quot;Oh! I also wanted to know if you wanted to play a game with some of my friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A game?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, a game. It&#39;s a role playing one where you pick a class like fighter, druid, barbarian, etc and a race and then you have some dice and go through like dungeons and stuff that one of the guys has made up,&quot; Troy explained. &quot;You&#39;re actually one of the races in it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lancer nodded along. &quot;So... I could be a Leonin Paladin?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I guess so,&quot; Troy answered. &quot;You could be something else too...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about a human wizard?&quot; Lancer asked. He was getting a bit more into it. A clear grin had appeared on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t see why not.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lancer let out a chuckle of excitement. &quot;OK! I&#39;d love to play this game!&quot; he roared with excitement. &quot;When do we start?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... Uhh...&quot; Troy thought about it. &quot;I don&#39;t know. We haven&#39;t set a date yet...&quot;<br />
<br />
Clear disappointment fill Lancer&#39;s face as he heard the answer. &quot;Oh...&quot; was all he could utter as he went back to his more solemn position. He adjusted his armor again. &quot;Okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now it was Troy&#39;s turn to let out a bit of a chuckle. It was obvious what Lancer was thinking about. &quot;Did you want to try being a human? I think I could do that for you...&quot; He let out a coy smile as he saw Lancer try not to look too interested. <br />
<br />
&quot;I couldn&#39;t possibly ask you to do that for me mas--&quot; Lancer cut himself off from saying &#39;master&#39; and simply ended with the sentence with &quot;Troy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh? Really?&quot; Troy taunted. He paced around again, almost in a mocking march as he watched the restrained excitement from the possibility in Lancer&#39;s eyes. &quot;You don&#39;t want to have ears on the side of your head? Or nails that fit comfortably on top of your fingers? Or a mostly hairless body? Or not have a tail that you could sit on?&quot; Troy asked. He was thinking about all the things he desired out of the anthro characters and figured it must have been somewhat similar for Lancer. And with each question he could see Lancer&#39;s eyes glowing with excitement. A smile cut through his false attempt at apathy. &quot;Maybe you don&#39;t want to have a flat face or teeth used for both meat and vegetables? Hmmm?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OK! I want it! I do!&quot; Lancer practically fell to his knees. &quot;But how could I possibly ask that of you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Troy dismissed it, adding a &#39;TCH&#39; sound at how silly the big lion man was being. &quot;Could you turn me into a human?&quot; he said. &quot;That&#39;s all you have to say.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Could you--&quot; Lancer looked like he was struggling with the request, &quot;Could you please turn me into a human?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing,&quot; Troy said. &quot;Shape,&quot; he looked over the massive lionman, nothing. &quot;Hmm? Shape,&quot; Troy repeated. Still nothing. Even Lancer looked down at himself now, then back to Troy. Concern growing as he&#39;d just been humiliated. &quot;Shift?&quot; Instantly the dark claws that pointed out from his fingers started to retract. No longer the black sharp claws as they softened and molded against his skin, turning a more pinkish color. The tough tawny fur that covered his hands started to retreat back into his body. Rapidly disappearing up his arms and down his legs.<br />
<br />
Lancer stood back up. Excitement in his eyes as he spun around. The tail that followed quickly pulled back up into his body and the muzzle on his face started to shrink back into his skull. His pinkish nose started to turn to the color of his skin and point downwards while his moth turned more into a slit across just the front of his face. It instantly beamed into a massive smile as Lancer felt his paws turn into human feet. He let out a bit of an &#39;EEP!&#39; as the armor around his legs no longer fit him right as he&#39;d shrunk a couple of inches. However, his crotch had not gone any further down and his feet had only raised up into the armor. <br />
<br />
Without the pressure of his feet on the ground, his body started to sway around. Then toppled over right onto the coffee table. &quot;By the gods!&quot; Lancer proclaimed. His voice seemed to have raised quite a bit, but that was more due to the uncomfortable pressure on his nuts in the armor than anything else. Troy went to help him out of it. &quot;Thank you...&quot; Lancer huffed over and over again. It took him a bit to actually catch his breath, but Troy wasn&#39;t complaining. Seeing the well worn fabric that was tucked under the armor brace perfectly around Lancer&#39;s muscular body was just as good of a view as any. If he couldn&#39;t have a massive sexy lion man, a massive sexy bodybuilder looking human with a perfectly cut brown beard and trimmed hair was just as good. <br />
<br />
After the pain had subsided enough, Lancer finally stood up. He caught his reflection in the TV. &quot;By the gods,&quot; the smile on his face only grew as he gently caressed his human face. &quot;BY THE GODS!&quot; he roared, picking Troy up into the biggest of hugs, lifting the small man off the ground and swinging him around. &quot;You did it! You really did it!&quot; he beamed. <br />
<br />
Rosco started barking and nipping at him, causing Lancer to calm down a bit. &quot;Thank you,&quot; he repeated. Their faces hung mere inches apart for a few moments before Lancer broke the distance. Troy was more than happy to oblige, opening his mouth and accepting the tongue. Lancer must have been a fast learner as he adapted to his new tongue perfectly. He instantly knew how to wrestle inside of Troy&#39;s mouth. All while carrying the much smaller man over to the couch and landing gently on top of him. <br />
<br />
The kiss continued. Troy&#39;s hands eagerly explored every inch of Lancer&#39;s as Lancer did the same to him. However, Troy was surprised when the kiss stopped. He naturally leaned in again, only to have Lancer pull away. &quot;Top or bottom?&quot; Lancer asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; was all Troy could get out before he felt his shorts ripped from his body. His hard cock swung around a bit. &quot;WHAT!?&quot; Troy tried to push away for a second but was held in place by Lancer&#39;s strong hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;You took too long,&quot; Lancer mocked, repeating what Troy had said to him earlier. His mouth opened wide as he slid the cock inside his mouth. His eyes rolled back as he licked the tip and slid more of it down into him. Troy did the same, hips bucking slightly as he gripped whatever part of his couch he possibly could. The feeling was mutual as Lancer continued to suck on Troy&#39;s cock. He seemed to be an almost master of it. Knowing where to lick and where to slide his tongue. His hands gently cupped Troy&#39;s balls and tickled his underside.<br />
<br />
Troy could barely hold on. Somehow all this was even better than he&#39;d ever hoped. The slight taunting along with the worshipping was more than he could do. He felt his hips buck again. This time releasing into Lancer&#39;s mouth. The other man greedily accepted what he was given, taking it all without a drop falling out of his mouth. A smile seemed plastered onto his face as he pulled off Troy&#39;s dick. &quot;Good?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Go-ood,&quot; Troy huffed. &quot;Now you?&quot; he asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nah,&quot; Lancer laughed. &quot;I&#39;m good...&quot; He stood up and dropped his own underwear. His cock had already gone soft, but the clear mess in the hide was still very visible. Far larger than any human would normally be able to make. Though, it looked as though his balls were still the size of a lion&#39;s. Troy nervously smiled. Especially when Lancer asked, &quot;Now what?&quot;</p>
