<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tess sat in the chair closest to Eric so she could keep an eye on him while Michael took the one at the foot of the bed. She knew if they were going to talk they should do it in another room so as not to disturb Eric, as it would likely end in bickering as it always did between them, but she couldn&#39;t let him out of her sight right now.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think if you shared in it, something would have happened by now.&quot; Michael was saying. He sat with that tail curled into his lap and was staring at a bunch of roses that was sitting on a table nearby. Clyde did not seem like the giving flowers type.<br />
<br />
&quot;Or maybe I just like who I am.&quot; She retorted with a look over to her ex-husband.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s that supposed to mean?&quot; Michael&#39;s voice didn&#39;t raise in volume, but some heat entered it. When had they become so hostile towards each other. She vaguely remembered actually loving him at one point, but there had always been something between them, a block they just couldn&#39;t get past.<br />
<br />
&quot;Michael, I&#39;ve known you a long time. There&#39;s one thing you share with Eric. Neither of you were ever particularly happy with yourselves. I did my best to give him self-confidence, but..&quot; She reached out to stroke the fur on his head. &quot;I was hoping he&#39;d learn some in college. You..&quot; She looked over at Michael. &quot;That&#39;s always been the problem with us. There&#39;s something about you that you don&#39;t like, or can&#39;t admit, or something. It kept us from ever really being together. I don&#39;t begrudge you leaving, I resent you for pushing your sons away.&quot;<br />
<br />
Michael opened his mouth to respond then shut it and nodded. &quot;As always, you&#39;re right.&quot; It was bitter, but sincere. &quot;And I think I&#39;m seeing it for the first time. How does Tom work into this little theory of yours though?&quot; That was a genuinely interested sounding tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you know Tom. He&#39;s always chasing something. That boy was born to dive into new experiences head first. Lars is going to have his hands full with that one. I always accepted that Tom was going to run off to be himself. Eric though..&quot; She turned to look at their youngest.<br />
<br />
&quot;You cold always stay.&quot; Michael said and she whipped her head towards him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was just saying I like myself, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d want to be anything other than human.&quot; Her tone was rising, and Michael held up a soothing hand to calm her down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Otso is their only doctor and with the resort now open, I&#39;m sure they could used a qualified RN. A human nurse would make the guests feel more comfortable. Just add it to your bargaining. And you&#39;ve always said you&#39;d prefer to work in a clinic instead of the hospital.&quot; He settled a little in his chair. &quot;And from what I&#39;ve seen, most of the,&quot; he stalled thinking of a good word and settled on, &quot;people around here can make themselves look human. Maybe you can still finally find someone, even if they aren&#39;t human all the time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Michael was looking at those roses again, a pensive look on his face. &quot;Besides, there&#39;s a precedent for a human living up here. They live in that big house over there.&quot; He gestured off in the direction of the workshop that could actually be seen from the bedroom window. &quot;One of them is big, fat, goes ho ho ho a lot.&quot; Tess shot him a withering look.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, he&#39;s not that fat, puffy coat.&quot; Came a groggy voice that was familiar if quite a bit deeper than he remembered it being. &quot;Thirsty.&quot; He muttered.<br />
<br />
-----------------------<br />
<br />
Tess needed Michael&#39;s help to sit Eric up in the bed. He was not used to his youngest son being bigger than him. She poured him a glass of water from the nightstand as Michael went to brew a cup of herbal tea the doc had left behind for him. When he came back into the room the two were having a soft conversation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here.&quot; He said, holding out the mug to Eric. &quot;Otso says to drink this tea twice a day, has some good healing herbs in it, added some peppermint and reindeer moss to cover the taste. I found some honey for it, too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric took it with a grateful smile. &quot;Thanks, Michael.&quot; He took a sip and nodded softly.<br />
<br />
Still Michael and not dad, then. At least Eric didn&#39;t sound sarcastically bitter using his name like he usually did. &quot;Clara sent over some carrot and apple soup. I&#39;ll heat some up for you if you&#39;re hungry.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric shook his head. &quot;Not sure it&#39;d stay down at the moment.&quot; He was looking between them as if noticing for the first time both of them were there in the room, which he took in. &quot;Where are we?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bix&#39;s.&quot; Tess answered softly. &quot;It&#39;s a better place for you to get back on your feet than Clyde&#39;s.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hooves.&quot; Eric corrected, lifting one and giving it a little wiggle, grinning as if trying to make a joke. Tess&#39; expression just soured a little. &quot;Well, I guess it&#39;s out in the open now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But why?&quot; Tess asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I crashed.&quot; Eric quipped again, obviously feeling in better humor. It was strange to see from Eric who he had always thought of as a shy and reserved, quiet, lonely. He had broken that shell. If anything convinced Michael this was where he belonged it was that. A sharp look from Tess had him taking a sip of tea before going on. &quot;Because I belong here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What does that even mean? Is it Clyde? You&#39;ve only known each other a few weeks. It&#39;s a pretty drastic decision for a crush.&quot; Michael, reached out and put a hand on Tess&#39; shoulder, shaking his head, warning her not to go there. Eric noticed though and shot him a grateful look. Grateful! Two unexpected emotions in his direction in less than five minutes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Clyde is a big part of it.&quot; Eric admitted. &quot;But so is flying. I&#39;m good at it, mom. Really good. I&#39;ve never been good at anything in my life.&quot; Tess shot him a reproving look but he kept going. &quot;No, really, you know it, I know it. But after a couple of weeks I was good enough to outfly most of the others. I&#39;m on the best team they have. And the feeling of it, it&#39;s.. I can&#39;t give it up.&quot;<br />
<br />
He lowered the mug and peered into it. &quot;And Clyde, he loves me for who I am. I&#39;m not a nerdy weirdo up here, the others just accept me. I have friends here, too. I don&#39;t feel like an outcast up here, I just feel like myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s just so hasty..&quot; Tess began, but Michael stepped in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tess. He&#39;s a grown man. He can make his own choices now. If this is what he wants, we need to respect that and support him. I know he&#39;ll always be your little boy, but you can&#39;t hold on forever.&quot; He meant the words to be soothing, but she rounded on him.<br />
<br />
&quot;You let go years ago.&quot; Michael stiffened as if slapped, but he didn&#39;t argue the point.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom.&quot; Eric said soothingly, &quot;Please. Not right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Any further arguing was cut off by a knock on the doorframe. Somehow Bix had approached without any of them noticing. &quot;Do you two mind if I have a moment with my poika?&quot; He asked with his usual brusque manner, it was also a subtle reminder he had a claim on the young man.. buck, too.<br />
<br />
Michael nodded and stood up, &quot;I&#39;ll be in the next room if you need me.&quot; Tess was a little more stiff in her compliance and stalked out of the room like an angry cat. No cats up here that he had seen, yet. But she&#39;d qualify sometimes. She was grabbing her jacket as if intending to take a walk while he just sat down on the sofa.<br />
<br />
Before the door to the bedroom closed he heard Eric&#39;s voice, &quot;Was that a tail?&quot;</p>
