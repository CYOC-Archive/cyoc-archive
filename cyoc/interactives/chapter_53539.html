<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jason Rutledge opened the door to Greg Mason's room as he had been looking for his tube of role-playing dice.  He stood only five foot five which made him the tallest person in the room by this time.  Glancing around at all those currently involved in the Game of Change, he blinked.  It was one of the strangest things he had ever seen in his life.  Well, honestly, it was probably *the* strangest, all things considered.<br />
<br />
Jason had a brain for numbers, and when he looked down at the multi-colored game board on the floor between each of them, he saw that there were sixty-four squares on the board with two large circles at the very beginning and very end.  He noted the solid wood design of the rectangle was sturdy and something he'd only seen in the deeper role-plays he'd ever been a part of.  The question at this moment, though, was was this strange group doing sitting around the board in Mike's room with everyone looking up at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh… uh… Keep the door open!&quot; Kristi moaned out between moments of her efforts up within herself.  &quot;It said we can't leave… the door wouldn't open, but there it is!&quot; she called out in a squeal as Jason put his hand to the side and kept Mike's door from shutting normally from its own weight.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kristi, what are you doing to yourself?&quot; Jason asked, realizing she was the only person he could actually tell who they were of the group.  &quot;And what game are you playing?  A woman masturbating in front of a child, a baby, a dog, a–um–fairy, and a part… cow… woman… is hardly normal behavior,&quot; he frowned.<br />
<br />
Jason had black hair and tan skin, and crossed his arms as he looked forward into the room.  He kept his foot out to keep the door open, just in case, as he watched everyone at the room still staring at him.  Mike, the baby, started to cry.  Jim, the bitch, stopped licking herself clean and looked up at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's the game,&quot; she said as Donna flew down to the game's cover and slowly began to push it across the room to Jason's feet.  He blinked at the fairy finished getting the board to him.  As she did so, she flew back across the room to the little baby that was crying.  The fairy did her best to try and calm Mike down, but it wasn't working too well.<br />
<br />
Jason reached down and picked up the top to the game and looked over the rules.  &quot;As many players as a single group can stand.  The main trouble comes not from the game itself, but from the devotion to finish it.  With each roll of the dice, the game nears a close… but with each roll also come transformations,&quot; he said, looking up and around the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Each person may roll one or two dice,&quot; he noted.  &quot;One dice often leads to smaller, more manageable transformations.  Change of hair, change of body, change of eye color, change of sex or even of sexual preference,&quot; he rose an eyebrow at that, wondering how a game could chance someone's sexual preference.<br />
<br />
&quot;When rolling two dice, you'll move across the board quicker but at greater transformational risk.  You may loose the ability to speak or move all of your body, but you will never be stopped from finishing the game because of your transformation,&quot; he said, taking note of Jim cleaning herself again… but Jim's mind was still inside there by these rules.  Sometimes he wondered what that boy thought about.<br />
<br />
&quot;Additionally, with doubles you receive a secondary transformation that is overall beneficial or moves you more back to your form from when you started the game.  This does not include snake eyes (double ones) which will be a grand inconvenient transformation or double sixes which is greatly convenient,&quot; he tilted his head.  &quot;All doubles let you roll again, another benefit beyond rolling a single die.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm summarizing,&quot; he offered to the group as he looked the board over.  &quot;I take it no one read the rules before starting?  You guys,&quot; he sighed.  &quot;White or Clear squares are random transformations… the first twelve squares on the board alternate white and clear to make sure everyone starts transformed in some way,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Black squares are inanimate transformations and cause a player to loose one to six turns based on an additional roll of a single dice,&quot; Jason said, thinking that wasn't a very happy thought.  &quot;Skipped turns require no rolls, so even if all are made still, the turns still pass.  Oh… well, that's good,&quot; he commented to himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Blue squares are always simple transformations, regardless.  Hair, Eye, and Skin Color… Muscle Mass, Gender, etc,&quot; he said.  &quot;Red is always species.  Yellow is always gender.  Green is size,&quot; he added.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are the multi-color ones for?&quot; the little mostly naked three year old that was Greg asked.  Jason looked up at him, and recognized the shirt Greg was wearing.  He sighed and shook his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;They change your surroundings… the setting of the game itself,&quot; he explained.  &quot;That's a little unclear… but if I read the 'End of Game' correctly, the game always reverts the final scene into something quote 'reasonable'.  Your house may reform, or a transformed house may seem to have always been that way to the neighbors.  Things like that,&quot; he explained.  &quot;The game ends when at least one person reaches the circle at the end of the game board,&quot; he said, looking down to note the twelve squares of the board were also alternating clear and white.  &quot;Anyone in the last twelve squares can choose to keep their current form or revert back to the one they started the game with–&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Started the Game with?&quot; the little fairy Donna asked.  &quot;Like if we play the Game more than once, but the first time had changed us?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds right,&quot; Jason said, then continued, &quot;The person who actually wins, though, gets to make a single transformational wish.  That's cool.  It might be to override everyone's choice and make them all revert or keep their forms… or it might be just to make that person into whatever they want.  Whatever the case, it is only a transformation that is to be directed at the winner himself, or everyone who played the game… no picking and choosing,&quot; he shook his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Also, Kristi,&quot; Jason said, removing his foot and stepping into the room so the door would close.  &quot;The rules say 'no players should leave until someone completes the game', which is in reference to the fact everyone who starts the game must end it… and I bet it has to do with some of you looking like freaks,&quot; he said, motioning to Leslie.  &quot;Doesn't say what would happen if someone died, but I'm betting that everyone just gets stuck as is… or maybe that person transforms into a ghost,&quot; he said rubbing his chin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude… rules are boring… that's why we didn't read them,&quot; the young boy that was Greg said, wanting to get back to the adventure.  &quot;We've all only had one turn.  You could still join us if you want,&quot; he said.</p>
