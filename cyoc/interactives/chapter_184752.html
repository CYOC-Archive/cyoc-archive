<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The school day was coming to an end but Erin had the last period off as did Rico. Erin went searching for him and found him walking down the main hall.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Erin, ever able to figure out what was going on today?&quot; Rico asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; said Erin, &quot;but I did have some fun with the app today messing with some other people.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like what?&quot; inquired Rico. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh like changing that dickhead Adam, making the study hall DnD group into their characters, stuff like that.&quot; Answered Erin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I see everything you did?&quot; Rico said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah but lets go somewhere where we don&#39;t run the risk of causing massive changes on accident. How about my place?&quot; Erin replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok!&quot; Rico said, smiling.<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Erin and Rico arrived to her house and went up to her room. Erin&#39;s parents were out of town for the week so they wouldn&#39;t have to worry about anyone interrupting. &quot;Ok, lets see everything you changed throughout the day.&quot; Rico said. Erin handed Rico the phone with the app open. Rico smiled deviously as he grabbed the phone. &#39;Good, she never noticed.&quot; Rico thought to himself. Earlier when they were talking in the hall after the assembly, Rico pulled up the sentence &quot;Rico is talking to his friend Erin&quot; to &quot;Rico is talking to his girlfriend Erin.&quot; And now that Rico saw how well the app worked began to change Erin and himself better to his liking.<br />
<br />
He generated a sentence as he looked at Erin: The 16-year-olds are currently sitting in a room alone together. He changed it to: The 22-year-olds are currently sitting in a room alone together.<br />
<br />
Rico looked back up and Erin was clearly older. Her body slightly more developed. New memories bloomed in both of there heads of finishing high school, going to college together and their relationship. They were currently sitting in the bedroom of their recently purchased home. Rico had just been hired to a very prestigious engineering firm and Erin was working as a secretary for a wealthy Wall Street Broker.<br />
<br />
Rico smiled as it was clear Erin was completely oblivious to the change. He generated a few more sentences as he looked at her body. Her nice B cups enlarged to perky and round DD cups. Her ass inflated and changed to be heart shaped and clearly lifted herself off the bed. Everything about her became sexier to Rico. Her long, lush blonde hair matched her face perfectly. Rico was getting a hard-on just looking at her.<br />
<br />
Speaking of himself Rico decided to give himself a makeover as well. He generated more sentences about himself: &quot;Rico is looking at his average body&quot; to &quot;Rico is looking at his muscular body&quot;. &quot;Rico is thinking about his 5 inch cock&quot; to &quot;Rico is thinking about his 10 inch cock&quot;. <br />
<br />
After some more minor changes about himself and Erin, including her not having any indications she could have been a guy at one point, he had two other things to do. He generated another sentence: &quot;Erin does know about the magic App&quot; to &quot;Erin doesn&#39;t know about magic App&quot; and &quot;Rico is holding Erin&#39;s phone with the app installed&quot; to Rico is holding his phone with the app installed&quot;. Erin no longer had nor would ever know about the magic app.<br />
<br />
Rico looked up to his bombshell girlfriend Erin who was smiling at him. &quot;What are you thinking about?&quot; asked Rico. &quot;Oh nothing just excited to be living together finally!&quot; exclaimed Erin. Erin had no recollection about anything that Rico had done to her, only that she was his girlfriend and was in love with him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...how about we celebrate our next chapter together?&quot; Asked Rico.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure! Where do you want to go for dinner?&quot; Asked Erin.<br />
<br />
Rico pulled out his phone again and generated a new sentence: &quot;Erin is excited to have dinner with Rico tonight&quot; to &quot;Erin is excited to have sex with Rico tonight.&quot; Rico looked up and saw Erin now laying seductively on the bed. &quot;There&#39;s some condoms in the night stand baby...&quot; Rico quickly generated and changed another sentence. &quot;...unless you want to be risky tonight.&quot; Erin cooed.<br />
<br />
Rico quickly jumped into bed with Erin and began to kiss her intensely. He caressed her massive breasts with his hands, squeezing them tightly causing Erin to moan. This continued on for several minutes. Erin&#39;s dress and skirt, along with Rico&#39;s shirt and Jeans were now on the floor. Erin pushed Rico off for a moment and stood up showing her ass to Rico as she unclasped her bra. It fell to the floor and she kicked off her panties, giving quite the show for Rico who&#39;s cock was now at full mass. She slowly walked over to him and pulled his underwear, allowing his fully erect dick to pop out.<br />
<br />
Erin licked her lips greedily and slowly wrapped her lips around it and began sucking. Rico moaned in pleasure as he grabbed her breasts and squeezed them eliciting more excited moans from Erin as she sucked his massive cock. This continued on for several minutes before Rico was at his peak. &quot;Erin...I&#39;m about to cum...&quot; Rico groaned out which only caused Erin to suck harder and faster. It was too much for him and he released his load down Erin&#39;s throat. After many pulses, Erin finally came up having swallowed almost every drop except for some which she wiped off her mouth and licked.<br />
<br />
&quot;mmhhhmm...tasty&quot; Erin said seductively. &quot;Are you ready for the main event?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rico&#39;s dick was still incredibly hard and erect so he just nodded in agreement. Erin began to straddle his waist, lining up her pussy with his cock. Slowly she descended on his male pole, moaning as she buried herself deeper and deeper onto him. Slowly she bounced up and down on his dick causing her breasts to bounce as well. Something Rico thoroughly enjoyed watching as he held her waist. Erin was already nearing orgasm which Rico brought on sooner by rubbing her clit and ass at the same time. &quot;AAAAAAHHHHHHHH! I&#39;M CUMMING!&quot; Erin screamed out in pleasure as an orgasm rocked her body. <br />
<br />
Rico taking advantage of the situation switched positions with him now in control, thrusting in and out hard. Erin was completely lost in pleasure as he restarted his assault on her breasts and was kissing her neck. He flicked her erect nipples and began to suck on her other tit. Erin couldn&#39;t think straight with this going on, all she wanted now was the please him and release his cum into her. This continued on for at least 30 minutes, Rico was finally nearing his orgasm and so was Erin again.<br />
<br />
Erin felt Rico&#39;s dick pulsing in her signaling that he was near orgasm as she could feel hers coming as well. Instinctively she wrapped her legs around him to keep him from pulling out. Rico took notice of this but didn&#39;t care as he had no intention to pullout from the start. Erin was conjuring visions of herself heavily pregnant while Rico fucked her, it was such a glorious vision that had the potential to become true soon. Rico was having similar visions and somehow made his dick even harder as he fucked Erin but he was slowly running out of steam. His dick throbbed harder and harder and holding back the flood gates became more and more impossible to hold back.<br />
<br />
Suddenly Erin reached her climax. She screamed out in a massive explosion of pleasure as she squirted and clamped down on Rico&#39;s dick causing him to give in. He buried himself deep into her womb as he shot out load after load of cum into her tight, wet pussy. Erin pulled Rico into a deep kiss as they road out their orgasms. Erin could feel the warm cum build in her womb as her stomach inflated slightly from the sheer volume of cum. After his last pulse, Rico finally pulled out, shooting a little bit of cum onto Erin&#39;s stomach and laid down next to her.<br />
<br />
After 15 minutes, both were still trying to catch their breaths as they laid in bed looking into each others eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow...you were amazing...&quot; Erin said finally breaking the heavy breathing. &quot;You were too...,&quot; Rico answered back, &quot;I want to do this more.&quot;<br />
<br />
Erin smiled, &quot;Don&#39;t worry, this definitely won&#39;t be the last time...&quot; Erin then yawned. &quot;Lets get some sleep. Your first day is tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rico smiled and rubbed Erin&#39;s large breasts and began to spoon her while they drifted off to sleep. Rico couldn&#39;t have created a better future for himself.<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
A month later, everything had set into a pattern. Rico and Erin would go to work, which for Erin was easy as most of it was online, setting up appointments, document checking, etc. Most nights when Rico came home they would have long sessions of sex after dinner, sometimes skipping dinner entirely to get to &quot;dessert&quot;. In the last week however, Erin had been waking up sick which both made her happy and worried. She went to a convenience store to pick up a pregnancy test even though she already knew the answer.<br />
<br />
Rico came how at his usual time and Erin immediately went to kiss him causing Rico to become erect. After a long makeout session, Erin told Rico to close his eyes and hold out his hands. He did as told and after putting the test in his hands, Erin told him to look.<br />
<br />
It was a positive pregnancy test. Rico both in shock and excitement picked up Erin and started bringing her back to the bedroom. Rico was incredibly happy and took Erin for another ride. Hell, even looking at it he could see her stomach was slightly inflated as he fucked her. Life was about to get more interesting but thoughts about the App reentered his head before cumming inside Erin again.</p>
