<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mary saw a purple weasel running in her direction. Unfortunately, the weasel wasn't looking where he was going. He ran right into Mary, landing on top of her with a thud.<br />
<br />
His fur was soft and warm -- he was naked! A closer looked showed that he was wearing gloves and boots but that was all. <br />
<br />
If it weren't for Mary's confusion and her lack of knowledge about this creature, she might actually be a little excited.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, why don't you watch where you're going,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where I'm going? You're the one that ran into me fella!&quot; Mary said.<br />
<br />
The weasel stood and and dusted himself off.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not the one that just appeared out of thin air,&quot; The weasel said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aren't you gonna be a gentleman and help me up?&quot; Mary asked.<br />
<br />
The weasel folded his arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lady, do you have any idea who I am?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary stood up. She was almost eye level with the weasel. He had a long thick tail, a significant overbite on one of his canine teeth and a naughty expression. He was also armed with what appeared to be a pop gun.<br />
<br />
He was handsome, she had to give him that. Whether from running or from the warm sun, he was a little sweaty. Not that Mary minded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let's just say that I'm not from around here,&quot; Mary said.<br />
<br />
The weasel grinned. &quot;Like what you see?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary blushed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, I'd love to stay and chat but they're after me. So, if you'll excuse me, I have to go.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They? Who are you...&quot;<br />
<br />
The weasel took off before Mary could finish asking the question. Mary chased after him. She picked up speed at a remarkable rate to the point where she actually passed the weasel. A quick about face and she was running back toward him. They collided once more. This time Mary was on top. <br />
<br />
She had to admit that he was warm and looked strong. As strange as it sounded to her, Mary realized that he was sexy. If they were in a more intimate setting, she might be willing to ask what he could do.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell?&quot; The weasel asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You gonna explain who you're running from?&quot; Mary asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you crazy, they're gonna be here soon,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who?&quot; Mary asked.<br />
<br />
The ground shook. Mary watched small craters form all around them, the ground looking as it were collapsing from under. There were also sounds of aircraft approaching.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's going on?&quot; Mary asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get off of me and I'll tell you,&quot; the weasel said.<br />
<br />
Mary stepped off and helped the weasel up.<br />
<br />
Mary gulped. &quot;Look, I'm no fighter.&quot;<br />
<br />
The weasel laughed. &quot;Well duh, you're over 18. A freedom fighter over 18; that's funny.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary frowned and folded her arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kira would kick your ass from here to Vulcan if she heard you say that,&quot; Mary said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you talking about lady?&quot; The weasel asked.<br />
<br />
Mary looked back and forth. Whatever was after the weasel was surrounding them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Never mind. As I was saying before you interrupted me, I doubt that popgun is going to help against whatever the hell is about to attack us,&quot; Mary said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I won't need it,&quot; the weasel said.<br />
<br />
The shaking grew worse as a dozen spider like bots that were twice Mary and the weasel's size dug up through the ground while a dozen more helicopter shaped objects flew over them, blowing Mary's clothes. One that was larger shined a spotlight on the duo.<br />
<br />
Mary and the weasel were surrounded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Any ideas weasel boy?&quot; Mary asked. &quot;I didn't come here just to get killed by some bad guys. They *are* bad guys right? You're not in trouble with the law, are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cross my heart baby. And I do have a heart. I'm not a heartless monster,&quot; the weasel said, stamping his right foot.<br />
<br />
A voice came from the largest flying object. It demanded Mary and the weasel, (who Mary discovered from the voice had the name Fang, probably a nickname from his overbite) surrender.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you steal something?&quot; Mary asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just plans for world domination to give to the good guys,&quot; Fang said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, nothing too major then,&quot; Mary said, rolling her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm serious,&quot; Fang said. &quot;Look, I want to help. A bad guy taking over the world is very bad for business.&quot;<br />
<br />
One of the spider like bots charged at Mary. She gasped and tried to shield herself.<br />
<br />
Fang jumped at the robot and swung his right fist at it. After a few punches, it exploded in a shower of metal and fire, sending debris flying everywhere. Two more jumped at them. Fang reduced both to flaming ruins, one with his fists, the other with his feet.<br />
<br />
Mary gasped. &quot;Impressive.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Power gloves and boots,&quot; Fang said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh come on,&quot; Mary said, rolling her eyes.<br />
<br />
Two more spider bots jumped at Fang. Three of the flying robots joined them. <br />
<br />
Three spider bots dashed at Mary. <br />
<br />
Fang went in swinging, jumping and kicking.<br />
<br />
Mary didn't know what to do and before she knew it, she had two painful cuts on her chest and another on her right leg. <br />
<br />
She heard the sound of weapon's fire followed by Fang grunting. Mary cringed when she saw that Fang had a nasty scorch on his chest and a cut on his tail.<br />
<br />
The thought of harming such a handsome person bothered Mary. She knew not to judge someone on looks. Just because of a guy had beauty didn't mean he was a nice person. However, Mary was still flesh and blood and had the same urges she had as a human. She could only hope that Fang indeed was a nice person or could become one.<br />
<br />
A hard impact to her chest and the next thing she knew, Mary was lying on the ground with the spider bots standing over her.<br />
<br />
She looked up to see Fang destroying two of the spider bots attacking him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get off of me, I never did anything to you,&quot; Mary said. She looked up at Fang, who was struggling with the flying robots. &quot;Isn't this where someone comes to our rescue?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Doesn't work that way honey -- Mary,&quot; Fang said as he dodged a laser blast that sent dirt flying.<br />
<br />
Mary thought she was done for.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're obviously a speed type, use your abilities,&quot; Fang said.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I don't know how...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't think about it! It's like instinct; just do it!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary looked at the spider bot at her legs. She knew she could run fast and that the speed of an impact had an effect on the damage the impact did. Mary allowed instinct to take over. She kicked the bot repeatedly as fast as she could. Her legs turned into blurs as the robot crumbled before exploding.<br />
<br />
Leaping up, Mary felt one of the spider bots grab her shirt. She turned to hit it but felt the fabric of her shirt rip and slip off. Rather then complain over sudden partial nudity (after all, it seemed the boys could get away with it!), Mary ran at the robot and started punching it as fast as she could. The other spider bot jumped at Mary. A quick glance showed her what it was doing. Mary dodged to the side, grabbed one of the robot's legs and used it to pierce the other robot before jumping out of the way. <br />
<br />
The electrical shock destroyed the robot from behind and its subsequent explosion destroyed the one in front.<br />
<br />
&quot;There you go,&quot; Fang said, finishing off his spider bot pursuers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you okay?&quot; Mary asked.<br />
<br />
Fang had a bleeding cut on his chest and he was cringing.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll be fine,&quot; Fang said.<br />
<br />
&quot;There must be a stimpack around here someone,&quot; Mary said.<br />
<br />
&quot;A what?&quot; Fang asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, wrong game,&quot; Mary said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lady, what are you on and where can I can some?&quot; Fang asked.<br />
<br />
Mary was a bit sweaty and whether it be adrenaline or getting into it, she was feeling a little excited.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just letting my imagination run away with me baby,&quot; Mary said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is this where you suddenly figure out just how strong you are and save us both by taking down all of the enemies all by yourself?&quot; Fang asked.<br />
<br />
Mary winked at Fang as the ground exploded all around them under the fire of the flying robots.<br />
<br />
&quot;My last name isn't Sue.&quot;<br />
<br />
The flying robots attacked en mass. Mary ran toward the debris pile that was the attackers she dealt with. She grabbed a piece of debris and threw it and several others at one of the flying robots as fast as she could in an attempt to replicate a Gatling gun. The robot flew back from the impact and attempted to fire. It managed to destroy a few pieces of debris but Mary's assault eventually overpowered it. It exploded and crashed to the ground in a fireball, landing on the two of the remaining spider bots that were too close together, destroying both.<br />
<br />
The larger flying robot yelled at the remaining ones to stop Mary and Fang, saying the robots were incompetent.<br />
<br />
Fang managed to destroy the last two spider bots with his fists and boots. The flying robots however were a different matter.<br />
<br />
Mary threw some more debris at the other flying robots. While it did some damage to them, there was just too many. Desperate, Mary ran in front of the largest flying robot.<br />
<br />
&quot;You say they're incompetent? Bad troops equals bad leader,&quot; Mary said. &quot;What's the matter, are you afraid to take us on yourself? Or are you such a coward that you can only send others to their destruction?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mary, not now,&quot; Fang said.<br />
<br />
The large robot flew over to Mary.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you are?&quot; it asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Mary.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't recognize you,&quot; the robot said. &quot;Oh well, it won't matter in a few moments.&quot;<br />
<br />
The robot opened fire with a chain laser gun. It struck Mary multiple times, sending her flying back onto Fang, knocking both to the ground. Mary felt dizzy from the impact and her chest stung from the multiple burns. Everything was going blurry and her head started to sting.<br />
<br />
&quot;We could use that last second rescue right about now,&quot; Mary said, struggling to speak.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm afraid there'll be no rescue for you tonight,&quot; the robot leader said.</p>
