<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The car ride towards Sarah&#39;s place was uneventful. About twenty to thirty minutes later Ethan and Sarah exited the car and went up the stairs to Sarah&#39;s apartment. The plan was to meet up with some friends and go out, but Sarah wanted to head home first to change.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll go get changed,&quot; said Sarah as she opened the door and headed towards her room, &quot;I&#39;ll try to be quick.&quot;<br />
&quot;Cool,&quot; said Ethan, &quot;I&#39;m going to get something to eat.&quot;<br />
Ethan headed towards the kitchen and opened the fridge. As he glanced at the assorted food, which smelled especially strong, he scratched his legs through his jeans. They had been itching for awhile now. Ethan reached in and grabbed towards an apple but a sudden headache caused his arm to bumped a cup of liquid sitting near the edge of the shelf. The liquid spilled all over Ethan&#39;s jeans.<br />
&quot;Shit!&quot; he said in anger.<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Sarah shouted from her bedroom.<br />
&quot;I spilled some shit all over my jeans and the floor,&quot; Ethan yelled back.<br />
&quot;That&#39;s not too big a deal,&quot; replied Sarah. &quot;I&#39;m pretty sure you have a spare pair of jeans somewhere around here. You should throw those ones in the wash though to keep them from staining.&quot;<br />
Ethan made his way to the small laundry nook in Sarah&#39;s apartment and began to remove his wet jeans. What he saw was surprising. Ethan&#39;s legs had always been on the hairier side, but now they appeared to nearly covered in dark fur that Ethan could see was visibly and rapidly increasing. Ethan was speechless. He suddenly felt a sharp pain in his feet and quickly removed his socks revealing his darkened and disfigured toes that appeared to be merging together. Ethan heard an audible gasp as he turned to see Sarah newly emerged from her bedroom wearing a tank top and jeans.<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong with you!&quot; she shouted, &quot;wh...why do you have horns? What&#39;s with your ears?! Why are you so hairy!?&quot;<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know what&#39;s happening to me!&quot; Ethan yelled back.<br />
Ethan pushed past Sarah into her bedroom and towards the full-length mirror she kept against the wall. Sure enough as Sarah said Ethan had two small horns sticking out of his head as well as a pair of hair covered animal like ears in place of his normal ones. He reached up to touch them and felt his ears reflexively move at his touch. No sooner had Ethan touched his ears, a bolt of pain shot through is legs and sent him to the floor on his back.<br />
&quot;Ethan,&quot; Sarah yelled as she went to his side.<br />
 Ethan writhed around there for about thirty seconds before the pain faded. He saw Sarah staring intensely towards his feet looked to see that his feet had been replaced by a pair of dark cloven hooves. Sarah reached her hand out tentatively and touched them causing Ethan to reflexively pull his leg back.<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; said Sarah quickly as she moved away from Ethan a little bit. &quot;What the hell are you? Some kind of goat man?&quot;<br />
Ethan moved to stand on his new legs and found them surprisingly familiar and easy to navigate. &quot;I think I&#39;m a satyr,&quot; replied Ethan remembering the creatures of Greek myth. Ethan moved back in front of the mirror and removed his hoodie and tee shirt as well as what remained of his underwear. He saw that he had gained a small tail that moved around and his manhood was now concealed behind a furry animal like sheath His his upper body had also gained an increase in body hair on the chest and stomach. He also had tufts of fur that stretched down his forearms near the elbows. Ethan thought that he appeared more muscular than usual as he looked in the mirror. <br />
&quot;Do you have any idea how this happened?&quot; Sarah asked.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure,&quot; replied Ethan, &quot;though if I had to guess it was probably the wine that Chance brought home. The label was covered in Greek letters.&quot;<br />
&quot;So it&#39;s Chance&#39;s fault that my boyfriend is now a mythical creature?&quot;<br />
&quot;I guess,&quot; said Ethan turning to face Sarah. &quot;It&#39;s a safe bet something similar probably happened to Chance and JJ.&quot;<br />
Ethan took a step closer to Sarah. Now that the panic of the transformation had subsided Ethan noticed that he was emanating a sweet earthy scent. He also noticed how good his girlfriend smelled. While she lacked the sweet earthy scent he did Ethan couldn&#39;t help but take several deep whiffs of Sarah.<br />
&quot;What are you doing?&quot; she asked surprised.<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; said Ethan, &quot;everything smells stronger and you happen to smell really good.&quot;<br />
Hit with a sudden wave of lust Ethan grabbed Sarah and pulled her in for a kiss. The two locked together for a few moments before Ethan broke off the kiss and stepped back.<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; he said, &quot;I&#39;m not sure what came over me. I just really wanted to kiss you.&quot;<br />
&quot;Just kiss me?&quot; she asked pointing towards Ethan&#39;s groin.<br />
Ethan saw that his manhood had emerged and was quickly becoming fully erect. <br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t mean for that to happen,&quot; said Ethan.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; said Sarah, &quot;I mean I am your girlfriend and if I remember correctly satyrs are known for lust. Besides I must admit that I find you surprisingly attractive like this.&quot;<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; asked Ethan.<br />
&quot;Really,&quot; said a smiling Sarah as she moved back towards Ethan. &quot;We can figure out how to deal with this transformation of yours after we have a little fun with it first.&quot;<br />
That was all Ethan needed to hear. He practically ripped Sarah&#39;s clothes off her body. The two moved into the bed where Ethan penetrated Sarah&#39;s willing vagina.<br />
&quot;Harder satyr boy! Harder! satyr boy&quot; she screamed. Ethan loved every time she called him satyr boy. The couple came again and again.  He could feel the power of his goat legs as he continued to plow and plow. After several immensely pleasurable moments the couple came to rest in the bed. Ethan felt that his new satyr form could have continued longer, but it was clear that Sarah was at her limit. She passed out from sheer exhaustion. <br />
Ethan got up headed towards the bathroom to take a shower when suddenly...</p>
