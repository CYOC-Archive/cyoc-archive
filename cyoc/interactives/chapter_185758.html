<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">So Matthew came to the conclusion he would do it. He would do it for Kim. For the remainder of the afternoon he would wear her skin and explore the resort. One afternoon should be enough to fulfil Kim’s wishes. Later tonight he would spend the necessary hours to then remove her. He would miss the island party tonight but that didn’t really matter. The resort had some sort of function nearly every evening. Tomorrow he would take a day to indulge himself. He could remember reading about snorkelling trips out to a nearby coral reef. Maybe he could book himself on one of those trips?<br />
<br />
Now filled with resolve Matthew pulled the suit up to once more cover his waist. This time he kept his hands over the penis as it was covered by the skin-suit. He felt the bulge and then how it just faded away as his groin was filled with pins and needles. He stood up and once more looked at his reflection in the mirror.<br />
<br />
He now observed something he had not noticed earlier. He was shorter. He had Kim’s legs. They were not as long as his own. As they had transformed he had lost height. It was hard to judge but he was perhaps 3 or four inches shorter. The roof certainly seemed further away, and in his reflection his arms and torso now appeared over long.<br />
<br />
Still standing in front of the mirror Matthew untangled then examined the arms of the Kim suit. Just like the legs the suits arms did not have finger slots. They were just like the foot of a pair of pantyhose. Matthew bunched the arms up, then through the back of the costume entered his right hand into Kim’s right arm hole. He pushed his arm in all the way, experiencing the pressure of the rubbery costume as his muscular arms stretched the material. <br />
<br />
He waited with anticipation for the pins and needles feeling. It was about 30 seconds before they started and they lasted for about the same amount of time. He watched carefully as the suit tightened around the shape of his hand and arm a bit like shrink wrap. His whole arm shrank and when the process had finished he had Kim’s right arm complete with shiny pink nail polish. He compared his two arms. When he held them straight out his feminine right arm could barely touch the wrist of his masculine left.<br />
<br />
Next he did the same with his left arm. He watched again with fascination as it changed to become the pair of his right arm.<br />
<br />
With his two arms in place he had drawn Kim’s torso up against his own chest. He felt his shoulders change, they narrowed and lost muscle definition, but the front of the suit just remained a skin coloured piece of material. Kim’s head was just like a rubbery mask flapping from his right shoulder. The pin’s and needles stopped at his shoulders not reaching his chest or stomach.<br />
<br />
Matthew waited several minutes but no further changes appeared to be happening.<br />
<br />
He turned around and inspected his back. The slit in the costume was a gaping hole. It reminded him of a particular royal blue dress Kim owned which had  a zip at the back. It was a dress he particularly admired her in but she had mentioned it was difficult to put on. More than once she had enlisted his aid to pull up the zip.<br />
<br />
Matthew had an idea.  He reached around behind his back with his now feminine hands. With one hand on each side he bought both sides of the skin suit together in the small of his back and waited. Sure enough about 30 seconds later he felt pins and needles in the area underneath the hands. The feeling radiated outwards. <br />
<br />
He slipped his hands up further again holding the two edges of the suit together. After a thirty second wait he felt the pins and needles once more. To reach up further he had to hook his arms up over his shoulders. He pressed the sides of the slit together and waited for the pins and needles. Once they started he could let go as the sides of the slit had fused together.<br />
<br />
Soon his whole torso was experiencing pins and needles. He watched as he got a similar shrink wrap effect on his stomach. It shrank down until he had Kim’s narrow waist. Then he felt his chest changing as well. His ribs squeezed inwards first but then he felt breasts starting to develop. His hands cupped the small initial swellings and he was thrilled how they quickly developed into the firm C-cups he so admired on Kim.</p>
