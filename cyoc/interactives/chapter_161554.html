<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I didn’t really know much about Joe’s family. It sounds crazy, seeing as that we’ve been friends as long as I can remember, but I have never actually met his parents, or his brothers. Whenever I ask about them, he seemed oddly dismissive, like he wanted to change the subject. However, when he invited me to spend the summer break from school at his family home, I was excitedly curious. I remembered his stern face as we hurled our luggage in the boot of the car.<br />
<br />
“What are they like?”<br />
“They’re a bit weird. I don’t know if we should even go.”<br />
“Come on, you can’t not see your family on your 18th! That’s like, heresy or something.”<br />
<br />
I heard his voice boom with laughter.<br />
<br />
“You’re an idiot.”<br />
“It’s true. Plus I’ll be there anyway, so it won’t be too bad.”<br />
“Fine. But if they start showing you baby pictures then we’re out of there.”<br />
<br />
I couldn’t help but giggle at how anxious he was. Usually he’s incredibly confidant, and outgoing. Slightly cocky too. Being the first black football captain in the school’s history would go straight to anyone’s head. We’ve always had similar body types growing up. Except now he’s roughly a few inches taller than me, at 6’2”. Whilst I’m proud of my 6’ stature, he does like to tease me about it. He seems to be the perfect blend of a jock and a nerd. He always wore shorts to show off his powerful, toned legs. His goofy pair of glasses rested on his sharp cheekbones, magnifying his bright, blue eyes. I’m thankful his girlfriend couldn’t make the trip; I’d hate to feel like a third-wheel. Luckily my boyfriend couldn’t make either because, well, I don’t have one.<br />
<br />
The one strange thing I find about Joe is his tattoo on his right shoulder. He never mentions it. Sometimes I think he forgets it’s even there. I always wondered how he got it. I couldn’t tell you what it was a tattoo of, it looked like some sort of symbol. I would ask, but I doubt I’d get an answer. It didn’t really matter, I liked it. Anyway, we finished packing our luggage into the car boot, and began our 3-hour drive to his family home, fighting for control over the radio.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
One painfully-long drive later, we finally entered a small town. The warm sunset bled orange, as we slowly drove along the main road. The town looked remarkably clean, and welcoming. Flowers grew from every window, filling the streets with a bright array of colourful hues. Large pieces of bunting danced along the rooftops, and a large banner of Joe’s name stood proudly in the town square. Joe focused on the road, embarrassed by the extravagant display of birthday decorations that littered the entire town. Despite the bunting, and the massive amount of balloons, there was not a person in sight. The silence outside would occasionally be broken by the gentle wind, that pushed the birthday banner higher into the air. I was entranced by the town’s charm.<br />
<br />
“Oh God. That’s embarrassing. Sorry, they do like to decorate.”<br />
“This is so cute! Where is everybody?”<br />
“Probably at my parent’s house. It’s the big one up there.”<br />
<br />
He pointed at a large mansion which stood lonely on the hill. The detailed stonework of the buildings exterior could be seen even from the car. In the centre of the roof was a large glass dome, adorned with exquisite, golden decorations.<br />
<br />
“The whole town is celebrating your birthday? I barely even talk to my neighbours.”<br />
“That’s the thing. My family is the whole town.”<br />
“NO WAY!”<br />
<br />
My loud exclamation caused Joe to suddenly brake. He looked at me angrily, but soon calmed down once he saw the immense excitement spread across my face.<br />
<br />
“How many people are in your family?!”<br />
“I don’t know. I don’t think anybody does.”<br />
“And they all live here?”<br />
“Lionmouth. I think I’m the only one who doesn’t.”<br />
“Why don’t you?”<br />
<br />
Joe didn’t respond, and continued our drive through Lionsmouth. The entire town was picturesque. I’ve always wanted to live in a place like this, and as I stared out of the car window, my eyes gliding over the many shops and houses we sped past, I knew it was perfect for me! I had already chosen in my mind where I would live (there was an adorable apartment just above a florists, which was closed, yet I could still see the store glow with the flowers inside). Suddenly, I heard a loud siren from behind us. We both turned around to see a police car. The flashes of red and blue almost blinded me. Joe sighed, pulling the car over.<br />
<br />
“What’s going on?”<br />
“It’s OK. Steve knows us.”<br />
“Who’s Steve-OHH!”<br />
<br />
I turned to see a huge man standing by my door. Because of his exceptional height of around 8ft, his crotch stuck through the window, just inches away from my face. You could tell the man was packing. I was tempted to reach out and grab it, however he quickly knelt down, showing his face. He was incredibly handsome, with a large, sharp jawline, and piercing blue eyes. As he leaned his arms on the car, I couldn’t help but stare at his baseball-sized biceps, which bulged from the tight sleeves of his uniform. I almost swooned as he smiled at me, the warmth of his musclebound body radiating into me. His deep voice rumbled the car. <br />
<br />
“Hey Joe, happy birthday!”<br />
“Thanks Steve.”<br />
“This must be your buddy.”<br />
“H-hi Sir. I’m Jamie.”<br />
“Nice to meet you.”<br />
<br />
He held out his hand. As I shook it, his pecs bounced in his tight shirt as he laughed.<br />
<br />
“You’ve got a tight grip. That’ll come in handy.”<br />
“Did we speed or something Steve?”<br />
“No no no, don’t worry. Father wanted me to escort you both to the house. You know, carry your bags and stuff.”<br />
“A-are you sure Sir? We’ve got a lot of things.”<br />
“I can take it. Check this out!”<br />
<br />
Steve bent his arm as he flexed, his bicep growing bigger before my very eyes! I could hear his short sleeve stretch over his muscles. I could hear Joe sighing behind me, but I was too distracted to notice him start up the car again.<br />
<br />
“Hopefully I’ll get as big as Father. You can squeeze them if you want.”<br />
“I-um, Okay-“<br />
“Well we better not keep them waiting.”<br />
“You’re right. Follow me and I’ll take you up the hill. Nice to meet you Jamie. I’ll let you feel these bad boys later.”<br />
“N-nice to meet you too.”<br />
<br />
He quickly posed for me, showing off his guns. I could see him smile playfully as he turned to walk back to his vehicle. I saw his bulbous ass bounce in his trousers as he walked. Joe, noticing me staring, laughed.<br />
<br />
“Dude, that guy’s my brother-in-law!”<br />
“Seriously?”<br />
“Yeah, he and my bro Pat got married a few years ago, so he better not catch you staring.”<br />
“You never told me you had a gay brother.”<br />
“Everyone in my family is gay.”<br />
“WHAT?!?”<br />
“Didn’t I tell you already?”<br />
“Uhhh I think I’d remember something like that! So your parents?”<br />
“Yep, both dads. I’m the only straight one in my family, so you’ll feel right at home.”<br />
“Yeah…”<br />
<br />
Steve honked the horn of the police car, as he lead them up the hill. The small road snaked around, until it turned into a gravel path, which ran underneath a giant archway of trees, which were covered in bright green leaves. As soon as we passed underneath the archway, Joe squirmed in his seat. He looked extremely uncomfortable.<br />
<br />
“You alright?”<br />
“Yeah. My pant’s are feeling a little tight.”<br />
<br />
We both chuckled as he reached his hands into his shorts, and adjusted his underwear. We drove along the road that cut through the giant front lawn of the mansion. The sun had long since sunken behind the horizon, plunging the town into complete darkness. However, multiple spotlights illuminated the magnificent structure of brick and stone ahead of us. Large statues of what was probably Joe’s ancestors clung to the house’s outer walls. They were tall, incredibly buff African warriors, clutching huge spears, their wrists and ankles adorned with lion’s fur. The statues pointed their weapons outwards, almost like a warning for any trespassers. I couldn’t help but feel a little intimidated as Joe parked the car by one of these statues. The glass dome on the roof looked way bigger than I expected, and up close I could see what looked like intricate patterns on the glass, as well as a large collection of vines scattered around the base, spreading out onto the rooftops. The mansion itself boasted wealth, and yet Joe did not seem wealthy. I guess he drifted apart from his oddly large family.<br />
<br />
As we got out of the car, stretching our aching legs, Steve briskly walked to the boot and flung it open. I saw his butt stick out in the air as he bent over our luggage.<br />
<br />
“Do you need any help Sir?”<br />
“You can call me Steve. And I’ll be alright. I lift heavier weights at the gym.”<br />
<br />
With a loud grunt, he hoisted our bags out of the boot, carrying everything with his two strong arms. As he guided us towards the front door, three large, shadowy figures stood under the doorway. I won’t lie, I couldn’t help but get turned on as I saw them step out into the light of the outdoor lantern that hung above the door. They were all way taller than me and Joe. One matched Steve’s height, whereas the other two must’ve been at least 10ft tall! Those two giants were Joe’s dads, and they looked magnificent. Steve approached the third man, who only wore a small pair of boxers, kissing him. That must be Pat. Aku’s booming voice stopped me from staring at Pat’s growing bulge.<br />
<br />
“Welcome!”<br />
“Sorry Father, we couldn’t leave any sooner.”<br />
“That’s alright my boy. You missed dinner, but you’re friend here will have a chance to meet everyone properly tomorrow. Hi there.”<br />
“This is my Dad, Aku-“<br />
“Please, just call me Father. Everyone around here does.”<br />
“I-it’s Jamie.”<br />
<br />
As Aku reached out to shake my hand, I could get a closer look at him. Even though he was supposed to be at least 50 years old, his smooth skin and godlike physique suggested otherwise. His huge frame was covered in a deep red, silk robe, and yet I could still make out his mountainous pecs. He made the statues look frail compared to his size. His hand completely dwarfed mine as they met. I could feel his eyes travel down my body, as if he was judging a dog for Best in Show. His deep voice spoke softly, and had a slight hint of an accent. The other giant behind him grabbed his shoulders, massaging them gently. Whilst he showed more of his age, with slight hints of grey in his hair, he still had the body of a 20-year-old bodybuilder! His slightly pale arms moved down his partner’s chest, clutching the man’s waist, as he pecked Aku on the neck. He seemed less formal, but was just as friendly, which helped me feel more relaxed. I didn’t want to make a bad first impression. Joe reacted the way you’d expect anyone to react when they see their parents wearing only bathrobes. Aku’s partner had his robes opened slightly, showing off a thick patch of black chest hair.<br />
<br />
“You can call me Dan. Aku may be Father, but I’m just Dan.”<br />
“You’re still Dad.”<br />
“Thanks Joe. I’ve missed having you around.”<br />
“Nice to meet you both. And so this must be, oh….”<br />
<br />
I felt so awkward as I watched Steve and Pat continue to make out. I could see Steve’s huge cock tent his trousers, grinding onto Pat’s crotch. The man’s brown body began humping the officer, eagerly pulling him into the mansion. I couldn’t see where exactly they went, since Aku’s beefy chest blocked most of my view. I then realised I my cock was fully erect, as I tried to hide it.  Aku laughed. I hope it wasn’t because he saw my comparatively tiny manhood.<br />
<br />
“I apologise. Sometimes they can’t help themselves.”<br />
“Still, that was a bit inappropriate.”<br />
“Relax Joe! They’re just letting off some steam. They hadn’t seen each other all afternoon.”<br />
“I don’t mind it. Tonight doesn’t count anyway. I’m meeting everyone properly tomorrow.”<br />
“Excellent! Now, let me take you to your room.”<br />
<br />
Aku lifted up our luggage with ease, ushering us into the house. I walked beside Joe, who still seemed unsure if this was a good idea. Before I could speak to him, as we stepped beyond those giant, wooden doors, I felt my jaw open in awe at the magnificent entrance hall. The floor was beautifully decorated with intricate tiles and panels. A large rug laid in the centre, just beneath a breathtaking chandelier, which shone rays of gold and silver around the room. On the ceiling, I could see an oil painting of what appeared to be a great Zulu Warrior single-handedly taking down a gigantic lion, with a mane of pure flames. He was just as muscular as the statues, except I could see his huge, flaccid member dangle far below his loincloth. Three wide arches opened the walls, showing the deeper interior of the building. Two marble staircases crawled upwards opposite the front entrance, leading to two different arches on the upper floor. The walls were flooded with many artefacts of African culture, from ancient weaponry to ceremonial masks and paintings of Joe’s relatives. It was as if Shaka Zulu was on Downton Abbey! I laughed in amazement. Joe seemed unimpressed, grimacing as he saw the painting on the ceiling. He was either used to seeing a room like this, or personally didn’t find it very tasteful. I was the complete opposite of both of those possibilities.<br />
<br />
“This place is amazing!”<br />
“Thank you Jamie. This has been part of our family for generations. You room is just up there.”<br />
<br />
He guided us up one of the staircases. Again, I couldn’t help but stare at his ass as he walked. His buttcheeks protruded heavily through the robe. I saw them tense as he flexed them. When I looked up, I could see him looking over his shoulders at me, smiling. I began to sweat, realising I had been caught. There was mostly silence after that, until we entered a small corridor.<br />
<br />
The noises of Joe’s brothers and brothers-in-law echoed along the somewhat narrow hallway. Identical doors stood on the walls, leading into the many bedrooms. As we walked past each one, I could hear their inhabitants inside. One man was snoring heavily, whilst another was playing music especially loudly. As we stopped outside one door, I could hear muffled moans and the heavy banging of a bed against the wall from the room opposite. The moans grew louder and the pace of the banging quickened. I could hear two men in there speak, but couldn’t make out what they were saying. Aku laughed again.<br />
<br />
“Pat and Steve. Apologies again. They will be like this for a few hours.”<br />
“A few hours?!”<br />
“I know, not very long. Well, not long in our family-“<br />
“Thanks Dad, Father, I think we should get some rest now.”<br />
“Very well. May I speak with Jamie for one second? Go to bed Dan, I shan’t be far behind.”<br />
“Goodnight boys.”<br />
“Good night.”<br />
<br />
Joe’s tone seemed rushed, eager to block out the noise of the wild sex in the opposite room. As Joe quickly slammed the door shut, Dan exited the corridor, leaving me alone with Aku. The man knelt down, grabbing my arms with his hands. I could feel his warm grip slowly move down to my hands. He was still smiling.<br />
<br />
“Thank you so much for coming. It means a lot.”<br />
“It’s no trouble Aku-I mean Father. I’ve always wanted to meet you.”<br />
“Have I lived up to your expectations?”<br />
“You’ve succeeded them.”<br />
“Good…”<br />
<br />
He pulled me into his warm embrace, as my face was pressed against his pecs. I felt his huge biceps push me further into his body. I tried to avoid touching him with my hardon, but it was no use. The more he pushed me in, the closer it was. Soon, I felt my entire body rubbing against this ebony giant. My crotch pressed firmly against his thick shaft which dangled freely under his robe. I could feel it down to my knee! It must’ve been at least 2ft-long, and it wasn’t even hard. That, mixed with the continuous groans coming from Pat and Steve’s Room, I almost came in my trousers as I felt his member twitch with excitement. Before I could grab it, he broke from the intense hug, still smiling. I didn’t know what to say. I was still in shock of the beast between his legs.<br />
<br />
“I look forward to what tomorrow will bring. Good night my child.”<br />
<br />
Standing up, he strode out of the corridor. I watched him leave, trembling from our exchange. Walking into our bedroom, I saw Joe standing over the bed in his vest and boxers, with a stern expression on his face.<br />
<br />
“There’s only one bed.”<br />
“Can’t we share?”<br />
“I guess…”<br />
“Hey, have you been working out?”<br />
“No…?”<br />
<br />
His face quickly turned to confusion, as he looked up at me. I could’ve sworn his arms weren’t as big as they were. His biceps looked more defined, and I’m sure his shoulders have broadened. The bulge between his meaty thighs has always been big, but it looked bigger. However, I chose not to stare at my friend’s dick when he was looking at me. And so, shrugging it off,I began to change into my striped pyjamas. Even then, I still felt incredibly underdressed. There we both silently laid in the bed with a wide gap between us. Our minds were still racing with the thoughts of our brief interaction with Joe’s family. I was still rock-hard, as I couldn’t stop thinking about Aku, and his impressive member.<br />
<br />
“So what did Father want?”<br />
“What? Oh, uh, nothing. Just to say thank you for coming.”<br />
“Oh, well I am glad you are here. It’ll be nice not being alone around these horny freaks.”<br />
“Yeah. Good night.”<br />
“G’night.”<br />
<br />
As Joe turned off the light, I was tempted to quietly jerk off. However, the exhaustion of the journey quickly took control, as I felt myself fall deeply asleep in minutes. I just hope Joe doesn’t snore as loudly as his brothers.</p>
