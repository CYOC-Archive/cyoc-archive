<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">James walked through the  farmer&#39;s market. As he did so, a heavy thud accompanied each step. Today was his birthday. Not only that, but his eighteenth birthday. What is he doing? Visiting out of state for a wedding in a place more miles away from the people who&#39;d care than people that don&#39;t. Tomorrow is his aunt&#39;s birthday, right after his, but that&#39;s not why he&#39;s out in the middle of nowhere Kansas instead of Colorado. No, the problem was she wanted her wedding right on the same day of her birthday. This meant he couldn&#39;t even celebrate with his friends the day before, because he had to get on the road. His friends agreed to celebrate when he got home, but it still left a bitter taste in his mouth.<br />
<br />
It probably wouldn&#39;t&#39;ve felt so bad for him, if only he didn&#39;t know that his aunt hated him. Apparently, when he was just a toddler he did something stupid against her, something with gum.  She ended up having to shave a lot of her hair, and the relationship never recovered. He probably wouldn&#39;t have been on good relations anyway, since she held the grudge for so long, but maybe it wouldn&#39;t be as bad as it was now. With a heavy sigh, James plodded along the market as native folk haggled for produce and knick-knacks. As a sort of consolation present, he recieved about a hundred dollars to spend freely while he was in Kansas. His father knew he didn&#39;t want to be here, celebrating something for someone he didn&#39;t like. He only put his foot down on going when his sister requested the entire family to attend, including James. That&#39;s why he was here with his parents and older sister.<br />
<br />
As another consolation, almost, he was here at the market. His father also knew that James liked unique trinkets and oddities, which appeared to be in good supply at this market. Once again, he sighed. He should probably at least buy something so he doesn&#39;t upset his own folks. For the first time since he arrived, he stopped and  looked at the marketplace. All around him were stands of various types. Most of them food, but also a few trinket stores. He was about to head over to what looked like a stand for hand-made clay figures, but another stand suddenly caught his full attention. Unlike the other selling trinkets, this one was extremely plain. Not even covered by a tent in case of rain, all the merchandise laid flat against the large wooden crate that worked as a counter and display. Even more strange, not a single person paid it any attention, walking past it.<br />
<br />
Interest piqued, James walked towards the simple business front. However, James slowed his pace when he realized something rather alarming. There was an old lady, gypsy like in clothing, behind the stand. That wasn&#39;t what made him wary, but the fact that she had been eyeing him the entire time, even when he just noticed the stand. Before he change his path however, James found himself standing in front of the plain stand, looking down at the lady and her merchandise.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, young man.&quot; said the old woman, &quot;you like knick-knacks and trinkets.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How did you know?&quot; James said, a little taken aback.<br />
<br />
The old woman only laughed, breaking her ominous appearance as she did so before calmly settling back into her chair. &quot;What other reason would you visit such a stand?&quot; She hovered her hand over the various things on the table as she spoke. She laughed again, sputtering a little bit in her advanced age at his embarrassment before continuing. &quot;It&#39;s okay boy, it&#39;s more than a matter-of-fact statement. Only the people really interested in oddities and collection pieces ever come to my stand.&quot; With that she waved over her wares again. &quot;Take a look and see what sticks out to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
With the invitation given, James stepped forward and looked down at the cargo crate turned table. Before him, all kinds of holdable things were displayed before him. A bag of what looked-like marbles. Small statues of various religious and celebrity figures. Even a dollar store whoopee-cushion. A truly odd arrangement of ancient and modern things. Completely uninterested in anything the old woman had to offer, James was about to look back up and apologize then excuse himself when something finally caught his eye. It was an amulet, but it&#39;s chain obscured the gemstone by the way it laid over it.  He picked it up,  and let  it hang in the air.<br />
<br />
Despite the discolored chain, the amulet itself looked clean and valuable. A large ruby gemstone displayed itself brilliantly. In the center of it, two figures were etched into the ruby itself. The first figure looked like a man, except its head was that of a dragon, with an appendage that looked like a tail behind him. The second figure was undeniably a dragon, quadrupedal and all.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah,&quot; the old lady sighed, &quot;Found something you like?&quot; She seemed relieved as she watched James hold the ruby amulet in the air. &quot;That&#39;s the dragon husbandry amulet. It&#39;s a symbol of love in certain cultures.&quot; James couldn&#39;t deny the love aspect, since there was a small etching of a heart floating in the dragon figure&#39;s maw as it was open.<br />
<br />
&quot;Husbandry?&quot; James questioned, &quot;Like animal husbandry, where you take care of animals that are comfortable with you,  like a farmer?&quot; James supposed that made sense, given where he was currently.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sort of.&quot; the old gypsy responded, &quot;Indeed, the amulet&#39;s main purpose is similar to a regular animal husbandry in loving and help in siring animals. However, this amulet specializes in dragons.&quot; the old lady smiled innocently.<br />
<br />
&quot;But&quot;, James said plainly, &quot;Dragons aren&#39;t real.&quot; Also, to James, her definition of animal husbandry seemed a little too literal. The old lady only laughed put a finger to her nose.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps, but if you plan on buying it, a little advice. &#39;The one who puts on the amulet will forever be the sire, and those he comes in contact with in his life will be the dam for his children of fire.&#39; In case you forget, it&#39;s also inscribed in the metal ring around that amulet of yours. Although, since it seems like it was made for you, you might have some natural resistance to some parts of that inscription.&quot; Sure enough, as James looked, the ring holding the ruby to the necklace was inscribed with those words. <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Made for me?&quot; James said, not looking up from the amulet. Natural resistances? James really couldn&#39;t understand what she was getting at. &quot;Yours, for the right price.&quot; The old woman responded, &quot;Let&#39;s say, a hundred.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Seventy.&quot; James responded back quickly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Deal.&quot; the old woman said happily.<br />
<br />
It seemed the old woman didn&#39;t really care about haggling, James thought. As he reached into his wallet, he felt surprisingly happy about the purchase. Usually, he didn&#39;t spring for jewelry type things, but as he handed three twenties and a ten to the old woman, he felt an excitement that he couldn&#39;t figure out why it existed. Maybe it was the vagueness of the amulet, or maybe it&#39;s because he actually found something. Maybe it was because he spent seventy dollars instead of a hundred. Either way, the old woman wrapped the amulet in an ornate cloth, and handed it to him, before sending him away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Try it on sometime!&quot; She said, waving weakly to the young man, who waved back as he walked to rejoin his family.<br />
<br />
At first, he walked without problem, but after only a short distance, the old woman&#39;s words bored into his mind. Try it on sometime? He looked down at the gypsy-clothed amulet. It was surprisingly heavy for its size. He stopped walking. His family was waiting right around the corner. Should he put it on now? Or Should he wait? Could he?</p>
