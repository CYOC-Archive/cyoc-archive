<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kimi was in the mall with her friend Elyse, they were both 15 at the time and were friends. They had been walking along the bottom floor when they stumbled upon a small shop on the edge of a hair salon and clothing store. For some reason Kimi was weirdly drawn towards it, dragging Elyse with her. The outside was decorated with dark colours, mostly green and red, completely opposite to the bright white of the hair salon and the light blue of the clothing store. <br />
<br />
“I don’t think I really want to go in there Kimi,” said Elyse,<br />
“Oh come on, I’ve gone into two of the shops you wanted to go into, so let’s go into this one,” responded Kimi,<br />
As they entered, the door opened without a bell. Sitting at the counter was an old man with a, what Elyse called a ‘Wizard Beard.’ It was long and white, he had long white hair also and it seemed to be smooth and clean, as was his beard. They walked in to see him with his head down and eyes closed. Kimi started to look around the shop while Elyse was kind of freaked out. Elyse wanted to leave, until she saw a glass ball, “Oh my god!!” She said excitedly,<br />
“What!?” Kimi said startled, <br />
“It’s a crystal ball!!”<br />
“No it isn’t,” said a shaky but still lively voice, they both looked up to see the man was now sitting up, eyes open and facing Elyse, “I don’t get many visitors to this shop anymore. That ball is used to hold objects and not let them decay or gather dust,”<br />
“Oh, well that’s quite stupid,” said Elyse,<br />
“Actually it’s quite useful, I used it to keep a half eaten apple just last week,” he said with a grin on his face,<br />
“Well then what’s.. uhh.. this,” she looked around and found a spoon,<br />
“That is a spoon that will stir by itself so you can do your other deeds while cooking, it also doesn’t get dirty,”<br />
“Okay. What’s this then,” she pointed at a zipper with nothing attached to it,<br />
“Yeah actually what is that??” Said Kimi, who’d been admiring the other objects,<br />
“That is the keep-safe bag, only the true owner of it can open it, it has unlimited space and extends depending on the size of the object you want to keep inside it.”<br />
“Wow that’s actually pretty cool,” said Kimi,<br />
“Yeah, can you prove it,” said Elyse,<br />
“Well then,” she handed the zipper over to him and he unzipped it, a hole appeared only in the top of it, the bottom looked like it was flat, he grabbed a pen and dropped it in, it fell straight through and didn’t fall onto the desk. “And then you can choose whatever you want to get out of it,” he held his and above the bag and the pen flew straight into it.<br />
“Wow!!” Said Elyse, “Can I have it?? Please,” said Elyse,<br />
“Yes of course, it’s ten dollars,”<br />
“I thought it was going to be free, but that’s cheap for a magical bag like that,” she handed him $10 and he handed her the bag,<br />
“It should respond to you, and only you now,” she dropped her purse in and it fell straight in, then she held her hand over it and the purse flew straight back up into her hand.<br />
<br />
“Having trouble choosing??” Said the man to Kimi,<br />
“Yes, I saw a pot of purple dust,”<br />
“Ah yes, the dust can be thrown into a persons face and they will be mesmerised until it touches the ground,”<br />
“But I keep looking at this in the case,” she points to a glass case with a small metal bar with curious markings and symbols on it. It had a wooden grip on it at the front where your hand would sit.<br />
“Oh, yes, that is a device I never found out how to use, perhaps you could. I’m used to a good old fashioned staff, but the wand was said to be more elegant and powerful, able to do, create, or change anything if someone was skilled enough to handle its power. I’ll lend it to you for free since I won’t let you pay for something I don’t know will work.” He stepped up from his table and grabbed a large wooden staff, presumably the one he was talking about before. He walked up to the shelf and grabbed the case to then settle it on the desk. He looked around for something and then realised he had forgotten something.<br />
“Looking for this??” Elyse handed him some keys, “You left them in the bag,”<br />
“Thank you,” he said as he pushed the key into a small lock on the case, opening it wide and holding the hilt carefully, “it should be nice and sturdy, so if you’re flicking it around then don’t worry about it braking,” he heanded Kimi the wand. She held it in her hand,<br />
“Thank you, what was your name??”<br />
“Uynderall, but sir works to,”<br />
“Thanks Uynderall!!” Said Elyse happily as she exited the store,<br />
“Thank you Sir,” said Kimi as she exited the store.<br />
<br />
Kimi hadn’t touched the wand since she left the store, it had been in her pocket, she waited until she was home.<br />
<br />
When she got home, after Elyse had left to go back to her house, she got out her wand in her bedroom where her parents couldn’t see. She held it in her right hand it flicked it, nothing happend. She flicked it again, nothing happened. She decided to flick it one more time with as much hope as possible, she flicked it, a metal rod flung out and went 6 inches down. It was was about 2 centimetres thick and completely a cylinder, at the tip it split into two ends, then it went back up and started to join at the top, but didn’t touch. She looked at it and was amazed that it fit into the handle. She flicked it again with the handle out, and instead of going back inside like she thought it would, a red ball appeared in the middle, it glowed and then a bolt of the same red ball flew out and hit her right foot. Her foot began to grow forwards, breaking her socks. Her foot started to bend upwards while still growing forwards. Her foot also started to get white hairs growing on it. The hair grew half way up her right shin. She looked at it, she’d given herself a rabbits foot. What else could she do, so she flicked it again..</p>
