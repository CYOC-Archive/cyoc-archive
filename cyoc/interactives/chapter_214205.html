<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Veles watched Geoffrey and Gregory talk off to the side of the campfire and then start wandering the various shops in the caravan. <br />
<br />
Charlie left with two of the musicians-the badger and the weasel-to go get some beer. Palseks… had snuck off. Veles couldn’t find her anywhere.<br />
<br />
That left Veles and the otter at the fire. Veles tried to remember his name. He was the one he’d altered to be ‘pretending to be slim’, so he was uncomfortably stuffed into a form-concealing outfit. Nothing could hide his chubby face, though.<br />
<br />
The otter hefted himself up from his position at the far side of the fire and plopped himself down next to Veles with a weighty thump.<br />
<br />
“Hi!” The otter smiled at Veles brightly.<br />
<br />
“Ummm, sorry, what was your name again?” Veles asked.<br />
<br />
“Oh! It’s Amicus,” Amicus held out a chubby paw. <br />
<br />
Veles shook it.<br />
<br />
“How can I help you, Amicus?” <br />
<br />
“You’re a wizard, right?” The otter asked.<br />
<br />
“Yeeeeees….” Veles raised a brow.<br />
<br />
“Can you make me skinny?” Amicus stared at Veles with an intense, eager stare.<br />
<br />
“...Make you skinny?”<br />
<br />
Amicus nodded.<br />
<br />
A grin spread across Veles’ muzzle. <br />
<br />
“Why, yes I can, actually.” Veles said slowly. “Would you like to watch while I work?”<br />
<br />
“You can do that?”<br />
<br />
“Sure!” Veles scrounged in his pack for a pair of glasses. “Put these on.”<br />
<br />
Amicus did, adjusting the round, wire-rimmed glasses on his muzzle. <br />
<br />
“Whoah! Everything is glowing!” Amicus breathed.<br />
<br />
“That’s the enchantments. Tons of things on this caravan are enchanted.” Veles explained. “Those glass have Detect Magic enchanting them. Charlie uses them to check for traps but he says they give him a migraine.”<br />
<br />
“Oh.” Amicus’s smile faltered. “You mean the wolf?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah.”<br />
<br />
“Are you two a thing?” Amicus asked.<br />
<br />
“No?” Veles furrowed his brow, “I’m between relationships at the moment. Anyways, let’s go check out your backstory.”<br />
<br />
“Backstory?”<br />
<br />
“Your biography. Trimming magic lets me alter backstories.”<br />
<br />
“I see, so you can make me skinny!”<br />
<br />
“Depends on how your biography is worded.”<br />
<br />
“Oh. Well, let’s find out, then!” Amicus said eagerly.<br />
<br />
Smiling, Veles pulled out the character sheet and then intoned, “Trim.”<br />
<br />
Amicus’ sheet appeared in the air above him, glowing brightly. The otter looked up at it and his eyes went wide. His mouth shaped into an ‘o’ as he watched Veles flick to his backstory. Then the arctic fox watched the otter cringe.<br />
<br />
‘Amicus Riverfisher, otter, male, 26, member of the Northern Forest Band. Currently a guard on the caravan. Is quiet and thoughtful and pretending to be slim with very fat build.’<br />
<br />
The otter coughed, embarrassed, shifting uncomfortably in his seat. Veles pretended this was the first time he’d seen the backstory and feigned surprise.<br />
<br />
“What? You’re actually fat?” Veles stared at Amicus in shock. The overfed otter squirmed under Veles’ gaze. “I thought you meant you wanted me to trim a few pounds off your waist! Why are you hiding it?”<br />
<br />
“Because I’m an otter, I’m not supposed to be fat!” Amicus quietly wailed.<br />
<br />
“Okay, okay,” Veles held up a paw, “We can fix this.”<br />
<br />
“We can!?” Amicus’ eyes shone bright in the firelight.<br />
<br />
“Yes. I can remove words from your backstory.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, then delete the pretending part!” Amicus demanded.<br />
<br />
Veles smirked. “Oh. Sure. If that’s what you want.”<br />
<br />
He reached up over the otter’s head. Then, carefully watching the otter’s reaction, he gripped ‘pretending to be slim’ in its entirety and pulled it away. For a split second, the otter looked a little confused. Then his eyes widened in shock. Veles popped a boner as he watched horror steal across the otter’s face.<br />
<br />
Amicus turned to shout at Veles, but when he opened his mouth, all that came out was a long, loud belch.<br />
<br />
As he burped, his clothes loosened, letting his body sag and relax. The look of horror on Amicus’ face was replaced by one of pure relief as his belly sagged over his knees. A few moments later, the otter finished his belch and rubbed his gut with a happy smile on his face.<br />
<br />
“Thanks Veles!” Amicus chuckled, “It felt like my clothes were so tight! What’d you do, anyways?”<br />
<br />
Veles blinked. So Amicus didn’t remember what had just happened. That was kinda weird, since he was watching it happen.<br />
<br />
So Veles grinned “You know, you just had a little gas problem. Try to cut down on the fried fish, eh bud?”<br />
<br />
“Aw, I love fried fish,” Amicus pouted.<br />
<br />
Veles nodded, adjusting his pants, since his cock was rock hard and tenting them pretty obviously, and turned his attention to the phrase swirling in his paw. He considered placing it on the sheet. But…did he really need to save it? It was already starting to fade away, so he dropped the phrase, letting it dissipate in the shadows between his feet.<br />
<br />
A chubby webbed paw placed itself on the fox’s thigh. <br />
<br />
Veles looked up to see the otter had removed the enchanted glasses and was staring at him with dewy eyes. The otter glanced down at the fox’s obvious boner and back at him meaningfully. As Veles continued to stare into the otter’s eyes, he felt a paw begin creeping its way up his thigh and felt himself blush under his fur.<br />
<br />
Maybe he should stop this. “Trim.”<br />
<br />
Again, the otter’s backstory appeared over his head. A head leaning towards him in tandem with the paw that was sliding towards the fox’s crotch. Veles quickly read the newly generated biography.<br />
<br />
‘Amicus Riverfisher, otter, male, 26, member of the Northern Forest Band. Currently a guard on the caravan. Is quiet and thoughtful with a very fat build. Is enamored with Veles the arctic fox wizard.’<br />
<br />
Veles gasped, eyes focusing on the new sentence. Those words, ‘is enamored with Veles’! those were awesome words to add to his list! He could use them on anyone and get what he wanted out of them!<br />
<br />
Veles didn’t exactly find the corpulent lutrine guard attractive, but so long as he could… wait, could he FARM the words? Like, if he removed them and then made a pass at the otter, would they reappear? He seemed really forward and interested in Veles. How many times could he steal the same words from someone’s backstory?<br />
<br />
Oh shit, could he just scan a bunch of people and…<br />
<br />
No, erasing love and relationships between other people was literally evil. Doing it to a bandit-err, former bandit-who was in love with HIM was a different story. But taking that from the otter also felt kinda bad too. Someone liking Veles was… rare. A gift, sort of.<br />
<br />
The otter finished leaning forward and kissed Veles’ muzzle. <br />
<br />
As Amicus’ tongue entered Veles’ mouth, he couldn’t help but notice a pleasant, fishy taste.  Was that just how an otter’s saliva tasted?  Or perhaps it was a remnant of his last meal.  Regardless, Veles just leaned back and decided to enjoy the moment. <br />
<br />
Veles wasn’t really into fat guys, but that webbed paw was stroking his cock through his pants and he was a really good kisser. The fox still considered backing out despite how soft Amicus was when Veles felt him up. Then he realized out of all the people in this world, Amicus was safe. As enamored as Veles had been with Fergus just a few days ago, it felt like whatever bond had existed between them had come to a sudden end.  And when he thought about the rest of the party – about an orgy with a dumb bear, smelly wolf, and pretentious mink. Well, why not just ride this one out?<br />
<br />
He continued making out, though his clothes were starting to feel a little tight. <br />
<br />
Amicus broke the kiss and smiled, “Wanna come with me when I do my rounds?”<br />
<br />
“Rounds?”<br />
<br />
“Of the colony, handsome!” Amicus chuckled, “I’m a guard, remember?”<br />
<br />
“Oh,” Veles blinked, “right.”<br />
<br />
Amicus hefted himself off the log and straightened his tunic out. Veles found himself struggling to follow before the otter offered him a hand. The fox stood, knees popping, and staggered after the otter. God, he must have sat wrong, all his clothes were chafing!<br />
<br />
“You okay?” Amicus asked.<br />
<br />
“Hmm?” Veles looked up at the corpuscular otter and nodded, “Yeah, sorry, I think I sat on the log and cut off circulation to my legs.”<br />
<br />
“Ooof, yeah, you gotta be careful with logs,” Amicus winced, “Do you like cobweb candy?”<br />
<br />
“Cobweb candy?” The fox’s stomach growled.<br />
<br />
Amicus grinned and took Veles’ paw, “Come on, I’ll show you!”<br />
<br />
The fat otter pulled the fox along to a place spinning sugar, and Veles immediately realized what it was – cotton candy.. Wherever this caravan was from must just call it cobwebs. Another odd but not unsurprising quirk to this world.<br />
<br />
Amicus spooled him some on a stick and then helped himself to an extra big one. But it only took one bite for Veles to realize his disappointment – the cotton candy he’d invented in Bridge’Ithe had been flavored.  Grape, cherry, and, of course, cotton candy flavor were all common variations.  Apparently Nicholas’ Alchemical flavorings hadn’t made it much outside the city.<br />
<br />
His clothes were too tight and restricting, but the otter seemed excited with a bunch of things and the fox couldn’t help but share in his enthusiasm. They made it to a local pie maker and considered buying on. Veles was still hungry. Amicus bought a few pies for them to share-cherry, blueberry, and apple- and they walked back to the party’s campfire to eat it.<br />
<br />
“Are we really going to eat all of these pies?” Veles asked, trying to ignore how hungry he was.<br />
<br />
“What?” Amicus laughed, “Well, yeah, I guess. But is that so strange?”<br />
<br />
“Eating three pies in one night?” Veles tugged on the collar of his too-tight tunic. “Uh, yeah?”<br />
<br />
“Hmmm. Okay, maybe you have a point. But I’m bigger!” Amicus patted his saggy gut, “I gotta eat more!”<br />
<br />
“Sure,” Veles smiled. “Otherwise you might waste away.”<br />
<br />
“Exactly!” Amicus grinned.<br />
<br />
There came a shout from nearby.<br />
<br />
Veles and Amicus turned to see a crowd gathered around a wagon a few hundred yards away. They hurried over, leaving Veles breathless and sweating. His paws were hurting something fierce when they reached the crowd. A boar was standing over a an emaciated pile of skin and bones that had once been a horse, yelling at a scared mouse boy who was cowering in front of a nearby cart.<br />
<br />
“How the hell could a horse starve to death in a few hours, boy?!” the boar roared.<br />
<br />
“S-sir, the horse was fine before-”<br />
<br />
“Well he ain’t fine now, is he!” the boar nudged the dead horse with a boot.<br />
<br />
“Maybe someone killed it?” the mouse’s voice quavered.<br />
<br />
“And whose job was it to stop that? Stupid boy!’ The guard cuffed the mouse across the face, sending him to the ground. “He’s only good for glue now!”<br />
<br />
Veles was barely able to focus, his tunic was so tight he could barely breathe, but the last bit struck him as more plausible than a horse suddenly becoming emaciated. Still, what spell could cause a horse to starve to death in a matter of hours? <br />
<br />
“Noting we can do here,” Amicus nudged the fox, “come on, let’s go back to your camp.”<br />
<br />
They left the crowd and traveled less than a hundred yards to their tents and campfire. <br />
<br />
However, when they arrived, they saw even more people crowding around their carriage. Veles blinked and was able to crane his head just enough to see Geoffrey and Charlie standing near their horses, not that they could really be called horses anymore.  Just like the guard’s horse from earlier, the party’s horses had collapsed into two misshapen piles of emaciated skin and bones.<br />
<br />
“What the fuck?” Amicus stared, “are we under attack?”<br />
<br />
“Geoffrey!” Gregory’s voice cut through the mutters of the gathered crowd. “Get rid of these people and help me with my armor. It isn’t fitting properly.”<br />
<br />
The Prince stepped out of the carriage and Veles gasped. He was bigger than when Veles had last seen him. His slender build replaced with a muscular one, which looked odd on a mink. It was no wonder that his armor, made for a twunk, no longer fit him. Veles hadn’t seen Gregory work out and now he rivaled Charlie. How had he gotten so fit so fast?<br />
<br />
Veles panted, clawing at his tunic. It was a struggle to breathe. Why did three horses die of starvation? And where did the Prince get all those muscles?<br />
<br />
He gasped, eyes widening in sudden realization. <br />
<br />
It couldn’t be! Three horses died of starvation. His parchment had three ‘starvation’ words on it. And the Prince had grown ‘muscles’, just like the other word he’d lost. All of them had disappeared. But somehow they’d attached themselves to other people, like soul essence seeking the nearest viable target.<br />
<br />
“I don’t believe it!” Veles gasped.<br />
<br />
“Come on,” the otter tugged on the fox’s paw, “Let’s go to my tent until things cool down. It’s just over there.”<br />
<br />
Amicus hurried Veles further down the circle of carts and wagons before they came to his tent. It was big enough to walk into - more like a field officer’s tent that the pitiful pyramid-shaped ones Veles’ party had. The fox made it into the tent and almost collapsed, completely winded. As he took a moment to catch his breath, he noticed his reflection in a small mirror in the corner of the tent.<br />
<br />
Veles wasn’t sure, but his face looked…chubby.<br />
<br />
“See, my cot sleeps two,” Amicus winked pointing at a large bed in the opposite corner.  The otter glanced back at Veles and, apparently taking notice of the distressed look on Veles’ face, hurried over to his side. <br />
<br />
“Are you okay? Let me help you out of those clothes,” The otter said as he reached towards the fox’s thick hand, which was clumsily pawing at its neck in a vain attempt to release his tunic.<br />
<br />
The otter’s webbed paws, slid over Veles’ own and expertly unbuttoned the clasp that had previously been straining against Veles’ neck. <br />
<br />
Button after button, the otter worked his way down Veles’ chest, fur and flab puffing out as each was undone.. When the final button was loose, Veles’ large belly spilled forth, pooling out into his lap. The fox gasped in relief, rubbing his gut and feeling its heft. How the hell had he managed to smuggle something so big into such a small tunic?<br />
<br />
“There we go!” Amicus said brightly, “Doesn’t that feel better?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, much,” Veles said, still playing with his flab, staring at it in confusion.<br />
<br />
“Why would you hide such a nice, firm gut?” Amicus asked, reaching out and stroking his paw over Veles’ blubbery expanse of a belly. <br />
<br />
“I…” Veles frowned, “…I don’t know?”<br />
<br />
Had he always been this fat? He was sure the tunic had fit this morning when he’d put it on. <br />
<br />
“Well, you don’t have to pretend around me,” Amicus smiled and gave Veles’ gut a pat, “Hold on, let me get you some of my clothes.”<br />
<br />
The otter got up and walked over to his personal lock-box and pulled forth a few outfits and tossed them to the fox. Veles caught them with his chubby paws and stared.<br />
<br />
They were big. The green tunic was long and very spacious in the middle, obviously made for saggy otter guts. Beneath the baggy shirt was a pair of trousers with a wide waist. A long belt completed the ensemble. The other outfits were much the same, just blue and red.<br />
<br />
“Go on, you can have those. They might be a bit too big for you, but who knows, maybe you’ll grow into them,” Amicus winked.<br />
<br />
Veles wriggled out of his pelt-tight trousers and picked up the new clothes. He slipped them on and found them to actually be rather baggy. Apparently he was nowhere near as rotund as the otter, which, at least, was a relief. That being said, the new clothes did noting to hide his increased weight, making the fox feel rather anxious.<br />
<br />
When he glanced in the mirror, he saw a rather fat fox in baggy clothes staring back at him. <br />
<br />
“Looking good,” Amicus smiled before turning his attention to the pie on the table, “Ready for dessert?”<br />
<br />
That nagging feeling that something was wrong came back to Veles in full force. His old clothes had definitely fit him before. But now there was no way he’d be able to fit all this flab into them without popping a button or two.<br />
<br />
“Trim,” Veles said, targeting himself.<br />
<br />
A veritable wall of text hovered above him, glowing softly.<br />
<br />
Veles read through his background, trying to figure out if he’d had something added Into it. He flicked a pudgy finger and the biography scrolled down. He saw something at the very bottom. ‘Pretending to be slim’.<br />
<br />
He cursed under his breath.<br />
<br />
“Here you go,” Amicus said, offering Veles a forkful of cherry pie.<br />
<br />
The fox absentmindedly ate it, and then the consecutive forkfuls as the otter fed him. Veles was too busy trying to figure out how to deal with the phrase to care. The tart juiciness of the cherries and the flaky, buttery crust played well together on his palette anyways, so he had no complaints. <br />
<br />
“How’s it taste?” Amicus forked another portion of pie into Veles’ maw.<br />
<br />
“Mmm, ish goo!” Veles replied, the chubby fox mumbling through a mouthful of delicious pie-stuff.<br />
<br />
Maybe he should just remove the phrase, see if that worked? Reaching up, he pulled ‘pretending to be slim and placed it on his parchment. At least there it wouldn’t be floating around causing people to have weight problems and wardrobe malfunctions.<br />
<br />
It was so fucking stupid! Why were the words disappearing in the first place? Amicus forked more pie into the fox’s gullet and Veles felt obligated to chew. Apple. It was pretty good. He patted his gut, feeling it wobble under his paw. That was when he realized…he wasn’t getting any thinner. <br />
<br />
Why wouldn’t he get…oh no! Deleting that phrase only meant he was fat but no longer hiding it. In other words, his new build would be in his biography somewhere. Panicking, Veles glanced up at his backstory. Was there something in it he could delete? <br />
<br />
Wait.<br />
<br />
His backstory had changed.<br />
<br />
“Well, that’s two pies down, ready for more?” Amicus held out a tantalizing piece of blueberry pie in front of Veles’ sticky muzzle.<br />
<br />
Veles absentmindedly took a bite, tension gathering in his stomach as he read the last paragraph in his own description.<br />
<br />
‘Veles is currently dating Amicus Riverfisher, an obese otter caravan guard who is in a band. The fat fox loves being fed by his doting boyfriend. He can’t wait for the day he outgrows the otter. And neither can Amicus.’<br />
<br />
The tension in his belly started to grow even stronger. Veles knew he was overfull, but paradoxically, that feeling of being stuffed was going away. It was a strange pressure and a soreness, like the muscles in his stomach were strained.<br />
<br />
“Why are you sucking in your gut?” Amicus asked, feeding more pie to the fox.<br />
<br />
“Sucking in my gut?” Veles asked around a mouthful of luscious blueberries.<br />
<br />
He reached up to adjust his backstory and found himself completely at a loss as to what he could change to fix this. There were no ‘thin’ or ‘slim’ descriptor words to play with. Just deleting it wouldn’t make him any less tubby. <br />
<br />
To make matters worse, Amicus seemed to take his upraised arms as an invitation and began rubbing Veles’ soft potbelly. It only made the increasing pressure in Veles’ middle ever more distracting and uncomfortable.<br />
<br />
“Amicus,” Veles protested through a mouthful of blueberry, “Stop! I’m trying to get skinny.”<br />
<br />
“Skinny?” Amicus cocked his. Then a smile spread across his face. “Oh! So you can gain it all again. That could be fun.”<br />
<br />
“Sure,” Veles gasped, his midsection sore and throbbing, “Amicus, if you had the ability to delete any word of sentence, how would you make this paragraph describe a skinny person?”<br />
<br />
Veles read off his backstory.<br />
<br />
“Oh, sweetie,” Amicus frowned, “I don’t think you can. And I don’t see any letters you could delete either.”<br />
<br />
Veles grimaced.<br />
<br />
The otter spooned the last of the pie, “Okay, open up.”<br />
<br />
“I’m way too full!” Veles squirmed.<br />
<br />
“I told you to stop sucking in your gut, silly,” Amicus prodded Veles wobbly belly. “Go on, relax. Let go.”<br />
<br />
Veles didn’t know what the otter was talking about, but the tension was getting too hard for him to ignore. He decided to follow Amicus’ advice to let it out and relaxed his stomach muscles. Immediately, his pelt started to stretch as his body filled up with fat. The fox started to feel the beginnings of relief, the tension lessening, but it didn’t stop.<br />
<br />
The otter’s head slipped below Veles’ growing gut and nuzzled between the fox’s legs, spreading them apart. His warm, moist muzzle engulfed the fox’s blood-red dick, which had grown incredibly hard. Veles wondered why he was so incredibly horny, but as the otter’s webbed paws groped his softly expanding belly, a pleasurable realization washed over him.<br />
<br />
He was so big and fluffy and soft.<br />
<br />
His gut swelled outward, beginning to fill out the borrowed tunic that had been so baggy moments ago. The thought that he was becoming as big as his boyfriend was so hot that his cock belched up a dollop of precum. Amicus quickly swallowed it down, beginning to bob on Veles’ knob, the top of his head bumping against the fox’s burgeoning underbelly.<br />
<br />
Everything about the fox was softening and rounding out as Veles lost the last of his muscle tone. His pecs sagged slowly onto his wobbly gut, the vestigial nipples swelling to the size of pepperonis as he grew a pair of perky moobs. Veles’ cock receded into his burgeoning fat pad and otter’s questing tongue and warm, sucking muzzle followed after it, suckling firmly on it.<br />
<br />
“Amicus,” Veles moaned, flexing his paws and writhing in the chair as each gentle tug and suck sent jolts of pure pleasure straight to his brain, “Amicus! Fuck…”<br />
<br />
Veles’ stared down at his gut as it started to strain the otter’s tunic. There was a clear indent in the fabric where his belly-button was. As he stared, his face rounded out completely, a second chin wobbling from his muzzle, softening his features. He adjusted himself, trying to get comfortable as his rump grew big and wide.<br />
<br />
Amicus slurped and sucked, licking the red-hot tip of the fox’s cockhead where it poked out of his groin. His belly continued swelling until his formerly baggy tunic was stretched taut, the fabric creaking softly. The fox’s big belly lopped heavily over his belt. Veles was surprised to find that Amicus’ tunic fit his saggy fox gut just as well as it did an overly-bloated otter belly. <br />
<br />
As his changes slowed to a halt, Veles couldn’t help but chuckle. There was no way he’d be able to pretend to be slim now! Veles leaned to the side as much as he could, admiring his new form in the mirror while Amicus opened his maw wide and slide his long tongue around the head of Veles’ cock. <br />
<br />
Veles ran a paw over the vast expanse of his gut, enjoying how it wobbled, and happily gyrated his hips. His dick rubbed the walls of the otter’s hungry mouth. Amicus deepthroated Veles’ shaft, swallowing the burps of precum, then slowly bobbed back up again.<br />
<br />
The fox lay back onto their bed contentedly, absentmindedly closing the Backstory hologram and dismissing the spell. He stopped worrying about screwing up his spell and just let Amicus take charge. Amicus’ tender ministrations were so nice and pleasant that orgasm crept up on the fox unnoticed.<br />
<br />
He gasped and came, seed splattering across his lover’s muzzle.<br />
<br />
“Oh! I’m sorry, babe,” Veles said.<br />
<br />
The otter giggled, tongue lapping around his mouth, slurping up the jism.  <br />
<br />
“It’s okay. I’m good with my mouth,” Amicus winked.<br />
<br />
“How good are you with your cock?” Veles smirked.<br />
<br />
The fox rolled over, his belly forcing his ample rump into the air. He waved his tail enticingly and pushed his plump rump towards Amicus’ crotch. Amicus eyed him appreciatively and tugged Veles’ trousers down, exposing his wide rear and the little pucker nestled between the fox’s cheeks.<br />
<br />
Amicus tugged his own trousers down, exposing his tapered pink lutrine cock. He reached forward with a grin and grabbed a fistful of ass flesh in both webbed paws and spread Veles’ cheeks apart. Veles heard the squelch of lube being squeezed into a paw before the otter lathered his cock and then rubbed the cool gel deep inside Veles’ entrance.<br />
<br />
Veles felt a soft weight settle on the small of his back as Amicus used him as a belly shelf. The otter rubbed his cock up and down the fox’s well-lubed ass crack before his dick found Veles’ ring. With a smooth, well-practiced motion, he bucked and slid the tip in. Veles moaned like a needy whore and found himself pressing back into his boyfriend until Amicus bottomed out, his otter low-hangers slapping the fox’s furry cheeks with a soft *pap*.<br />
<br />
Amicus groaned as Veles’ clenched and squeezed his ass around the otter’s thick lutrine dick. It was like the fox&#39;s ass was made for his cock, and the otter found himself shivering in delight. Actually, it was the other way around, of course, as the simulation made him Veles’ perfect boyfriend, but that was irrelevant.<br />
<br />
With a grunt, Amicus started thrusting.<br />
<br />
It felt so good, ripples spreading across the fox’s form with every buck and roll of the otter’s hips. Veles rocked into each thrust, enjoying the otter’s lovely cock as it slid between his cheeks. The otter gripped the fox’s love-handles for support as he claimed Veles’ rear.<br />
<br />
“Oh,” Veles groaned.<br />
<br />
He hadn’t been sure if the otter’s dick was big enough to hit his prostate. But somehow the otter managed to grind his pink lutrine cock into Veles and score direct hits on his g-spot. As a growing pressure in his balls and a pleasant and growing warmth enveloped his hole, Veles&#39; whole body jiggled – his own rolls of fat running over themselves like a full-body massage. Overwhelmed by the feeling of his entire body in an uncontrollable motion, all he could do was thrust back into the fuck, moaning happily.<br />
<br />
“Nice and full, sweetie?” Amicus said, bending over and nibbling the fox’s ear.<br />
<br />
Veles could do nothing but moan and nod.<br />
<br />
He felt so nice and full, his belly gurgling the sweet pies. Above him, Amicus continued to thrust. He wouldn’t stop until Veles came. It was so big and stretched Veles so nicely. It smacked his prostate, making the fox grit his teeth as pleasure roiled through his clenching hole. He couldn’t stop the otter now if he wanted, the big, soft belly pinning him to the bed.<br />
<br />
It was too much, he couldn’t hold on-<br />
<br />
Veles let out a soft cry and shot his load directly onto the sheets. His asshole spasmed, and Amicus grunted and came too. The lutrine cock spat hot ropey ribbons of sperm into Veles’ needy hole. They stayed that way for a moment, basking in the afterglow, before the otter pulled out with a squelch. <br />
<br />
“How do you feel?” Amicus asked, hugging the fat fox to his flabby chest.<br />
<br />
“Well-fed and well-bred,” Veles smiled and kissed his boyfriend.<br />
<br />
They cuddled in each other’s soft embrace and fell asleep for an hour.</p>
