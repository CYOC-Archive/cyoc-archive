<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After Aloe&#39;la and Sarah&#39;s night, the two of them got woke up with Aloe&#39;la stretching her arms and looking at Sarah as she brushed a little hair away from her face and kissed her on the cheek, this stirred Sarah awake.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? What? Oh my god, come on, we need to get dressed. We&#39;ve got to see the Queen this morning.&quot; Sarah said as she immediately went to get dressed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? Is that all you&#39;ve got to say? You don&#39;t want to say anything about last night?&quot; Aloe&#39;la asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Oh, look we can talk about it later, but right now, we&#39;ve got important matters to attend to.&quot; Sarah said as she looked to find something to dress up in a three piece suit.<br />
<br />
Aloe&#39;la felt a little hurt that Sarah didn&#39;t want to talk about last night but got dressed as well. She wanted to say something to her, but she didn&#39;t know what. She looked to Sarah and she still saw her as she had first seen her...as a goddess, in a suit or a dress, she thought Sarah looked beautiful to her.<br />
<br />
The two of them now headed out of their private room to the throne room to finally meet with Queen Glitter. Sarah was a little nervous about meeting the queen, but it couldn&#39;t be any different than how she had met other royalties in familiar circles like the vampires.<br />
<br />
Sarah would definitely had said she was very awed by Queen Glitter&#39;s beauty as she approached the throne room. Queen Glitter looked a little familiar to her with her long sandy brown hair and purple eyes, but she couldn&#39;t have met her before. She noticed as she was coming in that she was talking to a male fairy, it was probably of her many servants in the fairy army that Aloe&#39;la had told her about.<br />
<br />
&quot;Announcing Aloe&#39;la with Director Sarah McMillan of S.P.E.A.R!&quot; Proclaimed a nearby fairy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, finally welcome back home Aloe&#39;la and welcome Director Sarah Mc.....&quot; Queen Glitter suddenly stopped when she looked down at the two of them, she seemed to be looking at Sarah directly. Aloe&#39;la can definitely say that this was the first time in a long time that Queen Glitter was left speechless at someone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your highness? My Queen?&quot; Aloe&#39;la tried to get a reaction from Glitter who was still looking at Sarah McMillan with her mouth agape.<br />
<br />
Finally, Aloe&#39;la flew closer to the queen and snapped her fingers, snapping her out of her trance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wh-What? Oh, Aloe&#39;la, I&#39;m terribly sorry, my mind was....somewhere else. Now, I&#39;d like both you and Director McMillan to accompany me to my quarters for a....private conversation.&quot; Queen Glitter said as she stood up first and motioned for the two to follow her.<br />
<br />
Aloe&#39;la was definitely surprised by this as she and Sarah spoke quietly to each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s going on? Why does she want to speak privately?&quot; Sarah asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I...I really don&#39;t know?&quot; Aloe&#39;la answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Could it be because....because we had sex? Do you think she saw that....glow in either of us?&quot; Sarah asked as Aloe&#39;la blushed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I felt a glow, I don&#39;t know how you felt about it.&quot; Aloe&#39;la said almost dismissively.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was....nice.&quot; Sarah said quietly still unsure what she could really think about herself and Aloe&#39;la right now there were more important matters to think about than her personal life.<br />
<br />
Queen Glitter brought the two of them to her personal chambers, it was very beautiful and quite elegant, Sarah thought it looked like something out of a fantasy cartoon she might have seen years ago. The two of them noticed Glitter locking the doors behind her and then went to her balcony doors and closed them and locked them as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;What I&#39;m about to share with you two, I&#39;ve never shared before. Aloe&#39;la, I&#39;ve told you and others that I have one living heir in the human world.&quot; Queen Glitter began.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, you&#39;ve told myself and others countless times that you have a granddaughter living in the human world with a couple of friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t have a granddaughter, that was a lie I told myself and others for years to protect my real and only living heir, my daughter. I haven&#39;t seen her in many years, and I didn&#39;t think I would ever see her again.&quot; Glitter said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? You&#39;ve told us all about her friends, Jon and Tyler and her other friend that she sees more as like a sort of rival...&quot; Aloe&#39;la didn&#39;t notice that Sarah&#39;s face perked up a little bit when she mentioned the two names.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think her name was...Annalise, no, much shorter than that....uh...Ann or...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Annie?&quot; Sarah suggested.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, that was it.&quot; Aloe&#39;la agreed. &quot;Anyway, I can&#39;t think if I&#39;ve seen your granddaughter, Thea in a while, but....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You have. It&#39;s me.&quot; Sarah answered as Aloe&#39;la looked at her confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s my name, Sarah Thea McMillan. Your highness, you can&#39;t really be telling me that you&#39;re supposed to be....&quot; Sarah asked as Glitter nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your mother, and you are my daughter, and only living heir, Sarah.&quot; Glitter replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I came to discuss alliance matters, but if you&#39;re going to bullshit me right to my face, I&#39;m out of here.&quot; Sarah said as she stood up and tried to find how to unlock the doors.<br />
<br />
&quot;Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high, there&#39;s a land that I heard of once in a lullaby.&quot; Glitter sung sweetly as Sarah stopped what she was doing and slowly turned around to look at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;The...the way you sung that. I asked my mother to sing me that song countless times to hear it, and it never sounded quite right to me. It&#39;s because I remembered how you sung it. I remember your voice when I was little.&quot; Sarah said recalling her earliest memories.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, it was my personal favorite song to sing. Now please sit down and I&#39;ll tell you the story I&#39;ve kept secret for so may years.&quot; Glitter asked as Sarah sat down next to Aloe&#39;la who also wanted to hear this.<br />
<br />
&quot;My story with humans began both before and after me. I had a human ancestor and during the late 60s or maybe even early 70s, some teenagers stumbled upon the fairy realm due to the recklessness of an evil scientist. I helped those teenagers return home, but what I never told anyone was that I went to the human world for myself for a time to visit them.&quot; Glitter began as Aloe&#39;la and Glitter had a little idea of where the story might be headed as Glitter continued her story.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was only a few years later, but the friendship I made with those humans was a personal bond. I just didn&#39;t know how personal it was going to get. Out of all of them, I grew the closest with two of them in particular, a handsome young man named Jon Tyler, and Annie. Annie and I became like sisters after a time, while Jon....well, I didn&#39;t think it could have ever happened, but Jon was the human I fell in love with. We never danced, if that&#39;s what you want to know, but he took me one night to see the Wizard of Oz at a drive in theater. It was from that movie that I adopted my human nickname, Gale.&quot; Glitter said as Sarah gasped a little bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just please wait, until I&#39;m completely done. I didn&#39;t think it was possible, but Jon was the man who was going to be the father of my child. I lived with them for over a year before my baby finally came. I had wanted to name her &#39;Thea&#39;, but Jon was more partial to the name...Sarah, so we compromised and named her Sarah Thea McMillan. Yes, Sarah, you were the baby I had all those years ago.&quot; Glitter finally admitted.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I don&#39;t....I can&#39;t believe this, I don&#39;t have wings and I certainly don&#39;t recall ever seeing any pictures of you around the house when I was little.&quot; Sarah argued as Glitter nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s a reason for that. We waited to see if you showed any signs of fairy anatomy or anything, but nothing ever came. Finally I decided it was time to go back to ruling my kingdom, I had left the court in charge while I was gone and knew it was time to my people. Before I left I asked Jon and Annie to raise you as their daughter. Before I left, they did insist I take one thing back with me, a picture of the four of us together, my two best friends and my baby daughter at only one year old.&quot; Glitter said as she pulled out from her dress an old polaroid picture of Glitter with amazingly Sarah&#39;s parents.<br />
<br />
&quot;Those are....they are my parents, and that&#39;s me, but that....that really is....&quot; Sarah tried to say but couldn&#39;t get the words out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me. Sarah, please understand that I wanted you to grow up happy and have a normal life. I never expected you to get wrapped up in all of this. I&#39;m just happy you had two loving parents to care for you and it warms my heart to see you here and now, so grown up, so beautiful. You have your father&#39;s eyes.&quot; Glitter said trying not to cry.<br />
<br />
&quot;My...my father&#39;s last word he said before he died was: Gale. I thought he was just thinking of the Wizard of Oz, but he was thinking of you in his last moments.&quot; Sarah said recalling her father&#39;s death.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait!&quot; Aloe&#39;la suddenly shot up to her feet as the two of them looked at her. &quot;So you mean, Sarah is your real long lost daughter? So that means that she and I.....oh my god, I had sex with my queen&#39;s daughter...&quot; Aloe&#39;la said as she fainted from the shock backwards on the bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh dear, we should probably help her up.&quot; Glitter suggested.<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;ll be fine, and....and the alliance talk can wait. I have another question for you first.&quot; Sarah said as Glitter looked at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell me more about my father? I can tell you more about him after you left.&quot; Sarah suggested.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d love to.&quot; Glitter said as the two of them went to sit at a table while Aloe&#39;la lay passed out on the bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Before we begin though, I&#39;d like to say that what I&#39;ve told you, cannot at this time leave this room. I kept this secret for a reason as I&#39;m sure you understand, Sarah.&quot; Queen Glitter asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;After everything that I&#39;ve witnessed in the last year or two, I understand....mom.&quot; Sarah said as it felt a little weird to call the queen that but in her heart, it felt right. Glitter gently put her hand on Sarah&#39;s hand as the two of them began talking to each other.<br />
<br />
It was a while before talks shifted back to talks of alliances, what Glitter and Sarah wanted to do right now was talk to each other as mother and daughter.</p>
