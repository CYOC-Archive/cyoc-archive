<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">His own mother and sister, well they weren&#39;t related to him anymore. But he still remembered them. They looked the same as they had the last time he&#39;d seen them but since he didn&#39;t they probably wouldn&#39;t remember him. Joe&#39;s mother, Eve, was 35 and looked how you&#39;d expect, thin with average curves and average looks. Her hair was brown and reached her shoulders. She was wearing a blue blouse and a pair of sweatpants. She didn&#39;t wear any jewellery or any accessories except for a pair of glasses which she was almost blind without. His twin sister, Anna, looked more like a boy than a girl. Her hair was short and boyish, the same shade of brown his had been the day before. And her face looked innocent as it was that of a young boys but was recognisably female.  Her figure however was more like Sarah&#39;s, an hourglass shape but smaller than Sarah&#39;s and less defined. She was wearing a white t-shirt and a button down cardigan. She was also wearing a black skirt and a pair of leggings. That held her skinny legs tightly. She was also wearing a pair of black converse and a large pair of glasses that covered her green eyes.<br />
<br />
They came down and sat with them. They both acted like they had never met Joe before but Eve explained to him that she knew Sarah from work and brought Anna so he would have a friend. To which Anna sighed, which showed Joe this wasn&#39;t her choice to come here. Sarah suggested he went and played with the other children. So he spent the next two and a half hours playing tag with a group of children he had never met before like any kid would do. He only stopped because Sarah called him over to get something to eat. He went over and was given a cheese and ham sandwich and a bottle of water. Both Anna and Eve had gone to the bathroom when he was finished. He needed to go himself, in fact he had needed to go when he was playing but forgotten about it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Can I go to the bathroom?&quot; he asked Sarah.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, honey. Just wait a minute though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Erm.. Why?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well I have to go with you, you&#39;re far too young to go by yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay then.&quot; They walked towards the toilet building, Joe trying hard not to wet himself. They got to the bathrooms and Sarah began walking into the ladies bathroom. She turned back and called for Joe.<br />
<br />
&quot;But that&#39;s the girls room&quot;, he exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I cant go in the men&#39;s room can I.&quot; Joe didn&#39;t want to embarrass himself and asked if he could go into the men&#39;s room by himself. He got the same reply as earlier, &quot;You&#39;re far too young to go by yourself.&quot; Joe couldn&#39;t wait any longer and decided to just wet his pants. Sarah noticed this and told him she didn&#39;t bring any spare clothes for him so they would have to go home. They waited for Anna and Eve to come out so Sarah could tell them they were leaving. Eve suggested that her and Anna went back to their house as well. Sarah agreed and ten minutes later they were back home with Eve and Anna visiting.<br />
<br />
The first thing Sarah did was get Joe a fresh pair of shorts but instead of underwear she gave him something he didn&#39;t expect. A pull-up. She told him that she didn&#39;t want a repeat of earlier. He ended up putting it on with Sarah&#39;s help and they went downstairs. <br />
<br />
The rest of the day went by fairly uneventfully. They didn&#39;t go anywhere or do anything interesting. Eve, Anna and Sarah spent most of the day gossiping and Joe just watched TV by himself for a while. He found himself watching cartoons instead of what he would normally watch. It was only when Sarah came in the room to tell him it was time for bed that something eventful happened. For a start he found out that, Eve and Anna would be staying overnight but secondly when Sarah was helping him into his pyjamas did she find that his pull-up was soaked. She sighed she took it off of him and got him something even worse, a diaper. She told him that if he stayed dry through the night she would let him wear pull-ups again. He put on a pair of pyjamas and got into bed. Sarah brushed his hair back and kissed him on the forehead. She turned off the light and went out of the room. Joe lay awake for a while. He looked over at the clock. It was only eight thirty but he felt so tired. It was not long before he drifted off into sleep.<br />
<br />
He awoke the next morning but something was different.</p>
