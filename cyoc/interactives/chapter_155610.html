<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ever since she started studying for her law career, Sylvia had a fantasy she often thought about. She imagined becoming the personal attorney of a Texas oil baron who value her skill and competence over her one leg. Eventually, they would become close enough that he&#39;d propose to her. It was a little fantasy, nothing she really expected to happen. After becoming a rattlesnake Animalian, she wondered how likely that fantasy would come true. After all, Jill meeting Beauregard was quite similar to her own fantasy.<br />
<br />
Now it looked like that fantasy was starting to come true, though in an unexpected way. She did meet Andrew Weary through work, but she hadn&#39;t expected it to be clearing him of murder charges. Not that Andrew seemed like a bad man, asides from being innocent. He was certainly not shy about showing his gratitude, such as inviting Sylvia to Thanksgiving dinner. Sylvia didn&#39;t want to impose, but Andrew was so insistent.<br />
<br />
There was a little bit of moroseness at the dinner table, though Sylvia was pretty sure it was because of the recent departure of Andrew&#39;s father. In the rush of clearing his name of double-homicide, it was easy to forget that Andrew had lost his father. But the rest of Andrew&#39;s family seemed accommodating to Sylvia.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tommy has told us quite a lot about you,&quot; said Tommy&#39;s mother, &quot;You&#39;ve become a bit of a hero in our household.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was mostly Tommy that did it,&quot; said Sylvia modestly, &quot;I just got the legal permission to look for the journal. It&#39;s not like I saved Andrew&#39;s life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You saved him from a life sentence,&quot; said Tommy&#39;s father, &quot;Not to mention having been branded as killing poor Roosevelt.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I still can&#39;t believe Paulina was so cold-blooded enough to kill him and try to frame Andrew,&quot; said Tommy&#39;s mother before adding hastily, &quot;No offense.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;None taken,&quot; said Sylvia, &quot;I&#39;m not fully cold-blooded, though I don&#39;t like the cold at all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which makes me wonder, what do you do during winter?&quot; asked Andrew, &quot;I don&#39;t suppose you hibernate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For reptiles, the correct term is &#39;bruminate&#39;,&quot; said Sylvia, &quot;but I don&#39;t do that. Last year, I spent my Christmas break in Egypt. My friend offered me to stay at her place on Heiya Island this Christmas break.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Heiya Island. Sounds like a lovely tropical getaway,&quot; said Tommy&#39;s father.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re thinking of Mieni Atoll,&quot; said Sylvia, &quot;Heiya Island is a temperate island. They have winter there, but they also have hot springs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It does sound like an interesting place,&quot; said Andrew, &quot;I&#39;d like to go there some time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Go with her now so you guys can start dating,&quot; said Tommy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tommy, you shouldn&#39;t rush them,&quot; said his mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not my choice for spending the holidays, but the young people these days have different ideas,&quot; said his father.<br />
<br />
Sylvia noticed neither of them said anything against her and Andrew dating. She wasn&#39;t going to presume he was that interested in her or push her friendship with Muxing to allow Andrew to come with her. But it did make her feel pretty warm inside.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Annie found quite a bit to be thankful for this year. She not only had her good health back, but she had a loving husband. Granted, she never thought she&#39;d ever end up with a husband before. She had prided herself as a lesbian before, so it made her feel a little bit like a hypocrite. But then again, her old friends were so happy for her she couldn&#39;t really feel that guilty. Not to mention Stuart was a wonderful mate.<br />
<br />
She and Stuart were having Thanksgiving Dinner in the Great Hall, discussing that seemed rather out of place for the festivities. &quot;We&#39;ve done foursomes before, you know,&quot; said Annie, &quot;It&#39;s not like we&#39;re planning on breeding together.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They haven&#39;t even been converted yet,&quot; said Stuart, &quot;They only just came here from Italy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I know they&#39;re going to make some sexy cattle,&quot; said Annie.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, I heard a rumor they&#39;re going to try for that herm option,&quot; said Stuart.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, that&#39;s why I&#39;m interested,&quot; said Annie.<br />
<br />
Stuart snorted and said, &quot;You have a twisted mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
Annie smiled and said, &quot;That&#39;s what you love about me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just then, they heard a throat being cleared. They turned, mildly surprised to see Officer Shelly. &quot;I hope I&#39;m not interrupting anything,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing that can&#39;t wait,&quot; said Stuart, &quot;Is something wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we&#39;ve received some news that may be of interest to you,&quot; said Shelly, &quot;Annie, you remember the &#39;Jezzie&#39; you met several months ago?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s hard to forget,&quot; said Annie dourly. The woman who called herself &#39;Jezzie&#39; had managed to gain her trust and confidence, only to infect Annie with HIV.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we&#39;ve recently learned that she had been found,&quot; said Shelly.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?!&quot; asked Annie loudly, causing people at other tables to turn around. Annie lowered her voice and asked, &quot;You found her?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, not us here in Lyre,&quot; said Shelly, &quot;But you have friends who have been looking for this, what was that name they used? Oh yes, &#39;Destroying Angel&#39; for some time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t ask them to,&quot; said Annie, &quot;I was willing to let it go.&quot; True, &#39;Jezzie&#39; deliberately infected her with HIV, but Annie had a strong hunch that she was suffering from a lot of self-loathing, stemming from bible-thumping parents who demonized lesbians.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, she made herself easy to find,&quot; said Shelly, &quot;Evidently, the last lesbian she tried to infect wasn&#39;t so easy to sway. She attempted to assault her, but she underestimate her target and ended up being subdued and was arrested. She seems to match the description your friends were giving of her, but you might be asked to come and identify her yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Annie felt a sudden chill. It was one thing to forgive &#39;Jezzie&#39;. After all, if she never infected Annie with HIV, she wouldn&#39;t have come to Animalia and found Stuart. But seeing her again was something she didn&#39;t feel comfortable about. &quot;What are they going to do with her?&quot; asked Annie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, she&#39;d be facing prison time for assault,&quot; said Shelly, &quot;There may be some discussion about converting her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it would cure her HIV and make her bisexual, which would probably agree with her,&quot; said Stuart.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not so sure that&#39;s a good idea,&quot; said Annie, &quot;She seems pretty unstable to me. If she&#39;s been raised to think homosexuality is a perverse sin, what would she think about bestiality?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not bestiality for us,&quot; said Stuart indignantly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, but would she see it that way?&quot; asked Annie, &quot;I don&#39;t think she&#39;d be able to pass psychiatric evaluation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not as she is,&quot; said Shelly, &quot;But people can change, not just on the outside. You may not even have to identify her in person.&quot;<br />
<br />
Annie sighed and said, &quot;Ok, but I&#39;m not sure she&#39;d be welcomed in Animalia so easily. That could...backfire horribly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I fully understand,&quot; said Shelly, &quot;Enjoy the rest of your meal.&quot; With that she walked away.<br />
<br />
Annie sighed and said, &quot;I might have lost my appetite.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, if you aren&#39;t going to finish...&quot; said Stuart, dragging her plate towards him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, it just came back,&quot; said Annie, dragging her plate back.</p>
