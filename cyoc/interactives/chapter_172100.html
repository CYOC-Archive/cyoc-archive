<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Some things progressed normally as they always did. The present pandemic and a desperate President trying to argue that he&#39;d solved the problem were problems in their own right, and at the Bowman farm knew it. It raised some worries with regard to Nate at the University of Wisconsin. From phone calls and emails that he&#39;d sent back to his father and stepmother, things had gone fairly well, which was good, but that didn&#39;t change the bigger picture. A couple of Ulysses&#39; neighbors had contracted Covid at some backyard barbeques and related events, and now as things began moving toward winter, things began to get worse. Ulysses and Blueberry did their best to stay safe avoid exposure for themselves the others associated with the farm, but as August moved into September and then into October, some of those measures weren&#39;t perfect, particularly when some of the neighbors didn&#39;t take the same precautions.<br />
<br />
It came as a shock when Gooseberry contracted it from one of the neighbors while helping with some maintenance issues there, which Ulysses thought was either a fencing issue or something related to it. Gooseberry seemed to recover just fine, but she also spent the month of September in self imposed isolation in her own home and from what she said over the phone, cleaning all surfaces almost repeatedly. It was something that left everyone hopeful for a vaccine for Animalians and for Humans could be made safely, but nervous and worried because of the overall situation... and even to a degree frustrated. Though some of that frustration came from the fact that there were somethings that couldn&#39;t be avoided, regardless of what people did. That related to fact that as fall hit, Ulysses could tell that the normal Brown Swiss Cattle he raised were coming into season and as were the Animalians that lived on the farm.<br />
<br />
The mundane cattle were easy to deal with, in a way. Unlike most large diary farms that did things more artificially, Ulysses and many of the farmers around him worked with a more natural way of breeding the cattle they raised. A few of Ulysses neighbors had Brown Swiss Cattle, but they only had the bulls and would use them to breed with those in the area that had the cows, like Ulysses. Male calves would then be sold to breeder and females would be registered and kept with their respective herds. They would only be sold if there ended up being more cattle on the farm than what the farm could sustain. It often kept Ulysses busy with record keeping, but it was something that worked and he wasn&#39;t about to stop with that practice.<br />
<br />
&quot;I must say you got to me earlier than you usually do with this...&quot; said Ulysses&#39; contact as he opened the gate on his trailer, letting the Brown Swiss bull slowly clamber out of the trailer, sniffing casually and with his ears alert to some of the soft &quot;moos&quot; coming from pasture beyond.<br />
<br />
&quot;One of the perks of being an Animalian, Smith,&quot; Ulysses said to the man and doing his best to make sure that Smith didn&#39;t pay much attention to the tent his own bull-hood was making in his pants. Blueberry had started smelling very good, in addition to looking beautiful to him, and that was had alert to the fact that she was coming into heat. The mundane cows on the Bowman farm also carried a similar scent, and now with Ulysses as a Brown Swiss Bull Animalian, the mundane cows began to take some interest in him as well which lead to him making the call to bring over mundane bull and handle the required breeding that would allow his cows to keep producing milk.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you and Blueberry?&quot; Smith asked, well aware on some of the updates and changes that had happened with the Bowman farm.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re hoping for calves of our own, too,&quot; Ulysses nodded, &quot;give Nate some siblings... and let him have his happy ever after when he gets through college.&quot;<br />
<br />
Smith nodded and the two men watched as the bull made his way into the pasture and got far enough away from the gate that Ulysses was able to squeeze himself between the trailer and the fence post to reach the heavy metal gate and then pull it shut. He fixed the latch that would leave the bull to his business and wouldn&#39;t be getting out and doing damage to the rest of the farm. From there he managed to get out of the way so that Smith could shut the trailer door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay... we&#39;ll handle this as fairly standard,&quot; Smith said, &quot;I&#39;ll be back in a couple of weeks... I&#39;d imagine that Braun would have gotten his work done by then and we can handle the stud fee at that time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Ulysses answered with a nod.<br />
<br />
&quot;And good luck with Blueberry,&quot; Smith than gave Ulysses a wink before heading to the driver&#39;s side door of truck.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Ulysses followed Smith&#39;s truck back as far as the house, mostly to make sure he didn&#39;t scrape against fences or some of the smaller homes that had been build for some of the other uplifted cows that hadn&#39;t moved into apartments in town. Once that was done safely, Ulysses then made his way inside. For the moment things were quiet, but there was a familiar scent that served to catch his attention and regardless of all the other worries in the world and the coming issues that related to Halloween, held his attention.  The bellowing &quot;moos&quot; that came from the pastures was a sign of the bull that had been dropped off doing his work and reminded Ulysses of the purpose of that scent. He looked up to see Blueberry standing there by kitchen doorway in the blue lingerie that he remembered seeing her wearing when he first became an Animalian to be with her.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re looking very good, today,&quot; Ulysses said softly to her as he approached.<br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed I am,&quot; Blueberry replied with a wide smile, &quot;and Smith&#39;s bull has gone to work, I hear.&quot;<br />
<br />
Blueberry could hear the &quot;moos&quot; carrying on the wind just as anyone else could, and part of this was why most of the farms were kept outside the city limits of the town the Bowman farm was near. She could remember for certain if she&#39;d ever been bred by this particular bull in the past, but she was familiar with how the Bowman farm had operated how its cows were breed. There were some times where she wondered where her calves that she had carried in the past, but she was certain that they were likely well cared for and that now as an Animalian, she&#39;d get to have a family in the way that a mundane cow wouldn&#39;t get. And at present, that was what Blueberry wanted and she wasn&#39;t going to let that moment pass.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... and he&#39;ll be busy for a week or so before he&#39;s done,&quot; Ulysses answered as Blueberry approached him, &quot;and Ollie and Meryl are out with their job... the girls have volunteered to handle some of the other work on the grounds... leaving your bull to get to his work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that would be?&quot; Blueberry said playfully as she began undoing some of the buttons on Ulysses shirt.<br />
<br />
Ulysses wrapped his arms around her as she continued to unbutton his shirt and pulled Blueberry into a firm hug. He could tell she was aroused not just by scent but by touch as her nipples were firmly erect and pushing hard against the top of the lingerie she was wearing and as they came close, Ulysses could feel them poking against his own chest. He was also fairly certain that Blueberry could also tell how aroused he was by how much his penis was presently tenting his pants. That didn&#39;t matter as gave her the most passionate kiss he could manage.<br />
<br />
&quot;Making his wife very happy,&quot; Ulysses said to Blueberry as they came up for air, &quot;and starting a family of our own.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That does make me happy,&quot; Blueberry smiled back as her hands moved down to Ulysses&#39; pants and began working that button and then the zipper, &quot;Let&#39;s go to bed... and get started.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Blueberry then turned and began to walk back through the house and Ulysses slowly followed, working to finish what Blueberry had started with regard to removing his clothing. It lead to a bit of hopping as he moved up the stairs and he heard Blueberry giggle a bit at that, but as he entered their bedroom, he was in a state that drove a lot of the instinctual drive to mate forward, particularly as his clear erection stood at full attention before Blueberry as she looked to him. He dropped his clothes onto the floor and approached Blueberry as she waited for him, smiling. As they reached each other, more kisses and nuzzles followed as Ulysses guided Blueberry onto the bed they shared together.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you,&quot; Ulysses said to her as they kissed and began to massage Blueberry&#39;s right breast with one hand while moving to place his other hand where it could massage her vaginal lips as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you too,&quot; Blueberry moaned back as her panties soon slid down to the floor and her bra was lifted up over her breasts and nipples. She slipped out of them and let Ulysses toss them to the floor as they climbed onto the bed, &quot;a kind man who raised a wonderful son on his own and deserved more than he got... I hope... I hope I can be what you&#39;ve always deserved.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ulysses kissed her as best he could, not easy given that a bovine&#39;s muzzle was not designed for Human kissing, and then nuzzled his muzzle to hers. This soon turned into kisses that trailed down Blueberry&#39;s neck and toward her breasts as he tried to show his romantic affection and acknowledge that he knew that his wife was in heat and that both did want a family of their own. For in many ways, Blueberry was far better to him than Nate&#39;s mother had been, and a part of him never understood why she would carry Nate to term and then leave him and leave Nate with him. But Blueberry had never shown anything like that and remembering the farm and his determination to hold onto it was more than willing to help with the work to keep it. It was something that as he got to know Blueberry after she was uplifted and then learned that she had some interest in him, the more he came to love her.  It made him glad Animalia existed and glad that he could be a part of it.<br />
<br />
&quot;There are times that you are more than I deserve,&quot; Ulysses said to him as he began to ease his large erection into Blueberry&#39;s wet opening, eliciting a soft &quot;moo&quot; from her as he entered her, &quot;and that&#39;s why I love you...&quot;<br />
<br />
Blueberry responded to Ulysses thrusting into her by thrusting forward her own hips forward and moaning heavily as she did so. It made her breasts bounce a bit and Ulysses carefully moved to suckle on her nipples and that served to increase the pleasure she felt as he thrust his large bovine cock into her. And eventually Ulysses joined her in mooing out his own pleasure as the pair coupled together and with the knowledge of the importance of their present bout of love making being in starting a family. Just as with the mundane bull that had been brought to the farm to impregnate the Bowman farm&#39;s mundane cows, their purpose was to start a family. Unlike the mundane bull, though, Ulysses was rather gentle and soft, despite the muscle he&#39;d put on, both in becoming an Animalian and the workout sessions from when they&#39;d been to Mieni. And Blueberry could know way, for as an Animalian, Ulysses had the conscious knowledge of what love was. Something that no mundane bull would have, and as she felt Ulysses&#39; penis begin to twitch inside her, Blueberry felt overjoyed to have gained the love of a man she remembered as being a good man even before she was uplifted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmmm yeeeeeeeEEEEEEESSSS!&quot; Blueberry moaned out as she climaxed and then felt Ulysses erupt inside her. As he lay down beside her, Blueberry looked to him, &quot;I love you... so much.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I you,&quot; Ulysses answered and nuzzled Blueberry&#39;s nose, &quot;You&#39;ve made me so happy... Made me feel young again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think that&#39;s our respective uplifting and conversions,&quot; Blueberry answered, &quot;but it will give us hope for a family... and it will be a good family.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes...&quot; Ulysses nodded, &quot;I wonder on if it&#39;ll be a boy or a girl...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll have to wait and see,&quot; Blueberry answered, &quot;but we&#39;ll love our calf all the same.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ulysses again nodded, &quot;and our calf will have a loving family around it... you, me, Nate and Shuixing, even if they&#39;re ultimately communicating through skype or something like that... even Ollie and Meryl.&quot;</p>
