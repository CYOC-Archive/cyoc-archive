<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Something had to be done, Harry thought, but he was in no position to do it. Clearly, there was some serious corruption in the park, involving <br />
several people in a position much higher than his own. It might even be the entire company. He had Naomi's word his phone was never <br />
monitored by anyone in upper management, but what did she have to base that on? There was a clear divide within the company between the <br />
huskies, there to maintain a security presence in the park, and those involved in the business side of things. Even under the best of <br />
circumstances, there was something slightly sinister at play there. Not only did he have no real authority to pursue matters of security that high <br />
up, he, and everyone else in his pack, had been given a form specifically tailored to show an almost blind level of loyalty to unaltered humans <br />
when they were present. If he tried to pursue things from this side, he could be dismissed, fired, or possibly even just scolded until his <br />
instincts forced him to drop the matter. The best he could really hope for at this point was for his friends outside the park to really bring down <br />
the hammer and take things to court. With the sort of information Charlotte was compiling, moral outrage would trump what advantage the <br />
company had from its legal team. Of course, the downside to that plan is how much ammunition it would give to those &quot;moral majority&quot; types <br />
who'd been trying to have the park shut down from day one. At the very least, they'd have the entire place shut down for the duration of any <br />
serious investigation. What would happen to everyone? Forced back to human forms by a device whose workings were only known to someone <br />
who was suspected of being on the take from foreign powers? Just sent home as they were? Harry was fairly sure he could work security <br />
anywhere, but some forms just weren't suited to life outside the park. Just a couple days ago there'd been that incident with the rabbit girl <br />
someone found catatonic in a ditch after that whole Lone Wolf incident-<br />
<br />
Harry felt dizzy for a moment as a rather horrific potential connection came to mind. Charlotte had just mentioned transforming &quot;political <br />
dissidents&quot; and criminals into &quot;loyal&quot; huskies and concubines. He thought back to the list Naomi had left him. He'd completely forgotten until <br />
now but that was the same rabbit, wasn't she. The one who'd come to the park to research some hack &quot;documentary&quot; about the possibility of <br />
the park doing exactly the sort of thing he was learning was happening behind the scenes. First off, it was clear everyone owed her an apology, <br />
but the last he'd heard, she had earned a reputation as a bit of a sex addict even by rabbit standards. And then there was Goldie. They didn't <br />
come much more loyal than her. It could be coincidental, but if someone did want to test the effectiveness of pacifying dissidents and <br />
criminals, you couldn't pick much better test subjects than a vocal filmmaker who'd been making waves for weeks before signing up and a <br />
slimeball who'd only just been given a lifetime ban and got caught by a last minute scan. Naomi would be disappointed to hear that one.<br />
<br />
None of this would really suggest someone was spying on their internal reports of course. The rabbit girl was a lot more well known outside the <br />
park than in, and he'd obviously had to send the Lone Wolf's ban up the chain of command to enforce it. Still, at least he couldn't think of any <br />
older oddities that matched up with any of this, so odds were against any of the real sinister elements being reported on stretching back more <br />
than a couple of weeks. At least as far as trial runs went. Of course, now that he was coming to think in such paranoid terms, another point hit <br />
him. The management rep he'd talked to about all this stag stuff that was apparently just the top of the iceberg had told him to his face some <br />
of that dirty money was going into salaries for this latest batch of new huskies. Any given one of them could be some kind of double agent, <br />
keeping tabs on him and furthering some of these crooked plans. Hell, all of them might. The only ones he could really trust were Katie, and <br />
funnily enough, Goldie. He still had his doubts about where her loyalties lied, and if the whole &quot;enhanced loyalty&quot; thing was true, there were <br />
some serious ethical issues there, but at least he had a solid handle on what made her tick... or used to. The &quot;Lone Wolf&quot; had needled him <br />
about bribery, but that was clearly just a head game trying to keep from being ejected. Obviously he'd valued personal freedom over money.<br />
<br />
Harry picked the phone back up. After giving Charlotte his feedback, he'd have to tell her not to call anymore, and any serious meetings would <br />
need to take place outside where there was nowhere to put a microphone.  He might have to let things slide with that stupid tournament the <br />
bucks were holding, but they were pacing it out over several days. He had at least a little time to work with there.<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Harry's timetable overlooked an important point. When real bucks clashed every spring, it wasn't to settle power struggles in a men's club, it <br />
was a display to help them attract a mate. The plan Chad and Vinny had for the bucks who dropped out early wasn't to humiliate them after <br />
everything was over. They wanted their new does watching the rest of the action, at least for the final day where the best of the best were <br />
decided. The thinking was that instinct would win over, just as it had the last time this sort of event had happened in the park. Just as it was <br />
now in fact, for those at least relatively natural does watching from the nearby rocks for the matter. The newly minted does would be <br />
overwhelmed by the desire to mate with the strongest bucks, and as Chad put it, &quot;forget being weak little beta males&quot; letting everyone else <br />
walk off with a &quot;prize.&quot; A few had already been eliminated and marched off for their conversion. The way the agreement they'd signed was <br />
worded, they weren't all exactly sure what they were in store for, and those that knew figured it was just another form of hazing. Spend a <br />
couple days looking like a girl, playing cheerleader for their seniors. They'd faced more humiliation than that before now. Most of the &quot;local&quot; <br />
bucks who'd agreed to enter were still in the running, showing experience did mean something against a physical edge. Those who went down <br />
early from that group however were safe for the time being. They hadn't signed any pledge, but they had agreed to accept the rule of whoever <br />
won. Assuming it was someone from the Stags, that would be another story. Chad, meanwhile, knew exactly what was on the line. He'd started <br />
all this expecting to win, and he wasn't going to let some stupid busted antler stop him.<br />
<br />
To his credit, Chad's injury wasn't necessarily crippling. A wise old buck with years of experience could even turn a thing like that into an <br />
advantage. Charge a bit off center, really throw his shoulder into it. He'd catch his opponent off balance from the side and send him twirling <br />
into the dirt. A wise old buck would almost certainly do something like that, but this was Chad.<br />
<br />
As he charged forward, he simply bent his neck to one side. This left his good antler nice and centered, and even put the points farther ahead <br />
which he figured would give him the advantage of reach. No, wise was not a word that described Chad at all, and despite screams from the <br />
sideline from people with a better grasp of anatomy and physics, he refused to straighten out his neck. This time, it was more than an antler he <br />
broke.<br />
<br />
Further fights were cancelled for the rest of the day, with very little resistance. Katie swore under her breath as the medics loaded Chad onto a <br />
stretcher to rush to the exit. Chad was loud, arrogant, sexist pig, and apparently the one who lead this sideshow, but if the transformation <br />
process didn't happen to be the best cure in the world for a broken neck, he'd be paralyzed for life if not worse thanks to his own stupidity. At <br />
least this meant an early end to crowd control duty. Harry was supposed to be getting another call about this whole mess, and she was all for <br />
leaving early to hunt him down.<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
As the eager doe guided him into her waiting folds, Wally almost gave into trying life from the other side, and if circumstances had been only <br />
slightly different he probably would. As it was, just as they made contact he shoved her away, leaping to his feat, and backing away.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's wrong?&quot; asked Terry with a sly lustful grin. &quot;Did you want to take it a little slower?&quot;<br />
<br />
Wally simply turned and ran, not stopping until the warren was far behind. There was no way that could really have been Terry. The thought he <br />
could really have changed into... THAT in so little time horrified him so much he could almost vomit. He'd come so close to just joining in on <br />
things himself too. What was he supposed to do now? Run off to the exit and demand to change back before the same thing happened to him, <br />
and just abandon that... creature of pure lust that used to be Terry to her fate? Head back in and just physically drag her out with him? Would <br />
the park even allow that without her consent? Terry had signed some papers that would force his release after 60 days were up regardless of <br />
his, or Wally supposed, HER wishes, but so far as an early release went... &quot;And what am I supposed to do about this!&quot; he asked out loud, staring <br />
down at the very obvious indicator of what he'd just barely stopped himself from doing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I could certainly show you,&quot; said Katerina, catching up to put a hand on his shoulder. &quot;But first I think we really need to talk.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Zack hadn't really lied to Goldie, not exactly. No one had officially been reported as &quot;missing&quot; exactly, but there was a she-bear scheduled for <br />
checkout a few days ago that hadn't turned up. Guests missing their checkouts was hardly a rarity, but usually they'd at least give one of the <br />
huskies a heads up so they could have the right forms processed, or there'd be someone to spread gossip of how they'd &quot;eloped&quot; with someone <br />
else. Besides which, bears were a rather unpopular choice, and hard to miss. She was a bit of a loner, apparently, but asking around, he <br />
couldn't find anyone who'd seen her in any reasonable length of time.<br />
<br />
So fine, he had lied, but he had a good reason. Goldie had a very good instinct for this sort of thing. She might have missed her true calling as <br />
a criminal profiler. However, what she also had was a complete lack of hand to hand combat training, and a personal connection here. Everyone <br />
was being extra careful not to let it slip who she used to be, but when someone from your gang gets arrested, and the rest start dropping one <br />
by one without any screw-ups, Zack imagined you would be able to put two and two together. If this Max was as much of a psycho as he was <br />
starting to fear, having Goldie around when he brought him in could lead to some serious complications.<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
The incident had pushed her confusion about Sam out of her mind for the time being, as Goldie made sure the crowd properly dispersed, and <br />
seeing her alone, glancing around for signs of trouble, Brian came over and asked if she had a minute to talk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, don't think we've met. I'm Brian.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is something wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no. Not with me anyway, but I couldn't help but notice the look on your face after that kiss, and I'm the one assigned to talk the regular <br />
guests through this sort of thing. If you need someone to talk to about it, I'm all ears.&quot;<br />
<br />
Goldie blinked in confusion. What was this guy even talking about? Talk about what? What 'kiss' did he mean? &quot;I don't really...&quot; she started.<br />
<br />
Brian had some other people to check in on, and decided to cut to the chase. &quot;Look. Birds and the bees time here. When you come to the park <br />
as a member of the opposite sex, if you started gay, you still are, and if you started off straight, that doesn't change either. Heterosexual. <br />
Attracted to the sex opposite of your body. If you're wondering why it felt right getting kissed by a guy, that's why.&quot;<br />
<br />
Goldie realized what he was talking about. Sam licking her face was an odd thing to do, but that wasn't a KISS. It was just a friendly lick. They <br />
were both part dog, and that was just how dogs showed they liked someone. She'd had the urge to just run up and lick Zack's face several <br />
times, when he'd thanked her for help with something or smiled after she'd done a good job. It gave her the same sort of giddy sensation too. <br />
&quot;No, that was just trying to cheer me up. I'm not really a proper member of the pack so...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, you can deny it all you want, but that there dog was clearly into you, and deep down you know you like him back. When you try and deny <br />
this sort of thing, that gets you in trouble. So I want you to take a deep breath, accept your feelings, decide what you want to do about them, <br />
and this guy where he stands with you. And if you need any more advice, I hold support group meetings every morning not far from the <br />
entrance. Most of the older huskies should know where if you have trouble finding the spot. Can you do that for me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Goldie knew he had to be mistaken, but nodded anyway to escape the conversation. The only feelings involved here were pity, and some <br />
gratefulness to receive it on her part. Her heart did beat a little faster thinking about meeting up with Sam later to talk about things more, but <br />
that was clearly just from all the excitement earlier. And of course if that Brian guy had misread things so badly, she could dismiss all that <br />
other stuff he said about sexuality following your body. Just someone else trying to convince her that 'gender change syndrome' myth Harry'd <br />
try to scare her with was real was all.<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Max tossed the plump squirrel he'd snagged for breakfast up in the air, watching it twirl and panic before catching it again by the tail. Playing <br />
with his food was almost as much fun as playing with his toys. Of course, the way things were looking, he'd have to move on soon enough. <br />
He'd had to abandon his old toys when a plumber had heard them screaming. He'd thought he had plenty of sound proofing down there, but <br />
that pipe he'd chained them to carried sound surprisingly far.<br />
<br />
He twisted his catch around, then grabbed two legs and began to pull. No pipes here, no basements either, and no chains. That's why he only <br />
had the one at the moment. He'd found it in a cave. Plenty of big rocks to hobble it with sitting right there, and a few narrow passages in the <br />
back it just barely fit through to hide it. That wouldn't last forever though, It was a risk bringing it food and water to keep things going, and if it <br />
really had enough determination, it could probably pull itself back through the gaps, at least far enough for sound to carry outside.<br />
<br />
He tossed the squirrel up one more time, this time catching it in his teeth. He should probably finish it off before leaving. Can't have it talking <br />
later, that's where the rookies around here had all slipped up.<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
The huskies laid Chad down in the chamber, and after a bit of discussion over the intercom, agreed to transfer him back off the stretcher and <br />
remove it. This sort of procedure hadn't been done often enough to have a properly established protocol, but it wasn't entirely untested. The <br />
hardest part was sorting out what the final result was going to be, but there was a very clear if rather unusual order for stags coming through <br />
today, and those with this sort of injury preventing them from explaining themselves was actually specifically addressed. Apparently this was <br />
even the guy who'd drafted the agreement.<br />
<br />
The next time Chad came to, she didn't have so much as a crick in her neck, but the realization of what had been done to her left her lying still <br />
on the floor so long the medical huskies had to check her over again before helping her out. Her mind could barely process the indignity of her <br />
situation. She was supposed to stay head of the Stags after all this! Vinny had even said something about keeping an edge! The only reason <br />
she'd gone down was some crazy fluke, or some cheating punk pulling some pressure point garbage! She was just going to march back out <br />
there and demand a proper rematch!<br />
<br />
Chad was too stubborn to acknowledge she didn't even have a pair of antlers anymore to properly compete with, and she was too angry to <br />
consider if her &quot;prize&quot; theory would hold true. The other bucks who'd suffered elimination were rather beside themselves as well when they <br />
finished &quot;accepting the brand of shame&quot; for the rest of their trip as Vinny had put it to them. In there case, the process was decidedly more <br />
voluntary. Better to deal with an embarrassing body for the rest of their stay than be drummed out of the Order after all. Of course, what none <br />
of them, not even Chad could know was that it wasn't just &quot;safety&quot; modifications for the bucks Vinny had successfully lobbied for. Thanks to <br />
how much money he'd greased the right palms with, those being reprocessed as does were to be set up with special &quot;upgrades&quot; too.</p>
