<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After grabbing you from the bathroom, the detention supervisor drags you back into the room. <br />
<br />
“Idiot!,” he yelled, “I figured something was going to happen. Christ, you almost punch the kid for god’s sake. You lucky I ain’t calling security on your rear son!”<br />
<br />
“But… He talk bad ‘bout mah bubba…”<br />
<br />
The supervisor was getting fed up with you. “Go sit down…,” he sighs “, and don’t you think about askin’ for another bathroom break!”<br />
<br />
You overhear everyone giggling at you as you slowly mope back to your seat. <br />
<br />
“Haha! You miss the toilet or something?” laughed one black student.<br />
 <br />
You look down at your crotch and realized you had ejaculated a hefty amount of nut as there was a rather large stain bleeding through your jeans.  <br />
<br />
“You’re fly’s open dumbass!” snicker another black student. <br />
<br />
“Fuck man… Did you even wipe your ass?” moaned another.<br />
<br />
“Damn Coons…” you mumbled as you zip up and sit in your seat. You leer at Lester and see him laughing as well. “Sum’ bud…” you thought. You lay your head down on the table as you think about Cletus. Surely your bubba wouldn’t laugh at you. You wish he was here so the both of you could kick all their asses.<br />
<br />
The laughing was starting to escalate out of control.  “QUIET!” roared the supervisor reducing the abhorrent laughter to mere giggles.<br />
<br />
You begin thinking about that one nigger in the bathroom you wanted to set straight. “He call’m self C.J.”, you remembered. The name did sound strangely familiar. Suddenly an image flashes in your head of him and your previous self having a good time together. You remembered how you always use to invite him over to study, how you graduated middle school together, how the 2 of you always played video games. You clutch your head in pain. <br />
<br />
“C-C.J…” you softly spoke in your old accent as several more images of the 2 of you enter your mind. “Yea-Yeah… C.J’s my-my best… friend. We… We’re-” <br />
<br />
“Friend? Ka’mon [INSERT YOUR NAME HERE], ya knows I’m yer bes’ bud,” interrupts a voice of Cletus. <br />
<br />
“Cl-Clee?” <br />
<br />
“Shh… Jus’ calm yerself.” You imagine being in his arms while he slowly caresses your hair. “That-a-boy. Now, who’s yer bes’ friend?“<br />
<br />
“You are, Clee.”<br />
<br />
“Goooood. Now, who’er the one’s ya hate?”<br />
<br />
“Those monkeys…  Tha’s right!  I shure as hale ain’t friends wit no filthee jig’boo!”<br />
<br />
And just like that, the memories of C.J. and you instantly shatter and disappear within your head.  In their replacement come memories of Cletus and you singing your hearts out while listening to old bluegrass, memories of the 2 of you going hunting in the woods, memories of cuddling against each other on the couch while watching T.V. Yes, Cletus has always been your one and only. Your member stiffens at the thought. In spite of this, you began to slowly doze off. <br />
<br />
****<br />
<br />
As you continue to sleep, the 1st Lunch bell goes off. As C.J. and his friends get in line, they notice the sad face engraved on their friend.<br />
<br />
“Dude, you feelin’ alright?”, asks the student on the right, “You’ve been down ever since last class.”<br />
<br />
“I’m fine…” replies C.J.<br />
<br />
“Hmm, whatever… If something’s on your mind, you know who to turn too alright?”<br />
<br />
C.J. glances at the student on the right before he turns his head again. “Yeah, thanks.” He notices Cletus and his goons making a fuss at the other side of the cafeteria. “Hey, guys. I’ll be right back.”<br />
<br />
“Um, sure alright…”<br />
<br />
“There has to be some sort of connection between Cletus and [INSERT YOUR NAME HERE],” he thought as he walks towards and sits down at an open seat close to the bunch. He lays his head down on the table, closes his eyes, and focuses his hearing towards the group.<br />
<br />
“Yep, they both’s n detenshun,” said one of the Rednecks, “Lester messagin mahself sayin’ his folks comin’ to pick him up.”<br />
<br />
“I tell ya, Clee-man, whycha hav’ to bring that feller he’ah.” says another one.<br />
<br />
Cletus crosses his arms. “Tch… Might as well. ‘Specially since it’ll be’s his last day her’.”<br />
<br />
“Heh, last day? Yous really hav’ sumthin’ planned for dat’ dair wannabee huh?”<br />
<br />
Cletus replies with an angry leer and slams his palm on the table. “Hey! You bes’ watch yer tongue boy!”<br />
<br />
Completely dumbfounded, all the others glare at each other in disbelief. “*Whistle* Damn, I ain’t evah see Clee-man dis seirus.”<br />
<br />
“Jew dern, right I am!” He says as he scratches his goatee “To tale ya tha truth’s though, I’m still kinda nervous this all’s happenin’.<br />
<br />
“Why [INSERT YOUR NAME HERE] dough? Was so speshul ‘bout him?”<br />
<br />
“Hmm. Dat’s fer mahself to know an’ you to nevah ask.”<br />
<br />
C.J. heard enough. Cletus and you really do have a connection; all it took was to hear your name ushered out one time. Since there was no longer a need to be here, C.J. raises his head and attempts to get up; however, he is met by a large redneck as he turns around.“Hey Coon, you’s in mah seat.”<br />
<br />
“Um... well, uh… He-here..,” he whimpers.<br />
<br />
“Hush up, Rufus! Let tha boy sit dair.” yells Cletus as he gets up, walks towards C.J and shoves Rufus away. “’Don’tchew mine him son. He id’int right in tha head.”<br />
<br />
“It-it’s no worries. I was just about to leave.” C.J. hurriedly walks off back towards his friends.<br />
<br />
Rufus turns and looks back at Cletus. “Ya know him or sumthin’?”<br />
<br />
“Course I know him! He’s [INSERT YOUR NAME HERE] friend.”<br />
<br />
“[INSERT YOUR NAME HERE] friend? Jew dink he her’ allah’ dat?,&quot; says another Redneck.<br />
<br />
“Prob’bly. If’n he did, dair’s nutin’ he could do ‘bout it. [INSERT YOUR NAME HERE]’s mine... I-I mean one o’vus now.” Cletus walks back to his seat. “Now les taak ‘bout how we gon’ git our boy out dis mess.”<br />
<br />
****<br />
<br />
Back in detention, your snoring was starting to become increasingly aggravating to those around you. The supervisor, whom couldn’t take much more of your wheezing, gets up and walks towards you. “Hey!” he says as he shoves your shoulder. You make a loud snort and continue sleeping prompting more giggling from the other students. Frustrated at you, the supervisor irately moans, grabs a nearby text book, and slams it down on your table causing you to yell and instantly spring forth to attention. <br />
<br />
“Had a nice nap?,” asks the supervisor sarcastically. <br />
<br />
You wipe the drool from your mouth and nod in response.  As the supervisor stomps back to his desk, you usher out a deep yawn and stretch your arms before scratching yourself on the neck. Upon finishing, the same security officer from earlier enters the room.<br />
<br />
“Please tell me his folks are here…” blurts the supervisor.<br />
<br />
“Country got you whipped huh?”<br />
<br />
“Don’t ask…”<br />
<br />
“Heh, fortunately for you his older sister’s here now.” The officer signs for you to come here with his index finger; however, as you get up, you achingly topple over in pain causing the officer to run to your aid. “Woah there kid. You okay?”<br />
<br />
The pain was coming from your feet which felt incredibly tight within your shoes. You were about to ask to remove them but evidently decided against it. You shrug off the officer and selfishly rise to your feet. “I’m dandy,” you barked as you crack your toes around in your shoes. <br />
<br />
“Whatever you say tough guy,” replies the officer, “Let’s move.” <br />
<br />
The 2 of you leave the detention room and walk down the hall. With each step the stinging pain around your feet reoccurs again and again. Wanting to take your mind off the aching, you turn your head and glance at the officer. To be honest, he wasn’t that bad looking. He was relatively well built; he has a nice cropping of black hair on his head; he has a cute little goatee under his chin; he even seemed to be a pretty hairy guy as you can see a fine pelt of black hair on the back of his hands and fingers. Also, for the first time, instead of craving for Cletus’s penis, you started to crave for this guys rear. Yes, the officer next to you has one hell of a fine rear. You rub your chin thinking how your own manhood would feel within that gorgeous behind. All of a sudden, you reach over and pinch the officer on his behind. <br />
<br />
The officer stops and instantly turns around “THE HELL!?” he screams.<br />
<br />
“Um… Dair’s sum white paper stuck dair and I swiped it off,” you lie as he blushes. <br />
<br />
“Don’t be doing that kid or I may have to arrest you for harassment!” he yells as he turns back around and continues walking.<br />
<br />
You, somewhat in shock, look at your hand and twist it around. Doing that to that guy felt oddly enjoyable. You sniff your fingers and smile as you catch up to him. <br />
<br />
As you continue to check him out, you realized that you are actually looking DOWN at him a bit. You could’ve sworn that he was a little taller then you this morning. <br />
<br />
“Hey Mistuh. How talls are ya?” you ask out of curiousity.<br />
<br />
“First you touch my rear and now you ask how tall I am? Man something’s wrong with you kiddo.”<br />
<br />
You couldn’t argue with that; although, you didn’t agree with that “kiddo” part as he’s now smaller then you. Nonetheless, you deduce that you must be undergoing even more changes. So far, other than your aching feet, you’re rather enjoying your further alterations.<br />
<br />
Just then, the class bell rings and everyone pours out of their classrooms. You try to catch up to the officer, but in the midst of the confusion, someone loudly howlers the word “FIGGHHHT!” As you stand still and look, everyone, including the officer, hurries towards the direction of the shout. Suddenly, someone tugs on your side prompting you to turn and see Cletus.<br />
<br />
“Heidair [INSERT YOUR NAME HERE]!”<br />
<br />
Without saying a word, you instantly embrace Cletus in your arms and start to passionately caress his back. <br />
<br />
“Woah dair soldier! I wasn’t gone long.”<br />
<br />
“I missed ya so much Clee.”<br />
<br />
“Heh, I seed ya got a bit biggers since I left. Jew bin a good ol’ boy?”<br />
<br />
“Uh-huh,” you reply as you pull off of him.<br />
<br />
Cletus looks in the direction where everyone else ran off to. “C’mon, les ditch this hale hole.”<br />
<br />
“But wha’bout mah sis?”<br />
<br />
“Sis? Me and ‘our boys’ yer family, remembers?”<br />
<br />
You laugh. “Haha. ‘Course bubba! I allmos’ forgot.”<br />
<br />
Cletus and you make your way out the back of the cafeteria towards the parking lot, and towards your truck. You stop in front on the truck to relieve your foot pain. <br />
<br />
“Jew mine if’n u drive, Clee? Mah feet hurt.” <br />
<br />
“Shure, buddy. Toss me yer metal.”<br />
<br />
You toss Cletus your keys and proceed to hop in the passenger seat; he follows suit and hops in the driver seat, then both you and him slam the doors.<br />
<br />
“So whair we head’n to?”<br />
<br />
“We gon’ hit the cornah store and git u home. U ain’t lookin too good.”, he says while he starts the truck.<br />
<br />
You look in the sideview mirror and find yourself perspiring somewhat heavily. Cletus reaches down in his back pocket and tosses you a dirty handkerchief. You look at it for a bit, but shrug its condition off as you use it to wipe your forehead, your arms, and hands before sliding it in your back pocket. As Cletus pulls out from the lot, you achingly pull your shoes off from your feet. Once done, you fall back in the chair in pleasure as the pain in your feet subsides. You look down and wriggle your toes in delight as a rancid yet strangely familiar odor filled the truck. Seemingly already used to the smell, you take in a big whiff and scratch your belly.<br />
<br />
“I dink mah feet gottin bigger Clee.”<br />
<br />
“Uh-huh, I know…” he grievingly replies as he frantically rolls the window down for some air.</p>
