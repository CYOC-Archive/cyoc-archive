<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You got home and told your parents that you were going to a party and that you would be spending the night there. They were thrilled that you were going to a party. They didn't understand why you didn't have friends and they saw this as you finally coming out of your shell. Maybe you were.<br />
<br />
You take a shower and pick out some decent clothes. You might as well look your best but you didn't want your good clothes to be ruined. You had an idea that things would get a bit wild at the party. You pack up a change of clothes, your pajamas, and your swimming trunks. You ate some supper then brushed your teeth and packed your toothbrush and toothpaste. It was seven now so you go out to your car and head for Tammy's house.<br />
<br />
Once you get to Tammy's house you're amazed that there's a gate and gate house with a security guard. The guard asks you to provide ID and asked you why you were here. He let you in when you explained that you were invited and showed him the card Tammy gave you.<br />
<br />
After a short while you see Tammy's house, or you should say mansion. You didn't know that Tammy's parents were rich. As you pulled up a man opened your door and said that he would park it for you. You knew that you were taking a risk but you allowed him to after you grabbed your stuff. You walk up to the door and ring the bell.<br />
<br />
You were expecting a butler to answer but instead Tammy did. Your surprise must have shown on your face since Tammy said &quot;The butler has tonight off. Come on in.&quot;<br />
<br />
You walk into a huge foyer. Tammy heads up the stairs and you follow. After a couple of minutes she opens a door and says &quot;This will be your room. I'm sorry if it's a little feminine but it's the only one we have available right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
You enter the room and look around. Other than the canopy bed having pink bedding and pink sheers and a make-up table with a mirror it didn't look feminine. You look at Tammy and said &quot;This is ok. I can stand to stay in this room.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm glad to hear you say that&quot; Tammy said. &quot;Now if you'd like to put your bag down you can join the party.&quot;<br />
<br />
You put your bag on the chest at the foot of the bed and followed Tammy out. It took you a few minutes but you soon entered a room where the other cheerleaders were. When you entered they welcomed you. They were being very friendly which put you on edge a bit. You look around and see that you're the only male there. &quot;Are there any other guys here?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh there'll be more guys here later&quot; Tammy said. &quot;We wanted some time alone with you first though. May I offer you something to drink?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... sure&quot; you said. This was every guys dream come true. You had all these cheerleaders here to yourself right now.<br />
<br />
Tammy goes over to a bar and and pours something into a glass. She comes back over to you and hands it to you while saying &quot;Here you go. One cold apple juice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... thanks&quot; you said. &quot;How did you know that I like apple juice?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I've been watching you at lunch and have seen you get an apple juice with every meal&quot; Tammy said. &quot;I want to introduce you to the rest of the girls now. This is Monique, Melanie, Chantalle, Chandra, Melissa, Penelope or Penny, Patricia or Patty, Bonnie, and Robin.&quot;<br />
<br />
They each great you in turn and you great them in return. They stare at you and this makes you nervous so you drink the whole glass of apple juice quickly. The apple juice tasted a bit odd and you said &quot;I think the apple juice may be going bad. It tasted funny.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I'm sure the apple juice is good&quot; Tammy said. &quot;It was just pressed today.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That may explain it then&quot; you said. &quot;I've never had fresh pressed apple juice. It's bound to taste a bit different.&quot; Suddenly you feel a little light headed and you drop the glass you were holding. You fall to your knees and then to your side. You realize that you had just been drugged.<br />
<br />
&quot;The potion affected you faster than I thought it would&quot; Tammy said. &quot;Penny, get the Smooth Away. The rest of you help me get him undressed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Penny ran out of the room while Tammy and the rest undressed you. You had seen the commercials for Smooth Away and you figured that they were going to get rid of all your body hair and take pictures. You were completely naked when Penny came back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Took you long enough&quot; Tammy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry about that&quot; Penny said. &quot;They weren't where you had said they would be.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I had told the maid not to move them&quot; Tammy said. &quot;Where did you find them?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In your room&quot; Penny said. &quot;I figured that would be the most likely place someone would have put them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh well, it doesn't matter now&quot; Tammy said. &quot;Let's get rid of all this nasty body hair.&quot;<br />
<br />
The cheerleaders started to rub your body hair away. They didn't leave any part of your body untouched. They even did your face. Thankfully they didn't touch the hair on your scalp, you didn't want a bald head. All during this you were expecting to get an erection but you never did. You figured that it was because of the drug that they slipped you. You keep berating yourself that you had been so stupid allowing someone to pour you something to drink. Now you couldn't move and you were at their mercy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok that part's done&quot; Tammy said when they were finished. &quot;Now on to the next step. Bonnie, go get the oil.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bonnie left and came back with several bottles. Each girl took one and poured some of whatever was in them on their hands. They then began to massage your body. You could feel the warmth penetrate deep into your body. After a few minutes your body started to feel different. It seemed to be a bit slimmer everywhere except your hips which seemed a bit wider and your ass which seemed a bit fuller. As Chandra was massaging your chest mounds began to form and you soon had C cup breasts. Monique was massaging your dick and balls. You felt them grow smaller until you had a flat spot where your dick was. Monique kept massaging and you felt what was left of your dick slide down to between your legs. Monique pressed firmly between your legs and her fingers go into your body. She ran her fingers around a little bit before withdrawing them.<br />
<br />
All the girls were done now and Tammy says &quot;Almost done, just three more steps to go. Monique, get the blue eye drops.&quot;<br />
<br />
Monique left and was soon back with a blue bottle which you assumed were the eye drops. You didn't know what the eye drops would do but you thought you had an idea. Tammy held your eyelids open and put a couple of drops in each eye.<br />
<br />
&quot;Robin, get the nail cream&quot; Tammy said. Robin left and was soon back with a white tube. A couple of the girls squeezed a small amount onto their fingers and rubbed it into your fingers along your nails and skin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok Chantalle, go get the Platinum Blonde hair cream&quot; Tammy said. Chantalle did as she was told and was soon back with a bottle. &quot;Help me get her up into a sitting position so I can work on her hair.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melanie and Melissa sat you up and held you while Tammy massage the cream into your scalp. Your scalp tingled as she did. Finally she was done and she said &quot;Go ahead and lay her back down. Mellisa, help me with the mirror so she can see what she looks like now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tammy and Melissa hold a full length mirror over you. You could see that they had somehow changed you into a girl. Your hair was now Platinum Blonde and down past your shoulders instead of the short Dark Brown that it was and your eyes were a vibrant blue now instead of their usual hazel. You could see that your finger nails were longer now, extending past your finger tips by about three sixteenths of an inch. You thought that you had even lost some of your height.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok I think she's seen enough&quot; Tammy said. &quot;Let's get her to bed.&quot;<br />
<br />
The girls carry you back to the room Tammy had showed you before. They dress you in a pair of black satin panties and nightie. They then place you into the bed and tuck you in. Before leaving Tammy leaned close to you and said &quot;I can change you into anything I want. If you're good and go along with this this is all I'll do to you. You'll be a girl and a cheerleader and live here. If you're not good I'll turn you into my pet dog or cat. Maybe I'll turn you into a pig to be butchered or a chicken. I can even turn you into something inanimate. How about a football or a sex doll. Maybe a nice necklace for me to wear. Don't worry about your parents. I've already sent them a nice potion that will put them to sleep and make them forget all about you as a male. By Monday nobody will remember you as you were.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tammy picks up your bag and was at the door when she turned around and said &quot;You'll be asleep in a few minutes. Oh, and there's one other thing. Your name is Abigayle or Abby now. I've also set you up with one of the Basketball players for tomorrow. His name is Dale. You won't say anything about what happened here tonight or he'll be changed along with you. So be good and don't spill the beans. We'll teach you how to be a girl tomorrow and Sunday if you've been good we'll teach you the cheers. Good night.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tammy left and closed the door. There was a soft glow coming from somewhere so you could still see. You figured that Tammy was serious about being able to change you into anything she wanted. You needed to be good so you don't end up being changed again. The only problem was that you didn't know what Tammy considered to be good. With the thought of possibly being changed again you fell asleep.</p>
