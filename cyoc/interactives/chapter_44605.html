<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">An hour later, Odette awoke from a dream in her room, once more her plain self.  Her bed warm and the sheets rumpled and balled to one side.  She lay and thought while the late afternoon breeze pushed the light curtains in to temporary ghosts and the sounds of summer wafted up through the screen.<br />
<br />
She had used the sheets to make a temporary top to venture out to the phone in the hallway.  It had been difficult to tie the sheet tight to contain the massive balls while they got in the way of her arms but eventually she had made an improvised toga that would serve for the short time she needed.  She called Jimmy and he apologized once again for his actions last night.  Odette wondered if there were a rash of boys all over making the same call to weeping girlfriends.  But she was not weeping.  She had wondered how much she should tell Jimmy about Loki's deal but had decided it should be done in person.  He was coming over later for a movie.  Now that she had slept showing him would also be possible as well as telling.<br />
<br />
The shocking thing, however, was that Odette's mother had walked through the hall and had seen Odette in her bedding-clothes.  Odette had frozen, unable to move or come up with some sort of explanation.  But her mother did not seem to notice.  Odette was sure that she had seen her.  Was sure that there was no other way that her mother could not have looked anywhere other than at her breasts and still she did not freak out.  Odette could not understand it.  She followed her mother and talked to her about nothing.  Once again her mom had looked right at Odette and even noticed her boobs.  She did however comment that if Odette felt the need to wear the bed-spread that she might as well do so on the bed and get some sleep.  Which is what Odette had done.<br />
<br />
She had come to some conclusion.  Those that were close to her, like family, did not seem to notice her changes.  They saw her as normal old Odette.  This would make everything much easier if she did not have to worry about hiding in her room if she made a mistake like before.  But for now she thought about what to do about Jimmy.  What would she show him?  She had several hours yet to think.<br />
<br />
----------------------<br />
<br />
Later Jimmy arrived.<br />
<br />
Odette met him at the door dressed in cut off jean-shorts and a crop tank-top that bared her stomach.  She wanted Jimmy to see her tiny waist.  So that he would not be able to look at anything else and so that he would be a little turned on.  She quickly whisked him away to the cool basement out of the summer mugginess.  There they could lounge on smelly old couches and be alone to watch the TV.<br />
<br />
&quot;You, ahh, look good tonight, O,&quot; Jimmy said staring at her mid-drift.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, Jimmy.  But there is something that I have to tell you about.&quot;  She flopped on the puffy cushion as he slumped into a easy-chair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, what?&quot;  Jimmy was nervous.  He was expecting to get the 'let's be friends' talk.  He was feeling down and ashamed.  She had a good reason to dump him.  He just could not figure out why she was smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jimmy, last night at the prom I received a wish.&quot;  Odette paused for a moment.  When it did not look like he was going to interupt she continued.  &quot;That guy that had you on stage came to visit me later.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;'That guy'?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't want to say his name right now, but you know who I am talking about, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jimmy nodded, &quot;Loki.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right.  Well, he said that what he did to me at your wish was unfair.  So, to make it up to me, he gave me a wish, also.&quot;  Odette paused.  How do you tell someone that you are a shape-shifter?<br />
<br />
&quot;He gave you a wish?  He just shows up and says, 'Hey I feel bad that your boyfriend is a dick and how 'bout a wish to make it all better?'  What did you wish for?  Was it to get back at me?&quot;  Jimmy was frightened now.  He started to wonder if he could run fast enough to outrun magic.<br />
<br />
&quot;No!  That was one of the options but I didn't take it.  I chose to make the wish on myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jimmy seemed to calm a little but he was still not comfortable.  &quot;What did you wish for?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I wanted to get rid of the waist that you gave me, but he said that was not an option.  So I thought of what else I wanted to change.  Only I couldn't decide on any one thing.  So, I wished to be able to change everything about me.&quot;  Odette blurted it out.  Then she waited.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can change everything about yourself?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.  Anything and everything.  At least I think so.  I haven't tried everything yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it permanent?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not, really.  It stays the way I want it, but it goes back when I sleep.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you can just change?  Anything?  Any part of you?  Just you?  Just your body?  What about ...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jimmy, I don't know.  I haven't had the chance to try everything else out.  I only got the wish last night.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, it's just a lot to take in.  There are so many questions.  You're not just fooling me are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot;  Odette was almost in a panic.  If Jimmy could not accept this then there would be trouble.  But she did not want him to think that she was joking.  She knew that it would have to come down to a demonstration.  &quot;All I've tried so far is to make my nose smaller and make myself taller.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You seem normal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I have napped since then.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; Jimmy fell silent.  He seemed to be lost in thought.  His eyes kept roaming all over her body then darting away as if he did not want her to know that what he was thinking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe, it will be easier if I just show you,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
He seemed relieved that she was the one to suggest it.  &quot;Sure.  Fine.  It doesn't hurt does it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.  Not at all.  What would you like to see?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You want me to choose?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jimmy, if this is a part of me now then I want you to be comfortable with it.  I promise not to judge.  And its temporary.  Let me guess, you want me to make my boobs bigger?&quot;<br />
<br />
A goofy grin broke out on his face.  &quot;I don't want to admit it but yeah.  Could you maybe make yourself have big round ones like this.&quot;  He held out his hands approximating something about two cup sizes larger than Odette sported now.  These would still be much smaller than the ones she had given herself before but this was not the time for that.  &quot;Also could you, like, make your butt bigger?  Like, round and sticking out, so that you would have this awesome hour-glass shape?  Like a coke bottle or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anything else?&quot;  Odette said as she stood up.  There was something about how he was ready to change everything about her that seemed wrong.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahh, no.  I can't think of anything else.  Unless you want to.  I just always wanted to see you with a little more curve.  Are you angry?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, Jimmy.&quot;  In fact she was happy he did not want to change much more.<br />
<br />
Odette stood in front of Jimmy in the middle of the room and said his name twice quietly.  She felt the power rise in her body and decided to be quick about it so that she did not end up like before.  Since she cound not see it the best she started on her butt.  She focussed on her bum and tried to think of it getting larger and rounder and widder and sticking out.  In an instant she felt it push against her shorts and fill them up.  There was a short shriek form Jimmy as her ass doubled in size.  But it was replaced by giggles and laughter.  Concentrating she continued to round round it out until her shorts were tight.  Then she turned her attention to her breasts.  She had decided to not wear a bra due to cleaver forethought.  As her breasts filled out her top she felt the fabric rub across her nipples and they became erect.  She filled her breasts out a little more than what Jimmy had asked and just to have a little fun she made the nipples larger and hard.  Her top was tight and she really wanted it to be bigger so her tits could sway.  Suddenly to her surprise the shirt shifted and loosened.  It was now fit perfectly to her new shape; tight where she wanted and loose where she needed.  As the feelings of her inflated body started to bubble through her, Odette said his name again to stop the process.<br />
<br />
Jimmy was agog.  If he had been a shape-shifter too, his eyes would have been saucer shaped.  He was silent and dazed.<br />
<br />
Odette jiggled a little and leaned forward giving him an intended deep view of her cleavage.  &quot;What do you think?&quot;</p>
