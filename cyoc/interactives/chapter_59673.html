<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff then went to his bedroom and got his Chronivac out. He thought about his day and realized that the Chronivac had been very accurate in <br />
predicting what he wanted. He had enjoyed his day more than he expected. But then fear of losing his balls made Jeff realize that the Chronivac <br />
had not been perfect in its prediction. There were some flaws. Jeff stayed up late studying the Chronivac trying to see how he could improve <br />
the situation. He fell asleep Saturday night before he could learn anything.<br />
<br />
By Sunday night, he understood a lot. He'd even found the portion of the program that changed the way people reacted to him. It was the <br />
smallest portion of the program and there wasn't room for anything complicated. There was no way that he could specify any individuals other <br />
than himself. The Chronivac sent waves of suggestions to everyone within 100 miles influencing the way they reacted to Jeff but this influence <br />
could not distinguish one person from another. Overall, it simply suggested that everyone to think it was normal for Jeff to be a human with a <br />
dog-like personality, preferences and behaviors. Jeff himself was under these same influential suggestions. These suggestions could be <br />
resisted but unless someone purposefully resisted the suggestion, no one would resist the suggestion.<br />
<br />
This influential suggestion did have some options that could be changed. One of these options was called hierarchy and it controlled whether <br />
people considered themselves to superior to Jeff or inferior. Because Jeff was considered dog-like and it's normal for humans to be considered <br />
superior to dogs, Jeff's hierarchy score was set low. Another of these options was called autonomy and it controlled the degree of freedom <br />
people would give Jeff to make decisions for himself and this score was also set low. There was an option called favorability which controlled <br />
whether people would be favorable to Jeff or would seek to cause Jeff misery. This score was set high. People would like Jeff and want to be <br />
kind to him. There were a few options that controlled how aware people were of Jeff's change and a few other options as well. Jeff did reset his <br />
autonomy score to be a little higher but decided that he still needed to do more research before he changed anything.<br />
<br />
Monday, Jeff went to school. With an increased autonomy, he didn't need to be on a leash. He even argued with his mom as she wanted to <br />
dress him up in one of those silly pet outfits but they came to a compromise and Jeff wore a vest, bow tie and shoes with his dog collar. Just <br />
like Saturday and Sunday, people treated him fairly normal. They were aware that he was naked except for the vest. They were aware that he <br />
was dog-like. But mostly, they still treated him like they had always treated him. His friends were still his friends. People who didn't like him <br />
still didn't like him. The teachers still expected him to keep up with class work.<br />
<br />
In P.E., the coach yelled at him for not wearing a jockstrap. So he went into the locker room to remove his vest and bow tie and he wore just a <br />
jockstrap. In the showers, several of the guys wanted to wash Jeff as it was a treat to have a dog in the locker room.<br />
<br />
At lunch, he sat with his friends as usual but Jason moved his tray to the floor, &quot;I'm not going to have a dog sitting next to me while I'm eating.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff took lunch as his opportunity to ask his friends about how they would treat him if he were their dog. As they were finishing lunch, Jason <br />
grabbed Jeff by the balls and said, &quot;You know you really ought to get these removed. They only cause dogs like you to become bad dogs and I <br />
won't be friends with a bad dog. I'm not going to hang out with you anymore until these are gone and if they're not gone by Saturday, I'm going <br />
to come looking for you with a neutering kit.&quot;<br />
<br />
After school, Jeff's dad picked him up and took him to help pick out a pet carrier for the upcoming family vacation. Jeff got inside different <br />
carriers and tested them for comfort. Then his dad purchased one and Jeff rode him in the pet carrier like a good boy.<br />
<br />
Monday night, Jeff decided what changes needed to be made.</p>
