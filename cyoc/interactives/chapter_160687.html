<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">At the mention of their first meeting in this new reality, Jeff began to remember how he had met the Amazon and how they had started dating. <br />
<br />
It had been three months ago when some local celebrity had come back into town for a wrestling match to help with hospital fund raiser and Jeff&#39;s best mates Dan and Neil had bought tickets to the event, Jeff however didn&#39;t want to go. He had just been dumped by his girlfriend Ashley and didn&#39;t feel like going out and interacting with others. Dan and Neil however wouldn&#39;t take no for an answer and dragged him along to the stadium to watch the match. <br />
<br />
Reluctant as he had been to go, Jeff had to admit that he did enjoy the match and although he had no idea that the Amazon herself had come from around these parts he was quickly becoming a fan of hers. Just watching the way she navigated and around her rival and dodging his moves was like a fine art and thought he felt his manhood harden when he saw her rap her legs around the guy&#39;s head in a headlock. <br />
<br />
After the match had finished (naturally in the Amazon&#39;s victory), Jeff and his friend were leaving the stadium when had began to tease him. &quot;I saw you you perv!&quot; Neil laughed, slapping his friend on his back. &quot;You got a boner for that big chick while we were watching her fight.&quot; Dan laughed. &quot;Seriously? I know Ashley dumped you but you can&#39;t be that desperate Jeff.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What were you even doing looking at my crotch?&quot; Jeff asked, changing the subject and Dan quickly started laughing and making jokes at Neil. Neil for his part got angry and punched Jeff in the face, pushing him through the door behind them and landing face first in the concrete floor out cold. <br />
<br />
When he came to he was laying on a couch, his vision was a little blurry at first but quickly realised that someone was standing over him. When his vision came back he saw that it was the Amazon herself and that he was laying on a couch in her changing room. <br />
<br />
&quot;Glad to see you&#39;re awake.&quot; She told him, dabbing his nose with a tissue, he hadn&#39;t even noticed it was bleeding. &quot;Your friend hit you pretty hard.&quot; &quot;Where are they?&quot; He asked her and looked around. &quot;I had them thrown out after they hit you.&quot; The Amazon replied, chucking the tissue in the bin and getting another one. Her muscles bulging as the flexed them. Jeff was so mesmerised by them that he hadn&#39;t realised that she had noticed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Like what you see?&quot; She asked with a cheeky smile. Coursing him to go red in the face. &quot;It&#39;s okay I don&#39;t mind, honestly you&#39;re the first guy your age who isn&#39;t intimidated by a hulking gal like myself.&quot; She told him. <br />
<br />
&quot;I quite like em.&quot; He confessed, his eyes slowly drifting towards her large chest. &quot;Hey, eyes up here buddy!&quot; She teased. &quot;S...sorry!&quot; He stammered. She grinned. &quot;Jeez you&#39;re fun to tease kid!&quot; She laughed and helped him up off the couch. &quot;C&#39;mon, I wanna get you checked out at the hospital before I take you home.&quot; She said.<br />
<br />
Taken aback by this, Jeff stammered, &quot;th...there that w...won&#39;t be necessary!&quot; &quot;The hell it isn&#39;t!&quot; Replied the Amazon, slipping on her leather jacket, &quot;you may have a concussion. You&#39;re getting checked out if you like it or not.&quot; She wasn&#39;t giving him much on an option. &quot;Fine.&quot; He said. <br />
<br />
&quot;You got a name kid?&quot; She asked him. &quot;Jeff.&quot; He replied. &quot;Pleased to meet you Jeff, you can call me Jennifer, but every one calls me Jenny.&quot; <br />
<br />
When the got to the A&E, the doctors had assured them that Jeff was fine and gave him some painkillers for his nose then sent him home. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks for everything.&quot; Jeff told Jenny on the drive home. &quot;You&#39;re welcome.&quot; She replied. <br />
<br />
They were silent for the rest of the journey until Jenny asked, &quot;soooo, you got a girlfriend?&quot; &quot;Errrr, no, I did have but she dumped me.&quot; He told her. &quot;Thats too bad,&quot; she replied sincerely. &quot;Good looking kid like you deserves to be with someone whose lucky to have you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; he replied and looked back at her. &quot;What about you, do you have anyone?&quot; &quot;Nah, most guys are usually too intimidated by me to go out with me.&quot; She confessed to him. &quot;I don&#39;t think you&#39;re intimidating, in fact I&#39;d say you&#39;re....&quot; He cut himself off when Jenny shot him a curious look and he remains silent the rest of the journey. <br />
<br />
When they pulled up outside his house, Jeff thanked her once again and got out. &quot;Hey Jeff!&quot; She called out and he looked back at her. &quot;If you&#39;re free tomorrow do you fancy going to get a coffee or something?&quot; She asked him. Jeff was taken aback by how forward she was. &quot;S...sure!&quot; He said.<br />
<br />
&quot;See you tomorrow.&quot; She told him and drove off, leaving Jeff with a raising tent in his pants</p>
