<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The morning sun started to shine as the rays reached the house and seeping through the windows.  Once it hit Katie’s room, Katie began to stir as she opened her eyes to see the morning sun.  Seeing the sun, she started to yawn and sat up from her bed, stretching her arms in an attempt to relax.  “Man, what a nice sleep.” she said to herself rubbing the tiredness out of her eyes, “Got to say, it was a really strange dream.  I had a mother once and then she turned into my twin sister.  This seems so absurd.  I don’t have a sister; I’m an only child.  Hell, I don’t even have a mother anymore.”<br />
<br />
When she made that wish last night, when she wished her mother/twin sister out of existence, Katie’s memories altered with the ring’s wish so that Kellie didn’t even exist at all.  In her new memories, young Katie was orphaned when she was young when her mother died in a car accident while she was with the nanny.  After that, she was stuck in the foster system where she waited for someone to adopt her.  But after a few years in the system and many kids needing a home, it was impossible for Katie to get adopted.  Though the one thing that hadn’t been altered was that she still had her ring.<br />
<br />
She looked to the ring on her finger and smiled very warmly, saying, “It’s nice that I have found this ring, otherwise I would be stuck in foster care forever.”  In her altered memories, she found the ring two days ago on the street and tested her new power on the kid that bullied her.  After that, she returned to the foster home to test the ring out herself, aging to a twenty-five year old woman just so she can get out of the system.  When reality altered and the folks in the foster system thought she was just a young woman looking for a kid, Katie was free and wanted to try the ring out on other people while celebrating her freedom.  She decided to head to the beach to enjoy her new body and went to the bar to begin drinking.  Thankfully reality altered and she had an ID to pass as an adult, not the mention knowledge to help her survive in the real world, mostly in athletics giving how energetic she was as a child.  That’s when she met Mary and her fiends when they were old women.  So she used her ring to not only make them regress to the same age she is, but also alter their memories to make them believe that they were all friends since high school.  Because of that, she now has friends of her own compared to the ones in the foster home and they had to great time, from going to drinking the say away to partying in the club at night.<br />
<br />
Smiling to herself, she enjoyed this new life thanks to the ring and loved every minute of it.  Looking out at the view of California, her life couldn’t get any better of it.  Thanks to this new power, she won’t go back to her young childish self and would never be a foster child all her life.  And thanks to her skills as an athlete, she now lives in the crib with a bank account that will keep herself fed and healthy.  “This day couldn’t get any better then this.  This ring gave me a new shot at life and will make me happy.  I’m never going back to that old life, no matter what.”<br />
<br />
Just as she thought of it, she remembered Mary and the others.  When she regressed them physically and mentally, she didn’t alter their reality.  She knows they had family and grandchildren and they will be worried about what happened to them.  She might bring them back to their elderly age, but they seem happier being young adults.  Plus she will loose her friends and she doesn’t want to be alone again.  So thinking this through, she decided to make another wish for them.  Looking to her ring, she closed her eyes and made her wish.<br />
<br />
“I wish that Mary, Claudia, Tricia, Samantha, and Mika have their realities altered to match their age.  That their memories of their jobs would exist in the real world and enjoy it to the fullest.  I want family and friends that knew about their old lives to forget about them and they their children and grandchildren changed to make them forget about their grandmothers.  I want my new friends to have the happy and carefree lives I now have.  Please make this wish come true.”<br />
<br />
Once she finished, the ring started to glow as reality for Mary and the others altered to match their new ages while friends and family that knew them either had their memories changes or blinked out of existence.  Once their reality was changed, Katie smiled at her success and decided to see how their new lives are holding up as she left her room with her robe on.<br />
<br />
She then went downstairs to the dining room to see her new friends gathered together as Tricia was cooking breakfast for all of them.  Mary looked to Katie and said, “Morning sunshine.  You sleep well?”  Katie smiled back and said to her, “You could say that.  Guess all those drinks and dancing really did a number on me.  Immediately crashed after heading back home.”  “You and me both girlfriend.” Mary continued, “All that partying got us all in a loop.  At least we had a good time before we get back to work.  I need to get to school to teach the kids today and I don’t want to look all hung over.”<br />
<br />
The others soon joined in as they gave their own two cents.  “Tell me about it sweetheart,” Mika said to them, “I need to get to Louis Vuitton to work on the latest fashion line.  I mess up on the new clothing and I would start on a new job.”  Claudia just turned to Mika with a sly grin and said, “Won’t be a problem with me.  When you drunk, you can just simply run with it.  I heard the more you drink, and more sexy you look in those outfits.”  Mika turned to her with a glare and retorted, “Well Claude, this is what you get when a model get over her head, especially from a whore like you.”  “Puh-lease,” Claudia said back, “You’re just jealous because you don’t have the body that I have.  I mean who said no to these knockers.”  She then holds her huge C cup breasts and squeezed, showing how firm and bouncy they were.  Mika was simply disgusted, as she knew Claudia was just a slut showing off her body to the guys.  It’s no wonder why she would take up modeling.  Mary saw this and decided to break it up.  “Now girls, let’s not fight over this.  After all, this is our time together before we get started on our jobs.”<br />
<br />
Samantha flinged her strands of hair off the side of her face and said, “Tell me about it.  Tricia and I have just opened up our restaurant and I hope that it would be the most popular out in the Hills.  Tricia is already setting up breakfast menu for our restaurant giving that no other place could do that other then those fast food chains.  Isn’t that right Tric?”  As soon as she said that, Tricia came in with a two trays of food on each hand.  “Oh Sam,” she said, “I’ve been working up a storm in the kitchen.  With these new breakfast dishes, I will let people talking.  Take a look at these dishes I cooked up for you guys to try.  I have Banana-Coconut Pancakes with berries sprinkled on top, Tornado hash browns, Glazed Maple-Walnut Kringle, Skillet Buttermilk Biscuits, Bacon-and-Leek Quiche, and a Breakfast Burrito.  I swear, these dishes will give me a Zagat rating.”  Mary laughed it off and said, “Well played Tricia, you certainly know how to make the food you cook sound scrumptious.”  She then turned to Katie and said, “What about you Kate, any plans for today?”<br />
<br />
Katie simply shrugged it off and said, “Nothing important if that’s what you mean.  I guess I’ll be working out and jogging at the park.  A woman my age needs to keep her body in shape for future competitions.”<br />
<br />
The others listened to what she’s going to do as they thought she needs to spice up her day.  “You know,” Mary said to her, “The school has young girls that looked up to you and wished to be like you.  If you want, I can invite you to the school’s gym to show you how well these future girl athletes can do.”<br />
<br />
Mika then said to her, “And I got some new clothes for the summer line done and I need someone to try them out.  The last person got down with the flu and couldn’t work today and since you and my client are the same size and weight, I think I can squeeze you in for some dress rehearsals.”<br />
<br />
“Really?” Claudia looked to Mika with a bit of hate in her eyes before turning to Katie for an offer of her own.  “I got a photo shoot in a matter of hours at Vanity Fair and they are interested in having you at the photo shoot for months now.  If you say yes, I can squeeze you in with me and we can steel the spotlight in the magazine pages.  Trust me, you will love that job.”<br />
<br />
Samantha then decided to stir the pot and said to her, “Well if you’re available for tonight, I can hook you up with a guy I know in the neighborhood.  He had heard of your athletic achievements and wish to go out with you.  If you want, I can set up a reservation with you and this guy while Tricia whip up some lovely dishes for the two of you to enjoy.  It will be romantic.”<br />
<br />
Katie listened to their offers and was intrigued.  Giving that she has nothing to do, she can take up one of their offers for today and would like to take part of it.  Who knows, she can use her ring to maybe change up her age or others around her.  That will make her day very interesting.  Looking to each of them, she told them, “Very tempting offers ladies.  I’ll think about it though.”  The girls soon nodded and went to their breakfast, talking about the night they had yesterday and laughing it up.  Katie looked to them and could tell they were happy about their new lives and wouldn’t want to let it go.  In her head, she thought that this was going to be a very interesting day.</p>
