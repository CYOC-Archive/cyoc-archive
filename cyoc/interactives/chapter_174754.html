<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Bill the new &quot;Clover&quot; reached across in the dark and found her fiance&#39;s hand. It felt so much bigger than the hand she now possessed. She felt a gentle squeeze. So he was still awake. They had both been silent for at least 10 minutes. She was torn. She felt it was inevitable that they would have sex in their transformed bodies but was timid. She was telling herself &quot;Just get it over and done with so you can enjoy the week&quot; however at the same time she was scared stiff. <br />
<br />
She squeezed the other hand back then lifted it and bought it to her chest. She gave another squeeze then disengaged. &quot;Bill&#39;s&quot; hands remained on her breast. She could feel her enlarged nipple pushing against the lace of the nightie she was wearing apparently trying to get the attention of &quot;Bill&#39;s&quot; hand.<br />
<br />
The hand remained there for for too long. Bill wanted him to touch her. Had Clover fallen back to sleep? No don&#39;t think of Clover as Clover. She was &quot;Clover&quot; now. The former Clover, her fiance was now &quot;Bill&quot;. She was now a hetero woman and wanted &quot;Bill&quot; to make love to her.<br />
<br />
She reached for the hand once more and moved his fingers so he couldn&#39;t help but feel her enlarged teat. She felt the teat being very gently squeezed. That made her groin feel very moist. At least she now knew &quot;Bill&quot; was not asleep. <br />
<br />
However when she removed her own hand once more, the hand on her breast remained still. Clearly he was playing hard to get.<br />
<br />
Emboldened and knowing that &quot;Bill&quot; no doubt found the &quot;Clover&quot; body as irresistible as she had only 24 hours ago. She reached across and located the top of &quot;Bills&quot; pyjama pants. Slowly she felt her way to the crotch she was so familiar with. It wasn&#39;t hard to locate &quot;Bills&quot; swollen member. Through the material she traced it&#39;s length and girth. Clearly &quot;Bill&quot; was just faking being uninterested. Meanwhile her own crotch was throbbing with desire.<br />
<br />
She guessed what &quot;Bill&quot; might be waiting for. He wanted her permission. She knew once it was given there would be no taking it back. However she now wanted him. She wanted to give him permission and could not imagine taking it back.<br />
<br />
Her throat was dry, she wasn&#39;t sure whether she would get the words out but she tried anyway. &#39;Bill. Make love to me. Show me what it is like to be a woman&#39; her voice sounded so faint.<br />
<br />
&#39;I thought you would never ask&#39; came the deep incredibly sexy reply. Instantly his male body was full of life. He rolled over to face her and she rolled over to face him. he bought her face to his and gave her a deep lustful kiss. At the same time his fingers started to give her the breast massage she had been asking for.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bill&quot; tried to be slow. However he had been on the point of ejaculating when &quot;Clovers&quot; hands had felt his penis. Now he felt he was going to explode. He withdrew his hands from &quot;Clovers&quot; breasts pushed his own pyjama pants down. He then withdrew from the kiss and pulled his top off. His next task was to remove those panties covering &quot;Clovers&quot; pussy. He desperately needed access.<br />
<br />
With &quot;Clovers&quot; aid the panties were soon gone. She was more than moist and was desperate to be filled. She wanted that penis inside of her just as much as &quot;Bill&quot; wanted to be inside her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bill&quot; mounted her missionary style. He was on top of her and she was open for business. She felt the tip of the penis pushing against her and suddenly he was in. He thrust and she was filled. She gasped. It felt wonderful. <br />
<br />
&quot;Bill&quot; thrust and &quot;Clover&quot; responded. He was inside of her. It was too much. As the song says he felt a freight train running through his head and he exploded his load of semen into her.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t the way &quot;Bill&quot; had wanted to take &quot;Clovers&quot; virginity. He had planned to take it slowly and give her at least three orgasms before seeking his own pleasure but it seemed that wasn&#39;t to be.<br />
<br />
It also wasn&#39;t what &quot;Clover&quot; wanted - the experience of all that womanhood had to offer. Suddenly she had gone from bliss to having a weight on top of her, a quickly going limp penis inside of her and goo already appearing to leak out of her.<br />
<br />
&#39;I&#39;m so sorry&#39; said &quot;Bill&quot; as he rolled off &quot;Clover&quot;. He felt terrible.<br />
<br />
What should I reply? Puzzled Clover. She was disappointed but she totally understood how it could have happened. It took a lot of control to be inside of Clover and not immediately blow your load. &#39;I understand&#39; she admitted.<br />
<br />
&#39;I feel so sleepy&#39; said Bill.&#39;But I know I owe you an orgasm. If not two. Will you allow me to pleasure you? My penis is limp but I know where that body likes to be touched&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;I&#39;m all yours lover boy&#39; &quot;Clover&quot; felt herself replying.</p>
