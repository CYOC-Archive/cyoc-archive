<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Danny was not exactly what you would describe as well versed in the gay scene, but he did know from memes and stuff what a twink was. A grin started to form over his face as he imagined the guys his former girlfriend slept with ending up like that. But would it be fun if they just wham bam turned as soon as they fucked her? This...this was about satisfaction, and Danny intended to get his satisfaction from these guys&#39; expense. So he went ahead and edited something in. The men would change over the course of ohh, a week and at the end of the week, they&#39;d have gone from white to Asian twinks, anywhere from at the least bi preferring men to full on gay.<br />
<br />
For some reason the idea was boning Danny up a fair bit. He bit his lip a little and decided he could deal with that as soon as he was done. He wanted to see how these guys responded when their &quot;symptoms&quot; got more and more noticeable. Whether they&#39;d just go along with it and acclimate or if there&#39;d be some struggle along the way. Considering how they acted and the way they conducted themselves with his ex, Danny doubted they&#39;d have the presence of mind necessary to really deal with what was going on.<br />
<br />
Then there was Jackson. Jackson Jackson Jackson. Yes, he did not intend to just leave his former best friend alone out of this. The betrayal there had to be answered. So Danny pulled up his file. The jock was predictably handsome and muscular, but Danny decided this guy could do with a unique punishment. So he decided to go with something different from what he was already doing to the other guys who his ex had been fucking around with.<br />
<br />
Typing for a bit, Danny looked at what would result from Jackson&#39;s transformation. The racist athlete would be going from one of the big guys on campus to a gay &quot;muscle dad&quot; over the course of two weeks. Let him think he was spared somehow from all that was happening to his buddies. At least until it became too obvious that something else was going on. Jackson&#39;s age would be another thing that&#39;d change - by the end of the transformation, ol buddy would be old indeed. About forty five. And while he would be more muscular than before, he would likely not get to use that for what he wanted.<br />
<br />
Well, now that Danny had outlined the transformations, he had done his due, and now he could take care of himself! The sound of his tank top, pants and boxers hitting the floor in front of his bed was followed by Danny leaning back in his chair and groaning as his hand pistoned and worked his need. His forearm flexing as he teased the head, &quot;Ahh yeah, fuuuck...why&#39;s changing these fuckers so arousing? Ah who cares...&quot;<br />
<br />
For the rest of the night, Danny spent his time enjoying the fleshy need that seemed all too common for him. By the time he stumbled over to his bed, he emitted one more time before falling into slumber. Thinking and dreaming about seeing the vengeance he&#39;d come up with be brought to fruition.<br />
<br />
--------------<br />
<br />
The next morning, Danny got dressed in a tank top, shorts, and his usual shoes before heading out. His usual breakfast wolfed down, Danny looked at his brother again playing one of his video games while he was eating and scoffed. Jin was just inviting even worse stuff to happen to him by going all &quot;Asian and Nerdy&quot;. Would it hurt him to lift some fucking weights? Danny swore, he could not get on with nerds like that. Ah well. Maybe he could somehow convince Jin to go through with it.<br />
<br />
By the time Danny left for school he kept his eyes and ears trained for any of the jocks at the school. He was eager already to see what happened.<br />
<br />
And going by some of the conversations he overheard by the time he reached the first crossing light on his way to school, it seemed Sasha was an early bird. Danny crossed his arms and wryly grinned as he overheard some guys chatting among themselves. Really? This early in the morning and she somehow managed to fuck Gabe the big, stocky linebacker, and Terry the tall, buff basketball player? Well, this would at least let him see some interesting and varied transformations so far...<br />
<br />
Gabe: &quot;Dude, Sasha was an absolute unit this morning!&quot;<br />
<br />
Terry: &quot;Yeah, she was just insatiable...&quot;<br />
<br />
Gabe: &quot;Dude I feel kinda funny after that. Like...my dick&#39;s still all tingly.&quot;<br />
<br />
Terry: &quot;Uh oh, might wanna get that checked out buddy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gabe: &quot;Not like bad or anything, if anything it feels kinda good. I almost wanna jack off some more...&quot;<br />
<br />
Terry: &quot;Dude! Seriously? You must&#39;ve gotten off twice with her and you still need more? You horn dog!&quot;<br />
<br />
Well, it seemed things were not visual yet, Danny mused, but he guessed that whatever was happening with these two it was just starting. He decided to hang back and not really say anything to the two of them. He needed to observe and see what happened to them. Over the course of not just the day but this whole coming week. P-Purely for understanding what happened when his ex fucked a guy here, he told himself.</p>
