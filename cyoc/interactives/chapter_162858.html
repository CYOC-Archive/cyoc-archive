<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Oh God...&quot; Krissy stared at Ty in sudden flustered bewilderment. The two humans locked eyes and looked away desperately in total freaked out shame.<br />
<br />
The lizard woman chuckled as the two bashfully tried to get to the point. She sighed heavily and put her long snout on top of her upturned palm and smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot; Krissy finally blurted excitedly, barely breathing. &quot;Make me a deer. Turn me into a nice lady deer. There.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty stared at the older attractive former girlfriend of his step brother and gaped. He eyed Narissa nervously and she stared back, blinking her long lashes. &quot;Don&#39;t look at meee.&quot; The reptile snorted.<br />
<br />
Ty stared back to a terribly blushing Krissy and nodded gently, gulping. &quot;O-Okay.&quot; Ty nodded quickly. He blinked several times and took a few steps back. &quot;Okay, fine. I... I can do that for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh God.&quot; Krissy gulped, readying herself and trembling. &quot;Okay. Okay!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty closed his eyes and concentrated on Krissy. Her gorgeous busty form. In his mind&#39;s eye, he shaped her into what he supposed a nice lady deer would look like. It was strange, turning Dustin into a freakish half-cockroach and shrinking him all the way down to press him between his own fingers was delightfully erotic. But this? Ty didn&#39;t want to fuck it up. Krissy was a nice girl, after all.<br />
<br />
&quot;Focus.&quot; Narissa whispered gently.<br />
<br />
Ty gasped, opened his eyes, and nodded quickly. Krissy stared in bewilderment as Ty closed his eyes again. Okay. Turn her to a deer. A nice lady doe.<br />
<br />
He opened his eyes to see Krissy trembling and gasping sharply. Her back arched, her body shivered. He stared in utter disbelief as she let out a feminine moan. The tingles running through her body must have been something, she was completely overwhelmed, mouth raised to the sky, hands clenched tight.<br />
<br />
She popped suddenly, her mouth began to press forward and tiny fine hairs began to sprout from her skin. She gasped and let out a strangely inhuman bleat as her fingers started to pull together involuntarily. She staggered slightly. Her legs grew leaner and her elbows crunched sickeningly. Her ears began to enlarge. Tears streamed down from her eyes down increasingly furry cheeks as her nose and mouth began to grow into a deer&#39;s muzzle.<br />
<br />
With another sudden pop and sudden crackling, she began to shift. Her feet slipped from her shoes. They were now hooves. Her ankles snapped and her heels began to raise. Fur began to overtake her. Krissy gasped and let out a cry as she tried to stay on two legs, but she was rapidly shrinking and slimming, her hips pulling her down as her arms snapped forward on her barrelling torso. In moments, a formerly human girl was slipping into the body of an inhuman deer by the second, her clothing loosening and draping over a fully furred deer body. She tumbled to four legs and staggered as she shrank and slimmed just a little more. All hints of humanity melted away as a fully formed female whitetail tripped over the cuffs of her jeans. She slipped free of them, her puffy tail wagging, and shook off her other garments.<br />
<br />
The deer looked back at herself. She looked to Ty in horrified shock. She turned to regard Narissa.<br />
<br />
The lizard woman stared in curiosity and raised her hand to touch the top of the doe&#39;s muzzle. Krissy reeled back in fear and staggered back on all fours toward the treeline.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is... is she...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s a little disorientated, but her mind is intact. Give her a moment.&quot; Narissa stared in shock. &quot;Just give her a moment.&quot;<br />
<br />
Krissy stumbled once more on the forest floor and crunched over a few twigs before her personality and reason settled back into place. She relaxed slightly, still shivering, and stared at Ty once more. She opened her mouth, but only a soft bleat emerged. Startled, she looked down at herself and blinked several times.<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s lost her speech, Ty. You made her a full deer in body. She&#39;s a complete animal with a human mind.&quot; Narissa leaned in to examine their test subject and lowered her voice to small whisper. &quot;Incredible!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty stared at Krissy, who flicked her ear, and the deer approached the lizard and human carefully, still unsure of her new body. She stood in front of Ty with wonder, even with her diminished ability to emote, and they stared face to muzzle for a moment. Krissy blinked again, and wheeled around to regard Narissa.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know, love.&quot; The lizard responded, picking up her thought. &quot;If you want to, that&#39;s up to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty stared in confusion. The lizard quickly turned to him and stood to her full height. &quot;Ah, Krissy would like to stay a deer for a while. Experience life as an animal. She&#39;s okay, if you were worried.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.&quot; Ty gulped. &quot;Uh, sure...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Splendid work.&quot; The reptile whispered to Ty gently, taking her place by his side and putting a huge leathery hand on his shoulder. &quot;You&#39;ve made the impossible real. I can&#39;t express how amazing this is.&quot;<br />
<br />
Krissy, for her part, was completely disinterested in the other two. New sounds, smells, and sensations were filling her senses. She began to wander from the clearing to explore, childlike wonder in her brown eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do be careful.&quot; Narissa called quickly. &quot;Remember, you&#39;re an animal. Nobody has any way of knowing different.&quot;<br />
<br />
The doe turned her head, her expression seemed to soften, and she nodded confidently.<br />
<br />
&quot;S-See you later, Krissy!&quot; Ty called awkwardly. The deer seemed to chuckle as she wandered into the trees and then vanished from view with soft crunching growing more distant.<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;ll be fine.&quot; Narissa smirked. &quot;Unless she does something particularly stupid.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah?&quot; Ty gulped. He eyed her clothing nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, yes!&quot; The reptile nodded. &quot;We should hide the clothes of a random girl in the middle of the woods. That&#39;s all we need.&quot;<br />
<br />
They proceeded to gather Krissy&#39;s things as Narissa resumed her disguise of the young girl again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Noooow.&quot; The hidden lizard woman smiled. &quot;What do you think we should do next?&quot;</p>
