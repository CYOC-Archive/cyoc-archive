<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Neil, after cleaning himself out and up, decided this meant something important for his investigation - even if Brock and Lucas couldn&#39;t really see it, they had supplied an interesting bit of trivia. It seemed like whatever was going on here, only certain people could see it. He and Max could &quot;see it&quot;, and yet, Brock and Lucas just couldn&#39;t. &quot;Whew, man,&quot; Neil commented, &quot;That was something else, guys. I swear, I&#39;m still revved up a bit.&quot; Neil glanced down at his still erect manhood even as he got his underwear back on, noting with satisfaction how his glutes stretched the fabric out a bit. Ohh yeah...<br />
<br />
Brock for his part didn&#39;t even seem to realize he was aging - he as far as it seemed still carried himself as ever the college student. Even with the bald spot at the back of his head and, as Neil got a look at his face, a few scattered wrinkles across his broad, handsome face. &quot;Yeah man, I swear...you know how to treat a guy.&quot; Brock chuckled and looked down at his own unit, ignoring his roid-shrunken balls, &quot;...Fuck. I can still go for it, I think. Hmm...&quot; Brock nodded, &quot;I got my fill of being filled, so now I feel like finding a hot lady friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lucas commented, &quot;Bisexuality&#39;s the best, eh? We get the best of both worlds. We fuck the hottest guys and the hottest gals.&quot;<br />
<br />
As much as Neil was conflicted about exactly how natural these shifts to his personality were, and whether he really was before this all started...he had to agree. &quot;Yeah, not gonna lie it&#39;s been really sweet, you know. Sandra, you guys...fuuuck, I feel great.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You down to join me in looking for some pussy tonight, big guy?&quot; Brock asked flirtatiously, &quot;You could be my wingman and more. Ain&#39;t nobody could have a bad time with a pair of bros like us.&quot; Neil knew that it was likely futile to try and point out Brock&#39;s age at least physically, so he decided to just go along with it as long as he could.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...yeah. That sounds like some fun.&quot; Neil grinned, wondering if a part of the transformation involved these two mellowing a bit. Sure seemed like they were less antagonistic than they were back when Neil was small and weak. They didn&#39;t even fuck around as they did before at the gym. Granted that was replaced with a new kind of fucking around, but that was neither here nor there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck, you guys sound like you&#39;re gonna have some fun,&quot; Lucas nodded as he too started getting dressed, &quot;Me and my girlfriend, maybe we could make a little tape. She&#39;s been asking if I&#39;m good with that kind of thing lately - now I&#39;m feeling like showing you guys what a stud I am on tape.&quot;<br />
<br />
Neil felt a weird sort of interest flare up in that sort of thing, &quot;Props to an open-minded GF.&quot;<br />
<br />
The three of them fist-bumped before Neil exited the steam room first, getting dressed again and noting as he walked past the wall-mounted mirror that his muscles seemed accentuated by the steam and heat - and definitely the slightest bit bigger, stronger looking - tone and size were really showing. If he had to guess, he&#39;d be a sure in at the soonest bodybuilding competition. He&#39;d need to look into when that might come about, and see if he could apply.<br />
<br />
As Neil headed out, he decided to test and see how many people more here might notice something was up.<br />
<br />
Bradley was right out - the enormous trainer was no longer overshadowing Neil. If anything, Neil was slightly bigger than him now if he had to guess. No alarm bells went off for Bradley, just it seemed some appreciation - and more - of how Neil had developed. And Bradley pulled Neil aside to talk to him as he approached the trainer. &quot;Good grief, man,&quot; Bradley commented as he looked Neil&#39;s shorts and stringer clad form over, &quot;You&#39;ve really put on size! I swear, keep it up and you&#39;ll completely leave me in the dust! I gotta hit the gym harder to try and catch up to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Neil was about to wonder if Bradley&#39;s sexuality changed even more when the trainer said, &quot;And we gotta meet up some time again. I swear, I never wanted a bro quite like when I look at you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Neil excused himself to continue looking around.<br />
<br />
The minted bodybuilder found himself listening in on the goings on at the gym. He could tell that the usual pairings of gym partners were quite a bit flirtatious today. Young men were talking about their girlfriends, while just as well talking about teaching each other some new methods of pleasing each other. A lean blond young man and his slightly older coach seemed to be barely keeping off of each other even when the coach discussed his wife not moments earlier.<br />
<br />
And of course, the progress was through the roof. Neil saw how men in here seemed to be accelerating through their development, growing stronger just as well as they grew more bold in their queer advances. This was growing to be a place of open flirtation. And Neil wondered how long it&#39;d take before the posing room ended up a bit sweatier, so to speak. Everyone here seemed to be advancing toward their goals with gusto.<br />
<br />
After a while, Neil decided to head out and see what he could do from here. Max it seemed had left already. Maybe he was enjoying his own fitness. As far as Neil was aware, Max was on day 6, meaning his curiosity was likely high, but not explicitly bisexual yet. And now, as Neil stepped out, he was left with a choice as he thought about this.<br />
<br />
The gym was obviously changing people quite a lot. And he doubted, going by how things went, that it would stop here. He pondered if it might take people all the way toward well, toward being gay. He was pretty happy with his body so far, and he knew the way it worked now it seemed - going into the gym initiated the change. And few people could tell that it was underway... so what would he do from here?<br />
<br />
But as Neil left to go enjoy his day, he saw Brock approaching him - now dressed in a tank top, workout pants, and a light jacket over the tank top, with a baseball cap on backward - evidently trying to hide his bald spot. &quot;Hey, Neil! I found some pretty sweet bars tonight! You down to hang out with yours truly and hit the scene tonight?&quot;<br />
<br />
Neil had never once engaged in that kind of life style before. Never gone to the bars, or nightclubs, or anything like that. It was for the guys who were so socially engaged it seemed, and probably not friendly to the wallflower boy with a thin build. But now, now Neil was anything but a thin wallflower. He didn&#39;t want to just get left in the dirt by people having fun any more. He actually found himself starting to feel quite a bit excited by the idea. Here he was, Neil Booth, about to go hang out with a guy who even a week ago had been nothing but a pain...and he was honestly excited by the idea.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. Yeah I think I&#39;m good to go.&quot; Neil smiled, and started heading off with Brock.<br />
<br />
Brock clapped Neil on the shoulder, leading the way toward his car, &quot;Good man! Trust me, nobody has a bad time on a crawl with Brock Medina.&quot;<br />
<br />
He&#39;d had enough of the life of a timid guy at the back of the room. Starting now, Neil Booth was gonna reinvent himself.</p>
