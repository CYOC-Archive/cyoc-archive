<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the two excited fourth graders raced downstairs they couldn’t help but giggle at their current situation. While Lisa was quite accustomed to being younger it was still a novel experience for Maddie. As the two gathere snacks Maddie was shocked to see how much smaller she had become. “Geez were short,” the sandy brown haired 10 year old exclaimed.<br />
<br />
Lisa turned, noticing as Maddie now stretched on tiptoes trythe no to reach a bag of chips. “Yeah That always used to weird me out too,” Lisa stated. “You don’t realize just how young and small you used to be until you go and try to grab something up high. Blows your mind when the simplest tasks turn into a chore.”<br />
<br />
“Tell me about,” Maddie groaned, stretching for a bag of tortilla chips. “Never would think twice about this. Now I think I might need a step stool.” Jumping the young girl now quickly grabbed the bag of chips befor turning towards Lisa. “Got our snacks,” she said happily. “And I found us a couple of sodas,” she responded. “Notice you don’t really have a lot.”<br />
<br />
“Not a big soda drinker,” Maddie said. “And I try to limit it for the boys.”<br />
<br />
“Understandable,” Lisa stated. “Most of the soda in my house is diet anyway, but what’s a movie without a big glass of soda.” Maddie smiled as she now grabbed some clean glasses out of the dishwasher. “Couldnt agree more.” As the girls now started the movie they found themselves sitting comfortably on the couch, soda and snacks in hand. It hadn’t taken Maddie long to find the Little Mermaid, much to Lisa’s delight. As the movie played Maddie stifled a giggle as Lisa belted out off key renditions of the movies soundtrack. “You weren’t kidding,” Maddie giggled. “You really were a huge fan.”<br />
<br />
Lisa blushed slightly, playfully throwing a piece of popcorn at her 10 year old friend. “Okay a bit embarrassing I know,” she smirked. “But cmon, what’s the fun in watching if you can’t sing a bit.”<br />
<br />
“Okay true,” Maddie conceded, trying to pull the blanket a bit tighter around herself. “Just wish we had a bigger blanket, think it’s really only good for one person.” Lisa nodded as she looked at the blanket the two girls were now sharing. The blanket itself was meant for a single adult. Even at their smaller size the two 10 year olds found they weren’t quite small enough to fit underneath it together. “True,” Lisa sighed. “Wish it was bigger.”<br />
<br />
“Or we were smaller,” Maddie smirked. Lisa’s eyes went wide as she gazed at the smiling girl. “Really you sure,” Lisa asked. “Don’t see why not,” Maddie shrugged. “I mean this is a kids movie. Think we would still like it if we were littler kids.”<br />
<br />
Lisa grinned ear to ear as she now held the ring out. “Okay Maddie,” she smirked. “Guess were growing down again.” Tingles now ran through both girls bodies as the ring began to glow once more. As the two girls looked over themselves they could see their bodies growing smaller. Hands and feet seemed to shrink as they retreated backwards through childhood. Maddie gasped as she looked down towards the floor, noticing both her and Lisa’s feet were now slowly lifting off the ground as they grew younger. As the tingles subsided Maddie looked over at Lisa surprised to see a redheaded 5 year old staring back at her. “Lisa were whittle,” she lisped, frowning her brow at her childish voice. “Yeah we weal whittle now,” Lisa giggled. “We only 5. So we in kindergarten.”<br />
<br />
“Or pre k,” Maddie whispered as she looked at her tiny hands. As the two young children now settled back onto the couch they found the once small blanket now easily covered the two children. “Well solves that problem,” Maddie squeaked. “Da blanket seems huge now.”<br />
<br />
“Yep sure does,” Lisa said with glee as she now happily ate her snack. As the two happy 5 year olds now get t into the movie they noticed how childish they were acting, singing along with every song while being totally entranced by the story. “Hey Lisa,” Maddie said. “This has been so much fun. We godda do dis again soon.”<br />
<br />
“I like da sound of dat,” Lisa said happily. “Always happy to have a girls night out.”<br />
<br />
“When you say girls night do ya mean girls night or ‘girls’ night,” Maddie giggled. Lisa grinned, shrugging her shoulders, she would be happy with either or. As the movie continued to play the two grown down adults not found themselves slowly trying out. Their young bodies not accustomed to staying up so late began to become drowsy. Nestling up to one another the two 5 year olds fell into a blissful slumber as the movie played on.<br />
<br />
Gloria was in a near panic as her father now pulls into Nate and Adams driveway. Not only had she lost the ring but Mrs. Haskins had discovered it. Despite Lisa’s text message saying everything was alright Gloria worried about things taking a turn for the worse. As she and Felicia lept from the car they asked their respective dates to stay behind. “So how bad you think it is,” Felicia asked. Gloria looked at her friend, a grim expression on her face. “Well it can’t be good,” she grumbled. “I mean Nate and Adams mom found the ring. Who knows what she and my mom have done. What if they altered reality? What if they got hurt? What if they forgot about being adults?”<br />
<br />
As the two 15 year olds raced to the front door their fears weren’t dissuaded by the fact it was unlocked. Quickly pushing the door open Felicia and Gloria raced inside, hearing the t.v. play in the other room. As they entered they paused, staring slack jawed at the couch. Two 5 year old girls lay under a blanket softly snoring as they cuddled up next to one another. While Gloria was relieved, Felicia couldn’t help but aww at the adorable sight. Quickly taking out her cell phone, she snapped a picture of the sandy brown and auburn haired girls. “Okay those two are adorable,” she sighed.<br />
<br />
Gloria frowned as she looked at her friend. “Yeah sure,” she grumbled. Looking over the two sleeping children Gloria noticed her ring, quietly picking it up before placing it back on her finger. “Well looks like nothing too bad happened,” she sighed. “So what should we do with them,” Felicia asked. <br />
<br />
“Why don’t you Cary Mrs. Haskins upstairs to her room,” Gloria said. “I’ll take my..um, mom out to her car. I’ll Age the two of them back before we leave.” Felicia nodded, picking up the tiny brunette who stirred slightly. As Felicia went upstairs Gloria could only smile and shake her head. She was sure she would be in for an earful tomorrow but she was pretty sure Maddie and Lisa just had the first of many play dates together.</p>
