<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Justin was halfway to the soccer field and he was thinking about what he would do: he could already do nothing against Stephen the jock, so against Stephen the alpha bodybuilder, he would not have the slightest chance. He already saw Stephen lift him with one hand and threaten to crush him. Crap, he swallows hard just thinking about it. If that happened, it would be the end for him! he had to prevent her from drinking the blue and red formula at all costs! Wait... blue and red formula? Suddenly an idea crossed his mind, he could have a chance to get out of it, no, even to turn the situation around in his favor but he had to go back to the lab! If Stephen had arrived before him, it would have been the end of his plan B and probably the end of his life also. However he wasn&#39;t sure it would work... He hesitated for a while. Fuck! This was his chance, his last chance to end years of bullying, he might not have another one: he HAD to try! Justin turned around and headed for the lab!<br />
<br />
He made several speeding tickets, something he would never have done normally but here, it was a matter of life and death. Soon after he arrived at his lab, he looked the parking and fortunately for him, Stephen&#39;s car was not here but he expected him to come, he had to hurry up! Well, his plan was simple: Stephen had drunk the yellow formula so Justin had still the blue and the red formula, his first idea was obviously to drink them but taken separately, maybe he would match Stephen but he wasn&#39;t really sure. But he SHOULD be sure! However he had another idea: the effect could be much stronger if the two were combined in a single new formula. He poured the two formulas into a large bottle and put it in a centrifuge. During the preparation, he heard a car pull up. His face fell: it was Stephen!<br />
<br />
&quot;SHIT! SHIT SHIT SHIT!&quot; he shouted. &quot;Faster, for fuck&#39;s sake, FASTER!&quot; he shouted, stressed. In less two minutes, Stephen will be here. Justin started to sweat profusely in shaking. Fortunately for him it was his lucky day: he heard the DING of the centrifuge meaning that the mixing was finished. He opened it quickly and took out the bottle. Without surprise, the content was purple, an intense and perfect purple as he had rarely seen. He looked at the bottle for a second and swallowed: he wasn&#39;t sure if it would work and if it did it would change his life forever... But there was no time for hesitation, if he did not take this risk now, he would soon face a real Hulk... it was out of the question! In a few sips, Justin drank the whole bottle. The taste was very stronger, not bad but clearly chemical.<br />
<br />
Almost instantly, Justin felt a tingling sensation, not unpleasant at first but it intensified quickly, very quickly! His heart began to beat faster and faster, stronger and stronger, making him pant faster and faster. He also felt his temperature rise, starting to sweat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aaaaaaaaaah shit!&quot; he moaned. he dropped the bottle which broke against the ground. His whole body was flexing, more and more, quickly, tingling became burning. he staggered a few steps. &quot;Aaaaaaaaaaahhh fuck!&quot; he said, as he began to cry from the pain. It was intense, much more intense than he thought! His legs could no longer hold him, he fell to his knees. &quot;Damn that hurts!&quot; he grunted.<br />
<br />
That&#39;s when he felt it! He felt his back stretching, widening, thickening! Slowly but he felt it! And it wasn&#39;t just his back; he felt also his flats pecs slowly pushing against the fabric, he felt also his non-existent abs to tighten more and more. At the level of his arms, he who was always floating in his tshirts, he felt them filling his sleeves.<br />
<br />
&quot;OH FUCK!&quot; he shouted, &quot;This is so... so... GOOD!&quot; he moaned painfully. However, his tone was quite different: where a few minutes ago, it was a tone filled of fear, here, it seemed clearly... enjoy it.<br />
<br />
&quot;OH MY GOD! GGGGGGGNNNNNNNHHHHHHHH YES! SO GOOD! OOOOOOOOOOHHHH FUCK YES! MORE! OH YES MORE!!!&quot; he said in laughing. For the first time in his life, he felt something totally new: his clothes became too small. He could clearly hear the sound of his shirt stretching. The same thing was happening to his pants: he felt his legs swelling, filling his pants and slowly stretching the fabric.<br />
<br />
&quot;OH SHIT HAHAHAHAHAHA! It feels so so GOOD!!! MORE!!! OH GOD PLEASE, MORE!!!&quot; moaned Justin in laughing.<br />
<br />
Yes, very clearly and despite the pain, he LOVED it and he knew it was only the beginning.<br />
<br />
The entire room was filled with grunting, ripping, moaning and laughing of Justin. The skinny Justin was disappearing, he was becoming a beast, no better, a god, A FUCKING MUSCLE GOD!<br />
<br />
Suddenly he heard Stephen&#39;s steps. He usually dreaded seeing him, knowing that he might be beaten, but this was the very first time he was eager to see him: Stephen was going to assist to the birth of a god, his god, and it will be him, this time who will be totally powerless!<br />
<br />
&quot;JUSTIN!&quot; shouted Stephen, in a tone that is both impatient and threatening, &quot;I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re doing with your little experiments but you&#39;re going to make me more, MUCH MORE!&quot; he shouted. Then he finally entered the room. The bulk-up was visible, it was like he had the best pump of his life but he wanted more than that, much more.<br />
<br />
&quot;JUSTIN! WHERE ARE Y..&quot; shouted Stephen when suddenly, he saw Justin on the ground, grunting in pain.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the...?&quot; said Stephen, surprised and thinking at first that Justin was feeling unwell. But then he saw the broken vial on the ground and he immediately understood.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bastard! FUCKING BASTARD! Do you really think you can overtake me? You think you can take the piss out of me? THIS FORMULA IS MINE!!!&quot; shouted Stephen, in anger. He came forward in anger and wanted to beat up Justin. However, his fist was stopped by Justin&#39;s hand. Stephen was surprised by the strength.<br />
<br />
&quot;No gnnnnnnnhhhhhhh! You have... aaaaaaaaahhhhhhh... been laughing at me all these years! Yeah, I&#39;m going to... ggggggggggnnnnnnnnhhhhhhhh... OVERTAKE YOU! From far, FAR AWAY! I can feel it! GNNNNNNNNHHHHHHHH! It&#39;s coming!&quot; said Justin. Then he got back on his knees, still holding Stephen&#39;s fist.<br />
<br />
Stephen was stunned: in front of him, it was not the skinny Justin he knew, his clothes looked more like a compression shirt now, revealing two big pecs, a set of six boulders implanted under his skin, a V shape with wide lats, bull neck, rounded shoulders, massive but ripped guns. The guy in front of him looked more like a pro bodybuilder than a skinny than a shrimp. And he had the strength of a bull! It couldn&#39;t be Justin!<br />
<br />
&quot;Surprised Stephen? Then you&#39;re going to be even more so because this... this is just the appetizer!&quot; said Justin, a wry smile. Indeed, he felt an increased pressure he was going to become more muscular, MUCH MORE!<br />
<br />
&quot;Hehehe! Get ready Stephen! Get ready because You will have the honor of attending to my rising!&quot;<br />
<br />
Justin&#39;s eyes widened, he was about to explode, it was imminent!<br />
<br />
&quot;OH FUCK IT&#39;S COMING! IT&#39;S COMING! I&#39;M GOING TOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Justin roared while his muscles &quot;exploded&quot;. Tears began to appear everywhere, no longer able to contain the growing muscle mass. He raised his head to the sky, his whole body was flexed, the veins were clearly visible. Stephen could see it, he could see with the naked eye Justin&#39;s muscles inflate.<br />
<br />
&quot;OH MY GOD HAHAHAHAHAHA!!! BIGGER! OH FUCK YES BIGGER HAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!&quot; laughed Justin, drunk with power.<br />
<br />
And as if his body was listening he began to grow, and grow, and grow, AND GROW! As much to say that the clothes did not resist very long. After a few &quot;muscle-plosion&quot; they were shredded, leaving Justin naked and giving a magnificent view of his growing muscular body. Stephen looked with horror the old shrimp becoming Hulk. His biceps was enormous, bigger than anything he had ever seen. His traps had risen like a mountain, engulfing its neck. His shoulders looked more like cannonballs. His pecs were so big that they were beginning to block his view on his awesome midsection! And in talking about his abs: eight, eight fucking huge bricks, each was bigger than Stephen&#39;s fist and seemed as hard as concrete, it was better not to hit them or he would break his phalanges! His back was fucking wide, so much so that it would probably have trouble getting through the front doors. His arms, for fuck&#39;s sake, his arms were bigger than Stephen&#39;s head, with a vein the size of his finger! Stephen gulped, he would swear Justin was able to lift his car easily. His legs were fucking redwoods, his quads were so huge that he probably couldn&#39;t stick his feet together without his quads touching each other. And of course, let&#39;s not forget the crotch; his cock looked more like a third arm.<br />
<br />
Then finally, Justin&#39;s screams died down and he was panting loudly, his body dripping with sweat, strongly accentuating his awesome musculature.<br />
<br />
&quot;OH MY FUCKING GOD! IT WAS... SO GOOD!&quot; he said. Damn, even his voice was totally different: strong, deep, powerful! He posed his hand on his gigantic pecs, feel them and went down and then passed over his hard eight-pack. He saw an iron bar on the ground, took it and bent it with extreme ease. A broad smile appeared on his face: finally, finally he was the fucking muscle god that he had always dreamed! Muscle, strength, power! He had everything! the combined effect of the two formulas was much more important than he thought but no matter, he loved the result, he fucking loved the result! Well, now, it was time to take his revenge on the sons of bitches who had treated him like shit for years!<br />
<br />
Justin found the strength to stand up. Stephen&#39;s face broke down as he saw the monster get up. Justin was fucking more muscular, fucking more stronger but also fucking more taller than him. He must have been 6 feet 8 inches tall, maybe more.<br />
<br />
Justin flexed his arms in front of Stephen, showing his monumental biceps.<br />
<br />
&quot;So Stephen, what do you think of your new god?&quot; asked badly Justin.<br />
<br />
Stephen swallows hard...</p>
