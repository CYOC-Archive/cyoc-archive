<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Are you ready for tonight?&quot;<br />
<br />
It was a text from Mark. Tonight was his and Eric(a)&#39;s three month anniversary. He had planned on spending the evening at a fancy dinner place before heading to his place for late night fun. <br />
<br />
&quot;Absolutely, baby. But make sure to pick me up at 5:00. I have a surprise for you &#10084;&#65039;&quot; Erick replied with a devious grin, thinking about how they&#39;re going to have so much fun tonight.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Mark had just pulled into the driveway at Erica&#39;s place. The reservation at the restaurant wasn&#39;t for another hour and a half, but Erica sounded like she had come up with something before then. Mark was looking forward to seeing what this &quot;surprise&quot; was. <br />
<br />
Mark approached the front door and knocked, but there was no answer. He used his spare key to get in and found the place lit by candlelight and a trail of rose petals leading upstairs. &quot;Wow, I guess tonight&#39;s fun is starting earlier than I thought&quot; Mark said to himself before following the trail. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh baby, you didn&#39;t have to do all this for me&quot; he says at the top of the stairs. He&#39;s already taken off his shoes by the time he&#39;s reached the end of the trail of roses in front of Erica&#39;s bedroom door. He gingerly opens the door anticipating what he&#39;s about to see, but absolutely nothing could have prepared him for what was waiting. Splayed out on the bed was a hulking figure of a lion, head proped up by a gloved hand with a rose held between it&#39;s large sharp teeth and a golden mane cascading across the sheets. Its body was huge, clearly straining the very bed it lay on, and it&#39;s legs spread apart, letting a long, meaty, semi-erect cock dangle out between them, it bobbing in rhyme with his heartbeat. And the whole scene is made more bizarre by being drawn like a cartoon with vibrant colors and thick lines of black ink outlining contours.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh honey, it&#39;s so good you&#39;re here; I&#39;ve had this itch that only you can scratch for hours!&quot; The muscular predator says, gesturing at his twitching dick. Mark almost stumbles over himself as he backs away from what ever this is. &quot;Baby, what&#39;s going on?&quot; Mark shouts to the house with more than a little quiver in his voice, hoping to hear a response from another room. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, honey, you sound upset! Here, let big papa Eric take care of you&quot; the beast said before pouncing towards Mark. In an instant, Mark is flung to the floor, pinned down, and hog tied. &quot;Don&#39;t worry about going anywhere for dinner, I&#39;ve whipped up something special for us!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark is lifted into the air and is swiftly carried down stairs to the dining room and placed at one end of the table (and somehow tied to the chair). Before him on the table is a marvelous spread, fit for a thanks giving feast, including a roster boar over a fire pit. And all of it was also straight out of a cartoon; Mark is positive that he would have seen or smelled this on the way into the house had it been prepared here already; it&#39;s more like it popped into existence only as soon as it became relevant. <br />
<br />
The lion sits at the other end of the table, although atop a throne instead of a chair; king of the jungle and all that. &quot;Please, by all means, dig in&quot; he insists. However, even if Mark wanted to, his arms are still tied to his sides. &quot;Oh, how rude of me. Let me help,&quot; Erick says before carving the boar with his own claws (which looks conspicuously similar to another well known toon boar) and serving a slice onto Mark&#39;s plate. Mark watches &quot;Erick&quot;, as he called himself, as he makes his way around the table serving his own plate, delicately portioning each entree, before take his seat again. With knife and fork in paw, Erick drops the utensils on the floor and dives into his plate face first. It&#39;s facinating and disturbing at the same time, like when the predator gets the prey in a nature documentary. <br />
<br />
Mark not feeling particularly hungry after watching that, Mark hazards a question about something weighing on his mind, &quot;So, uh... Erick?&quot;. The lion&#39;s ears perk up and looks at Mark. &quot;You wouldn&#39;t have done anything to my girlfriend, wouldn&#39;t you?&quot; Erick spits out the wine he was drinking in shock and alarm, &quot;you have a girlfriend?! Why haven&#39;t I met her before?! Have you been cheating on me!?!&quot; Apparently bringing this up was a bad move, but at least it sounds like he hasn&#39;t hurt her. Erick looks at the panicked Mark expectantly, but the a light bulb appears above Erick&#39;s head, &quot;oooh, I get it! That&#39;s a good one, Mark. Your really funny, trying to trick me like that.&quot; He gives an honest bellow laugh. <br />
<br />
&quot;But please, eat! Then we can make this night really special.&quot; Mark isn&#39;t sure what Erick means by that and was nervous, but it felt like an even worse idea to reject his offer again. Mark, still bound, bends down to his plate like he saw Erick do. He licks the slab of toon boar meat, perfectly pink and uniformly cooked, and is immediately amazed at how good it tastes. Oddly, it would be hard to describe what it tastes like, only that it&#39;s the purest distillation of good food made manifest as a hunk of meat. And it&#39;s intoxicating. Mark immediately bites into it, wanting the warm juices in his mouth. Unknowingly to Mark, his mouth started to change. He&#39;s already finding tarring the meat apart easier as his teeth become sharp and push out into a muzzle. By the time he&#39;s licking the plate clean, his black nose is pushed up against it, long slobbery tongue sticking out of a body about, colored in brown and black speckles. <br />
<br />
Without having to ask, another plate with a second helping is shoved in front of him. He goes to town, not really registering that he&#39;s not tied to the chair anymore as he grips the edge of the table and chows down. His grip leaves claw marks, his bare feet are lifted up as puffy pads form under them, and a tail wags gleefully. &quot;Hehehe, this is really good grub&quot; he says between mouthfuls, unable to contain is joyous laughter. At the end of his second plate, Mark leans back an pats his swollen tummy, the spitting image of a toon hyena, dressed in slacks and nice shirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope you left room for desserts&quot; Erick announce as he stands up and yet again presents his giant member. Only this time when Mark looks at it, his large eyes dilate, turn pink and are in the shape of hearts. &quot;Aooga! Move over because that train is coming to station!&quot; Mark gets up onto the table and crawls next to Erick on all fours. He gives the cock a long sniff, running his bulbus nose along the shaft, before planting a kiss at it&#39;s tip. Surprisingly, it tastes just like the meat from earlier, and Mark dives onto it just as eagerly. Mark bobs his head forward and back, savoring the taste and feeling full of energy. Before long, Mark starts changing again: his nice button down shirt he had worn for his dinner date strained from the pressure of the mussels growing underneath. it bursts at the seems into tatters as Mark&#39;s pecs quickly outgrow it. He changes his position to sit on his haunches, grabbing Erick&#39;s sides with meaty gloved hands attacked to arms as thick as tree trunks. His toes grow fatter and wider to keep up with his thickening legs, all while his wagging tail clears off the surface of the table.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope- huff- your ready- puff- for the best part&quot; Erick warns. Mark braces himself as a fire hose is turned on in his mouth. His muzzle bulks up the contain the seed flowing through it, and his lips become fat and vacuum tight around the dick. The flood spills down Mark&#39;s throat, visible bulges flowing down his neck in time with the pulsating of Erick&#39;s member. With each drop swallowed, Mark&#39;s own cock surges forward, first extending to one foot, then two, and finally four feet before he too stats spasming, coating the table beneath and in front of him in cum. <br />
<br />
Mark slides off the lion dick with a pop and chuckles, &quot;hehehehe, oh baby! This was such a great surprise! Thanks for making this the best three month anniversary I&#39;ve ever had!&quot;</p>
