<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Jake stood in the isolated back isle perusing the sex toys, he noticed that it was suddenly very warm inside the store.<br />
<br />
“This is weird…” he thought. <br />
<br />
He had been walking all day and his feet were aching something fierce, so he kicked off his sandals, stretching his toes against the cold floor. It was even warmer in here, was that even possible? His legs were aching now too, and he felt the slight dull thickness spreading all over his body. He felt strange… was he getting sick? A drop of sweat ran down his brow. He had to get out of here, it was boiling. Jake looked around for his sandals, seeing them further down the hall in front of the dildo wall display. He walked over barefoot and bent over to pick them up. Another wave of dizziness hit him and he doubled over, collapsing against the wall.<br />
<br />
“What was going on?” He said to himself as he looked up at the ceiling trying to find a source of the heat. There was really no reason why he should feel so warm, but it was overwhelming. His legs didn’t seem to be working, they felt like rocks.<br />
<br />
As waves of dizziness and that strange thick sensation hit him, Jake heard a slight tearing sound. He looked down and saw that his shorts were slightly tearing at the legs? What was this? His legs were… merging together? That was impossible but they were just the same, the separation between the legs was slowly filling in, moving down his thighs from his torso, now increasingly one single thigh! <br />
<br />
“Have to get out of here…” Jake mumbled as he tried to pull himself up before more dizziness hit and the room started to… grow? His perspective was changing as the glass cases and walls began to stretch high above him, the floor expanding outwards in front of him. His tank top felt loose and he realized he was shrinking out of his ripping clothes! He tried to scream, but now a wave of pleasure hit him as his chest began to bulge, then retract, bulge and retract in different places. It felt so good, but it also felt like his body was thickening, becoming more dense and immobile. Jake stared at his feet as they cracked, bulged and condensed together, and were now actually shrinking towards his thickening torso!<br />
<br />
His arms went limp, falling to his sides as his shoulders cracked as they began to condense into his body. He should have felt pain, but there was only the pleasurable numbness. He repositioned himself, letting his body fall over away from the wall into the tangled mass of tank top, shorts and underwear. He pulled his single leg appendage up towards his chest and felt it lock in place, his knee bones dissolving and holding his lower body in a crouching position. His arms, now at his sides, began to sink into his morphing torso, which was expanding in the front and back to create a more cylindrical shape.<br />
<br />
His head fell back as it sunk into his neck, removing all but a small separation from his chin and his finishing torso which was rapidly shrinking to only the diameter of his head. His legs were drawing up, swelling into two round orb-like shapes. His feet were flattening into some sort of stand? His arms had completely sunk into his body now, more closely resembling some sort of thick veins.<br />
<br />
As his hair pulled into his head, Jake found his head pulling back and locking into a looking upright position. His facial bones began to dissolve, his cheeks and face pleasurably pushing and swelling upwards and his cleft chin stretched to cover the increasing distance from his mouth to his softened chin. His nose sunk into his face, his mouth swelled until it was merely a small indent at the tip of his head. The thickening feeling all over his body was completely overwhelming. His new balls finished swelling and settled into their shape, thickening into hard plastic. His stand flattened on the bottom, now fully functional. Jake was lost in pleasure and the throbbing as his mind cleared of all thought and swelled into the silicone plastic substance his body had rapidly reduced into. His eyes closed as his head finished swelling into a cockhead shape, the small indent of his former mouth now located at the top. The dildo shuddered as it darkened from Jake’s skin tone to a more fake plastic color.<br />
<br />
Where Jake had been moments ago, a 12 inch dildo, still throbbing, lay in the small pile of clothes. The clothes now began to sink into themselves, melting into a transparent sheen. The underwear flattened, turning to a thick cardboard with a hole around the dildo. The transparent sheen oozed up from underneath the dildo and cardboard, wrapping over top of them and over them. It encased them and then tightened firmly around them. It was a good thing Jake no longer needed to breathe, so tightly was his new packaging protecting him from theft. A plastic hook curled out of the top of the package, and the dildo throbbed one more time before freezing as a completely inanimate object. The words “JAKE” and “LIFE SIZE 12’’ DILDO” appeared on the cardboard, along with a grinning picture of a shirtless, human Jake holding a dildo.<br />
<br />
The dildo laid on the floor for a few minutes until the shopkeeper wandered into the back room.<br />
<br />
“What are you doing on the ground?” He said out loud. He picked up the package and hung it from an empty display hook on the wall.</p>
