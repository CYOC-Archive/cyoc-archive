<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">(AN: Sorry, Saturday is my social night.) <br />
<br />
'Leslie! Will you cut that out?' Nelson said (having become male again as to be a <br />
counter part to Helen for the moment as there were just two of them for the moment <br />
on the fountain). <br />
<br />
'I'm just introducing myself,' Thought the lupman love doll now laying next to the four <br />
leoman love dolls.<br />
<br />
'And I thought Kira was the kinky one in our pack.' Helen thought.<br />
<br />
'I just want to be able to speak on their level, that's all.' Leslie protested, <br />
<br />
'And?' Nelson asked, as his stone form was in the shape of a passionate kiss with <br />
Helen. <br />
<br />
'They're really into each other, I mean, REALLY into each other, took a minute for me to <br />
get a word in edgewise. They love the change in scenery, but love each other more. <br />
They've apparently never been used, and they don't like the idea of making love to <br />
anyone but each other...'<br />
<br />
Kira quipped over the mental network, 'What did you expect from love dolls?' <br />
<br />
'Not much.' Leslie admitted, 'But I felt it was proper for me to just say alone since <br />
they're humanoid forms with souls like us. They claim they've always been love dolls <br />
but you know the curse.'<br />
<br />
'We ALL do.' Nelson reminded her. <br />
<br />
'Right... Apparently they weren't made in a main factory but at some alternate source. <br />
But they're great quality, they look like they could take a car crash and survive.' <br />
<br />
'Will you just hurry along before a bored fur-head comes along and decides to role play <br />
with you?' Helen thought. She didn't mind she was basically on display for people to <br />
oogle and look at, that was what art was FOR. But being someone's sex toy, that was <br />
counted as violation her book. <br />
<br />
'Right, right.' And the fountain became a trio of naked super busty lupman woman <br />
again made to over 100% scale made as a small alter some considered to Alpha <br />
Kaylee's anime fetish. <br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;I still can't believe you and your mate and sister wives were all willing to just turn <br />
yourselves into giant sized busty solid gold statues of naked anime girls.&quot; Penny said <br />
as the battle between Sonia and Umeko had reached a stand still. <br />
<br />
&quot;It was our choice, and it was for our Alpha Female.&quot; Umeko said simply. <br />
<br />
&quot;But isn't that kind of demeaning? And lonely?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We were treated with respect by our pack mates and Alpha Kaylee like that, and it's <br />
not like were dead or trapped all alone, we could speak with each other and hide our <br />
thoughts from each other freely. And it was to serve and honor the Alpha, therefore, to <br />
honor and serve the pack, therefore, to honor and serve the greater good. Therefore, it <br />
was our obligation and duty to do so.&quot;<br />
<br />
Penny wondered if she'd ever fully understand the Japanese wolves. <br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you?&quot; Kaylee asked the pup made of glass, yet obviously was not any of her <br />
mate's pups. <br />
<br />
&quot;I am Marie-Eliza. Or Simply Marie. I took a middle name unlike other Lupman when I <br />
joined spiritually with my mother. My birth mother. The one who actually loved and <br />
raised me. Not the shadow of the witches insanity that became aware and named itself <br />
Kurse. <br />
<br />
After you daughter was freed, Kurse grabbed the first child she got her hands on and <br />
turned that child into a new Glass... with Kurse dead, all her power is mine, as her place <br />
as the awareness of the game, for as long it exists at any rate, neither my power or my <br />
life is connected to it's continued existence.<br />
<br />
I am also as the witches SAW themselves, thinking of others, benevolent, justified, <br />
honorable, righteous, not as they actually were. Much like the witches adopted <br />
daughter was an 'idealized' human being with literally infinite empathy and compassion <br />
since she was created via their revisionist memories of a friend of theirs.  And you two <br />
should start embracing and nuzzling each other tuning out nearly all other things until <br />
myself and Madam Serenity are done speaking.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Alphas immediately did as told. <br />
<br />
Serenity glared at her, &quot;There was no reason to do that! I've already told them about <br />
the love dolls.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There is enough chaos swimming through this poor town as it is. No need to add to <br />
it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you're not from around here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Other side of the planet. Of the people kidnapped from the boat Kurse took.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't speak with an Austrian accent.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Neither did Glass.... I'm sorry... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For what happened. I tried to force reality to let them keep their souls...I trust you <br />
learned what really happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Reality backlashed at me.  But I do think that since Penny's power when restoring <br />
people make them always having been Leoman, it'll likely give them lives back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Might be simpler to simply leave them as they are...&quot; Serenity knew how awful that <br />
sounded.   <br />
<br />
&quot;There is a turn in flux, one of the by laws of the game is that no matter what changes <br />
are made to reality, a turn can not be 'realitied out' it must always remains in existence <br />
with the person asked the question. But those four according to reality have always <br />
been as they are, and thus could not logically have a turn... I think the sooner you give <br />
them to Penny so they can give them complete existences at Leoman the better, least <br />
reality decides they're an unsolvable paradox and have a meteorite drop from the sky <br />
and atomize them.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;.... I see.&quot; Serenity at once called up Gill on speed dial. And got a female voice. <br />
<br />
&quot;It's Madam Serenity, is Gill in?&quot;<br />
<br />
There was some tiny heard sounds of sobs on the other end before, &quot;I am Gillian.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
A storm of swearwords followed, which Serenity slowly dug through to find out that <br />
Penny had freed Gillian's grandfather (at last!) of being a teapot, but a side effect of <br />
cause and effect and the gender ratio of Leomans caused Gill to change species and <br />
gender... <br />
<br />
Gill recounted the events regarding Jaccob and the idea of using Hypnosis to finally lay <br />
this misery to rest after the game was dead. <br />
<br />
The words were out before Serenity thought o them, &quot;I never pegged you for coward <br />
Gill. Or that you wanted to leave me all alone. I remember everything as it used to be <br />
too remember?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;NOT EVERYTHING!&quot; The leoman roared at the other end, &quot;You were cursed AFTER me <br />
Serenity! You make think you know what reality is but I still remember things that no <br />
longer happened, and don't remember things that now did happen... &quot;<br />
<br />
Madam Serenity wondered if a 'true reality' even existed anymore since the use of the <br />
game. <br />
<br />
&quot;... I... I need Penny's address... do you have it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Gillie grumbled and told Serenity the number. Serenity offered a few apologizes that <br />
Gillie begrudgingly accepted and the two hung up. <br />
<br />
'It's funny,' Madam Serenity thought, 'When I was originally cursed, I threw a fit over the <br />
decades that left me a teenage woman almost as much as I threw a fit over have my Y <br />
chromosome stolen... losing my original ethnic heritage was just the icing on the <br />
cake... But here I am, old age finally having caught up with me after the curse gave me <br />
a second head start... And this time no curse, magic, alchemy, or technology in the <br />
world can change it, ' <br />
<br />
Marie-Eliza and her avatar with Serenity said,  &quot;You can either have a fair world, or an <br />
equal world. You can not have both. That is a truth the witches refused to realize.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;This from someone who can make something out of nothing.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Mana is born from the use of mana, it's neglect of use causes it's to shrink, and it <br />
presence is a by product of existence itself. Thus why mana can be expressed as just <br />
about anything. Not just Fire, Wind, Earth and Water, as the earliest mages thought. <br />
Electricity, Time, Space, Light, Dark, Gravity, Magnetic Force, the list is effectively <br />
infinite.  Science is the expression of the infinite order, mana, or magic are the <br />
expressions of the ininite chaos, alchemy falls between the two.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
Madam Serenity wasn't sure how much of that she understand, except for the last part, <br />
being an alchemist herself. <br />
<br />
&quot;I think I'll be going, if what you say is true, the sooner I get the love dolls leoman the <br />
better.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank... I think I'll be going now.&quot; Her avatar vanished. And Jesen and Kaylee stopped <br />
nuzzling. Madam Serenity said her goodbyes to the Alphas making her way back to her <br />
car. <br />
<br />
+++++++++++<br />
<br />
Marie-Eliza said, &quot;Some of the child familiars did go on to become fairly decent seers, <br />
or mages ... for as long as magic lasted on Earth outside of Glendale with the curse <br />
eating it all up to fuel the changes to reality.... However, even as LSD laced fruit grew <br />
wild, maturing and ready to eat within hours in Glendale to provide... Those with the <br />
carnivores habit things were looking even more twisted.&quot; <br />
<br />
1689 <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, at the lupman estate... it was bedlam. Without a human like Monica, or a <br />
leoman like Rosa, the lupman were left nearly totally to their fate as the witches curse <br />
effected the as well. <br />
<br />
&quot;Look at everyone!&quot; Laughed one of the brightly colored lupmans, now some years <br />
older. While the rest of the pack was regressing like leaps and bounds, even the alpha <br />
female looked like she had never been pregnant, and was no longer an age that she'd <br />
be taking a mate anyway. And the way she perked up about it was down right ALIEN! <br />
<br />
The two twin Omegas, spawned from one person and created by the witches magic, <br />
were immune, and driven by pure absolute and total loyalty that was stronger than any <br />
natural pack instinct, worked tirelessly and relentless to provide as they could. <br />
<br />
The silver omega twins were also immune being in their own way a creation of the <br />
witches themselves, and the colored lupman pups being partially immune due to their <br />
earlier experience with the witches (though they had no clue what so ever that they <br />
three nice lupman women who had given them their unique fur color were the witches).  <br />
<br />
The colored pup were drafted by the two omegas into helping... for as long as they <br />
lasted until they rejoined the rest of the pack in the fast track back to childhood.  The <br />
two silver omegas twins, did not try to think about what they would do then once their <br />
helpers had regressed as well. <br />
<br />
&quot;We can not hope to provide or look after a Big Bad Wolf Pack sized litter by ourselves.&quot; <br />
Said one sister to the other. <br />
<br />
&quot;I know, but for the Pack, we must endure as well as we are able, and hope for a clear <br />
dawn at the end of the storm.&quot;</p>
