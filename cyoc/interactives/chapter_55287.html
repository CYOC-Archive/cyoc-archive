<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next morning was a normal one for Jen. She woke up, rubbed the <br />
sleep out of her eyes, stood up and fell down. After a few moments Jen <br />
realized the cause, <br />
so she removed her breasts and put them into storage, leaving <br />
Jessica's on her body. Jen got dressed and noticed that her shirt was <br />
tighter than usual. 'Oh <br />
well,' Jen thought as she headed down the stairs for breakfast. The <br />
bus arrived and Jen got on. The bus ride was uneventful, and she soon <br />
arrived at school. <br />
School was a jumble of people, and Jen almost didn't make it to her <br />
first period. In first period, she saw the rudest jock in the school, <br />
Quentin. Smirking as <br />
everyone got settled down, Jen walked over to Quentin, unzipped his <br />
pants, and pulled on his huge cock. It came off without a sound, and <br />
Jen decided it would <br />
gop into storage, whatever that meant. Immediately, the dick she held <br />
in her hands disappeared. A bit startled, but still maintaining her <br />
composure, she took <br />
her seat. Class was mostly boring, and she was glad when second period <br />
came.<br />
<br />
Jen's second period class had the most annoying girl (to Jen) in the <br />
whole school, Samantha Adams. Samantha was one of the cheer captains, <br />
and was more popular <br />
than her. Forming a plan, Jen executed it by going over in front of <br />
her and stealing all of her right hand fingers. Jen knew what she was <br />
going to do with them <br />
after school, so she put them in storage. Jen contemplated taking her <br />
other fingers, but she wasn't that cruel. Instead, she took her seat <br />
and attended class. <br />
Third period came slower than usual because Jen was contemplating all <br />
the things she would do with the things she stole.<br />
<br />
Third period was Jen's least favorite period because the sluttiest <br />
girl in the whole school was there. Even thinking about her name gave <br />
Jen shivers. Jen went <br />
over to her and pulled out her left hand fingers one by one. They too <br />
went into the 'storage,' and Jen sat in class. The slut-girl would <br />
always get called on <br />
instead of Jen and give the wrong answer. Jen knew the right answer <br />
(most of the) all the time. Fourth period, Lunch, Fifth, and Sixth <br />
period went by and Jen <br />
was on the bus home. She could hardly contain herself.<br />
<br />
When she got home, Jen rushed upstairs to her room and locked the <br />
door. From there she sat on the bed and undressed completely. <br />
Remembering her plan from <br />
earlier, she moved her feet so she could reach them, and took all the <br />
toes off. From there, she worked about an inch from each of her feet <br />
off. 'Now,' Jen <br />
thought, 'how to access the storage...' With that, a tray with all the <br />
body parts she had collected were in front of her. She saw her two <br />
breasts, the cock she <br />
stole from Quentin, and the fingers she took from those annoying <br />
girls. She took the pinkie finger of the right hand and placed it on <br />
her foot where her pinkie <br />
toe was. That finger gained dexterity, so she took the next one. Soon, <br />
her right foot's toes were completely replaced with fingers. She did <br />
the same with the <br />
left foot as well. Taking one of her shoes experimentally, she slipped <br />
it on her foot, and it fit perfectly. Using her modified feet to grab <br />
things was amazing <br />
and strange at the same time. Jen had a ball typing with her feet, and <br />
writing on a whiteboard that she kept next to her bed. 'This is so <br />
AMAZING!' Jen <br />
thought. Jen could read books with them if she sat in fetal position, <br />
using her regular hands to turn the pages. 'And it all fits!' Jen <br />
squealed in her head, <br />
'I am keeping this forever.'<br />
<br />
Jen still had a lot of time left in her day so she put her clothes and <br />
shoes on and went to the mall. There was a fitness program <br />
demonstration going on, and a <br />
bunch of really ripped guys were there. Jen looked on at one <br />
especially ripped guy in particular and came up with a plan. She <br />
walked up onstage (nobody noticed <br />
of course) and took the man's arms off. Both immediately went into her <br />
storage, so she went home to test her plan. Going back upstairs, she <br />
took her jeans and <br />
panties off, and called up her storage. The man's extremely muscled <br />
arms were sitting there. They called to her, so she took both of them <br />
with some effort, and <br />
placed them on the floor. Sitting down, Jen reached down and removed <br />
her feet from her legs. Jen then removed her legs from her pelvis, <br />
taking the arms she had <br />
stolen and after making sure they were facing the right way, she <br />
attached them to her pelvis where her legs had been. She put her feet <br />
on the new limbs and <br />
stood up. Walking was a little funny but she got used to it. She could <br />
also jump incredibly high with these arms-for-legs, and decided that <br />
they would be nice. <br />
Also, she had a wider range of motions with these new legs-for-arms <br />
with her hand/feet than with her regular legs. 'This is a keeper!' Jen <br />
thought to herself, <br />
and went to bed.</p>
