<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Chad why are you wearing a jockstrap? I thought you were a cheerleader.  Didn&#39;t your dad make it so all the Glendale cheerleaders were men in kilts.&quot; Kyle said.  <br />
<br />
&quot;He may have made that rule but I&#39;m not on that faggy shit.&quot; Chad said with a scoff.   Kyle smiled to himself realizing that the bitchy head cheerleader, Jennifer was now a bitchy male named Jimmy who loved doing back handsprings to show off the junk under his kilt.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh your right, you&#39;re way to short for that.&quot; Kyle said with a smirk noting to himself that the bottom half of the mascot costume  had indeed changed to a kilt.  &quot;Achondroplasia is a bitch isn&#39;t it. You&#39;re only 3 feet tall.&quot; Kyle said.  <br />
<br />
Chad&#39;s jockstrap dropped off as his body compressed.  He was now a dwarf with a 13 inch long cock.  His dick now rested against the floor.  Chad tried to pick up the floppy appendage but it was a really too much for his shortened arms to hold up.  <br />
<br />
Kyle looked at him disdainfully.  &quot;You&#39;re a clumsy little guy aren&#39;t you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad was going to say something but trying to wrangle his dick caused him to lose balance.  He fell back on his bottom and his cock smacked him in the face.  <br />
<br />
&quot;A lot of guys might dream about having a dick big enough to trip over but you do and it isn&#39;t easy.  It&#39;s amazing how calloused and dirty that thing is from constantly dragging the ground.&quot; <br />
<br />
Chad picked up the fleshy appendage.  The rough gray skin made it look more like a trunk than a sexual organ.  From a sitting position, he played with it trying to get some response from the deadened nerves.   <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t wear yourself out trying to get it hard.&quot; Kyle said.  &quot;It doesn&#39;t get erect.  I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s because you&#39;ve got so little blood in your tiny body or if because your constantly dragging it on the floor but you are completely impotent.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad gave up.  Then Kyle said, your mom and dad thought about getting it surgically reduced but it&#39;s kind of like your security blanket.  Whenever you get worked up, you just pop it into your mouth and calm right down.  You suck yourself to sleep with it every night.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad remembered drifting off to sleep with the dirty member lodged in his mouth.  Tasting the smegma and the dirt from the ground as his nightly ritual.  He started to get upset that Kyle was telling all his private business in front of all the guys.  He pulled the tip of his dick to his mouth and gave it a couple nursing sucks.   <br />
<br />
Kyle looked at Chad with hatred.  It was time to make things even worse.  &quot;Chad you&#39;ve always gotten by on your daddy&#39;s power and influence.  But from now on, when your around other people, they&#39;re going to feel inclined to give you a pass because they pity you. Whenever you&#39;re in a room with another person, you&#39;re going to act like a goofy idiot.  Spelling your name is about the height of your ability.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle stopped talking because Chad had started having a tantrum, striking the floor with his little fists.  <br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, no. Remember that if you act up in public, everyone is comfortable giving you a barebottomed spanking.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad stopped his fit.  He remembered classmates, teachers, his parents, everyone pulling him over their  knee when he misbehaved.<br />
<br />
&quot;As I was saying, in a room with another person, you&#39;re a moron without a lot of concern for what&#39;s going on.   When you&#39;re  alone, you&#39;ll think and act like you normally do and be able to remember all the dumb shit you&#39;ve done. You&#39;ll even remember how you used to look.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad looked at him and dully said, &quot;I&#39;m not a dummy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You may not be but you&#39;re going to find it impossible to prove that to anyone you&#39;re around.&quot; Kyle said. <br />
<br />
Chad shook his head and started to get upset again.  He sniffled a bit and then took a coupe of suckles off of his dick.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Another thing, Kyle said I know you&#39;re a goofy klutz and I think your going to find it difficult being at crotch level with everyone.  If you trip and graze another man&#39;s crotch at all, you&#39;re going to be compelled to jerk him off.  Everyone will let your little hands go to town and nobody will stop you, but after completing the act, if they were annoyed, they might spank you like a naughty boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad got up on his feet.  <br />
<br />
And Kyle looked him over.  &quot;Let&#39;s give you a costume befitting such a class clown!&quot; He said with a flourish.  A three pointed jester&#39;s hat appeared on Chad&#39;s head, along with a pair of purple open crotched pants held up by tiny suspenders. <br />
<br />
&quot;Go on back to your place if you want.&quot; Kyle said.  Chad took three steps, then tripping, he fell hands first into one of the basketball players, Aaron&#39;s lap.  Chad made quick work out of fishing the cock out of his shorts and jerking the unsuspecting athlete.  <br />
<br />
After a few minutes of hurried work, Aaron came.  Then, he picked up the little jester and gave him a rapid fire five smacks on his rear.  Chad cried out and squirmed,  but as soon as it was over, he popped his cock into his mouth and quieted down.  <br />
<br />
Then he loudly announced, &quot;Need to potty!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle pointed out the restroom to him and more than a few of the guys snickered as they watched Chad stand on his tippy toes to drape his cock over the bowl.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Gosh shut the door you dummy.&quot; Kyle said<br />
<br />
Chad was already pissing, but Blake who had just finished his work on his step daddy got up and closed the door.  <br />
<br />
Then Kyle and the rest of the crowd could hear the  shouted, &quot;What the fuck! Oh God. What&#39;s wrong with me!&quot; along with a couple stifled sobs as Chad, now in full control found himself with his mouth around his favorite pacifier.  <br />
<br />
The door opened and a red faced Chad trundled over to his seat, once again living and acting the part of the midget moron.</p>
