<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Your eyes widened at the sight in front of you. Two rams were standing on your porch, wearing polos and shorts that showed off their well-groomed wool. It was such a surreal and disorienting sight, that you just kept on staring until one of them spoke up.<br />
<br />
&quot;I take it you don&#39;t see too many of our kind around here?&quot; Asked the sheep on the left in a calm and measured tone, grinning slightly as he ran a hoof-like hand through the thick white curls on his head.<br />
<br />
You nod slowly, before finding the courage to answer. &quot;Yuh-yeah. I&#39;ve never seen...sheep like you two before.&quot;<br />
<br />
The ram on the right snorted a little before smiling. &quot;I bet you haven&#39;t. Mind if we come in?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...no,&quot; you say nervously. &quot;Mom&#39;s making dinner right now, and my sisters are doing their homework. Maybe you could come over tomorrow?&quot;<br />
<br />
The two rams looked at each other incredulously. As if they expected you to let them inside. The ram on the left put an arm on the other ram&#39;s shoulder, and they turned around, whispering to each other for a few seconds. Now, this was pretty suspicious behavior, but seeing two anthropomorphic sheep talk to each other was just so out of place, that you overlooked their behavior. Eventually, though, they turned around, smiles on their faces.<br />
<br />
The ram on the left narrowed his eyes ever-so slightly, before he smiled some more. &quot;It&#39;s alright. We understand. Maybe you could help us out, though? We have a few things left to move in, and we&#39;d really appreciate the help.&quot; Said the ram in a calm and measured voice, looking directly into your eyes as he spoke.<br />
<br />
You exhale, having just realized you were holding your breath. There was something...weird about those two sheep. Something you couldn&#39;t quite put a finger on. You felt a little dizzy all of a sudden, and you lean against the porch to support yourself for a few seconds. <br />
<br />
&quot;Help?&quot; You half-mumble.  &quot;I guess I could help you guys.&quot;<br />
<br />
And with that, you step off the porch and follow the two rams to the curb, rubbing your temples as you walk, feeling disoriented. The two rams walking in front of you turn around for a second, and ask for your name. After responding, the ram on the left nods, and says his name is Seth. The one on the right was called Bo.<br />
<br />
&quot;So...&quot; Started Seth, &quot;There&#39;s a few things on the curb here that you could bring inside. Feel free to relax on the couch when you&#39;re done.&quot;<br />
<br />
You could hear Bo laugh at that comment, but you&#39;re too busy helping to really care. Box after heavy box is moved inside, and when you&#39;re finally finished you collapse on your neighbor&#39;s couch and wipe the sweat off your brow, not noticing the two rams sit down next to you. One on the left, one on the right. <br />
<br />
&quot;That wasn&#39;t too bad,&quot; said Bo. &quot;Thanks to our helper here, we got finished in record time.&quot;<br />
<br />
The ram ran a cloven hand through your short hair, before almost affectionately patting your head. A part of you wants to get up, to tell him to stop, but you&#39;re strangely tired, and it kind of feels nice to have your hair touched. So instead, you just blush before asking the rams what they do around here, not noticing your cropped buzzcut starting to tingle. Meanwhile, Seth started to massage your shoulders, sending shivers of delight through your entire body. <br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re barbers,&quot; said Seth simply. &quot;And good ones, too.  Used to work in the city, but...things aren&#39;t really working out anymore. So we decided to move to the suburbs! Take ourselves to our clients, so to speak. Speaking of, how&#39;d you like to have a free haircut? As a thank you, from one neighbor to another.&quot;<br />
<br />
You tuck some hair behind your ears and shake your head, feeling your bangs tickle your cheeks and eyebrows. &quot;That&#39;s nice and all, but...it&#39;s kind of late, and I think dinner&#39;s ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
Getting up, you frown. A part of you really wanted to stay with the rams. But your mother would throw a fit if you stayed out past curfew, so off you went. But before you exit through the front door, you hear a rustling on the couch. It was Seth, approaching you with a bottle in his hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here, take this,&quot; said the ram. &quot;It&#39;s some shampoo. We can&#39;t let you leave here empty-handed! We insist you take it, we really do!&quot;<br />
<br />
You smile at Seth and thank him, surprised by the generosity of your new neighbors. You inspect the bottle closely, and see that it&#39;s a pretty standard shampoo bottle. But it was designed with some kind of wool decal, and was labeled &quot;Meadow Springs&quot;. You take a whiff and you reel, almost feeling dizzy as the odors of fresh grass and clean water assault your senses. It was so herbal! <br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, Seth,&quot; you say after a weak cough. &quot;Maybe I&#39;ll take you up on that haircut offer sometime. But I really have to go. It was nice meeting you! And Bo, too!&quot; You exclaim as you walk out the door.<br />
<br />
Your walk home is pretty quick. You just can&#39;t get the sight of those two sheep out of your head, and a growing part of you is really regretting leaving them behind. Made you feel like a bad neighbor. Shaking off those thoughts, you knock on your door and walk inside.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Mom! I&#39;m home!&quot; You say as you walk to the kitchen. &quot;Sorry that I&#39;m late, the new neighbors were here, and I was helping them out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh? You helped our neighbors? I guess that&#39;s alright, then,&quot; said your mother as she finished setting up the table, your younger sisters already fed and about to go to sleep.<br />
<br />
As you fix yourself up a glass of water and sit down, your mother finally notices you. &quot;Your hair...&quot;<br />
<br />
You run a hand through your shoulder-length hair. &quot;What about my hair, Mom?&quot;<br />
<br />
As if a wave passed over her, she relaxed. &quot;Nothing. Thought something was different about you for a second.&quot; <br />
<br />
You chuckle at that outrageous notion and finish your dinner with your mother. You talk about your new neighbors the entire time, talking about how great they were. When dinner was over, you head upstairs to finish your homework and to relax and unwind. You put your new bottle of shampoo in the bathroom, and smile at your reflection as you brush your teeth, finding nothing out of the ordinary with your long hair. As if you&#39;ve always looked that way.<br />
<br />
When you finally climb into your bed, you fall asleep easily, more quickly than usual. Your sleep is pleasant, and deep. You have faint dreams involving grass and fields, but it&#39;s hard for you sleeping mind to tell. One thing you do know, is that two fuzzy things are petting and hugging you. And it makes you feel so good. <br />
<br />
Your body tingles softly as you sleep, and a big smile forms on your face as you continue to dream about soft, good, things.</p>
