<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Shane spent the rest of the school day resisting pulling out his phone. Lunch and two more class periods all went by with Shane just learning to enjoy being his new self. Chatting with friends, being the popular jock, and strutting around the school. After school came wrestling practice, and putting that singlet on for the first time almost had him popping wood again. Crimson red and marked with the school&#39;s name across the front, it hugged every line of muscle on his torso and felt fantastic. Luckily, Shane has ways to keep his mammoth cock under some control, mostly focusing on something else and tensing up his muscles until it went down.<br />
<br />
For practice, as usual, he was partnered with Pete. Pete was the only other guy on the team in Shane&#39;s weight class, and so the two of them ended up partnered quite often. But that was where the similarity between the two eighteen year olds ended. Pete was taller, so even though he weighed the same as Shane, he looked leaner and more svelte. Where Shane was a bit on the paler side, Pete had a bit of a coppery tone to his skin, supposedly from a Native American grandfather. Combined with his pale blond hair, Pete looked like a California surfer boy even in the dead of winter. He was also practically hairless, and what little he did have he shaved, since he was also on the swim team, even though swim season was over for the year, he kept up on it.<br />
<br />
Still, the two were pretty good friends. It&#39;s hard not to spend hours every week tangled up with another guy on the mats and not have some sort of bond. Shane was the better wrestler, but Pete was also star of the swim team so didn&#39;t mind Shane taking the glory there. The two were kept by coach a little longer after practice today, going over a few techniques, so when Shane and Pete got to the lockers, sweaty and panting, the last of the rest of the team was leaving, giving them the place to themselves.<br />
<br />
&quot;I swear, Gor, every time I think I have you pinned you find some way to turn me on my ass.&quot; Pete was stripping out of his singlet, sliding his arms free and rolling it down past his waist. Pete really did have a nice body, his chest was broad and his waist trim, a perfect swimmer&#39;s V. Even without the coating of hair Shane would have preferred there he could help but let his thoughts drift to running his hands along those muscles. &quot;You&#39;d think with all that hair you got it&#39;d help give me some traction, but I&#39;d have better luck with a greased pig.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s why I focus on one sport, I put all my time into mastering my technique, even in the off season.&quot; Shane had stripped completely out of his singlet, using it to wipe a bit of sweat from his chest and pits. He had work after this and would have to grab a shower. Then his eyes settled on his phone, and Shane licked his lips. He looked over his shoulder then pack to his phone, bringing up the app. &quot;Speaking of off season, why do you keep yourself so smooth all the time?&quot; Pete&#39;s information was right at the top, quick to access:<br />

<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t.&quot; By know Pete was standing naked in front of his locker. While his body was nice and muscled, he was definitely completely smooth, except for a small, wispy patch of blond above his dick. He wasn&#39;t very gifted in the cock department either. It wasn&#39;t small, it was just.. average. Though from the rumors he heard around school, Pete more than made up for it with how well he could use his tongue, and supposedly he loved using it. &quot;If I could let myself get a little fuzzy in the off-season I would. Just don&#39;t have the genetics for it. Coming?&quot; Pete was headed off to the showers, kit in hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, right behind you..&quot; But Shane was messing with the Chronivac, Pete&#39;s words causing him to smile mischievously, he didn&#39;t need to make many changes. This would be quick.<br />

<br />
The only alteration that took any time was figuring out how to set  his relationship to let him fool around, but Shane had spent some free moments digging through the menus earlier in the day. He clicked the button to commence changes, grabbed his kit and headed into the showers. The showers themselves were wide open, the exact reason he knew how many of his male classmates looked naked. Pete was already at one of the showers, lathering up and Shane took one two down from him where he could get a good view but not crowd his friend.<br />
<br />
Already, the patch of hair above Pete&#39;s crotch was thicker. Still blond, though slightly darkened from being wet, but fuller. The water had also darkened hairs along his friends shins and forearms, and as Shane watched he sword he could see them getting longer, others pushing in. His own change had been full and chaotic, but watching something so specific as this where he could focus on it was it&#39;s own form of entertaining, and arousing.<br />
<br />
Shane was having some trouble juggling showering, watching his friend, and looking like he wasn&#39;t watching. But as hairs were beginning to grow in a line up Pete&#39;s stomach towards his navel, Shane noticed something off. Pete was looking down at himself, brows furrowed in thought, finger tracing that line of hair. Suddenly Shane had a moment of panic. Did he forget to make sure Pete wouldn&#39;t notice? Crap.<br />
<br />
&quot;You alright, man?&quot; Shane tried to make his voice sound as casual as possible. The first curly blond hairs were growing in the middle of Pete&#39;s chest, a few more around his pert nipples. He even had sideburns now, trimmed short, but down to the bottom of his ears rather than the top where they were just moments ago. Shane couldn&#39;t tell on the rest of his face, blond and clean shaven was not a combination for showing stubble.<br />
<br />
Shane&#39;s voice seemed to snap Pete out of his thoughts. &quot;What?&quot; He looked over at Shane, blinking a few times, then shook his head as if to clear it. &quot;Oh, yeah. Just thinking.&quot; He grabbed his shampoo and started lathering up his hair, with his arms up, Shane could see the damp tangle of blond hair in his friend&#39;s pits, a bush he could definitely see getting thicker as he looked. Average hair all over was fine, but Shane wanted to give him some heavy body hair somewhere. It&#39;d be a bitch for his friend to shave for swimming, but Shane thought it was amusing, and kind of hot. When Pete lowered his arms, Shane could still see some hairs sticking out of his pits. He&#39;d get his face shoved in those during a wrestling match eventually.<br />
<br />
The thought had Shane going hard, and this time it was Pete&#39;s voice that snapped him out of it. &quot;Fuck, dude, I always forget what a monster you have. You think it&#39;s like you, short and thick, then BAM! Twice as long, and even thicker.&quot; Shane laughed, trying to just act normally as he watched hairs sprouting on his friend&#39;s chest from the corner of his eye. Though with shock, he noticed Pete had taken his own cock in hand. The tweaks Shane had made to it were obviously setting in. It&#39;d be big, but not next to Shane&#39;s own monster. But like himself, Pete was sporting a full-on erection, his other hand running along his chest. It wasn&#39;t super hairy, just a diamond of blond curls between his nipples, connected to tapered treasure trail running down to his cock. On his limbs it didn&#39;t go past his elbows or knees, the rest of him was still smooth, but the over all look was pretty damn nice. Shane would have pushed it more, but he didn&#39;t want to make swim season a total pain in the ass for his friend. &quot;I mean, how many guys have you choked with that thing?&quot;<br />
<br />
Shane blinked a few times at his friends words. Before they usually kept the conversation off sex. Pete knew Shane preferred guys and was okay with it, but it didn&#39;t mean he wanted to hear about it. In exchange, Pete didn&#39;t go off about the girls he&#39;d fucked with Shane, so this was new ground. &quot;Haven&#39;t had a guy yet who could deep throat me and not gag on it.&quot; It was an honest answer. Technically, he&#39;d never had a blow job since becoming Shane, and Shane&#39;s memories confirmed most guys balked at trying.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bet I could.&quot; This was Pete, oral sex champion of the school. At least when it came to eating pussy. Though bisexual Pete seemed to have the same oral fixation with men.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bullshit.&quot; Shane acted like he didn&#39;t care, but that rigid cock was betraying him. The thought of his friend&#39;s mouth wrapped around his monster of a shaft had him practically drooling, and not from his mouth. He couldn&#39;t be too eager, though. &quot;&#39;Sides, we&#39;re friends, it&#39;d be awkward.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re bros, and it&#39;s for a bet. Winner gets to ask the loser for a favor, no questions asked.&quot; Pete was wearing his cockiest grin, and Shane felt his competitiveness flaring up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine, deal.&quot; As soon as Shane spoke the words, Pete was kneeling down in front of him, taking that massive cock in his hand and staring at it head on. &quot;Second thoughts?&quot;<br />
<br />
In answer, Pete&#39;s tongue flicked out and ran along Shane&#39;s tip, sending a shiver up his spine. Shane leaned back against the shower wall, as Pete gave his first attempt at working his mouth around his cock. He took the whole head inside his mouth, though most guys could do that, Shane still loved the feeling of warmth wrapped around his dick. Pete&#39;s tongue moves around, finding sensitive spots and sliding along them, teasing his slit, and even sliding between his foreskin and his shaft. Pete wasn&#39;t only trying to deep throat him, he was giving him a full-on blow job. And already it was one of the better ones.<br />
<br />
Shane knew Pete must be tasting the small rivulet of pre he could feel drooling from the tip of his cock. Slowly he took a couple more inches of Shane&#39;s shaft into his mouth, Shane could feel the tip of his cock pressed against the back of Pete&#39;s throat, and still no gag. Even with his mouth stuffed full, Pete was managing to caress Shane&#39;s shaft with his tongue. This altered Pete was a blow job master, which also made Shane wonder how many of these he&#39;d given. But those thoughts were soon lost in hot pleasure as Pete slid himself back and forth along that shaft. One of Shane&#39;s hands continued to brace himself on the wall, the other reaching down to tangle in his friend&#39;s hair.<br />
<br />
Each time Pete moved forward, he swallowed a little bit more of Shane&#39;s cock, to the point were Shane could actually see his cock stretching Pete&#39;s throat a little. Leave it to the swim champion to be able to hold his breath like this. Pete stopped trying to take more a little past the halfway point. Any beyond that would have been ridiculous, but more of Shane&#39;s cock was in Pete&#39;s mouth that he had ever seen anyone take before, and Pete was perfectly fine, in fact, he was eagerly working the shaft still. Shane felt his balls tightening up, his cock twitching inside the tight confines of Pete&#39;s mouth. &quot;Shit.. dude.. I&#39;m going to cum.&quot; His friend pulled back just in time to get the full blast of Shane&#39;s orgasm right into his face. Though he didn&#39;t seem to care, in fact, he looked to be enjoying it. It was only once the fog cleared he noticed Pete had blown a rather impressive load as well, having been stroking himself off the whole time.<br />
<br />
Without a word, but wearing a very cocky smirk, Pete got to his feet and went back over to his shower nozzle to clean himself off. &quot;Holy fuck, dude, how did you do that?&quot; Going into this, Shane had been hoping to maybe just fool around a little in the showers, maybe a hand job, but this..<br />
<br />
&quot;No gag reflex.&quot; Pete shrugged. &quot;Can&#39;t remember ever having one. Well, that and knowing how to hold my breath.&quot; He winked as he continued to clean Shane&#39;s cum off of his face and out of his newly acquired chest hair where it had dribbled down, which seemed to flummox him a little. Shane&#39;s clean up was much easier.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what favor do you want?&quot; Shane asked, though he didn&#39;t sound defeated, how could he still riding high off of the best blow job he&#39;d ever had.<br />
<br />
&quot;Later. I gotta get to work. They&#39;ll kill me if I&#39;m late on a Friday night.&quot; Pete said, finished cleaning off and headed back to the locker rooms.<br />
<br />
Shane followed behind, &quot;Right, work.&quot; He was worried things would be a bit awkward now, but Pete continued to act like his normal, chipper self as they both got changed for their respective jobs. Walking out to the parking lot, he felt Pete&#39;s hand on his shoulder stopping him for just a minute.<br />
<br />
&quot;Seriously, we&#39;re cool. I&#39;m not gonna lose my best friend over a blow job.&quot; Pete laughed. &quot;And thanks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For what?&quot; Shane asked, wondering what he was being thanked for, but Pete just shrugged and headed to his car, waving to Shane before driving off like after every other practice. Shane decided to forget about it for now, and headed to his truck.</p>
