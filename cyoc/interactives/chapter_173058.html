<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Christy saw no reason to decline, so she accepted the ,invitation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great. Except that I need Lola to show the way, as I didn&#39;t see it until now, I also don&#39;t know the way home.&quot; Hope said<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, with my help we will get there without any problem.&quot; Lola said<br />
<br />
&quot;Mount on me, so we&#39;ll get there faster.&quot; Christy said<br />
<br />
Hope mounted the Christy&#39;s left horse body  and Lola on the right, so she went on her way following Lola&#39;s instructions.<br />
<br />
Christy was guided to a part of the city she had never been to and was in for a huge surprise when they got there. Hope was the daughter of a wealthy family and lived in a huge mansion and the entire property was bigger than her school. &quot;I can&#39;t believe this, your home is huge.&quot; she said impressed. Both Hope and Lola said they didn&#39;t know the size of normal people to understand why she was so impressed.<br />
<br />
As soon as they passed through the front gate they were stopped by security. The security chief came over to them and said &quot;What are you doing here? Don&#39;t you know that this is a private property?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t have to worry, it&#39;s me, Hope. Lola and I brought a friend home. Thanks to this friend I can hear and see now.&quot; Hope said to the security chief<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think we are stupid? You may have disguised yourself so well that you looked like the mistress&#39;s daughter, but if you had researched her right you would know that she is blind and deaf, never that she would speak to us.&quot; The security chief said<br />
<br />
&quot;She is telling the truth.&quot; Lola said in defense of her owner<br />
<br />
&quot;And you should be ashamed of walking around naked. Who do you think you are?&quot; the security chief said<br />
<br />
&quot;I’m Lola, Master Hope’s guide dog.&quot; the dog girls said<br />
<br />
&quot;Imbecile, do you really think you could pass yourself off as a dog with that fake tail and ear?&quot; the security chief said. <br />
<br />
Soon after one of the other guards who was behind the girls, went to the superior and said in his ear &quot;Sir, I know it will be hard to believe but her tail doesn’t look fake.&quot; Lola, who still has her dog ears with a very sharp hearing, could hear.<br />
<br />
&quot;This cannot be true.&quot; the security chief said, ran behind them and saw that Lola&#39;s tail was attached just above her ass instead of coming out of it as he believed. He didn&#39;t know what else to think and called the mansion explaining the situation.<br />
<br />
He talked away from them, but Lola can hear the whole conversation. She knew that the head of security had spoken to Hope&#39;s mother and that they had prepared a test for them.<br />
<br />
They were guided to a room where they waited for 15 minutes until 10 female guards entered. &quot;Now for you who say if Hope, one of those women who entered is the lady of this mansion and the mother of Hope. If you are who you say you are, you will know which one is the mother in disguise.&quot;<br />
<br />
Christy and Madison obviously didn&#39;t know which one was Hope&#39;s mother. Lola knew what it was, but she controlled herself for the sake of her master. <br />
<br />
After a few minutes of looking, Hope said &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I never saw my mom, I don&#39;t know which one my mom is from just looking.&quot;<br />
<br />
When she said that, one of the guards came up to her, smiled widely and said &quot;So is it really true? You really are Hope. This is a miracle, my daughter is cured of her blindness and deafness.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hold on, how do you know that I&#39;m the real Hope if I said I didn&#39;t recognize you?&quot; Hope asked<br />
<br />
&quot;It is simple, I am the wife of a businessman well known in the world and someone finding an image of me is very easy, with that someone trying to pass a blow would take a long time to answer and look at me more times or say immediately that they did not recognize me. You observed all of us very well before answering, only someone who has never seen before could have done something like this in this situation.&quot; Hope&#39;s mother said. Lola couldn&#39;t help herself anymore and jumped on her, making her lie down on the floor, and licked her while swinging her tail happily. &quot;And apparently you are Lola. This way of licking me is unmistakable.&quot; she said<br />
<br />
After the greetings they were released by the security guards and went to the mansion, where Hope&#39;s mother told them to go ahead because she would get a cake and take it to them. Hope knew a little bit about the way to her room, yet she followed Lola&#39;s instructions to get there while watching the halls of the mansion she passed, enjoying what she never could before.<br />
<br />
When they got there, they saw that the room was huge but it only had the bed, a wardrobe and a coffee table, since ornaments and other things like that would only get in the way of the handicap she had.<br />
<br />
The first thing they did after they sat down next to the table was Hope and Lola asking Christy how she had done to transform Lola and heal Hope. Christy and Madison told us all about the TF gun.<br />
<br />
&quot;A gun whose shots do not hurt anyone who is hit and still cause a transformation in them? I can see that you turned Lola from a dog into practically human, but it seems that there was no transformation in me. What did you change about me?&quot; Hope said<br />
<br />
&quot;His transformation was just the replacement of his eyes and ears that didn&#39;t work for others that work perfectly. I also include the language information in your brain so that you could speak.&quot; Christy said<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice. I want to see you using it.&quot; Hope said.<br />
<br />
At this time Hope&#39;s mother entered the room pushing a cart with the cake, Christy took advantage of the moment that she was on her back closing the door and shot her. When she turned to face the girls she already had a huge bulge in her pants.<br />
<br />
Hope&#39;s mother placed four plates on the table and one on the floor for Madison, on which she placed a piece of cake on each. Then she put five glasses on the table and said &quot;Just wait a minute and I will prepare an extremely nutritious drink for us.&quot; then she unzipped her pants taking a stick out of it, and just below her dick was a huge breast instead of balls. She pressed the breast between her legs and spurted milk from the nipple, with which she filled the glasses on the table. She couldn&#39;t help but get her 8 inch cock hard while doing this. &quot;I&#39;m sorry but I have to do something important. You don&#39;t have to worry about me, I&#39;ll be done quickly and I&#39;ll be right back.&quot; she said and left the room, which Christy and Madison knew she was going to look for a reserved place to jack off.</p>
