<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;So, what do you want to do now?&quot; The Clone asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...&quot; Jeff started.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, wait,&quot; the clone interrupted. &quot;Before anything else, there&#39;s one thing I&#39;ve been meaning to ask you. Can I have a name? I mean, if I&#39;m gonna be a real person and all, I should have a name, right?&quot; The clone smiled at Jeff expectantly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yeah. Sorry.&quot; Jeff said, his excitement at making the clone completely overshadowed his thoughts at giving it a name.  He&#39;d wanted a twin, a brother that he could share everything with, talk about school, life...heh...girls. Jeff paused, struggling to come up with something good. Finally, he shrugged and decided to just go with his first idea. &quot;Well, since I made you with the sock, why don&#39;t I just call you Socky?&quot; Jeff chuckled. &quot;Get it? Because you&#39;re a sock? And your name is Socky?&quot;   Jeff felt so stupid. He wished he&#39;d thought about naming his twin sooner. Maybe it was the hormones from the shower that had messed up his brain. Still, Socky was kind of a silly name, but whatever, he didn&#39;t have any better ideas.<br />
<br />
&quot;Socky?&quot; the clone repeated, sounding slightly offended. &quot;Seriously? That&#39;s the best you can come up with?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, you never had a name before. And I did make you with my cummy sock.&quot; Jeff pointed out, still trying not to laugh.<br />
<br />
The clone wrinkled his nose. &quot;Yeah, I know, but come on. Couldn&#39;t you have picked something a little less lame?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, sorry man.&quot; Jeff said, holding up his hands. &quot;It&#39;s not like I had time to come up with a name for a boy I&#39;ve only just created.&quot; He thought for a moment. &quot;Fine, what do you think I should call you?&quot;<br />
<br />
The clone tilted his head. &quot;Well, what about, like, Jeffie or something?&quot; he suggested.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeffie?&quot; Jeff said, frowning. &quot;That&#39;s the best you could do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;s not like I had much time to think about it either.  Besides, you&#39;re Jeff and I&#39;m just a copy of you even if I don&#39;t have all of your memories, or life, or...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine, I get it,&quot; Jeff said.  &quot;Jeffie it is then.  But I&#39;m still going to call you Socky every once in a while.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fair enough.&quot; Jeffie replied. &quot;Now, back to the original question. What should we do next?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I was thinking that maybe we could hang out, you know, get to know each other.&quot; Jeff said.<br />
&quot;Hmm,&quot; Jeffie said, &quot;my creator grew me from an old cum sock about an hour ago, he took me into the shower,&quot; Jeffie paused, his cheeks flushing, &quot;jacked me off, and now I&#39;m sitting here, naked, in his room.  There&#39;s my life&#39;s history.&quot; Jeffie grinned. &quot;I&#39;ve seen everything already.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s face flushed and he shook his head. &quot;Okay, you know what smartass? I was thinking that we talk, you know, like close brothers, that&#39;s kind of why I created you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeffie&#39;s grin faded and he nodded. &quot;Okay, okay. What do you want to talk about, Jeff? Oh, I know, how about girls? You&#39;re a guy, so you must be into them, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff laughed. &quot;Of course I&#39;m into girls. I&#39;m a boy. We&#39;re all into girls. What else would I be into?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Jeffie replied. &quot;Maybe you&#39;re gay. You&#39;re the one who made a copy of yourself with a cum sock and jacked it off. That&#39;s pretty gay.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff glared at Jeffie. &quot;Shut up, Socky.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeffie laughed. &quot;Make me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff growled, his fists clenching. &quot;Okay, I&#39;ll make you. You just wait until I get my hands on you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, really?&quot; Jeffie smirked. &quot;What are you going to do, beat me up?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe.&quot; Jeff said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, you wouldn&#39;t stand a chance against me.&quot; Jeffie replied, laughing.  He laid down on the bed and patted the sheets.  &quot;Come on, let&#39;s chat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine.&quot; Jeff said, laying down next to Jeffie. The two stared up at the ceiling, neither of them speaking.<br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; Jeff said, &quot;What do you think of your life so far, Socky? Any regrets?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really,&quot; Jeffie said. &quot;I&#39;ve only been alive for, what, an hour or so? So, not a lot of time for regrets yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s true.&quot; Jeff said.<br />
<br />
&quot;But,&quot; Jeffie continued, turning his head towards his creator, &quot;I&#39;ve really enjoyed it so far.&quot;  He frowned. &quot;Though I do feel bad about the way I came into this world.&quot; Jeffie added, sighing. &quot;Being made from a cum-encrusted sock is not exactly the best start in life, is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope.&quot; Jeff agreed. &quot;I&#39;m sorry about that. It wasn&#39;t exactly my plan when I made you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, don&#39;t worry about it, Bro.&quot; Jeffie said, smiling.  &quot;It&#39;s not like I&#39;m suffering from some deeply embedded trama,&quot; he chuckled.  &quot;By the way, are you going to keep those clothes on or are you going to get me something to wear.  It&#39;s kind of weird that I&#39;m the only one naked here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff glanced down at his clothes. &quot;I guess I could get you some boxers or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Or,&quot; Jeffie said, &quot;you could just take your clothes off. You know, we&#39;re both guys, and you just saw me naked in the shower, and,&quot; he chuckled, &quot;It&#39;s not like we have anything the other doesn&#39;t have.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff shook his head. &quot;Yeah, but It&#39;s like we&#39;re brothers.  You know what&#39;s why I made you, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you say so.&quot; Jeffie replied. &quot;Although, if I were you, I&#39;d take off my clothes. You&#39;ve got a great body, Jeff, and you shouldn&#39;t hide it under all that stuff.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff blushed. &quot;You think I have a great body? I thought I was pretty average.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re waaay beyond average,&quot; Jeffie said, shaking his head. &quot;I mean, look at you, you&#39;re toned, athletic, and you&#39;ve got a great set of pecs. <br />
Seriously, bro, take your shirt off. Trust me, you won&#39;t regret it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff considered the clone&#39;s words for a moment. The idea of being naked with his clone was weird, but, hey, they had the same body afterall. And he did want to be close to someone which is why he made Jeffie, and two boys, laying naked together, chatting, was about as intimate a conversation as he could imagine.  &quot;Fine,&quot; Jeff said, sitting up and pulling his shirt over his head. &quot;You&#39;re right, Socky, I am pretty awesome.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s the spirit.&quot; Jeffie grinned. &quot;Now, take off your pants, too. You know, for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s cheeks flushed. &quot;Okay, fine.&quot; He undid his jeans and pulled them off, revealing a pair of white boxers underneath.<br />
<br />
&quot;Those, too.&quot; Jeffie said, his eyes glued to Jeff&#39;s crotch.<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s heart pounded in his chest. &quot;Fine, fine.&quot; He reached down and slowly peeled his underwear off, exposing his flaccid cock and balls that dangled loosely from between his legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm, that&#39;s more like it.&quot; Jeffie purred, his eyes roaming over Jeff&#39;s naked body. &quot;Now, get back down here so we can talk some more.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright,&quot; Jeff said, laying back down on the bed, his cock and balls exposed to the air. &quot;So, what do you want to talk about?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we could talk about girls.&quot; Jeffie said. &quot;I&#39;ve never actually seen one, but I know what they are and feel the attraction, just like you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure.&quot; Jeff agreed. <br />
<br />
&quot;So, what kind of girls you into?&quot; Jeffie asked<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Jeff mused, &quot;Blondes, brunettes, redheads, as long as they&#39;re cute, I&#39;m into them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fair enough.&quot; Jeffie said. &quot;Do you have a preference for boobs or ass?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Definitely boobs.&quot; Jeff replied. &quot;They&#39;re soft and squishy, and they jiggle when a girl walks. And, if you&#39;re lucky, sometimes you can catch a glimpse of cleavage or see her nipples through her shirt.&quot;  Jeff shocked himself at how easily he spoke with Jeffie about such things.  He never even talked about this kind of stuff with his friends.  It was like Jeff and Jeffie shared some sort of a connection, possibly since Jeffie was a copy of himself in both personality and body.  He wasn&#39;t totally sure.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Jeffie said, grinning. &quot;Boobs, got it. Now, what about sex? Have you ever had sex, Jeff?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Of course not.&quot; Jeff stammered, blushing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Bro!&quot; Jeffie shot up, eyes wide, and stared at his brother.  &quot;With a body like yours?  You need to get out there and do it.&quot; Jeffie chuckled. &quot;But I bet you&#39;ve thought about it, haven&#39;t you?&quot;  He plopped back down and ran his hand through the tuft of his pubic hair, swirling them around finger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, yeah.&quot; Jeff said. &quot;Who hasn&#39;t? But it&#39;s not like there are a lot of girls lining up to have sex with me. Besides, I want my first time to be with someone special.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s bullshit.&quot; Jeffie said, shaking his head. &quot;I&#39;m you, so I know better.  Stop lying&quot; He grinned. &quot;Come on, admit it, you&#39;ve thought about having sex, a lot.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff felt his cock begin to stiffen at the thought. &quot;Well, maybe I have, but that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m going to go out and have sex with the first girl who comes along.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course not,&quot; Jeffie said, his tone patronizing. &quot;But there are plenty of girls out there who would love to have sex with a guy like you. All you have to do is find one.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff snorted. &quot;Yeah, sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Seriously, Jeff.&quot; Jeffie said, his voice serious, and he turned to his side, raising a hand to his brother&#39;s shoulder. &quot;You&#39;re an attractive guy. You just need to put yourself out there. Show a little confidence, and girls will be lining up to have sex with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You really think so?&quot; Jeff asked, his heart pounding at the thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Absolutely.&quot; Jeffie said.<br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; Jeffie said, rolling onto his back again. &quot;Tell me more about a girl you&#39;ve got your eye on. What&#39;s she like?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, well, she&#39;s pretty, um, nice.&quot; Jeff said, his cheeks burning. &quot;Her name is Jessica and she&#39;s in my AP US history class.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Nice?&quot; Jeffie said, raising an eyebrow. &quot;That&#39;s it? Come on, give me more than that. Is she funny? Smart? What does she look like?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, well, she&#39;s the smartest person in class and really cute. She has, uh, blonde hair, and she&#39;s got these big blue eyes, and she&#39;s, um, got the perkiest breasts ever.&quot; Jeff stammered. &quot;You have no idea how many times I thought about her when I was in yo...&quot;  Jeff paused, feeling suddenly awkward.<br />
<br />
&quot;When you were in what?&quot; Jeffie pressed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nevermind.&quot; Jeff said, his face redder than before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, you can tell me.&quot; Jeffie said, smiling. &quot;You can&#39;t leave me hanging like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, fine.&quot; Jeff sighed. &quot;I was thinking about her when I, uh, jacked off. A lot.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In me, right,&quot; Jeffie chucked. &quot;It&#39;s okay, I know that&#39;s what I was for.&quot;  Jeffie grinned. &quot;Did you ever imagine her taking off her clothes for you? Or maybe doing more than just taking her clothes off?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s heart pounded in his chest. This conversation was getting awfully intimate. &quot;I-I may have imagined a few things,&quot; Jeff said, his voice barely a whisper.<br />
<br />
&quot;A few hundred.&quot; Jeffie said, his eyes twinkling. &quot;I remember how much of your cum covered me when you made me.&quot;  He laughed. &quot;Come on bro, tell me. What did you imagine her doing?&quot; <br />
<br />
Jeff swallowed hard. &quot;I, uh, imagined her giving me a blowjob. A really good one.  Kneeling naked in front of me as her blond hair cascades over her nude back, taking my penis, and sucking it in until I become hard.&quot;  Jeff threw his head back.  &quot;Ahh that would be amazing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeffie smirked. &quot;Anything else?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff bit his lower lip. &quot;I imagined her, um, riding me. You know, in the cowgirl position, bouncing up and down on my cock with her breasts juggling with each movement.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm, I&#39;m sure you did.&quot; Jeffie purred. &quot;What else?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff hesitated. He couldn&#39;t believe he was telling his clone this, but it felt good. It was like a weight was lifted off his shoulders. And as awkward as it seemed at first, it felt so natural.  He took a deep breath and continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;I imagined her on her knees, bent over a table, as I, uh, fucked her from behind. Hard.&quot; Jeff whispered. &quot;The sound of my body slapping against hers as I thrust into her over and over again, making her moan and scream my name. The sight of her back arched and her breasts pressed against the table as I bury my cock in her over and over. Ahhh!&quot; Jeff&#39;s heart raced and his cock grew painfully hard as he imagined the scene. He could almost hear the sounds of their bodies colliding, their moans of pleasure. He couldn&#39;t believe he had told his clone his deepest, darkest fantasy. It just came so naturally.  It was kind of what he created Jeffie for, but still, he could barely bring himself to look at the other boy, afraid that he would see disgust or judgment in his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, Jeff.&quot; Jeffie said, his voice husky. &quot;That is quite the imagination you&#39;ve got. I&#39;m impressed. Although, I can&#39;t say I&#39;m surprised.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Jeff asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean, I&#39;m your clone, right?&quot; Jeffie said, grinning. &quot;We share the same thoughts, the same desires, even if I don&#39;t have your memory.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right.&quot; Jeff said, nodding.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, then, I should be able to tell you that I&#39;m a virgin, too.&quot; Jeffie said.<br />
<br />
Jeff laughed.  &quot;No, really?&quot; he asked, sarcasm dripping from his voice. &quot;You&#39;ve only been alive two whole hours and you&#39;re telling me you&#39;re a virgin, too?  Dude, why haven&#39;t you done it yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, what can I say, I&#39;ve always wanted my first time to be with someone special, too.&quot; Jeffie replied. &quot;And, now that we&#39;re the same person, I figure that counts.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff shook his head. &quot;You&#39;re really something, Socky. But thanks, for understanding, and not judging me.&quot;</p>
