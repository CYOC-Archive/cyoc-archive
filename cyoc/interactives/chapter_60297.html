<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Fourty-five seconds after the power went off every staff cellphone and pager on Pleasure Island triggered as the emergency communications system was activated. The following message was relayed to all of the devices:<br />
<br />
“Condition Red. Full lockdown. Non-combatant staff abandon posts, retreat to quarters. Ferries to mainland berths immediately. Vessels on route return mainland. Combat, capture, processing, recon staff report main jail, Thunder incident commander. Ponius out.”<br />
<br />
===============================================================<br />
<br />
The island was still alive with the sounds of drunken revelers, the power outage not slowing many down, and given others opportunities to act on their baser impulses. Many did not notice the staff quietly scurrying through the streets disappearing into hidden doors, and others disappearing backstage not to return. <br />
<br />
The armored vehicles racing through the streets of the island gathered a bit more attention as they didn’t bother slowing or stopping for any hapless visitors who got in the way. They all converged on a false building front that swung open to reveal an entrance to the back-stage portion of the island. Armed guards in riot gear kept the visitors back till the phony storefront swung back into place, blocking the view of the curious. <br />
<br />
On the upper floors of certain buildings and in back-stage apartments, the non-combatant staff of corrupted humans and lust demons took cover, those on the upper floors of buildings in the visitor area taking great pains to be invisible. All held their breath. Code Reds were very rare, this being only the fourth one in the history of the park. No one could remember one this serious.<br />
<br />
=============================================================<br />
<br />
The steel door to the main holding cell slammed down to the floor with a might crash beneath Matt’s flashing bronze hooves as he lead the charge, Don and Paul following immediately behind. It was bent and warped as it’s fastenings were ripped from the stone, but was quickly pummeled flat beneath the metallic hooves of the warrior demons as they charged from the cell.<br />
<br />
Three hinny demons armed with tasers and small caliber weapons were over run before they reached the security door at the end of the hall. The weapons bounced off Matt’s metallic scales, in fact he laughed because they tickled him. Matt trampled the hapless defenders with his hooves and ate their souls without even slowing his charge.<br />
<br />
Matt brought the troops to a halt before the security door. Two hinny demon guards opened fire with assault rifles from firing ports in the floor control center. These did more than tickle causing Matt to flinch slightly, but the pain turned pleasurable thanks to Matt’s warped nervous system. With an orgasmic smile on his face Matt roared and unleashed his flaming breath weapon. <br />
<br />
The flames crashed into the door heating it and licked through the firing ports into the floor control center. The bulletproof windows next to the firing ports melted exposing the defenders to direct attack. The startled defenders jumped back while trying to put out the flaming debris in their fur. <br />
<br />
Don stepped forward and howled, unleashing his sonic attack. The defenders cried out dropping their weapons and clutching their ears. All the remaining glass in the command center shattered. The defenders collapsed dead on the ground, blood streaming from their ears. The defender’s souls were drawn to Don who ate them without even thinking, an orgasmic grin now spread across his face. <br />
<br />
Paul charged the door slamming into it with his massive bull head. The door flew back and did not even slow Paul down as his momentum carried his charge through the second security door beyond, the high tensile strength steel ripping like tissue paper. Matt roared and the charge continued in Paul’s wake. <br />
<br />
Beyond the second security door lay two more surprised defenders and the ramp up to the ground floor of the jail. Their bullets bounced off the two shredded doors stuck on Paul’s horns. The defenders died smashed between the door wreckage and the wall. Little more than bloody smears were left on the wall. Paul bellowed as he ripped the bloody shredded steel from his horns and ate the defender’s souls.<br />
<br />
At this point the three brothers met at the bottom of the ramp, each sporting an orgasmic leer and a lance jutting between their forelegs. “Time to joust”, proclaimed Matt as he clanged his metal cock off both of his brothers. All three engaged in an orgy of howls, roars, and bellows as their cocks smashed and clanged against each other. Their metallic balls clanged and churned in their armored sacs. The army stood back watching.<br />
<br />
Finally the brothers erupted, their steel cocks spewing acidic cum with magical properties. Every wound touched by the cum instantly healed. The brothers hosed each other down from nose to tail, than sprayed their troops.<br />
<br />
A shout of “Grenade!” from one of the troops galvanized the army as they trotted back from the ramp just in time to avoid two small explosions.<br />
<br />
Matt snarled, “Time to take out the trash! We charge and we don’t stop till we are clear of this building!” Matt leapt to the lead once more, his brothers following behind, the rest of the army in their wake.<br />
<br />
===============================================================<br />
<br />
Thunderhooves arrived at the jail two minutes after receiving the page. Fortunately his quarters were next door to the jail. He received reports indicating the hinny demons were being chewed up like a ripe apple. That was fine with him. <br />
<br />
As far as Thunderhooves was concerned these little sadistic darlings of the boss were over-rated and useless for any real combat. He’d like to see them all die and would be grateful to the escapees for the outcome. The ones remaining inside the building were totally expendable. He gave a quick order that they defend the building’s main entrance from the inside. He hoped it would get them all killed and buy him enough time to set up a kill zone in the courtyard. <br />
<br />
As the teams arrived he quickly positioned them. The combat teams with the high powered weapons were stationed on the walls overlooking the courtyard. Capture teams were positioned under cover both inside and outside the main gate with upgraded weapons. Thunderhooves ordered the recon and processing teams be issued high powered assault weapons and stationed across from the main gate to fire through it into the courtyard. <br />
<br />
The gate it’s self was not a concern as it was an arrangement of steel bars. Given the capabilities the escapees had already exhibited it would be little more than a speed bump anyway. Like the hinny demons it too was expendable.<br />
<br />
Thunderhooves claimed an anti-tank bazooka that Poinus had procured from the black market at his request. This technological weapon had been enchanted to instantly reload as long as unspent ammo remained nearby. He had six rapid fire shots. His plan was to pound one of the leaders into submission and hopefully slow them down so they could be captured or killed. <br />
<br />
Thunderhooves desperately wanted to capture one of the leaders as they seemed to possess incredible power, and he had many questions. This time bureaucracy and the hinny demons would not stand in the way of a proper old school interrogation. He would have it done before Ponius even received a report.<br />
<br />
“All units, hold fire till you have a clear target. Stand ready.” Thunderhooves crouched down behind an armored vehicle across from the main gate.<br />
<br />
Barely were the units in position when the sound of explosions and gunfire reported from inside the building. Black smoke gushed out as the doors flew open….</p>
