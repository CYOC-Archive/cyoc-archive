<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Kaylee,&quot; Jensen asked some time after Fran and Darla had left along with his newest <br />
daughters. &quot;Did you find what I asked you to and double check to make sure it was a <br />
human free zone and didn't have any natural inhabitants that could permanently harm the <br />
pups?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I did Master.&quot; Kaylee said, rather repulsed she had been made to actual -work- when <br />
they had plenty of she wolves to do the work for them, &quot;It was a headache to find and <br />
finding any useful info' on it was drudgery but yeah, I found one that matched your <br />
description.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen spoke surprisingly calm, &quot;Good. Be sure to give Alice, Abby, and Samantha the <br />
precise location.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right: Nothing Island In the Middle of the Nowhere Sea. Easy enough to remember.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Better be. If anything goes wrong, and we need to abandon the mansion, that's where <br />
we'll relocate to.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaylee stared in total and complete  -shock-. &quot;What? But... but before you wanted to stay <br />
at the mansion no matter what! You didn't want the hard work of the pack to go to waste!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen with a strange look in his eyes leaned back in the couch/chair and said, &quot;Yes, I did. <br />
But that was before...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Before what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Before.. I...&quot; Jensen spoke as if he had trouble getting the words out, &quot;Before I started to <br />
think about the pups if it came down to holding onto the mansion to the end.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But why that one? It's in international waters, it's in the middle of military, economic, and <br />
political limbo! It has no strategic importance, no political worth, and is far too away from <br />
anything to function as a vacation site!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly.&quot;  Jensen said, &quot;No humans will ever bother us there. And any cast away who by <br />
stupid chance stumble on us will be done by Alice or Martha.  If we need to abandon the <br />
mansion, the children are to go first, then the pack, then us, Jack and Marcine and as much <br />
of their herd as possible, and finally the gargoyles, the shadows will remain behind to take <br />
care of any final matters. And to burn it down if we really are faced with an overwhelmingly <br />
superior magical or military force.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But..&quot; Kaylee said, &quot;The game can't be used outside of Glendale! It'll be worthless!&quot; Kaylee <br />
didn't like the idea of losing power.<br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly, which means no one will be able to 'Transform or Dare' our pack or ourselves <br />
back into the lowly humans we used to be.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaylee still didn't like it. &quot;That would mean no electricity...no television... no wii... no game <br />
boy... NO INTERNET!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen guessed that the last part came from Kaylee's former life as the geeky Kyle. &quot;Don't <br />
worry dear, this is only going to be an emergency last resort. For if we find ourselves on <br />
the business end of the US army, or some Men In Black army whose duty is to prevent the <br />
strange and unknown from becoming known, or some absurd, contrived, cliche <br />
organization of magicians or mythicals whose single duty is to keep humanity docile and <br />
ignorant. Or any other situation which would make it impossible for us to stay in Glendale <br />
or the mansion with trouble that would follow us if we tried a more simple relocation.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaylee hugged her Master and mate, &quot;Master, I don't like that scenario at all...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Neither do I dear, neither do I.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Trevor didn't know what to expect, but to end up at the Smith estate wasn't one of them. <br />
Not everyone knew the Smiths. But Jennifer Smith had always made sure everyone at <br />
school knew her, and Trevor hadn't lost his ability to read words with his curse, only his <br />
ability to read dates, so the plaque on the wall facing the street was as plain as day to him. <br />
He wondered whatever happened to the princess of Glendale High, he wondered if she was <br />
in collage yet, so had always been so sexy, he had been near the top of her boyfriend <br />
waiting list when the second stringer cursed him. Just one more reason for Trevor to loath <br />
his fate.<br />
<br />
Surrounding the front gate was a squad of day workers as they were systematically taking <br />
apart the ornamental gate and replacing it with a slightly less ornamental one that looked <br />
like it could withstand a pounding from a SWAT Team van.<br />
<br />
Trevor of course saw the nasty but shapely looking gargoyles on the top of the walls, <br />
looking like a cross between something winged and scaly from Hades and the most <br />
intimidating werewolves ever produced by Hollywood. Trevor would have though how rich <br />
people were weird but there something that drew his attention a lot more.<br />
<br />
Standing at the front of the gate, talking to the apparent foreman and leaning against the <br />
wall with one arm underneath her furry breasts and another holding a cup of coffee was a <br />
naked humanoid she-wolf with dark blue fur. She was easily over six feet tall and actually <br />
looking down at the foreman who was also holding a cup of coffee. They were talking <br />
totally casually about the problems of being blamed for the mistakes of subordinates. <br />
<br />
Trevor just blinked, she didn't smell like the two scents he had been following. They were <br />
similar, but decidedly different 'people.' 'Oh who am I kidding? Do I still count as 'people' <br />
any less than they do?' Trevor thought. Then he got his head back in reality. <br />
<br />
'This is the place. It has to be.' Trevor concluded. What threw Trevor for a loop was how <br />
the apparent foreman was talking to the she-wolf as if he talked with naked women with <br />
fur all the time who were taller than him.  And none of the day workers were giving her <br />
any more of a look than any male would give an attractive lady (maybe a bit more). <br />
<br />
'Are they all Dared?' Trevor wondered, remembering how Madam Serenity said the game <br />
had been used a LOT lately.  Heck, for all he knew, the conditions of her Transform made <br />
it so no one considered her odd. Trevor remember Madam Serenity telling them that <br />
people did that a lot if they wanted their victim to suffer in silence unable to tell anyone <br />
things were wrong without coming across like a lunatic. <br />
<br />
Whatever it was, the answers were in there. The scent of the big wild dogs of course got <br />
stronger as Trevor skulked nearby. Those statues, it felt like they were watching him! But <br />
they were just stone right? I mean, if they were Transform victims then they couldn't move <br />
to begin with right?  Then again Trevor now had a brain the size of a peach and was able <br />
to remember every detail of his life with cruel crystal clarity. Who knew what else the game <br />
could do? If what Madam Serenity said was true and the game was the result of a long <br />
dead coven of witches who loved havoc, it might be a shorter list of what this sick game <br />
COULDN'T do! Ugh! He wished that he could shake the feeling those pieces of rock were <br />
watching him behind his back. He needed to stay focused so one of the day workers didn't <br />
step on his tail or he didn't get impaled by a stray steel rod. <br />
<br />
And the growing scent was making it harder and harder for him to ignore his instinct to <br />
just run away from what was ever going to eat him. He didn't even know if the dark blue <br />
werewolf wasn't going to eat him!!! <br />
<br />
He carefully with all the grace and agility that his body granted him moved past the <br />
foreman and blue she wolf... 'Why does everything except mice have to be bigger than me?<br />
' Trevor wondered. Trevor remembered when he ferreted out the kid turned into a mouse <br />
and managed to convince him he wasn't about to eat him... they both had to flee for their <br />
lives from a pack of hungry rats... Trevor swore some were bigger than him.    'As Sherlock <br />
Homes said, 'the giant rat of Sumatra, a story for which the world is not yet prepared.' '  All <br />
these distractions were doing wonders for keeping his primal fear under control, he was <br />
past the she wolf and foreman, -and- those creepy statues. Or so he hoped, &quot;And where <br />
do you think you're going?&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor fanged his own tongue and tasted blood to keep from screeching like violin strings. <br />
<br />
&quot;Queen!&quot; He said in a hushed voice even thought it was unlikely the wolf could understand <br />
them. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello to you too. If you want to be a dare devil, there are less suicidal ways to do it.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing here?!&quot; Trevor said at wits end and using all his will power to keep <br />
from screaming. <br />
<br />
&quot;Following you. You still owe me a deposit at the bank, and I'm not leaving until I collect.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I never signed a check!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;It's your species honor and obligation to continue Bast's perfect species.&quot;<br />
<br />
'It's pronounced 'Bastet' you stupid cat.' Trevor thought, 'Then again, maybe the cats have <br />
the right translation-WHY AM I THINKING ABOUT THIS NOW?!' <br />
<br />
&quot;Look! This is very dangerous!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Care about me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not in the least! But if you're along I'm more likely to get caught!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And there's no way I can change your mind?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not in the least.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I'm coming with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No offense, but you're a house cat, you simply don't have the experience that an <br />
unfettered felidae like me has when it comes going in a dog infested house you don't <br />
belong... so tell me, is this the important thing you needed to take care of for your human?<br />
&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sort of....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Always mysterious as well as strange.. I'm going to figure you out if it's the last thing I do <br />
my tom. So tell me? Did you use your human's help to find this place or by yourself?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Doesn't matter.&quot; Trevor said seeing where this was going. <br />
<br />
&quot;Is that so?...&quot; Queen said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes that so. And my name is Trevor not tom.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't need a name, shouldn't want a name, shouldn't have a name. Names are a <br />
human thing.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You can't take a name back once it's been given. And maybe humans have some good <br />
ideas if you bothered to learn.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why should I have to learn anything from them?&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor was beginning to suspect the real reason most animals stayed where they did on <br />
the evolutionary ladder (having flunked biology Trevor didn't know evolution didn't work <br />
like that).  &quot;You don't know that until you try.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pst. Whatever. I'm just here to make sure my bank doesn't foreclose before I get the <br />
return on my investment.&quot;<br />
<br />
'Bad luck on that.' Trevor thought as he continued to move foreword with Queen close <br />
behind him. <br />
<br />
The Grotesque 'Front Door' and his female shaped subordinates saw no reason to care <br />
about some cat wandering in the yard meowing to each other, what possible threat could <br />
they be? And moving to deal with such an insignificant pair of nothings in plain sight of <br />
the human construction workers was a High Risk, Low Gain scenario and ultimately just <br />
not worth their time. <br />
<br />
&quot;I've got ask...&quot; Trevor said, &quot;How did you find me?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You've been over half of Glendale, what do you think?&quot; Queen responded as if the answer <br />
was obvious. <br />
<br />
&quot;I see... &quot; Trevor sighed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why are you helping your human like this anyway? it's not like your some dog who doesn't <br />
know how to think about itself once in a blue moon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe because there are things greater than one's self, and the self.&quot;<br />
<br />
Queen actually pause at that her animal brain wondering what Trevor meant. Did he mean <br />
the species as a whole? But he seemed to be sulking his responsibilities in that <br />
department or she'd be with kitten again by now. So what did he mean? <br />
<br />
That was when Queen quickly got closer to Trevor and pulled him back. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey-what-&quot;<br />
<br />
That was when a big violet she wolf and a smaller child purple one being carried on her <br />
shoulders. <br />
<br />
&quot;You almost marched right into them.&quot; Queen said sternly, &quot;Keep your head out of the <br />
clouds or you're going to lose it, Trevor.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor looked at her for several seconds, said nothing, and continued foreword, having no <br />
clue that was the cat way of saying with no irony or sarcasm: 'Thank You Very Much!' <br />
<br />
Queen smirked at that and now followed along side him at a more relaxed pace (which for <br />
a cat was something else to see!). <br />
<br />
Tevor strangely didn't feel as eager to run away now with a fellow cat nearby. And now, <br />
thinking about it -logically- he should have turned and ran right back to Madam Serenity <br />
and told her precisely where he saw the she-wolf... 'Dangit! Cat curiosity!' Trevor thought <br />
with thundering realization. And Trevor knew what curiosity did to cats. <br />
<br />
 But Trevor now that he was here, didn't know if he could go back in without rousing <br />
suspicion from whoever now lived her (it was perfectly possible some greedy selfish <br />
pervert had just taken a random mansion for himself and turned the Smiths into sex crazy <br />
wolf women who spent all day servicing the fat slob). <br />
<br />
Madam Serenity said that the men who normally created harems like this, as she had <br />
suggested was likely the case, grew increasingly arrogant and self deluded the more they <br />
used the game to ensnare more women into their sick fantasies.  Trevor almost wondered <br />
if it was the second stringer who had stolen his life. If it was. Trevor would claw his eyes <br />
out, or throat, or nose, whatever his claws sank into first. <br />
<br />
Trevor felt Queen bite his tail. <br />
<br />
&quot;OW! You-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Getting inside.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Through the front door?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor started, that was, pretty much, exactly what he was about to do. <br />
<br />
Queen sniffed the air a few times, then began to lead -him- &quot;Follow me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you think-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You want in or do you want to be eaten?&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor followed. <br />
<br />
Queen led him to the side of the household, downwind. Queen systematically scanned <br />
some of the windows, Trevor followed her eyes. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, fewer of the mutts that know we're here the better, don't stop to look at them, <br />
don't stop to chat with them, don't stop to make faces at them, just keep moving and <br />
maybe they won't give us mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor nodded. There weren't any pet doors, but the two violet colored wolves from before <br />
came in, and Trevor and Queen quickly followed in their wake. The smell in side was <br />
overwhelming. <br />
<br />
&quot;You stupid tom please, let's just go!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not keeping you were.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes you are! I promised to have your litter and I keep my promises like any proper cat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought proper cats never gave straight answers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You HAVE been spending too long with humans: That only applies when dealing with <br />
non-felidae.&quot; <br />
<br />
Personally, Trevor had never thought of cats of -ever- keeping promises, they did was <br />
suited their whims, nothing more. <br />
<br />
&quot;So what are you looking for precisely?&quot; Queen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You ask that now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Didn't really matter until now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor sighed. &quot;I'll know it when I see it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Queen made no reply. <br />
<br />
The two cats, now in a kitchen smelling of blood and meat, began to systematically <br />
explore the (to them) cavernous house.  Following Queen's instructions, Trevor didn't <br />
speak to any of the wolves. If 'wolves' was the best way to describe them. No wolf Trevor <br />
had ever seen were the colors he was beholding. And since when did wolves go on two <br />
legs and have maternal material shaped like THAT?  Trevor decided that the only way to <br />
find out what he would likely need to know, was to do the exact opposite of what he felt <br />
the urge to do, and go more towards the smell of danger. Queen herself thought Trevor <br />
had simply gone insane, but her own curiosity won over her too. <br />
<br />
'Just how many are there?' Trevor thought as he saw naked she-wolf after naked she-wolf <br />
going about daily routines or just killing time. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; Said a blue-green she-wolf to a teal she wolf, &quot;What's with the cats?&quot; <br />
<br />
The teal she wolf replied, &quot;Oh don't worry about it, I'm sure they're just pets for the <br />
Master's new children.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;New children?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh you haven't seen them yet? They're so cute! And they're just like Alice!&quot;<br />
<br />
'Alice?' Trevor thought. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh? Where are they then?&quot; The blue-green asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh don't worry about it Terri, I'm sure Master will formally introduce them to us at dinner <br />
time.&quot;<br />
<br />
'Master huh? At least that clinches the whole 'harem' theory, if all the naked women <br />
weren't a big enough clue... but why would the owner of a harem have kids? That's about <br />
the last thing any pervert wants! They're interested in the fun part not the responsibility <br />
afterwards...' <br />
<br />
Trevor took note that all the doors in the house were gone from what he saw, and nearly <br />
all the furniture, and the whole place smelled like a kennel, which for Trevor and Queen <br />
might as well have been the next layer of Hades!  <br />
<br />
That was when Trevor picked up a scent that threw him for a loop. A chihuahua. Among <br />
the storm of scent of super wolves it stood out like a sore thumb.  <br />
<br />
'Wait... this scent... couldn't be... didn't Mrs. Butler's girls have.. oh no.' <br />
<br />
Trevor dashed in one particular direction with a frantic Queen following him. <br />
<br />
They stopped at an opening revealing a study filled with books, but that wasn't what drew <br />
Trevor's attention. <br />
<br />
Inside were two nine year olds, two seven year olds, and a slightly older seven year old. All <br />
of them naked wolf people. The older girl had glistening black fur, while the others had <br />
reddish brown fur, the slightly older one was walking talking glass! <br />
<br />
'Thank goodness,' Trevor thought, 'None of them are the right age for Mrs. Butler's kids.' <br />
But his heart sank at the sight of a vaguely familiar smelling Chihuahua sleeping very <br />
nervously.  There was also a silvered she wolf who looked right out of Hindu mythology, a <br />
two headed monster with four arms, four breasts and a pair of tails... Then Trevor noticed <br />
her eyes were solid red and each head had an extra eye in it's forehead. <br />
<br />
'What kind of thing from a nightmare is that?' Trevor wondered. <br />
<br />
&quot;They're taking over the world.&quot; Queen said plainly with an undertone of dismay. <br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe...&quot; Trevor replied. <br />
<br />
&quot;So you finally have sisters.&quot; Said the smallest girl to the glass one.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do not be silly!&quot; The glass one laughed, &quot;I had sister before with you and Jenny, so I now <br />
merely have -more- sisters.&quot; <br />
<br />
'Oh crude.' Trevor thought, the word -Doom- flashing through his head. <br />
<br />
&quot;So their mom will be coming here soon too?&quot; Asked the oldest girl, Jenny.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; The glass one nodded, &quot;They promised they would be there when mom and Auntie <br />
brought Auntie Julie into the pack, so it is only proper they be present.&quot; <br />
<br />
Trevor turned his head to see a neighboring room which was empty and had the window <br />
open ever so slightly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Follow me.&quot; Trevor whispered to Queen as they tip toed into the empty room and the <br />
open window.<br />
<br />
&quot;We're leaving?&quot; Queen said doing her absolute best not to sound relieved. <br />
<br />
&quot;Not yet. Stay out of sight and don't say anything,&quot; Trevor said, &quot;I'm going to get some <br />
information out of them and then we get out of here like Hades.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Information? How?&quot; Queen tilted her head, &quot;And what could a bunch of mutant monster <br />
wolf pups know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hopefully enough. And I'm going to ask them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What-?!&quot; Said a gasp, &quot;BUT-but that's impossible!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Not for me....&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Trevor... -what- are you?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;... I'll tell you after we get out of here.&quot; <br />
<br />
Trevor squeezed out of the window and Queen reluctantly followed, the decrease in wolf <br />
smell was a Godsend in of itself. <br />
<br />
Trevor inched along the windowsill, pressing his body against the side of the building, <br />
carefully bringing himself to the window that led into the study. Queen was a safe <br />
distance behind him. <br />
<br />
Still safely downwind, Trevor scratched at the glass, and repeated this several times until <br />
he got of the wolf pup's attention, in this case the glass one, who curiously followed the <br />
sound to it's source and looked outside. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! It is a cat! I wonder what it wants!&quot; Asked Alice, &quot;What do you want?&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor dared speak. &quot;Just to come inside and have a friendly chat.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice gasped in surprise, &quot;It spoke!&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor was fully ready to go into a spiel about being a magic cat, but instead the youngest <br />
girl answered. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, if we can understand Chester, maybe we can understand other pets too?&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor knew better than to try and contradict them. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well if you can understand me, would you mind letting me in for just a bit?&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice not a drop of malice inside her opened up the window and Trevor gracefully jumped <br />
in. <br />
<br />
&quot;So who are all of you?&quot; Trevor asked not trying to be too direct.<br />
<br />
&quot;These are Master and Alpha Female's pups, Bart, Jenny, Kevin, and Marcy, all of us of the <br />
Big Bad Wolf Pack.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Howdy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you a magic cat?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor stiffened, then he remembered, &quot;Cats rarely give straight answers.&quot; <br />
<br />
Alice thought of the Cheshire Cat, &quot;True.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am Martha, Pack Omega, I am the governess and nanny to the pack's pups.&quot; Said the <br />
silver monster's two heads together. <br />
<br />
&quot;And I am Alice.&quot; The glass wolf figure mimed a curtsy. <br />
<br />
&quot;Is this all of you there are?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot; Alice said, &quot;We just got some new siblings, Abbey and Samantha.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor did his best to hide his absolute horror at that statement. &quot;Who are their parents?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, their father is our father too.&quot; Alice said, &quot;And one of their mothers is the twin of my <br />
mother, so that makes them both my half-sisters and my cousins.&quot;<br />
<br />
'Other Mother. Check. Looks like Frank ended up a wolf woman after all.' Trevor thought <br />
grimly. <br />
<br />
&quot;So what about their.... mothers?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;One of their mothers, Samantha's, is already part of the pack, and so is mine. But soon <br />
Abbey's will too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How is that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Some odd lady told their mother to go away to Frostvile and not stay at home. But Abbey <br />
and Samantha left me a note on where to find them and their mother, and I was able to <br />
help them become like me using the reflection on the TV.&quot;<br />
<br />
'Without the game?! In Frostvile?! Don't jump to conclusions! But still... did this girls' <br />
transform give her the power to transform others? Oh crude.' <br />
<br />
 Alice continued, &quot;They left another note to their mom, now in writing instead of pictures, <br />
to come to 3452 Hiss Street here in Glendale as soon as she could. Mama and Auntie will <br />
be waiting there with a turn of the Game for her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Game?&quot; Trevor replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes! It's the game of 'Transform or Dare', I already used my turn so it doesn't matter if I <br />
say it, but if some of my siblings said it, you'd have to answer transform or dare and-&quot; <br />
Trevor tuned it out, having heard the rules to the game a hundred times. &quot;-Father used <br />
the game a lot to improve everybody who lived here including us!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;We didn't live here before.&quot; Kevin spoke up.<br />
<br />
&quot;You do now.&quot; Alice pointed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh right.&quot; Kevin nodded. <br />
<br />
&quot;Father used the game to create protectors for us, food for us, family for us, father is so <br />
wonderful!&quot; Alice clapped.<br />
<br />
Trevor shuddered, &quot;So... when are you going to curse-I mean improve Abbey and <br />
Samantha's mom?&quot;<br />
<br />
The pups were confused a bit by his stutter but said nothing. <br />
<br />
Queen meanwhile... gears were turning around in her head, 'What Trevor Dared to act <br />
strange so no female would mate with him?... No... that wouldn't explain how he can <br />
speak like humans unless... but that's impossible... But what if it isn't?' <br />
<br />
&quot;We're going as soon as Abbey and Samantha get back with Mr. P.&quot; Alice explained, &quot;He's <br />
showing them our bedroom before we go.&quot;<br />
<br />
That was when Trevor picked up a scent that all the wolves put together so far didn't make <br />
him this scared. Scared? He was petrified! <br />
<br />
Coming into the room, a black and gold wolf that made biggest, meanest, most ill-<br />
tempered pitbull Trevor had met seem like a friendly puppy in comparison.  It was going <br />
on four legs, and on top of it, was riding two five year old girl glass wolf pups. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Mr. P.&quot; Alice said politely, &quot;Please meet our new friend Trevor.&quot; <br />
<br />
The monstrous beast came closer and closer to Trevor. Trevor screamed at his legs to <br />
move but they wouldn't. His felt his hairs all standing up as he instinctually tried to make <br />
himself look larger. <br />
<br />
&quot;So Abbey, Samantha,&quot; Jenny said nicely. &quot;What do you think of our room?&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor terror was broken at the sound of the names just enough.<br />
<br />
The five year old glass pups didn't answer, instead one of them (they looked alike) leaned <br />
foreword and pointed, &quot;Hey, I think that's that weird lady's cat. The one who told mommy <br />
and us to go away.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What's his collar say?&quot; Jenny asked.<br />
<br />
Trevor ran. He ran out the second story window. He fell, and landed squarely on his feet <br />
on the grass. Behind him he heard something very large snarl and the sound of a cracking <br />
window. Trevor didn't waste time looking behind him, he just ran. <br />
<br />
In the backyard out of sight of the construction crew, BackDoor and the other two <br />
backyard gargoyles saw the giant wolf chasing the cat, but Mr. P hadn't been given <br />
information about the Gargoyles, and thus didn't call them to capture the mangy animal.  <br />
It would have likely resulted in two of the gargoyles butting head anyway as the fast and <br />
agile small target fled the giant wolf. <br />
<br />
Trevor didn't think. He just ran. He ran between the legs of some wild deer that nealy <br />
impaled him on their hooves as they in a wild panic spread apart for the chasing Big Bad <br />
Wolf. Trevor ran up a tree without thinking. Mr P. snarled and snapped and for a few <br />
seconds Trevor dared think he was relatively safe. Until Mr. P began to jump up and TEAR <br />
OFF the branch Trevor was on as if it was a match stick!  Then it bit into one of his <br />
tangling legs, nearly going -through- it, grazing him before the jaws snapped shut below. <br />
The desire to live overrode all pain. <br />
<br />
Trevor leapt to another, and another, but Mr. P was always right there behind him, <br />
removing his avenues of escape one by one. 'I'm going to die! I'm going to die! I can't die! <br />
Madam Serenity needs to know about this place! I have to warn her! I have to tell her! BUT <br />
I'M GOING TO DIE!'  And the secret of this place was about to die with him. <br />
<br />
He ran madly behind some leaves, madly thinking that somehow Mr P. wouldn't find him <br />
here even though he had seen him go in there in plain sight. Already the beast began to <br />
tear the limb off the tree to drop Trevor into his waiting jaws, Trevor held onto the mad <br />
hope that somehow Mr. P would think he had moved on and move on himself, he began to <br />
lose his grip with the giant wolf right below him. <br />
<br />
Trevor heard a hiss and a snarl and another tabby flashed past him like furry lightning <br />
right into Mr. P's face. <br />
<br />
&quot;QUEEN!&quot; He screamed but neither seemed to hear him over the noise that came at the <br />
same time as Queen with all four sets of claws unsheathed came down on Mr. P's face, <br />
hissing and clawing at the giant wolf's nose, snout, eyes and ears. Blood stained Queen's <br />
claws as she cut into Mr. P's sensitive flesh. <br />
<br />
Queen cut at the monster's nose. It whimpered and howled. 'What is this monster?! <br />
Cerberus?! DOESN'T MATTER! Just like it doesn't matter if Trevor WAS a human or not... <br />
he's part of Bast's perfect species now, and he's going to be MY mate!' <br />
<br />
Mr. P cursed as the tabby suddenly chose to change tactic and apparently wanted to die <br />
fighting! Then the bloody thing cuts at his nose! The pain stroked like a sword blade <br />
through him. The cat madly tore into his face, red being everywhere. <br />
<br />
'I have to end this now before it gets an eye!' Mr. P though as the claws cut deeper into his <br />
face, into muscles and bones. <br />
<br />
Trevor stood transfixed by the sight. Queen taking on a dog beast only about five or <br />
twenty times her size! She tirelessly tore him like a small swirling mass of claws and fangs.  <br />
The beast rammed it's own head into a tree, Queen got off just in time and the entire tree <br />
shook nearly knocking Trevor out of the tree. <br />
<br />
Every instinct inside Trevor told him to run like Hades. To flee. To escape. To survive! To <br />
live! <br />
<br />
The beast now chased after Tabby, and from his hiding place among the leaves he spotted <br />
the wolf cubs at the window along with the silver wolf. He saw the rainbow colored she <br />
wolves coming to the back windows too.  The fear got stronger. <br />
<br />
Queen tore at the front of one of the beast's legs, cutting into the flesh underneath, being <br />
a tiny bit too fast for him to capture with his jaws as he nipped the end of her tail.  Queen <br />
cut her claws along his gold belly. And the monster simply let the entire weight of his body <br />
down on top of her. <br />
<br />
Trevor's eyes went wide.<br />
<br />
The gold and black monster got up, underneath it, Queen twitched and tried to move, half <br />
the bones in her body broken. She got up all the same. She hissed and snarled at him and <br />
attacked again, he easily caught her with no paw, her element of surprise gone and her <br />
body now too clumsy to spring board at him. He crushed the bones already broken, <br />
cutting into internal organs and muscle, one or two even breaking skin. <br />
<br />
The mix of blood and stink and the sheer CHAOS making it impossible to tell from scent <br />
this wasn't the tom who escaped. Mr. P didn't look to see the gender of the cat he was <br />
holding, and no one from this distance could see if the cat had a collar or not and didn't <br />
bother to keep a tally on where he bad bitten it before or not. <br />
<br />
Queen struggled to move, then she felt the monster's jaws around her head, then horrible <br />
pain, then no pain at all, and an odd sense of flying before she hit the ground. She saw the <br />
beheaded corpse of a tabby and hoped it wasn't Trevor's. The monster began to tear the <br />
body to shreds, before it turned towards her. It had been day, why was it turning to night? <br />
<br />
'Trevor is sure to mate with me after this... I did just save his life... I wonder what good, <br />
heh, names for our kittens would be: Princess, Prince, Trinni, Quinn, Kathy...' The giant <br />
beasts moved over from the recognizable red mess and brought it's heavy paw down on <br />
top of Queen to the noise of a sickening crunching sound. <br />
<br />
+++<br />
<br />
A few blocks away, Trevor moved with a limp, trailing blood behind him, only hoping the <br />
wolves didn't follow it, half hoping that Queen would. If he had been human his body <br />
would have been covered with sweat. His eyes were glazed over as he moved, struggling to <br />
just put one paw in front of the other, completely disoriented.  <br />
<br />
'Have to.. I'm a coward.... tell Madam... I'm a coward... Serenity that... I'm a coward... the <br />
place the wolves' nest is... I'm a coward... the Smiths... I'm the only who knows... I'm a <br />
coward... can't pass out, just can't... I'm a coward... because... I'm a coward...'<br />
<br />
Trevor's eyes rolled in the back of his head as he fell onto his side as darkness took him. <br />
<br />
++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Wake up... please wake up.. it's okay... you're safe now... wake up Trevor... wake up!&quot;<br />
<br />
A noise invaded the darkness... he was a coward.... a noise invaded his darkness... he was <br />
a coward...<br />
<br />
&quot;WAKE UP! Please! You might not wake up at all!&quot;<br />
<br />
Wake up? He was a coward. Was that an important thing? He was a coward. He always got <br />
up early. He was a coward. <br />
<br />
&quot;Trevor! Please!&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor opened his eyes.... the light was of course painful...  a black outline with triangle <br />
ears an slumped shoulders became visible. <br />
<br />
&quot;Queen...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot; Said a tom's voice. Trevor's voice focused on a black cat with green eyes, &quot;My name <br />
is Judas.  You're Trevor yes? It was the name on your collar.&quot;<br />
<br />
He was a coward. &quot;Yes, that's my name. Where-where am I?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In safety. In sanctuary. With friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor tried to turn over, but found that was painful, he looked down to see his body was <br />
bandaged. He rolled his eyes around to see he was in a church. &quot;Wha... what-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Father found you and brought you in... we've, that is Father has already called your <br />
human...  it's okay, you're safe now, no one is going to hurt you here. I promise.&quot; Judas <br />
said in a kind voice. <br />
<br />
Trevor tried to get his mind back in order. He was a, &quot;I... what... how...&quot; He couldn't think <br />
of a proper answer or question to give to anything. <br />
<br />
&quot;It's alright, just rest... you don't need to say anything...I just need to make sure you <br />
weren't going into a coma or something awful.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor didn't want to relax, he tried to focus on something -anything- he ended up on the <br />
very last thing any straight male would, &quot;You're not neutered.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Father doesn't believe in such things. He simply keeps me away from the cat with scissors <br />
and from mollies in heat. Self control and know when you wouldn't be able to control <br />
yourself is part of the faith after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Faith?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Im Catholic Christian.&quot; Judas said with absolutely no hint of humor or cynicism. <br />
<br />
Trevor felt a headache, &quot;You're kidding...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think it's that strange?&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor replied at once, &quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it's not like most cats NEED to be Christian anyway. The Savior came for the sick, not <br />
the healthy. =&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What about you?&quot;<br />
<br />
The collared black cat said simply, &quot;My great-great-great-great-who-actually-cares-<br />
mother was a witch's familiar who delighted in reeking havoc.  My line has been making <br />
up for it ever since. I don't know if her mistakes count as mine or not, but I feel my line <br />
owes to the world and the people in Glendale in general.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You do realize that the catholic church once declared black cats to be agents of the devil <br />
right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A sweeping generalization that has since been rectified.&quot; Judas said simply.<br />
<br />
Trevor groaned again. <br />
<br />
&quot;If you ever need a safe place, there's a spot at the back of the church you can use as a <br />
sanctuary.&quot;<br />
<br />
 &quot;Sorry, I'm Lutheran.&quot;<br />
<br />
Judas looked at him oddly for a second before saying, &quot;All the same, you're welcome to <br />
rest here any time you feel the need to. One has to help those who can't help themselves.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor then asked a very simple question. &quot;Do you believe you, us cats, have souls?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Personally, I have thought about it, and realized it is a moot point. If Heaven is reserved <br />
for the selfless, and Hell is reserved for the selfish, then how could animals, who simply -<br />
are-, neither good or evil, possibly enter?&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor realized he was close to engaging in a Protestant verses Catholic debate with a cat <br />
and chose to VERY wisely drop the matter. &quot;How long was I out?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Over an hour, I've spent the last five minutes getting you awake, you human should be <br />
here any second now.&quot;<br />
<br />
'Over an hour-?!' Trevor felt a thunder clap. You are a coward. 'Mrs. Bulter... I'm sorry, we'll <br />
save you, I promise.'</p>
