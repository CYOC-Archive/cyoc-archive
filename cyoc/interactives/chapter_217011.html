<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Radley asked, &quot;You said every wish MUST have a perverted twist to it. So what would a wish for world peace even look like?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tini subtly slowed down time around them so she could give her exposition uninterrupted. <br />
<br />
Tini smiled, her fangs showing, floating in the air and laying on her belly. &quot;Did you know there&#39;s a species of ape that instead of ripping each other&#39;s throats out, solve their disputes with orgies? It would be a simple matter to go back in time, and make it so humans evolved from them instead. Of course this would result in the complete rewriting of your history and civilization beyond recognition. Consider that one a free preview. As a rule I generally don&#39;t provide spoilers for what the twist on the wish will be, only reminding you that there WILL BE a pervy twist on the wish no matter what.&quot;<br />
<br />
Radley thought for a second. &quot;There must have been other people who have met you who asked for things like ruling the world, ending world hunger, and things like that. Did they just, not stick?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tini shook her head, and leaned back, like she was sitting in an invisible recliner, kicking her stubby feet up. &quot;Oh no, those work out, just in a very pervy way as I keep warning you. Well, it was fun for me at least. The point is, with those kinda masters, I just hang out until their immortal reign ends when the universe gets recycled for the NEXT Big Bang. Oh don&#39;t give me that look, I&#39;m a spirit, I&#39;m TIMELESS, what&#39;s 22 billion years to me? At that point, my vessel just warps to a new spot in time, space, and alternate universes, and I get to see someone else&#39;s flavor of pervy utopia. That&#39;s the masters who make it that far. And don&#39;t get hit by a truck, suffer a heart attack, get stabbed by a druggie for their wallet, that sort of thing. Trust me, you don&#39;t want to wish for pervy utopia right away, those masters quickly realize how much they cheated themselves out of enjoying the process. After all, utopia is perfection, and perfection is different for everyone. The only way for utopia to exist is for everyone&#39;s definition of perfection to be the same.<br />
<br />
&quot;And before you ask, don&#39;t bother wishing me free or some junk, I&#39;m not like a normal dijinn bound to serve. My service is literally part of who I am! Without it, I go poof. From the universe&#39;s point of view, you own my vessel, so you own me. I&#39;m your property, an object, you can be as kind as peaches or as cruel as needles, and I&#39;d still serve you with a sincere smile on my face. After all, either way, you&#39;re proving me with fun and games and I&#39;m fulfilling purpose as an obedient object. It pisses off the sadists, I can give myself blood and bones, the ability to feel pain, but since I&#39;m not SUFFERING, they don&#39;t get anything from it. It causes some weird feedback loop where I can&#39;t fulfill my purpose, so I suffer, but the moment I suffer, it vanishes, because that means I&#39;m fulfilling my purpose for them, and that&#39;s just bliss. So yeah, sadism, sexual or otherwise, is the one &#39;WHAT THE HECK!&#39; twisted stuff I can&#39;t do. <br />
 <br />
Tini also wanted to point out to Radley that all the people of the world were now his dolls to do with as he pleased with the power Tini granted him, but she knew she had to ease him into this, or he&#39;d dump her lamp somewhere and she&#39;d have to start over with someone else, and that was never fun. The fact he&#39;d felt guilt rather than excitement at seeing his &#39;not-girlfriend&#39; a naked foxy woman (heh), was proof he had scruples. <br />
<br />
Contrary to what her siblings thought, she had no interest in creating Hedonistic Hells where everyone was a giant jackass who only cared about their own pleasure and didn&#39;t give a damn about anyone else. Well, unless that was what her Master commanded of course. <br />
<br />
&quot;You say you&#39;re an imp and a genie, so how does that even work? Those aren&#39;t even from the same mythology. No offense.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s... a long story. Suffice to say, the fallen angels think I&#39;m wasting my talents are as sanctimonious and elitist as Hollywood thinks normal angels are. The beings of the smokeless fire are disgusted at me for not screwing over my master and embracing the Mark of Solomon rather than actively trying to resist or subvert it.&quot; <br />
<br />
Tini decided that was enough lecturing for now, and let time resume it&#39;s normal pace. <br />
<br />
Haley causally stepped out of the bathroom, she wasn&#39;t wearing the towel Radley had given her. <br />
<br />
Radley immediately looked the other way. &quot;Haley! I&#39;m sorry! Did the towel rip? Or you cursed not to wear clothes? I&#39;m sorry this happened to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Haley raised her paws defensively. &quot;Whoa whoa whoa! Slow down there partner! Look! I&#39;m sorry I did that stupid freak-out over something as normal as turning into a fox!&quot; Haley held her head. &quot;This is humiliating! At least only you saw me acting like a weirdo! I&#39;d never hear the end of it if anyone from school saw me having a fit over literally nothing.&quot;<br />
<br />
And Radley remembered, he&#39;d wished &quot;NOBODY was freaking out about Haley suddenly turning into a fox.&quot; That would logically include Haley herself. <br />
<br />
And the twist to Tini&#39;s wish had included weakening nudity taboos in western culture. So of course Haley would have no reason to freak out over being a fox or being naked. <br />
<br />
Tini had teleported behind Radley the moment Haley opened the door so she could enjoy the show. <br />
<br />
He also recalled Tini&#39;s reminder that Haley would enjoy or dislike this of her own free will. <br />
<br />
&quot;Haley... did you... LIKE being a fox now?&quot; <br />
<br />
Haley looked at Radley oddly. &quot;You&#39;re asking that? ... Well, I can&#39;t say I didn&#39;t fantasize about this happened to me like only a million times, even if my fursona was just a carbon copy of me. Boy was that embarrassing.&quot; She reached down and picked up the couch with one hand. &quot;Super-strength, able to trace my bloodline back to royalty. Gonna be in my prime my entire life. Straight-A student. Though the extra breasts are new.&quot; Haley causally felt them up in full view of Radley like they were just another part of her body. <br />
<br />
Radley knew none of those had been true before, Haley had been a girl who struggled to get by with Bs, had been of average athletic abilities, and her ancestors had been merchants. He also remembered... Haley had come up with her fursona when she was eleven, and had like most writers&#39; first creation, had been an idealized version of herself with the traits of her favorite heroes, she&#39;d even named ... her persona... after... herself. <br />
<br />
&quot;So what&#39;s wrong? Worried about your reputation as the best looking nerd at school now that your best friend&#39;s a foxgirl?&quot; Haley asked jovially. <br />
<br />
&quot;Reputation?&quot; Radley asked.<br />
<br />
Haley narrowed her eyes. <br />
&quot;Okay. What&#39;s going on? First I panic over the most normal thing in the universe. Then as soon as I calm down, you apologize like you did it, and ask me if I like being a fox. Then you act like you don&#39;t have a clue about your own rep? What&#39;s going on?&quot; Haley&#39;s ears twitched. &quot;Wait. I&#39;m sensing... magic!&quot; She looked down and pointed. &quot;From that!&quot;<br />
<br />
Radley hadn&#39;t remembered he was still holding Tini&#39;s bottle in his hand. <br />
<br />
&quot;A bottle radiating magic like a super nova? Wait a tick. Did you find a genie?! And you used one of your three wishes for me to be a fox girl!&quot; She hugged him. Radley&#39;s muscled tensed as he realized a naked fox woman was hugging him. &quot;The one thing that separated me from my fursona! But seriously, you shouldn&#39;t have wasted a wish on something as mundane as me turning into a fox.&quot; <br />
<br />
Radley struggled to remembered what other details Haley had given her fursona over the years. She&#39;d done revisions and retcons. After all, &#39;Haley&#39; the fox, had just been a whimsical fantasy, not something Haley the human had ever intended to be published. <br />
<br />
Radley said, &quot;I... I also wished for no one, accidentally including you, to find your change strange, and it had the side effect of people not finding being naked weird.&quot; <br />
<br />
Radley braced himself for Haley&#39;s anger, it never came. <br />
<br />
Haley made a face. &quot;People being naked and not turning into animal people ISN&#39;T supposed to be normal? Sorry but that&#39;s just way too weird for me. Do me a favor and DON&#39;T waste your last wish to undo it. I like this normal, thank you very much.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;And... it&#39;s not just three wishes. It&#39;s unlimited wishes, but each other has to come with some alluring or seductive twist.&quot; <br />
<br />
Haley tilted her head. &quot;Well, that&#39;s a losing game. Have you even read history? There was a time when women showing their ankles was considered sexy. And there are cultures were women being bare chested doesn&#39;t get anyone&#39;s attention... not sure why I brought that one up. But the point is, what&#39;s &#39;sexy&#39; and &#39;on the edge&#39; is constantly changing. Every time you push the envelop, the next wish will have to push it further, which for everyone, what came before is just normal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I... also wished to not be a skinny geek.&quot;<br />
<br />
Haley laughed. &quot;I can&#39;t -imagine- you as a skinny geek. A Hunky geek, but not a skinny one. All those punks are just jealous of you.&quot; Haley stretched up her arms and pushed her chest forward. &quot;So what are gonna wish for next? Turn all those jerks and losers who made you miserable into your harem?&quot;<br />
<br />
Radley startled. &quot;That&#39;s what you suggest?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, you&#39;re a Good Guy, they&#39;re Bad Guys, whatever you do to them is justified. And since you&#39;re a Good Guy, that means whatever you do is justified right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Haley said unironically with the black and white thinking of... of a character invented by a teenage girl. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sooo... when do I get to meet the tall beauty in the harem costume?&quot; Haley asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Two out of three ain&#39;t bad kiddo,&quot; Tini appeared right in front of her. <br />
<br />
&quot;An imp! ... And a genie? ... This makes my head hurt.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tini rolled her eyes. &quot;With all the fictional angel/demon hybrids you kids write as your poor misunderstood saintly badass, you think I wouldn&#39;t be that weird. I&#39;m Tini, the imp-genie of this lamp, and Master Radley&#39;s rightful object and property.&quot; Tini looked Haley up and down with a critical eye, one finger under her chin. &quot;I gotta say, you&#39;re not bad for my first official wish from my new master. Rough around the edges maybe, but definitely work I&#39;m proud of.&quot;<br />
<br />
Haley backed up. &quot;Uh, thanks.&quot; She looked at Radley. &quot;So any other wishes you want to tell me? Did you wish the sky blue? Did the internet not exist this morning?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh. No. Those are the only wishes I made so far.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Tini didn&#39;t turn me into a yandere, give me lime disease from ticks, nor kill all the astronauts or deep sea divers by making their protective gear vanish. So she isn&#39;t trying to make your life miserable while pretending to give you a free meal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;HEY! I&#39;m NOT that kinda genie, thank you very much! And you better remember it foxy!&quot; Tini floated up to Radley, once again &#39;laying&#39; her stomach on thin air. &quot;So Master! What shall we do next?&quot;</p>
