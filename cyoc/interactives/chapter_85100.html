<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brent went to the CI lab and paced back and forth, waiting for Maurice to get out of a meeting. Shi had an idea that was used in the vatican from the scientist. Shi had thought, &quot;If he could change Charlie from hir original kat to a scorpkat and we alter the scorpkat to a mantikat, what about altering me.&quot; Shi smiled then spotted Maurice as shi came out. &quot;Maurice, can I talk to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Certainly Brent. What&#39;s on your mind?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I was thinking, Elise and Kathy approached me about Kathy becoming what I am, but I don&#39;t want that.&quot; Shi said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, and why&#39;s that? I mean if shi want&#39;s shouldn&#39;t that be hir choice?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maurice, that&#39;s not my point. My point is this. I thought of what that scientist did in the Vatican with my brother. If he can do that, make it where he&#39;d become a scorpkat, I know there&#39;s a chance that you can do that with me to make me like everyone else.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, in theory it is possible.&quot; Shi looked. &quot;But it could be very much a risk to you, it&#39;d be best to wait until you lay your eggs before we do some tests.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know. I just want to see if we can&#39;t work on something. As much as I like my body, I want to see if I can&#39;t be... more like you guys.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come, I think you may get your wish. But if you&#39;re sure that the risks are worth it, then I can&#39;t stop you.&quot; Maurice walked in to the lab with Brent and got to work  on something. Took a sample of Brent&#39;s blood and then looked at the computer. &quot;Hmmm... let&#39;s see. Would you mind giving me a few weeks to work on this?&quot;<br />
<br />
Brent nodded. &quot;Sure. I think I&#39;m going to go lie down anyway, I&#39;ve not been feeling well as of late.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brent went home and stayed there for the next few weeks, not feeling to well. It was then that shi felt something stirring. Shi had asked Charlie to watch Kila for hir while shi got feeling better, but come the next morning shi woke to a feeling in her that shi needed to lay eggs. But it couldn&#39;t be that time already, could it? I mean shi didn&#39;t lay eggs but... right now shi didn&#39;t doubt anything was impossible. Shi lowered down and went to sleep. When shi work, shi had &quot;guests&quot; lying on hir back. When shi looked shi counted no less than twenty-one bodies. Shi looked. &quot;I think someone counted wrong.&quot; Shi looked and felt some sort of pride welling up inside of hir that shi never thought shi&#39;d feel. Shi walked out, careful not to wake the newborns.<br />
<br />
Hir first visitor was Janice, hir niece. &quot;Hello Brent. I came to see if...&quot; Shi looked behind hir and smiled. &quot;Wow, they&#39;re so cute.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Careful, I don&#39;t know if their poison is toxic and considering I&#39;m technically a new breed of kat and though, yes, you&#39;re amune to most illnesses, it&#39;s best to not take chances, Janice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay. But there seems to be one extra.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hun, that&#39;s life. You can&#39;t count every single one all the time.&quot; Shi smiled. &quot;Come, it&#39;s time to show your mom and dad their new nieces.&quot; Shi walked and as shi stepped out there were a dozen or so scorpkats on the streets looking around. They look hurt. Brent walked up to them. &quot;What&#39;s wrong, folks?&quot;<br />
<br />
One of them started speaking Italian as shi looked. &quot;Calm down. I&#39;ll get a translator. Janice, go find your mom. I think these folks need help.&quot; Shi said and went to go find Timothy, who was wrapped arm in arm with Ms. Jones. &quot;Tim, can I borrow you for a moment?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Certainly.&quot; Shi looked and kissed Casey on the lips.<br />
<br />
The two walked back and on the way Brent explained why he needs Tim&#39;s help. &quot;Oh so you need a translator. No biggy.&quot; Shi said.<br />
<br />
Sally and Charlie met them half way, at that moment Sally saw and tensed up, but Brent looked. &quot;Sally, I know what happened in the Vatican, but they need help. I feeling through my exoskeloton. And hun, the best way to get rid of your experience is experiencing the good they have.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sally nodded and took deep breaths. &quot;Brent, consider this a favor to you. But you owe me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Timothy walked up speaking to them. Brent counted twenty in all. Then shi realized, Charlie was only able to get thirty of them back to themselves. The rest were.... Shi walked up. &quot;They said they were kick strait out of Italy by the government for being an abomination.&quot; Tim said and walked back over.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s rediculous. It wasn&#39;t their fault that they&#39;re like this.&quot; Charlie said.<br />
<br />
&quot;No it wasn&#39;t.&quot; Brent said. &quot;And it looks to me, they&#39;ve had worse.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I agree. Well, next time Italy has an outbreak, if this is how they treat new kats, count me out. They can deal with it on their own.&quot; Charlie proclaimed. Shi walked up and patted one&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Hun, you&#39;re welcome to stay as long as you all like.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sally was shaking but looked, Brent was right. It&#39;s not their fault shi was raped in Cairo, nor nearly raped in the Vatican. Shi let the last tear drop before looking and walking right up to one of them, shi wrapped hir arms around hir. &quot;I&#39;m sorry for the trouble you&#39;ve experienced, hun.&quot; Shi let go and looked. &quot;We currently are building a home for those that come who wish to build their own homes. I&#39;ll personally show you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Timothy translated to them as Charlie looked. &quot;Love, you feeling okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m feeling great. In fact I&#39;m feeling like I&#39;m all new.&quot; Shi looked. &quot;It&#39;s not their fault these outbreaks happen, nor anything as a result.&quot; Shi walked to Brent and hugged hir. &quot;Thank you. You opened my eyes.&quot; Shi smiled and kissed hir cheek. That&#39;s when shi noticed, 21 eyes, staring right at hir. &quot;Brent, you&#39;re.... you had your children.&quot; Shi smiled. &quot;I&#39;ll be right back, I&#39;m going to get them settled in, Charlie, look on Brent&#39;s back.&quot; Shi giggled.<br />
<br />
As shi led the lot to the temporary building that shi spoke of and then met them at their home. &quot;Well, Brent,&quot; Charlie smiled. &quot;How&#39;s it feel?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I feel a since of pride, though there is going to be some jealousy. Kila won&#39;t be riding on my back for a while, and if things work out, shi may not be doing so again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have Maurice working on something to change me. I enjoy being a Scorpkat, I really do. I just.... I don&#39;t know. I wanna be different. I wanna be like you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Charlie smiled. &quot;Well, knowing Maurice and Snowy, they won&#39;t stop until they have something.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just as if on cue, a knock came to the door. Maurice walked in and smiled. &quot;Brent, I have wonderful news. It&#39;ll take a week to take full effect but... we can&#39;t completely change you, however, you will be a hybrid. It was what we were making originally for Kathy. With potencies, increased to overpower your current DNA. You won&#39;t be a mantikat, but you will be somewhat different. Your genitals will be on the outside at least.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brent smiled and hugged the kat. &quot;Thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shi smiled as they visited for awhile. Brent had to know about something though. So shi walked over to Kathy and tapped hir shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Brent. Maurice told us.&quot; She said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I thought that.... well.... you see, instead of you becoming like me, I&#39;m going to meet you half way. But there is one thing I need to ask first.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How long before I can let them down and all that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, all things considering.... it would be about one month minimum that they need your protection, thus why they rest on your back. Then they&#39;ll have their plates.&quot; Kathy said. &quot;Then they should be running around doing what children do. However I recommend getting their stinger&#39;s capped until they know how to properly use them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good idea.&quot; Brent smiled. Brent smiled as shi would wait that one month. Shi was glad that Maurice figured something out. But sadly it wasn&#39;t a guarantee that it would work. But it did give Brent hope. Shi would love her offspring no matter what though. Shi walked home and then made some food, fed hirself and hir little ones. Kila was home too, eating a sandwich. Brent explained that shi won&#39;t be riding on mommy anymore, but surprisingly, Kila took it well. Shi was just happy to have hir mommy.</p>
