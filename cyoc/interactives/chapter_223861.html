<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With his syringe ready Joel went to make preparations for his transformation, he got a full length mirror set up so he could receive a proper view of the changes, he set up a video camera pointed to where he plan to inject himself so he could record the experiment so his future self could prove his identity and show the results of his research, and once the camera was set he strip himself of his clothes revealing his skinny, pale naked body to the camera for a true recording of the transformation. With his prep done he grabbed the syringe and moved in front of the recording camera where he began monologuing “My name is Joel Maxwell Connors I am a fully emancipated minor with full knowledge of what I am about to do and for the longest time I have hated my body. At first I thought it was just hormones from puberty but as I grow older I find that I am unable to do anything to help shape my body into anything desirable, I have try dieting, exercising and meds but nothing works. My journey then lead me to genetics where I found that my DNA has a far greater percentage of ancient Homo-sapient genes than most other people. My conflicting genetics structure has made my body as it is today a weak struggling being and if my calculations are correct I’ll be lucky to see my 30th birthday due to failing health issues my body hates itself so much it is literally killing itself. I have created a serum to help rectify the error in my DNA as my more modern genes seem to be the ones attacking my prehistoric ones this formula will basically reset those genes into the ones they are attacking making them fully prehistoric. This will cause a massive transformation of my body to reflect my new genetic makeup practically turning me into an ancient homo sapient. Why I am doing this now is that I have found the transformation to be extremely intense to the body I must do it now when I’m still relatively healthy waiting until later could lead to a downturn in my health anytime whereupon the transformation if attempted would most surely kill although given my condition right now it might still end my life. But I am willing to take that chance. I am tried of being picked on for being weak, tried of being made fun of, tried of alway being out of breathe, tried of always being sick, tried that one misstep could break my leg, I am tried of being Joel”. With that Joel injected the syringe into his upper arm.<br />
<br />
As the serum ran through Joel’s bloodstream it started dividing and multiplying rapidly the chemical molecules reacting to the genetic warfare in Joel’s cells finding the non-prehistoric genes and turning themselves inside out to become full and stable DNA strands forever changing the cells which in turn affected the surrounding cells and their neighbors until entire organs changed. As this was happening Joel was witnessing the changes in the mirror first he saw that he was now growing in height his limbs stretching to longer lengths giving him a new height of 6’3” sadly his width didn’t change much keeping him fairly thin yet the muscles in his body felt thicker than before as he felt the different parts of his body he could tell they grew in strength yet had condensed themselves into more compact forms. Although at first disappointed Joel was beginning to enjoy his new body a definite improvement from his former in his opinion but the changes didn’t stop their his skin a once pale layer started to gain a nice tan color and continued to darken. A surprise to be sure but not a much as what came next as Joel marveled at his skin he barely noticed his short dull brown hair growing at alarming speeds as it grew pass his ears it took a onyx black color still not stopping his raven locks grew to form large wavy curls not noticing until it grew pass his neck whereupon he fell in love with his new hair that soon stopped growing in the middle of his upper back. At this point his skin was now a caramel color when the next major change took place Joel’s chest started feeling a tight squeeze which took the air from his lungs until he heard a very audible crack, catching his breathe he saw that his rib cage and shoulders have drastically decreased but luckily had decrease any of his height or muscle mass he also found that his waist had compacted itself even more so forming extremely visible curves in his abdomen and his hands had become long and slender appendages, his most surprising feature was that his spine had a new curve where his chest stuck further forward than it had before. At this point Joel had some ideas as to where his transformation is leading as soon as the thought came to him a new wave of changes took place in his lower extremities first his feet like his hands become more slender and smaller, his legs grew in lengths giving him another two inches of heights and while still densely muscled his thighs grew in thickness, his hips took a more drastic change as they seemed to pop out of their sockets only to resettle into a new reformed pelvis granting him a wider stance and gait causing his ass to expand exponentially which inverted made the curves in his waist look even deeper. As Joel examine his legs his investigation led him to his groin where all of his suspicions of his transformation were about to be put to the test. Sadly due to his conflicting hormones Joel was never well endowed his penis when fully erect wasn’t even a full 4 inches and his testes even at age 16 had even completely dropped causing him to be sexually awkward and mostly impotent, yet now for the first time in his life he felt sexually aroused but it wasn’t from his penis it came deeper within his body at that point he realized that his balls were missing as they had already began their transformation into ovaries the skin sac they left behind now starting to get pulled into his body taking his still limp penis along as the bulge that was his groin was smoothing over the complexion of his skin had darken to the color of milk chocolate. As his only true masculine feature was shrinking into himself new hormones were being released throughout his body at a pace Joel couldn’t keep as adrenaline, endorphins and estrogen were racing through his system small changes were happening his body hair what little body hair he had receded into his skin leaving smooth soft epidermis, his organs shifted positions to fit his new frame and his brain chemistry was altered in that his previous personality was changed while some how maker him smarter. As these hormonal changes were happening Joel was feeling every emotion at once joy, sadness, anger, pleasure, fear, hatred, despair and love then just as the tip of penis slipped away into the slip leaving behind a perfectly shaved vagina with a fully functioning feminine reproduction system setting his system into equilibrium calming his mind. There was no doubt about it now he was turning into a woman an African one at that yet Joel didn’t seem to mind it was almost like this was closer to his true self than his previous body and it was approaching completion soon as he was feeling a tingling sensation in his chest. His nipples started growing in size growing to the width of silver dollars forming areola the length stretching a good few centimeters away from his chest, then fat tissue started forming in his pectorals the once flat surface started swelling into a pair of large voluptuous orbs the pleasure they induced unknown to Joel but not unwelcome. Once they have finished expanding Joel now sported a pair E-cup sized breasts soon to be kneaded by his new slender hands to help induce that sense of pleasure again. It was almost done his skin had at last ended it color change ending as a mysterious dark chocolate complexion, his hourglass figure had remarkable shape and his mind was already exploring new aspects of his self he had never yet explored all that remained was his face which he couldn’t wait to be rid of, the last reminder of his old life and he wouldn’t wait long. His neck shrunk in diameter causing his Adam’s apple to disappear into his throat allowing a high pitch moan to escape his mouth many octaves higher than his previous voice, his face reshaping into a rounder shape, his brow, chin and nose soften into more feminine form and finally his once dull gray eyes turn into a rich beautiful brown, with the transformation settling down a majestic woman’s face had taken over Joel’s head. At last Joel’s transformation was finished where once a short skinny unhealthy Caucasian teenager boy once stood a stunningly gorgeous African goddess with a figure like a supermodel mixed with a professional athlete, there wasn’t a single flaw to his form he was no longer weak, sickly or unattractive. He maybe a woman of a different race but in Joel’s eyes he or rather she was perfect.<br />
<br />
As she stared at the mirror she said her first words with her new voice a high octave sultry sound “I look magnificent” she soon spook herself with her new voice “Now that going to take getting used to, but considering everything else it’s the least of all things that matter, hahaha” she finished with a laugh then her attention was turned to the camera that was still recording, remembering her experiment she quickly grabbed a robe prepared for her next to the mirror which she soon found to be a bit small for her but she didn’t mind as it just help show off her curves which she was loving. Once dressed she addressed the camera with another monologue “As it can be seen my serum has completely morphed my body, I feel better than I have in my entire life, I will need to run test before I can give a definitive answer but I believe my strength, dexterity, constitution, stamina, senses and overall health all together has improved exponentially which was the goal of this experiment. As for the more drastic changes I can only hypothesis the solution but considering the difficulty to find a true answer this is the best answer that can deferred to. First as to my change in race it somewhat unsurprising considering the DNA I promoted was prehistoric homo sapient since the first homo sapient developed in Africa it takes little conjecture to determine that I would develop feature like those ancient humans who share many traits with modern Africans. Second as to my gender this is probably due to their not being enough Y-chromosome DNA the genetic material that determine masculine features so the serum must have used purely X-chromosomes to finish the genetic strands which lead to turning me into a female, although not tested yet I surmise that my sperm may have turned into ovum meaning I will have fully functioning menstrual cycles and will be able to carry and birth a child. To be honest I am not looking forward to periods but the idea of bearing a kid makes me feel a little excited which may just mean the serum has changed my brain chemistry granting me new personality traits and perspectives. Lastly to more well endowed features for someone of only 16 years of age appearing more like in there 20s at least I believe that due to the dangerous environment of early homo sapient they had to develop sexually traits fast in order to reproduce at younger ages than our modern day this may also explain my new sense of libido I am currently feeling at the moment although comparing my previous sexual drive to my previous body may just be me feeling average libido for the first time. Other noted changes that the camera couldn’t have caught being my level of comfortability with my new body although I will probably have to get use to my new sense of balance and motor functions but I have never felt like my true self as I do know I am already finding myself to refer to my person in my mind with feminine terms rather I was always trans or my altered brain has made the transition more easy. Now that I am basically a new person I believe it may be time for a new name Joel is far too masculine for me now also Joel has completed his task of bringing me to the world probably best to let him rest. My name is Jade Maxine Connors and I love my body.” With that last statement Jade turned off the camera.<br />
<br />
With her experiment at an end Jade needed to run tests for her new body as to see what the limits are so she doesn’t damage it later on, she took some blood, hair and spit samples of herself to test her DNA, well she waited for those results she thought how to test her physical abilities. Luckily Joel had old exercise equipment to help measure that test and although she knew her muscles were dense she was surprised how much her much her abilities had increased. She finished a 10 mile run on the treadmill at the highest speed without breaking a sweat, found she could lift well over 100 pound weights in various positions without straining anything, was able to perform any yoga movement with ease and the most amazing part after over 5 hours of working out Jade felt like she could continue to keep going her heartbeat having never exceeding 60 bpm which would make her stamina beyond that of most pro athletes. After her workout her Genetics test results were ready where she found that her body had some more amazing capabilities all her underlining health issues gone, her immune system was going into hyperdrive making most outside diseases redundant and her genes were so stable that she would never have to worry about genetic disorders like cancer, muscular dystrophy or even sickle cell so common among her African ethnicity. Based off the data she had collected her previous prognosis of not surviving her 20s has vastly improved she be surprised if she didn’t reach 80 in perfect health. Once her physical traits were checked out Jade decided to see if any of her mental faculties had deteriorated in exchange for her new body so went online to perform multiple knowledge, creativity and logic quizzes to see how she would perform. What once took Joel hours to a full day to complete Jade managed to finish in little over an hour her mind’s ability to process information had exponentially increased, her memory recall had became more clearer than ever and her problem solving skills were somehow better than before. Jade couldn’t be happier not only had she gained a rocking bod but her intellect had improved to that of the top 0.01 percentile of minds. As Jade reveled in the superiority of herself a feeling she been trying to ignore had resurfaced inside her a feeling she had never felt before she was feeling horny. As Joel every sexual situation has been met with frustration and awkwardness due to his conflicting hormones now Jade was unsure what to do now these tests have been a good distraction but now there was nothing between her and her body. But she would be damned if let something so small that scared Joel to death be a flaw in her, she could handle a little horniness. She soon left her desk heading to the bed she kept in lab, stripping the robe as she strides marveling at her body again as she approach the bed. As she laid on the simple cotton sheets Jade hesitantly moved her hand across her abdomen increasing the tension until it reach the virgin slit between her leg. Slowly her finger slipped into her vagina and the nerves in her slowly alit aflame causing her to increase the intensity of her masturbation, one finger turned to two then to three, what was a slow exploration became a rapid race to induce more nerves into excitement. As her fury continued she finally found the most treasured touch, the G-spot, once her finger touched that most wondrous zone her mind blanked into pure nothingness as bliss overtook her entire body having now experienced her first female orgasm. Jade would continue to induce more orgasms wanting to feel that most magnificent sensation only once exhausting herself from the effort of breaking her mind with pleasure did she stop. After her marathon trek of masturbation Jade decided it was best to get some sleep and decide what her new life should be once she awakens. As her consciousness faded to slumber her mind could only think of how much better things were now, compared to Joel, Jade is stronger, healthier, smarter and now virile, everything couldn’t have gone better, so what if she was a black woman she is perfect and nothing would change her mind and finally sleep took her.</p>
