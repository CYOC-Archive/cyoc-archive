<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Loki, ever mischievous, tapped his fingers together. He seemed to take great pleasure in watching the boys&#39; reactions — their palpable anxiety mixed with growing excitement. Slowly turning on his heels, a sly grin spread across his face.<br />
<br />
— &quot;The next challenge, my dears, will be… a classic.&quot; He let the suspense hang for a moment before announcing, with clear satisfaction, &quot;Dodgeball.&quot;<br />
<br />
The boys froze for a moment, some exchanging uncertain glances. Matthias, more familiar with this kind of game than some of the others, frowned slightly. He knew Loki liked to add his own twist to everything. What seemed simple was bound to become more… complex.<br />
<br />
Loki raised a hand, and a ball appeared in the air, floating like a ghost before stabilizing in his hands.<br />
<br />
— &quot;Simple rules. Two teams of five. You throw the ball to hit an opposing team member. If you&#39;re hit, you&#39;re a ‘prisoner’ and must stay still—unless a teammate touches you to free you. If all members are hit, the team loses. No cheap shots, no cheating… or you’ll quickly learn I have very creative punishments.&quot;<br />
<br />
Loki&#39;s tone was playful, but there was an unmistakable seriousness beneath it. The boys nodded, ready to begin. Teams were quickly formed, with Loki acting as a spectator. Matthias ended up on the red team, alongside four boys he barely knew. The blue team looked well-coordinated. It was going to be a fierce match.<br />
<br />
Loki gave the signal.<br />
<br />
— &quot;Let the game begin!&quot;<br />
<br />
Both teams immediately sprang into action. The boys, now athletic and enhanced, moved faster and with more force, still dressed in their tuxedos like participants in some wild teambuilding day. The ball flew through the air as players dashed, dodged, and moved with near-supernatural speed. The early throws were wild, as everyone tested their power, but tension soon rose.<br />
<br />
Matthias hung back, observing, waiting for the right moment. Thanks to his earlier transformation, his body was already faster and more agile, and he could dodge the ball effortlessly. His teammates, however, quickly came under pressure. A boy from the blue team hurled the ball forcefully, aiming at a red team player.<br />
<br />
The ball grazed Matthias’s shoulder. He dove to the right, rolled nimbly, and sprang to his feet. He glanced at his teammates.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the red team was on the brink of defeat. Two players were already prisoners, and only three remained. The ball soared again, hitting one more red player. Only Matthias was left, facing the entire blue team. He clenched his fists.<br />
<br />
He rushed forward with astounding speed, dodging a throw and launching the ball with unmatched precision. It hit the fastest blue player, taking him out. Another rushed to catch the ball, but Matthias feinted, moving like an agile dancer, countering with fluid elegance. In the end, the red team turned the tide and claimed victory.<br />
<br />
Loki, who had been watching with an amused smile, stood and clapped loudly.<br />
<br />
— &quot;Bravo, my young friends, you have earned your win!&quot; He turned to the blue team. &quot;And you, alas, have lost.&quot;<br />
<br />
A heavy silence settled. Matthias turned toward the losing team as Loki raised his hands to announce the penalty.<br />
<br />
— &quot;Your penalty, gentlemen, will be… an interesting transformation.&quot; He approached one particularly nervous player. &quot;You’ll keep your sculpted bodies… but your muscles will change.&quot; A toothy grin spread across his lips. &quot;They’ll become balloons. Balloons that look like muscles, but filled with air.&quot;<br />
<br />
The boys looked at each other nervously, unsure what to expect. Loki stepped back, and with a snap of his fingers, the transformation began.<br />
<br />
The losers&#39; muscles began to shift beneath their tuxedos. Biceps, quads, chests, and backs slowly distorted, filling with an elastic, air-like substance — flesh-colored, but slightly paler. It wasn’t painful, just deeply strange — a hollow feeling in their muscles, even though their appearance remained intact. The balloons swelled under their skin, puffing up as if every muscle fiber had been replaced by air. The boys felt suddenly heavier, their bodies losing density. It was a mix of tingling, odd weight, and a sense of floating limbs. They still had the strength from their previous transformation, but their muscles now squeaked softly as they moved, rubbing against their shirts. The balloon-flesh bulged slightly with each motion, bending with a cartoonish resilience.<br />
<br />
Then Loki turned to the winning team, his smile beaming.<br />
<br />
— &quot;As for you… you avoided those balls with brilliance. Your reward shall match your agility.&quot;<br />
<br />
A soft light enveloped the boys, followed by a pleasant warmth in their muscles. Their already powerful bodies began to change. A wave of release passed through their limbs, followed by a new, almost unnatural flexibility. Their muscles loosened and reshaped, becoming more elastic, more responsive.<br />
<br />
Their legs reacted first, the quadriceps lengthening and tightening at once, allowing for smoother movement. Each gesture became faster, more precise, without losing strength. Their arms followed, softening and gaining unprecedented freedom. The transformation spread to their torsos, refining every muscle into something supple yet solid.<br />
<br />
Matthias felt his legs propel him faster, almost as if he was gliding. His arms followed his intent with uncanny precision. He felt both lighter and stronger, capable of reacting in an instant. His dense muscles were now coiled like springs, and he felt his wings gaining strength — ready to launch him skyward.<br />
<br />
He leapt into the air, feeling his new agility and the speed in his limbs. He seemed to slide across the ground, a constant sense of latent power pulsing through him. Never had he been so fast. Each movement flowed with surprising ease. His entire body had become a sleek, formidable machine.<br />
<br />
Loki watched it all with a pleased smile.<br />
<br />
— &quot;There. You are stronger, faster, more flexible. It will come in handy for the next games — which you may now join, if you wish, since you’ve won this one. Prepare yourselves for what comes next.&quot;</p>
