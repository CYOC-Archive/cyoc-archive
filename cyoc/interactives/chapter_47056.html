<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Joel had driven himself and his minions to Venice Beach, California where he had set out looking for other young men to possess with the intent to make huge muscle men out of them, eventually.<br />
<br />
As soon as he had arrived there, he started to scan the coast for anyone who seemed suitable. He spotted a few couples, a bunch of kids, a few teenagers, and a few middle-aged men as well. He pondered the possibilities for a moment, and decided on his next victim. After a few moments, he decided on the younger generation, since they would be more teachable and more eager to learn. Not only that, but they would love to become more muscular as well.<br />
<br />
Joel, who still had the body of Vin Diesel, spotted a young surfer who was riding the tall waves. The boy had short, black hair, and he was skinny and short. As he approached the shore, he tried to maintain his balance on the board, until he tumbled into the water. Then, after a few moments, he came swimming towards the beach, and walked out, with his board in his hand. <br />
<br />
The boy walked over to the wooden lounge area where the soda machines were, and he surveyed the various types of drinks. As he stood there, Joel used his amazing powers and projected his essence onto the wooden floor, directly behind the spot where the boy was standing. A small puddle of water formed on the floor. As soon as the boy had purchased his can of diet soda, he turned around and stepped with both feet into the puddle. Immediately, the water became absorbed into the soles of his feet, and the floor became completely dry. Naturally, it happened so fast, that the teenager barely noticed it.<br />
<br />
However, something strange did happen at that point. The essence had entered the boy’s body through his feet and it began to travel through the rest of him through his legs, his waist, his torso, his shoulders, his arms, his neck, and finally through his head and in his soul. During those first few minutes, the boy was overcome by a constant tingling sensation through his entire body. It felt good, but very weird. It seemed almost like there was some kind of invisible, living being that was roaming around inside of his body. Then, out of nowhere, he began to hear a voice speaking to him, from within.<br />
<br />
“Brandon! Brandon!” the boy heard a male voice calling out his name.<br />
<br />
At first, he turned around, wondering if there was someone around, who was calling his name.<br />
<br />
“Huh? What? Who…?” Brandon wondered, as he turned around, looking for the source of the strange voice that was calling out his name.<br />
<br />
“Who are you looking for, my boy?” the voice spoke. “You won’t see me out there! I’m inside of you!”<br />
<br />
Brandon walked a little further away from the building as he headed back towards the shore, where his surfboard lay in the sand. <br />
<br />
“What? Who… Who are you?” he wondered.<br />
<br />
“I’m a friend… My name is Joel. I’m inside of you. In fact, you’re a part of me, now…” the voice explained.<br />
<br />
Brandon looked down at his body and then he looked at his hands and his arms. Was somebody playing a joke on him? There was no radio or anything planted on him. Where could the voice be coming from?<br />
<br />
“Why? What do you want from me?”<br />
<br />
“I’ve been looking for a kid like you, Brandon…” the voice replied. “I wanted some young blood…”<br />
<br />
“Young blood? For what?”<br />
<br />
“To stir things up, my young friend…. I can make your dreams come true… I sense that you love to become big and strong, right?” Joel continued.<br />
<br />
Brandon’s jaw dropped wide open. He had always dreamed about becoming muscular, but he had never told anyone about that, not even his best friend or his parents! So, how could a total, complete stranger know his deepest secret?<br />
<br />
“What? How… How did you know that?” he wondered out loud.<br />
<br />
“Like I said earlier; you’re now a part of me, my boy…. I’m in complete control of your body… I can change you any way I want to…”<br />
<br />
“What? That’s hard to believe…” Brandon thought to himself.<br />
<br />
“Unbelieving Thomas…” the voice spoke, while ringing in his ears. “How about a demonstration?”<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Brandon disappeared from the area close to the shore, where he was standing, and re-appeared at the lounge, standing right before the row of vending machines! He was instantly teleported from the beach to the lounge area located inside of the wooden building, almost fifty feet away!<br />
<br />
“Hey! How did I get here?” Brandon gasped.<br />
<br />
“I teleported you over here, boy!” the voice explained. “Now, look at the soda machine and see if you notice anything different!”<br />
<br />
Brandon looked straight ahead, and stared at the row of black, plastic bottles of soda, which was neatly lined up before him. Suddenly, he was overcome by an intense, tingling feeling in his legs. Suddenly, he felt something change. As he continued to stare at the soda machine before him, he noticed that the machine appeared to shrink a little. No longer was he staring at the third row from the top, but at the second row. Very slowly, it seemed like his upper body was being raised up and lifted further from the ground. When he looked down, he realized that his legs had actually grown longer!<br />
<br />
“Holy crap! I’m having a growth spurt!”<br />
<br />
“Yes, I just made you grow six inches taller…” Joel said to him.<br />
<br />
“What… What the heck?” Brandon said, as he looked down. He ran his hand over his legs before he looked up again. Everything around him suddenly seemed smaller. In fact, the boy was now almost 6 feet tall!<br />
<br />
“There! Now that you’re about tall enough, Brandon, how about we add some muscle to your body, hmm?”<br />
<br />
“M-m-muscle?” Brandon stuttered, as he looked down at his tall, lanky body.<br />
<br />
“Yes, my friend… All my minions are muscular… I don’t care for weaklings…”<br />
<br />
“Me? Muscular? Like… How muscular?” Brandon asked.<br />
<br />
“How do two-hundred-and-fifty-pounds sound to you, my friend?” Brandon suddenly heard in another voice.<br />
<br />
 “What? Who?” Brandon wondered.<br />
<br />
“My name is Trey… I’m a bodybuilder… I’m talking to you right now, thanks to Joel…”<br />
<br />
“Holy smoke! There are two people inside of me right now?” Brandon whispered to himself.<br />
<br />
“We’re gonna make you into an awesome muscle-dude, Brandon!” Trey continued.<br />
<br />
“Uhh… What do you look like?” Brandon asked out loud.<br />
<br />
Suddenly there was a bright flash of light, and then Brandon was left staring at a large, muscular black man, standing in the lounge, looking him in the eye. <br />
<br />
The large, black man was as muscular as a mountain and he had incredibly wide shoulders with pectorals the size of beach balls. His arms were as thick as pythons, and his abdominals were like cobblestone tiles. Brandon’s jaw dropped wide open when he saw the huge, muscular man standing barely five feet in front of him, looking down on him with a wide grin on his face.<br />
<br />
“I can’t wait to see you become just like me, Brandon…” Trey grinned. “It’s time for you to bulk up!”<br />
<br />
“Am I… gonna be… like you?” Brandon wondered out loud, as he reached out and gently wrapped his fingers around Trey’s bulging bicep as he flexed before the virile young teen. <br />
<br />
“Oh yes…. Come here, little bro…” Trey smiled, as he extended his mighty arms for an embrace.<br />
<br />
Brandon walked up to Trey and allowed him to wrap his big, thick, muscular arms around his thin body. While he hugged him, Trey easily lifted Brandon off his feet, while holding him tight against his rock-hard wall of abdominals and pectorals.<br />
<br />
Just as Trey was holding Brandon in an embrace, Joel allowed his powers to work on Brandon’s muscles. Slowly, very slowly, Brandon’s calves began to inflate as they filled out and became rock hard and thick. His quads thickened and widened at the same time, as they filled out and strengthened considerably. Thick ropes of veins started to surface over the boy’s now larger quads, covering his new slabs of muscle on his legs.<br />
<br />
Brandon’s torso widened by almost a foot as his shoulders widened and his chest expanded at the same time. His lats spread out like wings under his arms while his pectorals ballooned as if air was being pumped into them. Pound upon pound of muscle magically added to Brandon’s frame, making him heavier, stronger and bigger all at once. His pecs and abs inflated at the same time, slowly making him resemble a young, junior bodybuilder all within just a few minutes.<br />
<br />
Finally, Brandon’s arms began to thicken considerably. In fact, they became twice as thick as before! His biceps blew up like balloons, filling up with amazing rocket-powered muscle, while simultaneously his triceps expanded on the opposite side of his arm. His hands and lower arms thickened and widened, giving him amazing strength that was just superhuman! He almost began to look like a hero from a comic book!<br />
<br />
When Trey finally let go of Brandon, they boy had changed dramatically. Gone was the skinny, lanky teenager, now, Trey saw a young muscle-bound powerhouse standing before him. In fact, Trey was so proud of his new, younger muscle-brother that he pulled the muscle boy towards him, very gently.<br />
<br />
“Come here, dude… Come here so I can welcome you to the family….”<br />
<br />
Trey pulled Brandon towards him and then he bent over slightly, tilting his head sideways as he brought his lips down and close enough to the teen’s lips. Then, he gently planted a kiss on Brandon’s lips, as a show of his love for the younger muscle boy. After a few passionate seconds had passed, Trey slowly took a step back, and straightened out so he could get a good look and examine the muscle-bound teen for the first time.<br />
<br />
Brandon just smiled as he made a fist and flexed his right arm, allowing for a huge ball of muscle to rise up from the top of his forearm. It was a site to behold. For the first time in his life, Brandon was able to produce a huge muscle, and it was his own, on his very own body. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Joel was watching the boy and he couldn’t help but smile.</p>
