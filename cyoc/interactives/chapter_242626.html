<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When Jeff arrives home, after spending the last day with Hiro as “Natsumi”, he heads straight to his room and locks the door, not wanting anyone to suddenly barge and witness him transforming back into his normal self.<br />
<br />
The “girl” sits down on the edge of her bed, letting out a sigh, “what a day,” she says to herself, “I really enjoyed spending the day with Hiro, he is such an amazing and cool dude. The only weird part of the day was when I felt that weird fluttering in my stomach and my body suddenly feeling warmer than before. And when I looked into his eyes, I felt as if I was floating, and I felt the urge to want to… kiss him”.<br />
<br />
“Natsumi” shakes her head, “come on, Jeff,” she mumbles, “don’t worry about it, you are not falling in love with Hiro, after all: you aren’t gay! The weird feeling in your stomach was just your body digesting the food”. The girl nods, satisfied with the explanation, “yeah, that must be it,” she mumbles, “all I need is a good night sleep, and I’ll feel like my normal self again when I awake”.<br />
<br />
The following three days, Jeff manages to not think about Hiro and focus more on his studies, however, as he sits in class, his phone vibrates in his pocket, the teen pulls his phone out of his pocket, out of habit, assuming that he just received a message from his mother. However, when he sees Hiro’s name on the screen, he feels his heart skip a beat as he opens the message:<br />
<br />
“Hey Natsumi, I really enjoyed our Sunday together,” the message says, “I am excited and can’t wait to see you again this coming Saturday”.<br />
<br />
Before Jeff even realizes what he is doing, the teen types back, “hey Hiro, yeah, I can’t wait to see you again myself. I too have really enjoyed spending the day with you”.<br />
<br />
Jeff’s phone vibrates when Hiro replies, “let’s meet at my place at 6pm”.<br />
<br />
“Sounds good to me,” Jeff replies, “please send me your address”.<br />
<br />
“King’s Boulevard 20,” Hiro writes back, “I’ll let the security guard at the gate know you’re coming so that he’ll let you in”.<br />
<br />
“Alright, I’ll be there,” Jeff writes back.<br />
<br />
“Looking forward to seeing you,” Hiro writes back.<br />
<br />
“Same, I’ll see you Saturday 6pm at your place,” Jeff replies, he then closes the chat and puts his phone back in his pocket. The teen feels his heart beating in his chest, ‘why am I feeling so anxious and excited,’ he thinks to himself, ‘it’s not like I am going on a date with him!’<br />
<br />
As the days pass and Saturday approaches, Jeff’s anxiety and excitement grows, the teen tries his best to try and figure out why he is feeling the way he is, the teen feels as though he is nervous, anxious and excited all at the same time and he can’t seem to stop thinking about Hiro. Jeff doesn’t understand what is going on, he never felt the way he is feeling before, ‘calm down, Jeff,’ he thinks to himself as he is sitting in his room on the day before meeting Hiro again, ‘no need to be afraid, Hiro is just a friend, nothing more! You are NOT falling in love with him, you CAN’T fall in love with him, you are a straight boy!’<br />
<br />
The next day, Jeff prepares himself, first he uses the program to transform one of his t-shirts into a beautiful satin sky-blue dress with a stitched on flower design, ‘I must look appropriate,’ is all Jeff can think of, ‘after all… I am meeting him at his home and I can’t show up in some cheap attire!’<br />
<br />
At 4:30pm Jeff grabs his phone and backpack, in which he had packed the dress, he had also transformed an old pair of sneakers into sky-blue high heels, and heads out the house and towards the bus stop to catch the bus.<br />
<br />
It is 5:45pm when Jeff exits the bus at a bus stop about 15 minutes walk from Hiro’s house, the teen’s eyes widen at the huge houses, the boy feeling completely out of place.<br />
<br />
Jeff looks around and spots a large tree, luckily not many people are walking around, the teen walks behind the tree and opens the app, Jeff opens the “saved transformations” tab and selects “Natsumi”.<br />
<br />
Once Jeff is once again “Natsumi”, the girl quickly strips out of her oversized clothes, and quickly gets changed into the clothes she had brought with her: the sky-blue dress, white lace panties and matching bra and the blue high heels. The backpack had transformed into a sky-blue handbag, and once dressed “Natsumi” and after stuffing her boy clothes into her handbag, the “girl” steps out from behind the tree, and heads up the street towards Hiro’s house.<br />
<br />
The ”girl’s” eyes widen when she walks up to the massive front gates, “holy crap,” she says.<br />
<br />
“Miss Tahara, I presume,” a gruff voice says, causing the “girl” to turn her head, noticing a guy in a black suit standing by the gate.<br />
<br />
“Natsumi” nods, “y-yes, sir,” she says.<br />
<br />
The guard looks the “girl” up and down, no emotion on his face as he raises a radio, “young sir,” the man says, “your visitor is her”.<br />
<br />
‘Man, why do this security guys always have to look so… mean,’ the “girl” thinks to herself.<br />
<br />
“Very well,” the man then says, lowering the radio, “walk up the path to the main entrance, my colleague will take you to the young master,” the man then takes out a remote and opens the gates.<br />
<br />
“Thanks, sir,” the “girl” says, the man simply nods, when “Natsumi” walks through the gates they close behind her.<br />
<br />
When “Natsumi” arrives by the front door of the massive mansion in a Japanese design, she notices a second man standing by the front door, “miss Tahara, please follow me,” he says, the “girl” follows the man into the house, her eyes widen.<br />
<br />
“This place is huge,” the “girl” gasps as she steps into the large entrance hall, large portraits hang from the walls, doors lead into separate rooms and a large staircase leads up to the other floors.<br />
<br />
“The young sir is waiting for you in the garden,” the guard says, his voice, though emotionless, sounds less unfriendly than the first guard.<br />
<br />
“Natsumi” follows the guard into the huge garden, her eyes widen at the sight of it, the garden is styled just like a Japanese garden, there is also a large swimming pool and a large pond, next to the pond “Natsumi” sees a large pavilion.<br />
<br />
The guard leads the “girl” towards the pavilion and motions for her to stop, the guard then slides the door open and “Natsumi” sees Hiro standing with his back turned towards them, staring out towards the water. The man clears his throat, “young sir, I bring your visitor,” he says.<br />
<br />
Hiro turns around, a large smile on his face, “Natsumi! So nice to see you, please come in,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Natsumi” steps into the pavilion and the door slides shut behind her, turning around she notices the guard had turned around and is now standing directly in front of the door, his back turned to it. The “girl” then hears Hiro approach her, when she turns she notices the concerned expression on the boy’s face.<br />
<br />
“Natsumi… are you alright,” Hiro asks, his voice sounding concerned.<br />
<br />
“Natsumi” forces a smile, “y-yeah… I’m fine,” she says, “it… it’s just that this place is so overwhelming and I am just a little nervous and intimidated by your security detail”.<br />
<br />
Hiro nods, “I understand, for people, who aren’t used to it, it can be overwhelming and scary,” he says, he then smiles, “but try not to think about it. By the way… you look amazing!”<br />
<br />
“Natsumi” feels herself blush a little, “th-thanks, Hiro,” she says, “you don’t look to bad yourself”.<br />
<br />
Hiro is wearing a black suit, white shirt, blue tie and black shoes, the boy chuckles, “come, let me show you around,” he says, walking to the door, “try to ignore the security guard, he’s just doing his job”.<br />
<br />
“Natsumi” nods, “I know, Hiro,” she says, “I’ll be fine”.<br />
<br />
Hiro smiles before sliding the door open, “Vincent, I’ll be showing Natsumi around,” he says, looking up at the man who had turned around when Hiro slid the door open, “please stay in the background, Natsumi feels a little uncomfortable, she isn’t used to having security following her around”.<br />
<br />
The guard, Vincent, looks at the girl, “of course,” he says, then adds, “sorry, miss Tahara, me and my colleagues don’t mean to intimidate you”.<br />
<br />
“Natsumi” nods, “it’s alright, sir,” she says, “I’m always nervous when police, military and security are close by”.<br />
<br />
Vincent smiles, “at least you are a girl who shows people like me respect,” he says, “and respect goes a long way. Now, try and enjoy your stay,” the man steps aside.<br />
<br />
Hiro smiles at “Natsumi”, “come, Natsumi,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Natsumi” follows Hiro, the boy begins to show the “girl” the garden, he then leads her into the house, showing her the entertainment room, large kitchen, the library and lounge, the large dining room and large living room. The “girl” starts to relax more and more and soon she is smiling and even asking Hiro questions about the portraits and weapons around the house, and Hiro is more than happy to explain.<br />
<br />
After showing “Natsumi” around, Hiro says, “I was thinking we could watch a movie in the private theater”.<br />
<br />
“Natsumi” smiles, “sounds good,” she says, “what kind of movie have you in mind?”<br />
<br />
Hiro smiles, “it’s a movie that hasn’t been officially released yet,” he says, “the movie is called, “The Samurai”. I think you’ll enjoy it, since you enjoy action and martial arts movies as much as I do”.<br />
<br />
“Natsumi” smiles, “that sounds like a great and exciting movie,” she says, “I’m all for it”.<br />
<br />
Hiro chuckles, “then follow me to the entertainment room,” he says.</p>
