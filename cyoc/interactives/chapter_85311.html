<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A few days earlier, when Maurice first returned from restoring Fee City, he had arrived with Jack and Caitlyn and their family. The Fee City Kats had apparently wanted to apologize for their actions in Fee City during the outbreak, or at least for the way they did what they did. Maurice figured it was polite of them, but given that Charlie and Sally had both been pregnant twice before and were both pregnant for the third time now, he figured that any resentment that Charlie had had toward hir neighbors over becoming a Kat was gone. However, Maurice was more than willing to give them a chance to apologize. They also seemed to be very curious about Janace as the plane came in for a landing.<br />
<br />
&quot;You guys built up a rather large town in just twelve years,&quot; Jack commented off hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;They got a pyramid!&quot; one of Jack and Caitlyn&#39;s soughters commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, the pyramid is attached to the school, though it&#39;s also the home for two our top school teachers,&quot; Maurice commented, &quot;one teaches at the high school level and the other teaches at the elementary school level.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Interesting... I don&#39;t suppose we could get a tour and see the city?&quot; Caitlyn asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Maurice offered, &quot;though after we land, we will need to take you six to our local tailor.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tailor?&quot; one of the older soughters wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;While our primary population are Kats of varying types, we do have a fair number of humans in Janace, and a couple of Kats were involved in the fashion industry when they became Kats and actually swiftly turned to adapting and designing cloths for Kats to wear,&quot; Maurice explained, &quot;and as such, Janace doesn&#39;t have Fee City&#39;s laws that allow for public nudity...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And those will probably go away in Fee City now that nearly everyone went back to being human,&quot; Caitlyn spoke, sounding somewhat depressed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway, we&#39;ll take you down to the tailor and you can get some clothes to wear while you&#39;re in Janace,&quot; Maurice finished.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The group soon found itself off of the offices that Danna and Mikkie ran. When the two had started, it had been a rather simple office/warehouse type space that wasn&#39;t any bigger than a decent sized living room in some houses, but as Danna perfected the way to weave various plant fibers so that the weave wouldn&#39;t seriously irritate Kat&#39;s fur and as the clothing line grew popular, particularly with Kats, Danna and Mikkie&#39;s facility soon expanded. It wasn&#39;t as big as the UN offices in Janace or the New Chakat Industries, but it was big enough to house a select number of specialized weaving machines that performed the same basic techniques, which Danna and Mikkie had worked out by hand, mechanically. Danna and Mikkie had gotten the help from a few human mechanical engineers who built the machines and maintained them. It allowed for the output of &quot;Kat Klothing&quot; to skyrocket. <br />
<br />
This allowed for formalized offices where Danna worked on designing new designs, commonly with Mikkie&#39;s help in some way, a small show room where Kat Klothing&#39;s owner and employees could practice any new ideas for how to show any and all new designs. Any human models for Danna and Mikkie&#39;s shows would also be brought there to practice through how Danna wanted the show to go. There was also a small store that would allow Danna and Mikkie to sell clothing directly.<br />
<br />
The walk there had generated some notice as Janace&#39;s Kats were somewhat surprised at seeing Jack and Caitlyn&#39;s nudity, and were even more surprised by how little they did to hide it. As they entered, they found Angel and Demon at work in the store. They looked up to see the group entering and while they paid little attention to Maurice, they quickly swarmed to Jack and Caitlyn and their soughters.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my dears!&quot; Demon gasped shi came up to Jack, &quot;What happened to you? Who wronged you so that left you naked?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We...&quot; Jack began.<br />
<br />
&quot;It doesn&#39;t matter, my love,&quot; Angel said to hir mate, &quot;we will help them get what they need to be pretty again... with the best clothes they can afford.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maurice then stepped aside and let Angel and Demon get to work, seeing what clothing Jack and Caitlyn liked and what was in their price range. Jack and Caitlyn, more used to Fee City&#39;s pro-nudity laws seemed to put up with it as they didn&#39;t have much choice in Janace, and their soughters were borderline resistant, though mostly as they were rather curious about certain parts of the town that they had seen on the flight in. This eventually brought Danna out to see what was going on. Shi ultimately came up to Maurice, who had moved to stand by the counter.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is all this?&quot; Danna at first said, though not necessarily to anyone in particular.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just a couple of Kats from Fee City I picked up,&quot; Maurice answered, &quot;I don&#39;t think they intend to stay for long, but I figured it&#39;d be best to get them attired before they did anything else.&quot;<br />
<br />
Danna blinked. The voice was deeper, but its tones and infection and the way the words were said were recognizable to hir. &quot;Maurice... how... wha... you&#39;re supposed to be Chakat!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The people in Fee City wanted a demonstration of what the Retrovirus Vaccine can do,&quot; Maurice answered, &quot;and they weren&#39;t about to let me turn them into guinea pigs... perfectly understandable given what I did to them. But they did forgive me for being able to turn them back, so that does make me feel a bit better...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But... your beautiful long fur...&quot; Danna protested, &quot;It was silky smooth.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I might be able to get it back,&quot; Maurice answered, &quot;The Retrovirus Vaccine is so new that neither Snowy nor I know how permanent it is. Once this group is clothed, and probably as a surplus as since Fee City is a largely human city again, they won&#39;t tolerate public nudity the way they did as Kats, I&#39;ll be working to restore myself to the way I&#39;m supposed to be.&quot;<br />
<br />
Danna caught a little of the fear in Maurice&#39;s voice that Snowy wouldn&#39;t love him as a human or as a him. Shi reached over and gently rubbed Maurice&#39;s shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Snowy will always love you, Maurice,&quot; Danna commented, &quot;You should know that... We&#39;ve all learned it... I&#39;ve felt it ever since I became a Kat and became Mikkie&#39;s mate. I carry my love for hir and our children out on my sleeve.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maurice nodded, but said nothing.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The next few days went quickly, but Jack and Caitlyn found getting to talk with Charlie and Sally rather tough. Much of it related to the surprises by the admittance from Snowflake and Janice that they had broken their parents rules. While Maurice did become a Kat again, a Hybrikat based on the Canada Lynx and a species of flying dinosaur. Snowflake had identified the species as &quot;Pterodactyl,&quot; though Elise commented that was unlikely. Shi&#39;d commented that Pterodactylus was and its closest relatives had short tails and that the exact species was likely from one the Rhamphorhynchs, a different suborder of flying reptiles which were known for lengthy spade tipped tails. Elise, however, also stated that some of these differences weren&#39;t known to those outside the paleontology field and that these sorts of things were easily confused, and that since both Rhamphorhynchs and Pterodactyls were fairly closely related suborders, it wasn&#39;t much of a mistake. The mistake also really didn&#39;t matter to Maurice, shi was glad to be a Kat again.<br />
<br />
The issues related to Janice and Snowflake, however, delayed Jack and Caitlyn&#39;s ability to talk with their former neighbor in Fee City. The police and state offices visited Charlie and Sally as well as Snowy and Maurice to investigate the issue, as Ronnie and Mina couldn&#39;t cover up the treatment and by law had to report the issue.The main issue was to make sure that Charlie, Sally, Maurice, and Snowy didn&#39;t force or encourage their children to mate with each other. By law, a person in the US could not give consent to have sex until after they were eighteen, as part of the ways to protect minors from potential child abuse at the hands of perverted adults. They found no proof of any coercion, though both Charlie and Sally and Maurice and Snowy received summary fines for &quot;negligent parenting&quot; for being unable to keep two twelve year olds from having sex. And the State of Colorado would be running a lengthy observation and investigation of Charlie and Sally&#39;s orphanage to make sure that their negligence didn&#39;t negatively affect the children they&#39;d taken in. So far none of that had found in that the children were being looked after and hadn&#39;t displayed any such signs but they would keep up the investigation to make sure.<br />
<br />
Jack and Caitlyn didn&#39;t get into that, and while those events went on, they and their soughters toured Janace and looked at just about everything, from what looked like a future museum type building being built, the New Chakat Industries building, the school and the pyramid attached to it. They found a lot of it to be interesting and beautiful, but after a few days and things seemed to calm down, Jack and Caitlyn moved to do what they had originally set out to do. As they arrived at Charlie and Sally&#39;s home, they hoped the two had gotten over the actions they had taken in the Fee City outbreak.<br />
<br />
A black panther based Chakat opened the door after Jack ran the doorbell. Jack and Caitlyn were quick to see that the Kat was three months pregnant. A young Coykat accompanied the adult Chakat, who blinked and did recognize them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jack...&quot; Sally said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... it&#39;s me... and Caitlyn,&quot; Jack said slowly, &quot;it&#39;s been awhile, hasn&#39;t it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Sally said slowly, &quot;what are you doing here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We came to talk and... well... to apologize,&quot; Caitlyn admitted, &quot;we&#39;re all for people becoming Kats... STILL are...but the way we transformed Charlie was wrong... and while we did keep a good deal of our minds... we let our lust grow high high enough that we were willing to turn others...and once we burned through the Lust Phase of the virus...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You realized that sending people certain toys in the hopes that they would either play with it or would be exposed to the Virus at least was wrong?&quot; Sally questioned, sounding slightly suspicious, and keeping one hand on Diamond&#39;s.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Jack answered, &quot;We&#39;d wanted to apologize earlier, but you and Charlie always seemed to be out in Fee City before you all left to come here. I&#39;d hoped that now that it&#39;s been more than twelve years since that outbreak that we could talk.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;May we come in?&quot; Caitlyn finished.<br />
<br />
Sally paused for a moment and then turned and lead Charlie&#39;s former neighbors into hir home.<br />
<br />
&quot;How long do you intend to stay in Janace?&quot; Sally asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not very long,&quot; Jack answered, &quot;Caitlyn and I only have another two days off before we need to get back to work.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sally only nodded and lead them through the part of the building that was hirs and Charlie&#39;s home Shi eventually found Charlie settling onto the floor in living room and was reading to Mary, Fluffy, Reca and a couple of other young Kats that were part of the orphanage. Janice and Pinkie were presently cuddled together on the couch and were half-dozing. Shi silently sighed. Getting through the initial problems caused by hir soughter&#39;s mistakes had been rough, as Charlie and Sally worried about whether or not they were good parents and whether or not Janice would be okay, and had lead to a decision that until shi was eighteen and a legal adult, Janice would only be allowed to see Snowflake while a suitable chaperone could make sure they weren&#39;t engaging in anything that would be considered sexual, and there would be no more sleepovers at all. Janice protested, and Snowflake had protested to hir parents, but the answer they&#39;d gotten was rather simple, &quot;You&#39;re asking us to trust you to control yourself when you&#39;ve demonstrated that you cannot do so.&quot; <br />
<br />
Janice had conceived the point, fully realizing hir mistake. The mating had even not been entirely like what shi figured it was like, based on what shi overheard coming from the closed doors when hir mother and father mated, mostly the result of the immaturity of hir own body and in Snowflake&#39;s, and had only been done out of curiosity and the fact that shi already loved Snowflake. And shi did admit that shi hadn&#39;t been thinking and was faced with consequences that neither shi nor Snowflake considered. No one had stopped loving hir, but everyone seemed to be angry that shi and Snowflake had been so foolish. And with Pinkie, who might as well be hir twin, Janice had also seen just how hurt Pinkie had been. Saying shi still needed Pinkie wasn&#39;t going to fully change Pinkie&#39;s mind. Hearts didn&#39;t heal that easily, and Janice had found that shi needed to show that shi still loved Pinkie dearly and needed hir sither in hir life. Sally figured that the two of them would be spending the next few weeks bonding.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dear, we have some guests that would like to talk with you,&quot; Sally spoke, getting Charlie to look up.<br />
<br />
Charlie&#39;s eyes widened as shi looked up to see who their visitors were. It was Jack and Caitlyn, who shi hadn&#39;t seen since the Fee City Outbreak, more than twelve years ago. They were accompanied by four kids,  Seeing them was a great surprise. Shi remembered back to the outbreak, seeing the news and seeing lust filled Chakats changing a news reporter on camera and then getting the vibrator from hir neighbors and absorbing the Kat Virus through hir skin thanks to things that Caitlyn had done to it and then becoming a Kat hirself. Part of it made Charlie want to chuckle, as shi had gone to great lengths to avoid becoming a Kat back then, and now, shi would do whatever shi could to remain a Kat. Shi had grown to love it. Shi loved it when shi and Sally mated, shi loved being pregnant with Sally&#39;s children, and despite worrying over how good of a parent shi and Sally had been concerning Janice&#39;s pregnancy and hir disappointment in hir soughter, shi loved all of hir children dearly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that you, Charlie?&quot; Jack asked.<br />
<br />
Charlie didn&#39;t say anything immediately.<br />
<br />
&quot;Momma?&quot; Fluffy asked to Charlie, sensing some of Charlie&#39;s surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m okay, dear,&quot; Charlie rubbed Fluffy&#39;s head with one hand and focused hir gaze to Jack and Caitlyn, &quot;Yes, it&#39;s me. I suppose you two remember my Kat form being based off a Cheetah-Turkish Angora mix.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jack and Caitlyn nodded as Sally went to sit by the couch to be close to Janice and Pinkie who were not woken up from their nap.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... it&#39;s a bit of a long story, but I&#39;m now a manticore based Chakat,&quot; Charlie answered, &quot;complete with a stinger and sabers... and the four breasts.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jack and Caitlyn watched as the bulbous end of Charlie&#39;s tail twitched and they did notice the stinger on it, and the extra pair of breasts on Charlie&#39;s chest directly under the first pair and covered by one of Danna&#39;s specially made vests. They also noticed the three month swell of Charlie&#39;s womb. As with Sally, Charlie was clearly pregnant.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you&#39;re doing quite well, Charlie, and expecting I see,&quot; Caitlyn commented, &quot;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re doing well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So are we... some things aren&#39;t easy, but on the whole, I&#39;m happy... I&#39;m happy to have Sally with me as my mate... and I&#39;m happy to be a Kat,&quot; Charlie commented with a bit of a smile, &quot;If I were human... now... I think I would ask for a shot of the Serum.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you are a Kat, momma,&quot; Fluffy pointed out and snuggled up to Charlie&#39;s torso.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;m glad I am a Kat,&quot; Charlie smiled down at one of the twin Kats shi had given birth to. Shi then looked up to Jack and Caitlyn, &quot;I suppose you&#39;re here to apologize for sending me for transforming me... or at least for the way you did?&quot;<br />
<br />
Caitlyn nodded, &quot;We actually kept our minds after we became Kats... but it all felt so good and we could feel the lust phase&#39;s effects and that made us far to willing to transform others.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re glad you&#39;re happy to be a Kat... but the way you first became a Kat was wrong,&quot; Jack finished, &quot;We were too eager to feel the physical pleasure and decided to take away your choices as to whether or not you would be a Kat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; Charlie told them, &quot;I came to love being a Kat during my first pregnancy and after I give birth to Pinkie... I made the decision to never go back... I suppose in a way... I should actually thank you for the toy you two gave me.&quot; Charlie actually gave a bit of a giggle, &quot;In fact Sally and I still have it and we play with it when we can.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jack and Caitlyn knew precisely what it was, but also knew that with their own children there and the young children laying around Charlie that saying that the &quot;toy&quot; was a vibrator was not the thing to say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, thank you,&quot; Sally added.<br />
<br />
&quot;We still should have given you a choice, Charlie,&quot; Jack answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;True,&quot; Charlie admitted, &quot;but that was more than twelve years ago, even if I did still resent it... it&#39;d be stupid to hold onto it for so long.&quot;<br />
<br />
Caitlyn and Jack nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;So how have you two been, all things considered?&quot; Caitlyn wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Sally and I have our family... though I&#39;d suppose that dealing with the outbreaks has complicated things,&quot; Charlie answered, and motioned to Fluffy and Mary, &quot;these are the youngest I gave birth to, Fluffy and Mary. And the eldest I gave birth to is presently sleeping on the couch there. Hir name is Pinkie and shi is cuddled up to hir sister and the eldest that Sally gave birth two. Hir name is Janice.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jack and Caitlyn made no commentary on Janice&#39;s pregnancy as it wasn&#39;t their place. They watched as Sally then motioned to the little Coykat that was still with hir.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is Diamond, a Coykat we adopted after the Houston outbreak, and over there playing with Fluffy and Mary is Recca. Shi mixed Chakat and Jackat that I gave birth to after being raped in Cairo.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You poor dear...&quot; Caitlyn blurted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Recca can not help how shi was conceived,&quot; Sally answered, &quot;and the rapists were punished. Charlie and I love hir to bits and will love all of our children forever.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jack and Caitlyn watched as Charlie nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;We then decided to open an orphanage to help make sure that kids abandoned by parents because they were transformed and their parents weren&#39;t or were abused for some other reason and we&#39;ve put together a fairly good track record of finding loving homes for them,&quot; Charlie added, &quot;We&#39;ve even found humans that were willing to adopt Kats and have proved to be quite loving.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you&#39;ve all done quite well,&quot; Jack smiled, &quot;Caitlyn and I have also found ourselves living with a bit of family life...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jack then motioned for hir and Caitlyn&#39;s soughters to come forward. Jack first focused to a twelve year old and then a nine year old, &quot;These are Angelica, age twelve, and Mary-Jane, age nine, the two children I gave birth to.&quot;<br />
<br />
Caitlyn then motioned to the other two, &quot;and this is Sara-Lee, age twelve, and Flash, age nine, the two children I gave birth to.&quot;<br />
<br />
Charlie then carefully got up and approached Jack and Caitlyn.<br />
<br />
&quot;They all look wonderful,&quot; Charlie said politely, &quot;and it would appear that we all have come a long way... I grew to love being a Kat...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And we realized we should have done more to fight the urges of the lust phase of the virus,&quot; Jack nodded as shi and Caitlyn hugged Charlie, not as horny Kats looking for a threesome but as the relatively friendly neighbors they had all been before the Fee City Outbreak.</p>
