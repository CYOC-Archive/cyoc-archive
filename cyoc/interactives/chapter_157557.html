<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The three bullies stood in the hall of the locker room, gobsmacked at the naked Adonis that stood before them. As their brains slowly rebooted themselves, Nathan used his powers subconsciously to keep anyone else out of the locker room at that moment, casting a wide field of power that would confuse anyone not in the locker room at that moment and make them want to do something else.<br />
<br />
&quot;The fuck are you,&quot; Craig finally asked, pointing at Nathan. Chris and Cameron remained silent, letting Craig default into his leadership role of the gang.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why don&#39;t you guess,&quot; Nathan replied smoothly, acting as if the fact he was nude was beneath him. In truth it really was, he felt, he was beyond such societal constraints as modesty. &quot;After all, you beat me up every day. Surely you know who I am.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nathan?&quot; Cameron stammered, before the three bullies laughed in response. Nathan merely smirked and quickly decided on the best revenge for them.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re not that skinny little ass-muncher,&quot; Craig replied overconfidently, &quot;Though he&#39;d probably get a two inch hard-on looking at you cause he&#39;s such a fag.&quot; Nathan scowled and motioned with his hand, as Craig suddenly froze in place, his mind blocked from moving his muscles. &quot;What the fuck?&quot; he yelled out, as Chris and Cameron joined him in a frozen position. <br />
<br />
&quot;I am not gay,&quot; Nathan calmly replied, &quot;And neither will you three be. But I do think I know of a good use for you. You call me a pussy, a bitch, well let&#39;s see how the tables are turned.&quot; With a thought the three bullies began stripping off their clothes against their will, a mental command from Nathan as he used his powers to dominate their minds. When they were naked, they were once again frozen in place, arms held out to the side by some unseen force. Nathan walked between them, surveying their admittedly well-sculpted bodies, before deciding on the first course of action. &quot;First things first,&quot; he said with a smirk, &quot;I don&#39;t think we want all that nasty body hair on you, now do we.&quot;<br />
<br />
With a snap of his fingers, the three bullies felt pinpricks descend all the way down their bodies, as all the hair follicles outside of their head and eyebrows simply ceased to exist, leaving them devoid of any body hair, including pubes. They would have shivered from the cold had they been able to move. &quot;Please,&quot; Chris yelled out, breaking free enough to speak. &quot;Let us go. We didn&#39;t do anything to deserve this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nathan scowled again, his rugged jawline clinching with anger, &quot;Didn&#39;t you?&quot; He calmed himself down before continuing his work, &quot;Of course you didn&#39;t,&quot; he sarcastically retorted, &quot;That&#39;s why you beat me to a pulp with all those muscles of yours. Of course, you won&#39;t be needing those anymore for your new lives.&quot; With that remark, the muscles of the three bullies withered away, replaced by finely toned, smooth skin. As a side effect, each of them slowly shrank in height, with the tallest reduced to a mere 5&#39;4&#39;&#39;. Tears began to run down their faces as they felt that loss of their defining characteristic, at least so far. &quot;Now now none of that,&quot; Nathan jokingly replied, &quot;After all it&#39;s going to get a whole lot worse yet.&quot; With another wave the bullies felt their bodies slowly reshape themselves ever so subtly, their hips widening to give them the beginnings of an hour glass figure, their hands and feet shrinking in size and their nails growing slightly, their shoulders narrowing, and their faces slowly being morphed into things of feminine beauty. &quot;Of course, we do need a little difference. Variety is the spice of life after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris suddenly gasped as his skin tone began to darken drastically, and his face rearranged itself into African features. His curly brown hair darkened and suddenly turned into long flowing dreadlocks to the top of her back. Cameron too felt his features shift, as he adopted a slightly darker skin tone. His eyes became smaller and more slanted while his hair, also turning black, flowed down straight to the small of his back as he shrank even more than the other two. Meanwhile Craig&#39;s skin grew slightly paler, while his sandy brown hair became a platinum blonde and hung down in waves framing his face. Makeup appeared on all their feminine faces, accentuating their beauty and giving them a look that screamed slut. &quot;Prease sir...&quot; Cameron quipped in broken English, his voice heavily accented and feminine sounding, &quot;Don&#39;t do zis...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But don&#39;t you understand Kimi,&quot; Nathan said, and instantly Cameron only knew himself by that name, &quot;This is your new lot in life. You all took pleasure from beating me up. Now you are going to &quot;pay it forward&quot; as it were ten times over by pleasuring me. But you need a few more modifications first.&quot; All three bullies felt their lips bulge forward slightly, creating an o shape on their faces. Fat rearranged itself onto each of their asses, giving each of them a significant amount of &quot;junk in the trunk&quot; as it were, though Chris was clearly leading in that department. To their horrors, they next felt the pinpricks of transformation center around their chests, as breasts blossomed forward. The smallest of them was still a double D cup, looking huge on Kimi&#39;s small Asian frame. Chris, now Krissy, saw her own F-Cup boobs hanging from her chest, glistening with sweat from the transformation, but one glance over to Craig, now Candy her new mental wiring told her, saw that she was far from the worst off. Candy&#39;s massive J-Cup tits looked like overinflated beachballs hanging from her chest. As they felt their muscle control slowly return to them, Nathan added, &quot;Of course there&#39;s one last thing ruining this picture.&quot; Each one felt their respective dicks slowly recede into their bodies, a mixture of pain and pleasure as they completed their transformation into buxom beauties.<br />
<br />
Nathan laughed to see the disgusted and confused looks on his newly created harem, before he exerted his mental will once more, causing their own personalities to subside in favor of the feminine alter-egos he had created for them. The three former bullies mentally screamed as their bodies became controlled by a mind not their own, as they could only watch in horror as they began to pleasure their tormentor, fondling his massive dick and chiseled body. Before long, Nathan grunted as his load shot out his newly enlarged cock, covering the three harem girls in his own jizz. Nathan laughed as he felt the medallion around his neck, wondering what he could do next...</p>
