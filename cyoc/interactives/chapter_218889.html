<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lucifer and Lilith led Rachel, Maisy, Atargatis, Astaroth, and Baal into the palace&#39;s spacious banqueting hall. The hall reminded Rachel and Atargatis of the palace shrine, but the back marble pillars were built in a more light and airy, almost baroque, style than those of the shrine and there was gilding made from a reddish-gold metal everywhere. Instead of stained glass windows, the room was decorated with erotic frescoes on the walls and ceiling. Atargatis blushed a bit at the lewd subject matter of the frescoes, but she had to admit she was a bit intrigued as well. It all certainly looked a lot more interesting than the bland sex she&#39;d &quot;enjoyed&quot; with Rev. Church.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope this isn&#39;t embarrassing you, darling,&quot; Astaroth whispered to her fiancee. &quot;I know how new to our culture you are.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s true,&quot; Atargatis sighed, glancing from her modest-by-Hell-standards attire to Astaroth&#39;s barely-an-outfit-at-all outfit. &quot;But I think I&#39;m adapting a little. I think I&#39;m actually going to have a good time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Atargatis and Rachel continued to marvel at the room. Its edges were ringed with long tables piles with succulent meats, luscious fruit, and bottles of the finest wine and liquor Hell had to offer. Rachel recognized Nathan Bedford Forrest and the other damned slave-owners being forced to set the tables, still chafing at being made to serve rather than being served. Musicians and nude dancing girls rehearsed in the center of the room, and sacred prostitutes from the shrine filed in to provide their sensual services to the guests.<br />
<br />
&quot;Isn&#39;t this amazing, Maisy?!&quot; Rachel grinned, looking like she was about to burst from the taboo thrill of it all.<br />
<br />
&quot;My, my, aren&#39;t <i>you</i> excited?&quot; Maisy laughed. &quot;I forgot that this was your first party in Hell.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I hope she enjoys it,&quot; said a familiar voice.<br />
<br />
Rachel turned around to see seven distinguished-looking demons walking through the door. She recognized the speaker as Prince Leviathan Morningstar, Lucifer&#39;s brother. These must be the other archdukes and archduchesses!<br />
<br />
&quot;Presenting Prince Leviathan Morningstar,&quot; shouted the palace page, &quot;brother of King Lucifer, Archduke of the Seventh Circle of Hell, Lord of Envy and Heresy, Grand Admiral of the Hellish Navy, and Knight Grand Pentagram of the Order of the Fly!&quot;<br />
<br />
Leviathan ran over to Rachel and clasped his webbed hands around Rachel&#39;s own. &quot;I heard you&#39;d been murdered!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Some aide from the Embassy stabbed me!&quot; Rachel explained. &quot;But it&#39;s okay. I was healed. I think Maisy said something about Heavenly medicine, Penemue, and mingling tears.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And <i>this</i> is exactly why I&#39;m always arguing in favor of warmer relations between Heaven and Hell,&quot; Leviathan smiled. &quot;We can achieve so much more when we work together like the crew of a great cosmic ship. And were the oldest of us demons not once angels ourselves?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I almost still look like one, brother,&quot; Astaroth smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;As if <i>you</i> would ever allow your radiant beauty to be tarnished!&quot; Leviathan chuckled. He grew more serious. &quot;It&#39;s troubling to hear that the anti-human faction has spread its ideology to the embassy, Rachel. Demons like your attacker should NEVER be working closely with demons on Earth looking for human spouses.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He was actually an Iron Knight in disguise,&quot; Baal clarified. &quot;An angel smelled the human in him. No idea how he fooled MY nose, but that&#39;s those fucking Iron Knights for you. Who in Hell can guess where they get their fancy magical toys? My guess would be Kushiel going behind God&#39;s back, but who knows?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I never liked that crazed dogmatist even before the rebellion,&quot; Leviathan frowned. &quot;Perhaps he&#39;s the one ultimately behind the assassination. He&#39;d <i>hate</i> a human willingly marrying the Archdiablesse.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We can&#39;t rule him out,&quot; Lilith nodded. &quot;He tried to murder <i>me</i> at least thirteen times before the treaty was signed... and twice after.&quot;<br />
<br />
Further conversation as the page announced the next arrival. &quot;Presenting Archduke Beelzebub Carrionfly, Archduke of the Eighth Circle of Hell, Lord of pollution and vermin, Chief of Justice, Grandmaster of the Order of the Fly, Overseer of Gluttony and Idolatry, and Grand Chamberlain to King Lucifer!&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel watched as a man with the lower body of an armored centipede crawled into the room, glancing imperiously around with his many eyes (two of which were mounted on roving eyestalks). Scorpion pincers sat menacingly folded behind his hands. So <i>this</i> was Archduke Beelzebub, Lady Cruciata&#39;s father.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lucifer!&quot; Beelzebub called out cheerfully, crawling over to pat the Devil on the back. &quot;I can&#39;t tell you what a huge relief it it to hear that Lady Tenebra pulled through! It&#39;s a pity we had to rely on Heavenly magic, but it is what it is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your daughter&#39;s under suspicion,&quot; Lilith glared.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Beelzebub sighed, skillfully faking regret. &quot;I thought I&#39;d brought the girl up better than this. Such a shame she had such an extreme reaction to her fit of jealousy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you had no involvement?&quot; Lucifer asked, eager to believe his best friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;None at all!&quot; Beelzebub said emphatically. &quot;When you confined her to the Eighth Circle, I gave her a very harsh talking to.&quot; That part at least was true. Beelzebub was furious at his daughter&#39;s carelessness.<br />
<br />
Lucifer&#39;s face relaxed. &quot;That&#39;s good to know, old friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I only wish my other, <i>better</i> children could be here for this party,&quot; said Beelzebub, &quot;but they&#39;re all busy governing their own lands in the Eighth Circle.&quot;<br />
<br />
The page called out another name. &quot;Presenting Belial Lackmaster, Archduke of the Fifth Circle, Lord of Wrath and Rebellion, Ambassador to Italy, and Knight Grand Pentagram of the Order of the Fly!&quot;<br />
<br />
An insanely muscular demon who looked to Rachel like a giant red Minotaur with dragon wings lumbered into the room with a golden ceremonial axe in his grip.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope I&#39;m not late,&quot; Belial grunted. &quot;This party was at short notice.&quot; He then noticed Rachel. &quot;Is that the ex-human the Archdiablesse is marrying this week?&quot; His face and voice carried mild disapproval.<br />
<br />
&quot;She is,&quot; Maisy said firmly. &quot;I love her to bits, and I will tear anyone who tries to stop me <i>into</i> bits!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I meant no offense!&quot; Belial snorted. &quot;You know I&#39;ve always respected House Morningstar. I may not understand your decision, but I&#39;ll go along with it!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Leave it to Belial to nearly start a fight as he walks through the door,&quot; Leviathan smirked, nudging Astaroth with a finned arm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Presenting Archduchess Mammon Goldentrove,&quot; thundered the page, &quot;Archduchess of the Fourth Circle, Lady of Avarice and Theft, Supervisor of the Payroll Commission, Ambassador to the United Kingdom, and Dame Grand Pentagram of the Order of the Fly!&quot;<br />
<br />
A demon covered in silver lupine fur walked in. She hat the ears and tail of a wolf, the horns of a gazelle, the tongue of a serpent, feathered wings, and a long and hunched neck like a vulture.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mammon!&quot; Lilith smiled. &quot;I&#39;m so glad you made it!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m almost surprised you&#39;re throwing a party in the midst of a conspiracy,&quot; said Mammon. &quot;But of course I came. I&#39;d never turn down free entertainment.&quot; She stretched her long neck toward Rachel. &quot;You must be Lady Tenebra, Princess Miasma&#39;s precious little jewel. I hope you appreciate being so valued by House Morningstar. You may not still be alive if they didn&#39;t treasure you so dearly.&quot; She smiled at Rachel. It seemed almost friendly, despite being full of lupine teeth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Presenting Archduke Asmodeus Winekiss,&quot; proclaimed the page, &quot;Archduke of the Third Circle, Lord of Lust and Pleasure, Overseer of the Courtesans and Prostitutes, Superintendent of the Gambling Houses, and Knight Grand Pentagram of the Order of the Fly!&quot;<br />
<br />
In walked a deeply sensual demon with the legs of a rooster, a reptilian tail, draconic wings, and two pair of horns: one pair of ram horns and one pair of bull horns. &quot;You didn&#39;t think I&#39;d dare miss a party, my dear Lucifer?&quot; the Archduke laughed flirtatiously. &quot;I&#39;d dare say it just ISN&#39;T a party without me!&quot; He then noticed Rachel. &quot;And is this lovely creature the fabled Lady Tenebra I&#39;ve heard so much about? She is truly a treat for the senses.&quot; He took Rachel&#39;s hand in his own to kiss it.<br />
<br />
Maisy swatted Asmodeus&#39;s hand away. &quot;Surely you know she&#39;s taken, your lordship?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see you two prefer monogamy,&quot; Asmodeus sighed. &quot;To each their own.&quot; He then wandered off to flirt with some nearly naked courtesans.<br />
<br />
&quot;Presenting Archduke Baphomet Spellhorn,&quot; the page shouted, &quot;Archduke of the Second Circle, Co-Lord of Witchcraft and Forbidden Lore, Vice-Liaison to the Witches, and Knight Grand Pentagram of the Order of the Fly!&quot;<br />
<br />
In stepped a demon with the head of a goat, cloven hooves, raven wings, and copious occult amulets and talismans draped over his bare chest. He gazed silently at Rachel, studying her curiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>co-</i>Lord of Witchcraft and Forbidden Lore?&quot; Rachel asked. &quot;<i>Vice-</i>Liaison to the Witches? Who does he work with?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me,&quot; answered Lilith. &quot;I invented witchcraft with Archduke Baphomet and taught it to humans. Witches worship us as the Great Goddess and the Horned God. While we can no longer actively recruit witches per the treaty, we&#39;re still allowed to aid witches who come to us on their own.&quot;<br />
<br />
Baphomet finally approached Rachel. &quot;Lady Tenebra...&quot; he said musingly. &quot;Your survival is a pleasant surprise. I can only imagic the secret magics that must have preserved you. Heavenly, I assume?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right, Archduke,&quot; said Rachel. &quot;Penemue knows more. Maisy says she was the one who came up with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have always wished to speak with the wise Penemue...&quot; Baphomet said in his thoughtful voice, &quot;but who is Maisy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That was the name I used on Earth,&quot; said Maisy. &quot;I sort of prefer it to &#39;Miasma,&#39; if I&#39;m being honest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see...&quot; Baphomet said, stroking his goat beard with a mysterious smile. &quot;This marriage gladdens me. As Vice-Liaison to the Witches, I have long felt that some of my kind undervalue humans. Perhaps you can change that.&quot; He gave Rachel a knowing wink before joining the party.<br />
<br />
&quot;Presenting Princess Proserpina Morningstar,&quot; called out the page, &quot;daughter of King Lucifer, Archduchess of the First Circle of Hell, Lady of Misdemeanors, Grand Accountant of Human Sin, and Dame Grand Pentagram of the Order of the Fly!&quot;<br />
<br />
Proserpina looked a lot like Lilith, with crimson skin and a serpent tail instead of legs. A pair of goat horns grew from her head and a fine set of black-feathered wings like Maisy&#39;s was folded behind her. She excitedly slithered over to Maisy and hugged her. &quot;Little sis! Congratulations on the engagement!&quot; She then turned to Rachel. &quot;And congratulations to <i>you</i> on surviving that dreadful assassination attempt, Lady Tenebra! My husband and I were revolted when we heard that someone attacked you. I know some of Beelzebub&#39;s friends are sickening bigots, but to think that one of them would stoop to MURDER!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice to meet you,&quot; Rachel smiled. &quot;You can call me Rachel if you like. Did you say that you&#39;re Maisy&#39;s sister?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She did,&quot; smiled Lucifer. &quot;Meet Princess Proserpina Morningstar, my first daughter. She was given the Archduchy of the First Circle after Archduke Azazel died in a Heavenly raid in the days before the treaty was signed. And a very fine archduchess she is!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad!&quot; laughed Proserpina. &quot;Don&#39;t embarrass me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, now you&#39;ve met all the archdukes, Rachel,&quot; Lilith said. &quot;Now that <i>that&#39;s</i> out of the way, let&#39;s get down to the business of reveling!&quot;</p>
