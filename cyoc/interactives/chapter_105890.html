Backtrack a little….<br />
<br />
Eric was beaming from ear to ear when he walked into the sophomore lunch. Naturally everyone was staring at him, but he didn’t care. The second he spotted Spencer his smile got that much larger. Eric was surprised to see John Shaffer sitting beside her.*<br />
<br />
“Hey Eric. What are you doing here?” John asked, moving over so Eric could sit beside his girlfriend. <br />
<br />
“I didn’t get a chance to finish lunch before, so the principal let me skip class.” Eric said. <br />
<br />
“You feeling okay?” Spencer asked, looking Eric over with a careful eye. He seemed physically ok. He’d even stopped walking funny. But that was mostly due to the fact that his confidence had been boosted. <br />
<br />
“All things considered ya. But Julie’s in a heap of trouble. The principal said he was going to have to involve the police, based on what happened yesterday.” Eric said. <br />
<br />
“What happened yesterday?” John asked. <br />
<br />
“Oh, not much. Julie cornered this one while he was busy reading and literally had him by the balls.” Spencer gave Eric a knowing look. He blushed a little as he explained the situation to John. <br />
<br />
“Well that would explain why she was in such a foul mood when I ran into her last night. Geez, she’s really off her rocker isn’t she?” he remarked.<br />
<br />
“If she was ever on it…” Spencer thought. From the moment she’d met Julie, Spencer thought there was something off about her. Aside from the possessive behavior she displayed when she and Eric were still together, Julie always had sex on the brain. <br />
<br />
The three continued their lunch period with conversation about other things. Non-Julie related things. Until one of the teachers came up to Eric and said he was needed in the office again. <br />
<br />
“Police are probably here.” he said, somewhat sad he had to leave. <br />
<br />
“Don’t worry. We’ve seen so much of them they’re like family.” Spencer joked. She was right. Between her nutcase of an ex, Jeremy’s father storming into town, and Eric’s ex, they’d spent more time with the police in the past two weeks than most people did in their entire lives. <br />
<br />
Eric walked back downstairs to the main office. While descending the staircase, Frieda came into view. They didn’t need to ask, they knew they’d both been called for the same reason. The two walked into the office, and came face to face with Moon Lake’s Sheriff and Chief of Police Douglas Cooper. <br />
<br />
“I’ll speak to you Mr. Anderson first.” Cooper decided. He wanted to get the “victim’s” story first. Eric followed Cooper into a spare room, where the two sat down at a long table to talk. <br />
<br />
“So, I understand you’ve had quite the eventful two days? To say nothing of the last week’s events.” Cooper sighed. The poor kid had been through an emotional wringer, what with his girlfriend getting her arm broken into pieces and then this. <br />
<br />
“I guess.” Eric said. The weight of everything having finally lifted, Eric didn’t feel as stressed anymore. <br />
<br />
“I know you’ve probably told this story to about a dozen others, but I need to hear everything. Starting with your relationship with Julie.” Cooper took out a pad and pen to take notes. When he was finished, half the notepad would be filled. <br />
<br />
Eric took his time telling his story. About how he and Julie started dating not long after his family moved to Moon Lake. He made sure to stress how she kept pressuring him into making the big change. And then how he and Spencer met what seemed like a lifetime ago. The two got closer, and then came that night he caught Julie cheating on him. <br />
<br />
Which of course lead to their breakup, and Eric’s budding romance with Spencer. Eric skipped over some of the more intimate parts, and went straight to the most recent events. How Julie was pretending to be “sorry” for he infidelity, and wanted him back. And then how Frieda had approached him in the hall, warning him that Julie was planning on doing something in an act of revenge. <br />
<br />
“And that something was turning you into a weremer?” Cooper surmised. <br />
<br />
“Yes sir.”<br />
<br />
“Alright. So am I to assume your recent change was to prevent Julie from succeeding?” <br />
<br />
“Well not exactly. Things just worked out that way.” Eric began, quickly explaining his predicament regarding what kind of were she should be, and who should be the one to transform him. Not wanting to get Frieda in trouble (since she did technically scratch him without his permission), Eric merely stated that Frieda did it that morning to keep him safe. <br />
<br />
“We only decided after hearing about Julie’s breakup.” Eric finished. And that at least was the truth. <br />
<br />
“Mmm, so you and Ms. Knight were at lunch together when Julie confronted, and later attacked you? And she was the one who pulled Julie away?” <br />
<br />
“That’s correct sir.” Eric said. <br />
<br />
“Very well. I think I’ve got what I need. Thank you Mr. Anderson. If you could, on your way out tell Ms. Knight to come in.” Cooper said, mulling over his notes. He was beginning to wish he was back at the station with the very hungover Cathy Shaffer. Alcoholic weres suddenly seemed less of a bother than this case. <br />
<br />
<br />
*Wasn’t sure if John’s age had ever been established, so I went for it.</p>
