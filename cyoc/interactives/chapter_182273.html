<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll enjoy the feeling when your time comes,&quot; Tyra commented as she glanced to the screen where Heather was trying to conduct the Zoom call.<br />
<br />
On the screen was Sophie, who was trying to keep a reserved smile on her beak, as she&#39;d called to wish Heather a &quot;Happy Mother&#39;s Day,&quot; as by this time she&#39;d been pretty certain that Heather was pregnant. She had not expected that Tyra and Rex would also be visiting for a big family breakfast. It was supposed to be a brief and quiet conversation between friends, which in a way Heather had become over the years after her reformation. She&#39;d soon found herself wish Tyra a happy mother&#39;s day as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure I will,&quot; Sophie said slowly, &quot;but that&#39;ll be some time in the future... getting through college and getting started. Roland and I might even move to Dino City after graduating college and see what we can do. Anyway... I didn&#39;t mean to interrupt a family thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s no problem,&quot; Heather managed, rubbing one hand over her swelling womb. There was no movement, but then, eggs didn&#39;t move, &quot;Grandma and I have always had some way of wishing her a happy mother&#39;s day... sometimes by phone, sometimes by card, and now we&#39;re next door to each other and can share it together. And Rex is fairly big on family events, so things are pretty big.&quot; She paused to glance over to her grandmother, smiling like the cat who&#39;d eaten the prize canary, and rubbing her own womb as well before continuing, &quot;I&#39;m just sorry one of the first things she brings up with you is your own family planning...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s no problem,&quot; Sophie answered, &quot;I&#39;m just glad to see that everyone seems excited.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not excited, I&#39;m nervous!&quot; Jeremy called from the kitchen where he and Rex were working on breakfast. That earned a chuckle from Rex.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ignore him, he was nervous when our mating season started,&quot; Heather answered, &quot;he&#39;ll be fine when they hatch.&quot;<br />
<br />
From there, Heather began to go into the confirmation of her present pregnancy...<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The Horizon Light Hospital in Dino City, in terms of the number of facilities that it wasn&#39;t all that big, largely as even with some new people moving in, Dino City had a relatively small population and most of them had been the first Dinotopians that come when the colony was established. But it did have the means to care for just about anything and everything, which included pregnancies and between Covid becoming less of an issue and Dino City being more established, many Dinotopians that were married couples were now taking advantage of that as they came into season. Among them had been Heather and Tyra, who came in together with Rex and Jeremy following behind.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure as to why you felt the need to schedule our appointments together,&quot; Heather said to Tyra who only grinned back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Celebration, my dear,&quot; Tyra answered, &quot;you&#39;ll know that you&#39;ll have a new aunt or uncle and I&#39;ll get to know if I&#39;ll be a great-grandmother. If Rex and Jeremy were successful... we&#39;re carrying eggs and it will be time to celebrate carrying them. And then we can share tips on what to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wouldn&#39;t it for the moment just being to make sure that there are incubators ready for the egg?&quot; Jeremy wondered as he held Heather&#39;s hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Or eggs,&quot; Tyra smiled, &quot;we could be carrying more than one. But the big thing will then be diaper tips... feeding schedules, all the fun stuff newbie parents need to learn. And while technology may be better than it was when I was young, that doesn&#39;t mean that parenting hasn&#39;t changed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tyra chuckled as she watched Jeremy&#39;s eyes bulge a little and then watched him swallow something. It was something that Tyra took as a sign of Jeremy&#39;s uneasiness or confidence in being a parent, something that she wouldn&#39;t hesitate to tease him on from time to time. As there had been enough &quot;family dinners&quot; that had come up this indication and something that would make for the window to have some fun.<br />
<br />
&quot;Which we can handle,&quot; Heather said squeezing Jeremy&#39;s hand in her own as they made their way in. <br />
<br />
He squeezed her hand back and gave Heather a slightly more confident smile. Though, Heather kept her eyes on Tyra as she had some suspicion as to what her grandmother was up to. The two of them got along well, and in some ways had grown closer in some ways since Dino City got going and they lived as neighbors, but there were still clear differences between Heather and Tyra in that Tyra was more flamboyant with her sexuality and things like that. Those differences then set up the periodic push and pull that they had between them. Rex remained quiet as he opened the door for Tyra and then Heather. They made their way in and approached the front desk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I help you?&quot; the secretary asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Tyra spoke, &quot;I&#39;m Tyra Ramos and this is by grand-daughter Heather Green. We have an appointment with Doctor Simus to confirm a successful mating season for us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; the secretary replied and a small smile, &quot;there have been a few that have come in to see him. Once you&#39;re checked in, you can head in through the hallway to the left and there will be direction signs that will lead you up to that waiting room. You will also need to wear masks while in the hospital.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tyra and Heather both nodded while Jeremy and Rex moved to then pick up the sets of specialized masks for Dinotopians from a nearby table. That gave time for Tyra and Heather to sign in and then move to make their way in. Once the disposable masks were on, it was easy to move about the hallways and find the signs that directed to the hospital&#39;s gynecology department, headed by a Doctor Norton Simus. It required a ride in an elevator, but it allowed for some other conversation to go on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, they have done a good job with the layout,&quot; Rex commented, &quot;Do you frequently have to come over from the Horizon Labs building for things... or...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Generally the hospital and Horizon&#39;s labs are separate,&quot; Jeremy answered, &quot;technically we&#39;re all in one building... as it&#39;s the same complex, but we unless the hospital gets a patient that is either in line to convert or wants to convert to heal from an injury... we don&#39;t interact all that much.&quot;<br />
<br />
They then continued on their way and came into a waiting room where they waited until a middle aged man with glasses came into the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mrs. Ramos, Mrs. Green, I&#39;m ready to see you,&quot; the man spoke.<br />
<br />
Heather and Tyra both got up with Rex and Jeremy following along behind.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a bit odd to see two of you at the same time... but then, a lot of Dinotopians have been coming to see me of late,&quot; Dr. Simus commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s also that we&#39;re family,&quot; Tyra answered, &quot;I am Heather&#39;s grandmother. Becoming a Syntixisaurus got me my youth back which has lead to a lot of fun. A wonderful husband and in many ways reuniting with Heather. So, if our husbands were successful in getting us pregnant... I&#39;d like to be able to celebrate together.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;And from there we did celebrate together,&quot; Heather spoke as she finished the story to Sophie, &quot;there some of the standard questions and they had to draw some blood to confirm it... but that was all pretty normal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They did an ultra sound, too,&quot; Tyra added, &quot;both of us are carrying TWO eggs. It makes me happy. Though I&#39;m still a bit surprised on how close our hormonal patterns are to Humans. I would have thought all of our changes would have changed them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We think that the base formula stays pretty much the same because with the exception of Sophie&#39;s pet and his mate... and the birds that Rex uplifted into Dinotopians, all of us were Human at one point,&quot; Jeremy commented from the kitchen, &quot;Horizon thinks the same base theory applies for all other Animalians as well. There might be some changes in the levels and some other specific details but not much else is different.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wouldn&#39;t that then be similar to what happened with the Maiasaura family?&quot; Rex wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty much,&quot; Jeremy agreed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Still,&quot; Sophie said from the screen, &quot;Happy Mother&#39;s Day. I&#39;m sure my folks may want to visit when Roland, JC, Pauline, and I get out for the summer in a few weeks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We might be able to show you the eggs, but they won&#39;t have hatched by then,&quot; Heather chuckled.</p>
