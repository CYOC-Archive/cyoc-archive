<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Still panting and confused, Steve slid to the wall behind him and managed to prop his back up against it – not that such a simple movement was easy to do.  The skin on his stomach was stretched taut and the presence of the large, squirming object inside of him was severely limiting how much he could move his torso.<br />
<br />
Nonetheless, now that he was sitting up and things had somewhat normalized, Steve was able to look around the room.  Just in front of him – where he had just been – was a small pool of water.  Extending out of that pool, and going all the way to Steve’s crotch, was a trail of moisture glistening on the bathroom’s tile floor.<br />
<br />
Bringing his knees to his belly, Steve was able to slowly rise to his feet.  Taking a few steps back, Steve looked in the bathroom mirror and saw a very frightened rabbit girl staring back at him.  She had two big rabbit ears extending up above her head; wide, terrified eyes, and a short muzzle.  Looking down further, Steve saw that the rabbit had two engorged breasts whose thick nipples were straining against her black crop top.<br />
<br />
Below that, her exposed belly belied the fact that her grey fur gave way to a dull, cream color on her stomach.  Oh, and that her belly was protruding at least a foot out in front of her.  It was protruding so far, in fact, that it almost obscured the damp spot in the crotch of her yoga pants.  ‘Almost obscured’ – despite the rabbit’s heavily pregnant belly, Steve could still see the spot, as well as the beads of moisture that were slowly dripping onto the floor below her.<br />
<br />
Staring in the mirror, Steve couldn’t help but realize that reality didn’t feel… real anymore.  His brain kept telling him that he was looking in a mirror, yet he didn’t see himself.  Instead, he was staring at someone else – a very pregnant rabbit girl who was in the early stages of labor.  That rabbit girl was decidedly not Steve and yet, that was who he saw in the mirror.<br />
<br />
Steve’s brain tried to reconcile what he was seeing by telling him that he wasn’t looking in a mirror.  Instead, it was telling him that he must be looking at some sort of television or monitor.  And yet, the rabbit ears, the muzzle, the engorged breasts, the pregnant stomach.  What Steve saw in the mirror comported with the weight he felt on top of his head, of the buck teeth he felt in his mouth, or the tender nipples he felt rubbing against the crop top on his chest, and of the intense pressure and slow squirming of the baby he could feel inside of his stomach.<br />
<br />
In his previous, opioid addled state he had noticed what had happened to his body without actually comprehending it.  But now that he was sober and staring at himself in the mirror, his new reality merged into his mind and Steve began to comprehend.<br />
<br />
He wasn’t a he.  He wasn’t a human.  The app had altered Steve’s body, warping it from what it had been into the form of a petite, pregnant rabbit.  Steve had been into pictures of pregnant anthros, but that didn’t mean he’d ever wanted to actually be one, much less to give birth.  And yet here he was.  <br />
<br />
Steve wasn’t a male human any longer.  Instead, she was a female rabbit.  A pregnant, female rabbit.  Her sensitive breasts were filled with milk, while her bloated stomach was being stretched by the baby inside of her.  To make things even worse, the water dripping from the damp spot on her pants was her amniotic fluid.  The reason it was dripping was because her water had broken, and she had gone into labor.  The pain that she had just experienced was the result of her first contraction – and while she didn’t know when the next contraction would come, she knew that her earlier contraction was just the first of many.<br />
<br />
Steve didn’t want to accept what he saw, but whether he accepted it or not didn’t matter.  He was about to give birth to the baby of the drug addict who was still lying unconscious on the floor next to him.<br />
<br />
Oh shit!  Had the app sobered the addict up as well?  Steve looked down to see that he was still laying next to the toilet, just as unconscious as before.  Phew.  Well, that was one less problem to deal with.<br />
<br />
Walking over to the phone, Steve kept one hand on his stomach as he slowly squatted down to grab it, before taking a seat on the floor.  Man, he’d never realized just how important his waist was in sitting down, but now that his new stomach prevented him from bending there, he had a full appreciation for just how difficult something like sitting down was when you had a baby inside of you.  It also didn’t help that, while the pain of the contraction had vanished, there was a constant, burning pain coming from his lower back.<br />
<br />
But none of that mattered, what mattered was fixing his current situation.  Opening up the phone, he saw that the timer had run down to 0 and his prior sentence was still loaded:<br />
<br />
“The sober anthropomorphic rabbit’s water just broke.”<br />
<br />
He tried to think of how he could change that to improve his situation, but with his prior theory about this app not being a monkey paw now thoroughly out the window, Steve didn’t want to chance it with that sentence.  After all, let’s say that Steve added “didn’t” before “just” – would that mean that the app would just reset him to right before his water broke, forcing him to go through that again?</p>
