<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Wrote this at the request of a reader who asked to stay anonymous. </div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Dad…you okay?” Jeff asked, slightly concerned at his father’s silence. While his father had just spoken a second ago, there was a small part of Jeff that feared the possibility that some sort of feral instinct had taken over Mike’s mind. <br />
<br />
“I’m fine Jeff,” Mike replied. “I’m just…at a loss for words right now. My childhood dream has finally come true, and it feels…it feels fantastic…” He paused for a second, seemingly considering something. <br />
<br />
“Jeff…” Mike spoke up after a few seconds of silence. “Why don’t you join me?” <br />
<br />
“Huh?” Jeff responded, shocked by his dad’s request. “You want me to become a wolf like you?” <br />
<br />
“Why not?” Mike asked with a shrug. “You changed me, so how about you let me change you?” <br />
<br />
Jeff thought quietly to himself for a second before nodding his head in agreement. “Alright, I’ll give it a try,” he said. “Let me go change into some old clothes.” <br />
<br />
Jeff proceeded to walk over to his dresser and begin looking for some clothes to wear while he transformed. As he did, Mike sat down in front of Jeff’s computer and began looking at the options on screen. He selected “gray wolf” and double-clicked Jeff’s name. The program pulled up a second window containing a crude 3D model of Jeff and his stats in a matter of seconds. As impressive as it was, Mike still found it slightly creepy that this program was able to display everything from his weight to his age in a matter of seconds. <br />
<br />
Mike clicked the “Alterations” column, confirming that the first stat said ‘Species: Gray Wolf (“Anthro” Modified)’. As he was about to stop and wait for Jeff, his gaze drifted to some of the other options on the page. <br />
<br />
“Transformation Length, huh?” Mike said to himself. The box labeled ‘All Changes at Once’ was checked. Mike frowned and unchecked the box. He wanted Jeff to be able to enjoy each part of his body changing instead of having it all change at the same time like his. <br />
<br />
Another option soon caught Mike’s attention. A few options down was a slider labeled “Feel of Transformation”. The slider was set in the middle at an option labeled “Slight Pain/Slight Pleasure”. The rightmost option on the slider was labeled “No Pain/All Pleasure.” <br />
<br />
Not wanting his son to experience pain during his transformation, Mike adjusted the slider to the rightmost option. The “Apply” button at the bottom began to pulse, and Mike sat back in the chair. He wasn’t going to click the button until Jeff was here. <br />
<br />
“Jeff sure is taking his sweet time,” Mike said quietly to himself. “Maybe I can finally check…” He trailed off as his gaze fell onto his swim trunks. A little peek wouldn’t hurt…<br />
<br />
Curiosity getting the better of him, Mike pulled back the hem of his shorts and peered down at his junk. Amidst the fur that covered his thighs was a sheath that housed his canine member. Mike stared at his sheath in fascination. If that’s what the sheath looked like, then what did…<br />
<br />
The sound of the door opening made Mike pull his hand away from his shorts quickly. He turned around to see Jeff wearing a pair of swim trunks and nothing else. <br />
<br />
“No shirt?” Mike asked, looking over his son’s appearance. <br />
<br />
Jeff shook his head. “No, I don’t really have any shirts that I’d be willing to ruin. Is that okay?” <br />
<br />
“Yeah, of course it’s fine,” Mike replied. “We’re both men. There’s no shame. Anyways, I set up your changes on the program. They’re mostly the same as mine, although I made a few minor changes.”<br />
<br />
“Changes?” Jeff asked, sounding slightly concerned. “Like what? You didn’t do anything major…right?”<br />
<br />
“No! Nothing like that!” Mike reassured him. “I just wanted your changes to be a bit more pleasurable. I set it so that everything wouldn’t change all at once and there wouldn’t be any pain. Here, you can see for yourself!” <br />
<br />
Mike rolled the chair out of the way of the computer, allowing Jeff to walk up and read over the changes he had made. After a minute, Jeff relaxed, and Mike sighed in relief. The last thing he wanted was his son to back out on this incredible experience. <br />
<br />
“Sorry for doubting you dad,” Jeff apologized. “I’ll let you take control of the program for now.” The young man stepped back from the computer and stood where his father had been standing a few minutes prior. <br />
<br />
“Alright Dad, hit the Apply button,” he said. Mike nodded and moved the cursor over the pulsing button before left-clicking it. <br />
<br />
A pleasurable warmth suddenly appeared in Jeff’s body, causing the young man to let out a sudden gasp. The warmth lingered in his body for a moment before beginning to manifest down in his feet. Both Mike and Jeff looked down to see Jeff’s feet begin to swell and reshape into canine paws, with black leathery paw pads growing underneath. His nails began to darken and sharpen, lengthening into long claws. <br />
<br />
“Fuck….”Jeff panted, wiggling the digits of his new paws. “This feels…really good…” The balls of Jeff’s feet began to rise off the ground as his legs shifted into a digitigrade structure. Not long after, white fur began to grow on Jeff’s paws and move up his legs. <br />
<br />
Mike was watching his son’s changes with avid fascination. While he had partially seen his own changes, seeing the same thing happen to someone else was a far different experience. In fact, it was actually a bit arousing. Mike pulled back the hem of his swim trunks and saw his crimson cock beginning to emerge from its hiding place. The older wolf quietly panicked, not wanting Jeff to realize that his father had a hard-on from watching him. <br />
<br />
Jeff, meanwhile, was oblivious to his father’s plight, as he was far too engrossed in his changes. The feeling of fur spreading up his skin felt incredible, as if someone was delicately running their soft hands up his legs. Jeff shuddered as his ass began to pitch up, and a small lump began to form at the base of his tailbone. The young man moaned as the lump began to grow in size, pushing his swim trunks down and revealing his furry ass. <br />
<br />
Upon seeing his son’s changed ass, Mike found himself unable to look away. This was soon accompanied by a strange, yet appealing, smell coming from Jeff. Although Mike had never smelt anything like it before, something in his head told him that it was the scent of a young, virile, male wolf that could challenge his position as alpha. <br />
<br />
Unable to stop his sudden instincts, Mike approached Jeff and pushed the changing male onto his bed. Jeff let out a canine-sounding yelp of surprise as he was shoved onto the soft bed.<br />
<br />
“D-Dad?” Jeff asked. “What are you-?” The younger man was cut off by his father pressing his muzzle against his lips. Jeff’s eyes went wide for a second before he began to return the kiss, wrapping his arms around his dad’s big, furry neck. As Jeff kissed Mike, his jaw began to push outwards, making their kiss a bit less awkward. <br />
<br />
When they finally broke their kiss, Jeff laid down on his back, panting heavily as he looked up at his father. “Dad, I…I need you…”<br />
<br />
Mike shook his head. “No…this is wrong…” he said. “You…you’re my son. I’m your dad. We…we can’t-” <br />
<br />
“Then don’t be my dad,” Jeff interrupted. “Be my <I>alpha</I>.” <br />
<br />
The smell coming from Jeff’s body and the neediness in his voice was enough to push Mike over the edge. Dropping down, he placed his large, clawed hands on Jeff’s ass and spread his cheeks apart before shoving his muzzle into his son’s hole. <br />
<br />
Jeff let out a loud moan as his virgin hole was penetrated by his father’s tongue. At the same time, his cock was quickly consumed by a newly formed sheath, which quickly became covered in white fur. It wasn’t long before his cock began to re-emerge from its new home looking completely different. Jeff’s cock had taken on a crimson red color, and the tip had changed from a rounded mushroom-like shape to a more pointed shape. At the base of his new cock was a knot, perfect for “tying” him to anyone he bred. Of course, that wouldn’t be of much use now. <br />
<br />
Jeff’s hands began to shift as paw pads grew in on the palms of his hands and the tips of his fingers. His fingernails darkened and lengthened into claws that he used to dig into the blanket beneath him. The young man was panting as Mike thoroughly rimmed his asshole, his lengthening tongue lolling out of his mouth as he let himself get lost in a world of pleasure. <br />
<br />
Mike eventually stopped rimming Jeff’s hole. He pulled his muzzle away and looked down at his mostly transformed son. Jeff’s chest and arms were mostly covered in white fur now, with the young man’s jaw still formed into a proto-muzzle. That would, of course, change in a matter of minutes. <br />
<br />
Grabbing Jeff’s hips, Mike lined the tip of his canine cock with the entrance to Jeff’s hole. He gently poked and prodded at the entrance, making the young man beneath him moan every so often. <br />
<br />
“I’m going to take you now, boy,” Mike growled in a seductive tone. “This will be the beginning of a strong pack.” Before Jeff could even protest (though it wasn’t like he had the desire to do so anyway), Mike shoved his cock deep into Jeff’s hole. <br />
<br />
Jeff cried out in ecstasy as his ass was penetrated for the first time. The feeling of having his ass stretched wide open by a thick canine cock was like nothing he’d ever imagined! He moaned as the white fur spread up his neck, tickling his chin as his jaw moved away from the rest of his face even further. His nose, which had flattened during its migration, darkened and split in order to take on a canine appearance. <br />
<br />
“Yes…change boy!” Mike growled as he began thrusting into his son’s hole. “Change for your alpha!” <br />
<br />
Jeff let out another cry of pleasure as fur overtook his face and muzzle. As his ears migrated to the top of his head and turned triangular in shape, Jeff’s tail finally finished growing in as his eyes took on a yellow hue. <br />
<br />
Mike’s thrusts had picked up in speed and power as he continued to ram the smaller male in the ass over and over again. He could feel himself getting close. His knot was ready to go into Jeff’s quivering hole. He just needed one…more…good…push! <br />
<br />
Mike’s knot slipped into Jeff’s hole, causing the smaller wolf to howl in ecstasy as his ass was stretched even wider. Unable to contain himself any longer, Jeff squirt a pitiful amount of human cum onto his chest before a much larger amount of pure lupine cum erupted from his cock, coating his chest in wolf jizz. The smell was enough to push Mike past his limit, as he threw back his head and howled as he flooded his son’s insides with his canine cum. He came for about a minute straight before finally stopping. Panting heavily, he collapsed on top of Jeff, who licked his muzzle. <br />
<br />
“We, uh, really just did that, huh?” Mike asked, post-nut clarity beginning to kick in. <br />
<br />
“Yeah…I guess we did…” Jeff replied. “It wasn’t that bad in all honesty. It was actually pretty good.”<br />
<br />
Mike chuckled. “Yeah, I’d be lying if I said I didn’t enjoy it a little, but we should probably keep this between ourselves. This kind of stuff is viewed as taboo.”<br />
<br />
Just then, there was a knock at their front door which brought them both back to reality. <br />
<br />
“Fuck, I forgot that Finn and Dave were coming over to watch football,” Mike growled. He got off of Jeff and pulled his knot out of Jeff’s hole with a slight “pop!” Jeff moaned as his hole was stretched and cum began to leak down his thighs. Such a shame it all had to go to waste.  <br />
<br />
“Go get cleaned up and meet us downstairs when you’re done,” Mike said before leaving Jeff’s room.</p>
