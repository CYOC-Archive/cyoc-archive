<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Even before they learned about the pituitary tumor, Sancha knew that they were different. Yes, they were always non-binary, though they didn&#39;t actually understand what that meant until they were older. All Sancha was that the pronouns &#39;she/her&#39; never felt right for them. Nor did they think that felt like a &#39;he/him&#39;. They didn&#39;t understand the concept of non-binary until they heard about it when they were 10. It took a while for Sancha to articulate how they viewed themselves to their parents. Fortunately, Sancha&#39;s parents were supportive, even if they found the concept of non-binary hard to grasp. Though Sancha&#39;s parents advised them to declare themselves openly just yet. As a Mayan-descended family who legally immigrated from Mexico generations ago, they were already a target for anti-Latino discrimination without people getting on Sancha&#39;s case for being...gender nonconforming.<br />
<br />
In hindsight, Sancha wondered if them being non-binary was an early sign of their pituitary problem. A person&#39;s gender identity is far more than what their glands tell them and there were plenty of other non-binaries who don&#39;t have any hormone imbalance. Still, it was an odd coincidence that their pituitary gland would develop a tumor that would completely upset the balance of their testosterone and estrogen. It also left them very lepton-deficient which caused them to gain a lot more weight at their age than they should. The abnormality didn&#39;t really register until Sancha was halfway past 13, which lead to over a year of testing, diagnosing, and treatments. However, the problem gland&#39;s location meant that traditional surgery and radiation therapy would have a high chance of killing her. And that left only one other means of saving Sancha&#39;s life.<br />
<br />
Once Sancha learned that Animalian conversion was the only option they had left, they had a few demands about how they&#39;ll be changed. First, they were going to become a jaguar Animalian, something to reflect their ancient Mayan heritage. Second, they were going to become a hermaphrodite, which would probably be the best answer to their non-binary nature. And since they were going to be converted on their 15th birthday, they wanted to be double-dosed. Their parents were hesitant about their daughter changing themselves so much, but if this would bring them closer to their inner self-image, they were willing to oblige.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Sancha listened patiently as the Horizon Labs scientist explained how her conversion was going to happen. “Originally, when we created Animalian hermaphrodites with a new species, it involved uplifting an animal with the hermaphrodite strain first before we can start applying the new herm selection to humans. But we’ve isolated the unique X/Y chromosome that allows fully-functional hermaphroditism and can apply it to existing Animalian strains. As such, all it requires is for you to drink this.” He handed them a glass full of a thick white liquid.<br />
<br />
Sancha took it and commented, “It looks like milk.”<br />
<br />
“It is milk. Donated by two of our resident jaguar Animalians in order to give you a double dose. We do have a small community of them living in Lyre and you will be the first hermaphrodite among them. Not many girls can say that,” said the scientist.<br />
<br />
“I’m not really a girl,” said Sancha.<br />
<br />
“Oh, I’m sorry, I didn’t realize the hormone imbalance was that bad,” said the scientist.<br />
<br />
“It’s not just that. Even before it started, I was non-binary,” said Sancha.<br />
<br />
“Oh, I don’t think that was mentioned in the paperwork,” said the scientist.<br />
<br />
Sancha sighed and said, “It’s not going to matter. I’m about to go from non-binary to literal binary, aren’t I?”<br />
<br />
“That’s one way to put it,” said the scientist, “Just so you, the herm pronouns are shi/hir, with an ‘i’.”<br />
<br />
“That’s going to take time to get used to,” said Sancha, “But that probably the least of it, compared to everyone else.”<br />
<br />
“We’ll have plenty of people to help you with that,” said the scientist before heading to the door. “And welcome to Animalia.” He closed the door behind him.<br />
<br />
For a moment, Sancha hesitated. Did they really want to change their gender identity like this? But then, being a herm might be the best answer for a non-binary. Before Sancha can reason themselves out of it, they quickly drank down the glass. The jaguar milk wasn&#39;t creamy as the milk they usually drank. They put the glass down on a table and waited for the changes to start.<br />
<br />
They didn&#39;t take long. Sancha felt waves of heat and energy radiating from their core. It was like they swallowed a star, but it didn&#39;t burn. It did become uncomfortable when their clothes started getting tight. Sancha was aware of how they&#39;d be inevitably outgrowing their clothes, but they couldn&#39;t resist growing out of their clothes like superheroes did when they first get their superpowers. There was only a brief amount of slack as they lost fat because they were certainly not losing any mass. A good amount of that mass seemed to be focused on extending their bones as Sancha was getting quite a bit of height. That included the alteration of bones as their feet lifted up their arches and their cocyx started extending from their lower back. Sancha could feel their skull reshaping as their face began to push out into a muzzle. Their ears grew rounder and larger as reddish-yellow and white started growing over their body along with the distinctive spots and rosettes of the jaguar.<br />
<br />
As Sancha&#39;s body grew, the fat on them didn&#39;t seem to so much as disappear as much as it molded itself into muscles. And considering the tone of their arms, legs, and abs, there were quite a lot of muscles. And Sancha was growing in more than one way. As their abs grew more defined, so did their waist especially as their hips and butt started growing up. And while they had originally developed some breasts, they seemed more like flabby fat deposits. But now they were becoming rounder, perkier, and a lot more sensitive. Sancha moaned as they felt their growing orbs fill their shirt. Pretty soon, it was ripped apart completely, exposing their growing boobs to the open air. They cupped them in their hands, feeling the paw pads forming on their palms. &quot;You&#39;re going to be making your own <i>leche</i> soon,&quot; they said, their voice growing deeper.<br />
<br />
The next phase of Sancha&#39;s change started soon after their pants and underwear were torn apart. Their clitoris had become larger than normal because of the mixed hormones and looked misshapen. But now it was becoming even larger and taking on a more distinctive shape as nubs soon covered its length. Their deepening vagina was pushed back to make room for a new scrotum which soon started to swell with two new orbs. Sancha wrapped a hand around their clit as it grew more and more into a feline Animalian penis, the nubs on it being more universally comfortable than the spikes on a normal feline penis. Their other hand reached behind to feel their pussy, which was getting quite wet. &quot;Well, it looks like I&#39;m officially a herm,&quot; said Sancha before starting to get themselves, no, hirself off. Shi jacked hir meaty dick while shi plunged deeper into hir dripping chasm. Between hir two new sexual organs, Sancha quickly build up to an explosive climax. Shi let out a mighty jaguar roar as shi spouted and sprayed for the first time.<br />
<br />
It was only after hir heart calmed down that Sancha noticed how small the room shi was in looked. Smaller than shi had expected. Shi carefully walked to the mirror, soon finding shi had to duck a bit to look at hir new self fully. Shi was a very impressive jaguar. Not only was shi quite tall, but very thickly muscled, but balanced with incredible curves. Shi looked like an amazon, no, a titaness with hir new physique. Though no amazon or titaness had such a large dick and balls between hir legs. Shi turned around to examine hir chiseled back. Shi moved hir black hair out of the way, which now fell like an obsidian waterfall all the way to her curvaceous ass.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, this is an improvement,&quot; said the new herm jaguar, hir voice a deep, rumbling purr dripping with Latina sultriness. &quot;I definitely don&#39;t look like a &#39;Sancha&#39; anymore. A new body deserves a <i>nombre nuevo</i>. Hmm... yes, I think I shall go by &#39;Nio&#39; now.&quot; Nio posed hir new body in the mirror. Shi didn&#39;t just have the body of a supermodel, shi had the body of a bodybuilder. Shi heard that Animalia had bodybuilding competitions and shi looked like a shoe-in. &quot;I can&#39;t wait to see everyone&#39;s face at my <i>quinceañera</i>,&quot; said Nio smugly.</p>
