<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">That evening the household swelled by more than just the extra infant. The matronly cook Betsy and her 13 year old daughter Chelsea, who worked as a maid returned. They had evidently fled to Betsy&#39;s brother&#39;s farm when the Rebel army approached but had now returned as the expected violence had not taken place. They were very welcoming to &quot;Jasmine&quot; and the two new infants. Simon explained how &quot;Jasmine&quot; was Pyotr&#39;s new wet nurse, that Bry was Jasmine&#39;s daughter and the red headed girl was an orphan temporarily in Jasmine&#39;s care.<br />
<br />
&#39;Taking on an orphan when you are already feeding two infants? You are a charitable young woman. Does you milk supply suffice? I will cook up my special soup for you. I was taught how to make it by my mother when Chelsea was born. It aids in milk production&#39;<br />
<br />
Patricia was listening &#39;Betsy your soup tastes disgusting and did not help my milk supply&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Oh but it works Mistress. Your milk didn&#39;t come on because you are a blonde. Everyone know&#39;s that blondes can&#39;t feed babies. I&#39;ll send Chelsea out to resupply our stocks of vegetables. That&#39;s what you need - lots of my green vegetable soup&#39;<br />
<br />
Meanwhile Pyotr had woken. Jasper put him to her breast keep his cry&#39;s from waking the other two infants, who had only recently been placed in the crib. Pyotr immediately began to suckle. Jasper was relieved as her breasts were already swollen and she desperately needed them emptied.<br />
<br />
&#39;He suckles well&#39; Betsy observed. &#39;I am glad you took my advice Master. He will thrive now that he has a fecundant tit to attach to&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;It was fortuitous to come across Jasmine&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Come husband. I need you to accompany me to the silversmiths. I have an errand I must perform&#39; <br />
.......<br />
An hour later, Jasper was happily suckling Bry and the former Lord Lake. She had the use of a rocking chair that Simon had bought for Patricia. Pyotr was lying in the crib gazing at the roof and seemed happy enough. Suddenly there was once more knocking on the door.<br />
<br />
Fortunately Betsy was home. Jasper heard who answer &#39;Who is it?&#39;<br />
<br />
An authoritative voice answered. &#39;Her ladyship, the Dowager Countess of the Lake wishes to see the child that was found this morning&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Oh! The Master and Mistress are not home..... Your Ladyship&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;I am not here to see your Master or Mistress. I wish to see this child. Is she here or not?&#39; said a haughty female voice.<br />
<br />
Jasper remembered the countess, Genevieve was her name and she was a renowned beauty. She had been a childhood friend of Jasper&#39;s mother so she knew the woman&#39;s story. At 19 she had been married off to Lord Lake senior. He was 70 at that time. They had one child, the current Lord Lake, though perhaps that name was no longer appropriate thought Jasper, looking at the babe on her breast. The son had been no friend of Prince Jasper&#39;s, he had been radicalised and had gone across to the rebels when he ascended to the title.<br />
<br />
It seemed that the lady had forced her way in. Jasper could hear multiple footsteps on the stairs and Betsy objecting to the intrusion. &#39;Get out of my way woman! Where is this child?&#39;<br />
<br />
The door to the nursery opened and a few seconds later Genevieve, Dowager countess of the Lake, was standing in front of Jasper. She was dressed in an frilly emerald gown with an enormous bussle, so she appeared to fill the room. Despite her husband dying at least 10 years ago she was also wearing a black bonnet to signify she was a grieving widow. <br />
<br />
Jasper watched the woman dismiss the soldier with her then scan the infants in the room. Her eyes soon settled on the red headed baby attached to Jasper&#39;s left breast. &#39;Is that the child? Show her to me&#39;<br />
<br />
Despite Jasper knowing he she was, she asked &#39;And who are you to barge in while I am nursing?&#39;<br />
<br />
The woman must have realised her rudeness. Her face somewhat softened &#39;Forgive me nurse. I am the Dowager Countess of the Lake. I was told that a child bought to the orphanage was being cared for at this address. A child with red hair. I would like to see this babe and ascertain it&#39;s heritage&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;This is the child you speak of. She was found abandoned this morning&#39; Jasper indicated the former Lord Lake. I feel that she is nearly satisfied. When she detaches I will show her to you&#39;  <br />
<br />
Jasper took her time and made the lady wait. She did not tell the lady to take a seat as there were no other seats in the room, only the crib and the mattress Jasper was using as a bed.<br />
<br />
Eventually the babe detached. Jasper covered herself then turned the baby so the Countess could see its face.<br />
<br />
Clearly the woman recognised that face &#39;The child is so young. It is a newborn?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;I would estimate the child is but one or two weeks. All she wants to do is suckle&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;It is a girl? Is she healthy?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;She suckles hungrily. What is this child to you?&#39; Jasper thought to put the woman on the spot.<br />
<br />
&#39;Perhaps she is my grandchild. Perhaps not.... I would see that the child is cared for... You are a wet nurse. What is your name?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;I am called Jasmine&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Well Jasmine, care for this child well and perhaps there will be a reward for you. I would like to stay informed of her progress. Here is my card. Show it to your master. He will know how to contact me. I have arranged with the matron to organise a suitable adoption but that can wait until the child is weaned&#39; The woman looked around the room. &#39;Do you keep three infants in the same crib?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;That is all we have&#39; <br />
<br />
&#39;I will have you sent a second crib and some clothes, befitting for a child of noble blood, sent to you&#39; <br />
<br />
With that the woman turned around and left. Betsy returned after the front door closed. &#39;I am sorry Jasmine. She had soldiers with her and I couldn&#39;t keep her out&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;It is of no concern. I am actually hoping it may be a boon for us&#39;</p>
