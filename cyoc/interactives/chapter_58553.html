<br />
7:00am. The alarm clock buzzed wildly on the nightstand. <br />
<br />
A hand emerged from a pile of sheets and pillows to hit the snooze button. The sheets <br />
began to move around. From under the pile of fabric came another arm and a torso. <br />
Feet stretched out from the other end. The pillow rose and fell off the head that <br />
accompanied the body.<br />
<br />
Flipping over, the boy rose to a sitting position and rubbed his eyes. He brushed his <br />
hand through his short blonde hair and then scratched his hairless, muscular chest. <br />
His blue eyes opened and saw the sun streaming in the window. <br />
<br />
&quot;Owen,&quot; a voice came from the other side of the door; his mom, &quot;Wake up, or you'll <br />
miss the bus!&quot;<br />
<br />
Owen flipped his covers off and stood up. He changed his underwear and put on <br />
some fresh clothes. He then turned the alarm completely off and trudged to the <br />
bathroom. A quick splash of cool water and some minty fresh breath later, he walked <br />
into the living room. <br />
<br />
&quot;Happy Birthday!&quot; his mother exclaimed. &quot;Oh, I can't believe my baby's 17 already!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ma!&quot; Owen said in embarassment. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, sorry, hun, but I just can't believe it!&quot; she cooed. &quot;Your father said to tell you <br />
happy birthday before he left. And your sister made this card.&quot;<br />
<br />
She handed him a piece of notebook paper with balloons and stars drawn on it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Here's your present, sweetie, from all of us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Opening the gift, Owen found a new MP3 player (he had lost his old one on a plane <br />
trip last summer). <br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks ma,&quot; he said and gave her a hug. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! You better hurry or you'll miss the bus...too late,&quot; she said as the bus rolled past <br />
the window. She wrote him a note and gave it to him. &quot;Here's an excuse, now run <br />
along. And don't forget to be home early tonight. Your grandma's coming over!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, ma!&quot;<br />
<br />
As Owen walked down the street, a convertable drove up to him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Welsh! Need a lift?&quot; his buddy asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;No thanks, Jake, I got an excuse. Think I'll take my time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, well happy birthday, see you in class!&quot; he replied as he sped off. <br />
<br />
Owen's high school was in the &quot;downtown&quot; of a small city, if you could call it that. <br />
Orville was definitely not a metropolis by any standard. A police station, a firehouse, a <br />
hospital, a library, the elementary and high schools, a city hall, a courthouse, some <br />
office buildings, a few apartments, a post office, and a general store were the extents <br />
of civilization in Orville. <br />
<br />
However, Orville, Tennesee had been selected for an odd sort of gathering. From <br />
Monday to Saturday, the community center had been rented out to a furry convention. <br />
It wasn't one of the big-name ones that the whole furry community had heard of, just a <br />
gathering of furs from the western half of the state. <br />
<br />
Owen Welsh wasn't sure why they would want to come to Orville (of course, he wasn't <br />
sure why they dressed in costumes, either) but it brought money to the town every <br />
year and really helped the local economy. In fact, Owen had signed up to help prepare <br />
for the convention for the past three years. It wasn't much pay—four bucks an hour—<br />
but it gave him some spending cash that he could do whatever he wanted with. He <br />
also helped with cleanup and usually got 40 bucks out of the whole deal. <br />
<br />
After an uneventful day at school, Owen rushed home. His grandmother had arrived <br />
from Nashville and his whole family was there for cake and icecream. After a nice <br />
party and a gift of a WalMart gift card from his grandma, Owen excused himself to go <br />
to work.<br />
<br />
The grand opening was tonight and he wanted to squeeze in some hours before the <br />
crowds of people in fursuits arrived. <br />
<br />
His buddy, Dan, from earlier was there, too, prepping tables. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Owen, how was the party?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty good,&quot; he answered, &quot;My grandma came from Nashville.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You saved me some cake right?&quot; Dan asked jokingly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, door's open. Why don't you come on over tonight after work, unless of course, <br />
my little sister's eaten it all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, will do! See you later!&quot;<br />
<br />
Owen went to the bar to get his assignment: sweep the dance floor and hook up the <br />
soundsystem. The owner of the community center knew Owen and knew that he was <br />
good with technical stuff. Instead of hiring the local tech specialist—who he had been <br />
feuding with forever—he just called Owen when he needed help. <br />
<br />
Owen walked over to the sound system and started hooking it up. Might as well start <br />
with the harder of the two jobs.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see you're good with tech stuff,&quot; a slightly muffled voice came.<br />
<br />
Owen got out from under the table he had been working on and turned around. He <br />
came face to muzzle with someone in a wolf suit.<br />
<br />
~Great,~ he thought, ~An early arrival.~<br />
<br />
Owen observed the furry. He was dressed in a full body suit of blue-grey fur with a tail <br />
sticking out the back. Over this was a dark red vest with a quarter zipper and silver <br />
trimming. The fur also wore black jean shorts held up with a brown leather belt and a <br />
black arm brace on his right forearm. This all looked extremely realistic, even the <br />
paw/hands. But on top of this costume was a very cheesy wolf head with plastic anime <br />
eyes and a felt tongue hanging out. <br />
<br />
&quot;You know,&quot; the fur remarked, &quot;I've never been good with machines. My girlfriends the <br />
one who does all the technical stuff.&quot;<br />
<br />
The furry sounded to Owen to be a boy around his age, but he couldn't be sure. And <br />
he definitely didn't recognize them from school. <br />
<br />
&quot;Name's Andres,&quot; he introduced, offering a paw. <br />
<br />
&quot;Owen,&quot; he accepted the hand. It even felt real. <br />
<br />
He wondered why someone would spend money on such a good costume, but get a <br />
poor quality head. However, he didn't ask for fear of being offensive. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nice to meet you Owen. Do go to school around here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, right down the street. I'm a junior. And you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Senior, Parkhurst High, about ten miles north of Nashville.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't think they allowed teenagers at these things.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They don't. But me and my girlfriend come every year. We don't drink, so we don't <br />
figure we're doing anything wrong.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; he replied, &quot;You said you've been coming here every year. Have you used the <br />
same costume?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep. Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I've worked here three years and thought I'd seen every costume. But this one is new <br />
to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What, no one else has ever been a wolf?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but not this realistic.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yeah,&quot; he laughed, &quot;Except for the head, but it was all I could find.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What did it cost?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The head cost $80, but the suit didn't cost a thing. It's all natural.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You made your costume out of a real wolf?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I guess you could say that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So how did you make it?&quot; Owen asked, truly interested now. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, can't tell you here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Here, follow me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Owen wasn't sure about following the stange guy, but he was curious. They went <br />
down the hall to a broom closet that hadn't been used in years since the addition had <br />
been made. Warily following inside, Owen flicked on the lights and closed the door. <br />
<br />
&quot;There's a reason why my suit looks so real. But can I trust you to...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Andres! What the hell are you doing?&quot; a feminine voice came from behind an empty <br />
shelf. &quot;*Gasp* You were going to tell him, weren't you?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Another furry, this one in a white cat suit with a purple gown on, steeped out into the <br />
room. Her suit was quite realistic like Andres', but her head was cheaply made as well. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, sweetie, I was just...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you to shut up about it, but you never listen! I knew I shouldn't have let you <br />
come here! I knew you couldn't keep your yap shut!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But, honey, I was...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No excuses! I can't let you go blabbing our secret to the whole human race!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Arya!&quot; he yelled to get her attention, &quot;I think he might be the one!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Owen asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;I believe you could be the one we've been looking for! The one to help us!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know what you're talking about!&quot; Owen argued. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, alright!&quot; Arya interjected, &quot;We'll show him.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, the two teens removed their big heads. But instead of revealing two normal <br />
people, they revealed the heads of an actual wolf and cat!<br />
<br />
Owen was shocked. Two real anthros were here, walking and talking and telling him <br />
he was the one they were looking for.<br />
<br />
Under the circumstances, no one could blame Owen Welsh for his next action. He <br />
fainted.</p>
