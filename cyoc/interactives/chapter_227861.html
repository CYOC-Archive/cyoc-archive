<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Derek and Sonya had probably roleplayed hundreds of different TF scenarios over the years, sometimes over text messages, sometimes in person, oftentimes in the bedroom. Now they could all be real. But not all at once, which was why Derek found himself racking his brain, trying to think of a good one to start with. Then he glanced at a bookshelf on the wall behind Sonya, most of which was taken up by a pile of stuffed animals saved from Derek&#39;s childhood. That reminded him of a roleplay they had done not too long ago, one that he knew Sonya had really enjoyed. He turned his gaze back to his girlfriend and smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, it&#39;s getting pretty late... and I&#39;m starting to feel kind of sleep. I think it might be time to get ready for bed,&quot; Derek said. He knew full well that, while it was pretty late at night, the two of them rarely went to sleep before 2 or 3 in the morning when they were together. He feigned a yawn, unconvincingly.<br />
<br />
Sonya raised an eyebrow at that. She knew that tone of voice very well: as much as she enjoyed roleplaying with her boyfriend, she had to admit that Derek was not a very good actor. So this was clearly the start of a scenario, and probably one they&#39;d played out before. She was trying to remember which one, though. Then she locked eyes with Derek and smirked. Could this be...?<br />
<br />
&quot;Sonya,&quot; Derek said softly and with a tone of mock seriousness, &quot;I command you to become my teddy bear, able to move and talk but otherwise indistinguishable from any of my other stuffed animals.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes!&quot; Sonya couldn&#39;t help but shout. &quot;I love this one!&quot; She pumped her fists in the air in front of her, and was thrilled when she could see that her arms were already starting to develop a thin coating of brown synthetic fur. She and Derek watched the slowly forming coat in utter amazement. This collar thing really worked! This was going to change both of their lives, both literally and figuratively.<br />
<br />
But right now, it was specifically changing Sonya. As soon as she could tear her eyes away from her transforming arms, she immediately moved to take off all of her clothes. Normally, that meant it was time for their current roleplay to turn intimate, but right now she wasn&#39;t thinking about it that way. It would just be silly for a stuffed animal to be wearing people clothes, wouldn&#39;t it? Plus, she needed to take them off now while she still had fingers to work with. They were already starting to feel stubby, receding slowly into her palms which were themselves shrinking away into the ends of her forearms, and they bent at weirder and weirder angles as she grabbed each article of clothing and removed it. She wasn&#39;t sure she actually had bones anymore.<br />
<br />
Seeing his girlfriend&#39;s head start to disappear into the neck hole of her shirt, Derek jumped in to help her finish the job. As soon as Sonya was completely naked, he gasped when he saw just how different she looked. She was now maybe three or three and a half feet tall, and most of her body was already covered in patches of light brown &quot;fur&quot;. Her legs now ended in flat stumps instead of feet, and her arms had almost reached the same point. As he was looking her over, her mop of dark curly hair suddenly vanished. In its place, her scalp was now covered in the same fuzzy fabric, with two little rounded ears poking out on top.<br />
<br />
As Sonya got smaller and smaller, Derek figured he could probably pick her up at this point. He reached down and lifted her easily, then sat down on the foot of his bed to inspect her changing form more closely. With all of her internal organs seemingly replaced by fluff at this point, she weighed no more than about 20 pounds, and she was still shrinking at a rapid pace. He turned his girlfriend over in his hands and found the one part of her that still looked partly human: her face, but that was changing now, too. As the fuzz encroached on her head from all directions, her nose popped out into a small piece of black plastic, and her eyes misted over as they were replaced with glassy black marbles. The transformation finished at her mouth, which Derek was expecting to seal up underneath a thin seam of thread, but instead it was replaced with a felt opening that looked more like something you would see on a muppet. Right, Derek realized, he had purposefully specified that she would still be able to speak.<br />
<br />
From the moment Derek laid hands on her and lifted her into the air, Sonya had been swimming in a feeling of bliss. The faux fur tickled just a little as it spread from one patch of her skin to the next, but that sensation was nothing compared to the sense of love and warmth that flowed through her body from the lightest touch of her boyfriend&#39;s body against hers. It was especially thrilling to feel him squeeze parts of her, even slightly, because she could feel how little substance was inside her when he did. She was just full of fluffy cotton now, and it felt incredible.<br />
<br />
She was snapped out of that bliss when she noticed a slight look of concern on Derek&#39;s face, now looking enormous and staring down at her. &quot;Sonya?&quot;, he asked. &quot;You&#39;re still in there, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes!&quot;, she quickly responded. &quot;Hey, great, I can still talk! Sorry, I was just enjoying how this feels for a minute there. You&#39;ve got to try this sometime!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, good. I was just worried that I might have accidentally turned you into an inanimate object.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am an inanimate object!&quot; Sonya shot back, playfully. &quot;Just without the scary part where I don&#39;t have any autonomy anymore. But look, there&#39;s not an ounce of living flesh left on me! You could cut me open right now and all you would find would be stuffing!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, yeah, I guess I could,&quot; Derek replied. &quot;But you don&#39;t need to worry about that. I&#39;ve always taken good care of my toys.&quot;<br />
<br />
That sentence excited Sonya more than anything. She was just a toy now, but she was Derek&#39;s toy. The two of them had fantasized about something like this for years, but now they had the power to make it a reality. But the memory of those roleplay sessions confused her a little bit. When they acted out the scenario of Sonya being Derek&#39;s little teddy bear, it had always carried an erotic thrill for her. But right now, that idea seemed totally alien. It was still exciting, but it brought her a warmer, softer feeling of excitement: a feeling of love, but not the arousal that normally came with it. Off to the side, she could see a pile of stuffed animals, all of which were clearly about the same size as her now. Of course she wasn&#39;t getting turned on by this, Sonya thought. She was just one of them now, an innocent children&#39;s plaything, whose only purpose was to bring love and joy to her owner and receive the same in return. Plus, she no longer had any genitals.<br />
<br />
Cautiously, Sonya tested out her limbs. Wriggling out of Derek&#39;s grasp, she stood firmly on his lap, her head still just below the level of his chin. As soft as they were, her legs were sturdy enough to hold her up, considering how little weight they had to carry. Like any good TF enthusiast, she brought her hands in front of her face to see how they had changed, and was quickly reminded that she no longer had hands. Her arms ended in stumps, the ends of which were one of the few parts of her fabric body that weren&#39;t covered in furry fuzz. As she turned those stumps towards herself, she could see that each one had the outline of a pawprint stitched into it.<br />
<br />
Derek watched his plushie girlfriend as she looked herself over in his lap, still a bit nervous that she might not be enjoying this experience as much as he was (she didn&#39;t seem to notice his rock-hard erection that sat wedged immediately below where she was standing). Granted, if he was in the same situation - *when* he was in the same situation, since it was bound to happen before too long - he would probably be just as bewildered and curious as she seemed to be right now. But he still wanted her enthusiastic consent, emphasis on &quot;enthusiastic&quot;, before he tried to do anything else.<br />
<br />
Sonya noticed Derek&#39;s look of trepidation again. She seemed to have a keen sense now of the slightest changes in her boyfriend/owner&#39;s facial expression, which she guessed was probably part of her new job as emotional sounding board. She smiled widely, leapt up, and gave Derek a big hug, although her arms could barely reach the sides of his chest now. &quot;I love this!&quot;, she shouted as she felt his huge hands wrap around her back to reciprocate the favor.<br />
<br />
That was exactly what Derek wanted to hear. He peered over Sonya&#39;s fuzzy back and noticed something he hadn&#39;t before. There was a little tag sticking out of the teddy bear&#39;s rear end. Most of it was taken up by the image of a red heart, with tiny letters above that reading &quot;SONYA™&quot;. Underneath the heart were even smaller letters which said &quot;Owner: ______&quot;, with space for a child to write their own name. But right before his eyes, he could see a few lines of black ink form right there in that space. After a moment, Derek could see that they had formed his name, in a perfect copy of his own messy childhood handwriting.<br />
<br />
So, the first try was a complete success. And just as soon as that thought occurred to him, Derek was hunting through past roleplay sessions in his head again. What should they do now?</p>
