<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lina pressed a button labeled &quot;Elvish Elderflower&quot; in a fancy, fantastical script. The machine whirred and rumbled before muffled clanging sounds could be heard within the machine. The girls&#39; eyes followed the path of sounds around unconsciously as the incoming drink seemed to be moved inside. Finally, with a final clattering and clinking, a green bottle slid down into the vertical delivery slot.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooh!&quot; said Lina excitedly, as she picked up the cold bottle, holding the frosty green glass up to the light. It seemed like something from a bygone era, glass molded artfully in a beautiful style, the raised ridges of what appeared to be leafy, flowery vines wrapping around it. Unlike most sodas she&#39;d ever had, Lina noted that this one&#39;s top was a cork with red wax sealing it off. &quot;Elvish Elderflower&quot; was engraved in the middle, in the same style as was seen on the vending machine button.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow&quot; muttered Amy, also entranced by the bottle. &quot;All that for a buck twenty-five?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Guess so&quot; replied her friend, grunting slightly as she gripped the wax covering the stopper with one hand and twisted.<br />
<br />
The wax cracked cleanly and the cork began to twist. Lina worked at it carefully, not wanting to send the thing shooting off through the store. With a hiss that both girls would have found themselves describing as &quot;elegant&quot;, the cork popped off. A pleasant bubbling sound emanated from within the bottle, a slight haze of vapor floated around the rim.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well&quot; said Lina, lifting it towards Amy in a mock-cheers gesture, &quot;bottoms up!&quot;<br />
<br />
The college girl lifted it to her lips and took a sip, which quickly became gulps as she savored the sweet, lightly floral concoction. She reluctantly pulled it away from her mouth after a few more swigs, exhaling in a satisfied way as she caught her breath. She stared at the bottle in her hand, a small smile playing about her lips, her friend all but forgotten next to her.<br />
<br />
Amy opened her mouth, intending to ask how the was when she froze.<br />
<br />
She stared at Lina, mouth still agape watching the girl&#39;s honey blonde hair begin to slide down from its mid-neck length to brush her shoulders. <br />
<br />
Ignorant to her dumbstruck friend next to her, Lina took another few sips of the effervescent draught. Her body tingled and shivered with a buzz that flowed through her skin, up to her scalp. Her blonde hair crept down further past her shoulders, the color leeching from it as the drink&#39;s magic spread throughout her form. <br />
<br />
&quot;Goodness, what a rush!&quot; she cried as she gulped down more of the mysterious soda.<br />
<br />
With a shudder, she felt a floating sensation, her bones groaning as her legs started to stretch and lengthen. Her stretching shins strained against her white calf socks as they grew. Her 5&#39; even body gracefully crept higher and higher as her ears started to elongate at the tip, becoming a bit more pronounced as they poked from her whitening locks. <br />
<br />
Her cheeks, rounded with youth, became thinner. Her cheekbones moved higher, her face gaining a sharper, more statuesque look. Her eyes were closed in ecstasy as she drank.<br />
<br />
Her legs continued to lengthen as her grey pleated skirt, once a somewhat modest garment that came to her knees, slid higher up her slender thighs.<br />
<br />
Her breasts, already a B-cup, swelled and firmed slightly against her white button-up shirt as her torso began to stretch in kind. Her midriff soon came into view as her shirt&#39;s hem tugged out from her skirt&#39;s waistband. Her core was visibly more toned, slim muscles sliding into existence along her stretching form.<br />
<br />
Lina&#39;s waist cinched in with each passing moment, giving her a more slender figure. Her ass expanded slightly, firming up with muscle covered by a thin layer of fat to smooth it out. Her pure white hair swayed loosely and flowed down her back, already halfway to her waist. Her ears had continued to stretch, their sharp tips sticking inches out from her new locks.<br />
<br />
Amy&#39;s eyes flicked to Lina&#39;s throat as her friend continued to gracefully gulp from the bottle. A small popping sound occurred as Lina&#39;s neck began to elongate inch by inch, matching the rest of her slenderizing form. Now around 6&#39; tall, she didn&#39;t show signs of stopping.<br />
<br />
Lina finally finished her drink, pulling away the bottle to look at it. As she did so, she noticed her fingers begin to lengthen daintily outward. At least, most of them did. Her pinky fingers began to shorten, sliding up the sides of her hands before disappearing entirely. Her remaining fingers popped and shifted position, filling out evenly in the space her retreating pinky had left behind. Her forearms stretched as well and as she glanced at them, she could see her slight muscles flexing, staying slender but incredibly firm, like steel cable. <br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa, Amy! Check this out! What is happening to me?&quot; Lina cried. Her voice sounded equal parts ethereal and regal now. While the rest of her had expanded almost simultaneously, her feet had remained unchanged in her loafers. Until now, that was, as pops and aches began to spring up in them, the leather looking visibly tighter as both girls watched. Lina held on until the pain was unbearable, awkwardly trying to kick them off. Her left shoe went flying, exposing a sock that was straining to stay together on a lengthening slender foot.<br />
<br />
She went to try and kick off her right shoe but it was too late, and with a tearing sound, her shoe was shoved forward as stitching broke, her heel shooting out back from it. The tattered looking shoe dangled on her toes for a moment before tumbling to the floor. An equally strained sock came into view, quickly tearing at the front as her soles expanded again. Slender toes shot out, and much like her hands, the pinky began to wither away as the remaining digits repositioned themselves.<br />
<br />
She put her longer feet down feeling the cold store floor beneath the exposed toes of her right foot. The aching sprang up once again, and she felt her arches tighten and creak as her slender, four-toed feet angled upward and grew another couple of inches. Her left sock strained dangerously but held together for the moment while her right foot slid further out from the remnants of its own garment.<br />
<br />
Amy turned to look at her friend as she stretched up, tendons in her soles and muscles in her calves straining and locking, holding her feet in an arched position that felt surprisingly comfortable. Her head now reached beyond the vending machine, standing almost level with the top of the nearest shelf. She had to be past 6&#39;6&quot; now, if not 7&#39;, her form quite long and incredibly slender. Her skirt had become a micro version of itself, barely maintaining modesty as her long slender thighs were mostly visible now, its hem sitting right along the bottom of her ass. <br />
<br />
Her straining shirt revealed many inches of pale, toned midriff with a thin waist and her chest settled at a perky C-cup, straining her bra. Her ivory hair finished falling around her rear while her ears now extended six full inches from her face. Her eyes had changed too, their dark blue color had become an unearthly vibrant teal with a deep, shining quality to them, their irises and pupils expanding to fill her sclera almost entirely.<br />
<br />
Lina&#39;s face was classically beautiful, if even slightly otherworldly. Her skin was pale but perfectly unblemished with an almost astral glitter about it. She twisted her unnaturally long neck in an unconsciously graceful fashion, looking down at her shocked friend. Amy glanced up and down Lina&#39;s muscled yet slender form for another few seconds before remembering to close her mouth.<br />
<br />
Neither was sure what to say, but after a moment, Amy broke the silence.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit, I think you&#39;re an elf now Lina,&quot; Amy whispered in awe.</p>
