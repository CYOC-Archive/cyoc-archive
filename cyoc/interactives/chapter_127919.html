<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Gloria loved the idea of being able to fly around with a passion. She looked at the notice informing her of the nanites. It said: “If operations are normal, you will feel another warmth internally as the nanites switch to active mode to receive instruction. Do not panic, this is normal and will subside momentarily.” A few mintues passed when Gloria started to feel the warmth of the nanites. A message appeared on the screen. &quot;Nanites are fully functional. Standard form found.&quot; Gloria looked at the screen to find dropboxes with her body measurements in them. <br />
<br />
STANDARD FORM:<br />
<br />
Sex: Female<br />
Age: 31<br />
Breast Size: 32CC<br />
Hair:Black<br />
Eyes:Ice Blue<br />
Height: 5 Feet, Seven Inches<br />
Weight: 135<br />
Muscle Density: Low-Moderate<br />
Race: Caucasian-Hispanic mix<br />
<br />
She confirmed that the info was correct and moved onto the next options. <br />
<br />
TRANSFORM TO:<br />
<br />
SPECIES: She first put down bird but then wondered if she could be a harpy. She typed it in to find to find that she was able too. Excitement filled Gloria as she felt her panties dampen in anticipation.<br />
<br />
FEATHER COLOR: Gloria thought long and hard and settled on red feathers. She also chose the option to have her hair become feathers as well. She wanted a light amount to keep cool but still fly.<br />
<br />
EYE COLOR: A color wheel popped up which she spun around looking for an eye color. She settled on yellow to fit her bird theme.<br />
<br />
TRANSFORMED HEIGHT: This option surprised her. She didn&#39;t think she would be able to change that or people would want to change it. She lowered her height down to 4 foot 8 inches to cut down on wind resistance.<br />
<br />
 TRANSFORMED WEIGHT: She put this down to 90 pounds. She never thought she was heavy but she knew she needed to be lighter to achieve flight.<br />
<br />
BREAST SIZE: She thought long and hard about this option. Should she sacrifice some speed to increase her bust? Of course she would. She bumped her bust up to 40DD. It was a sacrifice she was well ready to make.<br />
<br />
KEEP TORSO/HIP/LEG/ARM RATIO CONSISTENT WITH STANDARD MEASUREMENTS?: She clicked yes wanting to at least be able to hook up with anyone if she wanted too.<br />
<br />
PLEASURE-PAIN RATIO: There was two sliders. One for pain and the other for pleasure. She wanted a good experience so she slid pleasure up to 100 percent and pain to zero. Maybe she&#39;d try it later.<br />
<br />
GENITAL SENSITIVITY: She wondered if this applied only during the change, or only after the transformation in her harpy form, or some combination of the two. “Only one way to find out,” she said to herself quietly. It didn&#39;t take a genius to figure out what the popular options were, as the lowest setting was “dulled”, then “normal” all the way up to “ultra-heightened”. Gloria quickly set it all the way up to &quot;Ultra-Heightened&quot;<br />
<br />
TRANSFORMATION ONSET CAUSED BY: This was another drop-down menu, featuring a wide array of options, from app-activation (presumably meaning using the phone to authorize it), to penetration, to stimulation, to beverage (specify) or light levels, or even “spoken word(s)” (self) and “spoken word(s)” (outside party). Just seeing all the different ways she could make herself transform kept her juices flowing. She couldn&#39;t help but rub the heel of her hand against the crotch of her jeans as her arousal surged along with her imagination. She chose to change with a set of spoken words. A microphone symbol appeared on screen. She recorded the words &quot;Birds of Prey&quot; to change into her harpy form.<br />
<br />
DURATION IN TRANSFORMED SHAPE BEFORE REVERSION: She had the option of setting a number of minutes, or she could leave it at “until reversion triggered” or even “both”. She decided to set it to “until reversion triggered”. She wasn&#39;t sure what she might feel like doing after she&#39;d changed, but she figured she&#39;d play it safe. She could always alter things the second time around.<br />
<br />
REVERSION TO STANDARD SHAPE TRIGGERED BY: It was an identical menu to the “onset caused by” option she&#39;d encountered earlier. She set the reversal words to &quot;Return to form.&quot;<br />
<br />
WINGSPAN: She set her wings to be 4 feet long on each side so make her flights easier... hopefully.<br />
<br />
HANDS: There was only two options, &quot;Talons&quot; and &quot;Hands&quot;. It showed a picture of a hand, three fingers were talons and there was one large finger like appendage marking the end of the wingspan. She selected &quot;Talons&quot; and moved down the list. <br />
<br />
ENABLE EGG LAYING?: This option truly stumped her. It had three options. &quot;Disable&quot;, &quot;Trigger&quot;, and &quot;Occasional&quot;. She selected &quot;Trigger&quot; and it gave her another drop down menu. It gave to triggers &quot;Vocal&quot; and &quot;Mental&quot; which she chose &quot;Vocal&quot; and made the trigger words &quot;Eggcellent&quot; putting emphasis on the egg.<br />
<br />
Satisfied with her selection, she hit confirm. One last message appeared on her screen. &quot;Please wait for warmth to signal that nanites are ready.&quot;<br />
which happened shortly after she closed the message.<br />
<br />
She stood up and removed her clothes including her insanely soaked panties. She set up her phone to record the transformation and stood in front of the full length mirror. &quot;You don&#39;t mess with Birds of Prey!&quot; Gloria exclaimed, starting the Transformation. Her blue eyes got bigger and turned yellow as her eyesight improved. The mirror seemed to get bigger as she shrank down to her set height. Waves of pleasure surged through Gloria sending her juices onto the floor. She slimmed down, losing fat from places she wouldn&#39;t have thought to get rid of. The pleasure suddenly went to her breasts which steadily increased in size. She groped them with her hands before they disappeared, moaning out in ecstasy due to the heightened sensitivity.  Her arms and legs started slimming down almost to the bone. Her arms got longer from the elbow to make up her wingspan. Her pinky and ring finger merged together marking the end of her wingspan. Her last three fingers started turning yellow and hardening. The nails turned black grew out sharper and sharper into talons. She bent her hands to touch her hands together to touch her talons. They were sharp enough to draw blood.  Red tuffs started appearing all over her body. They grew longer turning into beautiful red feathers. Some grew over her woman hood but they were easily partable but her bust was left uncovered letting her boobs hang loose. The red feather cover her hair, it was looser that the the feathers on her body. The feathers continued down her arms and made her wings. She started flapping them and she lifted off the ground. She landed to finish of the transformation. Her toes started enlarge on her foot. One disappeared and one moved to the back of her foot. Her foot turned yellow and harden turning into talons as well. Gloria stood there admiring herself. &quot;Beautiful.&quot; She said to herself. <br />
<br />
She went and sat on the bed and gulped. &quot;Eggcelent&quot; she said. Suddenly, as if she ate so much, her belly started growing in size. A round object formed in side her and started moving down. Her breath started getting hitched. She felt the pressure of the egg pushing against her exit. She started pushing, her juices started lubricating the egg as it started slipping faster. After a while, she pushed out a huge egg, it wouldn&#39;t hatch into a baby harpy unless someone fertilized her before he made an egg. &quot;That was... Amazing!&quot; she said, laying down on the bed taking a nap.</p>
