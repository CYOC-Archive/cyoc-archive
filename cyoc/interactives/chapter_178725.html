<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Damon couldn&#39;t believe the spell was actually working and didn&#39;t have the faintest clue what to do about it. Could he go back to the witch and apologize? What if she did something worse to him? What if he finished turning into an animal before he got there? At least his large, sensitive, mobile ears did a good job of reassuring him that there was no one else around who would catch him in this unsettling state. Damon could scan his entire surroundings for distant sounds without turning his head! He hoped he wasn&#39;t going to have his new inhuman ability long enough to get used to it. He didn&#39;t want anybody to see him like this.<br />
<br />
While Damon was still standing there with his mind and recently changed body on edge, he felt an odd swelling and sculpting feeling in his genitals. He gasped and brayed again. His felt his long ears pivot around to point themselves back behind his head like similar ears might on a nervous beast. The bulge he saw in his pants was not comforting. His pants were getting painfully tight again, and he didn&#39;t want to wait for them to rip again to see what was going on down there. He unbuttoned them and slid them down, managing to wiggle out of them with some effort. It actually felt kind of good to swish his new tail around a bit more freely now that it was out of his pants and out of the awkward tear that it had been sticking out of. His heart sank deep, though, when he saw what was now dangling into the free air in front of his crotch. It was a thick, broad, dark, flat-ended tube with an unnaturally large scrotum underneath it--certainly nothing human! He let out an anguished, moaning bray again before aiming his ears around some more to make sure no one outside heard him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe I should caHAAWWall someone,&quot; he said to himself. &quot;This can&#39;t be happening.&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking back at himself in the mirror, he was shocked to see what had become of his head hair. It looked like a brown mohawk! He brushed his right hand through it at the top of his head where it poked up from between his donkey ears. His other hand followed it down his neck where the same long hairs were sticking almost straight out behind him.<br />
<br />
&quot;A mane...&quot; he said out loud with astonishment in his voice. He swished his tail again on impulse, glimpsing the same shade of dark brown hair on his tassel as it peaked out from behind his torso. He flattened his ears again and ran out of the room, thinking desperately how any of things in his house he could see around him might help him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t! I can&#39;t be a donkey! I can&#39;t be a dAAAWWnk-hEEE! I ca-AWWWW HEEE HAWWWW! HEEE HAAWWW!&quot;<br />
<br />
Damon was still running around aimlessly and braying when his wrists barreled out and his fingers and nails fused. Seeing those equine front legs flailing up and down in front of him really drove the point home that the witch&#39;s curse was about to run its course. He banged his dull gray hoof on the dining room table, desperate to feel his hands grab something, desperate to do anything! Robbing that old woman was supposed to give him a quick payday with his buddies! It wasn&#39;t supposed to leave him like this! Feeling himself bulk up and seeing brown fur sprout all the way down his abdomen was the last thing he needed right now, but he was helpless to stop it.<br />
<br />
He lost his balance and had to put those new front legs to use when his feet stretched out like his hands did. He wobbled around a bit and steadied himself, rapidly accustoming himself to a new stance with his whole body balancing on his fingernails and toenails. He reared up trying to get himself back up in an upright position, but it was too late. He did nothing but bang his head on the ceiling because he&#39;d grown bigger. At least this next-to-last change had given Damon a new way to vent his frustration: he soon found himself leaning forward and kicking his hind legs back into the free air, listening to his new hooves cracking into the walls and clopping back down onto the floor, over and over again. He was terrified and wished he could bring himself to stop, but he was too panicked to think straight! He did manage to turn himself around, but then he kicked the table and heard it break against the wall. He kept on bucking for another minute or so, just letting it all out, thinking he was never going to be human again anyway. At least he could savor the power of his big donkey body while raging against the helplessness of his farm animal fate!<br />
<br />
Damon finally wound down a bit, heart pounding, as something like dizziness made him bring his four hooves back down onto solid ground. His vision was twisting around him, losing color and clarity as his eyes changed and got pushed to the side by his long furry muzzle growing in. His whole jaw structure was cracking and shifting as the changes reached their completion. Damon stepped out of the ruins of the kitchen, one hoof at a time, exhausted, not wanting to see the results of his outburst, and milled around the living room for a while waiting for whatever would happen to him.</p>
