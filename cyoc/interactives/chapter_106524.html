<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Joe orgasmed and was still stroking when Devon called him, &quot;Joe, are you in here?&quot;<br />
<br />
Joe snapped out of the hold he was under and for the first time all day he felt like his old self mentally. The edginess and urge to pummel Devon was gone. There was no mindless &quot;bro speak&quot; going on in his head. Joe grabbed toilet paper and began to wipe his dick down. <br />
<br />
As he was doing this Joe began to cry, &quot;Devon, I don&#39;t know whats going on with me.&quot; The closest way to describe Joe&#39;s feelings would be picking up the house after a fight where things got thrown around and broken. &quot;I don&#39;t recognize myself in the mirror, I don&#39;t recognize my voice, I don&#39;t even recognize my own feelings or thoughts half the time.&quot;<br />
<br />
With each wipe waves of  pleasure or discomfort would shoot through him beginning to make him want to jack off again, but this only upset him more as it just underscored how out of control he was. Disgusted with himself he pulled up his pants.<br />
<br />
Devon heard Joe and for the first time in, what he thought was years but was really yesterday, he detected sincerity and his heart melted. &quot;Joe, I know its been a while since we were close, but we can figure this out together.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joe came out of the stall and began washing his hands trying to pull himself together he looked at himself in the mirror and seemed to have gained more muscle and body hair. He turned to Devon in renewed despair, &quot;You see this right? I could practically pass for a college student now where this morning I could pass for a senior. You see it, don&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Devon didn&#39;t see it, Joe was always one of the biggest guys in the school and had been rivaling the seniors in maturity since 7th grade, there was even a DCFS investigation on it. But he did see that Joe completely believed what he was saying. The exquisite mix of horror and desperation painted on his face could not be faked. Devon didn&#39;t know how to answer but being the thoughtful, sensitive, caring young man he was, he managed to spit out, &quot;I don&#39;t see what you are seeing but we can figure this out together, you aren&#39;t alone, we can go to the counselor or nurse right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joe was moved, that was Devon, always willing to grab a shovel and help dig you out of a mess. But the reality of the situation was there too, if everyone else&#39;s reality is changing at the same time his body is changing, nobody but him will ever know what is going on, even a video recording wouldn&#39;t help as the only changes he has left appear to be mental.<br />
<br />
Joe reached out both his hands and grabbed Devon&#39;s face, his hands still dripping wet. &quot;I need you to hear me Devon. You are a wonderful friend and I appreciate you. Who I am, is dying, I can feel it, and nobody will believe me. Thank you for being there for me today, and I&#39;m so sorry if I&#39;m an ass to you ever in the future.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then Joe pulled Devon into a giant hug and cried for several minutes. During that time, neither Joe nor Devon realized that Joe&#39;s hands weren&#39;t clean, and Devon was much to polite to comment on Joe&#39;s body odor issue, so he just endured it.<br />
<br />
When Joe had finally settled down he stepped back feeling emotionally empty. Little did he realize that this whole ordeal was his body purging his weak emotions for good. Now Joe had much more room to fill his head with excitement for sports, lust, nutrition and workout regimens, plans for going pro and countless other minutia. Devon watched as Joe&#39;s eyes went distant as a final tear streamed down his face.<br />
<br />
Devon silently waited a moment, painfully realizing that it had been about 15 minutes since they left class. Just as he was about to ask Joe how he is doing when Joe snapped out of it.<br />
<br />
&quot;What was I saying? Oh Yeah...&quot; Joe said beginning to wash his hands again, this time fully. &quot;So there are three simple things you gotta put into your workout plan. I know, it sounds too simple, but believe me, without any one of them you will fail.&quot; Joe grabbed a paper towel and dried his hands. &quot;You gotta work out, obviously. You gotta eat like you never had a meal before, though its gotta be healthy shit, not all sugar.&quot; Joe walked over to the door. &quot;And lastly you gotta sleep, or your body will tear itself apart and not have a chance to put itself back together.&quot; As Joe stepped out of the door he called back, &quot;Love the scruff, bet it drives the ladies crazy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Devon had no idea how to respond seeing that everything that just happened seemed to have not happened as far as Joe was concerned. And what was with the workout tips? And a complement on scruff? Is that some new slang term he doesn&#39;t know?<br />
<br />
Devon decided to check his hair, being buried in someones stinky armpit for several minutes might have messed up his part.</p>
