<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the girls drove towards the retirement home Mika talked of her grandmother. Kumiko Tozawa was the mother of Mika&#39;s father, Hideo Tozawa. Unlike her father Kumiko was an open minded person, accepting of people no matter their race, religion, or sexual orientation. While Kumiko loved her family she diaagreed greatly with her sons view of the world. Hideo had a difficult time growing up as the son of immigrants, his jaded and hateful attitude was born from the hatred he had faced in his life.<br />
<br />
Hideo&#39;s family seemed to have adopted their fathers views. Mika mother,  Reiko, had a similar life to her husband, not trusting anyone that wasn&#39;t Japanese or heterosexual. Shiro on the other hand had warped these views into a truly hateful ideology. Only Mika maintained a loving view of the world, which is why she got along so well with her grandmother.<br />
<br />
As the girls pulled into the retirement home Claudia sighed. &quot;You sure about this,&quot; she asked. Mika nodded as she exited the car. Claudia sighed sadly as she trailed behind her girlfriend.<br />
<br />
The girls signed in and made there way to Kumiko&#39;s room. Entering they could seethe 90 year old Kumiko in bed. The elderly woman lay peacefully under her covers contentedly watching t.v. &quot;Nana,&quot; Mika whislered. &quot;It&#39;s me Mika.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kumiko moved her ancient head and broke into a warm smile. &quot;Mika my angel,&quot; she beamed. &quot;Come, come give your Nana a hug its been too long.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mika and her grandmother entered a tight hig, the elderly woman rubbing the girls back as a tear rolled down her cheek. &quot;Oh angel no tears,&quot; she said warmly wiping Mikas cheek. &quot;Ive been so worried about you ever since Hideo told me what happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mika gaped as she stared at her grandmother. &quot;Dad told you,&quot; she gaped.  Kumiko nodded as she smiled warmly at her granddaughter. &quot;Yes he did,&quot; she said. &quot;I was quite upset when he told me he kicked you out of the house. I love my son but his hateful ways are not what I taught him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mika wiped her eyes as she looked at Kumiko. &quot;So what did you say to him,&quot; she asked. Kumiko smiled a toothy grin. &quot;I told that man he needed to swallow his pride and accept his daughter. No grandchild of mine will be put in the street.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Im still not at home Nana,&quot; she said sadly. &quot;Dad sent Shiro to talk me into going home.&quot; Kumiko sighed sadly as she shook her head. &quot;Oh Shiro,&quot; she moaned. &quot;That boy is so twisted with hate for no reason. He grew up comfortable and his hatred has no reason. I keep telling Hideo he need to sttaighten thw boy out but who would listen to an old woman.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I always listen to you Nana,&quot;<br />
<br />
Kumiko smiled as she ran her ancient fingers through Mika&#39;s shoulder length hair. &quot;Oh Mika I&#39;m so sorry you have to go through this. If I wasnt so old and ill I&#39;d take you in myself. But enough about me introduce your friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mika turned and waved the others forward. &quot;This is Katie, Kellie and Claudia,&quot; she said. Kumiko smiled before giving Claudia a critical look. &quot;So Claudia,&quot; she said quietly. &quot;I umderstand my granddaughter cares for you deeply.&quot;<br />
<br />
Claudia blushed slightly before answering. &quot;Yes mame,&quot; she said quietly. Kumiko smiled warmly, putting Claudia more at ease.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is a pleasure to finally meet you,&quot; she smiled. &quot;I&#39;ve been looking forward to meeting you since I first heard about your relationship. You care enough to take my granddaughter in when she had no home, for that I thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Ms. Tozawa,&quot;<br />
<br />
Kumiko smiled as she waved a hand. &quot;No child thank you,&quot; she smiled. &quot;Mika has always been a bit of a free spirit. Im just glad she found someone that cares for her as much as I do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Claudia beamed as she placed a hand on her <br />
girlfriends shoulder. Happy to find another person who cared only that Mika and Claudia were happy.<br />
<br />
Katie and Kellie had stood back from the group slightly. Mika had asked that Claudia be introduced to her grandmother before Katie changed her. Mika wanted Claudia to see what kind of woman Kumiko was before she became Mika&#39;s aunt.<br />
<br />
As Kumiko continued to talk with Mika and Claudia, Katie could see Mika turn and nod. This was the signal and Katie obliged making a wish.<br />
<br />
The girls watched as Kumiko grew younger the 90 year old woman seemed to be regaining strength as she youthened. The deep wrinkles in her face began to lessen as her hair went from silver back to grey. As she raced through her 60s and entered her 50s the girls could see brown begining to appear in her hair.<br />
<br />
Fasinated the girls watched as Kumiko continued to regain youth and vitality. The womans face was now mostly unlined as she passed 50 reentering her 40s. Kumiko&#39;s brown tresses began to grow out cascading down her shoulders to the middle of her back. Although Kumiko was a woman of 45 now she appeared to ne about 5 years younger. Still Kumiko continued to youthen.<br />
<br />
Despite some reservations the girls had after what happened with Shiro, they agreed to let Katie work her magic. The girls watched in awe as Kumiko continued to youthen. Now in her late 30s Kumiko possessed chestnut colored hair, a beautiful unlined face, and full perky c cup breasts. The nightgown the elderly woman was wearing appeared tight on her now youthful body.<br />
<br />
Katie completed Kumiko&#39;s regression at 35. The woman was now the younger sister of Mika&#39;s dad. Shaking her head Kumiko looked at her niece and smiled. &quot;Mika hi,&quot; she exclaimed as she hugged her niece. &quot;So glad you came to visit.&quot;<br />
<br />
Memories flooded the girls heads about Kumiko. This place was no longer a retirement home, instead it was a rehab facility for serious injuries. Kumiko had been injured in a car accident several monthes ago. As a result she had been staying here healing from her injuries. Tiday was the day she was being released and Mika was coming to meet her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not a problem Aunt Kumiko,&quot; Mika grinned. &quot;Its just nice to see a friendly face.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kumiko frowned as she looked her niece over. &quot;Im sorry about what happened with you dad,&quot; she said. &quot;Hideo is a bit of a dumbass but I&#39;ve been thinking things over.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you have in mind Kumiko?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kumiko smiled as she looked at her niece. &quot;Well what do you think about living with me,&quot; she asked. &quot;I live in tiwn so you could still go to the stay high school and it&#39;s even close to the Harris&#39;s. What do you say.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mika smiled broadly as she hugged her aunt. &quot;That sounds great Aunt Kumiko,&quot; she said as tears fell freely. &quot;Thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kumiko smiled as she hugged her niece tightly. Mika was overjoyed to finally have a family member accept her. Smiling she was unaware of the sad look on her girlfriends face.</p>
