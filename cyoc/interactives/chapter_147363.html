<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Circe had watched anxiously as all of the grown ups talked about her and Lilith. The now 6year old girl was trying to gain as much information from them as possible as to her current situation. Circe learned that until her and Lilith were able to apologize to one another they would be stuck like this. For a demigod and all powerful witch this was something she could not allow. Hitching up her far too long dress the young girl now tiptoed upstairs while the adults were distracted.<br />
<br />
Standing outside Liliths bedroom the young girl now listened intently. For now Lilith seemed to be quiet, perhaps still upset at being spanked by Kellie. Slowly she now opened the door, peeking inside. “Lilith,” she asked quietly.<br />
<br />
Lilith was sitting on her bed, a glum expression on her young face. The grown down demon queen stared down at the floor, noting her feet could not reach anymore. Lilith&#39;s overly large dress was draped over the girls legs, flowing like a blanket onto the floor. “Go away,” she grumbled.<br />
<br />
Circe slowly stepped inside, quietly closing the door behind her as she now walked towards Lilith. Hopping onto the bed she too was now struck as to how small she was. Circe’s feet didn’t come close to touching the ground from her seated position either as she now sat quietly next to the demon witch. “You okay,” she asked.<br />
<br />
Lilith scoffed as she glumly stared at the wall. “What’s it to you,” she grumbled. “You just came here to make fun of me and be mean. You think I’m a dummy.” Lilith paused sighing in frustration. “That damn hourglass,” she said. “I’m thinking and feeling more like a child by the moment.”<br />
<br />
Circe nodded, she to could feel the affects of the hourglass. Sitting next to Lilith a part of her wanted to leave because she believed the girl to be a “big meanie”. Circe wanted to go play with the stuffed pig doll she had conjured. Shaking her head she now tried to focus, her and Lilith needed to come to an understanding. “Lilith your right,” she said. “I underestimated you. I thought you a fool and it turns out you were far more clever than I anticipated. To use Hikari to gain access to other timelines and destroy another version of me in one of those timelines was something I would not of thought of.”<br />
<br />
Lilith seems to perk up at this compliment, a small smile spreading across her face. “Thank you Circe,” she grinned. “To be honest I was beginning to feel threatened by your presence. Although you followed my lead I could sense you did not agree. Your amusement park made me paranoid, it made me believe that you would try to usurp my position.”<br />
<br />
“I just wanted a place of my own,” Circe said. “Everything we’ve done had always been your way. I was tired of being in your shadow.”<br />
<br />
Lilith paused as she now carefully thought about what Circe was saying. She had not considered how her compatriots would feel about what she was doing. When they had first begun this journey to groom Jack as the balance to Kellies light their focus had been laser like. After several years though, things began to change. While Lilith still wanted Jack to succeed she could only ask two powerful witches to follow her lead for so long before they would wish to assert their individuality. “It wasn’t my intention to make you feel like that,” she said. “Now though we are stuck as children because of that butthead Baba.”<br />
<br />
Circe giggled for two reasons. The adult Lilith would have used far coarser language to describe what Baba had done. Now reduced to a child she was self censoring herself, calling someone a butthead was as harsh a comment she could muster. Circe though was in a similar state. While she recognized Liliths self censoring the childish part of her found calling someone a butthead to be quite funny.<br />
<br />
“She’s a super butthead,” the 6 year old exclaimed.<br />
<br />
Lilith smiled nodding in agreement as the two girls broke into a giggle fit. As it passed they now tried to compose themselves. “I can’t believe she used the hourglass on us,” Lilith stated. “That artifact contains the very first sands of time. An object that powerful is the only thing that could even have any possibility of changing us.”<br />
<br />
“I know,” Circe added. “And Baba worded the spell so that until we apologize we’ll be stuck like this.”<br />
<br />
“I hate saying sorry,” Lilith frowned. Circe nodded, apologizing wasn’t a strong suit of hers either.<br />
<br />
“I hate it too,” Circe said. “But unless we want to stay children were going to have to.” <br />
<br />
Lilith groaned. “If Insaynsorry will the big mean girl go away?” <br />
<br />
“You mean Kellie,” Circe asked, raising an eyebrow. Lilith could only nod as she reached a hand behind her, rubbing the sore spot on her bottom. “Yeah her,” she grumbled. “She’s a big meanie and she made me cry. I don’t like her.”<br />
<br />
“She threatened to spank me too,” Circe said quickly, her eyes going wide as she realized the bullet she had dodged. “She scares me too.” The two grown down witches now began talking in an animated fashion about a mutual enemy. For the two of them and their regressed minds Kellie was the closest thing to the devil either had ever experienced. Kellie not only knew a lot of magic she was willing to actually spank them, something the girls thought was as close to death as possible. As the girls came to an agreement on their mutual dislike for Kellie they smiled. It seemed they might actually be getting along.<br />
<br />
“I don’t think we’ve ever talked like this before Circe,” Lilith said in awe.<br />
<br />
“We haven’t,” Circe agreed with a grin. “I guess we can get along after all.”<br />
<br />
“Let’s not push it,” Lilith said flatly. “For now though I think we can say sorry.”<br />
<br />
“Okay,” Circe said. “I’m sorry I called you a dummy.”<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry I tried to kill you and destroy your animal friends.”<br />
<br />
Lilith and Circe smiled at one another. While they may not be friends they appeared to have come to an understanding and reached a mutual respect for one another. “So how long before we grow back up,” Circe asked. Lilith rubbed her chin thoughtfully. “I’m not sure,” she mused. “Baba is still getting little. We may have to wait for the spell to complete itself before we can get big again.”<br />
<br />
As the two grown down witches now pondered their situation they tried to think of what to do. An impish smile spreading across their faces as they realized if they were going to be children for the first time in their existence they should enjoy themselves.</p>
