<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Tell me about your childhood, your parents, and maybe some memorable siblings you might hold close to you.&quot; Slasher said <br />
<br />
You paused, recalling past memories from your dragon life,&quot;M...My family...&quot; you began, and Slasher gave you a look of concern,&quot;What&#39;s wrong? Your childhood wasn&#39;t dark was it? I can actually relate if you want me to tell my story first Solar.&quot; Slasher said. &quot;No, it&#39;s fine just I don&#39;t like my abusive father, and he hates those who question him. Anyways my childhood was considerably dark, the only siblings I know of are dead for questioning my father. As a child I had many siblings about 203, but I only knew two. My brother Drake, and my sister Scarlet, they always were trying to find a way to evade my father, and sabotage his schemes. My father was like most drakes, kidnaping princesses, devouring royalty, raiding and pillaging villages. My father even got a few villages to swear allegiance to him, but slaughtered them for pleasure anyways. My mother always was laying eggs for our father, and told me that my body, and I would want nothing to lay eggs for a male. I denied my mother, and eventually my father found out about the saboteurs, my brother and sister, and slaughtered them. I watched him burn their corpses from the shadows as he did, and ran away to the woods when I was 798 years old, and lived off of wildlife. I am now 18,647 years old, and when my body started craving for eggs, and sex I knew I had to find a male. I wanted someone who was like me, and disgusted senseless violence, and was fond of humans. However my mind gave into my body, and look where I am now!&quot; You roared,&quot;I don&#39;t hate you Slasher I really don&#39;t, I just want my legacy to have good parents who enjoy life, wether it&#39;s with a human, or not. Anyways I eventually got word my parents were killed by a knight as well as most of my siblings. I have no feelings for my unknown siblings, and I am glad my father is dead, but I envy my mother and hope she doesn&#39;t have the same fate as me now.&quot; You said <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, here&#39;s the thing with my childhood, I understand how you felt, and can compare to a point. Anyways I have an interesting childhood to say the least, my father was the opposite of yours and fought for humans. My father cared about everyone in my family, and actually I&#39;m the oldest, and hatched first out of my mothers first clutch. I always looked up to my father, and he eventually formed a small group, and they eventually found out about a small group of dragons planning to conquer a nearby capital. I heard that his group were going to ambush the dragons and snuck out to watch, but when I arrived I saw my father mortally wounded crippled to an elder dragon who wasn&#39;t harmed. I then saw my father die in front of me, he was my role model, and my entire life up until that point. When I watched my father died I discovered that I had a hidden trait that allowed me to have thicker, and harder scales that were also made me immune to fire. Seeing my father die like he did sent me into a rage, and I murdered the elder dragon by slashing my claw across his neck. I watched as the dragon who killed my father suffocate, and drown on his own blood from his wound. In my family you actually don&#39;t get named until you do something memorable, that&#39;s when my mother gave me the name Slasher seeing me walk home with my claws covered in blood, and my face scarred by murder, and sorrow after I told her everything that happened. She told me of my trait, and I left my family almost unable to live with myself after dropping to the level of that elder dragon. I was actually about to take my own life, until I was visited by a human in this very cave. The human said that they saw the fight, and knew my father very well, and said that if they need my help they would notify me. Actually the only reason I chose you as my mate is because I saw two things in your eyes, first the desperate lust for sex, and second someone else who&#39;s past was as dark as mine. Do you know how your father died exactly?&quot; Slasher asked<br />
<br />
&quot;No just about 2,356 years ago I got word that he was killed, and had been cut across the throat by another being. They also said that he was in a bunch of corpses with 11 other dragons, when they told me this I told them of my fathers cruelty, and said to them that I hope my father burns for everything he has done to my family. I then thanked them telling them that his death was the best news I had ever heard, well, until they also said that my family also died.&quot; You said <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, 11 other dragons, that&#39;s 12 total, and 2,356 years ago too. Did the human say where exactly?&quot; Slasher asked<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know, a canyon of some kind Giants Tomb maybe?&quot; You said <br />
<br />
&quot;Giants Root, is the only canyon with similar name, do you mean that one?&quot; Slasher said giving you a slightly shocked look.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, they also say that it was a battle between him, and another creature, and the creature had overpowered him.&quot; You said <br />
<br />
&quot;2,356 years ago, at Giants Root, 6 dragons ambushed a group of dragons that were planning to take over the capital successfully killing 5, but one by one were eliminated by the final remaining dragon who was an elder dragon with red, and orange scales who also had a scar on his left eye. The elder dragon was then rushed by a mysterious creature who was immune to the fire of the elder dragon, and the creature watched the elder dragon bleed out. The creature roared in triumph, and soon walked away sobbing over something unknown. Does that sound familiar?&quot; Slasher said <br />
<br />
&quot;How did you know? That&#39;s basically a more complex version of what I heard, and the description matches my father perfectly. Wait are you saying that...?&quot; You began <br />
<br />
&quot;Your father is the one who killed mine, and I am the one who killed your father in cold blooded revenge. I am 18,967 years old, and I am the one who killed your father, and you are now the only who carries eggs from your fathers killer. I...won&#39;t force you to like me, nor do I wish for it after what I just told you, but if your father really was that horrible to you I am happy to have been the one to watch him die.&quot; Slasher said, and you suddenly felt a burst of emotions. You then proceeded to hug Slasher with your claws and wings recalling even more memories,&quot;For millenniums I have had nightmares of my father coming back, and killing me for running away from him, and his death silenced those nightmares. Thank you for killing my father, and freeing me from his grip, truly from his grip. I am happy to have you as my mate, and you give me feelings that your courage just then helped solidify our love. I only hope that our kids will learn to protect humanity at all costs, and for our daughters to find mates who will do the same. I owe you a debt that&#39;s larger than my life, so I hope that this will suffice, do what you want to me just be gentle.&quot; You said nuzzling Slasher, and he nuzzled up against your breasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think you owe me anything, but I hope that this doesn&#39;t bother you.&quot; Slasher said nuzzling between your breasts. &quot;Not at all, actually tickles a bit, besides all our hatchlings will be doing that too.&quot; You said. You and Slasher hugged for a bit while longer, until Slasher stood up,&quot;It&#39;s tradition for males to hunt for their mates, and give them water. Please wait here for me to return you&#39;ve given me the chance to relieve myself of all of my pain, and just for you to know that treasure pile was a gift from the humans. I keep it noticeable to conceal myself as a traditional dragon, but the humans know who I am, and they visit, and promised to conceal my identity in context too. I&#39;ll be sure to tell them of you, maybe one or two have noted you in history, or given you a &#39;folk tale&#39;as they call it.&quot; Slasher said before leaving the cave, and you looked down at your stomach knowing what comes next for you.</p>
