<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Joanna followed her mom into the stores. Every step a massive ass cheek moved up and down, her massive unsupported breasts swaying as she went. It was impossible to walk like this. Yet, she knew she&#39;d always done so. It was impossible, yet it felt natural. Her mind was filled with memories of just walking the way she did now. But she just knew this was wrong. This morning she had the Chronivac. As long as she clung to that memory she would know things were wrong.<br />
&quot;Mom, I hope you don&#39;t see this as complaining, but I feel wrong somehow.&quot; <br />
Joanna winced and said &quot;Right, damn it I can&#39;t keep my thoughts to myself.&quot; She ran her tongue over her lips.<br />
He mom just snickered. &quot;That&#39;s okay dear. It&#39;s probably the pent up milk in your breasts.&quot;<br />
She crossed her arms under her aching breasts, providing at least some support. That made sense, but she knew that wasn&#39;t it.<br />
Her ankle length hair fluttered behind her like cape. <br />
<br />
They stepped into the mall. As the parking lot had indicated, it was busy. The place was packed with people going around their business. Walking in and out of the many stores that ran along the walls. Decorative benches were filled with people talking amongst themselves or just taking it easy from presumably a heavy day of shopping. A group of boys immediately turned their attention to Joanna as they passed by. She licked her lips and the boys started whispering.<br />
She flustered, why did she keep licking her lips? She licked her lips. <br />
She was acutely aware of every shake, quiver and movement of her obscene body. <br />
Making their way, her eye caught a store. A large sticker on the window depicted a woman with free flowing luscious hair. The windows behind the sticker were filled with make-up, shampoo&#39;s and conditioners. It was really nothing out of the ordinary, she&#39;d been here lots of times obviously, she knew that store was there. She&#39;d never been in there though, had she? But looking at it now, she was overcome with a new sensation.<br />
She licked her lips and ran a hand through her long hair. &quot;Mom, I need to go to that shop. I want to get some more shampoo for my hair.&quot; There was a tinge of desperateness to her voice. &quot;Did I just say that out loud?&quot; She wondered out loud.<br />
&quot;Sure Joanna, right after we get you your milking machine.&quot; She licked her lips.<br />
Joanna winced. Milking machine, right that was why they were here.<br />
<br />
They entered a store for expecting mothers. The store was much larger than she&#39;d expected it to be..<br />
Mom walked up and addressed one of the sales women. &quot;Excuse me, my daughter here needs a milking machine.&quot; She said, louder than was really necessary.<br />
Joanna felt her face flush red. It was true and yet she felt ashamed at being here. &quot;My breasts really ache.&quot; She complained.<br />
And with that she knew that lactation had only just set in, as was to be expected for someone with breasts as large as hers. She felt her shame subside somewhat.<br />
The saleswoman smiled a tender smile. &quot;Please follow me, the devices are at the back of the store. Let&#39;s go and find you something.&quot;<br />
&quot;I hope you have a large enough one, look at those turgid nipples poking through her clothes.&quot;<br />
&quot;Mom!&quot;<br />
&quot;We have a lot of different sizes and capacities.&quot;<br />
<br />
She followed the clerk to the back of the store. She had to carefully maneuver her massive ass and breasts through the store, careful not to knock anything over. Yet still, her massive cheeks constantly brushed the clothes racks. Sending them swaying as she passed.<br />
&quot;Would you like a seat while I show the models we have?&quot; The friendly woman motioned to two chairs with arm supports.<br />
&quot;Why, I don&#39;t mind if I do.&quot; Her mom said smiling and sat down. She threw a patient look at Joanna.<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think I fit in that chair.&quot; Joanna said, speaking her mind immediately. She licked her lips.<br />
&quot;Oh. I&#39;m sorry. I hadn&#39;t realized that. I think we have some chairs without arm support in the resting area. I can go have a look if you want?&quot;<br />
&quot;No, that will not be necessary. She&#39;s used to having to stand thanks to her fat ass.&quot;<br />
&quot;Mom, you can&#39;t decide that!&quot; Joanna turned to the sales woman. She slowly ran her tongue over her lips seductively and said, &quot;Yes please. If you could check.&quot;<br />
As the store clerk hurried off, mom&#39;s face expression changed. A stern look appeared in her eyes and she pulled up her phone. &quot;Don&#39;t contradict your mother like that, mother knows best.&quot;<br />
That was the only warning Joanna received before she suddenly felt her lips plump up. She licked her new fat lips. They felt much fuller. &quot;Mom, what did you just do to me?&quot; Joanna said, trying to sound as friendly as she could so it couldn&#39;t be seen as complaining.<br />
&quot;Everytime you contradict what I said you&#39;ll find your lips will grow.&quot;<br />
Joanna&#39;s mouth opened to complain. Changed by her mom, she was helpless to resist to speak her mind and she didn&#39;t have a good thing in mind about this.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m back!&quot; The clerk interrupted, carrying a heavy chair without arm rests before her. Joanna was relieved, the sales woman had just saved her from another reality change. At least now she knew for certain her lips weren&#39;t supposed to be like this. She licked her lips.<br />
<br />
She pulled her hair to the side and slowly backed her massive ass onto the seat. It didn&#39;t fit obviously. She knew from her probably false memories. She could feel the seat slip between the massive orbs that were her ass cheeks. But it should be okay for the short time they needed to be here. As long as the chair could hold her weight that is. <br />
Joanna crossed her legs, propped up her breasts and slowly ran her tongue over her plumped up lips.</p>
