<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">He stood on the edge of the street. He frowned at his conundrum. He glanced down at his pants.<br />
<br />
“No wonder it’s difficult to think about this,” he mumbled to himself. He grabbed his pants and pulled them down. Stepping out of them, he tossed them to the side. “There, much better. It’s much too hot for wearing those today anyway.” Just then, Paul pulled up to the curb. Jake opened the car door and hopped in, not noticing his pants fading into nothingness.<br />
<br />
“Hey, man,” Paul said. “How’s it going?” Jake looked at Paul. Paul was completely dressed. He wasn’t acting weird at all.<br />
<br />
Deciding to not tell him about the weirdness that happened in his house, Jake just said, “Oh, you know, the usual.”<br />
<br />
“I hear ya,” Paul replied. “Good to go?” Jake nodded, and Paul drove to their school. They sat in the car in silence while Jake stared out the window. Was anything else different in the world?<br />
<br />
They came to a stop at a traffic light. Jake’s eyes widened a little as the pedestrians crossed the road in front of the car. One man carrying an expensive-looking suitcase was wearing only dress pants, dress shoes, and a single necktie. He wasn’t wearing a shirt. Jake glanced at Paul out of the corner of his eye. Paul didn’t even blink at the display in front of him. Behind the shirtless man was a mom with three small children. To Jake’s relief, the kids were completely dressed. Jake absentmindedly rubbed his bare feet on the floorboard of the car. That’s when Jake remembered that even he wasn’t completely dressed anymore. It was right then that he noticed that each of the kids weren’t wearing any shoes.<br />
<br />
The realization filled his mind with dread. So even kids were slowly stripping down? That’s all kinds of wrong. Jake needed to find whoever cursed him so he can change the world back to normal and instead of this messed up one. Ignoring for now the pantless mother, who had an impressive bulge in her boxers, Jake looked over Paul again. If he had incorrectly believed the kids were fully dressed, then wouldn’t he had down the same with Paul? Sure enough, Paul was just like Jake, not wearing any shoes or socks.<br />
<br />
“So even I’m starting to think some of what I’m seeing is completely normal,” Jake thought to himself. He frowned. “But…not wearing any shoes or socks isn’t any different from wearing them, right? Nobody cares if you want to, and nobody says you have to, right? NO, of course not! Going barefoot is not normal!” He flexed his toes. “But why does it feel normal?”<br />
<br />
“You alright?” Paul asked him curiously, breaking Jake’s concentration. “You seem a little out of it.”<br />
<br />
“I’m fine,” Jake replied quickly, perhaps a little too quickly. Paul raised an eyebrow in confusion but let it go when the light changed green. He continued driving towards the school.<br />
<br />
When they reached the parking lot, several people were heading into the building. They were too far away for Jake to see if they were missing any clothes. However, he did spot some articles of clothing strewn all over the place on the ground. He blinked, and somehow, in that time, they disappeared. That was certainly unsettling.<br />
<br />
The second Paul had parked, Jake hopped out of the car. With barely a word of thanks to Paul, Jake took off inside the school. He stopped at his locker and glanced around at the other students. Several students were completely dressed with no missing clothes. Others were like Jake and were missing shoes and socks. Most of the girls didn’t look any different, although some had broader shoulders and thicker arm hair. As for their interactions with each other, that was different. Several guys would walk up to each other, plant a kiss on their buddy’s lips, and lightly caress each other. Some had reached into another guy’s pants and were even fondling each other’s packages.<br />
<br />
“Pants!” Jake thought suddenly. He glanced down at his own bare legs. He had taken off his pants before getting into the car with Paul. How could he have forgotten about that? He looked around again with this new revelation. It was as he feared. Now that he remembered that not wearing pants should not be considered fully dressed, he realized that there was nobody fully dressed. He sighed with dismay. Maybe he should avoid asking Brad out. He shook his head and suddenly remembered that that wasn’t right. He wasn’t gay! He wanted to date Amanda, not Brad. In the normal world he was used to, Jake didn’t even know a Brad. Amanda hadn’t been replaced, had she? He looked over towards where he remembered Amanda’s locker was.<br />
<br />
He frowned slightly. The gorgeous girl he remembered was gone. Standing at Amanda’s locker was a shirtless guy. He had Amanda’s face, but his facial features were more rugged and masculine. He had broad shoulders. Clearly, Amanda hadn’t changed completely, because this guy still had large tits that stuck out from his otherwise muscular chest. This new Amanda was still wearing women’s pants that accentuated his still female lower body. But his bare feet were anything but dainty. They were large and thick. They almost seemed out of place. Amanda looked over towards Jake and smiled softly. Jake couldn’t help but smile in return. Despite wishing he could see Amanda as a girl, he had to admit how incredibly handsome this guy’s smile was. Amanda sauntered over to Jake.<br />
<br />
“Hey there stud,” Amanda’s manly voice said to Jake. He felt a stirring in his crotch. Amanda glanced down, his eyes lighting up when staring at Jake’s growing erection. Jake started to feel proud that he could show off his growing attraction to this guy. “Looks like someone’s eager to play around before class.” Amanda stared at Jake, the nipples on his breasts starting to harden as well. “Mind if I play with you? My name’s Brad. What’s yours?”<br />
<br />
“J-Jake,” he stuttered his reply. His heart was starting to race, and his dick was rock hard. Brad was certainly attractive. A little fun before class couldn’t hurt, right?</p>
