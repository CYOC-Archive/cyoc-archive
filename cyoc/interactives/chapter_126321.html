Month 1<br />
<br />
You might be surprised to find how much had changed in just a month.<br />
<br />
“Hi honey, how was work? Did you pick up enough for dinner?” <br />
<br />
Ben now sporting a softer more feminine face held up a small cooler in his hands, the fact that Ben was a fertility doctor working at a sperm bank has really proved a blessing since the development of their family condition.<br />
<br />
About two weeks ago Amy started getting strong cravings and impulses for semen, she only ever given her husband a blow job once before and didn’t much care for the taste but suddenly she can’t get enough of the stuff, to make matters worse, if she goes without for too long without she blacks out and starts acting strange and won’t snap out of it until she gets some. The last time that happened came to, to find she just sucked off the delivery guy Bobbie, and the time before that Ben came home to find her breast feeding Timmy for some god forsaken reason.<br />
<br />
Like it or not she now ingests semen every day, she started with servicing her hubby in the mornings but after a few days he started to look girly and his juice started to taste wrong then he came home and said he blacked out at work and when he came to he was licking a sample jar clean. Ben now steels samples from work because his cum just doesn’t cut it anymore for ether of them.<br />
<br />
Despite the extreme oddness of it, both Amy and Ben don’t think much of their new diet or the blackout they experience it they do not following it. In fact it now feels perfectly normal to them, and didn’t feel the need to tell others about it.<br />
<br />
Amy walks hand in hand with Ben carrying his cooler back into the house and then he goes to the dining room and she to the kitchen, todays meal is mac’n’cheese, first she serves out a big bowl full for Timmy then she takes out one of the samples in the case and adds it to the rest of the pot and serves out two more bowls being careful not to mix them up.<br />
<br />
“Here you go Timmy, eat up, I know you’re going through big growthspurt” she puts the regular bowl down in front of him. And boy was he going through a growthspurt, her son had shot up a whole foot in a month, he used to be the shortest boy in his class, now he is approaching the tallest one.<br />
<br />
 “How was your day Timmy?” she asked.<br />
<br />
“I’m in a new club!” the kid said excitedly “It’s the kissing club, the girls started it to try kissing boys but none of the boys but me wanted to try because of cuties, I kissed ten whole girls before the tratcher found us and said we weren’t allowed to have a kissing club.”<br />
A warm tingly feeling passes over Amy and Ben at those words. That story might have caused some alarm for the Queens last month but now just sounded cute to them, no idea of the virus their child spread to his classmates and how it was changing their thought proses to help spread it.<br />
<br />
Before you know it dinner was over and it was time to get ready for bed, Timmy has been finding it impossible to stay asleep if he is not in the same bed as someone else so his parents have been going to bed with him every night even if they don’t sleep right away. While brushing her teeth Amy couldn’t help but note that her canines wore longer and sharper than they used to be. <br />
<br />
Later that night the family was in bed, Timmy was out cold, Ben was reading and Amy was propped up with a pillow while fiddling with a breast pump. Her daughter was only a month or so away and the plan was always to storing up milk now to avoid sore nipples later. There was certainly no shortage of white fluid dripping into the jars. She was amazed at how much she had been producing.<br />
<br />
Due to the excess, these milking sessions had become an hourly routine. Sometimes she would even wake up in the middle of the night with a wet shirt and swollen breasts. It was frustrating, but she had other things to be concerned about. She was, however, keeping an eye on two tender spots that had formed under each breast. She wanted to assume it was just a rash, but with each passing week the two spots grew larger. They often echoed the sensitivity of her breasts above. She didn’t think much of it until a feeling of dampness distracted her from the pump.<br />
<br />
She carefully pulled the pump away, expecting a crack in the jar. But the container showed no signs of moisture along the surface. Still feeling wetness, she lifted her right gland to find that one of her mysterious bumps had beads of white fluid forming on the tip. A quick check revealed that the other side had also began to leak. She cursed, tucked a towel into the gap and got her husband’s attention.<br />
<br />
Ben got up and took some time examining her, technically he wasn’t her official doctor but it was good to be married to a pregnancy expert when your pregnant sometimes. “Well honey, it’s rare to have supernumerary nipples develop during pregnancy, but nothing to worry about.” Just to be safe he scheduled a checkup the next day with her official doctor. Fortunately, her blood-work didn’t reveal any cancers or infections. All things considered, she and her baby were perfectly healthy. And, for better or worse, her new nipples were quite functional.<br />
<br />
That was a relief. She was glad to be in good health but still annoyed. What was she going to do with the milk of four lactating nipples when two were already over producing?...  Perhaps donate it to the hospital nursery. A warm tingly feeling passed over Amy at the thought.</p>
