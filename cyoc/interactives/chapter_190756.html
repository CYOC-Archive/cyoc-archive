<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">So you woke up, and it was quite the experience.<br />
<br />
You, Jacob, are now Female House Fly, albeit with various modifications. The first weird sensation was not having actual eyelids and waking up with a much different view point. You feel like you could see almost see entirely around you, with the blind spots caused by your own body.  It was weird not being able to blink and seeing hundreds, possibly thousands of images from your new compound eyes, yet seeing it as one image. You noticed another fly which you took to be Samantha, and you seemed to be in a large room proper to your size and some odd furnishings. You were warned there might be more issues with a Fly&#39;s sight, like colors, focus, and distance, but for now it felt tolerable. Before you took you wanted to take in anything else, and even with your new, almost 360 vision, you decided to go over to a wall mirror. Than you realized you had another issue: moving.<br />
<br />
You were standing, but when you went to moved towards the wall mirror, you skittered halfway before you suddenly realized what you were doing.  You had 6 limbs now, and using all of them on the ground. Using them well. You seemed to naturally know what a &quot;standing position&quot; was. This must&#39;ave been the &quot;Beginner&#39;s Animal Adjustment&quot; in play. You didn&#39;t seem to have the knowledge of how to stand, but you &quot;felt&quot; it. You tried doing something that required more effort from yourself by lifting one of your front legs in front of you, similar to lifting the palm of your hand to your face as a human. It worked as well as it could, considering you think you didn&#39;t have palms as a fly, but it was nice to see your body was fully under your control when it came down to it. There was so much you wanted to test with yourself, but you continued skittering over to the mirror to get a nice view of anything you did.<br />
<br />
Yes, you were a House Fly. Compared to Samantha, who seemed inactive at the moment, you seemed a bit bigger. You remembered that was typical of female flies. It was strange that inside that Grey, black-stribed, sparse-hair ridden exoskeleton was you, Jacob, a sentient human. Even though you were in wonder, you showed no expression of it. You were totally still. You couldn&#39;t tell you were breathing, but with some pre-information from the U.S. Marshals, you could tell it was happening somehow with your new abdomen. Your new eyes further reminded you of your 360, multi-but-one image sight, but they too did nothing to help with expressing yourself. You did the equivalent of trying to smile, grimace, and other silly exaggerated facial expressions in the mirror, but that only caused your proboscis to move a little this way and that. You decided to use one of your fore legs to do the equivalent of a friendly wave, it was alien and limited by your anatomy but felt like you got the idea across to yourself. <br />
<br />
You decided to play more with your proboscis, and boy was that very weird. Even with the Adjustment help, dealing with a part of your face that you could extend and &quot;store&quot; in your head was very odd. You decided to fully extend just to see, and saw you had a little control over its movement, but not much. It wasn&#39;t an Elephant&#39;s level of control and it just flopped for the most part, but you could aim it a bit especially towards the bottom. You had a feel this would come in handy while eating. That last thought reminded you that you could spit a digestive liquid to help eat. You decided to do it now, not to worried about the cleanliness of your area since you are now a Fly, and out a glob came. You half-expected to have a taste from the proboscis, even going so far as to gobbling a little bit of the spit, but it wasn&#39;t too different from your own spit somehow, just something tasteless going down your new digestive system. You were taught you did have taste sensors in the other parts of your body, but you decided to leave that for later when you actually ate.<br />
<br />
Next you you decided to test overall movement. You moved your head as best you could, feeling the different-but-limited movement of turning your head in a circular way. You tested each leg separately then practiced crouching, &quot;stretching&quot; ( you tried making yourself as tall as possible), and various other movements. You even tested your wings, effortlessly hovering in place and adjusting their position when not in use. You were pretty confident in doing movements both natural and unnatural to a fly, and couldn&#39;t wait to literally and metaphorically stretch your wings in more space. <br />
<br />
There were other things you were curious about, like how your inner biology worked now, but you did sense a familiar feeling of &quot;horniness&quot; pop up. Remembering your female anatomy was somewhere in the the back of the abdomen, you got to work of using your hind legs to just started rubbing. You were making some sort of sound in this manner, although you were told your species of Fly did not have actual ears, you were able to interpret this somehow. Deciding to pay attention to that later, you explored further with your hind legs until suddenly you found &quot;pleasure&quot; areas. This you had not explanation for as this was one of the custom modifications, but you kept going and felt like you had the equivalent of having an a female orgasm. <br />
<br />
You watched the whole show in the mirror, it was about as non-eventful as can be other than seeing unnatural leg movements, and the only sign you had an orgasm was when you seemed to be more &quot;still&quot; than normal. Still, the whole event seemed to last a few minutes least with the afterflow lasting longer. You really looked forward to enjoying the rest of this experience.<br />
<br />
You just decided to continue with various experimentation in front of the mirror to pass the time and practice.</p>
