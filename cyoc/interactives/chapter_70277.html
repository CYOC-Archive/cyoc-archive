<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Just as the ‘new’ Alex opened the door he bumped into his friend Josh!  Josh was a lot like Alex used to be <br />
which is why they got a long so well.  He was a short, thin, greasy haired 17 year old always following Alex’s <br />
lead and trying to learn from his friend.  He was a huge nerd and hacker to but he wasn’t as good as Alex.  So <br />
they became friends and Josh learned from Alex while Alex enjoyed the admiration.  <br />
<br />
Josh also shared Alex’s (old) hatred for dumb people.  Especially dumb surfers.  So he was in shock when he <br />
opened the door to find his friend holding a surf board and dressed for the beach.  He looked a bit more <br />
built, tan and his hair was blonde but Josh recognized his friend in there.  And he wasn’t happy at all.  Alex <br />
just stood there looking dumbly at his old friend.<br />
<br />
“Alex what happened to you?!”  He grabbed his friends now broad shoulders and shook him.  “What did they do to <br />
you?  You look like a dumb surfer!”  <br />
<br />
Alex could barely remember this guy.  But he was getting kinda angry at being yelled at and shaken and didn’t <br />
like being called ‘dumb.’  He felt a kind of electricity building in him.  Like a static charge.<br />
<br />
“Dude like fuck off im not dumb, and uh I wanna go to the beach and stuff so move.”<br />
<br />
“Alex come on snap out it you hate surfers remember they’re dumb!  You shouldn’t be dressed like this or <br />
acting like this… remember you like hacking! Please, hack something?”  This guy just will not stop whining and <br />
yelling thought Alex.  I don’t hack stuff.  Alex finally pushed the kid off and as he did a bolt of <br />
electricity shot out from him and into the other boy.  Josh stumbled back and started to feel weird.  He <br />
clasped his head with his hands as he got dizzy and it felt like something was sucking all the intelligence <br />
out of him.  Alex watched with curiosity as Josh stumbled around the room.<br />
<br />
“No, no no!  I don’t wanna be dumb to!”  Josh cried out realizing whatever happened to Alex had spread to him.  <br />
He wanted to run away and escape but part of him was calling him to the mirror.  The surfer part of him really <br />
wanted to watch himself.  He saw his eyes, bright blue and almost retarded looking.  They no longer glowed <br />
with intelligence but they looked a lot hotter part of him argued.  <br />
<br />
“Alex cut it out I don’t wanna join you!”<br />
<br />
“Uh dude youre getting totally awesome!”  Alex had no idea what was going on but he was amazed watching Josh’s <br />
greasy hair get shaggy and blonde as it fell past his shoulders and smelled strongly of salt water.  His ugly <br />
face changed with high cheek bones, a killer smile and a smaller nose.  Some teenage hairs grew in on his lip <br />
and chin.  It still looked like Josh, just a much better version of him.  <br />
<br />
Josh pulled at his clothes as his shirt vanished altogether.  His chest grew like Alex’s but clearly much more <br />
build.  His pecs were tanned to a golden brown and bounced as he moved.  His abs were now a tight 8 pack with <br />
a light blonde happy trail.  Blond hair also filled out in his pits and covered his arms and legs and –that- <br />
area which he happily noted was also growing!  He moaned in a deep, slow and very Cali surfer like voice as it <br />
snaked out to be as long as his friends.  He also dropped a year in age becoming 16 like Alex.  As he <br />
regressed he got shorter.  He was shorter then Alex now but more built and handsome looking.  His stick legs <br />
were now short and thick from hugging the board.  Speaking of his board, his papers that he brought over <br />
turned into a matching well used board for surfing with his best buddy Alex.  His shoes turned into worn out <br />
sandals that shaped around his wide surfer feet and his jeans shrunk into small boardies that revealed his <br />
tanned legs.  <br />
<br />
Standing there shirtless where a nerd once had been was another horny 16 year old surfer.  Slowly he forgot <br />
all about hacking to and just wanted to show off, get high and surf!  He went completely bare chested unlike <br />
Alex to show off his greater definition to potential fuck buddies.  His voice was also deeper and slower.<br />
<br />
“Fuck yeah dude can we like surf now?” asked the new Josh.<br />
<br />
Alex gave a big dumb smile “oh yeah dude lets go surf!”  And the two reunited friends grabbed their boards and <br />
left.</p>
