<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Ew...no way Dad!&quot; David squirmed as his Dad tried to force a kiss onto him. Rob desperately tried to cling onto David's shoulders, but David managed to quickly shove open the car door and roll out onto the grass of his front lawn.<br />
<br />
It must have been some kind of joke, David thought to himself. But then, how could his Dad have changed into a younger, well-built man? David didn't stop to ask, as Rob seemed quite determined to chase after him.<br />
<br />
David sprinted around the back of the house and clambered through his still open window. Then, as fast as he could, he shut and locked the window and lay below the glass, hidden from view.<br />
<br />
&quot;David...&quot; came the soft voice of Rob. &quot;I know you are in there...I can smell you...&quot; A gentle tapping sounded against the window. David bit his lip. This wasn't his father. Something had happened; but David didn't know what. David remembered that the back door was still open. He had to lock it if he wanted to remain safe. David slowly edged towards the side of the room, trying to remain hidden. <br />
&quot;Daviddddddddd...&quot; the voice called. David reached the door of his room. He glanced across at the window and made out the shadow of Rob, still scanning the room for a sign of David. David took a deep breath and dashed for the back door. He was scarcely a foot away when he saw the door handle twisting around. He threw himself forwards, hit the door shut and turned the dead lock on the door on. David could hear Rob beating the door in frustration.<br />
&quot;Come on, just one little Birthday Kiss is all I want!&quot; Rob called angrily.<br />
David didn't answer. What was he going to do?<br />
<br />
He sat down in the corner of the hall way, huddled up, trying to think up a plan. It had been about 10 minutes and Rob hadn't made a sound. He crept towards the front door quietly, hoping to make an escape. He reached for the front door slowly, but before he touched the handle, Rob's voice echoed in from outside. David stopped and peered through the window along side the door.<br />
<br />
Outside, he saw his former father standing in the drive way, wearing the tattered remains of the clothes he had torn away not long ago. There was another man out there, apparently walking his dog which was a large husky. David couldn't make out what they were saying, but after a few seconds, both his father and the stranger turned around and began to walk to the door. The other man was about 25 years old and his short black hair darknened his handsome face. He was wearing a grey track suit and a green singlet below, which could be made out beneath the V of his sweater. He had some black stubble across his chin as if he hadn't shaved for a couple of days. The stranger bent over and pushed open the mail slot in the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't see anything in there...&quot; the man said. David was standing against the wall now, he and Rob gazed at each other for a brief moment. Rob smiled and leant over.<br />
&quot;Are you sure?&quot; Rob asked. Rob's face came closer and closer to the bare skin exposed between the track suit top and bottom. He closed his eyes, as if to savour the moment, and then his tongue lunged out. David closed his eyes momentarily in disgust. The stranger got up, shocked. He tried to speak, to say something, but nothing came out. He ran his hands through his hair and his face turned slightly feverish. His chin stuble faded back into his face, leaving a smooth, hairless face. David watched as the rear of the man's pants burst open in one swift movement, revealing a tight red Speedo. Shaking the man turned and looked over his shoulder at his ass and spotted the Speedo. He didn't know what was going on.<br />
<br />
The muscles along his arm ballooned almost instantaneously. His hair became a shade lighter and his already handsome face became even more good looking. He gripped the sides of his singlet and track suit top and lifted them slowly over his head, as if figuring out what was going on. He tossed them aside and stared at his growing abs. His skin tanned over and his muscles and chest glistened in the sunlight. The man's sneakers tore open down the centre and he kicked those off into a pile with his other clothes. Finally, his hands moved down to his track suit pants and he tore them down the middle around his crotch and let them fall down to his ankles. The Speedo tightened against his raging hard-on and his legs grew thicker and stronger.<br />
<br />
While this was happening, Rob also began to discard his ripped clothing, leaving only his Red Speedo on. Both men were prime specimens, muscular and strong, sporting enormous penises tucked away in their tight Red Speedos. Both chests appeared to be naturally oiled, smooth, hair less and muscular.<br />
<br />
At first Rob simply wrapped his hands around the man's neck and began to kiss him passionately, but then they fell onto the grass and began to roll back and forth, madly licking and caressing each other, forgetting the boy still inside the house. <br />
<br />
David now knew what would happen if his father kissed him. He had to escape somehow...</p>
