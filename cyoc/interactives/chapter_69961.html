<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The car ride to the party, compared to everything they’d been through to that point was relatively uneventful. A few flirtatious glances here and there were all Will needed to do to maintain the illusion that nothing was new. Will was driving so wasn’t truly paying attention to any differences anyway. It was actually rather useful to ask some subtle but probing questions. Things like ‘do you remember when we first met’ and other such things provided a useful pass time and lots of relevant information. Near as the girls could tell there wasn’t that much difference between their reality and this one so acting like normal may be easier than they thought. <br />
<br />
Joe was content to just stare at Sam smiling, which made Sam feel uncomfortable. She didn’t like the attention she was getting, and inwardly she was cursing Will for giving her clothes that not only hugged her tightly, but accentuated the assets she’d rather be hiding at this point. <br />
<br />
Will on the other hand was settling quite comfortably into her new role, which surprised her greatly. He’d have been the first one to suggest banging a girl or making lewd an inappropriate gestures at passing women so this sudden reversal of fortunes should have been really painful, except between the ambitious costume, the afterglow of her female exploration, and the feeling of comfort from being in Mike’s arms, she was starting to think this may not have been the complete nightmare it started off as. Of course she still wanted her manhood back, and she was going to fight for it, but she wasn’t going to go off the deep end about it at the moment.<br />
<br />
The car pulled up out the front of the party, which was already in full swing. Will and Sam both got out as the guys fussed about locking the car and getting booze out of it. Will had been daring enough to try high heel shoes on, but was taking each step quite carefully. Sam on the other hand just wore some pumps. They smiled at passers-by, most of them girls they recognised. Girls were clearly just more social as despite the rather anti-social air of the indie and skater scene, everyone was still smiling and pleased to see them. The music could be heard from out on the street, so it was a wonder the party hadn’t been broken up yet.<br />
<br />
“Come on girls” Mike shouted grabbing Will with the hand that wasn’t cradling beer. She stumbled abit but was soon jogging along to the inside. Joe and Sam followed behind at their own pace, still not saying all that much.<br />
<br />
The lights were low, the music loud, the place already a mess. Mike dumped the six packson the table and joined in a conversation with a group of guys nearby, leaving Will to fend for herself. A few of the guys began to look her up and down, clearly admiring the choice of skirt and bare shoulders. She obviously cared, but there was little she could do about it, so grabbing a can of drink off the table, she found herself a perch by herself and began to spectate.<br />
<br />
“You’re being antisocial again” Mike piped up from behind her after a few songs had passed. “Where are the rest of your rat pack anyway. Are they not coming?”<br />
<br />
Will could only guess he meant the other skaters so she quickly came up with something. “They all came down sick earlier today. They were going to try and come if they felt better later.”<br />
<br />
Mike nodded, clearly buying the lie. “Is that why Sam is looking a bit pale?” He asked gesturing to the other side of the room. Sam was standing against a wall, with Joe trying to talk to her. He wasn’t having much luck as Sam just stood there quietly, nodding an occasional yes and staring into an empty glass.<br />
<br />
“Oh, yeah…” Murmured Will, inwardly cursing Sam for being so pathetic. She looked to mike and shrugged. He smiled back at her before placing his drink on the table.<br />
<br />
“Come on, let’s dance.” He said as he jumped up. Without even thinking Will got up and, smiling a yes walked out onto the floor with him. The beat pumped loudly across the room and Sam looked up to notice Will’s change in attitude.<br />
<br />
Mike began bobbing to the beat and Will began to move slowly, trying to match what she knew. It became easier, perhaps due to the drinks she’d had, but she began to get the hang of it. Dancing in high heels was certainly not easy, so she was content to simply sway her hips with her hands in the air. Mike pulled her closer, grinding against her back, and Will, not even protesting, matched his movements, presenting her ass as his prize. He ran his hand up her thigh, brushing her skirt, and up to her hips, before snaking further up, tracing all of her curves as he went. A part of Will was screaming inside, telling her to stop, that she was a guy, that she was deliberately acting sexy for another guy, but they were drowned out by the music and the alcohol. What was left was two teenagers, dancing and grinding like they were making love on the floor right there. But like most things, it was over way too fast. The music stopped and the two embraced each other. Will was incredibly hot now, and something told her it was not just the atmosphere of the room. <br />
<br />
And then, depending on the point of view you take, the best, or worst thing possible happened. A slow dance came on. Mike didn’t hesitate, and pulled Will forward, staring into her eyes and locking his hips in with hers. Will smiled, forgetting everything now, leaning in and resting her forehead against his. Her arms lay across his shoulders and they both felt the passion of the moment wash over them. Mike’s passion was far more obvious than Will’s, this becoming noticeable not long into their slow waltz around the floor. Their hips, still pressed together, were joined by an extra pressure between them, and Will gasps as she realized what it was. Her body betrayed her, as she felt herself getting aroused. The thought of experiencing another orgasm was intoxicating, but before she dwell on the thought Will dove in. Pulling her tight to his body for a second time that evening, he locked lips with her. They writhed and they kissed, letting it last the whole rest of the song. Will couldn’t stop, though she wanted to. The voice of reason was begging to kick back in but it wasn’t enough to ruin the heat of that moment. The thoughts of all the things she could do to him with this body were overwhelming, and her underwear was suffering for it, but then the voice of reason finally won out.<br />
<br />
The song ended and she broke from him, dashing off the floor and into the corridor. She dashed into the nearest bathroom and locked the door behind her and collapsed onto the toilet, breathing heavily. She gazed down at her cursed body and, still panting, put her head in her hands. Why was she doing this. It surely wasn’t that enjoyable. She was a guy right? She certainly wanted to be, and yet at that moment she’d have given anything to have mike thrusting into her. Were female hormones always this complicated? The one thing she decided on then and there was there was no way she was having sex with anyone until she got her body back. Maybe those two lesbians were here? She never even thought to check. They were soccer team, and despite the Indy group she’d been hanging with the school sports teams were well represented here. Slapping herself and making sure she was thinking straight again she walked out of the stall to see if she could find them.</p>
