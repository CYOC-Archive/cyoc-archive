<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As July was trying to figure out what was going on, her mind immediately went blank and her eyes glazed over while Amanda&#39;s regression was going back to weeks.  The room saw this and knew what it means.  It means that July was about to unbirth her own daughter.<br />
<br />
As Amanda became four weeks old, July&#39;s clothing disappeared and she was completely naked with a kiddie pool filled with water materialized under her feet.  The room could see that July&#39;s hips were filled with flab from giving birth as stretch marks started to appear around her rounding stomach.  It could even notice some tattoos scattered about her body as there is heart stabbed in the knife on her right bicep, a snake slithering up her left arm, a black widow spider crawling between her huge breasts, and on the back is a skeleton with flames in the background and was holding a guitar and sporting the devil horns.  It almost looks like that she was a rebel before she became a mom.<br />
<br />
At three weeks old, Amanda was getting smaller and weaker as the cord petruded out of her belly button and slithered downwards.  But she didn&#39;t notice it at all.  Her eyes were closed while she was still sucking on her mother&#39;s tit.  As for her mother, black circles started to appear around her eyes as she was entering the phase where she had many sleepless nights looking after Amanda at the youngest of ages.<br />
<br />
At two weeks old, July let Amanda go of her nipple as like a zombie, sat down in the kiddie pool placed her newborn in front of her, with her cord growing longer.<br />
<br />
At one week old, July spread her legs apart as the curly pubic hair shrank into her skin, leaving it completely bare like she just shaved it.  Amanda kept growing smaller as her movements were slowing down and the cord snaked through the water.<br />
<br />
Amanda&#39;s regression now tick back to days as the cord kept extending to July&#39;s pussy.<br />
<br />
Six-Days-Old, the cord went into July&#39;s vagina as she started moaning in pleasure.<br />
<br />
Five-Days-Old, the cord went deeper into July&#39;s body until it reached the womb.<br />
<br />
Four-Days-Old, the cord connect and formed a placeta, creating a new home for Amanda.<br />
<br />
Three-Days-Old, Amanda stopped breathing as the cord was pumping nutrients and oxygen into her body.<br />
<br />
Two-Days-Old, Amanda stopped moving and she can only wheeze with her mouth.  But in her mind, she knew that it was time.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is it...&quot; thought Amanda, &quot;I&#39;m going to be inside my mom.  This is going to be quite the journey.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now at One-Day-Old, the cord started to pull Amanda into July as her regression was now ticking back to hours.<br />
<br />
24-Hours<br />
23-Hours<br />
22-Hours<br />
21-Hours<br />
20-Hours<br />
<br />
The cord continued to pull Amanda in as she feel the water around her flowing.<br />
<br />
19-Hours<br />
18-Hours<br />
17-Hours<br />
16-Hours<br />
15-Hours<br />
<br />
As Amanda was getting closer, July&#39;s vagina lips were slowly opening up, growing bigger and wider to let her in.  It&#39;s almost like a monster about ready to swallow her whole.<br />
<br />
14-Hours<br />
13-Hours<br />
12-Hours<br />
11-Hours<br />
10-Hours<br />
<br />
July spread her legs wider, ready to delivery her daughter in reverse.<br />
<br />
9-Hours<br />
8-Hours<br />
7-Hours<br />
6-Hours<br />
5-Hours<br />
<br />
Amanda was now small pudgy and wrinkly as she was immediately covered in her mother&#39;s blood.<br />
<br />
4-Hours<br />
3-Hours<br />
2-Hours<br />
1-Hour<br />
<br />
The cord from Amanda keeps pulling the newborn closer and closer to her mother as she was regressing down to mere minutes.<br />
<br />
55-Minutes<br />
50-Minutes<br />
45-Minutes<br />
40-Minutes<br />
35-Minutes<br />
30-Minutes<br />
<br />
Amanda was already between her July&#39;s legs as her feet were almost reaching her mother&#39;s pussy.<br />
<br />
25-Minutes<br />
20-Minutes<br />
15-Minutes<br />
10-Minutes<br />
5-Minutes<br />
1-Minute<br />
<br />
The room could only watch as Amanda&#39;s life span was now counting back in seconds.  It knew that Amanda will soon enter July and be unbirthed and then will go back to be uncreated erasing another life from existence.  Unless July says stop otherwise, Amanda will join her daughter and there&#39;s no way to reverse it.  By now, Amanda has passed one second of her life as the unbirthing process starts.<br />
<br />
First her feet and legs started to go into July&#39;s vagina as the mother was going through reverse contractions.  July moaned and groaned as she was pulling her daughter into her.  Amanda was moving rather violently as movements were causing her body to dive in deeper, consuming her arms and upper body.  Going up to the neck, the head was last as July was struggling to pull the rest of her daughter in.  Slowly, the head was being devours by her mother&#39;s Pussy lips as the mouth, nose, eyes and ears were slowly sucked in.  Now all that&#39;s left was the top of the head as the reverse crowing occurred.  July was breathing heavily and sweating profusely, knowing she needs to pull one more time to unbirth her daughter.  After one huge scream, the top of the head disappeared and the vagina closed up, making Amanda disappear into her mother completely.<br />
<br />
Inside the mother, Amanda could feel the fleshy walls opening and closing as she goes deeper into her mother&#39;s womb.  With her ears concealed and her eyes forever closed, all she could hear is the muffled sounds of her mom, continuously pulling her in.  After what felt like forever, Amanda finally reached the sack as the hole she came in sealed up completely and liquid was filling up.  Now Amanda became nothing more then an unborn fetus sleeping peacefully and curled up into a ball, letting the mother&#39;s heartbeat soothe her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow...  I am now in my own mom.  So this is what Candy felt after being into me.  I never knew if felt soon, calm.  So relaxing...  So peaceful...&quot; she said as fatigue was starting to take over.<br />
<br />
On instinct she guided her tiny thumb into her mouth and begin to suck on it.  &quot;Soon I will be nothing more then a sperm and egg and then I&#39;ll be no more.  I know that I will join Candy into complete nothingness, but no matter what, it will be worth it.&quot;  She soon dozed off into a deep sleep, ready to take the final step into non-existence.<br />
<br />
Back outside, the room watched as Amanda is officially unborn.  Now July was laying on the floor with an extremely pregnant stomach as the kiddie pool disappeared and she was wearing nothing but an extra large T-Shirt with a Black Sabbath name and logo on the front.  Looking at the clock, the room could see that both timers were slowly ticking down.  On July&#39;s life span, she is already 20 years old and 2 months, as her 20th birthday was fast approaching.  And below it, Amanda&#39;s name was erased and replaced with unborn fetus as she didn&#39;t have a name yet.  The timer is only on 9-months as the days and weeks were ticking back by seconds and minutes.  Which means it will be a matter of time before Amanda is uncreated and then wiped out of existence entirely.  So it tried to reason with her.<br />
<br />
&quot;July, your baby is now in you and is still regressing back to nothing.  If you wish to stop, now would be the time to say it before she cease existing.&quot;<br />
<br />
It waited for a response and didn&#39;t hear anything from her.<br />
<br />
&quot;July?&quot;<br />
<br />
Still nothing.  As it turned out, she was snoring up a storm.  Turns out, as she was pregnant, she was a heavy sleeper, and the more fatter she gets, the more tired she got.  And at nine months, she&#39;s the lazy version of Sleeping Beauty.  The door already looked at the timer and could see that 8 months pregnant and July was one month away from her 20th Birthday.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh dear...  This is not good.&quot;<br />
<br />
The room hopes that July wakes up and stops the changes.  Cause if she doesn&#39;t, then another person will be lost in the AR Door.</p>
