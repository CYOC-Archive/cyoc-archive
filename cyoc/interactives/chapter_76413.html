<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The old shopkeeper observed the new arrival carefully. He seemed to be college aged lad, probably a Sophomore or a Junior, judging by his youthful face and collegiate stamped apparel. A perfect mark, as the old man's previous experiences with the game had shown. Old and mature enough to exploit the game's dramatic changes, yet stupid enough to actually play in the first place. The old man could barely contain his glee as he rose from his ragged stool to greet the newcomer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome, son, to my shop!&quot; he began, &quot;What can I do for ya?&quot;<br />
<br />
The auburn haired youth glanced around briefly before actually responding.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, I'm looking for something I can do with my sisters. The parents are out of town and they've made me promise to keep them outta trouble, so I figured I could find a board game or something to keep 'em distracted.&quot;<br />
<br />
A smile cut across the shopkeepers aged face. He could not have hoped for a more fitting segue.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it just so happens I do have the perfect something for you. It's a limited edition piece, rarely played and rarely made.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Limited edition? What do you mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very few copies still exist yet the demand for them is so small I can't seem to give it away. How about it, want to take it off my hands?&quot;<br />
<br />
The young man gave an affirmative nod. He didn't much care about how good the game was; if it kept the girls distracted for the night then it was doing its job. Frankly, he hoped it was boring; after years of living with the fairer sex, he'd had his fill of bitter, violent struggles that usually broke out over the most mundane board and card games. <br />
<br />
&quot;Here you go then, Ryan. Enjoy the game as I'm sure you will.&quot; The shopkeeper said, handing over the box.<br />
<br />
Ryan responded with a brief, thankfully wave before hastily leaving the shop, not even second guessing how the shopkeeper knew his name. As the glass door slammed shut behind him, the old man clapped his hands in joy. Tonight was going to be a good night! It was to be the first time he'd seen the game played between a family and he couldn't help but imagine what was to happen.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey everyone, I'm back!&quot; Ryan yelled as he stumbled through the living room door. &quot;Get down here pronto so we can start playing!&quot;<br />
<br />
Despite his forceful command, he knew better. His sisters were never quick to move, like lazy sloths. Anticipating this, he began to unpack the game and set up the tokens, occasionally looking over his shoulder to note any arrivals.<br />
<br />
The first to arrive was his older sister Rachel. She was your typical burn-out; she was twenty-four and unemployed, without a single day in college to boot. Not counting her time getting wasted at the frat houses, that is. She was a party girl, through and through, and it was beginning to show. Beneath her bright blond, curly locks, her body was beginning to feel the toll of it all. A small beer-belly had formed, though other than that she had the same thin body she always did. A flat chest and a flat backside. She took a seat across from Ryan, ignoring him and instead typing away at her phone, no doubt flirting with some party boy she'd met a few days ago.<br />
<br />
The next girl to show up was Ryan's twin sister Alexis. Born on the same day as he, they were technically fraternal twins, meaning that they genetically no different than brother and sister. Despite that, they were closer to each other than anyone else to the point that they had enrolled in the same college for the same major. The two even cuddled on occasion, though the other sisters found it exceptionally weird. Like Ryan, she too had auburn hair, not to mention a body that outdid Rachel's, blessed with a decent pair of B-cups and a equally decent backside. Like always, she took a seat beside her favorite sibling.<br />
<br />
The third girl to arrive was Quinn, the youngest of the family. At the age of seventeen, she was the only member of the family left in high school, and it showed. She was loud and bubbly, constantly bouncing around the house like some sort of child. At times, it could be grating, but Ryan had learned to deal with her oddness. As had the boys at school, though for entirely different reasons; though younger than the rest of the girls, she had by far the most mature figure. A pair of natural E-cups, a bubbly backside, and a pair of wide hips gave her the perfect hourglass figure. It was most likely the only reason she got away with the stuff that she did. She took a seat between Ryan and Rachel.<br />
<br />
The last of the sisters to arrive was Cosima. Officially, the two were step-siblings, related through Ryan's mothers to hers. They'd been living together for around seven years though, bonding to the point that he considered her is kin. That said, though Ryan hated to admit it, his non-blood relation to her meant that he often caught his eyes lingering more than they should. Understandable, considering her body; Though not as stacked as Quinn, Cosima had an ample D-cup bosom. Her butt, while not as round as Quinn's either, was much more toned, thanks to her years in track. The raven haired girl took her seat beside Alexis.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright then, everyone's here&quot; Ryan said. &quot;Now, this box didn't seem to come with rules, though I doubt the game will be too hard, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, do we have to play this stupid game?&quot; Rachel chimed in, annoyed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, you do. Mom said that I'm to make sure you guys don't do anything stupid this weekend, so buck up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pff, hard ass...&quot; she mumbled. &quot;What's this game called, anyways?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The box said a it was called 'A Game of Change'. Now then, that's enough talk, who's going first?&quot;</p>
