<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Bill clenched his fist tightly as he glared at the cowering figure of Gloria Vanapolous, the egotistical bitch that had ruined his entire life. He could feel the sharp edges of the magic wishing stone that he&#39;d found earlier digging into his skin and the warm, wet feeling as a trickle of blood ran out of the spaces between his hand and fell freely to the carpeted floor of the upper hallway of the Strasserman household. He&#39;d just slapped Gloria in a anger-fueled haze over what she&#39;d caused to happen, the gemstone flying from her grip and nearly shattering against the hallway wall as a large jagged crack appeared at the point of impact.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, Bill never saw this as he snatched it up in his hand, nor did he realize the strange light that emanated from it was slightly off, slightly more gold than green and pulsing rather than simply shining bright.<br />
<br />
This was it, the moment where Gloria would get what was coming to her. The dumb bimbo had taken all of them into the future, made them all old adults, Tom into his Tammy and had created a daughter out of nothing! And then she&#39;d brought them all back to the present but Bill had ended up with different parents and his little sister Kimberley erased entirely in exchange for changing his future daughter into his BIG sister! And to another extent that no one had noticed (not even Bill himself) was that the teenager&#39;s actual appearance had changed to make him look similar to his new parents!<br />
<br />
All because Gloria was a dumb bitch who put her ego and mouth before the two brain cells in her head, always speaking when she shouldn&#39;t be, always too fucking slow to see the damage the smallest of her errant, cruel little comments could do to anyone and everyone!<br />
<br />
&#39;Maybe she should look about as smart as she really is!&#39; Bill thought as he held his bleeding fist towards Gloria, the glow from the magical wishing Stone convulsing violently as it fed off the pure rage that was fueling Bill despite the damage that had just been done to it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish that you&#39;d look as dense as you really are Gloria!&quot; Bill roared, and then the world vanished in a maelstrom of light and smoke that wormed it&#39;s way into Bill&#39;s nostrils and through his bared teeth. He coughed once, a husky, hacking sound and felt something heavy press down upon him as the light began to clear...<br />
<br />
...And Brianna yelped in pain as she let go of the shiny green rock she&#39;d found, the lifeless gem falling to the carpeted floor of her house as she wrung her hand in the air, her flabby arms shaking in the arm and the motion transferring through the resistance free fat and into the rest of her overweight, obese body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oooowww!&quot; She whined dully, looking at the red imprint in her hand before looking up at her friends, Gloria and Tammy, &quot;Did you girls see what happened? I think I got stung by something!&quot; The obese, brace-faced teenager held her sausage fingered hand out towards her friends while she used her free hand to push her limp, greasy brown bangs out of her beady eyes.<br />
<br />
Gloria leaned forward as far as she could, her titanic, saggy breasts hanging heavily off her chest and pressing against the thick fabric of her light sweater. She was even fatter than Brianna was, and with a free flabby hand of her own wiped a sheen of sweat off her perpetually sweaty brown. &quot;Um, I don&#39;t know Bri...Maybe you just got a sunburn or something?&quot; Gloria&#39;s voice held none of it&#39;s usual high pitched bitchiness as her triple chin began to jiggle, her previously emaculately glossed and lipsticked lips now more like thin pink rubber bands that spent most of their time hanging slack...Or by the amount of pimples on her new chubby face, shoving down sweets and greasy fast foods.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you think Tammy?&quot; Brianna offered, swinging her arm slowly towards her other friend, Tammy Ackerton, who was staring at them both with wide, blue eyes that sparkled out of her chubby but cute face as her puffy, done up lips opened wide in surprise. Brianna always thought that she and Gloria were so lucky that such a pretty, older girl would hang out with the two of them. Tammy was big like them, but she wore it well of her curvy frame. Her blonde hair was styled and curly, pouring down around her cute round face and laying on her boobs. And Tammy was always so confident, unlike herself and Gloria, the two Sophmores were really...um...they knew they were fat but Tammy always helped them feel better about it because she always wore really revealing clothes that made her boobs and booty stand out more than her belly. She even had a boyfriend!<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah Tammy, is it, um, a spider bite?&quot; Gloria chimed in as she leaned against the hallway wall for support. She felt like she knew what had happened...But at the same time she was just sort of hungry. Maybe Brianna just wanted some more breakfast.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile Tammy&#39;s mind was racing as she stared at her best friend turned husband turned boyfriend and her former evil ex. The two of them had changed in an instant, and she had as well, turning the three of them into...Into heavy girls! And what was worse, Brianna-<br />
<br />
&#39;No, that is Bill!&#39; Tammy scolded herself as she stared into the cloudy brown eyes of her former love, fighting the rush of memories that were sweeping over her just like it had when they&#39;d become old people. And then there was some kind of odd fogginess in her brain, she felt like she knew less now than she just had, but whatever had happened, it seemed like it had changed both Gloria and Bill on the INSIDE as well as on the outside! In fact, Tammy was pretty sure that Bill probably didn&#39;t remember being Bill at all! Instead the rush of memories told her that she was the older best friend of Brianna Strasserman and Gloria Vanapolous, two obese teenagers who spent most of the school day in their own remedial classes and had very few friends. She&#39;d felt sorry for the girls, who were mocked and bullied both behind their backs and to their faces (most of the time not getting the cruel jokes the other student threw at them). Tammy had decided she&#39;d be their friend, to help them as best as she could through high school.<br />
<br />
And because Brianna&#39;s big sister Willow had been her own upper classmen friend when Tammy had been a Sophmore. Every girl needed someone to look out for them, after all.<br />
<br />
&#39;But...Willow is supposed to be...&#39; Tammy pushed back against the fogginess. She knew Willow wasn&#39;t real...She WAS real but clearly not like, real real...But what had she been the first time they had all changed? Didn&#39;t she go to the future with them? Or did she come back from the future with them? She was important to her, but that was because Willow was her friend, right?Tammy suddenly felt very scared that she couldn&#39;t remember such an important detail.<br />
<br />
&#39;Oh, remember you dumb bimbo!&#39; She yelled at herself silently as she stared at the rapidly fading red spot in Brianna&#39;s hand, who herself was looking at Tammy with those dull brown eyes expecting an answer. &quot;Um, Like, I think you just bumped it on something!&quot; She said in a throaty, but still sing-songy voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, okay...&quot;Brianna said with a heavy nod. Really it didn&#39;t even hurt anymore, so it must not have been that important. What was important was that her big sister Willow (Who she was slightly jealous of because she was so thin and smart and allowed to drive) was waiting downstairs, and that the three girls were running late. &quot;Uh, Willow said she needed to be somewhere today so we should get going&quot;<br />
<br />
The tubby teenager rubbed her greasy palm on her pants which seemed to be barely containing the thick trunks of her massive legs, which trembled as she waddled forward towards the stairs. She didn&#39;t like stairs, they were so hard for her to use. She wished mom and dad had put her room on the bottom floor or lived in a one story house. Every time she and Gloria used stairs they always got sweaty. Well, sweatier. It was so dumb. She gripped the banister and took one uneasy, slow step after another as she descended, the reinforced wood shaking slightly with each impact until she finally stepped down onto the hardwood floor of the first floor. That was when Gloria made her own slow descent down.<br />
<br />
&#39;OMG they&#39;re like turtles!&quot; Tammy thought as she watched Gloria&#39;s entire body jiggle violently with each heavy step. They really had to start eating better like she&#39;d been trying to show them but-<br />
<br />
&#39;No Tammy, focus! This isn&#39;t right! You&#39;re supposed to be smart and Gloria and Brianna are not supposed to look like that! What were we using?&#39; Tammy spun around on her own heavier but well carried body and looked around the upstairs hallway. They had been using something...IT was a little like that movie with the old car but a lot smaller...You had to hold it and you had to be really upset to use it...<br />
<br />
That&#39;s when the memory clicked into place as her eyes fell upon the dull, lifeless gemstone that had bounced under one of the end tables in the hallway by Brianna&#39;s door. With a squeal of excitement she bent over and snatched it up in a hand that was only a little chubby.<br />
<br />
&#39;This is it!&#39; She thought to herself, casting a sideways look down the stairs as Gloria finally finished her descent, &#39;Now all I have to do is make a wish to fix this!&#39; Tammy furrowed her brow in concentration, she knew she had to be really focused...Or was it upset?<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, why is it so hard to remember!?&quot; She hissed as she clenched her eyes shut, not noticing the weak flare from the gemstone as it detected a hint of anger in the thick chick&#39;s body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um Tammy, we really need to go...&quot; Brianna called from downstairs and Tammy snapped her eyes open. That was right, they were running late for school and Tammy couldn&#39;t afford any more tardy slips.<br />
<br />
She looked at the gemstone before slipping it into the front pocket of her plus size (but still really cute) jean shorts. &#39;I&#39;ll just have to figure it out at school!&#39; She thought with a roll of her eyes before she hustled down the stairs towards her two obese friends.</p>
