<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ben&#39;s ears perk up as he hears someone approaching his position.   He freezes in place and waits to see who will come through the trees.  He cocks his head in slight confusion when nothing approaches him.   He reaches up and scratches the back of his neck,  feeling a little sheepish for his paranoia. <br />
<br />
As he turned to head back home,  he heard another twig crack and someone giggling at him.  Growling in annoyance,  he looks around again and still sees nothing.  &quot;Up here silly&quot; a soft voice called out from the treetops. <br />
<br />
Ben&#39;s head snapped up to a large tree a few feet in front of him.  There, laying on a large branch was a body darker than the night sky and large golden eyes staring down at him with amusement.   Ben is at a lose for words.  He doesn&#39;t recognise this were and they managed to sneak up on him.  Good thing he was alone or he&#39;d never hear the end of it from his packmates.<br />
<br />
Ben watches as the were rocks from side to side on the branch before falling off.   Before he could call out,  the body tumbles through the air,  twists around and lands on all fours.  The pure black body stands up and stretches her (yeah, he can tell it&#39;s a female by this time) arms over her head.  Ben can&#39;t seem to take his eyes off the muscles of her back,  the way they bulge and slide against her short velvety fur.  She gives her body a good shake before turning her head slightly to look at him.  &quot;Hi there.  Nice night for a run, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh yeah.  It is.&quot;  At first Ben thought he was looking at another werecat like his moms but this person was definitely different.  She was taller than a typical werecat and muscular.  Her fur was  shiny black and very short.  He bet if he got the chance to touch her it would feel so soft... &#39;whoah,  where did that come from?&#39;  Her golden eyes were slightly large with round black pupils.  Her muzzle was long and he bet she had longer fangs then his moms.  She had somewhat large breasts, a tapered waist,  and hips that flaired just a bit.  She had tone digigrade legs and a tail so long it swept the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;I get the feeling you have never come face to face with a were panther before.&quot;  She tilted her head to the side and gave him a toothy grin.  All Ben could do was nod and try to tear his eyes away from the curve of her hips.  &quot;That&#39;s not surprising.  We&#39;re more at home in the trees then on the ground.  It&#39;s the best way to stay out of other weres way.&quot;  She slowly walks up to him and Ben notices that she barely makes a sound as she moves.  She stops about a foot in front of him and seems to be studying him.  This makes him straighten up a little even though he&#39;s not sure why.<br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Kenya.&quot;   She holds her paw out to him.  Ben hesitates for just a second before reaching out to shake it.  The pads on her fingers  as well as in her palm was rough.  The fur surrounding her hand was soft like velvet and he wondered how it would feel if she ran it through the fur on his chest...oh boy!  Good thing she can&#39;t read his mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Ben.  It&#39;s nice to meet you.&quot;  He quicky let go of her paw before his mind and body betrayed him even more.<br />
<br />
Kenya looks up at the starry sky and sighs softly.  &quot;It was such a nice night.  I just wanted to hang out in my favorite tree for a little while.  I wasn&#39;t expecting a werewolf to run my way.&quot;  She chuckles and gives him a playful wink.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,  I had some energy to burn off.  A good run often does the trick.&quot;  Ben scratches the back of his neck and gives her a sheepish grin.  &quot;I wasn&#39;t expecting to run into anyone out here.&quot;<br />
<br />
They both stare at each other.  The silence of the forest seem to wrap around them.  Before either one could speak,  a loud  beeping went off,  causing them both to jump.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah shoot!  That&#39;s me.  Sorry about that.&quot;  Ben watches at she reaches for a small pouch that&#39;s sitting on her hip.  He hadn&#39;t noticed it because it was practically the same color as her fur.  She pulled out a cellphone and checked the time.  Her eyes grew wide and she bit her bottom lip.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no,  it&#39;s getting late.  I gotta go or my folks are gonna tan my hyde!&quot;  She looked up at him and gave him a nervous smile.  He understood.   He stole a quick look at his own cellphone that&#39;s hanging around his neck and he needed to get back home as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,  I have to go too.  I didn&#39;t realize how late it was.&quot;  He watched her as she visibly relax.  He couldn&#39;t help but smile at that.  He watched as she crouched down and began walking on all fours.  She ran for the large tree in front of them,  took a great leap,  and was up in the tree before he knew it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Goodnight Ben!  Maybe we&#39;ll run into each other sometime.&quot;  She was waving at him and he waved back before she disappeared quietly into the trees.<br />
<br />
&#39;Wow... that was unexpected.&#39;  Ben stood in the same spot for a few minutes more before he turned to make his way home.  &#39;Even though I&#39;ve lived here all my life,  this town still manages to surprise me.&#39; Ben thought with a slight chuckle.  He hopes he&#39;ll get to meet Kenya again.</p>
