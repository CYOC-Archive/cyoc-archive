<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff ran his massive hand through what remained of his hair, struggling to come to terms with the fact that, in less than a span of three hours, he had transformed from a popular and beautiful teenage girl into a handsome, rugged, hunk of a man. He wondered to himself how come it had been so gradual a transformation, and why exactly it was still going on. He obviously was a man now, there shouldn't be anything more to transform...unless...<br />
<br />
As Jeff thought back to the call Kyle had made, he remembered that Kyle had said he would be &quot;begging to join the football team.&quot; Did that mean that the changes would stop if he did join the football team? It was a risk to be sure, but Jeff was desperate to try anything. He could already feel what little bit of his mind that was still Jennifer getting weaker and weaker with each passing transformation, and soon there would be nothing left of the girl he once was. Maybe by stopping the transformations, Jeff could keep enough of herself to try and find a way out of this.<br />
<br />
He hated that he couldn't just use the transform or dare curse to get out of this, but no sooner had the thought crossed his mind then he realized that he could. When Kyle had used the curse on him, he had inherited it, and could use the curse on someone else to force them to change him back into Jennifer. Happy, he almost rushed out of his room, forgetting he was naked. A quick glance through his closet showed that, much to his chagrin, many of his outfits had been changed into boy's clothes. Tossing on a pair of jeans and a shirt as fast as he could, Jeff rushed out the door.<br />
<br />
As happenstance, he managed to run into a guy from school he knew as Jennifer. Apparently the skater kid, named Brad, was skipping school at the moment. Running to catch up to him, Jeff had to quell the thoughts of his improved running speed, lest they lead to more thoughts about sports and him losing track of his mind. &quot;Hey Brad!&quot; he shouted in his deep voice. Brad turned, not recognizing the muscle-bound guy who was following him, but his eyes went wide when he heard the words &quot;Transform or Dare?&quot; come out of his mouth. Brad had heard of the curse, but he didn't really believe it existed. Now that he was faced with it, however, he froze up, unable to answer. <br />
<br />
After a few seconds, Jeff internally smiled, knowing that the boy had gotten both. Now he just had to come up with some small transformation and then dare him to use Transform or Dare on him, thus necessatating his transformation back into Jennifer. As the words formed in his head though, his mouth started talking without thinking. &quot;You didn't answer so you get both,&quot; Jeff began, and to his horror he said, &quot;For your transform, you're going to turn into my fantasy cheerleader girlfriend. And for your dare, you're going to forget you were ever a skater named Brad.&quot; The minute he finished saying it, he regretted it, and Brad fell to the ground on his knees, as the changes started to overcome him. Not knowing what else to do, Jeff scooped up the still screaming Brad and rushed back into his house, setting him on the couch in the living room.<br />
<br />
By the time he got there, Brad's sandy blonde hair had already lightened to a bright sunshine yellow, and his face was becoming a thing of feminine beauty. As Jeff watched, he could help but feel an erection forming in his jeans, and without thinking he reached into his pants and began to stroke it. Brad's clothes literally melted and reformed over his newly transforming body, as a huge pair of breasts sprouted from his chest. His voice cracked several octaves higher, and he moaned as the pleasurable aspects of the transformation overcame the pain. Finally she opened her eyes, staring blankly at Jeff. &quot;Why are we at your house,&quot; she asked, oblivious to anything that had happened, and snapping Jeff out of his awkward state.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um...I...Brad?&quot; he asked, not really sure how to answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who's Brad,&quot; the newly minted girl asked, &quot;I'm Bree, remember?&quot; She giggled, apparently her mind a vacuous stereotype of a cheerleader, subject to Jeff's unknown fantasies. As she looked down, she saw the monster erection in Jeff's pants. &quot;I think I can take care of that,&quot; Bree said sexily, as she sauntered off the couch and onto the floor. Jeff tried to stop her, but with apparent expertise she had undone his zipper and released the nearly 18 inch monster from its hiding place. Quickly she began to suck at the end of it, massaging her tongue across the smooth end, and causing Jeff to shudder with delight at the sensations, all the while mindlessly removing his shirt. Bree did the same, pausing from her sexual act only to remove her blouse and expose her mammoth breasts to the cool air. In a matter of moments, a primal lust filled Jeff, and he roughly grabbed Bree by the shoulders and lifted her off his cock. As much as that felt good, he had an itch he needed to scratch now. Unbeknownst to him, a tingling started to fill through his body as his muscles started to grow in size yet again. Undeterred, Jeff literally ripped the skirt and panties off of Bree and placed her on the couch. Kicking off his jeans, he quickly thrust into her virgin pussy, causing her to cry out in pain from the foreign invader. A few moments later though, the cries of pain turned into screams of pleasure as he continued to piston in and out of her, breathing heavily. His transformation continued unabated as his abs became even more defined, becoming a washboard twelve pack of muscle, and his arms grew even more in strength, veins popping out along the contours of his biceps. His legs tensed up and clinched as they grew more defined and powerful, his calves gaining near superhuman definition. Finally, both of them climaxed together, his seed spilling into her as his now 20 inch cock pulled out with a loud popping sound.<br />
<br />
Both of them lay there, exhausted and overcome with pleasure, and deep in Jeff's mind, Jennifer's voice grew fainter and fainter.</p>
