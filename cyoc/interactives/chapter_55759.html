<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Sure were a lot of Mary's.&quot; Cansandra quipped. <br />
<br />
Glass Marie said simply, &quot;It was, and still is, a very popular name.&quot; <br />
<br />
For a species that naturally went around in the buff except for ceremony, (even ignoring <br />
otherwise the pleas from Felmans and Humans to at least put on a loincloth), the Lupmans <br />
all gathered in nineteenth century clothing were all looking and feeling quite comfortable. <br />
<br />
Alice of course in the dress of her namesake, her cousins/half-sisters in color inverted <br />
versions of that dress. The carnelian colored twins Lilly and Casandra were in dresses that <br />
hide quite a bit and then some and was more ruffles than dress it seemed that were the <br />
same style but with inverted colors of each other. <br />
<br />
Lawrence was dressed like a typical gentleman except her was barefoot (the others either <br />
had sandals or partial socks like a ballerina dancer), and Betty wore a typical middle class <br />
woman's dress of that era. Maddex wore... well, it was a freak show costume -exactly-... <br />
But Maddex was like Martha... a shiva wolf. <br />
<br />
He had two arms, two tails, four arms, two sheaths, an extra eye in the foreheads, two -<br />
heads-, containing two brains that were wired to each other resulting in a singular <br />
awareness (unlike Ingrid and Joy whose heads whose heads each seemed to have an <br />
independant psyche). This enabled him to speak with both of his daughters at the same <br />
time.  <br />
<br />
Perhaps it was due to whatever magic decided what those who came into this world within <br />
mirrors wore being aligned with the time that Lewis Carol had written 'Through The <br />
Looking Glass' had Maddex now wore slacks, and several charms and totems necklaces that <br />
looked like she were bought from a Snake Oil Salesman.<br />
<br />
 He was bare chested, which among the now clothed lupman made him seem even more <br />
the odder one out in spite of his deformity/mutantcy (which it was was unknown, though <br />
rumors and myths of previous such lupman existence in areas saturated with magic were <br />
not completely unknown). <br />
<br />
The bracelets and body paint on top of all that made him look like some kind to stage <br />
performer medicine man. Maddex of course said nothing. Barely two hundred years ago <br />
there would have been jokes about Omega inbreeding.  <br />
<br />
As it was, Felmans and Humans who didn't know of the Omegas who visited the estate for <br />
one reason or another still shrieked at the sight of him and his ilk. <br />
<br />
Then of course there was Marie's black dress with red trim that was the same pattern as <br />
Alice and her sisters save for the red runes sown into the cloth.  A fitting dress for the <br />
lupman pup made a witchling wielding all the magic that the game of Transform or Dare <br />
had been stealing from the rest of the world for over three hundred years. Deep down, <br />
none was more terrified of this than Glass Marie herself. <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;If Alice and Abbey hadn't been in such a hurry,&quot; Jensen thought as he looked over <br />
neglected reports from the multiple small businesses the Big Bad Wolf pack owned, &quot;I <br />
could have likely zeroed in on where Samantha was. Not that I can blame them for not <br />
asking, I don't use that magic trick so often, so I guess it's understandable.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Amy, Zelipe, the glass pups, the quadruplets, the Omegas, and Penny were not the only <br />
ones touched by the over saturation of magic brought about the Game of Transform or <br />
Dare drawing in endless amounts of the stuff to set in motion the cruel and just as often <br />
outlandish Transforms those who played the game inflicted on others. <br />
<br />
 There was supposedly even a young man who had found a way to avoid the limits of the <br />
game entirely by Transforming a woman into a Genie of the Necklace, loyal, without the <br />
limits on wishes, and without the genie seeking to turn on her master.  <br />
<br />
One man thinking the game just a game had even supposedly turned his girlfriend into a <br />
mermaid until he married her (as were the conditions of the transform he innocently used).<br />
<br />
 Another was a poor woman was made to her hair grew by the foot each day. It seemed <br />
that woman-haters were drawn almost magically to the game, rather strange given the trio <br />
of witches who had brought the game into being. <br />
<br />
Jensen, like the  Big Bad Wolf his pack was named after, could seemingly sense his prey no <br />
matter where it was or how far away or how well hidden. The one exception was those who <br />
entered the world within mirrors he found. <br />
<br />
He had used it once to even find his wife Kaylee who had gone with his wives Fran and <br />
Darla to look at a new house the pack might be interested in buying. <br />
<br />
&quot;I know it would make things easier, or rather, simpler, if all the gifts we've gained from <br />
the residue magic as Amy calls it just vanished along with the game but... it would feel <br />
almost like a cheat too, or would keeping them be the cheat? Or maybe in spite of how <br />
awful the game's been abused, maybe we just couldn't endure to not have -some- <br />
strangeness in town.&quot; The giant naked wolf-man with fur as black as midnight said. <br />
<br />
&quot;It's not all bad, the quadruplets said that a side effect of the magic is that all Leoman <br />
they've met and a lot of my Pack are immune to having our species changed.&quot; That made <br />
Jensen for one moment question about how Kurse was able to change them, but this <br />
thought very quickly faded to nothing as he figured that since all that magic that flowed <br />
through the curse, that Kurse herself would be able to somehow bypass it.  <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;It's past lunch time, would you please stay with us?&quot; Kaylee asked Gillie like a friend she <br />
had known for years. <br />
<br />
Gillie didn't want to be rude, in particular when she was walking blind folded through a <br />
minefield. But there was still one sacred thing she held onto and wasn't about to lose it no <br />
matter how much reality screwed with her now or before or later. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry, I have my duty back at the station, I've been gone way too long already.&quot; Gillie <br />
said calmly and politely doing her best to inch away. <br />
<br />
&quot;Too bad, I saw how you handled the cubs, or rather how they handled you, I was hoping <br />
you could stay.&quot; The seven foot tall she wolf to the nine foot tall lion woman. They were all <br />
effectively giants! But with everything built to scale, it was like the plants and animals were <br />
smaller, not the people were bigger. Kaylee's voice was that of a mother thinking of her <br />
children, not some teenage boy whose revenge Transform or Dare backfired. <br />
<br />
'Then again, Kyle Perkins never existed. The laws of the universe say that everything has to <br />
be consistent.' Gillie had the sickening feeling that if she was somehow to go back in time <br />
a year, she'd find wolf people and lion people still existed. That was the worst in her <br />
humble opinion if that was right, even TIME had forgotten how things were supposed to <br />
be. <br />
<br />
Then Kaylee added out of the blue, &quot;You seem a natural with kids, you'd make a good <br />
mother.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;NOWAY!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaylee startled by the reaction, and Gillie was startled out her exclaim turned into a roar <br />
that all the sensitive ears around her easily picked up. A lot of eyes fell on her. Gillie felt <br />
herself blush under her copper colored fur. &quot;I-I-&quot; Gillie struggled for a response, &quot;I'm <br />
dedicated to my duty, I don't have time for a family...&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaylee seemed a little deflated, &quot;I was only joking...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Besides, I nearly made things -worse- for the kids.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't be so hard on yourself. You did fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Only by the skin of my teeth. I was playing it by ear.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll find that's what pretty much any parent does.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
+++++++++<br />
<br />
Zelipe wasn't like the Alpha's pups, he had never liked hunting. While Kevin loved the <br />
excitement of the case, and Bart the thrill of the hunt and the delight of the kill, Zelipe had <br />
seen it purely as a task to be performed. As a lupman, hunting was expected of him, the <br />
little boy however couldn't have cared less for it. <br />
<br />
'I understand it's our food we're getting... but, I don't like it, I just don't like it!' <br />
<br />
Zelipe followed half heartedly as Kevin held onto Bart's every word as the seven year old <br />
held onto every word of the nine year old. The eight year old Zelipe just listened <br />
pretending that he was paying attention. His half-sister sometimes said weird things but <br />
at least he always felt safe around her, complete with her. <br />
<br />
Then finally came the time when the pale pink Zelipe was to flush out the rabbits, while <br />
Bart and Kevin zoomed in for the killing. Zelipe was glade he wouldn't be doing the actual <br />
task. The little boy never once thought how the meat he ate at the table had to come from <br />
somewhere. <br />
<br />
The rabbits had of course over the years due to natural selection been left with only the <br />
fastest, smartest, or luckiest of their breed.  This meant that hunting had become, like <br />
predators, a long and often fruitless task.  However Zelipe played his part well and Bart and <br />
Kevin managed to grab a rabbit a piece, crushing the life out of them leaving the rabbits to <br />
struggle to breath with crushed wind pipes before they finally suffocated. <br />
<br />
A couple hours later, the two boys between with the middle child Zelipe between them. The <br />
two naked furry children covered in blood and grinning as they held up their prize much to <br />
the praise of their mother. The two boys well remembered when they had been tongue <br />
lashed about eating a kill on the spot that would leave them with any number of diseases... <br />
Gold Deer seemed to be immune to the vast majority of diseases with the lupmans and <br />
leomans' hunting keeping their population in check, but still better safe than sorry.<br />

1688<br />
<br />
Marie in her life had never seen so many felmans together at once. But she knew it would <br />
be rude to stare. <br />
<br />
In some part of Marie mind, she fought against the image that she had been in a hallway <br />
full of children, 'dwarves', and teenagers dressing up as adults. <br />
<br />
Lilly asked, &quot;Didn't she mean munchkins?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That word hadn't been invented yet. And wizard of Oz wouldn't be published for over two <br />
hundred years.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Dwarf?&quot; Abbey asked, thinking of little men who mined diamonds. <br />
<br />
Marie nipped this one in the bud, &quot;As in naturally short people like who performed in the <br />
film adaption of Wizard of Oz! Not the characters from Lord of the Rings!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, okay, right, wasn't thinking that.&quot; Lawrence was the who nodded at that. After the <br />
strange things Marie Cruz had apparently met in her lifetime, he was almost ready to <br />
believe anything. <br />
<br />
Marie Cruz had taken to binding her chest while on some assignments, while it certainly <br />
helped her stay unnoticeable being 'just a woman' she also didn't like -them- getting in <br />
the way during life or death battles, and not all of her opponents would be as thrown off <br />
by their opponent being the life-giving gender. <br />
<br />
From everything she had read and heard from Kathrine, that same thing did not quite <br />
apply to felman. It was hardly perfect, but it was a Heaven and Earth closer than anything <br />
the lupmans, humans, or even leomans came to gender equality. <br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Must have been bad for Martin, being pink furred and being male in that day and age...&quot; <br />
Betty said simply.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually,&quot; Glass Marie said simply, &quot;Pink until the twenty century was seen as a masculine <br />
color, being a shade of red, while blue, being related to the virgin Mary, was thought of as <br />
a feminine color. Martin's fur color marked him a manly man, while Kathrine's primary blue <br />
color in turn marked her as a girlie girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
While Lawrence and Maddex digested this piece of information the blond pups spoke up. <br />
<br />
&quot;I think Zelipe would be very happy to hear that.&quot; Samantha said simply. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I bet he would.&quot; Abbey added. Alice said nothing, odd for her and her opinionated <br />
mouth. <br />
<br />
Maybe she was a bit frazzled at having her title of 'story interrupter' being stolen under her <br />
feet from her siblings and pack mates. <br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Calias you say?&quot; Marie asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. We've lived there for several generations through the great sickness.&quot; Mary responded <br />
in perfect Italian.  It was a slightly embarrassing reminder to Marie that while she spoke <br />
Italian, English, French, Latin, and German, she only knew the fundamentals of her <br />
birthplace's language. Lobo had joked that she read so much that it was a wonder her eyes <br />
didn't fall out of her head, Marie personally wondered with all the training her father put <br />
her through Marie wondered how she had not gone mad from lack of sleep. <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Your families should leave that city... it'll be conquered and re-conquered time and again <br />
in the ages to come...&quot;<br />
<br />
However Mary responded evenly, &quot;I know, it's been conquered more than once and I'm not <br />
a fool enough to not think it's not precious enough a prize to be conquered again. But it's <br />
our -home- we won't leave it, and we said we lived near Calias anyway, not in the center of <br />
the city.&quot; <br />
<br />
This startled Marie, this broke another age old stereotype... she knew that Kathrine had <br />
vowed to protect her with her life, but she figured Kathrine was an exception. Felman's <br />
desire to preserve their numbers was well known.  Kathrine didn't think they were cowards <br />
(someone who would impose a risk on another rather than face it themselves), she just <br />
didn't think they were risk -takers-. <br />
<br />
Not that Marie was one to judge, Marie was glade there was a good chance she wouldn't <br />
have to set foot back in England.<br />
<br />
 England was among the last places any catholic wanted to be right now. When King James <br />
second  earlier that year had formally suspended laws punishing catholics for being <br />
catholics, (along with having an army in place during peacetime after he had to deal with <br />
two rebellions), his own country had turned on him, and violence towards catholics had <br />
flared. <br />
<br />
Marie remembered her own trip to England... she never imagined a place where she'd have <br />
to hide her faith AND her gender from those around her. <br />
<br />
'Two catholic nuns going there right now would be suicide,' Marie thought. <br />
<br />
To humans, she was Spanish (in spite of not having spent less than six years of her life <br />
there before she was adopted by her father), or Catholic, or A Woman, to everyone else, she <br />
was just 'a human,' and was group together with people who'd swear by the god they loved <br />
that they were nothing alike. Marie resisted the urge to laugh. <br />
<br />
<br />
Glass Marie spoke, &quot;King James the Second would be remembered for nearly three hundred <br />
years as a tyrant and a bigot, it wouldn't be until some began to question the inevitability <br />
of the so-called 'bloodless' revolution that he'd be seen in a different light. While it would <br />
be final end of any absolute monarchy in England ever, they also wrote into law then and <br />
there that no Catholic could be king and no royalty could marry a Catholic. Catholics <br />
themselves who wouldn't have the right to vote in England for over a hundred years.&quot; <br />
<br />
Maddex blink, &quot;Bigot?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Declaring Protestantism to be a false religion after he converted to Catholicism didn't earn <br />
him that many friends. And Pope XI didn't like how James II was supposedly close to Louis <br />
XIV who was trying to form a strangle hold on the church to strip it of it's lands and <br />
property. The point is, if Marie could avoid going to England, she wouldn't complain.&quot; <br />
<br />
Marie -really- didn't like the idea of dragging along two families through the Vatican and <br />
having to explain to any curious enough or alert enough to ask what they could possibility <br />
be doing there. Thankfully the adults  let her do the talking and Mary was able to keep a <br />
lid on Joshua's mouth. <br />
<br />
However if Kathrine's family was willing to provide them with a much faster rout to the new <br />
world and thus 'New England' (if her senses were correct) and thus more time before the <br />
witches' power reached the threshold were nothing on Earth could stand in their way, then <br />
Marie Cruz was more than willing to endure it. <br />
<br />
And of course the felmans had to act like a family on a vacation through the country in the <br />
seat of Pope Innocent XI. Mary was as quiet as stone. The boys had to almost be put on <br />
leashes to keep from ruining centuries old works of art. And Josephine only cried twice. <br />
Martin stood with his head held high and his shoulder board and one foot in front of the <br />
other next to his serene wife as was expected of their fur color. Rachel and Dillon couldn't <br />
seem to go five minutes without saying something boldly or dramatically until finally Marie <br />
had to remind them to use their inside voices. Rachel's choices of words were mostly <br />
metaphors (one of which Marie was certain was used incorrectly), while Dillon's were <br />
articulate yet abstract (if that made any sense). <br />
<br />
This made Marie really wish she had done more than simply skimmed the guild on the <br />
different personality types expected of different fur colors. The boys acted no different <br />
from any other boys she had seen, but maybe that was cause it hadn't had it hammered <br />
into them how they were expected to behave by their fellow Felmans. <br />
<br />
Finally she managed to make it to Father Draco's room. She knocked and the bandaged <br />
clergy man opened the door. &quot;Yes Sister Marie? I-, who are your friends?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Father Draco, these are Sister Kathrine and her family, they apparently came all from <br />
near Calais to seen her farewell. They've offered to provide expedient transportation as well <br />
as cover expenses for Kathrine's sake for the trip to the new world.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you a leaper?&quot; The kitten of course mispronounced the word.<br />
<br />
Father Draco groaned, &quot;No, and no, and no.... Sister Marie, there is something I wish the <br />
two of us to discuss... in private... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Private? But if Kathrine's family is willing to help-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is important. They can wait out here. It shouldn't be more than a moment.&quot; <br />
<br />
Trust her old friend to the just honorable person she knew him to be, she walked inside <br />
leaving instructions to stay put and NOT to touch ANYTHING. &quot;Especially you.&quot; She pointed <br />
at Adam who seemed to have forgotten what his eyes were for and had to see everything <br />
with his curious hands. <br />
<br />
One inside the dragon did not sit back down. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sister Marie. I want to know. What are you hiding from me?&quot; Father Draco said simply and <br />
calmly. <br />
<br />
Marie Cruz held her composure, &quot;I told you I'd explain everything once we were on the <br />
boat to the New World.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; The bandages hiding his mouth blackened, &quot;I am not getting on any boat where I'll no <br />
longer have a chance to turn around and go home if I don't like what I learn. I am fully <br />
aware there are secrets that should be kept! But if you feel that they must be told, then <br />
you should tell me sooner than later!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;.... The name Marie Cruz was given to me by my father, I've long since forgotten what <br />
name I had before then. ... but for years when he first took me in he gave me another <br />
name. One which nature in some mindless act of petty spite and sadism chose to cut short <br />
my use of that name. You know one of the girls in my abbey thought I was a boy in a dress <br />
when I first arrived?  Marie Cruz. Didn't you think even once to ask if I was related to <br />
Maurice Cruz?&quot;  The blond haired woman spoke of the dark haired boy Father Draco Fire <br />
had known. <br />
<br />
&quot;... you knew him?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell me 'Flame-Baiter'! Doesn't this destroyed eye look familiar?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...-Impossible.-&quot;</p>
