<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was a hot sunny day, with a gentle breeze.<br />
Emily was only a few minutes from Eli&#39;s but she already felt too hot and sweaty. The layers coupled with her fur were overheating her.<br />
<br />
She stood outside a corner shop, finishing the last cigarette from the pack she took to the party the night before. She was going to try buying some more, knowing full well that they&#39;d deny her if they asked for ID.<br />
<br />
Her floppy ears swayed a little in the warm breeze, as a few people passed her while she finished smoking.<br />
&#39;So far nobody seems to be looking at me any different to normal&#39; she thought, slightly relieved.<br />
The shop would be her first real test though, actually interacting with someone might get a response out of them.<br />
She threw the butt on the floor and stamped it out. She must of looked a bit ridiculous right now wearing her wedges with these clothes, but Eli didn&#39;t have anything for her feet. She took a moment to look at the thick black nails on her feet, and realised she couldn&#39;t separate her toes anymore. They felt like they were glued together.<br />
<br />
&#39;Fuck it I&#39;ll worry about that later&#39; she decided, then stepped into the shop.<br />
<br />
The man behind the counter must have been in his late 20s. He eyed her up as she approached the counter and shot her a big smile. It seemed genuine enough, Emily thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey there!&quot; the man said, still smiling warmly at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Err.. Hi&quot; she replied nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;I haven&#39;t seen you in here before have I? Do you live in this area?&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily started to feel a bit anxious. Was he going to comment on her ears or horns? It was such a strange question for a shopkeeper to ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;Err.. no I was just in the area and needed to grab something. This was the first shop I passed...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought so, I&#39;d definitely remember a girl as beautiful as you coming in here&quot; he smiled at her.<br />
<br />
&#39;Oh my god he&#39;s hitting on me!&#39; she realised. Emily was flattered, but also a little overwhelmed by his forwardness. She felt a little more comfortable though, so she rolled up her sleeves and put her hands on the counter, giving him a glimpse of her cow print fur.<br />
<br />
He had a quick glance at it but didn&#39;t seem phased.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, maybe I&#39;ll be back if this is the kind of service you offer...&quot; She found herself flirting back.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what&#39;s your name gorgeous?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Emily&quot; she said, growing more confident in her appearance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, It&#39;s a pleasure to meet you Emily, I&#39;m Tom. Now what can I get for you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily had almost forgotten she&#39;d come in for cigarettes, enjoying Tom&#39;s attention a little too much.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh right yea. Could I get a couple packs of cigarettes please?&quot; Pointing to her brand.<br />
<br />
Tom eyed her up again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure. First though, and I&#39;m real sorry to ask, I&#39;m sure you&#39;re definitely old enough, but could I see so--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry one sec&quot; Emily interrupted, and started to pull her jumper off. She decided to try and use her &#39;charms&#39; to avoid the IDing, and figured it would be one last test to see if he reacted to her new body. If he did, she just wouldn&#39;t come back again, no harm.<br />
<br />
Emily pulled the jumper over her head to see he certainly was reacting to her body, but not to the tail or fur. His eyes were fixated on her breasts, bulging out of the gym vest. <br />
<br />
She let him stare for a moment, and even curled her tail around her body so it passed his eyeline,  but he didn&#39;t seem to care.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, what were you saying?&quot; She asked cheekily, bringing his attention back to her face. He looked a little flustered, his hand moved below the counter towards his crotch. Emily figured he was getting hard and had to rearrange himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shit sorry, it doesn&#39;t matter. So just the two packs yea?&quot; He turned and grabbed them from the shelf. While he was turned Emily put her arms back on the counter, using them to push her tits together even more. She was enjoying this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes please, two is fine... for now. I can always come and see you again if I need more...&quot; she said seductively.<br />
<br />
He turned back round and immediately glanced at her breasts pushed together over the counter, then snapped his gaze back to her face. She could tell it was taking a lot of restraint not to look back again. She was getting turned on, messing with him like this. Her sexual appetite spurred her on, seeing how far she could take this.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, how much do I owe you?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Erm that&#39;ll be £18.64 please&quot; he said, eyes briefly glancing at her chest again.<br />
<br />
Emily opened up her bag and pretended to root around in it, making sure her arms jiggled her breasts around. She feigned increasing agitation, then looked back at Tom, who quickly removed his eyes from her chest again.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m so so sorry, I think I&#39;ve left my purse at home&quot; she lied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is there anything else I can give you? I reeeaaaally need these right now, I&#39;ve got a terrible oral fixation...&quot; she walked around the counter, realising she sounded like she was in a porno right now, but she couldn&#39;t help herself. Now she knew people weren&#39;t going to kick off about her appearance, her confidence and libido skyrocketed. <br />
<br />
She placed her hand on his crotch and rubbed at it, staring into his eyes pleadingly. Now Tom seemed taken aback at her forwardness.<br />
He wasn&#39;t stopping her, so she got down on the floor and propped herself against the inside of the counter, unzipping his trousers.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-wait, someone c-could walk in...&quot; He said nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s fine..&quot; she said, as she pulled out his dick. It was already rock hard. Obviously smaller than what she&#39;d just spent the night with, but she really craved some cum right now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nobody can even see I&#39;m here&quot; she continued, then took the tip of his cock into her mouth. Tom didn&#39;t stop her, and just let her do his thing as he stood behind the counter enjoying this spontaneous encounter, struggling to hold back his moans and grunts.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes Emily heard the door go. Tom tried to pull away, but she forced the whole thing into her mouth, swirling her tongue around it all. He grabbed one of her horns, guiding her back and forth, restraining himself from making any noise.<br />
<br />
The mystery customer approached the till, it was a woman. Emily went for it, trying her hardest to disrupt his transaction. She could hear him stammering as he tried to reply to the woman&#39;s small talk. It seemed like she already knew him and was having a little flirt. Then she realised they were discussing their plans together that evening. Or, Tom was trying to atleast. <br />
<br />
&#39;Oh god she&#39;s his girlfriend&#39; Emily realised. Instead of stopping thought, she went for it even more. The thought of getting him to blow his load down her throat while he talked to his girlfriend turned her on even more. She slid her hands into her bottoms and started finger fucking herself, orgasming almost instantly her mouthful of dick stifling her moos.<br />
<br />
He obviously felt the same, because his cock started throbbing as it prepared to shoot his cum into her mouth.<br />
Emily gave her props to him. He actually composed himself quite well as he orgasmed. His face must have flinched a little as she heard him pass it off as having a cramp in his leg. Emily swallowed the whole load, and cleaned off the tip with her tongue.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright well I need to head back to work. Let&#39;s hope your cramp sorts itself out before tonight...&quot; The woman said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yea...I&#39;ll see you later Melissa&quot; Tom said, panting slightly. Emily heard the door go again so she stood up, licked her lips and gave Tom a kiss.<br />
<br />
She walked back round to the other side of the counter and picked up her cigarettes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you&#39;re a bit of a stallion aren&#39;t you Tom... I hope you&#39;ll be alright for later because it sounds like Melissa is going to be fucking you like a rabbit&quot; Emily said. <br />
<br />
She knew what she did, and her phone pinged twice as she expected.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, bring those back&quot; Tom said, gesturing to the packets.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I more than earned these, didn&#39;t I?&quot; Emily said, but Tom took one from her anyway.<br />
He took out a pen and wrote on it, then handed it back. Emily smiled at him, he&#39;d written his phone number on it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooh, what would Melissa think of this? Maybe I&#39;ll call you later when she&#39;s with you...or maybe I&#39;ll just have to come back here again when she&#39;s on break...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope you do&quot; Tom said, buttoning himself back up.<br />
<br />
Emily smiled at him and winked, then walked out the door.<br />
<br />
&#39;Thats it, I&#39;m officially a horny cow slut&#39; she thought. She didn&#39;t even care.</p>
