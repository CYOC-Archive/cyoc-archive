<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Josh snapped his new Speedo&#39;s waistband. Chad&#39;s face on the Speedo pouch was obliterated as Josh&#39;s manhood filled the pouch.  Josh had been standing in front of a full length mirror, as he pulled Chad over his nakedness. Chad watched his face vanish, just as Josh described that this was Chad&#39;s happiest moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nuh wuh! Nuh! Nuh! Nuh!&quot; Chad shouted with his mouth filled with Josh&#39;s cock and balls. <br />
<br />
Josh smirked, and moaned as Chad&#39;s ranting stimulated Josh&#39;s manhood.  In minutes, he was sporting a hard-on.  Chad&#39;s words were now completely unintelligible.  It reminded Josh of a porno Josh had seen with a girl gagged with a dildo down her throat.  Josh laughed, &quot;Hey, Chad, you just swallowed my cock, but will you swallow my load?&quot;  His hand closed around his erection grinding Chad into himself.  <br />
<br />
Chad was painfully aware what Josh was doing, and that he could do nothing to stop it.  He was totally owned.  He was Josh&#39;s Speedo, and new cum rag.  He sobbed. He didn&#39;t realize that his sobbing was giving Josh&#39;s cock a micromassage that made his orgasm more intense than anything he had ever experienced before.  Turning Chad into his Speedo was the best thing he had ever done.  He wished he had done it sooner.<br />
<br />
Josh looked down at his Speedo.  He expected to see a big wet spot, but instead he saw a perfectly ordinary dry Speedo.  Chad was overwhelmed with a total feeling of bliss.  He felt Josh explode, he tasted the hot sticky liquid that erupted from Josh&#39;s glans, and he felt its warm goodness filling every cell of his being. He knew bliss - total absolute bliss.<br />
<br />
The bell rang. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;m suited up, so maybe I should go for a swim?  What d&#39;ya say, Speedo Chad?&quot;  Josh asked.  When there was no reply,  Josh smirked, &quot;Guess, I know how to shut you up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Josh sauntered out to the pool like he was the school&#39;s golden boy and biggest stud.  Well, he sort of was, as he was wearing Chad who had been All-star, MVP, quarterback, team captain, State Champ, Golden Boy, Super Stud, Ultimate Jock and all-around Mr. Popular. He had a shitty grin on his face, and his bulge was as full as it could be without being erect.  <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re late, Josh,&quot; snapped Coach Sanchez, &quot;Give me the clipboard.&quot;<br />
<br />
Josh handed him the clipboard, and said, &quot;Well, you said I had to wear a Speedo, and-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Never mind that, now,&quot; snapped Sanchez. He turned toward the pool and began calling roll: &quot;Aiden, Alan, Andrew, Barry, Bobby, Brandon, Bruno...&quot;<br />
<br />
Josh sighed, and tuned Sanchez out. At a glance he could see only Frankie, Greg, and Tobin were missing, but Sanchez insisted on calling roll. He stood there with arms crossed waiting for Sanchez to hand him back the clipboard.  Then Josh would stand around until Sanchez wanted to write something else on the clipboard or until Sanchez wanted Josh to hand him a towel. There was a bench that Josh could sit on, but Coach Sanchez didn&#39;t think the towel boy/team manager should sit while on duty. So Josh stood there, arms crossed, smiling smugly, as he thought of Chad&#39;s face being obliterated by his manhood.  He glances down at his bulge, no sign of Chad&#39;s face. It was good to own golden boy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Josh?&quot; Sanchez shouted waving the clipboard at Josh for him to take.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, sir?&quot;  Josh said taking the clipboard.  Wearing Chad gave Josh a lot more confidence. He was standing straight with his chest out, and a commanding look on his face.<br />
<br />
Sanchez glared at him.  Just when he thought he had Josh trained, the kid decided to get some backbone.  Time to debone him, Sanchez thought, but after I whip these guppies into sharks.<br />
<br />
Chad was actually feeling quite comfortable as Josh&#39;s Speedo.  He was living in the moment, not thinking of what would or might be.  He was warm, dry, happy, and satisfied.  He really found that load of Josh&#39;s cum satisfying.  It made him feel warm and happy all over.  He was Josh&#39;s Speedo now.  He didn&#39;t know how.  He didn&#39;t know if it could be reversed.  But in the moment, he didn&#39;t care.  He was Josh&#39;s Speedo now - so now he would be the best Speedo that Josh could have.  Being human again, having a future - any future was irrelevant.  He was Speedo at the moment, so he&#39;d be the best Speedo he could be.  He didn&#39;t care whether it was Josh wearing him or Coach Sanchez or Bruno or anyone else, it only mattered that someone was wearing him, and he was a good Speedo.<br />
<br />
Josh was unaware of the changes in Chad&#39;s attitude.  If he had been he would have laughed at Chad&#39;s accute ADHD and OCD - he didn&#39;t remember being human or if he did it didn&#39;t register as important right now.  Only the right now mattered.  Right now, Chad was a Speedo, so what did a Speedo do?  Support a guy&#39;s balls and ass to prevent groin injuries, and make sure he was hydrodynamic as he swam.  Of course, Josh wasn&#39;t swimming right now was he?  So what else did a Speedo do?  Chad realized that a Speedo helped a man show off his physique, and gave his wearer confidence.  Chad&#39;s memory focused only on how to build up Josh&#39;s confidence and body.  That was his mission.  Josh didn&#39;t know that was Chad&#39;s mission now.  He just knew he felt more masterful and confident than ever before.  He had no idea that Chad&#39;s confidence was channeling into him.<br />
<br />
When the team had finished, and hit the showers.  Josh policed the pool area.  Typed up the notes from Coach Sanchez&#39; clipboard, but instead of collecting towels and changing - he found himself working out lifting weights.  When Josh was good and sweaty, he went for a swim.<br />
<br />
Coach Sanchez glared at the towels left by his swimmers, where was that towel boy?  He couldn&#39;t still be policing the pool deck could he?  Probably, goofing off.  He stormed out to the pool in time to see Josh execute a perfect turn and swim 100 m in record time. He checked his stop watch, as Josh swam another 400 m back and forth.  Damn, Josh should be on the team not managing it.<br />
<br />
Josh surprised himself.  In the past he had only dog-paddled, but he was swimming, freestyle, butterfly, backstroke, and more.  He figured he had just been paying attention while Sanchez coached the team.  In reality, he was channeling Chad&#39;s swimming abilities, and knowledge. He seemed to instinctively know how to swim.  And Speedo Chad was thrilled to be helping his wearer swim.  Josh used muscles he didn&#39;t even know he had.  He was sore when he left the pool. <br />
<br />
After gathering up all the team towels,  Josh headed for the sauna.  It was two hours later than he usually left, but buses ran until midnight.</p>
