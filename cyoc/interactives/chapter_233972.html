<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mitch was feeling better after his initial freakout. It wasn&#39;t easy being a cute little boy one day and the next becoming a fat middle aged man. And his Daddy was just a little boy! <br />
<br />
Mitch found himself in front of the mirror holding his big belly. His Dad&#39;s T-shirt barely covered it. It had hair on it. He had hair all over now! On his face, he even had stubble! He felt it back and forth with the palm of his hand, testing the strangeness of it. He waggled his tongue back and forth and his tummy started to grumble. He couldn&#39;t believe he looked like a grown up now! <br />
<br />
&quot;Daddy, I&#39;m hungry! Can you make me some lunch, please?&quot; the grown man asked, towering above the cute little boy watching TV. Adrian had shrunk to become a miniature version of himself. As a kid and adult, he had model good looks. He had starry eyes and perfect hair, and his skinny arms and legs could barely walk a dog now, let alone lift weights. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m...going to need some help, I think. I&#39;m...shorter now.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll help you, Daddy!&quot; <br />
<br />
Adrian directed the former little boy to reach up to the tall cabinets and get down plates and cups. He got the chicken out of the fridge and created a marinade for it, seasoning it and placing it in a glass casserole dish to bake. Then, he made a salad and soon his new adult son was chowing down. <br />
<br />
&quot;Daddy?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, son,&quot; the 8 year old boy replied, deep in thought as he stared at his lunch. He didn&#39;t eat as much as he thought he would. He had served himself adult portions without thinking about the fact that he no longer had an adult stomach. <br />
<br />
&quot;Can I have some more? I&#39;m really hungry now!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, here ya go, kiddo.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, Daddy!&quot; Mitch wolfed down the rest of his meal. He wasn&#39;t a bad looking man, Adrian thought. As a grown man, he&#39;d actually become quite ruggedly handsome. Blond coarse sandpaper stubble, rough curly hair had taken a hit and was now less curly and his forehead had elongated from the beginnings of male pattern baldness. Wonder how my son would feel about losing his hair over the next few years, Adrian thought. Oh God, what am I thinking? We can&#39;t stay like this for years! <br />
<br />
&quot;Daddy?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, sweetheart?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Why did the magic spell make me fat? Why don&#39;t I have big muscles?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You need to lift weights to get big muscles. And I don&#39;t know how magic works.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe if I lift weights, I&#39;ll get big muscles like you!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;It takes years to lose weight and fat and gain muscle. Years of hard practice and training,&quot; the little boy explained. <br />
<br />
&quot;So you think I&#39;m gonna be fat forever, Daddy?&quot; Mitch jiggled his tummy around and played with it more. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t do that, sweetheart. And...I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t think so. I&#39;ll show you some exercises but you have to wait an hour after your meal, okay? Why don&#39;t you go watch TV?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mitch smiled. He looked like an ex football player who had given up on himself, Adrian thought glumly. Mitch became engrossed in a wrestling match, something he had never watched before. <br />
<br />
&quot;This is so cool! These guys are super big and have big muscles. I want big muscles like those guys!&quot; Mitch adjusted his big new dick. He had been grabbing it and holding it and Adrian was supposed to have &quot;The Talk&quot; with him but he hadn&#39;t quite yet. <br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s teach you some basic moves,&quot; he said, and let Mitch outside into the backyard where he had a barbell rack set up. At first, embarrassingly, Adrian had gone for a 50 pound plate, and then remembered that he was only an 80 lb little boy. He tried the 20 pound plate and then the 10 and finally the 5 pounds. He could lift 5 pounds at least, he thought, wanting to cry out of self-pity. Sitting under the bar, he told Mitch how to &quot;spot&quot; someone by putting his hands under the bar in case the bar slipped. He told Mitch it was proper gym procedure to have a buddy. It was okay if you felt you could lift it on your own, but if you were lifting anything that really felt like a challenge, you should have a spotter.<br />
<br />
&quot;So five pounds is a lot for you now, huh Daddy?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I...we&#39;ll find out, I guess.&quot; <br />
<br />
Adrian&#39;s arms were much smaller now so Mitch had to help bring the bar down for Daddy to work out with. Adrian managed to show his son the proper form, whilst struggling to do even two full sets of ten reps with the full ten pounds he was lifting. <br />
<br />
&quot;Goddamit, I can barely lift ten pounds!&quot; he muttered angrily. <br />
<br />
&quot;How much weight do you think I should put on, Daddy?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Better put on ten pounds at first for each side. You&#39;re obese, which isn&#39;t that much better than being in a little boy body.&quot; <br />
<br />
Mitch felt a little hurt for some reason, he didn&#39;t know why his pride and self-esteem were hurt, but he suddenly felt the strong desire to be like his Daddy. <br />
<br />
He completed 3 sets of 10 reps with no problem. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, I can feel my muscles working, Daddy! I&#39;m gonna get real big muscles now!&quot; Mitch made a pose like he thought a bodybuilder would make. <br />
<br />
They worked on legs, doing goblet squats and deadlifts. Mitch was feeling like he could put on more weights, so he did. He started doing deadlifts with up to 50 pounds, goblet squats with 30 pound dumbbells, and bicep curls with 20 pounds for each arm. <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re doing better than I expected, kiddo!&quot; Adrian exclaimed. <br />
<br />
&quot;I wanna exercise more!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, but...at the  one hour mark we should stop so your body can rest and recover.&quot; <br />
<br />
Adrian showed his son, who didn&#39;t appear tired at all, how to do triceps, back, and shoulder exercises. Mitch only stopped to drink water out of the thermos Daddy had given him. He was now addicted to the testosterone rush he was getting. Pumping weights felt SOOOOOO good! No wonder Daddy did this for a living! He wanted to lift weights all the time, too! <br />
<br />
That was when Adrian began to notice that things had somehow...changed with his new big little boy. Adrian&#39;s eyes went wide. Mitch had clearly defined muscles in his arms now. The fat had begun to shrunk. Legs, too. In fact, proportionately, the body fat percentage had dropped by about 15%.  Adrian, with his expertise and knowledge regarding such matters, knew that was impossible. <br />
<br />
&quot;I feel REALLY good. I FEEL REALLY GOOD!&quot; Mitch almost roared as he loaded up the bench press and attempted to lift 100 pounds. His arms buckled a tiny bit under the new weight. <br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t spot you!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t talk! I&#39;m lifting! OH YEAH! THAT&#39;S GOOD! THAT FEELS RIGHT!&quot; As Mitch finished his first set of 10 reps at 100 pounds, he was able to put the bar back in its place with no problem. Mitch&#39;s blond hair and face was dripping with sweat. Testosterone was peaking through his system. His new balls were producing the unfamiliar feelings and emotions he now was experiencing. He felt powerful and big and he was belting orders to the small child in front of him without a second thought. &quot;Go get me some more water,&quot; he ordered Adrian, who, like the good little boy he now was, trotted off to the kitchen to fill it up for Mitch. When he came back, Mitch had gone back to his new sets and finished three sets of 10 with a 110 pounds. He grunted and panted and finished with the loud CLANK of the barbell. He sat back up again and held out his hand for the water, which he chugged without comment. He got up and walked past little Adrian without a word and began working on his legs again. His hamstrings and quadriceps were looking much better now and after 4 sets of 100 pound squats with the barbell, they looked like they had grown by about 50% in terms of muscle from when he&#39;d started out just a few hours before. Mitch was screaming now and grunting and roaring as he worked out. <br />
<br />
&quot;YEAH! THIS FEELS AWESOME! FEELS REALLY GREAT!&quot; He did some more bicep curls, increasing the weight to 80 pounds. HIs little daddy watched helplessly from the sidelines as his new big son moved around like some kind of animal, some now-muscled up Viking barbarian about to scream at the drop of a hat. <br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe we should stop for now.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not stopping. You can&#39;t tell me what to do! Go back inside and wait for Dad to get back! I have work to do!&quot; Mitch bellowed at him. <br />
<br />
&quot;That doesn&#39;t sound like you, sweetheart. I...I think it&#39;s the magic.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No shit, it&#39;s the magic. I&#39;m a man now. I need to get big. Get inside and watch cartoons. NOW.&quot; Mitch ordered. Wide eyed and completely freaked out, Adrian ran inside and curled up on the couch, waiting for his now much taller partner to get home. <br />
<br />
I hope he finds that little brown nerd and undoes this fucking curse, he thought. He felt himself getting emotional. Tiny little tears escaped from his little eyes. He wiped them off and ran to his bedroom. The bed was much higher now that it had been and he had to climb up on it whereas before he could just sit down on it with his old height. He curled up with a pillow and wished he had something to hug. <br />
<br />
Mitch finished his workout. Every muscle was on fire. Every muscle burned with strength and energy and he was in absolute ecstasy. He chugged the water from his thermos and threw it on the ground and let out a big belch. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Mitch was starting to look like an actual bodybuilder. His gut had been shrinking steadily over the last few hours. Without even consulting with his dad, he decided to so some compound exercises Daddy hadn&#39;t even shown him...and after another hour a new man emerged into the house. Mitch was furiously high off of the testosterone rush. He had never experienced anything like the power he now held. He was almost animal like. His arms were now, although not at a professional bodybuilder level, certainly something that could pass for a man who had worked out for several years. His arms were now almost all muscle as well as his legs. He still had a gut but he was now in essence a musclebear. His shorts, which could barely contain his dick, were a prison. His big dick throbbed against the pressure and he ripped them off, and when he stomped into the bathroom he smiled with fervent glee. <br />
<br />
&quot;OH YEAH! HUGE! I AM HUGE AND I&#39;M GONNA GET HUGER! FUCK YEAH!&quot; Standing before him was a real MAN. His body glistening with sweat, his dick flopping around like a cucumber. &quot;Daddy didn&#39;t tell me it felt so good to have a big penis,&quot; he said out loud to no one in particular. <br />
<br />
He got the shower going. It looked so much different from up here! he thought. He was at eye level with the shower nozzle now! He had to duck down under it to get wet! And the suds felt sooooooo good over his muscles! <br />
<br />
When he got to his dick, he instinctively rubbed it and it felt so good he kept rubbing it. He had never done anything like this before with his penis but it felt so good he couldn&#39;t stop himself if he tried. He moaned a little and then a lot. He used both hands to grip the giant fuckstick he now possessed. &quot;OHHHHHHHHH! OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! OHhhhhhhOOHHHHHHHHHHHh OHH OHHH OOHHH OOHHH OOHHH OHHH OHHHH!&quot; <br />
<br />
He thought of the wrestlers he saw on TV and Dad, his Dad Eric who was right now looking for a way to turn him back into a little boy. <br />
<br />
But he wasn&#39;t concerned about that. He thought of muscle and football and the hot garbage men who his dads always oogled and Mr. Brown at school who taught 4th grade. <br />
<br />
He was now experiencing the height of orgasmic climax. As Adrian hugged a pillow and cried, he heard his son screaming and he knew exactly what he was doing in the shower. Adrian tried fingering his own little member and tried bringing it to life but with no luck. His junk just wasn&#39;t a man&#39;s junk anymore. It didn&#39;t feel like anything. His balls hadn&#39;t even dropped yet! He cried more heavily into his pillow. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Mitch&#39;s entire body was on fire and felt completely amazing. Every part of his body was strained and poised, as if expecting something. He rubbed his dick and then gripped it. It felt good to grip it and pull back and he did this several times, screaming loudly as he did so. <br />
<br />
Then he exploded. Or rather his dick exploded. As the water blasted him, he felt a giant SOMETHING make its way up the giant shaft of his new penis until it SHOT OUT OF HIS PENIS and onto the shower wall. SPLAT! A big ball of slime oozed down the tiles and then...SPLAT! Another one! Like shooting the guns at the carnival at the ducks, he thought briefly. He felt himself trying to make the feeling last longer. He stroked his penis and came a few more times all in a row and he saw and felt the cum erupt from his dickhead and onto his hands. He played with it for a little while. Some of it was more solid and some of it was liquidy like dish soap. <br />
<br />
He cleaned his penis off with soap again and his big hanging balls. He had big balls now! They swung around and he felt the heavy tennis ball heft of them, only they were heavier than tennis balls! <br />
<br />
&quot;Feels so gooooood,&quot; he moaned out loud. <br />
<br />
He dried off and couldn&#39;t see his reflection through the steam but he could feel his new adult muscles and new that what he did was somehow related to sex. That was something he had to put together. Men made babies because they put their penises inside women, who had vaginas. Dad and Daddy had adopted Mitch but originally he had a Mommy and a Daddy who made him but couldn&#39;t afford him. That must be how men could make babies, he thought. Because as a little boy, he had never been able to make stuff shoot out of his penis like that and it definitely wasn&#39;t the same as peeing! <br />
<br />
He dried off and came out butt naked to sit on the living room couch. He waited for Adrian to come out, and he eventually did. It was getting to be evening. <br />
<br />
&quot;You...you&#39;re naked.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but it feels good to be naked.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Grown up men should put clothes on in front of children.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;So what you&#39;re saying is that I&#39;m no longer a child. You&#39;re the child,&quot; Mitch said, with a satisfied grin. &quot;I know what you and Dad do now. I heard you making all those noises before, remember? Remember how you guys made noise and said you were playing a special game? I figured out the game now with my penis! I did it in the shower! I made it big and figured it out how it works! It feels really good to make the stuff come out!&quot; <br />
<br />
Adrian swallowed. Mitch was turning into a sex stud before his very eyes. He was intimidated by this now monster of a man, grinning in his newfound masculinity, proud of his ability to cum. He didn&#39;t even know the words for sex, so Adrian tried to tell him at least the vocabulary. He explained the words for orgasm, cum, cumming, sperm, dick/cock, testicles, balls, and explained how the sperm or cum was made inside the balls and traveled up through the dick. He explained that babies could be made that way but he also told Mitch that men could have sex with each other when he asked what he and Dad Eric did together. <br />
<br />
&quot;We suck each other&#39;s dicks and it feels very good. We actually will eat each other&#39;s cum. But you shouldn&#39;t talk about that to anyone else. Not outside this house. Not ever.&quot; <br />
<br />
Mitch nodded like he was in on a secret now. <br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds really fun! Does it taste good?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Honestly, we think so. We both think it tastes very good. And then, of course, there&#39;s anal sex. That&#39;s when a man fucks...that&#39;s the word for sex when you have a dick and you&#39;re using it...the other man through the asshole. We fuck each other and it feels very good for both of us. It feels good to fuck and it also feels good to be fucked. But I can&#39;t fuck anymore now and that&#39;s why I really want my body back to normal!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mitch was grinning like he&#39;d just won a prize. <br />
<br />
&quot;Interesting! So this is what it feels like to be a grown up all the time, huh? That&#39;s pretty cool! Hey, can I have sex with Dad now?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;NO! You can&#39;t!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Why not?&quot; Mitch asked defensively, a little angrily. &quot;I&#39;m a grown up man now!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;It...isn&#39;t something little boys do with their daddies, at least not most of the time. Society looks down on it and you can get in very big trouble if you&#39;re a grown man having sex with a child.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;But I&#39;m NOT A CHILD ANYMORE,&quot; Mitch reasoned, getting pissed off by this little boy trying to tell him what to do. <br />
<br />
&quot;I know! But...still.&quot; <br />
<br />
The sound of Eric getting home filled the room as the door swung open and Eric walked through the hallway and discovered his now adult son completely naked, having lost maybe 50 pounds of fat, with his arms spread out and manspreading his legs as the little boy that used to be his partner sat patiently opposite to him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like I got here just in time!&quot; Eric said. He was taller than Adrian had been at 6&#39;3&quot; and had the handsome features that Adrian had always thought of as being very fatherly but plain, with features that were more adorable than masculine. Sparkling eyes, young looking face with stubble, neatly combed hair with a part at the side, a goofy grin. &quot;Here you go, son. These should fit you, although you might need to use a belt on the pants. Did you lose weight?&quot; Eric asked incredulously. &quot;Did he lose WEIGHT?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Look, Dad!&quot; the gruff muscular blond middle aged stud said, swaggering across the room, flexing for his slightly taller father, who was only taller than him by a few inches now. &quot;I exercised and got WAY bigger! And then I took a shower and I learned how babies are made! I can totally make babies now...I mean...if I wanted to.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, please don&#39;t, because I would rather not pay that hospital bill, alright, champ?&quot; Eric joked. He watched his nude son get casually dressed in front of him without any anxiety or embarrassment whatsoever. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, this is way better! These clothes fit me awesome! Except the pants.&quot; He frowned, and then learned to cinch them with his belt. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;m glad I only bought you two different outfits. We can get you a different waist size next time.&quot; Eric told Mitch, who smiled confidently. &quot;And now...I have some good news and bad news, so I&#39;d like you both to sit down now, please.&quot; <br />
<br />
They did so and waited for Eric to tell them about what he&#39;d discovered.</p>
