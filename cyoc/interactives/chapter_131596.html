<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The sight of Matt and the words of Kate had only one final form tied to its answer.  Shutting his eyes, he was waiting for any sense of a change to know whether this was really real.<br />
<br />
He was sweating all over and shaking, but that could easily be nerves, but it was the odd rub at his ass that caused his heart to catch in his throat.  Moving his hands slowly, he got one finger back into his pants and to the base his spine.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shit,&quot; Tom muttered uncontrollably, now reaching his whole hand in to grab at the eight inch tail now pulled out and growing over his pants.  The sprouting hairs at the tip into a growing tuft was telling to Kate, who took hold of the tail sharply, causing Tom to cry out.<br />
<br />
&quot;What have we here?  Kind looks like a,&quot; and rather than finish, she let her hand slide to the base of the tail.  Distracted by an uncontrolled flaring and spreading of his nostrils, Kate tugged down Tom&#39;s pants to the knees, tipping him over to barely upright.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot; he cried, unable to stop her and fearful of, like Matt, falling on all fours and not getting up again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shut it,&quot; Kate said with indifference, prodding Tom&#39;s cheeks apart to confirm her suspicions.  &quot;That&#39;s adorable,&quot; she said with mock sweetness.  &quot;Becoming a cow for your friend to fuck pregnant,&quot; she said, spreading the still forming slit in Tom&#39;s taint, under a gaping and changing asshole.  Below the slit, his balls were swelling in a similar fashion to Matt&#39;s though the skin tone failed to change and soon the growth took his cock along with it.  The reason why became clear as other nubs were budding on what was a newly formed udder.<br />
<br />
Kate pulled his pants down the rest of the way.  &quot;Step out,&quot; she ordered with an added slap to the calf.<br />
<br />
Tom did so, but telling himself it was only because he wanted to stand up.  As soon as he had two feet free, Kate gave him a hard shove.  He could only just get his hands under him before a popping of the hips and morphing of bones made standing up on two legs impossible.  The change in posture spread his rear and allowed his udder to grow less impeded by Tom&#39;s attempts at modesty.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why did you do that?&quot; Tom said with a panting sadness, seeing his own fingers starting to stick together while his nails darkened.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I&#39;ve accepted that you&#39;re a cow already.  And because Matt prefers this view.&quot;  She said the last bit with a wink towards where Matt had been.<br />
<br />
Turning his head, which grew heavy from a forming snout and teeth being replaced, Tom didn&#39;t see Matt at all.  There was a massive black bull snorting and slathering only feet from Tom&#39;s fattening ass.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pl-please.  Get him away I... you have to stop this I can&#39;t, I can&#39;t gooOOOOOO,&quot; and Tom clamped his mouth shut rather than finish his sad bellow.<br />
<br />
Tom tried to hold it all in but instead, let out a laced stream of piss over his now swollen bovine cunt, causing his new tail to flick the smell around on instinct; which frightened him most of all.  Not one second after, there was a snout hastily taking in his scent.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re about to get fucked into cow-dom, Tom.  Sorry if this isn&#39;t how you saw your life going,&quot; Kate said, stepping away as Matt the bull seemed to be sizing Tom up.<br />
<br />
To Tom it felt like his shoulders were pushing up but it was merely his body adding more and more weight, stomachs, sprouts of fur and more and more milk into his every swelling udder.  It was as his neck was starting to lengthen, his perspective changing and his glasses at last tumbling free of his face, that the scrabbles of Matt finally amounted to him on Tom&#39;s back.  The weight made his new hind legs shape but his new hooves, carrying sheaths of ripped sock around the ankle, helped bear the weight, much to Tom&#39;s disappointment.<br />
<br />
After several unsuccessful attempts, Matt found the mark with his new member and quickly thrust into Tom with no regard to his former friend as anything but a ready and willing mate.  Tom&#39;s eyes shot open, forcing him to watch as every inch of bull cock buried in him pushed his snout out until his whole head was just short a covering of fur.  A mirror on the wall provided Tom the perfect view of Matt the bull fucking every inch of humanity out of him, leaving him a hefty cow with a full udder and a ready womb.<br />
<br />
When Matt finally reached his climax, Tom was filled to the brim in moments, causing the rest to spill out onto the floor.  Tom&#39;s own mind flooded with thought and emotions that were washed away once his species was consummated.  No sooner did Matt hop off his now pregnant mate, they disappeared to a farm up north, to live their days and bovines and their old lives nothing but a memory.</p>
