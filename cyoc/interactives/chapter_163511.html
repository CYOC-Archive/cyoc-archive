<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There wasn’t much left what could have been recognized as human on Clarisa. Probably her fingers, but their nails were turning darker rapidly <br />
<br />
“She is already gone, maybe I can save myself!” But as soon as Juliet did guilt riddled her consciousness. This was Clarisa after all, her best friend. She couldn&#39;t leave her here alone. She had to try.<br />
<br />
Clarisa was having a hard time thinking. “Heeey...I just...got...it! Theeeehawwwwy were right! Weeeee will never waaaaaant to leave!” <br />
<br />
She started to bend over as her hands began to ball up.<br />
<br />
“No, no Clarisa!” Juliet cried as her friend bent over, her hands deforming. She rushed over to help Clarisa stand on two legs. But Clarisa got heavier every second and it was a futile attempt.<br />
<br />
When her hooves touched the ground only a donkey was left of her best friend. <br />
<br />
Clarisa looked at her friend, strangely on two legs. “Juliet......HAW-Heee! I feeeehawwwlikeeeehaw an animaaaaww! Heeeeee hawwww!”Juliet watched on as humanity slipped from Clarisa. <br />
<br />
Juliet knew what it meant, her friends only thought now were food, sleep and probably finding a male donkey. Clarisa took a contented nibble of grass as her worries slipped away into an animal haze.<br />
<br />
Juliet felt sick, sad and overpowered. She plopped herself down right there not caring if she hurt her tail, and started to sob her ears folding flat against her head.<br />
<br />
“Pretty lady, what’s wrong?” A deep voice asked.<br />
<br />
Juliet spun around seeing the big man from the last day. <br />
<br />
“You? You did this! You are turning us all into animals!” Juliet accused the vast man.<br />
<br />
“No, you did it. After all, you were already animals on the inside if you came to this island. In fact, I heard that you and your friend there brayed in class. Your bodies just match what you really are. But you seem to need some help.” Said the man smiling at her.<br />
<br />
“Help?...let us go. I don’t need your help, and don’t call me an animal just because I …we fooled around!” Juliet spat at the coachman.<br />
<br />
“Does your friend look sad?” The big man asked, pointing at the grazing donkey. <br />
<br />
“No...but that&#39;s not the point! You twisted her with you magic or whatever you use!”<br />
<br />
“That wasn’t my question. At any time during this process, was she sad?” The coachman pressed. He knew some of the donkeys panicked when they changed, but many of the boys and girls he brought here were so donkeylike on the inside that it was a smooth transition.<br />
<br />
“No. Clarisa wasn’t…. but that’s because she wasn’t herself, she wouldn’t have liked becoming an animal if she had all her senses together. Please turn her back. Please let us go.” Juliet pleaded with wet eyes.<br />
<br />
Clarisa wandered back over to Juliet. She was sad. “Heee haw!!!” Clarisa brayed to her, hoping to cheer her up. Juliet saw as Clarisa approached again braying.<br />
<br />
“What is it, Clarisa?” Juliet asked gently scratching her friends long ears as she stood beside her again.<br />
<br />
“She wants her friend to join her.” The coachman said. Clarisa brayed.<br />
<br />
“Think about it. You gals will live a carefree life...no school...no worries.”<br />
<br />
“I would rather have to worry the rest of my life before giving in to such a wrong thing!” Juliet said defiantly. <br />
<br />
The coachman was surprised by such a strong resisting will. Clarisa brayed again and gave her a lick on Juliet’s left hand face. Clarisa was distracted by short affectionate gesture of the donkey when the coachman moved closer.<br />
<br />
“Sometimes just a change of perspective helps to speed up the process!” He said pushing Juliet to the ground forcefully.<br />
<br />
The mean human shouldn’t have done that. Clarisa gave her a good buck with her hind hooves. Being mean to donkeys was not okay. She brayed at Juliet and gave her another lick in her face this time.<br />
<br />
A bit shocked by the sudden shove, Juliet remained on all fours. She took long deep breathes as the smell of grass entered her nose. <br />
<br />
The urges got stronger again and Juliet started munching it down.<br />
<br />
“My apologies, ladies. I’ve leave you two to your meals.” The coachman left Clarisa and Juliet alone. “Let’s these two stay in the pastures.” He whispered to a henchman as he walked away.<br />
<br />
Clarisa gave a contented bray as the strange donkey started eating. She joined her. Juliet&#39;s mind cleared up again. She wiped her mouth again and felt her now rubbery lips&#894;“No, pleeeeese no!” She cried out and tried to stand up again unsuccessfully.<br />
<br />
“Nooooo!!!. I don’t want to be a donkey!!! Heeee Haaaw! Heeee Haaaw!  Heeee Haaaw! Heeee Haaaw!”Juliet started braying, holding her stomach with a hand because it had started to bloat up, gray fur starting to grow and a black mane replaced her blond hair.<br />
<br />
Clarisa finally could understand some of the other donkey’s speech. She kept braying, hoping her herd mate would stop panicking and act like a sensible donkey.<br />
<br />
Juliet tried to stand but her legs wouldn’t let her She looked back seeing them shift in their proportions, toes shrinking and hooves forming.<br />
<br />
 “No I don’t waaaaant to!” Juliet’s body was changing faster and faster still she tried to resist. When her arms slowly started to shift into forelegs, pictures started to flood her mind, pictures of grazing, basking in the sun, running around….<br />
<br />
“No! why meeeeee! Her blouse and breasts ripped apart revealing gray fur growing on her back. <br />
<br />
But as much as Juliet tried it got harder to think and that grass looked so delicious. Juliet’s muzzle was finishing its growth, her human side diminished by the donkey consuming her old self. <br />
<br />
What did Juliet fight against? She didn’t know anymore. Her shorts ripped apart as her hips swelled, and the gray donkey took in the smells and sounds. Juliet smelled Clarisa.<br />
<br />
Clarisa brayed to her herd mate Then, she trotted into a strange lighted area. She smelled food there. Clarisa found a big bowl of salad on a table and dipped her muzzle in.<br />
<br />
While Clarisa was munching the vegetables, Juliet looked around and saw that the coachman was coming up to them.<br />
<br />
“Ah, you two. It looks like you&#39;re done. What are your names?” The coachman asked. The two donkeys looked up and brayed.<br />
<br />
“Ha ha ha! You two were donkeys before you ever got there.” He looked up to a henchman. “Take them to the pasture, they’ll help pull the carriage.”</p>
