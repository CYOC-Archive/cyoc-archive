<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Madam Astoria had loaned Isaac a looking glass and Isaac sat there looking at her reflection. In her cabin on the boat she had briefly glimpsed herself in the reflection of a silver plate, the closest thing to a mirror she had. That image had been rather distorted. Now seeing herself in the looking glass she could see why the Captain had called her a pretty lass and why the Madam had offered her employment in the brothel. <br />
<br />
Isaac&#39;s face was the embodiment of feminine beauty. Her skin was flawless, her nose was petite and her lips kissable. Interestingly her eye&#39;s were the same hazel colour as ever, just now with longer eye lashes and thin brows. Her hair was also the same dark brown colour as she had always had, just long and luscious and now held away from her face by whalebone hair pins the Madam had put in. <br />
<br />
Using the looking glass, Isaac examined her neck. Again her skin was flawless and she noticed the absence of the bump on her throat. That would explain why she now had a soft feminine voice. Previously because of his life on the open seas Isaac had developed a dark tan. Now her skin looked as though it had never been exposed to the sun.<br />
<br />
Also with the aid of the looking glass Isaac was able to see clearly the narrow waist she now possessed, that thanks to the corset and the fit of the dress, was on display. Also on display was the crack between Isaac&#39;s breasts. There was no denying that Isaac had a figure that would attract plenty of male attention. <br />
<br />
On a whim Isaac picked up the amulet that had unmanned her. She placed it around her neck then once more looked at her reflection. Isaac decided the jewellery made her look like a much prettier version of a duchess they had once captured. <br />
.......<br />
Isaac stayed in the Captain’s room not daring to venture anywhere as she was. She fretted about what she would do with her life. She had only known life as a pirate. Now that choice was denied to her. <br />
<br />
She contemplated her other choices. There was Madam’s offer to replace Annabelle, which she wasn’t that keen on. She had no desire for her new anatomy to be explored by men. The only other women Isaac knew well were the tavern wenches. She knew how they were treated by patrons. Isaac was guilty of groping the wenches as much as anybody. <br />
<br />
She knew there were other occupations for women, there were maids and cooks and gypsies but Isaac had met such women only rarely. Then there were nuns. Isaac had seen some of them once. They were on a boat the pirates had captured. The captain had not let the crew have their way with them and had released them unharmed. He said such women needed to be treated with respect. To be honest Isaac did not know what nuns did.<br />
<br />
Lastly there were what he termed honest women. She had seen what her former comrades had told him were honest women in the streets, often they had children in tow. Isaac guessed they were the mothers of the world and everyone had a mother. When he came across such women in the streets they would turn away and not meet his gaze or even cross to the other side of the road. He had learnt not to approach them. They were so timid. That life did not seem very appealing. Yet that was the life Annabelle had apparently chosen over working for Madam.<br />
<br />
Isaac tried to recall if she had ever met a female pirate. She had not. The captain was right in that a pirate ship was no place for a lass. And thinking of her reflection she could not deny that a lass she now was. She knew what happened to young woman found on boats they had captured. It was rare that the Captain spared them from the lusts of the crew. If they were lucky they survived to be sold to a brothel or slavery. The only exceptions were those women who convinced the captain they were worth more if ransomed such as the duchess or that time they had captured the nuns. <br />
<br />
Isaac eventually came out of her morbid ruminations and began to explore the Captain&#39;s room. She was grateful that the Captain had allowed her to stay here. There was a large comfortable looking bed and a desk against the wall. There was also a door leading out to a small private patio from which there was a view of the harbour. She could see the Crimson Pearl at anchor. Small boats were running to and from the vessel. Though it was too far away to recognise individual sailors. No doubt provisioning was underway. The boat was getting ready for it&#39;s next voyage - a voyage that Isaac sadly realised she would not be part of.</p>
