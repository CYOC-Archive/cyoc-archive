<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lillian was 6 years before her body was stolen, she went to school any morning, when she felt the hands of someone who covered her mouth with a cloth, the next thing she knew was that she was in the middle of the grass in some  rural road in the middle of the mountains, she didn&#39;t know how long she had been there, She only knew that she had to get out of there but without a body it was impossible, she screamed for help and when she thought that no one would listen to her and end her days in that lonely place the steps of an approaching person gave her hope.<br />
<br />
She called for help once more and a few minutes later a boy no older than 10 years appeared in his field of vision.<br />
<br />
-could you help me?  My body has been stolen and I don&#39;t know what to do.  - Said the little girl&#39;s head in despair, the boy evidently a small-town villager from a nearby town smiled.<br />
<br />
Of course I can help you - said the boy who took the girl&#39;s head with pigtails and walked into the thick forest.<br />
<br />
They walked about 20 minutes in which Lilian told her story, she had been kidnapped in California and when she talked to the boy named Mark, she learned that 10 days had passed and she was in the middle of Colorado.<br />
<br />
her body would surely be sold on the east coast and taken to some other country, it was not strange that those things happened her parents would always tell her stories about it so she knew that she would probably NOT see her original body again while she lived.<br />
<br />
sadly she accept his reality, although he would possibly meet his parents to get a new body would be very difficult, however Mark took Lilian to a clearing in the forest in which at one end the tall grass covered an object of great  size.<br />
<br />
when Mark got closer she could see that it was a car, a red car.<br />
<br />
She didn&#39;t recognize the Corvette, she just knew it was one of those convertible cars, she looked old, she was a model from ten years ago or a little more, inside she was in the driver&#39;s seat even with her hands on the steering wheel the body of a man.<br />
<br />
a very large man, excessively worked muscles were not something for beauty, not this body had been clearly trained for power, to have the greatest possible strength.<br />
The bodybuilder&#39;s body was comfortably seated, a layer of dust, dried tree leaves and brush covered the body, the car as well as the objects inside it.<br />
<br />
Mark looked at lilian and said - I don&#39;t know how (THE body)  he could survive so long here but I guess the tree protected him from the cold and the rain-<br />
<br />
-My father explained that this was the body of a university student, a Football player if I remember correctly.  A year ago he was driving on the highway near here when his head flew out, the boy was rich, so he only bought another body, while he was lost and abandoned here, many looked for him for months but I found him yesterday, I think he is  Your lucky day I was going to stay but I think you need it more.<br />
<br />
certainly it seemed a bit strange to lilian, she did not imagine herself in the body of a man of university age and even less such a giant.<br />
but a body was a body and he needed it to move and be able to return home.<br />
<br />
Mark got into the sports car on the passenger side, kindly cleaning the neck of the dirt that covered it and placing Lilian&#39;s head on the huge buff body. <br />
Instantly the body began to breathe softly and deeply.<br />
Lilian looked at Mark from his new and very high perspective and smiled, it took him a little time to numb his new body and even more to move it out of the car, checking with Mark the contents of the trunk found a lot of clothes and some personal items. <br />
As the clothes were very dirty, it would be best to change, however.  body needed a bath and something to eat, Mark offered to take Lilian to his house so he could cool off, with the help of Mark and the powerful body he now owned, Lilian was able to push the Corvette to Mark&#39;s house, there  Mark took out a can of gasoline and put it IN the tank of the sports car they washed and Lilian could eat until he satiated.<br />
however for lilian the complicated part began after arriving at Mark&#39;s house, the parents of the boy were not at home so lilian could undress.<br />
the body was huge in all aspects, a Nike sneakers of size seventeen, gray basketball shorts a white tank top, a long compression black pants and an jocktrap as underwear. <br />
<br />
the body was without counting the head easily 6&#39;8 tall and should weigh more than 250 pounds of Muscle. <br />
<br />
The body was perfectly the dream of any athlete or bodybuilder.<br />
<br />
it must have taken years to build it and lilian wondered what kind of person would be rich enough to be able to buy the same or better one without even worrying about recovering his original body.<br />
When Lilian took off her underwear and the soft male member was exposed (with the blonde pubic hair)  the little girl could not believe how big &quot;it&quot; was.<br />
Taking a bath was definitely a whole new experience.<br />
Big muscles,  much blonde hair in the body and a very high libido. <br />
All is completely different. <br />
When Mark brought him his clean clothes, he discovered that not only had he washed the clothes with which they found that body, also all the clothes inside the suitcases were clean.<br />
a little embarrassed and taking advantage of the fact that she was alone in the room lilian tried on the football uniform, she looked really impressive.<br />
also the helmet helped hide her head as a child.<br />
When Lilian was dressed very similar to how they had found that body, Lilian thanked Mark for the help but had to return home, Mark luckily knew how to drive the tractor like that and with that helped Lilian to be able to drive the sports car.<br />
Mark took all his time to teach him the basics of lilian who left Mark&#39;s house just minutes before his parents arrived, they never suspected anything Mark did but this was just the beginning, lilian was expecting a very  Long way to go home.  She had already lost a body and would not let it happen again, from that moment she promised herself that whatever happened would keep her new body.</p>
