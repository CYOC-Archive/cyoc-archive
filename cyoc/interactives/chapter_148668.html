<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After several hours as Jen recovered from the escaping attempt she decided to explore the castle. In order for this she decided to look for some paper and while doing this she reached the library where she found a small reconstruction of it along with lots of informations as on what is going out in there. She found out that the castle was supposed to be haunted by the ghost of a demonic-vampire princess. After finding that she gulped, she knew that it was her, so she decided to go along for the ride as it will be a great revenge on Kyle and so she did.<br />
She went and gathered all pieces of material in her house and tried her best to create a parachute, she also tested a theory of hers and proved that he gut of if she got out she will be conscious for a time and then she will be forced dragged into the castle where she will recover after a while, the time she was conscious equaled the distance from the castle and let say that now the castle really looked haunted with all the windows broken, she also found out that this does not apply to the inner garden and yard of the castle. this being said she dragged the pseudo parachute into the largest of the dungeon towers, smashed the windows and used the shutters to help her gain more distance, needles to say that by doing this she reached the town square which gave her some good 20 minutes until she were to be dragged back to the castle so she used this to go steal some money and &quot;buy&quot; a cell and a new number, and after this she called Kyle, but due to the voice mail getting in she delivered him this message: &quot;Kyle you dumb ass, you gave my castle a inner yard with a flower garden, a library and a way to get the perfect revenge on you?! How stupid were you? I found out that while on air the out of castle thing won&#39;t affect me and thanks for the huge main dungeon tower and dungeon, i would&#39;ve used the curse back but now i have other plans for you so stay tuned.&quot; After this the castle dragged her in and she went blank again.<br />
<br />
That evening she devised a plan, she WILL get all the cheerleader squad trapped inside the castle and will give them something extra, she thought of that after  she find a very interesting book in her library, an odd bestiary that contained all the mythical species described in it and also all the ones that the science discovered, actually she discovered that her library was actually enchanted to be a version of the Internet so she found a way to actually use that to her convenience. She called her second in command, Susan, to come to her house, because everyone not under the curse still saw the castle as a normal mansion, a thing she found out while jumping out on the windows, and instructed her to bring her cell phone with her and to trow it in first, as her old one was turned into a scepter and her new one become a comb.<br />
<br />
Before this however she decided to turn herself into the mistress of this castle. so she used to curse on herself to become the ghost of that demonic-vampire princess and so she ended up with four wings, a pair of succubi wings as well as her own arms becoming a separate pair of mutated bat wings with working hands at their tips, a pair of bat ears, 12 pairs of horns of which only the first was erect, the rest being curved around the ears, a long flowing crimson red mane of hair around her neck formed by her normal scalp hair and her chest turf that actually forms a collar around her neck and is joining the scalp hair on the back of her neck, a cut nose, basically only the bones of the nose really are there, sensual crimson lips, 4 pairs of fangs, bat like clawed feet, a hot and well toned/muscled figure, an extra feminine face, claws, slitted eyes and night vision, 6 pairs of huge sexual breasts that are concealed by her mane and make them look rather normal, big udder nipples on each of them and a dragon tail complete with the spade. She also, just for funnies, added an armor of scales on her skin only visible on her tail, face, breasts and members, the rest being hidden under the mane she has (that follows all of her curves and acts like an extra armor and could be considered a built in dress), the ability to produce pheromones, a complete male genitalia of a dragon, fire breathing and, as an extra touch, she split her personality between her after the curse and her before the curse. <br />
<br />
Her before the curse being the normal Jen that will only see the her old self in the mirrors while only seeing the monster Jen as a ghost or if the mirror will shift the image while the princess Jen gets in command also the old Jen won&#39;t understand what is happening and won&#39;t always be in charge, but when she will be in charge the whole castle will look like the town ans so she will not know what is actually happening. <br />
<br />
Her after the curse being the princess Jen that remembers everything and know what is happening, she can see either of the two of them and also create some weird optical illusions when getting in control when near mirrors, like appearing from any place of the room and merging with the old Jen in different ways that are the normal way some characters appear to be possessed in comics, movies and cartoons.<br />
<br />
When Susan arrived she immediately turned into a princess servant and her phone, even if thrown become a utensil used for working in the castle or for the princess&#39;s hygiene the moment she touched it, but Jen managed to use the curse on her and turned her into a herm werewolf that is always in the wolf form as for the dare she asked her to call the one that she hate the most from the squad except of Jen and after that to start becoming the role designated by the castle the first maid of the princess, her phone becoming an enchanted mirror.<br />
<br />
After Susan the rest were like this:<br />
 * Maya- dragon maiden- tower dungeon enforcer (her phone become a sword)<br />
 * Bianca- troll- dungeon tormentor (phone become a halberd)<br />
 * Alice- were cat- French maid (phone to duster)<br />
 * Carroll- dragon-born- head of servants (phone to broom)<br />
 * Liang Li- Monkey girl- jester (do i even need to state the jester hat?)<br />
 * Heater- gorgon- first officer of day guard (phone to mace)<br />
 * Kali- naga- guard commander (phone to gun actually)<br />
 * Lola- killer garden- gardener (phone actually became a rake)<br />
 * Chrisy- minotaur centaur- castle pet/ dungeon monster/ first milk maid/ stable chief ( her phone broke and become a collar,  a bridle, a battle ax and a bucket)<br />
 * Anne- gargoyle- first officer of night guard (phone to morningstar)<br />
 * Lucia- fish river mermaid/rusalky- first officer of sea monster guard (phone to trident)<br />
<br />
Again just for fun all of them were herms and her lovers and with each of the new addition the domain became bigger to the point it was a fortress on the hill outside the city and the house itself became located outside the city and took the appearance of a mansion with the only modification being the mansion fence and the hedge-maze situated in front of the main entrance, they were added like this:<br />
 * Susan added a wing for servants<br />
 * Maya added 5 more levels to the dungeon<br />
 * Bianca added a torture chamber<br />
 * Alice added a outdoor kitchen<br />
 * Carroll added a second wing for servants<br />
 * Liang Li added a gazebo<br />
 * Heater added statue alleyway<br />
 * Kali added barracks<br />
 * Lola added a royal garden complete with a hedge-maze <br />
 * Chrisy added stables and farm<br />
 * Anne added additional exterior and interior walls with walkways and bridges that made the castle to take the fortress image and separated the garden from the maze<br />
 * Lucia added a complex system of water trenches<br />
<br />
Now everything was ready to take revenge on Kyle after all the mistress needed a main partner and maybe add to the number of servants.</p>
