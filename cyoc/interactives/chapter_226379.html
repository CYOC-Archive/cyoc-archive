<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As his eyes trailed up and down the list, Jake realised that there were a number of &quot;adult&quot; options on there alongside the more &quot;respectable&quot; jobs. Cam performer. Escort. Stripper.<br />
<br />
His gaze settled on the last option as an image of a busty, sensually agile woman caressing a pole with her near-naked body flooded his mind. It took him a minute to shake it off, and by the time he had, his cock was pressing against his pants.<br />
<br />
He bit his lip. Strippers made good money, so he&#39;d heard. And he would get the reward of a smoking hot girl as a friend and room-mate. But could he really do that to Mike?<br />
<br />
<i>Yes,</i> whispered a voice.<br />
<br />
Well, it was certainly unusual. And Mike liked looking at women. It would be only fair to turn him into one. Right? And besides, he rationalised further, he could always revert Mike if he seemed unhappy.<br />
<br />
Before he could further question this logic, he clicked on the option. And was startled when another window popped up.<br />
<br />
The default sex for this occupation is female. Do you wish to change the target&#39;s sex?</i><br />
<br />
This provoked further lip-chewing. But the image of the busty, leggy bombshell resurfaced, gyrating in her skimpy outfit. <i>That could be Mike. That could be my room-mate.</i> His cock twitched mightily. <i>And nobody would ever know different.</i> He hit &quot;yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Another window, this one about the job.<br />
Years of Experience<br />
It was set to zero. Jake entered &quot;1&quot;; he figured it would be good if she knew what she was doing.<br />
Employment Status<br />
Apparently strippers were considered independent contractors, so he chose that.<br />
Venue(s)<br />
He felt a bit overwhelmed as he opened a drop-down list of various strip clubs. He chose the one nearest to the college, to make it easy for Mike to get to work. And maybe for him to go see her.<br />
<br />
That done, he was returned to the main screen, and he was now looking at a preview of a very different person. Mike was now Michelle, nickname Chelle... stage name Melodie.<br />
<br />
<i>Oh my god.</i><br />
<br />
His heart raced as he drank in the preview image, his cock straining uncomfortably in his pants. But she could be even better. Trembling, he altered some of the default stats.<br />
<br />
Age from 20 to 18, same as him. This triggered another pop-up, informing him that her experience as a stripper had been reduced from 1 year to 9 months. He stared, then face-palmed as he realised that she could only legally strip at 18. He decided to leave it this way.<br />
<br />
Hair from dirty blond to pure white, shoulder length.<br />
<br />
Eyes from nondescript hazel to ice blue. Glasses. No.<br />
<br />
Height from 5&#39;6&quot; to 5&#39;8&quot;; he liked taller girls.<br />
<br />
Cup size from D to DD... no... G.<br />
<br />
He had to take a breath to steady himself, and his hands still shook as he adjusted the sliders to mold the image into the perfect, long-legged, hourglass model in his mind&#39;s eye.<br />
<br />
He skimmed over the profile again. &quot;Relationship Status: Single.&quot; More lip chewing. He decided to leave it as-is. A chivalrous part of him felt that being her friend and room-mate was advantage enough; he should need to win her from there based on his own merits.<br />
<br />
Finally, at the bottom was &quot;Awareness.&quot; He set Mike to &quot;Unaware&quot; quickly, not wanting him to have to deal with adjustment to his radical new life. He hesitated a minute, then decided to set everyone to unaware, leaving only the User -- himself -- to know who Mike had been. He wondered briefly, just how powerful was this thing?<br />
<br />
Then he went over the little explanation that if not saved, the changes would revert in an hour. He took a deep breath. <i>Man, Mike, I&#39;m sorry but... it&#39;ll be fine...</i> Another breath. He looked at the preview image.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; he repeated aloud. &quot;It&#39;ll be fine. She&#39;s so hot.&quot;<br />
<br />
He hit Save.<br />
<br />
<center>~ ~ ~</center><br />
<br />
Mike was sitting on a warm bench in the quad, just finishing his own selection for spring classes. He was staring grimly at his laptop. Trying to psyche himself up for more job hunting. He desperately needed a job, even with a scholarship; his family wasn&#39;t wealthy and he wasn&#39;t eager to bury himself in student loans. But finding one to work around his studies wasn&#39;t proving easy, and after several rejections he felt he was running out of options.<br />
<br />
Then a chill went through him. Not unusual for early October. But the sudden wave of heat was. For a second he worried he was coming down with something. But then, in another second, his body thrilled to a sensation of change. He shifted as the heat became arousal, pooling in his groin and chest, an electric current running through his stomach as his cock twitched, and then began to compact. His balls lifted, shrinking as the pulled into<br />
<br />
<i>her</i>.<br />
<br />
Chelle shifted on the seat, raising a hand to stifle a moan as her rear plumped up, making the bench much more comfortable. Her boxers morphed into snug panties, which grew damp with the juice from her opening love tunnel, her balls burrowing up into her as they became young, fertile ovaries. Her stomach fluttered as her womb formed, feeling extremely empty as it settled among her other organs.<br />
<br />
She arched her back, tension releasing in a series of pops as her lanky form shrank from 6 feet to 5&#39;8&quot;, her shoulders drawing in and her hips pushing out. On her chest her breasts pushed out too, her nipples teneting her shift lewdly until a soft bra formed around them, <i>mostly</i> hiding them, though as her impressive mammaries filled into their full G-cup glory, even her custom bra couldn&#39;t completely hide her arousal.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile her buttoned shirt shifted to hug her expanded chest and narrower waist, the top button coming undo to show a tantalising hint of deep cleavage. Her slacks followed suit, becoming tight, skinny leather pants, her loafers turning into sleek black pumps.<br />
<br />
The vestiges of acne and five o&#39;clock shadow faded away as her skin become smooth and pale. Her lips plumped and acquired a glossy red coat, the makeup spreading over her feminising features, giving her a seductive look that was part aristocrat, part slut. Her eyebrows and then her hair bleached to a perfect white, her bangs framing her face while the rest of her luscious hair fell down between her shoulder blades. She blinked, closing hazel eyes to open sparkling light blue; her glasses disappearing, unneeded.<br />
<br />
It was but an eyeblink, really, for the tall slender nerd to fill out into the leggy bombshell. A moment of confusion as shy Mike&#39;s memories were reshaped and condensed into those of the younger, more confident and very female Chelle. A girl whose friends had taught her to be proud of her body, to rebel against her parents&#39; moralism and secretly get a job as a stripper directly out of high school.<br />
<br />
She inhaled as the changes settled, continuing to thrust out her chest, aware of the people staring at her, their own expressions changing from confusion at seeing a boy turn into a girl to lust and envy.<br />
<br />
<i>All the boys want me, all the girls want to fuck me.</i> A smile curved her full lips, even as she blushed lightly. <i>But <b>why</b> am I so horny all of a sudden? And --</i> She looked down at her laptop, confused. <i>Why am I looking at a fast food job?</i> She snorted. If she wanted to try something in addition to stripping, it would probably be camgirling. She certainly didn&#39;t need some minimum wage job when she had a body like this and the courage to use it.<br />
<br />
She closed the tab, then closed her laptop. Standing up, she began walking briskly back to the room she shared with Jake. Jake was a decent guy, maybe not her best friend since she&#39;d only known him since starting uni, but he seemed to sincerely care for her, and they shared a decent amount in common. Though he seemed weirdly unaware of the fact that he was living with a beautiful young woman.<br />
<br />
As she tried to ignore the moisture seeping through her panties and the pressing of her fat nips against the silk of her bra, she couldn&#39;t help but think on that. She was grateful he was a gentleman, she supposed, but on the other hand... surely he couldn&#39;t be immune to her body?<br />
<br />
<i>Maybe he&#39;s gay?</i><br />
<br />
She frowned at the thought. She herself was bi. Unlike Mike, who had done his best to ignore his interest in other boys, she was open about it, even offering to share her Playboy magazines with Jake. He had seemed... what? Flustered? Was it because he was a prude, or because he didn&#39;t swing that way?<br />
<br />
<center>~ ~ ~</center><br />
<br />
Jake was in fact very interested in Chelle&#39;s body. He couldn&#39;t tear his eyes away from the image in the profile, and closed the &quot;Changes Complete&quot; pop-up with a huff even as he recognised what it meant. It just fuelled his desire and his need to look at that sexy goddess until his eyes could feast on the real thing.<br />
<br />
His hand was just sneaking down to open his fly, in fact, when he heard the door opening. He jumped guiltily, snatching his hand back as if the warmth in his loins had burned him. He turned to the door, realised who it was, and promptly swiveled away again, desperately wishing for his boner to die down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Jake!&quot; called a voice. A happy, feminine, slightly sultry voice that made his dick clench. Damn she even <i>sounded</i> hot. &quot;I finished choosing my credits and thought we could, um, hang out for a bit. Unless you&#39;re busy?&quot;</p>
