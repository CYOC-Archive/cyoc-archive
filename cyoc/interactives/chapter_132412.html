<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><b>Author&#39;s note: I&#39;d like someone to do the conversion of the new GGAC members soon. I&#39;d do it, but I don&#39;t know enough about the Chaotic card game to make any references to it, let alone know which characters they&#39;re supposed to represent.</b><br />
<br />
While many people had asked for Project Hermaphroditus, not everyone could get in. There was extensive screening to do before they could be considered. Naturally, they had to eliminate those of a potentially criminal or psychotic nature. The last thing they wanted was a herm rapist. But beyond that, they needed to see if the candidates were really of a transsexual nature or was just sexually confused about themselves. It has been known for some people who thought they were transsexual to go halfway through hormone therapy only to fall into a deep depression until the therapy was reversed. And since the Animalian Virus cannot be reversed, the scientists had to make sure the people going through with it wouldn&#39;t live to regret it.<br />
<br />
Eventually, Dr. Jones helped narrowed the selection down to six people who could be the first to be hermaphrodized. All of them had been transsexuals who tried to go through sex reassignment surgery. However, because of various factors such as disapproval from others or lack of medical insurance and/or money, they had to resort to less legal means to have their sex changed. There were some &#39;back alley doctors&#39; who were willing to look the other way when it came to surgeries that weren&#39;t on level with the law. There was a &#39;surgery center&#39; that specialized in sex reassignment surgery for those who couldn&#39;t get it normally.<br />
<br />
However, doing things illegally often increases the risks more than usual. For instance, the black market surgeons weren&#39;t quite as competent was legally-licensed doctors, which was the main reason they were working in the black market in the first place. The six people who had come to the &#39;surgery center&#39; had been, quite frankly, butchered. While sex reassignment surgery is not smooth and easy, the quacks who had been working on them did an obviously sloppy job, making it near impossible for themselves to look at their bodies, let alone anyone else. Of course, they couldn&#39;t just go to the police with this, as they would be arrested for paying for this illegal procedure. Not to mention the &#39;kingpin&#39; who ran this surgery ring had several friends, the kind of friends who are either influential or had guns. The &#39;patients&#39; wouldn&#39;t be able to rat him out that easily.<br />
<br />
Thankfully, Animalia was a lot more understanding that most of the country. Not to mention it had a good connection with responsible government figures and had considerable teams in the form of the police force and the Rhino Squad. Not only would the &#39;patients&#39; have amnesty here, but they could be converted to be closer to their ideal. One of them was even willing ready to reveal where the surgery ring was located and who was running in exchange for a new identity. This was easily enough done.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
The two people who came to the clinic did have a bit of androgynous look to them. While one of them had a pair of breasts and the other didn&#39;t, it was easy to tell who was a man first and who was a woman. The former woman was short, had sandy blonde hair that was hacked off to appear more boyish. The former man was taller, black, and was wearing a wig to look more womanly, but it was not very convincing. Judy was there to meet them as they walked. &quot;Thank you for coming,&quot; said Judy, &quot;We would bring the others along, but we wanted to see how successful this particular conversion technique is before they proceed with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not gonna hurt, is it?&quot; asked the former man, who looked like he had seen too much pain already.<br />
<br />
&quot;No. If anything, it&#39;ll be enjoyable,&quot; said Judy, &quot;And these are the people who are going to help you through your conversion.&quot; She lead them inside to where Akia and Goldenrod were waiting. The two of them were dressed, but the bulges in their shorts showed how aroused they were. &quot;These are Akia and Goldenrod,&quot; introduced Judy.<br />
<br />
Akia walked over to them and looked both of the people over. They were both a little overwhelmed by this large hyena standing so close. Shi sniffed them both before asking, &quot;Which one of you is wanting to expose the people who scarred you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, that would be me,&quot; said the former woman.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, wanting to strike back at who harmed you. I like that, shows you&#39;ve got a predator&#39;s spirit,&quot; said Akia before turning to Judy, &quot;I&#39;ll take this one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Akia, you can&#39;t just claim someone,&quot; said Judy, &quot;They have to be willing, to actually want this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s ok,&quot; said the former woman, &quot;I actually don&#39;t mind. I like hyenas.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akia gave a grin and said, &quot;I&#39;m liking you more already. Goldenrod, you okay with the other?&quot;<br />
<br />
Goldenrod walked over and said, &quot;I think I can work with this one. What do you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
The former man was looking at Goldenrod&#39;s breasts with obvious envy. &quot;If I&#39;ll end up looking like you, I don&#39;t mind at all,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, if that&#39;s settled, you can go on to the changing rooms,&quot; said Judy.<br />
<br />
With that, Akia and Goldenrod led their two guests off to different rooms. When Akia went into hir room, shi closed the door and said, &quot;So, they tell me you want a new identity to go with your new body. Do you have a name in mind?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was thinking Kicheko,&quot; said the former woman, &quot;That&#39;s the Swahili word for &#39;laughter&#39;, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You do know that hyenas don&#39;t laugh for the same reason as humans,&quot; said Akia, &quot;I mean, I have a good sense of humor, but I don&#39;t laugh all the time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you think of a better name for a hyena?&quot; asked &#39;Kicheko&#39;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not off the top of my head,&quot; said Akia.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;s the name of my fursona and I want to stick with it,&quot; said &#39;Kicheko&#39;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not gonna ask what that means,&quot; said Akia.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, do you need to give me a shot or what?&quot; asked &#39;Kicheko&#39;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, the scientists think that direct exposure to me can hermaphrodize any human who hasn&#39;t been converted yet,&quot; said Akia, &quot;They did some blood tests to see if that would work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure it&#39;ll work?&quot; asked &#39;Kicheko&#39;.<br />
<br />
&quot;I drank out of two bowls of water and that changed me,&quot; said Akia.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, so what do we do?&quot; asked &#39;Kicheko&#39;.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you think?&quot; asked Akia with a smirk as shi pulled off hir shirt and unclipped hir bra. Hir breasts bounced as they were released. &quot;Plenty of milk,&quot; said Akia, hefting up one breasts.<br />
<br />
&#39;Kicheko&#39; was a little mesmerized by the full, furry breast. But it didn&#39;t take long for her to cross the distance and latch onto the hyena&#39;s nipple. Akia gave a small croon as shi felt milk being drawn out. These breasts were a lot more sensitive than hir old teats. The changes soon became apparent on &#39;Kicheko&#39;. Tawny fur was appearing on her visible skin and her clothes were quickly becoming too small. Seams ripped open as she swelled in size. Her surgically-removed breasts returned with a vengeance, bursting open her shirt front as they swelled to meet Akia&#39;s size. Eventually, the front of her pants started to bulge, much larger than they should. Akia noticed the prodding against hir leg and reached down to rip off those pants. The changing human gasped as a hyena cock sprang out, balls dropping into place as the rebuilt vagina oozed with readiness.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now you really are Kicheko,&quot; said Akia with approval, smelling the near-hyena&#39;s musk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Almost,&quot; said Kicheko, who was halfway between human and hyena, &quot;I need to finish off. And I feel so horny.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you&#39;re in luck,&quot; said Akia before shi dropped hir own pants. Shi turned to face the bed, lifting hir tail up to show hir own slick pussy. &quot;I&#39;ve been really wanting to try this thing out,&quot; said Akia, &quot;It seems a lot easier than what I had before. Care to put your new dick to the test?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kicheko grinned, showing sharpening teeth. &quot;How can I resist?&quot; shi asked. Shi approached Akia from behind. Shi had to stand on tiptoe to make hir cock touch Akia&#39;s pussy. It helped that hir feet were becoming paws and hir legs were getting longer. Kicheko plunged, causing both herm hyenas to moan. As Kichecko kept thrusting, hir hyena traits were finishing up. Shi was standing as tall as Akia, hir muscles growing to match hirs. The tawny fur covered in spots was now all over hir body and hir small bushy tail had fully grown. Reaching around, Kicheko gripped Akia&#39;s breasts with hir claw-bearing hands. As Akia moaned, Kicheko licked hir neck with hir longer tongue. Hir own neck was growing out more as well as hir ears. Hir gasps and cries were taking on a higher pitch, almost sounding like laughter as hir face pushed out into a hyena&#39;s. With a final thrust, hir new penis ejaculated for the first time, making Akia&#39;s vagina react with more pleasure than shi ever felt before. Both of them let out a cry as they came together.<br />
<br />
Eventually, Kicheko pulled out of Akia and looked at hir new self in the mirror. Shi was practically everything shi imagined hir hyena persona being. Shi was tall, buff, and incredibly sexy. While shi was attracted to females, shi had felt incomplete without a penis of hir own. Now shi had one that was long and stiff, even after just going off. Reaching back, shi felt the restored vagina that had been destroyed by those incompetent back alley surgeons. The main difference between hirself and Akia was that Kichecko still had her sandy blonde hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looking like a real hyena,&quot; said Akia, stepping up behind Kicheko and giving hir ass a squeeze.<br />
<br />
&quot;And feeling better than ever,&quot; said Kicheko, &quot;You think the others are enjoying themselves?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, they still are,&quot; said Akia. Kicheko perked hir new ears and shi could hear two voices whinnying not too far from here. &quot;Well, this style of conversion definitely works,&quot; said Akia, &quot;I can&#39;t wait to share it with the other two people.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kicheko grinned, hir dick getting rock hard again. &quot;I think I&#39;d like to help with that,&quot; shi said with a giggle.</p>
