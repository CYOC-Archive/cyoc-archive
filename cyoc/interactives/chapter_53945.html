<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You quickly get up and follow the guy dumping your own tray on the way. You're convinced that he has some idea of what's going happening to you. If nothing else you now believe that you're not the only one changing. Once you get out into the hall though you don't see him. Picking a direction you start walking hoping that you picked the right direction.<br />
<br />
You turned a corner and suddenly stopped as you see Rose standing there looking like she was waiting for you. &quot;Uh... Hi Rose,&quot; you said trying to cover your surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come with me,&quot; Rose simply said then turned around and started walking down the hall.<br />
<br />
You followed her since you were already going that way. Once you caught up to her you asked, &quot;Where are you taking me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll see,&quot; Rose said as she continued to walk.<br />
<br />
That answer didn't exactly fill you with confidence but you continued to follow her anyway. She turned into the health/sex-ed classroom and you were surprised to see the guy and another girl already there. Rose introduced you to James and Mary. &quot;There's two minutes left until lunch is over,&quot; Mary said once the introductions were done.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then we'll need to disappear,&quot; Rose said grabbing your arm.<br />
<br />
Mary grabbed James' arm and touched a pendant she was wearing. You watched as both of them just faded out of sight. &quot;What the hell happened?&quot; you asked shocked. &quot;Where did they go?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The same place we are,&quot; Rose said reaching up to touch the pendant she was wearing. You felt a chill run through you along with a tingling sensation and James and Mary faded back into sight. &quot;Now we can talk without being interrupted,&quot; Rose said letting go of your arm.<br />
<br />
Just then the bell rang and you said, &quot;We need to get to class.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There's no need,&quot; Rose said, &quot;no one will notice that you're gone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I'm not suppose to be in here this period,&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
Mary smiled and said, &quot;That doesn't matter since no one will see us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How can anyone not see us?&quot; James asked seeming to be more at ease than you.<br />
<br />
&quot;We're out of phase with them,&quot; Mary said hopping up onto the teacher's desk.<br />
<br />
&quot;This means that they won't see us and won't be able to touch us,&quot; Rose said also hopping up onto the teacher's desk. &quot;If you don't believe me just see what happens when Mr. Teller comes in.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just as she finished speaking Mr. Teller came in and went to his desk seemingly not seeing any of them. He did frown and said, &quot;Those kids are trouble.&quot; You figured that he had seen you but he reached through Rose and picked up a dildo.<br />
<br />
When Mr. Teller had his hand in her Rose squirmed and giggled. She calmed down and said, &quot;When any part of a living person passes through us it tingles.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You really enjoy the tingles in your groin,&quot; Mary said smiling at Rose.<br />
<br />
&quot;So do you,&quot; Rose said lightly shoving Mary. Turning her attention back to you and James she said, &quot;I'm sure you two have some questions and I'll answer them if I'm able to,&quot; as other students began to file into the class room and take their seats. &quot;Now you both wished for school to become more interesting this morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I only wished for math to be more interesting,&quot; you said. &quot;And if we both wished it this morning how come I remember James as always being like he is?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's because James wished it on the way to school,&quot; Mary said. &quot;Once things were set in motion with him everyone who had at least seen him and weren't like us or in the process of becoming like us had their memories slowly altered.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what are you?&quot; James asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We're guardians,&quot; Rose said. &quot;There are entities that reside in this space. Most of them are harmless but there are some that aren't. We fight those that try to harm people.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How can something from here harm anyone?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
Before either Rose or Mary could answer a little girl walked through the wall and said, &quot;Hello.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is Isabella,&quot; Rose said waving at the girl. &quot;She died in 1820 and has been here since.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She's a ghost,&quot; Mary said, &quot;and a playful one at that. She's the one responsible for most of the pencils dropping on the floor around school.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's a waste of energy to drop all those pencils,&quot; Rose said.<br />
<br />
Isabella folded her arms and said, &quot;It was also a waste of energy to braid his hair.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can replace at least most of it when I sleep since I'm still alive,&quot; Rose said. &quot;You on the other hand have to siphon some energy from people.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Doesn't that harm people?&quot; James asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I only take a little from each person,&quot; Isabella said defending herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;The worst that happens with Isabella siphoning energy from people is that they feel just a little bit more tired at the end of the day,&quot; Rose said. &quot;People usually replace that energy when they sleep.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you touch things if you go right through them?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's relatively easy,&quot; Mary said smiling. &quot;Everything has an energy matrix and it's this energy matrix that you manipulate which translates to the physical. It takes a lot of concentration and some energy to do it though which you won't be able to do at this stage of your transformation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean we'll become girls?&quot; James said and by the look on his face was just as shocked as you.<br />
<br />
&quot;That isn't guaranteed,&quot; Rose said raising a hand. &quot;For awhile you'll remain as you are, feminine looking boys. If you can adjust to what you are now then you'll finish changing and become guardians. If you can't then you'll be transformed back to your old selves with your memories intact. I have to warn you that if you don't make an effort to adjust you'll be transformed into a baby girl with almost no memory of your life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you been changing us?&quot; James asked with maybe a little fear in his voice.<br />
<br />
Rose and Mary laughed for several minutes. After they calmed down Mary said, &quot;We don't have the power to do that. All we did was make sure to switch your old boy clothes with feminine ones that fit. Well Rose braided your hair.&quot; She said this last looking right at you.<br />
<br />
&quot;So who's changing us?&quot; you asked feeling a little bit afraid.<br />
<br />
Rose shrugged and said, &quot;We don't know. The ones that trained us didn't know either.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Were you two always girls?&quot; James asked surprising you but the answer surprised you even more.<br />
<br />
&quot;We were both men before our change,&quot; Rose said. &quot;I used to be Rick and Mary used to be Mike. I was 34 when I was transformed and Mary was 90.&quot;<br />
<br />
You were stunned at this. It took awhile for you to snap out of your stupor and it was the bell that did it. Once everyone was out of the classroom you said, &quot;So Mary was really old.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was but now I'm eternally young,&quot; Mary said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; James asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well our job is to protect this school and it's students and faculty from some of the nasties here,&quot; she said sighing. &quot;In order to do this we don't get any older and repeat the same grade every year. At least we do get to take other classes each year.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do we have to become guardians?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well if you are able to adjust to your new life you will become guardians,&quot; Mary said. &quot;You will remain guardians for a year at the end of which you may withdraw. If you do you'll remain a girl but you'll grow older and be able to have children. If you remain a guardian you'll be one for another ten years before you have the chance to leave again. It goes in five year increments after that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How long have you been guardians?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've been one for a year and a half,&quot; Mary said.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I've been one for two years,&quot; Rose said. &quot;Now it's time to begin your training in earnest but first we need to give you your guardian pendants.&quot; Rose took a necklace and pendant out of her pocket and placed it around your neck. Mary did the same with James. Once you and James had your pendants Rose said, &quot;All you have to do to shift between here and the physical is to press the gem in your pendant. Try not to shift in front of anyone since it will really confuse them. Of course the exception to this is you can shift in front of a guardian or one that had been a guardian.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have another question,&quot; you said. &quot;Are all guardians girls?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All guardians are female,&quot; Mary said. &quot;There are guardians as young as six and as old as 40.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rose nodded and said, &quot;I'm the senior guardian assigned here since I've been one longer. You'll be part of my team if you become guardians. I do want your opinions but I have the final say in matters pertaining to our job.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you going to recruit another one?” Isabella asked. You jumped a bit having forgotten about her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would like another one but it's up to whatever transforms us,&quot; Rose said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You said you didn't change us,&quot; James said.<br />
<br />
&quot;But we didn't say that we didn't pick you,&quot; Mary said. &quot;Rose saw that you two were bored most of the time and was just waiting for you to wish for something more interesting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have another guy in mind to add,&quot; Rose said. &quot;He just has to wish for something more interesting and then whatever transforms us has to agree to transform him. But enough of that for now. We need to start training you. Mary will train James and I'll train you. Isabella will help out at times as will others that dwell here. Now let’s begin.&quot;</p>
