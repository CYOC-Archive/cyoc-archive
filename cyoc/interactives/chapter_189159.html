<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Looking back down at Aidan, still on all fours just above his cum puddle, Mark set his first command with an evil smirk. “Aidan, lick up your cum puddle.”<br />
As he anticipated, Aidan, after getting his breathing under control, said: “No, I won´t be your slave. I won´t do as you say.”<br />
Mark´s smirk grew a bit. It would be boring if it was too easy, after all. “You can choose to do so, okay. But than I will just have to show you the consequences. Let´s see, activate punishment stage one.” It was the smallest punishment, but would already be highly unpleasant for Aidan.<br />
Aidan, still on all fours, yelped as the pressure on all his limbs, as well as his neck, increased. The first stage of punishment increased the weight by ten percent, made the bracers a bit tighter, and heated them up for five degrees. The cock-ring and the butt-plug had no settings in it. He looked up at Mark, pleading with his eyes to stop this.<br />
Mark still smirked at the discomfort Aidan showed with the punishment, and waited a minute to see if Aidan would do his task now. As he didn´t, Mark repeated his command: “Aidan, lick up your cum puddle. Now. Or do you want a harder punishment?”<br />
Aidan didn´t move his head down to lick up the cum, but Mark could see he was wavering already. Still, Aidan shook his head no, showing he wouldn´t do Mark´s biding.<br />
“Okay, suit yourself than. Activate punishment stage two.” Mark stated. He wanted to see how long Aidan would resist. The second stage again increased the weight, this time by twenty percent, and the temperature by another five degrees. It also made the bracers tighter again, slowly cutting into Aidan´s flesh. The cock-ring tightened a bit as well, while the butt-plug expanded inside of his ass.<br />
Aidan yelped louder this time, then moaned in light pain. He had never been good in handling pain, and this was already a torture for him. He started to sweat from the increased heat, making his arms and legs itch under the bracers. But he couldn´t scratch through the bracers, making it even worse. Still, he wouldn´t do Mark´s biding. When Mark repeated his command, he again shook his head no.<br />
Mark let out a sigh for show, enjoying Aidan´s defiance. It would make breaking him far better. “You still want more? Good, then activate punishment stage three.”<br />
This time, Aidan didn´t yelp, but scream at the raising pressure on his limbs. It was now a painful pressing, and with another five degrees added, it felt like Mark wanted to burn his body away under the bracers and the collar. At the same time, the weight increased again, this time by thirty percent, making them heavier than when Mark first put them on his limbs. It was hard to even move his hands at the moment, the high weight making it feel like lifting a few hundreds kilo to Aidan. Also, like before, the cock-ring shrunk, tightening around his base painfully, while the plug got even bigger, and Aidan was sure he would burst open by that thing soon. From the collar, Aidan was unable to lift his head anymore, it had forced his head down to the ground, making his position rather uncomfortable.<br />
Mark watched the now whimpering and shivering form of Aidan for another minute, already getting hard by all that. It made him realize what Aidan´s next command would be, if he soon complied. If not, well, than he would have some more licking to do than now.<br />
“Now, still unwilling to follow my order, Aidan? Do you need even more punishment or do you finally lick your cum up?” Mark asked him after waiting another few minutes in silence.<br />
Aidan, still unable to move, knew he had to give up. If Mark made these punishments any worse than it was right now… He feared it would kill him. With a heavy mental sigh, Aidan answered, sounding breathless: “Okay, but I can´t move right now, the gold is too heavy.”<br />
Mark grinned down at Aidan. “Good, I will make the gold lighter, but not ease the rest, until you have licked your cum up, Aidan. Decrease weight of gold by fifty percent.”<br />
Aidan sighed as he could raise his head again. He couldn´t rub his neck through the collar, so he couldn´t help his sore neck right now. With a last pleading look to Mark, Aidan bowed back down and started to slowly lick at the already drying puddle of cum by his feet.<br />
Mark watched Aidan work, feeling his own cock throb and tent in his jeans. If Aidan worked any slower now, he would be showered in Mark´s cum. He had already opened his belt and now tugged down his jeans a bit. It released some of his own pressure, but it wouldn´t be long until he came.<br />
Aidan, in all the disgust he had felt before, felt that he liked the taste of his own cum. It made him work a bit faster, also hoping that Mark would make everything normal again after he finished.<br />
As soon as the floor was clean of his cum, Aidan raised up two all fours. With the pressure on his limbs, he wouldn´t attempt to stand up, and he had no idea what Mark would do now. As he saw Mark´s cock hanging out of his jeans, he paled.<br />
Mark smirked down at Aidan, and laughed as he turned white in fear. “Good work. But now, before I release your other punishments, I want you to suck me off. You can refuse if you want, but then you will have to lick up my cum next.”<br />
Aidan had already feared this, but he also knows he can´t really refuse. Even if Mark didn´t punish him for not sucking him, he would have to lick the cum up. So, with much reluctance as he could, Aidan slowly lowered his mouth over Mark´s cock, before taking it in. It wasn´t as bad as he thought.<br />
Mark enjoyed Aidan sucking him off. While he felt Aidan´s lack of experience, he didn´t do a bad job with him. It didn´t take long for him to cum, right into Aidan´s mouth. Aidan did swallow it all, and Mark guessed he had realized he would have to lick up the extra cum if he didn´t do so.<br />
When no more cum came, Aidan wanted to move away, but Mark held his hands around Aidan´s head, keeping him in place. “That was … nice Aidan. But I need something else now, sorry.” It hadn´t been his intention, but if Aidan left his cock now, there would be another mess to clean up. With a relaxed sigh, Mark let his bladder loose, pissing down Aidan´s throat.<br />
Aidan, upon realizing what would come, tried to struggle, but couldn´t escape. He was forced to drink Mark´s piss, only lucky it didn´t run over his tongue. He hadn´t had to taste the piss. Only the very last few drops, when Mark finally released his head, landed there, making him gag.<br />
Mark looked down at the gagging Aidan, and petted his head. “You did good, Aidan. I´m sorry for that last bit, but if I hadn´t kept you there, you would have showered in my piss, something I didn´t want you to endure. Now, as you did your tasks, activate neutral state.”<br />
At once, Aidan, still gagging, sighed as the pressure on his limbs, neck and cock vanished and the metal cooled down. While he wanted to beat the shit out of Mark for this shit, he didn´t thought he would be able to right now. So, with a second relaxed sigh, Aidan just sunk back onto his legs, slowly raised up and after a few steps crashed down onto his couch, asleep in seconds.</p>
