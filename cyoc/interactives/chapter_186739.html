<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lars Olsen thought he was the biggest star in the whole school, and to a degree, he was right. The blond, incredibly well muscled jock was head of the Varsity Football Team, AND the captain of the wrestling team, and on top of all that he maintained one of the most attractive bodies out there. Eighteen and he already had a slew of lovers. Which it seems is where the problem began. Lars, with his silky blond hair and bright blue eyes, slightly tanned skin and muscled build, was used to people being attracted to him. And thus he went out of his way to attain what he saw as his natural due.<br />
<br />
As far as his latest girlfriend had known, Lars was straight as could be - and he never once let her know that anything was different about him.<br />
<br />
As far as his latest boyfriend had known, Lars was &quot;just closeted gay&quot;, and his girlfriend was a beard he needed to have to maintain his status and position. Which he alleged was in jeopardy due to how &quot;jock culture worked&quot;.<br />
<br />
Ethan Maines and Clarissa Downe, thus, had no reason to suspect what was really going on. Lars however was simply using both for pleasure. When he couldn&#39;t quite scratch an itch with Clarissa, he went ahead and got Ethan on board to help him out. And the Swedish bodybuilding jock would&#39;ve gotten away with it if it wasn&#39;t for Clarissa realizing something was up and talking with Ethan about it.<br />
<br />
They decided something had to change before Lars could move on to college and potentially do worse by others.<br />
<br />
Clarissa managed to find a strange little necklace or collar of some sort that she heard from the person she bought it from at &quot;Spells R Us&quot; that it should give Lars an attitude adjustment. She didn&#39;t know how much she could trust that, but her family came from a Wiccan tradition, so she was inclined to believe. Ethan was not as quick to believe, but after a talk with her - and seeing Lars looking ready to move on to his next target - he decided to try and help her out in doing whatever she saw necessary to punish the cheater.<br />
<br />
Neither really knew what effect the collar would have on Lars. Or others that he might have contact with. Because the collar&#39;s effect was simple yet more than what they anticipated. Over the course of a month, it would change Lars from a human young man into a German Shepherd dog - and due to the magic involved, the transformation would spread - and conduct itself at a similar speed with anyone he engaged sexually with.<br />
<br />
Perhaps they should&#39;ve researched their purchase.<br />
<br />
----------<br />
<br />
Lars Olsen thought it would be just another excellent day for him. He finished football practice at the end of school, looking at his reflection in the wall mounted mirror in the locker room with deep satisfaction. He had sculpted his body to a great degree for aesthetic appreciation AND function. His pectorals, sweltering, were complimented by his sizable boulder shoulders, a simple flex showed his 19 or 20 inch biceps, and strong forearms as well. A shift in position to accentuate his eight pack abs. Fuck yes. Lars turned and flexed his glutes and thighs. The boys went wild for his ass.<br />
<br />
And Lars loved it so much. The women loved the upper body, while his male admirers enjoyed his ass and legs. He ran a hand through his silky long blond hair. It also didn&#39;t hurt he was objectively gorgeous. Fuck but Lars could never bring himself to commit. Not to one person, neither to one gender.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Lars, you just gonna stand there posing to yourself all day?&quot; Rudy Garlant shouted from his seat near the lockers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck you man, let a dude enjoy himself.&quot; Lars answered, and grinned before heading over to his locker to get dressed. Clarissa wanted to see him today for another of their sexual sessions. He looked at Rudy. He&#39;d have to be blind not to see the homoerotic undertones in some of their interactions. Rudy always minded what Lars was doing, claimed he was just looking out for him - but the strong undercurrent of jealousy was impossible to miss. Lars knew he was driving Rudy up the wall with how much he did this, but the dark haired jock was gonna need to openly approach him if he wanted a little man on man time.<br />
<br />
And it seemed Rudy, with his girlfriend involved, was not willing to admit he might be a bit more towards gay. Could be the dark haired jock&#39;s religious upbringing. Could be his parents micromanaging his affairs. But at any rate, Lars just liked seeing how far he could push Rudy before things got to a head. Not that Rudy Garlant was unattractive - his bushy, disorganized dark hair, light green eyes, and somewhat pale tan, together with his stocky, muscular body, gave him quite an impression.<br />
<br />
Lars honestly wanted to have Rudy set up under him, and then just enjoy Rudy&#39;s dick up Lars&#39; ass. But until Rudy was willing to go through with approaching him, Lars saw fit to deny him that pleasure.<br />
<br />
Going to his locker, ignoring Rudy&#39;s lingering gaze on his ass, Lars got dressed in a polo shirt, tight black boxer shorts, jeans, and his boots. Followed by pulling his denim jacket on. Lars then walked out, a calm smile on his face. He looked forward to whatever Clarissa saw fit to give him. School was done, and thus, it was time for some fun.<br />
<br />
He approached her at their usual place - the study rooms by the library. The librarian, an old woman in her eighties, never bothered to lock them, and never checked them after school. Thus making them into the perfect make out spot. A few times he &quot;caught&quot; Rudy and his girlfriend here, too. He entered his usual room, Room 13, and immediately grinned when he saw Clarissa. She was as usual his brunette beauty, athletic and gifted with great endowments.<br />
<br />
Rudy locked the door behind him offhandedly, and approached her. &quot;I hear you had something to give me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know,&quot; Clarissa seemed nervous today, and she said, &quot;The other guys at school are talking about you. And how you pay so much attention to your body...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Babe, I am straight as can be. Not once has my eye glanced on any guy in a sexual way.&quot; Lars lied with a smile on his face. His dates didn&#39;t need to know about what he did on his own time.<br />
<br />
She seemed to accept this and smiled broadly, as if this was a good enough answer for something she&#39;d been considering. She moved toward Lars and started helping him take his polo and jacket off. Ah, so she wanted to see his body. Not that he blamed her. He flexed for her appreciation, though she didn&#39;t make any appreciative noise - which slightly bothered Lars. Then he felt her moving to open his jeans up, and he got what she wanted.<br />
<br />
He breathed and controlled himself as he felt his sizable, eight inch cock at full erection getting sucked on. Lars&#39; eyes never glanced down at his girlfriend, no, his eyes went elsewhere. A window looking out at the field outside. A window sufficiently reflective enough... Lars flexed and enjoyed the sight of his muscled arms, shoulders, and chest. Even as his girlfriend gave him a blowjob. He didn&#39;t exactly notice it was more performative today, less enthusiastic, so into himself was he.<br />
<br />
He enjoyed the blowjob as a validation as it was of how beautiful and buff he was.<br />
<br />
Of course everyone - male and female both - wanted him. He was Lars Olsen. He was the best looking guy on the team. And he was hardly done screwing his way through life. Maybe in college, he&#39;d fuck the coach to get a starring position. Everybody wanted Lars. He was entirely in love - with himself. He flexed again, and fuck his cock was throbbing. His muscles tense and dance for his eyes. He hoped that silly woman sucking him off was enjoying the sight.<br />
<br />
Because once Lars had a rich enough girlfriend, she&#39;d be old news.<br />
<br />
Ohh fuck, he thought as he flexed his wide lats and shoulders right then and there. He was getting such great results! Lars gulped as he felt himself getting closer - too close! - and he grunted, &quot;I&#39;m so fucking sexy, I&#39;m gonna c-cum!!&quot; It was a flex of his biceps - not any deed by Clarissa - that did it for him. He let her back off and simply fired his seed off - the cum staining the floor and the area in front of her, a little of it getting on her shirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Haah...hah...babe, I loved how good you did that,&quot; Another Lars lie, &quot;We have got to do some missionary...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...think something came up,&quot; Clarissa said with apparent regret. &quot;As much as I&#39;d love to do a bit more...I do have a gift for you, though.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lars felt tremendously let down, but he was always good with the idea of getting a gift from his lovers. It would solidify the feeling that they were together. Rather than that Lars was entirely devoted to himself, as was the actual case. &quot;Let me see it, babe! I&#39;m always good with getting a present.&quot; He expected it to be something sexier, but instead she retrieved what looked like some kind of collar. It was pretty ornate - he guessed that was expertly made leather, genuine silver... wow! Where did this woman get THIS for him?<br />
<br />
&quot;You didn&#39;t have to spend a lot on me, you know,&quot; Lars said with a coy grin. Of course he&#39;d prefer it, though.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I didn&#39;t really pay much for that...&quot; Clarissa got up and made sure to clean herself off and excused herself as Lars tried the collar on, finding it looked nice on him and posing with it on. She left the study room and smirked a little as she hurried off, &quot;In fact, vengeance is priceless.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lars had utterly no idea what would happen to him over the course of the next month. But for right now, he just wanted to go ahead and find another lover to scratch all his itches. He was Lars Olsen, after all, what could happen to him?</p>
