<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It been 6 months & Paul hasn&#39;t removed his red feral kangaroo costume once. Paul had finally told his parents he wanted to live at the local zoo with other kangaroos. He & his parents talked about it & decided (reluctantly) to let him do it. They called the zoo owner & talked about it with him. They were told that by the zoo owner  his son Rufus would be meeting them & handle Paul becoming their new zoo kangaroo. That sounded ok with the idea. Then set up a time to take Paul to the zoo for this. It was 4 hours before the zoo opened. They met with Rufus at the entrance. He was a man of about 40 with dark brown hair & wearing street clothes. They all headed in & Rufus confirmed they were serious about Paul becoming one of their kangaroos. Paul answered &quot;Yes.&quot; Rufus explained this would be permanent. That Paul would permanently be a red feral kangaroo. Paul explained he already was that. Rufus explained that Paul would be treated just like every other kangaroo at the zoo; no different. Paul informed him that&#39;s what he wanted. Rufus went on to explain that only he & his father would know that Paul was not a natural born red feral kangaroo but an animal costume user. Paul informed him that&#39;s was great. Rufus then said &quot;If you truly want this you must fully commit to this.&quot; Paul asked confused &quot;What you mean?&quot; Rufus explained &quot;That you must disable human speech for kangaroo speech. This means you&#39;ll from that point on only be able to make kangaroo sounds; never again human ones.&quot; Paul asked surprised &quot;I can speak like the kangaroo I am?&quot; &quot;Yes. You can enable animal speech which in turn disables your human speech.&quot; Paul&#39;s parents were surprised. They didn&#39;t know about that function of the costumes. &quot;How I do that?&quot; Paul asked wondering. &quot;This is permanent. It will also permanently lock you in the costume. You from this point on permanently be a red feral kangaroo.&quot; Rufus warned. Getting impatient Paul asked &quot;How you do it?&quot; Rufus explained &quot;Think the phase &#39;I Enable Animal Speech.&#39; and it&#39;ll happen. You will feel something for a few seconds when it does. That&#39;s your speech changing & you locking in the costume permanently.&quot; Paul without hesitation thought &  said boldly &quot;I Enable Animal Speech.&quot; He felt something happen to his body & he tried speaking to discover all he could make was kangaroo sounds now. &quot;Welcome to our zoo. Your new home.&quot; Rufus said to Paul. Paul began hopping another a very happy kangaroo. Soon he stopped & saw his mom sad. He hopped over to her & they hugged. &quot;I&#39;m glad for you Paul.&quot; His dad then said &quot;A parting gift son we taking back your name &#39;Paul&#39;. That&#39;s not a good name for a kangaroo.&quot; The kangaroo formerly known as Paul was pleased by that gift. He was even more a kangaroo now. Rufus told the kangaroo&#39;s parents it&#39;s best they leave so he can settle his new kangaroo in. They said their goodbyes & promised to visit him soon; as zoo customers. Then his parents left. &quot;Come kangaroo. I&#39;m taking you to your new home; the kangaroo enclosure.&quot; Rufus ordered the kangaroo. They then started traveling together; the zoo owner leading. As the 2 travelled across the zoo Rufus was trying to decide what to call the new kangaroo. He had been thinking about &#39;Phoenix&#39; but wasn&#39;t sure about that name. Rufus also had thought about telling this kangaroo which zoo animals were people in Animal Costumes like this roo; but he decided against it. He also thought he maybe should tell this kangaroo about the costume & speech locking permanently. He was one of the few that knew that was a lie (his dad was another). But he looked at the kangaroo & realized this kangaroo was a true animal. Someone who wants to be an animal completely & forever. So he said nothing. Soon they arrived at the kangaroo enclosure & Rufus took the new kangaroo he decided to actually name Phoenix into it through the back area. He gave one final order to the new kangaroo &quot;You are not to try & escape. You are to stay in this enclosure. If we need to move you you will be moved just like any other kangaroo. You are just a kangaroo now no different from the rest.&quot; The kangaroo nodded happy entering the enclosure. He locked the door & left. Rufus then headed to main security office & there was his eastern gray squirrel animal costume waiting there as usual. He checked in the new kangaroo on the computer under the name Phoenix & that he came from another zoo (no one ever checked that). He pulled his cellphone from his pocket & texted what he had done. He also texted he sense going to be his squirrel self for the next 2 monthes. He then turned off his cellphone. He then stripped naked & moved a wall panel & stuffed his clothes, shoes, socks & all his stuff (cellphone too) in the hole. He then put the wall panel back. He put his eastern gray squirrel animal costume on & instantly became a feral eastern gray squirrel. Only Rufus&#39; dad knew about him becoming a squirrel alot. No one else knew this. The squirrel that was Rufus left the main security office. Rufus loves being a squirrel.</p>
