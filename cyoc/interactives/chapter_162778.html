<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You held Aaron in your arms lovingly and you could see the mixed emotions in his eyes, but couldn’t read them for the life of you so you just assumed it was love. That was until you perked up and heard the sounds of multiple heavy boots marching. Immediately territorial instincts kicked in, and you snarled smelling a foreign stench,&quot;No sound like mistress, no smell like mistress!! Bad people here! Aaron bitch hide!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;H-Huh b-but...!&quot; He stammered before you tossed him into the muddy cum filled puddle in the cell,&quot;Aaron safe need now!!&quot;<br />
<br />
You then heard distant voices,&quot;Eugh, smells like a cesspool of imps and goblins down here,&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which just means it’s probably something big, be ready for anything!&quot; <br />
<br />
The moment you saw the first one come down with sword and shield and full metal armor with a strange crest you didn’t care to recognize. You roared at them and tried making yourself look big and intimidating when three others ran down and drew their swords, one armed with a crossbow took aim. Just as you were about to charge Aaron ran out and three himself in front of you and cried,&quot;Wait!! Don’t hurt him!! It’s me!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Your eyes shot wide and you snarled at Aaron,&quot;Aaron me say stay safe!! Me protect you with home for mistress!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I’m saying none of us have to fight damnit!!&quot; Aaron hissed turning around and slapping you across the face.<br />
<br />
You noticed one raising their crossbow at Aaron before another suddenly punched them,&quot;What are you doing you fool?!&quot; The other two looked at the one, who appeared to be their leader, and they were confused, and so were you.<br />
<br />
&quot;C-Captain what’s the meaning of this?!&quot; The knight with a crossbow asked<br />
<br />
&quot;You fool look at the dump of the smaller one!&quot; The captain yelled<br />
<br />
&quot;It has a rather large tailhole, it puckers out even more than a draconic succubi who’s glutton has made her so large she can shit out a castle, what is your point?!&quot; The knight wielding a crossbow replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;At its flank you dimwit!! Shoot him and we’ll all end up executed!!&quot; The captain said and Aaron perked up, and turned his bubbly asscheek towards them, and you noticed a birthmark disfiguring his scales in the shape of a reptilian tail it, you didn’t notice it before and it had been covered in mud and cum before, much like the rest of Aaron’s body currently.<br />
<br />
&quot;My liege is that really you?!&quot; The captain asked and Aaron nodded and replied,&quot;Y-Yes it is! Thank the gods!! Thank you!!!&quot; The captain approached Aaron and immediately you grew uncomfortable so you put and growled, causing all of them to draw their weapons and focus you. <br />
<br />
&quot;Prince! Step away from this beast, now!!!&quot; One yelled and Aaron cried,&quot;D-Don’t hurt him! Don’t hurt my love!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Then suddenly all of them fell silent, some dropping their weapons and shields in disbelief, the captain wasn’t one of them and just stared at you as you held Aaron in your arms and he hugged you. The others began talking amongst each other until the captain cleared his throat,&quot;U-Uh sir, are you telling truth? Y-You realize what you are referring to is.... that... unless it may be a maiden under a curse surely your fa-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don’t care about my father right now!! Stand down damnit!!&quot; Aaron snarled at them and slowly they all sheathed their weapons and shields. When the captain took another step forward you hissed at him and held Aaron tighter until he slapped you again and snarled,&quot;Don’t hurt them either, okay?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Th-They bad though! They intrude!! They almost shoot me!!! They almost shoot Aaron!!!! Mistress said we stay here!!!!&quot; You roared and Aaron roared back,&quot;They won’t hurt me and if you don’t trust me there’ll just be blood!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me is Alpha!!! You is mate!!! Me is big and strong!!! You just breeder!!!&quot; You roared at Aaron and he roared,&quot;And I do not care!!! Lovers trust each other, so you have to trust me!! I know you’re not smart, and I know you probably don’t understand what love even is!!! B-But you showed me passion back there so part of you must have at least some form of understanding!!! If you don’t have a name, I’ll give you one, we can live together, somewhere, I don’t care if it’s even in the wild as this!!! Just don’t die for nothing like this,&quot; Aaron looked up at you crying and just when you were about to retort he kissed you on the lips, and passionately at that. In that moment you felt something happen, some sort of spark.... and you weren’t sure what it was but it was stronger than the obedience lock of a familiar. You couldn’t help but just embrace him and return the kiss with every ounce of passion you had in you, and.... whatever lock you had with the witch suddenly broke. <br />
<br />
Aaron broke the kiss and he was in tears sobbing,&quot;F-Forget about that nasty bitch who kidnapped me, I know you’re her familiar but please.... y-you’re so much more, I-I can see it in your eyes. You want to be more than this, and I want to make that happen, o-okay?&quot; Aaron sniffled and you blushed heavily, looking at the knights briefly who were stunned then back down at Aaron, who was crying into your chest. <br />
<br />
On one hand, you were strong, you were the alpha, you couldn’t show weakness to anyone or anything, and you were a loyal pet who got rewarded for doing good things. On the other, you didn’t want this at all, you drank that potion feeling you had no other choice, you didn’t want to be a slave, and you knew that you were just a tool deep down inside. You were a creature driven by passion, lust, instinct, and devotion, and part of you will always be that way, but you only wanted to be truly, genuinely loved in the first place. Your best chance was right in front of you now, and you felt yourself whimper and start crying alongside Aaron, holding him even closer. <br />
<br />
When the others and Aaron saw the tears and heard you weeping and whining they just watched as you embraced Aaron with everything you had. &quot;M-Me..... M-Me t-trust.... A-Aaron.... follow Aaron.... protect... guard... hug... kiss... mate... and love Aaron.... me just want be with Aaron, and Aaron Safe.....&quot; You whimpered then you’re licked a bit of mud and spunk from Aaron’s cheek and said,&quot;Th-Thank.... you..... m-me come with A-Aaron....&quot;<br />
<br />
You then released Aaron and looked at him and the other knights who were probably questioning a lot at this point. Probably stuff like, why the prince loved a male creature of a different species than he used to be, why he was the same species as you, and why he was covered in mud and semen. The captain of them all while they were talking walked up to you and Aaron and you didn’t react with aggression this time as he drew his sword and stood there before driving the blade into the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;I do not see it necessary to break such a bond, albeit the situation entirely strange, but our only task was to return the prince to his homeland safely. No doubt many will be questioning what happened, but... I will allow you to venture with us and escort the prince to safety without harming any of us. Can I trust you with this task and if so, state your name so we may not offend you by calling you monster or beast?&quot; The captain exclaimed.<br />
<br />
You just stared at him giving him a blank expression before you said,&quot;T-Too many big words.... head hurt....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;S-Sorry he’s a bit... thick skulled.... just... simplify it, okay? He also.... doesn’t have a... name....&quot; Aaron explained nervously.<br />
<br />
The captain paused then took a deep breath and tried again,&quot;Can we trust you to keep all of us safe? If so we will try to keep you safe,&quot;<br />
<br />
You nodded in response,&quot;Me friendly as long as Aaron safe me help.... for Aaron... and eggs....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Someone better explain to him what genders are, preferably a woman so he uh... has an example...&quot; Aaron sighed before you picked him up and put him on your back, letting him piggyback on you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh sir we aren’t actually bringing.... THAT...  back with us.... especially when the prince is... also like that... are we?&quot; One of the knights asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you know magic or a wizard to break the spell? Do you want to risk turning the prince back only for his partner to suddenly get confused and not even recognize him smartass? Just leave them be this way for now and see what the king decides, and what they decide,&quot; The captain replied.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile you were just focused on Aaron, who licked a bit of gunk off from behind your finned ear,&quot;Huh.... n-not too bad.... I think....&quot; He then started to groom you which felt nice so you let him and started towards the door,&quot;W-We need get going before Mistress sees, she bad if she sees,&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mistress?&quot; One knight asked<br />
<br />
&quot;There was evidence of a hag witch in the area, he is probably her familiar. If he’s defying her order now we best follow his lead on that and get moving quickly,&quot; the captain said and the other knights nodded in agreement and it was around this time which you began carrying Aaron out of the cave and up to the surface. Once you were up top Aaron winced a bit as his eyes adjusted to the sunlight and from then on you just started following the rest of the knights, sticking out like a sore thumb since you were much taller, muscular, and had huge testicles. You really didn’t have the knowledge to be in disbelief over breaking the bond with the witch, all you knew is that you were following your love, and he was currently licking bits of mud and cum off of the back of your head and cleaning your scales. So far, it seems like fate had you in her good graces for now.<br />
<br />
Later than night the party decided to make camp, and you had since left the swamp and entered a wooded area. Aaron was uncomfortable about always being nude but he could only wear a loincloth now that his body was too big, much like yours. What’s more you had to show him how to piss on a tree or dig a latrine to take a shit in. He found both actions kind of disgusting, but for you it was sort of amusing watching him struggle with coming to terms with it, and trying to maneuver his twin dicks and streams. You felt empowered to teach him an instinctual survival technique and as the sun fell and everyone gathered around a fire Aaron sat on your lap and let you groom him. <br />
<br />
&quot;So uh... is there any reason you uh let him do this my prince?&quot; One knight who’s name was Alex asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;He uh... this is how he cleans me.... and I do it to him... except not in.... all the nasty places he does it...&quot; Aaron replied as he was upside down and you were licking his feet,&quot;I-I just treat it as a way to stay fairly clean....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;N-No offense but has he cleaned you uh.... areas under your loincloth with that tongue?&quot; A knight named Cain asked<br />
<br />
&quot;N-No!&quot; Aaron replied blushing bright red, and by which means you totally have licked his balls and given him a rim job when you were away teaching him how to take a shit in the woods.<br />
<br />
&quot;Quit asking all these personal nonsense questions to the prince,&quot; the captain who’s name was Elisha, said as he sharpened his blade,&quot;Personally we should concern ourselves with our newest good friend here sitting with him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess, so beast where are you from?&quot; The female knight Kathrine asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Don’t call him that please?&quot; Aaron whimpered,&quot;He’s nice and sweet, we should name him soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right...&quot; Kathrine said,&quot;Still though, where are you from?&quot;<br />
<br />
You paused and spun Aaron around and placed him back on your lap,&quot;Me.... n....no know.... can’t remember....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That’s usually the one thing lizardfolk CAN remember,&quot; Cain said, he was the one who nearly shot you earlier, and immediately he got punched by Alex who replied,&quot;Quit it with that, you’re inadvertently insulting his highness with that racist stereotype bullshit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He’s not wrong though entirely, Lizardfolk do tend to have some of the strongest roots, and in other countries some are even nobles. That’s still strange though... then again he is a familiar, so you know... basically a shapeshifter, unwilling shapeshifter at that,&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That would explain a few things,&quot; Kathrine said<br />
<br />
You then rubbed Aaron’s belly wondering if he was pregnant and said,&quot;When will eggs be in you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dear god not again,&quot; Kathrine sighed<br />
<br />
&quot;I did ask someone to explain to him what gender means..... which could take awhile..... a long while,&quot; Aaron said blushing<br />
<br />
&quot;You know... how did you fall for him prince Aaron?&quot; Cain asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...&quot; Aaron blushed<br />
<br />
&quot;I know!&quot; You announced<br />
<br />
&quot;Please no,&quot; Aaron whimpered<br />
<br />
&quot;Mistress witch bitch,&quot; which was your new nickname for her,&quot;Gave Aaron to me as good gift, me was big horny... and Aaron had cute tight ass tha-&quot; As you were telling the story your cocks unsheathed for the first time in front of them and fully erect between Aaron’s legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;JESUS CHRIST!!!&quot; Alex shouted<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT THE FUCK?!&quot; Cain shouted<br />
<br />
&quot;I uh.... can see where all the smarts went besides brawn now,&quot; Kathrine said<br />
<br />
&quot;No offense, but those would look enormous on a horse,&quot; Elisha said staring in awe like the rest while Aaron just blushed heavily and whimpered.<br />
<br />
&quot;D-Did me do a bad?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;N-No...&quot; Aaron replied<br />
<br />
&quot;W-Why everyone have big face then? It just big juicy dicks,&quot; You asked <br />
<br />
&quot;J-Just..... maybe we should wait until tomorrow,&quot; Aaron exclaimed and the others nodded so you sighed and said,&quot;Okay,&quot;<br />
<br />
Not too long after everyone retired to their tents, you and Aaron got a nice big one that you barely fit in with him, but it was perfect because Aaron loved cuddling and you love being cuddled. As you slept you couldn’t help but notice Aaron was planting his snout in your armpit, and you slept cupping his large ass. The next day....</p>
