<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Hector Ramior was quite aware of what was coming next. There was no attempt to keep it a secret. Hector had already heard plenty about the Passion Spice jawbreaker and how it was used on Heather and Evelyn. Of course, this didn&#39;t scare him. For one thing, he was a male and he could handle be aroused much better than a female. And for once, being a sheep would be advantage since his teeth couldn&#39;t accidentally crush the jawbreaker and he would have the urge to gulp it. He can keep the candy in his mouth for a long time without getting to the aphrodisiac center.<br />
<br />
The night before, Hector had thought the air seemed heavier before he went to bed. But then, he had naturally assumed it was because of the beastly heat that&#39;s been such a problem throughout the summer. All he knew was that he fell asleep much faster than he usually did. And apparently he slept much deeper than usual. As such, he didn&#39;t even notice something was amiss until he started waking. The first thing he noticed was that he was in a sitting position. The second thing he noticed was that he was strapped down, including his arms and legs. The third thing he noticed was that he was naked.<br />
<br />
Hector wasn&#39;t panicked. If anything, he was only annoyed. &quot;So, you&#39;ve finally gotten around to this,&quot; said Hector, &quot;Let&#39;s get this over with.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lucy Greenwall stepped out of the shadows and said, &quot;You do realize why you&#39;re here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, yeah, need to keep my temper, respect other people, blah, blah, blah,&quot; said Hector, &quot;You think this kinky candy really fits in here?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lucy glared and said, &quot;So you know what you&#39;re expecting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You weren&#39;t really hiding it,&quot; said Hector, &quot;I&#39;ve heard about what you did with the other two scaly girls.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I haven&#39;t had the chance to test this on a man before,&quot; said Lucy, &quot;Also, you&#39;re a mammal so that may make you more hotblooded than them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you really want to tease me, then just why don&#39;t you just strip instead of giving me candy?&quot; asked Hector rudely.<br />
<br />
The black cat&#39;s tail swished in irritation. She held out the jawbreaker to Hector with a pair of tongs. &quot;Don&#39;t think you can outlast that,&quot; she said as Hector took the candy in his mouth, &quot;Sheep or not, that jawbreaker will dissolve eventually.&quot; She then stalked out, leaving the ram alone.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
About an hour later, Lucy was walking back to where Hector was left. &quot;Honestly, he seems like a lost cause to me,&quot; she said to Vivian, &quot;He&#39;s showing nothing but surliness and stubbornness.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you suggesting we should have made him a mule instead?&quot; asked Vivian lightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m saying these lessons aren&#39;t really sinking in,&quot; said Lucy, &quot;The only thing keeping him in check is his new instinctive fear of predators. At least Heather and Evelyn were showing remorse before this stage. Hector&#39;s just showing himself to be a stubborn old goat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ram,&quot; corrected Vivian.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever,&quot; said Lucy, &quot;You do realize Animalia&#39;s political enemies are going to pounce on us for this failure if he can&#39;t be rehabilitated.&quot; While Animalia wasn&#39;t constantly under pressure like with the previous president, there were still plenty of his supporters still in power and quite willing to crack down on Animalia for any reason. While it may be unrealistic to have a perfect record for everyone, Animalia was held to a higher standard than most.<br />
<br />
&quot;If he was irredeemable, they wouldn&#39;t have put him in this rehabilitation program to begin with,&quot; said Vivian, &quot;No one said it would be an easy battle, but it&#39;s not unwinnable.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, the next punishment will have to be a tide-changer if we want to show our program works,&quot; said Lucy before she opened the door.<br />
<br />
The two ladies immediately winced at the smell that came out. The musk in that room was much stronger than they thought, as was the smell of semen. Hector was still strapped into his chair and still unable to touch himself. However, judging by the mess on the floor, he seemed to have ejaculated a few times already. And his ram cock was still very hard. Like other male Animalians, Hector was pretty well-endowed. But his cock looked a little more engorged than normal and was twitching with his pulse. Hector gave Lucy a half-crazed look. &quot;Well, hello, kitty,&quot; he said in a manic voice, &quot;Are you here to let me out now? Or you can come in. Yeah, I could really use some pussy right now. Just give me some pussy. You know you want some mutton.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Another miscalculation?&quot; asked Vivian, a hand over her delicate nose.<br />
<br />
&quot;It looks like it,&quot; said Lucy with some chagrin.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Hector was given treatment as soon as possible, though there was one very noticeable side effect. His cock remained erect event after his sperm reserves have been depleted and his arousal has been cooled down. Hector was admitted to Animalia&#39;s hospital for the next few days to treat his priapism.<br />
<br />
There was something good that came out of this. This particular experience did give Hector some well-needed humility. For one thing, it was pretty embarrassing to keep a woolen cap over his crotch to cover his obvious bulge. And a few members of the medical staff did make some jokes about him being a &#39;woody woolly&#39; and a &#39;living sundial&#39;. There was quite a bit of laughter, though the doctors tried to maintain their professionalism by not laughing in Hector&#39;s face...most of the time.<br />
<br />
At least this embarrassment has subdued Hector&#39;s stubbornness and surliness to a noticeable degree. He would hardly be considered rehabilitated, but this was definitely a turning point. And now Hector was starting to dread whatever the fourth punishment will be. The fourth punishment is traditionally tailored to fit the crime and considering what Hector did to get arrested, that was something to worry about.</p>
