<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Taylor Wagner wandered through Magnolia Park, killing time before the pack&#39;s sleepover at Karnstein Manor. She was looking forward to using Morgana&#39;s magic to take her body hair to truly werebeast proportions, but something else weighed heavily on her mind. She was the pack shaman, and she still had no clue how to actually do her job.<br />
<br />
Taylor had always considered herself a very spiritual, mystical person, but being the spiritual leader of a pack of werehyenas was turning out to be much harder than being a member of a Wiccan coven. For one thing, she hadn&#39;t been the high priestess of her coven. That had been Alyssa Bennett, now known as Jinx von Karlstein. The vampires had been the ones lucky enough to get her. For another thing, there were actual books Taylor could read about Wicca to find out what Wiccans believed and how to perform their rituals. Where were all the books about therianthropic shamanism?<br />
<br />
As Taylor milled through the park, she noticed a familiar tall, skinny girl with waist-length brown hair leaning against a tree and taking drags from a bong. She was wearing cargo shorts, a green flannel shirt, sandals, and a beanie with a marijuana leaf embroidered on it. It was Marley Roberts, the resident stoner chick of Taylor&#39;s class. Taylor recalled Selena mentioning wanting to recruit her into the pack.<br />
<br />
Marley waved lazily at Taylor. &quot;Hey there, Taylor. Care for a drag?&quot; She held out the glass water pipe to Taylor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you parents know you do this?&quot; Taylor asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; Marley responded. &quot;They smoke weed, too. Hell, they taught me how when I was, like, fourteen. Weed&#39;s just just part of how my family rolls, y&#39;know? Anyway, want a puff? It&#39;s pretty rad.&quot;<br />
<br />
Taylor winced. &quot;I... I&#39;ve never done anything like this before, Marley.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Trust me,&quot; Marley grinned, &quot;you&#39;ll love it. It smooths you out when you&#39;re stressed, and it shows you new ways of looking at the universe. It sorta... opens your other eyes, I guess? The ones on your brain. Or is it your soul? I dunno.&quot;<br />
<br />
Taylor chuckled to herself. &quot;You are so stoned right now, Marley!&quot;<br />
<br />
Marley laughed hysterically. &quot;I know! But seriously, this shit really does help you connect with your inner wisdom. I&#39;ve had some of my deepest thoughts while stoned out of my mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
Taylor thought about that. As a shaman, she could use some connection to her inner wisdom. Moreover, she&#39;d heard about some cultures&#39; shamans using drugs like peyote in religious rituals. She decided to smoke some pot and see what happened. If nothing else, the weed should at least calm her down a bit.<br />
<br />
Taylor accepted the bong from Marley and inhaled deeply through the mouthpiece. She felt a pleasant, peaceful haze wafting through her brain. She just stood there enjoying it for a moment before she realized something troubling. Shi&#39;d lost control and was in the latter stages of shifting into hir hyena form!<br />
<br />
Marley clapped. &quot;Far out, Taylor! I&#39;m not sure what you just did, but it&#39;s really cool. I really like your tail. Ooh, sweet dick! It&#39;s almost as thick as my arm.&quot;<br />
<br />
Taylor was relieved that all the pot in Marley&#39;s system was keeping her calm. The werehyena glanced around to make sure nobody else was in the park. It was just hir and Marley; good. Taylor considered shifting back, but decided why bother if Marley was hir only witness. Shi crawled out of hir tattered-undersized clothes, enjoying the feel of the breeze on her exposed fur. Her cock and nipples hardened as the cool air hit them.<br />
<br />
Marley slipped her hand inside her cargo shorts and began to masturbate. As the stoner girl stroked herself to the sight of this magnificent beast, she grabbed her bong back with her free hand and took another drag. Nothing made Marley Roberts horny quite like weed.<br />
<br />
As the weed coursed through Taylor&#39;s system, shi felt a change happening around her. All the trees and grass and squirrels felt almost like extensions of the werehyena&#39;s own body. Shi was nature; nature was hir. It was both blissfully transcendent and deeply arousing. Shi also saw things that had not been there before... or had they? Strange, shadowy shapes flitted through the air around hir. Some were shaped almost like humans, some like animals, some in between the two. They felt almost on another plane of reality from Taylor, one that shi was only halfway penetrating. They seemed to be making a sound. It might have been speech, but Taylor was only half-hearing it. Were they trying to talk to hir? Taylor tried to touch one of these creatures, but hir hand went right through it. Were these... the spirits?<br />
<br />
Taylor was jolted from hir fascinated gazing by the sound of Marley&#39;s load moans as she orgasmed. The stoner girl pulled her now-moist fingers out of her shorts. &quot;God, you&#39;re hot like this, Taylor. Pretty sweet trick. You a werewolf or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Werehyena actually,&quot; Taylor said as she picked up the bong and took another drag. &quot;I&#39;m part of a pack led by Selena Lyall. I&#39;m the shaman. I&#39;d honestly be scared to death to tell you all this if we weren&#39;t both high as fuck.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marley ran her hand down Taylor&#39;s huge cock. &quot;That really is a nice dick, you know.&quot; The stoner girl continued to play wit Taylor&#39;s hyena dick, grinning as it grew hard in her grip. From the small moans escaping Taylor&#39;s lips, shi was obviously appreciating the attention Marley was giving hir. &quot;Do all werehyenas have dongs like this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Totally,&quot; Taylor responded. &quot;Selena&#39;s is actually bigger. It&#39;s specifically a wereHYENA thing. Werewolves, werelionesses, werevixens, and the like don&#39;t usually have herm dicks like this. That&#39;s what Selena says, anyway. I&#39;m pretty new to this. So... Oh!&quot; Taylor gasped as Marley wrapped her lips around the tip of hir dick and began enthusiastically licking and sucking on it. The hyena cock shot to full mast and twitched in excitement.<br />
<br />
Marley sucked vigorously on the meaty beast of a log in her mouth. As she slobbered over the dong, she fondled and stroked Taylor&#39;s huge, hairy scrotum and its plump balls with hands. Marley happily listened to Taylor&#39;s lustful moans; she wanted nothing more than to make this glorious beast feel good. Taylor&#39;s pleasure was Marley&#39;s pleasure.<br />
<br />
Taylor&#39;s muscular body shivered and hir tail wagged feverishly as hir orgasm started. She threw back hir head and shrieked as the rapture washed over hir. Hir cock throbbed as cum gushed from it and into Marley&#39;s mouth. Marley gulped the jizz down, somehow never choking. She stood up and adoringly fondled Taylor&#39;s tits as the werehyena savored hir afterglow.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m pretty sure we shouldn&#39;t have done that in a public park,&quot; Taylor smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably not,&quot; Marley laughed, &quot;but I&#39;m glad we did.&quot; Her face suddenly lit up. &quot;Hey, is it sexually transmitted?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is what sexually transmitted?&quot; asked Taylor asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Werehyenahood,&quot; answered Marley. &quot;Is swallowing your spooge gonna make me like you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m afraid not,&quot; Taylor shook hir head. &quot;Alpha Selena has a magic cock ring that turns sex with a werehyena sexually transmitted, but it only works if you&#39;re physically wearing it. It&#39;s probably recharging in Selena&#39;s bedroom right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay then,&quot; said Marley. She held out her arm. &quot;I guess we&#39;re doing this the old fashioned way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Taylor raised a weirded out eyebrow. &quot;Uhhh... what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on,&quot; Marley sighed, &quot;bite me. If that&#39;s the only way to change me, I&#39;m good with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Biting doesn&#39;t do anything,&quot; Taylor said. &quot;The way Selena tells it, you&#39;d just get a nasty scar. The main ways she knows to become a werehyena is to be born as one, to have sex with someone wearing that cock ring I mentioned, or to brush your hair with something called the Werebrush during the full moon.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marley sighed again. &quot;Guess I&#39;ll have to wait for the ring, then.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;d be happy to have you,&quot; smiled Taylor. &quot;Hey, when I puffed on your bong I saw all these phantom creatures in the air. They were sorta half there and half not. You ever seen anything like that while high?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really,&quot; said Marley. &quot;Weed affects everyone differently, y&#39;know. Some people mellow out when they smoke it, but others get paranoid. Most people don&#39;t hallucinate, but a few do. Some people don&#39;t even get high when they smoke it. Wait, didn&#39;t you say you&#39;re your werehyena pack&#39;s shaman?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Taylor answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I bet it&#39;s the pot interacting with your shaman gifts,&quot; Marlet grinned. &quot;It&#39;s like how Native American medicine men use peyote for vision quests.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I still couldn&#39;t see or hear them well enough to really interact with them much,&quot; Taylor shrugged.<br />
<br />
Marley shrugged. &quot;Eh, you&#39;ll get better. Just practice and you&#39;ll get the hang of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish YOU were our pack&#39;s shaman!&quot; Taylor joked. &quot;You&#39;ve had waaaaay more experience with weed than me. Well, I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be seeing you around. Nice to get to know you better. Bye!&quot; Shi shifted back into human for and tried to dress herself in her torn clothes as best she could.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bye!&quot; Marley waved to Taylor as jogged off. &quot;I&#39;ve got plenty of weed to share whenever you want it!&quot;</p>
