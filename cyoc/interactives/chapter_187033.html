<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">	As Janet stared at her son, she felt a strange feeling come over her. It was like a voice was telling her to feed him her cum and turn him into a mutant as well. <br />
<br />
	&quot;You were moments away from dying, and becoming a mutant not only saved your life, but gave you your youth back,&quot; whispered the voice. &quot;You should share your gift with David and see what he becomes.&quot; <br />
<br />
	Janet shook her head to clear her thoughts before pushing David back from her. &quot;I&#39;m going to go to my room, if I stay here I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be able to hold myself back from infecting you.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Okay Mom, I&#39;ll make sure the medics know what happened when they get here. I&#39;ll also let the landlord know about the mutant cum leaking from upstairs, she might want the building evacuated.&quot;<br />
<br />
	Janet quickly skittered into her bedroom while her son sat down on the couch and continued to follow the outbreak on the news as he called the landlord. It was already a relatively big one, with over one hundred confirmed victims so far. Apparently it had started at a local fast food place, so David guessed that one of the people living upstairs must have gotten some take out that was infected. The voice that answered the phone sounded a bit different than what the landlord usually sounded like, but David simply thought it might have been a cold and went on to inform her about the mutant cum he had found in the hallway.<br />
<br />
	From the other end of the line came a muffled reply, &quot;Yeah, I already know.&quot;<br />
<br />
**************************************************<br />
<br />
	Rebecca was the landlord of the apartment complex and had been doing some paperwork when the alert about the outbreak went out, meaning that she had to camp out in her office overnight. Frustrated and tired, she was laying back in the office chair with her eyes closed hoping to be able to fall asleep. Because of this, she didn&#39;t notice the cum that started dripping down from the vent above her head until a big glob had already landed straight into her partially open mouth. The woman shot up in shock, gagging on the salty load that she had reflexively swallowed as a continuous stream of cum began to drip from the vent, draining from Dara&#39;s bathroom.<br />
<br />
	Rebecca jumped away from the dripping vent, but found that her clothes were already soaked. Since she was alone at the moment, she decided to strip off her outerwear before it soaked through. Now clad in just a bra and panties, Rebecca noticed that she was still covered in slime. She stood confused for a moment wondering how so much had gotten on her before she realized that the slime covering her body was different from what was dripping from the ceiling. Panicked, the landlord pulled off her underwear as well and sure enough, her breasts and crotch were still covered in the same slime. After a futile attempt to clean herself off with her discarded shirt, she realized that the slime was coming from her, and only then did she realized the implications of what the liquid dripping from the ceiling were.<br />
<br />
	Now that she realized that she was infected all Rebecca could do was pray that she ends up in a form that&#39;s not to inconvenient. She could deal with having a dick or two and extra limbs could even be useful, but she knew that not everyone got lucky with their form. As she came to terms with her fate, Rebecca found herself losing her balance as her feet fused together. As she fell onto her stomach, her legs were pulled together into one mass, with her pussy moving to the front of her hips. When she landed on the floor, there was an audible “splat” from the mucus covering her body. Rebecca lifted her torso up with her arms and looked over her shoulder as the mass that used to be her legs as it expanded into a bulbous tail. The top half was covered in thick skin that turned a shade of light purple while to bottom half was flat and the same shade as the rest of her skin. Rebecca then felt her spine pop into a new aliment, making it so her back now bent at a ninety degree angle upwards naturally. As the landlord looked over her new lower body she came to the realization that it was now the body of a slug. Rapid for changes the took place on her upper body, a pair of feelers grew out of her forehead, her hair turned a bright neon blue, and four more breast grew on her chest, with both them and her original pair growing to the size of beach balls. Rebecca pulled her new assets apart, noticing that her vagina now sat between her lowest pair of breasts, before her arms were pulled back into her body, leaving nothing but her shoulders.<br />
<br />
	Just as Rebecca&#39;s changes finished her cellphone, which had fallen to the floor a few feet away from her when her transformation started, began to ring. Using the phone call as an excuse to distract her, she began slowly inching her body across the floor, finding moving with her slug tail to be easier than she thought, even if it was very slow. Luckily her nose was enough to push the virtual button on the screen, a blotch of her mucus marking where she touched. When she greeted the caller, who&#39;s voice she recognized as the son of one of her tenants, she felt a strange lump in  the back of her throat. As David explained that his mother had been mutated by a pool of cum flowing down the stairs, the lump pushed upwards until a thick cock came out of her mouth, powerful orgasm overcoming Rebecca instantly as it blasted its load onto the floor before hanging limply from her lips.<br />
<br />
	The only response the mutated landlord could offer was a muffled, “Yeah, I already know.”</p>
