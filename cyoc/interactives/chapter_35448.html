<br />
Epilogue -- Management Mr. M <br />
<br />
Perfect. Like many corporate manipulative schemes that shamelessly exploited human nature, the Management's plot had worked perfectly. Hannah was indeed the perfect stalking doe. It was a long and difficult journey, and it would be a longer and even more difficult journey for those to come, but the point was that it had worked. It was selfish, perhaps it was evil, but the point was that it had worked! <br />
<br />
The athromorphic animals had begun to evolve into their own subculture, while ever so slowly being absorbed into human culture. Of course five years was hardly enough. Realistically, it would take decades if not longer for humans to be considered just another sentient species and of course for the corporately created evolved animals to have their own official names in the scientific community. It had been a unanimous decision that none of the biological forms created by TF Park were to be copyrighted. <br />
<br />
The police, FBI, Homeland Security, and CIA, all agreeing on something for once, had been a united front in not allowing TF Park Tech from becoming public use. <br />
<br />
No genetic bootleggers had sprung up, but then again, since the technology was technically legal, turning it into a contraband business was that much harder. And since it wasn’t forbidden per say it avoided the grab of rebellious teens. <br />
<br />
While these things might have helped spread the trend of having your DNA radically altered, the Management greatly feared their technology becoming a taboo or a forbidden fruit. They wanted their unwitting activists to be shown in as a sympathetic light as possible. Thus the entire need for Hannah, followed by Jenny and Spike to be with. A genetically transgendered male to female, and a mother and her adopted child, provided the perfect emotional strings to pull on. <br />
<br />
With step two of the Plan now in full swing (step one being the park itself), the Management had, as per their pact, begun to draw lots on who would be the first to assume the form their had all  been in pursuit of. <br />
<br />
Naturally, all of them still felt a great deal of resentment and smoldering detest towards Juanita Jaccobs for betraying the pact, but at least she was in Canda and out of their sight. They didn’t particularly care that she had tried to escape the pact by erasing her own memories, or that the person who gained those memories a year later considered herself a totally different from from Madam J and considered her fictional memories to be more real to her. In spite of having avoided righteous punishment for her selfish choice by hiding behind the park's security detail, at least now she was just another husky to be ordered by and controlled by the management. <br />
<br />
Jessica knew if she was still Juanita, she would have been vexed at it being Anthony Martinez who drew first lot at gaining his true form. Actually Mr. M himself was rather nervous about being the first of the Management to go public. He would have greatly preferred to be one of the last, to be 'just another one' of many at that point. <br />
<br />
Drake and his company's 'wolf pack' had originally served as a very enlightening testing group. <br />
<br />
However the Pact was crystal clear that he had little choice in the matter. So after making every delay imaginable, and putting it off as long as he could, the balding short human with a slight belly undressed himself totally and walked into the Transformation Chamber. Two minutes later emerged a minotaur like humanoid bull who look every bit the part of creature of myth. <br />
<br />
The VERY VERY strong urging of Dr. Meghan, the minotaur previous known as Mr. M spent a month in the park getting used to his new form and finding a semblance of balance between his new instincts and human mind inside his very much no longer human evolved bull brain. <br />
<br />
To say Anthony looked and acted like a different person would be an understatement, making people wonder if Gunther had crossed the line and toyed with the TF Chamber once again. However a investigation proved zip. <br />
<br />
The Minotaur was eight feet tall, and built like a tank. His hoofed feet were large enough to provide the balance his massive form needed. Unlike his mythical predecessors, The Minotaur's hands were not human, but had armored fingers much like the other hoofed animals in the park. A good deal of The Minotaur's time was spent learning how to practically use it's new digits. <br />
<br />
The short tail at the back end of the beast had little function other than to aid in sense of balance, while The Minotaur's head was mostly that of a bull's, except for eyes that gazed out and understood, and a throat that was able to make the sounds needed for verbal expression. <br />
<br />
In homage to it's primate origin like all these new species, The Minotaur had only two nipples. <br />
<br />
Unlike Jessica, The Minotaur made no pretenses about not being part of the management, that was part of the pact too. Naturally this brought a good deal of attention both good and bad on the Minotaur from the various guests.  Also as part of the pact, The Minotaur's human template was erased. <br />
<br />
After being certain The Minotaur wouldn't start humping random cows with the giant piece of equipment he now possessed, Dr. Meghan declared The Minotaur (which he accepted as his name and identity after having correct various cubs and young guests as to his name for a million times and finally giving it a rest) fit to be among human beings in his new form. <br />
<br />
Naturally, Mr. M's (the alias which The Minotaur now used to conduct business) stocks dropped at this revelation, as the Management knew might happen. It also had the desired effect of encourage other furries of having their DNA altered thinking it would make them more themselves. After all, if a major business man was willing to come out of the closet, then what did they have to be afraid of? <br />
<br />
As per the laws of the pact, the Management's other members supported The Minotaur's company through the knee-jerk recession from his new form. The fact the Minotaur was seen going about his estate naked and did so likewise in New Eden whenever possible, was a great scoop for the tabloids... who mysterious suffered financial trouble right afterwards. <br />
<br />
Naturally, only the bravest and most determined gold diggers ever dared visit the bovine beast, and only the most resolute risked taking up his requirement those interested in a long term relationship with him become a humanoid cow... even if it was a humanoid cow who had -great- trouble opening bottle caps and could punch through a brick wall to vent frustration. <br />
<br />
Any reporters who made milk farm jokes found themselves having to seek employment in other cities. The wrath of The Minotaur was sublime but terrible.</p>
