<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Leon&#39;s girlfriend was struggling open the door to the boys&#39; dorm, a whole new struggle was occuring behind it. Leon trotted around the place finding a way to hide his big horse ass from Jess. &quot;Oh shit, I&#39;m totally screwed! Can&#39;t you just change her mind somehow?&quot; He addressed his roommate, Jake, while still trying to hide.<br />
<br />
Jake looked for some option that could help Leon out. Jake also didn&#39;t want him to get noticed because it would lead people to the Chronivac and he especially didn&#39;t want that. &quot;It doesn&#39;t work like that, dude. It can change people&#39;s appearance, not their mind.&quot; Leon looked like he gave up trying to hide, and just peaked his head around the corner waiting the door to open. &quot;Then tell me how it made me think your dinosaur tail and mouth was normal?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that&#39;s because it was the change that made people&#39;s minds and perception play into the transformation. I can&#39;t implant an idea into someone&#39;s thoughts, this isn&#39;t Inception. I can however try to change reality to fit yourself in. Also you still have a unicorn horn on your head, she&#39;ll notice that.&quot; He looked at again forgetting all about it. &quot;Damn it!&quot; It didn&#39;t matter though because it seemed time ran out on them as the door swung lightly open revealing Jess. &quot;Dude, you need to make up something. Also don&#39;t mention about this device. Good luck.&quot; Jake says to the unicorn centaur.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks a lot guys, could&#39;ve came and opened the door for me. You must be hiding something if you didn&#39;t want your girlfriend to come in.&quot; Jess sighed in contempt closing the door and looking at the two. It didn&#39;t take long at all for her to stop an stare at Leon&#39;s white horn. &quot;What is that?&quot; She gawked at it coming closer to take a better look. This motion freaked the boys out with Jake ushering Leon to step out an tell her. Reluctantly Leon flipped his new horse hooves forward revealing his full body to Jess who&#39;s jaw dropped open in mostly bewilderment. He spread his wings wide though not enough for the small dorm room. He casted a shadow over her where she didn&#39;t back up but stood stiff still trying to process what was actually in front of her. &quot;You&#39;re a... What are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jess, before you do or say anything else I want to come clean to you.&quot; Leon looked back at Jake who nodded telling him to keep going. &quot;I&#39;m going to tell you the real story, and you&#39;re going to hear me out before you try to interrupt me or try to leave cause I want to share this with you. Okay so here it goes. My name is not Leon, it is instead Leopold, guardian of the sacred prism. As you can see I&#39;m not entirely human like you. I&#39;m from an ancient race called the Olmec, which there are still some accounts of us in museums. My body is a combination of what the creatures you would call a centaur, a pegasus, and a unicorn which all come from us. Me and my people lay invisible as masters of the sky leaving you the masters of the land. My race doesn&#39;t really show ourselves to humans because most of us, which are typically the more intelligent, don&#39;t want anything to do with you and even look down on you. There are some of us, like me, who don&#39;t agree with them. The only time we really come down is some magical threat is causing you harm. Just a few months ago I posed as a human college student, while I looked at why there was some strange electric failure causing unwarranted blackouts to happen in your city. While researching this phenomena, I met you. I was indifferent about you humans, even doing jobs before this, I never really felt I belonged or had an affection towards your people. You seemed to show me the way of your people, I was a little awkward at first, but I soon got the hang of it. We were still dating when I eventually caught the thunderbird, a harmless bird of myth, that was taking power to help get itself back home to the heavens. After my mission was complete, I told them I wanted to stay longer and to keep dating you. They weren&#39;t aggressive towards this option, and it&#39;s even happened before, but they told me that it almost never works between our kind and yours. They said your people don&#39;t accept us, and they are then left heartbroken. They told me that I would need to tell you who and what I was by a human month went by or they&#39;d force me back. I pushed back in telling you for a while now not wanting to get my heart broken like the others, but now I feel I&#39;m ready to present myself to you because I want to keep seeing you more often. I love you Jess, and I wish for you to accept who I really am. I feel like you should know the truth if I do have to leave you.&quot; Leon finally completed his fake story to Jess and ending it with him holding out for a hug? Both Jess and Jake looked at Leon wide-eyed and open mouths, mostly for Jake since he had just began to believe his story.<br />
<br />
Jess seemed to be taking it more, and seemed to even tear up a little looking at what a sight her boy friend was. He looked like he was from some fantasy movie, and even his story sounded a lot like a bunch of kids shows. She couldn&#39;t shake that this was real and she felt everything that was laid out for her, most importantly his sentiments towards her made feel even more convinced. &quot;Oh, I don&#39;t know what to say.&quot; Jess looked up to Leon. Leon snorted which sound more equine than human. &quot;No I believe you, it&#39;s just hard to take it in.&quot; She paused, but eventually gave into his hug and wrapped her arms around his midsection where human and horse met. Leon squeezed her tight as her head pressed into his white furry front.<br />
<br />
She let go after a few affectionate squeezes and said, &quot;let me get a look at you.&quot; Her hand reached up trying to touch his horn leading him to bow down and let her feel it. Her hands and touch were surprisingly warm making which was a good thing for Leon if she was going to explore his body. Her hand made it&#39;s way to his mane that ran down his human back and into his horse back, feeling her gentle touch all the way down. She walked to his left side looking at his large wing where she rubbed her fingers through the rows of overlapped feathers. She then took her hand and rubbed it a long to his rump where he slowly felt himself to become a little stiff. She saw his tail swish every few moments. She then stood right in front of his bare rump, then looked up to see Leon looking back a little flustered seeing his girlfriend looking at his vulnerable bits. His black horse pucker was big and tempted Jess to stick her hand in which she didn&#39;t know how he&#39;s react. Didn&#39;t want to upset someone like him, what if he kicked her with his hooves just by reflex. She lightly patted his cheeks which were very doughy. Finally she knelt down and began to inspect his underside looking at his horse testicles that were as big as tennis balls, an his long penis rod that was slowly popping out of his sheath. She laid down between his him legs looking up at the pink marbled flesh that looked too good for her to be a part of her boy friend. She got up and stood in front of Leon again looking more sad than he had expected.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong? Don&#39;t you like my body?&quot; He asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No it&#39;s not that, it&#39;s just that I don&#39;t deserve this. You&#39;re a terrifically wonderful person, or Olmec if I recall correctly, and I don&#39;t deserve to have you literally fall for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, it&#39;s not permanent. I&#39;m not excluded from my kind if I choose to stay with you, that is not held against you. Though if you don&#39;t feel like you want me to fall in love with you, I understand. That of which I hope you find someone that actually makes you happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I am happy with you. It&#39;s hard, I love your real body, even more than your human one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right?&quot; Leon exclaimed. Noticing she was still wanting to continue he backed off. &quot;Sorry. Continue.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, well then I don&#39;t really know why I&#39;m conflicted, Leopold. Your race still accepts you, Jake accepts you, I accept you, but I feel...&quot; She was caught off when Leon leaned down and kissed Jess and held her in his arms as she submitted herself. He was practically cradling her with her body hung from his arms. She took her hands again and rubbed his mane in a circular fashion. This kiss lasted until they both let go, but his arms still carrying her. He then whispered. &quot;Jake&#39;s a mythical creature as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, really? How come he looks normal to me? Unless that&#39;s not how true form.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually his true form is a large t-rex, that&#39;s why his mouth and tail looks like they come from one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah, I though that was just some deformity. He&#39;ll have to show me sometime.&quot; She looked over at Jake.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, perhaps someday.&quot; He said. Now that he was satisfied with this engagement he accidentally hit enter with his elbow. &quot;Oops.&quot; He whispered. He totally forgot what configuration he had before the button was pressed. He looked over what had been changed.</p>
