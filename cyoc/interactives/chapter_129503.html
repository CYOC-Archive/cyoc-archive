<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Two months of learning to eat from a bowel.  Drink from a bowel. Shit in a yard.  Pee like a bitch.  And all the while watching her belly grow until there were kicks.  If it wasn&#39;t Matt that did the trick one of the other seven studs that had there way with Tom in those first days at the farm certainly did.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll treat you like the rest,&quot; Uncle Frank had told her when he affixed the &#39;Tommi&#39; tag on Tom&#39;s collar after shots and being chipped.  &quot;So if this is some sort of fantasy to you, live it out.  I ain&#39;t helping you any except about your friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t until the day after, sixty days exactly, when seven puppies were what Tom produced, to Uncle Frank&#39;s clear satisfaction.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll be a real popular one for us if you keep producing like that,&quot; he said, watching as Tom had the look in her pale blue eyes that she had some regrets as the puppies suckled away at her teats. &quot;Once you&#39;re ready to go away, you&#39;ll be glad to hear your parents, well, Ralph&#39;s owner&#39;s, decided to lend him out for stud.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom&#39;s heart skipped a beat and she felt dizzy even his body.  He put her head down and tried not to think about her old dog...<br />
<br />
&quot;Seems they really do need the money and with what I offered them, they were really interested in the whole business.  As a matter of fact, they&#39;ll be observing the coupling of you two.  Ain&#39;t that a trip?&quot;  He croaked with laughter, Tom&#39;s dizzy head spinning a bit more to even try and think of it.  &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I won&#39;t say anything.  Not that they would believe me.  You can come to terms with that over the next couple of months.  That spell puts you in heat fast so it won&#39;t be long, girl,&quot; he added with a laugh before leaving Tom for the night with the hungry pups.<br />
<br />
Tom hardly had the presence of mind to remember being a mother as the depth and trapped feeling of her position sunk in with every passing day which stretched into weeks.<br />
<br />
When the puppies were removed, it seemed like a relief that she could finally be free of them but when she found herself being checked daily by the farmer, who only would laugh at her predicament each time, would tease of her pending fate.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve been trading pictures,&quot; he said one day, lifting up Tom&#39;s backside, &quot;and that Ralph is one big boy.  No one you developed your inferiority complex,&quot; he chuckled while Tom ashamedly shut his eyes, images of him and Ralph playing coming back to taunt him.  &quot;And your parents just love you.  Even said they basically treat Ralph like their son so this is the closest they&#39;ll get to grand kids.  Can you imagine my face when they said that?&quot; Uncle Frank laughed and set Tom down and cleaned off his hands.  &quot;Well, guess I&#39;ll be calling them tonight.  You&#39;re good to go for Ralph tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom couldn&#39;t sleep all night and morning brought noises and footsteps.<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s so cute!&quot; she heard her mom say just after the light flipped on.  <br />
<br />
Tom could feel the bark catch in her throat when she saw her once parents looking down, his dad holding a tight leash, and seeing only a bitch in heat.  <br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s really, woah!  Calm down there, Ralph.  He seems to really like her already too!&quot; Tom&#39;s dad said as bark&#39;s she knew well rang out.<br />
<br />
&#39;This... can&#39;t be happening right now...&#39; Tom&#39;s mind thought cleared, the world feeling like it was slowing.  <br />
<br />
Uncle Frank was already going to the gate while Ralph&#39;s anxious taps on the floor signaled his infatuation with the scent.<br />
<br />
Then, the gate to the pen open, a face Tom knew well was looking right at her and there was, she felt, some connection.  Some recognition.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Just let him go?&quot; Tom&#39;s dad asked.<br />
<br />
Uncle Frank was already at the collar detaching the lead.<br />
<br />
&quot;They clearly like each other,&quot; Uncle Frank chuckled as Ralph was untethered.<br />
<br />
Tom was standing but frozen as the massive male bounded over.  It was familiar but so different and their noses met.  If there was any doubt in Tom&#39;s mind that Ralph knew who she, the former he, was.  Ralph licked him and then down his neck and body and to Tom&#39;s rear.  Tom lifted his tail and spread his legs, surprised how willingly he gave in.  Sniffing his way back to Tom&#39;s snout, Ralph nuzzled Tom&#39;s head up so they were eye to eye.<br />
<br />
Tom had forgotten the mismatched blue and brown of Ralph as they stared.  With just a flair of nostrils and low growl, Ralph nudged Tom hard and her new brain translated it quickly enough.<br />
<br />
&#39;I&#39;m master now,&#39; Ralph indicated, Tom&#39;s heart sinking wit his head, though he remained in position like a good bitch.  <br />
<br />
Tom knew only one response and he licked at Ralph and whimper, submissively saying, &#39;I&#39;m yours, master,&#39; in a way that he had thought before.<br />
<br />
Ralph&#39;s demeanor seemed to change then, moving to nip at Tom&#39;s neck before moving forward and lifting his leg, showing the engorged cock which had grown out of sight.<br />
<br />
Tom let instincict slip in and he was now licking at the cock from tip to sheath, noticing the flash of a camera.<br />
<br />
&quot;And why do they do that?&quot; Tom heard his mom say in disgust at the sight.  Making matters worse, Ralph moved on to lick Tom&#39;s sex, giving Tom a view of his stunned- and photogenic- parents.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s just a way of showing submission to the stronger male, so to say,&quot; Uncle Frank answered.<br />
<br />
Tom was watching his dad take another picture when the weight, almost twice what Matt or the other dogs were, lurched on his back.  The poking tip at his backside was causing him to shake.<br />
<br />
&#39;This is it.  Those dreams... Ralph on top... oh God... I&#39;m so sorry mom... dad... I want... I want this so bad...&quot; and on cue, Ralph trust into his once master, causing the bitch to orgasm right away.  Tom&#39;s tongue lapped out and Ralph started to pound away.<br />
<br />
Her mind was racing and twisting around in every direction but straight.  A growing desire to let go and give in to the moment took over and the mental start of Tom deteriorated to the point where when Ralph&#39;s knot finally sealed them together, Tom was gone.<br />
<br />
Parents paid and Ralph headed back home, Uncle Frank recognized the last change in Tom and knew that was that.  <br />
<br />
With a second litter of 10, Tom was well employed for years to come.</p>
