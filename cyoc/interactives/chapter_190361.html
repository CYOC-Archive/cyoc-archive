<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
Joey was next led to another room; this one had a standard doctor’s examining table. Waiting inside was a twentysomething young man who was clearly a doctor.<br />
He shook Joey’s hand. “Hello Joey, I’m Dr. Selim Fareed. I’m here for your medical evaluation.”<br />
As Instructed, Joey took off his shirt, overall, and shoes and sat on the exam table in only his tee-shirt and underwear. Dr. Fareed listened to Joey’s heartbeat, took his temperature, examined his ears, eyes, and propped the nostrils of his big red nose-a standard enough medical exam. Then, like the doctor at the hospital, Dr. Fareed examined Joey’s bald head and remaining hair with a magnifying glass, probed Joey’s oversized feet, and finally squeezed his nose. HONK!<br />
Nodding, the doctor instructed Joey to stand up and drop his underwear. Feeling his cheeks grow hot, Joey did as asked.<br />
Dr. Fareed examined Joey’s privates closely-with the serious part pf Joey’s mind noted, with the dispassionate expression doctors used when making examinations, not that of a pervert indulging in a fetish. <br />
Finally he nodded. “I’ll be leaving the room, Joey, “he said. “For this part, our residents our usually more comfortable if they are alone in the room.<br />
After he left, a voice spoke over the intercom. “Ve are observing you through the two-way mirror,” a German accented voice spoke over the building intercom. “Ztand in front, please.” Still feeling somewhat embarrassed but less because no one was in the room, Joey did so.<br />
“Now,” the German voice said, “ve vill zee you react to zertain ztimiuai.”<br />
Circus calliope music began playing over the intercom. Joey felt an odd wave of pleasure course throughout his body, especially in his crotch. As the music played, he could hear soft laughter under the music. <br />
Soon the laughter got louder and the pleasurable feeling intensified and Joey felt himself giggling along. <br />
Then something truly weird happened-as if turning into a real-life clown with a honking nose and enormous feet wasn’t weird enough.<br />
Joey’s tiny red button of a cock began to grow into a long red tube. Although he was dazed with the pleasurable feeling, a detached part of Joey’s brain noted how it looked more like a long balloon than those pictures he’d seen in sex ed textbooks. And it grew longer and thicker than he’d thought possible, until it was nearly as long as his forearm. The music stopped playing and-.<br />
Suddenly a loud ‘POP!’ filled Joey’s ears; a long stream of what looked like purple-pink silly string shot out from his penis onto the wall opposite him.<br />
Joey looked at his crotch and sighed with relief. He feared his penis had burst; instead it had merely shrunk back into the tiny red cap above his testicles. <br />
Joey glanced at the wall and the load he’d shot onto it. Was that his cum? His big red nose twitched; among other things Joey’s sense of smell had greatly enhanced over the past year. Whatever he’d shot out it smelled like bubblegum.<br />
“Very gut, Joey,” the voice from the intercom said. “Now put your clothes back on.”<br />
Joey did so. He’d just gotten his shoes back on when the door opened; Dr Fareed and the Asian woman who’d first accompanied Joey to his psychiatric appointment entered.<br />
“Hello Joey,” she said warmly. “I’m afraid I didn’t introduce myself properly at the beginning. I’m Dr. Suzanne Yakhamito; like my colleague Dr. Fareed I came to specialize in observing our residents and their medical needs.” She gave a brief smile. “My son is a resident here; you’ll meet him shortly. <br />
“Anyway, we are here to discuss the results of both examinations. Your condition physically at least has reached its full progression. You may grow taller, or heavier, but there should be no more changes to your body.”<br />
“What happened, he he ya ha, when they played that music, he he ya ha?” Joey asked and honked his nosed. “Why did my-.” He stopped feeling his cheeks grow red. Joey’s parents weren’t exactly prudes but they were still uncomfortable when discussing matters like that with their son. Honk! Honk!<br />
“That’s what happens when those with ‘clown syndrome’ hear laughter,” replied Dr. Fareed. “At least with boys. Girls-it’s a little different. You do know about a woman’s ‘time of the month?’” Joey nodded, honking his nose again. “With girls, the first time they get their period, if they have your ‘condition,’ the menstrual fluid smells sweet and fruity instead of the usual unpleasant odor-in fact, we recognize it as the first sign of ‘clown syndrome,’ at least for a girl. When she hears laughter, she get’s feelings similar to what you had. Her-clitoritis-and the nipples of her breast swell into round red balls that, like your nose, honk when squeezed.” Joey’s cheeks felt even hotter.<br />
“I see this is uncomfortable for you,” Dr. Yakhamito said. “Trust me, we are merely saying this to inform you of what to expect in regard to your body. And, as strange as it may seem, there are actually benefits to your condition.”  <br />
“Benefits?” Joey managed to force his face into a comical look of consternation. “What benefits are there to looking like this, he he ya ha?” He honked his nose loudly as if to emphasize his point. “Or being chubby with big feet? Or going bald at 13?” Honk! Honk!<br />
“I know this has been stressful to you,” Dr Fareed said. “But I assure you, we have the best interests for you and the other residents at this facility at heart. You surely must realize there is no chance for you or anyone else with ‘Clown Syndrome’ to have a normal life.” Reluctantly Joey nodded.<br />
“Getting back to what I said earlier,” said Dr. Yakhamito, “none of our residents here has ever been sick. Not even having so much as a cold. And in rare instances they’ve been injured, they recover extremely fast. Cuts and scrapes heal in only a matter of seconds without leaving so much as a scar. One resident even broke a leg in one of our residentual races; the next day her leg had completely healed and she could walk or run as if nothing had happened. And they seemingly have boundless energy. Have you ever felt tired even once, this past year, at least when you weren’t sleepy?” Joey shook his head. “It seems Joey, that those with Clown Syndrome enjoy unexpectantly good health and vitality.”<br />
“But, he he ya ha,” Joey said, “we look like clowns. And we act like clowns, he he ya ha, even when we try to be serious.” Honk! Honk!<br />
Dr. Yakhamito simply nodded. “It’s fortunate that so far, you are few in numbers, and that our patrons have the resources to keep your existence and that of this facility a tightly guarded secret. We are not inhumane; we do our best to make sure you and the others will have a comfortable and decent life here. But realistically, we won’t be able to Clown Syndrome a secret forever.”<br />
“We are already discussing plans for when that happens,” added Dr. Fareed. “As you Americans say, we will cross that bridge when we get there.”</p>
