<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chris got back to his room after getting back from his dead-end job.  It sucked, but it paid enough for internet and his share of the rent.  His current game was some MMO he&#39;d played nearly a decade ago, but he was still looking for something that captured his fancy.  He was practically on auto-pilot.  Kicked off his shoes, swapped his work uniform for casual clothes, turned on the PC, and sat down.  As he began to think about what he was doing again, he realized something was different.<br />
<br />
A strange-looking totem sat directly in front of his monitor.  It was about 9 inches tall, and around as thick as a soda can, carved in a way that reminded Chris of Hawaiian tikis, though he was no expert and they could&#39;ve looked nothing alike.  The simple features appeared to be some sort of beast, but it was hard to tell what kind it was due to it being curled onto its haunches.  It looked a little like a fat imp, or a horned dog?  It was carved a deep green stone, which he assumed was jade since he didn&#39;t know of any other dark green rocks.  It looked expensive, if a bit gaudy.<br />
<br />
Upon picking up the object, Chris felt a slight shock.  It felt like nothing more than static discharge, but he was confused at how that was possible.  It even felt like polished stone, and he was sure such an object should never give or receive static electricity.  He felt more acutely aware of the idol&#39;s presence, and he immediately realized what beast it was now.  It wasn&#39;t some large-gutted dog, it was a cow!  He&#39;d confused the four holes on its lower body as some sort of marking, but that were supposed to represent the udder&#39;s teats.  Also, the tail that coiled around the idol&#39;s hooves and rear definitely belonged to a bovine.<br />
<br />
He set the idol back down, now out of the way of his monitor, and started up his game.  However, he just couldn&#39;t stop thinking about it.  Thinking it was because it was still in his line of sight, he picked it up once more, then moved it to under his bedsheets.  He moved back to his computer, but he could still feel his attention being dragged toward the idol.  He could practically feel it under those sheets.  Worse yet, it felt like the room was getting hotter and more stuffy.<br />
<br />
He closed the game down, then brought the idol back to his desk.  He tried doing a reverse image search, but he got nothing from that.  Instead, he started searching for anything that might be tied to it.  Totems, idols, jade statues, all of them turned up very little substance.  The heat just kept increasing, and his clothes kept feeling tighter.  Worse yet, he was starting to mess up his typing, putting letters in the wrong order or hitting keys next to the ones he really wanted.<br />
<br />
Frustrated, Chris picked up the idol and focused on it, trying to see something, anything that could explain what this thing was.  For a split second, he could&#39;ve sworn the eyes of the idol glowed for a split second.  He didn&#39;t have much time to think about it, as he suddenly felt a wave of nausea that caused him to drop the idol to his desk.<br />
<br />
Chris grabbed his head, trying to stop the throbbing pain in his skull and to steady his head.  It felt like his body was growing in all directions.  His jeans quickly began to make his legs feel like sausages, and his shirt had already begun to tear.  As the button popped and his jeans also began to rip, he frantically tried to strip down.  As he did so, he realized hair was growing all about his body, far thicker than would be reasonable for any human being.  <br />
<br />
He tried to step further backwards, but toppled to the floor.  The meat of his heels was gone, and his foot felt far too long.  He lifted a leg to see what was wrong, and realized he now had hooves for feet.  Worse yet, he felt a pinching pain in his backside where he landed.  Fumbling to grab whatever was hurting, he pulled out a long, rope-thick tail from beneath him.  He strained to get back up, but his destroyed pants still constrained him.  He thrashed about on the floor, causing more rips to form until he was free of his pants, which unfortunately also left him entirely nude.<br />
<br />
He heaved himself onto his new hooves, but his body signaled it was nowhere near over.  Chris took deep breaths, but realized his chest wasn&#39;t dropping with each inhalation.  He tried to press the air back out of him, but he instead pressed into soft flesh instead.  He was apparently the proud new owner of quite a large rack.  Upon this realization, he reached for his junk, only to realize they were already gone!  He felt around, craning his neck around his bountiful assets to figure out what was happening.  Instead of his expected dick and balls, he instead found a very recognizable slit slightly further down.  He was now a female?  Technically, but he had more important things at the moment.<br />
<br />
Fur continued to spread over his body, lengthening and thickening until a noticeable pattern of black and white showed through.  It spread down his arms, and his fingers began to contort into black, hoof-like digits.  It pulsed over his breasts, crawling up his neck and issuing further modifications.  He could feel his mouth pull into a snout, his hair natural head of hair wither away, and his ears shift and lengthen.  The worst of it was the pressure he felt in his bones as they crunched inward and outward, obeying an unknown force that sought to turn him into a cow.  He could even feel his skull press horns through the skin on either side of his head.<br />
<br />
As the pressure moved out of his face, Chris had but a moment to believe that it was over.  That moment ended when he clutched his gut as a new kind of pressure began to form.  His gut grew distended, pressing his arms out of the way and thinning the fur that had grown there until a lightly-furred pink mass hung from his stomach, jutting outward about as far as his breasts.  However, the pressure just kept mounting, inflating the mass further beyond reasonable levels.  It pressed downward, demanding space between his legs.  It pressed outward until Chris could even see it without needing to look around his breasts.  As a cherry on top, he was treated to see two large teats grow from it, and he could feel the same occur on its underside.  Chris was now the proud, unwilling owner of an udder.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, the changes seemed to stop, though Chris didn&#39;t move for fear of making more happen.  After a few minutes of petrified terror, Chris realized another change: he&#39;d grown to be well over 8&#39; tall.  The ceiling of his room now hung precariously close to his head.  As he waddle-walked to the doorway, it looked like he wouldn&#39;t be able to fit through even if he didn&#39;t have the udder.  Maybe, with a lot of squeezing?  <br />
<br />
Moving back to his desk, which now seemed like something fit for a child compared to his current size, he realized there was absolutely no way he&#39;d be using his keyboard with these fingers.  He couldn&#39;t avoid hitting at least 4 keys every time he tried to click one.  Instead, he took the now-small idol and took a closer look at it.  Where had it come from?  Why did it turn him into a cow-person, of all things?  Could he make it change him back?  This udder was giving him some confusing signals, and he&#39;d prefer if it disappeared before he needed to answer them.<br />
<br />
Looking over his predicament, Chris began to realize what this reminded him of.  That not-a-game he&#39;d tried to play a couple days back!  Moonlight Rhapsody!  He was a duplicate of what he&#39;d put into the character creator.  Was that even possible?  He looked down at himself, and considered that enough of an answer.  He couldn&#39;t remember some of the specifics of his created character, but he at least now knew what to search and who to blame.</p>
