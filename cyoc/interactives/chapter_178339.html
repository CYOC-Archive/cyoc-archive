<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;So, let me get this straight.&quot; Jake said. &quot;You&#39;re some fifty something business guy who tried out an experimental treatment and now you&#39;re..&quot; He waved at Brandon&#39;s body.<br />
<br />
&quot;That about sums it up.&quot; He responded. He had left out a few things, like the fact he was a complete asshole. He actually stated to feel ashamed of the way he had acted his whole life. He wondered if that was a personality change, or just a change of perspective.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it doesn&#39;t seem too bad. Jake answered. A new lease on life, health, and you look fucking sexy.&quot; Jake shifted in his seat again as if trying o hide what was becoming a more and more obvious bulge in his sweats. Brandon even noticed a bit of a wet spot forming on the fabric.<br />
<br />
&quot;I also became gay. Well.. I&#39;m not really sure it is gay anymore. I&#39;m attracted to men, but..&quot; Brandon scrunched his brows. He wasn&#39;t really a guy was he. Or was he because he wanted to be. He had never paid attention to all that gender nonsense before but now, it seemed an important question.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Jake asked, seeming genuinely curious.<br />
<br />
&quot;Promise not to laugh.&quot; Brandon wanted to show someone, share it, stop being ashamed of it. When Jake nodded he  lowered his shorts. His nub of a.. whatever it was was obviously hard, and his pussy was more than a little damp from the closeness of Jake and his persistent horniness, some juices leaking into the fabric of the couch. &quot;See?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god, that&#39;s fucking hot.&quot; Jake said, staring between Brandon&#39;s legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; That was not what he had been expecting, nor when Jake reached out to brush his fingers against Brandon&#39;s oversized clit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, you&#39;re like some sort of wet dream. The body of a sexy guy with the easy access of a pussy?  Fuck me. I&#39;d be all over that.&quot; Jake seemed to want to right now. Brandon wasn&#39;t backing off from the fingers touching him, then he gasped as he felt a couple of Jake&#39;s digits slip inside him.<br />
<br />
&quot;We shouldn&#39;t.&quot; Brandon gasped. &quot;Doc said no sex.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fooling around a little isn&#39;t sex.&quot; Jake said as he leaned in to kiss Brandon, his finger still working inside his pussy. Brandon quivered under the touch, his hand going to the back of Jake&#39;s head. He wanted this, it felt so good, so right.  His other hand, wandered down and slipped under Jake&#39;s waistband, his hand finding his cock and his eyes went wide.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell?&quot; It felt huge in his grip. He pulled it free from Jakes sweats and the other young man looked down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Its bigger.&quot; He said, shocked. Bigger was an understatement. This thing belonged in a porno. It must have been eleven inches rock hard, and his balls drooped low and heavy, looking like a pair of furry lemons. It drooled pre in a small rivulet. God, Brandon wanted that thing inside of him.<br />
<br />
Brandon quickly retreated from Jake, pulling his shorts back up. &quot;We can&#39;t I don&#39;t want to change further. You might restart my changes and you..&quot; Brandon blinked as he looked over Jake. &quot;Are still changing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake seemed to have noticed too. His muscles had plumped up a bit more, his pecs almost cartoonishly round. His stomach was so packed with muscle it stuck out like a gut, but rock hard with the imprint of his abdominals. Veins popped out on his arms and thighs when he flexed. He was like some sort of bodybuilder, even if he had lost another inch or so in height. The fur on his chest now covered his pecs, as well as his stomach. &quot;God, I&#39;m like some sort of fucking gorilla.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A sexy gorilla.&quot; Brandon tried to offer helpfully.<br />
<br />
Jake sighed and leaned back, closing his eyes. Now that worry had taken over again, his horniness seemed to ebb. But even soft his cock lay halfway down his thigh. &quot;I can&#39;t go home like this! No one is going to recognize me, or even believe its me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s just see what the doc says.&quot; Brandon sighed, trying to calm Jake down. Almost as if summoned there was a knock on the door. &quot;I bet that&#39;s him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake stood and pulled up his pants as Brandon opened the door to admit a tall, lean man in his fifties. His eyes went right to Jake.<br />
<br />
&quot;You must be Jake. I&#39;m Dr. Walter Jannes.&quot; The doc strode into the house and over to the living room, giving Brandon something of a withering look on the way. The doctor plopped himself down on the couch before Brandon could warn him it might be a bit damp, but the doc didn&#39;t seem to notice.<br />
<br />
He took Jake in. &quot;Muscular hypertrophy, now is that natural or myostatin induced..&quot; He set his bag down and motioned for Jake to take a seat nearby. &quot;Have you eaten today, I&#39;m going to want to do some blood work. See how the serum is affecting you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake seemed to trust the doctor, taking a seat and holding out his arm. &quot;Not just the muscles, but the hair, the cock.. And I&#39;m shorter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You looked about five six or five seven if I&#39;m guessing right. How tall were you?&quot; Jannes started taking his blood samples without even a flinch from Jake. &quot;Do you have a picture of how you looked, preferably as nude as possible.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Six one.&quot; Jake said sullenly. He grabbed his phone and one-handed flipped through a few pictures until he held it out for Jannes to see. Brandon angled himself to get a look Jake had a nude of himself laying on a bed. &quot;Do you need to see...?&quot; He motioned at his lap.<br />
<br />
Jannes nodded as he pulled out the needle, bandaging the spot he drew blood from. &quot;Please.&quot; Jake stood and dropped his sweat pants. Even Jannes seemed shocked.  The thing really did flop more than halfway down Jake&#39;s thigh, and those swinging balls were enormous. &quot;Hyper masculinity, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if all your hormone levels were elevated.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How come he didn&#39;t get younger, isn&#39;t that the main effect of the serum?&quot; Brandon suddenly asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, so you do pay some attention.&quot; Jannes sighed. &quot;It does cause aging to reverse. But it won&#39;t reverse puberty. The farthest back it can go is to the end of adolescence, so in men, early twenties. I&#39;ve never had someone so young exposed to it before. So, the increased sex characteristics might be some sort of... side effect of the deaging process not being able to operate. Or it could just be the normal random effects of the serum.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you reverse it?&quot; Jake sounded painfully hopeful, pleading.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve never tried. And second applications of the serum to try to induce different changes have simply not worked. It&#39;s like.. once you get a disease you can&#39;t get it again.&quot; He rubbed the bridge of his nose. &quot;That I&#39;ve tested enough to be certain of. Once you&#39;ve been altered, that&#39;s it.&quot; He started packing up his bag. &quot;I&#39;ll get this blood work done and be in touch. If you need me to talk to your family..&quot; He held out a business card to Jake. In return he entered Jake&#39;s number into his own phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;And no sex for at least a week. Except with each other.&quot; Jannes admonished. The two blinked in surprise. &quot;Please, I can practically smell it in the air. And I know the serum causes increased libido for a few days. But since you&#39;ve both been altered, you should be able to go ahead with no further issues, though Jake may still experience a few more alterations before his new appearance is set, I wouldn&#39;t expect anything drastic. Likely more muscle and hair growth.&quot; The doctor stood and headed towards the door. &quot;I&#39;ll rush this, too. But I&#39;m pretty sure you have your answers already. I&#39;m sorry this happened.&quot; That was directed only to Jake, and then he left.<br />
<br />
Jake looked at Brandon, he expected to get yelled at, or punched for what he did. Instead Jake sighed heavily. &quot;Well, I guess a few inches in height is a small price to pay for being the king of the gym.&quot; Jake&#39;s features had become a bit heavier and more masculine, but he was still obviously him. And Brandon felt a little jealous of that. His entire identity hadn&#39;t been taken away. He felt two strong arms wrapping around him, was he crying again? The part of his brain that was the old him was disgusted. The new him just wanted to melt into this rock of a man holding him. Luckily, with his own lesser reduction in height the difference between them wasn&#39;t too awkward. Their lips met again, in a long, slow kiss.<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s a hot tub on the back deck.&quot; Brandon said softly once the kiss broke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds good to me.&quot; Jake said, already leading him by hand to the back door.</p>
