<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chaz awoke sometime around 6am again and once more Mara was already out of bed. She usually sleeps in since she works from home as a graphic design artist so she tends to be on her own schedule but this was the second day in a row that she was up so early. He could hear the shower going off in the bathroom so he decided to pay her a visit there. Upon entering the bathroom door he was astonished by Mara&#39;s new silhouette. She hardly had any fat on her stomach now, just a soft slight ponch but barely much of one. Her thighs were still thick but smoother and better proportioned. As she swayed in the shower singing to herself, he could see her hips were most definitely wider than before and her overall shape was less round and more hourglass. Her arms were thinner as well and he could tell that her breasts had gone up at least a cup size or too. He took off his underwear and pulled back the curtains to join her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh good morning my love&quot; her voice rang like a bell. She was really quite pretty now. Her lips were thicker, her face overall feminine . Her eyes were larger and now had a hint of green piercing through. &quot;Ha I knew it! I&#39;m definitely taller!&quot; She was right, maybe only a couple inches shorter than Chaz now, making her a cool 5&#39;4. &quot; This is crazy, seriously babe, I woke up and my bras just don&#39;t fit anymore, like I was an A cup but noooope not anymore. My jeans? Well they&#39;re big on me in some places but my hips are pulling them in others and seriously just look at me! I didn&#39;t know working out could cause you to get taller too!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...&quot; Chaz was looking for aome excuse to say. &quot;Some people go through late growth spurts, maybe this is just yours? But you&#39;re right you look incredible babe!&quot; Her hair was healthier and longer too. It looked fuller and seemed to have highlights poking through. These were definitely unexpected changes, albeit welcome, but very much unexpected.<br />
<br />
&quot;And that&#39;s not all&quot; she cooed, pulling him in close for a deep kiss. She was biting at his lip, pulsating energy throughout his body, he didn&#39;t think he could get so hard. &quot;Come on babe, skip class for just one day&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I really need to-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, you&#39;ve got a newly hot girl begging for your dick? And you&#39;re going to turn that down?&quot; She pouted with a sinister look in her eye. This was so unlike her. Honestly though, with how quick she was changing, it might be best for him to stay home and make some more observations.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok yeah of course, the fuck am I thinking!?&quot; Chaz replied. She was right, she was super cute now, not the hotest on the block, but really cute. He really liked her like this too. Her skin was clearer, her overall presence seemed to glow and honestly, he was just happy with how much she was feeling herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Finally, ok well, today&#39;s my day off so let&#39;s go do some stuff! For one... I think I need new clothes since well... Nothing really fits me now.&quot; She started to pump at Chaz&#39;s cock &quot;but first, Im still feeling a certain way from last night.&quot; She turned around revealing her now more prominent ass cheeks to him. Chaz didn&#39;t need a full explaination as he immediately penetrated her and began thrusting her up against the shower walls. Her moans echoed throughout the house. <br />
<br />
&#39;Holy shit, was she tighter?&#39; Chaz thought. He had never felt so good having sex with Mara before infact it didn&#39;t take long at all for him to cum just like the night before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? Damnit babe.&quot; Mara didn&#39;t hide it at all this time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Im... I&#39;m sorry I-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No Im sorry, its fine Im just... REALLY horny lately.&quot; She started to clean herself off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really I could finish you off!&quot; Chaz pleaded<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah thanks, that would be nice.&quot; Chaz nelt down on his knees and began licking Mara and sucking on her pussy. She was really getting into it but no matter how hard they tried and no matter how long they stayed in the shower, she just wasn&#39;t getting there again. &quot;Well you tried and I appreciate it but Im getting a bit sore babe.&quot; Mara tried yet again to hide her frustrations. &quot;Anyways let&#39;s just head to the mall.&quot; Chaz nodded in agreeance, his neck was killing him now from trying to eat her out while she stood there in the shower. He felt like a failure. What was up with him lately? Why couldn&#39;t he please her? Did the gene therapy hinder her orgasm or was she just loosing interest in him? Whatever the reason it hampered the mood for him for the rest of the day and although she was sweet to him for most of the day he was a little frustrated with how she treated him when he came prematurely.<br />
<br />
The night came all too slowly for him, but it finally came. It was 12:30 a.m. and Mara had already knocked out on their bed again. He went in for another injection but this time he stood up and contemplated whether he should start dosing himself to keep up. If she continued on this path would she loose interest in a pathetic nerd like him? Wait no what was he talking about? They were in love, it was just a slight rough patch in their sex life. He would just have to start researching better ways to make her orgasm is all. Infact it was articles like that which he fell asleep to in the end.</p>
