<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In the many years he had been at the shop the Barber rarely ever received a knock at his back door. From years of nonuse the door gave a slight groan as he opened it. He was just happy that it actually opened and not break off. On the other side he found two heavy set black men in their late 40. They wore clothes with the logo of the electric company. One greeted him holding up his company ID badge while the other stood in the background checking some papers on a clipboard and then looking at the building, back and forth, with a very confused expression.<br />
“Hello sir, how are you today?” The man at the door asked in that cheery tone that makes you know he doesn’t really want to know how you are today, it’s just part of the job to ask. “We’re from ConEd and we’re dong some repair work in the area. You know checking lines and such.”<br />
“Oh, very good, would you like to come in?”<br />
“Thank you sir. BILL!” He screamed over his shoulder at his partner. The two men walked into the back of the store up to the front room. They were tired, jeans just a little too low on the hips, shirts stained with sweat. Their heads covered with what might have at one time been bright orange safety helmets, but due to the dirt and dents, were now a duller tone. Work gloves without fingers on each man’s hands. The first man, Henry was embroidered on his work shirt, checked the bottom of his boots before entering the main Barbershop area. He let out a low whistle. “Will you look at this? An honest to God BarberShop. Not a frickin’ Salon or nothing, but a BarberShop. You even got one of those old Barber poles spinning out front?”<br />
“I sure do”<br />
“Mind telling us what powers it” The other man, Bill asked, looking away for once from his clipboard and its papers<br />
“Excuse me?” the Barber asked<br />
“We’re checking the line in the area, making sure no one’s spliced in anything they shouldn’t, no one’s been tampering with the voltage meters.”<br />
“I assure you I haven’t touched my electric meter. I’m not even sure where it is.”<br />
“Yea funny that.” Bill said starting to flip his papers at the Barber “We can’t even find any cables or wires leading into this building. Better yet any meter to record that power.  Plus we checked with headquarters, there’s no billing record history for this location”<br />
“And incomplete records trouble me so.” The Barber said   “I obviously have power.”<br />
“And you have power.”<br />
“Well it’s not like the store magically powers itself now is it? You’re free to look around. It’s an old building so the power cables you’re looking for are probably in the basement. But again, since it’s an old building so please be careful down there.”<br />
“Thank you, sir. We will have a look around.” Breaking out their large flashlights the two men headed down the steps and into the cellar of the store.<br />
“Great” the Barber muttered “How am I going to deal with these two without the Power Company finding out? Going to need some candidates to replace them. And I think that’s a queue for the front bell to chime”<br />
Ding a ling<br />
“Bingo.”<br />
The two teens that walked into the shop didn’t stop their arguing for the better part of a minute, completely ignoring the Barber standing in front of them.<br />
“Man look LOOK, we’re wasting our time. It’s a BarberShop man, not a Salon like you find back home. They don’t do stuff like that, Mister you don’t do stuff like that do you?” The taller of the teens asked suddenly acknowledging the Barber existence,<br />
“Like what, young man?”<br />
“We’ve got big dates tonight, first dates with these girls we just met in college and I think if we had a facial, it would make us look better.” The other teen stated.<br />
“But you can’t possibly do things like that can you?”<br />
“Well certainly I can. This might be a Barber Shop but please consider it your Metrosexual headquarters.”<br />
“We’re not queers, dude, we just have class.”<br />
“And oily skin. But please, I think I can certainly accommodate your needs today gentlemen. I have some products you just won’t find anywhere else, and you’ll be surprised at the price. If you’d each like to take a chair I can get right to work.”<br />
“I don’t know man” The first teen whispered to his buddy. “Did you hear him when we came in, I swear he was playing Bingo.  How up to date can this place be?” <br />
Ignoring his friend’s concerns the second teen decided to go with the situation. “Should we take our shirts off?” <br />
“You may take off what ever you like sir. The dress code in the shop is always open to interpretation.  And as for the code of conduct, well….”<br />
“Just because we hang out together and share the same dorm room and want facials, it does not mean were Queers, Dude!!!!”<br />
“Noted. If you don’t want your shirt to get wet then, yes, take it off and hang it on the coat rack.” The Barber said having had just about enough of his two clients. <br />
“Davin, if this comes out looking like shit, or I break out, you’re paying for it.” The taller of the teens said taking his shirt off and hanging it on the coat rack. His was a pretty none spectacular college boy, late teens but still going through a lot of puberty. Lots of hair under the pits but only a ring around each nipple. What would have been a treasure trail leading from his belly button down if it as on a bit of a firmer belly.  <br />
“Aaron, let’s just get this done and back to the campus.  We don’t have all day.” The second teen said.  He was a little stockier than his friend, but not much different than that.  <br />
After the two teens got into the chairs, the Barber covered then with cloths and leaned them back.  He ran some water in the sink then pumped some lotion into his hands.  He took care to cover the teen’s faces with the lotion, paying special attention to their chins and mouths.  While that area originally started off smooth, he could feel the rough stubble begin to grow.  Originally it started in a pattern that might have matched the teen’s original hair growth given time but as the hairs grew out more and more, it obviously was advancing the pattern in new directions.  The two teens continued to lay back with their eyes closed, smiling.<br />
“And did you gentlemen say you also wanted a styling done?”<br />
“Yes, just a touch up.” <br />
“A touch up it will be.”<br />
The Barber went to work on the teen that apparently had the idea to come into the shop in the first place, Davin.  After washing the teen’s hair, the Barber moved his chair back into a sitting position.  His beard had grown out thick and busy.  The mustache full, covering the upper lip completely.  A good growth of beard, which the Barber began to trim slightly at the bottom, giving it a rounded edge.  It reached so low it obscured his neck.  While the hair in his beard had come in with a slight red sheen to it, he had become a solid red head, with only slight highlights of the original brown left.  His hairline had moved back a bit and thinned out as the hair length in the back of his head had lowered.  It almost gave the teen a bit artistic look.  But it certainly wasn’t the look most 17 year olds had.  The teen, Davin opened his eyes and while surprised at what he saw in the mirror, did not react as strongly as one would think.  He pulled is hand out from under the cloths and started stroking the beard, amazed at it’s thickness and texture.  This was going to take some care, combing out everyday, watching how he ate to keep grease out and he certainly couldn’t smoke cigarettes anymore, it’d be a fire hazard.  He’d have to switch to cigars.<br />
Leaving the teen to continue to stare at himself, the Barber switched to the other chair, where Aaron waited.  Taking out his beard clippers the Barber went to work on the teen’s chin and the sides of his face.  The length of the clippers was down to the skin as usual, but left what looked like a two or three day’s growth behind.  Aaron would learn though this was the usual length of beard he would grow by the end of the workday.  The Barber didn’t touch the mustache or that little plug of hair under the teen’s lower lip.  All the time the beard was being cut down, the mustache had kept growing.  It now more than covered both the upper and lower lip, and continued down the sides of the mouth and off the face.  Giving a butch cross between a Fu Manchu and a walrus.  The Barber then went to work on the teen’s styling.  Turing on his hair trimmer with a clack, the sides of the teen’s hair were the first to go, with a fade to the top.  The top would take longer to style and the use of a comb but after years of giving men flat tops, it was pretty routine for the Barber at this point.  When he was done the teen had a perfect landing strip on top of his head.  Holding the mirror for the teen to see the horseshoe pattern that gave the pointed tip the hung slightly over this forehead.  A high and tight hair cut that looked a bit out of place on someone so young.   The hair on Aaron’s head now only a fragment as long as the hair pouring out from his upper lip like a fountain.<br />
“How do you like it so far gentlemen?” The Barber asked.<br />
“It’s really not what we wanted.”<br />
“ But it’s what you needed, isn’t it?”<br />
“Yea.” The teen Davin said getting out of the chair and walking over to the mirror.  As he moved the cloth fell off him, showing while he still had his teen body, a good amount of body hair had also grown in.  Aaron followed, also showing a good amount of body hair had grown in, and also appeared a little shorter than before.  As he ran his hands over his chest and now furrier belly, Davin ran his hands over his forehead, fining more of it showing.   The both still seemed to be teens, but very different teen than had walked into the store, more working class, less concerned about their appearances.  They were still checking out their appearances when the two electric company workers came up from the basement.<br />
“Hey, Mister.  There’s nothing down there.   No cables, no nothing.  And while we’re not with the Water Company, we can’t even find any water pipes leading into the building.  They usually go side by side with the electrical.”<br />
“How very odd.” The barber said brushing the chairs off. “Why not have a seat and we’ll talk about it.”<br />
“I think we should report this back to…”<br />
“Nah, wait man” the other worked said heading to the chair, “I want to hear what he has to say.” He passed the two teens looking at themselves still in the mirror. “What’s with them?”<br />
“Just admiring my work.”  The Barber said “And each other”<br />
With that the two teen broke eye contact with themselves in the mirror and locked eyes on each other.  Without a word they embraced and started kissing, deeply mixing their new facial hair together.<br />
“Yea, like this place wasn’t strange enough already.” <br />
“Just relax gentlemen.  Lean back.  As for your concerns out where the power for this shop comes from” The Barber said taking the clip board from the one worker, “Well, that’s just too obvious even to follow up on.  So the day’s not a total loss, how about a trim?”<br />
The Barber walked in back of the men and removed their safety helmets.  Instead of the typical hair one would expect to find on a 45 + black man, the two men found long straight black hair falling out of their helmets, reaching almost to their laps.  While the men stared at that in disbelief, their eyes were in the right places to find one of the teens reaching over and starting to undo their work belts.  And once they had those unbuckled, the zippers were close behind.  Reaching into the workman’s pants the teen pulled out the lengthening black cocks and slowly started jacking them off.  The workmen remained startled, but also remained in place.  After getting the cocks long enough and  heads out of the foreskin sheaths, the teens lowered their busy mouths onto the members.  The men had been working all day, their cocks salty with sweat and other residue.  A deep musky flavor the teens found they liked and would want more of.  <br />
As they sucked the workmen off, the teens started to change.  Each one apparently taking some to the weight and build of the man they were deep throating, and more.  As Aaron grew he became stockier, squarer in build and appearance.  A real sparkplug type of guy.  Shoulder’s wide but not with that narrow of a waist.  The stomach, not flabby, but you had to look to see the six pack laying under the effects of a few too many six packs.  His face got a bit of a double chin as his hair thinned out.  The flat top becoming a bit shorted and thinner on top.  His hands were now rougher around the cock as his took on the work experiences from the man.  His arms became firmer, biceps growing large and defined.  His legs like short tree trunks barely encased in the now tight faded jeans he wore.   While he remained Caucasian, his skin reddened due to long exposure to the sun, his arms darker than his head, with an almost leathery texture.<br />
Davin though aged and grew out even more.  Since he was bending over the workman’s lap to suck his cock, the Barber could see Davin’s belly expand like a water balloon.  A water balloon made from a beachball more like it.  His pecs became larger man tits but still firm from all the work he was now going to be requited to do.  They sagged down on top of his belly.  Arms bigger than his partners but not as defined.  His ass, well, there was something to say for a big man’s ass and that’s what Davin got and loved.  As the hair continued to from on his chest, arms and back, the red hair on his head continued to move back.  As it receded, it left more and more of a shinny dome.  Not even some wispy light hairs left, just pure skin back to the horseshoe circling the back of his head.  The skin also reddened due to exposure.  While still technically in their teens, the teens looked more like they were in their late 20’s, as most young bear cubs did.<br />
The two men in the chair also had been changing as well.  With their weight and girth taken from them the two workers were changing healthier version of the black men they currently were.  Gone were the thick bellies and wide asses.  They were replaced with firm muscles and bubble butts that only youth and hours of training could give them.  The muscles they had from work remained but evened out.  Leaner where lean looked better, thicker where thickness was needed.  And still the long black hair, now slightly sweaty, rested on their heads and waited.  <br />
“Almost there fella’s” Davin said taking his mouth off the long black cock he had been going down on throughout the transformation.  “But don’t you think it’s time we got to business?”<br />
The two black men looked each other in the eye and pushed off the cloths covering them. They were only wearing well-worn jeans with no shirts, just like the two men who had been sucking them off.  Their bodies long and lean.  Pecs high solid, with dark black nipples firm.  They pushed their pants down with Henry throwing his legs up in the air, but Bill standing up briefly and bending over, exposing his asshole to white man. The two bears had continued to stroke their hard cocks while the black men positioned themselves. Davin’s cock appearing smaller than before, but mainly due to the large amount of weight hanging off the man’s belly.  Aaron’s cock as still long and thicker than before.  The two black men bit their lips as they had the deep red dicks pushed into them.<br />
 And as they fucked the ages started to exchange.  While the two teens had looked older due to the hair patterns and work clothes, now they started showing real age.  Aaron started aging first, but did not age that far.  His face took a more rugged edge, like he was growing into it.  Slight crinkle to the eyes and hand a rougher texture around the knuckles.  He ended in his mid 30’s.  Davin after he started aging, picked up speed.  Aging quite a bit, far past the mid 40’s the black men had been.  Well into his 50’s, face older, hair going from a vivid red to a duller red with gray streaks.  Eyebrows growing out like a wizard from a Lord of the Rings type fantasy.  His body settled in with the weight and age now.  Belly flapping over the top of his pants.  Double chin sagging a bit more. His nose got a bit bigger and redder since now the safety helmet that would be his didn’t reach far out enough in front to always keep it out of the sun.   <br />
And as they were fucked, the two black men became younger. They were becoming younger with every pump in their ass.  Down past the 30’s and 20’s till somewhere in the middle teens, but still legal.  If only street legal.  Their skin becoming smoother, tighter.  Scars from years of outside work disappearing.  Arms, becoming leaner and leg’s gathering more toned qualities.  Their bodies thinned out a bit, becoming leaner and a bit less muscles above the waist, but legs getting stronger.  The asses that were being fucked became firmer, more muscled. The little body hair they had fell out, except for small tuffs in their armpits.  Their cocks lengthen, longer and longer, to almost 10 inches.  A deepened brown than the rest of them, bobbing up as down as they continued to be fucked.<br />
In a short time the breathing of all four men got heavier, more rapid.  Davin sweating due to the exercise he obviously didn’t get on that regular basis.  Each of the teens getting fucked smiling more and more and they came close to not only coming, but also getting their asses filled with cum.<br />
Then sudden burst and the two olden men came at once.  The two adults pushing their cock all the way into the firm hairless smooth asses. A small about of cum dripped back out of the ass Aaron was fucking and puddled on the seat.  The young black men were still jacking themselves off, close to cumming but not yet. <br />
Pulling out the two adults breathed deeply, and tried to get their faces back to a normal shade of white, not the flushed red they were now.  The two teens collapsed on the chair but didn’t seem all that put out by the physical exhaustion they just went through. On the contrary, their smiles never went down. And neither were their erections. The two black teens automatically held their hands out for a slap from his buddy.  <br />
“Damn nice fuck there kids.” Davin said reaching into his back pocket and pulling out his wallet. “Just be more careful who you come up to out there.  Not all Com Ed guys are as willing as Aaron ‘n Me.”  He pulled out a few bills and tossed it to the teens.  “Sorry for the mess sir.” He said turning to the Barber. “But when you’re working in the field and the opportunity come up…”<br />
“Can’t pass up the opportunity to cum.” Davin said jokingly, also putting his safety helmet on. “There two on you?” he asked his partner.<br />
“Ain’t they always.” Davin pulled a cigar out of his tool belt. “ Got a little something in the ‘Stache there partner.” Davin said pointing to Aaron’s large mustache. <br />
 Aaron looked in the mirror and took out the small mustache comb from his pocket.  With that growth it was now a contact companion.  He combed out the wiry hair into a presentable condition.  “We better get a move on.  Hey, sorry about the confusion about your power flow Mister.”<br />
“You found the source of the confusion and will report back to your bosses that everything is OK.” The Barber said in what should have been a question, but sounded more like a command.<br />
“Correct.”<br />
“Please see yourself out gentlemen while I finish up with these two young men.  Have a good day at work” The Barber said turning back to the two longhaired black teens kissing in his barber chairs.  “If you’d like I can complete the work we started?’<br />
“Hey sure.” Henry said taking his mouth off of Bill’s. “But what were you going to do?  And what’s with this hair?”<br />
“You’d asked for a slight trim of the ends to take care of any split hairs, then you wanted these feathers braided in a couple of places.”<br />
“Oh yea.  Sure go ahead.  Do you mind if we…?” the black youth asked as he continued to finger his hard cock.<br />
“Go right ahead.  You won’t be in my way at all.”<br />
The Barber took a couple a minutes to clip just the end of the teen’s long hair before he started twisting the feather into braids.  The hung from the end of long braid towards the front of the faces, which continued to change some more.  <br />
The teens’ skin began to lighten but not go white, just a honey brown, slightly worn from wind and sun.  The deep brown/black tone lighted up but loss none of its smoothness.  Their nosed lengthen, grew out almost hawk like but lost little of their width.,  Their cheekbones became almost shelf like on their faced.  Popping out from under eyes the remained brown but grew larger.  Their lips thinned out some but still had a strong pout to the lower lip.  The rest of their bodies changed to match he skin tone.  Their waist thinned a bit more and their asses filled in, from hours of horseback riding.  Shoulders grew out and peaked.  Their dicks only lightening a bit, not that anyone would have noticed considering how much blood was being pumped into them to keep them up.  When the Barber was done with his hair, Henry leaned over to his buddy Bill’s dick and stocked it for him, while continuing to do his own.  It was only a short time before the two American Indian youths shot their loads as never before.  <br />
“I forgot to ask. What tribe are you from?”<br />
“Cherokee.”  Henry answered in a younger voice, slightly more nasal than before, but still deep.  <br />
“Cherokee.  Are feathers in the hair traditional for your tribe?”<br />
“Who the fuck knows.  The tourist loves it though.  We walk thought he crowds at the rodeo and they all want pictures with us.  After asking if we speak English”<br />
“Duh.  Some guy in Toronto said it was a sign when an Indian male wore feathers in his hair on the rodeo circuit that they’re up for a fuck.” Henry said giggling with his buddy. <br />
“Shit man, most of the guys we run into are up for a fuck no matter what’s in our hair.” Bill said running his hand through his long black hair, finding bits of cum resting in the strands. “Guess some dried cum would be a good clue too but, might get us too much attention.”  <br />
“Well, I’m glad you stopped by while dropping off those flyers.  Always willing to help our working boys any way I can.  There, how’s that?”<br />
The two teenage Native American boys looked in the mirror at the feathers now hanging from their hears.<br />
“Cool, very cool.  Great work man.  So you don’t mind putting the poster up in the window?”<br />
“My pleasure.  You’re only in town till next weekend then.” The Barber said reading the small yet colorful poster handed to him by one of the teens.  “Then you travel out of the area for a while?”<br />
“Maybe forever.  We’ve crossed the country twice already and I’m not 100% sure we’ll be signing on for another tour.  No matter how much extra money we can pick up on the side. “ Bill said slipping the half of the bills he got from the workers into his worn jeans.  He, like his buddy Henry, pulled worn sweaty tank top t-shirts out of their back pants pockets where they had been hanging all this time.  “ Who knows when we’ll be back.”<br />
“Who indeed.”</p>
