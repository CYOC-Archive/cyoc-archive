<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer sat up and stretched. Today was going to be a good day, she could already feel it. As she started getting ready for school, she walked around the room, gathering her clothing for the day. Cute but modest was her motto. She grabbed her A-cup bra before realizing her mistake. She had recently bought a minor B-cup bra, so she grabbed that. Though her breasts probably wouldn&#39;t get much larger thanks to genetics, she couldn&#39;t ignore the stuffed feeling she had been having in the smaller bra.<br />
<br />
As she got out of the shower, she admired herself in the mirror. Her deep raven-black hair dripping down her back. She &#39;might not be as developed as some of the cows at the school,&#39; she thought jealously to herself, &#39;I&#39;ve got it where it matters, and I know how to use it too!&#39; as she gave a little flick of her butt for the mirror. If she continued developing, she was confident that she could pass for a queen of K-Pop. She just needed the chance. Her career in cheerleading was just a start.<br />
<br />
She finished getting ready for school, then slipped on her shoes as she left her home. She always felt a little awkward being the only Asian riding the bus, but she had long since come to terms with the lack of diversity in her town.<br />
<br />
As she got on the bus, she realized that her chest had been feeling a little tight since she had left home. &#39;Oh no, I must&#39;ve grabbed my old bra. One more day of annoyance I guess. How they used to fit themselves into corsets I have no idea...&#39; she thought up onto the bus. &#39;Guess I&#39;ll just need to make sure I bring my new C bra tomorrow.&#39;<br />
<br />
This time, she unconsciously took a seat on the opposite side of the bus to avoid the sun. Too much sun would ruin her fair complexion. She quickly looked around to make sure nobody would pay attention, then adjusted her bra. She really regretted taking her old one. She felt like could spill out over it at any point in time. She maneuvered into a position where her girls felt just a little more comfortable. Finally, the bus reached the school.<br />
<br />
As Jennifer made her way out of the bus and into the school, a voice called out, &quot;Jenny!!!&quot; Jennifer turned around to see her friend Caroline running up to her. &quot;Hi Cara!!!!&quot; She waved back fiercely, hugging her long-time friend as they approached. Jennifer and Caroline&#39;s twin peaks pushing tightly against eachother. Suddenly, Jennifer both felt and heard a ripping POP sound, as her bra suddenly burst from the induced pressure. Jennifer&#39;s face turned scarlet as Caroline looked at her apologetically. &quot;Ohmygosh! I&#39;m so sorry Jen! What happened?&quot; Jennifer sheepishly looked at her friend, &quot;I grabbed the wrong bra this morning. Guess it was only a matter of time before I broke free. You&#39;re a little bigger than me, do you have a spare bra I can use?&quot; Caroline had undergone puberty a bit earlier than the rest of their group of friends, and had more time to develop into her D&#39;s. She also had the added benefit of not being Asian, a luxury which Jennifer secretly begrudged her. The stereotypical image of attraction was a beautiful blonde white woman with huge breasts. Qualities that hundreds of years of culture had bread out of Jennifer&#39;s family line. She hated it. &#39;Why do the plump cow udders get all the attention? It&#39;s not like they helped out much during sex anyways!&#39; She would think to herself in her rare moments of insecurity.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course! Luckily we still got a while before class. I think I&#39;ve got one in my gym locker. Let&#39;s go!&quot; So they made quick tracks for the locker room. When they arrived, it was completely deserted. Class wasn&#39;t for a while, and the gym wouldn&#39;t be active until midday. So they made their way to Caroline&#39;s locker. As Jennifer took off her top and unhooked what remained of her bra, Caroline kept up their conversation. The mundane back and forth was ended after a few moments of Caroline being silent. &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Jennifer asked quizzically, preparing to hook the new bra around her back. It was much roomier than either the broken bra or the one that she had left at home.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, I just get jealous of you sometimes. You&#39;ve got this amazing body with smooth skin, and great hair! All I&#39;ve got going for me are these balloons of fat that get me nothing but lecherous stares!&quot; Jennifer was taken aback, as she&#39;d just been thinking jealous thoughts about her friend. &quot;Oh c&#39;mon, surely having big sensitive breasts is awesome! And you can&#39;t tell me you don&#39;t enjoy at least *some* of those stares. Like Josh on the football team?&quot; <br />
<br />
Caroline blushed, &quot;That&#39;s...different! You can&#39;t tell me it wouldn&#39;t get annoying if everyone looked at you like a piece of meat on a stick!&quot; Jennifer thought about it for a second. She was always ignored, or told to be quiet. Onlookers&#39; gazes always passed over her and to her friends. &quot;I don&#39;t know, people in America don&#39;t really find Asians that sexy. Unless they&#39;re nerds of course, but who gives a shit about them? They beat off to pixels on their TV screens.&quot; Jennifer snorted in laughter at the idea.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s not true Jen! I mean...I find Asians sexy.&quot; Caroline countered in defense.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s not the same though, I mean Asian *women*. Unless you&#39;re a complete whore with broken english, offering to &quot;Sucky sucky five dolla&quot; they don&#39;t even look your way. Even Asian men don&#39;t find us sexy compared to western cows. No offense of course.&quot; The unintentional insult was brushed off by Caroline, &quot;Jen...I don&#39;t mean men. I mean sure, I&#39;ve always thought your brother was hot, but you&#39;re so beautiful! I really envy your soft, supple skin, and slim features. Especially when these puppies give me back cramps like you wouldn&#39;t believe!&quot; Caroline motioned to her bosom. Jennifer was following the conversation, but the math had suddenly added up in her head. &quot;Wait, Caroline, are you...into girls?&quot; Jennifer asked in a sensitive manner. Caroline nodded, &quot;I don&#39;t dislike boys but...I don&#39;t really know. Isn&#39;t high school and college for figuring that stuff out?&quot; she shrugged. Jennifer agreed with her friend. The more she thought about it, the less she knew where she stood on it. Sure, guys were dream-boats, but they were so rough! Of course you needed a guy to have a baby in nature, but Jennifer reasoned that there were plenty of people pushing them out, so did it really make a difference?<br />
<br />
Jennifer returned, &quot;You know, now that you mention it I&#39;m not so sure myself. You&#39;re kinda right, girls do have their qualities in contrast to guys.&quot; Jen was warming up, despite the fact that she still hadn&#39;t secured the bra or lowered her shirt back down.<br />
<br />
Caroline and Jennifer locked eyes, similar thoughts echoing through their mind. Of course class was soon, but they still had a little time before then. &quot;Well, maybe do you wanna...see what it&#39;s like?&quot; Jennifer suggested. Caroline&#39;s eyes grew a little wider while she mouthed &#39;sure.&#39; Jennifer and Caroline collided, and started by innocently kissing eachother. But as the kisses intensified, they started questing down further and further on their counterpart. Soon, they were in a pile on the bench, eating eachother&#39;s muff. Jennifer was a little hairy, while Caroline sported a neatly trimmed strip above her slit.<br />
<br />
As their techniques grew more passionate, Jennifer felt a familiar pressure building up inside. As Caroline&#39;s body shuddered, she knew that the feeling was mutual. They both shot a minuscule spattering of cum out and they gradually slowed their face-fucking to a halt.<br />
<br />
As they got cleaned up and into their clothes, Jennifer admired herself (and the unnoticed changes) in the mirror. Her pants had become skinny jeans which accented her heart-shaped ass. Her t-shirt had become a top with a cleavage window which only displayed a small peek of the crevice her D&#39;s formed. She was wearing Caroline&#39;s double-D Bra, which made her bosom look slightly larger than it was. As she adjusted her boob window forward, her and Caroline made their way to class. &quot;Was fun Carrie! Hope you have fun day in classes!&quot; a little bit of her accent came through. It had been a while since her family had moved away from South Korea, but she still retained a little bit of the old country. It didn&#39;t help that her mother didn&#39;t speak much English, so she frequently had to translate between the two tongues. Little did she know, her command of the English language would soon be minimal.</p>
