<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff smirked easing himself back on the bench as he now split his attention between the first graders and the pair of preschoolers. Amazingly it seemed that with a friend his age, Harry was now calmer. The whiny, spoiled child Jeff had originally gotten to know, replaced with a surprisingly relaxed kid that seemed to play well with others.<br />
<br />
Still, after sometime of splitting his attention, Jeff was growing tired. It was difficult trying to split his attention between a group of first graders who needed to be watched and a pair of preschoolers that Jeff certainly couldn&#39;t leave alone. Fidgeting he now looked at the Chronovac. &quot;I guess I can switch those two back on the way home,&quot; he shrugged. <br />
<br />
Scanning Becky and Harry, Jeff now aged the two preschoolers to six. The children now grew slightly, their clothes adjusting to their first grade frames. As the process completed though Jeff paused. Harry was different now. <br />
<br />
When Harry had been six the first time, Jeff had noted the boys mullet haircut. At the time he had thought nothing of it, if anything Jeff took it as a sign that the boy was a bit of a troublemaker. Now, Harrys hair was shorter, still possessing the thickness but styled in a little boys style. Curiously Jeff continued to watch the pair as memories slowly filtered into his head.<br />
<br />
Harry and Becky were friends with the others but often times would play by themselves. The couple were inseparable, complimenting eachothers weaknesses. Becky helped calm Harrys wilder impulses, while he helped the girl open up socially with the others. Gazing at the pair Jeff initially thought they would go and join the others. Instead the pair now began calmly useing the slide, their childish laughter echoing above the din of the playground. &quot;Could growing up together have altered Harry that much,&quot; Jeff thought.<br />
<br />
Jeff now began to think. He was amazed that the Chronovac could alter the boy so much with just the introduction of one additional person.  Harrys new best friend had caused the boy to do a complete 180 in his attitude and mannerisms. &quot;I wonder,&quot; Jeff thought as he looked at the Chronovac. He was about to perform an experiment, one that could easily be undone if need be.<br />
<br />
Pressing the Chronovac, Jeff now eagerly watched the newly minted 6 year olds closely. Slowly but surely the duo was growing taller, their clothing stretching with them as they aged. Soon the couple were 8 year olds, then 9, and then 10. The children were now entering late childhood, their clothing shifting with them.<br />
<br />
Harry now sported a Batman shirt, the logo emblazoned on its front with a pair of blue jeans. Jeff noting the boy seemed amazingly laid back as he happily chatted with Becky. Becky simply giggled, the raven haired girls hair tumbling past her shoulders. The 10 year olds clothing had also changed, a pink tshirt with leggings with pink and black sneakers to match. Jeffs memories of this new reality slowly filtering into his head.<br />
<br />
He often times saw the pair at this park, along with Beckys younger brothers. Although only children themselves, they were both amazingly responsible, keeping an eye on the 8 year old twins as well as the younger ones in the group. Jeff now recalled how he had heard Tommy mention how cool Harry was, the laid back fifth grader who had a warm smile and easy going personality. The girls opinions of Becky were similar, Hannah, Jane, and Lizzie gushing about how smart and how nice Becky was. The 10 year old acting as kind of a adopted big sister the younger ones could confide in.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll be damn,&quot; Jeff whispered as he watched the pair. &quot;Who would have thought one person could make such a difference in a person&#39;s life.&quot; Jeff though was still curious, just how big of a change had Becky made in Harrys life.<br />
<br />
Activating the Chronovac again, Jeff watched as the pair began growing older once more. Harry now shot up in height, the first steps of puberty beginning to take hold. Jeff watched as Harry became 13, then 14, his clothing shifting once again. A button down short sleeved shirt now rested on the young teen with a plain white tshirt underneath. Harrys sneakers now becoming a pair of white Keds with ankle socks. The now high-school Freshman sporting a warm yet confident smile with thick dirty blonde hair.<br />
<br />
Beckys appearance also changed, the girl receiving the gift of puberty, her hips beginning to flair slightly as her breasts returned. Becky, unlike Harry though, appeared to be simpler in regards to dress. Sporting a sleeveless lime green shirt with a pair of blue jeans and canvas sneakers, the raven haired cutey now beamed at Harry before tenderly holding the boys hand.<br />
<br />
Flashes of this reality now came to Jeffs mind. Harry and Becky were Freshman at his school. Harry, was a boyishly handsome guy, Jeff recalling hearing some of the Sophomore girls swooning over him. The young teen was confident yet reserved, maintaining a rather laid back approach to life. Jeff recalling how Harry would always give everyone a polite wave or a warm smile as he seemed to stroll through the halls of school. &quot;Great hes cooler than I am already,&quot; Jeff chuckled.<br />
<br />
While Harry was seen as one of the cool kids already, he remained modest thanks in part to his best friend/girlfriend Becky. Becky had been Harrys best friend since preschool. Jeff now remembering that until Becky moved into town, Harry had been friendless and lonely. That changed when he met Becky, the two becoming inseparable best friends before sharing their first kiss this past summer. <br />
<br />
Although she felt awkward, (she said she felt too skinny and too tall), Harry often times boosted her confidence while she would help him study. Despite having only started high school, many teachers considered her to be one of the smartest people at the school. Blinking as if coming out of a daze, the high school couple now looked towards Jeff before waving.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Jeff,&quot; Becky called. &quot;Hows babysitting going?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So far so good,&quot; Jeff replied. Becky and Harry smiled, the couple now waving towards the group of first graders. Upon seeing the teenage couple, Jeff listened as Hannah now squealed with joy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Becky!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hannah banana,&quot; Becky chuckled, the raven haired girl taking a knee as tbe excited 6 year old bolted for her. Leaping at Becky, the hyper active 6 year old nearly knocked Becky over as she hugged her babysitter. &quot;I take it you&#39;re excited to see me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hannah nodded, calling for Joey. Jeff now watched as the shy blond boy inched closer, flashing a small grin up at Harry. &quot;You guys being good for Jeff,&quot; Harry grinned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh huh,&quot; the two six year olds replied. Hannah now turned to Becky, a quizzical look on her face. &quot;Are you gonna babysit me again soon?&quot;<br />
<br />
Before Becky could answer, Harry stepped forward, flashing his brilliant smile. &quot;Of course,&quot; he said. &quot;Didn&#39;t your mom say something about watching Hannah this weekend?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But our date,&quot; Becky said nervously. Harry smirked, squeezing his girlfriends hand tightly as he gazed into her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;It can wait,&quot; Harry said softly. &quot;I know you&#39;ve been  dying to see Hannah.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; Becky smiled. Excitedly she now turned to Hannah. &quot;How about this Saturday,&quot; she said happily. &quot;And as a bonus Harry will be watching you too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really,&quot; Hannah exclaimed. &quot;Does that mean Joey can come too?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The more the merrier,&quot; Harry chuckled.<br />
<br />
The young teen couple nodded, laughing softly as their young charges cheered. For Jeff, he simply smiled, amazed that the Chronovac could change someone for the better that easily.</p>
