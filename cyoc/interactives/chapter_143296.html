<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Seeing a picture of the moon. You&#39;ve got the Fangface curse,” I said.<br />
<br />
Cathy wrinkled her nose in mild irritation. “I hate that term,” she told me. “Within the werewolf community, it&#39;s referred to officially as acute, hyperactive lycanthropy. Plus, when someone has it, they certainly aren&#39;t like that shitty cartoon.”<br />
<br />
“No?” I said, still amazed that the ring could apparently do anything, and also that she knew what Fangface was. <br />
<br />
“First off,” Cathy said, her face showing continued irritation, “Fangface didn&#39;t know he was a werewolf, because he was apparently either incredibly stupid, or had suffered some sort of traumatic brain injury.”<br />
<br />
“Secondly,” she said, “A cartoon image, or something that kind of resembles the moon doesn&#39;t work, unless I want it to, and I&#39;m concentrating hard. It&#39;s not the same thing as the actual moon. Third, he actually changes back during the full moon itself when he sees a picture of the sun. That&#39;s not something that ever happens to ANY werewolf, even without my condition, aside from when there&#39;s a lunar eclipse. When the moon is full, I&#39;m staying a werewolf, like it or not, until sunrise.”<br />
<br />
“So, once you see a picture of the full moon, you&#39;re trapped in that form til dawn?” I asked.<br />
<br />
She shook her head. “No. Just when there&#39;s literally a full moon outside. To change back to my normal, vivacious self, I just have to orgasm in my werewolf form, and a few minutes later, I&#39;m back to being human.”<br />
<br />
“Wait, what?” I asked, somewhat stunned. I had planned on making her a horny werewolf, because that was my fetish, but I hadn&#39;t wished it aloud, or even as a separate internal wish. The ring seemed able to read my subconscious now, and had seemingly begun to anticipate what I meant, as opposed to literally what I said. I did what I could to avoid getting completely aroused in front of her just yet though.<br />
<br />
Cathy smirked at me. “Ha ha, kid. Now it&#39;s awkward. You just had to ask..and now you&#39;re grossed out by thinking of me getting off.”<br />
<br />
“Trust me, Cathy,” I replied with a smirk of my own, dropping the &#39;aunt&#39; from in front of her name, “That&#39;s not a turn off at all.”<br />
<br />
It was her turn to look shocked. “Oh..well..heh..” she said, toying with her hair in what was clearly a nervous reaction. “But umm..yeah, I get why they couldn&#39;t show Fangface railing girls or guys, because that&#39;s a VERY  different cartoon. By the end of season one, they&#39;d all be Fangfaces, either by getting bitten or fucked so much they caught it. He wouldn&#39;t necessarily care about villains, unless fucking them was a priority.”<br />
<br />
“So..sex is a way to become a werewolf?” I asked. Again, it was very difficult to keep myself under control. There were some kinky dark fantasies I&#39;d had involving just such a thing.<br />
<br />
“Only if someone&#39;s got acute hyperactive lycanthropy,” she said. “The cum carries a chance of infection. And if you&#39;re infected, you&#39;re not just a werewolf, you&#39;re an acute hyperactive one. It&#39;s a particular strain of lycanthropy, some sort of mutation that they&#39;ve only really noticed springing up in the past fifty years. The bright side is that there&#39;s only like a one hundredth of one percent chance of catching it per encounter..but those kids..there would have been a lot of sex. Plus, biting is kind of an instinct for us, and if you&#39;re bitten by someone with the condition, you catch the mutated form as well.”<br />
<br />
“Interesting,” I replied.  It would be a lie to say I hadn&#39;t fantasized at the idea of a world where werewolves were far more common than even in fanfic, and it seemed like my wish had made that exact scenario plausible. “I&#39;d think there&#39;d be a  lot more werewolves around, though.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, well..ones with my condition are shunned,” she said, frowning. “I mean..I get it. The community as a whole is worried what the government would do if our population exploded. They&#39;re aware of lycanthropes existing, of course. There&#39;s even some regular werewolves working in various sectors of the government, often in the military or espionage sectors. And I&#39;m sure it&#39;s not just in our country either. Logic dictates that most countries would have one or two SOMEWHERE in their ranks.<br />
But one or two isn&#39;t a threat. The moment they caught wind of us suddenly growing our numbers, there&#39;d be backlash.”  <br />
<br />
Cathy&#39;s face had a serious expression. “And the other more normal..” she made air quotes around the word and screwed her mouth into a disdainful smirk, “werewolves look down on us, because of how primal we are when we change. For regular werewolves, bloodline and heritage are a big deal. It&#39;s a really big deal to be able to trace your lineage. Most of us with my condition...we can&#39;t. We might be able to tell you who did it to us, but we couldn&#39;t tell you where they got it from, or anything like that. We&#39;re certainly not good breeding material, because any kids would be born with the condition.  Of course, while they&#39;re eager to shun us, they won&#39;t mention that part of the reason is that they fear us.”<br />
Cathy&#39;s voice took a harder edge, and she smiled. <br />
<br />
“Pound for pound, we&#39;re bigger when we shift, in both height and weight. If they&#39;re five and a half feet tall, they&#39;re six feet, maybe six and a half feet when they&#39;ve changed.  One with my condition is seven feet tall. If they weigh 120 pounds, they&#39;re maxing out at 250 pounds, and that&#39;s being generous. One with my condition is anywhere from 300 to 350.”  Her upper lip curled slightly out of the smile, and it was impossible not to see her nipples fully erect and poking her shirt out ever so slightly.<br />
<br />
“Cathy, you&#39;re..what, six feet almost?” I asked, starting to picture certain dimensions.<br />
<br />
She nodded, and it was impossible not to notice a wild glint in her eyes. “Five ten, but yeah. I&#39;m eight feet tall and 400 pounds. You can imagine how big some of the males with this condition can get. We can take out most of the regular werewolves in a one on one fight. THAT is the real reason they shun us. We&#39;d run every pack. Plus, they can catch the condition from us, which would totally ruin their whole pure bloodline pride. It&#39;s the only disease a werewolf can catch.”<br />
<br />
I was caught between full-on arousal as my mind continued to remind me how much I liked female werewolves, and deep interest in this entire world that existed due to my wish. It seemed like the universe was trying to fill in logic gaps by giving my wish added details, like werewolves having culture and rules and such. It was fascinating.<br />
<br />
“It kind of sounds like your condition isn&#39;t really all that bad,” I told her. “I mean, in the grand scheme of things.”<br />
<br />
She frowned and let out a heavy sigh. “You&#39;re a kid, James.” She held up a hand defensively before I could protest, “Yeah, yeah, I know that legally, you&#39;re an adult..but you&#39;re still a kid. A lot of things that seem really simple and whatnot..just..look, you&#39;ll understand when you&#39;re older.  I know that sounds like a bullshit excuse, but it&#39;s true. Sure, a random cartoon won&#39;t make me change, but think about how many movies use the full moon during outdoor night scenes. Not just horror movies, but regular ones. The evening news LOVES to show us the full moon. Tv too. And the thing is, I don&#39;t have to stare at it at that point. Just a glimpse. Just a single glimpse of it..and the change is gonna happen.”<br />
<br />
Cathy looked incredibly sad, staring off to the side. “I tried to date for awhile, probably til my 30th birthday, but inevitably the moon would fuck that all up. I can&#39;t count the number of dates that ended with me panicking and making some excuse to run off before the wolf takes over.  The idea of living with someone? HA!” she laughed bitterly. “That&#39;s begging for a huge issue, because it&#39;s a guarantee that they&#39;d find out, and people react rather like scared animals when their friend or lover turns into a giant hairy wolf monster.”<br />
<br />
She let out another sigh, and the frown deepened. “It&#39;s lonely, James. But it is what it is. I came to terms with it years ago. “<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m sorry, Cathy..” I said, reaching out and taking her hand in mine. There was a weird irony here. She&#39;d always been a bitch to me and my mom before the wish. Yet the wish I made gave her a valid reason for why. It was a paradox. She hadn&#39;t been a werewolf before, but if she hadn&#39;t been a werewolf, she wouldn&#39;t have been quite such a bitch to us, apparently. I tried not to think about that, or the mildest pang of guilt. Instead, I just tried to give her a small amount of sympathy and comfort.<br />
<br />
She squeezed my hand and smiled. “It&#39;s not all bad, kid,” she replied. “After awhile, I got to the point where my toys could do the job. Plus, there&#39;s a married couple, like me..and they make these videos as..umm..aids for folks with my condition.” She blushed, realizing that she&#39;d taken the conversation back to a very sexual point.<br />
<br />
“So..porn?” I asked, trying not to sound as intrigued as I was.<br />
<br />
“Yeah..usually an attempt at porn with a plot, but it&#39;s definitely not softcore stuff. I&#39;ve met up with them a few times..made a few videos with them and solo stuff too, along with a couple others that are on their payroll. I only can really get out one or two times a year to see them, but..it takes the edge off. Going to a safe place where nobody&#39;s going to intrude, and changing like ten times a day, totally getting my fill of cock and pussy, plus making a bit of money on the side for video residuals and roles. It could be a lot worse.”<br />
<br />
“You&#39;re bi?” I asked. Yup, the wish was ticking pretty much every box I had without ever being asked.<br />
<br />
“All female werewolves are bi,” she said, and a certain amount of her embarrassment had faded. “At least when the wolf is active. The straightest woman in the world can&#39;t help herself if she gets this condition. It&#39;s like the purest, strongest MDMA is pushing through your system. All you want to do is fuck and get fucked. All males are bi too, though it&#39;s more about dominance assertion, as opposed to actual attraction most of the time. Some seek other guys out though. There&#39;s no judgment in our world, unlike in the human world or even the standard werewolf world. There&#39;s an obligation to breed and maintain those all-important bloodlines for them.”<br />
<br />
There was a silence for a moment, and she sighed. “God..all this talk has gotten me riled up. I&#39;m definitely gonna let the wolf out after you&#39;re gone,” she said, only to cover her mouth in shock. “Umm..sorry.  I totally didn&#39;t need to share that. Just..talking about all of this starts making me think about the wolf..and it kind of messes with my inhibitions and willpower.”</p>
