<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“What the hell was that?” Finn demanded.<br />
<br />
They were driving home in the ridiculous tiger-striped Jeep. Finn had been oddly silent the entire ride, and only now, a few minutes from their house, was Finn making a big deal about Jeff’s interaction with Todd. Jeff had been afraid of that. Finn was oddly protective and jealous of everyone who hit on his boyfriend, which was fine, but Todd was just a friend and <I>obviously</I> not Jeff’s type, so Jeff was wondering what the fuck his problem was.<br />
<br />
“That was Todd, one of the smartest people in my class back in high school. You would remember him as the guy who won literally every science fair.” Jeff replied.<br />
<br />
“You’ve never talked to him before.” Finn said flatly. “You acted like you were best friends! That’s weird, bro.”<br />
<br />
“He does my homework.” Jeff said quietly.<br />
<br />
“Oh.” Finn blinked and rubbed his horn. “So that’s how you got good grades…anyways, what was up with the reality distortion thingy?”<br />
<br />
Jeff tapped his claw against the steering wheel, wondering how he’d be able to answer Finn without….well, if he found out Jeff had turned him gay, god help him. What was a safe answer? Jeff’s dad might let slip that he’d turned them all into anthropomorphic animals, so maybe that was the best answer? Jeff had trouble with complex plans and shit. But he <I>did</I> know that the best lies were partially truth.<br />
<br />
“How many anthro-rams are out there? Anthro-tigers?” Jeff replied finally.<br />
<br />
Finn frowned. “None, right? Except us.”<br />
<br />
“Right.”<br />
<br />
“...And?”<br />
<br />
Jeff turned onto his street and pulled into the driveway. He stopped the Jeep and turned to Finn, staring him right in the eyes. Eye contact established trust. Internet advice videos had told him that.<br />
<br />
“What if I told you I changed your dad and my dad and that’s why we’re like this?”<br />
<br />
“With?”<br />
<br />
“A device that altered the laws of reality.”<br />
<br />
“Magic?” Finn snorted and rolled his eyes.<br />
<br />
“Any sufficiently advanced technology can be considered magic or something.” Jeff said. “Todd used to tell me that.”<br />
<br />
“So…you’re telling me you turned us into this?” Finn ran a hand down his form. “Can you prove it? You wanna get all, uh, science-y and stuff, don’t you have to be able to demonstrate it?”<br />
<br />
“I can. But I’m not sure that’s a good idea until Todd gets here.”<br />
<br />
“Why?” Finn demanded angrily. “Who gives a shit what that egghead says?”<br />
<br />
“Because, <I>Finn</I>, our dads are fucking each other. They didn’t fuck each other before. They were just good friends. And I certainly <I>didn’t</I> change their sexuality.”<br />
<br />
Finn stared at Jeff.<br />
<br />
“Jeff, let’s say you’re right. This is the first time you saw your dad and mine fooling around?”<br />
<br />
Jeff nodded.<br />
<br />
Finn frowned again. “Do you…know what else happens during the game?”<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you implying?” Jeff demanded.<br />
<br />
“Oh…nothing.” Finn said, lying poorly and avoiding Jeff’s eyes. “I suppose we’ll find out.”<br />
<br />
They pulled into the driveway. Jeff turned off the Jeep and sat silently, focused on their Tudor. The classic rock music their dad’s loved was still playing. He was completely floored.<br />
<br />
Jeff knew there was more to their new life, but Finn was clearly not comfortable telling him it. What could possibly be awaiting them when they walked back in? He shuddered and gripped the steering wheel, many scenarios playing out in his head.<br />
<br />
“Jeff?” Finn said gently. “We have to let them know Todd is coming over or he won’t be able to help solve your reality-thingy.”<br />
<br />
“True.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t like him.”<br />
<br />
“Who?”<br />
<br />
“Todd. I don’t like telling him this stuff.” Finn said. “We can handle it. You’re smart.”<br />
<br />
“Because he helped me cheat, Finn.”<br />
<br />
“Why not alter reality and make it so <I>you’re</I> smart?”<br />
<br />
That sounded like a recipe for disaster. Jeff was afraid that Finn might use the Chronivac against Todd out of sheer jealousy now. He needed to figure out a way to steer him out of that idea. A little devil’s advocacy might be in order.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, but we’re only boyfriends because I’m on the football team. If I got smarter, I might have ended up dating Todd and turning him into a ram instead.” Jeff theorized. <br />
<br />
It was possible. Maybe even likely. Jeff could see the little wheels turning inside his boyfriend’s head. <br />
<br />
“Maybe…that isn’t a good idea?” <br />
<br />
“No? Well, we can always just turn him gay.” Jeff shrugged. “Then we won’t have to worry about him running off from our parent’s sexcapades.”<br />
<br />
“Dude. No.” Finn blinked. “What the hell is wrong with you? I don’t want that gross nerd anywhere near my dick.”<br />
<br />
“He doesn’t have to be gross…” Jeff mused.<br />
<br />
“No.” Finn clutched Jeff’s arm. “You’re <I>mine</I>.”<br />
<br />
Inwardly, Jeff smiled. Mission accomplished. Finn would be too worried about changing their own status accidentally to screw with Todd. He probably wouldn’t tolerate Todd for very long, though. Fucking jealous boyfriends, man. <br />
<br />
They walked into the house and Jeff froze. Mike and Dave were fucking. Jeff’s dad was on top, pounding Dave’s hole. The older ram’s belly rippled and bounced with each thrust of his dad’s mighty shaft. Musk lay heavy on the air. It made Jeff’s cock hard, and he caught himself chuffing and adjusting himself.<br />
<br />
“Oh! Jeff, Finn, you’re just in time!” Mike grinned. “Finn, you can rim my ass. Jeff, give this old ram a mouthful of tiger meat.”<br />
<br />
“I…” Jeff looked at the eager, older ram. <br />
<br />
Dave’s hand caught his leg and he practically dragged Jeff into position. His pants and jock were around his ankles in less than a second, Dave’s experienced hooflets making short work of his clothing. He wanted to protested, but found himself moaning in pleasure as the ram’s warm, moist muzzle engulfed his turgid tiger cock.<br />
<br />
Behind his muscular father, he could see Finn kneeling and lapping at Mike’s hole. The older tiger moaned and reached back to press the younger ram’s head deeper into his ass. He never let up from bucking into Dave, though.<br />
<br />
Jeff moaned as Dave gave a particular powerful suck.<br />
<br />
God, Dave was just so much better with his mouth than Finn was. Jeff kinda wished he was dating Dave instead. But…he kinda was, if this weekly orgy was any indicator. The older ram did something with his tongue that had Jeff’s claws extending and kneading the carpet.<br />
<br />
“Fuck, Dave.” Jeff moaned, hands going to the ram’s face, stroking his cheek and then settling on the horns for stability. “Your mouth is so good!”<br />
<br />
The tubby ram took that as permission and went to town. Jeff’s fur ruffled and rippled and he found himself purring. Dave was gentle and tender and knew how to suckle. His hoofed hands fondled Jeff’s balls, squeezing them gently. Jeff didn’t know how long he could hold out. Each new movement of the older ram’s tongue had him silently yowling and grimacing in sheer pleasure.<br />
<br />
“Oh! Oh f-fuck!” Mike moaned, his ass being rimmed and his cock pumping in and out of Dave’s puckered hole. “Jeff, c’mere!”<br />
<br />
Jeff looked up, moaning from the older ram’s tender licks and sucks to find his father’s hands gripping his muzzle and bringing him into a kiss. He tried to jerk away, but his father just pulled him harder and he found the older tiger’s tongue probing his mouth.<br />
<br />
The younger tiger swooned, moaning into the incestuous kiss. It was so wrong, yet so right. Jeff couldn’t help himself, hips bucking faster and faster. The disparate feeling warring inside him were enough to bring him straight over the edge into a powerful orgasm. <br />
<br />
“Mmph!” Jeff cried and found his big balls pulling tight and emptying their hefty load into Dave&#39;s eager mouth.<br />
<br />
Mike pulled back and looked down at the older ram as he swallowed his son’s load.<br />
<br />
“That’s it, Jeff, give that old ram a mouthful!” Mike chuckled.<br />
<br />
Mike reached out and tweaked Jeff’s nipples. Jeff moaned and the suckling beneath him increased. He felt so sensitive but, incredibly, he thought he could go again. The older ram beneath him did that thing with his mouth again.<br />
<br />
“I love you dad!” Jeff blurted out as Dave milked his cock.<br />
<br />
“I love you too, son.” Mike said proudly and brought his son in for another kiss.<br />
<br />
Jeff’s balls heaved again and he emptied another load in the older ram’s gullet. He ran his paws over his father’s thickly muscled form. His father’s paws roamed down to Jeff’s muscular asscheeks and pinched them. He was perfect and Jeff was going to be just like him some day. Finn was going to end up just like his old man, with a big, soft belly-<br />
<br />
Jeff came third time, balls pulsing and straining, the older ram beneath him suckling down his load eagerly, like a calf on a cow’s teat. The repeated orgasms were starting to hurt now. Jeff felt the pleasure begin to ebb and pulled out. He sagged back into the couch, gasping,  completely drained, cock too tender to withstand Dave’s gentle suction.<br />
<br />
“Three loads, huh? Almost got your old man beat, bud.” The older ram licked his lips with his thick tongue and grinned.<br />
<br />
“You just like tiger cum you tubby old coot.” Jeff found himself leaning forward and kissing Finn’s father. <br />
<br />
The kiss deepened, Jeff tasting himself on the older ram’s tongue, somehow getting him hard again, He broke off the kiss and found his mouth traveling lover and lower down the older ram, past his lovely belly and around his thick fist of a cock. Dave’s musk was palpable, a much more acrid barnyard stink than Finn’s, suiting the more mature ram’s age. He reached out on paw and fondled Dave’s hefty package.<br />
<br />
“Oh fuck, Mike, you taught your son right!” Dave bleated, cock burping sweet precum in Jeff’s mouth.<br />
<br />
“That’s my boy!” Mike’s proud voice said, muffled by the large ram’s body. “You got me nice and loose back there, Finn, go ahead and give me some of that cream filling!”<br />
<br />
Jeff mimicked Dave’s movements. The ram’s cock twitched and more delightfully sweet pre trickled down his throat. All that alfalfa and hay the herbivore consumed made every load super-sweet. The ram’s underbelly bumped into the young tiger’s head with every pump of his father’s hips.<br />
<br />
There was a loud bleat and Jeff found himself suckling down a thick, musky load of mature ram sperm. It was a hefty load and Jeff had to chug it to keep up, ribbons of semen filling him. The flow trickled off and Jeff crawled out from under the panting ram. <br />
<br />
He burped, tasting Dave’s cum on his lips and smiling. God, that was fucking good. Then he blinked and shook his head. He’d fucked Dave! He was…old! And hot! Wait, he’d kissed his father and got off on it too!<br />
<br />
While Jeff was suffering from post-nut clarity and regret, Finn gave a loud bleat, stamped a cloven hoof, and shoved himself deep in Mike’s hole. His father finished right after, snarling and yowling as he juddered on top of his not-so-secret-lover.<br />
<br />
Pants and wheezes filled the room as the orgy came to an end. Jeff leaned back against the wall, chuffing the scent of their exertions, cock impossibly semi-hard despite three whole loads (four if you counted earlier). Jeff shifted his gaze to Finn and caught the ram staring at him, inspecting him and gauging his reactions.<br />
<br />
“Hey, Mike, Jeff has something to tell you guys.” Finn said, voice raised. <br />
<br />
“Um, right…Todd is coming over and he’s a prude.” Jeff muttered.<br />
<br />
There was a moment of silence. Mike and Dave looked at each other, sharing a smile. Jeff looked down at the floor. This whole situation was beginning to really weird him out.<br />
<br />
“Is he a fan of the Rams?” Mike winked.<br />
<br />
“No.” Jeff said, looking at his dad. “He’s-”<br />
<br />
“A Bear’s fan?” Dave asked hopefully. “Or maybe a Bronco?”<br />
<br />
“No, dads.” Jeff rolled his eyes. “A nerd who can help me understand the homework better.”<br />
<br />
“I mean-” Finn interjected. “-There’s really no telling what might happen, though.”<br />
<br />
Mike raised a brow and shot a look at Jeff.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I showed him my work.” Jeff said. “And I want to show Todd.”<br />
<br />
“Is that…wise?” Mike asked.<br />
<br />
“Probably.” Finn sighed. “He’s super smart, I guess.”<br />
<br />
“Guess we’ll get things cleaned up here, then!” Mike slapped his thigh and smiled at his son and turned to Dave. “Shower?”<br />
<br />
Dave nodded and embraced his father. They went upstairs, Jeff’s dad rubbing the older ram’s belly and whispering in his twitching ear. Jeff heard the door to their master bedroom close and, instead of hearing the shower start, heard the sound of a headboard bumping into a wall. Guess his dad was going for round three. Where the older tiger got all his stamina was beyond Jeff.<br />
<br />
“I-I kissed my dad!” Jeff said, head spinning.<br />
<br />
“Yeah.” Finn shrugged. “I was going to tell you, but I figured I’d get a proper reaction out of you if I kept the whole incest stuff a surprise. Guess the Chroni-thingy was real.”<br />
<br />
“Why was that so hot?” Jeff muttered quietly.<br />
<br />
“Because he’s hot and it’s taboo?” Finn shrugged.<br />
<br />
They entered Jeff’s room and Jeff pulled up the minimized window. Finn looked it over, checking all the options. His jaw slowly dropped as he realized everything he could do with the device.<br />
<br />
“I could turn someone into a car!” Finn gasped. “Dude!”<br />
<br />
“Please don’t, that’s murder.” Jeff pointed out, shifting uncomfortably in his seat. “Hey, don’t do anything, but I really gotta piss.”<br />
<br />
Finn nodded, reading. “Does it have an instruction manual?”<br />
<br />
“Uh..” Jeff pointed at a folder. “It’s got one of those Read-Me thingies.”<br />
<br />
Finn looked up at Jeff. “Alright, go piss. I’ll be responsible.”<br />
<br />
Jeff smiled and left the room.</p>
