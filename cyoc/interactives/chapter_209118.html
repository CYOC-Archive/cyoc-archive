<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As it turned out, there was no sign of Rick. They got to work.<br />
<br />
Back in the basement, the heavy padlock in place, Megan carefully took her scraping of Brendon’s cum and put them into the machine’s input tray.<br />
<br />
Next, they loaded Brendon and Rex into the tube. It was incredibly uncomfortable for the dinosaur, who had to pull up his stiff tail and angle himself in a stance he wasn’t supposed to be in, but they did it.<br />
<br />
Megan carefully closed the door and threw the seals to lock it down.<br />
<br />
They stared at each other through the glass of the tube.<br />
<br />
(( I’m ready. )) Rex announced.<br />
<br />
Brendon nodded to Megan. His eyes were terrified.<br />
<br />
With a deep breath, the young girl hit the power and the machine hummed to life. The fans began to spool. The tube began to heat.<br />
<br />
(( Calm. )) Rex fought every instinct. (( Let’s stay calm. ))<br />
<br />
( Is that for you or for me? ) Brendon quipped.<br />
<br />
One more nod, and Megan trembled as she pulled the master switch.<br />
<br />
The Red Mist began to flow, it hit the heater, and trailed over the input tray through the system to fill the tube. The hot sticky fluid began to cling to Brendon and Rex in droplets. The air grew heavy and sweet.<br />
<br />
They both shuddered. Deep within them Rex felt something new and strange.<br />
<br />
(( Something is happening to me. ))<br />
<br />
( I feel it. ) Brendon fought through the intense physical feelings to try and stay conscious and aware.<br />
<br />
Their body began to tremble.<br />
<br />
(( Changing. )) Rex gasped from their mind. (( Changing! ))<br />
<br />
( I feel it. ) Brendon struggled. Something was happening inside their head. It was like intense pressure.<br />
<br />
The dinosaur’s legs began to shake. Transformation began to overtake them.<br />
<br />
Megan stared with her hands on her mouth in horror as she watched the handsome deinonychus dinosaur began to warp. He began to grow. Taller. His size was increasing. His legs were stretching. His back was arching. He clenched his eyes shut and grimaced, showing his razor teeth.<br />
<br />
“Oh God,” Megan whined. “Please be okay. Please be okay.”<br />
<br />
Bigger. Bigger. Bigger. The dinosaur continued to grow and change steadily. More... human. No, humanoid. He was staying a dinosaur but becoming a man.<br />
<br />
Megan’s eyes widened as she found herself staring at a lean muscular dinosaur man, gasping and clenching his five fingered claws tightly into fists. His tail hung down his back and seemed to tense.<br />
<br />
(( Dear Lord, this hurts! )) Rex cried out. (( What’s happening to us? ))<br />
<br />
( D-Don’t know! ) Brendon tried to look but he couldn’t. It was too strong. ( Can’t open our eyes! )<br />
<br />
(( K-Keep them shut. )) Rex insisted. (( I’m scared. ))<br />
<br />
A yawning aching feeling. A sick disgusting stomach churning snap somewhere deep inside of them. Muscle began to shift. Bone began to grow<br />
<br />
(( Brendon! )) Rex cried, (( No, no! I’m going! I’m going! ))<br />
<br />
The dinosaur man cried out a horrific cry and slumped down, grabbing his head. He was completely helpless and in physical and mental pain.<br />
<br />
Megan gasped, saw his distress, and kept her shaking hand over the power.<br />
<br />
Brendon managed to open his eyes long enough to see Megan staring at the power and screamed.<br />
<br />
“N-NO!” He yelled. “DON’T STOP IT! KEEP GOING!”<br />
<br />
Megan stepped back from the power in horror, having been yelled at by a half man half dinosaur. She watched.<br />
<br />
Brendon turned, and Megan could see what was happening. A second head was emerging from his right shoulder. Scrawny, pink, deformed, without eyes.<br />
<br />
She looked away, horrified. The second head began to grow. It sprouted a jaw that separated, crying out in squawking agony. Flesh began to coat the new musce and bone. Brendon raised his hand to the new head and began to pet it gently as it now enlarged. Crackling, snapping, gurgling, Rex emerged from Brendon’s shoulder and began to settle into his proper place in the middle of the collar bones. The human winced as the dinosaur snapped into place. The pressure was immense. The pain was immense.<br />
<br />
The new head grew to proportion. The jaws lengthened. The eyes opened. The feathers grew in. Rex shot his snout up to the top of the tank and cleared his new throat.<br />
<br />
“Yes!” The dinosaur gasped. “YES!”<br />
<br />
Brendon reached up and stroked his new head. Rex had successfully emerged from within him, combined with a human and dinosaur he was now his own brain in his own skull. His intelligence and evolution had persisted.<br />
<br />
Megan stared in complete shock at the two headed raptor man and her smile widened. The two creatures moaned a little and began to touch their body.<br />
<br />
Their torso began to widen. The seperation continued. Flesh melted and bulged, muscle began to shift. With a sudden sick slurp, a second torso split off from the first. Brendon’s left arm began to grow back in from a tiny nub as did Rex’s right.<br />
<br />
“O-Oh!” Rex managed, startled.<br />
<br />
Brendon could only smile in delight. They were getting an erection from the process.<br />
<br />
Megan stared in utter fascination as two large red dino dicks began to emerge from the sheath between the dino man’s legs. The split down the torso continued, reaching the belly. It was an incredible awkward sight as the two upper bodies struggled to find a way to move around one another. The tangle of growing arms and widening torsos must be incredibly awkward.<br />
<br />
Again, the chewed up gum of pink flesh emerged as the groin split. For a moment, the two collapsed, completely separated and piled on top of one another as their entire missing sides began to reform. Little by little, the two creatures began to emerge again in the tank, pulling each other up and supporting themselves as Rex began to regain his missing limbs, misshapen tail growing out again, thigh emerging from a nub on his side.<br />
<br />
“My God...” Megan heard Rex whisper, echoing off the glass of the tank. “You’re so handsome.”<br />
<br />
“S-So are you...” Brendon whispered back, the two dino men blushing their feathers as they embraced, purposely pressing their groins into each other and riding their changes in delight.<br />
<br />
Once fully reformed, the duo turned in shock to see Megan staring at them with blushing delight.<br />
<br />
Brendon nodded first while Rex maintained his shameful expression with Megan.<br />
<br />
The human girl carefully shut off the power and let the tank empty. She turned off the machine, waited for it to stop, and then carefully popped the seals on the door.<br />
<br />
Two six and a half inch tall dinosaur men helped each other out of the tank. They both blushed in shame, covering themselves, as their big and prominent dual members throbbed against the cool of the basement.<br />
<br />
The most awkward silence followed, with the two big twin deinonychus boys breathing evenly while Megan stared at them in aroused joy.<br />
<br />
“Well, guys...” Megan finally grinned, her voice low and lusty. “I’d really like to take you both back to my house where you’ll be safe. What do you say?”<br />
<br />
Brendon lit up first, followed by Rex, whose horrified shame turned to an intrigued curiosity.<br />
<br />
“That sounds delightful,” Rex whispered gently, covering himself with his fan of feathers and bowing slightly.<br />
<br />
“All right, then.” Megan tickled Brendon’s side on the way by, and giggled. “Let’s go before Rick gets back.”</p>
