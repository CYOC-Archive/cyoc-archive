<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I went straight back home. Again I was lucky and didn’t see Mary or her friends. I spent the rest of the morning on the computer playing games.<br />
<br />
Mary came home at 1. She had multiple shopping bags. She approached me. ‘Had a hairy I see……. You still look like a girl’<br />
<br />
‘Shut up and leave me alone’ Again my voice was too high. I sounded exactly like a teenage girl.<br />
<br />
‘Only once you give me half your allowance. As you can see I’ve spent mine’ <br />
<br />
Mum gave us $30 a week each. So long as we did our chores. My wallet was full because of the money I had found, well stolen actually. I counted out $60. ‘Take this. Four weeks’ worth. Don’t ask again’ She had a big grin on her face as she took the money. She went to her own room.<br />
<br />
Forty minutes later Mary was back out in front of me seeking my attention. ‘Notice anything different about me?’<br />
<br />
‘No! Am I supposed to?’ I really didn’t want to talk to her.<br />
<br />
‘I would advise you not to be rude to me’ she said. That got my attention. I did need to get on her good side. I looked at her. ‘Do you like my new top?’<br />
<br />
She was wearing a strappy black top which accentuated her abundant cleavage. I did a double take. She seemed huge. ‘Very nice’ I uttered. I remembered to deepen my voice.<br />
<br />
‘No need to deepen your voice when It’s just me little sis’ She smiled at me ‘I’m now a size 30 with C cups. I’m sure that will get the boys attention’ She walked off and began making herself lunch in the kitchen. ‘I’m relying on you to clean up before Mum comes home’<br />
<br />
I had to make my own lunch but waited until she had retreated to her own room before pausing my game and making a toasted sandwich. I cleaned up afterwards. <br />
……..<br />
Mum was home shortly after 3. She immediately noticed my haircut. ‘And a shave as well’ she observed. ‘Do we have a girlfriend we are trying to impress?’ I felt myself blushing deeply. <br />
<br />
‘No. I’m just nervous about going to a new school’ I told her. Making sure to deepen my voice. <br />
<br />
‘Well I see Mary has done the vacuuming and cleaned up the kitchen. How about you go out and weed the front garden bed. I want it done before the weeds set seed. I bet you have been on the computer most of the day’<br />
<br />
Mary had come out of her room after hearing Mum come home. She had changed her top so that her large chest was not so obvious. She had a big smile on her face on hearing herself being praised for the chores I had done. However I couldn’t say anything. I turned off the computer and went outside. I spent the rest of the afternoon weeding the garden bed as Mum had requested.<br />
<br />
I spent the last two days of school holidays, slowly regaining confidence. On the 1st day I only left the house once taking a walk to the beach and avoiding people. When I returned home, Mum was on evening shift and Mary had me hand wash her dainties. Reluctantly I did so. <br />
<br />
On the second day it was hot. I got more daring. I walked along the beach for about a mile. Here no-one was around. I had worn a loose long sleeved shirt over board shorts. I took off the shirt leaving it with my towel and hat and went for a swim. I loved swimming. I was hopeless at other sports but had a talent for swimming. Indeed back in Chicago I had been age champion swimmer until under 15&#39;s. The last few years other boys had started to develop muscles and I was left behind. <br />
<br />
The sea was calm and I swam out 100 yards. It felt good but unfortunately my rolled up sock got in the way. I tried to adjust it but that didn&#39;t work. Being in the water I decided no one could see me so removed them and I thought put them in my pocket. It was only when I was back near the shore in waist deep water that I realized the sock was gone. I was conscious of the lack of a bump in my shorts. The wet bathers hugged my body closer than I would have liked. I waited until the beach was clear before getting out. I quickly dried and put my shirt on.<br />
<br />
I had to get home without a sock. My lack of a bulge seemed so obvious. I ended up wrapping the towel around my waist before walking back along the sand.<br />
<br />
I heard a wolf whistle. I turned around intending to check out the chick who was being whistled. It was a shock to realize I was the target of the whistler. A teenage male jogger who quickly ran past. I quickly removed the towel from my waist, It must have looked like a skirt from behind. I walked the rest of the way home dangling the towel in front of my groin.<br />
<br />
Mary was busy at cheerleader practice. She did that 3 afternoons per week for several hours each time. Maybe because of the cheerleading she had quickly made friends and was always meeting them down at the shops – while I did her chores as well as my own. <br />
<br />
Mum worked 6 days a week, sometimes on morning shift and sometimes on afternoon/evening shift. She did her best to look after me and Mary. She had been a single Mum since Dad had been killed in a car accident when we were 3. She had been horrifically burnt herself in that accident. Luckily I and Mary were in childcare that day. Mum had scars all over her torso and arms where her skin had been grafted. Her face was untouched and at 41 she was still very pretty – so long as her body and arms were covered. Probably because of the scarring she had never started dating since that accident. I was certainly ignorant if she had any sort of love life.<br />
<br />
We had moved to Miami and the new high school because of Mary and her cheerleading. She was said to be very talented. It was really Mum who loved cheerleading. She had been a top cheerleader herself and said she would have won a scholarship to college but for breaking her leg as a high school senior. She pushed Mary very hard. She wanted Mary to win that scholarship and had hence moved to Miami and the top cheerleading high school in the state. Mum also said she was tired of cold winters.</p>
