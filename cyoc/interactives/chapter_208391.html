<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Without any pause and without any fanfare, Josh&#39;s first random task appeared: &quot; I need someone to clean my pool&quot;. Josh groaned; it wasn&#39;t the first time he had seen a pool cleaning request but one he always chose to ignore because he felt he didn&#39;t have any of the right equipment. And while this new Premium version had offered access to &quot;skills and know-how&quot;, there only thing on the app was an address. Josh couldn&#39;t even see an option to cancel. <br />
<br />
Josh wavered, but as he saw the blue sky outside and remembered the promise of a doubled fee, he decided to go for it. He could rake some leaves out of a pool easily enough. The address was only a 15 minute drive away, so Josh grabbed the keys to his mum&#39;s sedan and got going. <br />
<br />
It felt good to be outside and Josh enjoyed the sunny drive. So much so that he didn&#39;t notice his mum&#39;s humble car begin to change. The front section became blockier and more basic, her touchscreen sat nav becoming an older model. The seats and interior decor became faded, and Josh had to readjust his seating position as the car seemed to somehow lift off the ground. The steering wheel grow in size and, to match it, so did Josh&#39;s hands. Without warning, Josh&#39;s pale hands began to darken in complexion and as they grasped the now-rough wheel, Josh didn&#39;t notice the veins that ran down with now lean and well-rounded hands.<br />
<br />
Josh pulled up to a red light, momentarily confused about how he seemed to sit above the surrounding cars. He also felt cramped in the car and realised that his seat was pushed up way too far. He ran to around the same height as his mum so never normally had to adjust the seat, but as he pushed the seat back he realised just how much he needed to stretch out his legs. As the light turned to green, he was oblivious to his jeans riding up and becoming a loose pair of swimming shorts, revealing his now lengthy and toned legs, feathered with dark hair.<br />
<br />
Josh pulled up at the designated address shortly after, a sizeable house in a nice neighbourhood. As he got of the car, he was for a moment confused by his need to climb out of the car and then felt off balance when he landed on the tarmac. Before he could interrogate any further though, he looked in surprise at the pick-up truck boot filled with pool cleaning gear. A voice in the back of Josh&#39;s mind told him to panic, but remembering that he had a job to do Josh collected the gear and approached the house. Josh stopped en route to take his jumper off to enjoy the warm sun, not noticing his new well-fitted tanktop which hung closely to his chest and showed off his muscled arms. <br />
<br />
Josh carried the gear with surprising ease to the front door, and was warmly welcomed by a middle-aged women who introduced herself as Beth. Beth showed Josh to her garden where a medium-sized pool sat, clearly long overdue a clean. Josh thanked Beth, pausing a little at the vague lilt coming out of his month. <br />
<br />
Josh got to work. The pool needed much more than just some leaves removed but with every task, Josh found himself instinctively knowing what to do. Which pump to use, when to apply chemicals, how to get the pH levels perfect, it all just flooded into Josh&#39;s mind. And he was surprised at how flexible he was at reaching all the right places. It was hot work though and Josh removed his baseball hat and towelled his brow and face, feeling unfamiliar stubble on his face and thick short locks of hair on his scalp. <br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t long before Josh has completed his job, a sense of pride sweeping over him as he stared into the now pristine waters. That pride however quickly morphed into confusion as he gazed at the reflection in the shimmering water. Maybe it was distorted, but there was no way that that tall, dark reflection could be him. He dropped his net and stared at his thick, dark hands. Josh began to breath sharply as he noticed just how high up he was, that he was in an outfit that he had never bought, and that his short, pale self had seemingly been replaced with a tanned, lean body. As Josh was clutching at his newly stubbled face and grasping at the space where his belly should be, Beth came out with a pitcher of cool lemonade. Josh spun around in panic, and before Beth could say anything he muttered &quot;lo siento&quot; and ran off. <br />
<br />
Josh stopped sharply outside as he stared at the beaten up pick up truck outside Beth&#39;s drive, not even surprised anymore as his keys unlocked it for him. He clampered into the car and pulled down the mirror, staring at the unfamiliar dark eyes that stared back at him. Dark eyes amongst a handsome face, with a strong chin covered in thick but trimmed stubble and framed by dark, tightly curled locks. &quot;What the fuck&quot; Josh uttered, eyes widening at the accented deep voice that emerged. <br />
<br />
Josh explored his tightly muscled body now covered in a light sweat when his phone pinged. He unlocked it - the phone recognised his face even if Josh didn&#39;t - and the TaskRaccoon app popped up, showing a task completed and $500 dollars deposited in his account. What kept Josh&#39;s eye though were the other task options appearing. There were more pool cleaning jobs, but also other tasks ranging from moving furniture, plumbing, and even covering people&#39;s work shifts. Josh noted that there was an option to cancel his &quot;Premium&quot; membership, but some of the fees weren&#39;t to be sniffed at. Josh lay into his car seat, and pondered his options.</p>
