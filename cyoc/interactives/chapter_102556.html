<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">BACKTRACKING...<br />
After Kenya Adaeze showed her boyfriend Ben Twist around the Moon Lake College campus from the perspective of her own current course schedule, she suggested that unless there was something else he wanted to see at the college, they should go back to her aunt and uncle&#39;s house.<br />
&quot;They are hoping you can stay for dinner tonight, and that they are able to establish a Skype connection with my parents in New York so the three of you can &#39;meet&#39;,&quot; admitted Kenya, holding Ben&#39;s arm in hers as they walked back to his car together.<br />
&quot;Sure honey,&quot; agreed Ben, as he opened the passenger door for her. &quot;Just let me text my moms and we&#39;ll be on our way.&quot;<br />
Sitting behind the wheel with his seat belt on, Ben texted: SPENDING EVENING WITH KENYA, BUT WOULD LOVE 2 TALK WITH BOTH OF U CONCERNING MY COLLEGIATE FUTURE SOMETIME TOMORROW.<br />
After making sure the text was sent to both Samantha and Frances, he put the cellphone on its over sized lanyard back under his shirt, started the car, and drove to Kenya&#39;s house.<br />
He parked at the curb so as not to block the Adaeze driveway, and got Kenya&#39;s moped out of his trunk as she unlocked the front door.<br />
With the brochures he collected from the college in the trunk, he left the moped on the short stretch of sidewalk between the front porch and the driveway as requested, grabbed Kenya&#39;s belongings from it, and followed her inside the one story house.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now then,&quot; said Kenya, taking Ben&#39;s free hand in hers. &quot;Let us complete the tour of my life. This is the living room,&quot; she said, pointing at where they were standing. The layout was pretty basic, and similar to his. &quot;You can see the dining room and the entrance to the kitchen,&quot; added Kenya, pointing to the space at the rear of the living room.<br />
&quot;Through here,&quot; she said, dragging Ben along by the hand to a short hallway, &quot;is my aunt and uncle&#39;s bedroom, the study, the hall facilities, and...&quot; said Kenya, leading him through the door on the far right, &quot;my room.&quot; With that, she closed the door behind them and smiled while taking her books from him.<br />
The room wasn&#39;t much bigger or different than his. Computer desk, dresser, etc. The only differences were the more feminine color scheme and the fact she had a queen size bed while he only had a full. The bedroom window curtains were closed too, but he didn&#39;t think much of that.<br />
&quot;Do not be nervous, my beautiful Benjamin,&quot; said Kenya, while gently kissing him. &quot;It is not even two now, and they shall not return till after six,&quot; she added, reaching under his shirt to remove his cellphone.<br />
&quot;W-what are you doing?&quot; Ben asked nervously, as she laid the cellphone on her dresser top.<br />
&quot;Is it not obvious?&quot; Kenya asked him with a smile, while removing his shirt. &quot;As a young werewolf, you know about sex and the were libido. But now comes what might be perhaps the most important lesson in your life&#39;s education. How to make <i>love</i> with a woman,&quot; she said, while rubbing a hand across his hairy chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;The most major difference between sex and love,&quot; she said, while reaching down to undo his belt buckle, &quot;is the intimacy. Expressing love in its most passionate, physical form is a matter of making sure that your partner thoroughly enjoys every second of your time together at least as much, if not more so, than you,&quot; explained Kenya, while bending down to remove Ben&#39;s shoes and socks, before having him step out of his pants.<br />
Laying everything either on or by her desk chair, Kenya said, &quot;When two people love each other as much as I love you and you love me, our more private moments should be akin to a beautiful symphony and not some commercial jingle,&quot; she added, leading her boyfriend to the edge of her bed.<br />
&quot;If you don&#39;t mind me asking, how do you know all of this,&quot; wondered Ben, as he expressed his nervous tic of scratching the back of his head with his right hand. Except for his underwear, Ben was completely naked while Kenya was fully dressed, although she was kicking off her shoes as she turned around.<br />
&quot;Can you please unzip me darling?&quot; asked Kenya, showing the back of the zipper on her dress to him.<br />
Ben reached out and was just about to pull the metal tab down, when he seriously thought about what his girlfriend just said. Hoping it was the right thing to do, as he started to unzip the dress open, Ben began kissing a trail down Kenya&#39;s lovely mocha flesh as the zipper created gap opened wider.<br />
When he came to the back of her bra, Ben paused long enough to undo the snaps, but left the lingerie in place before following the zipper down to its end above her waist.<br />
Feeling a bit daring, he wrapped his arms around Kenya as he laid his head upon her shoulder and started nuzzling her ear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooohhh,&quot; moaned Kenya, leaning against his body. &quot;It was a bit too soon to undo my bra, but otherwise you learn fast and will excel quickly at this,&quot; she said in praise, before turning around and kissing him again.<br />
&quot;As to how I know this, alas you are not my first boyfriend,&quot; she confessed, while shrugging. Then Kenya lowered her arms, letting the dress fall to the floor. &quot;I hope it does not disappoint you that there was a man back in my senior year of high school while I was still living with my parents in New York City. In some respects, he was a wonderful lover, and showed me many things.&quot;<br />
<i>Okay, no pressure,</i> quipped Ben, as he felt his erection start to wilt a bit.<br />
&quot;Unfortunately, for a fellow werepanther, he turned out to be a giant jackass. His lessons were promising, but in the end, he could not honor his own words,&quot; explained Kenya, putting her arms around Ben to hug him.<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; was all he could say, as the closeness of her made his penis start to grow again.<br />
Seeing the look of mixed expressions on his face, Kenya said, &quot;Do not worry my Benjamin. If I could not trust, let alone love you, we would not have spent as much time together as we already have. I knew you were special from the moment I first saw you. Over the past few weeks, we have drawn closer in regards to the most important subjects of all: our selves and our souls. I have seen into your heart, and it is very good. Otherwise, you would not be here now,&quot; she said, pointing to her heart before removing her bra.<br />
&quot;Today, between seeing your own artwork and the expression upon your face on discovering the shared interest with your biological mother, I have seen your soul. There is no way you could create such beautiful drawings without having a beautiful soul that needs to express itself,&quot; said Kenya, while rubbing a hand across Ben&#39;s hairy chest again.<br />
<br />
Ben watched as that hand went downward and removed his underwear. His now quite erect penis was twitching in anticipation of where it wanted to be.<br />
&quot;Sex, in and of itself, can be a beautiful thing at times too if done properly,&quot; said Kenya, kissing Ben again before laying him down on her bed. &quot;But love is the greatest, ultimate expression between two people,&quot; she added, smiling, as she removed her own panties.<br />
&quot;Do not worry. I am on the were birth control pill for my species,&quot; explained Kenya as she straddled him. Ben felt her rubbing her wet slit against his cock head, moistening it with her dew with every movement, but not yet letting it enter its final destination.<br />
&quot;All I ask for our very first time together is to enjoy the experience. Cherish and learn from this moment, and please do not release your werewolf right now. There will be plenty of time for our fursonas to enjoy themselves too in the months and years to come.&quot;<br />
Ben smiled and nodded in agreement. With that, Kenya shifted position and allowed the tip of his penis to penetrate and enter her.<br />
<br />
It was a wonderful feeling as Kenya sank her full weight down to the bottom of his shaft. Filling herself with her lover even as her moist tunnel gripped his cock in a velvet embrace that promised never to let go. There was no resistance, but then again, Ben figured that Kenya probably wasn&#39;t a virgin long before this moment. <br />
But all too soon that promised bond seem broken as Kenya slowly rose up, only to allow herself to drift back down to take all of Ben within her again.<br />
In and out, up and down. Ben savored every moment as Kenya reached out to caress his arms and play with his chest hair.<br />
Ben returned the favor, caressing her arms while teasing and tenderly touching Kenya&#39;s breasts and nipples, even as she continued her slow but very sensational ride.<br />
Kenya never once altered her rhythm. Always the same pace. Always the same movement. In and out, up and down.<br />
A couple of times Ben wondered if Kenya might of had an orgasm, for he saw her tremble and smile. But she never moaned or stopped, always continuing with her erotic ride up and down on his penis<br />
Soon, much to his surprise and delight, Ben felt his orgasm build. His cock twitched deep within his lover&#39;s vagina even as she continued her leisurely trip up and down his penis, sinking it in and out of her now even wetter depths.<br />
&quot;Kenya, I–&quot; Ben started to say, only to have his lover gently place a finger against his mouth.<br />
&quot;Sshh,&quot; said Kenya tenderly. &quot;Enjoy,&quot; she added with a smile, as she continued exactly what she was doing exactly how she was doing it. The slight sheen of sweat upon her brown skin the only indication of how long she had been enjoying herself.<br />
<br />
Ben wanted this moment to last at least as long as possible, if not forever. He had never felt anything like this before, despite all his past experiences with other female weres.<br />
Kenya continued her agonizingly monotonous, but VERY pleasurable routine until Ben felt his cock release its much sought after prize, filling Kenya&#39;s love tunnel and beyond with what was perhaps the largest load of semen he had ever released in his life.<br />
His wonderful girlfriend and beautiful lover rode him for a few more strokes beyond the shudder of his last &quot;after shock&quot;, then she leaned forward to kiss him. The hard, dark colored nipples of her mocha breasts glided through his chest hair, setting each individual strand on a nervous edge as if they were on fire, even as his cock stayed hard within her as it bent forward with her body movement.<br />
&quot;Do you understand what I was saying?&quot; she asked with a smile, running one hand through his mop of black hair before kissing Ben again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes my love,&quot; said Ben, eagerly returning the kiss.<br />
&quot;Good. Now then, it is your turn to pleasure me,&quot; she purred.<br />
As she turned them around on her bed until he was on top, Ben smiled as Kenya&#39;s eyes started to take on a feline appearance while her black fur began spreading across her body.<br />
His cock soon became his lupine red rocket, going further into the werepanthress&#39; moist depths until the top knot was well within her.<br />
But never once did Ben speed up his pace or ram his cock harder into his lover than what was absolutely necessary for her enjoyment.<br />
In and out, up and down. Slow and steady would win this race.<br />
The werewolf howled in pleasure as the werepanthress beneath him shuddered in the throes of her first lupine created orgasm.<br />
Ben&#39;s cock never lost penetration or hardness even as he gently rode Kenya to a second and even a third orgasm before he was unable to prevent his own explosion of pleasure from happening.<br />
<br />
Spent, the two lovers laid within each other&#39;s furry arms as they cuddled and kissed.<br />
&quot;Now my darling werewolf, do you see the difference between sex and love?&quot; asked Kenya, even as the werepanthress nuzzled her werewolf&#39;s neck.<br />
&quot;Yes, and thank you,&quot; said Ben, before licking her muzzle.<br />
The two lovers stayed in Kenya&#39;s bed, experiencing more intimacy together, until they had to stop and take a shower. Together.<br />
By 6:15, Kenya&#39;s uncle came home, with his wife close behind, to find Kenya and Ben sitting on the living room sofa. Both were in their human forms and fully dressed, but they were cuddling and talking about the future together, with the dining room table set for four.</p>
