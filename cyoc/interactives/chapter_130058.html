<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jacob and Johnathan were terrified for their lives, but were still prepared for the situation. Being Eagle scouts, they had prepared themselves mentally and physically for such dangerous situations, so they had already developed a plan. As long as they simply kept moving underneath the seats, they&#39;d be able to evade Luke, who they figured was probably trying to find them right now, and hide from the rest of students and staff in the auditorium, who were all pretty much twinks by now. All they had to do was keep their eyes up and bodies low they might be able to find a way out, they figured.<br />
<br />
Of course, keeping their eyes up was what got them fucked (literally). Luke was watching the boys crawl around with amusement as a naughty plan formed in his head. He saw the direction they were heading and predicted where they were going to be. Since being under the seats didn&#39;t give them the best view of their direction, they couldn&#39;t see Luke spilling his fruity boypussy juice all over the floor where they were going and they certainly couldn&#39;t see him jacking himself off merely a few chairs away.<br />
<br />
It was almost too perfect timing. As the boys crawled right into former mathletes infected liquids they looked up right as he came, spilling jizz all over their faces. Disgusted, the Jacob looked ready to wretch as Johnathan&#39;s anger started boiling over.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fucking hell? Who the fuck do you think you are coming in here with that faggy shit and doing shit like this? Have you no respect for anything holy? Ugh...&quot; Jonathan roared until his head hurt and his anger withered. Both boys had been hit with two direct doses of the virus. What&#39;s worse, they had been exposed to an infected twink&#39;s cum, which would make things infinitely worse and infinitely sluttier for the two of them.<br />
<br />
Nonetheless, they would try their hardest to fight it. They had been like brothers since birth-- their parents had been the closest of friends since they had gone to highschool many years ago-- and the boys always had each other&#39;s backs. As proof of their bond to both each other and God, they even joined the chastity club together so they could keep each other strong. They recognized that with their looks and bodies they could have anyone they wanted, but it was important to keep from temptation, no matter the cost. They had dreams to fulfill. Being the some of the smartest in their class, they were pretty much set up for college. They were going to become powerful businessmen and give back to the communities that made them who they were. They often fantasized about becoming rich enough to fund the church and the conservative party singlehandedly. If they could do that, they believed they could wipe out the liberal party who had turned this country into the hellhole it was. They knew this virus was Satan&#39;s doing and God&#39;s test of their strength, so they wouldn&#39;t fail.<br />
<br />
But alas, more direct work was at play. The chronivac&#39;s commands wouldn&#39;t yield simply because they were strong. Even though they were more resilient because of their religion, family and friends, it didn&#39;t mean it wouldn&#39;t win. If it was their religion, family and friends that kept them strong, then it would break those down first.<br />
<br />
Memories starting forming in their minds. Jacob and Johnathan were raised with a constant belief in God, family and conservatism. Being only children, their families raised them together like siblings. That&#39;s why it was such a shock for Jacob when he caught his father, the strong, stern and always serious man, moaning like a bitch as Johnathan&#39;s father, an equally mild-mannered man, thrusted in and out of Jacob&#39;s father and his close friend during their &quot;restroom break&quot; at Thanksgiving dinner. He always remembered his father as a good man who always preached faith and adherence to God&#39;s will, so Jacob was disgusted by his hypocrisy.<br />
<br />
He immediately informed Johnathan, who was equally disgusted by the news. Their mothers, however, looked at them like they were crazy. Of course the men were fucking, they explained, it was a Thanksgiving tradition. With that, they stripped off their clothes and began their own fuck session, encouraging the boys, for whom this was their first Thanksgiving as adults, to relax and have fun as this was the first year they were allowed to join in. Of course, they didn&#39;t do so. Why would they? Sure their parents promoted an active sex life, but they weren&#39;t like them, right? They restrained themselves, even if their parents wanted a life of sin. The near daily foursomes that tended to steer towards the gay side removed the firm, straight family that the boys relied on to resist the virus&#39; effects as it creeped in further.<br />
<br />
Sure, they restrained themselves from sex quite well. It was God&#39;s will, after all. That&#39;s why they restricted themselves to masturbation. Together the boys had amassed a massive collection of porn to wank off to. It wasn&#39;t their fault-- their constantly horny parents had granted them incredibly heightened libidos. They had to succumb to temptation quite often, especially when the parents insisted on them going to church every other day after they hit puberty at a surprisingly late 17. They knew their children had inherited their sex drives, so church was the perfect way to make them go crazy with need. Jacob and Johnathan remembered the day they&#39;d lost their virginities together. Two girls, best of friends and kinky as fuck, had seduced them as they went to the bathroom to get out of the boring sermon. The result had led a much more enlightening experience. Having just turned 18 a few days prior, the boys hadn&#39;t had much experience with sex. The loss of their virginities awakened something new inside them. Going to the church was suddenly much more enjoyable now, mainly because when those girls weren&#39;t around, it left Jacob and Johnathan plenty of time to experiment with each other. Their faith in God dwindled more and more as the number of orgasms they gave each other grew in number. If they could make each other feel so good, why would they need God? It was after their four-way with Luke and Kris after the chastity club meeting (which their parents forced them to attend ironically) that they had completely given up on religion. Sure, for a while, they thought what they were doing was wrong, but that just turned them on now, and soon, the pleasure they experienced from each other&#39;s bodies was enough to convince them that this couldn&#39;t be wrong. As Jacob and Johnathan slowly awoke in their bisexual mentalities, religion was no longer helping them resist the virus as it made them act more and more twinky.<br />
<br />
But what about their political beliefs? Weren&#39;t they staunchly conservative? Didn&#39;t their fathers once proudly say that they&#39;d never vote for a candidate who accepted homosexuality? No, wait, it was the opposite. Their fathers had said they wouldn&#39;t accept a candidate who wasn&#39;t firmly gay themselves. After all, they had to have someone in office they could relate to. Reality warped with the magic virus as Jacob and Johnathan&#39;s parents became gay for each other. Their families entangled in more ways than one as their features grew to be almost exactly alike. After all, they were twins. They weren&#39;t sure exactly who their parents were, since they were conceived at some point during a very drunk four-way between the two gay couples, but that didn&#39;t matter. All four of their parents loved them equally. <br />
<br />
In fact, it was great. It especially made birthdays and holidays much more fun as they got double the number of presents. The boys remembered their 18th birthday fondly, as they could barely wait for the adult presents their parents could now get them. Jacob couldn&#39;t stop smiling at the double ended dildo collection their fathers had gotten them. They started using it immediately. John, who now never went by his full name (it was easier to moan it this way), had practically jumped on Jacob, forcing the saliva lubed dildo up his ass as he then jumped on his end, their mothers cheering them on. The day ended with the two of them filming themselves moaning loudly and slightly effeminately while going at it doggy style with a vibrator in the John&#39;s ass he pounded Jacob senselessly, twisting his nipples until they came all over each other. Their fathers remembered fondly the day they came out as completely gay. They were so happy their were following in their footsteps. Soon they&#39;d be going to gay pride rallies as a family and protesting conservative meetings across the state. A gay candidate was running for governor this year and they had to make him win. But weren&#39;t they planning on going to college to become rich and donate to the other party? No, why would they waste their money on that? They were going to college to become rich and hire as many hookers as possible, so their needs could always be satisfied. With their political beliefs altered for good, the boys welcomed the twink infection now, no longer wanting to resist.<br />
<br />
As they started licking the cum off each other&#39;s faces, grateful to Luke for supplying an fresh helping, memories of them topping anyone disappeared as they much preferred bottoming. Pleasure was almost completed derived from their asses now as their mannerisms became more flamboyant. Gone were the days training as boy scouts in their town. Most of the other scouts in their troop had just become twinks anyways as eagle scout troop meetings were now fuck sessions with their troop leader. They loved filming those sessions as that meant more hot videos for their porn site. The site was a family business owned by their parents, and once they turned 18, the twins wanted to contribute as much as they could to it. After all, that&#39;s the only reason why they were going to college: to find more stars for their growing business. It&#39;s not like they were going to get jobs or money. The site attracted millions of viewers everyday, so they were already pretty rich. Besides, whatever money couldn&#39;t buy their boypussys could, they thought with a slutty smirk. Sometimes they even chose not buy something as that gave them a reason to fuck a cashier or store owner and show them the time of their lives.<br />
<br />
It soon became clear that the boys&#39; resilience simply furthered the infection&#39;s effects since now Jake couldn&#39;t last very long without something up his boypussy or in his mouth. In fact, he had a vibrating butt plug in use as he moaned into his french kiss with Johnny. He loved having a twin brother as slutty as him, Jakey thought as he smiled into the kiss. Double teaming became, like, totes more fun. He loved going to the mall with his twin, finding some unsuspecting guy and showing him the time of his life. Once they showed him their boypussies with matching tattoos (a double ended dildo that was connected at their hips) no one could resist them.<br />
<br />
Finally, Johnny pulled away from the kiss. The twins looked into each other&#39;s eyes, and realized they had someone to thank for this development in their relationship. They turned towards Luke, who was smiling as he watched their clear yet subtle transformation, and tackled him to the ground. Johnny ripped off his clothes and eased himself on to Luke&#39;s cock while Jakey started licking both his twins boypussy and his friend&#39;s cock and balls. They&#39;d have plenty of time for learning and holiness later, he thought. Now, they&#39;d party.</p>
