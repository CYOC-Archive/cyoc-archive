<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mika didn´t have to wait long, hearing someone moving his way. A second after the steps stopped right behind him he felt a prick on his left arm and was out like a light.<br />
When he woke up again there was something wrong. He felt bonds on his body, keeping his arms and legs bend back. His feet hold tight above his ass, his hands fixated on his shoulders. His neck was unmovable, as was everything down from there. Opening his eyes didn´t help, as he still was in total darkness, most likely blindfolded. Something like a gag was in his mouth, but on the outside he felt something that kept it shut completely around the gag. A bit of pressure on his ears was interpreted as some kind of headset, shutting all sound out.<br />
Then there was another feeling around his body, something soft, but tightly pressed to his skin. It also pressed his cock to his right leg tightly and his balls felt crushed by whatever he was in.<br />
To Mika it felt like hours before something happened. He felt that whatever was around him was moving by an outside force, and his body did so, as well. It felt uncomfortable to be forced to move, and one time he would have screamed in pain as his left leg was bend backwards painfully, but that didn´t give away what he was trapped in.<br />
It was much more time later, while he still was moved around, that he heard someone speak to him, over the headset he was wearing. “Are you awake by now, Ted? Well, if not I´m sure it doesn´t matter much. After all, why explain anything to an inanimate object, huh?” said the unknown voice before laughing. Mika was even more confused now. Who was this? Why was he calling him Ted? And what exactly happened?<br />
It was later that he again heard the unknown voice, sounding bored. “Well, I´ve nothing to do right now, so even if you aren´t awake right no I can talk to you. You see, Ted, you wanted to be restrained and helpless. That´s what you are now. As you have felt maybe, you are bound so tight you can´t move a muscle, not even wiggling a toe or a finger. You wear a headset in there, including both the headphones you hear me through, which also block any other sound. And some kind of black glasses to make you blind. It wouldn´t do to take your eyes out, I didn´t want to harm you. As an extra, I could project something on them for you to see. You also wear a gag to block your mouth from making any sound. The only opening in there is a small straw, so you are still able to drink. Another straw-like tube is attached to your cock and ass, connecting them to a small tank to collect your excretions.”<br />
“That doesn´t explain what I´m right now” thought Mika nervous. From the sound of it he was really helplessly trapped. “I hope you are comfortable right now, because that will mostly be your new position to be in. I hope my daughter will like you, Ted.” Then there was silence again. Then there was an explosion of light in front of his eyes, and it took Mika more than five minutes to see what exactly happened. There, in front of his eyes, most likely on the glasses, was a picture. A picture of a teddy bear, being belted to a car seat. It took him a bit to realize what he was seeing wasn´t a random teddy, it was himself. But how was he that small?<br />
That was also when the voice returned. “Like your new looks, Ted? I´m sure if my daughter doesn´t like you, some other kid will. You are now a small, helpless little teddy bear. Have fun with that, as you will be so forever. The stuffing around you is glued on, another, extra sort of binding for your body.” The voice laughed again. Then both the picture and the voice vanished, leaving Mika to the darkness again.<br />
Over the next hours, at least to Mika it felt so, nothing happened. But all things end, and so was his calmly sitting around. All of the sudden he felt crushed, and knowing what he was looking like, most likely someone was hugging him. But how was that person so strong? He couldn´t breath while he was hugged. When the hug finally stopped and he tried to regain his breath, he felt a tug on his left elbow. Whoever had him right now dragged him around.<br />
After what felt like hours again, this time in constant movement, bone-cracking hugs or high pressure, there was a long time of nothing sitting around, bored out of his mind.<br />
What Mika didn´t know was that the girl he ended with had slept with him, hugging him most of the night, rolling over him, but now had to go to school, so he was left sitting on her bed. That ended up being most of his days, not that he could tell them apart.</p>
