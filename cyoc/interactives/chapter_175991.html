<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Forgetting about her mother for the meantime, Corinne refocuses her attention back onto the book. It was Sunday, so maybe she could go for a nice walk in the nearby park? Yeah, that sounded interesting actually. See how people react to the female version of herself could be fun, especially if they saw him as still being male! Yes, that would be entertaining to watch straight guys begin to get uncomfortable as they become erect while looking at and talking with her. <br />
<br />
So with that idea, Corinne wrote that while she had the physical body of a woman, the world only knew her as being a man. And while she looked unmistakably female, it just wouldn&#39;t register to them as being so. <br />
<br />
Looking at her profile, she confirmed that she was labeled as male, yet everything else but that, pointed to her being a woman. She even had occasional appointments with a gynecologist apparently, yet still was considered a man.  <br />
<br />
Looking around her room, literally nothing had changed.  She still had a closet full of women&#39;s clothing. There were still 2 fake eggs sitting on a fake semen soaked towel in her connected bathroom. She still had the same ovipositor dildo, just one that was a lot shorter now and the eggs were now only golf ball sized. A pile of dirty clothes were sitting in a laundry basket, all of which were those belonging to a woman. Fuck, she even had a fully stocked makeup vanity. Clearly she was a woman, yet the rest of the world believed she was a man, and all because of an edit in a magic book.<br />
<br />
Corinne had another idea, and tried it out. She wanted to make the book more portable, maybe like a phone app exclusively for her own useage or shrink down the book to be able to fit inside her purse. &quot;Wait a minute... my purse?&quot; wondered Corinne. &quot;I mean, I do likely own a purse now, but apparently I am not starting to think more like a woman too... Yeeaaaeahhhh, lets nip that away right now.&quot; She quickly jots down that her mind will only conform to any changes that she specifically wants it to happen with. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now then, what would be the most exciting, and possibly almost slutty thing I own that I can wear?&quot; She said to herself as she began searching through her closet. 2 hours later, Corinne walked out of her apartment, wearing a low cut v-neck crop top, a bra which only really served to push her boobs closer together, a casual mini skirt and a strappy pair of heels. It was all things that any &quot;normal&quot; man would never choose to wear outside. And thanks to her allowing some of the mental changes to apply, she became an expert at walking in heels and applying a bit of makeup. <br />
<br />
The park was only a block down the road, and it was mid afternoon still, so she likely could run into someone she knew as she frequently took walks in this park and had gotten on friendly terms with many of the usuals. As she walked, hearing the sound of her heels and the bounce of her boobs really made it clear again that this was all real and not just some crazy dream. <br />
<br />
However as she walked, she began to notice more and more people staring at her. Most with either a shocked or surprised expression. Looking down at herself, she couldn&#39;t see what was so odd about herself that it could cause such a reaction. Thankfully, one of her friends was walking the park today and she ran as best she could to meet up with him, calling his name to get his attention. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Adam!&quot; <br />
<br />
Adam, hearing his name and recognizingthe voice, turned around to greet his best friend. &quot;Hey Corinne-ohh what the fuck are you wearing dude, hahaha?&quot; He said while breaking out in laughter. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey. What&#39;s so funny?&quot; Asked Corinne, confused as to why he suddenly started laughing at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, nice clothes. What, did you lose a bet or something? Why the hell are you out here crossdressing? That said, hahaha, it actually looks really good on ya too, you know, if you were a girl that is. Ahahaha Dude, do one of those girl poses, I need a picture to send to the guys.&quot; Adam just continued to laugh at her for another minute. She realized herr mistake. Even if she were in a woman&#39;s body, being seen as a man by others, meant that she still had to wear men&#39;s clothing, or else it would be considered crossdressing. <br />
<br />
When Adam finished his laughing fit, he spoke up again. &quot;Alright. I&#39;m done laughing, haha, mostly. So, why the skirt and heels? Making a statement or something?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Honestly, it was an accident on my part&quot; Corinne admitted.<br />
<br />
&quot;How does one accidentally put on high heels and makeup?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, well... um...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I thought so. Anyways, its whatever man. And actually, you really can pull it off, and in a shockingly good amount too. Hey. I got an idea, so just hear me out. You know how oddly feminine your body is normally right? Well, now that you are dressed up like this, if I didn&#39;t now it was you, under all of this... dude you would make for a really hot girl you know. Maybe you should stay like this hahaha. Who knows, you may end up even finding a hot boyfriend to plow your ass&quot; joked Adam. <br />
<br />
&quot;MOVING ALONG&quot; Corinne urged. &quot;I&#39;m going for a walk, are you joining me, or no?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do I have to hold your hand if I do?&quot; Adam continued to joke. &quot;Sorry, sorry. That was the last one.&quot;<br />
<br />
With an annoyed yet smug grin, she quickly countered his joking by grabbing his right hand with her left and interlock their fingers. &quot;Sounds good, boyfriend&quot;. <br />
<br />
Adam stopped joking around and his face took on a somewhat panicked look. &quot;Woah dude. What the fuck?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What? Can&#39;t handle it? Are you not a hot enough man to do it? Or perhapse you are just shy, since I make for such a hot girl apparently?&quot; Corinne even added heavy sarcasm when she said &quot;hot man&quot;, just to really make him squirm. Adam&#39;s normal mentality would have just dropped the subject, but this was Corinne. His best friend. No way was he ever going to let him win one over him. So he reluctantly doubled down and tightened his grip around Corinne&#39;s hand. &quot;Fine then, girlfriend. Let&#39;s have us a little bet. You will pretend to be my girlfriend, and I will pretend to be your boyfriend. First one to back out, pays the other $500. Deal?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh hell yeah. Deal! Just don&#39;t forget to pay me my $500 dollars when you lose, babe.&quot; Corinne answered, even going as far as quickly kissing Adam lightly on his cheek. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuuuccckkkkk&quot; groaned Adam as he realized how much this bet is going to suck for him just a little bit too late. &quot;Dude, please don&#39;t fucking kiss me ok. Its bad enough I have to hold your small, girly hands as it is.&quot;<br />
<br />
Corinne smerked noticing how red Adam&#39;s face was getting. He was starting to get embarrassed, or maybe he momentarily had forgoten that you were still a guy. Either way it was exactly the reaction you were hoping for.</p>
