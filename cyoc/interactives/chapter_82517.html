<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>I was surprised to find out that I had been on the second floor. With the horrendous crash the elevator had made I had thought we had 
been on a higher floor. Of course the stairs continued down so there was a basement and maybe lower levels too. I was going to go out 
the front door but when I placed my hand on the door leading from the stairwell I got a really bad feeling. I couldn't quite explain it but I 
thought it was the same thing that was urging me on. I could have ignored it but the feeling was so strong that I decided to heed it. I had a 
choice of going back up or going down and seeing if there was an exit down there. After a moment I decided to go down. I didn't know if I'd 
be able to climb down out if the hole in the second floor and I didn't want to try it if I didn't have to.</p>
<p>I had been pleasantly surprised that there was a pile of stuff under a basement window which I could use to climb out. It had looked 
sturdy enough and a quick check seemed to confirm that. As it turns out it was just barely sturdy enough. I had just started to go through 
the window when the pile shifted and tumbled. It made quite a bit of noise so I hurried to get through the window in case anyone came 
looking. Once I was out I began walking going in a direction that felt right. As I passed some buildings I could see a few faces peering out 
at me making me a little nervous. It kind of felt like some of those old westerns where there was a gun fight at high noon and everyone 
was watching from indoors. I even heard some whispering as I passed but I couldn't make it out. I could kind of guess what they were 
though. A couple times I saw a few figures dash through alleys and once saw something that looked like an anthropomorphic bird crawling 
up the side of a building. Nothing and no one bothered me though so I kept going having no idea how long it would take me to get where I 
was going or even where I was going.</p>
<p>It took most of the day and I had become very hungry but I arrived at what looked like a private school. There were letters above the 
door but many had either fallen off or been take off so it was hard to tell what the name of it was. However there was a crooked g and k 
and what looked like an apostrophe. I figured that this must be the Gregorski's I heard about in my dream which made me pause a bit. If 
that was true then my dream wasn't quite a dream. Shaking my head a bit I decided to go in. The doors were a little hard to open and once 
I was inside they automatically shut. Turning around I tried to open them again but they wouldn't budge. It looked like I was trapped but 
remembering my dream I turned around and began looking for the girls restroom.</p>
<p>It felt spooky in here like someone I couldn't see was watching me. I thought I had heard footsteps behind me a couple times though 
when I turned around there was no one there. I thought that maybe it was just an echo of my own footsteps but when I tried to recreate it I 
couldn't. There had been no way for someone to hide when I turned around so quickly plus I would have heard the mad scramble of 
someone trying to hide that fast. Shaking my head I continue on until I hear a voice say, "Flutrina but not Flutrina. Maybe Flutrina someday 
maybe not."</p>
<p>"Who's there?" I yelled becoming a little bit frightened.</p>
<p>"Who I am is not important or maybe it is," the voice continued seemingly coming from nowhere. "Follow your instincts and you will 
find what you are looking for or maybe you won't."</p>
<p>"What's that supposed to mean?" I yelled feeling a little confused. The voice didn't answer and some of the eerie feeling went away. 
"Ok that was different," I said to myself and shake my head. I look around and see a door that looked like it had some type of plaque on it 
at one time. I could barely see the outline of it on the door. It looked like it was about the right size for a restroom sign so I shrugged and 
pushed the door open. It was a surprise that it opened easily and made no sound even though it had probably been decades since it was 
last used. Looking in I could make out a stall that was still standing and what appeared to be four other stalls that had collapsed. There 
wasn't any sign of any urinals so I guessed that this was the girls restroom. Entering I took note of how filthy the restroom was and 
shuddered at actually having to use it in this state. Since only one stall was left standing I went to that one and pushed open the door. 
What greeted me was not the toilet I was expecting to see. Instead there was a white wooden door in the back with a crystal like knob on 
it. This had to be the door that Twila had mentioned in my dream. I hesitated for a moment wondering if I should find a place to sleep for 
the night since the walk had tired me out, I also needed to find food as I was very hungry. However there seemed to be some type of hum 
in the air and it rose and fell erratically. I had the feeling that if I didn't go through the door now I wouldn't be able to go through it at all. 
Taking a deep breath I grabbed the handle and turned it. It turned easily enough and I felt the resistance of the latch but when I pushed on 
the door it didn't budge. I hadn't noticed any lock on the door but I looked for one anyway. When I couldn't find a lock I again tried the door 
pushing and pulling it but it didn't seem to want to come open. I had noticed something though. When I had been pushing on the door the 
hum rose. I reasoned that either the door was breaking down or something was keeping it closed. I steeled myself for a third try and 
figured this would be it. If I couldn't get it open this time I would forget about it for tonight. I put my weight into it this time and felt it give a 
bit as the hum rose ever higher. I needed to get away from that hum or it was going to drive me mad and with that thought I dug down 
deeper and shoved. There was an audible pop and the door flew open dumping me on the other side.</p>
<p>I heard a loud slam behind me and looking back I saw a blank wall, no sign that a door had been there recently. There were no lights 
on in the room but there was light coming from outside so I could see some of the room. It was a bedroom though I couldn't tell if it was for 
a girl or boy. Looking at the bed there didn't seem to be anyone in it so I was ok for the moment. I wouldn't be able to explain why I was in 
a stranger's house to anyone. They would put me in a mental hospital if I told them the truth so it would be best for me to leave as soon as 
possible. As I got up to leave the house the door to the room opened and someone flicked on the light temporarily blinding me. "I thought I 
heard another thief," a voice said.</p>
<p>My eyes cleared and I saw that the voice belonged to a man in his thirties I believed. This man was pointing a revolver at me and his 
finger was going from the trigger to the hammer which I thought was a bit odd. I didn't think he knew how to use a gun and embolden by 
this I said, "I'm not a thief."</p>
<p>"Liar," the man almost shouted. "You're the third one that I have found in my home. Now I'm going to give you a choice. I know a bit of 
magic so you can either wear this," he paused and pulled out a locket, "and become my daughter or I can shoot you and bury you out 
back like I did the last two thieves." He finally cocked back the hammer with his finger as he finished.</p>
<p>I knew that the locket would transform me but I didn't know if it would include a mental transformation as well. I looked at the man 
trying to see if he would actually carry out his threat despite his statement that he's already shot a couple people. I decided to risk it and 
said, "Go ahead and shoot me then because I'm not putting that locket on."</p>
<p>"Suit yourself," the man said with a sneer and pulled the trigger.</p>
<p>I had half expected to hear the gun fire and I flinched. Instead all I heard was the hammer hit and the gun drop. The man took the 
opportunity of me flinching to close the gap between us and had circled around to my back. Before I could react he had the locket around 
my neck and was fastening it. I began to sputter something and then the burning pain hit. I fell to my hands and knees then onto my side 
as the pain engulfed my entire body. I was dimly aware of the guy removing my clothes and remarking on my genitals. I could feel my 
body getting smaller through the pain but that was the extent of what I was feeling through the pain. Finally the pain subsided and I was 
able to move again. That was temporary however as my mind started to change as well. Who I had been was fading from my mind like the 
fragments of a dream. During this time the man who I was beginning to think of as my daddy put panties and a nightgown on me. My last 
thought before my mind finished changing was that this hadn't really been my day.</p></p>
