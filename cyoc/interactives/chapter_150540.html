<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Hello?” Gavin called out as he entered through the front door. He was meant to get a ride from his uncle Andrew to school since his parents were away this week. However Andrew never came over to pick him up, so he decided to check if he was still at his place. <br />
“Andrew are you here? Remember I need a ride this morning.”<br />
He heard some commotion coming from the bedroom and winced. <br />
*Oh god, is Andrew and Dan having sex right now? This is so awkward!* He thought, wondering if he should leave or wait for them.<br />
Before he could decide, he heard his uncle call out to him.<br />
“Shoot, Gavin? Sorry man I totally forgot. I’ll be right out.”<br />
Shortly after, Andrew emerged from his bedroom pulling on a t-shirt. Gavin noticed his uncle’s tummy was a bit more round than last time he saw him and slightly too big for the shirt that was quickly pulled over it. <br />
“Hey bud, how’s it going?” Andrew awkwardly greeted his nephew. “Sorry about the delay, give me five minutes to grab some stuff and I’ll drive you to school. At least you’ll still be on time aye?”<br />
He patted Gavin on the shoulder and raced into the bathroom.<br />
“Where’s Dan?” Gavin asked. He liked his uncle’s boyfriend, Dan was pretty cool and fun to be around. They often played video games together whenever Gavin was over. Plus him and Uncle Andrew were great role models for the young teen. Being a still closeted gay 14 year old, Gavin loved to see that his gay uncle was in a happy relationship with such a cool guy.<br />
“I’m in the bedroom bud, just not feeling too well so won’t greet you in person sorry.” Dan called out from the other room. <br />
“Umm ok, I’ll wait out here then.” Gavin replied. <br />
He was a bit disappointed, Dan was great at answering any questions, non-judgmentally, and Gavin definitely had a few involving the sleepover he had set up with his mates tonight. <br />
<br />
With nothing to do, Gavin looked around the kitchen as he waited for Andrew and spotted a pill container. He had no idea what sort of prescription drug was inside, but he knew he needed to grab it. The sleepover was parent free so the group decided they each should bring over something that could get them all drunk or high. He just needed to borrow some for tonight and would be sure to bring the rest back before they were missed.<br />
Almost by instinct, Gavin quickly grabbed the container and hid it in his pocket. Unaware that he had just condemned Dan to being in breach of his contract with the drug trial company. Possibly causing his current state to be a permanent one.<br />
Just at that moment Andrew returned, all ready to take his Nephew to school.<br />
“Right, shall we head off then?” Andrew asks as he grabs his car keys for the fruit bowl, the only place he doesn’t lose them.<br />
“Ah yip.” Gavin says, relieved he wasn’t caught in the act.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Later, after school Gavin and 5 of his best mates came back to his place. With his parents away, they were free to do whatever they wanted. Gavin knew this was a great excuse to hang out with his crush, Myles, maybe even hook up with him if he is lucky. That was the reason he grabbed Dan’s pills, mix them with whatever the others bring and all get high enough to lose any inhibitions they all have. <br />
<br />
Myles was the cutest guy in the school, most of the girls try to date him, but he clearly isn’t interested in them. But Myles is definitely not shy about his looks either. He has an Instagram page full of selfies and shirtless pics, a page Gavin has masturbated to almost daily. On it were many pics of his super cute smile, but Gavin’s favorites were the ones focused around his mate’s V-line groin muscles that Gavin found irresistible.<br />
<br />
Neal and Jeffery were identical twins, so much so that even their best friends couldn’t tell them apart if they wore the same clothes and didn’t talk. There were rumours that they often experimented with each other, hand jobs and blow jobs, maybe even fucked. Gavin was definitely skeptical that they’ve gone that far, but the two weren’t shy about joking about twincest. They have even said to those that asked: “Of course we don’t care if we see each other naked, it’s just like looking in a mirror.”<br />
<br />
Gavin’s best friend Samuel was the oldest of the group, being 15, and also the chubbiest. He use to be the fittest of the group, but stopped playing sports a few months back and suddenly gained a lot of weight. Poor guy went from having nice pecs and abs to moobs and a belly.<br />
<br />
Phil was the skinniest of the group, but had the biggest dick by far. Gavin could often see the outline of the monster through Phil’s baggy shorts. Gavin estimated it was about 11 inches semi-hard, which Gavin assumed was impossibly large. He even hopes they’ll all be drunk enough to get Phil to show them. As he really wanted to see it in person and find out how big it could actually get. In preparation for the sleepover, Gavin made sure there was a ruler nearby, just in case.<br />
<br />
The night was going pretty well, they hung out in Gavin’s large living room playing video games and eating pizza most of the evening. Neal and Jeffery, had managed to get their older brother to score them some beer, so the group was slightly drunk. The two currently cuddled up together on the couch chatting away to Samuel about who should be dating Sarah. Phil was trying to make a cocktail the way he’s seen in the movies. While Gavin and a shirtless Myles sat close together playing Mario Kart. He had claimed he took it off because it was too hot inside, but Gavin suspected it was more to distract him from the game as that strategy was definitely working. <br />
By 10, Myles suggested that it was time for the group to get high. Quite keen to experiment, Samuel brought over the three pill containers the group managed to acquire, including Dan’s pills, Samuel’s anti-depressant tablets and Phil’s mom’s estrogen supplements. None of them had gotten high before, especially with mixing prescriptions, so all were a little unsure how to start or even if they will work.</p>
