<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tyra spent a good hour examining her body wondering how she was going to improve it after what seemed like almost perfect human form was achieved. But that was it she was only human her mind when she was Ty would alway wonder to creatures of myth and legend yet now she could become anyone of them and all that went through her mind was indecision. There were so many different creatures she could become but she did have certain conditions that she wanted, one the creature couldn’t be too monstrous as to hide the beautiful form as just achieved so that luckily got rid of a good majority of them, two they couldn’t be grotesque much for the same reasons for the first she wanted to enjoy her beauty not get rid of it, thirdly they must have have some supernatural feature it was the whole point of why she was doing this and lastly they must be intelligent Tyra didn’t know how her powers fully worked so if any unforeseen circumstances happen she wanted to remain with all her facilities.<br />
<br />
Now these rules really help narrow down what kind of creature Tyra wanted to become and started going through pros and cons. Faun had many favors to them sexually enhanced, high alcohol tolerance and an iconic look but they were never taken seriously and most of their features were usually done of by other creatures to a much greater degree. Harpy and Mermaid were great at in their chosen terrain being completely free in their native element but sadly almost a detriment if not lethal state if out of that element. Succubus were highly known for their beauty and power, Tyra thought this meant have been the one having many fantastical appearances she was looking for until thought how repetitive the demoness was truly, it look just a copy paste of most other devils and decided to keep looking. Centaur and Minotaur were no bulky for her liking, Vampire only remarkable feature were its fangs and Werewolf was just too hairy. Then Tyra’s mind came upon a truly interesting idea, a Naga. The Naga was truly the perfect match for her, it meet all her conditions, was something that was exotic form she was looking and she had a few ideas on how she could even improve on that design.<br />
<br />
First Tyra stood in front of her mirror bringing her face close to the glass so she could get a good view of her eyes, she then tapped her temple a couple of time causing the warm brown color to turn into a bright magnificent amethyst color, the pupil thinning into cat-like slits causing her vision to improve exponentially. She next brought her finger to the top of her forehead drawing a vertical line down to her brow causing a third amethyst eye to open with the same vertical slit increasing her depth perception and detail apprehension. Tyra then gently gripped her tongue soon pulling out a long thin 9 inch split prehensile tongue which she found she could detect all the scents and heat signatures in the house each of his foster family members holding a unique and identifiable smell. Tyra went on to lick her teeth with her new tongue which somehow still fit in her mouth, causing her incisors to increase in length turning them into venom dripping fangs. Despite these changes Tyra still kept her beautiful face even with the third eye which if anything it just added more to her new mythic beauty. Tyra’s new eyes then landed on her hands where she witnessed her nail turn into black sharp claws adding to her lethality, a small change but a sign of a far greater one coming. As her fingers turn into dexterous knives a building pressure was staring in her armpits once her claws finished forming Tyra’s attention shifted to the pressure where she saw a pair of vestigial arms growing under the first and growing. As her new arms grew they became almost exact copies of the pair she had first and found she already control them as if she has alway had them whereupon Tyra took the opportunity to both play with her tits and finger her pussy at the same time. She groped her breasts with her upper hands kneading them as if like dough feeling the nerves react as her fingertips passed over the nipples, her left lower hand plunged multiple times into her vagina the fingers shifting every time to invoke new sensations touching the G-spot every so often to induce an orgasm and for her right lower hand she had it play with her new tongue just to give it something do as Tyra lost her mind with the pleasure. <br />
<br />
As Tyra got more well acquainted with her new appendages some of her former appendages began their transformation brilliant purple scales started sprouting on her legs. With every bemoaned breathe more scales appeared even else where besides the legs, growing on the sides of her torso, her arms and her neck. As each orgasm reached a crescendo her legs started to close tighter together until one point Tyra couldn’t spread them again, at this point they started extending and shifting as Tyra busy herself with switching hands for her fingering and cleaning the used hand with her mouth. The new tail that make Tyra a true naga was a tremendous thing twelve feet of violet scale covered muscle the color shining off all the light that made contact appearing to be made of jewels replacing the entirety of her legs which she thought she would miss but seeing this gorgeous feature it almost felt like a steal. Her tail ended at about mid hip still retaining the shape of her butt and hips to keep her figure but not hampering the functionality of her body. Tyra also kept her human vagina in the transformation keeping the same place as before but now hidden by cleverly placed scales, she was actually still pleasuring herself when the change completed.<br />
<br />
It took Tyra a few minutes to recover from metamorphosis mainly from the masturbastion that the change induced rather the actual change. When Tyra finally got off the floor she saw the most magnificent creature in the mirror, her new form was a sight to behold radiating majesty and power, her scales highlighting her dark human skin tone enhancing her beauty, serpentine facial feature adding mystery and magic to her presence and her tail a powerful appendage capable of both harm and pleasure which she found she could use instinctively as if she was walking if anything her tail gave more speed, flexibility and manipulation than her legs ever gave her. She was perfect now beyond what any human could ever reach. Tyra then decided to get some clothes on as her naked form should probably use sparingly as not to cause mass sexual mania from her presence. With her powers she summoned an aquamarine silk sash to cover her bust although the sash left little to the imagination being practically see through soon adding a moderate length skirt of the same material leaving her midriff bare, she then proceed to materialize sapphires and rubies into the braids of her hair and started decorating herself in the all finest jewelry she could think. She summoned gold and platinum rings for all her fingers, precious metal arm bands some connected by diamond encrusted chains, multiple necklaces each with unique amulets, jewels and insignias and finally a golden ringlet in the form of a coiling snake upon her head the body encrusted in onyx and the head staring out front with purple diamond eyes. Once finished clothing herself Tyra began thinking on what to do next, get revenge on his foster family, rise above them having become something far greater or live her days in pleasure away from everyone?</p>
