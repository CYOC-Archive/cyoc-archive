<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next morning the sun rose over them, bathing the grass in a warm glow.  They still huddled close, asleep.  Jeffie woke up first, yawning and glancing over to his maker.  He reached over and lightly brushed Jeff&#39;s long hair from his eyes and ran the tips of his fingers over Jeff&#39;s cheek.<br />
<br />
As the sun rose higher and the birds began to chirp, Jeffie couldn&#39;t help but feel a sense of love and gratitude towards his maker. He knew that his purpose in life was to be a companion for his brother, and he was happy to serve that role. After all, he was a clone, an exact duplicate in every way except for memory and experiences, so in other words a part of Jeff with the same desires and personality.<br />
<br />
Jeffie enjoying every moment of his first day. From the pizza to the orgasms, and now waking up with his twin by his side.  What more could an old cummy sock ask for. As the sunlight warmed his skin and the sounds of the morning surrounded him, he couldn&#39;t help but feel grateful for the existence he now had. The only two things he worried about were making his brother happy and whether or not his time in life would be short.<br />
<br />
As he gazed over at Jeff&#39;s sleeping form and couldn&#39;t help but smile. They were identical in every way, and the thought of being able to love and please his creator fluttered his heart and warmed his life. He knew that he could make Jeff&#39;s life so much better, and he intended to make that happen.<br />
<br />
Jeffie leaned over and kissed Jeff softly on the cheek, before sliding a hand into Jeff&#39;s shirt and resting it on his abs.  He snuggled his nose next to Jeff&#39;s neck and nuzzled him. Jeff slowly woke, turning to face his clone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning,&quot; Jeff said, his voice raspy from sleep.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning,&quot; Jeffie replied, letting his lips meet Jeff&#39;s with a gentle peck.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm, last night was amazing,&quot; Jeff said, pressing his forehead and nose to Jeffie&#39;s.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was,&quot; Jeffie replied, his cheeks reddening. &quot;You were amazing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was?&quot; Jeff said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Jeffie replied, his voice breathless. &quot;Less than a full day, and I&#39;m already head over heels for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff smiled and leaned in, pressing his lips against his clone&#39;s. Jeffie could feel the love and passion radiating off of the boy, and he couldn&#39;t help but be enraptured by it. They were connected in a way that no one else could ever understand.  Jeffie&#39;s heart pounded as he felt his creator&#39;s lips against his own, the sensation was unlike anything humanly imaginable. He was in love, and nothing could ever compare to the feeling of being loved in return.<br />
<br />
As their lips moved against each other, they were all that mattered. The world around them faded away, and it was just the two of them.<br />
<br />
Jeffie&#39;s mind reeled. He couldn&#39;t believe how lucky he was to have someone who loved him so much. He had no idea how his life would turn out, but he knew that it would be amazing, as long as he had Jeff by his side.  &quot;I love you,&quot; Jeffie whispered, pulling away from the kiss.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you, too,&quot; Jeff replied, his voice breathless.<br />
<br />
&quot;Forever,&quot; Jeffie added, smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Forever,&quot; Jeff echoed, smiling back.<br />
<br />
Jeffie ran his hand around Jeff&#39;s abs, feeling every muscle, every movement as his maker breathed.  He touched Jeff&#39;s belly button, circling it with his finger before lowering his hand further to Jeff&#39;s thigh.  A slight indention betrayed the erection in Jeff&#39;s pants. &quot;You&#39;re hard,&quot; Jeffie breathed, looking at Jeff&#39;s morning blue eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;So are you.&quot; Jeff replied, his eyes sparkling as his gaze met his clone.  &quot;Heh, I guess we&#39;re the same, we wake up with morning wood,&quot; he said. &quot;Want to jerk off together, or...&quot; he left the suggestion open, his hand going to his clone&#39;s pants.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Jeffie responded, a slight grin on his face. &quot;Let&#39;s.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two teens stood up and unbuttoned their pants, dropping them and their boxers to the ground, kicking their shoes off and standing naked in the dewy grass, the warm sun on their bare, muscly legs.  Hopefully no one would spot them, but the area was secluded enough it shouldn&#39;t be a problem.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come here, brother,&quot; Jeffie whispered, pulling Jeff close, their identical bodies pressing against each other. Their stiff, identical penises rubbed together, their foreskins sliding open as the shafts as their dangling identical balls bounced together. &quot;Lets share our high.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh,&quot; Jeff groaned, &quot;yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeffie kissed Jeff and his hands ran down his creator&#39;s back. His fingers trailed along his spine and came to rest on his ass. He gave the firm butt a squeeze before continuing down, reaching his thighs. His hands gripped the toned muscles as his tongue probed Jeff&#39;s mouth.<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s arms wrapped around his clone, pulling him closer, his own tongue exploring in return. His hands found Jeffie&#39;s ass and squeezed the firm flesh. <br />
<br />
Jeffie loved how they were identical. Jeff had made him from an old cum-encrusted sock. And now, they were both naked, holding each other, rubbing their erect cocks together and making out. It was the most amazing thing he&#39;d ever experienced.<br />
Jeffie guided Jeff down and they sat opposite one another in the soft grass, basking in the morning sun.  They interlocked legs until their balls, and penises pressed against one another. &quot;Ready?&quot; Jeffie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just feeling you is making me want to jizz,&quot; Jeff said.<br />
<br />
Jeffie grinned, &quot;Good.  Just lay your head back and let me take care of this for you.&quot;  Jeffie reached his hand up and began stroking their penises together. &quot;I love feeling your hardness against my cock.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh,&quot; Jeff groaned. &quot;Ugh.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shh,&quot; Jeffie whispered, moving his hand up and down, their foreskins peeling back and their hard, throbbing members pressed together in Jeffie&#39;s grip.<br />
<br />
The two sixteen year old boys sat there, their hearts beating at impending release. Their identical bodies mashed together. Their dicks rubbing and pressing against each other, their balls jiggling together and their penises oozing with precum. Jeffie&#39;s balls felt heavy and full as his dick rubbed against his maker&#39;s. His penis was hard and the foreskin slid back revealing his sensitive head. Jeffie&#39;s hand was warm and his movements smooth, his enclosed fist rubbing up and down, shifting their penises together, letting them flex and pulsate against one another.<br />
<br />
Jeffie&#39;s mind was blank, his thoughts filled with the sensation or making Jeff happy. He could feel the blood rushing through his veins and the heat emanating from his twin. The air was thick with the smell of their arousal and the sound of their moans. He was in ecstasy, his orgasm building with each stroke. He could feel his balls tighten and his cock twitch, ready to burst.<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s breathing was shallow, his own orgasm approaching. His balls tightened and his cock swelled. He was close, so close. <br />
<br />
Jeffie wanted to cum, to feel the release and to see his twin&#39;s face as he did the same. He wanted to share this experience with him, to know that he was the cause of his pleasure.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, babe,&quot; Jeff said &quot;I&#39;m gonna cum!&quot; he cried, his body tensing up and his toes curling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cum for me, brother,&quot; Jeffie moaned, his hand stroking their identical members and the pressure quickly building from within his own balls. The sensation was overwhelming, and they couldn&#39;t hold back any longer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahhh, ahh,&quot; Jeff cried, his body trembling as his cock exploded, sending gooey ropes of cum flying.<br />
<br />
Jeffie threw his head back, cum rushing out of his own cock at the same time.  His hand continued to move, milking every last drop from their identical members.  Wet, warm liquids splattered both of their chests with the oozy smell of their sweet, salty product.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, that was amazing.&quot; Jeffie moaned, collapsing onto his back, panting, his balls and deflating penis still pressed to his brother&#39;s.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Jeff breathed, laying in the grass. &quot;It was.&quot;<br />
Jeffie rolled onto his side, grinning and faced his twin.  His breathing just as heavy as Jeffs as the highs of orgasm ebbed.  &quot;Jeff?&quot; Jeffie said, his heart warm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Socky?&quot; Jeff said, rolling his head and opening his eyes, meeting the gaze of his clone.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m happy you made me.&quot; Jeffie said, his cheeks blushing. <br />
<br />
&quot;You keep saying that,&quot; Jeff said, his own chest still heaving.<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean it,&quot; Jeffie said.  &quot;Y-you said something amazing. I don&#39;t know how to tell you how warm it makes me to hear.&quot; He paused. &quot;Thank you, bro. Thank you.&quot; He kissed his brother.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-what did I say?&quot; Jeff tilted his head, searching through every word they said while Jeffie had frotted with him.  The whole instance a blur of ecstasy. <br />
<br />
Jeffie&#39;s cheeks reddened and he gently kissed his twin.  &quot;You called me &#39;babe,&#39;&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
Jeff blinked. &quot;Oh, right. I did.&quot; Jeff replied, smiling. &quot;It just...came naturally.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you really mean it?&quot; Jeffie asked, his eyes hopeful.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I do.&quot; Jeff answered, his heart pounding. &quot;I love you, Jeffie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you too, Jeff.&quot; Jeffie said, hugging his twin.<br />
<br />
The two boys embraced, their identical bodies pressed together, cuddling naked in the grass, as the sun rose near noon.<br />
<br />
Jeffie cannot explain it. He&#39;s so alive! The sounds, smells, and taste of pizza! He can see the birds, the clouds, the sun and stars! He can run, jump and stretch, and even cuddle and hug! He loves every second of it and doesn&#39;t ever want it to end. He adores Jeff and will forever be grateful for his creation, and the love that he&#39;s given him. It&#39;s more than he ever thought possible.  He looked at the position of the sun and gauged that he&#39;d been around for almost twenty-four hours. And he absorbed every minute of it. The world was a fascinating place and he was excited to explore and discover more, with his favorite person, Jeff, by his side.  Being alive was amazing!</p>
