<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">By the time Julie arrived the next day, your body count had already reached a number better expressed in scientific notation again. Thankfully Erika and Mary were also multiplying now—if not nearly as fast as you did—so their was a decent amount less selfcest going on.<br />
 <br />
Erika now had five-hundred and fourty-five bodies, with her snake half being so long that it couldn&#39;t fit itself in any one room. The hydra thus simply let it coil and twist throughout the halls, not needing to worry about its exact position as much anymore due to her upper torso having enough “neck” to work with that it was rarely a problem.<br />
<br />
Mary meanwhile, having a more efficient way to duplicate herself, now had bodies in the ten thousands. A notable thing about her bodies however is that, unlike you and Erika, her bodies were not a true hivemind. They shared sensations, but only that their minds were otherwise wholly separate. Of course they were all still based of the same person, and were completely fine being thought of as clones for the time being, but there was potential for the various Marys to diverge greatly as people in the future.<br />
<br />
Regardless, everyone in the house went to meet Julie and her mom when they arrived, though only one each of your and Mary’s bodies were present and all and only four of Erika’s bodies had clothes to wear, so the rest were tucked away in the nearby rooms, accompanied by some of your and Marys bodies.<br />
<br />
“Hello! I’m Julie’s mother, Mona.”<br />
<br />
“I’m Erika” “and this is my wife, Mary.” “It’s nice to meet you, Mona.” Erika spoke across three of the eight heads present.<br />
<br />
“Thanks again for offering to let me live here, I wanted to take a look around the house before making my final decision.<br />
<br />
“Me and Charlie can show you around then!” Susie bounced forwards and grabbed Julie by the arm, practically dragging her deeper into the house. Sarah quickly slipped off as well, leaving you, Erika, and Mary with Mona. <br />
<br />
“How some snacks while we wait.” At Mary’s suggestion you all retired to a dining room, with one of the scylla’s other bodies coming in with a tray of snacks.<br />
<br />
As you chatted with the parents, you used your other bodies to keep an eye on Julie and the others. It was immediately clear that Susie had no intention of actually showing Julie around, as she pulled the succubus off into a bedroom as soon as she found one that was empty of you or her parents. You had your body with your phone hang out outside for a few minutes before generating a sentence on Julie.<br />
<br />
“Julie has just agreed to share her girlfriend with Susie.”<br />
<br />
You were glad to see that the three women were able to come together. Regardless however, you still decided to make a change.<br />
<br />
“Julie has just agreed to share her girlfriends with Susie.”<br />
<br />
Once again relying on the power of the simply pluralizing a word, you take a peak inside to see exactly how this change affected your daughter. At first it doesn’t seem like much has changed, other than the fact that Charlie’s three head all have slightly different hairstyles now. Things begin to get a bit clearer as you listen in on what everyone is saying however.<br />
<br />
“I’m so glad you two are alright with us dating both of you, Marlie and Charlie were sweating buckets after we had sex with Susie yesterday even though I was sure you would both be fine with it.” This was said by the right head, which had a ponytail.<br />
<br />
“Hey!” objected left, twin-tailed head.<br />
<br />
“Yeah Karlie! You were just as worried as we were.” added the centre head with braided hair.<br />
<br />
“Well, I would like to remind you three that I am still am upset about you cheating on me, so don’t think you have free reign to sleep around. Not without inducing me that is.” Julie blushed a bit when she said the last bit.<br />
<br />
“Yeah well considering I’m fucking your mom I don’t really have any legs to stand on. I’m not gonna be exclusive to the four of you, so I see no reason to expect exclusivity back.<br />
<br />
It seems that your daughter is now three conjoined sisters named Marlie, Charlie, and Karlie from right to left. You wondered if the side head’s names were short for Marlotte and Karlotte or something else. In any case, you decide to let them have some private time and move the body with the phone over towards the kitchen, where things were getting interesting.<br />
<br />
“Ah! Oh Mary, those tentacles of yours are so, SO good at pleasing a woman!” Mona was wrapped in the tentacles of two Marys—her limbs caressing breasts and fucking the succubus’s ass and pussy—while her six arms stroked the cocks of three of Erika’s bodies. Your clone had its own Mary all to herself, its cocks getting stroked by tentacles as you kiss. With the body outside you target Mona and see what you get.<br />
<br />
“The succubus is enjoying a married couple.”<br />
<br />
It takes you a moment to come up with an idea, but a wicked grin comes over your face as you input the change.<br />
<br />
“The succubus is parasitizing a married couple.”<br />
<br />
As the three lovers all climaxed, an inky black flowed into the body’s of Erika and Mary. Suddenly all of both of their bodies, even the ones that weren’t fucking Mona, began to transform. Erika’s cocks bulged and swelled as their shape became... curvy? Yes, her cocks took on what was clearly the shape of a woman’s torso, though one with six breasts. Details began to take form on these cocks: a horned head, eyes, nipples, six arms, and even a pair of bat wings and a spaded tail. All of Erika’s cocks were now copies of Mona’s body from the hips up, though they were still only two feet tall.<br />
<br />
At the same time, Mary found the nipples her five breasts changing form as Mona’s essence overtook them. The outer two on the upper row opened into eyes, the centre one became a lipple, and the lower two became pussies. Six arms, all covered in Mona’s lavender skin, burst from Mary’s sides as well, concluding her transformation.<br />
<br />
“Fuuuuuuccccck! This is amazing!” “Being a cock feels sooooo goood!” The two Mona-cocks on one of Erika’s bodies writhed as they spoke, rubbing their arms down their bodies.<br />
<br />
“Thanks so much for letting me ‘infect’ you, so few people are this open minded.” This statement came from the lipple on one of Mary’s bodies.<br />
<br />
“And being part of so many bodies at once is divine!” A different lipple continued the thought.<br />
<br />
“Well you did want to be around to keep an eye on Julie. As fellow parents we can relate to that.” The Mary held hands with the set of Mona’s hand below her own.<br />
<br />
“What about you Mrs. Johnson.” Mona’s real body spoke, “Would you let me become a part of you as well? I promise it feels amazing to be fused with a succubus.”<br />
<br />
This offer was tempting, but you wonder how her being fused with you would effect the app’s reality alteration. Would she still be ignorant of what you’ve done? Would she only be aware of things going forward? Would she be ok with this, or try to stop you or worse—make you change things back?</p>
<hr/><h3>
Do you let Mona infect you?</h3>
