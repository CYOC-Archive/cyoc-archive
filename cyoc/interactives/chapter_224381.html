<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Spotting a bar in the corner, Simon makes his way over hoping to find some glasses for his new friends. As he clops across the room, he adjusts his leggings. "Clearly not build for me" he murmurs to himself. Creases were evident in the deep purple of the fur, the sag making it difficult to keep the leggings up, balance on the already wobbly hooves, all while carrying the heavy cask.<br />
<br />
Reaching the bar, Simon was happy to collapse onto one of the stools, letting his cask rest for a moment on the counter. Taking in a breathe, he looked up to see the bar keep, a young man - younger than Matt even - probably a college freshman. His costume appeared to be a crudely assembled, loose fitting kangaroo getup. Based on the look, it was evident he'd put little effort into the outfit.<br />
<br />
"Er-what can I get you?" He asked, a hint of nervousness in his voice. Around him sat an array of bottles, vintages and implements. Based on the kid's clear look of uncertainty, it was obvious he didn't know what he was doing.<br />
<br />
"Aren't you a bit young to be serving alcohol?" Simon asked, using a bit of small talk to let his arm rest a bit after carrying the cask around<br />
<br />
"N-No sir, just need to be 18 in this state. Can't drink the stuff...but I guess i'm old enough to sell it."<br />
"You ever keep a bar before?"<br />
"No...I was kinda rushed in here last minute. The barman they hired for the night dropped out and I honestly just ran into that 'Mister E' on the street and he offered some big bucks for just one night of bar tending. Frankly....I don't know what I'm doing at all."<br />
<br />
"They expect you to just pick up bar tending like that? No instruction?" Simon asked<br />
<br />
"Er- feels that way right now. Mister E said not to worry; said it'd be easy. that I'd be a natural and could pick it up right away."<br />
<br />
"heh - good luck with that! Suppose that explains the costume then"<br />
"yea- I just threw it on last minute. My Halloween outfit from last year. The boss had me scribble down a character" He pulled out an index card "I'm supposed to be - "<br />
<br />
In the distance simon a door slammed shut, interrupting the boy. A wave of excited murmmerings crossed the room.<br />
<br />
"Finally, the funs going to begin" came a voice<br />
<br />
"I can feel it already!" said another<br />
<br />
"Time to get into character!" said a man sitting at the bar not far from Simon .<br />
<br />
"Looks like the nights getting going. Suppose I should start getting into character" Simon, or Staf rather, said. Turning back to the boy, he decided to make a point of introducing himself. Putting out his hand to shake the boys "Nice to meet you, names Stafylos, but I go by Staf. "<br />
<br />
"Um - yea, to get the cash boss said I have to play along." the boy shook Staf's hand lightly " As I was about to say..."<br />
<br />
He looked down at the cue card briefly, then back up at Staf. "Names' charlie, Charlie the kangaroo. Fresh off the boat from down under."<br />
<br />
Staf shifted slightly on the stool, for some reason his leggings felt a bit better than before, less loose.<br />
<br />
"Nice to meet you Charlie, since I'm the er- eternally tipsy satyr" unexpectedly, he let out a slight hick-up "hic - I -er I figured I had to start my night at the bar!" as the words left his mouth, Staf shook his head a bit. For some reason he felt a slight dizzyness start to come on. His head rushed for a few seconds, forcing him to close his eyes to steady his mind. Within moments, however, the unexpected rush evened out into a slight buzz, akin to being perhaps 2 drinks in.<br />
<br />
Blinking slightly he looked back up at the boy. He blinked again. For some reason the boy's costume seemed somewhat - better - the fur was thicker, more realistic and the cut of the fabric was increasingly form fitting. Staf shook his head, confused yet chalked it up to his general tendency to be inobservant.<br />
<br />
Nonetheless, Staf fgured this kid was the perfect person to use to get more into character before he had to break the 'ice' of his role with his new friends.<br />
<br />
"As the satyr of wine, I just had to see what vintages you had behind the bar. I hear tell you are the best bar tender in town after all!"<br />
<br />
Staf played up his role. He knew nothing about wine, and definitely knew the kid wouldn't either - but figured he'd have a bit of fun while they were both testing the waters.<br />
<br />
"Oh uh..." A look of uncertainty crossed the boy's face. from the corner of his eye, Staf swore he saw the ears of the costume pulled back slightly.<br />
<br />
Staf winked at the kid, trying to defuse his awkwardness. He was just trying to have some fun after all " No pressure - just trying to get into my character - you should too! Its kinda fun."<br />
<br />
Charlie smiled, feeling a bit better about committing to the bit "Roight" he tested out a thick Australian accent - something definably not the boy's fore " ye, you better believe I'm the best bar tender in town, in all of Australia in fact!" As each world left his mouth, his clunky, faux accent seemed to shift, more natural, authentic Australian tones gradually peppering the words.<br />
<br />
While Staf figured the accent was just the boy starting to get into character, he also noticed Charlie's posture shift with each word. A new confidence seemed to slowly well in him, he gradually looked more assured, stood straighter. More to the point, Staf noticed Charlie abscent mindedly pick up a lime and a paring knife.<br />
<br />
"You’ve come to the right place, mate! If you’re a fan of plonk, we’ve got the best bloody vintages in town." as he spoke, his hands busied themselves, delicately slicing the skin of the fruit into a long twisted ribbon, craftsmanship the product of no-doubt countless hours of work. More and more, the accent flowed with an easy naturalism.<br />
<br />
"Plonk?" Staf replied, he sifted once more in his chair. For some reason the cushioning of the costume didn't seem quite as thick as before.<br />
<br />
"What you yanks call wine. Name a vintage and its yours. We've got 'em all" By now the boy's voice was thoroughly Australian. The accent of a true native.<br />
<br />
Glad the kids having some fun with it, but can't say I know enough about wine to keep up this back and forth staf thought.<br />
<br />
"Try me. Name your favotite, goat boy" The boy pushed a bit more<br />
<br />
"Er - do you have Château Latour ?" Staf surprised himself, while he knew nothing about wine the name of the fine vintage just seemed to slip from his mouth.<br />
<br />
"And I thought you'd give me a hard one" Reaching down, Charlie pulled up that vary bottle. At the sight, Staf's eyes dilated, pupils taking on a somewhat rectangular shape. For some reason just looking at the wine seemed to deepen the dizzyness of his thoughts, making him feel as if he was maybe 3 drinks in, not just two. He licked his lips in thirst.<br />
<br />
Staf grinned and looked back to Charlie, "Thats impressive, but do you have Château Latour 2004?"<br />
<br />
The roo grinned back "Thought you'd never ask, mate" In one expect motion, he pulled out the exact bottle, uncorked it and slide it over to Staf. "Bottles all yours"<br />
<br />
Staf was amazed. They had it. His favorite, licking his lips, grabing the bottle he brought it to his lips and took a deep gulp.<br />
<br />
Then another<br />
And another<br />
And more.<br />
Feeling the delicious, rich flavor of the wine flow over his tounge his eyes rolled backed in pleasure. Lost in the ecstasy of the wine, he didn't notice as the tips of his fingers wrapped around the bottle slowly darkened, the nails seeming to expand into thick hoof-like caps on each digit.<br />
<br />
"Baa that's good" he bleated as he pulled the empty bottle from his mouth, setting it on the bar, a contented smile crossed his face as he felt a deeper level of intoxication wash over him, a form of tipsyness that felt akin to a familiar, a warm embrace.<br />
<br />
"You sure do like your wine" The barkeep said as he gently polished a glass<br />
<br />
"Hard not to with wine that good." Staf licked his lips once more, tasting a stray dribble of the nectar of the gods. Only then did he realize what he'd just done.<br />
<br />
"er-uh, sorry for drinking the whole thing, not really sure what came over me. It was just....so good. I couldn't help it."<br />
<br />
"No worries mate, we're well stocked here. I keep a tight ship. Best in aussie after all!"<br />
<br />
Staf smiled at the roo, "Anyway, wine is actually why I came over. My friends and I were just about to try my own vintage and I need four glasses."<br />
<br />
"roight," Charlie nodded " always happy to help" The roo grabbed four glasses from behind the counter, setting them before Staf.<br />
<br />
Was he wearing a fake roo nose before? Staf thought as he looked up from the glasses and back up at the boy. His nose was dark, and seemed to extend slightly from his face, a length that almost made it look like he had a real roo muzzle.<br />
<br />
Nonetheless, Staf brushed it off, his tipsyness making it easy to disregard the bizarre. "It was nice chatting Charlie. Honestly, I think Mister E was right, you are a natural at this!"<br />
<br />
Staf was honestly impressed at the boy, he really did see to know more than he let on before.<br />
<br />
In response, however, Chrlie only looked confused, as if only then realizing just how easy the work had been. "Er - yea. You're right. It is ---easy" He rubbed his head slightly, hand pulling his ears back, only for them to spring back into place, each twitching slightly. "I-I feel like I've been doing this for years for some reason. Its...its weird."<br />
<br />
Staf, in his intoxication, only smiled " Well whatever it is, keep it up! You're doing great!" Showing his appreciation, staff pulled out a 20 and slipped it over to the bar keep.<br />
<br />
"Here's a little something to slip into your pouch, my good roo, to show my appreciation" Staf smiled, expertly collecting the glasses in one hoof capped hand and the cask in the other, before turning to find his way over to his friends. From across the room, he saw the trio waiting for him. He couldn't help but chuckle slightly as he saw Matt still toying with his loose costume. "Well, guess its time for them to start getting into character as well. Good thing we have this wine to help."<br />
<br />
______________________________________<br />
<br />
"My pouch?" Charlie said aloud, still confused, as Matt clopped off to his friends. As the words left his lips his confused looks twisted in to one of pleasure as a wonderful tingling sensation crossed his stomach. His eyes rolled back as sensations assaulted him. He fell against the bar, a four fingered hand catching him as he struggled to maintain composure. On his torso he felt something open up, a deep pleasure seeming to gently dig into him, forming a warm, inviting space. A pocket. A pouch. Moments later, the pleasure slowly abated, and he looked down.<br />
<br />
"Of course....my pouch" he said His hand gently caressed a new fold of flesh that had formed on his stomach. A stomach that, for the first time, he realized was covered in thick fur. "I-I have a pouch. Why does that feel....normal?" Uncertainty heavy in his voice, laden with a heavy dose of wonder.<br />
<br />
"Charlie!" Came a voice. Charlie shook his head and turned to see a waving customer. "Roight, no time to check out me pouch. I'll deal with this weird stuff later. Got a bar to run"<br />
<br />
Absent mindedly he tucked the 20 into his pouch , and hopped over to get right to work.</p>
