<br />
Sam Edmond stretched and leaned back in his computer chair a smile etched on his face. The game on the computer screen showed a scoreboard and at the very top was SammE with thirty kills and zero deaths. Once again Sam was the best on his team. &quot;Hey guys I&#39;m gonna do some homework. Talk to you later!&quot; Sam said into his headset and then logged out.<br />
<br />
Sam took his headset off and spun in his computer chair to grab his backpack off of his bed, he rummaged through it to find his US Government binder and pulled it out. His teacher had assigned a bunch of definitions from the chapter in the textbook, which was annoying because Sam would much rather watch an anime or read a manga than do his homework tonight. Sam gazed over at the boxes piled in the corner of his room waiting to be unpacked from the move his family recently made into the country from the suburbs. Inside one of those boxes was the first issue of the Attack on Titan Manga that Sam wanted to read to compare to the anime. Sighing Sam began his homework.<br />
<br />
As the afternoon turned to early evening Sam began to get tired of working on the definitions as they were taking longer than he would have liked them to, some of the terms were obscure and buried in the chapter text. Sam put down his pencil and closed his textbook deciding that he&#39;d get up and go get a drink from the Kitchen.<br />
<br />
Sam stood up and stretched, as he did so he caught a glimpse of himself in the full length body mirror on the wall. Sam grimaced, he was in his own opinion overly scrawny and his face had acne scars that he thought made him look ugly. His short light blond mop of hair was messy and looked stupid, at least in Sam&#39;s opinion. Sam turned away from his reflection and made his way over to the door and out into the hallway. Running down the hallway and to the stairs Sam took them two at a time as he ran to the kitchen.<br />
<br />
His mother Katherine was working on dinner when he rushed in. She looked up, &quot;Sam! How many times do I have to tell you not to run down the stairs? It was true at our old house and its true now! You could fall and break your neck. Also how was school?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice to see you too Mom&quot; Sam said as he made his way to the refrigerator. &quot;School was okay, I&#39;m dying from my AP Gov homework though. I&#39;ve been working on it since I got home this afternoon.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katherine frowned, &quot;You work too hard for your own good Sammy. You keep yourself locked up in that room of yours playing your games or doing your homework and you never have any fun or socializing with kids your own age.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom,&quot; Sam said rolling his eyes. &quot;Video games are fun and I have friends my own age on the internet as well as at school.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I don&#39;t know any of them! You know when I was your age we&#39;d go out to parties and meet up with people in the real world. I insist you take thirty minutes out of your evening to go outside, right now! No arguing, your homework can wait thirty minutes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam grabbed a Coke from the refrigerator and sighed, &quot;Fine. I need a break anyway. But I&#39;m taking my phone.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam vaguely heard his Mom say something about, &quot;Kids these days.&quot; as he made his way into the living room and out the front door.<br />
<br />
The evening was cool and Sam thought briefly about grabbing a jacket, but in the end decided against it. His Mom would question why he was back so soon and it&#39;d just be awkward, and awkward social situations were something that Sam tried to avoid.<br />
<br />
Sam decided he&#39;d take a walk in the woods behind his house, somewhere he had not gotten the chance to explore yet. Sam began to make his way through the trees, walking a path north of his house. Sam occasionally looked at Reddit as he made his way through the forest walking aimlessly, content in the knowledge that he just had to use the compass on his phone to find south and make it back home. Unbeknownst to Sam as he walked through the forest, the terrain subtlety shifted. Trees became denser, vines began to become a common sight and strange sounds began to fill the evening air. Suddenly and without warning the temperature ratcheted up, what was a cool evening was now a blisteringly hot and humid one. Sam felt a pang of fear as he looked up from his phone. Something was wrong, very wrong.<br />
<br />
The trees loomed overhead forming a canopy that blotted out the stars suddenly Sam heard a branch snap behind him and a loud growl. Sam took off in a sprint away deeper into the inexplicably formed jungle, his heart pounding a mile a minute. The sweltering heat suffocating as Sam ran for his life. Sweat pooled in Sam&#39;s armpits and dark blond hair kept getting into Sam&#39;s eyes as he ran. Sam thought that was odd because his hair was short and light blond.<br />
<br />
Sam looked behind him to see if he was being chased and in that moment plowed directly into a mess of vines. Sam struggled, trying to untangle himself from the vines. Dark brown hair getting in his eyes as he felt the vines begin to wrap themselves around his right ankle on their own.<br />
<br />
Sam suddenly was yanked into the air by the vines, blood flowed to Sam&#39;s head making him dizzy. Sam gasped as he looked up and saw his pale skin darkening, becoming tanned and toned. Sam screamed in horror, &quot;Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! I&#39;m asleep in my room, I was clearly reading a manga about tomb raiders!&quot;<br />
<br />
As Sam grappled with the horror of being flung into the air and his skin changing coloration, a vine with a spiked tip snaked its way into Sam&#39;s shirt and ripped it to shreds, leaving Sam shirtless. Sam watched as his sweat drenched t-shirt fell to the ground. <br />
<br />
Sam dizzily watched as his smooth chest and thin arms began to bulk up and gain definition. He watched as a four pack formed and felt a surge of energy go through him. He felt stronger, yet the vine still held him tight dangling over roots and underbrush shaded by the canopy of the tall trees overhead.<br />
<br />
Next the sharp vine slipped into Sam&#39;s shorts and ripped them off, revealing Sam&#39;s legs. &quot;This can&#39;t be happening.&quot; Sam watched as his legs went through the same process that his arms and chest went through. They gained definition and muscle before his eyes. It began to rain and Sam felt very dizzy due to hanging upside down for so long and he began to lose consciousness.<br />
<br />
When Sam awoke the vine was still holding him dangling over the roots and underbrush, but there was a small puddle of water that had formed on the ground. In the puddle Sam could see a boy about his age wearing nothing but a pair of boxer briefs with tanned skin and tons of muscle. The boy in the puddle had long dirty brown hair and rough calloused skin. His face was clear of blemishes and it took a moment for Sam to remember and realize that he was looking at himself.<br />
<br />
Suddenly the vine moved flipping Sam into the air and catching him upside down. Sam felt nauseous as he flew through the air. What would happen next?</p>
