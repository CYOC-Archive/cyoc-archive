<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mark thought about what he could do with Aidan. The options were endless. But there was one thing he always wanted, and now he could get his wish fulfilled. It would make Aidan go mad; he knew how much his friend hated what he would become.<br />
Aidan saw the look on Mark´s face changing from thoughtful over excited to a slightly evil sadistic one, and whatever he was thinking of doing, he was sure he himself wouldn´t like it. But he could do nothing to stop Mark.<br />
“You know”, Mark started: “I always wanted a specific pet, but never got it. I guess you can get me my desire fulfilled Aidan. I always wanted a big spider, maybe a tarantula or something similar. A docile, harmless, and trained pet spider. Or maybe even a couple?” Mark had a slightly dreaming smile cross his face, thinking what he would make Aidan be.<br />
Aidan had his eyes widening in shock when Mark said he would become his pet. But when he went over what exactly he wanted as a pet, he would have fainted if he could. Not only did he hate spiders, he also feared the bigger ones. And to become something like a tarantula… He tried to plead at Mark with his eyes, the only thing he could do right now.<br />
But Mark wasn´t aware of Aidan´s fear, and he liked his idea too much to care anyway. So, after his daydreams finished, he smiled at Aidan before saying: “Okay, it´s decided. Aidan, you will become a million spiders.” Mark hadn´t even really realized he hadn´t said minion like he planned to. But he soon would.<br />
Aidan´s face would have been absolutely horrified for becoming a spider, but he had heard what exactly Mark had said. A million spiders. But that would mean…<br />
Suddenly, Aidan gagged, before his mind switched off, sending him into a dark unawareness of what would happen to him. That simply happened because his brain got overwhelmed by sensations of everything in him becoming individual spiders, from his organs and his bones up to cells. Adding to that was that his brain itself was changing into spiders as well.<br />
As Mark watched, hopping that Aidan´s change would be interesting, he noted how Aidan´s body started to swell while it turned darker. But he didn´t realize the problem he had set himself. <br />
Within half a minute, Aidan´s body had already split his jeans, socks, and underwear away, leaving him a naked, bloated mass of dark flesh. And then, it suddenly was like his body had been a balloon that was filled over its limit, and he burst. And showered everything in the room with spiders.<br />
Mark had been confused why Aidan´s body didn´t gained additional legs like he thought would happen. He thought Aidan swelled and would become a big spider, and shrink afterwards. When he instead suddenly burst, he himself screamed in horror. But that was his last mistake.<br />
The spiders, various types of them, flew everywhere, including Mark´s now wide-open mouth. And while all the spiders were rather small, the little poison they had was enough to paralyze Mark´s body in seconds. A few of the spiders Mark had swallowed down as he tried to hinder them from entering his mouth, but it had been too late.<br />
Now, Mark stood there, very much aware of his body, but couldn´t do anything but look around with his eyes, and even they were slowly stopping to work. And before long, the army of spiders started to wrap up their big prey in webs. Normally, a single spider or even a small group wouldn´t have attacked something as big as a human, but while separate beings, they were still linked over being one thing before, and from what was sent in Aidan´s body, their prey was dangerous to them and needed to be stopped.<br />
While it took them some time, the spiders finally had Mark wrapped up in a cocoon that was then lifted under the ceiling of the room, with Mark himself still being unable to do anything. And by the tight wraps of web around him, even if he could move, there was no way he could break them. He was trapped, and had no idea how this happened. Why had Aidan burst into this much spiders? And why did they attack him? Would he be able to free himself later?<br />
For the next few hours, Mark was left hanging, while the spiders webbed the whole flat. Many used an open window to get outside, and soon even more nets were webbed around the building.<br />
<br />
Aidan himself woke from his unawareness after even more time, and it took him great afford to not lose his mind. For one, he could still feel every last spider his body had become. And not all of them were still alive, not that he knew that. It was too much information for his poor mind. The other reason was the fact that he was something he hated and feared. But the longer he was aware, the more he wondered why exactly he hated them. Unbeknownst to him, it slowly reworked his mind to liking spiders, he was one after all.<br />
He had limited control over them, as each spider had their own little mind, and his was like a hive-mind behind them. He needed to get his body back, so he tried to get them all back into reach. He learned to control a single spider out of them all, making the flood of information easier to control, as he didn´t get everything all the time then, at least to his own awareness.<br />
After even more time, which Aidan used to “jump” from spider to spider he could control, he found a bigger one he could use at the computer, and hit the first thing he could find to help himself, merge back. The sensation that followed again made Aidan black out. Every spider his body had separated into came flying like sucked into a black hole just in front of his laptop, making a wiggling mass of flesh on his carpet. A few extras also were sucked into the mass, including any normal spider that had been in reach. <br />
Said mass then slowly reformed into a shape the individual parts had before, meaning now Aidan become a single, but big spider. Another hour went by, before Aidan awoke again. It was easy for him to control his body now, as he had some knowledge from the time before, his body was just much bigger than before.<br />
The chronivac had no back-up data from him, as he hadn´t enabled it to be saved for later use. It had just saved the last change made to be able to undo it. But the last change the program made was enabling Mark to change him, as his changes were made by Mark´s comment, not the program itself.<br />
Aidan worked some time to reform his body, but it was no use to get it fully back to normal. So, he thought about what he could change back or if he just stayed a gigantic spider. No though went to what happened to Mark. He had the memory burrowed somewhere, but after what happened, that bastard wasn´t important. Maybe he would think about him later, or never.</p>
