<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lara&#39;s stomach let out a hungry gurgle. I looked at her, the succubus turning almost as red as her hair. &quot;Hungry?&quot; I asked more out of teasing than legitimacy. She smirked, looking embarrassed as her eyes began scanning for some place to eat. She finally settled on a restaurant called The Food Rack. I recognized the place. My sister worked here during the her high school summers and college years and often spoke of it. It was a family owned establishment that went for a more traditional feel. Think seventies or eighties small town feel only without the tackiness. It did fairly well but had been on the decline the past few years, often warning Alyssa that she might not have a job the following year. Fortunately for her, she brought in good business. Not sure how, but she had managed to outlast several other mainstay waitresses and was still going strong. I almost hesitated to go in, remembering how weird Alyssa was a week ago and how she was worse before. But, Lara was hungry and I had to admit that the weekend had not been kind to me either. So in we went, only to be greeted by a petite young lady who could barely see over the podium. She wore the standard outfit for the waiting staff: a maroon polo and beige knee-length pleated skirt. She wore plain black framed glasses that did her no favors and her dark hair was tied back in a casual ponytail. She flashed us a cute smile as we approached. <br />
<br />
&quot;Table for two?&quot; she asked, grabbing the laminated menus. We nodded to which she directed us to a table. &quot;Breakfast menu alright?&quot; she asked again, Lara agreeing it would be sufficient. We started off with drinks which the waitress jotted down before dismissing herself, the five foot even girl walking towards the kitchen to retrieve our initial orders. Lara looked around, noticing how over half the tables were empty and the waiting staff seemed thin. <br />
<br />
&quot;Odd,&quot; she remarked, noting the rather sizeable crowd bustling throughout the mall and the stark contrast of population in the restaurant. &quot;Is there food here bad?&quot; she asked, looking at me as though I were somehow an expert on the matter. <br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know, honestly. Alyssa has worked here all through high school and to my knowledge still does. They just don&#39;t seem to do good business though. Between the high turn over of waitresses and the fact that they&#39;re not a chain doesn&#39;t help,&quot; I shrugged. <br />
<br />
&quot;Seriously,&quot; a familiar voice sighed as a feminine hand placed our drinks on the table. I looked up to see Alyssa standing there with her tray in hand and looking sour. &quot;Why the hell are you two here?&quot; she asked, looking embarrassed upon me seeing her in the waitress outfit. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alyssa!&quot; Lara shouted, jumping on her and nearly knocking her over with the force of a loving embrace. I couldn&#39;t help but smirk while Alyssa tried her best not to look happy. &quot;It&#39;s been so long.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I-it&#39;s only been a week Lara, shit...&quot; Alyssa blushed. I had to admit I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d ever get used to this. I was familiar with the Alyssa that was rude and abrasive just for the sake of it. Hell, I almost died of shock one time when her manager described her as &#39;A very charming young lady.&#39; Yet here she was acting more embarrassed, shy, and flustered than anything else. I could tell that Lara&#39;s mind scramble meant Alyssa and her now had some sort of pseudo-sister connection. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, my gosh you look so cute,&quot; Lara squeeled, turning to me. &quot;Doesn&#39;t she look adorable, Jethro?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... uh... you look really cute, sis,&quot; I sputtered, feeling awkward saying it. I wasn&#39;t lying, mind you, she did look nice, younger even. If I didn&#39;t know her I would have still guess she was in high school. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sh-shut up,&quot; Alyssa rebuked, blushing bright red. &quot;Have you decided what you want to eat?&quot; she huffed, taking her pen and pad of paper in hand. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Alyssa, you&#39;re always so closed off. I mean, we&#39;re practically sisters, what&#39;s the problem?&quot; Lara prodded. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m working, and you&#39;re well... you&#39;re embarrassing me. Just like you always do,&quot; Alyssa admitted, looking more than a little flustered and scribbling on the pad. That was her one nervous tick, the sure sign that she was uncomfortable. <br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t help it. I know you&#39;re the oldest of us but you&#39;re so cute and shy it&#39;s hard not to tease you every once in a while.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Lara please don&#39;t do that to me here. We&#39;re having a rough enough day as it is,&quot; she muttered. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why, what&#39;s wrong?&quot; I asked, feeling like such a question would be natural. That&#39;s when it dawned on me that perhaps my family&#39;s memories weren&#39;t the only ones Lara messed with. Perhaps she tweaked me a bit too. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, just the same old, same old. Not enough business, not enough revenue, too many paychecks to write,&quot; she huffed, looking me in the eye like an equal for the first time in ever. &quot;Manager&#39;s slashing our wages.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought waitresses only worked for tips,&quot; Lara frowned. <br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re guaranteed five dollars and hour. Tips are to bridge the gap between our salary and the minimum wage. Only now that&#39;s been reduced to three-fifty an hour. I&#39;m making three dollars less every two hours. It&#39;s a nightmare.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds it,&quot; I nodded. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why don&#39;t you draw in more business?&quot; Lara asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Bad location?&quot; Alyssa suggested. &quot;I mean there is a sizeable food court just on the other side of the mall, and let&#39;s face it, no one comes to the mall to sit down in a restaurant. They go somewhere else for that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you ask me, all this restaurant needs is a hook,&quot; Lara smiled. &quot;Something that makes it stand out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, well my degree is in business management, not marketing,&quot; Alyssa sighed. &quot;Now what can I get for you?&quot; she asked again, dismissing the conversation. We outlined our orders and handed her our menus. She took them and darted away to the kitchen to try and fill them quickly. <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s sad really,&quot; Lara moaned. &quot;This is a really nice place.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sometimes nice isn&#39;t what draws in business,&quot; I noted, looking at a group of guys standing awkwardly at the entrance to the restaurant. It was obvious that they were debating amongst themselves whether to eat here or just grab something at the food court. The girl at the front just stood, staring back at them awkwardly as though wondering how to convince them to join. <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re right, but you know what does?&quot; Lara smiled, her eyes betraying a certain mischief that I recognized all too well. <br />
<br />
&quot;Lara...&quot; I started, trying to figure out what was going through her her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ooh,&quot; I heard, turning around to see the short girl looking at herself in shock. Her shirt was getting tight, really tight, the buttons on her polo popping off and collar spliting as several inches of cleavage began to poke up. That wasn&#39;t all. Her ass was getting an expansion as well, the hem of her skirt seeming to lift in the back as her rump seemed to inflate. The group of men were staring at her with eyes wide, hands over their gaping mouths. <br />
<br />
&quot;Lara what are you doing?&quot; I asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;T-table for six?&quot; the waitress asked, her voice suddenly sounding shaky and feminine. The whole group shouted a resounding yes and she turned to lead them to the table. My jaw dropped as I saw the full extend of her... modifications. She looked completely different with full lips, cute bangs, and a sharp jawline. Her eyes practically sparkled from under her glasses and the way she walked brought undivided attention to her ass. They all took their seats and the waitress returned to the front. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, so you got them a few extra customers, that won&#39;t convince people to spend money here,&quot; I noted, realizing how stupid my statement was the moment I saw her sly smile. <br />
<br />
&quot;You think she&#39;s the only one who&#39;s going to... grow into her position. Watch and learn,&quot; Lara smiled. Another waitress came from the back and greeted the group of guys with a hearty smile. She was tall and thin like Alyssa but was a dirty blonde with no curves to speak of. All six boys were staring at the short girl&#39;s ass, paying very little attention to the blonde waitress who was growing increasingly annoyed by their distracted gazes. Just as she was about to give up, her nipples hardened through her shirt, the flesh around them beginning to puff up. It was as though she had finally hit puberty and it was making up for lost time. Gradually, the guys at the table turned to look at her. She cooed as her breasts grew, tightening her shirt and popping her collar like the other one before her. Her hips widened as though she were getting ready to conceive and her ass pushed out so as to give her an unnatural curve. <br />
<br />
&quot;Damn,&quot; one of the guys mused, checking out her new rack, mesmerised by the nipples that threatened to poke through the fabric on her shirt. The polo barely fit her now, a sliver of flesh showing from between her skirt and shirt. &quot;I&#39;d like some milk, if you all have some,&quot; he muttered, trying to be sly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well of course we do, honey,&quot; the waitress smiled, her voice now sexy like a porn star. She gave him a playful wink and jotted down the others&#39; drink orders before walking to the back. Alyssa almost ran into the other, staring as the bodacious blonde passed her, now inexplicably busty. <br />
<br />
Alyssa approached out table and began handing out food, distracted by the girl at the front. &quot;That&#39;s weird, what happened to Jessica and Danielle? They were never curvy.&quot; <br />
<br />
Lara gave me a devious smile to which I shook my head. I knew what she was thinking and holy fuck I did not want to see my sister as a voluptuous bimbo looking waitress. &quot;Oh, nothing much,&quot; Lara answered, ignoring me. &quot;Just the same thing that&#39;s going to happen to you.&quot; Lara stood up and grabbed Alyssa&#39;s breast, the other giving a shocked look before feeling her bust growing. She was never particularly busty, coming in at a small C cup. Now they grew to double Ds, treating her polo with the same grace that the others experienced. Her ass rounded out nicely and her abs became even more defined while her biceps lest some definition to appear a bit slimmer. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow,&quot; Alyssa hissed, looking at herself with wonder and pride. &quot;I&#39;m so sexy. How did-&quot; Lara smiled, her eyes flashing a brilliant pink. <br />
<br />
&quot;Didn&#39;t you know? Every girl who gets hired here becomes a bombshell within the first few days. There&#39;s something special about this place. You&#39;ve always been this hot.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You know something, Lara? You&#39;re right. I was just too self-conscious to notice,&quot; Alyssa smiled, straightening up and walking away with a noticeable bounce and swish. Within a few minutes the tables that were once empty were quickly filling up and every waitress was now a curvaceous vixen that elicited big tips and bigger tents. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I give up, why?&quot; I asked as Lara and I finished our breakfast. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why what?&quot; she smiled, finishing off a glass of milk. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why did you use your magic to save the restaurant... because I assume that&#39;s what you just did.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s true. Sex sells after all. As for the why... I don&#39;t know. I guess I just felt like it. I am capable of great things, you know. Magic is not just for sex and seduction. If I can&#39;t use it for some fun what good is it for?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just feels like everything you do is to acquire more sex and power. I don&#39;t really see that here,&quot; I countered. <br />
<br />
&quot;True, but as I said, what&#39;s the point in having magic powers if you can&#39;t have fun with them. So, how about we pay for our breakfast and have some more fun?&quot; she smiled. <br />
<br />
All I could do was smile back and pay the bill before leaving the restaurant far busier than when we arrived.</p>
