<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As much as you feel obligated to fulfilling Evan’s responsibilities, you believe that you should prioritize your own situation first. After all, you don&#39;t know when you will return to your own body. Also, 15 minutes should be enough to take care of both if everything goes smoothly, right?<br />
<br />
But to take care of your own situation, you would have to inform your teachers with a reason to explain your absence. Coming up with an excuse was tricky, but you thought of one just as a group of teachers start filing into the teachers’ office to prepare for their next period. You went up to your two teachers for your two upcoming periods and called them over into a corner of the office. You told them that Mark was suffering from terrible food poisoning from his lunch and that he had to go home early today. At first, they seemed suspicious, as this would seem like something the administration would handle, but you said that you (Mr. Wright) witnessed Mark feeling so unwell that you had to contact his parents immediately to pick him up. You elaborated that it had just happened recently, which is why you were notifying Mark’s teachers about his absence for their upcoming periods. After a couple of weird stares, they seemed to buy the explanation and told you not to worry about it and that they would make sure to give Mark an excused absence when taking attendance. They then began a brief conversation on how the new teaching experience was (for Mr. Wright), which you just nodded to feign interest. In your mind, you were really planning your next step.<br />
<br />
After the short discussion ended, you breathed a sigh of relief that you took care of your unexplained absence. Unfortunately, it took a bit more time than expected, as you only had 5 more minutes before the next period. Hastily, you grabbed Evan’s class materials and headed towards his designated classroom. Students were already sitting in their desks, but they were all conversing amongst themselves, which gave you a bit of time to review Evan’s planner. You dropped the class materials on Evan’s desk and sat on his swivel chair, which you had to admit, felt nice. The cushion was much comfier than the hard student chairs you were accustomed to. You were grateful that Evan kept a neat lecture agenda with detailed tasks in his planner. Because of this, it didn&#39;t take long for you to learn what you were supposed to do in class today. Luckily for you, since today’s schedule revolved around the students working in groups for an upcoming literary discussion, you wouldn’t have to give a lecture. Closing the planner with a grin on your face, you flipped through Evan’s class notes to refresh yourself on the topics involved in the group work. Unlike math, you didn&#39;t excel in English, but you did manage to get a B in your freshman English class. You assured yourself that with your prior knowledge of the class, as well as Evan&#39;s notes, you could manage answering any question that might arise during the group work.<br />
<br />
The bell rang, signaling the start of the period. You were amazed that the students immediately ended their conversations and sat quietly for your instructions. From your own experience, a couple of students might ramble on, which would have complicated things in your current position. You quickly explained the general assignment for the period, and after students assembled into their own groups, you sat back at the teacher&#39;s desk. Things had gone very smoothly thus far, which was convenient for you. Better yet, you were mostly free for the rest of the period and most likely next period as well. You could get used to having an easy schedule as a teacher. However, just as you had previously feared, it was also boring. Deciding to give yourself something to do, you flipped through Evan&#39;s belongings on his desk.<br />
<br />
The desk contained his stack of materials and an old desktop computer. Sadly, you forgot to bring Evan’s messenger bag, which might have contained more pertinent material for you to inspect. With a slightly disappointed face, you absentmindedly dig through some paper folders. &quot;Literary summaries, student essays, quizzes... oh what&#39;s this, special papers?&quot; You noticed a folder with papers not related to class. Initially hopeful, you became discouraged to find school announcements tucked throughout the folder. Just as you were about to give up, you skimmed over the words &#39;Senior Takeover&#39; on a flyer packet. You took it out in curiosity, wondering how teachers would perceive this event. The first page was the same flyer that students also received. However, flipping through the packet, you noticed that the following pages included tips for teachers, such as choosing the right student match, the general procedure, contingency plans, etc. This information was certainly useful, not only for Senior Takeover, but also for your current state.<br />
<br />
Just as you were about to start reading, you were interrupted by a group of students wanting to ask a question about the assignment. As eager as you were to learn more about the Senior Takeover, you knew you still had a job to do. Their question was tricky at first, but you were able to answer it with some handwritten notes from Evan. After the group of students left your desk, you leaned back in your chair, stretching your legs to the back end of the desk, and thought, &quot;If this is what I have to do for a week, it would be one sweet gig. But now, back to my task at hand.&quot; Before you can do anything though, you realize that you have begun to sweat. Afternoons were still hot in late September and, despite being in an air conditioned classroom, you could still feel the heat. In an attempt to cool off, you unbuttoned a few buttons on your dress shirt, exposing some cleavage from your pecs. As tempting as the invitation was, you knew that you had to show restraint, as fondling yourself in front of the class would be detrimental not to mention highly inappropriate. &quot;At least I feel cooler now,&quot; you thought as you return to reading the flyer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s see, so tips exclusive to teachers, eh?&quot; you thought. &quot;Perhaps it wouldn&#39;t be totally fair if students get FULL control for a week.&quot; Skimming from the first section, you learned about the consciousness and its role. Apparently, the teacher&#39;s consciousness remains dormant inside their own body while the student is in the &#39;driver&#39;s seat&#39;. While the student cannot probe into the teacher&#39;s consciousness for memories or personal information (for safety reasons), the student can temporarily suppress their own control to have the teacher regain control should the need arises. Of course, the student can always take back control at any time, but there would be a 3 second delay between each switch, so the body becomes comatose during those 3 seconds. This is important because if the body is dead by any means, both the teacher and student would technically die, so protecting the body is paramount.<br />
<br />
Other sections mentioned about emergency measures for health problems, disagreements between student and teacher, etc. Reading from front to back, you did not find any information on how the student enters and exits a host body. Perhaps this would be revealed after matches were confirmed. But you were most intrigued by the consciousness concept. &quot;Wow, so Evan’s mind is technically still in here, but sleeping,&quot; you thought while pointing to your forehead. &quot;If this is true for my dad and Coach Lucas as well, then I&#39;m glad that they were sleeping, considering the things I did in their bodies. Funnily enough, I actually haven&#39;t defiled this body yet.&quot; Of course, you hoped that the school day would be over with soon, so you would have the chance to explore this body if you were still in it by that time. The thought had you salivating and...slightly aroused.<br />
<br />
&quot;But what is this about suppressing my own consciousness? How would I do that?&quot; You then tried to imagine suppressing your mind, hoping that you actually don&#39;t return to your own body. You felt your senses fade as your mind went partially numb, like it was falling onto a soft water bed. Your vision then went black for a few seconds before your eyes reopened and blinked a few times. Interestingly, you didn&#39;t consciously blink, as you felt that you lost motor control of the body. Your senses were still there, albeit in a weaker state. You felt your head rise from the desk as your hands grasped your forehead. Your mouth then whispered, &quot;Wait, am I back in the classroom? I thought I was just eating lunch. Ugh, why do I feel groggy?&quot; Your head then turned left and right, either to survey the surroundings or to lose that drowsiness. Clearly, Evan was back in control, and you were just a passenger in his body.<br />
<br />
Confirming that you had suppressed your consciousness, you then wanted to try resurfacing yourself. You concentrated on recapturing the control, and you felt your hands grasping your head once more as your vision faded again. A while later, you rose your head from the desk and opened and closed your hands. You were now back in control, and your senses were back in full state. &quot;Neat, this will be useful if I&#39;m in a pinch about his personal life or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just then, the bell rang, signaling the end of this period. Surprisingly, you were in Evan’s body for almost three hours now, so you expected to leave his body anytime soon. But you suppose that it would be interesting if you still remained, as you can continue learning during the next period, which you presume to be just as free as your previous one.</p>
