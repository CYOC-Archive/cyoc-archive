<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">*Name: Bearman (Homo Ursidae)*<br />
<br />
Having written this in the book, Troy found the information almost flowed out of him. Exact population size, Natural environment, even evolutionary process, seemed to fill themselves out as Troy wrote up his desired traits for his new beast. Knowledge of the specifics that were needed to make a species were a natural extension of his status as the book of beast owner. It was odd, he hadn&#39;t even known that was part of the deal until now but as a sorcerer, he just knew it was. Huh. Good to know.<br />
<br />
Troy finished writing up the Bearman entry. They had a very low current population size, mostly because humans nearly hunted them to extinction. The small amount that remained only really continued because their DNA was compatible with humans so it could hide in hybrid offspring until they reached puberty. Troy wrote one final line.<br />
<br />
*Known Examples: Mark Rugnetta,*<br />
<br />
He added a comma in case Mark might want some friends to share in his condition. Troy heard a light moan escape Mark’s side of the cubicle so instead of peering like they had been doing, Troy got up and walked around the cubicle. There he could watch the changes happening first hand.<br />
<br />
Mark turned around in his chair. His face had already turned into a bear-like muzzle, though his beard hung just as red and fluffy from his now ursine face as it had his human one. Mark was also clearly aroused; his pants barely containing the growing erect member. “He should be,” Troy thought, “Bearmans are sexually active year round and have high libidos.” Troy made his way over to Mark, who was barely able to stay upright in his seat. Another moan threatened to tumble out of Mark’s maw but Troy placed his claw over his new boyfriend&#39;s nose and chin, shutting it so all that came out of it was a low hum. The rest of Mark&#39;s face began to be covered in a shorter, browner colored fur than his hair or beard. His ears repositioned further up on his head and rounded out slightly. Troy waved his hand and a sound-proof illusion was cast over Mark&#39;s cubicle, showing the bearman happily working. Huh. That just came naturally to him now. Interesting.<br />
<br />
Troy grabbed at the bulge in Mark&#39;s pants and another deep hum almost growl escaped Mark&#39;s tight lips. Troy then quickly pulled Mark up and out of his chair, removed Mark&#39;s shirt and pants as well as his own clothes. He couldn&#39;t wait for tonight, he had to fuck this beast now. Mark was beginning to bulk up anyways, his muscles expanding, powerful and heavy. Pecs solidified and abs etched into his stomach. As his muscles finally slowed their growth, fat began pooling around them even more leaving him strong but with minor moobs and a huge belly that drooped from his midsection a little. His chest fur grew in explosively, large red curls surrounded by more brown shorter fur. Troy grabbed the bearman’s head and brought him in for a passionate kiss. Mark&#39;s long tongue filled Troy&#39;s mouth and Troy was now the one to moan slightly. It was like taking a sip of water after running through a desert; They couldn&#39;t get enough of each other.<br />
<br />
Mark&#39;s arms pulsed with energy. They became bigger and stronger as he gripped the back of Troy&#39;s head and pulled him from the kiss. Troy&#39;s bugbear scowl was nowhere to be found, lust was overtaking both of them. Mark raised his arm and shoved Troy&#39;s face into his armpit. Troy didn&#39;t know if he liked it at first but as red fur began to pool inside the sweating place, filling his nose with lustful musk, he couldn&#39;t help licking it. It was sweet and buttery like honey on a biscuit. His erection was pounding now, he needed release. Mark&#39;s arms only grew stronger. Muscle bulged as he gripped tight to Troy&#39;s head. Red and brown fur climbing his arms and on to his hands. Troy felt the grip on his head lighten and took the opportunity to pull away from the tasty experience. Mark was looking at his paws in amazement. Large brown clubs had replaced his hands with sharp claws in place of fingernails and pads instead of a palm. He continued studying them. They were large, flat, and couldn&#39;t possibly be as dexterous as his human hands, yet as he bent them, they moved exactly like you would expect out of a hand and showed more power behind the grip.<br />
<br />
Troy took this time to catch his breath before grabbing Mark, kissing him again. This time it was only for a second before Troy began pulling Marks face down his own hairy body. Mark was strong enough to resist if he wanted to but he knew what was at the end of this journey and both needed it so badly. The Bugbear&#39;s cock stood out at about 10 inches and incredibly thick, Mark had written it into his biography himself after all. He definitely knew what was coming. The bearman&#39;s maw slid open and began lapping at the massive organ. Troy was on Cloud 9. His body tingled with magical energy everytime Mark made contact with his dick. Mark, after teasing the tip a little, finally slipped the whole length down his mouth. His tongue curled around the cock and he began bobbing his head in and out in perfect rhythm, only occasionally taking a moment to smell Troy&#39;s own musk coming from his hairy crotch.<br />
<br />
Troy didn&#39;t last long. It was simply too much. Cum shot out of his cock landing hard into Mark&#39;s waiting maw. Despite the significant load, Mark easily swallowed it, continuing to suck up every morsel. Troy took the time to notice all the red and brown fur on Mark&#39;s back now. It was slowly filling in around his butt as a little nub of skin pushed out of his spine. Mark let go of the cock in his mouth and moaned. Troy, now free, went around the back of Mark, who had put his paws on the ground to brace himself. The tail slowly wiggled from the top of his butt and was quickly covered in nice brown fur. Mark moaned again and the tail waggled. Mark&#39;s butt shifted, first gaining muscle like the rest of him but also plenty of fat. The two hefty mounds, now in front of Troy, were then covered in more brown fur with red fur growing along Mark&#39;s butt crack and under Mark&#39;s tail. Troy was about to get up when he smelled something. It was sweet. He sniffed again and found himself closing in on Mark&#39;s ass. He knew what he was about to do.<br />
<br />
Mark was trying to get up himself when Troy began to lap at his anus. Mark tried to protest but as Troy&#39;s tongue penetrated through his hole, he shuddered and went back to moaning on all fours. Troy was licking at something that was somehow sweeter than Mark&#39;s armpit, Like eating honey straight from the bottle. He was getting hard again and he didn&#39;t even mean to. He placed his hands on Mark&#39;s legs and noticed how they bulged with muscle under his palms only to get covered in more fur. Troy felt his lustful hunger subside as he pulled his face out of the hairy hills. However his cock was back at full attention again and in need of another release. Troy had an idea.<br />
<br />
Mark suddenly found himself flipped on to his back. Mark&#39;s huge cock and balls flopped in front of Troy, red fur having spread to them long before Troy had even entered the cubicle. Troy watched as the sexy bearman tried to peer over his fat gut and decided to make it easier for him. Troy gripped both legs over his shoulders and lined his cock up with Mark&#39;s hole. Mark seemed apprehensive of this until he felt the pleasurable shutters again as Troy slowly inserted himself. Troy was careful, the bearman&#39;s hole was new to this kind of attention. Mark began pawing at his erection. Troy assumed he had been for most of this escapade and as he looked at the cock, he realized he could help with that too.<br />
<br />
He bent down, still deep inside Mark&#39;s ass, and leaned towards Mark&#39;s cock. The bearman saw this and guided his cock into Troy&#39;s mouth. Now when Troy humped, it would also send the cock right into his mouth. And the weirdest thing? It felt so natural. Like this is just how it was like for them. As Troy continued to sexually pleasure his new boyfriend, Mark&#39;s feet turned into large hairy clawed paws. With a moan, Mark came followed swiftly by Troy. The two then collapsed Troy still balls deep in Mark.</p>
