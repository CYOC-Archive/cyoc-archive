<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff got himself off but didn&#39;t feel satisfied. He went throughout the evening trying to distract himself with his phone and video games but something in the back of his mind was nagging him. He found himself going back to the creme, coating his body in the glittery substance and pleasuring himself a second and then third time. The next morning he found himself with an empty jar, in a daze from a terrible nights sleep, and an unnamed urge...<br />
<br />
Jeff started working out when he was twelve, it helped to maximize his testosterone and blessed him with the slightest 5 o&#39;clock shadow at 15 and a half, unlike Michael and the rest of his non-athletic classmates who only just beginning to grow sideburns. It also helped him work through his expanding emotions. No longer could he be described with just happy, sad, angry, scared, and bored. He now has to contend with feelings like horny, jealous, triumphant, confused, and disempowered among many more. Feelings he couldn&#39;t go to his parents to fix, feelings that changed every 5 fucking seconds...<br />
<br />
Jeff used the barbell he had gotten at 13, and after exhausting himself he moved onto sit-ups, then dumbbells. His dad wasn&#39;t athletic and as his fathers waistline was expanding, now nearing his 50&#39;s, he complained about it regularly but didn&#39;t do anything about it. This got Jeff into sports, his goal is to become lean and muscular so that he will be able to manage his body fat more easily when he ages. <br />
<br />
As he was working out his mind was wandering, he and Michael&#39;s relationship was complex. They had given each-other hand jobs a few times and Jeff is curious to go all the way to see if he is gay but Michael is being weird about it which is frustrating, and to make it weirder Michael is convinced they are both gay, where Jeff is experimenting. It isn&#39;t that easy for Jeff. He can identify attractive people, men and women, but he isn&#39;t attracted to them, at least not sexually. He enjoys getting off but in the same way someone enjoys sleeping when tired, eating when hungry or going to the bathroom when they had to hold it. It would be so much easier if he was attracted to either gender, it feels like the whole world is in on a joke that he just doesn&#39;t get.<br />
<br />
He liked Michael because he was smart, funny, kind, and trustworthy. He had a way of seeing through the details to the bigger picture of what was going on almost immediately and explained it in a way to not make Jeff feel stupid. Jeff appreciated Michael for who he was and would care for him in the same way if he was a guy or girl.<br />
<br />
His arms, chest and abdomen now burned with exhaustion and it was only 5 am. His parents are still asleep and the urge is growing stronger, but no more defined. He doesn&#39;t know how to satisfy it. Jeff now needs a shower and can&#39;t go back to bed until he washes the sweat off, but taking a shower this early will surely wake his parents up and ruin everyone&#39;s sleep... ugh.. So Jeff went down to the kitchen, a post workout protein shake would be good for him.<br />
<br />
Shaking the powder with the water made his already sore muscles scream which made him happy. On a whim he started a pot of coffee for his parents. He loved the smell yet his taste buds couldn&#39;t handle it, but that didn&#39;t stop him from trying every now and then. <br />
<br />
He chugged the shake as fast as he could, occasionally gagging. He did his research into nutrition and learned that even though all protein shakes are marketed as healthy, some are loaded with sugar and contribute to insulin spikes and fat gain. he begged his parents for this brand of shake, having the lowest carbohydrates.... and gagged every time he drank it. But it seemed to be working, he was up to 185 and still lean.<br />
<br />
By 5:25 Jeff heard the master bathroom and assumed it was his mom getting ready, she needs to be at work by 7 and her bathroom routine is longer. Dad will be up and moving in the next 15 minutes or so, so Jeff grabbed his clothes for the day and went to the bathroom to prepare for his shower. He looked at his stubble proudly, not yet an average man&#39;s growth but by the time he reaches 18 he is sure he will need to shave daily. Since he had time to kill before dad got up, he shaved and then masturbated to the thought of him being a strong and powerful man one day. <br />
<br />
He had a fantasy of himself hiding his finely sculpted body in a suit and sharing the fruits of his intense labor with... someone. His mind clouded as he came aiming his shaft into the toilet. He barely stifled his grunt into a series of weird moans, he listened carefully for any indication that his parents heard him, but heard nothing out of the ordinary.<br />
<br />
He began his shower, not feeling rushed he let the warm waters wash over him and when he got out it was 6:10. The time he would normally be coming downstairs to have breakfast. He dried off and dressed, relatively on time. He exited being drawn to the kitchen smelling food and the aroma of the coffee he made.<br />
<br />
He found his dad making some scrambled eggs with cheese. &quot;Where&#39;s Mom?&quot; Jeff asked confused that she was nowhere to be seen.<br />
<br />
&quot;She has an early meeting to prepare for so she had to run. She says thanks for making the coffee this morning, it gave her an extra 10 minutes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff looked at the pot, half empty, and gathered she grabbed a travel mug to start her day. Jeff poured himself a cup seeing it as a rite of passage from boyhood to manhood. Somehow, stomaching gross things like coffee, beer, wine, and liquor is adult. Sweet things like juice and candy, are childish. Maybe that isn&#39;t accurate but it seems to be how things work, at least from Jeff&#39;s perspective. So he keeps trying black coffee and keeps grimacing. Cream and sugar are cheating.<br />
<br />
Dad pulled out two plates and split the 8 eggs evenly. He placed the plate in front of Jeff and smirked at his coffee cup. He was the same way as a child and was glad Jeff inherited his tenacity, even if applied in strange ways. By 6:40 they had eaten and Jeff was absolutely stuffed after the protein shake and eggs, but he knew he would be hungry again by 9 so he started grabbing snacks after cleaning up the dishes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Jeff, I&#39;m gonna head out early too, got a project at work I want to focus on before interruptions come. Will you be okay to catch the bus?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah dad. I&#39;m on schedule.&quot; Jeff said taking a sip from the coffee now that it cooled down to a bearable temperature... and making a face.<br />
<br />
Dad chuckled moving toward the front door. Like a lightning bolt, Jeff had that urge again but this time it was clear what he needed. &quot;Hey dad, hold up, I want a hug.&quot; Jeff called getting up from his chair. This was uncommon for them, they communicated affection in words and gestures, like the eggs and saying that making the coffee was appreciated.<br />
<br />
Jeff went to his dad and wrapped his arms around him gently squeezing. It felt good, It felt real good. Dads hands rubbed Jeff&#39;s back, and Jeff inhaled dad&#39;s deodorant and shaving cream. It was intoxicating but over just as it started. Dad pecked Jeff on the cheek and pulled away saying, &quot;I love you hun, gotta go, you might want to shave before class.&quot;<br />
<br />
They seldom hug and never kiss, and dad once called Jeff sport, but &quot;hun&quot; was reserved for his mom... it must have been son, and Jeff misheard. Jeff was still in a stupor from his dad&#39;s aroma not realizing he had an erection. as Dad opened the door, he turned back and said with a chuckle, &quot;School, I have no idea where that came from, I&#39;ll do you tonight Stud. Love you, bye.&quot; and with that he was gone.<br />
<br />
Jeff was left standing there in shock, everything felt strange but somehow normal. He was drawn to the window to watch as his dad left. His dad pulled out of the driveway and Jeff noticed his hair was much darker than usual. <br />
<br />
Jeff began thinking about what just happened and didn&#39;t understand. Sure it sounded very sexual but this was his dad, there had to be an explanation, so he skipped over the parts that he didn&#39;t understand and focused on the things that had a meaning he could at least try to interpret. &quot;He said I needed to shave maybe I missed a spot?&quot; Jeff thought to himself admitting that it would be embarrassing.<br />
<br />
He went back to the bathroom and upon flipping on the light his heart began to race. instead of a lean 185 lb teen boy he saw a full grown muscular man in his late 20&#39;s. Jeff&#39;s mind raced and his cock hardened. &quot;ugh..&quot; escaped his mouth and it was 3-4 octaves lower than what he was used to. His cock twitched, rubbing the fabric of his athletic shorts and he came right there and then. He did need to shave, and he would look fucking amazing in a suit... &quot;NOT THE TIME&quot; he yelled at himself.<br />
<br />
The pieces of the puzzle were falling into place and falling out again, this explain&#39;s dad&#39;s comment about shaving and school, but why was he hitting on me? I don&#39;t have to go to school, I&#39;m legal! But now I need a job. But I look great, But my dad wants to do me tonight.<br />
<br />
Jeff put together that something made him and his dad more compatible for one another, aging him and de-aging his dad. Thinking of him immediately conjured an image of his late 30 something year old father and he had a bit of a hard time imagining him older. The thought of his dad coming home tonight actually made him feel excited, or giddy, and that made him thoroughly disgusted even as something in his butt seemed to like the idea.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is insane!&quot; Jeff said to the mirror. He realized his brain was going in circles and he needed help, an urge drew his thoughts to the front door, and Jeff realized he needed his best, most trustworthy friend, Michael, who would be at the bus stop after his.<br />
<br />
He grabbed some toilet paper to clean off his dick and then ran out the door to Michael&#39;s bus stop. It was 6:55, the bus is expected in 5 minutes, and Michael wasn&#39;t there yet. &quot;Shit!&quot; Jeff bellowed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Is everything alright?&quot; A child&#39;s voice asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Aw jeez kid, you caught me off guard.&quot; Jeff said as he spun around to the bushes the boy came out of.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, the leaves block the wind and cold mist in early autumn. Midday is hot and we only change clothes at gym.&quot; the child explained.<br />
<br />
Jeff looked carefully and realized it had to be Michael, &quot;Oh, shit!&quot; Jeff exclaimed with genuine terror. &quot;I barely remember you, so you won&#39;t remember me at all!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would we remember each-other?&quot; Michael asked cautiously keeping his distance from the weird raving man.<br />
<br />
&quot;This will sound insane. It IS insane but you&#39;re my best friend.&quot; Jeff pleaded<br />
<br />
Michael took a step back.<br />
<br />
&quot;This morning I was your age, and when I hugged my dad I just, grew up. And now he thinks we are gay, and I don&#39;t know how to fix it. You have always been the smart one. I need your help Michael!&quot;<br />
<br />
The roar of the school bus engine echoed from several blocks away, time was quickly running out. &quot;Prove we&#39;er friends. What do you know about me that some weird neighbor doesn&#39;t?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff searched his memories finding it harder and harder to think of Michael as anything but a random kid in the neighborhood. &quot;Umm, we were really close, I know that. Umm.. shit I can&#39;t remember. We talked... We... We touched eachother!&quot; Jeff exclaimed triumphantly...<br />
<br />
&quot;No. We didn&#39;t, at least not as far as I recall.&quot; the bus was roaring down the street and with Jeff not being a school aged kid anymore, there was one less stop to make.<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s face fell. Of course shared memories wouldn&#39;t prove it. &quot;You think you&#39;re gay! or maybe bi. As of yesterday after class you and I were the only ones who knew!&quot;<br />
<br />
The sentence seemed to slap Michael across the face. &quot;You can&#39;t tell anyone!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I would never&quot; Jeff said shocked and hurt.<br />
<br />
Michael gave a cautious glance, &quot;So you want me to believe that you are my best friend, and you magically turned into a gay adult when you hugged your dad. Were you gay to begin with?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes that&#39;s what I&#39;m saying. No I wasn&#39;t gay. But I think I&#39;m partially gay now?&quot; Jeff answered trying to help.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Michael continued, &quot;If you were my friend, I&#39;d tell you that it doesn&#39;t sound like a doctor can help you unless you are as crazy as you sound. Assuming you are sane, you must have pissed off karma or something and if you want to fix this you had better do it fast.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff then put it together, &quot;The jar!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What jar?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;The jar from that lotion store on the way home from school.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The Ointment Store?&quot; Michael corrected.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, we stopped by and I stole a jar of stuff.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you should give it back, and make amends for the theft.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I already used it all.&quot; Jeff said sadly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, pay for it, apologize, and offer to make up for it somehow. Then beg for help undoing whatever this is.&quot; Michael made a gesture to refer to Jeff&#39;s whole body.<br />
<br />
The bus stopped at Michael&#39;s stop and Michael plodded toward the door as it swung open.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait! You can&#39;t go, you&#39;ve got to help me!&quot; Jeff reached out and grabbed Michael&#39;s arm wrapping his whole hand around Michael&#39;s bicep.<br />
<br />
Jeff watched as the contact immediately made Michael begin to grow. &quot;No, baby, I&#39;ve got to get to class. I can&#39;t go shopping with you but I wish I could.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s grip loosened as Michael&#39;s arm grew larger. Michael looked 16 and hit a growth spurt. Jeff&#39;s grip slipped down Michael&#39;s lengthening forearm and finally to his wrist. Michael looked to be around 17 now. Finally they held hands for a brief second. Michael turned to face Jeff, a blonde goatee adorned his face, &quot;Babe, I need to...&quot; <br />
<br />
His book bag shimmered out of existence, the school bus door closed and the bus began to drive away, Michael continued to bulk up, &quot;wrap you in my arms.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jeff was relieved Michael would be able to stay with him, there were kids on the bus calling them &quot;queers&quot; and &quot;faggots&quot; but that didn&#39;t bother Jeff, the only opinion that mattered was his boyfriend&#39;s. <br />
<br />
The gel continued to work its magic as Jeff wrapped himself in Michael&#39;s arms. After averaging their ages making them both 21, Jeff&#39;s muscles, penis, and stature shrunk drastically making him a wisp of a man. His testosterone levels dropped making his beard growth slow to half of what it was at 15, and raising his voice by 2 octaves. Michael on the other hand bulked up and became everything that Jeffery had been. <br />
<br />
In their new lives Michael is an Actor, and with his physique he is a shoo in for action hero roles. Jeff works at Starbucks and provides steady income where Michael provides amazing but sporadic income.<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s father was never in a relationship with him. Both of their parents support them and love them despite it having been awkward when the couple initially came out.</p>
