<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Do you wanna touch them?” Nova said, randomly.<br />
Nobody has said anything for around a minute, Dylan went bright red again, “Huh!?” She yelped,<br />
“You know...” she said, smirking because she knew he was being awkward, “I just got big boobs, and I’m asking you to touch them...” she tried to hide her smirk, “you can grab them... you can squeeze them... you can-”<br />
“Kelly is in the room!!” Dylan shouted, a reason he found off the top of his head.<br />
Nova looked over at Kelly, “you wouldn’t mind, would you?” She looked him dead in the eyes and gave him a death stare, as if he said no she would murder him.<br />
He shook his head, suddenly.<br />
“Kelly is okay with it...” she said, “so do you want to do it?” She moved her boobs closer to him. He couldn’t look anywhere without seeing them. He went more and more red before finally speaking,<br />
“No!” She said, suddenly, “I don’t wanna touch your boobs,” Nova looked at him. Her face changed, she looked upset. That exact kind of upset a girl would give if a boy were to say ‘No’ to touching her boobs. She turned around grumpily, she tried to cross her arms but she couldn’t find a comfortable position without squishing her boobs, “I-it’s not that I don’t want to touch them... it’s just that... right now... I just don’t want to...”<br />
<br />
That was when Nova had an idea.<br />
<br />
“You wouldn’t ever lie to me, would you?” She said, not looking at him.<br />
“What!?”<br />
“You heard me... you’re not lying, are you?”<br />
“Uhh...” Dylan looked over at Kelly for reassurance, Kelly shrugged, he was more confused than Dylan, certainly more uncomfortable, “no I’m not lying. And I don’t lie to you, ever.” He tried to be slightly sweet.<br />
“Good,” she said, quickly spinning herself along the bed, causing her boobs to jiggle which made him blush again, “then this wish will definitely be a waste,” she smirked,<br />
“Huh?” Dylan responded, as confused as Kelly,<br />
“Kelly,” Nova faces him, “I wish that whenever I ask Dylan a question, if I snap my fingers, he’ll tell me the exact truth.” She smirked, looking at Kelly. His eyes went wide open, shocked, “what?” She said, “he said he was one hundred percent honest, so what’s the problem here?”<br />
“H-he...” Kelly said, looking back and forth between the wide eyed Dylan and the devilish smile of Nova, “a-are... you absolutely sure you want to make that wish?”<br />
“Why shouldn’t I?”<br />
“W-well... maybe he has secrets that... that he doesn’t want other people knowing,”<br />
“I am NOT other people!” Nova said, defensive, “I am his girlfriend, it works differently. It’s not like you’d know.”<br />
“W-what did-”<br />
“Kelly,” Dylan interrupted him, “grant the wish,”<br />
“B-but...”<br />
“Just do it,” <br />
<br />
“What is going on?” Nova said, looking at both boys, she saw Kelly’s hands begin to glow. She watched as Kelly closed his eyes, took a breath and pointed his hands at Dylan.<br />
Dylan glowed a golden glow, just like Nova did. The glow faded away, this time nothing changed. Not physically.<br />
<br />
“Well,” Nova said, “now that this drama is over. Dylan, do you want to touch my boobs?” She snapped her fingers,<br />
<br />
All of a sudden, without thinking, Dylan said, “yes, I really want to touch them,” His hand whipped up to cover his mouth.<br />
“I knew it,” she said, “now...”<br />
“Can you make your last wish then...” Dylan said,<br />
“Well well well...” she said, “you seem pretty eager, but I’m asking more questions,”<br />
Kelly was looking more nervous than Dylan at this point.<br />
“Who is your biggest crush at school?” She snapped her fingers. Dylan was looking nervous, Kelly getting even more <br />
nervous.<br />
<br />
“Nova Goodwin,” he said,<br />
<br />
Nova, for some reason was expecting to hear a different name, probably the big boob bitch Cindi Newman. The she remembered how big her boobs were now. Despite this, she blushed slightly.<br />
Kelly would’ve wiped a sweat off his forehead if he could sweat, but it seemed like Genies didn’t.<br />
“Well that...” she couldn’t think of anything else, “how about...” she tried to think of another question, “aha!” She thought of something, “what do you think of my boobs?” Dylan went red again. She snapped her fingers.<br />
“Yes, I really like them.” He paused, as if he was forcing himself not to speak, but he suddenly blurted out, “but they could be bigger.” <br />
“Oh ho ho!!” Nova laughed at him, “so you do like them bigger!” She smirked. He was now seriously embarrassed.<br />
<br />
“Okay. Just one more,” Nova said, “let me think...” she tried to think of one, then it popped into her head,<br />
“Have you kissed anyone before, and if you have, who?”<br />
<br />
Kelly’s eyes went wide, even Nova noticed his reaction, she looked at him confused. She snapped her fingers.<br />
<br />
“Yes.” Dylan said,<br />
“No way!” She said, “you told me you’d never kissed anyone before, when did...” she stopped as she looked at him. This time he was really holding in on the next part. “It can’t be that bad, can it,” Nova looked at Kelly and asked him, sarcastically.<br />
Dylan couldn’t hold it any longer, his mouth opened and he said it,<br />
<br />
“The last person I kissed was-” he held it in, he tried to hard,<br />
<br />
<br />
“Kelly Steele!” He shouted, <br />
<br />
<br />
Nova’s eyes went as wide as Kelly’s.<br />
<br />
“Kelly!? Really!?” She looked at Kelly, then back to Dylan, then back to Kelly, “holy shit...” she fell backwards on his bed. Dylan rushed up and ran out of the room, down the hall to the bathroom, he locked the door shut. <br />
<br />
“Great job, Nova,” Kelly said,<br />
“You!?” She sat back up suddenly, “he’s straight! You mean my boyfriend’s gay!?”<br />
“He...” Kelly stopped, he thought before spoke, “he isn’t gay. I am,”<br />
“Y-you mean... he...” she couldn’t think straight,<br />
<br />
“Okay... well you’ve done a great job of ruining a lot of things.” Kelly said, “a few months ago I came out to Dylan and then one thing led to another and he grabbed me and kissed me. We made out for ages. That’s why it shocked me that you two were dating.”<br />
“But...”<br />
“We hadn’t kissed in about a month. He always had a crush on you, you know.”<br />
<br />
“Okay...” Nova went quiet for a second, nobody said anything, “shit... shit shit SHIT!” She began to panic, “I have to fix this... what can I do to make it up to him... I will literally do anything I realise how much of asshole I am!”</p>
