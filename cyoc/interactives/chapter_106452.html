<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Authors note: A belated congratulations on breaking past 300 chapters.<br />
<br />
The Stovall’s were enjoying the storm induced power outage by playing several board games. After playing several rounds of boggle and Yahtzee; the Stovall’s settled in on Trivial Pursuit. While Julie wasn’t as knowledgeable in the questions as her parents; she could not deny that all three where having a wonderful time together, for the first time in years.<br />
<br />
While Martin, Melissa and Julie knew that this was only a momentary distraction to the problems they faced; all three chose to embrace the moment of the evening and enjoy some family time. The laughter from Martin was pure and jovial; not the kind he force of late as a way to deal with stress. Melissa for a brief moment could not remember a time where the family was not stressed and pushed to the breaking point. Julie was for once, did not have revenge of Eric and Frieda on the back of her mind. For while she was receptive to family therapy as a way to repair their strained relationship; Julie only agreed to do it for her own sinister ambitions.<br />
<br />
Since her assault of Eric and Frieda during Tuesday’s freshman lunch period, Julie has thought of nothing but finding a way to break house arrest and sneak off to enact her perverted sense of justice. While she can no longer change Eric into a were-mer thanks to Frieda’s efforts; she figures that while were’s have a faster than normal rate for healing; Julie figures that if she could maim either in some fashion it would go towards getting some measure of justice. If she could get Brian Walker and give him his due; she would be even happier.<br />
<br />
Conning her mother to convince dad to lift the no internet was the first step in her plan; the storm knocking out the power did set her back some but she knew that with her father out tomorrow for a council meeting she had all day to research how to deceive ankle monitors. While her mother did say that her father would monitor her internet usage; Julie did knew a thing or two in hiding what she did on the internet. Using proxy servers, she was able to hide her past visits to various sex sites. She had to stop visiting them when her mother got suspicious when viewing past credit card statements; naturally she blamed Martin but he vehemently denied visiting them. Julie decided it was best to not keep going to those pay per view sites. If her research did not find a solution to either trick or disable the electronic shackle on her ankle; then she hoped the judge she would have to see on Wednesday would be lenient and have the monitor removed or its restrictions loosened.<br />
<br />
Julie for the time being just pretended to play along with the family; while she knows that Frances expects her to write a letter of apology to her parents by the next therapy session and a separate letter to Eric; she had no intention of doing the second bit. Confident that she can con Frances Twist in playing the ‘I never got to it with what all this school work that was dropped off’ card. Julie figures that should buy herself a few days from that task. Her plan was to be out and free before then; she smiles inwardly all the while laughing and joking with her parents as they begin forgoing the game’s rules and trying to stump each other by asking the question while badly impersonating a famous person.<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
Benton was finally calming down after the edict he received from the were-council. Blubbering to Amanda that they were socially ruined and possibly pariahs with the town itself; Amanda didn’t have the heart to compound to his issues in regards to the servants all walking out in protest to Benton knocking out their Butler Jeffery. Yet she knew Benton would find out eventually.  So she reluctantly told him that during his earlier anger induced rage, which he struck down Jeffery without cause. <br />
<br />
Upon hearing that bit of news, Benton nearly collapses in his wife’s arm. Knowing full well that he can’t blame anyone but himself for that; Benton realizes he has to swallow his pride and find a way to make amends in some fashion. He knew that the servants will never come back and that hiring new staff would be difficult due to his now public outburst at Tachibana headquarters.<br />
<br />
Benton looks at the scroll again and is about to destroy it when Amanda stops him; “I know you don’t want to look at this and want it gone.” Amanda gently taking the parchment from him; “but Frieda should look at this. She needs to know what will soon be instore for her.” Amanda pockets the scroll; “were-council wise and all that.”<br />
“Fine,” Benton softly responds. “We’ll talk to her in the morning;” Benton gets up. While still wobbly from the alcohol he drank earlier; he is able to take small steps; naked, his member bouncing freely and unrestrained with each step he took.<br />
<br />
They both walk to their bedroom. On the way they look into Frieda’s room to see her fast asleep. As Amanda gently closes the door and both head to bed, Benton speaks; “Frieda was right in one thing;” Benton looking at his wife. “We did treat the servants horribly. We owe it to admit her that.”<br />
<br />
Amanda doesn’t answer. They both enter the master bedroom to survey the damage Benton did here and in his dressing room. While most of the damage was contained in Benton’s Study and dressing room; several expensive vases and some of Amanda’s crystal trinkets did suffer from Benton’s rage.<br />
<br />
“Tomorrow after we both drop Frieda off to school, we will need to pick up brooms, dust pans and garbage bags;” Amanda remarks as she removes her clothes and puts on a night gown. “Once that happens; “Amanda pointing at Benton, “you will be cleaning all this up.”<br />
<br />
Amanda proceeds to go to bed, while Benton just stares at the carnage he caused. Slowly he also enters under the covers and turns off the lights. Lying awake all he could think about was the threat Tachibana levied against him; ‘If you so much as do anything to the Lawson or the Andersons, you will find yourself at war with the Skulk.’ Knowing that Tachibana was not making an idle threat he drifts off into a fitful sleep; the sound of the rain beating on the windows and thunder booming in the distance.<br />
<br />
****<br />
<br />
Nate was doing his best to sleep in his bed; naked and under his covers. But with his room next to his parents; he is forced to listen to their love making. Unable to fall asleep, even to the sound of the rain fall he grabs a blanket and decides to crash on the living room sofa. Taking his phone with him he notices a message come through from Liv;<br />
<br />
‘If the rain lets up, lets meet up by the north side of the lake tomorrow. Bring a tent a change of clothes and nothing else. I’ll bring the snacks and [sly face emoticon] toys. [wink emoticon]’<br />
<br />
Nate smiles; an erection starting to rise at the thought of wild animal sex dance in his head. texting a simple acknowledgement he flops on the sofa as he shifts into his werewolf fursona and lets the blanket drape over his lower extremities. He quickly drifts off to sleep to the sound of the rain and delightful thoughts of a potential weekend sex fest. His werewolf rocket at full mast creating a noticeable tenting with the blanket covering it.</p>
