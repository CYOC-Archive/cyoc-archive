<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Can we get you anything, Amethyst?&quot; Emerald asked as those that were outside tried to recover from the exhaustive nature of the dance.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm fine,&quot; Amethyst answered, &quot;I just need to rest for a bit. While I am glad that you are all flesh and blood again, and that Kurse is gone forever, our muscles will tire after awhile.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I don't understand it, we can run for miles without tiring,&quot; Emerald spoke, &quot;shoot, Alpha Female chased Sunny and Luna about the manor and the grounds for the good part of a day after she caught them flirting with Jensen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but running and chasing things is how our muscles are designed to work,&quot; Amethyst explained, &quot;the dance has us do a lot of things that biology didn't intend for us to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Humans don't do that...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes they do,&quot; Amethyst countered, &quot;Look at major sporting events, particularly ones that require one to crouch. Catchers, offensive and defensive linemen, fullbacks, they are positions that humans can take, but not one they were designed to take... and in football, you also have to take into account all the hits they take. No knee bends sideways&quot;<br />
<br />
Emerald silently wondered how Amethyst could pant, smile, and explain things all at once, but amethyst colored she-wolf managed to do so.<br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;With no school or lessons to be done, it's nice to have everyone outside,&quot; Ryan commented, &quot;Fresh air, bright sunshine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes dears,&quot; Martha answered as she held the hands of each of her males and with Whitney as well, &quot;it is nice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Where are Alice and her sisters?&quot; Whitney wondered, &quot;they didn't follow us after breakfast.<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably went after their sister,&quot; Abdul commented, &quot;Alice, Abbey, and Samantha may not be like their mothers... but they are close and rarely if ever go separate ways.&quot;<br />
<br />
The other omegas nodded.<br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Your mind is struggling with things,&quot; Gillie heard a voice speak just as she reached a door to the Pack's back yard, as he search for these cubs inside the manor had met with failure, so they had to be outside.<br />
<br />
Gillie then turned to see Amy standing in an intersecting hallway with a pale pink pup beside her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chief Gillie, this is my half brother Zelipe,&quot; Amy spoke as she gestured to the male pup, &quot;we were just going out to see how our friends our doing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi,&quot; Zelipe said weakly from beside his sister.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello,&quot; Gillie answered back, &quot;I don't suppose you would mind going ahead while I talk with sister for a bit?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She's not in trouble is she?&quot; Zelipe asked, noticing the badge hanging between Gillie's breasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Gillie shook her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go on, brother,&quot; Amy urged, &quot;I'll be out in a bit.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zelipe nodded and went out the door leaving the two alone in the entryway.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what troubles you?&quot; Amy asked once the door shut.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everything,&quot; Gillie sighed, &quot;I don't know how you know of my curse, but it is something that will forever haunt me I think. As far as reality is concerned, I and most of my officers have always been lion-people, you and a good portion of Glendale have always been wolf-people and things have changed drastically.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not all changes are bad,&quot; Amy commented, &quot;through the social bonds of the Pack and the Pride the families of each are now closer with each other and even closer with those who they were not friendly with in the previous reality. Is it truly that wrong to have everyone get along?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is when it's cheating,&quot; Gillie answered, &quot;these super-families were all caused by the game... not through the hard work it takes to actually form friendships. Now, since I know I can't stop it, I'm not going to try. Like trying to break a brick wall without a sledgehammer. All you'd do is hurt yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can accept the changes in reality,&quot; Gillie admitted, &quot;I've had to do so for years. But some of it, is just difficult to get. If reality is trying to fix itself after Kurse's death and Jensen's stupidity, I would assume it would take the path of least resistance. Reality isn't some sentient being that can choose its path.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, it is not,&quot; Amy agreed.<br />
<br />
&quot;And while I'm certain I can adapt to the changes done to my officers, even with Frank and Daryl now being twin sisters and mothers besides...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Triplets,&quot; Amy corrected, &quot;Julie, Fran, and Darla are identical triplets... who look the same, act the same, might as well BE the same.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gillie sighed, &quot;whatever. I can adapt to that... but on visiting my officers, I overheard something that's totally thrown me a loop... Gary said something to Penny about her taking his cubs away. Now, the Pride was only just formed... and Bobbi was the only &quot;woman&quot; that joined it. There is no way that romantic relations could have formed between Gary and Elise and Fox, and certainly not for one of them to have been pregnant...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In the old reality,&quot; Amy sighed, guessing that she would have to let the &quot;lion&quot; out of the bag as it where.<br />
<br />
&quot;First of all, remember that lions, both unevolved and Leomen are polygamous by nature,&quot; Amy began, &quot;in the new reality, Elise mated with Brian while Felicity was still pregnant with Mary and Fox took Gary as her Prime Mate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But what could have set that off?&quot; Gillie growled, &quot;that isn't the path of least resistance.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The battle with Kurse,&quot; Amy sighed, &quot;she had Paul, Trever, and I against the ropes. I do not believe she could have won, but it looked as though one or more of us would die fighting her. Fox and Elise, meanwhile on the island made a direct challenge to Kurse from an alter that Kurse had set up for her creations there to worship her from.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gillie shuddered.<br />
<br />
&quot;In the curse world, Kurse responded to their challenge by throwing a child-like temper tantrum, splitting Fox and Elise into four separate entities of child age, slightly younger then Mary,&quot; Amy spoke, &quot;which gave me the opportunity to hit Kurse in the chest with an arrow which ushered in her &quot;slow death&quot;. A second bolt through the eye finished her off before Trevor broke the neck of the familiar Herodias insuring that the curse's &quot;brain&quot; would be dead forever.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So Kurse never killed Fox or Elise,&quot; Gillie spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not in the way one would think,&quot; Amy spoke, &quot;while Kurse's death in the short term restored Fox and Elise... the fact that they had let Kurse in and that Kurse put all of her attention into mutating them, each of the four beings they were gained very independent personalities, personalities that could not easily survive inside an individual being.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gillie began to feel sick.<br />
<br />
&quot;They then transform or dared each other into four separate Leoman cubs in order to insure that each personality wouldn't be squabbling with another inside a single being,&quot; Amy finished, &quot;Elise became Moja, Mbili, Tatuli, and Nneli. Fox became Tano, Sita, Saba, and Nane.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So they ended up becoming their own children?&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy nodded, &quot;but reality has finished altering around them now. As far as they and the pride are concerned their mothers sacrificed themselves to enable Father Paul, Trevor, and myself to finish off Kurse.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gillie only sighed, fighting the urge to throw up or do something to vent her anger inside someone else's home, &quot;at least it explains how they all came about.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And the end of the misery this curse causes,&quot; Amy nodded, &quot;even if future changes are not to your liking, what comes will be beautiful...&quot;<br />
<br />
And with that, Amy bowed and went out the door. Gillie only sighed and then followed.<br />
<br />
She found a rather large collection of Lupman outside. Mostly teenagers and pups, but there were a few adults. Kaylee and four pups, three reddish brown like their mother, one black like her father were close to the house taking a water bucket to water flowers in the garden along the house. Zelipe and Amy were close by as well.<br />
<br />
Three mutant male Lupman and two mutant female Lupman were observing several pairs of twin Lupman pups relax or talk with each other. Several teenage Lupman were doing much the same, while one appeared to be conversing with a sparkling purple she-wolf who was relaxed under a tree.<br />
<br />
It was then that she noticed the nine cubs. They had all piled on top of a purple furred teen Lupman male and were in the process of hugging and rubbing their heads against him. She could tell that they were all in some stage of grief, but seemed to be close with the Lupman male, who was doing what he could to comfort them. Sighing again, Gillie took a few steps toward them.&quot;</p>
