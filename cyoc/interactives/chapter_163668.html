<br />
Thankfully, I woke up on my own bed. My eyes shot open when I heard someone furiously banging on our barracks door. Doug begrudgingly rose to his feet, grabbing a pillow and holding it over his morning wood. He was too tired to notice my cum on his chest. It was still wet, and tickled down his abs as he walked. I don’t know why, but I couldn’t take my eyes off him. His huge, muscular body was so arousing to me. Those biceps…<br />
<br />
Fuck, I was getting hard again, and my new member was harder to conceal in those tight shorts. I tried to snap out of it, focusing my mind on other things.<br />
<br />
“What the hell? I’m not gay. I must be horny, that’s all…”<br />
<br />
My mind trailed off. Doug’s ass bounced with every step he took. It was so hypnotising. My hormones were going crazy. I needed to jerk off. I could feel my dick try to escape. I shoved it under the waistline of my shorts, keeping it firmly pressed against my chest. That was when I saw Doug step back amazedly when he opened the door.<br />
<br />
“L-Lieutenant!”<br />
“You certainly know how to greet your superior.”<br />
<br />
Doug was turning red. He looked down to see my load glisten in the light.<br />
<br />
“Oh, is sorry I….that’s not….Squad, it’s the Lieutenant. Get off your arses and stand to attention!”<br />
<br />
Without any hesitation, we all jumped up from our beds, and stood with our chests puffed out and our heads held high. I noticed Alex was completely naked, and had his hands over his crotch. It felt weird being slightly taller than him. He gave me a confused look, as his eye-line travelled down my body. Watching him stare at my junk only made it throb. I wasn’t going to hold it in. I could feel my balls fill up. I tried to look as normal as possible when the Lieutenant entered our barracks, along with Josh and a few soldiers from 1st Platoon, who wore large gas masks that covered their entire faces. They giggled when they saw Alex naked, the man shaking with embarrassment.<br />
<br />
Lieutenant Reed was an intimidating man to work for. I always thought they hired the biggest guys to be in charge, and Reed was no exception. His 6’8” frame was always wearing clothes that looked multiple sizes too small for him. They certainly showed off his ripped body. His thighs were the stars of the show. They bulged out of his trousers, and were shrouded in thick muscle. They were so wide, even when he stood with his feet wide apart, they still rubbed together. You could tell when he was pretending to be nice. His fake smile was a dead giveaway. However, all I could look at was the package between his legs. It was so big. I just wanted to reach out and touch it. My cock began leaking precum. I could feel it start to form a wet patch on my vest. As he stepped closer to us, his mouth contorted into a wide smile. I caught Doug checking out Reed’s bubble butt as he spoke.<br />
<br />
“Mornin’ gents. I know for some of you, it’s your day off. There’s no need to be alarmed. We’re just doing a quick sweep of the base. After yesterday’s accident, we wanna make sure there ain’t no smuggling of any sensitive materials.”<br />
“You think we’re stealing?”<br />
<br />
Andy immediately regretted his question, as he was swiftly met with a cold stare from Reed. He gazed upon the small man, before smiling again.<br />
<br />
“My boy, it’s just a precaution. We have reason to believe there is a mole working from the inside. A saboteur, aiming to stop the researcher’s work. It is our job to find him. So, the boys in 1st will conduct a search here, and then we’ll be out of your hair.”<br />
“Is there anything you need us to do Sir?”<br />
“No, just stand there and look pretty.”<br />
<br />
He winked at Andy, who turned bright red. I froze. The vial was in my pillowcase. I wasn’t the mole. I doubt they’d believe me. All I could do was watch helplessly as the soldiers in black immediately began rummaging through our things, turning our beds upside down. There was a crap ton of used tissues under Doug’s bed. Andy’s bed was clean. He hasn’t been here long enough to make a mess of it. They found a bunch of porn under Alex’s bed, who only grew more embarrassed as he tried to cover up more of his naked body. I didn’t mind his nakedness. In fact, I kinda liked it. My bed was the last one to be searched. That was when I heard Reed’s deep voice from behind me.<br />
<br />
“You’re looking good Private. Have you been working out?”<br />
<br />
I felt my forehead glisten with sweat. I tried to sound normal.<br />
<br />
“Yeah. Th-thought I’d bulk up.”<br />
“I don’t remember you being this big yesterday.”<br />
<br />
My mind was racing, desperately trying to come up with something, anything to say. I just stayed silent, panic-stricken, as one of the boys from 1st reached under my mattress. Reed spoke again, almost whispering into my ear.<br />
<br />
“Meet me at my office later. I can show you some workout tips.”<br />
<br />
Then, without any warning, he boisterously slapped my ass. I knew he was smiling. I knew it wasn’t fake. I was so scared, but feeling him behind me drove my hormones wild. I gulped when I saw Connor’s hand slowly reach into my pillowcase. I accepted my fate, breathing in and closing my eyes.<br />
<br />
Then, the sirens blasted, and quick flashes of yellow flooded the barracks. Reed sighed.<br />
<br />
“1st, you’re with me. Everyone else stay here.”<br />
<br />
The Lieutenant and his soldiers briskly exited the barracks. We all immediately ran to the window to see what was going on.<br />
<br />
The entire platoon was carrying another exposed researcher to a truck. The man’s shoulders widened, stretching his lab coat. His arms grew around the soldiers’ shoulders, as one of his hands firmly grasped one of their asses. This guy must’ve been more exposed than Archie to the chemical, as he was growing at a much faster rate. 1st Platoon was struggling to heave his increasing weight across the yard. The man’s grunts grew deeper by the second. As his body enlarged, so did his hand that was planted firmly on the solider’s asscheeks, who was now trying to get away. It wasn’t long until the scientist’s clothes tore off completely, revealing his hulking frame of hair and muscle. He towered over them. The giant then picked the poor soldier up like a stuffed doll and tore off his uniform in one go. The naked soldier squirmed in the man’s grasp, crying out for help when his gas mask was removed. The solider’s name was Connor. I didn’t know him too well. For a guy who ate a lot, his body sure was lean. The rest of the Platoon were too busy trying to get them to the truck. Then, with a menacing grin, the overgrown researcher shoved Connor’s head into his hairy armpit.<br />
His muffled voice could still be heard.<br />
“Someone do something! I can’t hold my breathe for much longer!”<br />
“Leave him men! He’s been exposed. Just get them both in the truck!”<br />
“But I…ohhhh fuck!”<br />
<br />
I couldn’t believe what I was witnessing. Connor actually started to get hard, as he rammed more of his nose into the giant man’s body, breathing in as much of his musk as he could. The squad had finally managed to get the man, along with Connor, into the truck. Even from behind the window, there was no doubt in what Connor said next.<br />
<br />
“Ohhh God. Fuck me! OHHHH MY GOD! HARDER! ARGHHH!”<br />
<br />
Connor’s screams and moans didn’t sound fearful anymore. He sounded like he was enjoying it. However, before I could see what they were doing in the truck, it sped off, disappearing in the morning fog. The squad and I watched the entire thing unfold, our jaws dropped and our eyes wide. Doug dropped his pillow in amazement, as his rock-hard member stuck out from his hips.<br />
<br />
“Holy shit! I was right. I was fucking right! Genetic experimentation!”<br />
<br />
We’d never hear the end of it.</p>
