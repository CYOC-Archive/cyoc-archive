<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brittany and Jade blinked their eyes. Something was wrong ... or different?<br />
<br />
Jade didn&#39;t feel shy anymore. She felt more confident, knowing what she wanted and how to get it. But she no longer cared about getting good grades at the university. All she wanted to do was party. Wait a minute, wasn&#39;t that what her older sister Brittany was like?<br />
<br />
Speaking of Brittany, the older sister was really not feeling like herself. She felt insecure. She felt ... shy. Just like her younger sister Jade. Brittany would rather stay in, study, get her grades up. They were only around a C-average right now, and that nearly mortified her. Which was odd, because just moments earlier, she didn&#39;t much care. She cared more about partying. Now, she couldn&#39;t imagine going out to a party (even though she had memories of doing so). Being at a party seemed very awkward to her now.<br />
<br />
The sisters looked at each other, both suddenly realizing what happened. &quot;I have your personality,&quot; they both said at the same time, dropping the strange object to the floor. Their eyes went wide. &quot;You have my personality?&quot; they both said, once again at the same time.<br />
<br />
After a pause, Jade, now the more assertive of the two, spoke up. &quot;This thing. It must have switched our personalities when we both touched it. But everything else is the same.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brittany looked at herself in the mirror. Her curvy 21-year old body looked exactly the same, so how come she didn&#39;t feel sexy? Why was she feeling so insecure about herself? It just didn&#39;t match how she looked, but she couldn&#39;t help how she felt. She just wanted to cover up her body and hide away somewhere.<br />
<br />
Jade, on the other hand, was jealous of her sister&#39;s good looks. She never felt that way before, but now it seemed justified. Brittany had a way hotter body than her. How was she gonna snag guys into having sex with her if she looked like a twig by comparison? That thought made her pause for a moment. Did she just think about having sex? That was something she never really thought of before, as she was usually more interested in schoolwork and not much else. But she knew her sister was like that, before this change. No, Brittany wasn&#39;t a slut, not really. But Jade knew she liked to party, and if the opportunity of sex came up, she wasn&#39;t against it. Well, that personality trait now belonged to Jade. She was now the party girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I borrow some of your clothing?&quot; Jade asked, even though she knew her sister&#39;s clothes might be too loose for her, as Brittany wasn&#39;t as thin as her. &quot;Mine are too plain now. I need to spice up my wardrobe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you serious?&quot; Brittany asked. &quot;We need to figure out how this happened and reverse it. I don&#39;t want to be, um, like this for the rest of my life,&quot; she said, gesturing to herself, referring to how shy and insecure she now was.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can do what you want, but I think the best thing for us to do right now is switch clothes. I know yours won&#39;t fit me quite right, but it&#39;ll be good enough until I can buy some of my own. And in the meantime, you can have my clothes. They&#39;re so plain now, I really don&#39;t want them anymore. You can do whatever you want with them.&quot; And with that, she headed straight to Brittany&#39;s closet and grabbed a bunch of her sister&#39;s sexy outfits, then left the room.<br />
<br />
Brittany looked down at the object that had swapped their personalities. Usually, she&#39;d regard something like that as nothing more than a trinket, but getting down on the floor and examining it, she suddenly felt intrigued by some of the markings around the edges of the metal disk that held the reddish-orange jewel. They almost looked like hieroglyphics, or perhaps runes? That&#39;s odd. How did she know about those sorts of things? After all, she&#39;s not the type of person to sit around thinking about that stuff. Or at least, she wasn&#39;t until now. But she didn&#39;t think she had gained knowledge or anything like that. This new somewhat nerdy Brittany realized that all the knowledge that she had soaked up, either intentionally or accidentally, throughout the years was coming more easily to the forefront of her mind. Simply because she cared about it more. She imagined that her sister was experiencing the opposite, suddenly not caring to know things anymore, unless it was gossip about the relationship status of someone she knew. That made Brittany feel bad. That her sister was so shallow. She blinked for a moment. Was SHE that shallow before the swap?<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I&#39;m going out,&quot; Jade said, standing at Brittany&#39;s bedroom door.<br />
<br />
Brittany, still on the floor next to the object, looked up. Her eyes went wide. Her little sis was wearing one of her halter tops (which looked loose, as it was made for Brittany&#39;s DD-cups, not Jade&#39;s B-cups), a somewhat loose miniskirt, and 4-inch heels (their feet were closer in size than their breasts ... but still, the shoes looked a bit loose).<br />
<br />
&quot;You can&#39;t go out like THAT,&quot; Brittany said. Not only was it not her size, but it looked so ... slutty. Suddenly, she was reminded that those clothes were actually HERS, that Jade was just borrowing them, and she felt a little ill at that thought. She had many memories of dressing that way on a daily basis, and even more-so when she went out partying. It wasn&#39;t until now that Brittany realized how slutty those clothes looked.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you? My mother? I can dress however I like,&quot; Jade said. &quot;Okay, I&#39;m going. I&#39;ll be back later.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then she was gone.<br />
<br />
Brittany scrambled to her feet and tried to stop her, but by the time she got to the front door, her sister was already in her car and driving off.</p>
