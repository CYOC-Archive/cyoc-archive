<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When Steve completed the changes in the lab he grew 6 inches taller. Reaching a height of 6' tall. He became <br />
more muscled developing a set of pecs that were like two large melons tipped by large nipples that stuck <br />
straight out. His arms thickened until his biceps were almost as thick as his former waist of 36 inches. And <br />
his waist became 42 inches but not an ounce of fat was to be seen. He was rock hard. His legs thickened up <br />
till they were like tree trunks. His neck thickened until there wasn't a transition from chest to head. His <br />
hair became dark and curly and he developed a dark beard that looked as if it had been growing for a week. His <br />
biceps sprouted hair from mid bicep all the way down to his knuckles. He had the smoothest back and shoulders <br />
but his chest sprouted dark curly hair with two pointy headlights almost 2 inches in diameter. The treasure <br />
trail went from the cleavage developed from his large pecs down the center of his six pac into his underwear <br />
and out the bottom of his boxers. His legs were furry all the way around and so was his muscular ass cheeks. <br />
This was the major change that came from the initial changes.<br />
<br />
When he stood there arms spread he wore those same boxers and before the audience stood that dark haired man. <br />
His hair was long and curly in the back and short in the front. He had developed a mullet. His eyes had become <br />
deep blue pools and seemed to be as piercing as daggers into the soul. His body was still as furry as ever and <br />
his beard had become long dipping down to the middle of his chest. He looked like he could be a new member of <br />
ZZ-Top. His butt cheeks seemed to have rounded out nicely leaving what could be used as a nice shelf. His pale <br />
skin had become tanned as though he worked outside. But the most noticeable change rose from that 42 inch <br />
waist. He still had that waist but his once six pack had become a full fledged keg. Protruding out a full foot <br />
out in front of his waist and as firm as possible. His pecs now rested on top of what looked like someone that <br />
had spent many years downing gallons of beer after a hard day's work. The wrinkles in his face had been hidden <br />
by they beard and mullet but it looked like he had aged as well.<br />
<br />
He looked out in the audience and saw some women scientists and hooted at them as if he were on the construction site. Grinding his hips as if he were enjoying his new found heterosexual demeanor.<br />
<br />
They took turns coming up and examining the pictures before the transition, the post transition and the <br />
current body of this man. He encouraged the women to touch him but flinched when the men tried to do the same. <br />
For the longest time he let them examine him and when he got ready to go he pulled on his overalls and clipped <br />
the straps, stressed to the end of the strap. He had a heavily stained t-shirt on and headed out.<br />
<br />
The doctor said to be back next week and the next change would be made. Steve headed out the back door and <br />
down the ally. Driving home he stopped off at the bar and sat down at the bar and ordered a pitcher of Bud. <br />
Steve didn't know if he wanted to go back to the old person or go in for the next change. He sat there and <br />
chugged pitcher after pitcher.<br />
<br />
Someone came up behind him and slipped their hands in the gaps on the side of the coveralls and began to <br />
nibble on his ear. In his former life no one had ever been so forward with him. The caressing continued from <br />
his furry chest down to the mound that was now his belly. As he was beginning to feel buzzed he got up up and <br />
too the molester by the hand and said lets go back to my place Bob and get that taken care of. Steve made a <br />
good show of the hetero male construction worker but his sexuality hadn't changed this time. Well at least he <br />
was still gay but quite a bit more dominant than he ever thought he would be.</p>
