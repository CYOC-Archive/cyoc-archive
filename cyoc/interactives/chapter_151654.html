<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lucas, done with the easiest part of his latest masterpiece, looked all around at all the works he&#39;d finished in the past few days since he received the massive box of crayons, looking for for inspiration to finish his drawing. He glanced over piece over piece by piece, thinking about what he could add to make his newest picture worthy of his older brother&#39;s praise. Suddenly, glancing over a picture of a cow he&#39;d drawn, it hit him: wouldn&#39;t his brother look so funny with an udder? With that, he looked for the pink crayon in his box and got to work.<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
Annoyed at my brother&#39;s childishness, I started to head downstairs and back to the tv. As I sat back down on the couch, my stomach let out a loud gurgle. Probably something to do with me having just finished my not-so-good cooking. So, I ignored it and reached down to take my phone out of my pocket so I could get back to texting with my friends.<br />
Glancing down towards my legs though, I realized something didn&#39;t look right. I&#39;m a pretty skinny guy, so even a little bit of swelling on my stomach looks weird, but this was ridiculous. What I had initially thought was just the result of bad food looked like some kind of allergic reaction, all occurring around my stomach. I stood up off the couch, ready to get some medicine, when the feeling really hit me. Not only was my stomach already heavily swollen, it was STILL swelling up, the feeling of stretching skin on my stomach making me uneasy as I started rushing towards my room to take a better look. <br />
Having reached my room, the swelling seemed to accelerate: the growing and stretching feeling expanding across the entirety of what could now be described as mass slowly taking over the whole of my stomach and heading downwards towards my crotch. This wasn&#39;t good. I ran over to the mirror, the mass distracting me on my way with the new weight it seems to have taken on causing it to sway and jiggle slightly as I ran.<br />
When I got to the mirror I lifted my shirt, and to my horror, the growing blob of skin on my stomach was turning a rubbery pink! Not only that, but it had four small bumps on it. I reached down to touch the weird, swollen, pink... thing... hanging off my stomach only to feel a wave of pleasure travel from the blob up my spine as I felt my fingers poke into the soft, fleshy thing now occupying the entirety of lower stomach and upper crotch. Whatever this thing is, it&#39;s SENSITIVE. I quickly took off my clothes so I wouldn&#39;t be incapacitated by the feeling of the cloth rubbing against this thing.<br />
After the buzz of pleasure left my head, I realized the swelling feeling was starting to reside. I looked back down at the pink sack of flesh I was now growing, seeing it&#39;s outward progress visibly slow down. In relief, I watched as the growth come to a full stop, the mass on my stomach having grown to the point where I could now feel its sides with both of my legs, the weight pulling downwards on the skin around it. However, it didn&#39;t take long for one last surprise: suddenly I was knocked to the floor by an overwhelming throbbing pleasure emanating from where the four small bumps had been.<br />
After the pleasure finally subsided, I stood back up, almost falling back to the floor, the new weight between my legs pulling me downwards and catching me off guard. Looking back into the mirror, my mouth fell downwards in shock: I was looking at myself the same as I had been when I woke up this morning, but now with a massive udder growing off of my stomach.<br />
No... no, that couldn&#39;t be right. I hadn&#39;t been sleeping much lately, so I  had to be seeing things, right? To test my theory, I reached down again with both hands to grab at two of the teat-like things it looked like I had. Getting a grasp on two of them, they certainly felt real, and not only did they feel real, they felt good - a duller version of the same throbbing pleasure that had knocked me to the floor moments earlier returning to me. But that couldn&#39;t be real, it was all in my head. And to prove it, I was going to pull them away.<br />
Or at least, I would have if I would have been right.<br />
Instead, as I yanked my right hand backwards, teat still tight in my grip, the dull, pulsating pleasure exploded into the same intense feeling I had received earlier, accompanied by a white stream erupting from the teat. The pleasure was so intense, it sent me hurtling backwards towards my bed, my new udder swishing erratically back and forth, only adding to the pleasure as the soft pink flesh squished against each leg back as I attempted to recover my balance. However, the struggle was useless, as I felt my rear slam against the side of my bed, sending the weight of my udder sailing straight into me.<br />
The pleasure was suddenly interrupted with a crushing pain as the heavy weight of the udder slammed into my stomach and back. I felt like I was going to vomit.<br />
<br />
It took me a few minutes to recover, but finally I had a second of peace where I could take in everything that was going on. Looking down, I took it all in... there was a big, soft, rubbery looking, udder taking up the space in front of my stomach stopping only between my thighs. What the hell was I going to do now? I looked like a freak. Not only that, but how was I supposed to do pretty much anything? I couldn&#39;t put clothes back on now, not only would they not fit, but the cloth rubbing against my udder would probably leave me totally unable to focus on anything. This thing was going to be trouble for walking as well. Even sitting down I felt like I had a bowling ball&#39;s worth of weight added to the front of my stomach, slightly moving around as the udder jiggled around, still settling down after I hit my bed. The fact that I could feel it between my thighs probably wouldn&#39;t help either, it was like someone had somehow lodged a deflated rubber ball between my legs.<br />
Suddenly it hit me that I may have another problem... I couldn&#39;t see my penis underneath my udder, and male cows didn&#39;t exactly have udders.<br />
<br />
However, as I was about to find out if this stupid sack between my legs came with a bonus, I was interrupted by a knock at my door followed by some giggling...</p>
