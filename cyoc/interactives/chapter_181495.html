<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Hey, Aidan, You around?&quot; Came a voice from the apartment entryway.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s Cole!&quot; Aidan whispered urgently in surprise. &quot;We&#39;re supposed to go kayaking this weekend! &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... Yeah man! Just getting dressed...&quot; Aidan called, trying to sound natural.<br />
<br />
Cole dropped his camping bag by the door and closed it behind him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey is it alright if I use your bathroom?... My roommate was showering when I woke up and I was running late so I figured I could just get ready here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s all yours man...&quot; Aidan replied, resisting the urge to mention how little they needed it anymore.<br />
<br />
Cole fished his toiletries out of his bag as well as a change of clothes and sauntered into the bathroom with purpose...<br />
<br />
Aidan looked down at his naked body; his cute, rounded little toes splayed innocently on the floor. Growing feelings of sobriety and embarrassment were seeping into his consciousness as he considered how he must look to everyone else in the world... <br />
<br />
&quot;How does this work?&quot; Aidan asked in a harsh whisper. &quot;Is he gonna think this diaper stuff is normal for us?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate&#39;s face scrunched up in discomfort... &quot;I don&#39;t think so... If he&#39;s anything like you were, he&#39;s gonna laugh his ass off...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit!&quot; Aidan yelled in frustration, hoping Cole hadn&#39;t heard the outburst. &quot;I gotta get some clothes...&quot;<br />
<br />
He instinctively clawed through his dressers and closet storage, frantically looking for anything to cover up with, but it was just loads and loads of identical diapers that he had no use for.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is insane! Why do I have all of these? I can&#39;t even take this one off!&quot; Aidan declared in frustration, grabbing his permanently diapered crotch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe you could take some of Cole&#39;s stuff... It sounded like he left his bag by the door.&quot; Nate suggested, feeling awful for putting Aidan in this predicament. <br />
<br />
Aidan considered the possibility... It wasn&#39;t ideal, Cole would definitely recognize his own clothes, but ANYTHING would be easier to explain than appearing as a goofy, naked, diaper man.<br />
<br />
Aidan crept into the hallway and made his way to the abandoned bag... He could hear the shower running in the bathroom but he didn&#39;t want to take any longer than necessary regardless. He didn&#39;t want to risk getting spotted... Reaching into the bag, he quickly grabbed the first denim and cotton items he came across and raced back to his room. Laying out his score on the bed he saw he had snagged a pair of skater jeans and a graphic tee emblazoned with the faded image of an animated spinach-eating sailor.<br />
<br />
Aidan reached for the jeans first, the whole point of this was to cover up the diapers after all. Holding the waist of the pants open in front of him, he stepped inside with his left leg first, then his right. It was obvious the diapers were going to be a troublesome obstacle to get around. He stuffed and massaged the diaper down as much as he could, secretly loving the sensations... Eventually he was able to tease everything into place and fastened the button with triumph.<br />
<br />
He looked at himself in the mirror to see how complete the illusion was and was dismayed by what he saw. His waist bulged out comically, obviously betraying the fact that he was wearing a layer of heavy padding underneath...<br />
<br />
&quot;The shirt might help cover it up more.&quot; Nate suggested helpfully.<br />
<br />
 Aidan quickly wrestled the shirt over his head and arms and drew it down as far as he could, trying to hide the unsightly paunch. He twisted himself from side to side, taking in the view of his lumpy bottom, bulging sides and poofy crotch. The jeans seamed to amplify the crinkling diaper noises as Aidan flexed about... It was hopeless... He looked completely unnatural. The clothes didn&#39;t seem to be the issue. From what he could tell, it didn&#39;t even look like any other type of clothes would look any better... Nothing short of snow pants and a winter jacket.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess it&#39;s better than nothing.&quot; Aidan said with a sigh, sounding dejected. He turned to face Nate, presenting his disguise.<br />
<br />
Aidan suddenly felt a rush of cool air, and the sensation of little padded corners rolling down his front. Looking down he saw he was standing naked again, and there was a pair of identical diapers lying mockingly at his feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck!&quot; He shouted in despair. &quot;That&#39;s why all our stuff turned into diapers... Not so we have SOMETHING to wear, it&#39;s so we have NOTHING to wear!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re right.&quot; Nate said, nodding his head in agreement. &quot;Any clothes we own or try to use to cover ourselves will probably turn into diapers...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What am I going to do?&quot; Aidan pleaded desperately. &quot;How did this even happen? Can you change us back?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; Nate admitted defensively. &quot;I called a number... Dial a Change... It didn&#39;t turn out like I wanted... I mean...&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate trailed off into silence, seemingly lost in thought. He was about to say he only wanted the changes to be positive, but the embarrassment of being trapped in diapers WAS part of the appeal. It didn&#39;t make sense when he thought about it, but even though he hated the humiliation, he also didn&#39;t want it to go away...<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever&quot; Aidan said, growing impatient. &quot;Can you call them back and make it stop?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot; Nate replied quietly, hanging his head.<br />
<br />
He snuck back out into the living room and grabbed his phone off the arm rest. He called up the number from his call history and listened to the hopeful ringing, until the automated phone system accepted the call. He enabled speaker-phone so Aidan could listen in...<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for calling Dial-A-Change. We&#39;re happy to serve you. We are currently closed. Please call back during normal business hours. If this is an emergency please dial 911.&quot;<br />
<br />
The line disconnected and the call was dropped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Shit. Business hours? That means we&#39;re out of luck until Monday...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But, Memorial Day weekend...&quot; Nate reminded gently.<br />
<br />
&quot;God... Three days...&quot; Aidan said daunted by the revelation. &quot;I&#39;ll just have to cancel my plans.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot; Nate said, brightening up. &quot;We&#39;ll just stay in for a few days and fool around... This won&#39;t be so bad. It could be really great!&quot;<br />
<br />
Aidan sighed in resignation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... It does sound pretty awesome... And, just for the weekend...&quot; Aidan said, looking down at Nate&#39;s chunky, cottony rump... wanting nothing more than to take a great big bite of it as if it were an apple and pull at it savagely with his teeth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright.&quot; Aidan said at last, feeling a sudden thrill and relief. &quot;Lets do it!... I only feel bad for having to cancel with Cole...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe you don&#39;t have to cancel, exactly...&quot; Nate said suggestively.</p>
