<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Before the sun finally set, Douglas was busy making some supper for Darrell as the little tyke was watching cartoons; Joan who helped operate the remote for Darrell; she was already in her were-tigress fursona. Feeling the urge to let her inner animal come out as she purrs and growls; smelling the fish that Douglas has grilling on the stove was driving her mad with hunger.<br />
“That smells good,” Joan speaking.<br />
“I’m just finishing it up,” Douglas answering; “Darrell, come get your cheesy noodles.”<br />
“Cheesy Noodles,” Darrell bounds from infront of the tv and heads to the kitchen table.<br />
<br />
As Darrell sits down chanting ‘cheesy noodles’ over and over; Douglas smiles as he disrobes and shifts into his were-grizzly fursona. Taking the pot of macaroni and cheese and spooning out a modest portion for the young tyke; Darrell sees Douglas all furry and beams; “Uncle Yogi!”<br />
“Uncle Douglas,” Douglas correcting Darrell; “and this is no picnic basket. But,” Douglas smiling from his ursine muzzle as he put the pot of noodles on the table; “this pot has seconds if you want more.”<br />
<br />
Joan taking the fish that was cooking on the stove and putting them on plates along with the grilled vegetables that Douglas also made; walking to the table, her tail swishing as she places the plates infront of Douglas and herself. She licks her lips as she looks at the gutted rainbow trout staring back at her.<br />
“Furry Joan,” Darrell shouting; “is fish going to flop around?”<br />
“No,” Joan answering; “but it’s not going to last as I’m about to devour it. It smells so good.”<br />
“I seasoned the trout with garlic, lemon and black pepper,” Douglas sitting on the large wooden stool that he had custom made for his large frame in his fursona; “most nights I just eat the fish raw.”<br />
“You must love sushi then,” Joan cutting into her trout; “plenty of raw fish and octopus.”<br />
“As long as it’s not tuna,” Douglas answering; “It’s the one fish I cannot stand.”<br />
“Why is tuna bad,” Darrell asking; his mouth stuffed with macaroni.<br />
“Because Darrell,” Douglas sighing; “most were-mers smell like tuna. I cringe when I see my fellow deputies eating tuna fish sandwiches. I makes me feel they are eating wer-mers.”<br />
“Well that’s not going to give me nightmares,” Joan responding sarcastically; “it’s kind of creepy if you ask me.”<br />
“It’s just how I feel,” Douglas answering; “tuna is the one fish I just can’t stomach.”<br />
“Did mommy smell like tuna,” Darrell asking; “were you afraid you might eat her?”<br />
“Darrell,” Douglas putting his fork down; “you mother did smell like tuna. And no I wasn’t afraid I might eat her.”<br />
“How did Alyssa become a wer-mer,” Joan asking.<br />
<br />
Douglas groans; this was a topic he generally frowned on discussing. Not out of respect for the parties involved, but for the unease in which it nearly tore his family apart.<br />
“Alyssa had an affair with our Mayor,” Douglas sighs; “before he got elected, Martin was a financial consultant and an accountant. He was recently married, but he had a wandering eye.”<br />
“I get the ideal,” Joan cutting in; “but she was your cousin right?”<br />
“Yes,” Douglas answering; “before my family moved to Moon Lake, we use to live in New Orleans Louisiana. Alyssa’s parents were tragically killed in a car accident stemming from a levee breaking. She came to live with my parents as she was only six or seven at the time. Moving to Moon Lake because my father found work as a park ranger; It wasn’t long until after the town chancellor at the time, Samantha Twist’s predecessor informed us that a member of the family was to become a were within the week or-“<br />
“A werewolf filled me in on the whole deal,” Joan interrupting; “I take since you became the were-“<br />
“The council was satisfied,” Douglas answering and left my parents be.”<br />
“But why a were-grizzly,” Joan asking; “when there are other were to choose from?”<br />
“Would you believe it was an honest accident,” Douglas smiling; “Shortly after moving to town, I ran into this lovely brunette. She was about my age, around fifteen. We hit it off well enough, she knew I was a normal and was naturally reserved in revealing that she was a were. After telling her I just moved to town and the whole town chancellor revealing the existence of weres; she sort of freaks out and inadvertently shifted into her fursona. She was a were-grizzly and accidently slashed me with her claws,” Douglas sighing; “Naturally when she saw me bleeding with claw marks on my chest and brown fur starting to sprout-“<br />
“I take it,” Joan speaking up; “she was afraid of being charged with statue 1A?”<br />
“Yes,” Douglas answering; “I did my best to calm her down and told her it was an accident and you didn’t mean it. She was going on that now she has to finish my transformation or I might die and all that. So she had me strip me of my clothing and took my virginity right then and there,” Douglas finishing his supper; “fortunately this happened in a wooded area so no one witnessed what happened.”<br />
“Did you tell your parents as to what happened,” Joan asking.<br />
“I told them,” Douglas answering; “that they didn’t have to worry about the whole family were thing. Shifting in my were-grizzly fursona,” Douglas continuing to speak; “made them upset at first. But I told them and the chancellor that I was willing and that nothing bad happened.”<br />
“You lied,” Joan looking surprised.<br />
“There was no need to get the girl who accidently mauled me in trouble,” Douglas is speaking; “so I kept the incident to myself. We never saw each other after that,” Douglas sighed; “later on I find out her family left town in a hurry. I thought they might have found out what happened and didn’t want her potentially locked away. Either way,” Douglas looking at Darrell who was silently listening; “Alyssa and I grew closer after that. I’d always wake up to find her sleeping next to me when I slept my fursona. I guess she found my fur warm and comforting.”<br />
“Mommy fish used you as a blanket,” Darrell asking<br />
“This was many years before your mother became a wer-mer,” Douglas answering; “but yes, on cold nights Alyssa would always snuggle next to me wanting to keep warm. I had to put a stop to it one day, when I woke up and found my claws pressing on her skin. Not wanting to scratch her by accident and not wanting to commit incest,” Douglas shuddering; “I had to sit her down and explain to her that it was dangerous what she was doing could have serious consequences for the both of us. Alyssa was not happy after wards.”<br />
“So that explains why you two were always estranged,” Joan speaking again.<br />
“That and her affair with Martin Stovall,” Douglas getting up to clear the table; “but what really made us estranged was my parents passing away six years ago. They were disappointed in her lifestyle choices and distant themselves from her. Alyssa felt alone and did what she could to lash out and get attention. Plus I was ignoring at the time I was busy putting the affairs of my former Seattle gang task force partner in order. It didn’t help that his wife was an alcoholic werewolf and their son was only four years old when my partner died.”<br />
<br />
Douglas pausing cleaning up as he thinks on John Shaffer Sr. and his son John Jr. Thinking it would be best to pay the fourteen year old a visit tomorrow to see how he is handling after finding out his mother died last Sunday. Smiling as Douglas thinks Darrell would like to meet the young werewolf as well; the were-grizzly turns around and thinks that taking the tyke to the local pool might be what is in order instead.<br />
“Darrell,” Douglas quickly grabbing the slippery kid and lifting him up so he is eye level with the were-grizzly; “how would you like to go swimming tomorrow?”<br />
“Yay,” Darrell smiles; “are you going to show me how to swim?”<br />
“Oh,” Douglas chuckling as he puts Darrell down; “I’m sure you already know how. You are a wer-mer after all. You just have yet to grow your own fish tail.”<br />
“Darrell has never been in a pool before,” Joan watching Darrell run around all happily; “All the ones in Burbank were chlorinated and irritated Alyssa.”<br />
“Believe it or not,” Douglas smiling; “wer-mers are what’s referred to as the quiet weres. Even as a child, wer-mers can breathe talk and see underwater even before puberty and their first transformations.”<br />
“Is that true,” Joan looking shocked.<br />
“Andrew Curtis,” Douglas answering; “the wer-mer rep told me about this in confidence awhile back. It’s not something the mer-folk are keen on sharing even with other weres.”<br />
“So Darrell is going to have on hell of a day tomorrow then,” Joan watching the kid play.<br />
“That he will,” Douglas answering as he joins Darrell and plays with the precocious child.</p>
