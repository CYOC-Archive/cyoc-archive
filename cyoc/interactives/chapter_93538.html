<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
On my 18 birthday, I decided to travel straight after leaving school. Just a<br />
year ago, I had inherited a great deal of money after my parents passed away<br />
in a tragic car accident. I had always felt lost after they died, especially<br />
hit hard by the loss of my mother. As much as I hated it in my teenage years,<br />
she always treated me as her sweet little boy and it hurt to lose that kind of<br />
unconditional love. Anyway, with no relatives back home in England, I was free<br />
to do as I wished. I didn&#39;t feel guilty or restrained about leaving as my<br />
mates had all left for college. So, I decided to head over to the States to<br />
wander the country for a while. It felt quite freeing to be on my own,<br />
especially since I didn&#39;t tell anyone about my little sabbatical.<br />
<br />
I had been travelling along the East Coast and through the South for about two<br />
months when I arrived in Arkansas, just outside Little Rock, for an over night<br />
stopover in some tiny town called Bliss. I laughed at the name, as all I could<br />
see was the run down bus station, an old gas station, and a dirt road.<br />
Certainly not bliss. Still, a guy has to sleep somewhere. I got off the<br />
Greyhound bus and, after retrieving my heavy luggage, looked for a station<br />
manager to ask concerning a hotel for the night. But the ticket counter was<br />
closed and the entire station seemed empty. The bus driver had assured me<br />
there was a place to stay around here. As I turned around to disagree, all I<br />
saw were the taillights of the bus in the distance and a cloud of dust.<br />
<br />
Begrudgingly, I gathered myself and walked over to the gas station praying<br />
that it was still open. Thankfully, an old man behind the counter gave me<br />
walking directions to a motel a couple miles down the road. Gosh, I was<br />
already so darn exhausted and now I have to lug my bags all the way down the<br />
road in the middle of the night. I tossed my duffel over my shoulder, picked<br />
up my suitcase and started hoofing it.<br />
<br />
After about 40 minutes, I finally found the pathway to the hotel. Talk about<br />
off the beaten path! I huffed and puffed through the front door of the lobby<br />
and walked up to the reception desk. I rang the little bell a few times and<br />
leaned up against the counter trying to stay awake. A blonde woman walked out<br />
to greet me and I instantly perked up. Her long blonde hair was shoulder<br />
length and framed around a beautifully sculptured face. She appeared to be in<br />
her late thirties, but didn&#39;t dress her age. Her low cut dress revealed some<br />
remarkably large breasts. I had never seen such giant breasts in person and<br />
desperately tried hard not to stare at them.<br />
<br />
She warmly smiled at me and said: &quot;Well hello there young man, my name is Miss<br />
Brady.&quot; Her heavy southern accent sweetened up those few words tremendously.<br />
She held out her hand and I instantly noticed it seemed much larger than mine<br />
did. I&#39;m not self-conscious about that occurrence as I am quite short for my<br />
age (5 foot, 2 inches) and it happens quite a bit. I shook her hand and told<br />
her that I needed a room for the night. She handed me a form to fill out and I<br />
couldn&#39;t believe how long it was. I was going to be forever before I could<br />
plop down on that soft comfy bed.<br />
<br />
It seemed to be very detailed for such a small motel. Date of birth, reason<br />
for travel, etc. I started writing quickly and barely even looked at what I<br />
was filling out. After about 10 minutes, I finished and handed the paper back<br />
to her. Miss Brady frowned and asked why I didn&#39;t fill out the emergency<br />
contact box with a family member. I explained my tragic absence of family and<br />
she gave me a sympathetic smile.<br />
<br />
Miss Brady gave me a little pat on my hand and said &quot;Well don&#39;t you worry hon,<br />
you are the only guest tonight and have the best room all of Bliss. Let me<br />
show you the way.&quot; She walked out from behind the desk and it finally dawned<br />
on me how tall she was. I gawked for a couple seconds as those amazing breasts<br />
were directly at my eye level. I had to stretch my neck upward just to see her<br />
face.<br />
<br />
Miss Brady effortlessly picked up my bags and smiled. &quot;My, aren&#39;t you a sweet<br />
little boy!&quot; Strangely, she seemed to be happy at the physical comparison<br />
between us. I felt so small beside her, very much like a child. &quot;Well, come<br />
with me sweetie and let&#39;s get you into bed.&quot; I walked next to her and offered<br />
to carry the bags, but she wouldn&#39;t have it. We stopped outside a large door,<br />
a bit oversized. She unlocked the room with an old-style metal key and I<br />
thankfully went inside. It was a warm, comfortable looking room and I sat down<br />
on the extremely plush bed, oozing into it inch by inch. After dropping my<br />
bags, she stood in the doorway, head almost touching the frame, and said: &quot;If<br />
you need anything at all, just let me know. Sweet dreams, hon.&quot;<br />
<br />
She closed the door and I quickly took off my clothes to wash off all the road<br />
dust in the shower. After spending about 15 minutes in the hot water, I<br />
toweled off and jumped into the bed. As my eyes started to droop, the thought<br />
of Miss Brady lingered in my mind. Her statuesque body, those wonderful curves<br />
and the magnificent breasts. Gosh, I know I would never get a chance to see<br />
them, but hey, it&#39;s nice to dream. Even in my tired state, I started to get<br />
hard and decided to play with myself a bit. What&#39;s the harm in a little fun<br />
before I fall asleep, especially with Miss Brady on my mind?<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the door swung open and I got that deer in the headlights look on my<br />
face. I froze and didn&#39;t even think to throw the covers over myself until<br />
about 3 seconds later. I just hoped she didn&#39;t see anything. After what seemed<br />
like an eternity she said, &quot;My, my, my, it seems my little boy is playing with<br />
himself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Damn. &quot;What&#39;s the meaning of this intrusion!?&quot; I said, &quot;Is this how you treat<br />
your guests?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OH, I&#39;m not the naughty one,&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;Do you know what mummy does to<br />
bad little boys?&quot; Miss Brady had her hands on her hips and was obviously<br />
dressed for bed. She was wearing a white silk robe, which only came down to<br />
her thighs, and red underwear really trying hard to constrain those mammoth<br />
breasts. They were pushing up out of the robe and I watched as they heaved up<br />
and down. It was almost hypnotic.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stand up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I&#39;m naked.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Stand up now.&quot; The tone in her voice was frightening, so I slowly rolled out<br />
of bed making all attempts to keep the covers around my waist. She walked over<br />
to me, her breasts just a couple of inches from my face and tore off the<br />
covers. I&#39;ve never felt so vulnerable. &quot;Is this why my little boy wanted the<br />
room?&quot; pointing at my dick &quot;To play with his little wee-wee?&quot;<br />
<br />
She brushed past me and sat firmly on the edge of the bed. I had no idea what<br />
was coming, but it couldn&#39;t be good. She reached for my upper body and<br />
effortlessly pulled me up over onto her lap. My still somewhat hard penis was<br />
trapped between her strong thighs and I couldn&#39;t believe she started to spank<br />
me. Light taps at first, but they gradually began to increase in speed and<br />
strength.<br />
<br />
&quot;This will teach you a lesson, young man. I said if you needed anything, you<br />
should let me know. I hope you will listen next time, hon. This is for your<br />
own good.&quot; The sweet southern accent wasn&#39;t so nice anymore, certainly due to<br />
the pain coursing through my cheeks at the moment. She had me count to 40<br />
spanks and then stopped. The emotions running through me were taking over<br />
quickly. How did I allow this to occur? Everything was so embarrassing and I<br />
could feel water welling up in my eyes. I tried to hold it together while she<br />
put me back on my feet, picked up the covers on the floor and made the bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get in.&quot; She commanded. Considering what just happened, I was in no condition<br />
to argue. I hopped in quickly and she sat down beside me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, I hope my sweet little boy has learnt his lesson.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Miss Brady, I&#39;m sorry for what I was going in your hotel, but I am not a<br />
little boy.&quot; I stated with conviction.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh honey pie, next to me, you are a baby. You are not a man, but still a<br />
widdle boy. So, if you step out of line, will be punished like one. Mummy<br />
knows what&#39;s best for you!&quot;<br />
<br />
I couldn&#39;t believe what she was saying. Had this woman gone loopy?<br />
<br />
&quot;Now its time for sleep hon,&quot; she tucked me in the covers nice and tight. &quot;Goodnight baby.<br />
Mummy hopes you have sweet dreams!&quot;<br />
<br />
She turned the light switch off and shut the door behind her. I heard the<br />
distinct clicking of the door lock and about a thousand thoughts were running<br />
though my mind. My brain was telling me to get the hell out of Dodge in the<br />
dead of the night, but where would I go? I&#39;m in the middle of nowhere and<br />
nobody knows that I&#39;m here. I had allowed myself to be at the mercy of a busty, blonde amazon who<br />
seems to think she&#39;s my new mommy! Oh boy, I&#39;m too tired to think about this<br />
tonight. I&#39;ll wake up early and figure out what to do in the morning. Yep,<br />
that&#39;s (yawn) a fantastic (yawn) plan...</p>
