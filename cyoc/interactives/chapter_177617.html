<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Dude I don&#39;t know....but....maybe they have a phone?&quot; Alex replied. His uncertainty about how to get out of this wilderness making this camp that appeared out of nowhere seem like a good option.<br />
<br />
&quot;I dunno man...this is some Friday the 13th shit.&quot; replied Greg &quot;I swear that camp wasn&#39;t there before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It - definitely wasn&#39;t&quot; replied Laura<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, the way I see it....we don&#39;t have another option. If we want to salvage this trip, I think we have to try our luck at the camp&quot; said matt<br />
<br />
&quot;I think he&#39;s right Greg, we don&#39;t really have any other choice&quot; Alex said with a shrug. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fine. You guys win, but if there&#39;s any spooky shit i&#39;m out of there.&quot; Greg muttered in response.<br />
<br />
On that note, the crew made their way down the long dusty road that led into the camp. After about fifteen minutes or so of walking, they finally arrived. <br />
<br />
Camp Critter Creek had definitely seen better days. Most of the cabins had broken windows, some were partially collapsed and the swimming pool was covered in green algae. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well....I think that&#39;s a sign they probably don&#39;t have a phone.&quot; Said Greg<br />
<br />
&quot;Yea, you&#39;re probably right.&quot; Alex replied, worry crossing his face as he looked at his watch &quot;Shit, its almost 7:30....suns gonna go down soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck. So....should we sleep here for the night?&quot; asked Matt, knowing the suggestion wouldn&#39;t be appreciated but also understanding it was their only option. <br />
<br />
&quot;I think we have to...&quot; replied Laura as she began shaking ever so slightly. The idea of staying in a creepy old camp was terrifying to her. <br />
<br />
Taking the initiative, as he always did, Alex surveyed the camp. In his eyes, only two structures seemed to be in decent shape, a building labeled &#39;Head councilor&#39; and some horse stables. Obviously, they&#39;d have to sleep in the councilor&#39;s cabin. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come on guys, looks like that head councilor building is our only option.&quot; Alex said, making his was to the building. <br />
<br />
Pushing open the door, he was surprised to find the cabin in decent shape. Well, not only in decent shape but subspecialty prepared for the four of them. The walls were neatly painted, floors refinished and windows gleamed with the shine of a recent clean. Most shocking, however, were the four bed that stood before them. Each was neatly made and the slight scent of detergent tinged the air.  They were made recently. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck. This is too weird.&quot; Greg said &quot;It looks like someone....prepared for us...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Again dude, we don&#39;t have another choice&quot; Alex replied, trying to suppress his own worries &quot;This is certainly a bit....weird...but at least we have a clean cabin and nice beds.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay! Lets lighten the mood!&quot; Matt called out, trying to distract from the ominous feel that had filled the room &quot;I&#39;ve got a deck of cards and a few beers. If we&#39;re gonna be stuck here on Spring Break we might as well make it feel like spring break. Sound good?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Beer always sounds good&quot; replied Greg. He needed a drink.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then its a plan&quot; Alex replied &quot;Tonight we&#39;ll have a few drinks, play some cards and try and relax. In the morning, I&#39;ll see if I can find an old phone or a map and we can try and get some help.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Matt broke out the beer, and Alex led them in a game of spades the worries of the night soon faded into a gentle buzz of alcohol and distracting fun. Eventually, the four made their way into the beds and fell asleep, the buzz of the alcohol dampening their worries of the suspiciously neat cabin they were staying in.<br />
____________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
Outside the wind picked up. The same whispering whistle flowed through the trees and began swirling near the ground. Slowly, a mixture of dirt, leaves and pine needles filled the air, gradually taking on a humanoid shape that seemed to dynamically shift between various forms of humanoid animals. It was a created in a state of constant change. The figure stood still for a moment, eyeing the cabin.<br />
<br />
The trickster god had inhabited these lands for centuries, using this location as a gateway of sorts for his powers. At this point, two worlds crossed, the human world and the animal world. For the trickster god of change, this intersection point amplified his powers. It took little more than simple nudges at this site to change and contort people to suit his whims and something he enjoyed deeply. Historically, he&#39;d reveled in playing with the victims who found their way onto this ancient land, but after centuries of tricks, he found himself growing ….tired. Messing with people was fun, but he also felt a need to do...something....good, for a change. As a trickster, doing good naturally wouldn&#39;t mean abandoning his love of messing with his victims and occasionally giving them their comeuppance through forms they&#39;d never have wanted. But in the end, he felt it was time to start pushing people towards lives they could....enjoy. The thought filled him with a sense of contentment he never found in his old tricks. <br />
<br />
When he&#39;d seen the broken vehicle, he decided to use the opportunity to seize this fresh start. At that moment, he created the camp and decided these four would be the first he&#39;d push towards new and, hopefully better, lives. A sense of playful glee filled him. While he enjoyed the idea of doing good, he couldn&#39;t help but relish the chance to play with these four a bit first. <br />
<br />
Standing a moment longer, the figure shifted, its component levers and needles flying into the air and soaring towards the cabin in a gust of powerful wind. The well kept walls of the building stood firm against the gust, but whispers of air managed to sneak through.<br />
<br />
One gust curled around Alex&#39;s sleeping face, as a soft voice caught in the breeze said &quot;the cabin needs a leader...you have been chosen.&quot; Slowly, Alex&#39;s black hair seemed to whiten in certain places, creating two distinct stripes down the midddle.<br />
<br />
Another gust curled around Gerg. &quot;Your attitude is sour, and masculinity clouds your mind. This shall change. The leader needs a mate. You have been chosen&quot; Greg&#39;s ears slowly began to change, moving higher on his head and taking on a rounded animalistic form. Slowly tawny leonine fur spread across them, completing their change.<br />
<br />
A third swirled around Laure &quot;You lack confidence and strength. The camp lacks horses to fill the stables. We need a strong stallion for the campers to ride. You have been chosen.&quot; Her ears also shift, moving higher, growing brown fur and tapering to equine points. <br />
<br />
The final guest met Matt &quot;You are too enamored with your intelligence. You require a taste of the simple life. The sables are a good fit. Our stallion needs a mare. You have been chosen.&quot; Matt&#39;s short blond hair darkened to a deep auburn. Slowly, it spread down his neck and onto the top of his back. Each strand grew longer, turning his conservative &#39;boys cut&#39; into a flowing shoulder length mane. <br />
<br />
Suddenly, the winds stopped. All was quiet. Unaware of the changes that would slowly twist their bodies and lives over the course of the weekend, the group slept on.</p>
