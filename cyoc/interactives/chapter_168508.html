<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Of all the Holy Knights sworn to protect the land of Averan, none were more pious than Kayla.<br />
<br />
Once a mere peasant girl, eking out a miserable existence, she had found her purpose as a teenager. A visitation to her village by a priest from the Church of the Virgin Goddess had introduced her to the power of the kingdom&#39;s faith, and of those who fought in the name of Her Holiness. As an eager young squire she had thrown herself into her duties and studies of the dogma with a fanatical resolve. <br />
<br />
As a woman, however, she had become something fearsome. An unassuming woman to look at, perhaps, but clad in plate armor and wielding a masterwork blade, she had proven to be among the finest warriors in the recent history of the Church. People ranging from lowly peasants to even the King himself had recognized her bravery, her tenacity in battle, and her tireless dedication to the church and its teachings.<br />
<br />
All things considered, the honor she had received mere hours ago should not have come as that great of a surprise. Still, though... it had been well over a thousand years since a Holy Champion had been declared. The title had been granted to her by the High Priestess herself, the ceremony more lavish than even the coronation of a monarch. Fitting, really, that so grandiose an occasion as the declaration that she was the holy avatar of the grandest of all deities.<br />
<br />
The ceremony, however, was over now, the celebrations having ended as night crept in. In truth, Kayla was relieved to be away from the enormous crowd, the throngs of nobles congratulating her, the mob of clergy that sought to gain favor with the new most important woman in the Church. The quarters she&#39;d been afford, a room in the King&#39;s palace normally reserved for visiting royals from allied kingdoms, was easily the most comfortable place she&#39;d ever stayed.<br />
<br />
Dressed down to her typically humble clothes, rather than the ceremonial garb she&#39;d been wearing all night, was proving far more relaxing. She&#39;d taken to standing out on the balcony with a glass of some ostentatious liquor - the knight would&#39;ve far preferred her typical beers, but drinking the swill was part of the royal treatment, she supposed. As nice as these accomodations were, they were offputting - she couldn&#39;t wait to get back into the field, staying in the inns and stables that she was familiar wtih, sustaining herself on more humble provisions than this overly expensive wine.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it looks like we&#39;ve got our work cut out for us, haven&#39;t we?&quot;<br />
<br />
The wine glass was thrown aside as Kayla twirled around, her short blonde hair flying about as she hurried to face the sultry voice that had suddenly spoken up behind her. The knight&#39;s entire body flung into alert mode, fists clenched and eyes wide as they fell upon the figure that now stood in her room. A tall woman, hands clasped together, dressed in a white gown. Soft brown eyes bored into Kayla, her black hair tumbling down around the woman to contrast the pure coloration of her garb. The Knight&#39;s jaw fell open in disbelief - she had seen this visage countless times before in works of art, but never once imagined viewing it in person.<br />
<br />
&quot;...my Goddess!&quot; Her heart practically leapt out of her throat as she fell to her knees, hands clapsed in reverance of the deity that had appeared so suddenly before her. &quot;Your Holiness... I... I am honored beyond words!&quot; It was difficult to string together coherent sentences, the shock of viewing a Goddess in the flesh being too much even for her. <br />
<br />
To here benefit, the deity seemed more than willing to fill the holes in the conversation instead. &quot;Oh please, none of that nonsense. It&#39;s just embarassing. And get on your feet, for heaven&#39;s sake!&quot; She sighed. &quot;Really now, it amazes me how far off the deep end you&#39;ve all gone.&quot; She continued speaking as she stepped closer to the trembling Kayla, reaching up to brush some of her lucious locks back. &quot;I mean, really! Me, the <i>Virgin Goddess</i>! I wish the idiot who&#39;d thought up that moniker was still alive, so that I could end him myself!&quot;<br />
<br />
Confusion reigned over Kayla&#39;s expression, her attempts to speak thwarted by the ongoing speech of her deity. &quot;And you... oh, you have spirit, but the outside... we&#39;ll need to do something about that. Quite a few somethings.&quot; She sighed once more. &quot;First, let us establish something: if you call me a Virgin even once, you&#39;ll not be the champion of anything. My name is Lilith, and you will address me as such.&quot; She began to adjust her robes, pulling up the sleeves. &quot;Can you do that, sweetheart? For me?&quot;<br />
<br />
She slowly nodded. &quot;I... uh... y-yes, my... Lilith.&quot; Her brow furrowed. &quot;I-I am sorry, I... I did not know...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, of course you didn&#39;t. Nobody knows me anymore.&quot; The goddess shook her head. &quot;All any of you know is this... saccharine nonsense that your church pushes. It really does say something about mortals, doesn&#39;t it?&quot; She shrugged, and the white sleeves of her robe fell away, exposing the silky skin of her bare arms. &quot;You leave the world alone for just a few centuries, just to make sure reality isn&#39;t torn asunder by some cosmic horror, and when you come back? They&#39;re calling you a Virgin!&quot; Her hands gestured upwards dramatically. &quot;It&#39;s staggering! Simply staggering!&quot;<br />
<br />
Completely befuddled, Kayla could only take a seat on the edge of her bed as Lilith continued further. &quot;Ah, but you, sweetheart... you&#39;re going to help me set things right. Because you? You&#39;re exactly what I&#39;ve been looking for. You&#39;ve got...&quot; She rolled her hand in a circle several times, pondering the best word for it. &quot;Spunk. You&#39;re spunky. And oh, are we going to need spunky.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;O-oh, of course, y-your Holiness!&quot; She nodded anxiously. &quot;I will bring as much spunk as you need!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...right, Lilith, honey, not the best choice of words,&quot; she muttered to herself. &quot;Well... look, first thing&#39;s first. The way you are, it&#39;s... not going to work.&quot; She made a few tsk sounds. &quot;You&#39;ve got the spirit, sure, but not the body. We can fix that, but you humans tend to get a bit overloaded, so... it&#39;ll have to be gradual.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kayla swallowed audibly, standing up once more and rubbing her shoulder. &quot;Uh... I-I am sorry, I have done my b-best to remain fit to serve... w-what will be required of me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, for right now, what&#39;s required is for you to hold still.&quot;<br />
<br />
She complied, of course, the idea of defying instructions from her deity an impossible thing to consider. Through great willpower she remained as unmoving as a statue as Lilith approached, grasping the front of her simple dress and yank with tremendous force. The blonde knight forced down the urge to gasp as her bare chest was exposed to the night air, and Lilith let out a frustrated groan. &quot;By Me, you&#39;ve really gotten these things shrunken down, haven&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I-it was... I-I-I worked to reduce them, s-so as to better fit armor...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, well, fuck armor. You don&#39;t need it, because I say so.&quot; She very nearly let out a shocked gasp at the profanity of the goddess, only stopping because she was distracted by the hand placed upon her breast. A warmth began to flood out from the deity&#39;s touch, filling her bosom like a tub being filled with water... and with shock she looked down to watch as her chest began to swell. Slow at first, the pace of the enlargement quickly increased, her once almost-nonexistent bosom becoming a moderate, and then, a rather bountiful set of endowments.<br />
<br />
Never in her life had she seen a woman&#39;s chest so generously large; Kayla couldn&#39;t help but place a hand upon the altered section of her body, stunned with disbelief. &quot;I... I don&#39;t...&quot; She shook her head. &quot;Such things... I-I was always told of how such immodest proportions... is this not a curse?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lilith went slack-jawed for a moment. &quot;A <i>curse</i>?&quot; She scoffed. &quot;I just gave you the finest tits in this whole kingdom, plus the back muscle to support it, and you&#39;re asking me if it&#39;s a curse?!&quot; She reached up to rub her temple. &quot;Oh... oh sweetheart, we&#39;ve got such a long way to go.&quot; <br />
<br />
With a resolute sigh she backed away, frowning at the sight of Kayla attempting to cover her expanded chest. &quot;Look... you&#39;re tired, I&#39;m sure, and I have matters to attend to, so please - just trust me, this is no curse.&quot; She gestured to the freshly-engorged part of Kayla&#39;s body. &quot;This is a blessing, and there are plenty more in stock, no matter what bullshit that Church has been feeding you. In fact...&quot; She smiled wickedly. &quot;As your goddess, I command you to pleasure your new bounty.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kayla was given no chance to protest before the goddess faded away, leaving her alone once more in her quarters. Collapsing back onto the bed, she stared down at her chest in continued disbelief. Her goddess... she had sworn, she had spoken in such a strange manner, and she insisted that this... this was a good thing? To be accursed with such a lack of modesty? Shame filled her at the very sight of what now dangled from her front. Even Lilith&#39;s command that she... eugh, that she sully herself? How could the Virgin Goddess command such a thing? Had that even been her deity, or some vile spirit masquerading as that which she worshipped?<br />
<br />
So many questions swirled in her head as she stared down, a hand anxiously poised above one breast. The urge to obey the command of her goddess, if that really had been her, was strong... but so much conflict raged in her right now. How was she supposed to handle so strange and inconceivable a situation?</p>
