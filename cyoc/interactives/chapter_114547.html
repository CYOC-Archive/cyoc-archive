<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle began running away from Jens front door. He needed to find someone to curse soon to counter his current changes.<br />
<br />
About a block away Kyle stopped to look around. They may live in a small town but he hadn’t seen anyone outside. <br />
“Fuck this is bad, where is anyone in this god forsaken town?” Kyle yelled his breathing sounding pretty ragged from the run.<br />
<br />
Inhaling again he began running only for him to lose his balance and falling forward barely able to catch himself. Looking back he didn’t see what tripped him up.<br />
<br />
He tried to get up only to find that his hips wouldn’t bend that way he was stuck on his hands and toes.<br />
“Nononono, Please stop!” he begged his body as he felt a tingle at the base of his spine.<br />
<br />
Without warning a jet black horse tail forced its way out of his tailbone just above his jeans.<br />
<br />
Kyle’s eyes bugged out as he looked back at his new tail swishing it back and forth, testing out the new sensation of a tail between his legs a shiver ran up his spine.<br />
<br />
Turning around he began to stumble back the way he came, he was going to use this curse on Jen again to force her to stop this and fix him.<br />
<br />
Kyle heard the sounds of seams ripping and tried to figure out what was changing next; his shoes were bulging at the seams and with a loud rip the shoes were destroyed and hooves with a light gray fur were in the place of his feet.<br />
His muscles and bones began to tweak and spasm causing him to stop or risk falling over. If Kyle was happy about one thing it was the changes didn’t hurt, they may be uncomfortable but they did not hurt.<br />
<br />
He watched as his legs bulged and shrank and the light gray fur work its way up his legs, reaching back he felt his leg and noticed the soft fur that now covered them. Once he felt the changes stop in his legs he tried to walk again only to find that he didn’t know how to move the new muscles in his legs causing him to huff and nearly drag his body down the road back towards Jens house.<br />
<br />
On his way his hair changed color to match his tail and grew out and down his neck getting in his way multiple times.<br />
Finally he was almost getting the hang of his back legs and could see Jens place a few houses down. As he worked his way towards his destination he stumbled again this time losing his balance completely falling forward. “Finally I am getting bigger I will be able to make it once I stand up.” he said to himself feeling the tingle run down his back and over his arms. He looked back at his body his hair getting in the way again as he looked at the changes. <br />
<br />
His hands quickly blacked and morphed into hooves and the gray fur spread up his body changing the muscles and bone as it spread. slowly putting a fore hoof down for stability he got back to four hooves<br />
<br />
It struck him as he looked at his hooves they seemed small for a horse. He may be more of a city boy as his cousins say whenever he goes to visit them, but he has seen horses before and the hooves are normally pretty decent sized. He noted that he was only 3.5 to 4 feet off the ground and most of him was changed now. <br />
<br />
Fnally he realized that ponies are horses as well and they are considerably smaller than regular horses especially Clydesdales. He was getting scared, Jen was really big right now and if what she said was true that he would be her breeding mare she would rip him apart. Stumbling the rest of the way he barely made it to Jens front door before the tingling was felt under his belly and privates. Running to the door he began pounding on it with his fore hooves “fuck, Jen I am sorry lets work this out I learned this is a bad idea to play with this curse let’s fix each other and then we can let bygones be bygones. And never talk to each other again. Please!!”<br />
<br />
His ears swiveled to the door and heard Jen approaching <br />
<br />
With a burst of pleasure he felt his dick plunged into his body and rearrange his insides. Kyle was so past caring that he was now a female he just wanted the chance to fix this and go home never to speak of this again.<br />
<br />
Jen laughed from the other side. “What already back? Did you want me to fuck you already? I was gonna wait until I got back from school buut.”<br />
<br />
“Come on Jen Please I will do anything you want just stop your curse on me and we can fix both of our problems.” Kyle begged noticing his voice was slowly rising.<br />
<br />
“Sorry bitch I am excited to teach you a lesson in not fucking with someone else or they may quite literally fuck you back” Jen replied with no hint of mirth in her voice. The pounding stopped and whines could be heard from the other side.<br />
<br />
Jen could tell he was almost done she smiled and walked to her back yard where a new white stable could be seen.</p>
