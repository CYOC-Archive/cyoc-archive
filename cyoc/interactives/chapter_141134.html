<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I got out of the shower feeling invigorated. The orgasm woke me up like a good cup of coffee and the hair loss made me feel light as wind. I needed to figure out what was going on. I sized myself up in the mirror.<br />
<br />
Things had changed, and it both scared and aroused me. My skin was completely smooth, not a hair below my nose. My ass had definitely gotten bigger, whereas my muscles seemed less defined. While I knew that was just because of my lack of weights over the days, the gym couldn&#39;t explain why my lips were puffier and my other facial features had gotten softer. Something was happening to me.<br />
<br />
I begrudgingly pulled on my clothes, resisting the urge to follow the moaning sounds in the stalls and forget the day. I had to figure out a plan. Should I report this? What would happen if I did? Are Taylor and the others in danger? I didn&#39;t see any changes in Taylor&#39;s body, but I don&#39;t recall him eating a single bit of cum yesterday. Maybe something was wrong with him, too?<br />
<br />
I couldn&#39;t go to the police. Who knows what fresh hell they were taking possibly infected people to. Which also ruled out Ryan, too. My relationship with Taylor was probably sour after last night, and after finding out that Daniel was a fag, there was no way I&#39;d be trusting him.<br />
<br />
I knew where I had to go. After all, Jacob was the smartest person in our group. He was double majoring in biochemistry and physics. Out of all of us, he was most likely to change the world. And with a sex virus on the loose, he&#39;d be the safest person to talk to.<br />
<br />
I knocked on the door of his room, hoping Chase wouldn&#39;t be the one to answer. Honestly, as good as I felt after that orgasm, I didn&#39;t want to deal with his happy-go-lucky crap right now. I needed answers.<br />
<br />
After a couple more knocks, I got tired of waiting and tried just opening the door. To my surprise, it worked. Seeing the inside, however, angered me.<br />
<br />
Just sitting on his chair, Chase was simply playing a video game. No headphones, no music playing. Hell, it was a game that you could pause, too. He noticed me come in and, without even turning, just said, &quot;Hey.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey? Why didn&#39;t you open the door?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck that. I wasn&#39;t about to pause or some stupid shit. That&#39;s why I left the door unlocked,&quot; he replied, as if it was the most obvious thing in the world.<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened to your &#39;student council&#39; face? And where&#39;s Jacob?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
Chase rolled his eyes. &quot;On his bed, idiot.&quot;<br />
<br />
I realized that I couldn&#39;t see his bed at first because his dresser blocked it, but sure enough, Jacob laid there with his... Wait a minute.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jacob, why are you on your fucking phone?&quot; I angrily asked him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cause I wanted an Instagram account. I never got one,&quot; he explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about people finding out that you still have your phone?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s why I have the dresser here. Duh,&quot; he stated with a giggle. He motioned towards the dresser. &quot;See? Shhhhh!&quot;<br />
<br />
I looked at his phone. He had a picture of his breakfast with the hashtags &quot;#WheresMyLatte&quot; and &quot;#PrisonFood&quot;. &quot;What about the people who see the network?&quot; I asked, not entirely understanding the situation myself.<br />
<br />
Jacob seemed to know what I was talking about somehow. &quot;Ohhh, oopsy!&quot; he said before closing his phone.<br />
<br />
I had a bad feeling in my gut. Something told me I wasn&#39;t going to find my answers here. &quot;I&#39;m gonna go. See you guys later.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Noooo, staaaay,&quot; Jacob whined. &quot;Pleeeease? I don&#39;t even have my phone anymore. I wanna plaaaay.&quot;<br />
<br />
I wanted to go, but something about his request didn&#39;t feel like a request. To him, it probably was one, but to me, it felt like an order. One that I couldn&#39;t disobey.<br />
<br />
&quot;O-okay,&quot; I stuttered, closing the door behind me. &quot;But can&#39;t you play with Chase?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s been in a bad mood for, like, the past week,&quot; Jacob explained, not realizing the issue with that statement. &quot;And that controller is not what I wanna play with.&quot;<br />
<br />
I nearly lost my balance hearing that. I was screwed. &quot;Jacob, Chase, I think people in this dorm were infected with the virus. Maybe me and maybe you, too. We need to figure out what to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chase paused the game upon hearing that and Jacob seemed to snap out of it a little. &quot;What do you mean? Like, what makes you so sure?&quot; Jacob asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Haven&#39;t you been noticing how packed the bathrooms are? And what people are doing in them?&quot; I began. &quot;Plus, my ass. It&#39;s gotten bigger. And all the hair below my nose is gone. Plus, Taylor didn&#39;t eat any cum when we jacked each other off yesterday night.&quot;<br />
<br />
I slapped my hand against my mouth at the last statement. I wasn&#39;t supposed to tell them that.<br />
<br />
The two of them seemed unfazed by that statement, though. Jacob spoke up first. &quot;That is, like, really weird. Do you get some cum?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, mainly in the morning,&quot; I answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Was it enough?&quot; Chase asked.<br />
<br />
I paused. Just say yes. Yes, it was enough, right? I need to focus and I need them to focus. Say yes.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; I muttered. Fuck.<br />
<br />
Jacob smiled. &quot;Alright, boys. Game plan. If there really is a sex virus on the loose here, we can&#39;t be thinking about sex if we wanna do something about it, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
That seemed logical. I nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;And your naked and probably hungry without enough cum, right?&quot; He continued. I looked down, realizing that I was naked. Somewhere along the way to Jacob&#39;s dorm I must&#39;ve taken off my clothes. I wanted to panic even more, but I realized that I really did need cum. And something more. I nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, like, we need to get the cum out of our balls for that. Soooo,&quot; Jacob explained, rising up and walking towards me. Chase stood up with him.<br />
<br />
&quot;On your knees, boy,&quot; Jacob stated. I obeyed.</p>
