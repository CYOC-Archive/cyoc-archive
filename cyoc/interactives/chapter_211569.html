<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Well, that makes three animal transformations...&quot; Joshua panted a little due to his new half canine nature as he finished with Adriana. Owing to the new structure of his manhood, it took him a moment to calm down and pull out. Largely achieved by the classic &quot;think unsexy thoughts&quot;. But now as he registered what happened, he looked over at Jonathan, remembering that feeling as his newly leonine friend had participated in the sexual episode he had with Adriana - and he couldn&#39;t quite conceal who and what he was any more. &quot;So...I mean. I obviously liked that. What you did. I&#39;m...I&#39;m bi, to tell the truth. But...I didn&#39;t know going into it you were gonna---&quot;<br />
<br />
His tail standing still as he contemplated, Joshua asked as he looked Jonathan over. Much like the new wolfman, the linebacker was recovering from the exertion of the sexual encounter. To tell the truth, the first time Jonathan had ever fooled around with another guy. Joshua asked, &quot;So are you uh...well, at all---&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Honestly, I just decided to join in to test the waters,&quot; Jonathan responded. Admittedly, it was fun - different and all - but still probably not his cup of tea. &quot;I mean I&#39;ve already consented to be turned into a lion hybrid. Why not go the extra mile and see how a little man on man felt?&quot; He chuckled a little as he looked at his friend&#39;s body, &quot;Seems we&#39;re all picking up significant amounts of muscle from this change.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luke piped up, &quot;Me personally, I&#39;m gonna reserve my energy for any women I might end up with. Hopefully we find a bar for enthusiasts about this change service soon. I&#39;m feeling, as you might be able to tell...kinda randy again.&quot; Luke&#39;s cock was half hard again from watching the bisexual encounter between Joshua, Jonathan and Adriana, and he looked at the woman briefly. He knew that if he went with her again, he&#39;d be pushed more toward fully horse, less human. Still, she was incredibly sexy, and despite knowing better, he still felt the temptation - hence his desire for them to find such an amenable bar soon.<br />
<br />
Joshua crossed his arms and decided to watch for now, &quot;And we&#39;re sure that this change is gonna revert after uhh...&quot; He paused, and looked at Adriana, &quot;Six hours, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t be such a worry wort, Josh,&quot; Jonathan waved a hand as he kept on looking for somewhere to go for the rest of their night once all the changes were done, &quot;We&#39;ll all be happily human and back to our normal selves after six hours. That&#39;s the rules of the service.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joshua quieted down and looked between him, Jonathan, and Luke. There was also the fact that another session with Adriana would mean, if she teased them all the way to orgasm, going from this sort of anthropomorphic form to a more animalistic state. As much as Joshua was willing to play ball with being a---a werewolf for now, he was not willing to lose his thumbs on this. Let alone use of his legs. He glanced at Luke, as if wondering from how the guy was eyeing Adriana...<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. No matter how much you change and how many times,&quot; Adriana clarified, &quot;You need not worry - in six hours, you will return to being as you were at the start of the night. Such is the nature of my gift.&quot; She then glanced between the remaining two men left. Callum and Peyton. Peyton for his part was substantially weirded out by all that went on, and how his friends - now three in total - just seemed completely fine with being characters in a furry webcomic or something.<br />
<br />
Callum however had been watching the changes go on now in three of his friends with great eagerness. He quickly raised his hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve watched and enjoyed the sight of you changing Jonathan, Luke and Joshua...and now...&quot; Callum gulped with joy, &quot;Now it&#39;s finally my turn, it&#39;s looking like. I&#39;m feeling pretty excited. Can&#39;t wait to see what kind of awesome change I get put through. Going by you guys, it looks like it always feels great.&quot; Callum leaned back in his seat, clearing his long black hair from his face, and tried to flex a little. He was however more lean and thin than rippling with muscles.<br />
<br />
Adriana nodded, &quot;Keep in mind, your changes are random. And that means anything could happen. Embrace the chaos of it, and go with the moment.&quot; She moved toward Callum and the others in the room promptly gathered near the empty chairs, deciding to watch and see what happened with their friend. For his part, Peyton blushed and looked away. He&#39;d watched so many thus far, he didn&#39;t need to see whatever became of Callum.<br />
<br />
First of all, Adriana advanced on him and planted a deep, passionate kiss on his lips that Callum eagerly reciprocated. Their tongues darting back and forth as Callum was drawn further and further into a heady stupor - it seemed somehow even just kissing her made him feel passively good. Setting off sensations in him he barely recognized until they were all ablaze. The others watched as they saw Callum&#39;s skin seemed to turn slightly more pale. His greasy black hair changing, becoming more crisp, clean and silky as the passion intensified. He flushed with lust as his lips seemed to grow a little thicker. <br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s she turning him into...?&quot; Joshua contemplated. He couldn&#39;t quite tell yet.<br />
<br />
As Adriana ran her hands through Callum&#39;s hair mid-kiss, they watched the black hair turn light blond, lightening in shade each time she ran her hand through it. The length slightly shortening if anything, but it became more thick and luscious. By the time she finished, Callum was almost out of breath, &quot;Ohhh...wow...ohh shit this feels great guys...&quot;<br />
<br />
But if he thought just that felt good, he was not prepared for how it felt as she moved in and began kissing him at the lower end of the neck, then down - kissing each nipple one after the other, darting back and forth between these spots even as she started adding more - kissing lower and lower. Callum gasped and moaned as his hands gripped the chair, no longer even pondering what he was turning into - just how good it felt to change at all.<br />
<br />
Callum for his part did not even notice that his nails gripping the chair were becoming finer, more manicured looking, and as his arms tensed - gripping on to the chair, his muscles became tighter, much more visibly toned, but in the process he lost body hair - any hair on his arms falling out and quickly disintegrating. As Adriana kissed each nipple one more time, Callum&#39;s shoulders tightened and grew more toned, his pecs toning up - but as he gulped and groaned with pleasure, he didn&#39;t see his nipples remaining prominent - and if anything, much more sensitive than usual. His chest hair just as well vanishing from him.<br />
<br />
&quot;More...more! Fuck I feel so good...&quot; His voice was changing, turning lighter and higher, even as he got slightly shorter and more compact. His face turning more round, cuter, and androgynous. It was all he could manage to not kick with his legs as he felt Adriana rubbing his cock with one hand as she kissed her way down his stomach...<br />
<br />
His abs in the process grew more visible, standing out in great relief - assisted by the fact that any hair outside a small amount near his groin was fast disappearing from him. It didn&#39;t take much guessing for Joshua in particular, being a formerly closeted bisexual, to know what Callum was turning into. He had several questions, granted, but he figured they could wait so as not to disrupt the change that Callum was so obviously enjoying.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhh! Oh, yes! I---I saw---saw how good you are at---at blowi---ahh fuck...&quot; He couldn&#39;t even finish his sentences any more as Adriana began bobbing up and down on his cock. The sheer sensation was mindblowing, and despite how good it felt, Adriana noted as she went on, his cock was actually shrinking rather than growing. Becoming at most about five inches long at full erection, but diamond hard and bobbing in her mouth with the sheer arousal.<br />
<br />
Callum threw his head back as he enjoyed the blowjob, his legs toning up, quads and thighs tightening with muscular tone if not size - leading up to him feeling odd as his glutes began to swell. But if anything the feeling of his glutes getting bigger was heightened as Adriana reached back mid blowjob, and gripped his ass cheeks. The sensation damn nearly made Callum scream it felt so good!<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohh my butt! My ass! What&#39;re you---it feels so---!!&quot; He tried to hold on as best he could, but the sensation coming from his ass left him with little opportunity to hold back the orgasm that rocked his body. His hips pumped, his eyes almost rolled back, and his body all tensed as he felt his smaller balls working to pump their load right through him. He was at once reduced to just moaning and gasping as he felt it hitting him...!<br />
<br />
&quot;Cumming! Cumming!&quot; And so Callum felt his orgasm hit him, and with one final odd sensation, any remaining hair beyond the hair on his head and the slight amount near his groin all faded. His glutes swelled a little bit more...and the milky cum surged up. Not quite as voluminous as his friends&#39; orgasms, but the sheer intensity was rocking Callum&#39;s world. He couldn&#39;t even keep his eyes open any more as he twitched and quivered from the overwhelming sensation. <br />
<br />
Hardly even noticing the slight hint of a certain accent and affectation as he&#39;d announced his culmination...<br />
<br />
Adriana leaned back and licked her lips as she left Callum some time to recover. As the changed young man recuperated, he looked himself over, &quot;N-Not an animal t-transformation...but then, what happened to me? I feel kinda weird now. Different...shorter?&quot; He managed to get up, albeit unsteadily. He glanced around, seeing that there seemed to be some recognition from Joshua. &quot;Hey so uh---&quot;<br />
<br />
Joshua answered, &quot;Seems you&#39;ve uh. You&#39;ve become what we in the LGBT community call a---a uh, a twink.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A...twink?&quot; Callum to tell the truth knew what the term meant, and the connotations therein, looking at the guys with a sense of curiosity he&#39;d never really felt before. A quick blush hit his face as he realized the implication, &quot;Wait...does this mean I&#39;m...? Am I gay now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not necessarily.&quot; Adriana spoke up, &quot;You&#39;re more open. You&#39;d probably enjoy a gay encounter now, but just as much enjoy a straight one. Another session with me, though, and the full mental change into a twink as it were, along with some more physical changes, would occur.&quot; <br />
<br />
Callum blushed and said, &quot;I&#39;ll uh, I&#39;ll think it over.&quot; He didn&#39;t know if he meant that or not. He just wanted to enjoy this new, sensitive body. See how a gay encounter and a straight one just as well felt with his form this sensitive, tight, toned and androgynous. There was something just so...oddly exciting about it. He wanted to test, to see his limits and what he could do.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now...&quot; Adriana looked at the somewhat shy and (albeit hypocritically) prudish Peyton, &quot;Unless someone wants another session, risking further transformation, I believe this leaves you, Peyton.&quot;</p>
