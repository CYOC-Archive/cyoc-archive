<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">James stood quietly as he continued stare in silence at the silvery-black feral dragon with yellow eyes. Apparently a she, the dragoness continued to stare back, holding a hunched over position meant to let him hoist himself onto the space between her neck and bat-like wings. The dragon man that used to be his sister, Danielle, just called her their &#39;dad&#39;. James gave a glance back to his sister. The purple scaled dragon-man had already mounted the other dragon-- he had called this one &#39;mom&#39;. It was at this moment James realized all three of lizard beings had their snouts pointed at him, and James realized what was being asked of him. <br />
<br />
Looking back over to his supposed father, he was once again greeted with piercing, yellow-slitted eyes. James slowly approached the horse-sized creature, nervously flinching as she sniffed in impatience. He found himself right next to the dragoness who pivoted her body even lower and more towards him so he could climb aboard. He blinked as he realized she was bringing a saddle-like seat closer to him. He looked at it and then the harness system attached to it that hugged against her, held tightly by the friction between leather and scales.<br />
<br />
&quot;James get on!&quot; an inhumanly rumbly roar erupted behind him. It was the newer, lower voice of his sister. <br />
<br />
The voice was truly inhuman sounding, and James found himself a little panicked as he quickly scrambled up the graphite-looking scales of his supposed father. The saddle-chair quickly enveloped his lower body as he practically fell into it. Feeling like he was in a booster seat, he tried to adjust himself only to find he couldn&#39;t even move unless he really kicked. Suddenly feeling a bit claustrophobic, James looked across to the other two dragons. Arguably a mistake, he saw the truly frightening face of an angry, impatient purple dragon. It was much scarier to the usual lackadaisical, uncaring look his new brother had sported up to this point and he honestly felt like the creature might kill him. The purple dragon man seemed to notice this reaction however, and began to shift his expression to a more friendly one when his entire form blurred to James.<br />
<br />
James flattened into the saddle-chair as he heard <i>and felt</i> the mighty flap of vehicle sized wings. Fighting against it, James forced his upper half off to the side and looked down. Half of his view was obscured by dark-silvery scales, but the other half was a view of the ground as it fell away faster and faster with each flap of the creature he was riding. He watched the square building of the gas station shrink to a fraction of its size. It was too much for James-- he felt a frightened yell bounding up his throat. The noise of his shriek fell away however as the dragoness below him gave a small pivot, thrusting both forward into the late-day sky. Almost instinctively, James hunched over and gripped the base of her long neck. <br />
<br />
This had the immediate effect of causing the dark-scaled dragoness to let out a booming gag. Despite the loud rushing of wind, the cough was loud enough to send James&#39;s ears ringing. Immediately, his panic began to return as the direction of the wind went from in front of him to directly below and he felt himself lifting easily out of the saddle he had just felt so pinned into. Unable to fight the wind, he let go of the dragon&#39;s neck as it wrenched him away. Immediately, the graphite colored dragon let out a second booming choke before James once again felt shoved down back into the saddle. This time the pressure was so intense it felt like he would pass out. Quickly however, everything eased, and James practically melted against the back of the saddle as the wind once again hit his face.<br />
<br />
Shaken, Jim watched the flying serpent he was on quickly rotate her head against the wind until she faced him.  Before he could even wonder why, he was blasted with the sound of an angry roar. It completely dwarfed the whooshing of the air, and even after covering his ears James could feel how angry, panicked, and pained the deafening roar was. Just as quickly as it filled his ears however, the creature stopped, and quickly faced forward towards where she was flying. James let his hands drop from his ears to his sides, still shaking. He let his head fall to the side as well, fighting the disorientation it caused.<br />
<br />
He managed to look over just in time to see his sister-- brother, rise into view on the other, green dragon. He was finally able to see the concerned look on the purple dragon man&#39;s face as he looked over James with his own slitted, reptilian eyes. Dazed, James briefly noted how the green dragon had a harness, but no saddle letting Danielle sit bareback, his purple tail flapping in the wind like the one belonging to the dragon he was on.  That was all James really noted however as he shut his eyes, ignoring the further disorientation that followed.<br />
<br />
Eventually, he could hear the flapping of wings as opposed to air and he opened his eyes. Pulling his head forward, he could see his &#39;mother&#39; in front of him, sending the noise of her wings to him as she flapped. On his back was still his brother. They were just below the cloud line, and James could see the flat mist of a cloud just above him. The ride was particularly smooth now. James had learned his lesson however, and didn&#39;t budge in his seat-- not that he could. He just watched the sun beginning to set in front of his &#39;new&#39; family and wondered where they were even going anymore.</p>
