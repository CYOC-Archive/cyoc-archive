<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After Raúl has exit the elevator and the doors hiss shut, “Zoey” lets out a long breath, leaning back against the wall of the elevator, “what is wrong with me,” the “girl” mumbles to herself, “why did I feel so weird in Raúl’s presence? It’s… it’s as if I am attracted to him… but… th-that can’t be right! I shouldn’t feel that way, I am a straight boy, okay… I am a girl right now… but still, I feel as if something is wrong”. The elevator then reaches the second floor and when the doors open “Zoey” exits and heads straight for her room.<br />
<br />
When “Zoey” enters her room, she heads to her bed and sits down on I, leaning against the headrest, “did Darren mess with the settings, or am I just overreacting for no reason,” the “girl” asks herself, “I don’t think Darren would mess with me, I trust him, even though he kidnapped me. So, I guess I am just overreacting, it’s not like Raúl wants sex with me, he just gave me a kiss on the cheek, which, I must admit, felt kinda nice. He is such a kind guy… and handsome… I can’t stop thinking about him… it makes me feel as if I have butterflies in my tummy”. “Zoey” lets out a groan and puts her head in her hands, “GAAAH! What is wrong with me,” she asks again, she then lets out a sigh, “calm down, Jeff,” she then says, “nothing is wrong, you are simply overreacting, Raúl does not want anything sexual, he just wants to be friends, and he is such a nice and handsome boy. There is no reason to feel so worried, it actual felt nice being close to him”. The “girl” takes in a deep breath, “yeah, nothing is wrong! We’ll see what will happen, if he decides to go “further”, I can always stop him at any time, I don’t think he’ll force me into something I don’t like or want! I trust him! I won’t tell Darren about my encounter though, it is something I have to deal with on my own!”<br />
<br />
“Zoey” nods and smiles happily, she lies back on her cushion and stares at the ceiling, “I wonder what he looks like under those clothes,” she says to herself, “I bet he has an amazing body, his muscles on his arms looked really good. Man, he must work out a lot, I’d really like to see him without a top,” the “girl”, giggles a little, “hehe… I bet he looks so yummy beneath those clothes… I bet he has a great penis… man, thinking about his cock really makes me feel excited and curious,” the more the “girl” relaxes and thinks about Raúl, the more her mind seems to shift, the boy-part of her mind, continues to try and tell her that what she is thinking is wrong, but “Zoey” simply ignores it, “nothing is wrong, everything feels right,” the “girl” says to herself, “I don’t know why I was so worried earlier”.<br />
<br />
 A few minutes later, “Zoey” hears a knock on her door, “who is it,” she calls.<br />
<br />
“Hey, Zoey,” she hears her “father” say, “it’s time for dinner”.<br />
<br />
“Finally,” “Zoey” says, “I’m starving,” the “girl” gets up from her bed and walks to her door, as she opens it she sees Darren smile down at her.<br />
<br />
“Ready to grab some food,” he asks.<br />
<br />
“Hell yeah,” the “girl” says, “let’s go”.<br />
<br />
Darren chuckles and the two head to the elevator, “so,” Darren says as they wait for the elevator to arrive, “how was your exploration?”<br />
<br />
“It has been great,” the “girl” says, “I found a gaming room”.<br />
<br />
“Cool,” the man says, “any cool games?”<br />
<br />
“Zoey” hesitates, ‘should I tell him about Raúl,’ she asks herself, ‘why not? He does not need to know that I feel weird around him, I can just say that I met a boy, who I think is cool’. The “girl” looks up at Darren, “to be honest,” she says, “I didn’t play any games… I was planning to, but I met a boy who was playing Mario Cart”.<br />
<br />
“Really,” Darren says, “what happened?”<br />
<br />
“Nothing,” “Zoey” says, “we just talked a little, that’s all”.<br />
<br />
“Did he seem like a nice kid,” Darren asks.<br />
<br />
“Zoey” nods, “yeah, he seemed kind,” she says, “we decided to meet up tomorrow evening to play some games. Would that be okay?”<br />
<br />
Darren thinks for a while, he then shrugs, “sure, why not,” he says, “I know that nothing will happen in a certain way, we set your sexual orientation to lesbian”.<br />
<br />
‘I remember now,’ the “girl” thinks to herself, ‘yes, he did that, he would not lie to me, so he didn’t mess with my settings, just as I thought! But then why do I feel so weird? Oh well, it’s probably nothing’. “Zoey” smiles, “yeah,” she says, “I wonder what there will be for food, I am starving”.<br />
<br />
Darren chuckles, “you poor, poor girl,” he says teasingly, “worried that, if you don’t get something in your tummy, you’ll loose all your prettiness?”<br />
<br />
“Zoey” pouts up at Darren, “no,” she says, “I’m just hungry. Really dad, have you forgotten that I have my good looks from you,” she asks, grinning.<br />
<br />
Darren chuckles, “how silly of me,” he says, “how could I forget that?”<br />
<br />
As the elevator finally arrives, “Zoey” is still grinning as they step inside, “I guess the old man is becoming senile”.<br />
<br />
Darren gives her a light slap on the back of her head, he grins down at her, “watch it, young lady,” he says, “or else…,” he pats his pocket in which he keeps his phone.<br />
<br />
“Pfff…,” the “girl” says, “you wouldn’t dare, besides: you started it!”<br />
<br />
Darren laughs, “just kidding. By the way,” he says as they exit the elevator and head to the dining room, “how are you coping with being a 12 year-old girl, and not your normal self?”<br />
<br />
“Zoey” shrugs, “I feel fine,” she says, “it doesn’t feel any different from when I was a 16 year-old boy. The only difference is that I have boobies and nothing dangling between my legs. I mean… it could be worse”.<br />
<br />
Darren smiles, “see? I told you, you’d like it,” he says, “but it doesn’t surprise me, any boy would want to try experiencing what it’s like being the opposite gender”.<br />
<br />
“Zoey” snorts, “yeah… especially perverts,” she says.<br />
<br />
Darren laughs, “true,” he says, ‘hm… Jeff is acting weird. I mean… he looks to comfortable and he even talks and acts like a normal girl,’ he thinks to himself. The man pulls out his phone and opens the App, he pulls up Jeff’s file and looks through it, ‘hm… it’s the same: sexual orientation: lesbian… check, attracted to athletic girls… check… everything is in order,’ he thinks to himself, Darren then shrugs, ‘I guess he is just following the rule I set: act like a girl, especially in public! So, I guess that is why he is acting all girly-like’. Darren closes the App and puts his phone back in his pocket. What neither of them know is that, because Raúl used his own Chronivac-App to scan and edit “Zoey”, the edit does not show up on Darren’s Chronivac-App.<br />
<br />
As they finally enter the dining room, “Zoey’s” eyes widen, “this is NOT a dining room,” she says, “it’s a dining HALL! It’s huge!”<br />
<br />
Darren chuckles, “that it is,” he says, “come, Zoey. Let’s find our table”.<br />
<br />
The two walk up to a small podium, behind which a young man in a black suit is standing, the man smiles when Darren and “Zoey” walk up. “Greetings,” he says, “how can I help you?”<br />
<br />
“Good evening,” Darren says, returning the smile, “we would like to have some dinner”.<br />
<br />
“Are you guests at the Hotel,” the man asks.<br />
<br />
Darren nods, “yes, we should be on the list,” he says, “name is Powers”.<br />
<br />
The man opens a black book, “Powers… Powers…,” he says, “ah! Here we go, table 50. Please follow me”.<br />
<br />
Darren and “Zoey” follow the man until they reach a small table, big enough for two people, the two sit down.<br />
<br />
“Can I get you two something to drink, while you check the menu,” the man asks.<br />
<br />
“I’d like a beer, please,” Darren says.<br />
<br />
The man nods, he then turns to “Zoey”, “and for you, young lady?”<br />
<br />
“I’d like a Coke, please,” she replies.<br />
<br />
“Very well,” the man says, “I’ll have someone bring you your drinks,” with that, the man walks off.<br />
<br />
Darren and “Zoey” pick up the menus and start reading, “wow,” the “girl” exclaims, “everything sounds wonderful”. She looks over at Darren, “dad… c-can I have a five-course menu,” she asks, “it feels so weird calling you “dad”, knowing that you are not… .”<br />
<br />
Darren hushes the girl, “Zoey,” he says, “I am your “dad” as long as you are a girl and my “daughter”. We both know that that is not true, but the others around us don’t, so keep it down, please. And, yes, you can have a five-course… you sure you can manage with that tiny stomach of yours?”<br />
<br />
“S-sorry, Dar… dad,” the “girl” says, “w-won’t happen again, and of course I’ll manage the course!”<br />
<br />
Darren lightens up, he smiles as he says, “all good, Zoey. Well, if you want the 5-course, I think I’ll have the same”.</p>
