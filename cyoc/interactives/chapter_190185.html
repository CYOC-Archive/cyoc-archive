<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It is later that evening that the 4 of you decide to form a party in order to find Ned. You do get a good laugh at how weird the 4 of you look standing together, seeing as how all of you are of different species. And especially in Judy&#39;s case of being fully mechanical. You didn&#39;t even consider it before, but Judy technically is naked right now. And while she doesnt have the exact same &quot;parts&quot; as the rest of you, her body shape is still the same. Her clear &quot;breasts&quot; covers even have nipples and everything. She didn&#39;t seem to care about it though.<br />
<br />
The real girls of your group insisted that you sleep in their room that night and not in Damon&#39;s room as Judy wants to talk. And Brenda actually has gotten use to using you as a hug pillow by now, so she also insisted. When you do arive at the room however, you are the only one still fully dressed. Well, Bremda is in just her underwear at least. &quot;Hey, are you alright with being naked Judy?&quot; You ask as you no longer can suppress your curiosity. Judy&#39;s face display turns red indicating she is feeling embarrassed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, though I am technically not naked, as I am basically a sentient machine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, that makes sense. I guess being naked for you now would be if you removed your external casing or something, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I- well yes... please don&#39;t ask me to do that though. It is weirding me out with how embarrassed the idea of not having my casing on while out in public is making me feel...&quot;<br />
<br />
Brenda looks a bit confused by this. &quot;But your casing is transparent, so why is it embarrassing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have no idea... that is why it is so weird. It makes no sense, even to me. And that bothers the hell out of me.&quot; Says Judy, clearly anxious now about her own body. So you change the topic. &quot;Hey, what do you think Ned became? Is he still Human, or maybe an Elf? And I guess is he still male is also in question... man if he isn&#39;t a guy, then we will look like Damon&#39;s harem of women when we move around town together.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha ha, we kind of look that way even now&quot; laughs Brenda.<br />
<br />
It is Judy who asks the next question. &quot;Hey Luc... Luna, you said that the blue slime is your first child, does that mean that you have more?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, I have 9 children in total at the moment&quot; You say very proudly. &quot;The other 8 are surrounding the town as look-outs. And before you ask, they chose to do that all on their own.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;9 baby slimes. You&#39;re a really a busy mommy I guess. So who, or what, is their Daddy?&quot; Asks Judy. This is the first time someone has openly refered to you as being a Mother aside from yourself. It is a nice feeling. &quot;Um, well I guess I am? I sort of just push them out whenever I feel like I have to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that&#39;s kind of crappy. You get stuck with the pregnancy and the child and don&#39;t even get to have sex! That&#39;s quite a bullshit deal if you ask me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No no. It feels, well... it feels extremely good to give birth actually. I can cum several times from doing just that. And before I was a mother slime, I was experiencing almost non-stop pleasure for several days actually.&quot; You continue to retell how you got up to this point.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, you both really have been through quite a lot, huh. All me and Damon did is walk around for 3 days before we found this town by chance.&quot; Judy then leans back onto the floor and looks up at the ceiling. &quot;Hey, what&#39;s it like for you, being a girl now and all?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I would be lying if I said I didn&#39;t like it. It actually has been really fun so far.&quot; It is your honest answer. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hypothetically speaking, if we do somehow manage to find a way back home to our real world, would you want to go back to being a guy again, or would you want to see if we can find a way to have you stay as Luna?&quot; Asks Judy, who sits back up to look directly at you. Brenda looks at you too, as she is also interested in your response to this question.<br />
<br />
You think this question over for a while. And in fact, you are struggling to find a definitive answer to it. It reveals just how familiar you have gotten to being Luna already. You even find yourself thinking as her, using Luna to address yourself in your own head even. Even feeling such large breasts bouncing and jiggling about in your bikini armor top has become so normal to you that you don&#39;t even think about it perversly anymore.<br />
<br />
Your prolonged silence speaks volumes, and both Judy and Brenda are surprise by this. The fact that it isn&#39;t instantly answered definitely implies that you either are actually struggling to make a decision, or you already know the answer, but are too embarrassed or hesitant to say it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, um... I didn&#39;t think this would be such a difficult question for you. You don&#39;t have to answer if you don&#39;t know, or don&#39;t want to.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No, it isn&#39;t that. It is just that I am not sure which is better right now is all. I like being Luna a lot more than I thought I would is all. I haven&#39;t thought about it before now, so it took me a bit of time. I think I would have to see what the circumstances are at that time, then decide. Like if I can&#39;t take my babies with me, then I have less of an attachment to staying as Luna. But if I can, then I definitely am staying as Luna seeing as how I am their Mother and all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah I can understand that&quot; says Brenda, &quot;Anyways, it is getting late and we have to get up early tomorrow morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hearing this, you climb into bed with Brenda, much to Judy&#39;s immediate surprise. &quot;Wait, why are you sleeping together? There are 2 beds here and since I don&#39;t sleep, so I don&#39;t need one.&quot; <br />
<br />
You look at Brenda and shrug. She just pulls you in closer and explains. &quot;I like holding her when I sleep because she is squishy and makes for a great hug pillow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what you are saying is that the two of you aren&#39;t dating, yet still sleep together in the same bed? Or are you two actually in that kind of a relationship now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm, mostly the first answer. We are closer now than just being friends I guess, but it&#39;s not like we&#39;er an item or anything&quot; you reply.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you two ever... done it... with each other?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;N- uhhh... well?...&quot; you say, remembering what went down when you first reunited with Brenda.<br />
&quot;Not... um, well?...&quot; says Brenda, remembering the same event.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait a second, you two actually fucked?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorta...? But in a kind of roundabout way I guess&quot; you finally say. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it wasn&#39;t like we planned for it to go that way from the start. And at most, all I did was try and lick her pussy once. But not in a sexual way, and more so in an informative/testing way. I just wanted to get her to cum a lot.&quot; Adds Brenda, who basically just admits to doing it.<br />
<br />
&quot;It sounds like you girls had sex to me. Are you sure you two aren&#39;t dating? I mean you had sex and now sleep together regularly. That sounds like dating to me. Which I mean, it is perfectly fine if you girls are. I am just being curious is all.&quot;<br />
<br />
You and Brenda look at eachother once again and come to the same conclusion. So you say &quot;well when you put it that way... it is kinda hard to deny it. But it is weird. I never have unintentionally dated someone before. And would we be considered lesbians now? And is it considered bestiality since I am a slime?&quot; <br />
<br />
This makes Judy and Brenda laugh and the night comes to a close with Judy keeping watch while you are held by a sleeping Brenda and quietly chat with Judy since you both don&#39;t need to sleep tonight.</p>
