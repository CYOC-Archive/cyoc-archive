<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Hello,&quot; she said, as for being without her sheet covering her she stood there naked as the day she was born.<br />
<br />
&quot;Greetings,&quot; the prisoner says, the tone of his voice is of a man question why he has the good fortune of having a friendly partner staying the night.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you question my reality, let me assure you that I am real and what they made of me is as real as it gets. I was not always like this, but being a woman sent to such a prison, the warden decides how one can best be made use of, and this is what they did to me and several others women prisoners.  I hated it when they did it to me, but grew to appreciate my treatment because of the pleasuring this form helps me to do, as do so well, some prisoners have requested becoming as am I.&quot; She stood there explaining what was done and the why for, but of what she is arouses, while at the same time sends a shiver of horror along the spine.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do tell, exactly what am I, or we expected to do here during the night you came to stay and keep a new prisoner company? Please understand my sense of apprehension because what I see of you would not be my normal fare of a female companion.&quot; He asking did explain his own feeling of apprehension about her coming that night to stay and coax him to function for her.<br />
<br />
&quot;First, let me say that what you might do tonight, there is no possible chance that you could get me impregnated, we are, or I have become as permanently altered. I have become... modified physically, as became a Mule-human, a Jenny of sorts, leaving me as sterile, but owning still the monthly urge to mate as be mated. I want you to know this too, although I was so told not to disclose what your having sexual relations with me will then do to you. Although I remain as sterile, what they have done to change me to look like this, my vaginal discharge, my sex juices are highly infectious to any male human.<br />
<br />
We may talk and you can ravish my body by feeling me everywhere except to enter my vagina. You go inside me there and your male member will show drastic changing, it conforming to that what a male Mule has, of becomes enlarged like the cock of a draft horse. The differing factor of why either a Mule or a draft horse is your change, come from how the guards taint your drinking water using chemicals provided by the chief medical physician here at the prison.<br />
<br />
If there is a place known as Hell, then this prison is as Purgatory.  All of those sent here do not leave here walking uprightly, but trod away out the front gate to be loaded into a livestock truck and sold then at auction. Ultimately the same will happen to me as well, so they did inform me. As I hope you might understand about me, that prospect of me becoming in time a whole form jennet Mule is not something I look happily forward to the day I am sold like a slave to a master.<br />
<br />
When I arrived here the guards saw me as something pretty for them to handle and when feeling their inclinations, would rape me!<br />
<br />
One guard being similar to what I am, he had become deathly ill and asked the doctor to save him no matter the cost. He survived his illness but left the medical ward being a Mule-human male, is furred from head to feet, having gained a tail, a mane, pointed ears, and the muzzle like a Mule. He returned to be again a prison guard, as placed to guard the animal women, he came to me and molesting me, caused my vagina to tear from the sheer size of his mule cock.<br />
<br />
The prison doctor fixed me back to function as a female, but infected me with a equine Mule virus. I shall change in due time to become like I was born a Mule, but for the next several years, I shall be as you see me now.&quot; The Mule-woman so explained, letting the new prisoner know what to expect, no matter what was his original sentencing, his term became a life-long state of imprisonment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh and one thing more you need to know, and that being whether or not you chose to have sex with me and become infected with the Mule virus, the guards will continue to send to you various female companions of differing animal species. I have seen women changed to look like me but being as dog breeds, goats, sheep, pigs, ponies, mules, gorillas, mermaids, Minotaur, Satyrs, and African Lions.  They who are as Minotaur types or Satyrs cause their intended victim to become as are they. Satyr males and some being female get sold to sex pit wagering establishments, where they need to fight off sexual predator satyrs, who wish to rape and kill. They who are deemed as more useful by becoming a Minotaur, either male or females, the prison warden sells them to work their lives away down deep in diamond mines.<br />
<br />
Now you know, so consider you future fate, and choose wisely, as sometime after being infected you will so change, and become an animal for sale. If you like what you see of me and wish to someday have as enjoy owning your mule big cock, then I am your woman!&quot; She said, having informed her possible mate as to what he had the one choice to determine his future.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell me, why were you sent here, what was your crime, mine was that I stole, I am a thief.&quot; Said a nervous prisoner having something unexpected and unafordable as his need to choose what would happen to him no matter how he might try to ignore his present reality.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jaywalking in the state capitol, and being pretty, as female, and after they discovered I had no living family relatives, I became what you see me as tonight!&quot; She replied.</p>
