<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As everyone near and far from across the lands of the enchanting beast of all kinds, to the lords and ladies from the land, sky, and the seas of neighboring kingdoms were dancing and setting the gifts on a table in the grand hall while they ate their fill on princess Aurora&#39;s coronation that the toad king with his beautiful swan queen, sir John braveheart with Ciela, the jaguar, the human sized red dragon, Merlin the wise with Melida Bowen, and more of the grope were going through the same possess for it was some time later on the suggestions on what to do before sundown within a secret meeting. Everything was going ever so smoothly for Aurora&#39;s coronation ceremony As things progress to what they were before on being normal, like it was nothing to worry about in the slightest while there was a hint of fear for the princess to what she shall be when the sun begins to set at sundown that she&#39;ll be in a form of a dragon. with some time on this day left that everyone was lucky for it was still noon for the coronation went on while secretly talking amongst themselves about helping her out and watching her back to each of their best capable abilities as the princess was wondering on just one thing, just how well her coronation was going to be?<br />
<br />
Not only was she going to be to be kicked out of her own kingdom as this was for her own safety that she was soon going to be turned into a dragon for she&#39;ll have to start living with others of her new kin species by sunset, and she was scared by this. It was shortly after when the princess was hearing the priests calling out for her, like he lost someone and couldn&#39;t find that someone as the priest found her in her living chambers. Quickly changing into her new clothes for this joyous occasion that Aurora knew why, it was time for the coronation ceremony to begin as everyone was now waiting for her in the grand hall.<br />
<br />
It took her awhile to change out of the gown she was wearing, and into her beautiful coronation dress as Aurora was then walked down the hallways. Stunning as she was that once she was slowly making her way down the stairs to the grand hall is when she heard the ceremony of the coronation music starting by each passing steps her high heel shoes took her. She took her tim as she didn&#39;t want to rush this for Aurora was soon enough done fron the stairs while entering the grand hall throne that the coronation was taking place, even if she was walking to it with grace and beauty. once at the throne chair, she turned around dramatically that her cape made a flashy impression before being seated as this was the part of her being officially crowned princess.<br />
<br />
The grand bishop was waiting for her to be seated for the bishop was than handed the tiara crown from a red pillow from one of the gaurds as it was slowly placed onto princess Aurora&#39;s head, followed by being handed two items within each hand. in one hand as the left held the sceptre with a beautiful gem color that glimmered in the sun light to show off many rainbow beams of light which made the kingdom&#39;s people in aw, while in the other hand for in the right is where she was holding a golden shape ball like sphere of an orb with what looks like a gold snowflake mounted on top of it. With the bishop leaving the throne chair area, the Sargent the the gaurd started to give commands of the troops and having them stand in a positioning of two rows while in place of her Majesty as the drums began to beat.<br />
<br />
To sound the drum of an army man for the coronation ceremony sounds appropriate for this occasion as the sargent was calling out to what any army man would say, untill they were in their stands. &quot;FORWARD MARTCH! LEFT RIGHT LEFT! LEFT RIGHT LEFT! LEFT RIGHT LEFT! LEFT! LEFT! LEFT RIGHT LEFT! LEFT! LEFT! COMPANY, HOLT!&quot;<br />
<br />
Even as sir John braveheart with Ciela, the jaguar by each of her sides that this was her moment, and her moment to shine as she wondered what it would be like for her queens coronation. Shortly after, the grand bishop announced the arrival of the princess. &quot;Ladies and gentlemen! Lords from kingdoms across the lands, the seas, and of the skies! We are gathered here today to witness, the crowning of our new princess! And so, without any further ado... I present to you all, princess Aurora!&quot;<br />
<br />
It was then that everyone celebrated and cheered for the arrival of the princess as she started to stand up. &quot;SWORDS UP, AT THE READY!&quot; The sargent of the army said that the swords were partially released from the Scabbards, before fully drawn out as they were risen high enough for the tip of one sword was barely touching anothers for it was then the princess took her first few steps down the rows of sword raised gaurds.<br />
<br />
Kindly walking down as if it were and alley, countinuing is when she spots one sticking out to low that it was a young centaur. Though may be young, a taller gaurd helped the younging out by lifting the sword up that the centaur&#39;s arms were up over the youngs head to reach the other&#39;s sword tip. This pleases Aurora as she nods to the gaurd who helped that the gaurd kindly nodded back to her with a salute while continuing down her path, until she reached the end of the rowed gaurds from the bishop was waiting.<br />
<br />
Once to the end of the rows as the gaurds were now behind her shirt their swords and shethed them back into their scabbards that Aurora kindly handed the orb, and sceptre to the grand bishop. Everyone was pleased for the ceremony that the next announcement came not from the bishop, but from sir John braveheart&#39;s orders was the toad king... with his beautiful swan queen to help hold his tongue from talking to much of a speach. &quot;AND NOW, IT IS TIME FOR OUR NEW PRINCESS TO DANCE THE FIRST DANCE.&quot;<br />
<br />
Taking a deep breath for relief that this was a big decision to make for there can be only one to choose from. Whoever she chooses first will break the others heart as this was going to be her first step with someone through out the kingdom of all the lands, the seas, and of the skies. So the question was, who will be with princess Aurora&#39;s coronation first dance?</p>
