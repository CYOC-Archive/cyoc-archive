<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Ok, so, mom, I wish to be a professional wrestler!&quot; Patrick said. Jeanie was a little surprised but it was something that she could manage. &quot;Very well, then I need you to change those clothes. You can&#39;t wrestle in those pants!&quot; She winked and Patrick&#39;s old and dirty clothes turned into a white wrestling singlet. &quot;Wow! That was amazing! My clothes had turned into another ones!&quot; Jeanie was happy that Patrick reacted very well to her powers. &quot;Now, I will give you some decent shoes!&quot; Then, she winked again and Patrick&#39;s old shoes turned into a pair of wrestling shoes.<br />
&quot;Hey! These shoes are way too big for me!&quot; Patrick yelled. &quot;I won&#39;t be able to fight whit these!&quot; Jeanie just smiled and she happily touched Patrick&#39;s nose. &quot;That&#39;s why those shoes are for professional wrestlers, my son.&quot; She said. &quot;And now, it&#39;s time to continue with you!&quot; She put her hands on Patrick&#39;s small legs and made them to glow.<br />
Muscles started to bulge from Patrick&#39;s small legs until he had muscles on every place around his legs. Then she put her hands on his arms and did the same. She did the same with his chest and back. At the end, Patrick looked like a miniature professional wrestler. &quot;Wow! It was real&quot; Patrick said. &quot;You&#39;re a real genie, mom!&quot;<br />
&quot;I told you, honey&quot; Jeanie said. &quot;But I haven&#39;t finished. It&#39;s time to end the process!&quot; After that she gave him a kiss on his cheek. Some magic sparks were floating around her lips and they traveled to Patrick&#39;s skin. He started to glow and he felt he was becoming bigger.<br />
His small legs and arms were becoming larger. His chest and back were getting a V-shape and his neck was becoming thicker. He saw how his hands were getting bigger and stronger and he used them to feel his face changes. His nose became wider, his eyebrows were thicker and his jaw grew squarer and heavier. Finally, his small bulge grew until it he got a decent endowment.<br />
&quot;Wow! You make me older!&quot; Patrick said in a new deeper voice. &quot;Of course, professional wrestlers are grown ups. And, that&#39;s reminds me you will need this.&quot; Jeanie said and she made a jockstrap to appear in the air. She winked and it went directly to Patrick&#39;s crotch where it cross the singlet and take its proper position.<br />
&quot;What was that?&quot; Patrick asked. &quot;It&#39;ll help you to be secure. You&#39;re my son now and I will protect you at any cost.&quot; Patrick smiled and he gave his mom a strong hug. She could be hurted but using her magic she was able to handle it. &quot;Now, I will turn you back and we can take a walk.&quot;<br />
&quot;No, mom.&quot; Patrick said. &quot;Please, let me stay like this for a while.&quot;<br />
&quot;Ok, but you must hold my hand all the time!&quot; She said. Patrick nodded and he gave his big left hand to his mom who hold it using her smaller than him hand. They began to walk when Patrick wondered that his new shoes weren&#39;t unconfortable anymore. &quot;That&#39;s because you&#39;re bigger, honey.&quot;<br />
Patrick smiled and took off his shoes to reveal his new feet size, four times bigger than his older feet. He was too excited that he asked his mother to stay barefoot during their walk. Jeanie accepted but she made his feet more resistent than regular ones, so she would be sure he won&#39;t be hurt.<br />
They walked for a while until they reach a big park with a lot of people, kids and adults and some places to stay and play. Patrick saw a sandbox where a few kids were playing and he insisted to Jeanie to play there. She accepted and suggested that it was better to turn him back to his former self, but Patrick denied. Jeanie thought for a moment and she accepted it but she made that anybody will fright because of seeing a grown man playing in the sandbox.<br />
Patrick happily went there and he began to play with the sand. He tried to sat but his new body was too big to let him sit like he usually did, so he extended his legs and fell on the place. The other kids were playing like if it wasn&#39;t odd, but due to Patrick occupied a big space, some kids left the sandbox until one boy was left with Patrick.<br />
&quot;Hi! My name is Patrick!&quot; He said to the other kid who was playing with the sand between his legs.<br />
&quot;Hi, I&#39;m Theodore!&quot; The othe kid said. &quot;Why are you wearing that?&quot;<br />
&quot;Because I&#39;m a professional wrestler!&quot; Patrick proudly said. &quot;And I have this hard thing in my pee-pee too which protect me.&quot;<br />
&quot;Protect you from what?&quot; Theodore asked.<br />
&quot;From another wrestlers!&quot; Patrick said.<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t see any other wrestler around here.&quot; Theodore said.<br />
&quot;Umm... I think you&#39;re right.&quot; Patrick said a little bit sad.<br />
&quot;I could be a wrestler and play with you!&quot; Theodore said.<br />
&quot;What a great idea!&quot; Patrick said. &quot;I&#39;ll ask my mom to turn you into one.&quot; Theodore didn&#39;t understand what Patrick wanted to say with that but he nodded. Patrick made a signal to his mom and she teleported to him in a flash.<br />
&quot;What do you want, honey?&quot; Jeanie asked to Patrick.<br />
&quot;My friend Theodore wants to be wrestler too. Can you turn him into one, please?&quot; He said with a cute puppy face a little bit awkward for his manly jaw. She can&#39;t resist to a face like that and she knew that she had made that no one would notice this as something weird, so she thought that it won&#39;t be a problem. She winked and Theodore clothes turned into a blue singlet.<br />
&quot;As you are in the sandbox, I don&#39;t think you will need shoes. So, let&#39;s make this quickly&quot; She said and created a jockstrap from her hands. It was smaller than the one she had made for her son, but it was because Theodore still was kid. The jockstrap flew until it was on Theodore&#39;s pee-pee.<br />
&quot;It feels funny!&quot; Theodore said as he saw magic sparks covering him. Quickly, he was getting height and muscles. His legs and arms became big and strong. His chest and back did the same. His neck grew thicker and his jaw became squarer.<br />
His small kid feet grew until they were as big as Patrick&#39;s ones. Then, he felt a sudden pain on his crotch.<br />
&quot;Ugh. It&#39;s too small&quot; He said as he felt that his pee-pee was growing but his jockstrap wasn&#39;t. Jeanie saw it and made it to increase its size until it fitted his new member. She was a little bit amazed because she didn&#39;t knew too much about ageing, specially on men.<br />
&quot;We can wrestle now, Theo!&quot; Patrick said. &quot;Thanks, mom! We&#39;ll be playing in the sandbox for a while!&quot; Jeanie nodded and returned to the bench were she was.<br />
&quot;I think I need to learn more about human people, men and growing up if I want to raise my son&quot; She thought.</p>
