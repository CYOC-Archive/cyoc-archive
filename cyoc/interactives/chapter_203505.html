<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">~~~ <b>Kelly</b> ~~~<br />
<br />
We lay together in silence for several minutes, enjoying the afterglow. I was also relishing how light my vixen felt atop me. Joe was, in fact, larger now than he had been as a human. But to me she was like a fluffy pillow. A little ship rocked by the swells of my breasts, borne up and down by my steady breathing. It made me feel powerful... and protective. While the werevixen had claws and teeth, muscle and more than enough agility to take down any human, she was still a frail fox next to the mighty wolf I had become.<br />
<br />
<i>My</i> fox.<br />
<br />
I felt her shifting, her movement sending tingles through my nipples as she brushed against them. She was rolling over onto her stomach, and soon her breasts were pushed against mine. Our breathing quickened at the mutual friction on our boobs. My dick twitched a little and peeked out of its sheath again as a fresh wash of hot liquid washed over it and my cum factories below; Joe pressing her rounded belly into me was squeezing more of the overabundant cum from her insides. But we were too tired to get really aroused again. Or at least I was.<br />
<br />
I lifted my right arm and laid it gently across her back, stroking her soft fur. Thinking how wonderful it was to <i>have</i> fur. Joe buried her head below mine, nuzzling my neck, and I tilted my head down so that my muzzle lay against the top of her head, making her black ears flick.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you, Kelly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you too, Joe.&quot;<br />
<br />
She sighed, and laid quiet for a bit as I petted her. Then she spoke.<br />
<br />
~~~ <b>Joe</b> ~~~<br />
<br />
I snuggled into Kelly, feeling our boobs compress together as our lungs filled. I still kind of wanted more sex, but I knew she was tired. I remembered what it was like as a guy, how it could ache if you pushed out another orgasm too soon, and Kelly had come three times in quick succession. Maybe she was just super-virile, maybe it was being a canine, but whatever; I didn&#39;t want to push her. I was okay to just relax for a bit too.<br />
<br />
Of course... It occurred to me that with the ring she could have herself ready to go again immediately. But... while the craving was there, I guess I did feel more like cuddling than rutting at the moment. The thought did remind me, however, that I needed to say a couple of things about the ring.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kelly?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When I got the ring, the witch or whatever told me to wish that it could never be removed from my finger by anyone else. I think you should do the same.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot; Kelly lifted her hand from my back. &quot;I wish that nobody else besides me can take this ring off. And... I also wish it looked fancier.&quot;<br />
<br />
I turned my head, so that I could look up at her ring finger with a curious eye. The brass brightened to gold, and a sparkling gem -- a diamond -- appeared on it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Better,&quot; she rumbled. I giggled.<br />
<br />
&quot;I never would have thought to do that, my big sexy wolfess.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s because you&#39;re an airheaded slut who can only think about sex,&quot; she teased as she laid her hand back on me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nooooo,&quot; I protested. &quot;I&#39;m not! At least I wasn&#39;t.&quot; I lifted myself up a bit so I could look into her eyes. With a hint of real concern, I asked, &quot;That wasn&#39;t part of your wish, was it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, girl,&quot; she soothed me as her hand stroked the fur down my spine. &quot;I wished for you to be a slut, not a bimbo. You&#39;re a clever, intelligent girl like a fox should be. You just really love sex, &#39;specially with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s fine.&quot; I nuzzled back under her chin, satisfied. Though that did bring another concern to the fore, I had something else to tell her. &quot;So, about the ring; you can also make wishes in your mind, without talking.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmkay, good to have confirmation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Confirmation?&quot;<br />
<br />
She chuckled. &quot;I did make a mental wish that you could take all my seed. Didn&#39;t want my little vixen to pop.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh!&quot; I laughed. &quot;That was very sweet of you. My wolfess. But, mm, that reminds me... you... wished for me to be in heat, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmhm.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That means you want me to carry your puppies, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pups. Or cubs.&quot; She paused. &quot;Or maybe kits since you&#39;re a fox. But yeah?&quot; Now she was the one to sound concerned. &quot;That is okay with you, right? I could wish --&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no!&quot; I said quickly, slipping my arms around her as best I could and squeezing in reassurance. &quot;I <i>want</i> your babies! So bad! A nice... big litter.&quot; I sighed, a little dreamy as my nipples twinged at the thought of the cute little ones suckling them. &quot;It&#39;s just... Can wolves and foxes even mate? I-I mean, foxes are a different species, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we aren&#39;t exactly <i>regular</i> wolves and foxes,&quot; she answered with a laugh. &quot;Still, I suppose to be safe... I wish that all werebeasts can breed with each other. And that the seed in my vixen&#39;s belly right now will take.&quot;<br />
<br />
I smiled in satisfaction, feeling the tingle in my womb. Then I nudged against her arm, making her lift it. I rolled off her side onto my back, the muscles of her thick upper arm providing a firm pillow.<br />
<br />
<i>God she&#39;s so powerful,</i> I thought as I felt the meaty bulk beneath me. Making me feel so safe. So happy for the future I would have, as the mother of her pups.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s kind of crazy,&quot; I murmured, laying my hands on my belly. &quot;Just an hour ago. I was a man. Now I... I&#39;m going to be a... <i>mother.</i>&quot; I shivered out another sigh, my tail wagging a bit against the grass. Kelly reached across herself, and placed her big hands over my slender ones. Together we stroked the low, taut dome of my belly; both of us imagining it even larger, rounder, full of a new generation of little werepups.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I guess that means I&#39;m going to be the father.&quot; Kelly chuckled. &quot;<i>That&#39;s</i> certainly something I wasn&#39;t expecting when I woke up this morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
She hitched me up a little, turning her head to face me. I craned my head up, and the ends of our muzzles met.<br />
<br />
A long, gently passionate kiss later, we laid back again, with me nestled in the crook of her arm. Her big hand cradled one of my lower breasts. I loved how her fingers could practically wrap around it, despite it being, what, a very full C-cup? She was sooo <i>big</i>! It really made me wet, and I was thinking about trying to seduce her into more sex -- really remind me that I was a woman, a vixen; <i>her</i> vixen -- when she brought up the ring again.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, you said an old lady gave you the ring. What did you do to test it? To confirm it was actually magical?&quot;<br />
<br />
...Uh-oh. <i>That</i> question was not one I was expecting, or wanted to hear, and it definitely drove away thoughts of sex for the moment.</p>
