<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Mr Powell, going on a lunch strike?” A voice said from behind. Alexis now rotated to face the voice realised who it was,<br />
“Miss Thorne, n-no...” Alexis replied, relieved it was only his Math teacher, “I’m sorry, I was just...” he struggled to think of an excuse. He saw Miss Thorne’s foot tapping on the ground. She had her arms crossed too, giving him a look of impatience. He eventually gave in, failing to find a valid excuse, “I don’t have much of an excuse, Miss Thorne,”<br />
“Well then, get to the cafeteria. You’re not one to cause trouble, Mr Powell, so I’ll let this slide,” she said, offering her hand to lift him out of his seat. He took it and allowed her to pull him up, “if I’m correct, you have a class with me in your next period?” She asked him,<br />
Alexis pondered for a moment before confirming, “yeah, that’s right,”<br />
“Excellent,” she replied, starting to walk away, “I’ll guide you to the cafeteria,” she said. Alexis wasn’t one to back talk, especially to a teacher.<br />
As they walked down the hall, Alexis gazed over at her. Miss Thorne being only an inch or so shorter than Alexis, he caught a glimpse of her chest. He always forgot how well endowed she was. If he hadn’t seen her in person, he wouldn’t have noticed. He looked away before she could notice, but his mind was flooded with images. After his last interaction, he wondered just how large they would look if her sweater wasn’t so loose.<br />
And with that, he realised what he had done. Her sweater slowly began getting tighter. Not smaller, tighter. Her chest was becoming more and more visible, silhouetted by her figure hugging sweater. They were large alright, around the same size he’d left June. She still hadn’t noticed. So out of pure inspiration, he focussed on her skirt. It was already pretty tight, but he made it tighter. It outlined her butt perfectly, showing the transition from thigh-to-butt-to-back. He wanted to just looked at it all happening, but as they approached the cafeteria, he averted his gaze. And in doing so, he realised she was looking at him. Embarrassed, he timidly finished the journey,<br />
“T-thank you, Miss Thorne,” he said, not looking up from the ground,<br />
“Don’t worry... um... Alexis,” she replied, forgetting his name for a split second, “enjoy your lunch,” she said, before walking to two doors. She was clearly unsure of which door she needed to go through. She ended up walking back the way she came, out of sight from Alexis. <br />
<br />
Alexis was very surprised for one reason. Miss Thorne never forgets names.<br />
Ever since he started, she had never forgotten his name once, nor anyone else’s name. Not to mention she had an amazing memory. No assignments were ever forgotten in her classroom. So for her to forget his name, and which door she needed to go through. Very, very odd.<br />
<br />
Alexis made his was down the steps and to the lunch hall. Each table filled with groups, whether they be friends or otherwise. He found his table, filled with his friends. And a familiar face.<br />
“Justin, good to see you again,” Alexis said, sitting down at the table. Justin looked distracted by his thoughts, “everything good?”<br />
“Hm?” Justin replied, looking up, “oh. Hey Alexis,”<br />
Brie tapped Alexis on the shoulder, “I wouldn’t talk to him, he’s not in a great mood,” she whispered,<br />
“I’m not deaf!” Justin said loudly, slapping his hands into the table. Some of the kids from other tables stopped what they were doing just to see the commotion, “just- just- just leave me alone!” He said quieter. He pushed himself out of the table and stormed his way to the back exit.<br />
Alexis knew what was wrong, and he also knew that that door wasn’t going to open without a loud noise. His friend was drawing enough attention to himself as is. Thinking quickly, he tried using his power to make Justin forget everything that happened. June, the bathroom, anything and everything that was bothering him.<br />
And just like that, Justin snapped out of it. He shook his head, confused as to why he had just got stomped his way to the back of the cafeteria. He quickly made his way back to the table,<br />
“Hey...” he started, “what was that all about?” He asked the group,<br />
“W-what?” Barry asked,<br />
“That. Why did I just storm off?” He asked again, “I know I was pissed but for the life of me, I cannot remember!” He replied,<br />
“That was bizarre,” Toni said,<br />
“You can say that again,” Wilson added, “so you just got up in a fit of rage...”<br />
“And then totally forgot everything?” Michael finished,<br />
“Pretty much,” Justin said, sitting back, taking it all in, “what a weird experience,” he said, running his hands through his hair.<br />
“Weird...” Alexis said idly,<br />
“Agreed,” Justin said.<br />
<br />
As lunch ended, Alexis and his friends finished up their meals (excusing Alexis, who didn’t get anything), and then made their way back down the hall.<br />
“You sure you’re not hungry, Alex?” Justin asked,<br />
“Yeah, I’m fine,” Alexis replied, “I had a big breakfast,” Alexis added,<br />
“Well, suit yourself,” Justin said. Just as he said it, the bells rang, and the next period was about to begin.<br />
“I’ll see you tomorrow, man,” Alexis said, knowing he wouldn’t see Justin until the next day,<br />
“You too!” Justin said, giving Alexis a fist bump as they parted. But as they were beginning to walk away, Justin went “oh!” Alexis turned back around, seeing the kids around him head to their respective classes, Justin said, “make the most of your birthday! You’re only eighteen once!” He finished, making finger guns with his hands as he started walking away,<br />
Alexis chuckled, “of course. See you tomorrow.”</p>
