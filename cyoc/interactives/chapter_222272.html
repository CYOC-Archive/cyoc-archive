<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was already after midnight as Susan double checked the clock behind the bar which told everyone the legal drinking age. She had served a few people who turned 21 just a couple minutes earlier but that was normal enough. The place was still packed but those people who started their night at Mermaid’s cove headed out to other bars while the second wave of those who started other places arrived. <br />
That was normal, what wasn’t normal was that she should have gone on her lunch break almost 20 minutes ago. She should have been almost finished with lunch and getting ready to go to replace Matt so he could take his lunch break. <br />
<br />
Overall aside from Amber&#39;s disappearance it was a normal night, maybe there had been more people acting up a bit. She had seen more then a few people touching themselves or others which while not totally uncommon it was strange to be happening in such high numbers but that along with the other small strange stuff was fading from Susan&#39;s mind, she just wanted to go on break and have something to eat.<br />
<br />
“Where is Amber?” inquired Matt as he handed another tray of mixed drinks to her. <br />
<br />
“Don’t know, I saw her heading backstage.” Stated Susan, Amber should have gone backstage, changed out of her mermaid tail and take her own lunch break. When she finished, she would take Susan’s spot so she could go to lunch, and she would then take Matt’s spot before Amber went back into the water for the rest of the night. That was what was normally done so that two people were always behind the bar but Amber hadn’t come out yet even though her lunch break should have been over a while ago and out here.<br />
<br />
“Go back and check on her.” Said Matt “I’ll hand things out here.”<br />
<br />
“Alright.” Confirmed Susan as she went backstage toward the changing rooms and the break room. She checked the break room to see if Amber had just fallen asleep or something, others had done that but the break room was empty. So she headed toward the changing room.<br />
The room was set up with multiple lockers and changing areas for each girl but it also had two exits, one leading out into the hall and the other leading out into the ocean itself. It made it easier for the women once they had their tails on to get about if they went straight into the water.<br />
<br />
As Susan approached the door, she could hear moaning and the like coming from the room. <br />
<br />
“Great…” complained Susan as she knocked and entered the room, there had been times when for the right price one of her coworkers brought back someone into the changing room for some “fun” it wasn’t allowed and the owner came down hard if he found out. He tended not to find out.<br />
<br />
“Amber are you in here.” Said Susan as she walked in with her head down, she expected to hear the normal sounds of embarrassment and the mad rush of two people trying to cover themselves. Instead she heard more moaning.<br />
<br />
“Amber…” said Susan as she raised her eyes slowly, ready to lower them the moment she caught a look at Amber. Instead her eyes widened as she saw a single finger lying on the ground near the small pool which was located by the door leading out into the ocean.<br />
<br />
“AMBER!” yelled Susan as her head snapped up, she expected to find Amber had fallen and knocked herself out. But as she bent down beside her friend and coworker she noticed Amber wasn’t moaning from pain but from pleasure. <br />
<br />
Susan’s eyes widened; Amber was on her back one hand grabbing her breast while the other was going to town on her women hood. That would be unsettling enough but her friend was changing before her eyes. <br />
<br />
Amber had always been a pretty woman, she was a natural red head with a good-looking face and a tone frame, slightly small on the breast side but with a smile that disarmed many of men and women alike. Since was a natural red head, she normally wore a red mermaid tail and for a moment Susan thought she still had it on. However that tail was resting on the back of a nearby chair and none of the tails had looked this realist. <br />
<br />
Amber’s legs had stretched out at least another foot and a half and were still human at the bottom of her feet but her ankle had fused together along with the rest of her legs. There was no sign of legs in there, like one would expect in a costume and the way she was bending it would have been impossible with legs in it. The scales were beautiful with a mix of vibrant reds and some dark reds with some bronze mixed in. Amber’s hand was going in and out of a slit in the scales where her womenhood would normally be as she fingered herself. The scales went up to her hips and it wasn’t a clean break or even a membrane like one would see in the movies. Some of the scales went as high as her bully button. <br />
<br />
Her upper body was also shifting, getting sexier by the moment.<br />
<br />
Any fault in her skin was disappearing and her tone was even sexier as her modest breasts grew at least a cup size right in front of Susan. Amber was still playing with herself as she arched her back, letting Susan see some of the scales on Amber’s back and a thin membrane of red ran under her armpits. Amber’s neck seamed longer, her face became one that a super model would dream of having as her lips turned fuller and her eyes seamed larger even as her now bright green eyes rolled back in her head as she reached a climax. <br />
<br />
Amber’s red hair was still red, but instead of a natural red it looked like a bright red from an animated show or movie. An impossible red to get even with coloring but it was changing right before Susan’s eyes as Amber let out one last load moan as she climaxed before laying flat on her back. <br />
<br />
Susan looked down toward Amber’s feet, they had spread out into a mermaid’s tail fin as Amber turned her head toward Susan and looked her dead in the eyes. Was that lust in Amber’s now impossible neon green eyes or just the afterglow of her pleasuring herself as she became.<br />
<br />
“You’re a mermaid…an actual mermaid.” Said Susan not sure what to do next.</p>
