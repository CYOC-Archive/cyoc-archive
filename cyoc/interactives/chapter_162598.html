<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Bright was the thoughts of then Jared to advise a loving father that a miracle of transformation had come to being a reality. Jasper knew then of the man and recalled the kind treatment as given.<br />
<br />
A sharp sounding whinny was what the man heard and as well did Jared. The human son turned to being an animal of form, had forgot that with wishing to offer a greeting, the manner of greeting was limited mostly to a whinny.<br />
<br />
“Well, hello to you, whoever you are, as by all that is holy you are the exact double of my prize winning stallion, I named as Jasper.” Bob Morrison said, he speaking as more talking for his own sense of surprise.<br />
<br />
Jared stood eyeing at his father, while feeling befuddled at the lacking of the ability to speak and address his dad of what all had happened.<br />
<br />
“Jared,” Jasper spoke mentally to his partner, “Try using a fore-hoof to writing, scrawling in the corral sand!”<br />
<br />
Jared stepped back from standing with his horse head as close to the face of his father. He then turned in a circle, this being a common movement done by an animal trying to decide. As a half length of his body standing away from the corral fence, Jasper the horse stood calmly, and then raised his left foreleg.<br />
<br />
The many movements done by Jasper had drawn renewed interest by the man, by the dad, Bob Morrison. He stood up to standing on the lower rail or the four rail high corral fence, and was amazed to see the stallion drawing something in the corral sands.<br />
<br />
Mildred and Tilda were as much intrigued by the oddity of what the stallion was doing, and the two mares walked closer to get a look.<br />
<br />
“What are you doing,” Bob muttered as he watched the big black horse continue to making markings using a hoof in the corral sand. Wishing to see better what the horse was doing, Bob slipped between the fence rails and walked to then stand beside the stallion. As Mildred then came to hanging her head over the right shoulder of Bob, and Tilda standing just to his left side, all were present for the unveiled viewing.<br />
<br />
“HOWDY THERE DAD   SOMETHING HAPPENED   JARED  OR ME   I  BECAME  AS  WAS  JASPER” Bob read, as then with a glaring stare he turned to look at the stallion, to see the horse nodding his head as if to be saying “Yes, as all true!”<br />
<br />
Jared watched as if in slow motion his father’s eyes closed and he fell over backwards, having fainted at the reality his son had become a horse.<br />
<br />
Mildred and Tilda had seen enough and wheeled quickly to run toward the far side of the corral.<br />
<br />
Jared with Jasper stood over the stunned man, as his son wanted to be of help ad reawaken his did, it was then that Jasper gained a gleeful thought. Jared was so upset he paid no attention to what Jasper was doing with their body; or didn’t until Jared felt, as heard the sound of splattering urine being released from a full bladder, as Jasper stood there pissing a warm stream about the face of the man lying there on the ground beneath the horse body.<br />
<br />
“NO Jasper, what you are doing is thought by people to be as disgusting!” Jared thought, and Jasper heard, but it was Bob when he awoke that opened his eyes seeing he was being pissed-on to awakening.<br />
<br />
Angry, Bob rolled from under the yellow frothing bath of horse urine and in a scramble of arms and legs he returned to a standing position. “Blast you, whatever had you to do that to awake me from having fainted?” Bob asked as if still talking, as bitching at his foolhardy son.<br />
<br />
SORRY  DAD  JASPER  MY  HORSE  SELF  HALF THOUGHT  TO  BE  AS  HELPFUL Jared wrote, as his father did not believe or know what to believe.<br />
<br />
“Okay, come with me, you need to get cleaned down low; oh and what was that tonguing licking of Mildred’s vulva, did you revel of the flavor tasting, or was that Jasper’s idea?” Bob asked, but did not wait for Jared to scrawl an answer. He opened the corral gate and with a wave of his arm he motioned for the stallion to exit the corral and head for the barn. Mildred and her pony companion decided to stay in the corral, as if the happenings were to them as troubling.<br />
<br />
Jasper did as his dad so directed, and with Jared taking control of the horse body, he followed along behind his dad walking toward the barn. As with entering the barn, Jared walked to where Jasper was bedded inside a 15x15 foot square box stall.<br />
<br />
Jared waited for what he knew his father had as planned, a need of doing, that after a stallion bred a mare his genitals required a washing with warm water and a mild, disinfecting soap.  Jasper recalled many hundreds of times when the man had aroused the stallion while washing his cock.<br />
<br />
“Stand easy son, I mean Jasper, so just how did this happen?” Bob Morrison asked, and when Jasper whinnied, the dumbfounded father then laughed; “Can’t talk, needs to write, we need to remember that!”</p>
