<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Curtis couldn&#39;t help but laugh as Ollie squirmed in his seat while the goat barber worked. He fiddled with his phone and he had his headphones on, so he hoped it looked like he was lost in his music--a new normal for him. He couldn&#39;t stop snickering, though, as he stole the occasional glance. The whole situation was adorable as the goat had to basically restrain the sheep to keep him still. He snapped a quick picture for himself, and to maybe show the other guys. Maybe.<br />
<br />
They had stopped by the local barber-shop: <i>Baa-ber Cuts</i> before Ollie had to go to class since he had work that evening, and the look Gerard had given him when they walked in! The high-strung goat almost looked offended as he hurriedly pushed Ollie into a chair and got to work. They tried to explain what they&#39;d done and that the shaver had looked different that morning, but Gerard wouldn&#39;t have it. &quot;Next time come straight to me. This wool is too valuable to mangle like that!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Valuable?!&quot; Ollie mouthed before he was unceremoniously spun to face the mirror.<br />
<br />
Half-an-hour later, Ollie was showing off his new look with a smirk. He grabbed Curtis&#39; hand and pressed it on his head. &quot;Feel. It&#39;s so fuckin&#39; soft! I bought some of the shampoo. Do you like Lavender? Smell!&quot; The smell was strong, but Curtis liked it. He liked it more coming from Ollie&#39;s fur than directly from the bottle, though, as he sniffed with his sensitive nose. After his muzzle had pushed out it was like his nose had opened up to a new dimension of possibility. It was a little overwhelming, and he kept getting distracted trying to place a particular smell, but he was starting to get used to it.<br />
<br />
Ollie nudged him with one of his shoulders as they walked back to campus. &quot;I saw you laughin, Dog. Don&#39;t think for a second I didn&#39;t.&quot; Curtis&#39; ears flattened as he felt guilty, but Ollie&#39;s wink let him off the hook. <i>Good. He didn&#39;t know about the picture.</i><br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry...it was just so cute. I couldn&#39;t help it.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yer good. Do you like my new &#39;do? I&#39;m not used to it bein so short, but he buzzed it all off! I wonder how fast it&#39;ll grow back.&quot; Ollie kept running his hand through the wooly hair as Curtis nodded.<br />
<br />
<i>It&#39;s buzzcut season anyway</i><br />
<br />
&quot;It looks great, Olls. Especially with your horns. I wonder how big they&#39;ll get!&quot; Curtis was genuinely curious as he didn&#39;t have any comparison point.<br />
<br />
&quot;I dunno. I hope they&#39;re not too heavy, yanno?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll be perfect.&quot;<br />
<br />
His pocket buzzed and he pulled out his phone.<br />
<br />
Mom<br />
&#39;Thinking of you! I hope classes are going well. Miss you lots. Love you! Call me soon.&#39;<br />
<br />
Curtis responded without thinking:<br />
<br />
&#39;Classes are great so far! Love you and miss you too.&#39;<br />
<br />
He stopped and looked at the message. His mom <i>never</i> just texted him out of the blue like this. She would only call when she needed something, and if he didn&#39;t answer right away she would keep calling until he did. He scrolled back at the unfamiliar conversation, feeling strangely warm and nostalgic? Little check-ins and silly GIFs and pictures traded back and forth. A blurry picture began to clear in his mind...<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Dog. Lost in the smells again?&quot; Ollie was waving in his face with a grin. &quot;We gotta hurry or I&#39;ll be late to class. I didn&#39;t think it&#39;d take so long to just shear everything off!&quot;<br />
<br />
Curtis blinked, &quot;Sorry.&quot; He fell back into step beside Ollie as he fidgeted with his phone. He felt dizzy, though it was probably just the sudden unease. And the strong Lavender coming from his boyfriend. He stopped again, he felt his heart pounding in his ears and the telltale signs of a minor panic attack. &quot;Sorry, I need to sit down for a moment...You can go ahead if you need.&quot; He panted and walked unsteadily to the curb to take a seat and catch his breath.<br />
<br />
&quot;Curtis, are you OK? What&#39;s the matter?&quot; Ollie was next to him as Curtis felt his ears ring. He breathed deeply for a moment as the sheep rubbed his back. This helped to calm him.<br />
<br />
<i>His mom always rubbed his back when he was feeling stressed...</i> No? She wasn&#39;t a particularly physical person. She had barely given him a hug before he left for college. <i>The way she lightly ran her claws against his back to tickle him.</i><br />
<br />
&quot;Ollie, ...have you noticed anything weird going on? Besides the obvious, I mean.&quot; Curtis felt weird verbalizing it, but Ollie had always been the one he could tell anything.<br />
<br />
<i>I&#39;m the one you tell your fears to<br />
There&#39;ll never be enough of us</i><br />
<br />
Ollie looked concerned. &quot;What do you mean? Do you need to see a doctor or somethin?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No. I mean. I keep having these weird thoughts that don&#39;t make sense. Or at least they don&#39;t make sense at first, but then they do. It&#39;s really confusing.&quot; Curtis hoped he was communicating it properly. It sounded crazy but Ollie gave him a serious look that made him feel sane.<br />
<br />
&quot;Memories?&quot; The word was loaded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, actually. I know Felix mentioned things would start to make sense, and apparently Stripes has said something similar to the other guys, but I just assumed it would be like what I&#39;m supposed to eat or how to avoid getting my tail caught in doors. I didn&#39;t expect...this.&quot; He showed his phone to Ollie, who simply gave a dark nod. &quot;I don&#39;t think this is my mom.&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>(And nothing&#39;s wrong, when nothing&#39;s true)</i><br />
<br />
Ollie sighed and dropped his head for a moment. He shook his head and then nodded, more to himself than to Curtis. &quot;Well, what were you thinking when you responded? Is that how you&#39;d normally talk to your mom?&quot; He pointed at the most recent message.<br />
<br />
&quot;No. We never text. She hates it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And how about your dad?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean, we hardly talk on a good day, and that&#39;s in person.&quot; <i>No. He loved spending time with his dad in his drum studio and they texted each other songs and lyrics all the time. That&#39;s why he wanted to do music in the first place.</i> He groaned. &quot;This is so fucking confusing! Can&#39;t I just turn into a dog in peace?&quot; He felt so pitiful that he began to laugh despite himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK. You&#39;re delusional. I&#39;m gonna call the hospital.&quot; Ollie pulled out his phone, but Curtis reached out to stop him. He felt better.<br />
<br />
&quot;No. I&#39;m OK.&quot; He smiled up at his sheep but Ollie didn&#39;t look convinced at all. &quot;I promise. I&#39;m good. We should go or you&#39;ll be late for class.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ollie shook his head. &quot;I can miss it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No. It&#39;s your first session. I&#39;m good.&quot; He leaned forward to kiss Ollie to support his argument. &quot;I feel much better. Thank you.&quot; He started to get up, and Ollie helped him to his feet before they started back towards campus. &quot;Hey, Ollie?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Were you close with your parents?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. I am.&quot; The way Ollie said it made it clear he wasn&#39;t in the mood to talk about it so instead he grabbed his hand to hold on the walk back. The sheep&#39;s fingers were stubbier with thick nails and would probably be hand-hooves very soon. They still fit into his padded hands perfectly as Ollie held onto him tightly.<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
After saying goodbye to Ollie, Curtis meandered on his way back to his dorm while he read through the text messages with his &#39;mom&#39;. He smiled to himself and tapped on the phone icon at the top.<br />
<br />
<b>Mom<br />
Calling Home</b><br />
<br />
He quickly pressed the red button to hang up. Feeling guilty, he sent another text message:<br />
<br />
&#39;Sorry, that was an accident. In class. I&#39;ll call you soon.&#39;<br />
<br />
<i>And I&#39;ll never go home again<br />
(Place the call, feel it start)</i><br />
<br />
He paused and sent another:<br />
<br />
&#39;I love you. Give Dad a hug for me.&#39;</p>
