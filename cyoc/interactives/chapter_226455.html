<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Today was the day Felicity would receive the second to last of her treatments to finish maturing her body, at least that was until she received a strange visitor.<br />
<br />
She was dressed and ready to leave her room when a purple portal appeared and out of it emerged a blue rabbit creature with four ears and a strange geometric pattern on its forehead.<br />
<br />
“Chui hello there Felicity, chui!” She spoke.<br />
<br />
“Uh…what the fuck is happening?” Felicity said in disbelief.<br />
<br />
“Allow me to introduce myself, I am Mokomi, chui!” The rabbit creature said.<br />
<br />
“Oh that explains everything—no what the fuck is this am I high or something?!” The blonde replied.<br />
<br />
“Of course not chui! I am an emissary of the Dark Garden and you are the lucky girl who has been chosen to lead an elite team, chui!” She said with a cute flop of her ears.<br />
<br />
Before Felicity could respond her entire body was covered in a purple glow, her clothes had changed into a black and red military looking uniform except for the poofy sleeves and short, flouncy petticoated skirt even with a red bow with a rose on her collar. Various rose motifs decorated her costume and her blonde hair had formed a ringlet ponytail with roses in her hair and she had ankle length red high heeled boots and white gloves.<br />
<br />
“What the hell am I wearing!?” Felicity yelled tugging in her short skirt.<br />
<br />
“It’s your magical garment girl outfit! You are now The pretty avenger: Nightmare Rose! Chui!” Mokomi exclaimed.<br />
<br />
“What!? Like one of those cartoon characters?!” Felicity asked exasperated.<br />
<br />
“Exactly chui!” The cute creature replied,<br />
<br />
“This can’t be happening!” She grumbled.<br />
<br />
“It is chui! With this outfit you will have the powers to defeat the defenders of light chui!” The blue bunny exclaimed.<br />
<br />
“With what? Am I going to flash my skirt at them?!” Felicity argued.<br />
<br />
Then a red war hammer appeared in her hands, it was spiked and had a bouquet of roses on top.<br />
<br />
“That is Red Thorn.” Mokomi explained.<br />
<br />
Felicity swung the war hammer around with great speed and accuracy that shouldn’t be possible of a weapon its size and weight.<br />
<br />
“Red Thorn is practically weightless to it’s weirder and is impossible for anyone else to lift, you can also summon it to your hand and even ride on it chui!” She continued.<br />
<br />
“That’s actually pretty cool!” The blonde said sitting on the hammer’s long handle watching it levitate her in the air.<br />
<br />
Her excitement was interrupted when a knock came it the door.<br />
<br />
“Shit! I can’t let anyone see me like this!” The girl panicked.<br />
<br />
The last thing she needed was her superiors see her dresses like a magical girl. She tried to get to the control panel to keep the door shut but fell off Red Thorn and was too late to stop Choon Hee from entering.<br />
<br />
“Goodness me! What are you wearing Miss Monroe? And what is this creature doing here?” The kumiho asked with her hand to her cheek.<br />
<br />
“I uh…I-I can explain, you see—“ Felicity tried to come up with something but Mokomi started explaining everything to the Asian woman, Felicity becoming more angry and embarrassed the more the bunny said.<br />
<br />
“My, this is interesting. I’ll have to inform the Boss of this development.” Choon Hee said and pulled out her phone.<br />
<br />
“No wait! You can’t I’m supposed to get my treatment today—“ the blonde was silver by the woman placing a finger on the girl’s lips.<br />
<br />
“Now Miss Monroe, a magical creature just appeared inside this facility and affected a Normal member. It is the proper procedure to inform the Boss and have you and it examined. Be a good girl and cover up, that skirt is much too short.” She stated.<br />
<br />
Felicity was furious at being talked down to like this but she had no choice but to listen to the woman, she went over to her bed but couldn’t manage to get out of the ridiculous uniform. Mokomi told her in order to transform back she would need to say: “Dark Magic Concealer” and “Dark Magic Make Up” to transform.<br />
The blonde said the magic words and returned to her normal clothes. Now a girly charm bracelet with a rose appeared on her wrist.<br />
<br />
“When you transform you must hold up this bracelet and speak the words I told you, chui.” The blue furred bunny explained.<br />
<br />
Then she and Mokomi were examined and taken directly to the Boss.<br />
<br />
“The creature doesn’t register as anything special to our censors but she clearly has to be quite powerful to appear without us noticing. As for Monroe she appears to be what’s known as a magical girl, you’ll find additional information in the document I’ve given you.” Dr. Eastly explained.<br />
<br />
The Boss flipped through the documents before setting them down and turning to face Felicity who was sitting in one of the chairs like a schoolgirl getting scolded by the principal.<br />
<br />
“I’ve decided to cancel your treatments. It sees they will no longer be necessary.” He said.<br />
<br />
“Y-you can’t! I’m supposed to be the Head of the One Humanity, I can’t do that as some teenage girl!” Felicity found herself speaking before she could remember who she was talking to.<br />
<br />
The Boss’s gaze seemed to darken the room and a single slight raise of his eyebrow reminded her of her place.<br />
<br />
“I-I’m sorry Boss, Sir. It’s just that—“ the blonde girl squeaked with her eyes downcast.<br />
<br />
“—This power is too useful to waste, I can find a hundred men to fill that position, you’re more useful to me as you are now. Is that understood, Miss Monroe?” He stated in an uncomfortably calm voice.<br />
<br />
“Y-yes Sir!” Felicity found herself compelled to respond.<br />
<br />
“Very good, now Dr. Eastly can spend her time working on project Runway instead of playing grow up skipper with you. But your lessons with Choon Hee will continue. That is all, you may go.” He finished.<br />
<br />
They all left the Boss’s office and headed back to the lab. Choon Hee accompanied Felicity back to her quarters where she flipped her bed over and smashed a wall with her hammer.<br />
<br />
“Fuck him! I knew I was never going to be head of anything here, not anymore!” She raged.<br />
<br />
“Calm down, it will all be alright. You have a more important role now, you will be the leader of a team of dark magical girls! Didn’t you hear the Boss say how important that makes you?” Choon Hee cooed.<br />
<br />
“You’re his brainwashed yes-woman! Of course you don’t care about this, you’d jump into a volcano after letting him fuck you raw if he asked!” The blonde yelled, her teenage anger and rebellion flairing up.<br />
<br />
“Of course I would, but you have to realize your new role is much more useful than as some pretty figurehead.” The Asian woman replied.<br />
<br />
“That’s right chui! Your bracelet will pulse when you’re near a new member of the Dark Garden.” Mokomi said.<br />
<br />
“And what’s your game fluffy? Why the hell would you want to help us anyway?” The teenager asked.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry chui, just know that our goals and the Normal’s alight for now, chui.” She replied.<br />
<br />
“Tomorrow you will start attending West High, it would be a good place to find others to join you as members of the Dark Garden and you did say you want to get out of this facility sometimes. Just know that you are not to engage in combat with our enemies unless given express permission from the Boss himself.” The woman informed.<br />
<br />
“That means I don’t have to wear this uniform anymore?!” Felicity perked up.<br />
<br />
“No you don’t, I have prepared a full wardrobe for you!” Choon Hee replied.<br />
<br />
Felicity looked at the woman’s feminine attire and became worried at what she had picked out for her. She also wasn’t too thrilled at having to attend high school agin but was thankful to get away from this place even if it was just to go to school.<br />
<br />
“I’ll leave you for the day, be sure to rest up, you’ve got a big day tomorrow.” Choon Hee said and left the girl with the rabbit creature.</p>
