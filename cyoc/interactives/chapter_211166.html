<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As much as she had left early, Martha faced a traffic jam because of an accident that had happened. When she saw her arriving, the receptionist told her to come in immediately and go to the usual room. When she entered, she saw that Glória was already there and had already informed the scientists about her pregnancy, questioning how the experiments could affect the child&#39;s development. <br />
<br />
Noticing her arrival, Dr Alex told her that the pregnancy was not a surprise, as the analysis of the cum sample collected in the previous week showed that she would be able to impregnate other women.<br />
<br />
Without getting too carried away, and also because they were already late, Dr. Alex gave Martha the results of all the clinical tests that had been done on her. She informed that they had discovered that her immune system was facing the changes that the lotion was causing in her body, however that the stimulus could strengthen the action of the lotion in the stimulated place and therefore all that had changed in her was the fact that she had male genitals instead of female now, and that if it weren&#39;t for her immune system at this point she probably would have fully become a man. She also reported that the struggle in her body that prevented her from going through a total sex reversal caused a dramatic hormonal surge in her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your testosterone level is at that of a healthy male, but her estrogen and progesterone levels are more than twice the normal range for a female.&quot; Dr Alex completed<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand.  Is that what&#39;s making me turn on so often?&quot; Martha said<br />
<br />
&quot;It almost certainly is.  I&#39;ve never seen a person with such high levels of hormones from either sex before, so it&#39;s hard to predict what might happen over the course of the experiment.&quot; Dr Alex said<br />
<br />
&quot;And were you able to figure out why a third testicle appeared in my sack last week?&quot; Martha asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really.  This was a new occurrence even for us and all we have is a theory, nothing we can confirm yet.  We think that the elevated levels of hormones in his body caused some confusion the changes produced one more testicle even though he already had the two patterns formed.  If that&#39;s true, it won&#39;t be surprising if more emerge.&quot; Dr Alex said<br />
<br />
Before Martha could ask another question, an assistant reminded Dr. Alex that they were running late, so she hurried Martha and Gloria to their positions. As they were undressing Martha asked Gloria if it would be okay for her to participate in the experiment while she was pregnant, but she said that she wanted to try something and if it didn&#39;t work in this session she would stop or postpone it to continue the experiment after giving birth. <br />
<br />
On Dr Alex&#39;s recommendation they applied the lotion only to themselves and should avoid physical contact during the test.<br />
<br />
Martha and Gloria put the lotion on their hands, with Gloria putting it on only one hand.  Martha stroked his cock, which quickly became rock hard, and it didn&#39;t take long for her to feel her cock getting bigger, going to 16 inches and when it got to 17 inches it happened, not quite as unexpectedly as the last time, a fourth testicle started growing inside her sack. Her cock continued to grow and stopped only when she came, it was now 20 inches long.  Her four testicles were larger than the previous trio, but the difference wasn&#39;t too great, making the quantity more noticeable than the size. Fiddling with her ballsack a little she thought it was even better that there were four, because if they had only followed the increase in size at the pace of her cock with only two they would have been too big and would get in the way between her legs, but with four it was easier to move.<br />
<br />
Gloria caressed her cock with the hand in which she put the lotion, and with the other hand she held her balls and thrust her fingers into her pussy.  She masturbated stimulating both her male and female genitals. Her cock grew, less than Martha, who was looking at her, expected, going from 4 inches to 6 inches in length, and her balls growing to match. &quot;That&#39;s right, it worked, it&#39;s back.&quot; Gloria said, but as of yet no one knew what she meant by that, at least not until the time she came.<br />
<br />
While coming Gloria took both hands from her genitals, with cum flying from the tip of her cock and with each shot the pregnant woman pushed her hips up, so that her balls bounced and left the view for a second a perfect pussy. They knew that since the clit had become the dick, even though she still had a vagina she no longer had a clit, but now Gloria had a clit again.<br />
<br />
&quot;My plan worked.  When Dr talked about hormones and stimuli affecting the changes I started to think.  Martha said that she had totally forgotten about her own vagina after her dick grew, so I thought the abandonment made her body judge it unnecessary and got rid of her vagina.  So I tried to do it differently and keep my female part stimulated, which worked and even with my dick growing my vagina went back to how it was before.&quot; Gloria said, so that both Martha and Dr Alex could hear clearly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good idea.  We hadn&#39;t thought of that, but it was great information that we got out of it. Imagine the commercial use of this once all the testing and fine-tuning is complete.&quot; Dr Alex said<br />
<br />
The women then went to put their clothes back on so they could go home.  For Martha, her dick was now not completely flaccid. She questioned this and Dr Alex said that probably her cock now needed a lot of blood for an erection and when the erection wore off, there was a lot of blood to flow to her body so it was still slightly hard. She wouldn&#39;t have a problem with that, but it was enough for her to have her cock perfectly outlined in her pants.<br />
<br />
Released, they left the testing room and found Raven, who was fighting with all his might to contain his I cup breasts, parents the bra he was wearing when he arrived had not resisted the new size and burst. They talked a little and said goodbye before going to their own homes.</p>
