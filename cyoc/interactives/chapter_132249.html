<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Princess tried to keep moving but she physically wasn’t able to take another step. Every muscle in her body was in complete agony, all having been pushed to their limits. She looked back and saw that the stallion pursuing them was still going strong and was now only a few hundred meters away.<br />
<br />
Princess soon realised that there was no way she could evade the relentless racehorse. She could see no way through the fence either. But then, perhaps she didn’t need to escape. If the officer riding her could get free then she might return to rescue her in the future. A horse couldn’t climb the fence but perhaps a human could.<br />
<br />
The beige horse whinnied and motioned to the officer by pointing her head towards the fence. Officer Georgina seemed to understand as she quickly dismounted and began climbing the tall wire fence. Now all Princess had to do was to distract her pursuers, and she could only think of one tactic that would work.<br />
<br />
In the meantime the woman was approaching rapidly. She ordered the stallion to go faster as she saw Georgina scaling the fence. The pursuers were only fifty-or-so meters from the officer as she scrambled up the obstacle. Georgina began to panic as her hunters closed in for the kill. The only thing standing between them and her was the beige horse. Georgina figured she wouldn’t be much use as the poor animal was clearly exhausted.<br />
<br />
However, Princess now put her plan into action. As the stallion thundered towards her at full speed, she turned around so that her backside faced him. She then tried to draw his attention as she started swishing her tail from side to side. <br />
<br />
As she hoped, the big horse began to slow down slightly as he noticed the sexy mare ahead of him. “Ignore her damn it!” the stablewoman shouted. “It’s the woman we want.” But her mount didn’t respond as he normally did, and instead slowed right down to a walk. “Do as I say!” the woman shouted in frustration as her horse continued to ignore her. She even tried whipping him, but nothing seemed to change. Her over-use of the artefact had spent its magical energy, now rendering it useless.<br />
<br />
Princess could tell that her plan was working. She listened joyfully as the woman ranted at her disobedient horse. She looked up and saw that Georgina was almost at the top of the fence. In order to ensure her escape the mare used all of her body’s tools to distract the big horse behind her. She drew his attention to her vagina as she moistened it and made it wink at him. Simultaneously she kept wafting her scent towards him whilst neighing as seductively as she could. <br />
<br />
This should have all felt completely weird, but it bothered her less and less. She was disappointed that she couldn’t escape as well, but she tried to take the positives from the situation. The fact that she had a chance of being saved in the future was surely a good thing. However, the best reward for her efforts would be mating with the handsome stud behind her. Again, something should have told her that these thoughts were wrong, but these concerns were brushed aside by her body’s growing urge to be taken by the handsome stud.<br />
<br />
Princess wouldn’t have to wait long as the stallion approached her inviting rear. Meanwhile the woman dismounted as she conceded that even her powerful magic had been drowned out by her mount’s primal needs. Instead she frantically barked into her radio as she stormed off in another direction. <br />
<br />
By now Officer Georgina had safely reached the other side of the fence and was now heading towards a nearby road. She looked back towards the beige horse one last time, as if to thank her, before she disappeared from view.<br />
<br />
Deep down Princess prayed that the officer would be able to get help, but in the meantime she was lustfully anticipating being mounted by the sexy stallion behind her. The big horse didn’t mess around as he roughly planted his hooves on either side of the mare’s flanks. He then poked around with his giant tool a couple of times before he found the mark. The stallion then slipped his dick inside the mare’s inviting vagina. Princess whinnied as inch after glorious inch was buried inside her.<br />
<br />
Princess continued to encourage the stallion as he began thrusting in and out of her leathery entrance. She pushed back against his shaft and moved in time with him as both horses became increasingly aroused. <br />
<br />
The rough humping soon neared its climax as the pair begged for that sweet release. Both animals whinnied one last time before finishing simultaneously. The mare felt sheer bliss as a torrent of warm, sticky cum erupted from his tip and coated her innards white.<br />
 <br />
Princess now felt utter relief as her plan seemed to succeed.  Hopefully she would be rescued before too long. Although she now wasn’t so sure that she wanted to be ‘rescued.’ After all, she had become rather fond of her new sexy body. <br />
<br />
The one thing she did fear was what the woman had in store for her. She just hoped that someone would stop her sooner rather than later.</p>
