<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Wow…this is actually kind of beautiful.” Admitted Emily as she looked up at the night sky, it was actually breathtaking beautiful but she wasn’t going to say that while they where lost in some unknown desert village. With no artificial lights nearby the sky was coming out in full, every star was visible every and shined with full brightness. There was a half moon out as well meaning that the desert landscape was visible as well.<br />
<br />
“It is.” Confirmed Deigo <br />
<br />
“But that is bad for us.” Added Chloe “I went camping with my folks and saw a sky like this but that was were there wasn’t a town for over an hour’s drive away.”<br />
<br />
“An hour?” inquired Olivia <br />
<br />
“Yes, an hour drive, we are in the middle of nowhere.” Confirmed Chloe <br />
<br />
“Let’s hope we find something in this business.” Added Chloe as they used their dying phone batteries as flashlights to begin searching for homes. Without the sun high in the sky it was actually cool enough to move around the city without becoming covered in sweat even if moving through the sand was hard on its own.<br />
<br />
None of them noticed that the statue of a snake god moved slightly its head turning toward the house where Lily had just entered. Its eyes flashed every so much, but this wasn’t caught by the group.<br />
<br />
Inside the house Chloe held her phone up as she searched the room, this looked to be a bookshop of some kind, well a scroll shop may be a better way of saying it. There were rows of scrolls resting on shelves, the dry desert air keeping them for a long time. She opened one to find it covered with some type of writing she didn’t understand and one she had never seen before either.<br />
<br />
“Where the fuck are we?” asked Chloe to herself<br />
<br />
“In your new home my daughter.” Said a deep voice from behind her that caused her to jump and turn around. She saw for a brief second what she thought was a massive human-shaped shadow but when the light passed over it disappeared. <br />
<br />
She let out a sigh of relief, she must have had imagine it. <br />
<br />
Then she turned around and the figure was before her, it was semi see through more of a shaped cloud than a sold figure. She didn’t have time to scream before one of it’s hands reached out and touched her on the chest. She felt it impact and something seemly burned there before it disappeared.<br />
<br />
She bit down the scream and looked around the room, she was still alone but she heard everyone else nearby checking other buildings. She undid the top button of her blouse and looked at her chest where the shadow thing had touched her, nothing.<br />
<br />
“Heat must be getting to me.” Said Chloe as she went to rebutton her top, only her top was gone. <br />
<br />
Thinking it must have slipped out of her grasp she looked down to grab it only to see her whole top was gone simply vanishing off her. Even her bra was gone, her leggings were gone as well as her underwear. Then she felt her cell phone begin to feel like it was made of sand. She turned to see that her cell phone was turning to sand as the light faded leaving her mostly in the dark. The only light coming in from the window.<br />
<br />
She was about to yell for help, but the scream froze in her throat, it was as if her whole body was frozen. Then she felt it, a warmth in her chest, it wasn’t bad in fact it was rather nice and arousing. She reached up and touched her chest with one hand as she looked down. <br />
How was she seeing so well? It was as if the darkness wasn’t even there, sure the colors where a little muted but she could see herself in every detail. What she didn’t know was that her eyes had changed as her whole body began to change.<br />
<br />
She watched wide eyed as her chest grew out. She was always well endowed in that department, every woman in her family was but she watched as her chest grew out by at least ½ to ¾ of the cup size going from large C to large Ds. Her breasts also firmed up as if she was wearing a bra even though she wasn’t. She even felt like she was wearing the most natural comfort bra ever. What she didn’t know was new muscles groups had formed to make that possible.<br />
<br />
Then she noticed it, her hands were breaking out in a rash of some kind. She held her hand into the light from the window and watched as beautiful dark purple amethyst /midnight black scales began to grow over her skin. They quickly covered her hands as her finger nails pushed out into slight points becoming something a kin to short claws. The scales covered her lower arm before fading back to her normal human skin around the elbow. <br />
<br />
She then felt a rush of pleasure from her woman hood as she reached one of her scaled covered hands down to her slit only to have scales touched scales. She looked down in the darkness to find that area covered with large silver scales which covered the center half of her front, merging her legs together as they went. On either side of that and wrapping around her came more scales, the same black, purple amethyst color scales which covered her arms. She couldn’t help it as she reached her figures into her wet pussy and began to pleasure herself.<br />
It was amazing as her eyes rolled backwards in pleasure and she let out deep moans. She slide down the wall laying in the sand as her legs kept merging together and extending outwards two….three…four feet…five feet or more… longer then her body had been before but she didn’t care. Her muscles came much stronger and more compact, she was by far stronger then she could ever had been as a human but she didn’t care. She was lost in pleasure, moaning and lost to that pleasure, then she peaked and felt a rush like she had never felt before.<br />
<br />
“That was wonderful.” She said, her voice hissing a bit, her tough was longer and forked as well as her normal human feet replaced with more fangs. Her lower arms and her legs were covered with a beautiful purple amethyst scales with silver scales running down the center underbelly part. Everything went so well with her black hair which hadn’t grown or changed even has her whole body received a glow up, it was as if a natural beauty makeup had come in. She did have patches of those scales around her neck, under a breast but her face/torso was still human.<br />
<br />
She had become a snake person, a Lamia even if she was still coming down from that climax and hadn’t realize it yet.</p>
