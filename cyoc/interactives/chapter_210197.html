<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While running and accessing Ryan´s thoughts and knowledge, another idea formed. If I could control this power, what would happen if I change others? And would any gained knowledge stay with me if I change them back, or take them off? Would I have other changes to myself, drawing from the changed people?<br />
After the gym class ended, I was one of the last ones in the shower. I wasn´t sure if Ryan would change back when I took him off, and debated showering while keeping him on. I decided on a save way, wait until the others were out, then take him off inside the shower. If he changed back, I could try to again change him, and nobody would be near to see it. If he stayed a jockstrap, nobody could take him while I showered. I guessed that Carter or Horst could try to safe Ryan from being worn.<br />
Ryan didn´t change back while I showered, just hanging from the tap before me lifelessly. I couldn´t access the knowledge I had gained from Ryan before, so it hadn´t copied over to my head. But was that because I had worn him for such a short time, or because it never started being copied, as if he was a flash drive connected to me? Time would tell, I was sure.<br />
As I left the shower, jockstrap on again, I run into Carter and Horst, both not really sure what to do. As they noticed, however, that I still wore their friend, they got slowly angry at me. Whatever fear they had before training was no longer present.<br />
“Hey Vinnie, can you change Ryan back now? I think he learned his lesson.” Carter was calm enough to ask friendly.<br />
I accessed Ryan´s thoughts of the matter, hearing him plead to be changed back, and that he would never be mean to me again. Or if he was, I was free to return him into this state, to let him remember the embarrassment. I sighed before I answered: “I´m not sure how I changed him, but right now he seems to be unconscious. Even if I change him back now, you would have him out like a light.” That had been a lie to them, and Ryan was very vocal over it in my mind, so I turned the connection off for now.<br />
Horst seemed to be seething now. “Then give him to us for safe-keeping, and you can try to change him back later. I don´t think he would like being worn.” Carter suggested, trying to hold to his calmness, as well as holding Horst back.<br />
I smiled at them. “No, if I gave him to you now, and he wakes, he would not be as humiliated, and most likely have not learned his lesson from it. That would only work if you would wear him, and that wouldn´t be different from now, then.”<br />
That was when something inside Horst seemed to snap, as he pushed Carter back and stormed at me, pushing me down onto the ground hard, and placing his right foot on my chest to keep me down. “You little asshole will change him back now, or you will be sorry.”<br />
I was breathing heavy on the ground, my back hurting from falling down on it. “Let me go, Horst.” I pressed out, as he was limiting my air intake with his foot.<br />
Horst laughed while Carter slowly stood up again, having landed on his ass as well. “Change him back. NOW!”<br />
In my slowly raising panic about lack of oxygen, I grabbed his ancle, just above his sock, and willed him to another form. In my eyes, Horst was to be punished, and it fitted somewhat with what I had thought about earlier in the field. My grip wasn´t that strong, but suddenly I could close my hand around his leg, as it gave more and more way.<br />
Looking up at Horst, I could see him paling, without him noticing. The pressure on my chest was lifting, as Horst was losing weight rather quickly. “WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO ME? You little ass…” he screamed at me, his voice diminishing to a whisper in the end before ending completely, not finishing his word.<br />
Instead of holding Horst´s ancle, I was now holding a single, right sock, white with a small red stripe under the rim.<br />
Carter, having watched the whole thing, stood there in shock, pale and unresponsive. As I slowly got my breathing under control, I sat up, and, without much thought, grabbed his left ancle next, seeing as he stood near enough. Even as he had tried to help me against Horst, he wasn´t that helpful, therefore I didn´t need him around. It was erasing the evidence, as well. And, of course, what would I do with a single sock?<br />
Carter nearly jumped out of his skin as I grabbed him, but before he could so much as take a step back, he was already joining Horst in being a sock. His plea: “No, please stop, Vin…” went unheard by anyone but his already transformed friends and Vinnie, who showed no mercy for him. Soon, he was a left sock, forming a pair with Horst, being the same white with a red stripe under the rim.<br />
I grinned down at the two socks I was now holding. “You should have taken your stinking feet away from my chest as I asked for it, Horst. I feel a little guilty for you, Carter, but now I´m sure to have no witnesses anymore. I hope you like my feet, as that will be your new home now.” With that said, I moved over to my locker, and quickly put them onto my still damp feet. I pulled on my shirt, underwear and jeans, covering up Ryan, who I was still wearing, before finally pushing Horst and Carter down into my shoes, fixing them tightly in.<br />
And since pulling them onto my feet, I heard Horst cursing and threaten me, while Carter was pleading for me to change him back. But both started gagging the moment I put my shoes on, and moaning at the tightness as I fixed them with the laces. But, as I needed to get to my next class, I turned the connection to them off, like I did with Ryan before. Maybe later, after they had a bit of time to learn their situation, I would reconnect to them.<br />
As I left the locker room, I also thought about the new knowledge I had because of them. Maybe I should get someone with a different mind next, to widen my knowledge even more. After all, all three of my new clothes were mostly connected to sports.</p>
