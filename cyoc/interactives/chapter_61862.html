<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Author's note: I change the view to first-person (i.e. Josh = I). It makes reading about transformations so much more fun.<br />
<br />
I crossed my fingers and started to speak:<br />
<br />
&quot;Human pregnancy is extremely hard to achieve and thus it is balanced by women having multiple children in each pregnancy. To make this possible female physiology differs quite prominently from the one before the wish. Extremely high levels of estrogen have a profound impact on both females' looks and behavior.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;First of all, the average height for women is now to be 4'10'' with some rare cases reaching 5'1''. They are also much weaker and fragile even when compared to the current reality's women of the same size. Their whole body is skinny, soft and petite but with exceptions for some parts of their bodies:&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In order to make a delivery of few children at once possible female pelvis needs to be bigger than its current reality's equivalent. Current average waist-to-hips ratio of 0.7 after the wish becomes 0.55 . With their hips almost twice as wide as their waists women basically can't make any major move without twisting their bottoms in ways considered now to be sexy and seductive. Wider hips also mean greater leg separation which would result in female reproductive organs being over-exposed and thus prone to injuries. To avoid that Mother Nature gifted women with much thicker thighs and therefore even more pronounced buttocks (which together with the enlarged pelvis add to the significantly boosted bottom size).&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The breasts, now needed to feed many children at the same time rather than just one, consist now mainly of the milk-producing tissue rather than body fat, like those of the current reality's women. This makes them more dense and therefore heavier than current reality's equivalent of the same size. Milk tissue's firm consistency, however, makes them jut forward rather than sag while maintaining (and even increasing) their softness. If the breasts were to be proportionate to the body size in a current reality's way, even with the milk tissue amount increased they simply wouldn't be able to provide enough milk for their potential numerous offspring. That's why in the new reality the average breast size of a 4'10'' woman is what an above-average cup size of a current 5'8'' woman was before the wish - a large C-cup, and tending to get bigger. Also, girls' nipples are unproportionally enlarged, measuring on average 0.75 inches long and across. The areolae are also enlarged on average, but unlike the current reality's big areolae they don't don't just fade out into the skin - instead they have clear borders which separates their usually dark red tissue form the rest of girl's skin. The increased amount of milk tissue present makes spontaneous lactation quite common, with almost 75% of women lactating permanently.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Female reproductive organs also differ from the ones most of the current reality's people are used to. The most prominent difference is in their size. To accommodate more babies women uterus needed to be more stretchy but also generally bigger in size. Evolution achieved this by simply enlarging the whole female reproductive system all together, incidentally filling the unused space in the new much bigger pelvis. The organs are generally twice as big as the current reality's ones, meaning that for example vagina's average depth goes up form 5in to 10in when not aroused.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The excess of estrogen has also quite significant impact on the consistency of the girls' cartilage. The result is extraordinarily improved flexibility which helps women to deal with pelvic stretching during pregnancy and birth. The flexibility is there also when they are not pregnant though and an average 30 year old woman is able to put both of her legs behind her head without any effort or even a warm-up. Although for women there is no direct benefit from being so flexible (apart from the help with pregnancy), males tend to overuse it playing with their partners' bodies to diversify their sex life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In addition to that and other physical changes caused by the elevated estrogen levels (like the lack of body hair in places other than head, or simply finer complexion) there's also a couple of mental/behavioral differences that need to be described. Because of the unlikeness of getting pregnant the Mother Nature had to tweak women likelihood of becoming pregnant. This was achieved by making a major psychological modification: increasing their maternal instincts and sex drive. When women don't have children (majority of them) their maternal instincts usually are satisfied by a woman excessively caring about the others which combined with the increased libido makes them extremely docile and submissive towards men. Women intrinsically want to take care of their households and men, thus female emancipation never happened (because they simply had no interest in the ideas of feminism).&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Even though females are used to their body shapes, they do tend to feel very uncomfortable and physically limited because of the contrast of their tiny frames with their disproportional (with regards to the current reality's conditions) sexual characteristics. However, there's absolutely no desire among women to fight surgically or otherwise with their female attributes as their instincts make them simply accept their roles willingly. Even if that means they have to suffer; is it for the survival of the specie or simply for pleasing the men.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Men had to adapt to the change in the way humans reproduce as well, only for them the changes went in opposite direction. The elevated level of testosterone was supposed to increase their sex drive in order to make rare conceptions more likely to happen. This succeed in a way but also introduced a range of other changes. The average height went up from 5'10'' to 6'4'' and overall physical fitness also improved dramatically even for the specimen who never exercised. Women being so fragile and weak needed more capable men to provide them with food, various supplies and protection for their numerous offspring (if they were lucky enough to have any). In the times before technology this meant a lot of hard physical work where muscles happened to be very useful.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Men also had to adapt to the changes in female reproductive organs. Deeper vagina needed longer member to be penetrated properly, so male members grew to the adequate length and width (oscillating around a foot long and 2 inches in diameter when erect). Also the amount of semen produced changed. More sperms mean greater chance of getting woman pregnant so the production of semen increased sixfold. In order to supply this amount, male testicles increased adequately, proportionally to the growth in penis size.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mental changes in men were a side effect of the testosterone increase. Increased aggressiveness and a need for dominance were the main ones. This, however, could easily lead to unending wars between bloodthirsty men. Fortunately the evolution found another way - it channeled both of those instincts to be purely sexual in nature, therefore changing only interactions with women. Females were too valuable to hurt them though, so the aggressiveness resulted in a need to humiliate and lower them rather than assaulting them physically.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There's no love in the new reality. The male-female relationships are based purely on sex and practicality. People live in pairs which are assigned top-down and for life. The assignment happens when people are 14 (being the year when they finish puberty) and is made on the basis of sexuality level, i.e. the more masculine the boy is the more feminine the girl. The greater the discrepancy between the two, the higher social status of the 'family'. Every one of those relationships is really a sort of symbiosis. The man works for the 'family', governs it and dominates over the woman using her as he desires to satisfy his insatiable sexual needs. The woman takes care of the household, puts up with being treated as a property of her husband and being constantly humiliated by him, she must withstand the way her partner uses her body very often until she falls unconscious from exhaustion. All this just so she can have a minimal chance to be 'pollinated' and fulfill her evolutionary purpose.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because of men being the dominant gender in society it is also very common and acceptable for males to use any random female they meet for instance on the street. They can command her to do things, they can demand a sexual intercourse to happen at any time. Because there is no love in the male-female relationships a man never minds his partner to be used by other males. They even tend encourage it which often results in a bunch of male friends enjoying a gang-bang action to the partner of one of them. The way women spend their free time is closely connected to that their biggest desire is - and the evolution made sure that it's a pregnancy. That's why whenever they have some free time and their male partners aren't available they just gather in groups of 10 women or so, dress provocatively and go to public places in order to be taken by some male strangers. Again, they hate being humiliated and used but they also realize that in this reality an intercourse is the only way one can ever get pregnant.&quot;<br />
<br />
I stopped talking for a moment pleased with the sick products of my imagination. Then I finished my perverted world's description with something to guarantee that I'll get 100% of this experience.<br />
<br />
&quot;Even though I'll retain all my memories,&quot; I continued &quot;my New Reality's body is going to behave in a way appropriate for it, as described by me before (even if I won't want it).&quot;<br />
<br />
This way no leftover social inhibitions would spoil my experience. I was sure that even if I didn't like something, I will behave like I lived in my dreamed world since I was born.<br />
<br />
Then I realized that with my descriptions being so accurate there was no place for anything surprising. Well, I definitely didn't want to make my New Reality experience boring... Still keeping my fingers crossed I added:<br />
<br />
&quot;Also my transition into the new reality is going to have some twist to it, so that it's more interesting for me.&quot; <br />
<br />
I un-crossed my fingers and an overwhelming bright light engulfed me. I was really looking forward to experiencing the world I dreamed. The true male dominance... Also I was wondering what the 'interesting twist' is going to turn out to be. I thought that maybe I would get an even bigger dick or something like that but the result ended up being really unexpected.</p>
