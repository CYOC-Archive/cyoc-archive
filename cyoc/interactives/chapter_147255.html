<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Prom was quite often one of the biggest social events of the school year for most school districts, and with WSA that would become even bigger, largely due to the physical advantages Animalians had over normal humans in other activities. Even single dosed Animalians tended to be taller and more fit than human teens in their age group. Some of these differences could be even greater with larger Animalian species, and especially so for those that were double dosed. It was something that within Nevada&#39;s state sponsored High School sports became a major limiting factor. Because Animalians had so many physical advantages that Humans couldn&#39;t easily equal without massive amounts of training, Animalians wouldn&#39;t able to compete in state sports until every school district had a certain percentage of their students that were either born Animalians or converted/uplifted Animalians. But that was something that would take time, which left prom as the biggest event that would replace not having school sporting events.<br />
<br />
And of course with such a big night, there was of course the need for chaperones.  Eliza was pleased that WSA had avoided issues like shootings and that for the most part, the worst of the concerns over the unisex showers, or even the occasional joke that one of the larger Animalians would trip and crush a Human student or smaller Animalian. She had also been greatly pleased that the student body had made it through much of the school&#39;s first year as an integrated district and showing how well everyone could get along. Animalian students didn&#39;t go overboard with their desires and do harm to their human counterparts, and the predatory Animalians continued to follow Animalia&#39;s Edicts. It was all something to be proud of, but prom was still a large social gathering and with that came some of the social requirements that related making sure there was no trouble. And as principal of WSA&#39;s High School, Eliza got the role of being head chaperone for the evening.<br />
<br />
Some of the other staff members were assigned for chaperone duty as well, though much of that would be fairly limited to keeping a loose eye on things, but it was figured to be better to be safe than sorry. After all, there was always the potential for an argument, some unfair prank. The fact that major problems had been avoided didn&#39;t necessarily mean that things went perfectly, otherwise Eliza&#39;s position as principal wouldn&#39;t be needed as well. And so, she patrolled along through the edges as the activities at WSA got started. Much of it was pretty innocent as the students, Human and Animalian mingled about. Eliza heard a few discussions on attire and style choices, but some of that was expected.<br />
<br />
Most of the Human students were more &quot;formally&quot; dressed. It wasn&#39;t quite a full tux or ballroom gown, but they were more formal, which was likely something of a holdover from most other school&#39;s proms. This of course lead to some quips back and forth between Human students and Animalian ones. For many Animalians had certain concerns and needs that made many true formalwear more difficult. Animalians with fur or feathers could find the material itchy, and those that were adapted for cold weather like Marcy and Chilly would overheat in more formal clothing because it would hold heat in. Winged Animalians needed certain adjustments to shirts to allow them to keep their wings comfortable. This had often lead jokes and jabs back and forth over the more informal attire that many Animalians wore versus the more formal attire the Humans wore.<br />
<br />
&quot;I trust we&#39;re not too divided clothing,&quot; Eliza spoke as she came across a Human teen in a more formal dress looking to an male Animalian teen who was in a pair of black shorts and a navy blue polo shirt. The two had been fairly friendly since he&#39;d joined WSA, but the apparent debate over clothing seemed to be the present dividing point.<br />
<br />
&quot;No... but...&quot; the teen girl bemoaned, &quot;but this is big! Didn&#39;t they have prom when you went to High School?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They did... and it was rather formal then,&quot; Eliza commented, &quot;but they also didn&#39;t have Animalia then. Remember, those of us with fur or feathers may overheat now that the temperatures are coming out of the winter cold.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And the guy at the store said they were more &quot;business-like&quot; not athletic shorts,&quot; the male Animalian spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I wanted the night to be magical...&quot; the girl gave  a depressed pout.<br />
<br />
&quot;Magic isn&#39;t in what you wear,&quot; Eliza advised, &quot;it&#39;s in the memories you make. You are friends right?&quot;<br />
<br />
The male Animalian nodded enthusiastically and the girl agreed. Her nod wasn&#39;t as quick or as enthusiastic but she did recognize the point of being friends. And that fit the theme that had been set up for the prom&#39;s theme, &quot;friends together.&quot; Eliza could see that easily as there was a large banner that hung across the south end of the gym which had the words emblazoned in bright multi colored block letters. It was something that the Student Council had agreed on when the plans for prom were first put together, and Eliza had felt it a good idea. Particularly with the fact that the present school year was one that was bringing all sides back together. The previous year had gone well, but had the struggle of Lyre going from a single integrated district to two segregated districts and now had moved to Animalia as a reunited district for both Animalia and Lyre.  <br />
<br />
Showing that all sides could get along was a big thing WSA had been working with. So far it had gone fairly well, and those successes went into the prom. While many groups of friends often tended to stick together, Eliza could see that there were plenty of groups and even couples that were mixed Human and Animalian. Even the Student Council had human members and they had all worked well together, regardless of their species. As she left the two that had had their debate over attire, Eliza looked to one long table that was under the &quot;friends together&quot; banner. Their present tasks was to tally the votes for Prom King and Queen  while everyone ate. The votes were given as everyone socialized as they prepared for the opening moves of the activities, including the dining section.<br />
<br />
The dinner section the prom&#39;s opening went well, and so far the only real thing that had been an issue had been some gripes over attire and as far as Eliza found, those weren&#39;t too much of an issue. Particularly as WSA&#39;s prom was going to have many things that were different from other schools. That was a good thing. As the plates began to empty, the president of the student council waved to Eliza and then held up a fist with a thumb raised that was to indicate that the votes had been tabulated regarding the prom King and Queen. Eliza nodded and looked out to the sea of faces gathered in the gym as they looked up to the where the student council president was now standing up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me, ladies and gentleman,&quot; the student council president spoke, &quot;we&#39;ve just finished tabulating the votes for the &quot;Junior&quot; Prom King and Queen.&quot;<br />
<br />
The announcement drew all attention to table where the student council was seated with a fair amount of curiosity. Particularly as the voting instructions was that the votes were for individuals, not simply by couple. Though Eliza figured that most of the votes would end up being by couple. That was largely how she remembered votes like this going when she was in high school many years ago.<br />
<br />
&quot;In third place, there was Max &quot;Tusk&quot; and Athena Shepard,&quot; the student council president spoke as the two listed raised their hands to wave. Max was seated with Dean and the other Elephant Animalians at WSA while Athena was seated with Peter, Mara, and the rest of Green Glacier Adventure Clan. The student council president continued with the announcement even as there was some applause. &quot;In second place we have Marcy and Chilly White.&quot; There was again some pause for applause and the announcement moved on. &quot;And the winners of this year&#39;s vote... and the &quot;Junior&quot; Prom King and Queen are... Samson Brown and Courtney Hedge.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was some applause again, though from her spot of supervision, she could see some looks of surprise on both sets of winners. Which was understandable, as just about everyone knew that Samson and Abby were bond mates and given the habit of things like Prom King and Queen, it was often expected that people would vote for couples. But Samson and Courtney had occasionally had some shots together in Animalia Ambassadoria&#39;s new format. Samson remained his thoughtful and rather modest self while Courtney managed to often ask the right questions that enabled who they were interviewing to provide information that would explain things more, even potential weaknesses but also showing where those weaknesses were overcome in terms of Human/Animalian relations in two Nevada sister cities. Eliza privately guessed that was the reason for the details in the vote, though she also figured that it would be hard to tell why, as the vote wasn&#39;t much more than writing a pair of names on a tag and turning the tag in.<br />
<br />
Eventually the two made their way up to the student council&#39;s table, where the student council president presented two rather modest &quot;crowns&quot; to the victors. Things were rather quiet as the crowns were accepted and Courtney and Samson turned back to the gathered audience. After a moment of silence, Courtney managed to say something.<br />
<br />
&quot;We both thank you for all your votes,&quot; Courtney spoke clearly, &quot;and it would be hoped that these votes would show a sign of unity and friendship that we can have to show the world. That our species isn&#39;t what defines us. That who our mates are do not define us. But that it is our friendship that does that and will let us challenge each other to make those friendships stronger.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was some applause and Courtney then turned and shook Samson&#39;s hand, which ultimately drew more applause.</p>
