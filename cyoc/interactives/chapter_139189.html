<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“You know I think seeing this worlds Mary Elise could be a lot of fun,” Claudia smirked. “Maybe she can help me find Kellie. Besides been forever since I got a chance to see her and her family.”<br />
<br />
Claudia smirked as she recalled her and Mary Elise’s relationship. The two had been friends since grade school, Claudia would even say that Mary had been her best friend, that is until her and Mika became an item. Claudia sighed sadly as she thought about how the two had drifted somewhat as the years had passed.<br />
<br />
“Guess it’s part of growing up,” she sighed sadly. “The people you thought were your best friend just kind of drift off. Next thing you know that best friend becomes just a good friend.”<br />
<br />
As Claudia now began walking she thought of her relationship with Mary Elise over the years. The two were still great friends (Claudia even considered making the girl her Maid of Honor for her wedding) still they were no where near as close as they used to be. When the two were in grade school and even junior high they were inseparable. The girls would spend all their time together whether it was at school or when they were at home. Mary Elise often acted as the voice of reason even when they were kids. Chuckling Claudia remembered it was Mary Elise who often had to break up the fights she would inevitably get into with Mika. “If I told me then I would be marrying Mika she probably would of thought I was nuts.”<br />
<br />
After a thirty minute walk. Lauding smiled as she gauze’s around the neighborhood. It amazed her that everything looked exactly the same as the world she was used to. The homes all looked the same, right down to the paint jobs. As Claudia looked at Mary’s home she couldn’t help but smile. “Nothings changed,” she smirked. “Same paint job, same yard, same cars.” As she looked a little closer though she frowned, there was a difference that Claudia now noticed.<br />
<br />
Mary Elise’s yard did not have the usual flowers and maintenance that she was accustomed too. While the lawn was mowed the usual flower arrangements and architecture that Mr. McKinnon usual had were not present. “Huh weird,” Claudia mused. “Guess this version of Mr. McKinnon doesn’t like doing yard work.” As she walked closer she touched her pendant, becoming invisible. “Gonna want to check things out before I talk with Mary,” she thought. “Last thing I want to do is freak her out.”<br />
<br />
Peaking in to Mary’s home she could see Mrs. McKinnon and Mary’s sister Megan sitting at the kitchen table. Claudia was astonished to see that both were younger than she was accustomed too. Mrs McKinnon was in her early 40s while Megan was 12 years old once again. Aside from their age she didn’t see any differences in their appearance, the style of their clothing remained the same. “Wonder where Mary and Mr. McKinnon are,” she mused.<br />
<br />
As Claudia watched closely she was shocked as Mary Elise and a girl she didn’t recognize enter the kitchen. Claudia’s jaw dropped as she gazed at the two 16 year old girls. Mary was dressed all in black. The girls black sweater and jeans contrasted her pale skin and thick red hair. “What the hell,” she hissed. “What’s with Mary’s clothes. The only thing black I’ve seen her wear is that little black dress whenever we go to the club.”<br />
<br />
Looking at the shorter rave haired girl Claudia frowned. “Don’t even know who the hell that is,” Claudia mumbled. “Never seen her in my life. She kind of looks like a dork though.” Claudia watched as the girl pushed her wire rim glasses up her nose. Claudia frowned as she watched her friend, Mary’s body language and facial expressions made the girl appear quite dark and moody. Claudia watched as the girl grabbed a drink for her friend and herself before saying goodbye and heading out the backdoor. <br />
<br />
Claudia now crept around the side of Mary’s home to listen to what the girl was saying. Straining her ears and touching her pendant Claudia could pick up a conversation between Mary and the other girl.<br />
<br />
“So you an Doubt Katie changed that kid Kevin into a weakling,” Karen stated in shock. Claudianwatched as Mary Elise smirked impishly at her friend. “He had it coming,” she stated. “Tired if watching him strong arm everyone at school. He won’t be strong arming anyone anymore.”<br />
<br />
“I guess your right,” Karen sighed. “Still What was up with you and the volleyball team. Did Kellie have to talk you out of changing the captain of the volleyball team?”<br />
<br />
“Maybe,” Mary Elise grinned. “I was bored, I was thinking about useing my ring to turn her into an actual bitch. You know to match her personality.”<br />
<br />
“Ugh Mary,” Karen groaned. “You can’t actually mean that. Things have been going better lately, I mean you and Claudia have made up and your even getting along with Lisa and Kumiko now.”<br />
<br />
“Just because I get along with them now doesn’t change who I am Karen,” she said quietly. Karen looked at her friend, a look of concern on her face. Mary Elise still had a lot of anger deep down. She had hoped the girl would begin to change once she became friends with Kellie and her friends. Unfortunately the change seemed to be coming along slowly. “Just be careful okay,” Karen sighed. “Kellie and the others aren’t so bad and you know that. I’d hate to see you piss everyone off when your just beginning to make friends.”<br />
<br />
Mary Elise sighed as she looked at Karen. The girl had a point, maybe she should try to lighten up a bit. As she was about to answer Karen she paused, her ring was glowing. Staring down at it she wondered what was going on. After a moment she realized her ring was trying to warn her, someone was watching her.<br />
<br />
“Karen get behind me,” Mary Elise said quickly. Confused Karen did as Mary asked, looking at her friend she could see Mary was worried. “what’s wrong,” she said, her voice tinged with fear. Mary narrowed her eyes as she looked out across her lawn. “Someone’s here,” she said quietly. “Don’t ask me how I know but the ring told me that someone with some pretty powerful magic is near....and I don’t know if they’re going to hurt us.”<br />
<br />
Claudia paused as she looked at Mary and the girl Karen. The two teens seemed spooked at her presence. What was even more alarming was Mary’s attitude. The girl seemed like a total opposite of the Mary Elise she was used to. “What the hell is going on here,” Claudia thought. “When did Mary get so....scary.” Sighing Claudia touched her pendant revealing herself to Mary Elise and Karen.<br />
<br />
The two teens shrieked in surprise jumping back slightly. Mary Elise raised her ring in a threatening manner as Claudia now looked at the girl. “Hey,” Claudia said. “I’m.....Umm..Claudia. Kind of came from the other timeline to visit. Was hoping to ummm...talk.”<br />
<br />
Mary Elise paused as she gazed at the college age Claudia that now stood in front of her. She had already met a few people from that timeline, now she was getting to meet more. She now just needed to decide if she wanted to talk or not.</p>
