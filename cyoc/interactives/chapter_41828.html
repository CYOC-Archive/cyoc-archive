<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mary was the first to turn around. She found herself waist level with what looked to her like a giant. She looked up to see a young boy that at most seemed to be eight standing before her.<br />
<br />
Eric turned moments after. Their reduced stature easily made the boy that stood before the ottselfied duo more then twice their size.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey cool,&quot; the boy said. &quot;What are you guys?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary shook her head and folded her arms. &quot;Humph.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What's wrong?&quot; the kid asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do we look like guys?&quot; Mary asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You guys can talk?&quot; the boy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, we can,&quot; Eric said. &quot;Doesn't that seem unusual to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah but who cares,&quot; the boy said. &quot;So what are you guys?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary shook her head. &quot;Don't you play video games?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes but my parents won't let me play all of them. I sometimes go to my friend Tim's house to play ones that my parents say I can't play. You're not gonna tell on me are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We're weasels, not rats,&quot; Eric asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's what weasels look like? But aren't weasels bad guys? How come you can talk?&quot; the kid asked.<br />
<br />
Mary looked at Eric. &quot;I don't think we should tell him. You know how kids are.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric shrugged his shoulders. &quot;Yeah but it's not like anyone will believe him. Anyway, maybe he can give us a ride home on his shoulders.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary laughed. &quot;And then take us on an adventure to become human again? What part of don't take rides from strangers did you forget?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know it's risky but he seems to be cool. I mean, I doubt he'd try to hurt us,&quot; Eric said.<br />
<br />
The kid seemed confused. &quot;You guys are trying to get home and used to be human? Where do you live? Can I keep you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary shook her head. &quot;We're people, not pets. And yes, we used to be human.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No way, you're crazy,&quot; the kid said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that any crazier then a couple of real life ottsels?&quot; Mary asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, not really,&quot; the boy said. &quot;But how did you become -- what did you say you were?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary rolled her eyes. &quot;Ottsels; part otter, part weasel.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric put his arm around Mary. &quot;And all beautiful.&quot;<br />
<br />
The boy rolled his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;But, if you're from a video game, how come you're real?&quot; the kid asked. &quot;Did you come to our world through a portal or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's a long story kid,&quot; Mary said.<br />
<br />
&quot;We're from this world, we just got turned into ottsels,&quot; Eric said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? That is so cool,&quot; the kid said.<br />
<br />
Mary looked Eric over before raising a foot and rubbing it for a few seconds and nodding her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, it is pretty cool when I think about it,&quot; Mary said.<br />
<br />
&quot;So um, if you guys know how to become video game characters, does that mean I could become something really cool like a Charizard?&quot; the kid asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let's take it one step at a time,&quot; Eric said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, I'll be nice and take you guys home,&quot; the kid asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;This isn't as fun as it looks,&quot; Mary said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; the boy asked.<br />
<br />
Eric suddenly realized he and Mary's lack of clothing. It felt wrong to let the boy see them like this.<br />
<br />
&quot;For one, we have to worry about things trying to eat us,&quot; Mary said. &quot;Two, animal control might try and take us away.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Three, we're freaking naked! You shouldn't be looking at us!&quot; Eric cried.<br />
<br />
Mary looked at Eric and then at the kid. &quot;Relax Eric, I doubt we're corrupting or bothering him. Besides, it's not like we have a choice -and- you can't really see anything, so we're still decent.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eric? But that's a boy's name,&quot; the kid said. &quot;You used to be a boy?&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric felt blood rushing to his cheeks. The boy started to laugh. Mary petted Eric on the back.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's all right, I'll handle him,&quot; Mary whispered.<br />
<br />
Mary climbed up the kids pants and then his shirt before standing on his shoulders.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay kid, jokes over,&quot; Mary said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, get off of me,&quot; the kid said.<br />
<br />
&quot;A true Charizard wouldn't laugh at my friend's misfortune,&quot; Mary said.<br />
<br />
The kid stopped laughing.<br />
<br />
&quot;They wouldn't?&quot; the kid asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Charizard are noble creatures,&quot; Mary said. &quot;Noble creatures don't make fun of people. If you want to become a Charizard then you need to be noble too! How would you feel if something turned you into a girl!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess I'd be kinda mad. What does noble mean?&quot; The kid asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;First, please put me back on the ground,&quot; Mary said. &quot;Softly.&quot;<br />
<br />
The kid held out his arms, Mary climbed into them and the kid lowered her down beside Eric.<br />
<br />
&quot;Being noble means being a good guy,&quot; Mary said. &quot;It means doing what's right and being nice to people. It also means not doing things to people that you wouldn't want them to do to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But what if they're bad guys and try to hurt me?&quot; the kid asked.<br />
<br />
Mary put her arm around Eric and pulled him in close.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then you run away and get a police officer,&quot; Mary said.<br />
<br />
&quot;But what if I can't run away,&quot; the kid asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is something your parents could better explain to you,&quot; Mary said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Speaking of my parents, I can't just go off on some adventure to take you guys home without telling my Mom. She'd get mad at me! I know, maybe my big brother could come with me when he gets home!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mary, I thought you didn't want people knowing about us,&quot; Eric said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's too late for that hon,&quot; Mary said. She looked at the kid. &quot;But seriously kid, we need to keep our being real a secret for as long as we can, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
The kid nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, did you guys used to be girlfriend and boyfriend or something? We're you married? How come you became a girl weasel Mr Eric,&quot; the kid asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ottsel, not weasel. And just Eric please,&quot; Eric said. &quot;And, it was an accident.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, can you really make me a Charizard? You won't make me a girl one will you?&quot; the kid asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's the problem kid, we had to run away after bad stuff happened and we had to leave the stuff that turned us into ottsels behind,&quot; Mary said. &quot;We might have to go to the police to get them back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe I can take you guys to the police and they can help me become a Charizard? That would be so cool! Everyone would think I'm cool and I'd be strong and could fly and...&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric chuckled. &quot;Let's take it one step, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
The kid nodded. &quot;I know I'm not supposed to like girls yet, but you guys -- um girls seem pretty cool for girls.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary smiled. &quot;Just wait until you're a little older bro, then you'll see that girls can be lots of fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess so,&quot; the kid said. &quot;I'm gonna go tell my Mom about you guys. Don't go anywhere!&quot;<br />
<br />
The kid ran off before Eric or Mary could say anything.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess the cat's out of the bag,&quot; Eric said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean ottsel,&quot; Mary said. &quot;So, are you okay Eric?&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric swallowed hard. &quot;To be honest Mary, this um female problem is driving me nuts. I've been excited in that way before of course. Just never as a female and not like this. God, this is so embarrassing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it any worse then having a boner?&quot; Mary asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess not, but it's still embarrassing,&quot; Eric said.<br />
<br />
Mary patted Eric on the back. &quot;Don't worry honey, I'll help you get a release. Just hang on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric nodded his head. He wondered how much longer he could hold on for. He also worried that the kid's mother would react the wrong way to Mary and Eric. Eric could only hope that this kid's family was open minded.</p>
