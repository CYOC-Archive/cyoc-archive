<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><P>Michelle came back out onto the midway with Cynthia filling her up inside.  She felt very aroused, but so dirty since she was still wearing her milk-soaked clothes.  She looked around, and failed to see anything resembling a clothing store.  The entire area seemed to resemble a red light district. Some of the girls looked like Pleasure Island ‘workers’ and were dressed appropriately. They wore the typical hooker attire, fishnets, platform heels, miniskirts, halter-tops, and those were just the things Michelle could name. Then there were the female guests of Pleasure Island who were drunk and stumbling. None of them looking for any guy to be with them since they all had one next to them who was usually drunk and stumbling as well. There were a few single girls around. Some were even talking to the hookers about their clothes. Michelle thought it was funny that there were girls willing to walk the Pleasure Island Red Light District. 

<P>With her clothes as they were, mostly the lack of panties and the smell of milk, she decided she needed to find the Midway with the clothing shops. Michelle really did not like having her skirt blow around exposing her ass on this part of the island. She started to look around for help, but felt Cynthia squirm inside her. The feeling of euphoria causes her to stumble a bit as she walked down the street. She gasped in pleasure and then her face reddened as she drew the attention of several people around her. She would worry about the fact that Cynthia might still be conscious later. 

<P> “Are you ok?” asked a nearby boy, not as drunk as the others. He was still aware enough to notice how she was dressed. Seeing that she was missing panties, he saw a possible opportunity. 

<P> “Mmm… yes.” replied Michelle, trying desperately to ignore the stroking from her friend inside her. It was getting stronger and stronger. Knowing it was moving her closer and closer to organism. She was fighting her reaction to grab her crotch with each pulsating movement from Cynthia. 

<P> “Are you sure?” the boy persisted. He was pretty confident this girl needed something, especially since she was in the red light district. 

<P> “<b> Yes!</b> I’m sure!” Michelle practically screamed as Cynthia hit her g-spot. She was hitting it. She fell to her knees, her hand under her skirt gripping her crotch, covering herself and Cynthia as she let go. A passionate moment of self-pleasure took over. She let out moans and gyrations. She even humped the ground for a moment. When it was all over. She quickly stood up and fixed her skirt.  

<P>The boy looked Michelle over.  His gaze lingered on her crotch, which Michelle had shyly covered with her hands. “Do you want some company?” the boy asked.

<P>Cynthia’s gyrations were making it difficult for her to think clearly, but luckily, they calmed down, knowing that had satisfied their mistress. “No…. Thanks…. I am fine,” she told him off before she started to walk off. She only got a few moments before it hit her. She quickly turned around, forgetting her skirt would blow up which gave the boy a perfect view of private areas. “Actually…. I need some new clothes. Do you think…you could show me…where I could get some,” she asked in a dumb, cute voice. Hoping the boy could be manipulated by a cute girl.

<P> “Yea, sure…follow me. The name’s Erik by the way,” he said before he walked in front of her and started to lead the way. Michelle followed by his side.

<P>Erik and Michelle wound their way through the carnival atmosphere of Pleasure Island.  As they passed several game playing booths, the crowd closed up a bit. Everyone seemed to want to get a view of the games, especially near the wrestling pits. It appeared that no matter what two girls wrestled in, be it Jell-O, Mud, Milk, Whipped Cream, or Jelly (jammed and K-Y) everyone just had to see it. Soon after Michelle looked around and caught a glimpse of three girls playing a frog jumping game.  The oldest of the three was celebrating a victory. As the woman working the booth smiled eagerly, the crowd roared, but again Michelle did not see much as Erik lead her right by it all. He might have gotten them lost anyway since he was looking at Michelle more than half the time. He did not say much either since he was constantly blushing and trying to hide his own arousal. 

<P>The pair passed under a large archway with a sign proclaiming <b> Pleasure Island Fashion Show</b> in bright neon letters.

<P> “Fashion show?” asked Michelle.

<P> “It’s just a name. It is mostly just a bunch of boutiques,” said Erik with a shrug.  “ Kind of just a strip mall. Here we are!”

<P>Michelle looked up and saw that they were at the end of a street lined with clothing shops.  She looked up at Erik and smiled demurely as he looked back at her with his baby blues. “Thanks so much,” she said as she moved in, kissed him on the lips without tongue. She made sure to gently brush his crotch with her hands to distract him before she ran off. “Thanks a bunch. See you around.” Erik was too confused to realize she left him before Michelle vanished into the crowd.

<P><I> Now where to shop, </I> Michelle thought to herself as she looked over the stores. She read each sign trying to find the one she liked best.</p>
