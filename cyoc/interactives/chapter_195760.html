<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sean in his half drunk stupor followed Maureen conga style. His hands were firmly around her hips as she led him to the opposite edge of the dance floor. He loved the way her hips moved beneath the short dress she was wearing. He could feel the lace panties she was wearing under the satin. She was so sexy! Her hips were moving to the beat of the music. It was amazing how much she seemed to have revived. He was unaware that she was looking for Kirsty.<br />
<br />
Suddenly Sean felt hands on his own hips. He looked down to see painted nails on the fingers grasping him. He turned to see it was Kirsty in her green dress who had joined the line. Likewise, Steve was behind her. He gave Kirsty smile then turned back to continue grasping Maureen and follow her around the floor. He exaggerated the wiggle of his bum as he danced hoping he was giving Kirsty as much thrill as Maureen’s wiggling was giving him.<br />
<br />
Maureen continued around the floor searching for Kirsty. She was completely oblivious to the conga line now growing behind her. <br />
<br />
It wasn’t until Maureen had visited all 4 corners of the dance floor that she noticed a conga line forming. During a break in the music she turned to ask Sean if he had seen Kirsty or Steve that she realised she was at eels head. And there was Kirsty just behind Sean with a huge smile on her face. The Conga line extended for at least 20 patrons behind her. Kirsty called out “Don’t stop now. See if you can catch the tail”<br />
<br />
When the music started again she began to lead the way again happy to be the centre of attention. She did try to reach the tail and tried to dance as sexily as she possibly could. She eventually got there. By then the line had completely encircled the dance floor. Maureen triumphantly grabbed the hips of the man at the tail of the line. The DJ even stopped the music briefly to acknowledge Maureen’s achievement “Some applause for the young lady who caught the tail. Well done everyone!”<br />
<br />
Momentarily all Maureen could hear was everyone applauding her. She beamed with pride. However when the music started once more she opted out as did Sean, Kirsty (Or Special K as Maureen had taken to call her) and Steve. It was left for the black woman who had been clasping Steve’s bum to lead the new line.<br />
<br />
Maureen led the others back to the lounge area. Away from the speakers she was able to say. “I was only looking for you to say we were going to leave. I think the others have already gone” She was beaming with pride<br />
<br />
“You were great!” gasped Kirsty “You got everyone going!” She gave Maureen a squeeze. “That was fantastic!”<br />
<br />
“Yeah!” added Sean “That was great fun!” He pressed his luck and gave Maureen a hug much as Kirsty had done. To his surprise the elated Maureen hugged him back then kissed him on the lips. <br />
 <br />
“It takes two to start a conga line. Thank-you!” She then gave him another hug and he was conscious of her breasts pushing against his chest.<br />
<br />
“Believe me the pleasure was all mine” Sean was relieved that he had got a positive response.<br />
<br />
While the ladies collected their handbags from the cloakroom, Steve discretely passed Sean a package and whispered “Just in case”. Sean glanced down to see he had been handed a pack of condoms. <br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think I have a chance?&quot; Sean was doubtful. Maureen had made it very clear she had a steady boyfriend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Man, she&#39;s got the hots for you. Just take it slowly and she will be putty in your hands&quot; Steve did not tell Sean that he had been adding vodka to her drinks all night. Sean did not know what to think. He was naive when it came to woman and Maureen had given him mixed signals all night. <br />
<br />
They left the club and walked the short distance back to the unit complex. Steve held Kirsty’s hand and Sean followed with Maureen. He was pleasantly surprised when she allowed him to hold her hand. Soon somehow Sean found his arm around the girl&#39;s waist. Maureen had felt a bit unsteady in her high heels and manipulated Sean&#39;s arm so that he was steadying her. She was grateful for the strong male body she could lean against. She decided she was just not used to staying up this late.<br />
<br />
Back in the units they found Charlotte and Cameron at it in the room that Sean shared with Cameron. It was Maureen who suggested to Sean “How about you give them some privacy and come to the other unit” They whispered good night to Special K and Steve and entered the girl’s unit. <br />
<br />
As they entered Sean was still confused. Was he meant to use Charlotte’s bed or had she just invited him to share hers? He followed her into the unit.<br />
<br />
Maureen was also in two minds. She had been turned on all night and the euphoric feeling of reaching the tail of the conga line still lingered. That combined with the bringing together of Charlotte and Cameron made her feel on top of the world. She contemplated inviting Sean into her bed.<br />
<br />
It didn’t help that they could hear a bed rocking in Claire’s room.</p>
