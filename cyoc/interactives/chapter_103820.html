<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake picked up the black snapback with white Nike swoosh on the front and sauntered over to the changing room, he had no idea why he had picked it up because it was completely not his hipster style but he was somehow drawn to it like there was something special about it but he couldn&#39;t put his finger on it.<br />
<br />
He entered the changing room and drew the curtain and slowly placed the cap on his head, he adjusted it to fit when a sensation crept across his skin as if hundreds of needles were pricking him, he groaned slightly and quicly took the cap off but it was too late...<br />
<br />
His hands began to change shape growing larger and stronger, the colour changed too, a lighter tone beginning at the fingertips swept its way across his hands and up his arms which began to swell, the veins bulged as muscle filled his scrawny arms, his biceps doubled in size then swelled as if he had injected himself with steroids, his chest began to swell and widen, his shoulders cracked and broadened to support his new muscle. His pecs formed nicely over his muscular frame, his stomach ached as a six pack formed. Jake hunched over even more as the pain entered his legs.<br />
<br />
His legs began to grow too as they reformed as the athletic of someone who went to the gym regularly and his jeans became tighter and tighter. His feet grew to a size 10 the pain of which was excruciating in his small pointed toe shoes, he felt his throat changing, the vocal cords becoming thicker and coarser.<br />
Jake looked up in the mirror and saw his face began to change his eyes pained as if pins had been stuck in them and when he opened them they were no longer blue but a deep shade of brown, his face became firmer and tougher as he watched in fear. The pain then throbbed in his head as his blonde hair darkened to a deep brown, the sides receded into his skull leaving them shaved and the curls on top rearranged themselves into a small neat quiff. The pain entered his manhood and he began to gently moan in pleasure as he felt it growing from a mere 6&#39;&#39; to a massive 9&#39;&#39;.<br />
<br />
The pain ended to Jake&#39;s relief but he then noticed his clothes beginning to change &#39;Fuck no!&#39; he murmured in his new deeper voice. <br />
His brown leather shoes began to grow bigger as the leather was replaced by mesh and plastic, the colour darkened to black and grey and the soles inflated and the sides creased until his brown leather shoes were replaced with a pair of black Nike air max 95s, something then rubbed on his feet as his black socks began to change into a pair of white nike football socks. He looked at them in disgust, they were so chavy, but they somehow felt... right on his feet.<br />
<br />
He felt his jeans, stretched tight loosening, the fabric becoming softer and the blue denin becoming black cotton, they became baggier around his legs, the bottoms tightened as elasticated cuffs formed and his belt merged with the now elasticated waist, a white Nike logo appeared on the upper leg of his new joggers. His tartan shirt changed too growing darker and softer as a hood formed round the back, it became baggier and the buttons melted into the fabric as an EA7 logo emblazoned itself on the chest, a gold chain fastened around his thick neck and some rings wound themselves round his fingers. Jake was hunched over panting when he looked up in the mirror at the new him, his old hipster body gone replaced with a muscular chav body, he recoiled in horror at this but then something clicked, it felt... kinda good... kinda sexy even. He looked down at the Nike snapback on the floor and placed it back on his head. He closed his eyes as his mind began to fog and his memories and thoughts melted away, his IQ plummeted with his former memories and intelligence continuing to melt away &#39;fuuuuck yeaaahh&#39; he groaned as his hands felt their way down his joggers and to his new 9&#39;&#39; cock. He pulled his cock out and began to pump at it slowly at first and began to increase the pace until an electric feeling shot through his body and his cock exploded, he felt his former self pumping out of his dick seeing all his pathetic, weak hipster self splash down the mirror. Tucking his cock back in his trackies he looked again in the cum soaked mirror, now laced with the remnants of who he used to be, &#39;look well fresh mate&#39; he said in a cheeky British accent with a smirk on his face. He looked up at the Nike cap that had started all of this and knew he could change others into roadman followers, afterall he needed a gang and his old friends would do nicely for conversion.......</p>
