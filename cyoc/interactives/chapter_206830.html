<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Sam, we’re all done out here, so you’re done in there we’ll be outta your mane after you sign some stuff.” Sam snapped out of his daze at the sound of the wolf’s voice through the door, his hooves clattering awkwardly against the bathroom tiles as he staggered away from the mirror. Everything felt wrong as he rubbed his hoofed hand against his still-stretching jaw, but the means to express just <i>what</i> was wrong kept on slipping away from him. In his mouth, he ran his tongue over his teeth, feeling a row of massive front teeth and some truly sizeable back teeth that felt like they were taking up half of his entire jaw.<br />
<br />
“<i>Well, why wouldn’t they?</i>” Sam thought. “<i>I need some tough teeth to handle all the greens I gotta eat to handle construction work… A body like this doesn’t fuel itself…</i>”<br />
<br />
&#39;A body like this&#39;? A body like <i>what</i>, exactly? Again, his unconscious mind seemed to keep trying to distract him, to keep him from dwelling too much on the strangeness he had been feeling throughout his body ever since those two construction workers had-<br />
<br />
“Sam? Hello? I’ve heard the term ‘pissing like a racehorse’, but you’re still taking a while in there…” Gio’s voice piped up through the door once again. Sam rolled his eyes and felt his ears twitch at the lame joke. It was one that Sam had obviously heard a million times before. Comes with the territory, after all.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, yeah… I’m coming…”<br />
<br />
Sam trotted over to the door, hooves rhythmically clopping against the tiles, and found himself at eye-level with the top of the door frame, forcing him to bend down to even reach the doorknob. His smooth hoofed fingers slipped against the metal knob, making it frustratingly difficult to even open the door, but eventually he managed it and swung the door open to see Gio grinning appreciatively as he looked up and down Sam’s body.<br />
<br />
“Doorknob trouble, huh? Sorry ‘bout that, we’re actually scheduled to replace the knobs to a universal anthro-friendly design in a couple of weeks. Y’know, works for paws, claws, hooves, and flippers!” Gio replied cheerfully.<br />
<br />
“What about regular hands, though?” Sam asked curiously, looking at his hooves and having an odd image of a five-finger, pink-skinned hand flash through his mind for just a split second.<br />
<br />
“Oh, like what monkeys and gorillas have? Sure, the new knobs will work for them, too.”<br />
<br />
“No, that’s not what I- Damn it!” Sam shouted and he accidentally slammed his head into the door frame as he stepped out of the bathroom. “Since when was the door so fucking short!?”<br />
<br />
“Lazy builders, I tell ‘ya,” Gio sighed as he held Sam’s hoof and gently led him to the couch and helped him sit down. “Constructing buildings to only fit one kinda species like that just makes life harder for the rest of us. Don’t worry, we’re in the process of heightening and widening all the halls and doorways to make bigger anthros like you more at home, but we’re starting on the unoccupied apartments in the building before moving on to the ones that are already rented…”<br />
<br />
It was amazing how quickly Sam was just letting all these words wash over him like they were perfectly normal. Universal designs. Different species. <i>Anthro</i>. That was the word that kept on popping up, despite the fact that he could probably count on his fingers the times he’d heard it said in everyday conversation before today. And with only six fingers total, that isn’t very many times at all.<br />
<br />
Sam’s face continued to ache as he could see his muzzle pushing out ever-so-slightly longer, his teeth grinding as they shuffled around to grow into his much larger jaw. He even felt a moment of vertigo as his eyes slightly shifted place on his head, moving slightly closer to the sides of his face and widening his field of vision by a few barely-noticeable degrees. At the end of his muzzle, his nostrils widened and flared out, letting in the hot, slightly sweaty scent of the two anthros that were currently renovating his apartment. He felt his cock throb in his shorts, which by now were at the point of bursting trying to contain his massive equipment, and his thick, half-hard dick slipped down the leg of his shorts since it no longer had anywhere else to go.<br />
<br />
“Sam? We just need you to sign a few things to confirm we completed everything. Here, I’ll get a penis so you-,” Gio said, then he stopped himself as he realized what he had said. Sam could see a blush forming under the short fur along Gio’s muzzle and ears and he could smell the waves of arousal wafting off the clearly flustered wolf. “I-I mean a pen. Let me find one really dick. Quick. Shit, I-”<br />
<br />
Sam could see Gio glancing down at Sam’s crotch, trying desperately not to get caught. Following the wolf’s line-of-sight, Sam looked down as well and saw the thick outline underneath his shorts growing longer and longer with each passing second. Not getting longer from arousal, just… longer. Thicker. Snaking down his pant leg until Sam could feel cold air against the tip as it finally poked out from the bottom of his shorts to reveal…<br />
<br />
“What the fuck is that!?” Sam exploded as he saw the mottled skin and flattened tip of what was unmistakably not his dick. It had to be nearly a foot and a half long and as thick as a beer bottle, a manhood that any man would be over the moon to have. But Sam knew what his cock looked like, and that wasn’t it. Whatever block in his head that was keeping him from realizing what was happening just couldn’t keep up when Sam was confronted with the massive, throbbing horse cock currently pressed against his leg by his absurdly tight shorts.<br />
<br />
Speaking of which…<br />
<br />
<i><b>RRRRRIPPP!!</b></i><br />
<br />
With a powerful flex of his ripped thigh muscles, the flimsy fabric of Sam’s shorts finally shredded itself, letting his enormous balls and their thin coating of black horsehair out into the open air. A cloud of warm, musky air wafted off his crotch to fill the entire apartment and Sam’s massive horsehood throbbed again to grow nearly completely erect and start to drool a few heady trickles of precum down its length.<br />
<br />
Out of the corner of his eye, Sam spotted a familiar black and white furred head poke its way into the room, probably attracted by the masculine scent currently emanating around them.<br />
<br />
“...Shit, Gio. You’re not supposed to let ‘em see their cock ‘til they’re all the way done,” Hank groaned. “Too much of a shock, the boss said…”<br />
<br />
“Well, it’s not like I had a choice! <i>Someone</i> forgot to install the pheromone filter in the ducts, so no wonder he got turned on!” Gio growled, the fur on his tail bristling even as it continued to wag happily back and forth at the sight of Sam’s massive endowment. But, his excitement was short-lived as Sam rose up to his intimidating full height and grabbed Gio by the front of his high-vis jacket and lifted him right in the air and let his paws dangle.<br />
<br />
“<i>Explain. Now</i>,” Sam snorted quietly, his nostrils flaring and his ears flicking as Gio and Hank both stared down the muzzle of a very annoyed horse.</p>
