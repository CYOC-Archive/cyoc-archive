<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After a short drive, the pair arrived at 'Bry and Sy Autobody'.  Jay pulled into the parking lot alongside his father's car and and cut the engine.  He now had fond memories of working alongside his father, grandfather, and twin brother at the shop after graduating high school.  Jay had never considered attending a college.  For one, his family couldn't afford it.  For another, there was nothing a college could teach him that he couldn't learn from his father and grandfather.<br />
<br />
The pair stepped from the car and made their way to the garage.  There, Jay could see a rusty old truck with its hood propped open.  Peering inside was the large figure of his grandfather, nearing his sixties.  Jay could see Simon's legs sticking out from underneath the truck.<br />
<br />
Simon tweaked something with a wrench.  &quot;How's that, Dad?&quot;<br />
<br />
Bryan shook his head.  &quot;I don't see any difference.  Try another one.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bryan then looked up to see Jay and Mark walk in and a smile lit up his chubby old face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jay!  Mark!  How are my favorite grandsons?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jay could tell Mark felt a little awkward at first, especially when Bryan embraced them both in a large bear hug.  But he quickly seemed to get over it.<br />
<br />
&quot;We're your only grandsons,&quot; Mark replied dryly.<br />
<br />
Bryan chuckled.  &quot;Of course.  Now then, Jay, take this flashlight and take a look down there, would you please?  My eyes aren't what they used to be.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jay nodded and took the small light from his grandfather and peered down at the engine, immediately seeing the problem.&quot;<br />
<br />
Simon pulled himself out from under the truck and wiped the sweat from his brow.  He stood up and stretched a crook out of his back.  He looked at Jay and Mark and felt a wave of confusion encompass him as he gained new memories.<br />
<br />
He had twins now.  Well, he always had twins.  They'd recently graduated and worked at the shop.  Jay had no plans for college, but Mark had been considering it.  Jay had put on some weight his last year at school and after graduation.  He had a noticeable gut and was heftier at nineteen than Simon himself had been.  Mark differentiated himself by growing a beard and keeping it restricted to his jawline.  He had kept himself fit and so far hadn't developed the characteristic flab his brother, father, and grandfather had.  Both boys, being twins, liked very similar, otherwise.  This included the receded hairline.  Also, now that Jay was bent over looking into the truck's hood, Simon could tell his hair was beginning to thin at the back, as was Mark's.<br />
<br />
At first, Simon was concerned he suddenly had twin sons.  But hadn't he always had twin sons?  No, there were only three of them before... before...  So many conflicting memories.  He couldn't think straight!<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you alright, uh, Dad?&quot; asked Mark, getting used to the new familial relationships.<br />
<br />
Simon shook his head, seeing the worried look on his son's face.  He smiled reassuringly.  &quot;Of course, son.  Everything's fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jay grabbed a nearby baseball cap and put in on backwards, then peered back into the truck's hood.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, guys.  Let's fix this thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
_______________________________________________<br />
<br />
The four of them worked for the rest of the day, fixing vehicles and changing tires for a variety of customers.  Throughout the day, the Chronivac did its work, aging people at a rate of 5 years per 24 hours (or 1 year per 10.9 hours).  <br />
<br />
As the day wore on, Jay's waistline continued to expand, a combination of Jay's lax diet and his family genes kicking in.  When Jay took off his hat to wipe his brow, Simon was briefly surprised to see a bald spot on the back of Jay's head, before his new memories asserted themselves and he saw it as the normal progression of Bryan's high-testosterone genetic line.  He felt a little sad to see his son losing his hair and physique so early in his life (he was only in his early twenties!).  Jay had also developed a goatee around his mouth.<br />
<br />
Mark had also developed a bald spot and his hair had receded more to math Jay's.  To compensate, Mark's hair became closely cropped.  He had managed to keep in shape while Jay became more round.  In fact he became more muscular and he found himself doing more heavy lifting around the shop as the day wore on.  What was extra strange was the more work he did, the more he found himself instinctively knowing about the inner workings of automobiles.<br />
<br />
Both boys developed more body hair as they moved into their early twenties.  Possibly to compensate for the lessening of the hair on their heads, the dark hair on their arms thickened, as did their hair on their chests and most of the rest of their bodies.<br />
<br />
Simon changed little as he moved into his early forties.  His stomach expanded slightly and some more grey appeared in his beard, which lengthened slightly.  Throughout the day he found himself trusting the boys to do more and more work around the shop.<br />
<br />
Bryan aged noticeably as he moved into his early sixties.  His stomach had ceased to expand, or at least did so very little.  His grey hair had begun to transition into white.  His glasses grew slightly thicker and he found himself doing less physical work around the shop and did more to teach his grandsons.<br />
<br />
Finally, the work day came to a close.  Simon checked his watch.<br />
<br />
8:00pm<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, boys!  Let's wrap it up and go home!&quot; he said.  Simon watched as his sons made their way to their car.<br />
<br />
After them trudged Bryan, wheezing slightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You gonna be alright, Dad?&quot; Simon asked Bryan.<br />
<br />
Bryan nodded.  &quot;Fine, fine.  See you at home.&quot;<br />
<br />
Simon hopped into his own car and made his way home, smiling the whole way.<br />
<br />
In the boy's car, Mark and Jay were having a conversation.<br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; said Jay, as they left the shop.  &quot;What do you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark shrugged.  &quot;It's... It's weird.  But it feels natural, but that makes it weird!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jay chuckled.  &quot;So... you like it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark grinned.  &quot;I love it!  It's like I'm really part of a family!  More so than I used to be.&quot;  He rubbed a hand over his bald spot.  &quot;I could do without the early-onset balding, though.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jay laughed.  &quot;Welcome to the family.&quot;<br />
<br />
_____________________________________<br />
<br />
At home, Simon settled into his usual place in his recliner in front of the television with a can of beer.  He saw Jay and Mark walk in, each holding a beer.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what do you think you're doing with those?&quot; questioned Simon.<br />
<br />
Jay smirked and cracked the tab on his can.  &quot;I'm over 21, Dad.&quot;<br />
<br />
Simon thought for a moment.  So they were.  How had he forgotten?<br />
<br />
The family talked for a bit and watched television, before going to bed for the night to prepare to work the next day.<br />
<br />
Sometime around midnight, Jay and Mark turned 22 while Simon turned 42 and Bryan turned 62.</p>
