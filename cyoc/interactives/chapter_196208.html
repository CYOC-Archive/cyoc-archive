<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Christine was enjoying her time with Johnny, but there was one thing that was irking her so she asked &quot;Say Johnny... could you turn me into a man?&quot;<br />
Johnny nearly choked on the food he was eating till he willed it to disappear as he said &quot;What?!?&quot; more out of confusion than out of real shock.<br />
&quot;Well... When you first made me I had a penis even though I identified as a woman... If I&#39;m going to figure out who I am wouldn&#39;t it make sense if I could figure out if I&#39;m more comfortable as a man or a woman?&quot; Christine asked.<br />
&quot;Fair point... If you feel like you want to stay a man feel free, but I&#39;m not really into men that way...&quot; Johnny almost didn&#39;t say what he did, but he felt he should at least be honest. <br />
&quot;Maybe you could turn into a woman if I felt more comfortable as a man?&quot;<br />
&quot;...Sorry, but I feel very comfortable as a man.&quot; Johnny first tried to imagine what it would be like being a woman, but immediately stopped considering what his imagination created and him... being somewhat afraid of what he might find. &quot;I&#39;d be fine turning you into a man if your fine with it though.&quot;<br />
&quot;Could you? Although if I hate it, would it bother you if I changed back?&quot;<br />
&quot;I like your current form, and my infinite power to do anything wont get any smaller.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well you don&#39;t have to get sarcastic...&quot; Christine stated as Johnny started to imagine. He started imagining Chris, but that wasn&#39;t right... Even though Chris was the base and in some way Johnny could imagine them being twins... they&#39;d be Fraternal twins and Christine wasn&#39;t just Chris with a pair of tits strapped on. They were different. Physically there were changes here and there... Maybe a little less fat... Maybe slightly bulgier muscles... Johnny ended up giving Christine a penis more similar to his own as that was his reference for a &quot;slightly above average sized dick&quot; to him at least... A few touches here and there... would he be hairy? Let&#39;s say he&#39;d have a good amount of chest and groin hair and leave it at that for now...<br />
A deeper and slightly louder voice said &quot;Holy Shit! It worked!&quot; Johnny stopped daydreaming his changes and actually looked to see the man he had imagined had materialized and... Well Johnny had heard of porn where a woman in tight clothes pops some buttons, but Christine&#39;s chest had flattened and the only reason the shirt&#39;s buttons had been flung off was due to the sheer width of her chest instead of her breast&#39;s actual size. <br />
Johnny blushed a little bit and said &quot;I probably should&#39;ve shifted your clothes a bit as well.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes please&quot; Christine stated as his blouse turned into a button downed collared shirt, and the once form fitting jeans turned into somewhat loose jeans.  He seemed to try to &quot;feel&quot; whatever it meant to feel like being male when being in a male body and tried to drink a bit and have some more of the BBQ food. However a bit later said &quot;Can I go back and feel what it&#39;s like to be a woman?&quot; Johnny sighed and Christine turned back into her female form and looked a little cute in her much larger male form&#39;s clothes as it drapped over her and nearly let her breast&#39;s nipple show... Johnny looked to the sea for a second as he turned her clothes back. She then tried to feel the whole womanhood to try to compare it to her recent experience of maleness and then a few seconds later asked &quot;So... can I?&quot;<br />
Johnny could see how this was going and imagined a booth of sorts and said &quot;Just so you don&#39;t have to keep asking&quot; the imagined booth which resembled a phone booth with a stool inside materialized and he said &quot;There, have a Sex Chamber! If you want to change sex just go in and press the button and you and your clothes will change sex!&quot; There may have been a bit more of anger or annoyance in his voice than he intended. &quot;Sorry... felt like this would be get annoying too soon.&quot; <br />
Christine said &quot;No, I did just get 2 sex changes in quick succession. Sorry for pestering you...&quot; The two just ate for a bit and then Christine looked to the booth once or twice and then asked &quot;So does that actually work?&quot;<br />
Johnny thought and said &quot;I don&#39;t actually know. Maybe? or it could just be a booth with a random button in it.&quot; Christine had a smirk on her face and got up and walked to the booth, and instead of taking a seat she just leaned in and pressed the button and the male version of Christine Johnny had imagined came out. <br />
A few moments later Johnny asked &quot;So you feel good with the dick?&quot; at which point Christine went back into the Sex Chamber and turned back into her &quot;normal&quot; form. Every so often Christine would switch back and forth from male and female unsure of which she felt a larger connection to and Johnny gave himself a mental high five as he saved himself a whole lot of pestering to change her form back and forth. <br />
<br />
It was getting late so Johnny said &quot;Well I think it&#39;s time to go to sleep so... What better place to go to sleep on a beach, but a...&quot; Johnny imagined a large building fully furnished with kitchen appliances, bedrooms, entertainment rooms, bowling, a spa, a bathroom, and so much more... made up of sandstone &quot;... Sand Castle!!!&quot; Christine may have been only a few hours old, but even she didn&#39;t find the pun that funny. She did however enjoy the interior a decent amount. The Sandstone that compromised the structure was well fortified so it acted more like cement, and the floor felt soft like the sand of the beach without getting everywhere like sand usually does. The only issue was that Johnny had been drunk while designing everything in his mind, but since they were both drunk they didn&#39;t notice as they went into the same bedroom and took a nap. <br />
<br />
Johnny had woke up to find...</p>
