<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">James crashed through the bedroom door, the heavy odor of boarish sex hit him like a hammer. The hot musky smell making him cover his mouth and nose with one hand. &quot;*squeal* don&#39;t stop! Don&#39;t stop! *squeal*&quot; yelled Maggie as Nolan continued to plow into her, well aware of James&#39;s presence. <br />
<br />
James was fixated on the sight before him, the large fat mass of Nolan&#39;s backside wedged between Maggie&#39;s thighs. In fact they were wrapped around his waist pulling him in. She was able to look around Nolan, spotting James disgusted expression. For a moment she was terrified, she&#39;d been caught in the act. Nolan gave her another good thrust and suddenly she didn&#39;t care! This was the best fucking she&#39;d ever had! Like sex for the first time! Her new boar was all she needed now, he&#39;d take care of her. <br />
<br />
James turned away from the sight, heading to the closet. He grabbed a gym bag and started stuffing it with clothes and other items. Still covering his mouth from the smell as Nolan and Maggie grunted and squealed together in their rut. <br />
<br />
He made for the door, his hand on the knob as he looked back once again at the scene. Nolan thrusted harder and harder as Maggie&#39;s fat fingers curled into the bed sheets. Her back stiffened and she panted heavily. Her pussy clenched tighter and tighter around Nolan&#39;s cock. It became too much for him, he was getting close to his limit. Suddenly Maggie cried out in ecstasy! It grew into a sharp squeal and Nolan felt her juices dripping out of her sex, the fresh scent sending him over the edge as he pulled out just in time as he came, hard! Harder than ever before spewing his seed over Maggie&#39;s gargantuan ass and flabby back. His afterglow just setting in when he heard the door behind him slam shut, the smacking crack of it shaking the room. <br />
<br />
Mission accomplished! <br />
<br />
Maggie lied limp in the bed sheets still rocked by the orgasm. Nolan steadied himself, his knees still weak from his own climax. Another slam from downstairs signaled James’s exit. It was time to end this now he decided.<br />
<br />
He lumbered to the door in his large bulking body, bracing against the door as his legs were still jittery. He continued to the bathroom closing the door behind him as he opened the menu to the watch finding the reset option. <br />
<br />
He applied it to himself and watched in the mirror as his body changed back. His thick body hair and bristles sank into his skin. The layer of fat melted revealing his muscles beneath. His frame shrank back down as his boar features faded. His tusks retreated back into his jaw as his nose shrank back to a point. His body reached its old shape though his muscles still rippled over his body, giving him the physique of a body builder. &quot;Can&#39;t say I wouldn&#39;t mind these.&quot; He sighed as his body began to streamline the muscles fizzling as they deflated under his skin. He didn&#39;t notice his fingers return along with his feet. Lastly his oversized cock returned to normal size much to his disappointment.<br />
<br />
It was all done, even the small tail disappeared without his notice. Nolan was back to his original self. He slipped back into his clothes, grateful that he had the mind to remove them earlier. Fully dressed he peeked out the door, he could hear the worn out bed creaking under Maggie&#39;s weight as she recovered from her orgasm. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, this is too good.&quot; He said to himself as he went back to the mirror. Making himself look busy. Through the door he could hear her trotters click against the floor as she chased after her boar, heading his way. <br />
<br />
She burst through the door longing for her boar but only saw Nolan as he finished pulling his pants up. &quot;Whoa lady! Can I have some privacy?&quot; He shouted at her, turning away to zip his fly. <br />
&quot;B-b-but you... You were just...&quot; Maggie stuttered. <br />
&quot;Just using the bathroom? Yeah! Before you barged in here, geez!&quot;<br />
Maggie stood in the small bathroom completely beside herself. Nolan struggled to squeeze past her. &quot;Awkward interruptions aside i&#39;ll go wait outside, thank you again for letting me use your phone.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nolan hurried out of the house not wanting Maggie to ask anymore questions. He quickly made it across the street and into his building and up to his third floor apartment. With an uplifting glow of accomplishment he sat in his chair looking out the window into the dark sky, only a few stars hung in the night. Below he could see Maggie wandering around the yard, still searching for her lost suitor. <br />
<br />
Nolan decided to have just a little more fun with her. He targeted her with the watch and undid her changes. He watched her fat body deflate like a balloon back into her slender frame, her swine features becoming more human and her hygiene returning. In seconds she returned to her slender curvy figure, standing naked in her yard under the street light. As reality shifted back to normal she shrieked as she realized her nudity and ran back into the house.<br />
<br />
Nolan chuckled at her panicked dash inside. Things were sure to be quieter around the neighborhood from now on, and Maggie was a good time. Maybe her could practice with the watch on her in the future? <br />
<br />
He glanced at the clock on the wall, it was far later than he&#39;d thought it was. Nolan made his way to the bathroom and took a shower, scrubbing his skin raw to clean away the lingering odor of hot musk and sex. It was refreshing to say the least, while he was transformed he&#39;d enjoyed it, but now it was repulsive to him again. After he cleaned up he headed to bed, passing out before he could rest his head on the pillow. <br />
<br />
The next morning came harshly. First with the loud piercing buzz of his alarm clock, then the sore ache of his body. His encounter with Maggie must have taken more out of him than he expected.<br />
<br />
He fixed himself breakfast and put on his semi-formal work attire. He was just about leave the apartment, his hand on the knob when he remembered the watch, yesterday felt like a dream. He contemplated just what to do with his day now. With the watch it&#39;s not like he needed to work to live.</p>
