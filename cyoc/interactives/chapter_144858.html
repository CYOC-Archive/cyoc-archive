<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It had been five days and Tobias was at close to the point where he believed he would never find his way out of the forest. As he stared into a pond at his reflection, he thought, &quot;The only thing I seem to be able to find is that stupid cabin,&quot; and baring his teeth, he turned his head one way, then another.<br />
<br />
He couldn&#39;t recall when his teeth had changed, or when his ears had become pointed. There was so many mysterious about what was going on, including why it was he felt so horny all the time and why it didn&#39;t bother him that his only companion was a wolf, he couldn&#39;t begin to unravel any of them. Looking back, seeing the grey wolf laying down, tongue lolling out as it casually regarded him, Tobias looked away after a moment and stared at the seat of his pants. Poking out of a hole he had crudely chopped into the fabric with a sharp rock was his tail which left him experiencing a series of mixed emotions as he thought about he could relax it, tighten it and cause it to wag back and forth. Eventually losing interest in the fur-clad appendage, figuring there wasn&#39;t anything he could do about it at the moment, he turned back to his reflection.<br />
<br />
His teeth, he felt, confirmed what he was sure was happening to him. Yet, at the same time, he didn&#39;t want to acknowledge that he was turning into a dog. He didn&#39;t want to believe he had a tail that was covered in white fur, ears that almost looked like dog ears and a mouth full of sharp teeth that helped him to rip apart his food. His thoughts drifting to how he&#39;d taken to hunting and eating his food raw, he shivered and cupping his hand, he dipped it into the water. Drinking greedily, Tobias eventually stood and gazed back at the wolf. Muttering, &quot;I need to get out of here,&quot; he looked about and chose a direction.<br />
<br />
Certain sooner or later he&#39;d end up back at the cabin, he varied the direction he was going, sometimes even abruptly switching in mid-stride. Breathing the air, his penis hard and throbbing for attention, he tried to think of anything besides it. His mind settling on his brother, he huffed in agitation as he thought about how, two days ago, he&#39;d swallowed his pride, gone up to the cabin and knocked. Hoping Mathew was still around, wanting only to apologise and see if his brother could help him, Tobias was upset when nobody answered. Letting himself in the cabin, he made a quick sweep of the building, calling his brother&#39;s name every so often, but soon came to the conclusion Mathew wasn&#39;t around.<br />
<br />
Certain that his brother had been rescued, wanting to know why he hadn&#39;t, Tobias had stormed out. Angry that his brother had essentially turned his back on him, Tobias took to wandering the woods in an attempt to find his own way out. Eventually, he again cooled down and figured it was his own fault, as he had been roaming the woods whilst his brother had remained in a spot that was sure to get him noticed and rescued.<br />
<br />
A noise from behind him abruptly disrupted his train of thoughts, he looked back and noted the wolf was still following. On a couple times, after he&#39;d gotten over his shock that the one animal he&#39;d encountered and was friendly was not a dog as he believed, he tried to chase the animal away. But it wouldn&#39;t take the hint and, in the end, Tobias had resigned himself to the fact that his current companion was a grey wolf. And after a bit, he actually got used to it, as the animal was helpful, especially when Tobias was hungry. Staring at the wolf as it drew closer, Tobias almost shuddered at the thought of what he did the first night. Studying the animal, thinking there was something was different about it, he watched as the wolf butted against him, made a couple noises. And when it nibbled at the hem of his shirt and parts of his pants, he tried hard not to grimace when his erection began to throb even more.<br />
<br />
It slowly coming to him that the wolf he was looking was a different one, that it was a female, he watched as the animal bounded away. Presenting her back side to him, the animal turned, ran closer, bumped into him and nipped at his pants. His mind screaming that something was off, Tobias breathed deeply in an attempt to clear his mind, but instead found a rich, tantalising scent tickling his olfactory senses. Shutting his eyes, trying to find a way to block it out, he breathed heavily through his mouth as he listened and felt the creature continue to make the same sounds and go through the same motions.<br />
<br />
Unable to stand it an longer, Tobias snapped open his eyes and kicked off his shoes. Fumbling, he undid his pants. Pushing down down, he breathed in the same smell, which he understood was coming from the wolf. His erect member tingling in a needful manner, he stepped closer to the animal, leaned down and stuck his nose into the area beneath her tail. Smelling the sex, his tongue flicking out to taste the sex hormones, Tobias tried to tell himself, &quot;Stop this. It isn&#39;t right,&quot; but, instead he stood up and instead, took a step closer.<br />
<br />
The wolf, knowing exactly what she wanted, presented herself in a way to say she was ready. Tobias, his resolve utterly failing, didn&#39;t need any other hint and Stepping closer, he shifted until he could penetrate the bitch. A moment of alarm washing over him when his penis softened a bit, it immediately passed the moment he smelled her sex and the tip of his shaft brushed against her vagina opening. Completely losing all self-control, Tobias did give it a second thought as he thrust into her.<br />
<br />
As all this transpired, his ears shifted upward to the top of his head. As white fur sprouting over them, he grunted and uttered a series of barking whining noises. His penis remaining in a semi-flaccid state, he pushed harder, deeper, as an instinct drove him on. And as his human genitals began to morph, a baculum bone and bulbus glandis formed, Tobias suddenly realised what he was doing. Wanting to stop, he tried to pull away. But finding her vaginal walls constricting tightly as his penis grew hard again, which effectively knoted them in place, he was alarmed to find his control slipping once again. And as he thrust into the wolf, a penis sheath forming as he did, it wasn&#39;t long before they both climaxed. The changes cementing in place, Tobias was blissfully unaware of this as he leaned back his head and uttered a series of noises to announce how content he was.<br />
<br />
Afterward, when he&#39;d finally be able to disengage himself, he watched the grey wolf wander off before looking down. To his horror, he thought at first he didn&#39;t have a penis any more, whilst, at the same time, he was certain that something about his scrotum looked off. Staring at the his transformed genitalia, Tobias soon came to understand that he still had his penis, it was just now housed in a sheath. Searching for his pants, he eventually found them and pulling them back on, making sure as he did that his tail poked comfortably out the back, he soon discovered that the reason his scrotum appeared weird was because it was empty.<br />
<br />
Distraught over this, a need to howl in alarm washing over him, he stalked off. Slapping low hanging branches out of his way, forgetting his shoes, Tobias found his mind in a constant state of chaotic flux as he tried to sort out what had happened and instead worried about what could happen. Hours later, when he was finally able to calm down, and realise that one of the wolves was once again following him, Tobias stopped and for the first time, used his new penis to pee. As he did this, and he suddenly remembered that he&#39;d forgotten his shoes, it dawned on him that he hadn&#39;t lost his testicles as he touched two lumps at the base of his penis. Slowly beginning to understand that his testicles were simply in a different location, he found himself scared by this new development and confused as to why his testes were now affixed to the base of his penis. Watching as the organ slipped back into the sheath, he pulled up his pants, silently muttering, &quot;I need to get out of here before anything else happens me,&quot; as he did so.</p>
