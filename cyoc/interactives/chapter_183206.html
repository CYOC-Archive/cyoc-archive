<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After the high of the moment died out, Red realized what just had happened and felt ashamed that she was so eager to do it, that she apparently was ready to fuck anyone or anything as long as they/it had a dick and was bigger than her. <br />
<br />
She cleared her head and finished her visit with her grandma, before heading home. She forgot all about her agreement to do the same dance with the wolf tomorrow too. So, while she was bringing more sweets to her grandmother&#39;s place, Red was quickly reminded. The wolf didn&#39;t even hesitate this time, and just stole the basket, knocked her down onto all fours, ripped a hole in her panties and went to town with his tongue. He only said a greeting and not much else.<br />
<br />
Red again, initially resisted, but again, that resistance didn&#39;t last long. Her cock was hard and her pussy was soaked by the time the wolf vanished once again, leaving Red in a frustratingly annoyed state. On one hand, she was glad this was all that happened. But on another, she was annoyed that she is so submissive to him and even further bothered by the fact that she was frustrated that she couldnt do more with him today since he fled too quickly.<br />
<br />
Red got up once again, cleaned herself up, and left again for her grandma&#39;s house, leaving the rage she cleaned herself up with behind for the lusty wolf to enjoy and hopefully either be satisfied with that, or do more to her tomorrow. She did wish that he just move her panties or pull them down though. <br />
<br />
This time she didn&#39;t forget about what was waiting for her at the crossroads. Today she planned to just bypass the intersection and just cut through the forest all together.<br />
<br />
But this plan was a bust. She ended up getting all turned around and lost, only to have the Wolf find her, eat her out, then awkwardly guide her out of the woods in her third pair of torn panties. <br />
<br />
On the fourth day, she tried wearing a disguise. The wolf of course wasn&#39;t fooled at all, since Duncan girls can&#39;t pull off disguise with asses like theirs. Plus he could smell her horny sex and hear her cheeks clapping from a mile away. He did get a good laugh out of her poor attempt at it though. <br />
<br />
As if it had become a game. Each day Red would try something new, and the Wolf would see through it every time. After another week of failed attempts, Red was just going there to make an attempt. Her Grandmother was all better now and she had no more reason to make the routine daily trip. But she still went for the sake of not letting the wolf win at least once. But each attempt always ended the same way. Her with a freshly licked pussy, and a useless pair of ripped panties. <br />
<br />
Today was the 15 day of this. And Red was kind of not in the mood. She couldn&#39;t think up a new plan on how to win, so she would just pass on today&#39;s attempt. She finished her shift at the pastry shop and walked to the meeting spot near the crossroads. Sure enough there was the wolf, sitting there waiting for her to come.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Wolf.&quot; Red said casually. <br />
&quot;What, no gimmick or schemes today, Red?&quot;<br />
&quot;Nah, maybe tomorrow. I am kind of taking today off.&quot; Said Red, getting down onto all fours without even needing to be asked. She had by now gotten use to the position and knew exactly at which height to raise her ass to. <br />
<br />
The wolf just shrugged and got up. As he is not one to pass up a free sampling of his favorite cake, he walked over and just went with the flow. &quot;Huh, no panties today Red?&quot; <br />
&quot;Well, there would be no reason to wear them here just to have them get shredded, right?&quot;<br />
&quot;Fair point I guess.&quot; The Wolf starts his daily sampling like usual.<br />
<br />
Maybe it was because she didnt even try to fight it, and just went along with it, but Red was finding today&#39;s session to be more casual and more stimulating for some reason. Her mind was just more focused on the tongue licking her than usual. It was nice to just enjoy the free service this time, without having to spend the extra effort. It isn&#39;t like anything really changes in the end. She feels nice for a while, then walks home with a moist pussy and an erection. <br />
<br />
After a while the Wolf stops and stands up. For the first time, Red realizes this right away, as she isn&#39;t quite as distracted, and looks back in time to see him disappear behind a tall nearby tree. &quot;Huh, so that&#39;s how you do it.&quot; Red said to herself and stood up. <br />
<br />
There was a slight breeze today, and she currently was down wind from the Wolf. So she had an idea. She just sat there in the grass and said that she was leaving like she usually does now. Then she wiggled a bit, making it sound like she was leaving. Sure enough, the Wolf waited for a bit, then walked out, only to be startled by the sight of her still sitting there. <br />
<br />
&quot;Your still here?&quot; Said The Wolf surprised.<br />
&quot;Yeah, I have nothing else to do today. And it is peaceful in the woods. So I thought I would just stick around here for a bit and just relax. Why, am I not allowed to or something?&quot;<br />
&quot;By all means, stay.&quot;<br />
&quot;Thanks.&quot; <br />
&quot;Hey Red, why do you keep comming back here every day? I know your Grandmother&#39;s no longer I&#39;ll, so for what reason? And especially today. You didn&#39;t even have a plan or anything. You just came here.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well we do have an agreement. But also I was doing it for my own pride, and I guess because it is kind of fun too. Plus even if I lose, I win. You are pretty good at licking me, Wolf.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well I do enjoy the taste.&quot;<br />
&quot;That oddly makes me happy to hear. Hey, look at me, sitting in the grass while going fully commando, just casually talking to a wolf about how good he is at eating me out on a daily basis. If anyone from town were to see me, they would think I have lost my mind or say that I am a hopeless pervert.&quot;<br />
&quot;Are you a hopeless pervert?&quot;<br />
&quot;I guess to an extent at least. I mean, I don&#39;t walk through the woods daily to pick the flowers after all. And today I had decided to not wear underwear, even while at work, just for this.&quot;<br />
&quot;I see your point.&quot;<br />
Red laid down onto her back, which due to her ass and hips, looked more like an awkward attempt at a bridge stretch than a comfortable resting position. But she was use to it. She didn&#39;t even care that anyone could see up her skirt at her naked crotch if they were to just walk by. Her huge errection wouldn&#39;t have hid them anyways. <br />
<br />
After a while, Red speaks up, breaking the peaceful silence. &quot;Hey Wolf, do you ever want to do anything more than just lick my pussy? Not that I am necessarily offering, but I am curious. Like do you ever want to just have actual sex? Or if that is too boring, you could have me fuck your ass with my dick. Or we could even give each other hand/blowjobs? Hell, I could titty fuck you I guess as well. You know, now that I hear myself saying all of this, fuck it, I guess I am offering. If you ever wanted to, that is.&quot;</p>
