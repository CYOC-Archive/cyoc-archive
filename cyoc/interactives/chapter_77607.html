<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After a while of playing games, Jake got up and grabbed a couple of slices of the pizza. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, can you get me one?&quot; said Axel, jerking and tilting the controller.<br />
<br />
Jake rolled his eyes and tore the pie apart with his fingers, getting three more paper plates of pizza for his brother and buds. They scarfed down the cheesy slices and paused the game to help themselves to seconds.<br />
<br />
Pablo looked bored. &quot;Man, this is cool and all, but I wish something exciting would happen in this town for once.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They're putting in a new shopping plaza,&quot; Axel quipped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly. Lame ass boring shit you'd see in nowheresville America. So instead of fighting crime or something we're going to spend the whole summer playing Halo.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zack snorted. &quot;Fighting crime?&quot;<br />
<br />
Pablo frowned and grinned sheepishly. &quot;Yeah, I don't know why I said that. Still though, you know what I mean, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We could take up a martial art or something. Like Karate or Muay Thai or something,&quot; offered Jake, helping himself to a third slice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Karate? Really? Could you be any more lame?,&quot; complained Axel.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? I've always wanted to be able to do a flip. Being able to beat up bad guys and being all stealthy and shit, that would be totally tubular too,&quot; said Jake defensively.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tubular? Haha, now you sound like a surfer or a ... &quot; Axel was cut off from a loud gurgling in his stomach. He frowned and sunk back into the couch rubbing his stomach.<br />
<br />
Pablo glanced sideways at Axel, &quot;Day old Domino's taking effect, eh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up. I probably just ate too fast.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zack tilted his head back and slowly, deliberately dropped a slice into his gullet. &quot;Or not fash enough.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zack gulped and then said, &quot;Being a ninja would be pretty radical.&quot;<br />
<br />
His stomach gurgled too.<br />
<br />
He slid back on the couch some and spread his legs out a little.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd like to learn how to skateboard. Maybe lose some of this weight.&quot; He grabbed some of his pudge and began opening and closing his legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, then maybe you could score a chick for once in your life,&quot; Axel sniped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey guys, stop! This is no way to work as a team.&quot; Jake sounded almost boyishly naive. <br />
<br />
The other three stared at him quizzically. Jake stood and blinked, a bit stunned as well. An awkward moment passed.<br />
<br />
Axel suddenly let out a moan, clutching his stomach again. Everyone looked at him except Zack, who had his eyes closed and was beginning to sweat a little. <br />
<br />
&quot;Axel, man, you don't look so good,&quot; Pablo said, concerned.<br />
<br />
Axel was beginning to sweat too. His stomach felt tight but he didn't feel nauseous. <br />
<br />
Zack moaned again. He was swinging his knees in and out. An erection tented his sweatpants.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gross dude, what the fuck!&quot; cried Pablo.<br />
<br />
&quot;Feels so.. gnarly.&quot; moaned Zack lasciviously. Axel was doubled over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jake, man, we need to call an ambulance or someth-  Jake?&quot;<br />
<br />
Pablo looked over at Jake, who was on his knees and hunched over the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel so... strange.&quot; moaned Jake.<br />
<br />
Pablo began to panic, not sure what to do.<br />
<br />
&quot;My hair!&quot; cried Axel. Clumps of it were in his fists.<br />
<br />
Zack's face was beginning to swell a bit. He continued playing with his knob through his sweatpants.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aarrrggck&quot; cried Jake. His back arched violently.<br />
<br />
Pablo's panic made him feel like his shirt was constricting him. He struggled to breathe, pulling at his shirt only to find that it was tighter on him.<br />
<br />
Axel stood up off the couch leaving the remainder of his hair on the headrest. He looked flush and green as he peeled his shirt off, revealing a muscular chest that he didn't have before. <br />
<br />
The sound of cotton ripping came from over by Jake. He was still hunched over and looking straight ahead but his back was arched unnaturally and swelling. He clawed at the floor as his muscles twitched and tensed.<br />
<br />
Zack groaned in discomfort. &quot;Ugggh, my feet!&quot;<br />
<br />
His shoes had two large bulges in them. The rubber and synthetic fibers of his basketball shoes creaked urgently and then burst open, revealing two huge green toes.<br />
<br />
Zack sat up and looked down at his freakish feet over his now bulbous muzzle. &quot;What the-- fuck?&quot; He then threw his head back, arched his hips and slid his sweatpants down, revealing a thick lime green cock, which he began jerking.<br />
<br />
Pablo went to express his disgust when his legs suddenly spasmed, sending him to the ground on his chest. He felt a tightness and a weight on his back. He looked up and saw Jake, still prostrate but with a big turtle shell on his back! Jake's jeans had split and what was obviously a small reptilian tail was wiggling underneath his underwear.<br />
<br />
Pablo knew the same thing was happening to him. He looked down at his hands, which were puffing up. He held one up to his swelling face as his five fingers became three thick ones. He quickly kicked off his shoes as he felt the same thing happening to his feet.<br />
<br />
Axel felt his chest thicken and harden. He felt his smooth, tough plate-like abs and gazed out over his changing friends. His brother, now bald like him and with a big shell on a very muscular and green body, cried out as his face pushed out into a round muzzle. He peeled his pants and underwear off, noticing that his legs were unusually thick.<br />
<br />
Axel turned to face the wall and felt the urge to squat. His glutes firmed up and a tail pushed out of his back. He clawed at the wall as his shell began growing in.<br />
<br />
Zack was completely lost in ecstasy. He heard his buds groaning around him but he didn't care. He flipped over on the couch and continued pumping away at his dick. His stomach felt tight as it hardened and he arched his back as his shell began to form. This was his secret dream, coming true. He never wanted to admit it to anyone, but he'd always been into the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and now he was.. oh god, yes, he was becoming one of them!<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, oh man.. oh god.. I'm going to ... AAAAAHHHH!&quot;<br />
<br />
He let loose all over Axel's couch.<br />
<br />
Pablo completely burst out of his clothes, shouting at the sudden relief in pressure. He felt his penis harden as that changed too, his blush hidden by his greening skin.<br />
<br />
Jake was resting on his shell, feet planted on the floor as he gripped his still red cock. He pumped his hips upward into his hands, rocking back and forth on his shell as his member turned green.<br />
<br />
Finally he splattered all over his hard, yellow chest.<br />
 <br />
Jake sat dazed for a moment, then walked into the bathroom to wash up and check out a mirror.<br />
<br />
He walked back out and said, &quot;Guys. We're turtles!&quot;<br />
<br />
Pablo was shooting his load out onto his hand, as if terrified to get his mess on the floor. Then, as one, the other three looked back at Jake with a blank stare. Zack's cock twitched and let out another burble of cum.<br />
<br />
Pablo stood up and wiped his hands off with a napkin, which he dropped into a wastebasket in disgust.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let us never speak of this again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know, I could stand to do it again,&quot; quipped Zack.<br />
<br />
Axel scrunched up his green face and shouted. &quot;What the hell did you do to my couch you freak?! You'd better clean that up!&quot;<br />
<br />
Zack held his hands up and shrugged unapologetically. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, now what?&quot; asks Pablo.</p>
