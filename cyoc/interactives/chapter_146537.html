<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You wake up the next morning to the beautiful sound of the gak! gak! gak! of your cock buried deep in the throat of your utterly submissive Japanese maidslave Steffie. Your eyes open to the sight of the gorgeous girl between your legs, furiously fucking her own face on your morning wood, her slanted hazel-colored eyes focused intently on yours as she seeks to optimize your pleasure. She extends her tongue to give your balls a tongue bath as she continues to deepthroat you. You stretch out a bit and see the cup of hot coffee and plate of bacon and eggs on your bedside table.<br />
<br />
You eat your breakfast in bed as your slutty little maid continues her oral assault on your genitals. After finishing your meal, you put the plate aside and grab Steffie by the hair. You pull her mouth off your cock, flip her onto her back, mount her, and plunge your hardness deep into her pussy for the first time.<br />
<br />
You feel a bit of resistance and then she squeals loudly in pain and pleasure as you take your slave&#39;s virginity.<br />
<br />
The realization that you are the only man who will ever fuck this perfect creature is enough to push you over the edge and you fill your former roommate&#39;s freshly-minted pussy with its very first load of cum.<br />
<br />
&quot;There you go, ya Jap slut,&quot; you tell Steffie as you finish pumping your jism inside her. &quot;Now clean this shit up,&quot; you say, gesturing to your plate and coffee cup. &quot;I gotta take a shower.&quot;<br />
<br />
You roll off her and head to your new bathroom.<br />
<br />
About twenty minutes later, you&#39;re getting out of the shower, and you see Steffie standing in the middle of your bedroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Steffie?&quot;<br />
<br />
She steps forward and reveals that she&#39;s holding the gun. Before you can compute what&#39;s happening, she points it at you and fires.<br />
<br />
You&#39;re engulfed in a flash of light.<br />
<br />
A moment later, your vision returns and you spin back toward the bathroom mirror to take stock of what changes Steffie made to you.<br />
<br />
To your surprise... you look like you. Actually... not quite. It looks like your hair is a little thicker. And maybe you&#39;re a few inches taller than you were. And you&#39;ve definitely lost a little fat off your belly. And you&#39;ve got muscles on your arms! And chest! Holy shit... you&#39;ve got abs! You smile in the mirror, and you notice that your teeth are absolutely perfect. Looking down, you see that your penis is even bigger than it was before. And then you realize: you&#39;re not wearing your contact lenses--she even fixed your vision.<br />
<br />
Your ex-roommate-turned-slavegirl got a hold of the only thing in the Universe that could have given her her old life back and used it to instead make you into the perfect man, so you could fuck her even better. What a fucking idiot.<br />
<br />
You go to take the gun from Steffie, but like every time it had been fired before, it was nowhere to be found.<br />
<br />
&quot;Steffie! That gun is not a toy, and it belongs to me. If you use that gun again without my express permission, I&#39;m going to put you in a fucking shipping crate and send you to Japan. Do you understand me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Master. I underostand. I am very sorry. Please do not get rid of me,&quot; Steffie says, starting to tear up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well,&quot; you say. &quot;But I expect to find something really special for dinner tonight when I get home.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her eyes light up at the chance to prove her love and devotion to you with an elaborate dinner and she bows and scurries out of your bedroom.<br />
<br />
You get dressed, noting that all the clothes in your closet are much nicer than you remember them, and they even fit well across your new taller, more athletic frame.<br />
<br />
You grab your keys from the hook and head downstairs. As you&#39;re passing Miss Brooks&#39;s apartment, she opens the door to reveal herself wearing a black lingerie set that hugs her curves and pushes her tits up into an expanse of cleavage that you consider diving into. She drapes herself against the doorframe, her dazzling green eyes peeking out from behind her long red hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning, Mister Mark from 3B. Can I offer you... anything? Maybe a nice, hot, cup of coffee?&quot; The words drip out of her painted red mouth like honey, and images of you fucking her in every conceivable position flash through your mind. You fucking her missionary position, doggystyle, in her asshole, deep in her throat, between her tits, bent over the table, holding her upside down and fucking her mouth while you eat her pussy... etc.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning, Miss Brooks. Not this morning, sorry,&quot; you say, even as your growing erection begs you to reconsider.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop by anytime, Mark. I&#39;ll keep the pot warm for you,&quot; she says as she devours your improved physique with her hungry eyes.<br />
<br />
You get outside and walk to your parking space, but your car isn&#39;t there. Instead a factory-new Tesla is sitting in its place.<br />
<br />
What the fuck? Did my car get towed? What asshole parked this brand new Tesla in my spot? Fuck this guy, I&#39;m going to key his car!<br />
<br />
You start to get your keys ready to scratch a giant FUCK YOU into the paint of the Tesla, when you accidentally hit the &#39;Unlock&#39; button on your key fob. The new car chirps and flashes the headlights and unlocks.<br />
<br />
What the...? I guess Steffie&#39;s changes to me got me a better car too? Sweet!<br />
<br />
You slide into the driver&#39;s seat and start the car. Oh wow... This car is pretty dope, you think as you drive to work.<br />
<br />
After a particularly effortless commute, you arrive to work about twenty minutes early. Might as well head inside and grab a cup of coffee before I need to clock in.<br />
<br />
You walk into the building and head straight to the break room. A few minutes later, you walk back through the office to your crappy cubicle, and you find that someone else has covered your desk with pictures and memorabilia from the local college football team.<br />
<br />
Oh shit. This is someone else&#39;s desk now. Work changed too. Dammit, Steffie! How am I supposed to figure out where I sit? I can&#39;t be fucking late to work again, Mr. Daniels said he&#39;d fucking fire me if I was late again!<br />
<br />
&quot;Mark?&quot; came a voice from behind you. Wheeling around, you see Veronica, Mr. Daniels&#39;s executive secretary. You&#39;ve always thought she was kind of cute, in a tomboyish sort of way. Her short brown hair frames her face perfectly, and her conservative pantsuit hides what you&#39;ve often imagined to be a pretty great figure. You were simultaneously disappointed and aroused when you learned she was a lesbian.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Veronica. Good morning. What&#39;s up?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have the numbers you asked for on Friday. Do you want to go over them in your office?&quot; she asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. You know what, let&#39;s do that. Let&#39;s go over them in my office... Ladies first.&quot; you bluff. I guess I&#39;m not stuck in a cube anymore.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great.&quot; Veronica turns and leads you through row after row of cubicles until she opens the door to Mr. Daniels&#39;s office and walks inside. You pause for a second outside the door, and spot your name on the nameplate where Daniels used to be.<br />
<br />
Fuck me. I&#39;m Vice President?<br />
<br />
&quot;Mark?&quot; Veronica asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, hey,&quot; you say, as you spot the wall clock. &quot;I just realized. It&#39;s still ten to nine. Why don&#39;t you go grab some coffee or whatever and come back in ten minutes and we can get started?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing, boss,&quot; says Veronica, and she exits your office, drops a few things on her desk directly outside your door, and disappears down the hall.<br />
<br />
You step in and examine your new corner office.<br />
<br />
Holy shit.<br />
<br />
You cross the room and drop into the fine leather chair behind the mahogany desk. Spinning around, you look out the window overlooking the park. Not bad. Then, suddenly, something about the right-hand desk drawer catches your attention. Not a noise. Did it move? Something imperceptible happened, and somehow you detected it. You eyeball the suspect drawer for a moment, and then pull it open. The gun has returned to you.<br />
<br />
As your hand closes around the handle, you start to think about Veronica and how she could be a better secretary.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Mark! You ready to start?&quot; Veronica says a few moments later, peeking around the doorframe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure. Come on in,&quot; you say, and then waiting until she got a few steps from the door: &quot;Oh, would you mind closing the door? I don&#39;t want anyone barging in.&quot;<br />
<br />
Before the words are out of your mouth, Veronica has her back to you, walking back to close the door.<br />
<br />
You aim, breathe, and pull the trigger.</p>
