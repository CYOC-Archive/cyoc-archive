<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Steven was a bit surprised to wake up and Donovan not be there. He didn&#39;t think someone that big would be able to move around without waking him up. Yet, Steven still felt a bit tired from the night before. Not to mention the middle pain in his ass. He rubbed the sensitive spot, which only seemed to wake him up even more. &quot;Easy there...&quot; he muttered as he rubbed at his crotch as well. <br />
<br />
It felt good, but he needed to figure out what exactly was going on. A note on the nightstand at least gave him an idea. &#39;Last night was fun but you looked so cute sleeping I didn&#39;t want to wake you. Donovan.&#39; He&#39;d even drawn a little heart next to his name<br />
<br />
The sweetness in the message forced a smile on Steven&#39;s face. He couldn&#39;t believe a guy like Donovan could be so sappy. Yet, even more surprisingly, he liked it. Moreover, his hand had sped up slightly. &quot;Stop it,&quot; he scolded himself. It took a bit of effort to remove it. But it still happened. However, looking down at himself, he couldn&#39;t help but feel a bit off. &quot;Right...&quot; he muttered as he looked over his changed body. Thick, defined muscles seemed to cover every inch of him. Looking down he could even see his chest pushing out in front of him.<br />
<br />
Curiosity got the better of him and he got up to check himself out even more. &quot;Damn...&quot; Steven muttered in disbelief. He&#39;d been working out for almost a decade, yet didn&#39;t even come close to this. He flexed his arm watching the baseball sized bicep harden and round out. He moved on to flexing his tricep. A perfect horseshoe shape filled the back of his arm. Even as he moved he watched as his heavier chest moved with him. Thick shoulders gave him a more imposing frame while a thin waist made him look overly athletic. Not to mention the definition of the six pack running down his waist. Something that had always seemed to be just out of reach was now so prominent that he didn&#39;t have to flex to see each individual muscle.  The same was true of his quads. Somehow just standing there, the four muscles almost looked flexed. <br />
<br />
&quot;How the fuck is this me?&quot; Steven wondered as his hand ran down the side of his body and around his firm ass. Something about the night prior shot through his mind and he nearly toppled over, just barely catching himself on the dresser. A deep sensual moan escaped his mouth as he gripped the wood as tightly as he could. &quot;More daddy,&quot; he cried out. <br />
<br />
It took a second before Steven realized what just happened. His eyes had been squeezed shut while his ass clenched tightly. Yet, his dick throbbed with eager excitement. &quot;Shit...&quot; he cursed. The pulsing wouldn&#39;t go down. And touching it only seemed to make it even worse. However, even in his throws of ecstasy, Steven noticed, &quot;Am I smaller??&quot; He turned to the side. His cock was normally about 5 and half inches, but with how turned on he was it should have been closer to 6. Yet, right now it didn&#39;t look bigger. <br />
<br />
He quickly tried to find a ruler. There obviously wasn&#39;t one in the bedroom. Living room and dining room seemed stupid to look into. So his next stop was the kitchen. Finding the junk drawer was perfect. All kinds of stuff was in there. And when he found the ruler he dropped his underwear to be able to see. It barely came up to 5 inches. &quot;Wha--&quot; Steven muttered. &quot;This can&#39;t be happening...&quot; A half an inch smaller. That was like one of his bad days.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know. Right?&quot; someone else said. Steven quickly looked up to see someone in his early twenties staring at him while eating some breakfast. &quot;I&#39;m Jack... By the way.&quot; A sly smile was planted on his face as he watched Steven measure his cock.<br />
<br />
Steven quickly pulled his underwear back up. &quot;Uhh... Steven,&quot; he answered. &quot;My name&#39;s Steven.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Steven. Are you my dad&#39;s new boyfriend?&quot; Jack asked. <br />
<br />
The awkward nature of the of the conversation made it all the more confusing. But maybe the direct approach was best. &quot;I think?&quot; Steven said. &quot;I don&#39;t know if we&#39;ve put a label on it yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool... Cool...&quot; Jack nodded. &quot;You seem like his type.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh... Thanks,&quot; Steven answered. He slowly pulled his underwear back over his dick. The stain was only growing larger. &quot;I&#39;m going to go get changed...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t do it for my sake,&quot; Jack smiled.<br />
<br />
Steven smiled back. His ass tingled even more. Jack was nearly have his size, yet a thought of that little man&#39;s hand on the back of his neck while he bit into the pillow flooded his mind. &quot;Shit!&quot; Steven cursed as he shut the door behind him. How could he be this horny? It was barely even 9am and he&#39;d been thinking about nothing but sex. Sex that he&#39;d had almost 12 hours prior. Yet, his body craved more. &quot;Get a hold of yourself man... Just try to think about anything else.&quot;<br />
<br />
As he tried to clear his mind, a loud grumble came from his stomach. The distinct taste of chocolate and peanut butter filled his mind. &quot;No way...&quot; he muttered as he saw an unopened protein bar on the nightstand. His stomach grumbled again, crying out for the bar. Yet, he was moving closer. Slowly walking across the room, telling himself, &#39;this was a bad idea. This is what started it all.&#39; His body reached down for the bar. Opened it. The smell filled his nose. His stomach cried out even louder. And he took a bite.<br />
<br />
It tasted so good. Exactly what his stomach needed. Before he knew it, the bar was gone. &quot;Uh-oh...&quot; he uttered. It was already too late. Steven could feel the transformation happening again. His heart rate had picked up. Blood was pumping to his muscles. The veins in his arms bulged out. And then he was growing. Pound after pound of muscle added to his frame. He could feel his shoulders broadening. His athletic looking arms only bulked up with even more power. His chest pushed further out in front of him, while his ass went further behind. <br />
<br />
Flexing almost felt natural. With each surge of power, Steven flexed a bit more. He could feel his muscles growing. The callouses on his hands only seemed to grow harder and thicken. &quot;Oh fuck yeah!&quot; he bellowed as he flexed his entire body. The excitement got to him and he couldn&#39;t control himself anymore. The stain on his underwear only grew bigger while it&#39;s contents grew smaller. <br />
<br />
Steven grabbed the dresser for support. &quot;Damn...&quot; his breathing was hard and haggard. Adrenaline and endorphins filled his brain as he came down from the high. It felt so good. &quot;I need to see how much I weigh...&quot; he rushed to the bathroom and found a scale. Stepping on it, he found it hard to see the numbers over his chest. &#39;218,&#39; the scale read. &quot;Hol--ly fuck,&quot; he raised his arms to flex them. They were absolutely massive compared to what they had been. At least 18 inches around and filled to the brim with hard defined muscle. <br />
<br />
&quot;So big,&quot; he grinned as he kept flexing. The excitement went all the way down to his dick. However, when looking down at it, it looked like it&#39;d lost almost another half inch. &quot;Fu-uck,&quot; he winced. Realizing it was smaller seemed to turn it on even more. Or maybe it was comparing it to Daddy&#39;s dick. &#39;Donovan,&#39; Steven corrected himself. &#39;Comparing it to Donovan&#39;s dick.&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;I need to get out of here,&quot; he rushed to his bag and grabbed a sleeveless shirt and some black fabric shorts and slid them on. Then paused. &quot;This isn&#39;t what I packed...&quot; Steven had never really thought about sleeveless shirts as he&#39;d not had too much to show off. But right now, he could see the light glisten of sweat off his arms and gave them a flex. &quot;Shit! I need to leave. Now!&quot; he ordered himself out of the house, making sure to leave the protein bars where they had been. He quickly drove back to his apartment and sat down on the couch. <br />
<br />
Most of it was the same. Just more workout clothes and some heavier weights by the door. Otherwise, not much different. But then he heard a knock on the door. He went over to answer it but whoever it was had already left. However, on his doorstep was another box of the protein bars.</p>
