<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Cody put on the baggiest shorts he could find. Boredom had taken over whatever care he might have had towards staying home and indoors. Why should he have to be confined? It&#39;s not like he was a criminal or anything. Besides, the way the news was talking, this was going to be a seasonal thing and everyone was eventually going to get it.<br />
<br />
After grabbing a duffle bag with his charger, a few changes of clothes and some other amenities, he jumped out of his window. With a soft thud into the grass, he looked back inside. &quot;I ain&#39;t a sheep,&quot; he smirked as he looked down at his thick horse legs. Then he started running. A freeing feeling filled him as he started off with a light trot, that quickly turned into a full on sprint.<br />
<br />
With so many people afraid of contracting the Transfo-flu, he basically had full free reign of the sidewalks and roads. The more he ran, the faster he moved his legs. A confidence filled him as he felt the sheer power that had built up inside of them. Each step felt lighter than the last. His large muscular body was easily carried at speeds he hadn&#39;t ever gone by foot before. <br />
<br />
That&#39;s when he heard the loud &#39;WOooooo...&#39; of a police car behind him. &quot;Shit...&quot; Cody cursed as he slowed his sprint. The cop pulled his car next to him as he stopped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me!&quot; The officer called out through a barely cracked window. He pulled a mask up over his face. Even though it&#39;d been long since proven the uselessness of said mask, many people enjoyed the faux sense of safety that it brought. &quot;What do you think you&#39;re doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just going for a run to the Hills,&quot; Cody shrugged. The thrill of his jog was still in him. He could feel his heart pounding in his chest and it made him feel alive. Just like he&#39;d always had with a tough workout, a confidence filled him. He approached the police officer&#39;s car window. &quot;Is that a problem?&quot;<br />
<br />
The police officer jumped to close the window. He scrambled with the button. The small crack in the window closed. Then realized he&#39;d have to shout. &quot;IT IS WHEN YOU&#39;VE CONTRACTED THE FLU!&quot; Cody pretended to not be able to hear the officer. He twirled his finger around his ear, both mocking and signaling it to the officer. The officer&#39;s face went red as he opened the window ever so slightly. &quot;You know what you&#39;re doing!&quot; he exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Going for a run?&quot; Cody still pretended not to understand. &quot;Is that illegal now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you trying to toy with me? Do I need to arrest you?&quot; the officer was trying to act tough now.<br />
<br />
Cody placed his hands flat on top of the car and spread his legs. &quot;If you feel that&#39;s necessary,&quot; adding a laugh. Peering inside the window, he could clearly tell how nervous this officer was. He was practically shaking even from this distance. Of course he bought into the six feet rule as well. Cody knew that the officer had no power here.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why are you making this so difficult?&quot; the officer demanded. &quot;Just go home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ehh... Nah...&quot; Cody stood back up. He felt his dick awaken at this weird power he had. Just watching the officer squirm under even the slightest bit of pushback made him smirk. &quot;Not unless you make me...&quot; he challenged. Then added a pouty kiss. Cody didn&#39;t exactly flirt with guys, but right now he was getting all horned up again.<br />
<br />
The officer took him up on the offer. He grabbed his gloves that were supposed to protect him from the flu. Then he grabbed his cuffs. &quot;Alright. Fine,&quot; he demanded. With a slam of the door, he stomped around his vehicle only to regret what he was about to do. His face lifted up several inches to look the other man in the face. More curious was that even over the last few minutes, he could swear that Cody had wider nostrils. It almost looked like his face was pushing more out into a snout. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hands on the vehicle!&quot; the officer demanded.<br />
<br />
Cody did as he said, but with a taunting smirk. &quot;Ooo... So strong,&quot; he mocked.<br />
<br />
The officer blushed. His mask hid most of it. However, his strong grip softened. A strange smell was seeping through. It was making it hard for him to think. He licked his lips and bit down on the bottom one. &#39;Focus,&#39; he commanded himself as he started to pat down Cody. His hands gently padded against the hard muscles of the college aged guy. &quot;Do you have any weapons on you?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Only these two guns,&quot; Cody laughed as he held up his massive arms. Flexing them, they looked to be at least 17 inches if not 18. The thick biceps had a massive vein bulging out of it.<br />
<br />
The officer did his best to ignore it. However, the sexual haze was really starting to take over. He didn&#39;t even realize his hand had gone down to the other man&#39;s dick. He stroked the hard member a few times. &quot;And what&#39;s this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s my penis,&quot; Cody laughed. &quot;You can keep going...&quot; the sultry sound of his voice sent a shiver down the officer&#39;s spine.<br />
<br />
It took the officer several more strokes before he realized what Cody had just said. &quot;EEEEH!?&quot; He pulled back only to notice some pre on the gloves. &quot;YOU FUCKER! YOU&#39;RE UNDER ARREST!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah,&quot; Cody laughed. He was done playing. It wasn&#39;t fun anymore if he was actually going to jail. With a shove, he freed himself from the officer&#39;s grasp and started running down the street as fast as he could to get to the Hills. <br />
<br />
The officer dove into his car. He grabbed the radio. &quot;I&#39;ve got a runner,&quot; he declared. &quot;A Transfo-Flu horseman running down Maple and heading towards Venture. Over.&quot; It took him a moment before he removed the gloves. &quot;Shit...&quot; he cursed as he put them into a bag.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you get anything on you? Over,&quot; the radio crackled back to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; the officer said. &quot;I made sure to be careful. Over.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sending an officer over now,&quot; the radio replied. &quot;Over.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you. Over,&quot; the officer grabbed his radio again and set it down. He hopped back into his driver seat and started after Cody. The horseman was surprisingly fast. That&#39;s when he saw Cody start hopping fences. &quot;Damn it!&quot; he shouted. Before he realized it, Cody was gone. &quot;Fuck...&quot; he cursed again. A small itch started to form around his ear. <br />
<br />
The officer scratched it without realizing that the tips of his ears were starting to grow into points. The flu had started to spread.</p>
