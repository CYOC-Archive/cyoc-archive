<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Yes I am Alejandro…do I know you?” asked Alejandro as he turned and looked at Lupe. “Do I know you?”<br />
He paused for a moment and looked her up and down, which caused a slight blush to come to Lupe’s face. He focused on Lupe’s golden tail, that was rare enough among merpeople but the Aztec dragon formed in red scales on her side which made her very special. <br />
“Ah…I ran into you earlier today, you must be a former human, that tail doesn’t come naturally.” Said Alejandro with a chuckle as he ordered his drink. “I was a human myself…going on 10 years now.”<br />
For a while she did not say anything, it wasn’t until Alejandro’s drink arrived that she spoke up.<br />
“Yes…I have only been a mermaid for two days.” admitted Lupe as she wondered how to say this. “My name is Lupe.”<br />
“Lupe.” said Alejandro with a chuckle. “I actually knew a girl in middle school on the surface named that, she was a strange one…she believed in merfolk…kind of wish I could tell her she was right.”<br />
“You just did.” confirmed Lupe as Alejandro almost dropped his drink and he turned and looked at her. “I thought it was you when I ran into you earlier.”<br />
“Wow…what a strange world.” Said Alejandro with a chuckle. “So what is your story?” <br />
Adrian was never a person for night/dance clubs and now that he was a merman he found he still wasn’t one. He stood rather floated near one of the small tables which surrounded the large dance floor, well maybe dance was the wrong word. Mermaids and Merman moved their tail backwards and forwards, side to side like humans would on the dance floor. <br />
However the scene on the dance floor looked like a board line sex party, last he had seen Colton he was being swarmed by Mermaids who were doing things that would have gotten all of them kicked out of most night clubs. Harmony seemed to be hugging the walls more than he was and Lupe had headed toward the bar and was now talking to a merman about the same age.<br />
“Is something wrong?” inquired Cura as she looked at him.<br />
“It’s just…” started Adrian as suddenly a mermaid swam up behind him and gave him a kiss on the cheek before swimming off. Adrian just stopped mid-sentence as Cura laughed, he did like her laugh. <br />
“Sorry…I was never much into stuff like this.” admitted Adrian as he regained himself “And this…well this is beyond what I expected…I half expect people to start having sex on the dance floor.”<br />
“On the floor…no.” said Cura as a sever came by and she ordered a drink and Adrian did the same. “There are cubes in the back for that.”<br />
Adrian’s eyes widened as the drinks arrived from the bar and Adrian paid, they had stopped at something a kin to an ATM before they came. <br />
“You must be joking?” inquired Adrian<br />
“No…remember we have a shrinking population and a more open sexual society.” stated Cura as she looked toward a door on the far side of the dance floor. Someone a mermaid was pulling a merman into the backroom where if he was right the back wall was covered with what looked to be a honeycomb like structure where he thought he saw mermaids and merman having sex. <br />
“So this is a sex club?” inquired Adrian as Cura drank from her red drink, it looked like a strawberry milkshake but he knew all their drinks looked like that. They were denser than water which was why they didn’t float away.<br />
“In a way…all night clubs are like this.” Explained Cura “They have stuff like that everywhere, they are open to the public. Like I said the government really wants to increase the population. They have more of them here because this is where people go to party and get drunk.”<br />
“I see.” Said Adrian as he looked around again Colton was the center of attention for three or four mermaids, Harmony was still hugging the wall and Lupe, she looked surprise but was now talking with a merman at the bar. <br />
“Personally I never found the public beds comfortable…too tight and not enough room in my view to have real fun.” Admitted Cura as Adrian eyes widened and he looked at her. “What?”<br />
“Most women…well human women wouldn’t admit they have slept around.” Stated Adrian<br />
“I am a mermaid, we are much more forward and upfront.” Countered Cura as she swam a little closer and ran one of her hands down his chest before moving to his hip. “Besides…I am sure you are not a inexperienced in the bedroom.”<br />
Adrian did not know what to do, on a battlefield he knew what to do, where to move and how to react here he was out of his league. Still he could not lie to this beautiful mermaid before him.<br />
“Well…as a human no…as a merman yes.” answered Adrian his face flushed.<br />
“Well…how about I teach you tonight.” stated Cura with a playful smile as she looked around. “I would say now but I have to look after you all.”<br />
But…I am a hunter you are…” started Adrian as Cura gave him a look.<br />
“Who bloody cares about that.” countered Cura with a smile, a smile which Adrian returned, he finished his drink and turned and looked at Cura.<br />
“Well how about a dance?” inquired Adrian, she downed her drink and took his hand and headed out toward the dance floor.</p>
