<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Coral decided to use pretty basic settings, but she made sure they weren&#39;t instant and nobody but her could notice so she can test it out all she wants.<br />
<br />
AWARENESS: User Only<br />
TIME LIMIT: Until Manually Reverted<br />
LENGTH OF CHANGE: 10 seconds<br />
PAIN - PLEASURE SCALE: 5-N/A No Feeling<br />
<br />
At first she thought about changing herself, but decided it might be too dangerous to be the only one knowing what&#39;s up, with no chance of anybody else helping her afterwards. So she thought about her brother who was teasing her a lot of times, but looking at her mother and her good friend Jessica, she thought that since she&#39;s here right now she might do something good for her.<br />
<br />
Jessica was only slightly younger than Katherine, but had a completely different body type. While their mother was surprisingly fit with relatively little curves, Jessica had all the curves, even the ones that made her a bit chubby. Nothing too extreme, but she had a good amount of buffer around her waist. And being almost half a foot shorter than Katherine, she looked kind of small comparatively.<br />
<br />
So she decided to change her up a little by taking what&#39;s been described without going too deep into the settings. Specifically, she changed two things about Jessica:<br />
<br />
curvy build -----> very athletic build<br />
5&#39;5&quot; -----> 6&#39;2&quot;<br />
<br />
A prompt popped up, asking if proportions like weight and such should automatically adjust to the input changes. Coral pressed yes and continued with the transformation.<br />
<br />
While Coral was already 10, she didn&#39;t think all too much about what such a big &quot;gift&quot; might do to a friendship, or at least the person feeling insecure in their own body next to them. While Jessica was never bothered being &quot;smaller&quot; or &quot;saggy&quot;, quite the opposite actually, Katherine always liked the way she looked in comparison to others. She never made a huge deal about it, but secretly she loved it.<br />
<br />
As the changes began, Jessica&#39;s fat melted away as her muscles got definition. The taller she got, the more her clothes seemed to change. What once was a good-looking, loose red summer dress was slowly turning into a red crop top that was criss-crossing around her waist, accentuating her still-growing abs. All the while the other part of the dress changed color and transformed into a pair of very tight jeans, feeling skin-tight around her round ass...<br />
<br />
Speaking of which, the device only added the very athletic build to her already curvy figure and changed what needed to be changed like her chubby belly. So her comparably big breasts and ass were saved from the transformation, leaving her with an all-natural body most models would kill for.<br />
<br />
Jessica looked amazing. Both Coral and Adam were keeping a tight look at her. No one could blame Adam, since at his age pretty much everything slightly sexual can hold his attention for what feels like hours. Coral on the other hand just thought she looked very, very pretty and didn&#39;t notice her mother still smiling, but somehow feeling off. Not being the most athletic (and certainly not most well-endowed) woman around anymore bothered something deep inside her despite Jessica being a good friend to her that never said anything bad about her to this day.<br />
<br />
Thinking about how great everything turned out, Coral wanted to push the envelope a bit more. Maybe much more to see the extent of the magic device. So she went straight back to the settings, unknowingly ignoring how her mother was feeling.<br />
<br />
very athletic build -----> extremely athletic build<br />
6&#39;2&quot; -----> 7&#39;6&quot;<br />
<br />
Now that she changed the original settings again, she looked around some more and found the option to add specific keywords to favor the transformation towards...<br />
<br />
very athletic build -----> extremely athletic build<br />
6&#39;2&quot; -----> 7&#39;6&quot;<br />
Favor -----> waist: snatched -;- muscles: strength>size -;-  breasts: perky<br />
<br />
With more than enough changes on the way, Coral hit accept and watched them unfold.<br />
<br />
Even faster and more impressive than before, the once slightly taller Jessica skyrocketed far above Katherine, leaving her at eye-level with her breasts. Those same breasts didn&#39;t need a bra anymore since the strength behind them and their natural perkiness were more than enough to hold them aloft.<br />
<br />
Her ass ballooned out to a fullblown assshelf, a mixture of hard muscle and soft fat to achieve perfection. Her already small waist got tiny as it looked like both sides were being pressed inwards by a corset. It clenched her now even more defined 8-pack of silky-smooth-looking, but steel hard abs.<br />
<br />
Overall, the muscles across her body were stunning to look at. They looked big, but only to the point they reached peak femininity. After raeching that point, everyone that knew her could&#39;ve sworn that those same muscles just kept storing strength, getting denser and denser in the process. And they&#39;d be right. Jessica might look like some high-end fitness influencer, but in reality she should have a body that could rival the biggest crossfit woman. Instead, all that size was compressed into her far smaller, but much stronger muscles.<br />
<br />
Her red criss-cross crop top changed to an even more revealing version that left her midriff fully bare and was extremely close to showing some underboob. On top of that, instead of covering everything above that, it now only had a thick band wrapping around her neck, releaving even more cleavage than necessary. Her jeans shortened a lot to hot pants that really shouldn&#39;t be worn by any regular 35 year-old, but in this case it almost felt like a must-have.<br />
<br />
Coral thought her test turned out more than perfect, being happy everything worked both the first and second time she&#39;s used the device. Adam on the other hand couldn&#39;t believe his good fortune that Jessica of all women was eating here today and sitting at their table. He was so glad that Katherine was a good friend of hers, so he could drool all over this perfect-looking woman.<br />
<br />
Katherine, while liking Jessica as much as before, felt nonexistent next to her. Everybody, no matter if man or woman, kept looking at her even thought she had an impressive body herself. But who could she judge when an amazonian powerhouse with incredible curves walked right beside her? While she did have the perfect body, Katherine was more than glad that Jessica wasn&#39;t a supermodel in terms of facial features or a literal genius, at least not yet...</p>
