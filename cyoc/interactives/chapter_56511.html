<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Right after Jay, Jacopo, left the room, Tod got up and walked over to the computer.  He had found a clip online he wanted to show his friend, but as soon as the monitor came back on what he saw shocked him.  The nude model of him and a full list of his stats.  &quot;What the hell is this?&quot;  He laughed a little at how accurate the model was.  Right down to his cock, which Jay had only seen a few times in the gym locker rooms, and once or twice when they jerked off together to porn.  But he didn't think Jay knew it that well.<br />
<br />
Tod, as far as the memories he had, had always had a bit of a crush on Jacopo.  He liked women, but he also liked men, well men like Jacopo anyway.  He soon saw the other three windows open.  Jacopo himself, and disturbingly his parents.  Tod minimized those so he wouldn't have to see that, it was a little sick.  But the thing fascinated him.  That's when he noticed the stats could be edited.  Changing the model.  One thing he had always been jealous of was Jacopo's hairiness.  Tod himself barely had any, but Jacopo was a veritable gorilla.  Maybe he didn't want quite that much, but certainly more wouldn't have gone amiss.  But he didn't see the stat on the list.  He dug into the miscellaneous options, and found it under there.<br />
<br />

Misc Options:-<br />
--Body Hair Scale(1-10): 9<br />
<br />
Tod scratched his chin, so if that was Jacopo's, he wondered about the one his own model had, so he dropped down and found the option.<br />
<br />
Name: Tod William Erikson<br />
Age: 18<br />
Gender: Male<br />
Species: Human<br />
Race: Caucasian<br />
--Ethnicity: 50% German, 50% Swedish<br />
--Nationality: American<br />
Height: 6'<br />
Weight: 175<br />
Build: Lean/Athletic<br />
Occupation: College Student/Retail Clerk<br />
Misc Options:-<br />
--Body Hair Scale(1-10):2<br />
<br />
Yeah, that seemed right.  And the fact that his body hair was blond made it even harder to notice.  He had very little arm and leg hair, and basically a non-existant treasure trail.  His chest was perfectly smooth, and he didn't even need to shave daily.  Any attempt at growing facial hair would have been ridiculous.  He wanted to see what his model would look like with more hair, so he turned up the number, replacing the 2 with a 7.  And then he hit the submit button.<br />
<br />
At first his eyes were on the model, watching the hair on the arms and legs thicken.  Just watching it made his own limbs itch.  Then the pubes started getting thicker, and moved slowly up the stomach towards between his model's abs.  He wasn't imagining the itching, it really was happening.  He lifted up his shirt to see the blond hairs curling from the shallow valley between his abs.  He tore off his shirt and jacket and threw them aside to get a better look.<br />
<br />
Now that he saw his arms as well, they were covered with dense blond hair, some along the back of his hands, and growing a bit up his upper arms but stopping well short of his shoulders.  He even had thicker under arm hair.<br />
<br />
The treasure trail was still growing upwards, and getting wider too.  A thick strip of blond hair growing up his stomach.  When it finally reached between his pecs it began to spread out, dusting most of his chest with curly blond hair.  He felt an itch along his cheeks and jaw, he reached up to feel stubble grown in on his cheeks in pretty much a full beard.  This was insane.  He ran his fingers through his chest hair, even tugging on it experimentally, wincing as he pulled one or two out by mistake.  He wasn't hairy as Jacopo, not even close really, but he was certainly hairy, hairier than most.  He caught sight of the pictures on Jacopo's wall.  The ones containing him had even changed.  He saw the one of them on the beach last spring break, and sure enough he had a hairy chest in that photo too.  It seemed the program not only edited what was changed, but reality too.  He could even remember being hairy since he was fifteen.  His real memories were there too, these were just stronger.<br />
<br />
Then a thought occured to him.  He had always wanted to fool around with Jacopo, and while Tod was bisexual, Jacopo was frustratingly straight.  He pulled up his friend's profile again and looked once more through the stats.<br />
<br />
Name: Jacopo Marcus DeSantos<br />
Age: 18<br />
Gender: Male<br />
Species: Human<br />
Race: Caucasian<br />
--Ethnicity: 100% Italian<br />
--Nationality: American/Italian (Duel Nationality)<br />
Height: 6'5&quot;<br />
Weight: 230<br />
Build: Muscular<br />
Occupation: College Student/Retail Clerk<br />
Misc Options:-<br />
--Body Hair Scale(1-10): 9<br />
--Sexual Orientation: Heterosexual<br />
<br />
He checked to see what he could change it to, and was surprised at the number of options.  Heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, bicurious.. even asexual.  Tod made a note to remember about that to mess with his bitch of an ex-girlfriend.  He didn't want change Jacopo too much, but he did want to be able to fool around.  He decided to change it to bicurious and hit submit.  Nothing seemed to happen, there were some newer memories.  Remembering the way Jacopo might have looked at one guy or another.  But nothing really new in his own, and nothing different between him and his friend.<br />
<br />
That's when Jacopo walked into the room.  He looked at Tod but didn't make a comment about the new body hair.  It was if he didn't notice the change.  Maybe he didn't, perhaps only Tod who changed it had any recollection of it being different.  So he decided to gamble on the other change.  Jacopo held out the beer to him and Tod stepped closer to take it, as he did he suddenly leaned in and pressed his mouth firmly against Jacopo's.  At first his friend seemed shocked, unsure of what to do, and the pulled him into a tight hug and returned the kiss.<br />
<br />
The feeling of their hairy chests rubbing together was driving Tod crazy, and he could feel Jacopo's erection rubbing up against his own, with only his jeans and Jacopo's boxers to separate them.  Tod led Jacopo over to the bed, and pushed him back on it.  He tugged off his own pants before yanking off Jacopo's boxers.  Tod climbed on the bed and stradled his friend, his own cock hanging over his friend's mouth while he lowered his mouth onto Jacopo's large stiff cock.  He took as much into his mouth as he could, the thing was huge.  And soon he felt the moist warmth as his own cock was encircled by his friend's lips.  The sucked each other off for a while, simple lost in the moment, before Tod moved.  He positioned himself right above Jacopo's cock and lowered himself down onto it, slowly at first.  The huge cock stretched his ass painfully, and while he liked men, he had never done this before.  Though he kept lowering himself until the entire length was in him.  Then he began to ride the shaft as Jacopo began to pant from the feeling of it, gripping Tod's waist in his huge hands.  It didn't take long before Jacopo blew a full load into Tod, squirt after squirt of hot cum filling his gut, and he blew his own massive load right into Jacopo's chest and stomach hair.<br />
<br />
After they caught their breaths, Tod slid off and lay on the bed next to his friend, who suddenly spoke in his heavily accented Italian.  &quot;That was amazing.  I didn't know you liked that.  I would have done it sooner with you, I always wondered what it would be like.&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly Tod felt a flush of guilt.  &quot;I.. Well, you wouldn't have.  I.. changed you with that program of yours so you would do it with me.  I'm sorry.  I've just always wanted to.. Sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacopo scrunched his brows together.  His memories always had him slightly attracted to men in addition to women, he didn't remember it being any other way.  But when he had changed something, no one else remembered it any other way.  Why should it be different for him when someone else uses it.  But he just couldn't summon up anger against his friend for changing it, because he couldn't remember it being the way it was before.  So he just shrugged.  &quot;Whatever.  I enjoyed it, what does it matter.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tod just laughed, looking over at his friend.  &quot;Want to mess around with it some more?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacopo looked down at himself, cum matting his body hair.  &quot;I'm taking a shower first.  But you go ahead.  Just don't change me anymore without me around.&quot;  Jacopo got off the bed and stumbled into his bathroom and soon the sound of the shower running was heard.<br />
<br />
Tod moved back to the computer and stared at it.  Wondering what he could do next.</p>
