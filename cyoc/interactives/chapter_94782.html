<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Four teens Jeremy(18), Derek(18), Luke (18) and Bryson (18)<br />
<br />
Character&#39;s and some overview to get started<br />
Witch (Jonathan&quot;s gandmother)  who was run over by the teens as they did their run after school. All were rude to him except  Luke as usual.  <br />
<br />
	Jeremy- Cursed to take on the form of the deepest sexual desire of the people he talks to, since he was exercising to become more desirable. The person still talks to him as if he is himself but you can see them fighting for restrainght to the physical desire.  His clothing morphs with him and he remains in that form until he speaks to another or sleeps for an hour.  His dad is the first person he talks too over the phone. His dad desires his &quot;uncle&quot; John. John was his fathers roomate from college and his best friend. His mother he talks with next and becomes his father.  only person he is himself with is Luke. <br />
	<br />
	Derek- Cursed to become a genie for his wish for power. He is connected to a ring that is instantly teleported away. The ring gives its bearer to ability to summon Derek to them in his genie form at any time of day to grant their wish. Derek has no power in his normal form but can still feel the power of the genie within him at all times, but just has no access to it. He pops out of whatever he is doing to his master when they call and returns to that same location when released.  sometimes hours later. <br />
	<br />
	Luke- is given the gift of good fortune for being a kind soul, since the witch believes that Jeremy&#39;s curse will eventually fulfill his true desire to have Jeremy love him, which is why he was with the others in the first place.<br />
	<br />
	Bryson- is cursed to follow the others forever. His perception is split between the four of them. he sees through each of their eyes and must learn to still live his life while witnessing the others lives and events. People think he is crazy as he first must learn to witness but not react.  The narrator. <br />
	<br />
And the Story Begins:<br />
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />
	Today I will tell you the tale of how my friends and I &#39;s lives have come to be as they are. We each survive by the goodness of Luke but that is not how it all started. <br />
	<br />
	It began on spring day in 2013 when my friends and I went for a after school run as had become our norm since sophomore year. Now as seniors the habit was firmly set in place, Jeremy was leading the pack like always. He was the definition of a man&#39;s man. He is 6&#39;4&quot; at 18yrs and muscled as any could ever hope to be while being perfectly proportioned and lean. He even had chiseled features, a six pack and perfect blond hair with piercing blue eye the shade of the clearest ice. (or that is at least how Luke describes him). Derek is next in our group he is the biggest of us being 6&#39; 7&quot; (built like a body builder like the rest of his family while still being the smallest of his family at only 300lbs of pure muscle). Derek was dark haired with brown eyes of mahogany and featured shoulders wide enough that he had to turn sideways to go through a doorway. I came next in our groups pecking order. Bryson is my name and I was 6&#39;2&quot; a decently built guy. I have brown hair and green eyes that I have been told resembles an emerald.  I had a faint six pack then with a swimmers build. Luke brought up the rear as usual then.  He was the smallest of us at only 5&#39;8&quot; with just 150lbs on his small frame. He worked out with the rest of us but never seemed to gain an ounce of muscle. We picked on him for being a shrimp and at times I wondered why he still hung out with us. <br />
	<br />
	We were still on mile one when we came around a corner moving fast and knocked right into  favorite punching bag, Johnathan, along with some old woman. Both Johnathan and the woman were carrying groceries into the house.  The  groceries became scattered about the lawn.  Jeremy who directly hit the old women tumbled across the sidewalk tripping the rest of us. Derek fell into the woman&#39;s car denting the door with his thick skull.  I fell over Jeremy and landed on a container of eggs that had fallen onto the lawn. Luke managed to catch himself and began to check on the woman as well as Johnathan. <br />
	<br />
	Jeremy spatted,&quot; damn it what is wrong with you, standing in the middle of the sidewalk, can&#39;t you see people coming four eyes&quot;  directing toward Johnathan as he stands himself back up. Derek stood back up and glared at the woman for a minute. I did not say a word but stood with Jeremy and Derek glaring at the woman and Johnathan in turn. Luke had helped the women up and was beginning to gather the groceries.  The women turned to Johnathan, &quot;Do you know these nice young boys?&quot;  As she sized up each of the boys with her eyes. &quot;Yes, they are some of my classmates, grandma&quot; Johnathan said while adjusting his thick glasses that completed his nerdy features. With him standing at 5&#39; 3&quot; I had a hard time not laughing at this sad excuse for a senior standing next to his grandmother. Even his grandmother was taller. I would say she is about 5&#39;7&quot; if I had to guess.  My observations about the two were cut short by the grandmothers next question. &quot;Oh you mean those nice boys that send you home with bruises and wedgies?&quot; Johnathan nods. &quot;Are these also the boys who make inquiries into your sexual preferences?&quot; As Johnathan begins to nod again I realize that none of the rest of us has moved after she began her first question. I then try to move and realize I cannot. Time seemed to stop. We each froze in place. <br />
	<br />
	His grandmother turned to Johnathan, &quot;its so nice to finally meet them, I have such plans for them. It’s a shame you were not willing to introduce me to them before. Oh Well that’s in the past now.&quot;<br />
	<br />
	Her voice then invaded our heads. Asking questions which we can&#39;t help but answer honestly.     <br />
	<br />
	Jeremy&#39;s conversation with her [why do you run? &quot;I work out to be desirable&quot; Desirable to what end? &quot;Get girls&quot; I see. Well in that case, since you have been such a good influence on my grandson I will grant your wish. From here on out you will become the greatest desire of everyone you talk too. Some day you may learn the value of being comfortable in your own skin and hopefully what is truly desirable about a person is their character and not their appearance]     <br />
	   <br />
	Derek&#39;s conversation. [why do you run? &quot;To be bigger, and not be so weak. I see so it is power you seek. &quot;Yes!&quot; Very well I will grant you your wish for power. From this day forth you will be a genie. You will have the greatest power of the cosmos, but link all power there are limitations.  You will be bound to this ring (shows the image of a silver ring with runes on it) the wearer of this ring will be your master. You will remain in your human form until your master summons you.  When your master releases you, you will return from where you were summoned and return to this form. May you learn that power does not bring the solution to all your troubles, and that true power lays in the connections one forges with others.]<br />
	<br />
	Luke&#39;s conversation [You are kind of soul, why do you run with these fools. &quot;Jeremy&quot; Oh I see you love him. Does he know? &quot;NO!&quot; I see. I hear from my grandson that you are a good person and while I cannot make Jeremy love you I can give you a gift. I will give you the gift of good fortune and intelligence. May your kind spirit grow while you wait for your love to come out of his foolish desires. Remember to be who you are and to grow within yourself is the noblest endeavor.]<br />
	<br />
	My conversation [ Why do you run? &quot;Cause my friends do.&quot; Why do you never help Luke stop the bullying of the other two? &quot;Cause I like being part of the group and getting to hang with Derek and Jeremy&quot;  I see so you feel that Johnathan deserves what he gets? &quot;No I was just doing what they were doing. I did not wish to be left out.&quot; So you prefer to stay with the group and follow their moves. Fine by me I will grant your wish to never miss out. May you learn that you are your own person.]<br />
	<br />
	Just like that it was over she and Johnathan vanished. We all started at each other for a minute. My head started to hurt, just as Jeremy announced we should all head home and call it a day he was not feeling well.  I immediately took off at a full run I only lived around the corner to my journey did not take long.  As I made it through the door the headache got worse and I race up to my room. As I entered the room I pull the curtains shut and threw my clothing off to try to sleep off my headache. As soon as my head hit the pillow I was out. I had the weirdest dreams though. My dreams looked like a screen split for four players and within them I saw scenes that I recognized, but the perspective was different. <br />
	<br />
	As I watched the dreams play out and realized I was watching my friends return to their own homes. Screen one was Jeremy I learned as he looked at himself in a car mirror. I was looking through his eyes.  He made it home just a minute later.  He walked in the house  stripped off his cloths to get in the shower.  I got to see all 6&#39; 4&quot; of him while he stood in front of the mirror staring at himself. He even popped a boner. I had no idea he was that big. he must have been six inches soft and ten inches hard while being thick as a coke can.  He kept checking himself out like he was expecting something to change. His phone rang, which brought his attention away from himself. The caller ID showed his dad. Jeremy answered, &quot;Yeah Da?&quot; Jeremy&#39;s Dad, &quot; Your mother and I have headed up to see you grandmother we will be back Tuesday. Be sure to feed the cat and cut the grass.&quot; Jeremy rolls his eyes, &quot;yeah sure,&quot; he pauses realizing his voice sounds funny to him. Its deeper now. His dad says something else but at this point Jeremy is not listening. He begins to take stock of himself looking down he sees his stomach begin to grow as he feels bloated. Next come a feeling of falling as he loses three inches in height. After that a pricking sensation, hair is growing all over his body. Jeremy decides to look in the mirror. Staring back at him is his dad&#39;s best friend Uncle John. He is 53 and 6&#39;1&quot;  weighing in at 325lbs. Jeremy almost drops the phone.  <br />
	<br />
	&quot;oh and your mother want to say something to you as well,&quot; his dad says as Jeremy in his shocked state tunes back into his father&#39;s voice.  &quot;Hi darling,&quot; she says. &quot;Hi ma,&quot; Jeremy replies in his uncles voice but as he does those strange feeling return. Jeremy closes his eyes terrified as to what he will become next. &quot;I have made enough dinners and lunches for you and your friends. they are in the fridge for you. Be sure to eat up and I&#39;ll see you Tuesday call if you need anything. Love you!&quot; Jeremy grunts a reply and slowly opens up his eyes. Before him in the mirror is a spitting image of his father. He stumbles back onto his bed as he realizes that the curse is real, and here he sits in the body of his father in the nude. His father is 52 and just as hairy as his uncle john but his dad is 6&#39;4&quot; like Jeremy. Jeremy&#39;s dad also weighed as much as his uncle John but his height seemed to carry the weight better and Jeremy realized his stomach was smaller than before.  The dumfounded expression on his face did change though. While staring into the mirror and observing his changes Jeremy almost misses the fact that his mother has handed back the phone to his father. That is until he grunts a response to a comment he never really heard and he reverts to the form of his uncle John. With that grunt as their parting words, Jeremy&#39;s Dad hangs up. <br />
	<br />
	Jeremy stares at the mirror not believing what he is seeing and slowly lets the phone slip through his fingers and fall to the floor. As Jeremy begins to return to reality he remembers the words of the women, &quot; From here on out you will become the greatest desire of everyone you talk too.&quot; &quot;OH MY G-D MY DAD IS GAY&quot; He screams and fully comes out the trance he was in.    Jeremy blinks a bit and stares down at the body of his Uncle John that he now has deciding what to do next. While he does I realize that I have become so wrapped up in Jeremy&#39;s life that I too come to understand the woman&#39;s curse. I am seeing Jeremy&#39;s life through his eyes, but then I also have Derek and Luke images going through my head. I have to decide what do I do next?</p>
