<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was some time after Jack flooring the agent that the seething man was sitting in an interrogation room. Full of rage and bile, it took nearly every available agent just to put handcuffs on the man. The federal agents unaware that Jack was a were-panther, they all assumed that the man’s strength was the result of a burst of adrenaline; adrenaline from McVoy pushing the man’s buttons, provoking Jack to commit a crime.<br />
<br />
When Jack was hauled into the room, he took one small comfort with him; the knowledge that his knuckle sandwich made McVoy spit out some teeth as they all left the Condo complex. Grinning despite being handcuffed as the federal agent looked like he went ten rounds in the octagon with a mixed martial arts fighter. Jack smiled when his lawyer entered the interrogation room; letting the business man know that the assault charges were being dropped. With several agents writing up their reports; each stating that special agent McVoy was the instigator with the whole affair while the search warrant was being executed. That however wasn’t enough to get the search warrant quashed; nor was it enough for Jack to leave the interrogation room as he found out he was a suspect in the attempted murder of Frederick Parker.<br />
<br />
“What do you mean they have evidence stating I ordered the man’s murder,” Jack looking livid.<br />
“The emails,” Jack’s lawyer sighing; “the text message from last night plus some call logs. They also have the shooter,” the lawyer adds; “while not co-operating with the feds, the man has not denied that you did hire him.”<br />
“To dig up dirt on my enemies in Moon lake,” Jack swearing; “what would I gain from killing a mobster from California? And if I knew he was a hit man,” Jack shaking his head; “don’t you’d think I would of look some where else?”<br />
“The evidence may be circumstantial,” the lawyer sighing; “but it is overwhelming. And I’m not sure I can make it go away; unlike the evidence in regards to the attack on some teenager,” the lawyer remembering the time he rescued Jack from the state police and Sheriff Cooper’s browbeating on Monday.<br />
<br />
“It was one of them,” Jack glaring at the one way mirror in front of him; “Only Benton or Tachibana would have the resources to do this.”<br />
“Excuse me,” Jack’s lawyer looking at his client.<br />
“Just thinking out loud,” Jack answering before looking at his lawyer; “my wife. Where did they take her?”<br />
The lawyer looking at his notes before staring Jack in the face; “last I saw she was sitting at an agent’s desk. Refusing to answer any questions and demanding that you be released.”<br />
“Good,” Jack taking a brief moment to collect his thoughts; “after you escort her home. Because you and I both know they can’t hold her here for any reason,” Jack looking at the mirror again; wondering who could be watching him sweat. “I want you to use every resource you have available to discredit this… shooter. Find something on Jose that makes him an non-credible witness,” Jack lowering his voice; “afterwards, I want you to call this number.” Jack taking his lawyer’s pen and writing a number down; the number being Tachibana&#39;s direct personal line. “Regardless who answers; I want you to relay this specific message.”<br />
“And the message,” Jack’s lawyer looking at his client; ready to write down what Jack is about to say.<br />
“Make this go away,” Jack glaring; “or the cat will literally be out of the bag.”<br />
<br />
“That is an odd message,” the lawyer commenting; “it’s not code is it? And who is it for specifically?”<br />
“You don’t need to concern yourself with that,” Jack looking at the one way mirror; “just make sure it gets passed on.”<br />
“Very well,” the lawyer getting up; “but before I leave, just remember to refuse to answer any questions while I’m not here.”<br />
“I’m well aware,” Jack looking as his lawyers get up to knock on the door; observing the corrections officer opening the door as the lawyer turns around to look at Jack.<br />
“Just so you know,” the Lawyer speaking; “you will be processed. Finger printed, photos taken; don’t resist it. But don’t answer any questions pertaining to your charges. Just your name, birthdate and all that. I’ll be back with a suit for you, as I will be forcing the prosecutor to have your bail hearing later today. This way you won’t be seeing the judge in the orange jumpsuit prisoners typically wear while in here.”<br />
“Take care of Kenya first,” Jack nodding; “and then what I ask you to do afterwards.”<br />
The lawyer nods as he leaves the room, allowing the corrections officer to enter and escort Jack out to a holding cell.<br />
<br />
********<br />
<br />
Agent Reed looks at Special Agent Nicholas McVoy and sighs inwardly as he is still a normal. Thankful that Benton showed some restraint when pushed from the agent’s verbal barrage of insults and threats. She looks at the sullen agent as he puts the phone down. Agent Reed knew who he was talking to and, could hear the conversation thanks to her enhanced were-hearing.<br />
“Serves you right,” Agent Reed looking unsympathetic to the man; “you don’t bust into a man’s castle threatening him and not expect a reprisal.”<br />
“I had a warrant,” McVoy mumbling; placing an ice pack next to his jaw.<br />
“A warrant to search the premises,” Agent Reed snapping at the downtrodden agent; “it doesn’t give you leave insult and berate.”<br />
“I was questioning the suspect,” McVoy mumbling before getting cut off.<br />
“No,” Agent Reed correcting the man; “what you did was belittle Jack Crawford and his wife Kenya. Baiting him to attack you,” Agent Reed glaring at the man; “you’re lucky the man didn’t kill you.”<br />
“Then he would have been arrest for murder,” McVoy lowering the ice pack; exposing the swollen jaw. “Now we can hold the man for more than twenty four hours,” McVoy smiling; “thanks to my creative speaking.”<br />
“Not likely,” Agent Reed shaking her head; “all you did, was give Jack’s lawyer an excuse to level charges against us. I know you were just talking to the director,” Agent Reed making McVoy’s smirk vanish from his face; “chastising you for your stupid decision. Because of you,” Agent Reed tossing a file on McVoy’s lap; “every agent that witnessed your verbal attack on Jack Crawford had to write up affidavits stating that you created the altercation; when the prosecutor looks at that, your assault charge goes out the window.”<br />
<br />
“Doesn’t change that Jack is now in an orange jumpsuit,” McVoy putting the ice pack back on his jaw.<br />
“It gives his lawyer better leverage for bail,” Agent Reed snapping back; “plus we now lost whatever chance we had in talking to the man. Getting his side of the story and all that,” Agent Reed placing her hand to her temple as if she was getting a headache.<br />
“We don’t need his side,” McVoy getting up; “you got the shooter. Once he rolls on Jack then it’s a slam dunk.”<br />
“Jose is not being talkative,” Agent Reed looking at the senior agent; “and I’m not about to let you change that.”<br />
“Just because you happen to be in good with the director doesn’t give you the authority over what I can can’t do,” McVoy looking at Brooke Reed; watching her grab a document out of a file and handing to him.<br />
<br />
“Actually I do,” Agent Reed watching McVoy’s face drain of all color as he reads the piece of paper; “pending an investigation in regards to your actions, you are hereby suspended from active field duty. By order of the Director you are to surrender your badge and service pistol. Your access to Federal resources will be restricted as you are placed on administrative desk duty. Furthermore,” Agent Reed looking at McVoy as he collapses back in the chair he was sitting in earlier; “you are off the Jack Crawford investigation.”<br />
“And you’re taking the lead?” McVoy swearing; “you a junior agent that has yet to cut her teeth?”<br />
“Well unlike you,” Agent Reed taking out a manila envelope; “the director feels I have what it takes to handle this high profile case. Dealing with the press in Moon Lake and handling the arrest of Jose after he shot Frederick Parker,” Agent Reed staring at McVoy; “it only makes sense. Now hand over your badge and service pistol.”<br />
“When you screw up,” special agent McVoy looking hateful as he tosses his gun and badge on the desk; “and you will. I’ll be there; and I’ll make sure everyone knows of it.”<br />
<br />
“I’ll wager my inexperience over your poor temper and belligerence any day,” Agent Reed watching the man storm out of the office; “at least then, it can be excused. Unlike your attitude,” Agent Reed raising her voice so he and anyone nearby can hear.</p>
