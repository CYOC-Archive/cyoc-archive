<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Almost as if by clockwork, a commotion came from elsewhere in the park. Shouts came from across the pond where you noticed that three bigger looking guys had pushed over a smaller guy into the shallows of the water. Of the three bigger guys, the one who seemed to be the leader looked to be fairly muscular in build. Probably something of a wrestler or a football player. His well styled brown hair and designer stubble complimented his expensive looking clothing, which was something more typical of a preppy kid than someone of his stature. He stood out a bit, however, since the other two of his friends were dressed a little more casually. The one on his right, the shortest of the three, seemed to a bit more slender in build. His blond hair and pale complexion was in stark contrast to the last of the three. The friend on the left was a massive man, well over 6&#39; tall, with large bulging muscles. And when adding in his Mediterranean looking heritage with his tan, olive colored skin and thick beard, he looked much older than he likely was.<br />
<br />
As for the guy who got knocked into the muddy shores of the water, he was a thin man with glasses. Almost stereotypically what one would call a nerd. Whatever he did to the three jocks didn&#39;t matter since at this point he was at the whim of the trio--that is unless another familiar trio intervened.<br />
<br />
&quot;You better watch where you&#39;re going next time, runt. Imagine if I was the one that fell into that mud. Do you know how expensive my clothes are? You&#39;re lucky all you&#39;re gonna need after this is a shower.&quot; The well-dressed jock moved in closer and pretended as if he was going to strike.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, Connor, leave this loser alone. I&#39;m gonna be late picking up my girl, and you know how much shit she gave me last time,&quot; said the tall, dark, and handsome friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;What, you scared she&#39;s gonna blue ball you again? Tony, bro, you gotta drop her she&#39;s not worth it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;At least I&#39;m getting some. You and Zach wish you had a chick as hot as mine. Bro, Zach hasn&#39;t even gotten his dick wet in like a year.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut the fuck up, man,&quot; Zach said. &quot;You&#39;re so whipped you skipped your grandmother&#39;s funeral cause she promised you head. And she told me you and your pencil dick only lasted a minute.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s just lying cause I didn&#39;t finish her off. Bet you wish you could get some of this meat,&quot; Tony gestured at his crotch. The three jocks laughed and continued talking as they walked away from the guy they pushed over, not even paying him any attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jesus, what a group of immature pricks. I can&#39;t believe guys like that actually exist,&quot; Ryan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honestly. Plus, look at the guy on the ground, he&#39;s filthy. I wish those guy would just grow up already,&quot; Carter said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Granted.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Oh God, I didn&#39;t mean--you know what? Go for it, whatever you have planned for them, they probably deserve it anyways.&quot;<br />
<br />
Within a few moments, the wish started setting in. As the three of them, Connor, Tony, and Zach, were walking down the pathway, suddenly Zach stopped, doubling over and clutching his stomach.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, you good? We need to get going,&quot; Tony said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck! No, I&#39;m not good! I feel like something&#39;s burning inside of my stomach.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Want me to carry you, princess? It&#39;s probably just that sandwich you had earlier. I told you not to get the chicken salad,&quot; Connor said laughing at Zach. Although, his laughing would be cut short as he was the next one to get consumed by the pain. And shortly thereafter, Tony followed suit. Soon, the three guys were groaning, nearly falling to the ground. Ryan and Carter moved in a little closer to get a better view of the scene.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gaz, I wish no one would pay them any attention until this is all done,&quot; Ryan said concerned. Not concerned about their well-being, more so about them getting wheeled off in an ambulance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I know better than that. It was already done.&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking over at the small man pulling himself out of the mud, Ryan looks over to Gaz and said, &quot;I wish that the guy they pushed over could have his part in this karma.&quot; Gaz nodded.<br />
<br />
Focusing back on the scene, some changes were starting to become evident. Most notably, Zach was starting to grow larger. His clothes were starting to strain as he was gaining height, but on top of that he also appeared to be gaining muscle mass. Zach was already fairly fit, but now he was looking similar in size to Connor. As his clothes began rolling up his skin, some of the seams looked to be straining as they attempted to hold in the bulging mass growing from within. It was also a little hard to tell, but catching the sunlight, blond hairs slowly started growing where looked previously smooth.<br />
<br />
The other two were starting to go through their own sets of changes at this point. Tony looked to rapidly shrinking in his clothing, down almost a foot from his previous height. But, his clothes didn&#39;t seem to be any less tight on him. Sure, the sleeves and pant legs hung a little lower, but otherwise, the fabric still seemed snug. Taking a closer glance, it&#39;s evident to see why. As Tony reduced in size, his weight didn&#39;t go down with him proportionally, he almost looked squat this way. The muscle mass he had spent so many years putting on transferred into fat as he got smaller. All over his body, he was plumping up. The sculpted abs on his stomach pushed forward as they became a soft gut, riding the shirt up with it as it grew, showing off his new hairy ball of flesh. Elsewhere his jaw softened as the beginnings of a second chin started to form, his pants started tearing around his waist and thighs as more weight piled into his ass and thighs.<br />
<br />
Connor&#39;s changes at the moment were nowhere near as dramatic as Zach or Tony&#39;s. He looked a little bit beefier than before with some of his muscles putting on a layer of fat, but definitely still visibly recognizable as muscles. Additionally, he started looking a little scruffier as his stubble started filling out into a full beard and the hairs on his arms and legs darkened.<br />
<br />
The pain was starting to subside slightly, still present, but enough to the point where they could finally stand up straight and talk again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh God, what&#39;s happening? Why do I feel like shit all of a sudden,&quot; Connor said. As he looked around at his two friends, his jaw dropped. &quot;Holy shit! What the fuck happened to you two?&quot;<br />
<br />
As he asked that question, he heard Zach growl, in a voice much deeper than before. Then with the sound of a ripping shirt, suddenly a shirtless, flexing Zach stood there. He practically looked like a bodybuilder at this point and had grown nearly half a foot so far. And with the ripping of his shirt, his chest more clearly showed the layer of thick blond hairs that had been growing on them.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure, but I feel amazing. Look at these guns!&quot; Zach started flexing and Connor ignored him.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Tony had been standing there grabbing at all the new flesh that had grown over his body. He looked up at Connor with a sad look in his eyes as he grabbed the man boobs that had grow in on his chest. &quot;Bro, how am I gonna go back to my girl when my tits are bigger than hers. I bet she&#39;s even taller than me at this point.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve gotta figure out who or what did this to us. I mean, no offense, Tony, but I can&#39;t go back to practice with all this bulk. I&#39;m way out of my weight class now. Plus, none of my clothes are going to fit. I&#39;ll look like trash.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you fucking kidding me? I just blimped out into a whale, no not a whale, cause I&#39;m too goddamn short for that, now. And you&#39;re concerned about your clothes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, my clothes are more expensive than your car.  I don&#39;t wanna hear it.&quot;<br />
<br />
As those two continued arguing, and Zach admired his new body, they didn&#39;t take note of smaller changes taking place. As was intended with the wish, the subtle effects of maturity began setting in. Tony&#39;s figure started to fill out a little more, his body ripping parts of his clothes as he moved around during all his shouting. With tears revealing more of his body, even with his already plentiful body hair, it was evident that he was getting even hairier as a pelt of fur started growing in on his chest. His limbs began darkening as the skin underneath became harder to see. The beard of his face started growing further down, reaching the top of his chest. As would be the case with all of them, lines and wrinkles set in on their face around their eyes and around their mouth.<br />
<br />
Similarly, Connor was going through his own changes as his body grew with time. His muscles didn&#39;t change too much, the only thing that really grew was something of a gut as his body began to take on a sort dad bod visage. Connor wasn&#39;t too hairy to begin with, but that would change as body hair grew across him. Nothing as bad as Tony, but definitely noticeable. As it grew in however, it wasn&#39;t necessarily the same brown that matched the hair on his head. In fact, a lot of the hair that grew in on his chest and in his beard was a mixture of that same brown with increasingly more flecks of grey smattered in there. Eventually it got to the point where most of his hair was a darker gray color. It started to recede a little bit, causing his forehead to be slightly larger.<br />
<br />
Zach, completely enamored with his own transformation didn&#39;t even notice as his blond body hair grew slightly lighter as he got older. As for the hair on his head, what used to be a soft curl of hair on top was reduced to a buzzcut as to help hide the balding. Compared to the other two, time was kind to Zach and he maintained his muscular, bodybuilder-esque form. He did, however, start to feel pleasure start to overtake the discomfort as the bulge in his underwear filled out more in an already tight space.<br />
<br />
Soon enough, the changes settled in and the pain and discomfort washed away. Standing there now in their new forms were Tony, the big, hairy bear of a man, Connor, the silver-haired dilf, and Zach, the mature mountain of muscle. While they all seemed to be well older than they were before, Tony and Zach looked to be in their late 30s, whereas Connor was likely in his late 40s, pushing 50.<br />
<br />
Feeling the calm set in, Connor was once again the first to point out the new changes. &quot;What kind of weird shit is this? Whose sick idea was it to turn us into a bunch of old guys.&quot;<br />
<br />
Although, little did Connor know, the changes weren&#39;t exactly finished yet. And Tony would be the first to experience that. &quot;I don&#39;t know, man. This doesn&#39;t seem all that bad. We&#39;re still sexy as hell, I mean look at Zach over there. He&#39;s an absolute beefcake.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, you really think so? Why don&#39;t you come over here and get yourself a feel.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Guys, can we focus? We just lost decades of our lives and are probably stuck in these gross, old hairy bodies unless we do something. I mean, come on, Tony, you can&#39;t tell me you&#39;re happy with all that lard. You used to be shredded, bro.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tony grabbed his belly and shook it a bit. &quot;You mean this? I think it&#39;s great. Just more to grab onto anyways. Right, Zach?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You bet, babe,&quot; Zach said, grabbing a fistful of one of Tony&#39;s hairy tits. With both of them groping each other&#39;s new bodies, it wasn&#39;t long until they started making out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fucking gross, why are you two acting like a couple of fruits? You can&#39;t tell me you don&#39;t like pussy anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can&#39;t do this with a pussy, Connor,&quot; Tony said, grabbing the waistband of Zach&#39;s shredded clothing and pulling them down. Tony began licking Zach&#39;s erection causing Connor to turn away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why is this happening to me? My friends get turned into some gross, hairy cocksuckers, but more importantly, I can&#39;t go back to my old life like this. At least I still kind of have my muscles. Plus, I didn&#39;t turn gay like those two, so it could be worse.&quot; Connor was talking himself through his changes while walked over to a bench. He thought it was kind of weird that people seemed to be walking by without taking in the sight of Tony and Zach fucking over there, or even him while he was changing. That was until a young, studly looking guy walked up directly to Connor--kind like what he used to look like.<br />
<br />
&quot;There you are. I&#39;ve been looking for you for a little while now,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve met. Sorry, would you mind going away? I&#39;m having kind of a rough day.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t think so. That didn&#39;t stop you earlier when you pushed me into the mud,&quot; the man smirked. &quot;Yeah, I know, don&#39;t really look the same. Guess we&#39;ve both been through a lot of changes today, and I didn&#39;t even get your name. You know what though? I don&#39;t think that matters anymore since I don&#39;t owe you any respect. You&#39;re just my little bitch now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Connor wanted to snap back and tell him off, but something inside him was stopping him from doing so. &quot;Okay, sir.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll do whatever I want, wear what I tell you to wear, and please me whenever I feel like. I thought you were sexy as hell before and full disclosure, that&#39;s why I bumped into you, got a bit distracted. But look at you now, you&#39;re even sexier looking like silver haired fox. And you know, usually guys like me would be calling you daddy, but don&#39;t you think it&#39;d be more fun if you did that instead? I think so. Now put on these clothes, slut.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, daddy.&quot; Connor unfolded the clothing and saw a mesh tank top and a pair of booty shorts. Also, hidden away in the folds of the skimpy clothing, Connor found a dog collar.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, good. You found the collar. It&#39;s illegal to walk your dog around without one, you know? Don&#39;t worry, I have the leash right here.&quot; Connor put on the clothing, including the collar, and the young stud hooked his leash onto him. &quot;Now, why don&#39;t you give daddy a kiss.&quot;<br />
<br />
Connor leaned over and gave him a peck on the cheek. &quot;That&#39;s it? What dog have you seen kiss like that? Try again.&quot;<br />
<br />
This time when Connor went in for a kiss, his new daddy pulled his head in and started to French kiss him. As he felt the tongue entering his mouth, suddenly all the inhibitions washed away and he melted in his arms. He felt hands exploring his new body, running themselves through his chest hair and beard. After a minute or so, he felt the kiss break off. &quot;Man, that was good. And I love my dogs with a good amount of fur? You have anything like this before? Cause you&#39;ll have to get used to it since you&#39;re not ever shaving your body. So, why don&#39;t we go back to my place and you can show me how furry you really are.&quot;<br />
<br />
Connor&#39;s daddy pulled on the leash and he followed him. He was a little scared before, but now he had a skip in step as he looked forward to pleasing his daddy later. As they walked, Connor, remembering his friends, glanced over his shoulder and saw the two of them on the ground fully exploring each other&#39;s bodies with what seemed to be Tony&#39;s large body get bent over by Zach as he thrusted in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry about those two, I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll be fine. You only have one man you have to be concerned with now.&quot; Connor turned back around and smiled as he ran up to his daddy and gave him a wet kiss on the cheek.<br />
<br />
Ryan and Carter were both fully hard and groping their dicks as they watched the scene develop in front of them. &quot;That was super hot, Gaz. I&#39;m thoroughly impressed with you this time, you&#39;ve outdone yourself,&quot; Ryan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;And look at Tony and Zach in the grass over there. Almost makes me wanna run over there and join them myself,&quot; Carter said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You always could, guys. Remember, anything you want is just a wish away.&quot; Gaz winked,</p>
