<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Keiko brushed up against all of her siblings (Akira included) with her tails, her way of <br />
saying ‘good-bye and good luck.’ ‘You won’t catch me saying it Anna, but I understand <br />
you need one of us to stay behind as the emergency back up... I just hope I can -do- <br />
something useful before those absurdly numbered genies I keep hearing about descend <br />
like a comet.’<br />
<br />
<br />
As much as Jasmine would have loved to use her new seniority to call off this fool’s errand <br />
and disperse this ship -of- fools, she had still made a promise to Tabra to follow through <br />
on this mission. And indeed she wanted to see Tabra’s last idea fail in flames first hand. <br />
And if this material form got accidently obliterated when his 10,000 dijinn descended to <br />
cleanse the desert of Karther's infection, well, no big loss.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It still like for the new and old angels alike like wearing a straight with  their wings hidden. <br />
(Story tellers sometimes get things right.) <br />
<br />
Kyriel said, “We can’t teleport directly to the city, Tamthis’ -will- sense it, no matter how <br />
good our camouflage. We’re going to have to leg it.”<br />
<br />
Erica stiffened slightly, the idea of marching in the desert heat with fur underneath full <br />
body coverings wasn’t pleasant. ‘Don’t complain soldier.’ She told herself, ‘ If you don’t <br />
have a better solution then, you’re just going to make it worse for everyone else.’&nbsp;<br />
<br />
“Geeze!” Moaned Akira, “Maybe I should create an illusion caravan out of some leafs to <br />
carry all my junk. Any of you mind being turned into muscular human, er, fox pack <br />
mules?”<br />
<br />
“No,” Kyriel injected, “The less attention we draw the better. You’re going to draw enough <br />
attention as is. If we had time to put together a more stealthy plan I’d be all for it...then <br />
again we had that sort of time...I wouldn’t be standing here.”&nbsp;<br />
<br />
That shut most everybody up. Her reserves fully charged and greater than they had ever <br />
been before, Kyriel teleported her siblings and Jasmine to the surface out of their <br />
sanctuary.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Kyriel actually took a minute to observe the desert sands and the cruel hot sun and the <br />
pale blue sky it sat in as if she was seeing them with her own eyes for the first time. Oh <br />
right. She was.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
“Lead the way oh husband.” Jasmine said her voice dripping with sarcasm.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
“Karthis City is that direction.” Alexandra pointed with all the precision of a <br />
compass.&nbsp;'We're coming back for you my prince.' <br />
<br />
“Off we go then!” Akira more cheerfully than most would going straight into a deadly game <br />
of hide and seek.&nbsp;He considered a great sacrifice on his own part that to play the part of <br />
one of the people tricked by Tamthis, he had to appear to have only one tail. <br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
Samir didn't know what to think the populations of some nearby population centers <br />
vanished into thin air. Rumor spread like wildfire about... well... EVERYTHING! New <br />
American-pig vaporization ray, Sneak attack by some clan out for blood, (the fact that <br />
those who vanished were from conflicting clans slipped the minds of all), to some ultra <br />
strange sand storm were all considered by someone to some degree. <br />
<br />
In the mist of this curing soup of fear and confusion, the appearance of a fennec creature <br />
giving warns of an army of 10,000 dijinn coming to systematically destroy them all just <br />
happened to occur when this mix of paranoia and lack of information was right at it's <br />
peak.  <br />
<br />
Samir, scared for himself and his sons, was eager to believe anyone who actually seemed <br />
able to -back-up- their story. And the fennec, was no dijinn, explained that the king of <br />
the desert foxes, was offering the humans on the outskirts of his kingdom protection... for <br />
a price. <br />
<br />
Of course many rejected the sheer idea as pure blaspheme. This number decreased when <br />
it was sublimely hinted at, but not right out said, that the dijinn were responsible for the <br />
vanishing of so many people, some of whom their great king had rescued from the dijinn. <br />
The fennec then revealed himself to be from one of the clan that had gone missing and <br />
proceeded to go on and on about how it was transparently clear that Tamthis was a gift <br />
from the One God himself to protect his people from these evil spirits. <br />
<br />
And Samir, like nearly all people now, eager for anyone who could give them a answer for <br />
what was going on and a solution, accepted this message that was given to him at last. <br />
<br />
The transmutation as promised had been quick and painless, and Samir swore he could <br />
comprehend the world in a much clearer way now. Samir and his sons (along with his wife) <br />
were eager and excited now to enter and visit upon King Tamthis' glorious city. Where they <br />
would be protected without fail from the evil dijinn army! <br />
<br />
Samir was glade when his family met with what was apparently a wealthy oil sheik. The <br />
sheik had no less than seven wives! Neither the sheik or his wives spoke much about <br />
themselves, apparently wishing to keep to themselves. One wife stood near the sheik <br />
always glancing at the horizon. Four stood in along a marching order. One kept looking at <br />
everything. The last one, walked calmly behind the others. <br />
<br />
Samir seeing their swaying tails, and not being able to take his eyes off them shook his <br />
head. Clearly, these new body parts would need to be declared required covering in the <br />
immediate future. All the same, he was very very glade to have happened to be in the <br />
company of a sheik. He felt safer like he was within the walls of Karthis already. <br />
<br />
Jasmine was grinding her teeth every time someone mentioned the 'evil dijinn army.' <br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
Julio sat down to play solitaire. With Jasim in the picture, there was no way Julio could <br />
hope to get into Karther's city to try and root out any new divine truths to add to his <br />
brain's library. Real pity. Worst pity was not being able to see T's final hours. Yes he knew <br />
it was what was going to happen naturally. But T' for better or worse had been someone <br />
Julio had known on and off over the centuries for better or worse, and ultimate had been <br />
one of the things that had kept Julio sane in his seemingly endless question for achieve <br />
ultimate truth while still a living man. He mourned the loss of his centuries long <br />
acquaintance. 'Good-bye T'. Was fun while it lasted.' <br />
<br />
&quot;Red five on the black six.&quot; <br />
<br />
Julio started and nearly called a rocket launcher into existence when he saw the kitsune <br />
Keiko sitting calmly in front of him. <br />
<br />
&quot;What did, when did -you- get in here?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My sisters told me about this spot before Jasim came back with Janice.... my sister really <br />
is gone isn't she?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. She no longer exists. Kyriel is her own person. No two ways about it. I'm sorry little <br />
fox.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I guess I'll have to get to know my -new- sister then... wanna play cards?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;With a kitesune?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Keep that paranoia as Anna would say, it'll serve you well among many trickster animal <br />
spirits. But seriously, I want a harmless way to both of us to pass the time.&quot; <br />
<br />
Julio consented and soon enough after a short explanation of the rules the two of them <br />
were playing the japanese cousin to Go-Fish. Keiko was using her tails to somehow hold <br />
her cards.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what'll you do if they fail?&quot; Keiko asked calmly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll do what I've always done. Move on. It's something you learn when you've been alive <br />
long enough.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll take your word for it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You won't need to when you see your friends and family die of old age, and their children <br />
then die of old age, until you are but a legend to your own family.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You would know?&quot; Keiko asked not looking up from her cards as they played. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. So what about you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh. Going to be a heroic idiot and try to save my sisters in a last ditch effort before the <br />
trumpet calls and the genies lay down the law. And do my absolute best to trick, bribe, or <br />
force you to come along because I know I'll need all the help I can get.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Isn't tell me before hand kinda self defeating then?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you know that isn't what I want you to think?&quot; <br />
<br />
Julio realized he had no retort to that. Ugh. She may been a kitesune for only a day or two, <br />
but she already had the 'play with someone's head like a fiddle' down pat. &quot;You really think <br />
you'll be able to?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I doubt it'll really end with the genies obliterating Karther's kingdom. The fall out from <br />
that kind of conflict is bound to leave a lot more chaos, and possibly destroy or loss a lot <br />
of precious knowledge.&quot; <br />
<br />
Julio shuddered, leave it to a kitesune. &quot;So do you think your adopted siblings will be able <br />
to save us all?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I pray so.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You pray so?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is the land of the faiths, if praying can have any effect, it's here. So I pray for no <br />
deaths, and Tammie being knocked back to her senses.&quot;</p>
