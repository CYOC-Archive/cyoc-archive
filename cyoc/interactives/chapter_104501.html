<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As his wife and daughter entered the private office he used as Mayor of Moon Lake, Martin Stovall was glad he secretly had it soundproofed years ago, back when he was still actively &quot;playing the field&quot; despite being married to the lovely blonde woman before him. While his daughter Julie had thankfully inherited her mother&#39;s good looks, it was becoming more apparent each day that she had inherited some of his personality traits, especially those pertaining to sex.<br />
&quot;Sit down young lady. We need to talk,&quot; was all Martin said, indicating one of the empty chairs in front of his desk.<br />
The fact that her mother had locked the door behind them was not lost on the younger were-mermaid, as she nervously did as she was told.<br />
&quot;Moon Lake faces an impending crisis,&quot; began her father.<br />
Julie&#39;s first thought was to say &quot;What? Again?&quot; but she remained silent, thankful that apparently the discussion they were about to have had nothing to do with her, or her plans for revenge against Eric Anderson and Spencer Lawson.<br />
&quot;Have you seen this man anywhere recently?&quot; asked her father, showing Julie a picture of Sean Walker.<br />
&quot;No,&quot; she answered honestly, keeping to herself the fact Julie thought he was cute and would fuck him in a heartbeat, even if he wasn&#39;t already a were.<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s a rogue FBI agent by the name of Sean Walker, who seems hellbent and determined to discover the <i>secret</i> of Moon Lake,&quot; revealed Martin.<br />
&quot;You mean weres?&quot; asked Melissa in disbelief, forgetting for a moment that this talk was supposed to be concerning Julie.<br />
&quot;No. Not specifically. But being here during the incidents with the Bower family, the man&#39;s noticed how young and healthy most everyone in town looks and wants to get to the bottom of that. He doesn&#39;t know it&#39;s because we&#39;re all weres though. At least not yet,&quot; explained Martin.<br />
<i>Those damn Lawsons,</i> realized Julie, as she let her father continue.<br />
&quot;He&#39;s with his fellow agents right now, hopefully getting chewed out big time for conducting an unauthorized investigation of civilians,&quot; said the Mayor hopefully, &quot;but it will only be a matter of time before he either gets another vacation or something brings him back here in an official capacity. Whatever the case, you can be sure Walker will start poking around again at the first opportunity he gets.&quot;<br />
&quot;So what do we do?&quot; wondered Julie.<br />
&quot;Glad you asked,&quot; said her father, and he actually had a smile on his face, which worried her. &quot;Evan Lawson and his fellow military weres are initiating a plan so that the next time Walker is in town nosing around, we&#39;ll take care of his curiosity once and for all. But to successfully execute it, we&#39;ll need your help,&quot; added the mayor, while looking directly at his daughter.<br />
&quot;Me? How?&quot; asked Julie in disbelief.<br />
&quot;From now on, you are to have absolutely NOTHING to do with the Andersons or the Lawsons!&quot; announced Martin Stovall, lowering the boom on her. &quot;That ESPECIALLY includes Eric and Spencer. You are not to look at them, nor speak to them, and get any crazy thoughts of whatever your twisted idea of revenge is out of your head once and for all!&quot;<br />
&quot;WHAT THE FUCK?&quot; asked Julie, forgetting herself and who she was talking to.<br />
<br />
&quot;You heard your father young lady,&quot; said Melissa, shocked because this was the first she was hearing about Julie having any revenge schemes, but backing her husband&#39;s plan.<br />
&quot;You&#39;re swimming bad waters right now Julie. I should know, because I&#39;ve been there,&quot; said her father. &quot;It may seem like all fun and games, and there&#39;s no denying how great sex can be, especially when done right,&quot; he added, which earned a severe scowl from his wife. &quot;Yet I realize now that I can&#39;t do everything I did when I was single. Despite the mistakes I&#39;ve made,&quot; said Martin, referring to his sexual unfaithfulness with Melissa, &quot;I still love your mother dearly and want to spend the rest of my life with her,&quot; he said, looking at Melissa and giving her a sincere smile.<br />
Melissa stared at her husband in return. True, he didn&#39;t cheat on her with Alyssa Cooper, despite how much the rival were-mermaid tried to get him to. However one day did not undo years of cheating, although Martin sounded genuinely sincere, so she smiled at him in return.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, like you said though. I&#39;m still single,&quot; pointed out Julie, &quot;and I intend to stay that way for a mighty long time.&quot;<br />
<i>Just like Alyssa,</i> realized her father, while her mother said, &quot;And what kind of reputation do you gain in the meantime? <i>Julie&#39;s an easy lay? She&#39;ll fuck anything with a cock!</i>&quot;<br />
Julie was shocked, but whether because of the actual words or the fact it was her mother speaking them, she wasn&#39;t sure.<br />
&quot;Look, your mother and I both know you&#39;re young, and we also know what it&#39;s like to have a were&#39;s libido. We both love and care about you, which is why we&#39;re having this... intervention, for lack of a better word.&quot;<br />
&quot;Think about your future Julie. Besides running the risk of permanently damaging your reputation, what happens if you forget to take your were-mermaid birth control pill? As fertile as weres are, it only takes one time. Do you want to have a child before you&#39;ve even graduated high school?&quot; her mother wanted to know.<br />
&quot;No,&quot; admitted Julie, stopping to think if that was something she wanted to do even after graduating college. <i>But if I wind up being a mother before I even graduate high school...</i><br />
&quot;Look. Your mother and I understand first hand how hard it is growing up as a teenager, both from the were and the normal perspective, since we didn&#39;t meet until after we both graduated college,&quot; said Martin Stovall. &quot;So we know this is a lot to take in. But as not only your father but as the Mayor of Moon Lake as well; at the very least you are NOT leaving this office until we have your <i>official</i> solemn vow that you will leave Eric and Spencer alone from now on, forever, no matter what!&quot;<br />
<br />
Julie Stovall looked at both of her parents, genuinely afraid for the first time in her life.<br />
As a were, to make such a promise and then go back on it might not only put the town at risk, but to become an &quot;oath breaker&quot; meant not only jail time, but to be permanently exiled from Moon Lake once her prison sentence was served! Provided she survived whatever danger the town was facing to begin with.<br />
No one had suffered that punishment during her life time (so far), but every were for the good of all weres world wide knew the law and its consequences.<br />
No one was above the reach of that statute, not even the Mayor&#39;s daughter.<br />
Taking one last look at her parents, Julie reluctantly said, &quot;I swear, by all I hold dear as a were, that Eric Anderson and Spencer Lawson have nothing to fear from me any more.&quot;<br />
To that, Melissa and Martin Stovall smiled, not knowing that Julie silently added afterward, <i>But if there is any way I can ever get anyone else to unknowingly do my dirty work for me without me getting in trouble afterward because of it...</i></p>
