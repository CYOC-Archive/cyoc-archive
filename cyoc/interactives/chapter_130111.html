<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I stepped in the door. No one was around. I called out &quot; Hi Mum I&#39;&#39;m home&quot;<br />
An answer came from down the hall to the left &quot;Hi Sarah dinner will be about 20 minutes, how was your day?&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll be with you in a minute Mum&quot; I called back and using what Zach had told me found the way to my room.<br />
I pushed open the door to find the pinkest room I had ever seen. There was a single bed in a corner, with a pink quilt, covered in teddy bears. There were posters of some boy band on the walls which were painted a lighter shade of pink. Sarah was 23 I thought, not 16. There was a dressing table and mirror on the opposite side to the bed beside a window. On it was a photo of Sarah and Rod. At least I was in the right room. A built-in robe was across the far end of the room. I opened a door and saw rows of outfits hanging. At he other end of the robe were some drawers which upon inspection contained stockings, panties and other feminine items. The top drawer appeared to be full of jewellery and small keepsakes. <br />
I put down my bag and walked down the hall to where I heard Mum&#39;s voice.<br />
&quot;Hi Dear, how was you day&quot; Mum asked as she saw me enter. <br />
&#39;Interesting&quot; I replied. A great understatement<br />
&quot;Oh&quot; she replied inviting an explanation. <br />
Realizing I could not explain, I changed the subject &quot;Monique and James called in before leaving for home&quot; Then added &quot;Zach has bought a puppy&quot; That worked and we spent 10 minutes discussing the new hound. Until Mum asked me to go and fetch Dad. I waited for her to say from where. She just looked strangely at me and eventually said &quot;Where he always is&quot; I blushed with embarrassment and there was an awkward pause. &quot;Really girl what is with you&quot; and walked out a door at the side of the kitchen. I watched as she walked out to a rear shed and returned a minute later with my new Dad.<br />
&quot;Hello Sarah. How was your day?&quot; I replied telling him about Rod&#39;s new puppy as we ate dinner.<br />
Eventually I asked &quot;Where is Jenna?&quot; Dad looked distressed and replied that they had not seen or heard from her since leaving the restaurant last night. I gathered this was not unusual. <br />
After dinner and helping Mum clean up, I begged tiredness and went to my room while my parents settled in front of the TV. <br />
Back in the room I spent more time going through the wardrobe. I must admit I enjoyed trying on some of dresses and lacy undergarments.<br />
Eventually I decided the boy band posters had to go, if this was going to be my room I would rearrange it as I liked, so down they came. With that I went through the bed time routine Zach had outlined. I noticed a spot of blood on the undies I had been wearing. I had seen Amanda insert pads in her undies but had thought it was something to do with dripping semen and consequently never asked about it. I had seen some similar thin pads in one of the drawers so a grabbed some new panties and inserted a pad.  If this was what girls had to go through after sex I could see why they were generally more reluctant than the average male.<br />
I then donned a conservative nightie I had found under the pillow, threw the teddies on the floor and promptly fell asleep.  <br />
    ....................<br />
I was awoken at 7.00am. My new mum called out that it was time to rise and shine. I opened my eyes and recalled where I was and who I now was.<br />
As I sat up I felt a bit wet in my private parts. I looked down and gasped with shock. My nightie was dotted with red as were the sheets. My undies and the pad were soaked. Rods penis must have caused quite a tear. I rushed to the bathroom and tried to clean up. I stripped off and jumped in the shower. It certainly still felt very tender down there. When I dried myself I noticed there was still a trickle of blood. I had no choice but to ring Zach on my old phone and explain my predicament. We had swapped phones along with our lives so I knew his number.<br />
A sleepy Zach answered eventually and I explained my symptoms. His thought was that it wasn&#39;t anything serious. I was just having a period. He explained where to find thicker pads and how to clean up. <br />
I had just found the pads he had described when the phone rang again. It was Zach. He excitedly said that if I was having a period I couldn&#39;t be pregnant! We could swap back. He remembered that after the gala ball last month his period had started the next day. He asked me when I had first spotted any blood. I answered in the bath yesterday. &quot;Ok, you will need to get to work, a period is no excuse for a day off. Take a supply of pads and change them frequently. I&#39;ll investigate if there are any other reasons why the medallion didn&#39;t function. I&#39;ll meet you after work at Rod&#39;s</p>
