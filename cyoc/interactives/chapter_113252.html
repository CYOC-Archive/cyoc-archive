<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">William&#39;s morning began relatively quietly, but early as it had to on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, so that was fairly typical. He woke up with his arms wrapped around Martha with her legs wrapped around his and his and her tails laying over each other. He also found their muzzles perfectly aligned to that the black triangle that was his nose in fox form was touching the brown triangle at the tip of Martha&#39;s muzzle, which was nice. The two got up, showered together, dressed, and had breakfast before saying good bye to Nate and Eric with reminders to get to school on time and headed out. William arrived at the campus on time and set the things he didn&#39;t need down in his office before moving to the classroom that his eight o&#39;clock class met in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning, Mr. Anderson,&quot; came a fairly warm voice from the group of students on their way to the door as he unlocked it.<br />
<br />
William looked up to see Jenny and Harry approaching and looking fairly well rested and even optimistic. He knew that both probably had plenty to worry about regarding their wedding, but he also figured that the closer the wedding came and the less trouble that directly touched them, the better they&#39;d feel. He nodded and opened the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;And good morning to you, too,&quot; William replied, &quot;I trust things are going as well as they can?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As they can,&quot; Harry answered, &quot;I don&#39;t think either of us planned on spending more nights in a safe room, even after Jenny&#39;s transformation was completed... but the bed has been comfortable and we have each other.&quot;<br />
<br />
William nodded. Like him, Harry and Jenny were new werefoxes in Moon Lake, though from what he&#39;d heard were a bit different. He was based on a fairly typical Red Fox which made sense, given that the Red Fox had a natural range that included all of Europe, northern Asia, and North America, which would make sense for most werefoxes to be some color phase of the Red Fox. Harry, however, was a Gray Fox and Jenny was a Fennec Fox. It was different, but William figured that was interesting, and for Harry and Jenny, they were surely bonded mates and simply being together would feel for them the same way he felt to wake up next to Martha.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that&#39;s good,&quot; William commented, &quot;and hopefully things go well through the weekend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s our hope too,&quot; Jenny agreed, &quot;thankfully that second agent hasn&#39;t done anything, yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
Not knowing that that second agent had already pulled something that morning, William nodded and let the two in. The eight o&#39;clock class would be starting soon and he had a few last minute things to take care of.  While he handled that, Harry and Jenny came in and took their seats, which were, of course, side by side. Other students came in and William could hear some small talk to Harry and Jenny, but it all sounded well and friendly. He simply busied himself with his own work to get ready for the class.<br />
<br />
And the class went relatively well as William managed to get his students involved in many of the various basic points that went around with regard to Shakespeare&#39;s plays and how they were used, and particularly with the play they were starting with. Harry and Jenny also both felt calm and comfortable time and put in some of their points where they could. There was a lot that they could manage in the afternoon and evenings with regard to reading and &quot;homework&quot; but there were somethings that weren&#39;t that easy, particularly with having to stay in the college&#39;s safe room. Because the system of &quot;safe rooms&quot; was set up to help new weres who&#39;s transformations were incomplete, many things in them had been specially made to be very sturdy and to support the weight of a fully transformed were and survive any potential violent action than an incomplete were might take. This kept things like electronics to an absolute bare minimum, and thus, neither Harry nor Jenny were able to work on anything that would require a computer in that safe room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, that is a fairly common theme with many of Shakespeare&#39;s plays and particularly the ones we know best, like Romeo and Juliet and Othello, include elements that have love holding a very tragic portion to it,&quot; William nodded in response to a point that Harry had made in the discussion, &quot;be it the the &quot;war&quot; between the Montagues and Capulets in Romeo and Juliet and Iago&#39;s schemes in Othello. It helps set the conflict for these plays, and while they may have tragic endings, that can teach us very valuable lessons in life when we think about it. Not to forbid people to love someone from a certain family for any reason... and not to quickly believe rumors and go into a jealous rage.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry and Jenny both nodded at that. On some level they could see some similarity to their own situation in the story of Romeo and Juliet in that Dieter Wilhelm had long laid claim on Jenny, no matter how often she rejected him, and her parents had seemed to miss all the flaws in Dieter in order to try and improve their own economic standing. Yet, Jenny had never loved him and loved Harry. They both hoped that they&#39;d be able to get through things better than Romeo and Juliet did. They worked through their notes as the discussion moved when there was a knock on the door. All heads turned to it to see Dean Myers and Akane no Tachibana standing quietly outside the door. William paused the discussion to approach the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is something wrong, sir?&quot; William asked to the Dean.<br />
<br />
&quot;On campus, nothing is wrong, although there has been an event that Mr. Jenkins will need to be informed of and excused for,&quot; Dean Myers spoke calmly.<br />
<br />
Harry picked up on that with the mention of his family name being mentioned. He felt Jenny touch his hand. He watched as Mr. Anderson nodded and turned back toward Harry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ms. Harper would need to be informed as well,&quot; Akane added, &quot;as she will be joining the Jenkins family and will relate to her as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry watched as Mr. Anderson glanced between Dean Myers and Akane and then back to the dean. Dean Myers nodded Mr. Anderson then returned his full attention to Harry and Jenny.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. Jenkins, Ms. Harper, there is something that you will need to be informed of,&quot; William spoke carefully, &quot;please take your things with you, as this may take up the remainder of class.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both of them looked up to see that class was more than half over and that there wasn&#39;t too terribly much time left in the class period. They gathered their things and slowly made their way out into the hallway. As they made their way out, William shut the door behind them and moved to stand in front of Dean Myers and the Skulk&#39;s leader. After a few moments, Akane spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;I apologize for interrupting your classes, but I felt it better that you learn this from the Skulk and not from someone who will be far more impersonal than those that will support you,&quot; Akane spoke calmly but with some tone that was trying to hold back something.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is something wrong?&quot; Jenny asked, fearful of the agent coming onto the campus, &quot;has that guy come for us?&quot;<br />
<br />
Akane&#39;s answer made Harry&#39;s eyes open wide with fear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dieter Wilhelm&#39;s agent has acted,&quot; Akane said solemnly, &quot;and against who he thought was you, Harry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who he... he didn&#39;t go after my dad, did he?&quot; Harry asked fearfully.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not your father,&quot; Akane answered, &quot;but your brother. He shot and seriously wounded your brother as he went into work...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;HUCK!&quot; Harry found himself screaming and collapsing into Jenny&#39;s arms, &quot;HUCK! NO!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Will he be okay?&quot; Jenny asked nervously and held Harry to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;For the moment, it would appear so,&quot; Akane managed, &quot;the shot didn&#39;t kill him outright and the police and a coworker were able to keep him alive long enough for the ambulance to arrive. From there, I cannot give you any further updates on his status.&quot;<br />
<br />
By this point, Harry was clutching at Jenny and couldn&#39;t say much of anything. Jenny did her best to hold back feelings that all of this was her fault and held Harry to her. She patted her lover&#39;s back and looked to Akane.<br />
<br />
&quot;Was the shooter caught?&quot; Jenny asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not as yet, but from the last update I&#39;ve gotten from the Skulk&#39;s security forces,&quot; Akane answered, &quot;Mr. Wilhelm&#39;s agent has used up all the rounds for what is likely a Smith & Wesson Model 500 .50-Cal. Magnum revolver and is on foot. I doubt he will escape the weredog officers chasing him and it is even more unlikely that he will win any resulting physical confrontation.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny didn&#39;t answer but turned her attentions to Harry, who was trembling and fearful that his older brother would die. She wanted Dieter Wilhelm&#39;s agent dead. The man had given her too much pain in some way or another and had never taken &quot;no&quot; for an answer. Shoot, she had kicked Dieter in the groin once. She&#39;d thought THAT would be an indication that she wasn&#39;t into him. Maybe the death of employees would be enough to make Dieter Wilhelm realize that she was not worth the money he was spending to pursue her. However, she couldn&#39;t put her focus on vengeance. Harry was clearly distraught over his brother being shot because of her. She needed to comfort her mate the best she could.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can we go to him?&quot; Jenny asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve cleared it with your professors,&quot; Dean Myers spoke, &quot;in an email, anyway, and I told Mr. Anderson to excuse you. So you are clear on my end.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I am here to provide anything you may need,&quot; Akane spoke, &quot;all of this relates to the Skulk&#39;s debt to you, which we WILL repay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But we&#39;ve steadily made your work harder,&quot; Jenny pointed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rogue weres are an embarrassment and disappointment to all weres,&quot; Akane answered firmly, with a look of firmness that not even her gray hairs and faint age lines could hide, &quot;and when it comes from our own part of the community... the Skulk will atone for the sins committed in their entirety. You didn&#39;t deserve to be scratched against your will and you DO deserve happiness. We will do whatever we legally can to assure that you get it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Harry managed, before Akane began to lead them out.</p>
