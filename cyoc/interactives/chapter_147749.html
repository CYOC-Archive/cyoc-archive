<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The debate raged for quite a while.<br />
To undertake a controlled reveal to the rest of the world that their kind actually existed?<br />
Many, especially the older ones who were already well into their first century of life or beyond,* obviously were not happy with the possibility of being exposed, whether intentionally or not. They had lived peaceful existences for quite a while in Moon Lake and wanted life to continue that way.<br />
They had learned from an early age to hide who they truly were for fear of being shunned by everyone else, or worse.<br />
&quot;If we do reveal ourselves, what about the lookie loos?&quot; one were, standing near William and Martha Anderson asked.<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Katherine Chambers, Deputy Mayor and the chair person of the meeting asked.<br />
&quot;All the alleged tourists who will come here wanting to see us for themselves. We&#39;re not freaks or animals that belong in a zoo, let alone something undesirable that should be put down because someone thinks we&#39;re a mistake.&quot;<br />
&quot;That is why we need to control the narrative now, while it is still possible,&quot; Tom Herald reminded them. &quot;To show normals, like I used to be, that there is nothing to fear from were society.&quot;<br />
&quot;Besides, if the measure passes, we&#39;d only be revealing were existence. Not where we are or anything specific concerning Moon Lake,&quot; Chambers pointed out. She knew she was repeating herself, but she wanted to make sure this debate remained civil. It had been a long evening already, but Katherine would stick with it as long as it took to reach a vote, whatever the outcome.<br />
&quot;But how will that affect other weres around the world?&quot; someone else asked. &quot;It&#39;s bad enough that Moon Lake has very little contact with our furry brethren as it is, provided there even are any. Maybe they like staying hidden and will be mad if we reveal were existence.&quot;<br />
&quot;Mad enough to fight back? Against us?&quot; a lady wondered.<br />
&quot;Well I for one would love to know that there ARE more weres in the world than just what&#39;s in our town. Wouldn&#39;t you?&quot; another were replied. &quot;Moon Lake can&#39;t contain the only weres on the entire planet. The odds of that—&quot;<br />
&quot;On the other side of the coin,&quot; began a college student a few rows in front of the Andersons that William recognized from around the campus but didn&#39;t have in any of his classes, &quot;I can take you to several sites on the Internet where people love anthropomorphic beings like us and would love to become one themselves if they could. Can you imagine the were population explosion if that happened?&quot;<br />
&quot;Ladies and gentlemen,&quot; Chambers said, trying to bring the room under control again. &quot;Let me repeat this so everyone understands. If the matter before us passes, how and when we reveal weres exist are issues that still need to be worked out in other meetings before any action is actually taken. But we would only be revealing that. Where we are and how to become one if a normal wants to join will remain our secret.&quot; <i>For now, at least,</i> she realized.<br />
<br />
Of course (as s1 wrote in our previous episode) things weren&#39;t fully eased with those worries as the debate ended with a 4-3 vote in favor of Tom&#39;s proposed plan. He had his points, and William and Martha privately had to admit that some of them were very good points. But that still didn&#39;t change their worries.<br />
It was not until after they were back in the privacy of their car that the topic arose again.<br />
&quot;What do you think?&quot; they asked each other, almost in unison.<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; admitted William, staring out over the steering wheel. &quot;Whenever the secret does become public, it would be for the best if we control when and how. Yet just because the existence of weres does become public knowledge doesn&#39;t mean we have to confirm or deny we are proud members of the community.&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m worried about the boys. Especially Eric,&quot; confessed Martha, staring at her husband. &quot;After everything he&#39;s been through, he&#39;s so happy now with Julie.&quot;<br />
&quot;As long as they don&#39;t do anything that attracts attention, like winning multiple gold medals for swimming in the Olympics, were-mers can hide easier than most of the other varieties,&quot; William realized, while turning to look at her. &quot;But why hide? Nate loves being a werewolf, and although I wish I gained mine under better circumstances, we&#39;ve both become quite comfortable with our fursonas.&quot;<br />
&quot;True. I can&#39;t picture being anything other than a werecat,&quot; admitted Martha, &quot;but when the secret is revealed, will everyone else accept us?&quot;<br />
&quot;I wish I knew,&quot; was her husband&#39;s only response. &quot;After all, we&#39;ve both seen how some people treat others just because they&#39;re different than them on all kinds of major issues like skin color and religious or sexual preferences; let alone minor stuff like say... preferring the Mets over the Yankees,&quot; he added, not mentioning that their son Eric was bullied back in Minnesota just because he preferred to be smart than athletic.<br />
&quot;I know there&#39;s no specific timetable for it at the moment, but when the secret is revealed, does this mean we can be furry in public whenever we want to?&quot; wondered his wife.<br />
&quot;Honestly? I was a bit unclear on that point, but it doesn&#39;t make any sense to me to reveal you&#39;re different and then continue to hide that difference,&quot; he added, to which Martha nodded in agreement.<br />
&quot;But if the rest of the world does accept weres, would you want to be one 24/7, even at school after you get your recertification?&quot; asked William, even as he privately considered the possibility of never having to be anything other than a werefox ever again.<br />
&quot;Want to be, yes. Maybe it&#39;s because we haven&#39;t been weres as long as others have, but inside me right now there&#39;s kind of a thrill over the thought of my inner feline being released and not having to stay hidden any more. Every time I do change, I love being what I&#39;ve come to consider the <i>real</i> me, and hate having to resume how you see me now,&quot; Martha added, pointing out that they were both dressed and looking like normal human beings.<br />
&quot;I know the feeling,&quot; admitted William. &quot;Who knows? Maybe it&#39;d start a new trend in the fashion industry. Tasteful attire for the furry set.&quot;<br />
His wife gave him a slight smile at that thought before asking, &quot;Yet would the school let me display my fursona? After all, I&#39;ll be teaching elementary students, and a naturally born were doesn&#39;t have their first transformation until after they&#39;ve turned 14 when puberty starts. It&#39;d be a different story for you in college, and maybe even at the high school level, but what about the normal students? Regardless of what grade they&#39;re in, would they feel pressured to join were society, or be mistreated by weres because they are normals?&quot; wondered Martha.<br />
William Anderson just stared at his wife for a long time thinking about her question, but the only answer he could give her was, &quot;I hope not. I&#39;d like to think that we&#39;re better than that, but you heard some of the people in there. They&#39;re worried about not only doing this, but what might happen if it goes against us.&quot;<br />
&quot;Can you blame them? I had enough reservations when we first moved here and Samantha told us that somebody had to become a were to comply with the town&#39;s Mandatory Were Law. As much as I love my new life now, I wasn&#39;t too crazy about that being mandatory back then.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, and that rogue were-vixen changing me to make me her mate,&quot; remembered William. &quot;Then again, I doubt the town would keep the Mandatory Were Law, let alone a lot of the other rules and regulations concerning us, once weres are revealed to the world.&quot;<br />
&quot;Then what about all the people who joined because of that law?&quot; asked Martha. &quot;Hopefully they&#39;ve come to love being their new selves like we do, but it&#39;s not as if the town gave them much of a choice before now. What if one of them decides to sue for some reason?&quot;<br />
&quot;Would they?&quot; asked William in return.<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know. There&#39;s too many variables as it is. But if Samantha had come to us and just said, <i>Oh, by the way. Most of the town&#39;s population are actually were beings, would you like to join?</i> Would you have done so?&quot;<br />
&quot;I seriously doubt it back then,&quot; confessed William. &quot;Maybe after I saw how much Nate enjoys being a werewolf, but I wouldn&#39;t have done so without you, let alone both of us agreeing on which were to be.&quot;*2<br />
&quot;Well, I do know one thing. These issues aren&#39;t going to resolve themselves overnight.&quot;<br />
&quot;All I hope for is that when they do, they&#39;re resolved for the better,&quot; observed William, before starting the car and heading for home.<br />
______________________________________<br />
*Barring anything unforeseen like cancer or a fatal accident, the average were&#39;s lifespan is almost 400 years.<br />
*2) Like the Earth 2 William and Martha Anderson did when they became a happily married werefox couple and yes, to answer some of the private inquiries I have received over the past months, I am seriously considering reviving that series! If, when, and how remain to be seen though.—tmw.</p>
