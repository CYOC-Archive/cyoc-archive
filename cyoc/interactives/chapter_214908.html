<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Four hours pass by, Darren lets out a groan and leans back in his chair, “man, I hate paperwork,” he grumbles to himself, “this is my least favourite part of my job.” The man turns to look at his family portrait, “it would be nice to be a kid again, at least for a night,” he says to himself, “hmm… well, there IS a way to become a kid again. But how should I do it? Jeff is not aware that I have the Chronivac-App, he know that I have no son, turning myself back into a kid would not be wise, but I could simply change my appearance. I’ll just tell Jeff that I too have been kidnapped by “Darren” and take it from there.” Darren nods, liking the idea, he grins, “I could have some fun with Jeff, it has been a while since I played some video games or watched a movie. I could also make Jeff submissive and myself more dominant, I’m interested to see what might happen.”<br />
<br />
Darren pulls out his phone, he opens the Chronivac-App and selects his file, “now, if I remember correctly, my first ejaculation happened when I was 12, I was a year early than average,” he says to himself. The man starts to edit his stats, first he changes his age from 40 to 12, he changes his hair colour from silver-grey to blond, his eyes from ice-blue to brown. He then changes his height to 4’3’’ and his weight to 110lbs, he also changes his penis to 3 inches when flaccid and 4 inches when erect. Darren then checks the percentage of his dominance, he notices that it is at 40%, with a grin he changes it to 100%. The man looks over the changes, he licks his lips, ‘I can’t wait to have the body of a child again,’ he thinks to himself, ‘I won’t miss my muscles, because I will have a pretty athletic body, normal for a 12 year old’. He then opens Jeffs file and simply changes Jeff’s dominance into submissive and increases the percentage from 60% to 100%. Darren grins, he then confirms the changes. He had set Jeff’s change to happen instantly and his own to take an hour, so that he can enjoy and watch as he becomes younger, Darren also set the Chronivac to change his clothes into a more suitable 12-year-old’s outfit.<br />
<br />
After confirming the settings, Darren feels a weird tingle, like a pins and needles sensation, run through his whole body, from the tips of his toes to the tips of his hair on his head, causing the man to shiver a little. Darren walks over to full length mirror, wanting to watch himself transform, the first thing the man notices is that he already look younger. Darren watches in amazement as all of his wrinkles slowly smooth out, and his skin tone starting to look more healthy. When Darren looks about 16, the former grown up starts to feel himself shrink. Darren smiles wide when he watches his Adam’s apple slowly shrink away, his hair has become a nice bright blond and his eyes have become brown. He watches as all of his muscles shrink, making his arms and legs look more like an average 12 year old’s. Darren’s clothes are the last to change as they become a cool 12-year-old’s outfit: blue t-shirt with white tripes, a blue jeans, black socks with smiley faces, his shoes become slippers designed to look like Pikachu. The 12-year-old old boy, who a few moments ago had been a 40-year-old man, grins, “man, I look so cool,” he says, he then giggles, “man, I did miss my boyish voice”. Darren turns around in front of the mirror, checking himself out, “I think I’ll go and see what Jeff is up to,” he says to himself and starts to walk out of the study, “I wonder if he has become a nervous submissive teen. Hehe… I’ll have so much fun with him!”<br />
<br />
Darren has set the transformation to last 24 hours, he also saved the setting, in case he should decide to become the kid again. “If only I could stay a kid for ever,” he mumbles as he walks down the stairs which lead to the basement, “but, sadly… I can’t. At least I can be a kid whenever I have no “missions” to do.”<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Jeff is sitting in the cinema, the teen feels a strange tingle in his head and a weird feeling of nervousness grow in him, ‘Darren does seem kind,’ he thinks to himself, ‘but… something about him makes me feel so nervous. Man, I wish I weren’t so submissive, good thing he doesn’t know, who knows what he might do if he knew!’<br />
<br />
When Darren enters the cinema, he spots Jeff sitting on a beanbag, the young “boy” grins to himself, “hey there,” he calls out, “didn’t know we had a guest!”<br />
<br />
Jeff lets out a squeak of surprise and jumps a little when he hears a young boy’s voice coming from behind him. The teen quickly turns around and is surprised to see a 12-year-old boy standing in the door, grinning. “W-who are you,” Jeff asks, something about this boy feels off, but the teen can’t put a finger on it.<br />
<br />
“My name is Jake,” Darren says, “I live here with Darren.”<br />
<br />
“I… I’m Jeff,” Jeff says, “wh-what do you mean? He… he said he had no k-kids… and y-you don’t look related to him.”<br />
<br />
Darren grins inwardly when he senses Jeff’s nervousness, ‘hehe looks like it worked,’ he thinks to himself. The “boy” walks up to Jeff, “nah, I am not related to Darren,” he says, “let’s just say, he took me from somewhere and since then I have be living with him.”<br />
<br />
Jeff’s eyes widen, “d-did he kidnap you t-too?”<br />
<br />
“Well,” Darren continues his lie, “to be honest: yes, he did. BUT over the course of weeks we started to kinda bond and I decided to stay with him. Do you mind if I sat next to you?”<br />
<br />
“Um… n-no I don’t mind,” Jeff says, ‘why am I feeling so nervous in his presence,’ he thinks to himself. Darren/”Jake” sits down beside Jeff, smiling up at the teen, “wh-why decide to stay? What about y-your family,” Jeff asks.<br />
<br />
Darren shrugs, “I don’t really care,” he says, “Darren is way more cooler than my boring family. I wanna be a spy like Darren one day, he promised he’ll train me into becoming one!”<br />
<br />
“Oh…,” Jeff says, “D-Darren is cool… I guess… b-but I dunno how I feel… I mean… th-this place is amazing, b-but I do miss my family.”<br />
<br />
Darren/”Jake” smiles, “you shouldn’t think about your parents. Escaping is also out of the question, so just accept that… for now… this is your home,” he says.<br />
<br />
Jeff turns his head away, his nervousness growing, ‘man, what is wrong with me,’ he asks himself.<br />
<br />
Darren/”Jake” grins, “am I making you nervous, Jeff,” he asks.<br />
<br />
Jeff nods, “y-you actually do,” he says, “I… I don’t know why though. S-something about you… makes me feel extremely nervous”.<br />
<br />
Darren/”Jake” grins, “really,” he asks, “hehe… it kinda makes you look cute,” Jeff blushes. Darren leans closer to Jeff, grinning at the teen, “if you do as I say, we could have lots of fun together. Don’t worry… Darren will never know”.<br />
<br />
Jeff gulps, normally he would have told the boy not to be so freaky, instead Jeff starts to feel even more uncomfortable, he even starts to sweat. The way the boy is looking at him, causes Jeff to feel as if he were merely just a toy, or robot that is programmed to follow the boy’s every command, before Jeff can stop himself, he simply says, “o-okay”.</p>
