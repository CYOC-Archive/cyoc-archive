<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Park&#39;s edits to the book had almost instant results.  Mark was on his way home when a wave of energy washed over him.  As soon as he got home, he put on his workout clothes and went to the gym. He felt strong throughout his workout and left the gym feeling great.  As the week progressed, Mark felt that every workout was amazing.  He was adding weight and reps to almost every exercise and was amazed to find he had put on 5 lbs in the week after his night with Park.  He thought maybe it was water weight or a little fat, but his waist measurement was the same and he wasn&#39;t looking puffy.  At the end of the second week, Mark&#39;s clothes and shoes were becoming tight.  He took a pair of John&#39;s size 28s and smiled when he realized they fit comfortably.  He had gained about 13 pounds and noticed that he was closer to John&#39;s height.  John also took notice.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, are you wearing my shoes?&quot;  John asked when he saw that Mark had on his old sneakers. <br />
&quot;Yeah bro, you were right about those 26s being small,&quot; Mark replied, &quot;these 28s feel much better.&quot;<br />
<br />
By the end of the third week, Mark was staring to borrow John&#39;s clothes.  Mark had ripped several of his own tees shirts that were now simply too small for him. He had started walking around the apartment naked too, showing John that he was catching up.  By the end of the first month, Mark was standing 7&#39;10&quot; and looking John eye to eye.  Mark weighed in at 446 pounds, just 5 pounds less than John&#39;s 451, and his dick matched John&#39;s 20 inches. <br />
<br />
At the end of the month, Mark ran into Park at the gym and asked him on a date that weekend.  Park noticed that Mark&#39;s muscles were looking much fuller and smiled when he realized Mark already matched John in size. It didn&#39;t escape Mark&#39;s attention that Park was having his own growth spurt, he noticed Park seemed a little taller and his muscle looked a little bigger. The chemistry between the 2 studs was amazing. Their growing dicks were instantly hard the moments they would kiss and stayed that way through their marathon sex sessions.  <br />
<br />
 Park had gained about 2 inches and was standing a respectable 7&#39;4.&quot;  He now weighed 362 pounds and his dick was over 18 inches.  At his size, he was becoming big by Korean standards and simply towered over other men. He loved how tiny Patrick and other non-Asian men looked next to his huge body. But he also loved how small he felt next to Mark.<br />
<br />
After 6 weeks of growth, Mark thought he was taller than John.  He knew that at over 460, he outweighed him and the size 28 sneakers were uncomfortably small. After a couple of more weeks, he knew he was bigger than John in every way. Mark&#39;s workouts were phenomenal.  He was pushing way more weight than he had ever before and was stronger than John on every exercise. When they got home from the gym one afternoon and were getting out of their gym clothes, Mark asked for John &quot;hey little bother, can you give me a hand?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, what do you want?&quot; John replied.<br />
<br />
Mark grinned as he handed John a pencil. &quot; Need you to mark my height.&quot; Mark said as he stood against the wall. Both brothers were shirtless and bare foot, and, as John approached the 473 pound Mark, it was clear that Mark was the bigger brother in all respects. After John marked his height, Mark put the measuring tape on the wall.  <br />
<br />
&quot;A little over 8 feet with size 30 feet. What do you think of that little brother?&quot; Mark felt his big dick stir as he taunted his smaller brother.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Good for you, but don&#39;t get too cocky. I think I am growing too.&quot; John replied.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, let&#39;s see.  Get against the wall.&quot; Mark ordered.<br />
<br />
As John stood against the wall, Mark stood directly in front of him to emphasize his superior size.  When he made the mark, John step aside.  Mark wrote his name next to the higher mark and wrote John&#39;s next to the lower, then he measured.<br />
<br />
&quot; You are right bro,  you gained a whole 1/2 of an inch.  You are 7&#39;10.5&quot; now.  Good for you.&quot; Mark smiled. &quot;Did I tell you my dick is 21 inches now?  I measured it last night. Do you think your little dick grew any?&quot;<br />
<br />
John ignored the question as he closed the door to his room.<br />
<br />
Mark&#39;s incredible growth spurt continued.  Not only was he getting taller, his muscles were growing faster than ever. He loved adding extra 45 lbs plates to the bar when John finished a set and it was his turn.  &quot;If I get much stronger, I might have to find a new workout partner little brother.&quot; Mark would taunt knowing that there was no one at the gym besides John that could even come close to keeping up with him.  <br />
<br />
Mark and Park continued dating.  Both loved how the other&#39;s body was growing.  Mark liked that he had a bottom that was big enough to handle his huge cock and match his stamina in bed. By the end of the 3rd month, Park was really becoming a big man.  He then stood at 7&#39;8,&quot; wore a size 26 shoe, and weighed 405 lbs.  John and Mark were the only men bigger than him at the gym.<br />
<br />
At about 13 weeks of growth,  Mark again asked John to help measure.  8&#39;2&#39;&#39; was Mark&#39;s new height.  &quot;Now your turn&quot; Mark Said. John stood  against the wall and Mark drew a line a little above John&#39;s previous mark.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like you grew a little too little brother.&quot; Mark said as he put the measuring tape on the wall, &quot;seven feet ten and 3/4 an inches. A whole 1/4 of an inch. Did you put on any muscle?  Still in your little size 28s?&quot; Mark said with a smile as he put his size 32 foot next to John&#39;s smaller foot. John had gained a little muscle, and weighed 460. But that was starting to pale in comparison to Mark&#39;s massive frame, now 500 lbs of hard muscle.   &quot;Oh, and its 22 inches in case you were wondering,&quot; Mark said as he grab his huge package.  &quot;I bet it is bigger hanging soft than yours is hard. By the way, my boyfriend is coming over later.  Don&#39;t give him any shit.&quot;<br />
<br />
That evening, John answered the door when Park arrived. He was surprised to see such a big man at the door.   John was used to towering over most people, and it was odd for him not to have to look down to say hello.  Intimidated by Mark&#39;s new size, John was on his best behavior as he welcomed Park.  Mark greeted Park as he and John walked into the living room.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Hi baby, are you still growing too?&quot; Mark said not being able to pass up the opportunity to goad John.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I think so,  I am pretty sure I am over 7&#39;8&quot; now and these shoes are getting tight.&quot; Park replied.  <br />
<br />
&quot;What are those, 26s? I am sure John can lend you some 28s if you need them.&quot; Mark continued, &quot;Why don&#39;t you step up to our wall growth chart here and I will measure you.&quot; <br />
<br />
Park did as he was told and Mark drew a line only a couple of inches below John&#39;s most recent mark.  &quot;Seven feet and 8 and 1/4 inches. That makes over 6 inches in the last 3 months or so. You keep growing at that rate you will be taller than my little brother in no time.&quot;<br />
<br />
The last remark was more than John could take,  he excused himself and left the house for the evening.  When the door shut behind him, Mark let out a chuckle.  <br />
<br />
&quot;He seems really nice,  why are picking on him so hard?&quot; Park asked<br />
<br />
&quot;He is only nice because he is scared of me and you are big enough not to be intimidated. He only respects size.&quot; Mark said and then chuckled &quot;He is probably going out to lord his size over smaller men at some bar and find some tiny girl that will swoon over how big his dick is. He ego is that fragile.&quot;<br />
<br />
Over the next month Park did grow to a size 28, but bought his own rather than borrow John&#39;s.  He grew 2 more inches and gained 40 pounds of muscle, making him 7&#39;10&quot; and 445.  Mark was amazed at the amount of muscle Park was packing on and loved how big and muscular his ass had become. <br />
<br />
Park was hanging out at Mark and John, when Mark decided it was time for everyone to get measured. Mark told John to stand up first and made sure his armpit was in John&#39;s face as he drew the pencil mark with John&#39;s name, &quot;another quarter of an inch, good job little bro you are 7&#39;11&quot; now. Still stuck at 460 though?&quot;  Mark asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes asshole, still 460.&quot; John replied turning a little red.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay baby, your turn.&quot; Mark said to Park.  Mark let out a little whistle as he noticed how much higher Park&#39;s mark was, &quot;seven feet ten and 1/2 inches.  I thought you were getting close to John.  That&#39;s about 2 and 1/4 inches in just under 5 weeks.  You are really a big man now, not to mention that 20 inch salami between your legs.&quot;  Mark teased and Park blushed.  &quot;Your dick is as big as my baby brother&#39;s legendary cock. Now my turn.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark&#39;s dick became fully hard when he saw his name next to the mark that measured 8&#39;4.&quot;  &quot;I am really in elite status now at 530 pounds and that height. I bet 23 inches is getting close to a record for dick size too.&quot; Mark bragged, &quot;John, do you know any store that stock size 34 shoes?  I think they usually stop at 32s.&quot;<br />
<br />
Even though he had a little height and weight on Park, John was starting to feel small and had to go out again.  Mark just smiled.  He knew he was being hard on John, but he also knew John had been and would be much worse if he had the size advantage. <br />
<br />
Later that week,  Mark went to Park&#39;s house.  Park, already naked, greeted him with a sly smile and told Mark to take his clothes off.  Park&#39;s 20 inch dick was already hard but almost looked small compared to the 20 inches of soft meat hanging between Mark&#39;s legs. Park led Mark toward the back of the house, but stopped in front of the giant full length mirror in the hall.  &quot;I have a surprise for you. I want you to understand how truly huge you have become.&quot; Park said, &quot;look, this huge ass mirror can&#39;t even cope with your size.&quot; Park to Mark&#39;s hand and led him to the bedroom. There on the end of the 10&#39;x10&#39; Korean Emperor sized bed, was little Patrick and his Latin friend Diego.  Both of the little men were only 5&#39;4&quot; and both weighed less that 110 pounds. Their naked bodies looked tiny.  As mark entered the room, the little men stood up and approached.  &quot;You may touch him,&quot; Park granted them permission. They only came up to Mark&#39;s waist and his rapidly expanding cock was as long as their arms.  The little men began to kiss and lick Mark&#39;s giant muscles. The Patrick and Diego were dwarfed by Mark&#39;s huge thighs which were thicker than the little men&#39;s torsos. The comparison made both Mark and Park&#39;s dicks start leaking pre. When Diego buried his face under Mark&#39;s balls, his head was completely covered by the big Korean man&#39;s sac. Park told Mark to lie back on the bed, and then ordered the littles to work on Mark&#39;s giant size 34 feet.  As the little men approached, it was clear that Mark&#39;s foot could cover their entire torsos.  Park watched lustfully as the little men worked on Mark&#39;s feet as he groaned. Park grabbed Mark&#39;s massive cock and began working it with his hands and licking the head until he was rewarded with a massive cumshot.  The first volley hit the wall behind the bed and then covered Mark&#39;s torso with thick cream.  Park order the little men to clean it up. The complied gleefully and then left smiling and full of cum. &quot;You are the best boyfriend in the world,&quot; Mark said as he kissed Park passionately.  Mark&#39;s cock quickly reinflated and Park whispered in his ear, &quot;fuck me now.&quot;<br />
<br />
At the end of the 5 month, Park was loving how heavy and strong his muscle felt. He could feel them ripple with even the slightest movement.  Compared to most of the world, he was giant and he loved it. But he loved more how small his titanic boyfriend made him feel.  Park arrived at Mark and John&#39;s, to be greeted by John.  Park smiled when he realized that John&#39;s eyes were a little below his and that he definitely had the size advantage.  Mark came out of the bedroom and seeing Park next to John said, &quot;I think it is time for some measurements.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;John, you are up first.&quot; Mark said as he pushed John against the wall being sure to step of his feet a little.  &quot;Sorry, I am not quite used to these big ass feet yet. Well, you are exactly where you were last time, 7 feet 11 inches.  Still 460?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah&quot; John grumbled.<br />
<br />
Park was already against the wall without being told.  Mark drew the line and smiled. &quot;So the tape says eight feet, my baby is a big ass man.&quot; Mark said. &quot; How much do you weigh now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;480 and size 30 feet&quot; Park answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;And a 21 inch dick,&quot; Mark added with a smile.<br />
<br />
John sat fuming as the bigger men talked.<br />
<br />
Park gleefully marked Mark&#39;s height. &quot;8 feet and 6 inches, baby. This is amazing, we have both grown 10 inches in like five months! How much do you weigh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;552 pounds of rock hard muscle,&quot; Mark said with a cheesy smile as he pulled a double bicep pose.<br />
<br />
&quot;And size 36 feet and a 24 inch dick.&quot; Park added, &quot;You must be one of the biggest men in the world.&quot;<br />
<br />
John could take anymore and left without saying a word.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I love that I am so much bigger than most men, but still feel small next to you&quot; Park said to Mark.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you,&quot; Mark said, &quot;Now get those clothes off.&quot;<br />
<br />
Park and Mark began working out together.  Over time, Park was able to get to 500 lbs with Mark&#39;s encouragement. Mark added another 10 pounds of muscle to his immense frame.  The couple were the envy of the gym and all the men there either wanted to be them or be with them.  Occasionally, the massive couple would let a smaller man or two into their bedroom to worship them.<br />
<br />
John didn&#39;t grow any more and had to content himself with finding other small men to intimidate. But he never gave up the dream of outgrowing his brother again one day. <br />
<br />
When Park and Mark decided to move in together, the book fell out of one the boxes Park packed and onto the street near Mark&#39;s house which John was moving out of.</p>
