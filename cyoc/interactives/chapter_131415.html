<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You went inside tearing up with a bunch of the people inside partying although one of the girls noticed you and saw you hurt. She went quickly to you and asked &quot;Are you ok there girl?&quot; <br />
Thankfully the elf that your brain came from was apparently a decent actor and you decently portrait a scared kid and said &quot;Something went and attacked me. I think when it saw the light of the party though it got scared and ran off.&quot; <br />
An Orc teen who heard laughed and said &quot;Oh something with that bite. Guess it didn&#39;t want to tear anything off... Leave it to me, i&#39;ll get one of the wood cutting axes and that thing&#39;s doomed!&quot; <br />
Then a human guy said &quot;No need, this is the property  of my family. I&#39;ll grab the shotgun and get rid of that danger myself!&quot; <br />
&quot;Young One! You alright?!?&quot; you looked to that voice and saw what seemed like an teenage looking male elf... Although he was probably in his fifties. <br />
You said &quot;This bite hurts...&quot; <br />
The elf said &quot;Gotcha, I&#39;ll get my bow and a few arrows and whatever beast is dead.&quot; A bunch of the party had stopped dancing and observed the three guys who just proclaimed they would go and kill the monster. <br />
The Orc said &quot;Shotgun? Bow? You two are too weak. If you can&#39;t cut it and exchange blows you have no right trying to kill it!&quot; <br />
The human said &quot;This a  matter of providing a safe spot. It is the duty of me the host to clear up this danger! Could someone go bring this young elf to the bathroom and tend to her wound?&quot;<br />
The elf said &quot;I agree with the wound, but the Young One is my family. It is my business to find and kill this beast and I doubt the two of you could even track it!&quot; <br />
<br />
You thought to yourself &quot;Mask god would be able to protect me from that shotgun shells. Those arrows and whatever magic the elf can do... The orc is young, but an ax may be a bit of an issue... It&#39;s also pretty possible that he has a lot more experience fighting than I do...&quot; A girl tapped you on the shoulder and then started leading you to the bathroom. The two of you ended up being alone and as she went for the medicine cabinet you dropped your disguise and morphed into your large monstrous form. You grabbed the poor girl in her mouth as the sound of the young elf&#39;s clothes started ripping. The girl nearly screamed as your incubus dick penetrated through the girl&#39;s clothes and  then you decided to try to drain her age essence to not leave a body. After a second the girl started squirming in ecstasy as your dick drained away her sexual energies while the girl started to shrink and get younger. Smaller and smaller until her body was not able of generating sexual energy where your dick retracted. Then the girl continued to shrink and shrink into a baby, and then a fetus, and then not even a zygote. The only thing left of her was a small damp spot in her clothes. <br />
<br />
The mask said &quot;Alright, time to take her form for now.&quot; You sighed as your form shrunk into that of the female teenager. You felt your breasts as they felt a little odd, but in the end just went to putting on the underwear and clothes... Sadly her pants were ripped. You opened the bathroom door and started to make your way outside quietly, taking note there were about 8 other people partying. <br />
<br />
Almost outside you heard some guy ask &quot;Hey Trish, where&#39;s the young one?&quot; <br />
<br />
You said &quot;Oh her? Just brought her to a bedroom to rest. She&#39;ll probably be fine.&quot; <br />
<br />
The guy got closer and asked &quot;Something happen in the bathroom? Your pants are ripped and where you going anyways?&quot; <br />
<br />
You thought for a second and said &quot;Just getting some fresh air...&quot; <br />
<br />
The guy seemed a bit suspicious and getting closer asked &quot;You ok Trish, your acting a little odd.&quot; <br />
<br />
You opened the door outside and going out said &quot;Just felt a little queasy about that thing... just going out near the house. Should be safe enough there right?&quot; The door closed itself and the guy came out. <br />
<br />
The guy went to you and said &quot;The Young One was attacked right at the pier. This place isn&#39;t safe.&quot; You looked to the door and saw that the windows on either side had the blinds closed, and the door was solid and you couldn&#39;t see through it. the guy asked &quot;What are you looking at?&quot; <br />
<br />
You grinned and said &quot;Yeah... This place isn&#39;t safe. Are we a couple?&quot; <br />
<br />
The guy a bit concerned said &quot;Not really... I mean we&#39;ve known each other since pre-school bu...&quot; Using your actual strength you threw the two of you to the ground and used some of your magic on the guy. The guy moaned a little as his body started spasming and shrinking a little. Fat accumulated on his chest and ass as the guy started turning into a girl, and you let your incubus dick exist and ripped off his pants and underwear as you started to thrust into the new girl&#39;s vagina. She moaned a little as you drained her of some of her energy, but for now you&#39;d let her live. Your form grew and ripped the clothes again. The girl gasped and said &quot;monster... what did you do to the Young...&quot; a realization came to her mind and her voice raised slightly &quot;What happened to Trish!?&quot; <br />
<br />
You said &quot;Oh... I think she&#39;s somewhere in the clothes I took from her. I can do more than just drain your sexual energies. The elf still has a corpse thrown in the lake, I just sucked her dry like a vampire. That girl though I drained her sexually and then I sucked out her age. In the mean time I&#39;m going to let you live for now...&quot; The girl seemed terrified.<br />
<br />
The mask said &quot;Just kill this broad. I hunger&quot;<br />
<br />
You said &quot;Just think of the terror though. Didn&#39;t you say I could enforce my will on whoever I want?&quot; The girl just looked terrified. You supposed only you could hear the mask. The girl seemed to be recovering a bit so you extended your dick into her again. <br />
<br />
She saw and reacted by saying &quot;Not that AgaAAIIII!&quot; as she started to scream as endorphins raced to her mind bringing immense pleasure as her energy was being drained. After a few seconds she seemed rather tired so you just flung her over your shoulder. You were out in the open so you decided to run around the cabin and try to find that orc first. The human would probably be not real threat although he would probably know the area the best, the elf would probably find you rather fast but direct magic and arrows would do little. You really wanted to find that orc fast if only you had a decent way of finding him the quickes-<br />
<br />
&quot;BEAST COME TO ME!!! I&#39;LL CUT YOU DOWN REAL FAST!!!&quot; screamed what probably was the orc. You felt no need to keep him waiting and ran to him where...</p>
