<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Michael was terribly frightened about what Danny was going to make him do. He didn&#39;t want this to happen! The stupid spell backfired, and now he was trapped as Danny&#39;s slave.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please Danny, I&#39;ll do anything. I&#39;m sorry. Just change it back. I don&#39;t want to be your slave&quot;. Danny just chuckled and told Michael to sit on the locker room floor like a dog. Michael&#39;s body sat him down without his control. Danny contemplated his options. Just then the rest of the football team began filing into the locker room. As he was flipping through the old spell book, Danny was struck with inspiration. He smiled a devilish grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright Michael&quot;, he began. &quot;You won&#39;t have to be my slave anymore if you do one thing for me. Deal?&quot;. Michael beamed; &quot;Yes, of course Danny. What is it?&quot;.<br />
<br />
Danny handed Michael a pen and paper; &quot;I want you to examine every member of our football team and write down what you think each persons most unattractive or nasty quality or trait is. As my slave, I am forcing you to be brutally honest. Examine them very closely, using all your senses. Smells, taste, etc...&quot;.<br />
<br />
Michael was frightened and very grossed out, but if he did this he would no longer be a slave. Not like he had a choice. His body was already moving towards the group of football jocks without his will. There a good amount of hulking football players, including Danny. &quot;Hey team! This little twerp has told me he wants to be our slave. His first duty is to examine all of his masters closely to get a good idea of who we are. So let little Michael examine each of you guys from head to toe!&quot;.<br />
<br />
All the football players stripped and stood there naked in front of Michael. Danny grinned and stepped into the front of the line. Michael grimaced inside as he started at Dannny&#39;s feet. He bent down and sniffed and licked Danny&#39;s feet. Gross! They stunk and were really sweaty. He moved up and began to sniff Danny&#39;s huge crotch and examine his member. Working up he made Danny lift up his arms as Michael deeply sniffed each pit. This was horrible! Maybe he had made the wrong deal with Danny!<br />
<br />
He methodically went to each one, sniffing armpits, rubbing hairy chests, smelling crotches, and tasting sweat. It was humiliating and awful, but at least he wouldn&#39;t be a slave forever if he finished.<br />
<br />
When he was finally done he had a list of the nastiest traits on each player. &quot;Are you finished, slave?&quot;, Danny asked. &quot;Yes, master&quot;, he replied. &quot;Read the list to all of us. Were dying to know!&quot;.<br />
<br />
Michael looked down at his list, took a deep breath and began:<br />
&quot;So, the grossest trait of each player is as follows:<br />
Kyle, you have the hairiest ass of the group. It just looks like a big brown rug!<br />
Carlos, your facial hygiene is very bad. Your face is very oily and it is covered in fresh crops of pimples&quot;.<br />
<br />
Carlos turned a shade of red, but Kyle didn&#39;t care and high fived his mates.<br />
<br />
&quot;Danny, your armpits are just exploding with hair! It&#39;s too much. It looks like a caveman&#39;s pit, and <br />
Tyler, your armpits are by far the smelliest. Your body odor is tremendous!<br />
Travis, you need to trim and wash. Your pubic bush is gigantic and incredibly smelly. Its just too much. Also, I noticed that you have a bad case of pubic lice. That&#39;s just nasty, Travis.&quot;<br />
<br />
Travis did indeed blush on that one, His teammates made fun of his crabs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Zeke, you just looks like a gorilla! You are covered head to toe in hair! No one likes that! You have the hairiest chest in school and hair all up and down your back!<br />
Chris, your cock is your nastiest trait! Its all bent and crooked, plus you have all those metal piercings through it! Last, I noticed that your cock just never stops leaking precum. Thats gross, and im sure a pain to keep under control!<br />
Jordan, I could tell that you have a real sweating problem. You are always covered in sweat no matter what, with large stains on your clothing!<br />
Lastly Bob, Your feet are truly nasty. Crooked cracked yellow toenails are always gross, but coupled with the rank foot odor coming from them makes them repulsive!<br />
<br />
Michael was finally done reading off his list. The footballers were all mildly embarassed, but were giddily anticipating what Danny had in store for this little twerp.<br />
<br />
&quot;There, I did it. Release me, Danny, I don&#39;t want to be your slave anymore!&quot;<br />
<br />
Danny laughed; &quot;Oh, I will, just one more thing before I do&quot;. Danny pulled out his spellbook. He thumbed through until he found the right page; &quot;This page describes trading attributes with people, so now, your going to help us out and adopt all those traits you deemed unnatractive, allowing us to grow normal ones. After that, you are free! The catch, however, is, the attribute get stronger when they are traded, so your going to end up hairier, smellier, and whatever else more than us!&quot;<br />
&quot;Noooo!&quot;, Michael cried, but he couldn&#39;t move his body without his master&#39;s approval. Danny began to read the spell, and michael began to cry. He had been tricked. He did&#39;t want to adopt all those nasty features of the football team!<br />
<br />
&quot;First up is Kyle. Now you said he had a very hairy ass. Well, now your the one with the hairy ass!&quot;. Kyle grinned as he felt his ass hairs recede, giving just a normal amount. Michael yelped in digust as he felt thick brown hairs squirming out of his pores on his ass. His hands flew back there. His hands felt his butt cheeks, which were positively furry! He twisted to look in the mirror and his ass was so hairy you could barely see the skin. He grimaced as his asshole twitched as a jungle of hairs sprouted all around that, too.<br />
<br />
Next up was Carlos. He smiled as his face became much less greasy and his pimples disappeared. Michael looked in the mirror as his pores became dark and clogged with oil. His face became dirty and shone with a very oily shine. Next huge red pimples erupted from his skin!<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like it&#39;s my turn&quot;, Danny said as he sauntered over. Danny lifted up his arms, showing off his pits. Michael watched as Danny&#39;s huge pits receded into his skin, leaving just a little bit of brown hair. Michael felt an itching in his armpits. He lilfted his arms just in time to see a huge bush explode from his skin. It kept growing and growing. When it stopped he had a ridiculously bushy crop of pit hair under his arm. Michael had always wanted to grow armpit hair, but not like this!<br />
<br />
Next, Tyler exposed his armpits too. Tyler sniffed one, grimaced, and then felt them tingle. After a few seconds, Tyler sniffed them again. His body odor was gone! Michael felt his pits tingle as his pores readjusted, producing much more body odor. The new bush he had recieved from Danny was perfect for harboring odor causing bacteria, too. Michael snifed his pit and almost gagged. He had horrible BO now!<br />
<br />
Travis was next. His huge smelly pubic bush receded into a normal, trimmed bush. Michael groaned as hair shot out all around his crotch. There was so much and it just stunk. It also itched really really bad. He dig his fingers into the bush but the itching wouldn&#39;t stop. He looked closely and saw he had a horrible pubic lice infestation, like Travis had. Nasty!<br />
<br />
Then, Zeke felt all his body hair pulling into his body, giving him just a treasure trail and a small wisp in the center of his chest. Michael, however, was terrified to see thick brown body hair sprouting out of his chest and all over his back and shoulders. The hair was creating a thick mat on his chest. It was so thick that it covered his torso front and back in one unbroken line!<br />
<br />
Chris was next. He felt his penis returning to a normal shape and, to his anger, his piercings all disappeared. Oh well, Chris thought, he could always get new ones. Michae cried out as his penis sharply bent to a 45 degree angle down the middle. It looked hidious. Also, many metal peircings formed all over his crotch. There was so much, it painfully weighed down his cock, and it clattered when he walked. He also noticed his cock was leaking precum nonstop all over the locker room floor!<br />
<br />
Jordan cheered as his excessive sweating problem was cured, or more accurately, given to Michael. Michael felt his body hair matted down all over his body now by sweat, and his thick pit bushes became damp and even smellier.<br />
<br />
Lastly, Bob&#39;s feet improved. The nails straightened out and became a normal color, and they no longer stunk. Michael felt his nails crack and become crooked, taking on a deep nasty yellow color. The odor they now produced was fierce.<br />
<br />
The changes were complete. The football team cheered and clapped each others back; they were happy, because they had all improved their bodies in some way. Michael, however, slumped to the floor and wept. his body was ruined! He was in a nasty, deformed, sweaty, stinky body! No one would want him ever again! He had to get the spell book and change this back!<br />
<br />
Danny walked over to him and read a spell. Michael felt something in his head hange; he was no longer Danny&#39;s slave. &quot;Michael, your no longer a slave, but those changes are permanent. Think of it as punishment for trying to use the spellbook on me!&quot;.<br />
<br />
Michael crumbled to the floor and cried in despair, as Danny closed the spelbook, laughed, and walked away.</p>
