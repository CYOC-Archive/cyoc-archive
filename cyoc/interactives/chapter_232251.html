<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">... An age swapping magic. And the recipients of that magic would be 8 year old Mitch and 38 year old Adrian. They were asleep when the magic hit, so needless to say, they would be in for quite the surprise when they woke up.<br />
<br />
Adrian was wearing a wife beater and some boxers as he slept with his husband. When the magic hit him, Adrian jerked up, knocking the covers off of him. Both he and Eric remained asleep however, as his body started to transform. As for Mitch, he was wearing footsie pajamas and was sleeping messily when he was hit. Jerking up as well, the boy&#39;s limbs laid back down all in different positions, as his changes were already underway. The tight PJs were already starting to strain. His feet were the first to open from its confines as they grew bigger and older. They fattened up and grew out hairs on his toes. His legs followed suit, ripping the bottom half of his no longer footsies. Each leg elongated and fattened up. An immense amount of body hair was growing as his legs and feet were getting quite chubby. His upper half was still that of an eight year old kid however. Adrian was likewise going through his own changes. His feet were shrinking and getting more child like. They would no longer be able to support his adult legs which were likewise shrinking. His hard earned muscles collapsed as his legs shrunk down. His adult head slid off the pillows as his boxers started to feel loose.<br />
<br />
Back at Mitch, his entire upper body was no changing. His belly expanded and ripped off the top of his clothes. His arms followed suit and now the boy was in nothing but his underwear which were straining from his new proportions. He absentmindedly scratched his growing belly which was getting tubby. His upper body hair grew exponentially and matched his lower half. The boy was definitely turning into an slightly overweight adult. &quot;Hmph!&quot; Mitch let out a grunt in his sleep as he jerked up again. The friction caused his undies to snap, leaving him fully naked. His pelvis expanded to match the rest of his body as his face became older and chubbier as well. His dirty blond hair shortened into a crew cut as as five o&#39;clock shadow of dirty blond hair formed on his face. His Adam&#39;s Apple jutted out to make way for a much deeper voice. The boy was now basically an adult, the only exception being his penis which was still tiny. It soon started to twitch. Adrian&#39;s upper body was the next to go. His arm muscles contracted as his upper body muscles followed suit. His massive pecs became flat and flabby as he ten pack sunk back into his stomach pack by pack. He scratched at it as his hands got smaller. He laid down there with his clothes draped very loosely over his body. His face regressed into that of a kid. &quot;Mmm... Ughhh...&quot; Adrian murmured in his sleep with a much higher pitched voice as his Adam&#39;s Apple sunk back into his neck. The man now looked like a kid with the exception of the bulge in his pants. His erect dick was sticking out from his boxers as it started to twitch.<br />
<br />
With Mitch, his balls dropped into the size of baseballs as his pubic hair grew. His penis twitched like crazy as it grew and grew into the cock of a man in his thirties. It slowly got erect as it thickened into the width of a beer can. It stopped growing at about ten inches as it continued to twitch. &quot;Ugh... Hmph!&quot; Mitch let out a grunt in his much deeper voice as he ejaculated for the first time. The spurts of cum went over his hairy body and face. His body certainly was going to be all crusty when he woke up. His dick then softened and laid to rest on his ball sack at five inches. The magic was finished with Mitch as the eight year old boy was now a 38 year old 255 pound man. As for Adrian, his penis jerked up several times and then begin to shrink back into his boxers. His balls got smaller as he lost all his pubic hair. His dick lost most length and width as it sunk back fully into his boxers. &quot;Mmm... Ugh...&quot; Adrian let out a moan again as he could no longer contain his smaller bladder. He pissed himself, staining his boxers and the bed sheets. After a few seconds, his wiener stopped peeing and the 38 year old muscle man was now a weak, scrawny 8 year old boy. The age swapping magic had done its job.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm... Hmmm...&quot; Adrian moaned as he felt himself start to wake up. He felt all groggy and weird. It felt like he was naked as he moved in bed. He rubbed his eyes, unaware that his hands were smaller. He went to move off the bed, his eyes still half closed. He still felt weird. His boxers felt loose and one strap from his shirt felt like it was dangling off his body. And what was weirder was that his feet no longer touched the ground. &quot;What is going on?&quot; he thought as he jumped off the bed. This caused his boxers to fall down and he realized part of the uncomfortable feeling was that his boxers were wet. He opened his eyes and looked down to see his boxers pooled down on the floor, tiny toes sticking out from them. &quot;Heh... That&#39;s so weird...&quot; Adrian said to himself as he rubbed his eyes, not realizing the sound of his voice was different. He was wide awake now as he still saw his boxers on the floor, still saw his feet tiny. He looked around and saw everything was bigger. It was like he was smaller. He touched his body and it was indeed smaller. It was if he had shrunk. In disbelief he stepped out of his boxers and walked over to the mirror. When he looked back, the tall, muscular man he went to sleep with was gone. In its place was a young boy wearing his wife beater which was hanging half off the body. He went to touch the mirror and the tiny hand matched his own, Adrian fully realized the child in front of him was HIM. &quot;AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!&quot; <br />
<br />
Mitch heard the scream all the way from his room, but between the fact that he was still sleeping and that the scream was far away, it only barely woke him up. &quot;Mmm... What is it?&quot; he groggily said, still too asleep to notice his voice was much deeper now. He rubbed his eyes. His body felt weird to say the least. He felt super heavy and despite going to bed warm and toasty, his entire body felt cold. He scratched his belly as he moved to get out of bed and felt something very flaky all over his body. &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; he wondered as he got out of bed. &quot;Whoa!&quot; Or tried to at least as he tripped and fell. &quot;Ow!&quot; he said, still unaware of the change in his voice. It was just getting stranger. Now it was like his bed had gotten lower. He pushed himself up and stretched, rubbing his eyes. &quot;Huh?&quot; As he looked around the strangeness continued. His room looked much smaller now. He rubbed his eyes again and finally noticed his hands. &quot;What happened to my hands?!&quot; Then his voice. &quot;What happened to my voice?!&quot; He then looked down. &quot;Muh... My wiener!&quot; He noticed his huge dick sticking straight out. &quot;It&#39;s ginormous!&quot; Everything about his body was bigger. He left his room and headed towards the bathroom. With some trepidation, he went inside and towards the mirror. &quot;Whoa!&quot; And what stared at him was not the eight year old boy he went to bed as, but a monster of a man. He was fat. He was hairy. He was huge. He touched his body all over and the man in the reflection did the same things. &quot;This is...&quot; Mitch said as he placed his hands on the mirror. The man did the same. &quot;Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa! What the fuck?!&quot; Eric yelled as he was woken up buy a loud pitched yell. He looked around and saw who the scream had came from. Staring right at him was a young boy wearing a wife beater which looked comically loose on him. &quot;What the fuck?! Who are you kid?!&quot; &quot;Eric... Eric...&quot; the boy said. &quot;How... How do you know my name?&quot; &quot;Eric... Eric, its me! Adrian!&quot; &quot;This isn&#39;t funny. Who are you really kid? Why are you in my room with my husbands shirt?&quot; &quot;I&#39;m telling you, its me Err!&quot; the boy replied back using a nickname only Adrian used. &quot;What? You...&quot; Eric looked closely and the kid did look familiar. He looked like Adrian did as a child. &quot;Aide? That&#39;s really you?&quot; &quot;Yes!&quot; Eric looked at the kid in disbelief. &quot;Oh my god! Oh my fucking god! Adrian! What the fuck happened?!&quot; &quot;I don&#39;t know! I just woke up like this!&quot; &quot;Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!&quot; Both Eric and Adrian heard a loud, deep yell from the bathroom. They didn&#39;t recognize the voice so they ran to the room in question, Adrian barely  keeping his shirt on in his regressed form.<br />
<br />
As soon as Mitch stopped yelling, he heard footsteps running towards the bathroom. He looked back as his Dad Eric and some kid he never saw before came into view. They both did a double take as they saw the naked man in front of them. &quot;What the...??&quot; was all Eric could say. &quot;Dad?&quot; Mitch said. Eric looked at him for a bit and then his eyes lit up in recognition. &quot;My god... Mitch? Mitch, sweetie, is that you?&quot; &quot;Y... Yeah... Um... who&#39;s...&quot; &quot;Oh! Um... Its me kiddo...&quot; It was Mitch&#39;s turn to stare, but eventually came to the right conclusion. &quot;Daddy? Daddy Adrian?&quot; &quot;Y... Yeah...&quot; The two stared at each other for a bit. &quot;AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!&quot; Now they both screamed. &quot;Oh god! Oh my fucking god!&quot; Adrian yelled out. &quot;Dad? Daddy?&quot; Mitch said in near tears. &quot;What&#39;s going on? I&#39;m scared. &quot;Okay... Okay you two. You need to calm down,&quot; Eric tried to say. &quot;Calm down?! I&#39;m a freaking kid again! And Mitch is some bear! I mean look at the cock of his, man! &quot;I get it! I get it, but you still need to calm down. You may be a kid, but you are still an adult here. You are still this man&#39;s father.&quot; &quot;Okay...&quot; Adrian said, taking several breaths. &quot;I&#39;m... I&#39;m sorry Mitch... I know this is a lot, but we&#39;ll get through this together.&quot; &quot;Sniffle.... Oh... Okay...&quot;<br />
<br />
After (mostly) calming down Mitch, the three went into the living room. &quot;So we need to figure out how this happened?&quot; Eric said. &quot;Any ideas?&quot; &quot;None.&quot; Adrian said. We haven&#39;t done anything differently lately.&quot; &quot;Me neither!&quot; Mitch added. &quot;Are you sure Mitchy? No strangers asked or did anything for you?&quot; Eric asked. &quot;Nope! You told me not to talk to strangers, remember?&quot; &quot;That we did,&quot; Adrian added. &quot;So what then? Why would I turn into like, I don&#39;t know, a ten year old kid, I guess?&quot; &quot;Ten years... No...&quot; &quot;Did you figure something out, Dad?&quot; &quot;Not really, but...&quot; &quot;Spit it out man!&quot; &quot;Okay, um... I think you might be an eight year old.&quot; &quot;Why do you... Oh my god...&quot; &quot;Daddy?&quot; &quot;Mitch... I think you might be a 38 year old.&quot; &quot;What? No way!&quot; Mitch gasped. &quot;We switched ages!!&quot; They both shouted out. &quot;Well, now that we have that figured out... What next?&quot; Adrian said. &quot;Good question... Well I don&#39;t think we can figure this out right now. Let&#39;s get changed and have some breakfast first. Get our minds fully working.&quot; Eric suggested. &quot;Good idea... And take a shower. Can&#39;t believe I pissed myself.&quot; &quot;Me too... but why is my body all crusty?&quot; &quot;Oh... Um...&quot; Eric and Adrian said in unison, realizing they were going to have to tell their eight year old child about erections and ejaculations. <br />
<br />
This was going to be a long day indeed...</p>
