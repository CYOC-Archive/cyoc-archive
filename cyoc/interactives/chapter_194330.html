<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I haven&#39;t seen them today,&quot; Fiia shrugged behind the counter, &quot;but I&#39;m not worried yet. The last time your brother was here, we wouldn&#39;t see either of them for days at a time. Lars is quite capable. Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll alert the tribe to be on the lookout and will make sure you&#39;re updated as soon as they come up for air again. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the revontulet is brighter tonight because of them&quot; She winked. &quot;Congratulations, by the way. Santa&#39;s Team!&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric nodded and blinked. News spreads like wildfire up here! He grinned despite himself and laughed. &quot;Thanks! To be honest it hasn&#39;t fully hit me yet. It still feels like a dream!&quot;<br />
<br />
Clyde laughed and ruffled the fur between his antlers supportively, beaming with pride. &quot;He&#39;s very impressive, no?&quot;<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
Eric stood staring at his reflection, realizing it was the first time he&#39;d really taken himself in since the final transformation. His eyes danced across his features. He&#39;d never really liked his appearance growing up, to be honest. He hated the way his thick glasses had framed his face and had always been self conscious about his gangly frame. It&#39;s probably why he had lost himself so deeply in books and fantasy, living vicariously through the characters he read about or created in his mind or with his friends at the table.<br />
<br />
But this was different. For all of his worries about how he&#39;d end up looking, he was truly proud of his reindeer self--he couldn&#39;t help but smile at the spark he saw in his bright, brown eyes, tinted with flecks of gold, and the way his muzzle had a natural grin to it. While he wasn&#39;t nearly as thick as Clyde or Tag, he felt sturdy and grounded. And he was bizarrely proud of the way his antlers framed his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are quite the sight, Söpö. But you had my gaze from the moment I took your ticket.&quot; Clyde grinned. <i>How long had he been standing there watching him?</i><br />
<br />
Eric blushed and walked over, leaning into his reindeer and brushing their muzzles together as Clyde took him into his arms, rubbing the fur on his back and shoulders supportively. &quot;How are you doing, Aarre? You&#39;ve been through a lot in the last week. How are you? Truly?&quot; Clyde searched his expression, looking a little worried.<br />
<br />
He thought for a moment and smiled. &quot;I&#39;m great, actually.&quot; He nipped at Clyde&#39;s muzzle affectionately. &quot;<i>Santa&#39;s Reindeer</i>...I can&#39;t believe it!&quot; He sighed, letting his lips flap and started to push Clyde towards the bed.<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
They sat against the headboard, leaning into each other as they traced lines in each other&#39;s fur and along their lengths with an unhurried sensuality. After what felt like a non-stop sprint, it was nice to just be together, as Eric tugged playfully at Clyde&#39;s sheath, eliciting a snort from his reindeer.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do we need to do to get ready for tonight?&quot; Eric asked, his eyes closed for a moment as Clyde nipped at his neck playfully. &quot;I should probably get some new clothes, right? My old ones won&#39;t quite fit and I should probably stop stealing yours,&quot; he laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we could always stop by Johann&#39;s. We should...&quot; Clyde grunted as Eric ran his thumb along the ridge of his shaft, &quot;We should get you some formalwear, though once Christmas is over you won&#39;t really need to worry about clothing. We only really cover up for the elves and the tourists.&quot; He ran a finger up Eric&#39;s chest before pulling his antler and nipping at his nose again. &quot;And we need to get you properly measured for your tack, so they can have it ready for practice tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And how long will that take?&quot; Eric grinned as he moved to straddle Clyde&#39;s lap, putting their cocks together and starting to grind them together as their breathing deepened.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh...,&quot; Clyde breathed, getting into it, &quot;A couple of hours, maybe? It depends on--&quot;<br />
<br />
They both jumped at a loud knock on the door downstairs before they heard it opening. Eric looked down at Clyde quickly before jumping off the bed and scrambling for a blanket to cover himself with. He hoped Tom had returned but he froze as he heard the patter of hooves and an unfamiliar gruff voice call out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hei! Clyde, you home? We heard the news!&quot; As the tromping grew closer Eric realized they were coming up the stairs as he scrambled to duck out of view, trying to hide his erection. He was beginning to learn that Reindeer were extremely casual about privacy. <br />
<br />
Clyde simply crossed to the door, closing it halfway and leaning out. &quot;We&#39;re here! Give us a moment, we&#39;ll be down to meet you, isä!&quot; He grinned apologetically towards Eric. &quot;Are you ready to meet my parents?&quot;<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
Eric stood at the top of the stairs and attempted to compose himself. He was surprisingly self-conscious wearing Clyde&#39;s oversized shorts. <i>Meeting the parents?</i> He&#39;d met Santa today and this was somehow more daunting. He slapped his cheeks a couple of times and willed himself down as he saw Clyde standing with 2 reindeer. <br />
<br />
The most imposing was the biggest reindeer Eric had ever seen, which at this point was a statement. He had dark brown fur with flecks of grey, bushy salt and pepper fur on his chin that resembled a beard and a jockish aura about him, his antlers a massive shelf above his thick head. He wore blue-fir colored shorts with elaborate gold patterning going up the sides and a harness across his chest with jingle bells artfully placed at the seems. As he turned towards the sound, his nose glowing the trademark red, Eric immediately saw the resemblance to both Rudy and Clyde.<br />
<br />
Wearing a matching dress with tinsel accents, Clyde&#39;s mother was tall with a busty figure, sparkling blue eyes, and a warm smile that immediately put Eric at ease. She wore tinsel in her antlers and similar to Clara had small crystal baubles hanging from some of the points--something Eric was beginning to associate as the reindeer equivalent of jewelry. &quot;You must be Eric, rakas!&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric started to respond but soon found himself swept up in a bone-crushing hug from Clyde&#39;s father, who moved with a surprising speed. &quot;Yes, hello! It&#39;s nice to meet you.&quot; He sputtered, reeling as he was put down.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is good to meet you, poika. We&#39;ve heard a lot about you! You&#39;re the talk of the town,&quot; the older reindeer laughed. &quot;I am Rudolph the Second. This is my mate, Marjatta.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, call me Maria. Or äiti if you prefer.&quot; She crossed and gave Eric a peck on his forehead before pulling him into a warm hug as his face flushed. Clyde beamed at them. &quot;Let me get a good look at you.&quot; She stood back and gave him a good once-over before glancing at Clyde with a look Eric didn&#39;t catch. Clyde blushed and grinned as she walked over to take his hand. &quot;He&#39;s a very handsome Reindeer, rakkaani, I see why you like him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come! Sit!&quot; Rudolph ushered Eric towards the couch as Eric shot a pleading look to Clyde before sitting down. The large reindeer sat immediately next to him as Eric smiled awkwardly. &quot;Congratulations on making Santa&#39;s Team! That is very impressive. You should be very proud of yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you. But I don&#39;t think I&#39;d have had a chance without Clyde&#39;s help.&quot; He admitted, honestly.<br />
<br />
Clyde and his mother joined them, sitting in the armchairs across from them, handing out tea and plates loaded with fruit, oat granola, and a white fuzzy looking plant Eric didn&#39;t recognize, though it smelled delicious.<br />
<br />
&quot;Still, an accomplishment. You&#39;re the first human-born to ever earn the distinction. You must be a natural.&quot; Eric nearly had the wind knocked out of him as Rudolph clapped him on the back congratulatorily with a boisterous laugh. &quot;And it seems that you have won the heart of our Clyde. An even bigger accomplishment.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m the lucky one,&quot; Clyde chirped, saving Eric from needing to respond as he was sure his ears were starting on fire.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell us about yourself!&quot; Rudolph prompted.<br />
<br />
Eric blinked, &quot;Err...Well, I&#39;m from California originally. The United States. I lived with my mother, Theresa, who is a nurse..., and I graduated from High School this last Spring. My father, Michael, is a Sports Producer in Los Angeles, though they separated 10 years ago. Uh...I was thinking of going to college next year, but I hadn&#39;t made up my mind quite yet. My brother, Tom, bought me the tickets to this resort and..., well, I guess the rest is history?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And when is the mating ceremony to take place?&quot; Rudolph grinned, apparently not one to beat around the bush. He winked at his wife and smiled down at Eric.<br />
<br />
&quot;We haven&#39;t decided yet, but with Santa&#39;s blessing today, we can go to the Elders. Perhaps around New Years?&quot; Clyde looked to Eric questioningly, who shrugged but nodded uncertainly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have already spoken to the other elders.&quot; <i>Of course Rudolph would be one of the Elders.</i> &quot;We will convene the Neuvosto in 2 days time. There is much to plan.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marjatta beamed. &quot;And of course you must come to dinner! I want to know what you like to eat so we can plan the Juhla accordingly!&quot;</p>
