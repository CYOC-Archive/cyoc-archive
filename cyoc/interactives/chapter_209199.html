<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Steven felt his entire body go limp. In spite of his mounting panic, Steven felt his breathing calm down and a wave of peaceful sensation wash over his brain. Very relaxed, he felt his eyelids drooped. He was ready for a long sleep even though he knew it was a bad idea and that he&#39;d wake up in a real nightmare. The surgeon patted his head and shushed him gently. Not unkindly, he said he&#39;d help you throughout this difficult adjustment and that soon enough he&#39;d relinquish the last remnants of his humanity. Willingly and happily so. That one day Steven would thank him for having been a chosen. The surgeon claimed softly that Steven was a very luck boy indeed. <br />
&quot;But a new life demands a new name, does it not? You shall be called Hypocras from now on. It is a spiced wine. A delicacy. Do not fret, my pet. I will look after you, always. You are my creation. My child. And like any good parent, I provide to my children.&quot;<br />
He caresses Steven&#39;s head as he sinks fully into a dreamless sleep. The surgeon&#39;s injections won&#39;t wake him up before several days.<br />
<br />
When Steven does wake up, he still feels exhausted and everything is blurry. He feels very, very weird and above all, his throat is parched. And he lying in hay. Why? But never mind that. He sees a ceramic jug full of water and downs it in a few long gulps, dragging himself over to it. It&#39;s...white wine. Never mind, it&#39;s great and heavenly an d delicious. Wine! It&#39;s wine the best drink even known across history. Too bad there aren&#39;t more jugs around. He calls out for more and for help but just this act had exhausted him. He lies down upon the sweet-smelling hay and falls back asleep. First, sleep. Then, he&#39;ll think of putting order in his head.<br />
<br />
When he wakes up again, he feels a bit better. And there are two pitchers and a plate right next to him. The plate contains a loaf of alive bread, which he eats quickly. Yum! And the pitchers... They contain white wine! Great! What a treat! He downs the pitchers happily and pats his stomach afterwards. That hit the spot. His belly is much, much pudgier and hairy than before though. He doubts girls would find it cute, let alone cute. But just thinking about girls makes him feel... hard. Down there. He moves a bit his new gut to look at what&#39;s going on with his privates and gasps. That&#39;s right! They became huge! And it seemed they swelled a bit more while he was out. His scrotum bulges very arrogantly and his penis has become monstrous! Monstrously impressive and the rival of any porn star but monstrous nevertheless! Wow! Girls will easily forget his body hair and round belly once they get a load of this! Steven then laughs loudly at his excellent double-entendre. It comes at bleats but something else requires his attention. Something urgent. Something very demanding. The idea of sticking this extraordinary virile member into a girl, or even another guy makes it stands to attention. Steven becomes horny and touches himself happily, thinking of naked girls to have sex with. His testicles sway and smack each other and his own skin. So pleasurable! And in no time, his penis swells with sperm and blood. He pants, he sweats and he can only think about girls, nymphs and fauns or even guys, stroking his penis, caressing it or delicately licking. He can just imagine small perky breasts, big bosoms and round buttocks. Other big testicles to tickle and other penises to stroke and kiss and bring to a wonderful erection, his lover flushing with pleasure. He was not a homosexual before but now, as a satyr, it sounds so appealing! Anything goes and as long as the ,lover is beautiful, why not have fun? Thinking of all those potential lovers and torrid intercourses makes him spurt his sperm high in the air. As he recuperates from his delightful moment, he cannot stop noticing that his load is much more important than when he masturbated as a human. This makes him swell with pride. He&#39;s a stallion! A fertile stud! A real male packed with pheromones! The sole notion of the great prowess he now possesses brings in another massive erection and his testicles start pumping more gametes anew while his muscles prepare for another round of a joyful ride.<br />
<br />
After five times pleasuring himself, Steven feels finally wasted. He&#39;s ready to snooze in the soft hay again. Oh, right. His name is Hypocras now. He lies down, happy with his deeds and prowess, all set to nap as if he had not a care in the world. He bleats in contentment. As an after-thought, he touches his face. A lot more facial hair than before, with the little beginnings of a bears. As for his hair, it now reaches his shoulders, almost. But two ram horns now emerge out of his skull and even though they are so odd, what with their angle and cloven hooves upon him, his goat legs feel a bit stiff but amazingly easy to get accustomed to. He&#39;ll practice later, though. He does see a little goat tail poking out of his backside and it moves back and forth. Well! Hypocras is sure girls would think it adorable. Between that and his package, he&#39;s sure to meet lots of ladies! Or men. He doesn’t care anymore. His massive &#39;friend&#39; would love being introduce to any interior of their anatomy and chuckles at his own joker. After a good meal, good wine and good fun, sleeping it all off is required. He hasn&#39;t had that much fun in such a care-free fashion since well...ever. He snores softly, happy with himself and not aware that the surgeon is watching him through a hidden camera. The results are excellent as he smiles at what he looks at. Hypocras is regressing fast to basic male instincts and desires, typical of that of a satyr. Already he&#39;s responded very well to the serums, prompting him to give in to new impulses and desires. The idea of just having it easy for the rest of his existence will provide the rest.<br />
<br />
Upon waking up, Hypocras sees more olive bread and a pitcher full of red wine. He had no idea olive bread could be so tasteful before! And red wine makes him become very much in a good mood. And who knew sleeping on straw could be so comfy? He just needs some lovers around and he&#39;ll be set! And some music, because dancing and partying are the great joys of life. But a door unlocking interrupts his thoughts. It opens and the surgeon from before enters.<br />
Seeing him makes Hypocras scared and angry. He&#39;s the guy who kidnapped and transformed him! Because of him, he won&#39;t play video games or do lots of fun things anymore. <br />
&quot;I hate you! Change me back!&quot; he bleats in rage.<br />
&quot;Even if I wanted to or could, your bleats take away the seriousness of your demands, little satyr,&quot; chuckled the surgeon.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not little! What I don&#39;t have in size anymore, I make up with my dick!&quot; Hypocras exclaims, thrusting his massive privates at the surgeon through movements of his groin.&quot;Bet you don&#39;t have that!&quot;    <br />
Hypocras, formerly Steven, then claps his hands to his mouth, appalled. Where did that come from? How could he become so crude, so lewd and sink so low? The surgeon laughs heartily though.<br />
&quot;You are right for sure! I do not!&quot;<br />
&quot;Change me back!&quot; yells Steven, becoming conscious of the lowly things that have become natural to him.<br />
&quot;As I said, it&#39;s not going to happen,&quot; calmly says the surgeon. &quot;Thanks top you and other experiments, I&#39;m going to open a mythological zoo, one that all in the world shall envy. And will probably want me to copy for them, which I will, at a price. You are my first satyr and soon you shall be exhibited in your own enclosure. Wide and with all the comforts a young strapping satyr like you could ask for. And over time, your own female fauns and delightful nymphs.&quot;<br />
&quot;No!&quot; screams Steven. &quot;I don&#39;t want to be made a freak!&quot;<br />
&quot;Not a freak, a wonderful, satyr. A satyr making all men visiting the zoo jealous, believe me, and all women wondering how good it would be to have sex with you. You can have your own harem. And guzzle wine at your heart&#39;s content. Your lovers shall massage you and bathe you and minister to all your needs. And arousals,&quot; he added with a smirk. &quot;Doesn&#39;t it sound fun?&quot;<br />
Yes. Yes, it did. And very, very tempting. The idea of a harem, of drinking wine and of partying all night long was irresistibly appealing. What more could he ask for? A human life was so boring, so much of a drudgery next to it. He could receive more pleasure and sex as a satyr. He&#39;d have no responsibilities, no rules and no hassles as a satyr. It would be so, so much easier to give in. Life would be easy and sweet. To feel his penis get erect like it did every day and with his own harem or buddies... What a dream! With that thought of starting a wonderful new life, Steven let the last remorse and objections belonging to the Steven part of his mind to be swallowed by his new desires and needs, fully accepting to become Hypocras. And if he had really any qualms left, they died out when the surgeon presented him with more red wine and delicious food, along with the assurances that he&#39;d get new fellows, comrades and mates very soon. <br />
<br />
A few days later, Hypocras woke up with the sun. His enclosure was very nice! Spacious, with his large cave full of hay and a wool blanket. He got pitchers of wine several times a day and he could eat as much bread, olives, seafood or roasted meat as he desired. He round belly was funny when it jiggled in movement. And what did he care? His most important part of his anatomy was right under and it had nothing to envy to anyone. His virility was there and his appetite, and consequently belly proved that he was strong and healthy. He smirked each time visitors gasped and stared in awe at his impressive package. Men and women alike. He called out to girls and they all blushed at his attention. To men too, sometimes and they acted all flustered as well. As for the young jerks who hurled back insults, they could never hope to win against him. His massive penis was enough to taunt them and make them ashamed in comparison. And the breeze caressing his groin and privates was always heavenly! Swaying his testicles showed them off and why should he feel ashamed? It was all natural, like all of his body hair and humans were the ones with prudish morals and nonsensical restrictions. Didn&#39;t stop them from visiting his enclosure often!All hypocrites! Yes, life was good when one gave in to his instincts, base as they might be considered but so natural and pleasurable! Hypocras just wished for actual partners and hoped the surgeons was actively recruiting members of his future harem. Hypocras had no doubt he would be a most understanding lover and if babies were the result of his attentive care, well, he&#39;d be the best father ever.</p>
