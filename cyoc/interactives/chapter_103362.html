<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jenny rolled over again around eight o&#39;clock to find herself cuddled up to Harry in his bed and with both of them still in their were forms. Looking at him and his largely silvery gray furred muzzle and body and knowing how close they were simply made her happy and she began to wag her tail behind her as she lay beside him. He&#39;d done so much for her and she loved him so much. Unfortunately the conspicuous thumping of her tail against the sheets of the be served to wake Harry up as well. He only smiled to her as he woke up and opened his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... someone got up happy,&quot; Harry said with a soft smile.<br />
<br />
Jenny cuddled as close as she could manage to him and licked the black triangle that was his nose on the end of his muzzle.<br />
<br />
&quot;I woke up happy because my bonded mate is with me,&quot; Jenny said to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Forever and always,&quot; Harry promised softly and sweetly.<br />
<br />
Jenny watched as he yawned and then stretched as he sat up. Jenny was quick to sit up and stretch as well. They had a lot to do over the course of the weekend, which largely related to the things they had to do to be ready for their wedding which was pretty much a week away. It had its issues that Jenny would be nervous over, and she knew that, but having Harry there and being with him, that was her &quot;happy ever after&quot; and would make whatever happened worth it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well the start of a big day today,&quot; Harry commented as he stood up, and Jenny looked over to see his fur begin to shrink back into his skin as he returned to his human form, &quot;you&#39;ll get to meet my brother and we&#39;ll get to go over the main estimates for the apartment...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All building toward a happy ever after,&quot; Jenny smiled as she began to return to her own human form, her massive ears shrinking down and rounding at their tips to move to the sides of her head.<br />
<br />
And both nodded as they returned to human form and got dressed. Their fur replaced by pink human skin, and their tails pulled back into a normal human spine. Their feet shortened so that they walked with their heals touching the ground, a plantigrade stance and their eyes, red while in their vulpine forms returned to their normal human colors. Jenny felt slightly sad to have to change back, but Moon Lake had its rules she wasn&#39;t going to break them. At times, she found it rather amusing on how things had developed. She&#39;d initially been shocked and horrified at her new were-form, more from surprise than fear, but she&#39;d rapidly come to love it and all its perks. She felt beautiful and with Harry, she felt loved and the bond between them was the most important thing.<br />
<br />
The pair quickly dressed in clean clothes and prepared for the day. It was nothing formal as they needed for the ceremony the night before, and was simply something that would be soft and comfortable to wear for the day. Jenny figured she might need some more things from Awareness, so as to cut down on her laundry, but that was something that could be handled later. Today was simply to be for wedding preparation. As they made their way out they found Henry and Lisa Jenkins in the process of making waffles.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning, you two,&quot; Henry said with a polite smile, &quot;sleep well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Jenny said with a smile and hugged Harry&#39;s arm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Care for some waffles before we get into business for today?&quot; Lisa offered.<br />
<br />
Harry and Jenny both nodded and watched as Lisa then poured batter into a waffle iron and they could soon smell the batter beginning to cook and become tasty Belgian Waffles. The four enjoyed their breakfast and engaged in some friendly conversation on what they planned to do with meeting Harry&#39;s brother and what all their respective were-forms looked like. Harry&#39;s based off a Gray Fox, Jenny&#39;s off of a Fennec Fox, and Harry&#39;s brother being a weredog and his specific breed being based off one of the smaller &quot;lap-dog&quot; breeds. Harry chuckled at the memory as at times he wanted to tease his brother over the specific breed of dog he turned into, but Harry also knew that his brother got many of the same benefits that all weres had, and remembered that his brother became rather popular with nearly every female were because of his specific breed of his own were form. It made for good fun and conversation and some good memories for Harry, though that ended at around nine AM when the door bell rang.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s too early for your brother to be here,&quot; Henry commented, &quot;he said that he had a few things at his office to take care of before coming here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe he&#39;s early,&quot; Lisa answered and began to move to answer the door, &quot;and maybe he&#39;d like some waffles too. I&#39;m afraid we&#39;re at the end of the batter, but I can always make more.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry and Jenny nodded as Lisa left the table and made her way to the front door of the Jenkins home. However, instead of an excited &quot;hello&quot; Harry and Jenny heard a polite female voice that DIDN&#39;T belong to Lisa Jenkins.<br />
<br />
&quot;Konichiwa, Mrs. Jenkins,&quot; they heard Akane&#39;s voice, &quot;I apologize for bothering you this early in the morning, but there are some things that have come up that are very important.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Important?!&quot; Lisa was heard to gasp, &quot;Harry and Jenny aren&#39;t in trouble, are they?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not with the Skulk, dear, but something has happened that will require certain actions,&quot; Akane answered, &quot;May we come in?&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry and Jenny both figured that the &quot;we&quot; referred to Akane and at least one of her grandsons. Lisa accepted the offer and Jenny and Harry soon heard the door shut and footsteps returning toward the Jenkins&#39; kitchen/dining area. Shortly after, Lisa returned with Akane and Daisuke following behind. The Skulk leader held up a hand to let Jenny and Harry know they could remain seated.<br />
<br />
&quot;As I said to Mrs. Jenkins,&quot; Akane spoke, &quot;I apologize for this intrusion, but something has happened that you must be made aware of.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry looked to Jenny, and noted her almost immediate look of nervousness, and then to his father, who while he looked calm, did have some look of concern.<br />
<br />
&quot;What has happened?&quot; Harry asked after a moment.<br />
<br />
Daisuke came forward and pulled a set of photographs from a pocket inside his suit and handed them to Harry which showed the man who had been asking after Jenny at the college while they had been at the Skulk&#39;s ceremony. Harry frowned at it and passed it along to Jenny, who passed it to Henry, who passed it Lisa, who returned the photo to Daisuke. While the photo was passed along, Akane began to explain.<br />
<br />
&quot;During last night&#39;s ceremony, this man made his way onto the Moon Lake College campus,&quot; Akane spoke, &quot;he made it to Jenny&#39;s dormitory building and when engaged by one of the college staff... I believe she&#39;s employed there as a sort of &quot;chaperon&quot; for the entire dormitory but isn&#39;t a student volunteer... he said he was looking for Jenny and claimed to be her brother.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My parents wouldn&#39;t let either of my brothers come this far on their own,&quot; Jenny commented, &quot;It was all I could do to be allowed to come to college here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We are already certain that this isn&#39;t a relative of yours,&quot; Akane spoke slowly, &quot;but we fear he could be an employee of the businessman you&#39;ve said your parents have wanted to marry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dieter...&quot; Jenny spoke slowly, though not entirely surprised. Him sending a scout was new, but she didn&#39;t put it past him to try something, since her father had continued to push the union between Jenny and Dieter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Akane nodded, &quot;and while it is possible that his actions are &quot;innocent,&quot; the way he made his appearance and where he went AFTER leaving the college would be more conducive to being a potential problem as a threat to Jenny or to Harry... or to both.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;d...?&quot; Lisa asked nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s the fear,&quot; Akane spoke and looked to Harry, &quot;especially as he seems to be engaging in what would be termed &quot;stalking&quot; behavior. He&#39;s presently outside your brother&#39;s company, likely trying to identify you...&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry took Jenny&#39;s hand and squeezed it with the hope of reassuring her.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Skulk&#39;s security services and the Moon Lake Police already have measures in place to observe and perhaps even lure the man away,&quot; Akane spoke in assurance to them, &quot;and if he does do anything that may give the police probable cause to go beyond simply questioning the man, we are prepared and taking action to see that he is arrested before he can do anything that would bring us all to grief.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that&#39;s good,&quot; Henry commented, &quot;but if he&#39;s...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For the moment he has nothing more than a camera,&quot; Akane answered, &quot;so your other son is in no danger, but for the moment, there are means we&#39;d wish to undertake to protect you... ALL of you until the wedding takes place and we can be certain that the present threat has been dealt with.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you propose?&quot; Lisa asked nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;To shelter your family in my home,&quot; Akane answered, &quot;I would have only one guest room, but we believe the man is only going on what we suspect Dieter Wilhelm knows, and he won&#39;t know about me. Staying with me will allow you the protection of the Skulk&#39;s security services without us having to place a heavy presence here... which might only make this man more careful with what he does or make him take more... extreme actions.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But if he becomes more cautious, wouldn&#39;t that lead to avoiding trouble?&quot; Jenny asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Assuming his only purpose is to prevent the wedding?&quot; Daisuke spoke up, &quot;that might work, but we fear that this might also raise unnecessary fear among the rest of Moon Lake&#39;s town&#39;s people... especially after what Yvette Smith put the town through. That fear could lead to chaos which could in turn present an opportunity if this man&#39;s orders do include being hostile, regardless of whoever issued those orders.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We intend for you both to have your happy-ever-afters,&quot; Akane gently took both Harry and Jenny&#39;s hands, &quot;I promise you that.&quot;</p>
