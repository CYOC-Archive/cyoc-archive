<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You had so much to consider and your mind was racing between thoughts. As soon as you determined that something needed consideration your brain was off to laying out the next problem... You needed to get somewhere you could freak out in private and your room had a bed and the bathroom did not.<br />
<br />
Retreating to your room the nagging voice in the back of your head was all too happy to provide more details when you asked. &quot;Okay, what to deal with first?&quot; you said to the empty room after closing the door.<br />
<br />
&#39;You messed your body up and although Dad isn&#39;t suspicious, Mom and friends at school will be. Especially when your entire wardrobe is too small overnight.&#39; the voice mocked.<br />
<br />
Your heart dropped realizing you were still in pajama bottoms. You gazed at your closet, never before did it seem to hold as much power over your future as right now. If none of your pants fit, you will have to ask to go clothes shopping and mom will know something is up.<br />
<br />
It was as you feared, most pants were too tight and wouldn&#39;t even close. The worst offenders couldn&#39;t even be pulled past your meatier legs. Your body was definitely sturdier than this morning as your build had shifted from lean toward average. Thankfully, you had found one pair of pants that fit. Your mom was a wise woman and she anticipated that teenaged boys grow. All you had to do was give her some of the small pairs for donation and give her your new size. Maybe you could go shopping yourself and just ask her for money? That might work.<br />
<br />
You had a donation pile ready and were wearing the somewhat tight emergency jeans, you grabbed a trash bag from the kitchen and took it back to your room filling it up. Realizing you should do the same with shirts, you groaned and continued trying to hide the suddenness of your new form. You managed to find shirts that failed in all the ways they could. Fits fine, but shows your stomach. It&#39;s long enough but is now a compression shirt and wouldn&#39;t let you breathe. Crushing your shoulders... is fighting your biceps. Few articles of clothing survived the purge that day.<br />
<br />
You proudly collapsed on the bed as you finished your work. After cooling off for a moment you sat back up taking a few swigs from your coffee cup and setting it back on your nightstand. &quot;Okay, next problem?&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;Your father may expect you to change, but he doesn&#39;t expect his gray to lessen.&#39; the voice delighted in pointing out problems.<br />
<br />
&quot;True... can I get him back into the socks? That would be the easiest way to fix half my problems...&quot; you pulled the socks from your hiding place and went out to see what your dad was up to.<br />
<br />
You checked the whole house, he was nowhere to be seen. You checked the Garage, his vehicle was still there. You looked in the yard and there he was, doing yardwork, wearing his shoes... Like you, his form is now what it is... With a heavy sigh you grunted out a disappointed &quot;Fucking dammit&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Mister, that&#39;s not necessary!&quot; Mom called from behind making you jump. &quot;Honestly, you sound just like your father.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry Mom!&quot; you exclaimed instinctively, surprised by your word choice yourself. Usually, you delight in finding fun phrases to replace swears and when pressed, resort to boring replacements like crud or darn... <br />
<br />
&quot;I was hoping dad could drop me off at the store, I outgrew most of my wardrobe and wanted to try shopping for myself.&quot; you blurted trying to find something to say other than admitting that you accidentally magicked yourself and Dad and are both stuck this way.<br />
<br />
&quot;Didn&#39;t we get you new clothes for school two months ago? I just got back from town...&quot; Mom questioned with pleading eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Growth spurt?&quot; you offered, dreading her seeing what remained of your viable clothes...<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, I wish... nevermind, lets go.&quot; Mom said sounding exhausted.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve collected my undersized clothes for donation. let me grab it.&quot; you said running to your room and returning with one of the several bags of clothes. <br />
<br />
She seemed heartened that you did the chore without asking and took you to several stores to find good deals. In the end you got three more pairs of pants and a few shirts... She didn&#39;t know the extent of clothes you lost, so this will have to do until you can go out on your own or something...  <br />
<br />
She did make a fuss when you gave her your waist size but after looking at your current jeans (which were bigger than the number she had in her mind) and seeing that they were even too small she relented that she must be remembering incorrectly. She didn&#39;t comment on your burgeoning beard, but you knew she saw. <br />
<br />
Maybe, just maybe, this can all work out.... <br />
<br />
Once you returned home you checked the yard and found your dad wasn&#39;t there. You collected your things and brought them to your room to find your dad playing video games on your console. If you had to guess he had never played a video game in his life but here he was, fired up and entranced...<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey...&quot; you called intrigued and weirded-out by the space violations, both physical and virtual... &quot;Mom and I just finished some shopping, having fun?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, actually... I never saw what you liked in this thing but this morning I became intrigued how you could spend so many hours in front of this thing. I... I get the appeal now. Didn&#39;t think you&#39;d mind me checking it out...&quot; he replied without looking at you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh.&quot; you managed putting away your new clothes and eyeing the bags that remained. &quot;Yeah, I&#39;m glad you like it.&quot;</p>
