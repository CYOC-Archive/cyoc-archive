<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff arrives at his next class, which is History, about five minutes before the teacher, Mr. Anderson, arrives. The teen walks over to his desk and sits down, he takes out his History books and pens and lies them on his desk.<br />
<br />
“Jeff,” he then hears, when he looks up, he sees one of his friends Katrina, walking up to him, “why did you just run off? That is not like you, normally we all leave together.”<br />
<br />
Normally, Jeff would simply answer the question without a thought, but as he is about to answer, he feels the strange feeling of annoyance raise up in him, &#39;Kat is such an annoying and nosy person. It is none of her effing business, I can decide on my own if I wanna hang out with them or not,&#39; Jeff grumbles mentally, &#39;wait... why am I thinking that? Did Sayaka do something? Is she the reason why I find Kat and my other friends suddenly annoying?&#39;<br />
<br />
Katrina pokes Jeff in the shoulder, “yo, earth to Jeff,” she says.<br />
<br />
When Kat pokes him, Jeff feels his annoyance increase, he is about to tell his friend to get lost and leave him alone and keep her nose out of his business. But Jeff manages to stop himself, he takes a deep breath and then says, “I was in the library, studying.”<br />
<br />
Katrina raises her eyebrow, “you and studying? Pfff... as if, nah... you did something else.”<br />
<br />
Jeff rolls his eyes, “if you think that, that is your problem,” he says, his voice filled with annoyance, “keep your nose out of my business. You are NOT my mother, now, can you get lost? I want to follow the lecture instead of your annoying prodding.”<br />
<br />
Katrina tilts her head and scowls, “you are acting weird,” she says, “I will get to the bottom of this!”<br />
<br />
Again Jeff rolls his eyes, “what ever,” he says, “now, leave me alone!”<br />
<br />
Katrina throws up her hands, “fine,” she says, “I will be keeping my eyes on you though!”<br />
<br />
Now Jeff is really annoyed, “no you won&#39;t,” he says, a growl in his voice, “you are NOT my guardian, I am old enough to do what I want. I am not letting YOU control MY life, don&#39;t you dare start stalking me! Or I WILL call the cops!”<br />
<br />
This outburst shocks Katrina, but then she shouts back, “FINE,” she says, “WE ARE DONE, DON&#39;T COME AND APOLOGIZE! YOU JUST LOST A FRIEND! I AM... WAS JUST WORRIED ABOUT YOU!”<br />
<br />
This is the last straw for Jeff, he jumps up from his seat, his fists clenched, “THAT STILL DOES NOT GIVE YOU THE RIGHT TO CONTROL MY LIFE,” he shouts back, “I HAVE PUT UP WITH YOUR SHIT LONG ENOUGH! DON&#39;T EVER TALK TO ME AGAIN! TELL THE OTHERS THEY SHOULD BETTER KEEP THEIR DISTANCE! YOU ARE ALL SO EFFING ANNOYING! I AM BETTER OFF WITHOUT YOU!”<br />
<br />
By now, the whole class is looking in shock at the duo, Katrina opens her mouth to shout something back, when the door to the class room opens and the teacher enters. Mr. Anderson notices the tension in the air, he looks around and notices Jeff and Katrina, “is there a problem,” he asks.<br />
<br />
Jeff looks over at the teacher, then back at Katrina, “no, sir,” he calmly says, “Katrina was about to take her seat, isn&#39;t that right?!”<br />
<br />
Katrina, tears in her eyes, lets out a growl, “you&#39;ll regret it,” she says, “don&#39;t come crawling back and ask for forgiveness!”<br />
<br />
Jeff leans in, a smirk on his face, “don&#39;t worry... I am not planning to,” he whispers back. Without another word, the boy sits down and looks towards the front of the class.<br />
<br />
Katrina stands there, anger and disappointment on her face, then she turns and stomps off to her desk.<br />
<br />
“Now,” the teacher says, “let&#39;s get the class started.”<br />
<br />
While the teacher starts his lecture, Jeff suddenly comes back to his senses, &#39;what the fuck was that,&#39; he asks himself, &#39;did I just end my friendship with the guys? What did Sayaka do to me?&#39;<br />
<br />
For the rest of the class and school day, Jeff takes the time to try and understand what had happened between himself and Katrina. Katrina had told the others and they kept their distance, all they did was shoot the boy angry and disappointed stares. A part of Jeff wanted to walk up to them and apologize, but the stronger half was glad to be rid of them.<br />
<br />
When the bell rings, signaling the end of the school day, Jeff stays sitting at his desk, deep in thought, while the rest of the class, including his Ex-friends leave without a word. Jeff continues to try and figure out, why he was so angry at Katrina, was it him or did Sayaka do something? The boy can not remember Sayaka planting an order into his mind, telling him to be an ass to his friends. As Jeff thinks back, he has to admit, that Katrina and the other two of his friends, really were annoying: Katrina, always poking her nose into his business, pranking him and just being annoying, Kyoko and Kiyoshi are even worse, always talking about aliens and coming up with some bullshit fantasy explanations to random situations!<br />
<br />
Jeff lets out a sigh, “I guess it was simply the last straw for me,” he concludes, “I should have canceled the friendship a long time ago. I am really better off without them,” he mumbles to himself. The boy then looks at the clock, “I should get going,” he says, “I don&#39;t want Sayaka to wait for me, she&#39;ll be mad and do something to me.”<br />
<br />
While walking towards the front gate, Jeff can&#39;t help but notice that, the more he thinks about Sayaka, he feels happier by the second, &#39;even though, Sayaka controls my mind, she is defiantly far better than those... losers,&#39; he thinks to himself, “she is so kind and she really knows what&#39;s best for me! I am so happy that I belong to her, happier than I was before, I just hope I can please her and be a good toy to her.&#39;<br />
<br />
Sayaka meanwhile is walking up and down in front of the gate impatiently, “where is my little toy,” she asks herself, “I am starting to get mad. If he doesn&#39;t show up in the next... oh, there he is!” Sayaka&#39;s frown turns into a smile, when she spots Jeff walking up to her, “there you are,” the girl says, “I was starting to get worried that you&#39;d never show up.”<br />
<br />
“Hey Sayaka,” Jeff says, sounding cheerful, smiling at the girl, “I wouldn&#39;t let you wait, I just thought it would be best if no one would be around. I am not in a good mood, to be honest.”<br />
<br />
Sayaka nods, “already heard about your little confrontation with that... bitch... sorry, I mean Katrina.”<br />
<br />
Jeff scowls, then he nods and says, “yeah... I don&#39;t understand why I haven&#39;t canceled the friendship with those losers much sooner.”<br />
<br />
Sayaka smirks, “well, better later than never,” she says, “now you have me, and I&#39;ll treat you better than those losers ever did.”<br />
<br />
Jeff smiles, “yeah, and I am so happy about it,” he says, “so, what have you planned?”<br />
<br />
Sayaka smiles, “WE are going to the mall,” she says, “we have a lot of shopping to do.”<br />
<br />
“Okay,” Jeff simply says.<br />
<br />
Sayaka smirks, “good, then come along and stay close to me.”<br />
<br />
Jeff nods and takes his place by Sayaka&#39;s side, soon both are off into town, and an hour later they arrive at the mall. Before entering the mall, Jeff suddenly stops in his tracks and facepalms himself, “man... I totally forgot to let my mom know that I&#39;ll be home late!”<br />
<br />
Sayaka grins, “don&#39;t worry,” she says, “I already took care of that. I have sent your mother a text using your phone, pretending to be you, and told her that you won&#39;t be coming home tonight, that you are staying at a friend&#39;s house.”<br />
<br />
“Oh,” Jeff says, he then smiles, “good thing I have you!”<br />
<br />
Sayaka smirks and nods, “yep,” she says, “now, come on, we haven&#39;t got all day! First stop: the phone store!”</p>
