<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alex saw Summer was still mostly the same, except for one detail… She had long flowing blonde hair with the same outline as the room and his own. Not a moment to soon the outlines begin to spread to her face a the sudden strange feeling woke Summer from her slumber. “Arf! Arf!” She barked as her eyes grew big and bulbous like some sort of cgi animation. Summer looked around with her new big beautiful eyes. Alex was in shock that his jaw actually dropped to the floor with his tongue rolling out. “Arrrree you okrrray, mastrrr? Yourr look surrrprrrised.” Summer started to talk in a half smooth feminine voice and a dogs whine. Alex’s jaw snapped back into position which he ended up biting his tongue. “Yeeoooch!” He yelled as his tongue started to swell into a balloon and turn from pink to red. “Suhmer… you cahn talhk?” Alex asked with his tongue hanging out still recovering. “Masterrr… whrrats happening?” She says with her voice clearing up.<br />
<br />
Alex was about to talk until he noticed some of Summer’s soft fur disappear from her forehead and downward giving the appearance of pale skin. Her snout also seemed to shrink a tiny bit as more fur disappeared into her face. Her nose and ears were the only parts to keep her fur as she now looked like a human cartoon girl mixed with a dogs head with a dogs body. Little did Alex know it was only the beginning. “Summer?” Alex was going to ask if she was alright until he noticed her entire body growing. Summer’s arms and legs started to stretch and loose fur and gain outlines just like her face. Her fingers were thinning in and her black claws were now retracting into long nails, making them look like human hands with paw pads. Summer looked at her new hands as her feet started to grow longer with the same thing happening with her claws on her toes. They were human feet with paw pads.<br />
<br />
Alex wanted to come closer, but her changes were keeping him stay at bay. “Arrgg! My back!” Summer struggled as her torso started to grow in accustom to her new longer arms and legs. She pressed her paw hands on the bed and arched her back in as it began to realign her posture to a biped all the while her fur was disappearing from her entire body except her tail. “I… I feel funny…” She said feeling pressure in her chest area. “Summer… its okay… you… you look…” Alex lost his train of thought as the rest of her fur receded into smooth skin. Being completely naked besides her collar, she looked like a complete normal girl despite the dog and toon features besides one thing. <br />
<br />
“HAAAHHH!” Summer threw her head back and moaned as her chest started to inflate rapidly until two large basketball sized boobs. Alex’s eyes bulged out his skull as his tongue dropped from his mouth falling to the floor and his tail wagging so fast his butt started to hover in the air. “OH MY GOD! YOU’RE A HOTTIE SUMMER!” Alex yelled as his pants started to bulge fro the front slightly. Summer fell to the bed panting hard trying to keep herself calm from her new sensitive breasts. Alex coming back to his senses noticed Summer was exhausted from such a big change. His excitement faded slightly as his tail slowed wagging dropping him to the ground. “Ouch…” He pushed himself up from the floor and came closer to Summer.<br />
<br />
Alex peaked his head to the beds surface close to Summer’s half canine face. “Hey girl… how you feeling?” Alex asked in his usual tone when talking to Summer. She turned her head to face Alex. “I feel… good… master…” Summer panted her long tongue hanging out. Alex blushed at himself being called master. “Don’t call me that girl.” He says rubbing her floppy ear with his glove. “Just call me Alex.” His large snout sported a smile with his large sharp teeth. “You look beautiful.” He said with his heart literally throbbing out of his chest. The same happened with Summer with her heart pounding atop her breasts. “Thank you… Alex…” Summer smiled the same. Alex started to climb on the bed pushing Summer aside to make room for the both of them. They lay and stare down each other’s faces with iris’s forming into hearts. “I can’t believe my first love is a dog… never mind my own pet.” Alex and Summer’s snouts started to nudge closer together until they touched noses. Alex couldn’t take it. His canine instincts were kicking in as he gave Summer a slobbery lick across her face. Summer did the same in response as Alex wrapped his arms around her back and pulled her in closer making Summers breasts squeeze against his chest as they continue to lick each other’s faces with their tails wagging wildly.<br />
<br />
After a long cuddle session, Alex and Summer lied in bed panting away from the satisfying experience. “Master… Alex… did you mean what you said? Am I really your first love?” Summer asked staring at the ceiling. “I mean… yeah… I never thought about having a girlfriend… until I saw you like that… then again maybe that’s my toon mind being horny. But I say it still counts.” Alex replied with a goofy smile from his snout. “Aww. Your sweet. I hope we can do this again soon.” She says hugging her breasts. “Yeah… me too…”</p>
