<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Gloria’s home quickly turned into an impromptu engagement party as the rest of Katie’s friends soon materialized in her home, Lisa even went so far as to call Kumiko and Cole to tell them the news. Gloria smiled as she watched Katie and Kellie show off the engagement ring to all her friends. Making her way towards the kitchen Gloria could see Lisa hastily ordering takeout for everyone to eat.<br />
<br />
“Wow mom this is quite a gathering,” Gloria stated in astonishment. Lisa smirked as she tearily saw her daughter talk with Claudia and her siblings. “Yeah it is,” she smiled, wiping her eyes. “I’m...I’m so happy for her. Those two have always brought out the best in each other.” The sound of the door being thrown open brought the room to a standstill.<br />
<br />
“Mom, Dad,” Kellie cried.<br />
<br />
Lee and Maggie stood in the doorway smiling and wiping their eyes as they gazed at their only daughter. “Oh sweety Lisa just called,” Maggie cried. “Congratulations I’m so happy for you.” Maggie hugged her daughter tightly as Lee approached Katie. Wiping his eyes Lee dug into his pocket, producing a pocket watch. “Katie,” he said, his voice cracking. “This watch was given to me by Maggie’s father the day we got married. It’s always brought us luck. I...I want you to have.” Katie wiped her eyes, thanking Lee before embracing the man in a tight hug. “Congratulations Katie,” he sniffed. “Take care of my little girl. I couldn’t be happier for you.”<br />
<br />
Lisa and Gloria had tearfully watched the exchange between Katie, Kellie and her parents as they now began to talk. “Wow,” Gloria sniffed. “That’s just so beautiful.” Lisa nodded in agreement as she hung up the phone. “Yeah that was beautiful,” she sniffed. “I’m still in shock, which reminds me I’m surprised you haven’t called your friends yet.” <br />
<br />
“Sorry kind of got caught up in the moment mom,” Gloria said sheepishly. “Well you got some time,” Lisa said. “The food won’t be here for about 40 minutes. Might as well tell them the good news and see who wants to come over.” Gloria gaped at her mom in shock, looking at the almost 20 people gathered in the house. “You sure mom the house is getting a little crowded.” Lisa smirked as she placed a hand on her daughters shoulder. “Hey these kind of things don’t happen everyday, the more the merrier.”<br />
<br />
Gloria smiled as she told her mom she was going to Sasha’s to tell her. Racing out the front door. Gloria looked back as the two girls she viewed as sisters happily talked with their friends and family. Approaching Sasha’s home she now hurriedly began knocking on the door. Sasha threw the door open, giving Gloria an annoyed look. “Geez Gloria,” she grumbled. “Why you so impatient and what’s with the house party next door. My dad was actually thinking of going over there to tell them to quiet down.”<br />
<br />
“Katie and Kellie are getting married,” Gloria squealed, causing Sasha to gasp in surprise. “No way that’s AWESOME!!!”<br />
<br />
Sasha and Gloria began talking loudly about the engagement causing Sasha’s father to peak towards the front door. “Everything okay Sasha,” he called. Sasha now grabbed Gloria pulling her into the living room. “Dad Katie and Kellie are getting married.”<br />
<br />
Gloria looked at Sasha’s father Joe Sampson. The man was a heavier individual with a barrel chest and slightly receding black hair. “Oh that’s great darling I’ll have to send them a Congratulations card,” he said as he stood. Stretching he grinned at his daughter and her friend before rubbing the back of his neck. “So I’m guessing your heading over there to celebrate Sasha?”<br />
<br />
“If it’s okay dad,” Sasha said quietly. “I mean, you weren’t planning dinner were you?” Joe rubbed his chin thoughtfully as he looked at his only daughter. “Well I was thinking of cooking a chicken tonight but if your going over there I’ll probably end up going on out.” Sasha’s face dropped slightly as she now looked at her father. “Hey don’t you start with the grump face kid,” he smirked. “As much as I like cooking for you I like it even more when you socialize with your friends. Don’t worry about your ole man, I’ll be alright tonight.”<br />
<br />
Sasha nodded curtly as her father made his way towards the kitchen, turning the stove off. Joe sighed as he grabbed his wallet and jacket and headed towards the door. “Have fun tonight Sasha I’ll see you in a couple of hours.” Sasha and Gloria watched as Joe got on his car, driving away from home. Gloria turned to Sasha, noticing the unhappy look on her friends face. “You Okay Sasha,” she asked.<br />
<br />
Sasha sighed sadly as she watched her fathers car disappear down the road. “No not really,” she grumbled. “Dad is just putting on an act. He just got home like 15 minutes ago. He always wants to cook for me, hang out with me, he won’t say it but I got a feeling I just hurt him.”<br />
<br />
“Sasha,” Gloria whispered. “I...I’m sorry I didn’t know.”<br />
<br />
“Not your fault,” Sasha whispered. “It’s always been just me and dad since mom left. He’s as stubborn as I am, he won’t admit that he’s hurt but I worry about him. What’s going to happen when I graduate from high school or when I move out? I can’t stomach the thought of dad being by himself.”<br />
<br />
“I have an idea,” Gloria said thoughtfully. “Just give me a second okay.” Sasha nodded as Gloria ran back into the house. A couple of minutes later Gloria emerged with Derrick Harris in tow. “Uh Gloria,” Sahsa said in confusion. “Why do you have Mr. Harris with you?”<br />
<br />
“Sasha,” Gloria stated. “Look Katie and the others are so busy with the engagement that they really can’t help tonight. Derrick is the only sibling of Claudia’s right now that wasn’t doing anything and has a car. Besides he said he would help us out.”<br />
<br />
“What exactly am I helping you out with,” Derrick asked, slightly confused. Gloria smiled as she looked both Sasha and Derrick. “We’re going to find Sasha’s dad a date.”<br />
<br />
Sasha and Gloria now sat in the back of Derricks car as they drove. Sasha knew the restaurant/bar her dad would frequent whenever Sasha didn’t eat at home. As they drove Gloria explained her plan to Derrick and Sasha. Katie had mentioned how she had used the Ring of Age to play matchmaker in the past. Gloria’s plan now was to do the same for Mr. Sampson. While Sasha was willing to go along with the idea, Derrick had second thoughts. “This is crazy Gloria,” he grumbled. “There’s no way this isn’t gong to work.”<br />
<br />
“It’s worked in the past Mr. Harris,” Gloria said. “And I think it can work this time too. I just need you to drive us where Mr. Sampson is.” Derrick grumbled as he turned into the local bar that Joe liked to frequent. “I still have my doubts,” he snorted. “So whatever you do just make it fast. I left Ms. Dean all alone at your house. We were supposed to be going out to dinner after this. I’m not trying to screw up my date.”<br />
<br />
Sasha and Gloria suppressed a giggle as they thought of how they had helped Derrick and Morgan with the ring. “Don’t worry Mr. Harris we’ll be quick,” Gloria said as they lept from the car. As they made their way towards the bar they peaked in through the window. Glancing through the window Sasha and Gloria could see Joe eating a burger and drinking a beer in a booth. “You sure about this Gloria,” Sasha asked. Gloria nodded as she scanned get he bar. “Yeah I’m sure,” she said. “This should work, but can you tell me a little but about this place.”<br />
<br />
“A little,” Sasha shrugged. “My dads taken me here before. It’s a nice quiet place. The food is pretty good and even thOugh it’s a bar the people here are quiet and nice.” Gloria took this all in as she scanned the patrons of the bar, looking for the perfect person for Joe Sampson. Gloria smiled as she saw an elderly woman sitting by herself at a table. “What about her,” she asked.<br />
<br />
Sasha looked at the elderly woman sitting at the table by herself. “Oh that’s Claire Jenkins,” Sasha said. “She’s a nice old lady. She’s been a widow for like 10 years, she’s a regular here. Surprisingly she’s not much of a drinker she just loves the roast beef sandwiches they serve here. Every time I’ve come here she always buys me a milkshake.”<br />
<br />
Gloria smiled as she looked at Ms. Jenkins. “Okay cool,” she said thoughtfully. “And just out of curiousity, how old is your dad again?” <br />
<br />
“Dad is 42 why...oh.” Sasha said realizing what Gloria was saying. Rubbing her chin thoughtfully as she looked at Claire. “Okay well can you make her a little younger than my dad. I kind of want him to date a younger woman.”<br />
<br />
“How come?”<br />
<br />
“Well,”  Sasha blushed. “Dad is a bit of a stick in the mud. I’m kind of hoping someone a little younger can make him loosen up a bit.” Gloria smirked as she looked at Sasha. “No problem Sahsa,” she grinned. Turning towards Claire, Gloria now wished for Claire to become 38 years old. The girls now watched as the elderly woman began to slowly grow younger.<br />
<br />
Claire’s silver hair began to liven up as she crept backwards from 75. Reentering her 60s the girls watched as the wrinkles in her face began to lessen as her hair slowly began to transform from silver to blond. The girls stared in awe as Claire’s body rejuvenated. The girls watched as weight began to melt off of Claire’s elderly body while her d cup breasts began to firm up. As the woman crept her 50s and reentered her 40s Sasha and Gloria marveled at how pretty the woman was. Claire had long flowing blond hair with crystal green eyes. Claire’s brests continued to firm up while her waist continued to slim. As the woman finally hit 40 Sasha smiled as she stared at the woman. “Wow she’s hot,” Sasha said in awe. Gloria smiled, placing a hand on Sasha’s shoulder. “Yeah you certainly know how to pick them, now let’s see what happens.”<br />
<br />
The 38 year old Claire blinked as she glanced around the room. Gloria had altered her clothing so that the woman appeared to be a professional woman. Claire now sported a blazer with matching skirt that hugged her curvy hips. As she looked around the bar she smiled as she saw Joe sitting by himself. Slowly the woman got up from her chair. As she walked the girls could see Claire’s toned legs, narrow waist, curvy hips and firm d cup breasts sway as she walked. “Hey Joe how’s it going.”<br />
<br />
Joe looked up from his meal smiling as he watched the attractive blond approach. “Hey Claire great to see you.” Claire smiled as she now looked at Joe. “So no Sasha tonight,” she asked. Joe shook  his head sadly as he now glanced around the bar. “No she’s hanging out with some friends tonight,” he said. “You know how teenagers are, always on the move.” Claire nodded before smiling. “So guess that means your free tonight then,” she smiled. “So tell me Joe, feel like sharing dinner with me tonight.”<br />
<br />
Joe gaped at Claire in shock. “Seriously,” he gaped. “I mean don’t get me wrong Claire I would love too but why now. I mean Sasha and I have known you for what two, three years. We’ve always been friendly I’m just...well shocked.”<br />
<br />
Claire blushed as she averted her eyes from Joe. “Yeah I know,” she said shyly. “The truth is...well..Joe I do like you. I...I always thought you were a sweetheart and a great father. I just never had the nerve to ask you out. Was kind of hoping you you would.”<br />
<br />
Joe began to laugh before apologizing to Claire. “I’m sorry Claire didn’t mean to laugh,” he said. “I just...well...I never thought you would be interested in a guy like me. I mean look at you, your gorgeous. You could have any man you want.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks Joe,” Claire giggled. “I appreciate the compliment. So what do you say, you want to have dinner with me?” Joe now stood gesturing for Claire to have a seat. Claire now sat down as the two began to have a pleasant conversation.<br />
<br />
“Way to go Glo,” Sasha said warmly. Gloria blushed thanking Sasha for the kind words. “Thanks Sasha hopefully things go well for you’re dad. Now how about we go enjoy my sisters engagement party.” Sasha smiled as the two girl she now made their way back to Derricks car.</p>
