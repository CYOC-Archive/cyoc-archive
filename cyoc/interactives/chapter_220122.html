<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Hey, since we’re all here together, why don’t we take a photo? I wanna see this camera in action.” Jake offered.<br />
<br />
“Una maravillosa idea, mi amor! Por favor Emilia? You’re done with the camera aren’t you?” Raquel asked her sister.<br />
<br />
“Si, I&#39;m done playing with it so knock yourselves out.&quot; She responded, unaware that they were about to change.<br />
<br />
Emilia held her hand outwards, managing to somehow get her small, manicured hands to hold the rather large polaroid outwards, capturing the three of them in frame. Jake stuck his tongue out, closing one eye as he pulled Raquel closer to him. Raquel was in the process of rolling her eyes, while Emilia made a rather large smile as the FLASH engulfed the trio.<br />
<br />
Emilia changed first. Her caramel skin lightened rapidly, turning nearly the color of milk. Her wavy hair straightened out, turning fully jet black as it got pulled back into a long ponytail. Her eyes narrowed, while her breasts shrank ever so slightly but her ass became more of a bubble butt. She shrunk nearly half a foot, as her ancestry finished changing to Japanese. Her tank top and skinny jeans became a white and blue, long sleeved cheerleader&#39;s top with a matching skirt. Her final change was to age up a year, turning 21 and a sophomore.<br />
<br />
Next was Raquel, whose skin also lightened though not nearly as much as she returned to her original Caucasian race. Some of her darker skin remained in the form of freckles, while her curly hair became more unkept and extremely ginger, getting tucked into an extremely tight bun. Her clothes too changed, but instead of a skirt she got shorts. These rough shorts covered her swimming one piece, which could still be seen as her only real top. Her ass shrank slightly, while her breasts remained the same, tightly compressed however with her new sports bra, as she needed one to be the good swimmer she now was. She finally also became a sophomore.<br />
<br />
Finally, the largest change was from that of Jake. The reverse of the other two, his skin darkened until it was a dark, ebony brown. His blonde hair darkened to jet black, its texture became kinky, sprouting out high into an afro, which was held slightly at bay by a headband around his forehead.  His facial features softened, his height shrunk, and his body proportions shrunk to match. As double Ds sprouted from his chest, his hips flayed out while his ass grew, his muscles hardened before his penis inverted, and internally he finally became a she. Her clothes remained the least unchanged, just having her jeans become short shorts and her marvel t-shirt become a marvel tank top which accentuated her cleavage, and finally aging up to match her new friends.<br />
<br />
Of course, all of this had happened in as fast as the camera&#39;s flash brightened and then dimmed, and with it reality changed, leaving the three new girls unaware of how drastically they had all transformed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Woo, that is a bright flash.&quot; The former Jake chuckled, rubbing her eyes to get the light out of it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn, I&#39;m sorry Jackie I should&#39;ve let you know.&quot; The former Raquel sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah Jacks like totally our bad.&quot; The former Emilia apologized. &quot;It like totally slipped my mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha!&quot; Jackie, or Jacqueline, laughed. &quot;It&#39;s okay Rachel, Eva... though it&#39;s not surprising this ditz forgot.&quot; Jackie looked at Rachel before gesturing towards Eva, causing Rachel to snicker and Eva to gasp.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like, shut up that is so not fair Rachel forgot too!&quot; Eva whined, sticking her finger towards her red headed friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah but you forget stuff ALL the time. Like, remember when you forgot to bring a bra to cheer try outs?&quot; Rachel laughed. &quot;You couldn&#39;t perform half the routine without your boobs bouncing all over the place. Honestly I can&#39;t believe what a ditz you are.&quot; She continued to tease.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why can&#39;t you believe she&#39;s such a ditz?&quot; Jackie asked, now flashing a coy smile at Eva.<br />
<br />
Eva looked back at Jackie confused for a moment before the realization struck her eye and a smile grew across her face.<br />
&quot;Wow Rach, so like, yeah? All Asians have to be like super smart huh?&quot; Eva grinned.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-what?! N-no of course not I-&quot; She stuttered before Eve chimed in again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Eva Yamamoto has to be SOOOO smart but I bet she&#39;s like, the worst driver on the planet too!&quot; Eva giggled, finally unable to contain her laughter.<br />
<br />
Jackie joined in too, and upon hearing this laughter Rachel swung her head back and forth at each of them before her face began to turn as red as her hair.<br />
&quot;Ugh, I hate it when you guys do that it&#39;s so mean!&quot; She yelled, clenching her fists. &quot;You know I don&#39;t mean it like that!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We know girl we know.&quot; Jackie reassured her with a hug, wrapping her arms around her shoulders.<br />
<br />
Eva saw this and felt something in her stomach... was it, jealousy? She realized she had felt it before when Rachel had kissed... had kissed... who had she kissed again? There was a vague memory in Eva&#39;s head of Rachel kissing some boy, but when was that? She brushed it off, pushing these feelings to the side. She had no desire to explore her sexuality like that right now, which was her best guess at what it was. Instead she ignored it, and hugged Rachel around her waist.<br />
<br />
&quot;We loooove you bestie!&quot; Eva added, hugging tight and emphasizing the word bestie to reassure herself.<br />
<br />
Rachel felt torn. Why was the feeling of her two best friends hugging her... making her flustered? They did this all the time. She had known them for years now. They met online on the Universities website, and were close as sisters throughout freshman year and the first half of sophomore year. They talked boys, cried together with romantic movies.... they went out in tight dresses, rushed the same sorority together, hell they were even the reason she met Tyler... so why was this feeling happening now? And why was Eve calling her bestie the only part she didn&#39;t like?<br />
<br />
She shook the feelings off, and at the sam time pushed her friends off of her.<br />
&quot;Okay okay I love you too.&quot; She sighed, finally feeling her face cool down. &quot;Wasn&#39;t there a reason we all came to dicks?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cause they feel so good?&quot; Jackie quietly whispered. She loved those kind of jokes.... but, for a brief moment she felt it was wrong? &quot;Hmm, weird.&quot; She thought before easily dismissing it.<br />
<br />
Eva laughed, then covered her mouth and Rachel began to blush again before rolling her eyes.<br />
&quot;God Jackie you need to get laid already, get your mind out of the gutter!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I&#39;m in no rush.&quot; Jackie laughed. &quot;The soccer team meet isn&#39;t until Friday, and all we need is a spare ball.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OMG that&#39;s right!&quot; Eva gasped. &quot;I, like, have to get pom poms by this afternoon!&quot; She then began to look around frantically. &quot;Do they even sell them here! Oh gosh I&#39;m gonna so get in trouble.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Relax relax Eva.&quot; Rachel consoled her friend. &quot;I&#39;m sure they do. Look, my swim meet&#39;s later today and I need new goggles by then too. Let&#39;s look together okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Eva sniffed, holding back tears. &quot;Okay, thanks Rach!&quot; She laughed, wiping them away before hugging her friend.<br />
<br />
Again, both girls felt off. Rachel wanted to hug Eva harder, while Eva felt like holding Rachel&#39;s hand. Both girls didn&#39;t know that what they wer experiencing were echoes of a reality that now never was, an alternate world where they had been a straight couple... the unfortunate side affect of too many changes to themselves to rapidly. For the feeling to go away, they&#39;d need to either return to their original forms or stay in a single form for more than a few minutes... <br />
<br />
But, that was gonna be a little harder than it should be.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, hey Eva can I check out that old camera again!&quot; Jackie called out, gesturing towards the camera still held tightly by Eva.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... uh, like sure.&quot; Eva responded. &quot;I forgot I even had it.&quot; She muttered as she handed it over.<br />
<br />
While Eva seemed nonchalant about it, internally she felt odd. She normally didn&#39;t care about sharing her things with her besties, so why was something in the back of her head making her feel like this old thing was important?<br />
<br />
Eva let go of Rachel as the two walked side by side, both starting to feel a little more secure in who they were and with their own memories. Jackie, meanwhile, had only transformed once, so after a brief feeling of oddness she was totally fine. She was looking it over, and noticed a whole bunch of options to choose from... but none of them made sense?<br />
<br />
The target&#39;s and user&#39;s awareness was flicked to off... whatever that meant, but there was another mode it was set to... random. The other modes sounded like crazy talk. Twinning, blend-in, role swap, fusion?! There were even little options next to those ones that were numbered. None of this made any sense to Jackie. The only thing that looked normal was the button to take a picture.<br />
<br />
She figured that maybe she should try it out, and see if anything would happen that was different from a normal camera... and that&#39;s when...</p>
