<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;GIVE... IT...TO...MEEEE!!&quot; Nathan yelled at Jeff while he tries to take the banana hammock from Jeff&#39;s hairy thighs. Usually when they fight, Nathan has a big advantage over his little brother and it was quite easy for him to do anything he wants with the boy. However, this time he was struggling a lot more because Jeff was as big and strong as him now, since he turned from a preteen into a young man.<br />
<br />
&quot;I WON&#39;T!!&quot; Jeff shouted back. He felt a lot of more energy and strength that made him think he can overpower his big brother for once. Also, he definitely didn&#39;t want to get naked, so he was giving it all to keep the fabric on its place. &quot;LEAVE ME ALONE!!&quot; He yelled and pushed Nathan with so much strength that he fell to the ground. Jeff can&#39;t believe he won and was astounded watching his brother stepping up from the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow! You beat me.&quot; Nathan told his little brother. &quot;I did.&quot; Jeff replied while he stared at his hands, despite he felt disgusted of seeing the hair that poke out from his knuckles, he closed his fists to feel the strength he now can get from them. &quot;I beat you. I mean, I actually beat my big brother for the first time in my life!!&quot; His astounding was turning into happiness and he suddenly made a double biceps to show off his new muscles.<br />
<br />
&quot;You did.&quot; Nathan said who noticed that his brother was distracted by his recent victory that he took the chance to make a quick move and slip down the thong from Jeff&#39;s crotch. It happened so fast that Jeff was still making his pose when he looked down and noticed that a very thick and wild bush of pubic hair was sporting between his legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit!! That thing is huge!!&quot; Nathan shouted and Jeff thought he was talking about his hairy crotch but, in fact, Nathan was staring at the huge schlong that was swaying between Jeff&#39;s thighs. Normally, a man would shave his pubes to make his dick look bigger but it wasn&#39;t necessary in Jeff&#39;s case. He was so endowed that people could think he&#39;s half horse. He blushed so much that his red cheeks were visible through his thick beard.<br />
<br />
&quot;DAMNIT!!&quot; Those were Jeff&#39;s only words before he ran away from Nathan and hid in the bathroom. He was so embarrassed that he was also crying a little. &quot;You&#39;re an asshole!! A big fucking asshole!!&quot; Jeff yelled with so much anger that his voice boomed through the whole apartment. &quot;Oh, come on, Jeffy!&quot; Nathan said as he approached the bathroom&#39;s door. &quot;That&#39;s nothing to be ashamed of. Instead, you should be proud. Any lady would kill to get some of that meat!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;FUCK OFF!!&quot; Jeff replied and Nathan realized his little brother needed some time to assimilate the situation. So much had happened to his body in a very short time that he was freaking out. Meanwhile, Nathan stared at the banana hammock that he managed to take from Jeff&#39;s thighs. It was big, well, it has if it needs to hold that monster. He smiled while he wondered if he would get that big if he wears it.<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s just one way to know it!&quot; He told himself while he put his pants and underwear down in a quick move. He glanced at his dick, he was on the average side and a little curved to the left as a result of his daily jacking off sessions at morning and night. He had recently shaved his crotch to help it look bigger, so he wondered if the hammock would do something to his body hair like it did to Jeff.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here goes nothing!!&quot; He shouted while he put the banana hammock between his legs. The pouch was definitely too big for his little buddy but he expected it would grow to fit in. He was admiring his crotch when he heard the bathroom door opening. Jeff was coming out with a towel barely covering his nudity. &quot;N-Nathan... something is wrong!!&quot; He stammered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, yeah. I know. You&#39;re older, you&#39;re hairy, you&#39;re as hung as a horse.&quot; Nathan replied without taking his sight from his crotch. &quot;No-no.&quot; Jeff stammered again. &quot;Something is happening to my feet!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your feet?&quot; Nathan asked and when he took his eyes from his dick to look at Jeff&#39;s feet he immediately noticed what happened. &quot;Oh my!! Your feet!!&quot; He put his and on his mouth. &quot;They&#39;re like hands!! They look like monkey feet!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes! And look at my ears!!&quot; Jeff shouted while he ran to the mirror. &quot;They&#39;re bigger! Like monkey ears!!&quot; You can notice that panic was growing through his voice. &quot;I&#39;m turning into monkey! I&#39;m turning into a monkey since the moment you took the thong from me!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No way!&quot; Nathan replied. &quot;It means you need it back! Take it!!&quot; He started to undress but he was stopped by Jeff. &quot;Nat, look!! You&#39;re getting hairy just like me!!&quot; Jeff pointed at Nathan&#39;s chest were a thick pelt of hair had sprouted out like grass. Nathan pushed Jeff to look at himself in the mirror and noticed that he also had grown a thick beard and his pubes were poking out from his thong just like Jeff a moment ago.<br />
<br />
When he looked down he was agape, he didn&#39;t notice when his dick went from average to pornstar but now it was stretching the hammock pouch like it wasn&#39;t big enough to hold it in. At first, he was so impressed and happy of the changes. Like Jeff, he wasn&#39;t a fan of body hair but he can shave it off, but that dick definitely was a real massive weapon.<br />
<br />
However his happiness dissipated quickly when he heard some groans coming from Jeff who was squatting next to the toilet. &quot;Jeff, are you ok?&quot; Nathan asked bu Jeff was in so much pain to answer, it seems he need to poop and he screamed as if he was pushing but instead a long and hairy tail was coming out from his butt. &quot;Oh no! This is bad!&quot; Nathan said. &quot;If you keep changing, you&#39;re going to become a full monkey in no time!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uuurgh!!&quot; Jeff groaned. &quot;I know!!&quot; He managed to say when the tail finally came out. &quot;I need the banana hammock back!! Maybe it will reverse the transformation.&quot; He said while he grabbed his new tail with his hands. &quot;But, now that I&#39;ve wore it...if you take it off from me, won&#39;t I turn into a monkey as well?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t care!&quot; Jeff replied. &quot;I told you to don&#39;t take it but you didn&#39;t hear me! I need it back!!&quot; Jeff suddenly jumped on Nathan and they started to fight again. &quot;I&#39;ve already got hairy and older, Nathan! I don&#39;t want to become into a monkey too!!&quot; Jeff yelled while he put his hands on Nathan&#39;s waist. &quot;I don&#39;t want to be a monkey neither! And you need me to contact Jeremy&#39;s girlfriend!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I said I DON&#39;T CARE!!&quot; Jeff yelled while he pulled the banana hammock down and exposed Nathan&#39;s huge dick at the same time. However, none of them noticed that the fabric had begun to tear.</p>
