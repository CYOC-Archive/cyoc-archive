<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alberto awoke to himself coughing as he opened his eyes to see himself outdoors, the night sky appearing above him. He smelled a strange smell as he took notice of the joint in his left hand. The aroma slowly overtakes him as he put the joint toward his lips and take a huff unconsciously.<br />
<br />
Alberto begins to cough once more feeling a bit light headed and confused from the weed. Looking at his surroundings he was currently sitting on a lawn chair in the balcony of a house. Most likely the back yard considering the dense forests surrounding the area. Besides the necklace, Alberto was completely nude but why he was naked? He had no idea nor did he have any idea what the odd sensation he felt from his ass. Placing a finger near his ass he felt something hard and rubbery before figuring out. “A d-dildo! What the hell man?” Alberto spouted slowly.<br />
<br />
His form of communicating had clearly changed and the weed didn’t seem to be helping. Alberto felt his ass tighten at the realization he had a dislocated inside him and moaned from the pleasure. Alberto might have no idea what was going on but as always he was unable to ignore any sensations of arousal. <br />
<br />
With the moons lighting he was able to make out his body. He was clearly now tall as his limbs seemed to stretch further than he remembered along with being more wiry than he remembered. But he definitely did have some muscle definition if the furry pectorals and six pack below said anything. He would have to guess he had the same definition as of a skater, somewhat muscular but mostly thin and wiry.<br />
<br />
Alberto felt his hair drape on his shoulders as he took notice of the long hair tickling his back. A set of long light brown hair reached past his shoulders to the center of his back. It matched his body hair which seemed to cover most of his body leaving him averagely hairy but not excessive. However his pubes seemed to be another story, as a messy bush of brown curls made way to a seven inch uncircumcised dick standing at full mast.<br />
<br />
Still confused, Alberto took his long thin fingers towards the tip of his cock and pushes the foreskin down. Releasing his dick, he felt the night air touch his dick as he shivered in delight. “F-fuck… I have to like fuckin’ cum now!” Alberto said.<br />
<br />
He began to stroke himself softly as he remembered the dildo inside of him. Lifting himself slowly, Alberto felt the dildo fall out, the suction end still stuck to the chair. Standing at his full height, Alberto struggled to keep his balance now clearly well over six feet. He took notice of the two houses next to him and felt himself become more aroused. What would happened if they caught him? Would they say something like “That’s disgusting Jim!” Or would they never speak to him again?<br />
<br />
Somehow the idea of being caught made him more erect as Jim, now that he could remember his name, realized he enjoyed exhibitionism. The idea of being caught at any moment gave him such a thrill and it also felt good to smoke outside. So it was like two birds and one stone. Jim made his way back to the dildo and lowered his body to feel it readjust into his accustomed asshole. <br />
<br />
Making sure to take a few more hits in between, Jim felt himself become more dazed as he fucked himself with his old dildo and continued to breathe in the alluring familiar smoke. He felt his long hair shift and tickle his body from his constant movement from fucking himself along with necklace hitting his chest from the rapid thrusts. Eventually becoming more and more tired, Jim unstuck the dildo and grasping it in his right hand he spread his long legs up in the air, exposing his asshole perfectly for his toy.<br />
<br />
Jim spent a bit more time using his dildo, as old memories of relaxing after a hard day of work or hanging out with friends was always an outdoor fuck and smoke session. Jim placed the joint down as he took his left hand to stroke his lightly hairy pecs and rub his nipples which were a bit smaller than he was used to. But he wasn’t sure if it was due to his larger size that they felt so small or his disorientation from the weed. Either way he moaned as he continued to play with himself from the dildo and exploring his new body.<br />
<br />
The weed had already kicked in giving him the familiar high feeling he was used to. But along with the masturbation and exhibitionism, Jim felt as he was getting to enjoy three different types of pleasure at once. Jim lost himself feeling spaced out as he perpetually continues to insert his dildo into himself.<br />
<br />
Suddenly…</p>
