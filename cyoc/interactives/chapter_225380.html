<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Luckily since you’re young, you recover quite easily from the ordeal. <br />
<br />
Physically. <br />
<br />
You weren’t quite sure if you were had recovered mentally from everything. Especially now that you were free from Sam and could think clearly.<br />
<br />
Sitting up, you watch the wizards around you breathing heavily as they show exhaustion either from the magic or sex they had just finished. It gets more awkward as minutes pass and you find yourself still naked and sitting in a dark room full of naked older men. Then again their age was probably the reason they were taking so long to recover.<br />
<br />
Eventually your Uncle gets up before helping Boris up. Willy seems to have no problem getting himself back on his feet and turns on the lights. They all turn to look at you as you chuckle awkwardly.<br />
<br />
“Listen I’m really sorry about everything…” you apologize. “I just wanted to know what you were all doing.”<br />
<br />
You turn to face your Uncle. “Uncle Jack. I’m really sorry. All of this got way out of hand. I should’ve never used your prototype without your permission.” You lower your head in shame. “But at least I decided to own up to my actions and stay here and not run away while all of you were recuperating.”<br />
<br />
You give them a small grin but nobody smiles.<br />
<br />
“This boy definitely reminds me of you.” Willy says as he shakes his head disapprovingly.<br />
<br />
“I must admit… I did get into my fair share of trouble as a young lad,” Jack says.<br />
<br />
“That’s an understatement” Willy says with a chuckle.<br />
<br />
Your Uncle glares at him before continuing. “But I was always reprimanded with fair punishments to learn over time.”<br />
<br />
“P-p-punishment?” You stammer, “Wasn’t all this plenty enough?”<br />
<br />
“I must admit I feel quite pleased,” Boris says as he grins ear to ear. “It’s been a long time since I had my own ass eaten out so nicely.”<br />
<br />
You let out a small gag as you remember your previous actions with Boris’ ass. You shudder and try to take your mind off it.<br />
<br />
“I agree. This was definitely a more… memorable experience than our usual reunions.” Willy states.<br />
<br />
“Nevertheless, I still think John deserves a small punishment for his transgression.” Jack says as he walks away from you.<br />
<br />
“You’re not mad about all the mean things I said are you? Trust me! The ghost made me say all those hurtful things.” You plead as your Uncle picks up the social camouflage suit.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry I believe you.” He places the prototype on the counter. “And I forgive you. Just as I hope you can forgive me for what I had to do to dispel the spirit.”<br />
<br />
“Oh! Y-yeah… don’t worry Uncle Jack it’s no big deal. I know you didn’t have much of a choice,” you awkwardly respond. You can still feel his load within your ass. “Besides it was all my fault to begin with.”<br />
<br />
“I appreciate your forgiveness John. Know that it means a lot to me.” Jack says before he whispers something into Boris ear. Boris nods his head and walks over to Willy before whispering something in his ear.<br />
<br />
The three of them are soon huddled at the counter with their backs facing toward you. You can hear some slight noises as they resonate throughout the room. Once the sounds finish, you find them turn back toward you with a familiar blue robe in Uncle Jack’s hand.<br />
<br />
“Uncle Jack? What are you planning to do with that robe?” You asked worried. You didn’t like where this was headed.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry, this isn’t the prototype.” Jack dismisses your biggest concern. “With Willy’s and Boris’ help I copied your prior form from the prototype and made it into a new costume.”<br />
<br />
“But… why?” You wonder. None of this added up to you but you still found yourself left with an uneasy feeling.<br />
<br />
“Because you need to be a certain age to go where we’re going.” Jack respond nonchalantly as he walks over to you and hands you the robe.<br />
<br />
Grasping the robe, memories of being Sam come flooding back to you along with feelings of disgust. “Wh-what if I don’t put it on?”<br />
<br />
“Trust me John. My first idea for a punishment is WAY more fair than my second idea.” Jack says with a sly smirk.<br />
<br />
You shudder and jump off the table. “Well at least it’s something to wear,” You think as you put the blue robe on. Your clothes had completely vanished after using the suit. Perhaps from one of its’ flaws? And you were getting a bit uncomfortable still being nude.<br />
<br />
You completely put the robe on. At first it appears to be too big on you, but you find yourself growing into it. <br />
<br />
No really.<br />
<br />
You find yourself growing until you reach the same height as your uncle. Your legs and arms lengthening until the robe feels more well suited. Honestly, if the transformation ended here, you wouldn’t have any complaints. But you knew it was merely beginning.<br />
<br />
A small layer of fat ripples through your body as you become more… well… fat. Your small beer belly returns along with your pair of soft pecs. You can feel the soft layer of fat cover your body as your arms and legs thicken. However, you can also feel an increase in muscle course throughout your body.<br />
<br />
You feel firm and strong but a little overweight. Currently you resembled a husky frat boy who liked to drink. But more changes were still to come.<br />
<br />
You feel hair begin to erupt over your body as a layer of body hair begins to entirely cover your previously semi-smooth body. Before long you had the average amount of body hair a middle aged man would have covering your body.<br />
<br />
You also had the average hairline an older man would have as you feel your hairline recede leaving you with a more prominent forehead.<br />
<br />
The changes begin to finish as you feel your skin become to roughen from wear and age as small crow’s feet form near your eyes. Your temples also become slightly gray but your hair turns a darker shade of brown, which you can only assume spread to your body hair as well.<br />
<br />
Finally, you feel a wave of age wash over you as you feel less energetic and much older. In the end, your average middle aged body had returned. Minus Sam of course.<br />
<br />
“I don’t get it. What was the whole point of this?” You ask in your deeper voice.<br />
<br />
“It’s simple. Since you wanted to see and be with us wizards so badly I decided to trap you as one. You’ll find you’re unable to revert even if you disrobe yourself.” Jack explains.<br />
<br />
“Wait! So I’m stuck like this?” You look at your middle aged body.<br />
<br />
“Only until we finish our errand. I’ll turn you back once we return. I promise.” Jack says as he begins to place his robe back on.<br />
<br />
You turn and find yourself surprised to see Willy and Boris back to their altered forms and already wearing their robes and hats. Did they change while you were also changing?<br />
<br />
“So where are we going?” You ask, remembering your Uncle mentioning the age requirement from before.<br />
<br />
“About that..,” Jack said as he altered his appearance back to before. You saw no reason for him to as it barely changed anything but you kept your mouth shut.<br />
<br />
“We’re going to…”</p>
