<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">li and Cory had a room to share, one of a bunch that the team had been assigned along the same hall. They were watching a cop show on TV when Coach knocked.<br />
<br />
Ali was about to say something, but stopped. Williams had a tall pair of kangaroo ears with red fuzz. He said, &quot;How&#39;re you doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh. Okay?&quot; said Cory. What was Coach doing with those?<br />
<br />
&quot;I had lunch with Sandra. She&#39;s a great gal. Since we&#39;re stuck here with her group, I thought she could lead the team in some exercises this afternoon.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ali laughed. &quot;I hope she&#39;s not planning on getting tackled.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing like that. Yoga.&quot; Coach held up a hand to forestall their protests. &quot;It&#39;s good for stretching and balance. See you for practice!&quot; He headed out, ears bobbing.<br />
<br />
When he was gone, Ali and Cory looked at each other. &quot;Did you see that?&quot; asked Ali.<br />
<br />
&quot;The ears. So they gave him a headband and he put it on for fun? Is Coach a furry now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is gonna sound weird, but... I didn&#39;t see his actual ears under his hair. And the roo ones moved.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cory blinked. &quot;I think I saw that too. And you know, the women had their tails swishing, like, on their own.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You were checking out their tails?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s hard not to.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two of them waited for practice time. Normally they&#39;d have gone out to the field and practiced throws and tackles, and at this resort Cory had planned to go out on the big lawn they had and do a little of the same thing. But instead, the group was starting to file out of their rooms to do yoga.<br />
<br />
Rock in particular looked annoyed. &quot;You see Coach?&quot; he demanded of Cory.<br />
<br />
&quot;The ears?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rock nodded. &quot;It&#39;s fine if we&#39;ve gotta do exercises named for that Star Wars guy, but the animal thing is freaky.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then ask him why?&quot; said Ali.<br />
<br />
&quot;No way. If that exercise chick put him up to it, I don&#39;t wanna make fun of him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cory said, &quot;Whatever.&quot; He still wasn&#39;t sure what they&#39;d walked into, though.<br />
<br />
They went together to the lobby, where Sandra waited with one of the cow women. &quot;Good afternoon! Your coach has asked me to work with you. I&#39;d like to split you up into two groups. Half with me, half with Celia here. Count off, please.&quot;<br />
<br />
The team grumbled about the schedule change and having women in charge of football training. Coach said, &quot;It&#39;s okay, guys; I asked for this. It&#39;s good to vary your schedule, you know. There are pro players who do ballet, so how can you complain?&quot;<br />
<br />
Reluctantly the team counted off by ones and twos. That put Cory in the roo Sandra&#39;s group and Ali over in Celia&#39;s, with Rock joining Cory. Rock teased Ali, &quot;Moo.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, laugh it up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cory and Rock headed into a room covered in gym mats, with mirrors on the walls. Sandra smiled at the gaggle of men in shorts and t-shirts, ready to take orders from her if not very happy about it. &quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll get into it. Yoga will be great for the team; you&#39;ll see! Now let&#39;s get started with some warmup stretches.&quot; Her words were relaxing, Cory noted, almost hypnotic...<br />
<br />
Some of the exercises were normal. Toe-touching, leg stretching, leaning, twisting. Sandra called some of the moves by silly names but getting limber was at least worthwhile. Then, though, she got weird.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stomach stretch!&quot; she declared in the same hypnotic tone. She demonstrated by pulling up her t-shirt to reveal that she even had fur on her stomach under her clothes. That was some serious dedication to costuming, especially to dress that way while exercising. And... there was a pouch on her like an actual kangaroo. From where he stood in the back of the room he couldn&#39;t see how it was attached. Sort of a skin-tight leotard maybe.<br />
<br />
&quot;To demonstrate, I&#39;ll need a volunteer!&quot; Sandra said before coaxing the team&#39;s running back Josh, up to the front to demonstrate. A typical &#39;bro&#39; Josh was pack with muscle but lacked brains. Always a man&#39;s man, he seemed uncertain at the front - a yoga demonstration was far from his comfort zone.  &quot;Now this stretch is a tad intimiate, but don&#39;t worry....its certainly worth it.&quot; she cooed. &quot;Mmmkay&quot; replied Josh with uncertainty as he rubbed his hand through his short cropped hair.  A few snickers crossed the room as his equally masculine friends enjoyed Josh&#39;s discomfort. <br />
<br />
Reaching under his shirt, Sandra gently pulled it up and off him. &quot;I&#39;ll need you shirtless to demonstrate&quot;<br />
<br />
To begin, she lightly traced her paws over his thick pecs, moving steadily down his centerline. &quot;You sure have built up a formidable body&quot; she whispered &quot;I bet all this muscle sure restricts your movement and in the yogic spirit we believe such flashy masculinity to be a hinderance to embracing the feminine aspects of your soul. A challenge to be sure, and one we&#39;ll tackle in future sessions. For now, however, we focus on flexibility. Lets begin the stomach streach&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um...okay&quot; Josh replied, his mind feeling somewhat woozy as her paw sent pleasurable tingles up his spine. <br />
<br />
Then, without warning she began rubbing and tugging along his stomach. Cory frowned; she&#39;d be kind of cute if she&#39;d ditch the costume, but this was was just... inappropriate. The man at first looked a little embarrassed and unsure but a s she fumbled with his stomach Cory saw his uncertainty melt into a look of pleasure. Gently she began to stroke along the lower half of his stomach, a massage like motion that caused him to unintentionally let out a light moan. Cory couldn&#39;t help but notice a faint pulsing outline in his crotch - an obvious erection formed in response to her ministrations. Then, without warning, her hand seemed to sink *in* to him as a small pouch began to form.   His moans grew loader as his tounge fell from his mouth in inexplicable pleasure. With a steady pressure, she pressed her hand outward gently streching his skin and widening a thick pocket of skin. <br />
<br />
Cory noticed a slight damp spot  form on his crotch. His face soon fell into one of delirious bliss.  Moments later, she  let go of the poor running back and he stumbled back to his mat we a dull grin on his face. To Cory&#39;s shock, the others didn&#39;t laugh, gasp or hardly even react. Instead,  everybody just started doing the same &quot;exercise&quot; on their own. Almost as if they were under a hypnotic spell.<br />
<br />
He watched the others trying it, but didn&#39;t join in. Didn&#39;t make sense to him. Beside him, the puzzled Rock rubbed along his bare stomach and the skin there seemed to darken, stretching, sort of folding and splitting in a bloodless horizontal line. Rock wasn&#39;t watching his own hands as he worked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you all right?&quot; said Sandra, suddenly beside Cory. &quot;Here, let me show you.&quot; Before Cory could object, she began rubbing along his middle through his shirt. Her touch was warm and firm, seeming to dig into him like a massage. It startled him and within seconds she was done, stepping back. &quot;See, like that. Try it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cory paused, open-mouthed, wondering what he&#39;d find if he pulled up his shirt. Slowly he did so, and found a patch of grey fuzz along his skin, where he now sported a warm slot that he could pull forward. He stared down into a pocket formed from his own skin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, yoga is always hard for beginners&quot; she hypnotically cooed in his ear as she began rubbing the crease of his pouch causing pleasure to spike up his spine and his cock to harden. &quot;But I&#39;ll help you relax and enjoy the ride. <br />
<br />
The rest of the class was a pleasurable blur, and later he found he didn&#39;t much remember the rest of the class.</p>
