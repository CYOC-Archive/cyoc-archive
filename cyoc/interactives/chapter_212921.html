<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff sauntered down the hall, the tight little mink Prince clinging to his side. <br />
<br />
The imperious furball might think ‘Geoffrey’ was submissive manservant, but he was completely wrong. Jeff could feel Gregory’s cheek snuggling deep into his fur – a feeling that made it clear  that he was the one truly wielding all the power in their relationship. <br />
<br />
Of course, Jeff realized, Gregory was a much better thinker than him.  Which wasn&#39;t to say that Jeff thought himself to be stupid – <br />
<br />
Fragments of a memory bubbled up through a seemingly impenetrable wall in his mind.  He had a vague recollection of having been born to a tribe of ice fishers in the frozen north.  He remembered a brief snippet of the chief saying how smart he was when he’d showed everyone else how to use a sharpened stick, rather than their claws, to burrow through the ice.<br />
<br />
“Such smart cub!” the Chief had said in a slow, methodical manner, “tribe catch many fish.”<br />
<br />
No, Jeff wasn’t stupid.  Being around Gregory made it obvious how slow his thoughts were in comparison, and sometimes made him embarrassed to have to use his claws to count numbers.  But quick thoughts weren’t what made someone smart, just what made them royal.  <br />
<br />
What made someone smart in this line of work was the ability to size up an opponent.  To know when to fight and when to back down.  From that perspective, Jeff felt that it was he who was the genius, and Gregory who was the bumbling moron.<br />
<br />
His body bounced as he walked. Not in the same way his fat rolls had, though memories of that other form now seemed a bit like a dream. No, his powerful muscles seemed to flex with every step, bringing further awareness to the polar bear at just how massive he was. Was this how Greg had felt when he was a lion barbarian?<br />
<br />
Charlie’s paws were roving over the bear’s body. Jeff glanced down at him and the wolf looked back. The polar bear winked and bounced his ass a bit more. Charlie smiled and continued running his fingers over Jeff’s ass and back before rubbing his pecs. Jeff felt oddly proud of this body. Then again, why would it be odd? He’d worked so hard for it, training every day for almost-<br />
<br />
No!<br />
<br />
Jeff shook his head. Memories were bad. He could get caught up in them and slowly cease to be himself. As long as he kept himself focused on the present, he would be fine. What he needed was to get his hands on the miniature of his old body. Then he could fix himself.<br />
<br />
They made it to their rooms and Geoffrey suddenly took over, opening the door and sweeping the rooms for hidden attackers. It was clear. He walked briskly back to his Prince and stood to the side.<br />
<br />
“Clear.” His voice boomed.<br />
<br />
“Thank you Geoffrey.” Gregory sniffed.<br />
<br />
Jeff felt his hefty cock jump as a jolt of pleasure shot through his brain. Master praised him! He closed the door behind them and walked stiffly towards the bed. His liege was already stripping, Charlie, the handsome wolf rogue, assisting the Prince. It was only after doffing his clothes that Jeff realized he’d been on autopilot and thinking Geoffrey thoughts.<br />
<br />
He shuddered in horror, though his big black ursine length didn’t wilt. If anything, it got even harder, a bead of precum appearing at the tip. Was Geoffrey…enjoying this strange torment Jeff was experiencing?<br />
<br />
Gregory hopped up into the soft downy bed, letting out a happy squeak of approval. Then he rolled over and made a come-hither gesture to Jeff and Charlie. Jeff didn’t even hesitate, he practically dove in, nuzzling his sexy little master and snuffling at his fur, inhaling the warm scent of applewood and red currant. <br />
<br />
“Geoffrey, so eager!” Gregory let out a tinkling laugh. “Position yourself over me so I can suck your cock, and raise your ass in the air.”<br />
<br />
Jeff did as the Prince commanded - not that he wasn’t extremely interested in doing that anyways.<br />
<br />
“Charles, since you were so eager to eat his ass, earlier, why don’t you do just that? And plow my hole properly while you’re at it.” The Prince demanded.<br />
<br />
Jeff felt the wolf’s hot breath puff against his pucker. The Prince’s clever little hands began stroking his rock-hard length. He felt two paws spread his firm, muscular ass cheeks apart and a soft wet tongue began firmly licking his tight ring.<br />
<br />
The bear huffed in delight and then moaned when the Prince’s tongue began to lap at his cockhead. <br />
<br />
“Charles!” Jeff cried, “M-my liege!”<br />
<br />
The randy bear’s cries of desperate need were answered with sucking and then, pleasantly, fucking. From the doorway, a tall, black-furred deer with golden antlers and white spots freckling his hide chuckled. His own pink tapered cock was hard and he stroked himself to the trio.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br />
<br />
Charlie ate out the bear’s delicious ass. <br />
<br />
Normally, he’d be grossed out, but Geoffrey’s hole was impeccably cleaned. His cock was buried deep in Gregory’s tight tailhole, the mink writhing beneath him. Muscles in that warm, moist orifice clenched and squeezed his dick, milking the wolf.<br />
<br />
He didn’t know how long he’d be able to hold out. While Charlie was a virgin back on Earth, his new wolf body was apparently very experienced- knowing exactly how to thrust to pleasure Gregory, and how to bring the bear to a panting orgasm with just his tongue.  <br />
<br />
Was this part of his assassins training?  A skill he had learned to let himself get closer to his targets? Or perhaps the result Finn altering his backstory so that the three of them had been long-term lovers in this new life? <br />
<br />
Whatever the source, Charlie’s body was on complete autopilot as it continued to lick, suck, and hump with the skill of a practiced escort. But for all of his body’s apparent skill, Charlie could feel a pressure building inside of himself, and realized that he had no idea how to keep himself from cumming.<br />
<br />
So with a howl muffled by the polar bear’s globular asscheeks, he came inside the Prince.<br />
<br />
“Oh, someone’s too overstimulated!” Gregory laughed.<br />
<br />
The bear grunted and unloaded all over the mink’s face, the translucent strands blending into the mink’s fur. <br />
<br />
“You two are acting so inexperienced-oh! Ah!” Gregory’s pink tongue was lapping the bear spunk from his muzzle when his own cock twitched and spurt after spurt of his royal seed splattered on his long abdomen.<br />
<br />
The three collapsed on each other, breathing hard.<br />
<br />
“I guess we miss each other.” Charlie gasped, tongue lapping his muzzle, tasting Geoffrey’s ass…<br />
<br />
“Let me taste him.” Prince Gregory said.<br />
<br />
The mink leaned over and lapped Charlie’s muzzle, licking Geoffrey’s juices off his nose. <br />
<br />
“Ah, you taste good, Geoffrey. Now clean me!” Gregory demanded.<br />
<br />
The bear didn’t need to be asked twice. <br />
<br />
He immediately started grooming the mink with his thick tongue. Gregory closed his eyes and sighed happily, laying back in the blankets. Jeff cleaned off the mink’s face, made his way down his tight abs, and then dutiful sucked the mink’s pink cock clean.<br />
<br />
“Excellent work, Geoffrey.” The Prince yawned before snuggling close to the polar bear’s chest.<br />
<br />
Charlie was feeling very exhausted, and though he wanted to ask Jeff about his memories of Earth, he was too tired. He wrapped the prince and the bear in his arms and ran his paws through the mink’s silky fur.<br />
<br />
“All mine,” He whispered.<br />
<br />
“No.” Gregory muttered. “You’re mine.”<br />
<br />
“Yes, my liege.” Charlie smiled as they nuzzled themselves to sleep.<br />
<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br />
<br />
Sounds of something hissing and clunking woke Charlie up. <br />
<br />
He wasn’t used to having such sensitive hearing, so this wasn’t unusual. The cold light of dawn was pouring through the windows, revealing Geoffrey in a corner of the room, his arm running back and forth over a thick wooden board.  In his hand was an odd piece of metal – it had a wide, flat bottom that tapered up into a handle at the top.  <br />
<br />
Geoffrey was running the object over a set of rich silken clothes, and each time he lifted it up, Charlie could see a dim purple glow emanating from the bottom as steam magically hissed from small vents on the underside.  Geoffrey was ironing their clothes, Charlie realized, using a magic clothes iron.  No doubt that this was an expensive trinket, but one that Gregory had insisted was a vital necessity in his bid to retake his kingdom.<br />
<br />
“Well, he wouldn’t look very princelike in wrinkled clothes,” Charlie chuckled to himself.  Plus, it was an interesting artifact to find in a place like this – the people of this world had managed to use magic to duplicate a small piece of modern technology, which raised the question of how many other, similar items were like that here. . <br />
<br />
Geoffrey slowly ran the iron back and forth until the clothing was in pristine shape.  Then he folded it and packed it away in a nearby suitcase, before picking up another garment and repeating the process.  Charlie watched him work, memorized by the methodic, almost robotic movements of a professional manservant.  <br />
<br />
The cute little mink next to him mumbled something and rolled over, dainty paws clinging to Charlie’s biceps. Charlie bent down, kissed the Prince on his forehead, and gingerly extracted himself from the mink’s grasp. Then he slowly and carefully got out of bed, making sure not to awaken the still-sleeping Prince.<br />
<br />
Charlie padded softly over to the Polar Bear. <br />
<br />
Geoffrey was still as massive and well-muscled as ever but his one good eye was half-lidded. Clearly he was drowsy, but getting up early must be normal for the bear. Geoffrey’s gaze flicked up to the wolf and a smile twisted his black lips.<br />
<br />
“Hello Charles,” Geoffrey’s voice rumbled softly.<br />
<br />
“I wanted to catch you alone.” Charlie whispered to the polar bear. “We need to talk.”<br />
<br />
Geoffrey was ironing out clothing for the Prince. Apparently, he’d left his belongings here in case he wanted his old life back. Considering how deep the Tailoring had been with Jeff and Greg, that was highly unlikely.<br />
<br />
“About what, Charlie?” The bear rumbled, folding clothes and packing them away. He lifted a heavy brow and glanced meaningfully at the still-slumbering form of the Prince. “We must speak quietly. I don’t-I mean, Geoffrey doesn’t want me to wake him.”<br />
<br />
“Are you still in there?” Charlie leaned forward.<br />
<br />
“Of course!” Jeff scoffed. Then the bear’s thick brows lowered, covering his eyes. “But it’s super annoying! I can’t disobey any of that sexy mink’s orders. Worse, I get the strangest boner when I follow them. Or maybe it’s the best. He smells so good-”<br />
<br />
“So you still have some memories, then?” Charlie cut the polar bear off before he could continue talking about how much he loved the Prince. Which was indicative of the identity shift having worked. Jeff would never have talked so much about someone other than himself.<br />
<br />
“Duh, wouldn’t be here otherwise.” Jeff’s heavy brows clashed together. “Why?”<br />
<br />
“I need you to write it all down. Everything Finn said to you about the game.” Charlie slid ink and parchment to Jeff.<br />
<br />
The polar bear picked up the quill awkwardly in his gnarled paws and began to write. <br />
<br />
Jeff’s penmanship was terrible. He was clearly struggling to hold the quill and, despite what appeared to be a monumental amount of effort, the chicken scratch he left behind was only legible in the most generous sense of the word. <br />
<br />
This wasn’t like Jeff – they’d gone to the same school and traded math homework all the time, so Charlie knew that Jeff wrote as dainty as a girl. These scrawling letters were definitely not like him. But the polar bear persisted, though they had to use far too much parchment.<br />
<br />
Finally, wiping sweat form his heavy brow, the bear leaned back. <br />
<br />
“There. That’s all of it.” Jeff said finally, and Charlie saw tears glittering in his good eye.<br />
<br />
“Hey,” Charlie placed a paw on Jeff’s. “If you lose yourself, I won’t judge you.”<br />
<br />
“Lose myself?” Jeff shook his head and wiped his eyes. “Not happening. I just have a hard time holding a quill for some reason.”<br />
<br />
“Sure.”<br />
<br />
“Anyways, there’s no reason to be concerned. I’ve partitioned myself from the bear’s mind.” Jeff smirked.<br />
<br />
“Liar.”<br />
<br />
“It’s true. All this menial work is something this body does automatically.” Jeff pointed at the pile of laundry. “I don’t even know the name of half the clothes in here. But here I am, folding them like a master.”<br />
<br />
“I’m glad you’re taking to this so well.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t get why you think I should be happy with this situation.” Jeff glared.<br />
<br />
“What’s to be unhappy about? You get to be a slutty bear with two boyfriends who love you.”<br />
<br />
“Wait, you…love me?”<br />
<br />
“You’re basically tailored to my tastes, so yeah.” Charlie shrugged, “How could I not? Apparently we’re in a relationship anyways, and my body gets horny every time it sees that thick cock of yours - whether I want it to or not. Might as well go all in and have some fun.”<br />
<br />
Charlie paused, “that’s your problem Jeff.  You should have been living it up in here and having the time of your life, but you were just ‘whatevering’ it.  Maybe if you’d been more like me you wouldn’t have ended up like that.  For what its worth, I’m having a blast.  If you let yourself go, maybe you would too.”<br />
<br />
“Man, I just…if I lost myself, I’d feel ashamed.”<br />
<br />
“There’s nothing to be ashamed of. Be Geoffrey.”<br />
<br />
“No, you misunderstand. I’m not ashamed about this,” The polar bear indicated his body. “I’m ashamed about losing to fucking Glitz.”<br />
<br />
“But-”<br />
<br />
“Would you two be quiet!” An irritated voice muttered from the bed. “I’m trying to sleep! Charles, come snuggle with me. Let Geoffrey perform his duties.”<br />
<br />
Charlie winked, “Duty calls~”<br />
<br />
“Yes, Charles.” The polar bear got up and began ironing and folding clothing again. <br />
<br />
Charlie climbed back into bed. The mink was waiting for him and immediately buried his snout into the wolf’s chest fluff. Charlie gently pet the mink’s silky fur. The Prince fell back to sleep just as Geoffrey finished doing the laundry.<br />
<br />
The bear clambered into bed, wrapping his arms around the mink and the wolf.<br />
<br />
“Hey, all done.” Jeff rumbled.<br />
<br />
“Good.” Charlie leaned forward and kissed the ursine on the lips.<br />
<br />
The wolf enjoyed the feeling of their long flat tongues entwining.<br />
<br />
“I’ve decided.” The bear spoke between kisses. “That I love you too.”<br />
<br />
“Wise decision.” Charlie chuckled and stroked the polar bear’s scarred muzzle. “Silly bear.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I guess I am.” Geoffrey lay his head back on the pillow and closed his eye.<br />
<br />
Charlie did the same. They were all soon fast asleep, and it was only when a knock came from their door that they woke up again. <br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br />
<br />
Everyone was dressed and ready to leave.<br />
<br />
The caravan was scheduled to depart sometime in the afternoon. Apparently, the Ferry crossing the river between the countries was booked full, so this was the earliest they could move. Most caravans liked to get to their destinations at exactly the right time, not early and certainly not late. Less time for bandits to find them.<br />
<br />
Glitz burst through the door holding a platter of eggs Benedict, though the egg yolks were scarlet and the sauce had odd seasonings to it. It tasted delightful but exotic. The various juices were interesting as well, and Charlie had the feeling the buck was putting on a show for the Prince.  Perhaps a final farewell as a way to curry favor, should the Prince succeed in his erstwhile quest.<br />
<br />
“Hey Glitz,” Charlie said while the buck was taking away their plates.<br />
<br />
“Yes?”<br />
<br />
“What are you?”<br />
<br />
“You mean, am I a fey?” Glitz smirked. “No. I’m a Ceryneian Hind.”<br />
<br />
“Oh.”<br />
<br />
“No!” the Prince’s voice cut sharply through the room. “You may not have thirds! You don’t want to end up like that fat bear, do you?”<br />
<br />
“But my liege, I’m so hungry!”<br />
<br />
“You can only have meat, then. And hit the Training Room in an hour!”<br />
<br />
“Yes my liege…” The polar bear hung his head.<br />
<br />
Charlie turned back to Glitz and saw the deer watching Jeff and smirking.<br />
<br />
“How long does he have?” Charlie asked quietly.<br />
<br />
“The bear? Oh, Within a week. He’s quite dumb, so he probably won’t even notice when he ceases to be Jeff.” Glitz shrugged. “Do you like the way they’ve turned out?”<br />
<br />
“I love them both!” Charlie’s tail wagged.<br />
<br />
“I thought you would.” Glitz gave the wolf a genuine smile. <br />
<br />
“Thanks. For everything.” Charlie paused. “Say, Gregory’s backstory. He was a twin to the heir. Went into exile after escaping prison. Did his brother try to, uh, have him ‘inhumed’ as you would put it?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, actually. However, they didn’t pay the anti-resurrection fee.”<br />
<br />
“Anti-resurrection?”<br />
<br />
“Normally, one can revive a person as long as they have a finger-sized chunk of the deceased. It just means we take the body, cremate it, then scatter the ashes.” Glitz replied.<br />
<br />
“Ah, so you ‘killed’ the Prince by Tailoring him away, then ‘revived’ him this way.”<br />
<br />
“Exactly. It’s all about semantics.” Glitz smirked.<br />
<br />
“I’ll keep that in mind.” Charlie muttered.<br />
<br />
“Say, don’t most adventuring parties have four people, at least?” Glitz asked, cocking his head.<br />
<br />
“They can have up to 6 people. But, uh…three guys didn’t show up.” Charlie frowned.<br />
<br />
“Ah, yes, people can be flaky like that. I would advise hiring at least a few more people and tailoring them if they aren’t up to snuff. You’re going to need a competent magic user and a dedicated healer.”<br />
<br />
“We can handle lower level stuff with just us three, I think.” Charlie replied. “Once we have the funds, I’ll consider hiring more people.”<br />
<br />
“One last question, if you wouldn’t mind indulging me…” Glitz asked, “who is Finn?”<br />
<br />
“What?” Charlie glanced at the deer sharply.<br />
<br />
“I’ve had several people say his name.”<br />
<br />
“A…uh…god.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, I see. A minor god, then.” Glitz smirked.<br />
<br />
“Don’t be coy.” Charlie’s eyes narrowed. “How much do you know?”<br />
<br />
“I took a gander at the fat bear’s memories. I must say, Earth sounds quite interesting.” The stag smiled, showing off his sharp incisors.<br />
<br />
“It’s really not.” Charlie looked away.<br />
<br />
A hooflet fell onto his shoulder.<br />
<br />
“You can be someone here, Charles.” Glitz said. “Have you read the backstories?”<br />
<br />
“I haven’t even read the parchments Jeff gave me.” Charlie held up the bear’s scrawlings.<br />
<br />
“You really need to read them. Make time.” Glitz warned.<br />
<br />
“Alright, I’ll read it when we get on the caravan.” Charlie smiled. “I promise.”<br />
<br />
The rest of the morning flew by. <br />
<br />
Geoffrey came huffing and puffing out of the Training Room just before noon. Charlie checked the settings and whistled. Somehow, the bear had managed to beat just as man levels as he had last night. The sweat-soaked bear padded heavily to the baths.<br />
<br />
They had lunch, which was mostly just sandwiches. <br />
<br />
“So, what about the hag?” Geoffrey asked suddenly.<br />
<br />
“What?” Charlie blinked.<br />
<br />
“She stole...that one person’s power, right?” Geoffrey said. “If we beat her, maybe we can give it to the Prince.”<br />
<br />
“What nonsense are you speaking now?” Gregory groaned. “Hags?”<br />
<br />
“No, he’s making sense. Before you were turned back into your royal highness, you were a Lion Barbarian. A hag stole your essence, turning you into a slutty catboi.” Charlie explained.<br />
<br />
“And where were you?” Gregory turned to the polar bear and demanded.<br />
<br />
“Getting sucked off by slimes, my liege,” Geoffrey bowed, hiding the smirk on his face.<br />
<br />
“You-!” Gregory clearly had no words, just glared at the bear. “Are you laughing at me?”<br />
<br />
“No, my liege.” Geoffrey rumbly voice held barely concealed laughter.<br />
<br />
“Guys, focus!” Charlie hissed. The mink and the bear turned to him. “We get back that essence and we can make you really strong, Gregory!”<br />
<br />
“I’m already pretty strong…” Gregory murmured.<br />
<br />
“And we’ll get a Coin for doing it.” Charlie said, baiting the hook.<br />
<br />
“Can we even take out a hag?” Gregory asked, biting his lip.<br />
<br />
“Can you even take out a prince?” Charlie asked pointedly.<br />
<br />
“Fair point.” the mink drew his hands together. “How do we find her and how do we kill her?”<br />
<br />
“I’m glad you asked.” Charlie smirked and laid out his plan.</p>
