<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Hello, my name is sage. (As far as you know;)any way. I have decided to write this recap page as filler while I try to think up new story for crier wolf. this first section is about the characters.<br />
<br />
Cynthia (aka you): an average 15 year old girl with a few friends. Your parents were the ones suggested you go to camp. You have a flawless olive skin tone with black hair and gold highlights. You have an average body type and are 5ft 4in. you have brown eyes. Your family is upper middle class, father is a cop, mother in politics, and your hometown is Lynnwood, WA. You have above average grades and love music and hopes to one day change the world. Hates/fears fire.<br />
<br />
Rachel Arnolds: I have already given a brief history of Rachel in a previous chapter. Other info includes, hometown, Bellevue, WA while with father. Monroe, WA after adoption. 15 years old. Unpopular while at school. Smart but only average grades because of some fights. She had begun archery a year before she came to camp. She is 5ft 8in, pale white skin. Orange red hair, freckles, and hazel eyes. Thin body type. Her parents sent her to camp in an attempt to help her relax.<br />
<br />
Tina nulls: I have decided to keep W.G.L'S description of Tina, both human and werewolf. She is 14 and vary popular at school with high grades. She was the one who wanted to come to camp crier wolf, thinking it would help her conquer her fear of the wilderness. Her hometown is Lynnwood, WA. (I know what your thinking and no. she and Cynthia never met. Lynnwood was just the town where the campers were all picked up. ok.) She meets Rachel on the bus and the 2 talked. Tina had a sheltered life, her father died when she was 4, her mother didn’t take it to hard though for she was vary pre occupied with her career as a college professor. She remarried 2 years later and had a son. Tina loves candy and is beginning to study fashion.<br />
<br />
Jean noiro: I am afraid that I currently cannot reveal too much about jean. She will have a vary large part to play in this story and I don't want to reveal that now. I can say that she is at camp to spy on the werewolves for her father. She is 14. Her body type is average with some small muscle. She has black skin. Black hair in pigtails (I mistook them for braids in her intro chapter) glasses, and always wears a none camp issue red hoodie. (I will refer to this as a jacket) she likes art. Jean is also the only non bi sexual and non werewolf character so far revealed.<br />
<br />
Brittany hubson: a snotty, rich girl who inherited her lyncrophy condition from her parents. She attends a privet school in her home town of Tacoma WA. Half of her family fortune was gained over a period of several hundred years, the rest from her parent’s energy company. Brittany’s 2 lackeys were from Tacoma, they are the kids of her servants. Her body type is in between average and thin. She has white skin, dark blond hair, and gray eyes. She loves money and being pampered. She hates people who are poor or otherwise different form those of the higher class.<br />
<br />
Mysterious boy: a character that Rachel noticed while she was leaving the boys camp. He is white with black hair, and average body type. The only thing so fair known about him is that he may have some interest in our protagonists.<br />
<br />
Adults<br />
<br />
Rebecca J Northon: the councilor for the red wolf cabin. She looks, 25 years old but is really 40; she became infected with lyncrophy 15 years ago by her friends while she was at a party. Shortly after, Rebecca joined the lyncan military, this only lasted a short time however, for during a highly important mission, she disobeyed her commander and demolished a building containing dozens of human civilians, because she believed they were infected by the vampires that were holding them hostage. Only recently has she gained her position at crier wolf. One that she hopes will be temporary. Rebecca is vary fit, she has light brown hair. <br />
(dyed.) That is tied into a pony tail, brown eyes. And white skin.<br />
<br />
DR. Peter A Dawson: the doctor for the boy’s camp, and Marilyn's (the girl’s camps doctor) ex-boyfriend. He looks to be in his thirties but is actually 81. His body is well muscled, he is tall, brown hair, green eyes, and white skin. He took the position at crier wolf so he to help better the condition of new werewolves. <br />
<br />
D.R. Marilyn G nickels: the doctor for the girls camp. She used to date DR. Dawson but broke up with him after the last great lyncrophy out break. Marilyn is 79 years old but appears to be in her thirties. She was conscripted by werewolf command to help watch for anything strange, while simultaneously providing medical care to the campers. Marilyn is white with dark red hair tied in a bun, and hazel eyes. She has a voluptuous body type. Marilyn also almost always keeps a cool deminer.<br />
<br />
Director Samantha Z Cloke: Samantha inherited her condition from her parents who were in the lyncan military. Samantha has been life long friends with Marilyn. They are the same age except by a few months. When Samantha’s powers fully developed she tried to hide it from her friend, unfortunately 10 years later when they met again. Samantha had the choice of either killing her friend, or forcing her to join become a werewolf. Several years later Samantha became the director of camp crier wolf, after her father died. Samantha is white with blonde hair and blue eyes. Her body type is thin and slightly muscled.<br />
<br />
Other notes: camp crier wolf was created during World War 2. Its official purpose has changed when the time period demands it, but its true purpose has always been to train young werewolves. <br />
   Werewolves look practically the same in there wolf forms. Their fur taking on the person’s natural hair color. Werewolves are able to indentify each other through the use of smell though. Another ability of werewolves is that they cease to age outwardly at 25, while their life span is increased to about 200 years.<br />
 However, if a person is transformed after that age, they will slowly get younger till they reach that age.<br />
Lyncrophy can only be transferred through bodily fluids, meaning it cannot be a major virus. This also fixes the plot hole I created with Tina in the early part of the story. So instead of her growing claws after she was scratched, it is actually more logical that she was hallucinating seeing claws on her hand, and her transformation actually began when Cynthia and Rachel began to lick her. <br />
  And... Those are my notes, I’ll try to think up a new chapter idea but remember, we all have real lives.</p>
