<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Aidan, because you think you&#39;re above everyone else, I think you should spend a little time learning your place. From now on, you have to crawl everywhere. I&#39;ll be nice and let you drive your car so you can get down to campus, and you can even sit on furniture, but you&#39;ll be crawling to your car, crawling to class, crawling to the bathroom. You can stand when you have something to do that requires it, but you have to use your judgement to decide if it&#39;s really necessary to stand or not, and decide based on what you think I would say. And people will think it&#39;s a disability of some kind, they won&#39;t question it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aidan&#39;s despair grows with every word. He is standing in front of where Mark was seated, so he involuntarily drops to the floor as Mark&#39;s changes take effect.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mark, you can&#39;t do this to me, how can I go through life like this?&quot; Aidan says, pleading.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you&#39;re right, you&#39;ll get cuts and stuff,&quot; Mark says. &quot;So I&#39;ll change that too, You can&#39;t get injured by crawling around. Rocks, glass, rough concrete, none of it hurts you. You&#39;ll still feel how rough the ground is, it&#39;s just not going to scrape your skin off. See how nice I am?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re the worst person I&#39;ve ever met,&quot; Aidan says.<br />
<br />
Mark shakes his head. &quot;You&#39;ve got three curses. You&#39;re already on your knees. Want to beg to be my slave?&quot;<br />
<br />
Aidan can&#39;t stand the thought of being Mark&#39;s slave for life. But he is already being a slave anyway, right? Aidan looks at Mark, the gloating fucker having the time of his life humiliating Aidan. Aidan can&#39;t give him the satisfaction. And failure is temporary, giving up is forever, and he would NOT give up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get lost,&quot; Aidan says.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve got classes anyway,&quot; Mark says. &quot;You might want to plan out a little extra time to get to class, crawling isn&#39;t the most efficient means of transport.&quot;<br />
<br />
When Mark leaves, Aidan thinks about locking the door. No time for that. He crawls into the kitchen, despite trying very hard to stand up and walk. He makes a sandwich, and is able to stand up to do that, but immediately takes his plate down to the floor and eats from there.<br />
<br />
The futility of his situation really sets in as he realizes he&#39;s thirsty again. He crawls out of his apartment and out to his car.<br />
<br />
When he gets to campus, he crawls through the parking lot to his building, and realizes there&#39;s no more time left, he&#39;ll have to get a drink in the bathroom, even at the risk of seeing classmates there.<br />
<br />
He crawls inside, and prays someone will come in soon.<br />
<br />
When a young college guy enters, Aidan explains his whole made up story. This guy looks as nerdy as Aidan, and super shy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure?&quot; the guy asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I&#39;m sure, obviously,&quot; Aidan says, frustrated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever, I&#39;m out,&quot; he says. The guy pisses in the urinal instead, and Aidan cringes hearing the precious liquid spilling into the bowl.<br />
<br />
Someone else enters, and Aidan is forced to explain yet again why he needs urine.<br />
<br />
&quot;A gene defect?&quot; the new guy says. &quot;I guess that makes sense. I can help.&quot;<br />
<br />
The guy fortunately goes into the stall with Aidan. Aidan forgets he needs to be naked first, and when piss enters his mouth, can&#39;t swallow, so piss leaks out his mouth when it fills up. &quot;Wait, stop!&quot; Aidan gets more on his shirt as he says that.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; the guy asks, holding his dick in one hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;I need to be naked first, so it doesn&#39;t get on my clothes,&quot; Aidan says.<br />
<br />
The guy nods like that makes sense, even though Aidan already got it on his clothes. Aidan undresses, something he doesn&#39;t think justifies  standing up apparently since he can&#39;t stand. The guy doesn&#39;t look away from Aidan for a second.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Eric,&quot; the guy says. Aidan ignores him as he struggles with his shoes.<br />
<br />
Eric is still staring. Aidan&#39;s underwear comes off, and Eric says, &quot;Damn, that&#39;s a cute little thing you&#39;ve got there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aidan looks up, embarrassed. He sees that Eric is sporting a full erection now.<br />
<br />
Aidan gets on his knees again. Eric shoves his cock into Aidan&#39;s mouth, and wiggles it around a little.<br />
<br />
Aidan tries to lean away, but Eric grabs his head and holds it in place, so Aidan can only glare upwards, and then Eric&#39;s stream starts flowing into Aidan&#39;s mouth. Eric apparently is pretty into it since he doesn&#39;t just stand there, he moves his dick in little circles, like he&#39;s trying to get a blowjob or something. Aidan is starting to really hate this guy, even while he swallows his piss.<br />
<br />
Eric doesn&#39;t pull out when his stream stops. Aidan pushes him away.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell dude?&quot; Aidan asks. &quot;I need it for medical reasons, it wasn&#39;t an offer for a blowjob!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Eric says, not looking very sorry. &quot;See you in class.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric leaves, and Aidan gets dressed. He towel dries his shirt, and washes his face the best he can. He can smell urine, but he can taste it too, so decides to still go to class. Aidan crawls out of the bathroom and down the hall to the large lecture hall.<br />
<br />
Eric is there, and Aidan had never really noticed him before in the large classroom, but now he does. Eric is staring at him, with a smile on his face.<br />
<br />
Aidan glares at him until he looks away.<br />
<br />
Aidan has another class, and then decides to find a drink before leaving. This time it&#39;s a nice older man, who Aidan thinks might be a professor. His piss tastes nasty though, that guy needs to improve his diet.<br />
<br />
Crawling all over campus is miserable. It&#39;s so slow! Even slow walkers pass by him so quickly that he feels like he isn&#39;t moving at all.<br />
<br />
When Aidan crawls into his apartment, completely exhausted, his tormentor Mark is already waiting for him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve been watching you all day,&quot; Mark says. &quot;That was some good stuff.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Get out of my chair,&quot; Aidan says. He doesn&#39;t want to engage in Mark&#39;s bullshit.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Mark says. &quot;Anyway, I&#39;m modifying one of your existing curses. If someone gets an erection at any time during your piss drinking, even if they&#39;ve finished pissing and are just about to zip up, you&#39;ll ask if they want a blowjob. If they say yes, you give them one, and you&#39;ll put your best effort into it, and if they suggest any specific things they&#39;d like you to do for their blowjob, you&#39;ll go along with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aidan lays down, cringing at Mark&#39;s command. And what would Mark curse him with next? Should he just give up? Beg to be a slave?<br />
<br />
Mark doesn&#39;t give him a chance to say anything, he starts giving Aidan a new command.</p>
