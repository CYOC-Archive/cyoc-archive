<br />
<br />
Spencer’s eyes locked on her target. She leapt down from her spot, and back onto the ground. She remained silent until Jeremy turned around, pleasantly surprised to see her. He’d just spent the better part of the afternoon running in circles to confuse the police. And just when he was about to give up and dig himself into another “hiding hole” Spencer appears out of nowhere. <br />
<br />
“Well, well, well. Spencer it’s been a long time.” Jeremy said, his voice low and seductive. At least to his ears. The only thing Spencer could hear was some sick waste of space making disgusting noises at her. <br />
<br />
“Why are you here Jeremy?” she asked, the fur on her back standing straight on end, and her tail looking more like a squirrel’s it was so fluffed up.<br />
<br />
“Uh, to take you home. Duh. Your father hasn’t hit you on the head has he?” Jeremy joked, barking a laugh. Spencer’s body shook with anger.<br />
<br />
“I’m not going anywhere.” she said coolly. Jeremy stopped laughing to stare at her. He wasn’t sure he heard her right, so he asked Spencer to repeat herself. <br />
<br />
“Im NOT leaving.” Spencer said flatly. Her tail whipped back and forth behind her. She could almost see the rage building in Jeremy’s body.<br />
<br />
“Excuse me, did I say, ‘if it pleases you mistress?’ You’re coming back to Virginia with me. Where you belong.” Jeremy said.   <br />
<br />
“I’m not leaving.” Spencer said once again. Jeremy growled, low and menacing. He took a few steps towards her. His teeth bared, his lip curled into a snarl.<br />
<br />
“Your father must have really fucked up your head while I was gone.” he said.<br />
<br />
“He didn’t to anything to me. I’m not going with you Jeremy. I’m happy here.”<br />
<br />
“Happy? What, you’ve been cheating on me?” Jeremy sniffed the air. Other than Spencer’s scent, he couldn’t distinguish any others. She was a mess smells, some werecat, others werewolf. A werefox, and something fishy (since Spencer ran through the Stovall’s backyard). Jeremy growls again.<br />
<br />
“Moon Lake certainly has loosened you up, hasn’t it?” he asked, starting to grow impatient with her. Jeremy paces around Spencer. She doesn’t move, grinding her teeth together in her mouth. <br />
<br />
“Maybe that’s a good thing. You must know a lot more now.” Jeremy said, stopping behind Spencer. Every time her tail flicks back and forth she’s exposing herself for the world to see. And Jeremy’s enticed by the sights and smells before him. He starts to approach her, but Spencer doesn’t let him get any closer than two feet. <br />
<br />
“Go back wherever you came from Jeremy. I’m NOT interested.” Spencer said, her claws extending. She didn’t want this to end in a fight, but if that’s what it took to get Jeremy to go, then she’s be more than happy to rake his skin from his body. <br />
<br />
“You don’t mean that. Come one, why do you want to stay anyway? This place, it’s so boring. Nothing but trees for miles. Don’t you want to runaway, leave your parents behind?”<br />
<br />
“No.”<br />
<br />
“Really? That’s not what you said a few weeks ago.” Jeremy said. <br />
<br />
“That was different. I’m happy the way things are now.” Spencer said quietly. <br />
<br />
She had said those things before. But that was when she was living like a prison surrounded by soldiers and naval men. Rules, regulations, quarter inspections, she’d hated it (as most teenagers would). But Moon Lake was so much better. Sure it had strict rules and such, but it was still a massive improvement over Norfolk. <br />
<br />
“And I have Eric…” part of her mind thought. <br />
<br />
“Really? You been sleeping with some werewolf have you?” Jeremy asked. <br />
<br />
“What? No.” Spencer said, honestly surprised Jeremy came to that assumption. She smelled like her father, sure, and naturally a bit like a wolf. But the only other scent on her would probably be either Alex’s or Eric’s (having just spent the past hour or so with them).<br />
<br />
“Oh, crap Alex.” she thought realizing he must smell like werewolf sex, spending the night with his boyfriend. Jeremy couldn’t know that she wasn’t the one Alex spent his night with. <br />
<br />
“I haven’t been with anyone.” Spencer said, and that was the truth. She hadn’t BEEN with anyone since Jeremy. <br />
<br />
“Don’t lie to me Spencer, I can smell him. You think that wolf will have you for anything more than a few nights of pleasure? You’re MINE, and mine alone.” Jeremy said, lifting a paw to point at Spencer’s shoulder. <br />
<br />
The bite mark was thankfully covered by thick layers of fur, but Spencer could still feel where he’d bitten her. And then there were the marks on the rest of her body, on her feet, tail, and even one on long healed on her left ear. She shifted uncomfortably under Jeremy’s gaze.  <br />
<br />
“I can’t believe I ever liked him,” she thought disgusted with herself for falling for such a douchebag. <br />
<br />
“So, are you going to come quietly, or am I going to have to carry you out of here? Again?” Jeremy added, reminding Spencer that Jeremy had already tried to drag her away once. That time her father came to her rescue, with an armed group of were police behind him. He didn’t get the chance to beat Jeremy senseless, nor did Spencer. <br />
<br />
Jeremy waited for an answer, his eyes never once leaving Spencer’s quivering body. For a moment, he thought he’d won. But as Spencer approached him, he noticed her claws were out, and that she had a particularly bloodthirsty look in her eyes. He barely had enough time to defend himself. <br />
<br />
The two collided, and fell to the forest floor, a mess of black fur. They both rolled on top of each other, trying to gain the upper hand on their opponent. Spencer was smaller, but Jeremy wasn’t as coordinated. And Jeremy didn’t have claws like Spencer, so he had a harder time of holding onto her. But his bite was something to be reckoned with. A rottweiler’s bite can exert 330 pounds of force. Jeremy’s wasn’t too far off. <br />
<br />
Spencer knew to avoid his head as much as possible, unless she wanted to have new holes torn in her body. Thankfully she was faster than Jeremy, and her claws much sharper. Jeremy kept snapping, trying to bite any part of Spencer. She dug her long, curved claws into his back and then chest. Jeremy whimpered, but managed to connect his teeth with Spencer’s right arm. <br />
<br />
There was a sickening snap, and Jeremy felt his teeth push further and further through Spencer’s now broken bone. It took all of her power not to runaway. The soft mew of pain she did let out brought Jeremy a great deal of pleasure. In the midst of the fight, he got an erection. Spencer felt her body rub against it as she tried to breakaway from Jeremy. But he was unrelenting, and he clamped down harder. <br />
<br />
Rottweilers can exert upwards of 330 pounds, but a wolf&#39;s bite can exert anywhere from 400 to 1,200 pounds of force. Spencer, having had enough to this ridiculousness, bites down on Jeremy’s shoulder. And then his head. Spencer’s teeth pierce through Jeremy’s skull. He howls in pain, releasing Spencer’s arm from his own bite. But Spencer doesn’t stop her grip. <br />
<br />
“How do you like being marked for a change?” she thought angrily. Nothing could stop her, all the hate and hurt she’d felt because of Jeremy overflowing. <br />
<br />
“Spencer, stop!”  <br />
<br />
She was only vaguely aware of the voice behind her. It was familiar, but she couldn’t place it. A pair of strong hands (paws), grabbed her shoulders and pulled. But Spencer wouldn’t let go of Jeremy’s now limp body. She tries to get back to him to finish him, but she can’t seem to break free of the tight grip this other were has on her. <br />
<br />
“Spencer, stop it. Calm down! You’re alright! Jeremy’s down!” Evan Lawson said while trying to restrain his daughter. Spencer stops thrashing in his arms, and looks up. Her eyes are still blazing with intense emotions, and her muzzle is wet with blood. Evan locks his eyes with hers, and pulls her closer. <br />
<br />
Spencer looks down at Jeremy’s unconscious body. His head is a bloody mess, but he’s still breathing. Her own arm feels like its on fire, and the adrenaline that had been fueling her rage has started to subside. Once it’s completely gone, Spencer looks back at her father. <br />
<br />
“You’re alright.” he says again. Spencer breaths for the first time in what feels like forever. The two embrace again, Evan careful not to touch her broken arm. A rustling in the trees catches his attention, and he sees another werewolf with a police badge clipped around his arm. Spencer had her face buried in her father’s fur, and doesn’t notice the officer. <br />
<br />
Officer Connor looks from the two standing before him, and then to Bower’s unconscious form on the ground. He nods to Evan Lawson, and slips back to radio the situation to the police. <br />
<br />
“It’s alright. I’ve found all three of them. You’d better get a medical team out here. And keep the feds away, it’s a full blown were battlefield out here.” he said quietly. The officer on the other end asks if he’s seen a normal boy.<br />
<br />
“Uh, no. No sign of any normals.” Officer Connor said confused. He was only searching for the two Lawsons and Bower. What boy?</p>
