<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Upstairs in his room, Jim blew up the balloon and cast a spell on Dani.<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
Downstairs, Dani sat with Judy on the couch, starting to feel bored with the young girl&#39;s idea of TV entertainment. She adjusted her underwear as it had seemed to bunch up strangely at her crotch just then. Looking at the clock and then at the stairs, she felt like it was about time to have more fun with Jimmy. Just as she was about to go surprise him in his room, she heard his footsteps on the stairs.<br />
<br />
The boy appeared in the room again, still smiling that dumb grin. What the hell was the matter with him anyway? He never used to act like this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you work out your frustrations, Jimmy?&quot; she asked him, but that subtle taunt seemed to have little effect on his smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m all good,&quot; he said. &quot;In fact,&quot; he added. &quot;How about I get you guys drink?&quot;<br />
<br />
She looked at him uncertainly. This was way too nice a gesture for him. What was his game? &quot;Diet soda,&quot; Dani replied, suspiciously. &quot;But, just water for the two of you,&quot; she added. Then, as an afterthought, she said, &quot;Leave mine in the can, please.&quot; With how strangely he was behaving, she could imagine him trying to put something in her drink.<br />
<br />
He returned a minute later with her unopened can and then retrieved two glasses of water for him and Judy.<br />
<br />
She examined the top of the can. It seemed clean. She even wiped it with her shirt. Ultimately, she decided that this must just be a new wrinkle to his hopeless crush on her. He wanted her to like him. That had to be it. He was sucking up. How pathetic, she thought and smiled to herself. &quot;Thanks, Jimmy,&quot; she said as she popped open the can and took a drink. &quot;Very refreshing.&quot;<br />
<br />
He sat down on a chair across the room and joined them in watching TV. She noticed he kept looking her way, as if checking on her. It made her a bit nervous, but she decided that she could humiliate him later somehow to reassert her dominance. The drink really was refreshing, after all, and she wanted to finish it first before going after him again. He was so much fun to play with, she reminisced. It was one of the great benefits of sitting for the two of them. The poor boy was helpless around her.<br />
<br />
She drained the can and ordered Jimmy to put it in the recycling for her and then take out the trash and the recycling.<br />
<br />
Rather than complain, he just said, &quot;No problem. Would you like another one when I&#39;m done?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; she said, and he left to take out the trash. &quot;What&#39;s his deal?&quot; she said aloud to herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jim&#39;s a boy,&quot; Judy explained. &quot;Boys are weird.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dani nodded. &quot;You&#39;re right about that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Minutes later, Jimmy was back with another unopened diet soda can, which Dani started drinking immediately.<br />
<br />
Time passed, and one show ended leading in to the next all too similar one. Dani started to forget about Jimmy&#39;s weirdness as she texted on her phone until he suddenly spoke up during a commercial.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you ticklish?&quot; he asked bluntly and waited for Dani to answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me?&quot; Dani replied. &quot;Well, I know that you are,&quot; she said and smiled at the memory of his wet pants.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not,&quot; declared Judy.<br />
<br />
&quot;But, are you?&quot; he asked Dani again.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; she said. &quot;But, you sure aren&#39;t going to find out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooh, lemme try!&quot; said Judy, who immediately reached over and started to tickle Dani&#39;s belly. Dani flinched away and chuckled. &quot;She is!&quot; Judy cried at the discovery and redoubled her efforts to get Dani to laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;S-stop!&quot; Dani cried through her giggles as she edged away from the girl. &quot;Wait, ha, no!&quot; It was a bit humiliating, and she noticed Jimmy smiling at her across the room. She made a mental note to get back at him later.<br />
<br />
Then, the tickling abruptly stopped. &quot;Dani,&quot; Judy said, looking guiltily at her. &quot;I&#39;m so sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry for what?&quot; Dani asked as she calmed down.<br />
<br />
&quot;You didn&#39;t feel it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Feel what?&quot;<br />
<br />
Judy pointed at Dani&#39;s crotch and only then did Dani notice the growing dark patch of wetness spreading there on her jeans. She noticed the warmth and felt the wetness, but she had no sense that pee was coming out of her. At first she thought it was some trick by Jimmy. He had a water pistol or some secret way of spilling warm water on her, but his hands were empty and yet the wetness kept growing. She stood up and made a quick exit to the bathroom with one hand pressed against her crotch trying vainly to stem the flow.<br />
<br />
She locked the door and dropped her jeans. Her underwear were soaked and still dripping warm pee onto the tiles.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell?&quot; she said. It was as if she had no control over it. She just kept leaking. Thankfully, the dripping stopped a few seconds later.<br />
<br />
Rather than worry about how a little tickling had caused this, she went into damage control mode. She grabbed some tissue and tried to soak up some of the piss on the floor and then on her underwear. Realizing that she needed a fresh pair, she slipped them off, and started dabbing at her crotch with a tissue, but she immediately stopped when she got a good look at her crotch.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck?&quot; she said. &quot;Where&#39;s the hair?&quot; Her pubes were gone, every trace of them. Not even a single stray hair remained in her underwear on the floor. Sure she had been shaving them down, but there was definitely a good patch left there when she got dressed today. Now, she was totally smooth down there, not even a hint of stubble. She rubbed a hand over the soft smooth skin of her mound and then felt something strange below. It seemed as though everything down there had tightened up or shrunk somehow.<br />
<br />
Quickly, she grabbed a hand mirror and positioned herself uncomfortably on the floor against a wall to get a good angle to view her crotch with the mirror.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my God!&quot; she cried when she saw it. &quot;What happened to my pussy!?&quot;<br />
<br />
She ran a finger over the tiny pale slit that had been so much larger just earlier today. She tried to probe inside of it, but found it too small and tight to fit more than the very tip of her finger. What&#39;s more, it seemed almost numb to her touch. There was virtually no sensation coming from it aside from the dull feeling of touch from her seemingly enormous finger. No stimulation. Even her clit seemed non-existent. It was as if she suddenly had the crotch of a...<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you need some help in there, Dani?&quot; Jim&#39;s voice suddenly burst through the closed door, startling her, causing her to drop the mirror, which thankfully did not break. Reflexively, she covered up her bare crotch. &quot;Judy said she&#39;s really sorry. Are you alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; she said, realizing how strange that must have sounded coming from her laying on the floor. &quot;Just, leave me alone. I&#39;m fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can get you a pair of my mom&#39;s sweatpants if you&#39;d like,&quot; he offered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; she said. &quot;Great, just leave them by the door. Then, go keep an eye on your sister. Tell her I&#39;m fine. Tell her it&#39;s not her fault. I&#39;m just a bit sick, I think.&quot; She really hoped that was true.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, be right back with the sweats.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dani heard him walk away. She grabbed the mirror again and took another look at her crotch. What she saw down there looked familiar. &quot;That&#39;s not... I mean it can&#39;t be.&quot; Now, she had babysat for years now. Although she hated doing it, she had even sat for a few actual babies and toddlers. They could be a real mess, and she had learned to change a diaper or two in her time. What she was looking at now was something she had diapered many times before.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s impossible,&quot; she said as she looked at how young she had become down there... just like a baby. &quot;I mean, that just can&#39;t happen. It&#39;s impossible.&quot; As much as she tried to deny the evidence before her, it really did explain what had happened to her earlier with her little accident. Maybe she had become too young down there to hold her bladder anymore... just like a little baby.<br />
<br />
Her mind ran wild looking for an explanation. How could this have happened? Did Jimmy do this? No, how could he? Not unless he has magical powers or something. Was there something in the drinks? They were sealed. It can&#39;t be that. Maybe she really is sick. Maybe it was something she ate. &quot;What the hell is going on with me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Got the sweats,&quot; said Jimmy through the door causing her to cover up her shameful crotch again. &quot;I&#39;ll leave them here for you and go watch Judy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;T-thank you,&quot; she said shakily. Nothing felt certain right now. She needed to get to a doctor or something. This was serious.<br />
<br />
She washed her hands and fished her phone from her wet jeans, thankfully it had escaped a soaking. She started searching for any medical conditions that might cause this, which only brought up pictures of questionable porn and unrelated articles on sexual diseases.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit,&quot; she said as she put down her phone. What was she going to do? The kids parents wouldn&#39;t be home for another couple of hours, and she couldn&#39;t just leave them alone. Finally, she resolved to call the parents, tell them she was feeling suddenly ill, and wait for them to come home. They would be upset, but then she could get out safely.<br />
<br />
She called the kids&#39; parents. They were polite and understanding. It would be 30 minutes until they got there, they estimated.<br />
<br />
Dani wrapped a towel around her waist and stepped into the hall to retrieve the sweatpants. She half expected to see Jimmy waiting down the hall to catch a peek at her naked body. Boy, would he have been disappointed. Then, she dropped the towel in the tub with her wet clothes and pulled up the sweats. Not trusting her bladder or anything else down there, she put her socks down her crotch as a makeshift pad or mini diaper.<br />
<br />
When she returned to the kids in the living room, Judy apologized profusely, but Dani just calmed her down and told her it was not her fault at all. She was sick.<br />
<br />
Jimmy sat there watching TV with a faint, quiet smile on his face, he didn&#39;t even bother to look at her for more than a quick glance.<br />
<br />
This was his fault, she decided. It had to be. He was acting weird, and then this happened. But, how the hell could he have done this?<br />
<br />
On her suggestion, they all sat down in the kitchen, and Dani grabbed them all a quick snack, just some fruit and granola bars. At least in the kitchen, if anything else happened, there would be an easier mess to clean up, she decided.<br />
<br />
Judy ate some grapes and started telling Dani about her week at school, which Dani pretended to listen to.<br />
<br />
Jimmy just ate his apple and smiled.<br />
<br />
How did he do it? she wondered. Was it poison? Did he get her sick with something? It was driving her nuts. This was impossible, what had happened to her pussy was impossible, but it HAD happened, and she knew it was his fault, that smiling little bastard. It was so damn frustrating. That smug little shit had done this to her somehow. She knew it was true! But how the hell did he do it? How!?<br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; she said to him when the frustration had reached a breaking point in her. She tried to compose herself as a good babysitter should. &quot;What did you do to me?&quot; she asked him plainly and calmly. &quot;Just tell me what it was. That&#39;s all I want to know. I promise you won&#39;t get in trouble.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; he said with an unconvincing straight face.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know what,&quot; she said. &quot;Down... there. How did you do it? What did you do to me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, I didn&#39;t do anything,&quot; he said. &quot;I was just sitting there, and Judy started to tickle you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m so sorry,&quot; said Judy. &quot;Really, I am.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dani ignored her. &quot;Was it the soda cans? Was there something on them or in them?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I just grabbed those from the fridge,&quot; he said honestly. &quot;My mom drinks them all the time. I thought you would like them.&quot;<br />
<br />
She clenched her fists. This nice cop crap was going nowhere. &quot;Tell me what you did... or else.&quot;<br />
<br />
Judy sat there horrified as she watched Dani growing increasingly angry. Jimmy just looked back at her blankly. Then, the faintest of smiles appeared on his lips. That was the last straw. Dani jumped up kicking the chair over behind her and grabbed Jimmy with both hands by the front of his shirt and pulled him up face to face with her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dani!&quot; Judy cried.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut it!&quot; said Dani.<br />
<br />
Judy burst out crying.<br />
<br />
Dani turned her attention back to Jimmy. Finally, she had erased that smug smile as he looked up at her in shock. &quot;Now, do I have your attention you little shit!?&quot; she screamed at him. &quot;I know you did this, and you&#39;re going to tell me how you did it right now, or I&#39;m going to make your life a living hell. I&#39;ve lied to your parents before. The idiots trust me. I could tell them anything I want about you and get you grounded... for years even. Now you fucking tell me what you did, or I&#39;ll give you a problem with your own crotch right now!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dani!&quot; said a new voice from the hallway. It was a mature woman&#39;s voice. They all turned to see Jimmy and Judy&#39;s mother standing there looking horrified. Judy ran to her in tears and hugged her. In all of the commotion and yelling, none of them had noticed her come in the front door. &quot;Take your hands off of my son, young lady!&quot; the kids&#39; mother said to Dani.<br />
<br />
Immediately, Dani let him go. The smirk reappeared on his face, but only Dani noticed it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I can explain,&quot; she said pleadingly to the kids&#39; mother, but after one look at her furious face, Dani realized that this was not going to end well. It was also then that she realized that she was peeing herself again.</p>
