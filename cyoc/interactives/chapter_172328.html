<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Mary Maxwell is that you?” said a voice as Mary and John turned around toward the source of the sound, floating slowly up to them was another mermaid who was about their age. She had long brilliant red hair which went down to her tail, a bronze band held it back in a ponytail. Instantly a blush formed across John’s face as this beautiful mermaid turned and looked at her and her sister. Her eyes where an impossible emerald green which seamed to almost glow. Her chest while not large was more then large enough and went great with her athletic frame, she wore a bronze corset with a lace up front. Her tail was long and graceful with mixtures of bright red and bronze. <br />
“Yes, Do I know you?” inquired Mary<br />
“Sorry I forgot I changed…it’s me Kim, your former neighbor.” Said this mermaid as John’s eyes widened, Kim was their neighbor across the street since he was a little boy until her parents sent her to board school in his junior year of school. He had a crush on Kim for years, but she never showed any signs of interest in him. Kim had red hair for sure and green eyes but was no way nearly as bright as what she had now. <br />
“KIM!!!” said Mary as she pulled Kim into a hug. “I didn’t know you caught the virus; your parents didn’t say anything.”<br />
“I am not surprise.” Said Kim with a shrug “I am the shame of my family.”<br />
That caused John’s and Mary’s to raise an eyebrow.<br />
“Did you really think my penny counter paster of a father would send me to a costly boarding school?” inquired Kim with a shrug as John remembered how Kim’s father the Pastor of a nearby church was always known for being cheap. <br />
“No…I guess not where did they send you?” inquired John as Kim turned and looked at her. <br />
“Who are you?” inquired Kim as John’s face fell.<br />
“I am John…” said John as Kim’s eyes widened <br />
“John as in John Maxwell?” inquired Kim as John nodded, he expected her to laugh at him instead she pulled him into a tigh hug and squeezed for the lack of a better terms the air out of his lungs. The she pulled back and ran her eyes up and down her. “Wow…you look really good as a mermaid.”<br />
John raised an eyebrow at the tone in Kim’s voice but he didn’t ask as Kim turned back to Mary.<br />
“Well it doesn’t matter down here, but I was sent to a “reeducation camp” to fix me.” Said Kim as both Maxwell’s looked at her and then each other. “My parents found out I am a lesbian and couldn’t deal with it, they had to bring god into it…like it matters now.”<br />
“You’re a lesbian?” said John amazed and hitting himself, he would have never had a chance with Kim…it took her a moment to remember that he was now a she.<br />
“Yes.” Confirmed Kim as she moved her hand to jester to everyone else. “Did you not notice that 4 out of 5 people are mermaids…not merman, lesbians are very welcomed down here. I am so happy I became a mermaid.”<br />
“I see, how long have you been a mermaid we only just turned?” inquired Mary<br />
“4…no 5 months now.” Answered Kim “Where do you live?”<br />
“Well our whole family got it and are becoming merpeople but John and I turned first.” Explained Mary as Kim nodded and smiled.<br />
“It will be good to have some people from my old life down here.” Said Kim<br />
“Kim!!!” yelled a voice as all three of them turned to see another mermaid with pitch black tail and even blacker hair which flowed around her in perfect curls, she was wearing a tight black tube top over what had to be B maybe even C cup breasts. Beside her was a merman with a bright orange tail and a bare six pack chest aside from a dozen necklaces and golden locks in his blue eyes. Lastly there was a mermaid whose tail reminded her as a koi fish and was clearly Japanese with black hair pulled back in two pony tails like some anime character.  <br />
“Ah…Christina, Tomas, Jade come here I want you to meet some people friends of mine.” said Kim as the two mermaids and one merman swam over. Kim quickly introduced everyone, Christina was the jet-black mermaid, Thomas was the merman who turned out was once a women only to become a merman and the opposite was true for Jade. Like John, Jade had once been an African American man and was now a Japanese mermaid. John noticed her sister was blushing as well but she couldn’t tell whom she was blushing at. <br />
“These are some of my friends and roommates.” Said Kim <br />
“Kim, I hate to say this but we need to get going.” Countered Christina <br />
“Sorry need to go.” Said Kim as she turned and was about to swim away. “We are all going to be at the Locked Treasure Chest at 10 tonight for drinks and dancing, meet us there is you are up to it.”<br />
“Alright…we will see.” Said Mary as Kim and the rest moved away leaving the two twins together to consider what to do next.</p>
