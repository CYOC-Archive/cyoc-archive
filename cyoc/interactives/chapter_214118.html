<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jenny, Jeff’s sister, was outside playing and eating the snack her mother made her the whole time everything was going on upstairs. She was wondering why her mom kept disappearing to her brother’s room. She thought to herself that she needed to see what was so special that she was being kept away from. <br />
<br />
She may have only ben ten years old, but she was preceptive. She thought it had to do with something on the “homework” that her brother been working on yesterday and all day today. It had to be something important id Susan came over. Jenny liked Susan a lot, but also knew that she only came over for important things. Add on top of that the fact that she overheard her mom talking to Susan’s parents about sleeping over! She had to find out what was going on. <br />
<br />
Later that night, Jenny found her chance to see what all the fuss was about. Her mom had put her to bed, waiting for her to fall asleep, before going to Jeff’s room to get both Jeff and Susan. Jenny could hear them walking down the stairs, her mom sounding mad. When she could no longer hear them, Jenny slowly got out of her bed, trying not to make a sound. Thankfully, her mother had left her door open a crack, so she was able to open it without making any noise. <br />
<br />
Jenny makes her way into Jeff’s room, as the door was left open. She tiptoes to the computer, opting not to sit on the chair just in case it would squeak. She quickly types in Jeff’s password, something she remembers from him mothing it a hundred times, to bring up the desktop. <br />
<br />
The first thing that caught Jenny’s eyes was the Chronivac. It was a new icon that she had never seen before. She looks to the side of the computer and sees the full device. “Well, this must be the big secret.” Jenny thinks to herself. <br />
<br />
Jenny clicks on the Chronivac and comes up slowly. Jenny shakes her head, wondering when her parents are going to upgrade any of their computers. Her school laptop works faster than this. <br />
<br />
Once the app comes up, Jenny sees that there are tabs for both Jeff and Susan. Jenny clicks on them and reads everything. “Oh my god!” She thinks as she reads. “They are werewolves. Is that why Mom being so secretive?” <br />
<br />
Jenny looks around the app and soon sees her own tab, under an unused file. Jenny opens it and sees her stats. “Wow, this has information about me!” Jenny whispers, to shock to care if she got caught right now. <br />
<br />
The stats showed her information about herself, including her age and gender. But what caught her off guard again was some words she was not familiar with as well as information that was way to private. <br />
<br />
Libido: Low (Age Restricted) <br />
<br />
Breast size: N/A <br />
<br />
Fertility: N/A (Age Restricted)<br />
<br />
“What is all this?” Jenny thinks in her head as she reads on. <br />
<br />
As she gets to mid-page, Jenny then reads where she could change her stats. “Look at these ‘packages’! I can be anything!” She reads over and sees the werewolf that was tied to her brother and Susan. She then sees a werecat Package under it. This piques her interest. <br />
<br />
“If what I think is true, then this should change me. If I do change, then that means that my brother is a werewolf. That would be why everyone is so secretive.” Jenny thinks. <br />
<br />
She clicks on the package, but before hitting the summit button, she reads it over. She sees the special tab and reads it over. <br />
Special: Can change others. Fertile. Ages as normal human in werecat form.<br />
<br />
Not knowing what fertile means, Jenny erases that. While she didn’t mind the idea of being a cat-girl, she did want anything weird to happen. She made sure that “Anytime” was set next to when she could transform and that she would have control of herself and her transformation. The system noted that her first transformation would be immediately after summiting, but after that, it would be up to Jenny when she changed. <br />
<br />
Satisfied, Jenny clicked summit and then closed the app. She snuck back to her room, making sure that no one saw her. As she hid back under her sheets, she could hear her brother and Susan walk back up. <br />
<br />
“Well, that went better than I thought.” Susan says in a whisper.  <br />
<br />
“Yeah. But mom also said she is being understanding because of our new wolf hormones. We got to be careful not to go to far.” Jeff replies in a similarly low voice. <br />
<br />
“Yeah, but I am not to worry about it. While we are getting used to our new abilities, let’s have some fun. I promised you that earlier. Let’s get furry and see what happens.” Susan jokes. <br />
<br />
“I don’t know to be happy or worried about that.” Jeff replies with a giggle. <br />
<br />
As they closed the door, Jenny noticed that the conversation seemed louder to her. But before she could check anything, she hears her mother opening the door. Jenny stays still as her mother is checking on her. When she hears the door close, slowly and quietly, Jenny then turns her head to see that she was left alone in her room. <br />
<br />
In the dark, and not wanting to turn on a light to show that she was indeed awake, Jenny sits up in the bed and just looks around. She figures it has been about five minutes since she slipped back into her room, but she hasn’t noticed anything beyond being able to hear better. <br />
<br />
As she sits there, she feels an itch on her ears. As she brings her hands up to them, her ears twitch. Jenny’s eyes go wide as she feels her twitching ears through her hair. She gets up quietly, moving to her mirror. She looks in the dark at the mirror, from only inches away, to see her ears turn pointed before moving up to the top of her head. <br />
<br />
“It’s true.” She whispers. “I am turning into a cat!” <br />
<br />
Jenny’s excitement grows as her eyesight soon becomes better. It was as if someone turned on the light. Jenny looks around to see no one else was in the room before looking at herself again. She sees that other changes were already happening. Orange and white fur starts to grow over her body as her nails turn to claws. Jenny arcs up as her feet widen, turning into almost paw like. She feels a pull in her spine as a bump form just above her butt. <br />
<br />
Then her clothes started to feel tight. Jenny could feel the straining of her clothes as her body started to grow. Jenny quickly unbuttons her pajama top and tosses it to the floor before dropping her pants. As she does, her tail grows out, wrapping around her. Jenny leaves her panties on, just in case someone walks in, but the soon become tight. She looks back at herself in the mirror, not believing what was happening. <br />
<br />
That was when she noticed something else. Jenny looked at her upper stomach, just under her breast. She sees two new sets of nipples there, covered in fur. As a matter of fact, as the fur grew in, it covered her nipples similar to a shirt. <br />
<br />
But Jenny could look long before her face started to twitch. She brings up her hands, that now resembled paws, to her face as whiskers start to grow out. As the whiskers settled in, her face pushed out to a small cat muzzle. <br />
<br />
Jenny staggers as the last of her changes hit her. As she regains her composure, she feels a weird feeling in her stomach. Jenny rushes to her bathroom, pulling down her pants to sit on the toilet as the feeling becomes too much. She releases what she thinks is her peeing in the toilet before she is able to catch her breath. <br />
<br />
“What was that?” She wondered as she cleaned herself up. <br />
<br />
Pulling her panties back up after the whole incident, she sees that her new fur covered everything. She walks back to the mirror in her room to look herself over. She looked like a mix of a white and orange house cat and a little girl. She poses herself as one of her cartoons as she looks herself over. She was so happy with how cute she turned out; her long tail that reached the floor, her whiskers and rose-colored nose. Even her eyes, now with cat slits, seem to glow in the night. Looking down, her main set of breasts shows signs of growth. <br />
<br />
 “I may be getting my first bra! Yea!” Jenny whispers in excitement. <br />
<br />
Loving her new form, Jenny picks up her pajamas and places them on the floor next to her bed. When she wakes up in the morning, she will change back to her human self. But for now, she wants to sleep her first night as her new cat girl form.</p>
