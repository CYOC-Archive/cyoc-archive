<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nicholas can&#39;t stop himself as he enters the brewing room. <br />
<br />
Looking around, he sees jars filled with bug parts from eyes to antennas, some liquids of various colors bubbling away, creating lots of background noise and, of course, a cauldron, itself also loudly bubbling. <br />
<br />
While passing through the room, he fails to notice that some liquid had been spilled over the floor. <br />
<br />
His heart skips a beat as he falls forward against a shelf,causing a vial on top of it to fall over. <br />
<br />
Nicholas jumps as he feels something liquid pour onto his skull, causing him to crash against another shelf, making it fall over as the contents of an additional two vials are poured onto him and a dozen onto the floor. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck!&quot; He proclaims as he sees his hair starting to cascade downwards. <br />
<br />
His head starts to tingle as two nubs grow out from his skull, quickly becoming antennas. <br />
<br />
How the fuck is he going to explain this?<br />
<br />
Then the tingling intensifies into a headache.<br />
<br />
His eyes seal shut, making him panic due to his sudden blindness, causing him to crash into yet another shelf. <br />
<br />
Sight soon returns to him in by the hundreds as two massive compound eyes grow out of the sides of his head.<br />
<br />
Running over to a nearby mirror, he screams as he sees that his head is firmly on the way to being that of a dragonfly, somehow still having something that looks like two expressive pupils on the massive compound eyes.<br />
<br />
His head now entirely covered in skeleton, his skull reshapes into a bit of a triangular shape, his lips, ears and nose disappearing as his mouth gets new friends in the form of mandibles.<br />
<br />
The changes head further down his thin neck, something changing in his throat as its voice gains a weird buzzing, yet obviously feminine quality.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit!&quot; He shouts, frowning when he hears his new voice and further panicking when he realizes what Arthur had said about sex swaps being the norm. <br />
<br />
He runs around, looking at vials. <br />
<br />
&quot;Something here must stop this, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
As he checks countless vials, his shoulders loose their broadness, the now cyan blue exoskeleton creeping  ever downward. <br />
<br />
His nipples suddenly harden and start to tingle as fat starts to accumulate below them. Nicholas runs faster, gasping as he feels two moderately sized breasts push out from below his nipples.<br />
<br />
His arms grow longer, daintier as they too get covered in exoskeleton, his hands soon becoming black claws. <br />
<br />
Below them, a second pair of arms feels like as if it is being dragged out of him. <br />
<br />
His features overall become longer and slimmer as most of his belly fat disappears, his waist giving way as his hips widen significantly, barely being constrained by his pants. <br />
<br />
As his legs change, becoming longer as his calves and thighs reshape, he loses balance and falls over. <br />
<br />
With a painful moans he looks backward where an abdomen is growing out above his butt, becoming longer and longer as it becomes as long as he is high from his head to his toes, which have also merged into claws by now, having torn away his boots with their shear sharpness. <br />
<br />
He watches with trepidation as his butt becomes plumb, arching his back. <br />
<br />
Nicholas moans, embarrassment mixing with arousal as he feels his manhood pull in, becoming the clit of his new womanhood. <br />
<br />
The last change happens as two pairs of wings grew out on his back below his shoulder.<br />
<br />
And so his transformation into a dragonfly woman ends. <br />
<br />
Slowly he pushes himself up on all fours (six?), taking an afraid, yet curious look at his new features. <br />
<br />
Clawsteps come closer as the tick wizard and Arthur, the dragonfly-taur  enter the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Human, you are not supposed to- BY THE GODDESS&#39; ASS! What are you doing? How did- YOU HAVE BEEN HERE FOR BARELY 30 MINUTES.&quot;<br />
<br />
The tick wizard&#39;s eyes almost bulge out of his head. Arthur meanwhile, seems shy, not looking at the embarrassed Nicholas laying on the floor among broken glass and and fallen shelfs. <br />
<br />
&quot;WHO EVEN MADE A FEMALE DRAGONFLY TRANSFORMATION POTION?&quot;<br />
<br />
Arthur raises his finger slowly, bashfuly. <br />
<br />
&quot;I...I did sir. I wanted to know how it is on the other side for a day or so. I haven&#39;t gotten the ingredients right yet...so it is permanent.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nicholas&#39;s heart sinks into his stomach. This is permanent? With one stupid idea  he has damned himself to dragonfly womanhood?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;YOU ARE UNDER HOUSE ARREST FOR A WEEK!&quot;<br />
<br />
The wizard grabbed Nicholas and angrily lifted him into the air, shouting.<br />
<br />
&quot;AND YOU GIRL, ARE GOING TO THE NEAREST TOWN, FIND A PLACE OF WORK AND WORK YOUR ASS OFF TILL YOU CAN PAY FOR ALL THE EQUIPMENT YOU BROKE!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, sir.&quot; Mumbles Nicholas, afraid as he is let down again.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t believe it...&quot; Grumbles the tick as he leaves the two of them behind. <br />
<br />
Arthur turns to Nicholas, looking awkward. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, a similar series of events lead to me becoming his apprentice. Maybe you too have a chance?&quot;<br />
<br />
He breaks eye contact. &quot;You look really pretty by the way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nicholas looks down and touches his exoskeleton before sighing. <br />
<br />
&quot;I guess this is my life now...&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;In debt to the tick wizard&quot;-Ending (?)<br />
<br />
Nicholas has become a Dragonfly Woman only 30 minutes into the Eternal Garden. That is a new record!</p>
