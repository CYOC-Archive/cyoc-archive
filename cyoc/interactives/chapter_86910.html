<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ryan decided to try on the size 14 cop shoes, he figured it&#39;d be useful for perhaps a costume party or some type of event in the future and he took it in with him. Ryan put the shoes onto his feet, despite him already feeling that they were far too big for him. He cursed under his breath.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great, what a waste of my fucking time,&quot; he muttered, and as he was about to unlace the shoes, he quickly felt a sudden heat emanate from them. &quot;What the fuck?&quot; He bent down closer to try and tear them off but suddenly tripped over himself. He cursed again, this time loudly and looked down as he felt his feet begin to morph and change as they began expanding to fit the shoes on his feet. As well as this he could see his calves becoming much more muscular and larger, almost to the point of ripping his trousers. However his trousers started to become a darker shade and he realised they were changing into the trousers that cops wear.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no no! This can&#39;t be happening-&quot; However Ryan couldn&#39;t say anything else as he let out a large moan, he looked down to see his bulge getting larger as his penis was ejaculating repeatedly as it was growing. Ryan continued to moan and groan, unable to call for help as he felt a continious wave of orgasms. His trousers had now completly changed to look like part of a cop uniform, and Ryan noticed a walkie-talkie and a cop belt suddenly materialise onto his shirt which was now changing to look like part of a cop uniform. Ryan quickly unbuttoned the uniform, noticing his hands were becoming larger and more calloused as his feet were still expanding. His legs were now muscular as they could be and Ryan saw his bare chest grow a six pack, as the muscles on his chest grew.<br />
<br />
&quot;No please stop-&quot; However Ryan continued to moan and groan in orgasmic pleasure, as his hair changed to a dark mysterious brown. He started feeling hair grow all over his back, and his chest. He watched as he formed a treasure trail leading to his penis, and he felt more hair grow around his now large penis. Ryan now felt hair grow on his legs, and even some on his feet. His sexy large toes now started slowly wriggling and teasing him. His head started to feel constant pain as his genes continued to change to make him a gay sexy cop with a male foot fetish. His toes continued to tease him, making him ejaculate and orgasm even more. &quot;No, this can&#39;t be happening...stop-&quot; However Ryan was nowher near done. As his groans and moans became deeper and from a soothing sexier sounding voice, as his adams apple became larger. <br />
<br />
His head continued to change as his hair now became a dark brown and styled up in a fauxhawk style however this was all covered by a cops hat that matealiszed onto his head. Ryan felt hmself grow a thick beard, and looked in the mirror to see his facial features changed. He held his hands up to his face, in order to try and stop the changes however he felt his soft and masculine sexy hands and this brought him to orgasm even further, as his nose became flatter and his ears became bigger. He watched as his eyes became a sexy loooking green and he was forced to smile a now cocky looking smile. He ejaculated one final time, and now Ryan was someone else. <br />
<br />
He was a &#39;Calvin Kleinn&#39; underwear wearing, sexy, 6&#39;4, size 14, homosexual, male-foot fetish obsssesed cop. He got up and smiled his cocky smile before going outside the changing room, a new man.</p>
