<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;The set will be a zoo&quot; Loki said. &quot;Momo will be in a cage and big brother will be the zookeeper.&quot;<br />
&quot;And then...&quot; Thomas said as he put his brother in a miniature zoo that had appeared. &quot;A quake broke the cage! The wild ape is free and is furious!!&quot; He shook the play set until Momo&#39;s cage opened. Loki made him to be angry and he began to pursuit George. &quot;Run brother!! Run!! Momo is behind you!!&quot;<br />
&quot;Momo is hungry! Hahahaha!&quot; Loki laughed.<br />
&quot;Although all his efforts George was cornered by Momo.&quot; Thomas said. &quot;He&#39;ll need to confront him! Fortunately he was the wrestling champion in his high school, so he knows how to grapple an oponent!&quot;<br />
&quot;But what George didn&#39;t know is that Momo also knows wrestling due to genetic modifications. This fight will be at the same level!!&quot; Loki said and using his magic both George and Momo got singlets. &quot;George could wear a large size but Momo is XXXL!!&quot;<br />
&quot;Their fight is so intense!&quot; Thomas said as he played with his brother&#39;s arms. &quot;This battle could take all day but George won&#39;t give up! He uses his secret move! The flying slam!&quot; He lifted George in the air and then he left him fall over the ape. &quot;Momo was defeated!&quot;<br />
&quot;Using the last of him, Momo began to speak.&quot; Loki said.<br />
&quot;What? Can Momo speak?!!&quot; Thomas asked.<br />
&quot;Duh! We&#39;re playing.&quot; Loki answered. &quot;It&#39;s part of the game!&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah! yeah! I got it!&quot; Thomas said.<br />
&quot;Anyway... With his last breath Momo said...&quot; Loki continued. &quot;You are the new lord of the jungle...&quot;<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot; Thomas interrupted. &quot;I&#39;d seen that show!!&quot;<br />
&quot;Show? What are talking about?&quot; Loki questioned him.<br />
&quot;Tarzan, lord of the jungle!&quot; Thomas said. &quot;It&#39;s an old cartoon about Tarzan&#39;s life!&quot;<br />
&quot;Tarzan? Cartoon?&quot; Loki asked. &quot;I don&#39;t know what they are.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well... Tarzan is a fiction character... and cartoon is...umm&quot; Thomas said. &quot;An animated show? Do you get it? Maybe if we see one on the TV... don&#39;t you have a TV around here?&quot;<br />
&quot;I know what those thing are but I have never seen one before.&quot; Loki said. &quot;It&#39;s like seeing a painting and I think that it&#39;s too boring.&quot;<br />
&quot;It&#39;s way different to see a painting.&quot; Thomas answered. &quot;On TV pictures have movement like if they were alive!&quot;<br />
&quot;But I can make anything alive.&quot; Loki said and he made the George&#39;s action figure to move again. &quot;See?&quot;<br />
&quot;Hey! I can move again!!&quot; George yelled. &quot;Why did you put me a singlet?!!&quot;<br />
&quot;TV is fun!&quot; Thomas said as he ignored his brother. &quot;You should give it a try!&quot;<br />
Loki thought about it for a moment and then he nodded.<br />
&quot;Ok, I will try.&quot; He said and then he turned a wall into a huge TV screen. &quot;How do we use it?&quot;<br />
&quot;We need a TV remote.&quot; Thomas said and then a remote appeared on his hand. &quot;And then tune to a channel. Let&#39;s find some cartoons!&quot;<br />
Thomas turned on the TV and using the remote he began to look for a channel. News, sports, music videos... His searching wasn&#39;t too good and Loki was getting bored. At the end, he finally managed to find a local channel where they can see an old Tom and Jerry&#39;s episode.<br />
&quot;That&#39;s it! A cartoon!&quot; Thomas said proudly.<br />
&quot;Those animals! They behave like humans!&quot; Loki shouted. &quot;And their shape is too weird!&quot;<br />
&quot;They don&#39;t look realistic but they are way more funny than an ordinary cat or mouse.&quot; Thomas said.<br />
Then, both Thomas and Loki started to watch the cartoon. It was old but very funny. Tom was chasing Jerry as always, the hilarity of their actions, punches and running were really enjoyable and a smile can be seen on Loki&#39;s face. After a time, and a couple of comfortable couches on the room, Loki and Thomas watched the ending credits of the show.<br />
&quot;That was funny!&quot; Thomas said.<br />
&quot;Is that all?&quot; Loki complained. &quot;I want more!&quot;<br />
&quot;Hey! Don&#39;t worry.&quot; Thomas said. &quot;There are tons of shows to watch! See, there is coming an episode of Action Man!&quot;<br />
An old Action Man&#39;s episode began but after seeing a few minutes Loki was dissapointed of it.<br />
&quot;This show isn&#39;t as funny as the other one!&quot; He yelled. &quot;I want to see more of the cat and mouse show!&quot;<br />
In that moment, Action Man who was alone on the screen turned into a black mouse and his surroundings turned into a mere house. The former hero looked so astounded in front of the screen.<br />
&quot;How did you do that?!!&quot; Thomas shouted.<br />
&quot;Hey, don&#39;t you remember that I&#39;m a god? I can do almost anything I want.&quot; Loki said grinning. &quot;And I wanted to see more of the cat and mouse show!&quot;<br />
&quot;Bu-bu-but! You don&#39;t put an Tom and Jerry&#39;s episode on screen!&quot; Thomas shouted. &quot;You turned Action Man&#39;s show into Tom and Jerry&#39;s!!! Action Man is now Jerry!!!&quot;<br />
&quot;And that remembers me that I need a cat. Let see...&quot; Loki said and he began to look around him. &quot;You can do it.&quot;<br />
He pointed to the miniature George who was trying to escape under a door. He disappeared and then reappeared on screen just behind of the Action Man Jerry. He had recovered his former size but he was trapped on the show.<br />
&quot;George!&quot; Thomas yelled. &quot;He&#39;s on the TV!!&quot;<br />
&quot;He won&#39;t escape there.&quot; Loki said. &quot;And we can have some fun watching him trying to chase that black mouse.&quot;<br />
He snapped and George began to transform into an animated cat. His hands and feet turned into oversized cat paws. His muscular arms and legs transformed into the skinny and flexible ones of an orange cat. Finally his torso and head transformed and now George looked like an orange version of Tom. At the end, a cat tail popped out from his butt making a silly sound.<br />
George tried to yell but nothing came from his mouth. Tom and Jerry were mute after all. After he realized he can&#39;t speak he made a tantrum accompanied by the music. It was too loudly that the black Jerry turned back and saw at the orange cat who looked huge for his small size. He began to run scared but George didn&#39;t chase him.<br />
&quot;You need some motivation, don&#39;t you?&quot; Loki said at the screen. &quot;Listen, George the cat, I will turn you back to human if you can chase that mouse. Do it and I will make all normal again and I will leave this world forever.&quot;<br />
George didn&#39;t trust at all and refused to move.<br />
&quot;Are you telling the truth?&quot; George asked.<br />
&quot;Absolutely.&quot; Loki said. &quot;I will precast the spell and put it on that mouse. At the moment he put the mouse on his mouth, the spell will activate.&quot;<br />
George saw how some magic sparkles now surrounded the black mouse and he decided to chase him. He didn&#39;t have any other choice after all.<br />
&quot;Wow! I&#39;m surprised that you have made that!&quot; Thomas said to Loki.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not a completely fool, my friend.&quot; Loki said. &quot;Remember that mouse is actually an action hero. Also, I heard of you a few moments ago that in this show the cat always chase the mouse but he never get it. Your brother will have a good challenge to spend his time and we can enjoy watching it.&quot;</p>
