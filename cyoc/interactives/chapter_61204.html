<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rowan began the day, much like yesterday. Some old folks wanted to get pulled around town in the cab, two <br />
elderly women. <br />
<br />
&quot;Tell Rowan where you want to go.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, just around the park. I heard from Bertha here that it was a pleasant trip around the park. Why, this <br />
trusty steed of your's reminds me of the one I had on my farm when I was a little girl. . . But not as large. <br />
I never seen such a large horse.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, yes, it was a fun trip. A smooth ride, the horse didn't even stop once. Quite a strong fellow. He'd make <br />
a wonderful workhorse.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rowan whinnied with joy, and probably be blushing if he were still human. He was used to getting attention <br />
silently, but compliments out in the open were rarely heard of. Though he quickly grimaced inside once he <br />
remembered what his current state was.<br />
<br />
&quot;I doubt he's like the horse you had.&quot; With that, Roger leaned back and put his hands behind his head. The two <br />
elderly women were confused, since the cabbie was supposed to direct the horse. However, Rowan kicked right <br />
into gear and began going around the park.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Martha look, he's going all by himself!&quot;<br />
&quot;How is he doing that?&quot; <br />
<br />
Roger laughed to himself as he just sat back and relaxed, poor Rowan doing all the work like yesterday, but at <br />
least he was getting the credit. As Rowan went through the park, the passersby looked at him, as if he were on <br />
fire. Well, a horse going by itself with no direction is something that one doesn't see everyday. Or at all, <br />
for that matter. After thirty minutes, the old ladies paid the cabbie and gave him an extra 150 dollars.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was something new alright, use that money to buy that wonderful horse something nice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, like a burger.&quot; Roger said with a smile, causing the two old women to laugh as they walked off. As soon <br />
as the old women were done, droves of the previous onlookers came around the cabbie and asked how much it was, <br />
swarming Roger with proposals and what not. Most of them were older folks as well, but after seeing how much <br />
fun the two women had, they figured it'd be something worth checking out. That and the horse was going by <br />
itself was something to marvel at too.<br />
<br />
<br />
- - - - -<br />
<br />
The day was over now, and Rowan was slowly trotting his way back home. He was exhausted, he was going nonstop <br />
with nothing to eat or drink, pulling loads of people.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rowan, you're a godsend.&quot; Roger said, counting all the money and tips he had gotten. &quot;150 dollars per person <br />
for 30 minutes and everyone still jumped on that offer as if it were cheap! And the tips, oh, even better. <br />
That one man gave me 1,000 dollars just to see you write your name and record it! Let's see. . . We have 9,630 <br />
dollars. I should call a news station, imagine the business I'd get then. &quot;<br />
<br />
Rowan's head was hanging low, trying to focus on the ground to see where he was walking. Each time he blinked, <br />
he kept his eyes closed for longer and longer. Rowan made it to his new home, but missed didn't see the <br />
pothole. . . He got stuck. . . The cart kept going. . . CRACK! It all happened so fast, and now Rowan was <br />
alert, felling excruciating pain in his leg. My leg, my leg! Call a doctor, I need to get this fixed and get a <br />
cast right aw-I'm a horse. Rowan felt light headed, this was the end of his life as a horse, in general. <br />
Horses didn't get casts, they got an all-expenses-paid vacation to heaven. The pain had already made him tear <br />
up, but now the water works were out of control. The heavy cab plowed into his back leg, game over. Roger <br />
froze for a second then threw down his hat. He hopped from the cab, and immediately began beating Rowan.<br />
<br />
&quot;What, look what you did! Rowan! You-YOU! RUINED ME!&quot; Roger yelled. After playing nice, all the man could <br />
think about is money. Rowan wasn't much different, but he'd never hurt an animal or a person who didn't <br />
deserve it. &quot;Oh wait, genius horse, right, you can still write. That's got to be something for making money, <br />
right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Light bulb! Rowan remembered he could write to communicate with Roger, though he was just too tired to think <br />
about it until now. He figured if he could be changed back, he could just get a cast and call it a day. He <br />
mustered all his strength to balance himself, one leg short, and hastily wrote in the dirt. Roger saw what <br />
Rowan was doing, but couldn't read it that well, so he went indoors to get a flashlight to read it better. And <br />
talk about perfect timing, Rowan was almost done when Roger got back. <br />
<br />
Roger shinned the light down to where Rowan was writing to find words scrunched together, squinting to see if <br />
he could make out what it said. &quot;Help. . . I human. . . Chinese man make. . . me horse. . .&quot; Roger  finally <br />
said out loud, shining the light on Rowan's face now. &quot;You're joking. Are you serious?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rowan nodded twice before putting his head down.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's it. Sit tight, Rowan!&quot;<br />
<br />
- - - - -<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Rowan, I'm back.&quot; Roger called out, toting a small bag. Possibly the largest load he ever had to carry. <br />
&quot;I slid the Chinaman 8,630 dollars and he anted up the real deal and I called a doctor friend who's good at <br />
emergency patchin' up. The best. He'd help for just 1,000 dollars. Now drink this, hurry, come on, up boy!&quot;<br />
<br />
Rowan, at this point, looked as if he were dead. Though he was just tired and the pain was too much to bear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on Rowan, drink it, drink it!&quot; Roger was panicking, acting as if his true love was dying in his arms. <br />
Though it was probably just guilt, because if Rowan was indeed human, he had done something incredibly <br />
horrible. Finally, Rowan mustered the strength to drink the liquid, which quickly took affect. He didn't know <br />
what to expect, and figured the Ointment Store Owner would've screwed both of them over. Then again, there was <br />
no reason for the Ointment Store Owner to give Roger the wrong remedy.</p>
