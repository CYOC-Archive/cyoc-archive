<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Patrick felt Bud’s cock slip out of him as the man stood up, sending him to the ground. “2021! Are you fucking kidding me!” Bud yelled in a deep, thunderous voice as he started pacing around the room. “Almost forty years!”<br />
<br />
“Hey, Bud, calm down, I have neighbors…” Patrick began, but Bud cut him off.<br />
<br />
“Fuck your neighbors!” He yelled. “Damn it, that bitch! She stole my life!” He ceased his pacing and fell back into the bed, clutching his head. Patrick couldn’t help but feel empathy for the man. He had been dominant, aggressive, but also passionate, and gentle. It had all been a jarring experience, having a man as big and intimidating as Bud just appear inside of his apartment, and yet he never felt like he was in danger. Patrick found himself drawn to the big man’s side, wrapping one arm around his back while with the other I caressed his warm chest. <br />
<br />
“I’m sorry, Bud, that this all happened to you,” he said.<br />
<br />
“Carson,” was all Bud said in response.<br />
<br />
“What?”<br />
<br />
“My name is Carson. Bud was my stage name,” he said. His hand moved to cover Patrick’s hand as it rested on his firm pectoral. <br />
<br />
“Oh. Well, its nice to officially meet you, Carson.”<br />
<br />
“Nice to meet you too, Patrick,” He half smiled. “God damn, I knew time was going by. But, 30 years?”<br />
<br />
“You weren’t stuck in that case the whole time, were you?” Patrick asked him.<br />
<br />
“I don’t think so. I think I got bought and sold a few times. I remember turning into a living cock, whenever someone would use me, finally being able to feel and move, even if I still couldn’t see or hear.” He shook his head. “Somehow I’d always end up back at the shop.”<br />
<br />
“How could you tell?”<br />
<br />
Carson chuckled. “We can talk to each other. Those of us who are transformed into her toys? We can hear each other’s thoughts, when we’re close enough. I knew I was back whenever I could hear my old buddies close by.”<br />
<br />
“Maybe there’s a way to break the curse?” Patrick said. “Maybe we can find help…”<br />
<br />
“All my wizard friends are probably dead or at the very least not here. Do you know any?” Carson asked innocently.<br />
<br />
“Wizards?” Patrick laughed. “No. I don’t know any wizards.”<br />
<br />
“Huh. In my day, you’d run into wizards all the time.” Carson sighed. “They’ve always been in the closet too, so to speak.”<br />
<br />
“Glad its not like that anymore. Well, not as much, anyway,” Patrick mused.<br />
<br />
Carson turned to him and frowned. “What do you mean?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, shit, right! Okay, first off, gay marriage is legal. All 50 states,” Patrick began.<br />
<br />
Carson gave him a skeptical look. “You’re joking.”<br />
<br />
“No, man! Things have changed a lot. I mean, there’s still a lot of work to be done, and we’ve kind of taken a few steps back these last few years, but—”<br />
<br />
“Alright, that’s enough,” Carson said, his voice short. “I can’t process this any more tonight.” he leaned his back on the bed, stretching out and rubbing his face. Once again, Patrick was taken aback by fascination with this handsome specimen of a man, his big head propped up on the pillows, his hands resting on his broad, hairy belly, and his thick legs open to expose his thick, soft cock and balls. His brow furrowed, his busy eye brows coming together as he looked at Patrick, shaking his head in such a way as to beckon the younger man closer. Patrick crept up to him and nestled himself under the mans big arm, snuggling against his chest. Carson’s arm drifted down to take a firm hold of Patrick’s ass as the other swung around to pull him close and tight. <br />
<br />
“I never even asked. You got a man, Patrick?” Carson said quietly, after a moment.<br />
<br />
“I did,” Patrick answered. “But he broke up with me about a month ago.”<br />
<br />
“That’s a bummer,” He gave Patrick’s cheek a squeeze. “Why?”<br />
<br />
“I wasn’t adventurous enough. I had some…mental issues to work out, but he said I was ‘too vanilla’.” <br />
<br />
“What an ass.” Carson retorted. “A real man would help his boy learn what pleasure is all about.”<br />
<br />
Patrick’s cock stirred. <br />
<br />
“You’ve got a perfect ass, and you seem like a good person. You just need a man whose patient.” He growled, his hand slipping between Patrick’s cheeks to massage his hole. Patrick moaned as the man softly manipulated him with his big, deft fingers. <br />
<br />
“You see, boy? You want it, so bad, I can tell,” he slipped a big finger inside and Patrick gasped and took a tight grip of Carson’s wiry chest hair.<br />
<br />
He did want it, Patrick realized, as he felt a second finger join the first. Carson thrust his fingers lightly into him, while Patrick reached down to take a hold of the man’s growing erection. Carson groaned and increased the measure of his thrusts as Patrick began to stroke the man’s hard shaft. He rubbed his thumb along the head and played with his foreskin, prompting Carson to insert a third finger. Patrick moaned like he was in heat at the pleasure radiating from his ass as Carson fingered him. He never knew his ass could feel so good! He could feel himself almost melting, his flesh gladly yielding to the man’s gentle but through ministrations. His cock was throbbing and leaking and Patrick hadn’t even touched it. It ignited something in him, something carnal, and Patrick pulled away from Carson’s chest to deliver a strong, forceful kiss unto the bearded man’s lips. Carson pushed against him just as eagerly, his rough tongue pushing past Patrick’s lips to explore within and caress Patrick’s own. They made out passionately, Patrick teasing and stroking the head of Carson’s cock while Carson played Patrick’s ass like a piano. After what felt like a long while, Patrick couldn’t help himself and broke away from Carson, kissing his neck, his hairy chest, and down along his stomach as he made his way to the man’s groin. Carson picked up on what Patrick was doing and gently removed his fingers to let Patrick move down to a more comfortable position.<br />
<br />
Patrick kissed his way down to the base of Carson’s pulsing cock. He knew they’d just fucked, but Patrick wanted to suck Carson’s beautiful cock so bad that he didn’t care. Using his mouth, he picked up the heavy cock by the head and inhaled the first few inches, prompting a groan from the man.<br />
<br />
“Take your time, boy.” Carson growled, folding his arms behind his head. “The sun ain’t up yet.”<br />
<br />
Patrick hummed around Carson’s shaft, running his tongue along the underside and massaging it with his lips. He took one of Carson’s hairy balls in his hand and began to squeeze and massage them. Patrick relaxed himself and tried to take Carson’s cock deeper, gagging a bit when he felt the head reach the back of his throat.<br />
<br />
“Relax your throat, babe,” Carson cooed in his deep voice. “Straighten out a little, like that, yeah.” Then Patrick felt Carson jump in the bed. “Careful with the teeth,” he warned. Patrick took a deep breath through his nose and carefully brought himself down more until he felt Carson’s pubic hair tickling his nose. “Excellent, baby. You’re almost there.” Almost? Patrick’s eyes were watering, his throat felt stretched to the max and he thought for a moment he was going to throw up, but he’d never been harder. He took another breath and pulled back a few inches before pushing himself back down again, pressing his face against Carson’s crotch. Carson groaned, his hands coming down to hold onto Patrick’s head. “Perfect, baby.”<br />
<br />
Patrick would have smiled if he could. He experimented by thrusting himself on the man’s cock a few times, slowly. The unpleasant sensations had diminished; his throat felt relaxed and open, each thrust becoming easier and meeting less resistance. After a minute, Patrick found that he was able to pull Carson completely out before swallowing him to the hilt in one go. From there, Patrick took over. He made love to Carson’s cock, pulling himself up to kiss and lick the bulbous head, giving the shaft long, quick strokes. He continued stroking while he leaned down to lick Carson’s big balls; he took one of them into his mouth and stroked and squeezed it with his tongue, making the man gasp and buck against him. Carson wrapped his legs around Patrick’s torso as Patrick did the same to his other nut before returning to the man’s engorged cock. As soon as the purple head entered his mouth Patrick began to face-fuck himself against it while stroking himself. He couldn’t imagine being anywhere else, with anywhere else. Patrick desperately began to wish for a way to help this man break his curse. Anything at all….<br />
<br />
Patrick’s fervor increased as worked on Carson’s cock; Carson was gripping the sheets and arching his back as Patrick licked and caressed and sucked every inch he could reach. <br />
<br />
“It’s coming, babe. You ready for it?” Carson breathed.<br />
<br />
Patrick could only give him the thumbs up as he was down to the hilt, his tongue reaching out to lick Carson’s hairy ballsack.<br />
<br />
“Oh, shit, boy. Just like that,” he huffed and groaned, until one of his hands reached out to take a firm grip of Patrick’s hair as he thrust himself into the younger man’s face as hard as he could. Patrick could feel the cock throbbing, feel the man’s big balls squeezing out their load in his hands as it pumped down his throat. His stomach began to feel warm, his skin electric, as the beginning of an orgasm of his own seemed to overtake him. Patrick was in ecstasy; he had barely even touched his cock and he was coming just from swallowing Carson’s load? Or so he thought, before the warmth of pleasure seemed to radiate to the tips of his very limbs. He felt like his arms and legs were melting, his body becoming small and light, but all the while Carson’s cock never left his maw. Patrick would barely notice if he had; his mind was hazy from his orgasm, his vision, his sense of smell all slowly dampening before disappearing all together.<br />
<br />
Soon the sensations faded and Patrick tried to remove himself from Carson’s cock, but he found he couldn’t. He couldn’t move anything at all, not even his lips. Patrick immediately started to panic; he couldn’t see or smell or feel anything. Not the temperature around him or anything other than the tight, full sensation of Carson’s cock still embedded within him. And then he heard a voice.<br />
<br />
“Shit,” he recognized Carson’s voice, only it sounded like it came from within Patrick’s mind, and not like words said aloud. “That was amazing. This boy is a natural. Wait, where’d he go…” the voice trailed off and suddenly Patrick could see something; it was hazy, but he realized it was his bedroom. The point of view looked down an expanse of hairy skin, and to a flesh-toned, plastic device jutting from a hairy crotch and a pair of beefy, splayed legs.<br />
<br />
“Holy shit!” came Carson’s voice again, but louder this time. He must be talking aloud. “Patrick! Patrick!” he yelled, before looking down at himself again. “A fleshlight? How did he turn into a flesh light?” Carson asked aloud again. A big hand reached into the field of vision and gave the object a tug. At the same time, Patrick felt something beg clamp around his body and jerk him backwards.<br />
<br />
“Carson, stop!” Patrick shouted from his mind. <br />
<br />
“Patrick! That really is you!” Carson thought at him.<br />
<br />
“What’s happening? Why can’t I move or see anything?” Patrick asked frantically.<br />
<br />
“I think you somehow took on my curse!” Carson said. “That fucking bitch,” Carson seethed. <br />
<br />
“What does that mean? Are you human again? Will I ever be?” Patrick’s fear and panic spilled into Carson’s mind, making the man flinch away.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry, boy,” Carson said, taking a firmer hold of Patrick’ plastic body. “She stole thirty years from me. I won’t let her do the same to you.”<br />
<br />
“Maybe if you jerk off in me, I’ll turn human again, like you did?” Patrick offered.<br />
<br />
Carson felt uneasy. He was angry and horrified that this could have happened to Patrick, especially when he was in the throes of a fantastic orgasm courtesy of the boy. But he just might be fully human again, and despite his feelings for Patrick, a part of him was too afraid to take the risk of taking on the curse again.<br />
<br />
“Maybe,” Carson replied after a moment, trying his best to guard his thoughts. “I’ll need some time to recoup if you want me to blow a third load,” he chuckled at him.<br />
<br />
“I couldn’t hear you when you were a dildo. Why can you hear me?” Patrick asked.<br />
<br />
“Probably because now we’ve both been tainted by the same magic.” Carson said, his thoughts grim. “We’re going to find a way out of this, Patrick. For both our sakes, I promise.” Carson said, but he knew that would be easier said than done.</p>
