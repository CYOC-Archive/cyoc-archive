<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Four AM and Monica&#39;s phone alarm went off.  She came home last night angry and directly went to bed without telling Damon that she loved him or eating dinner.  However what she didn&#39;t remember is setting the alarm on her phone.  It didn&#39;t matter, she knew she was going to be having an interesting day.  The thought that as soon as she stepped off that bus and it went away, she&#39;d regain her senses and with it, the realization of the stuff she did during the day.  She wasn&#39;t looking forward to that.  She didn&#39;t want to remember helplessly shitting herself or getting her bib messy while eating food.  It seemed disgusting to her.  No matter, though.  At least she got a twelve hour reprieve of her pending humiliation when she got to her new school, if you could even call it that.  She didn&#39;t know that while she was sleeping Damon had taken the liberty of stripping her out of her clothes and diaper, cleaned her up, and changed her into fresh white panties and pajamas.  She was happy to be in fresh panties, but she knew it wouldn&#39;t last.  And so she set about changing out of her Pajamas into some day clothes.  She didn&#39;t know what to wear since she somehow knew that it didn&#39;t matter what she wore.  As soon as she was on the bus, they would change with her.  But, she opened up her panty drawer anyway.  When she opened it, beside her panties were the same thick disposable diapers she wore last night.  She really didn&#39;t want to wear a diaper, but took one anyway because it didn&#39;t matter.  In an hour, she&#39;d be sitting in one anyway.  And so, she leaned against a wall and fastened the thick diaper around her waist.  She went to her closet to pull out a pair of pants and a T-shirt, but discovered the same thing.  Beside her regular pants, hung her special shorts in various colors and styles.  Again, she felt defeated and just grabbed the first shirt she got.  It was pink like yesterday, but this time, it had a teddy bear on it.  She put it on and then grabbed a pink corduroy pair of shortalls with snaps in the crotch and an elastic waist band and pulled them on.  The shortalls fit her well even though her diaper was thick.  The diaper caused the seat of her shortalls to bulge out and her diaper could be clearly seen though the leg holes because the legs of her shortalls were cut short.  She grabbed a pair of socks from the sock drawer and found the gray velcro shoes she had on yesterday and put them on.  On the top of her dresser sat her bib, but she also saw something new, a tan helmet with a foam interior and a hard plastic exterior.  She winced as she placed the bib around her neck and then she put on her helmet and fastened the straps below her chin.  There was a ring at the doorbell and heard Damon answer it.  Damnit, she didn&#39;t  have time to eat, brush her teeth, or her hair.  She knew what she had to do.  She swallowed hard, opened her bedroom door and entered the hall to go down the stairs.  As she descended the stairs, she noticed two people, a man and a woman standing there at the door talking to Damon.  But, in front of them was an odd sight.  There was a wheelchair/stroller combination type thing with straps.  Looking at it made her heart sink.  She simply hung her head and shame, finished descending the stairs and took her place in the chair silently.  The lady said, &quot;Why hello there, Monica, are you ready for your first day of school?&quot;  Monica was looking down, she would have rather stayed home and in bed.  She was tired.  However, that didn&#39;t happen.  Instead, the woman proceeded to strap her wheelchair or stroller harness around her and secure her in.  The man than said good-bye to Damon, turned Monica around in her chair, and rolled her out of the house and down her cement walkway.  She looked up, saw the bus and then got a pounding headache.  Just a suddenly as it started, it stopped, but Monica wasn&#39;t Monica anymore.  No, in her mind, she was just another retarded  kid who was going to another wonderful day of special education.  The male worker wheeled her towards the back of the bus where a lift came down while the female worker boarded the bus from the front.  After it descended, she the male worker wheeled onto it and strapped the wheelchair down to it.  The male worker boarded the front of the bus himself while the lift lifted Monica up on so that she was level with the bus&#39;s door.  At the top, she was again greeted by the female worker who unstrapped her wheelchair from the lift and wheeled it to the front of the bus.  Again, her wheel chair was strapped down, but this time to restraints on the bus so that the wheelchair wouldn&#39;t roll or fall during bus&#39;s transit.  The male worker, now seated in the driver&#39;s seat pushed a button causing the front door to close and the lift at the back to lift up into a vertical position and slide in.  After that, the lift door closed while the female worker sat in the seat next to Monica.  At around 5:15 AM, the short bus slowly departed from Monica&#39;s house to her new school.  The reason she saw no other students on the bus except her was because she was the first to be picked up.  Four other students needed to be picked up on this route and it would take time to board them all and make it to school.  After all, classes started at 6 AM.  The realization that she was the first student to be picked up and the last to be dropped off never hit her.  Instead, she was content to sit in her wheelchair, drool, and bang her head against the window.  Neither of her workers paid it no mind.  Banging her head was already in her charts and her special helmet would protect her head from injury without breaking the glass.  A little pee spurted into her thirsty diaper.  It was going to be a great day!  She just didn&#39;t know it, yet.</p>
