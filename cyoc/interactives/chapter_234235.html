<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I decided to pick all of the junior cheerleaders for the next trick. &quot;Will the following six lovely ladies please join me on stage. Tabby, Lupé, Bernadette, Bessie,  Rosalind, and Zoe.&quot; The audience applauded while they eagerly climbed onto the stage.<br />
<br />
Tabby was was a red head with bright green eyes, dressed in what appeared to be a bikini and body paint that made her look like a tiger. She had a tiger tail attach to the back, with some rounded striped ears on the top of her head.<br />
<br />
 Some of others did not show as much skin. Lupé for example. who was Hispanic. Her outfit to be wolf ears with a lot of fur, and a tail. Bernadette was a blonde in a bear onesie. Rosalind and Zoe also wore animal onesies but while Rosalind was a horse, Zoe was a zebra. The last member was a bit more creative.<br />
<br />
Bessie had black hair and wore cut off jeans,  boots, and a cow print bikini top. She also had some cow ear head bands and horns sticking out of her cowboy hat. On the back of her pants she had a short cow&#39;s tail. She tipped her hat to the audience, revealing the cow horns were attacked to the brim of the hat. The ears however were attached to a headband she wore.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, I can&#39;t help but notice that all of you dressed in animal theme, but despite being cheerleaders none of you picked our school Mascot.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was Bessie who responded. &quot;Well, we are the battling badgers, but that isn&#39;t exactly easy to make into a sexy costume. Even cows can be cute if you go for a cowgirl theme.&quot; There were some cheers from the audience from guys showing their appreciation of her costume.<br />
<br />
I nodded. &quot;Well, I&#39;m sure a lot of us haven&#39;t been impressed with being the badgers.&quot; There were grumbles of agreement from the audience. &quot;So, how about you girls help us pick a Mascot?&quot;<br />
<br />
Bessie crossed her arms under her breasts. &quot;How do we do that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Simple,&quot; I smiled. &quot;We are going to perform a few tricks to help ypur costumes seem more authentic.&quot; I then waved my hands to the audience. &quot;Afterwards, everyone here will have a chance to vote for our new Mascot. The lucky winner will spend the rest of the season as our Mascot while the others have to return to being regular cheerleaders.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you really convince the school to change the Mascot?&quot; Bessie asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Trust me, I&#39;ll have them change it. Almost like magic. What do you say?&quot;<br />
<br />
The girls discussed it with each other. There were a few shrugs but eventually they sent Bessie back as their spokeswoman. &quot;We are in.&quot;<br />
<br />
The crowd cheered their approval. &quot;All right Bessie, if you please be my lead assistant, we can get started.&quot; She quickly agreed, and helped me station four panels laying flat on the stage. They were arranged with their corners touching leaving an empty square inbetween them. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now, I will ask Rosalind and Zoe to step in this space here to check the floor for any trap holes.&quot; The two girls entered the area and started searching. &quot;You may need to get on all fours to really look for it.&quot; They got down on their hands and knees but couldn&#39;t find anything. Zoe started to stand up but I stopped her. &quot;Don&#39;t bother, you are about to be on all fours for the rest of the night.&quot;<br />
<br />
That got some chuckles. &quot;Now Bessie, feel free to pick one of your reaming squad mates to hold the back panel. Make sure it&#39;s someone you know won&#39;t let Rosalind or Zoe sneak out the back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bessie thought about it. &quot;Bernadette definitely wouldn&#39;t.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, would our strong bear please hold the back panel.&quot; Bernadette lifted the back panel giving us the first wall. While she was hidden from view, she wouldn&#39;t be the one changing. Yet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now I suppose it doesn&#39;t matter who goes on which side. Lupé, Tabby.&quot; Without explaining they grabbed a panel on either side, creating a small room. Zoe and Rosalind were surrounded on three sides, only the side facing the audience was still open. Rosalind ignored this, still dutifully looking for a trap door that wasn&#39;t there. Zoe sat crouched down seeming uncertain. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well ladies, I won&#39;t be able to call you that soon because we are about to say goodbye to your humanity. Wave to the audience.&quot; Zoe waved uncomfortably while Rosalind waved enthusiastically. &quot;Anything to say to your boyfriends?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s been fun. Hope you like horses.&quot; Rosalind nearly cheered. <br />
<br />
&quot;You better be single when Joey turns us back.&quot; Zoe grumbled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now Bessie, if you could lift up the final panel.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bessie did, as the two cheerleaders within waved one last time. While they were cut off from view, I made a wish in his ring. &quot;Now, on the count of three everyone drop your panels.&quot; I didn&#39;t need to delay since the change had already taken place, I just wanted to make sure it was synchronized. &quot;One...two...three!&quot;<br />
<br />
The panels were dropped to reveal a large horse and a small zebra within. &quot;What beautifully, majestic creature. We&#39;d be lucky to have either one, but I think we could use some more options. What do you think Bessie?&quot;<br />
<br />
Bessie stared in confusion. &quot;Where&#39;d they go?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s them right there.&quot; I told her.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a neat trick, and Rosalind was always a horse girl so she would love this if it was real, but seriously how&#39;d you do it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like we have a none believer. Let&#39;s see if we can convince Bessie magic is real before it&#39;s her turn.&quot; The crowd cheered. &quot;Bessie, can you please bring on the cage for the next trick? Monique should have it lined up on the edge back stage.&quot; <br />
<br />
Bessie left to get the cage, while I dealt with the former humans. Both the horse and the zebra had on reigns and I handed them to Bernadette and Lupé and directed them to lead the animals to opposite sides of the stage. That left me and Tabby center stage.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you think of our first two options for Mascot?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They are amazing. Not sure if I can beat them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t be so modest. Tigers are fearsome creatures and everyone would love to have one as a Mascot.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bessie returned with a cage. There was a curtain already hiding the back and sides. &quot;Well, here we are. Who&#39;s next?&quot;<br />
<br />
I gestured for Tabby to enter the cage, which she did. Closing the door, I made sure to lock it. Then I reached in and took one of her hands. &quot;Tabby, since your friend is such a doubter, I was wondering if you could help convince her magic is real.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure. How do I do that?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
I reached between the bars of the cage and took her hand, gently guiding it out. &quot;First, let&#39;s hold this out as long as possible.&quot; While her hand was outside of the cage I started to grab the curtain from the side.<br />
<br />
Holding it up, I pointed out a hole in it. &quot;Now, we are going to have your arm go through this hole so we know you are still in there, even if we can&#39;t see you.&quot; As she put her arm through the hole, I made sure the audience could see both sides of the curtain. &quot;Now Bessie, I would like you to hold Tabby&#39;s hand until further notice.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bessie walked around and held her friend&#39;s hand. Confirming it was in fact Tabby she was holding on to, I pulled the curtain over the rested of the cage, hiding the rest of Tabby from view. <br />
<br />
&quot;How is it in there Tabby?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dark.&quot; She responded. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;m sure you will be seeing a lot better in the dark soon. I want Bessie to slowly guide your arm back into the cage, but don&#39;t let go of her hand until I say so. While we are doing this, please keep talking to us. Why did you dress as a tiger tonight?&quot;<br />
<br />
Bessie slowly fed the orange painted arm into the cage while Tabby explained. &quot;Well, my dad always called me Tabby-Cat when I was little. I always wanted to do something cat related, but tigers are the biggest cats around. They are tough, beautiful, and go with my red hair.&quot;<br />
<br />
At this point, only Tabby&#39;s hand was still outside the cage, grasping Bessie&#39;s. &quot;Okay, keep one or two fingers on Bessie, but can you wave for us?&quot; Tabby wiggled some fingers. &quot;Any last words?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Vote for Tabby for Mascot?&quot; She asked a bit uncertain. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, let go of Bessie and pull you hand in.&quot; Tabby did, and as soon as her hand was put of sight, I pulled the curtain away revealing the large tiger within. Bessie&#39;s eyes grew with shock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Still don&#39;t believe in magic?&quot; I asked her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...well....&quot; she looked down on herself. &quot;You&#39;re going to turn me into a fat cow aren&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
I smiled. &quot;Not yet. Next up is Lupé.&quot; I pushed the cage off to the side with the zebra where the wolf girl stood. &quot;Are you ready to join us?<br />
<br />
She nodded. &quot;Sure.&quot; As Lupé joined us center stage, I sent Bessie off to get the next box. This one had a clear door, and a light in the back, and an opening at the top.<br />
<br />
Waving my hand, I made it look like I was hypnotizing Lupé. She slowly started to lean back, but did not fall. Instead, she floated. She continued to float higher, until she was higher than the top of the box. All the time she slowly rotated. <br />
<br />
&quot;Bessie, help me position the box.&quot; We both moved it under Lupé. Since the box was taller than us it took a moment to see if we lined it up right. <br />
<br />
Lupé was now floating upside down, her arms dangling below her. I stood in front of the box and made a downward motion with my hand. Lupé started to decend. The audience could see the top half of her body within the box, while her legs were still above the box.<br />
<br />
I pulled a curtain from the top to hide the inside of the box. However, a very clear silhouette of Lupé could still be scene. Once inside the box she continued to rotate until she was parallel with the ground. The shadow slowly started to change until the shape inside was no long a girl but a wolf, and a loud howl was heard from within.<br />
<br />
I lifter the curtain to so the large wolf could be seen. She paced back and forth as we pushed the wolf to the side of the stage where Bernadette stood with the horse. I held out my hand to her and she took it.<br />
<br />
Guiding Bernadette to the center of the stage, Bessie was already bring the next prop, being beckoned by Monique. This box was a slim rectangle, that reached up past Bernadette&#39;s height.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, before you go into the box, do you want to tell us why you picked a bear?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, when Tabby suggested we go as animals, I decided to go as a bear, because I love teddy bears.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fair enough, how about you step in the box now.&quot; I told her while opening the door.<br />
<br />
Bernadette waved. &quot;Bye everyone! Go bears!&quot; She then went into the box, and I closed the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bessie, mind helping me spin this box?&quot; We turned the box around, showing all sides. Once we had it facing forward, both of us took a step back. I snapped my fingers and suddenly the box shook. The box fell apart, ripped to pieces by the large brown bear within. It gave a loud roar, followed a yawn. The bear that was Bernadette walked over to the back of the stage and curled into a ball for a nap. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it is getting colder.&quot; I turned to Bessie. &quot;And then there was one. You&#39;ve been a big help, but as our last cheerleader on stage, you know what comes next.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bessie looked down in resignation. &quot;Yeah.&quot; She was quiet for a moment before continuing. &quot;You know, cows aren&#39;t much better as a Mascot then badgers. Maybe I could stay out of this competition.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Quitting without a fight? Doesn&#39;t sound like the cheerleader mentality. Why did you choose a cow anyway?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you may have noticed I&#39;m a bit top heavy.&quot; Bessie gave a bit of a hop to make her breasts jiggle.<br />
<br />
I was momentarily distracted by them. &quot;No. Not even once. Never thought took there.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I the other girls made jokes about my milk jugs, and I decided to go with it and be a cowgirl. Now, im going to be a cow. I worked hard dieting and exercising for these curves, and that&#39;s about to go to waste.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, round is a curve. Time for your trick. Do you mind getting on your hands and knees.&quot; Bessie did as I asked. &quot;Wave bye to the audience. Do you mind giving us a &#39;go cows&#39; or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
Bessie waved glumley. &quot;Don&#39;t vote for me. Wolves, tigers, and bears are much cooler mascots.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OH my.&quot; I said with a chuckle. I threw a cloth over her, leaving her hidden as a small shape underneath. &quot;Now, the cow goes what?&quot;<br />
<br />
Bessie gave an annoyed &quot;Moo.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, that&#39;s not the enthusiasm cheerleaders are known for. Let&#39;s try that again. The cow goes...&quot;<br />
<br />
Bessie did her best giving a loud and cheerful &quot;Moooo&quot; suddenly her shape under the cloth expanded and the sound of her voice grew deeper. Soon the shape under the cloth was almost as tall as me and much larger.<br />
<br />
Pulling the cloth off I revealed the large cow that was underneath it, now complete with a bell around her neck.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s our last audition. Remember, everyone can vote once, please turn in your choices on a piece of paper with your name on them to the cheer captain. At the end of the night the other girls will be returned to normal while the winner gets a longer stay in the animal kingdom. For now, let&#39;s get the animals off stage and get some new volunteers.&quot;</p>
