<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Then suddenly, he reached out and grabbed hold of your wrist. Instinctively you yelped and pulled away, stumbling backwards onto your heels. You tried to pull free, but the wolf held tight, pulling you closer towards him. Then slowly, he leaned in close, pressing his muzzle against yours.<br />
<br />
His breath smelled like rotten meat, and his tongue tasted bitter cold.<br />
&quot;I see.&quot; The wolf spoke softly, closing his eyes. &quot;So you have awakened. I&#39;m so glad...&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly you felt a jolt of electricity shoot through your veins, and your head began spinning. Suddenly your vision blurred, and you couldn&#39;t breathe. They started rubbing themselves over you, pushing their paws between your legs, squeezing your chest, licking your neck and ears. All while whispering in your ear how happy they were, and telling you how special you were.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmph... Mmhh~&quot; You moaned weakly, unable to move.<br />
The wolf chuckled lightly, and then bit down on your shoulder, hard. You cried out loudly in pain, clutching tightly at your shoulder. The wolf laughed louder, nipping playfully at your flesh.<br />
<br />
Your skin began to itch as the curse mark awakened, spreading across your body rapidly. Within seconds, you felt warmth spread from your shoulders, down your arms, and throughout your entire torso. Your hands twitched uncontrollably, and you gasped for air as your lungs burned.<br />
<br />
Slowly the wolf let go of your arm, letting you fall to the ground. You coughed violently, trying desperately to catch your breath.<br />
&quot;Hahaha! Very good little human.&quot; The wolf cackled, watching you struggle to stand upright. &quot;Now that you&#39;re awake, there is only one thing left for me to do. To claim my prize.&quot;<br />
<br />
He licked his lips hungrily, growling as he stared down at you. Then without warning, he lunged forwards and pressed himself firmly against you once more, biting into your shoulder and ripping open your shirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahh!!!&quot; You screamed out in pain, struggling to get away. But the wolf wasn&#39;t about to give up easily, grabbing hold of you and forcing you back towards him. With every inch he pushed you deeper inside the trees, until soon enough you fell to your knees, panting heavily.<br />
&quot;AHHH!!&quot; You cried out again, feeling something hot press against your thigh. It was followed by another burning sensation, and then a third. And before long it became too painful to bear.<br />
<br />
As you struggled to fight off the heat within you, the wolf forced himself further into your thighs. Soon enough you felt something warm begin to spill out, dripping down onto your legs. When the first stream hit your leg, you immediately lost control of your muscles. Your legs buckled underneath you, falling limp and useless.<br />
<br />
All the while the wolf continued to force himself deep inside of you, moaning in pleasure as he filled you full. As if sensing your climax coming, the wolf took hold of both your wrists, pinning them above your head. Then with one last thrust, he buried himself completely inside of you.<br />
<br />
For a brief second, you thought you would pass out. You could feel the heat rushing through your body now, filling every part of your being with fire and desire. The very same flames which consumed the beast, and made him want to devour you whole.<br />
But even still, you weren&#39;t quite ready yet. Not just for this monster, but also not for yourself. For all these years, you&#39;d been hiding behind your walls, afraid to show anyone what lay beneath. Now here was a chance, finally. A moment where you could be who you really wanted to be.<br />
<br />
And you knew exactly whom you wished to become.<br />
&quot;Nngh~&quot; You whimpered, gripping onto the grass below you. &quot;Haah... Hyaaaah...&quot;<br />
<br />
With each passing moment, you grew weaker and weaker. Until eventually you collapsed on top of the wolf&#39;s stomach, gasping for air. He grunted lowly beside you, gently stroking your cheek and running his fingers along your jawline.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good girl.&quot; The wolf purred, leaning in closer. &quot;That&#39;s right. Let your true self shine forth.&quot;<br />
Before you knew it, his tongue slithered past your lips and wrapped around yours. At first it was rough, tasting of blood and death. But as time passed, it slowly changed. Turning sweet, and tender. Almost as though the wolf was tainting your soul. <br />
<br />
You sighed deeply, opening your mouth slightly and allowing the wolf access. His tongue moved in sync with yours, exploring every crevice and corner. Even as he drank from your soul, you found yourself wanting to return the favor. So instead of fighting him, you opened your heart wide and accepted everything he gave you.<br />
<br />
Your formerly human cock began to shrink away, twitching as the beast sucked greedily upon it. Only when he had drained the entirety of its contents did he pull back, licking his lips happily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very good.&quot; The wolf grinned, standing up straight again. &quot;I&#39;m glad I chose you as my mate. We shall make beautiful children together.&quot;<br />
His words caused you to shiver, and you looked over at him nervously. Still trembling, you reached out and touched his fur softly. It was soft and smooth like silk, almost silky to the touch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm...&quot; The wolf hummed, closing his eyes and tilting his head back. &quot;So pretty. Such lovely hair. Like the night sky.&quot;<br />
Suddenly you were lifted into the air, and thrown onto the bed of leaves. You landed atop the wolf, and he quickly grabbed hold of your waist, pulling you flush against him. He lapped at your budding sex forcing you to moan loudly, arching your back and pressing yourself harder against the creature as you tried to pull away, and retreat with your growing tail between your legs as it pushed and grew between your legs like a growing sprout.. pushing and pushing.. while he pulled on your body, caressing your body like smooth clay and putty. <br />
The wolf chuckled darkly, kissing you roughly as he slid his hand between your thighs. His fingers rubbed against your wet folds, spreading your juices and making them slick. All the while his other paw pressed firmly on your chest, holding you in place as he stared down at you hungrily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yesss.&quot; He breathed. &quot;Take me, little one. Take all that is mine.&quot;<br />
<br />
He slipped two of his fingers inside of you, stretching your inner walls apart and causing you to gasp sharply. But despite how much it hurt, you couldn&#39;t help but push forward, trying desperately to meet his ministrations. To kiss him, to lick him, to do anything else you could think of. Anything to please him.<br />
<br />
At once you felt another pair of paws join his own, and suddenly you were surrounded by the strong arms of the wolf. One paw rested on your hip, keeping you steady as he thrust deeper and faster than before. Another gripped your wrist tightly, holding your arm high above your head so you wouldn&#39;t try to escape. And then there was the third, rubbing your clit relentlessly, sending electric shocks racing through you as he drove you wilder and wilder until you cried out in pleasure.<br />
<br />
&quot;A-Ahh~!&quot; Your voice rose to an earsplitting pitch, and you bucked wildly against the wolf as waves of ecstasy washed over you. &quot;H-Hey! Mmhaa~&quot;<br />
<br />
The wolf laughed deep within his throat, moving his hips in time with his fingers as he fucked you hard. His claws dug into your flesh, drawing blood, but you didn&#39;t care about any of those things. Not when your entire world was filled only by the wolf&#39;s massive erection buried balls-deep inside of you, pumping thick ropes of hot seed. &quot;You see.. Within curses.. There are violence born werewolves.. Rumors are even blood and fluids can trigger the transformation, but drinking a werewolf&#39;s blood is taboo.. And then.. there are semen induced werewolves. They&#39;re rare.. But they exist..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nngh... Hahaahhh!!&quot; You gasped, panting heavily as the wolf kept pounding into you. &quot;Ooohhhhh!! Nnnngg~!&quot;<br />
As the wolf continued to fuck you senseless, you came twice more, screaming wordlessly as your mind went blank. Every muscle in your body tensed, and your spine arched off the bed of leaves as you climaxed yet again. And still the wolf pounded away, filling your womb with his warm seed. &quot;Wolves take what we want.. And why should you, a foolish adventurer with a curse mark, be anything better? Did you really believe just arrogantly walking into a pack of wolves, no plan in that head, with no abilities, knowledge or fighting ability would go well?&quot; He smiled. &quot;That&#39;s not how this works.&quot;<br />
<br />
You shivered as you felt the fur slowly creeping up your body, a black shadowy pelt while your cock receded further into your forming wet clefted pussy. The sensation sent a thrill rushing through you, and you moaned deeply, unable to move now that you&#39;d been pinned beneath the large animal.<br />
<br />
The wolf leaned down towards you, planting a firm kiss on your cheek. A low growl rumbled from his throat, and he whispered softly to you. &quot;I&#39;m going to claim you for my own.. I will make sure you never forget who owns you.. Beta.&quot;<br />
And then he began licking around your neck, his tongue leaving a trail of saliva along your skin. Soon after, you felt something cold and rough slide across your face. As you opened your mouth, expecting him to bite your lips, you instead found his long fangs sinking into your flesh, piercing your tender throat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uuunnngh?!&quot; You cried out, struggling weakly underneath the wolf as he sank his teeth into your throat. &quot;Lesser werewolves? They are cock sleeves for a true alpha feral dire wolf. It&#39;s part of our nature to dominate weaker creatures like yourself, and to mate with their females.&quot;<br />
<br />
His words echoed throughout your brain, and you whimpered helplessly under the powerful beast. You tried pushing back against him, but it did nothing to stop him as he sunk his fangs deeper into your neck. You screamed wordless pleas as he held you down, firm but soft on your throat. &quot;Lets see how arrogant you are, when you&#39;re filled with a dire wolf litter and forced to give birth to ferals.&quot; He purred darkly. &quot;If you survive that, maybe I&#39;ll let you live. Maybe if you beg enough, I might allow you to taste some of the milk.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your eyes widened at that thought, and you struggled harder against the wolf, trying to get free. But his grip remained iron tight, pinning you down easily. Even worse, you could feel the warmth of his cum dripping from your pussy onto your thighs, soaking through your clothes and making them stick to you.<br />
<br />
&quot;No! I&#39;m a man, a human man! Not a multi breasted she wolf bitch, let me down!&quot; you screamed out, tears running down your cheeks. &quot;Please! Let me go!&quot;<br />
<br />
The wolf chuckled, leaning down closer so you could hear his quiet whisper. &quot;Do you think I care? Do you really expect anyone to save you here? No one knows where you are. We have plenty of prey nearby. If I wanted to kill you right now, you wouldn&#39;t stand a chance.&quot;<br />
Your eyes darkened. &quot;But that&#39;s the funny thing.. People want a savage wolf.. they want to be preyed upon, and yet they turn tail or they find themselves excited.. Isn&#39;t that funny? Our bodies aren&#39;t made to say no to these... Some people fantasize about being captured, against their will. Our bodies are just piles of natural instinctual urges, desires, wants, needs, lusts and cravings.&quot;<br />
<br />
He snorted, his muzzle nuzzling against your ear. &quot;Just like a appendix, there are useless things left behind in the human brain as species evolved.. Dead ends.. No use... No logical purpose.. Yet they remain.. You can&#39;t fight them, you can&#39;t resist them. You&#39;re only cursed to have them, and damn near no logical explanation for nature why. But there&#39;s one cursed instinct left in you..<br />
<br />
To be pinned down by a strong, virile, wild four legged alpha wolf... And for me.. to breed that transforming pussy... Some species were designed for protections from breeding, such as closing wombs or psuedopenises to deny seed unless willing.. Humans weren&#39;t.. There&#39;s nothing you can do to change things anymore. So accept it. Accept your fate and enjoy it. Because there&#39;s nothing else left for you to do.&quot;<br />
With those final words, the wolf stood up, lifting you up with him. His thick shaft was still hard inside you, and he gave you an amused smile before pulling his hips. You gasped loudly, feeling your insides stretching wider than ever before as he pulled out of you. With a few more pulls, he finally slid all the way out of you, letting out a deep breath as he did so. Your legs shook uncontrollably as he stepped away, and he licked his lips hungrily.<br />
<br />
&quot;See, aren&#39;t we such creatures of instinct? No matter how much your mind says this is wrong, no matter how much it wants to just go away. That body won&#39;t listen. It craves what it craved since the beginning of time..&quot; The wolf said, walking over to sit down on the edge of the bed again. He reached forward, grabbing hold of your ankles and holding them spread wide open. &quot;So don&#39;t pretend like you didn&#39;t come here fully willingly. You came abhorring it, while another side betrayed you and went looking for it. You know you did.&quot;<br />
You trembled beneath the wolf, your breathing coming out heavy and fast. &quot;It&#39;s not fair...&quot; You breathed out quietly. &quot;I never asked to become like this.. Why does my body betray me?&quot;<br />
<br />
The wolf laughed softly, sitting back up and taking hold of your wrists. He pushed you down until you were laying flat on the floor, staring up at him. &quot;That&#39;s the fun part isn&#39;t it? You always had something hidden inside you, waiting to be discovered. Something that would make you crave it, yearn for it, need it. Just like every other person who has been changed by a predator.&quot;<br />
<br />
He leaned down, kissing your forehead gently. &quot;Imagine if the human race had been born as beasts instead of men, women, and children. What kind of world would our ancestors live in today? Would we have survived? Or would we have died off when predators attacked us? Maybe that&#39;s the answer. Perhaps evolution has been fortunate, yet cruel. Despite all your cunning... despite all your intelligence... your body remains as primitive as any animal. A beast. An animal craving a mate, a pack, a leader..&quot;<br />
<br />
His tongue slipped between your lips, tasting you intimately. You shuddered under his touch, unable to move even though you desperately tried to break free. His hands gripped tightly around your wrist, forcing them above your head as he continued to kiss you. One hand moved to cup your cheek, stroking your skin slowly as the other slipped down, pushing aside your shirt. You moaned into his mouth, feeling his hot breath wash over your face.<br />
<br />
A growl rumbled through his throat, making you shudder. His fingers ran along your stomach, teasingly rubbing over your bare belly button before moving lower. They brushed against your wet slit, slipping between your folds and sliding across your swollen clit. You cried out, arching your back up towards him as he rubbed your sensitive flesh. You couldn&#39;t stop yourself, your thighs trembling as pleasure shot straight to the top of your spine.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahh..!&quot; You whimpered, gasping as he kept going. His long claw pressed against your tight entrance, pressing deeper and twisting slightly. You bucked your hips upwards, trying to push his digit further inside but failing. His paw wrapped around your waist, gripping onto you firmly as he began thrusting. His big cock throbbed within your grasp, and you squeezed tighter, desperate for relief.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mm...&quot; The wolf hummed, licking your neck as he kissed your shoulder.. &quot;Just let go. Let your instincts guide you. Feel it building in you, growing stronger and harder. Don&#39;t fight it. Just feel it..&quot;<br />
<br />
Your eyes fluttered closed as his claws dug into your skin. The wolf&#39;s thick member pulsated, twitching inside you as his paws worked their magic. You felt the pressure build in your loins, the warmth spreading throughout your entire core. As he teased you, grinding his tip against you.<br />
<br />
&quot;God! Make it stop! Stop it!!&quot; You screamed out, struggling weakly underneath him. &quot;Please!! Please!&quot;<br />
The wolf chuckled darkly, leaning down and nipping at your ear. &quot;Oh, I think someone likes this a little too much..&quot;<br />
<br />
You whined, biting your lip as he thrust once more. You could barely breathe, the pleasure burning through every inch of your body. Every nerve ending seemed to tingle, sending electric shocks shooting from your pelvis all the way up to your scalp. Your heart pounded loudly in your ears, threatening to burst right there.<br />
<br />
You writhed beneath him, moaning as you started to cry out. Tears rolled down your cheeks, stinging your eyes as they spilled freely. All you wanted was for the pain to end, for the pleasure to subside. But then you felt his tail wrap around your leg, pulling you closer to him. With one last shove, his thick shaft slammed home inside of you.<br />
<br />
You gasped sharply, crying out as he filled you completely. It hurt so good, stretching you wide open and filling you with heat. You clenched your jaw shut, holding your breath as you waited for it to pass. And after what felt like an eternity, he pulled his dick away. You looked down, watching as his cum dribbled out of your pussy and dripped onto the floor. You whimpered, reaching down and touching yourself gingerly.<br />
<br />
&quot;H-How did I get here..?&quot; You whispered, looking up at him. &quot;Why is it happening to me? Why am I changing?!&quot;<br />
The wolf smirked, rising up on his feet. &quot;Because you&#39;re a fucking bitch,&quot; He said simply, grabbing hold of you roughly and yanking you to your feet. &quot;And now you&#39;ve got no choice but to do whatever I say.&quot;<br />
<br />
He threw you onto the bed, pinning you down as he crawled atop you. You struggled weakly, but soon found yourself pinned helplessly underneath him again. His heavy weight forced you flat onto your back, leaving you panting heavily as he hovered over your prone form.<br />
&quot;What are you doing?&quot; You asked, shaking your head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Making myself comfortable, obviously,&quot; He replied lazily. His tail snaked its way around your waist, wrapping itself possessively around your hip. &quot;I don&#39;t want my new mate getting cold while we make our next cub together.&quot;<br />
<br />
You blushed, glancing up at him nervously. He grinned, crawling forward until he was hovering over your exposed sex. His tongue licked at his muzzle, savoring the taste of your sweet juices. &quot;You&#39;re just a sex toy to me, a former male, turned female. A plaything that can satisfy any need I might have. So if you&#39;d rather not be used by your master, perhaps you should go to the nuns and ask them to turn you into a proper bitch.&quot; he teased, a predatory, wolvish grin on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;ll take care of everything. Give you the clothes you deserve. Fix you up nice and pretty. Maybe even give you some friends to hang out with when you come visit.&quot; The wolf smiled wickedly, leaning down and kissing you softly. &quot;Oh, but that life would be boring you say? No fun or excitement?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;N... No... *huff huff* Y-Yes,... &quot; You moaned, writhing beneath him.<br />
<br />
His lips curled into a smile, lowering himself slowly between your thighs. You cried out, arching your back and pushing your chest towards him. &quot;Don&#39;t tease me like this..&quot; You begged. &quot;Please... fuck me already!&quot;<br />
<br />
He growled low in his throat, pressing the tip of his large cock against your folds. &quot;As you wish, pet,&quot; He purred, sliding inside without hesitation. You bucked under him, gasping as he stretched you wide open.<br />
&quot;Ah...&quot; You groaned, clutching tightly to the sheets beneath you.<br />
<br />
The wolf moved slowly, teasing you mercilessly. He took his time, making sure to stretch you fully before moving deeper. Each push pushed your insides further apart, stretching you wider than you ever thought possible. You bit your lower lip, shuddering as he sank deep within you. You gripped hard, squeezing your eyes shut tight.<br />
<br />
Slowly, carefully, he slid his length in and out of you. You let out small cries each time he plunged into you, feeling your inner walls clinging to his thick shaft. His hips rocked gently, driving his girthy member deep inside of you.<br />
<br />
Your breathing quickened as he worked harder, faster. The pressure built quickly as your climax drew nearer and nearer. Soon enough it hit you full force, rocking you to the core as waves of ecstasy crashed over you. Your legs trembled, your hands gripping desperately at the blankets beneath you.<br />
&quot;Yesssss~! MmMmm!!&quot; You screamed loudly, clawing at the sheets. &quot;Fuuuckkkk!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
The wolf&#39;s thrust became erratic, slamming his throbbing erection into you. His knot grew larger and thicker, straining against your body. You could feel it growing, swelling as he filled you. It was going to burst forth from you soon. You knew it. But instead of pulling away, he slammed into you one last time, bottoming out and burying his cock deeply inside.<br />
&quot;Aahhhhhhh!&quot; You shrieked, throwing your head back and screaming out loud.<br />
<br />
It happened so fast. One moment you were there, enjoying every inch of the wolf&#39;s dick plunging into your depths. Then suddenly all that remained was a gaping hole where his dick once sat.<br />
You lay sprawled across the bed, panting ragged breaths as your mind began to clear...<br />
<br />
He smiled.. &quot;Don&#39;t worry.. There&#39;s 7 more of us.. And they all want to fuck you.. The only thing you can do with your new pussy and body is decide whether or not you can control your hormones enough to become a masculine pussied cuntboy or a she wolf. Either way, you will submit to me. Do you understand?&quot;<br />
You nodded shakily. &quot;Y-Yes.. Master...&quot;<br />
The wolf smirked, climbing off of you. &quot;Good girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
You felt empty now, drained completely. You couldn&#39;t move, barely even think. All you wanted to do was sleep. As you drifted into slumber, you wondered how long it would take for your body to heal itself...<br />
<br />
The 7 wolves came, cocks throbbing and their eyes filled with hunger, lust and desire. They watched as you slept, licking hungrily at your cum soaked slit. Their tongues tasted your essence, cleaning you clean.<br />
<br />
One by one they entered you, filling you with their seed. Some were gentle, others rough and brutal. They fucked you relentlessly, using your holes as breeding grounds and taking turns fucking you raw. Every stroke brought you closer and closer to orgasm, until finally you exploded around them, crying out as your pussy clenched tight around their swollen dicks.<br />
<br />
Somehow, despite being stuffed full of cocks again and again, you still tried to avoid getting pregnant. 9 times in total. By the end, your womb was bulging with puppies.<br />
<br />
After the first round, you had managed to get yourself together enough to stand on shaky legs. You looked down at your naked form, covered in sweat and semen. You&#39;d been fucked thoroughly and repeatedly. Your ass ached terribly, yet somehow you didn&#39;t regret any of it. In fact, you loved it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well done, pet.&quot; The feral dire wolf said with a smile. &quot;Learn your proper place, werewolves kneel before dire wolf cock as long as i breathe and fight. This is what you are meant to be doing here.... This is exactly where you&#39;re meant to belong. Now lick, slut&quot;<br />
His words sent shivers through you, but you did as he commanded, lapping at his leaking cock like a dog. You moaned softly when you realized just how much you enjoyed this role. Your body craved submission, craving nothing else other than to serve these powerful creatures.<br />
<br />
They continued to use you throughout the night, forcing themselves onto you whenever they pleased. They treated you no differently then anyone else. When they tired of your tight little asshole, some switched places while others simply left you tied up and waiting for someone else to come along and fuck you senseless.<br />
By morning, you found yourself sore, exhausted and utterly satisfied.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope you liked our show,&quot; the male dire wolf chuckled as he walked past you. He stopped, turning back to look at you. &quot;We&#39;ll have plenty of opportunities to play tonight. Don&#39;t forget who owns you, my bitch.&quot; With those parting words, he turned and disappeared into the darkness.<br />
<br />
You stared after him, feeling a strange mixture of fear and excitement well within you. What would happen next? Would they keep you here forever? Or maybe they&#39;d let you go home. After everything you had seen and experienced, you weren&#39;t sure if you really belonged anywhere anymore.</p>
