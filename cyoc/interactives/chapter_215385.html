<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I woke up to the sound of bird chirping outside feeling warm and horny. Almost without thinking, I moved my hand down to my penis only to notice that it was smaller and more sensitive than I was expecting. Suddenly the memory of what happened last night came back to me as I looked around to see that mom was nowhere to be seen. My thoughts turned to what she told me about me becoming a demon, and her own transformation into a succubus. I finally decided to pull off the blankets revealing my naked body, as I had felt earlier my penis had shrunk significantly taking on a pinkish color. &quot;Make up your mind,&quot; I said noticing that my voice sounded softer and higher than it used to be. Looking at the rest of my body, I didn&#39;t see any hints of my demonic nature, at least not yet anyway. My skin felt softer, my body seemed smaller, and my chest ached the skin feeling puffy and a little warmer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom&#39;s a succubus, so does that mean that I&#39;m..?&quot; I cut myself off that line of thought, not feeling comfortable with the inevitable conclusion. my attention turned back to my reduced but still hard shaft, as I touched it intense pleasure radiated into my body. I felt a familiar urge well up inside me, I decided not to resist what I now knew were my demonic impulses. I let out a moan, surprising myself with just how feminine I sounded. Fluid began to cover my genitals, lubricating my small sensitive dick. My mind started to drift back to last night and the sex I had with mom. I remember her soft round tits, her warm moist pussy, and her wings wrapped around me. After a few minutes I finally felt my cum welling up inside my loins as I begin to spill over. But as I experienced an orgasm something felt strange, the pleasure began to spread into the rest of my body. Clear fluid squirted from my small cock, my body convulsed, and I felt myself begin to change again.<br />
<br />
My dick shrank even more getting to the point that it could barely even be considered a penis anymore. My balls preformed their own disappearing act pulling themselves up into my body leaving behind some loose sensitive skin behind. My body continued to sift and change making me look more feminine than I already did, thankfully none of this was painful. My chest swelled up making it even more obvious that I was growing tits, a clear fluid began to drip from my nipples as they too began to swell. More soft brown hairs began to grow on my hips giving me a strange skirt of sort fur. At the tail end of the changes I began to feel my ears sift likely becoming pointed like moms, and finally a pulling above my ass alerted me to a small bump growing at the base of my spine. As I recovered from my orgasm I found it difficult to enjoy the sensations as it became impossible to deny the truth, I&#39;m a succubus. <br />
<br />
After a few moments, I finally pulled myself out of bed and made my way to the bathroom. Only stopping to put on a shirt that ended up being just a little to big. Thankfully I could still pee from what was left of my penis, the realization that I&#39;ll probably have to sit like a girl from now on mad me somewhat uncomfortable. As I washed up I couldn&#39;t help but notice my face in the mirror. What looked back at me was the face of a young girl with sort brown hair, and reddish orange cat like eyes similar to mom&#39;s. I didn&#39;t know how to feel about all this, was my human life really over, what&#39;s my new life going to be like. Feeling uneasy, I finished cleaning up, and began to look for mom. <br />
<br />
I smelled the familiar sent of bacon and eggs as I entered the main living area, only to see my mom completely naked and cooking in her succubus form. She noticed me almost immediately, she looked surprised at first before her expression shifted to a sad smile. &quot;How are you feeling Jayden,&quot; she asked before looking down at herself &quot;sorry if my appearance is a bit... indecent.&quot; &quot;I felt that it was better for you get used to my true form,&quot; she explained &quot;though maybe I should have at least put on some clothes.&quot; Suddenly the weight of everything that&#39;s been happening grew too much as I began to brake down &quot;mom I don&#39;t want this.&quot; &quot;I want to go home, I want everything to just go back to normal, I don&#39;t want to be a succubus.&quot; Almost immediately I felt mom&#39;s hand on my shoulder &quot;my mother tried to warn me about raising you as a human,&quot; She said &quot;I should have listened, I&#39;m sorry Jayden.&quot; <br />
<br />
She was about to pull way when I wrapped my arms around her, feeling her naked body made things a bit strange, but at that moment I needed her more than ever. She quickly returned my hug wrapping both her arms and wings around me &quot;you know it&#39;s actually rare for us to be born male, I can&#39;t even begin to imagine how confusing this is for you.&quot; &quot;I don&#39;t suppose there&#39;s such a thing as an incubus is there?&quot; I asked. Mom hesitated for a moment before answering &quot;not naturally no, there were rituals that where used to create incubi.&quot; &quot;But, everyone that had attempted it ended up as mindless monsters,&quot; she explained. &quot;The only known incubus to retain their sanity was Asmodeus, and even then he became a three headed monstrosity.&quot; &quot;So not something I Should to mess with,&quot; I said feeling a little disappointed. <br />
<br />
&quot;If it helps,&quot; She said spreading her wing open &quot;there are other ways to modify our bodies, these wings for example, where not a natural part of my body.&quot; &quot;Succubus alchemy can allow us to change small parts of your body from the size of your tits to even growing a dick,&quot; she explained. &quot;Where do I even find something like that?&quot; I asked &quot;I didn&#39;t even know succubus even existed before last night.&quot; Mom pulled away, giving me a warm smile before saying &quot;that is part of why we&#39;re hear, you see beneath are very feet is a city.&quot; I was a bit taken aback by that statement before looking down, as if I was going to see anything but hard wood floor. &quot;When can I see it?&quot; I asked feeling a little excited for once. She placed a hand on my cheek before replying &quot;soon, but you won&#39;t be able to enter without the ability to use succubus magic.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m going to be able to use magic?&quot; I asked feeling overwhelmed with everything I&#39;ve learned. &quot;Yes, but we&#39;re going to have to wait for your horns to grow in,&quot; she explained pointing up at her own large black antler like horns. I looked at her feeling a little confused before asking &quot;what do horns have to do with magic?&quot; &quot;Think of them as receivers, through our horns we are able to draw in the ambient life energy around us,&quot; She explained. &quot;But I&#39;ll leave the more in depth explanation for when the time comes,&quot; mom said as she bent down to give me a kiss. I resisted briefly before a familiar heat began to well up inside me again, and I quickly found myself eagerly returning her kiss. As mom broke away, I surprised myself by trying to recapture her lips only to be left panting and horny. She laughed before kneeling down in front me &quot;for now let&#39;s have some fun.&quot; She said before slipping her hands up my shirt. <br />
<br />
I halfheartedly try to cover my crotch, sill not quite comfortable with this. mom looked up at me, a look of concern was on her face &quot;it&#39;s okay Jayden, we&#39;re succubi there&#39;s nothing wrong with this,&quot; she said. &quot;We are buy nature extremely social creatures, we need to be touched, to have the type of bond that is only forged through sex.&quot; She moved her hands further up into my shirt pressing her hands against my back pulling me closer to her. &quot;Jayden, I want you to be okay, It can really screw with your head if we don&#39;t satisfy ourselves,&quot; she said getting choked up &quot;I don&#39;t want you to go through what I did after your father died.&quot; Finally starting to understand why she&#39;s doing this, I kneeled down and gave her a hug before removing my shirt and laying on the floor. I hesitated for a moment, still feeling a bit nervous before spreading my legs, showing her my changing genitals. Despite how horny I felt my small dicklit refused to get hard only swelling and dipping precum over the remains of my balls. <br />
<br />
Mom laid down moving her arms beneath my legs and placing her hands on my back, her face nestled between my legs, her breath stimulating my sensitive flesh. Suddenly I let out a squeal unprepared for the intensity of the sensation, as her tongue began to trace up my tiny saft. It felt completely different from before, with every stroke of her tongue I felt my whole body grow hotter and it felt like I was being wound tighter and tighter. A familiar feeling began to flow into me, looking down I saw a ring of red light circling mom&#39;s head her eyes also appear to be glowing. (Is this magic?) I thought before suddenly feeling my genitals begin to change, as the loose skin that used to be my ball sack pulled in. My dicklit continued to shrink, shifting and changing, before finally separating from my urethra and becoming a clit. Mom continued to taste my moist flesh as it continued to slip deeper into my body, soft skin swelling up, framing my new genitalia. <br />
<br />
Suddenly I felt my mother&#39;s tongue slip inside me, pleasuring the wet tunnel of my new pussy. I placed my hands on her head, in a desperate attempt to push her deeper into me. I screamed and moaned as I felt myself getting ever tighter and hotter, it kept building and building driving me closer to the inevitable. I feel myself snap as I experienced my first female orgasm, my back arched as waves of pleasure shot through my body. Suddenly I felt a strange tingling sensation on my head as my hair grew longer. Two of my teeth grew into fangs, and hair grew on my back lightly covering my shoulders and going down my back tapering off in the middle. My tail began to lengthen, growing darker in color, it was still small but now had a strange bulb on the tip. My feet began to stretch out, leaving behind the big tow as it shifts into something similar to a thumb. The other tows grew longer, stronger, and tipped with sharp claws, as the skin became darker and tougher. My tits swelled up once again, still a lot smaller than moms but looking to be a fairly good size. <br />
<br />
I laid there recovering from my orgasm, when I noticed that the tingling around my head wasn&#39;t going away. &quot;Mom my head feels weird,&quot; I said before sitting up and feeling my head. My head suddenly became overwhelmed by what felt like static as I touched something hard growing just above my ears. &quot;Let me see&quot; mom said before sitting down behind me and sifting her hands through my hair. &quot;Looks like your horns are growing in,&quot; She said before wrapping her arms around me &quot;you feel that energy swirling around your head?&quot; &quot;How do I get it to stop?&quot; I asked feeling a headache coming on. <br />
<br />
She placed her hands on my head before saying &quot;concentrate on the energy feel how it flows, then try to move it.&quot; I did as she said closing my eyes and focusing on the energy, it felt chaotic flowing in every direction almost like tv static. I tried to stop some of it feeling it condense into a ball in front of me, I started to notice a reddish orange light in the same place. As I opened my eyes I saw a ball of light, quickly losing my concentration at the site the ball suddenly began to disperse. &quot;Very good!&quot; mom exclaimed &quot;now simply try to push the mana away from your head.&quot; I did as she said, pushing it away from my head, and thankfully the tingling around my horns subsides giving me some relief. &quot;Do I have to keep doing this all the time?&quot; I asked feeling a bit worried. &quot;No,&quot; mom said tightening her hug &quot;your horns are just going to be sensitive as they grow in, the tingling will stop after they&#39;ve finished growing.&quot; <br />
<br />
As we sat there together, My mind began to drift, until finally I decided to ask &quot;did dad know?&quot; Mom laid her head on top of mine before answering sadly &quot;no, I never got the chance.&quot; &quot;I wish I had more time with him,&quot; I said. &quot;Me to,&quot; She said &quot;they say it&#39;s dangerous for succubus to fall in love with normal humans.&quot; &quot;Despite everything, I would do it all again, after all he gave me you,&quot; she said &quot;I love you Jayden.&quot; &quot;I love you too mom,&quot; I replied enjoying her embrace, but the moment was quickly interrupted by the smell of smoke &quot;is something burning?&quot; &quot;OH SHIT!&quot;</p>
