<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jim got up and looked once again at his reflection, when it dawned on him. &quot;The catalog! The first outfit was the one in the catalog! Somehow it's causing this! I need to get rid of it!&quot; exclaimed Jim, and began to undress. He zipped down each boot and stepped out of them, and took off the skirt and the top, discarding everything in the bathroom floor.<br />
<br />
Determined and only wearing the fishnets and the lingerie, he walked into his room, the bracelets on his wrists tinkling at every movement, and picked up the catalog, tearing it in half without hesitation, and just to be sure, doing it once again. Watching the pieces of paper falling at his feet, he waited for something to happen several seconds. &quot;Maybe it's not going to change back the clothes, but I may take everything off now&quot; reasoned Jim, not giving any hope. Reaching down, Jim pulled off each of the fishnets and left them on the floor, at the same time the bracelets disappeared from his wrists. Hopeful, he took off the bra and the panties off and found himself naked in front of the full-length mirror inside his closet. Nervous, even the wait of several seconds was painful, or perhaps were his feet that were screaming for attention? That moment, Jim's train of thought was interrupted when he noticed his face in the mirror, that was free of makeup. Or was it? His eyelashes still looked like before, but so did his nails, that didn't have any polish but were the same inch or so length. Just as he lifted one of his fingers at his face to inspect it better, he watched in dread how the nail filled instantly with red while the now familiar feeling washed over him. <br />
<br />
Actually resigned for the first time, he watched how his face was heavily made up again with red and purple. Several earrings appeared on each of his ears with a matching choker that fit tightly over his neck. A purple satin camisole with a bow in the front and some lace on the cups covered his chest and part of the matching thong he was wearing under it. Slowly at first but now much quickly, his attention shifted from his new attire to his feet. At first it was only a discomfort, and with the expectation of his plan to work and the thought of being caused for wearing the heels, he wasn't totally aware of it, but now it was beginning to worry him. He kneeled and began to massage on of his foot, that felt like he was having cramps, but nothing he did make it better, and in fact they were getting worse, like his soles were also burning, and almost like they were arching because of the cramps. With a grunt, he sat on the floor, not able to put any weight over them. The pain was stronger by the seconds and Jim didn't understand why. &quot;My feet were fine just a minute ago! I didn't feel anything when I was walking...&quot; he thought, and, once again, realization came to him. &quot;I have... to wear heels?&quot; Jim groaned. The pain had begun to be unbearable, and Jim started to fumble in the closet for any pair of shoes. He grabbed the first two, hoping for having picked two right shoes of something like that and clumsily, he tried to put them on his feet. After some seconds of agony, the pain quickly faded away, leaving Jim panting in the floor lying on his back. Recovering, he sat up and looked at his feet. His right one had a pink open toed sandal and the left one a red pump, having a even higher heel.<br />
<br />
He didn't have a choice about the clothes, the jewelry nor even the makeup, but this was like... whoever did this to him was mocking him. &quot;You can choose not to wear them, but you'll be in extreme pain, is that it?&quot; he shouted. Kneeling down, he looked at the extensive collection of heels that was inside the closet. Compared with the sandal he was wearing, none of them were a significant improvement, as all of them had roughly the same heel height, with the exception of those who were even more extreme! He carefully got up, supporting himself with the closet and kicked off the heels. Now that he knew what he was looking for, Jim felt how it the sensation began to build up in his feet. Knowing that he had some time before it started, he walked out of his room to the one in front of it and entered his sister's. Figuring out what could be a loophole, he opened the closet and after some rummaging around, he found what he was looking for, a pair of sandals with a low and wide heel. They were pink and looked girly, but at that moment Jim just didn't care, he just wanted to try if they would work. &quot;They are women shoes and they have heels&quot; reasoned Jim, &quot;Please don't change&quot;. They were a bit tight, but the moment he put them on, the feeling disappeared. After adjusting the ankle straps, Jim tried taking a couple of steps, finding much easier to move than with the other shoes but, unfortunately, that didn't last too long for Jim. Just as he was going back to his bedroom, he felt himself getting taller, as the heels extended quickly under his feet. The sudden growth made him lose his balance and fall on his face, where he laid for a moment. <br />
<br />
Anger began to build inside of Jim again. If he couldn't have this on his terms, forced to dress like some slutty model, he would have to make new ones. He went in front of the mirror, and he began to fumble with the straps in the shoes, but they were difficult to undo because of the nails. &quot;It doesn't matter&quot; he said to himself, and moved on, leaving them in his feet. He pulled from the camisole he was wearing, and took it off, doing the same with the panties, and just remained there, until a new set of clothes appeared. This time, a black lace bra with matching panties appeared, along some black velvet gloves that went over his elbow and to the middle of his upper arm. Some pearl necklaces appeared along some pearl earrings in their usual spots and his lips were bright red while his eyes were surrounded by a great amount of eyeliner, completing the looks. Not wasting any second, Jim began to undress, taking both the bra and panties off and wait there.<br />
<br />
Once and again, Jim would undress, just to have those mere seconds in which he was almost himself. However, each time he did this, Jim found the clothes appearing were more complex, having to spend more time to take them off. At first, he had to undo the laces of some gloves. Later, along the usual garments appeared a garter belt that made him take the heels off, wasting time trying to get them off. Only a couple of outfits after that, a bodice appeared on him, and he had to figure everything out before being able to take it off. It was like the more effort he was putting on it... more effort put the clothes to prevent him from doing so, to make him stop defying them. This went on and on until the last time. <br />
<br />
Jim took off the last pair of panties and bra, leaving them on the floor along dozens and dozens of other bras and panties, all scattered on the floor, and reached down to roll the stockings that appeared on him when he found himself unable to bend down. With a quick movement, he felt his back straighten. A sudden compression along his torso, more pronounced on his waist, made him let out his breath. He had felt the same when the bodice appeared on him, but this was much stronger. When he looked his reflection, he had an idea of what he could expect, but it didn't prevent him to open his eyes in surprise even then. A black leather corset had appeared on him, cinching his waist down a couple of inches. It covered his torso from just below his armpits to a bit past his hips, giving him quite a figure and it had a bit of frills on the bottom, with some garters attached to the stockings-turned-fishnets on his legs. Under it, he could see the hint of a black thong. His hands were also covered with a pair of lace gloves, and his nails were painted black. Circling his neck was a choker that covered most part of it, with several pendants dangling from it, spread over his chest. The matching earrings, together with the black makeup on his face, finished the outfit that heavily pointed to a obvious goth motif. <br />
<br />
Jim reached to his back, his movements somewhat hindered by the tight corset, making difficult getting to the laces in the back. To his dismay, there were not only one, but several knots along the back of the corset, all of them very strong. After fifteen minutes fumbling with them, not being able to get a good look on them with the mirror coupled with the length of his nails, proved that trying to untie them on his own was an impossible task. Depressed and tired, Jim sat on the edge of the bed, even the bit of anger he was feeling subsiding under the weight of the realization about his predicament. &quot;Nothing I tried worked, and nothing ever will... They have won&quot; he muttered, resting his head on his hands. With tears, he began to think on how was he going to explain everything to his parents once they returned tomorrow and how messed up his life had turned in just hours. With that, he switched off the lights and lied down on his bed, covering himself with one of the sheets, falling asleep in tears.</p>
