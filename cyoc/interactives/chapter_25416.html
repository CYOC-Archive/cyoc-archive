<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was her last day of camping. Michelle slept through the night, feeling vaguely nausiated but otherwise fine, and packed up to go home the next day. She put everything into her truck and drove back towards civilization. <br />
<br />
She lived in Texas, but was camping in Montana. She loved the mountains, the green, wild feilds, the beauty of it all. She left with a mechonoly feeling. She didn't like leaving the beauty of the north. Hot, humaid home never seemed so attractive after a few days here.<br />
<br />
Nontheless, she went. <br />
<br />
By the time she got to the airport, she was having boughts of coughing and felt even more vaguely ill, without knowing how. Everyone she saw in the airport looked at her suspicously. None of them wanted to get sick on thier trip, or once they had gotten back from thier trip. The virus infecting Michelle was highly contageous. Everyone on the plane would be taking it home, and the flight attendant and captians would be spreading the &quot;love&quot; around with them. <br />
<br />
Michelle made it home to her Abilene apartment and collapsed onto her bed. She felt extreamly odd now. Sick. Not badly, but sick. She had chicken soup and tylenol, orange juice and vitimine C tablets, and didn't have to go in to work immediately. She could just lay on the bed and...<br />
<br />
A sudden cramp wracked her body, followed by another, and another. Nearly convulsive fits gripped her entire body, and she rolled off the bed, gasping in sudden, exquisite agony. She found herself coughing even more now, and looked down at the floor, sure she was going to either vomit or die.<br />
<br />
Instead she stared as her skin darkened. Clumps of her red, curly hair fell out and curled delicately around her fingers, which were...were thickening as she watched. Her fingers melted together into two thick, leathery digits, while her thumb expanded and the tips of her fingers hardened into horn-like nails. Her skin suddenly sprouted black, silky looking hair that rose out of her skin like a thick forest.<br />
<br />
She brushed at it with one of her hands, then both, but it was as real as the thick, horny fingers. Then her mouth seemed to itch like a whole nest of ants were crawling around inside. She heard a sound like a double POP! inside her head. She writhed her tongue around her jaw and realized with a shock that all her teeth had come loose. Four of them fell out at the touch of her tongue and she spat them all out on the floor. She looked from the pathetic looking white shapes to the mirror nearby, then screamed.<br />
<br />
Her eyes had been blue. Now they were larger and brown. Her nose was changing as she watched, melting into something strange. The bridge seemed to be widening, pushing her eyes apart. Her jaw and skull were also leingthening, and she felt thicker, bigger teeth pushing in as her jaw jutted out into a muzzle. Her thick, nearly non existant nose turned black and took up the front of her snout. THe once petite and attractive nose grew two large, wide nostrils, and her breath huffed out of them in hot, nearly steaming gusts. <br />
<br />
Her eyes continued to change, from brown to red and bloodshot, and her teeth were almost fang like between thick, leathery lips. Black, glossy fur spread over her face, as her ears begame large, soft and mobile beneith the mane of black fur growing down her neck. Two white horns grew just above them, jutting out at a manageable leingth. Her head had been replaced by something frighteningly bovine.<br />
<br />
The rest of her body shifted as well. Her neck thickened and became corded with muscle, as did her shoulders and chest. The polite blouse she had been wearing tore into small pieces and fell, discarded and useless, to the floor, every button popped and seam ripped. Her breasts receeded into her body, while her pectoral muscles grew obscenely large, with veigns visible through the thick fur spreading across her chest. Her arms seemed to triple in thickness, her hands growing larger and her fingers even thicker. Her slacks and undergarments shreaded as her hips and legs grew. Her pelvis and leg bones shifted dramatically, causing her to pitch froward off of her knees. Her shoes split, exploding into small bits of rubber and leather as her feet grew into massive cloven hooves. Even the floor beneith her groaned, as a long ropy tail grew from the end of her spine, tipped with a thick brush of longer mane fur. <br />
<br />
Her voice had deapened, and her breath echoed in her chest. Now, as she looked down, she stared. Something else grew up her belly, forming an obsene object rather like a snake. <br />
<br />
And then it was over, the cramping fading away. She looked into the mirror and stared.<br />
<br />
A bovine creature, hulking with muscle and fearce lines, stared back at her. Fearce red eyes glowered under a huge brow, large ears twitched at every noise. With her mouth open in shock and gestating horror, she could see the large teeth, nothing like what an herbivore should have in its mouth. Her tail twitched, curling around her knees. She pulled herself to a standing posision and found it was painful to stand upright, that the most comfortable way to stand was a deep crouch that was quite fearce. She moaned and a deep baratone voice rattled the windows. The voice, the build and a few...other...things made it quite clear that however Michelle might feel about it, she wasn't a &quot;she&quot; anymore.<br />
<br />
What looked back at her through the mirror wasn't a skinny texas girl, but the classical, emphatically male grecian Minotaur.</p>
