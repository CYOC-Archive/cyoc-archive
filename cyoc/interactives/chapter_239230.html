<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Damon felt pressure as fell off-balance, propping themselves on a nearby tree as his boots began to tear, exposing his feet, which was grotesquely deforming as his middle digits were fusing and growing longer, the nails turning dark and expanding as his other toes were shrinking and withdrawing into his lengthening foot and ankle, which was sprouting a coarse selection of black hairs up and down it.<br />
<br />
The hooded figure began to cackle, revealing themselves to be a young woman, roughly in her late 20&#39;s with unnaturally light blue hair and violet eyes, though her odd hair color wouldn&#39;t be out of place in a spellcaster like her, as mana had a way of imbuing people with odd hair and eye colors. As her cloak and hood shifted in her cajoling, it was revealed she was rather buxom as well, dressed in a bodice and a skirt and knee high leather boots, with a belt holding a collapsible scepter and potions and a binder with a spellbook on her hip.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why are you doing this?&quot; Damon grunted, his legs mostly equine at this point.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your family has a lot of enemies, and reagents aren&#39;t cheap you know!!&quot; she said in between chuckles. &quot;I&#39;m just amazed how easy this was!!&quot; She stumbled forward in her laughter however, and when she did, tripped on a rake some peasant haphazardly left by the stream, smacking herself in the face, stunning herself. In her daze, she then tripped on a branch, just in time to get gut-checked by a kick from Sebastian, causing her to fall to her knees right behind Damon just as his pants gave up the ghost against his changing legs, gripping Damon&#39;s furry thighs, barely holding herself up against the backside of the 10 year old prince. Thanks to the blow to her gut, she vomits all over Damon&#39;s backside and legs, but instead of chunks, it was a rainbow mélange of mana.<br />
<br />
Moments later, the mage became heavily alarmed, trying to pull away, but finding her hands stuck to Damon. &quot;Oh no!! Not good!! Forgot with this particular spell that anything that comes in contact with the target merges with it while they are transmutating because they&#39;re in a state of high plasticity, and the mana I just released on him is going to send the process into overdrive and possibly even make things unstable!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can&#39;t you undo it then?&quot; Damon asked, still holding himself up against the tree to help balance himself on his new hooves.<br />
<br />
&quot;Undo it?&quot; the mage says sounding for the first time utterly clueless. &quot;Well, see... I only learned the &#39;changing people&#39; part...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Seriously?&quot; Damon chides her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, I only learn spells I like and I think are neat, okay!! This one looked like a fun way of eliminating targets without always causing collateral damage!!&quot; she whined, fur starting to travel up her arms as her hands sank into his flanks. &quot;Do you know how pissy get about their homes getting blown up!! I have to eat too!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m starting to understand why you went after me now.&quot; Damon sighed, noticing his voice getting higher, more... feminine. &quot;I don&#39;t think you could handle anything more dangerous than a ten year old.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, yeah I could!! I totally could!!&quot; the would-be bumbling magical assassin screeched, trying to ignore the fact her breasts were starting to move down her chest and her panties under her skirt ripped open, letting out a horse tail that was mostly light blue but was tipped in the auburn of young prince Damon&#39;s locks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then pull yourself free and prove it.&quot; the normally kind Damon said with a hint of snark, now thoroughly annoyed by the incompetent mage that had ruined his day, as the boy now looked more mature, but at the same time his waist starting to pinch in, his clothes feeling tight on his growing frame.<br />
<br />
The fumbling, bumbling assailant stuck to his backside was flailing for words as her body was building bulk, her scandalous outfit tearing off her as her ribcage expanded and her torso became more equine. With a cursory glance, she realized Damon wasn&#39;t becoming any more equine, but was becoming more feminine and older for some reason, possibly as a result of connection to her, at which point she realized her face&#39;s proximity to Damon&#39;s butt, and how her arms were all but gone now, which meant... &quot;No, no, no!! I don&#39;t wanna go there!!&quot; She squirmed futilely, but alas, her face met furry flank, and the flesh began to merge as tissue and muscle began to envelop her head. In the back, the mage&#39;s legs were changing to resemble Damon&#39;s legs, her feet distending into proper horse hooves as the last of her body was covered in black fur, with her large breasts now sitting between her legs as giant horse teats, and under the colorful tail was doughnut-like horse anus and mare vagina, while Damon&#39;s legs began to shift again, changing alignment from being rear legs to resembling more that of the forelegs of a horse.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, mage lady, are you still there?&quot; Damon asked, surprised again he, no... she sounded like a teenaged girl or young adult woman, sporting a spritely soprano voice. As her royal tunic finally gave in to the strain of Damon&#39;s changes, it tore away to reveal Damon sporting a young woman&#39;s, no, frame not unlike the mage that accosted him, with a very slim waist, very wide hips where past the hips her equine features began, flat toned abs, and very large buxom breasts. Furthermore, Damon looked into the stream and saw she had quite long hair reaching to her hips, most of which was light blue like the mage that attacked him, but the lower quarter of it, along with several streaks mixed in the blue, were her original auburn. Her features were an eclectic mix of the mage and Damon... well Damon if she taken far more after her mother. She even had her mom&#39;s piercing green eyes, whereas before she had her dad&#39;s brown eyes, and the mage had violet eyes. She still had the Sapphire Mark on her left shoulder, a birthmark all royalty in the Sapphirus Kingdom was born with and could not be forged by magic, and the design was specific to one&#39;s sex, but now instead of the mark Damon had before normally on all kings and princes, she had the one found on queens and princesses. This helped cement to Damon the fact Damon was a girl now.<br />
<br />
&quot;What am I going to do now, Sebastian?&quot; Damon asked to her stallion, which was looking at her confused.<br />
<br />
About this time, Damon realized four things:<br />
<br />
* She now somehow a few of the spotty and overly random spells the mage that attacked and fused to her knew now.<br />
<br />
* She knew the name of her attacker - Ristania - and that her consciousness was still inside of her as a backseat passenger, relegated to her loins.<br />
<br />
* There was a terrible itching heat in her loins for some reason and she didn&#39;t know how to get rid of it.<br />
<br />
* She was naked.<br />
<br />
Embarrassed, Damon fastened together a makeshift top from the remnants of Ristania&#39;s garments to cover her giant mammaries, mammaries that in the modern world would be rated as at least J-cups, however, Damon found she wasn&#39;t feeling any back pull or pain from them, as if her body had some small degree of superhuman strength.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now what to do?&quot; Damon frets.</p>
