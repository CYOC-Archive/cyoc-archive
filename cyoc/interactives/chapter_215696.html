<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Eugene felt hot tears in his eyes as he held his long-lashed lids shut, a wordless scream coming out of his mouth as he realized what had happened. He...or the part of him that was now Eve, had gotten angry and made another irrational wish! Everything was going to be messed up again! The former janitor felt his world spin as the changes washed over reality, re-writing it in accordance to how the Stone would interpret his wishes, and suddenly felt VERY light-headed. He staggered blindly forward and felt his tiny hand grab something warm and hard, quickly patting around the object before heaving himself down onto a slightly cushioned surface as the world rematerialized around him. An oppressive heat settled down around him and pulled his form forward, his breasts sagging forward and his back and feet suddenly radiating in pain. Eugene let out a feminine groan and dreaded what he&#39;d see as he peeked his glittering green eyes open and immediately recognized where he was.<br />
<br />
One of the Shermer High&#39;s baseball fields! The sandy diamond stretched out before him, the bases loaded with players from both Shermer and their rival, Highland Meadows. The grass was a vibrant green and the incessant sounds of cicadas threatened to drown out the booming loudspeaker and sounds of constant conversation from the crowd around him. And was it summer now? It certainly felt like it, with the humidity hanging heavy in the shaded bleachers. It seemed like there had been another disorienting time skip, Eugene&#39;s new, breezy, flowery attire already sticking to his swollen stomach and-<br />
<br />
Wait.<br />
<br />
Eugene&#39;s eyes grew huge as his eyes drifted downward to the foreign bulge that pressed out from his stomach and strained against a pair of jeans that were definitely larger than he had been wearing just moments ago. And then he felt something IN the bulge move.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god&quot; Eugene croaked. Was he...was Eve-<br />
<br />
&quot;Babe?&quot; A unfamiliar voice said from the seat on his right, and Eugene&#39;s head snapped towards the sound so fast that his long hair, now done up in a almost comically large ponytail, flashed around his bare shoulders and slapped him in his face. But who was this...punk sitting next to him?<br />
<br />
Black hair that looked like it had been dunked in grease. Pale skin, a face only a mother could love. Lanky, and slightly younger. A couple of pimples, dark brown eyes that looked confused as they struggled to stay locked on Eugene&#39;s face instead of his cleavage. Bad fashion sense like omg get a life loser.<br />
<br />
And then it slid into place with another painful eruption from the bulge. This was the kid Willow had been kissing!<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-you!?&quot; Eugene grunted again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, yeah? Who else would it be? Listen, I wanna go. You know I hate this sports shit and all these fake ass posers out here thinking they&#39;re better than me. I don&#39;t even know why you wanted to come! All you&#39;ve done is complain about the baby hurting and all your old friends making fun of you! State championship my ass, you just wanted to make me feel miserable&quot; The teen in front of him squawked, the stranger&#39;s voice caught between two different stages of puberty as his face twisted into a hateful scowl.<br />
<br />
&quot;B-baby!?&quot; Eugene gasped as he looked down at the bulge again, his fears confirmed as he place a tiny hand on it. Then another pain flashed through his body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why are you being so weird, Eve?&quot; The teen said again, the annoyance plain in his voice, &quot;God, you&#39;d think you&#39;d be nicer to the father of your child. You know, the thing you&#39;ve complained about for nine months and won&#39;t ever leave me alone about? Sometimes I really regret porking you at the park back in the fall! It&#39;s always &#39;Matt come be with me&#39; or &#39;Matt, Emily won&#39;t talk to me&#39; and &#39;Matt my parents kicked me out&#39; and &#39;Matt I&#39;d really appreciate it if you helped me get to the championship game!&quot; the teen, apparently named Matt, said in a horribly bad attempt to mimic Eve&#39;s voice. &quot;And all this &#39;the baby has to know her father Matt&#39; bullshit. The baby isn&#39;t even here so what the hell do you want me to do? Sing a bunch of stupid songs to your fat belly?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...I&#39;m...I...&quot; Was all Eugene could gasp as he twisted away from Matt&#39;s words that were only making him feel worse. He looked down at the small hands that were already perfectly familiar to him, expecting to see the magical gemstone in one of the dainty palms...But there was nothing but fair, slightly pale skin. Where...Where was the other girl? Where was Willow? Maybe she...But as Eugene swung his pretty head back and forth, scanning the bleachers for the accidental victim of his second wish to get out of the school play (which now felt like a lifetime ago) was nowhere to be seen. Instead there were just a ton of people that he didn&#39;t know, a lot of teachers that he did know from his previous life as a janitor, and a ton of high schoolers. Including the entire cheerleader squad on the other side of the bleachers with Joanna Ingerman squarely in the middle of the clique, her stylish but short summer wear putting her titanic breasts on display. The dark haired girl, Gloria, was seated next to her and looking quite pleased with herself and the ENTIRE squad, save for that Emily girl, was staring at him and giggling among themselves. Some had their phones out and pointed in her direction.<br />
<br />
Emily herself was only casting concerned glances in his direction every once in a while, her eyes otherwise locked on the ballfield and the baseball game. But then another flash of pain, significantly harder this time, pulsed through Eve&#39;s tiny body.<br />
<br />
&quot;OOOOOOWWW!&quot; Eugene could help but scream, drawing even more eyes to their somewhat isolated location.<br />
<br />
&quot;Man, fuck this!&quot; Matt said dismissively, reaching down and grabbing the cute little purse that had been sitting between Eugene&#39;s weird looking sandals. The teen&#39;s gangly hands unlocked the clasp and began digging around in the small, expensive looking container for a moment before he pulled out a mess of small keys. Then he stood and let the purse drop heavily to the floorboard.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m gonna go sit in the car. Text me when you&#39;re over your dumb girl drama so we can leave. God, wasting my time at some unimportant bullshit like this when I could be doing something important. Last time I&#39;m nice about this shit&quot; Matt growled, practically climbing over Eugene to get out of the isolated corner of the bleachers they&#39;d been sitting in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, uh, Matt I...I need-&quot; Eugene squeaked through the now constant pain. If he was...and they had...and this pain...&quot;Matt, don&#39;t leave me alone!&quot; He called back, but the greasy haired teen just flipped him off as he made his way down the bleacher steps. Hot tears began filling Eugene&#39;s eyes as the crippling feeling of being alone and in pain. This...this was horrible!<br />
<br />
&quot;NOW BATTING #6, TOM ACKERTON&quot; The announcer&#39;s voice said, and the crowd (the Shermer crowd, anyway) broke into a loud round of applause as the grim faced all-star made his way out of the dugout and towards home plate. The athlete gave the crowd a half-hearted wave as he stepped up to bat.<br />
<br />
&quot;HEY ACKERTON, GO FUCK YOURSELF!&quot; Matt yelled, beating the safety fence as he reached the bottom of the bleachers, earning a couple of angry yells, to which the bratty teen simply yelled back as he made his way out to the parking lot.<br />
<br />
&quot;I gotta...Fuck!...I gotta get...gotta wish...&quot; Eugene gasped as he felt an incredible pressure in his groin. He bent over as best as he could and fished the purse up, ignoring the tubes of lipstick and the small container of makeup that had spilled out in Matt&#39;s shameful exit. Tiny fingers fished in the dark interior as Eugene tried to ignore the pressure and pain, blinking away the wet blindness brought on by flowing tears as he desperately searched for the magical wishing rock. &quot;Wh-where!?&quot;<br />
<br />
But the pressure couldn&#39;t be denied any longer, and Eugene let out a shriek of pain in Eve&#39;s voice as a small flood vacated the gap between his legs and splashed instantly dampened the jeans he was wearing as the formerly balding redhead&#39;s body doubled over in pain. But the scream went unnoticed by everyone as Tom Ackerton sent a ball sailing into the blue summer sky and over the outfield&#39;s fencing, the Shermer crowd leaping to their feet as their team racked up another four runs from the one hit grand slam.<br />
<br />
Unnoticed by everyone except Emily, who shot to her feet and practically began leaping over her fellow cheerleaders and other members of the crowd as she made her way towards Eve...Who looked as if she was on the verge of passing out as she slumped against the safety railing. Her skin was almost pure white, clammy sweat and tears causing her once immaculate makeup to turn into a clownish mess. As the brown haired girl approached her former best friend, now estranged due to peer pressure and popularity and other high school bullshit, could hear have shallow and ragged Eve&#39;s breathing was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eve! Eve, are you okay? Wait, OHMYGAWD YOUR WATER BROKE!&quot; Emily screamed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Em...Emily...He-help me!&quot; Eugene whispered as loud as he could, lifting an arm that felt like it weighed a million pounds towards the one constant across all the different wish realities. &quot;I think...&quot; He gasped before another wave of pain flared from his abdomen. &quot;Find...I need the...need to...&quot; Eugene wheezed as<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god, you&#39;re going into labor!&quot; Emily screamed again, this time drawing the eyes of the nearby crowd. She pulled up her phone and quickly dialed 911 as she reached and grabbed Eve&#39;s shaking arm. Her eyes filled with tears as she felt how weak her pseudo-sister was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hang on Evie, you&#39;re gonna...You and Willow are gonna...You&#39;re gonna be okay!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Willow!?&quot; Eugene gasped, staring down at the painful protrusion in his stomach...And promptly passed out.</p>
