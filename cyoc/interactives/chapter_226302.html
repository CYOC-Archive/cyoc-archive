<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I still can&#39;t believe you&#39;re looking at leaving,&quot; Shuixing said in a soft tone as she and the Elements sat together at dinner on December 1, &quot;and after a wedding... too...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not all things stay the same,&quot; Tuxing said slowly or calmly as she looked to her siblings and one in-law, &quot;I mean... when we all became Animalians... we were all healing from what that cult did and looking for ways to regain some sense of pride and individual prowess. And in a way that all worked as the Elements. And when that started, I would have loved to have that last forever.&quot;<br />
<br />
She gave a small smile to her sister and reached over to take Shuixing&#39;s hoofed fingers in her paw-like hands.  Nate was presently seated back with his and Shuixing&#39;s daughter cradled at his shoulder. The Water Buffalo Animalian calf was quiet for the moment, after a meal from Shuixing and being burped by Nate, and even with the conversation going on, it looked like she was getting ready to nod off. It all represented some of the things that had been good for Nate and Shuixing and what Tuxing hoped would be there for her and Lenard in the future.<br />
<br />
&quot;But none of us expected what came next to happen,&quot; Tuxing commented, &quot;Getting Liao as an apprentice... you meeting and marrying Nate. The others having their mates or future mates. All of that represents change that none of us expected when we first became Animalians...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And it&#39;s some ways, it&#39;s been great,&quot; Huoxing commented, &quot;even if Gang always gets all red and embarrassed whenever anything more than holding hands comes up... though I know he&#39;s interested...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you didn&#39;t wear such low cut tops around him you wouldn&#39;t have that problem,&quot; Muxing chided Huoxing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Says the lady looking to find a way to seduce Li-Wei on her own terms,&quot; Huoxing teased back.<br />
<br />
Tuxing shushed that with a low rumble before looking back to Shuixing, who was a bit worried. And in some ways she understood, as Shuixing did take some things slow and going through with making Nate her bull because of her worries over Tuxing approving of Nate or Shuixing taking a mate.<br />
<br />
&quot;And while Nate had the freedom to move here, particularly once his younger brother was born,&quot; Tuxing spoke, &quot;Lenard doesn&#39;t have that luxury. Mikey has already gone through much in his life and having to leave friends because his and Lenard&#39;s parents died of Covid. Making Lenard move here would only uproot Mikey from friends he&#39;s made in Lenard&#39;s care. And Lenard&#39;s work for the school district he&#39;s in doesn&#39;t provide an awful lot of money. Moving here would uproot him from his job, and the job that he&#39;d be suited for is essentially already filled here. In this... it would be easier for me to go there and open a martial arts school of my own there than it would be to have him come here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shuixing slowly nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;And it won&#39;t be like you won&#39;t see Tuxing again,&quot; Nate told his wife, &quot;you guys have done quite well with everything that Animalia has used to play up your story and the comic series of you guys as superheroes and all that. So, it wouldn&#39;t be like visits aren&#39;t out of the question. Shoot, Yellowstone is a pretty good place to see. Maybe one day in the summer, we could all go, see Tuxing and go camping... and will work fine so long as we don&#39;t run into the bear in the woods.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tuxing smiled at that, and her mind drifted back to her Thanksgiving visit to her fiancée&#39;s cabin.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Things were fairly calm and quiet in Idaho for Thanksgiving. There was a small bit of a chill in the air, but there hadn&#39;t been much in the way of snow, though Tuxing felt relieved by that. She&#39;d rented a car after her plane landed in Boise so as to save Lenard having to drive across the state on a school night, though, unlike the surprise for Halloween, she&#39;d made sure her fiancée knew she was coming. It made for some interesting things, as to a degree, Tuxing was fairly familiar with Thanksgiving in America, as the Elements has still been in Lyre/Animalia for one and Nate celebrated the holiday as well. To a degree, food and family were nice and Tuxing had no reason to oppose that, even if the specifics were a bit outside her own holidays and culture, but Lenard Bearstone and his brother, Mikey, made everything worth it.<br />
<br />
The morning was pretty simply with Mikey enjoying the Macy&#39;s Thanksgiving Day Parade on the television, and telling Tuxing how he liked the balloons and even asked about whether or not they&#39;d ever make a Five Elements balloon for a future parade. Tuxing had to say that if a parade balloon were made to represent all of Animalia, it would either be Clara and Robbie, the first Animalians, or the original Animalia Ambassadoria cast, who had been the face and image for Animalia for its first four years. Tuxing also added that she generally preferred to be with friends and family, not being paraded around on strings. Mikey nodded and they enjoyed the parade. From there, Tuxing found herself helping Lenard in his kitchen.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t have to help... a lot of the stuff that will be done... like cranberry sauce, potatoes, and pie are more for Mikey, and he won&#39;t be able to eat all that much,&quot; Lenard said to her, &quot;the big thing will be more with the turkey... and that will then need to be split between all three of us, and I&#39;m sure you need more than Mikey will...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure... but I want to help,&quot; Tuxing commented, &quot;pull my weight, as it were. After all... we will be man and wife...&quot;<br />
<br />
That brought a small smile to Lenard&#39;s face and the two went about cooking, and Tuxing took that as some inward joy on his part. In a way, she felt the same way. Lenard&#39;s kind and caring demeanor and what she knew of his reputation at the school he worked at as a librarian showed that he more than met her standards, and his guardianship over his younger brother was all the more touching. In a way, Lenard very much represented the kind of family she&#39;d want to join. Her mind sang traditional Chinese love songs when she saw Lenard smile like that, as his smile also told her that he felt the same way.<br />
<br />
The two kept at work setting things up and making sure that things would be cooked. Some of it was time consuming and biggest thing that fit in that category was the turkey, itself. This was enough that had both Lenard and Tuxing pausing as the turkey roasted and helping Mikey with a small lunch while they waited. It made for good amusement and the scent of the turkey cooking was enough to make Tuxing&#39;s mouth water a little bit. Lenard noticed and gave her a chuckling taunt that she&#39;d have to share a leg with Mikey. Tuxing accepted that and they went about the work of preparing things, and eventually it set things up for a fine dinner between them. Mikey sat at the table with his back to the outside wall and a window, while Lenard sat opposite him and could look out that window. Tuxing sat to the right of Mikey and the left of Lenard.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what are you thankful for, Ms. Tuxing?&quot; Mikey asked, &quot;Is it turkey, like Lenny?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not just thankful for turkey,&quot; Tuxing smiled, &quot;I am thankful for finding someone who was smart and kind... caring and supportive... and honorable in all things... one I will be very happy to love for the rest of my life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I was thankful to find a brave and mature woman... unafraid to recognize my responsibilities... and bring joy into my life that hasn&#39;t been there since our parent&#39;s died,&quot; Lenard spoke as he took Tuxing&#39;s paw in his. Tuxing found herself smiling bat. &quot;And what are you thankful for, Mikey?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Happy parades... and a happy family,&quot; Mikey answered as he lifted up a drumstick, &quot;and good turkey.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;So... when will the wedding be?&quot; Huoxing asked to Tuxing, snapping her out of her thoughts for a moment, &quot;over winter break?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No... technically he&#39;d have time off from work, but he would want to invite some of his coworkers to the wedding, and they&#39;d likely have plans over Christmas,&quot; Tuxing answered, &quot;sometime in the summer would suit better, though we haven&#39;t gotten beyond that in terms of planning.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It may make some things with getting the marriage license something to pay attention to,&quot; Nate commented, &quot;sort of like with what Heiya Island... and the Chinese embassy here on the island wanted when I married Shuixing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that&#39;s something that Lenard will be looking into finding out and we&#39;ll go from there,&quot; Tuxing answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you&#39;ll be happy?&quot; Muxing asked carefully.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Tuxing answered, &quot;Lenard found his way into my heart... in that... just being around him makes me happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And we&#39;re all happy for you,&quot; Jinxing assured Tuxing.</p>
