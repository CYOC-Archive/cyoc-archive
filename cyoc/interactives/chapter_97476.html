<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Samantha felt heavily frustrated by events as they occurred. She had hoped that her Sunday would be quiet one where she could celebrate Nate&#39;s joining Ben&#39;s pack with family and friends. Privately, she and Frances had both agreed that the celebration was also to celebrate Martha&#39;s becoming a werecat and an additional lover for both of her and Frances. While she felt some relief and even enjoyment at seeing how well even William Anderson was adapting to being a werefox, Samantha&#39;s thoughts on him were still reserved. If he continued to demonstrate the strong mating bond to Martha that she had seen in him since his transformation was completed, he would earn her forgiveness for what he did before his transformation completed. If he fell back on old habits, Samantha was more than willing to get the divorce papers written for Martha to sign herself. So far, William was showing signs of improvement, and a part of Samantha figured that would be worth celebrating as well.<br />
<br />
Yet things weren&#39;t going to let her celebrate. Yvette Smith, the one who had scratched William Anderson during an attempt to rape him, was not only on the loose but had apparently infected another innocent person. Given what she knew or at least suspected of William Anderson initially, she hadn&#39;t thought that Yvette had been the instigator of the incident. However, after checking her email on her phone while Nate had been meeting his new Alpha the previous afternoon, she had found an email from the mayor that included a copy of the college&#39;s security camera footage from the parking lot. The shot was from some distance, but it was clear. William Anderson had walked to his car and opened the back door to place his briefcase in it. Yvette, fully transformed, then came onto the screen from behind him and tackled William Anderson into the car as the College Dean was soon seen running along the same route that William Anderson had come on. It demonstrated that Yvette wasn&#39;t the victim but the instigator, and even if William&#39;s transformation was willing, which she now doubted, the fact that she had publicly transformed was a violation of Moon Lake&#39;s laws. And from what the mayor had told her on the phone, it was clear that Yvette hadn&#39;t changed in her mentality.<br />
<br />
She pulled her car into the hospital parking lot and parked next Mayor Stovall&#39;s blue colored Ford Taurus. As she climbed out of her car, she looked up to the Moon Lake hospital. The hospital wasn&#39;t particularly large, as Moon Lake wasn&#39;t a big city by any means, and the natural healing abilities of its were-beast population meant that medical treatment for most injuries unnecessary. They&#39;d simply heal. But, given that Moon Lake did have some normals that lived in the town and that major injuries, such as those Ben&#39;s biological parents had suffered in a car accident, could still be fatal, and given the potentially infectious nature that were-beast bodily fluids contained, it included enough wings to cover just about every possible medical condition. And in the present situation with Yvette&#39;s insane or hormonal driven actions, that made sense.<br />
<br />
As she walked in she found a bit of a surprise, as both Mayor Stovall and Akane no Tachibana were waiting for her. Mayor Stovall looked tired and frustrated, and she wondered if the were-merman was paying more attention to the case than he needed to, if only get control over the situation. As a were that was breaking the city&#39;s rules on the loose was only going to create problems and the normals that lived in Moon Lake full time, or for college, could easily turn on the city if they couldn&#39;t demonstrate that city could protect them. Akane, meanwhile, looked downright furious, which Samantha figured related to who the rogue were was. The Skulk operated like a business corporation or like a country within a country in many ways, and despite her highly formal nature, Akane no Tachibana had driven the Skulk to be in favor of being beneficial to everyone in Moon Lake. Much of Moon Lake&#39;s present development in fact owed a lot to Akane&#39;s leadership of the Skulk. And the rogue were was a werefox.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, sir,&quot; Samantha spoke politely to Mayor Stovall and then turned to Akane, &quot;Hello, Ms. Tachibana. I wish things could be going better.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Mayor Stovall nodded, &quot;we all wish that... That vixen&#39;s actions could get us exposed to the world... and despite all the progress we&#39;ve made here in showing normals that we aren&#39;t the monsters we&#39;re made out to be...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is still the first thing many jump to when normals come to Moon Lake,&quot; Samantha sighed, remembering Martha and William&#39;s responses to her explanation about the town.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not to mention that we could still be looking at a potential lawsuit over her infecting William Anderson against his will,&quot; Mayor Stovall added.<br />
<br />
&quot;That I don&#39;t think is an issue, sir,&quot; Samantha spoke, &quot;He is adjusting well... and on some level... I&#39;d think the mating bond that married werefoxes have has been healing some private problems that have existed in his marriage. I&#39;d think he might actually be happy to be a werefox for that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... that&#39;s a relief,&quot; Mayor Stovall sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Though it doesn&#39;t change the baka decisions of that vixen,&quot; Akane said firmly with a heavy frown, &quot;she shames and dishonors us and could only make things worse. We all do a lot to benefit the town and the country as a whole... and she acts like the very monsters we try so hard NOT to be!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ms. Tachibana has volunteered her grandsons to assist the police in apprehending Yvette Elisabeth Smith,&quot; Mayor Stovall explained to Samantha, &quot;It was they who came across the victim of miss Smith&#39;s latest actions... They also reported it while the officers were talking with a fisherman who had reported seeing Yvette Smith...&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha sighed and nodded. She half wondered where Akane&#39;s grandsons were. The elderly werefox vixen&#39;s sons were still alive, but while they weren&#39;t as old as Akane, they weren&#39;t necessarily very young either. They typically ran the individual businesses that the Skulk ran with regard to real estate and the law while her grandsons served as her protection. Samantha had always figured this was a legacy of the fact that Akane was of a noble family and was surprised to find that the werefox didn&#39;t have her grandsons.<br />
<br />
&quot;Has there been any good news?&quot; Samantha asked, sounding a bit hopeful.<br />
<br />
&quot;Little, I&#39;m afraid,&quot; Mayor Stovall answered, &quot;her infecting the girl was to distract us from pursuing her, and while it was Ms. Tachibana&#39;s grandsons were the ones who responded... she did succeed in distracting us from direct pursuit. She then made her way back to the stream and we lost her again... or at least lost time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha watched as the Mayor continued to explain the situation and as Akane clinched her fists.<br />
<br />
&quot;And she also stole her victim&#39;s duffel bag... which had clothes in it and we don&#39;t know what else,&quot; Mayor Stovall continued, &quot;we have an idea of what she might be dressed in... but at the same time...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Many people may own similar clothes so we can&#39;t pursue her based on that,&quot; Samantha finished, &quot;but then... if she leaves the river area and comes back into town... our officers or the Skulk&#39;s security personnel can more easily track her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;ll still take time,&quot; Akane commented, &quot;even for the weredogs who&#39;s breeds are hounds... her scent will mix with the scents of everyone else in Moon Lake. They will need to isolate Yvette Elizabeth Smith&#39;s scent and then follow...&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha only sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can be thankful, though, that if she does come back into town,&quot; Mayor Stovall spoke, &quot;even if we can&#39;t truly identify her by her clothing... she will have to transform back to human form to avoid standing out like a sore thumb.  That&#39;ll slow her down.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hopefully,&quot; Samantha nodded, &quot;What can we do now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For the moment, we can deal with the new victim,&quot; Mayor Stovall answered, &quot;she&#39;s a college student... came here from Alabama... I think and is dating a native Moon Lake normal. We&#39;ll need to check with her and see what we can do... not to mention find a way to complete her transformation...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And assure her that she will have the Skulk&#39;s protection and support,&quot; Akane added, &quot;and full membership should she decide to remain in Moon Lake.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Has the College Dean been told?&quot; Samantha asked, &quot;Just to make sure that the girl is aware of the truth behind Moon Lake?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mayor Stovall nodded, &quot;and she did sign the waivers... and I learned just how loud a weretiger can roar when enraged. Between her attempt to rape one of his professors and now clawing a fellow student... he&#39;s pretty mad that those under his protection have been so victimized.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha nodded. While weretigers were more solitary than other feline weres, they weren&#39;t opposed to social interaction and tended to become quite protective... even territoriality protective over the things in their care. They could also be quite tender and soft depending on the action as well. Yvette&#39;s actions had probably angered the dean&#39;s territoriality protective side over the college.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... that&#39;s good,&quot; Samantha sighed, &quot;Or at least as good as we can get in all of this. I can talk with her about her condition... and perhaps even offer an apartment for her should  she decide to stay in Moon Lake.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d hoped for that,&quot; Mayor Stovall answered, &quot;It&#39;ll let me talk with her boyfriend and Akane can then handle the girl&#39;s welcome to the werefox community.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Best to lead the way,&quot; Samantha told him.<br />
<br />
The three then were soon walking through the hospital&#39;s hallways. They eventually came to a loan room  in the emergency wing of the hospital. Mayor Stovall quietly opened the door and Samantha followed quietly behind him. Akane followed along behind her. They found Jenny laying unconscious on a bed with blanket laying over her, which was probably to keep her covered and hide her nudity. Samantha could clearly smell the scent of fox on her, and she was still transformed, but very different from most werefoxes that Samantha had met. Most werefoxes were based off the Red Fox, but Jenny didn&#39;t look like a Red Fox. Her fur was largely a cream or creamish color and her pointed ears were massive in size. Her muzzle was narrow and pointed, but was not very long when compared to a Red Fox&#39;s muzzle.<br />
<br />
&quot;She is a Fennec,&quot; Akane spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;A what?&quot; Samantha asked curiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;A Fennec,&quot; Akane answered, &quot;It&#39;s a fox species from Africa... the Saharan Desert... and a rarity. Most of us are based off of the Red Fox.&quot;<br />
<br />
This served to alert the young man seated next to the bed, holding one of Jenny&#39;s furry paw-like hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mayor Stovall...&quot; the young man, Harry spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, young man, are you alright?&quot; Mayor Stovall asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... but perplexed by all this,&quot; Harry said slowly, &quot;Jenny&#39;s never been a werefox... we only met in college... I don&#39;t know how this could have happened to her...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A rogue scratched her when she stole your girlfriend&#39;s clothing,&quot; Mayor Stovall spoke, &quot;You were told this, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Harry answered as he turned to look back to Jenny. Her eyes fluttered a little bit, but remained closed, &quot;I can&#39;t believe this... I mean... no one ever pressured me after by brother became a were...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you could come out into the hall, we can talk,&quot; Mayor Stovall offered, &quot;as this rogue is a rarity among our kind in which she is willing to break our laws...&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry looked to him, glanced at Samantha and then Akane and then turned to Jenny. He saw her eyes flutter again and new she might be waking up. He wanted to stay by her side.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Town Chancellor and the Skulk&#39;s leader have some things to discuss with your girlfriend,&quot; Mayor Stovall spoke, &quot;and I assure you it won&#39;t be long.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry paused again, and then said, &quot;Okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Jenny&#39;s mind was rather hazy as her eyes opened again. She remembered having a great time with Harry on their little weekend camping trip. He had been so good to her and they got along quite well. She vaguely remembered a strange pinching sensation while she slept and then being restrained by a man in a business suit before being hit with a sedative that had knocked her out. As she started to awaken again she heard conversation going on around her and images of Harry and her on their camping trip, attending class, and eating pizza at a place called Dimaggios. She heard him say &quot;okay&quot; to someone and then heard the door open and shut.<br />
<br />
&quot;Harry?&quot; Jenny said weakly, &quot;Harry is that you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your boyfriend is talking with the mayor at the moment,&quot; came a woman&#39;s voice and Jenny turned to look toward where the voice had come from. She found a blond haired woman in relatively modest and casual dress. As if she had rushed from her own private life to the hospital. Jenny wondered who the woman was, though that wonder was soon answered. &quot;My name is Samantha Twist, I am the Town Chancellor for Moon Lake. How do you feel?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Stiff... itchy... horny... and by chest feels heavy,&quot; Jenny answered.<br />
<br />
She watched as Samantha sighed, &quot;That may come from your new form... this may...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;New form?&quot; Jenny asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please don&#39;t be frightened,&quot; Samantha said weakly, &quot;but you aren&#39;t human anymore. You&#39;re a werefox.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT?!&quot; Jenny screeched as she bounced back on the bed and then felt a great bounce on her chest that surprised her and made her look down. To her shock, horror, and surprise, she looked down to see two massive cream furred breasts with dark teat-like nipples poking through her fur. Her eyes widened in shock and surprise as she saw them. They had to be in the EE to F cup range, which surprised her to no end, as last she remembered she didn&#39;t have fur and her chest was only a B cup at the largest. She brought one hand up to feel the orb on her chest, and gave a startled yip as her hand was also cream furred and her fingers were tipped with claws.<br />
<br />
It was then that scents came into play for Jenny. Samantha Twist smelled like a cat and there was an older Japanese woman in the room who smelled like a fox. Jenny&#39;s mind began to panic as she wondered how all this could have happened to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh God... what... what... what is all this?&quot; Jenny cried out, &quot;What&#39;s happened to me?! I&#39;m not a were-beast! I&#39;m not a were-beast! I&#39;m a normal human woman!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m afraid a rogue in our society has changed that for you,&quot; Samantha spoke and reached out to touch Jenny&#39;s shoulder, &quot;The rogue clawed you and stole your clothing and anything you might have in your duffel bag with your clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can&#39;t I be human again?&quot; Jenny asked, &quot;What will Harry say about me? Oh... God... I can&#39;t get him out of my mind...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You love him?&quot; Akane asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You wish to be with him for your life?&quot; Akane asked again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She is bonding to her boyfriend,&quot; Akane said to Samantha.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bonding?&quot; Jenny asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s an emotional bond when we werefoxes find the one we truly love,&quot; Akane answered, &quot;You love him, and your mind wishes to protect that love.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And he has apparently remained by your side since you were brought here,&quot; Samantha spoke, &quot;So, it is probably safe to assume that he loves you... and his family lives in Moon Lake, so he is familiar with our were-beast population. Once your transformation can be completed, he may well help you in anyway he can.&quot;<br />
<br />
That eased Jenny&#39;s mind slightly, but she was still uneasy about what had happened to her. She pondered why she felt so warm between her legs even though no one was doing anything to her, and what freaked her out the most as all the sounds and smells. Detergent on the fabrics, cleaners on the counters, the werecat scent on Samantha and the werefox scent on Akane flooded her nostrils and the hum of electric equipment, the beeping of various medical equipment to monitor her blood pressure and her pulse were all too much.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can&#39;t I be human again?&quot; Jenny asked as she raised her hands up to her head to try and cover her ears, only to shudder at how large they were.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m afraid not,&quot; Samantha asked, &quot;Once you became a were-beast... you cannot go back. I am sorry that one of our rogues has done this to you and we will do everything we can to help you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;With what?&quot; Jenny asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Primarily adjustment at the moment,&quot; Samantha answered and gestured to Akane, &quot;This is...&quot; she paused for a moment to remember that in these formal situations that Akane traditionally used her last name first. &quot;...Tachibana no Akane. She&#39;s the leader of the werefox community here in Moon Lake and can help you with the ins and outs of what you are now and can explain all the new feelings that will relate to being a werefox.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The Skulk holds great sorrow and shame over the actions that have forced this on you,&quot; Akane said to Jenny, &quot;and you may feel assured that we will do all we can to support you and should you decide to stay in Moon Lake... you will be welcomed with open paws.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do I have to stay in Moon Lake?&quot; Jenny asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Samantha answered, &quot;If you wish to leave Moon Lake, that is up to you, but you will need to be careful as prevent yourself from being discovered as a werefox. Normal humans may treat you harshly not knowing that you&#39;re still in control of yourself and other than some physical aspects... you are still the woman who came to college here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what if I tell the world of all the weirdness here?&quot; Jenny asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You would violate the waivers that you signed when you came to college here,&quot; Samantha answered, &quot;and your own status as a were would mean that you would go down with us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny only shuddered.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you wish to return home, we will give you as much training as we can so that you can conceal your true self and control yourself,&quot; Samantha spoke, &quot;If you wish to stay in Moon Lake, the town is prepared to help you get a home for yourself...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you will be welcomed to the Skulk and will recieve our full support and friendship,&quot; Akane added.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about Harry?&quot; Jenny asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;That is up to him,&quot; Samantha answered, &quot;If you leave... and he follows, we can&#39;t and won&#39;t stop him. If you stay here and he chooses to be with you and becomes a werefox to be with you... we won&#39;t stop him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Jenny said slowly, and then looked to her guests, a blush forming under her fur, &quot;why am I so... so horny right now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably that your transformation is incomplete,&quot; Samantha answered, &quot;the rogue clawed you and fled. Normally you&#39;d need to mate with the rogue in order complete the transformation...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But the rogue is female,&quot; Akane spoke, &quot;and werefoxes are heterosexual in nature.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny shuddered. She was still straight, as while Samantha did look beautiful in the way a woman could look, it didn&#39;t really do much for her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Couldn&#39;t I do it with Harry?&quot; Jenny asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;He is still a normal human,&quot; Samantha answered, &quot;Unless he volunteers to become a werefox... doing so on your part would force the transformation on him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And this rogue?&quot; Jenny asked after a moment.<br />
<br />
Jenny watched as Akane&#39;s eyes changed from dark brown to glow with a red light while Samantha&#39;s eyes glowed green.<br />
<br />
&quot;She will pay for ALL that she has done,&quot; Akane and Samantha said in near perfect unison.</p>
