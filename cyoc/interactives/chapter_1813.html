<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The bash finally hit full swing at moonrise, when a sorority chick in a too-short skirt danced atop the table, thrashing to Hoobastank, or perhaps her own internal beat. <BR>
<BR>
She snapped to her feet, howling like a madwoman. <BR>
<BR>
A hundred more bestial voices joined the changing girl seconds later, bonded by the sheer delight of mass transformation, of unity at its most pure.<BR>
<BR>
The scene was degenerating rapidly, the dance floor becoming a mosh pit of rapidly devolving girls, the noises of the party mingling with increasing snarls and growls.<HR>"Okay, moment of truth on three. One, two..."<BR>
<BR>
Both Phoebe and Leslie stripped off their shirts and stared intently at each other.<BR>
<BR>
"Three...whoah."<BR>
<BR>
They had both been curious as to what the hell was happening to them, and had their curiosity answered in a most definite manner. Thick ruffs of fur, amber on Phoebe, black on Leslie, ringed their necks, hanging down betwixt their cleavage. Two new sets of nipples apiece graced their stomachs, which they explored with questing, clawed fingers.<BR>
<BR>
"Amazing," Leslie said, mesmerized by her roommate's appearance as she reached out to stroke the growing tawny tufts that were sprouting on Phoebe's cheeks.<BR>
<BR>
"More than amazing. Fucking awesome if you ask me," Phoebe said, licking growing fangs.<BR>
<BR>
When the howl echoed up through the dorm window from the party, they both joined in...<HR>Susan had lost track of Penny. She didn't much care where her friend was as she made a dash for the bathroom. The room was spinning, and she needed to get out of the dancing throng.<BR>
<BR>
In the bright fluorescence of the tiled room, she made her way to the sinks. She gasped when she saw herself in the mirror. Her hair had gone wild--a normal enough thing, save that it never came to a widow's peak in the middle of her forehead before. Her eyebrows had almost grown together, becoming so shaggy at her temples that they almost blended into her hairline. She saw a twitching motion amongst the thick blue and purple mane her hair had become, and brushed it aside to see her ears, now pointed, almost three inches long and growing, hairy, pointed, poking out above her hair as she watched. Her mouth was agape at the sight, and looking inside she saw her teeth had changed as well. Her gums and lips had darkened to black as yellowed canine fangs poked forth from bleeding flesh.<BR>
<BR>
She would have examined further, but she heard a frightened squeal from the dance floor and dashed out of the bathroom.<BR>
<BR>
"She bit me!" one of the Catholic girls wailed.<BR>
<BR>
Standing over her sobbing form was Penny, who looked like nothing so much as a fluourescent reinterpretation of the main character of <i>Ginger Snaps</i>, licking the poor girl's blood from her lips. Susan ran over to her.<BR>
<BR>
"Penny," she said, her voice huskier, but filled with reproach, "what the hell are you doing?"<BR>
<BR>
"Having fun," her increasingly feral friend quipped, "besides, she's the first one who complained."<BR>
<BR>
As Penny's words processed in Susan's head, she looked around the room to see her friend had told the truth. Penny certainly had made the rounds, with almost a third of the girls showing bestial features...and indoctrinating their friends with what had to be the hickie from hell...<HR>"You heard what I said," Wendy Tomlinson said to her roommate, a pleading look in her eyes as her nude body continued to twist into something less than human, "do you like it? Please, Carla, just answer. I don't know why, but I need you to like me this way."<BR>
<BR>
A noise that Carla Zuckerman could have sworn was a howl rose up from where the pre-frosh mixer was happening, and a shiver went down both their spines.<BR>
<BR>
Carla was changing too, she realized, looking down at the white downy growth that spread like fire over her forearm. Her clothes were binding, intolerably tight, and she stumbled to her knees as her feet bunched up in her shoes.<BR>
<BR>
Wendy howled, and the noise shook Carla even more as pressure began to build at the base of her spine. Wendy crossed the room, now covered in a luxurious auburn pelt, newly-grown wolfish tail swishing side to side. She reached out and lifted Carla's face until they were eye to eye.<BR>
<BR>
Carla squinted in pain, crying out as the seat of her pants burst to free an ivory tail that quickly swelled to full size. Opening her eyes again, she saw the desperation in Wendy's.<BR>
<BR>
"Please, Carla, just...just love me..."<HR>Amanda was quite literally beside herself.<BR>
<BR>
Her clothes had become unbearable as she traveled, and were discarded piece by piece. Only the backpack, the most important part, still fit her. It hung along her furry shoulders as she warred inwardly.<BR>
<BR>
She had stopped changing. She was thankful for that. This must have been what Zoë meant about their "incomplete" form. She wasn't sure if she could keep her head if she changed further, as what the moon had wrought upon her was terrible already.<BR>
<BR>
It was beyond just hearing Caitlin's voice. Indeed, part of her was the dead woman now. As if Solomon himself had divided them, she bore a line, like a scar, from stem to sternum. To her right, she was dark, rich, brown. To her left, she was crimson. Glancing in the lake, she had seen that on the left side of her face, her features weren't even her own.<BR>
<BR>
The voice was getting louder, and at times she could see the border of her two colors shifting, as if Caitlin wanted to claim the rest of her body.<BR>
<BR>
She had to make it to the center. Maybe she was lost, but the girls weren't yet...</p>
