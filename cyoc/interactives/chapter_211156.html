<br />
&#65313;&#65360;&#65360;&#65349;&#65345;&#65362;&#65345;&#65358;&#65347;&#65349;&#65306;E-355-1 appears as a large body of Hevea brasiliensis (Latex) of indeterminate mass, coloured bright red and normally contained in a large 123 meter diameter perfectly circular divot in the earth that is flush with the surrounding surface. Except in Feeding periods or when agitated, the primary E-355-1 instance will not change its shape nor size though may change location if it judges that there is too few Prey in the local region. As of 12:00 25/&#9608;&#9608;/20&#9608;&#9608; E-355-1 is still stationary inside the [Redacted] tundra, [Redacted].<br />
<br />
E-355-2 instances, commonly nicked &quot;Drones&quot; or &quot;Collectors&quot;, appear as doll-like imitations of animals or humans made entirely of bright red latex and entirely mouthless/eyeless, with a bare minimum of details. As well as various &#39;alterations&#39; depending on what they mimic (f.ex a humanoid might have a tail, or an additional arm, leg or foot) in some cases, though it&#39;s just as common for there to be no &#39;mutation&#39;.<br />
<br />
E-355-3 instances, commonly nicked &quot;Feeders&quot; or &quot;Fighters&quot;, appear as crude imitations of either humanoids, earth-animals and creatures or pre-historic as well as mythological beings made entirely of bright red latex, though unlike -2 instances bear weaponry in the form of sharp teeth, claws, fangs, spikes, quills and sharp objects in general made of fully black Latex. Additionally, -3 instances are much more detailed that -2 instances and all bear mouths with black teeth. The &#39;mutations&#39; present in -2 instances are much more rampant and significant in -3&#39;s, combined with body shapes not present in Earths biosphere this can lead to most &quot;Feeders&quot; appearing like overgrown abominations in comparison to the much more harmless &quot;Drones&quot;. -3&#39;s without or with next-to-no such rampant mutation are incredibly rare, and much more likely to occur in the &#39;calm-period&#39;.<br />
<br />
[&#65333;&#65360;&#65348;&#65345;&#65364;&#65349;&#65295;] Following the events detailed in Incident Log; 355-37, it has been noted that several instances of &#39;firearms&#39; were encountered, these instances were attached to several humanoid &quot;Feeders&quot; and appeared as long hollow cylinders of black latex. These imitations were used to cast blobs of anomalous latex at much greater distances than the previously-encountered latex-spitting done via a &quot;Feeders&quot; mouth. After the barely-avoided overwhelming of both Site-35-A and -B at the hands of this &#39;evolution&#39;, firearm utilizing -3 instances are designated priority targets underneath -4 instances. [&#65295;&#65317;&#65358;&#65348;]<br />
<br />
E-355-4 instances, commonly nicked either &quot;Queens&quot; or &quot;Matriarchs&quot;, appear much more humanoid than -2 or -3 instances regardless of whether they are deployed during Feeding Periods or not. When it is not a Feeding Period and -1 is not in any way &#39;Threatened&#39;, a -4 instance will generally look like the chosen &#39;captive&#39; but fully covered in red latex, holes and all, and though they are visually devoid of black-latex weapons can still morph forth plenty of weapons when needed. A -4 instance that appears during -1&#39;s feeding period will usually appear as a titanic humanoid entity that depending on the periods ferocity can range from a 60ft giant all the way to a 867ft titan (See Incident Log; 355-&#9608;&#9608; for more details regarding the &quot;Titan&quot;).<br />
<br />
&#65323;&#65358;&#65359;&#65367;&#65358; &#65313;&#65346;&#65353;&#65356;&#65353;&#65364;&#65353;&#65349;&#65363;&#65306;E-355-1 is composed of an unknown volume of anomalous bright-red colored Hevea brasiliensis (Latex) and is externally completely inactive. The latex that makes up E-355-1 as well as -2, -3 and -4 (except for its human core in the case of -4 instances) appears to at times behave as a solid, a non-Newtonian fluid, a viscous substance or low-viscosity liquid with a limited form for movement when not a part of a greater entity. Additionally the latex of E-355 showcase abnormal levels of durability that varies upon its location and the current &#39;mood&#39; of -1, with the latex of -1 itself having been virtually impervious to any form for damage so far. Additionally if 355 latex comes into contact with non-355 latex (rubber and industrial adhesives not included), the latex will rapidly be converted into more 355 latex.<br />
<br />
E-355-latex can in certain situations decide to act acidic and eat away at any material (see Addendum; 355-6 for more details) obstructing its objective. Additionally, 355 latex has an anomalous capability for independent movement whose speed usually depends on how much mass the moving latex has including the mood of E-355-1. E-355 latex also display a form of hive minded intelligence in the independent movement of 355-latex masses, which in feeding-periods will seek to merge with sufficient quantities of formless 355-latex into secondary E-355-1 instances, or to attempt and capture/occupy nearby Prey or to slow/dissolve nearby mechanical units/obstructions.<br />
<br />
Black E-355 Latex is a significantly more durable variant of 355 Latex, notably only found in the shape of sharp objects on -3 and -4 instances, and unlike normal 355 Latex does not appear able to stay &#39;formless&#39;, instead becoming red 355 latex if separated from the main body, or the main body is forced to dissolute. Furthermore 355 black-latex weaponry will convert non-anomalous inanimate matter they impact into 355-latex which will either attempt to merge with the nearest 355 entity, capture the nearest prey or attempt to form into a secondary E-355-1 instance. If the 355 black-latex weapon impacts animate matter (ie, humans, animals or plants), it will instead spontaneously generate a relatively significant amount of 355 latex that will seek to envelop the target, capturing humans while somehow instantaneously phasing plant and animal-life out of reality to later re-phase into reality following the conclusion of their Feeding Period.<br />
<br />
[&#65326;&#65359;&#65364;&#65349;&#65295;] Exerpt from Addendum; 355-9 on the phasing of local Fauna and Flora. Quote; &quot;While the thought-process of E-355 is inherently unknown, it has been concluded that whatever it really is, that 355 solely preys upon humans or Entities that presumably &#39;insults&#39; E-355-1 with their power. E-355 appears willing to go out of its way to preserve the local Fauna and Flora in order to protect them against collateral damage. The &#120376;&#120361;&#120378; of this behavior is entirely unknown and no satisfactory hypothesis has yet been proposed by -3 personnel assigned to observe E-355 via Site-35.&quot; End quote. (see Addendum; 355-9 for more details.)  [&#65295;&#65317;&#65358;&#65348;]<br />
<br />
When E-355 latex comes in contact with a human Prey, regardless of whether or not it is currently a Feeding Period, the latex will rapidly grow to to cover their skin, converting/eating any clothes and immobilizing the Prey. When the latex reaches a Preys erogenous zones it will start to &#39;tease&#39; them, commonly via simple vibrations and jolts of pleasurable electricity. When the Prey is fully covered in 355 latex it will begin trying to move them toward E-355-1 or to a safe place, though a captured Prey&#39;s primary form for transportation back to 355-1 would be a -2, -3 or -4 instance (depending on whether it is a Feeding Period or not), which will take the captured prey into their body and generally store them near their core, or carry them on their shoulder in the case of 355-2 instances or particularly small -3&#39;s. And when the Prey has reached the primary E-355-1 instance they are stored below its surface, if its a Feeding Period they are then Eaten by 355-1, if its not a Feeding Period they are kept as Captives whom are being constantly teased and pleasured by the surrounding latex.<br />
<br />
[&#65326;&#65359;&#65364;&#65349;&#65295;] It is currently unknown for what purpose E-355-1 stores humans who have been captured during the entity&#39;s calm periods as Captives. Except as a storage for -4 cores or as an emergency food supply following entirely failed Feeding Periods. Additionally it is unknown for what reason 355 Latex will automatically seek to tease humans they attach to, or why it has chosen this method in making human resistance more difficult.[&#65295;&#65317;&#65358;&#65348;]<br />
<br />
E-355-1 does not however, only have physical anomalous qualities, and its most significant anomalous quality is its constant reality-altering 50km radius aura centered on E-355-1&#39;s exact center. This aura is also carried by 355-2, -3 and -4 instances as well as its latex, and its radius can vary depending on -1&#39;s mood and size. With individual blobs/suits of 355 latex only exhibiting a 1-meter radius aura, -2 instances exhibit 50-meter radii, -3 instances exhibit a 500-meter radii aura and -4 instances, depending on their size can exert a 5-km aura at the smallest, to a 250-km aura at the most extreme (See Incident Log; 355-&#9608;&#9608; for more details). This aura instantly morphs any human within it into extremely voluptuous females, additionally adjusting nearby equipment and items into forms more suitable for use by extremely voluptuous females if applicable. Notably the aura also comes with a normalizing effect where if an individual were to leave its radius, they will be restored to before they entered the 355 aura. This effect also prevents individuals both inside and outside the auras radius from noticing the difference in realities, with someone outside the radius seeing the person inside the radius as a normal human being, while the person inside sees the person outside as another extremely voluptuous female. Additionally this normalizing effect carries over and affects digital media like cameras, recordings and phone calls/radio, requiring specialized instruments only available to G.E.T. and the shadow government to notice.<br />
<br />
[&#65326;&#65359;&#65364;&#65349;&#65295;] When it comes to the Transformation-Priority of 355&#39;s reality-altering aura, it is notable that while very high up among G.E.T.s many different Entities (the transformation-priority also increases drastically depending on -1&#39;s current mood, achieving one of the highest known to G.E.T. (believed to be either 3rd or 2nd highest) in its Frenzy (See Incident Log; 355-&#9608;&#9608; for more details)), 355&#39;s aura does not directly deny lower-priority transformations so long as said transformation does not oppose any change made by 355&#39;s reality, meaning numerous other entities will work just fine within 355&#39;s reality, but others may not correctly work (it is worth noting, that 355&#39;s reality does not oppose the existence of male creatures or male genitalia, only the existence of fully human males (notably not the existence of human hermaphrodites), nor does it oppose the transformation of human females into something else (so long as the end product is not a not-extremely-voluptuous human female)). Though there have been occasions where, when agitated, 355&#39;s reality began directly opposing the effects of another Entity, though this has only happened when 355-1 has fought against an entity whose effect(s) it supposedly resents (notably entities who in some form or other &#39;wastes&#39; a human being, like their transformation into cake for no solid reason (See Incident Log; 355-41 &#120368;&#120371; Addendum; 355-16 for more details)) resulting in 355 altering its reality to directly oppose said entity&#39;s effects. [&#65295;&#65317;&#65358;&#65348;]<br />
<br />
It has also been noted that the 355 aura has numerous side-effects together with its reality’s singular gender and general body shape. And most obvious of these is the affecteds mental adjustment (if applicable) into a female as well as the generation of requisite manners, routines, memories and knowledge for their current form, of note is that affected individuals are mentally adjusted into more &#39;soft&#39;, &#39;motherly&#39; and &#39;feminine&#39; women (this adjustment is universal and is particularly obvious in pragmatic or &#39;cold&#39; individuals and more &#39;boyish&#39; women, and particularly in how they approach people they know and most visibly with strangers) whom are notably squeamish when it comes to death-related topics and matters as well as &#39;gross&#39; things, except sex-related matters and topics. An affecteds sexuality is also adjusted into bisexuality though with a preference for other females (technically, due to the complete absence of non-entity human males within 355&#39;s reality, an affected can be classed as &#39;Lesbian&#39;, though they display zero aversion to male genitalia, penetration, dildos or sex-toys in general and will commonly describe muscular depictions of men (both clothed and nude, as well as their voice) as &#39;hot&#39;, &#39;attractive&#39; or &#39;arousing&#39;). Additionally an affected will gain a fetish (or have their normal-reality fetish adjusted to that) of being in bondage/restrained and sexually played with &#120368;&#120371; being restrained in skintight latex and being sexually played with (both meaning an affected will think of being a &#39;captive&#39; of 355-1 as &#39;hot&#39;). Additionally an affected will become mentally &#39;submissive&#39;, making them easily susceptible to bluffing, overconfidence (in certain situations), persuasion, intimidation, teasing, tricks, uncertainty and stress. <br />
<br />
Further aggravating the difficult and efficiency-degrading mental adjustments (all believed to be intentional on the part of 355-1) is the gradual mental degradation of skills and knowledge pertaining to military weaponry, equipment, tactics and behavior, mandating regular (one 1 hour session &#120369;&#120358;&#120371; &#120357;&#120354;&#120378; minimum) refresher courses, physicals, training and drills by a rotating selection of drill-sergeants and trainers. Due to the prevalent presence of a separate reality different from normal reality, personnel cannot be rotated from Site 35 and go through refresher courses in normal reality, as the 355 them will not have changed at all (aside from adapted memories) no matter what occurs in normal reality. And this is even further aggravated by the affected being easily stressed by what would be trivial matters, orders or requirements, and being exponentially more stressed in battle conditions, especially when battling 355 instances during a feeding session. A matter easily complicated by the fact that an affected cannot reliably de-stress without partaking in sexual activity, or (to much faster results) partaking in their fetish, a process that always takes at &#120365;&#120358;&#120354;&#120372;&#120373; a day after a minor fight or long day of work, and at least a couple &#120376;&#120358;&#120358;&#120364;&#120372; if not up to an entire &#120366;&#120368;&#120367;&#120373;&#120361; at the smallest depending on how hectic, brutal, lengthy or costly (in terms of people lost to either denial or capture to 355-3 instances) a fight against 355 during a feeding-period is, in order for an affecteds level of stress to be reduced to a degree where it will not come to interfere in their work. Several additional related mental adjustments given by the 355 reality to an affected is, heightened libido, complete removal of refractory periods, muted sense of shame (though it is not &#39;removed&#39;, an affected can tolerate acts and tasks that would normally carry a sense of shame, this also leads to an affected comfortably talking about sexual and sex-related matters or topics much more bluntly than would be normal, and also leads to such topics being commonly talked about in casual and idle conversation even when surrounded by strangers), minor exhibitionism (wearing clothing which either prominently displays their curves, or which shows off plenty of skin, but not to any degree that can be considered &#39;slutty&#39; or &#39;inappropriate&#39;), a fashion sense/clothing preference heavily skewed toward skimpy, bare and revealing clothing, increased degree of &#39;horniness&#39; as well as a more &#39;naughty&#39;/&#39;horny&#39; mindset at times and becoming easily stressed if kept inside thick, multi-layered clothing/armor or cramped vehicles for extended periods of time.<br />
<br />
[&#65326;&#65359;&#65364;&#65349;&#65295;] Excerpt of notice directed at 355 containment personnel on &#9608;&#9608;/04/20&#9608;&#9608; in response to the disastrous failure of containment personnel on the 6th of January 20&#9608;&#9608; (See Incident Log; 355-&#9608;&#9608; for more details) to 355; &quot;Due to repeated requests, complaints, breaches of conduct and breakdowns from stress, all impacting the performance of G.E.T. personnel assigned to the containment of Entity#355 to obvious and drastic effect. With approval from Upper Administration it has been concluded that standard G.E.T. rules of conduct as well as standardized dress codes clash with the universal mental adjustments of 355&#39;s layer of reality to an unacceptable degree, resulting in grievous loss of personnel effectiveness in the containment of E-355 instances, doubtlessly leading to the grievous failures of containment reported in Incident Logs; 355-11 through -17 as well as -19, -20, -24 and most recently and egregiously in -&#9608;&#9608;, requiring the deployment of significant amounts of heavy arms and transformed agents from outside the E-355 containment area. To address this, a separate list of dress codes and rules of conduct has been created specifically for personnel affected by 355&#39;s reality in order to restore effectiveness and reduce losses (both in materiel and personnel) to 355 feeding periods.&quot; [&#65295;&#65317;&#65358;&#65348;]<br />
<br />
Mental adjustment and morphing into extremely voluptuous females is not the only changes the reality of 355 enforces upon people within its radius, physical adjustment is also included among the changes in reality. Firstly, an affected can tolerate much colder temperatures without being chilled than normal, and in very cold environments take much longer than normal (several hours in average) before feeling uncomfortably cold, and even longer before being in danger of freezing. Conversely an affected is more easily susceptible to warmer temperatures, though they can find a hot-tub or hot-spring and the act of getting a tan relaxing, an effected will not enjoy being in a more temperate environment if they spend too long there, though with access to cold refreshments and access to a poll of cold water (like the sea or a lake) an affected may keep from suffering heatstroke if staying for a prolonged duration (It is believed that the resistance to cold is because of 355&#39;s sole presence inside a tundra, and to keep the constant cold from potentially killing a human before -2 instances can arrive). Secondly, an affected gains a minor healing factor, as well as minor resistance to injury, the primary utility of these adjustments is the reduction of an affecteds likelihood of dying to shock, blunt force impact, shrapnel or wounds in general. The regeneration slows any severe bleeding, quickly stops any minor bleeding, slows and hopefully fixing any internal bleeding, keeps any fatal wounds (except for truly fatal ones like the complete destruction of the brain, the presence of a large hole where the heart should be or full on decapitation) from quickly killing the affected and keeping the brain alive for as long as possible. The minor resistance primarily helps to overall minimize any damage or in jury the affected may receive, and particularly provides light bullet-resistance (particularly protection against low-power handguns or SMGs), and immunity against low-velocity shrapnel (particularly the shrapnel of a standard military frag grenade, though provides enough protection against higher yield explosives (particularly the ones in use by G.E.T. for infantry explosives against 355-3 instances) to still matter in a battlefield facing 355 in a feeding period), and especially protection against pressure-differential shock waves and explosions that makes an affected likely to survive a nearby high-yield (defined for infantry, not for vehicles) explosive as well as sudden 3 story drops without suffering a concussion or major injury like broken bones. Separate to all this, 355&#39;s reality also gives its affected a heavily enhanced endurance, offsetting any loss to an affecteds run speed due to their extremely voluptuous female form by letting them easily run the length of a marathon before being exhausted (a professional runner would manage a much farther distance) (see addendum; 355-5 for distance approximations and more details). <br />
<br />
Unfortunately an affected cannot then keep fighting despite any injury, as they are also given a very much decreased tolerance for pain as well as an increased sensitivity &#120373;&#120368; pain, as where a veteran agent might take numerous barely non-lethal bullet wounds without much protest, inside 355s reality that same soldier will be barely able to properly move with one bullet-wound equivalent injury (taking into account the increased sensitivity to pain), barely able to focus, speak &#120368;&#120371; move in a controlled manner with the second wound and straight up unconscious on the third. Comparably, a normal 355 affected will only be capable of taking at most 2 shots before immediately passing out, and it is important to know that both of these examples had taken both the max safe dosage of G.E.T. pain-muting drugs and a adrenal shot, though it is notable that the poor effect of said combat stimulants were also due to 355s reality giving strong resistance against drugs (except drugs for inducing medical comatose) and narcotic substances as well as an exceptionally strong immune system (both matters are believed intentional by 355, the higher likelihood of survival in general to give -2/-3 instances more time to reach, the increased sensitivity to pain to make prey more easily incapacitated, especially in battlefield conditions. As well, the extreme reduced effectiveness of combat stimulants and medical drugs that could be used in place of said defective stims, is believed to be to prevent any easy counteraction of the second point as well as any other). Additionally, an affected of 355&#39;s reality will have, in parallel to their increased sensitivity to pain, a similarly very much increased sensitivity to pleasure, especially from stimulation to their erogenous zones. This drastic increase makes even light touches enough to make any affected squirm, especially when applied to their erogenous zones, a small vibrator would consequentially feel like it was on the highest setting despite only being on the first setting above &#39;off&#39;, a belt or piece of rope might also feel even tighter than they really are if applied in certain spots (Another factor believed intentional by 355, both to potentially complicate any physical task or the act of carrying around certain equipment as well as using said certain equipment, and to make an affected more susceptible to the touch of 355 latex as well as their fetish).<br />
<br />
E-355-2 instances, as previously mentioned, appear as either humanoid or animalistic dolls made entirely of bright red latex. These instances are usually only made for the capturing of lone or small groups of humans which have wandered into -1&#39;s &#39;area&#39; and are a great deal less dangerous than a -3 instance, not having any black-latex &#39;weapons&#39; and being only strong enough to simply overpower any human affected by the 355 aura. Notably, a -2 instance is capable of attaining much higher speeds than a -3, quickly able to reach velocities of 120kph as well as be able to sustain it even through patches of tightly packed trees. Though despite not being at the level of &quot;Feeders&quot; they do nonetheless have an extreme tolerance to damage aside their ability to reform should it be necessary. The latex body of -2 instances are nonetheless fully capable of shrugging off bullets with too little stopping-power or penetrative capacity, while their extreme tolerance to damage means they can take hundreds of bullets fired by sufficiently-powerful firearms without any reduction in capability, as well as still function despite the loss of large parts of their form, the body of a -2 will nonetheless dissolve into a formless mass of 355 latex if reduced to pieces smaller than approximately 50 cubic centimetres or if rendered irrelevant through incapacitation far away from any site of conflict. <br />
<br />
E-355-3 instances, as previously mentioned, appear as extremely &#39;monstrous&#39; imitations of humanoids, earth-animals as well as prehistoric or mythological entities with heavy deviations/mutations far beyond the norm displayed by -2 instances. The purpose of -3&#39;s are that of &#39;hunters&#39; and &#39;warriors&#39; for -1&#39;s feeding periods, capturing &#39;prey&#39; to feed -1 with much more forceful methods than might be used by -2&#39;s, -3&#39;s are normally only seen during -1&#39;s feeding periods though have begun appearing alongside groups of -2&#39;s in what is believed to be a response to G.E.T. interception of &#39;capture parties&#39;, as well as in situations where G.E.T. personnel have attempted to approach -1 in heavily-armed groups. Due to their commonly extreme size-difference to -2 instances, -3&#39;s can only attain top speeds of 90kph but have a much higher rate of acceleration, letting them do stunts that would normally be straight up impossible without stopping their approach to a G.E.T. firing line. The primary way in which a -3 is different to -2&#39;s is the presence of claws, spikes and other sharp objects made of black latex, where a -2 must use their merely-overpowering strength in clearing their way to &#39;prey&#39;, a -3 can use their black-latex claws or jaws and supernatural strength to clear the way as well as destroy non-human objects in their way to &#39;prey&#39;. The weapons of a -3 are many and limitless in shape, though are normally limited to close-ranged weapons (though can be found attached to large tentacles), although in recent times -3&#39;s have been seen utilizing crude imitations of firearms as a method of delivering blobs of 355 latex much farther and faster than their normal &#39;spitting&#39; method utilizing their mouths.<br />
<br />
E-355-4 instances, as previously mentioned, appear as humanoid giants who keep to the general body shape of a human but with numerous &#39;mutations&#39;, in general these &#39;mutations&#39; will take the form of black-latex weaponry or be covered/tipped with such Black-latex weaponry, unlike -3&#39;s a -4 might also carry and use a massive black-latex weapon that can take a variety of forms that mimic historical weapons (this weapon most-commonly appears as swords or oversized blunt weaponry and will only dissolve upon its wielders dissolution). The role of a -4 is commonly observed as a super heavy troop that is sent when -1 wants a section of heavy resistance shattered or broken, the -4 rushing in to occupy the attention of the strongest defenses while the following swarm of -3&#39;s exploit any openings to capture vulnerable prey. E-355-1 will normally only send one -4 during feeding periods, though if resistance proves especially stiff or -1 is particularly angered and just one -4 proves to be not enough, additional -4&#39;s may be sent. Though by similar metric E-355-1 might not send out -4&#39;s if it&#39;s supply of captives is particularly low yet resistance to its -3 instances proves incredibly stiff. In recent times due to -1&#39;s high supply of captives, it has begun using -4&#39;s as mouthpieces and to lure prey as well as convey messages to another captive.<br />
<br />
E-355-4 instances additionally display capabilities far beyond that of -3&#39;s, and though it can easily cover vast areas in 355 latex it typically does not seek the capture of prey, instead leaving -3 instances to the task of capturing and transporting prey. A -4 instance, despite its commonly major size-difference with -3 instances, is capable of just as quickly attaining speeds upwards of 120kph or more, striking fast and hard. Compared to a -3, a -4 instance is paradoxically both extremely harder and easier to deal with, its latex having a much higher durability, strength and resistance centred around the instances Core. The primary limiting factor for a -4 is its need for a Core in order to form, this Core is a solid cocoon around a captive which has been previously captured by -1. Consequentially the destruction of the core (and the death of the Captive) will immediately result in the instances full dissolution. <br />
<br />
E-355-1 is the primary instance of E-355, and as previously described, appears as a large pool of bright-red Hevea brasiliensis (Latex) that has proven entirely indestructible to any and all attempts at its destruction/damaging. And as previously said, is the point-of-origin of all 355 latex and every -2 -3 or -4 (excluding -4&#39;s human core) instances, as well as the location of every E-355 &#39;Captive&#39; and primary location for the deposit of &#39;Food&#39; during feeding periods. Despite appearances, E-355-1 is not entirely immobile and is in fact capable of relocation but has been found to prefer being at a moderate distance (defined as circa. 50km&#39;s distance) to large human concentrations from which it can periodically feed. Should there be major fluctuations in the concentration of humans it may attempt to move towards more stable concentrations of humans at an estimated speed of 10kph, though will generally stay put for a period after any successful feeding periods. E-355-1 has shown the ability to become larger than its normal 125 meter diameter size, though normally it has only expanded during feeding-periods or when agitated. Of higher note is the capability of sufficient quantities of 355 latex to form secondary instances of E-355-1, permitting the on-demand generation of -2/-3 instances far away from the primary -1 instance. Fortunately, secondary -1 instances are, unlike the primary instance, not invincible, though require significant firepower to be neutralized, though the creation of secondary instances has so far only been observed during feeding-periods or when agitated.<br />
<br />
The primary E-355-1 instance is currently believed to be the primary intelligence of every E-355 instance, being the origin of all E-355 latex known by G.E.T. and which projects the largest reality-altering aura (from the normal 50km radius to the aprox. 700km radius during the Frenzy (See Incident Log; 355-&#9608;&#9608; for more details)). The primary E-355-1 instance also serves as the centerpoint of E-355&#39;s &#39;territory&#39; (can technically be referred to as &#39;activation radius&#39;) inside which it will dispatch -2 &#39;capture parties&#39; to any wandering humans within 30km&#39;s of 355-1 (unless they are in groups larger than 5 or are excessively armed), if humans enter 15km&#39;s of 355-1 -regardless of the groups composition or size- much larger -2 groups would be sent (accompanied by a significant presence of -3 instances if the group is especially armed). Additionally 355-1 will send -3 instances to destroy any human-made objects (like drones) inside of 5km&#39;s requiring the usage of high-altitude drones or esoteric sensor technology for any active monitoring of 355-1. Any human Prey captured by E-355 instances will be transported back to the primary E-355-1 instance, where they will be &#39;stored&#39; underneath its Hevea Brasiliensis and relentlessly teased.<br />
<br />
At a period of once every 2 months E-355-1 enters what has been termed a &#39;Feeding Period&#39;, in this period 355-1 will begin aggressively capturing any nearby humans primarily with -3 instances. Any human captured during this period will, like a Captive, be transported to the primary E-355-1 instance. Unlike Captives however, Food will be &#39;eaten&#39; by 355-1, a process identified to be the &#39;disintegration&#39; of the Foods Soul and Mind via E-&#9608;&#9608;&#9608; (see Addendum; 355-20 for additional details). The period between Feedings is not rigid, and depending on how much Food was acquired and how much &#39;effort&#39; was expended in capturing them by E-355, may shrink (if less Food was gained in comparison to the effort spent) or grow (if more food was gained in comparison to the effort spent). Notably the gap between 355 Feeding Periods has been noted to have grown progressively slower after several periods of relaxed asset-denial following the Frenzy (see Incident Log; 355-&#9608;&#9608; for more details). <br />
<br />
&#65315;&#65359;&#65358;&#65364;&#65345;&#65353;&#65358;&#65357;&#65349;&#65358;&#65364;&#65306; Being a, mostly, stationary entity that reacts negatively to the long-range proximity of uncaptured Humans or man-made objects, E-355 is not able to be safely nor effectively contained inside a dedicated site, otherwise requiring an impractically large site that cannot be easily hidden from local Civilians. To effectively contain E-355/prevent it from Feeding on local population centers, a trio of military sites (sites 35-A, -B, -C) were established at equidistant points from each other 20km&#39;s distant to the primary E-355-1 instance, the sites primary task is to serve as the primary yet second line of defense against E-355 Feeding Periods. Therefore these sites are primarily composed of militant 5&#39;s with an administrating detachment of 4&#39;s, the loss of these sites in an E-355 Feeding Period is to be taken as a sign of either critical failure/malfunction in containment efforts or extreme agitation in E-355-1 and subsequent major expenditure of &#39;effort&#39;.<br />
<br />
To serve as the first line of defense against E-355 Feeding periods, a long series of militant subsites are based equidistantly to each other 15.1km&#39;s from E-355-1 and each have a significant presence of Autonomous Combat Platforms absent any human presence with the primary objective of saturating/delaying the initial wave of &#39;Feeders&#39; in Feeding Periods. Additional militant subsites are located behind Sites 35-A, -B and -C that primarily exist as sites for high-precision artillery, with defensive militant subsites surrounding Site 35-E to keep away any probes by E-355 instances. Furthermore to support in the containment of E-355 Feeding Periods and serve as a last 3rd layer of defense against E-355 Feeding periods, Site 35-D was established first as the primary base of operations for E-355 containment efforts, then as the Strategic, Operational and Administrative center of 355 containment. Located 30.2km&#39;s northeast of E-355-1, the site most importantly serves as a the local airbase for G.E.T. personnel and aerial drones (both surveillance and air-support), and additionally as the nerve-center for G.E.T. operations in the local area around or inside E-355-1 aura.<br />
<br />
While the existence of E-355 and the major presence of G.E.T. agents is to be held fully confidential as is standard protocol, the presence of Civilians inside E-355&#39;s reality is permittable and encouraged so as to prevent E-355-1 from sending -2 groups outside the normal 30km radius. The usage of several hiking trails through E-355 territory (all of which will avoid any G.E.T. site/subsite) by Civilian hikers is therefore encouraged, usage of suggestive memetics is permitted in order to draw hikers to these trails. While their purpose is to prevent E-355-1 from expanding its &#39;territory&#39; outside of Feeding Periods via supplying E-355-1 a steady yet slow source of Captives, in order to keep the trails open and frequented without unnecessary amounts of cover-up, obfuscation or memetic agents, 80%-95% of monthly &#39;outer-territory&#39; (defined as the area between 30 and 15km&#39;s away from E-355-1) hikers are to be prevented from being captured via interception of E-355-2 capture-parties. Additionally Civilian settlements within E-355&#39;s reality is permissible outside of 45km&#39;s to E-355-1 and 5km minimum distance to any G.E.T. Site, any settlement attempts within this radius is to be discouraged with standard discouragement methods for human settlement within anomalous radii. <br />
<br />
&#65327;&#65364;&#65352;&#65349;&#65362;&#65297;&#65306;In general, the destruction of -2 or -3 instances requires the heavy utilization of specialized weaponry, equipment and strategies (all of which is solely developed and utilized by G.E.T.) in order to achieve an efficient usage of personnel and materiel in the containment and combating of E-355 instances. Initially developed by the Shadow Government when their initial efforts completely failed, Electro-Chemical-railguns were developed from &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608; &#9608;&#9608;&#9608; &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608; (acquired through E-103)  to provide sufficient firepower for G.E.T. weaponry, vehicles and Autonomous Combat Platforms to effectively combat E-355-3 and -4 instances from an agitated E-355-1. Power Armour with hard-kill Active Protection System armor plates to intercept incoming 355 latex as well as carry the equipment necessary for their weaponry.<br />
<br />
&#65327;&#65364;&#65352;&#65349;&#65362;&#65298;&#65306;To prevent the mental adjustments of E-355&#39;s reality from making Site-355 personnel combat ineffectual, as well as serve as a pragmatic and G.E.T. adherent site-Administrator, Researcher and Commander of 355 containment efforts with the additional task of administrating personnel De-Stressing and assignments. Object-&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608; (Designated J.A.I.L.O.R.) was selected by Upper Management for insertion into overseer of E-355 containment efforts and control of Autonomous Combat Platforms and Humanoid Machine Units.<br />
<br />
&#65327;&#65364;&#65352;&#65349;&#65362;&#65299;&#65306; In order to facilitate the De-stressing of G.E.T. personnel due to the effects of 355&#39;s layer of reality, designated areas for the bondage of affected personnel were established in containment Sites. In order to serve as the primary location for affected personnel undergoing long-term bondage-sessions following heavy skirmishes or battles against agitated E-355 instances, Site 35-E was summarily established in order to De-stress affected personnel. Site 35-E additionally serves as the primary location of agent rehabilitation by rotated military instructors following the conclusion of their long-term de-stressing.<br />
<br />
&#65327;&#65364;&#65352;&#65349;&#65362;&#65300;&#65306; Following Incident Log; 355-&#9608;&#9608; and the Frenzy&#39;s eventual end, several new abnormal effects were discovered inside 355&#39;s reality. Of highest note was the spontaneous generation of a constant blizzard similar to that of E-403&#39;s Winter-phase absent any transformative effects, nor has any other of E-403&#39;s abilities been shown by E-355, especially not its transformative effects. The new abnormal effects were first sighted 4 days after the conclusion of E-355&#39;s Frenzy (see Incident Log; 355-&#9608;&#9608; for more details), and all from Entities confirmed to have been Consumed by secondary E-355-1 instances.
