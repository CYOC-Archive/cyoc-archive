<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tony gave Jeff a push and stepped back in the process.  His body was on fire, well not quite on fire but undergoing some kind of change that had him bewildered.  He felt as if paralyzed.  He tried to move but couldn't take a step or raise his arm and yet he didn't fall, immobile, to the ground.  He found himself locked in a posed stance, legs slightly apart, arms at his sides, head slightly raised like he was ready to be photographed or something.  Out of the corner of one eye, he could see himself in his mirror.  He noted that his penis was back to its normal size and not hte comically oversized phallus Jeff had given him.<br />
<br />
If he'd been able to form an expression, Tony probably couldn't have chosen between deeply worried and euphoric.  Something indescribable was happening inside him.  With each passing second he felt lighter.  With each passing second he felt as though gravity had less claim on him.  He wondered if he was becoming some sort of science fiction being composed of only light.  All his insides felt as though they were now just air. <br />
<br />
Then his feelings became only worry as he felt his skin harden.  It was becoming a hard plastic shell just a small fraction of an inch thick.  And then, Tony felt his body splitting.  He somehow sensed his head and neck splitting from his chest and abdomen which split from his hips, which split from his two legs and his arms also split from his chest/abdomen bulb.  Tony somehow never lost the ability to see, nor his hearing, smell or touch.  Taste was lost to him as his plastic lips were not parted. Out of the corner of his limited range of vision, Tony could see himself in the mirror.  <br />
<br />
He was a mannequin.  And he was not just anatomically correct.  He was anatomically precise.  He was Tony turned to plastic with all the interior of his body turned to air.  Every tiny hair, the lines on his palms, the folds of his foreskin, everything was there in hard plastic.<br />
<br />
Jeff laughed.  &quot;Dude.  This is too perfect.  You turn yourself into a model and now you get zapped into being a mannequin&quot;<br />
<br />
But before Jeff could gloat any further at Tony's fate, Tony seemed to waver in the air and a moment later was gone.  &quot;What the hell?&quot;  Jeff shouted.  He waved his hand back and forth through the spot where mannequin Tony had stood in his posed stance.  But there was nothing there.  Jeff lurched back to the desk and frantically scrolled through the chronivac displays to figure out what had happened to Tony.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Mannequin, check . . forrrrrrrr . . eight days . . memory of previous profile . . restricted to other registered profiles using this chronivac . . let's see . . oh, relocated to the Neiman Marcus menswear section at the store 20 miles away.  Shit, I've gotta go see Tony in his natural element&quot;<br />
<br />
His abrupt relocation from his bedroom took Tony completely by surprise.  One moment he was next to his bed.  A split second later he was atop a short, 10 inch high platform next to another, already clothed mannequin in the Dolce &amp; Gabbana area of the Neiman Marcus menswear section.  <br />
<br />
Two gay men walking by stopped and looked him over.  They walked around back of him.  Tony heard one giggle delightedly.  &quot;Look at the detail!&quot; the other cooed and Tony felt him touch his hard plastic ass.  Just as he did, a young man in stylish dress pants and shirt walked hurriedly by carrying an empty cardboard box and some price tags.  He did a double take and stopped.<br />
&quot;Wh-where did that one come from?&quot;<br />
&quot;I don't know but you should get a whole lot more like it!&quot;  One of the men behind him quipped and Tony heard both of them snicker.<br />
<br />
The young man, who was obviously a store clerk or salesman, dropped the items in his hand and inspected Tony.  He squinted quizzically as he touched a hand to Tony's leg and felt tiny plastic hairs that were barely visible.  He brought his hand near but refrained from touching Tony's frozen in plastic penis and pubic hairs.  He touched Tony's nipples and marveled at the accuracy in plastic of Tony's close cropped haircut.<br />
&quot;They never have nipples&quot; he absentmindedly observed.  &quot;They never have any of this stuff.&quot;<br />
<br />
The young man called over his supervisor who was out and proud and examined Tony, hand on chin while answering the young man's questions.  <br />
&quot;What do we do with this one?  Where did it come from?&quot;<br />
&quot;Helen must have ordered it.  I must say it shows better taste than I thought she had.  I'd have thought she would order the Joey Buttafuoco model&quot; he sniffed.<br />
&quot;Well, what do we do with it?&quot;<br />
&quot;I can think of some things&quot; interrupted one of the men behind Tony.<br />
The supervisor smiled at him and pondered those things for a few moments.<br />
&quot;No, just dress it like the one next to it&quot;<br />
&quot;With the colors intentionally mismatched, too?&quot;<br />
&quot;Of course!&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Tony felt the slim young man pick him up effortlessly by lifting him at the armpit and he was carried into a back room filled with shirts, pants, suits, racks for clothes and discarded parts of other mannequins.  Where the young man put him down, Tony could see detached hip bulbs, detached chest/abdomen bulbs and a score of stray arms and legs.  <br />
<br />
The young man raised Tony's arms, which could be moved, albeit stiffly, and pulled a tight fitting dark blue shirt onto Tony.  He laid Tony down on the carpet and Tony could feel socks being tugged onto his feet but could only see the water stained false ceiling above.  Then he felt the young man pull a pair of pants onto him and set him upright in front of a three way mirror.  The young man laughed.  &quot;I don't think so&quot; he said and patted Tony's crotch.  &quot;You're just a little too anatomically correct for D and G's slim silhouette flat fronts.&quot;  Tony could just glimpse the front of his dark brown pants in the mirror.  The bulge really was too conspicuous.<br />
<br />
The young man dropped Tony onto his back again and pulled off the pants.  Then, to Tony's horror, he pulled off Tony's legs, each one detaching from his hip bulb with a deep bass sort of pop sound.  Tony could still feel his legs, one resting against his left arm and the other tossed to the side on the carpet.  <br />
<br />
Tony's mind raced with nightmare possibilities of being casually dismembered and being stuck like that.  Then it got worse.  The young man pulled off Tony's hip bulb, consisting of just his buns in the back and the lowest portion of his abdomen including his genitals and going about halfway to his navel in the front.  &quot;Won't be needing this&quot; the young man said as he tossed Tony's hips off into the pile of discarded mannequin parts.  <br />
<br />
Tony was now in shock.  Almost half his body had been split apart from him and he could still somehow feel those parts.  &quot;Jesus!  All of this because Jeff had to go and play games with my dick!  My own johnson wouldn't have been on the keyboard like that!  Now!  Now . . this &quot;<br />
<br />
While he reproached Jeff and himself in his shock, the young man casually retrieved another hip block from the pile of discarded parts.  He jokingly held it out in front of Tony.  It was no less wide than Tony but with flat little buns, barely split at all and a small bulge at the crotch the size of an egg split lengthwise.  &quot;You're new equipment, my man.  Guys who're hung don't wear D and G&quot; he chuckled.  With that, Tony felt him push his new hip section into place with a pop.<br />
<br />
No!<br />
<br />
Then the young man reattached Tony's own legs and pulled the brown pants on him and set him upright.  He adjusted the blue shirt and then satisfied with that, pulled a couple of oddly pointy square toed shoes onto Tony's feet.  He carried Tony by one belt loop of his pants now and returned him to the display where Tony had first materialized in the store.  The supervisor inspected him and noted with surprise how well Tony fit into D &amp; G's flat fronts.  The young man laughed and unzipped the front of Tony's pants to reveal the extremely modest anatomically incorrect bulge.  They shared a laugh.<br />
<br />
Tony's mood remained bleak.  In a short time, the store closed.  He was alone in the semi-dark, unable to move, part of his body not even his own.  He found that even sleep was not possible to him.  Somehow, he did not feel fatigue.  He tortured himself hour after hour running through his head every possible thing that could happen.  <br />
<br />
What if this profile is set that nobody remembers I existed?  No, wait, we set it so that the five of us always remember each other.  What if they try to change me back and I die because I have no hips?  What if they change me back and I end up with this unibuttock ass and don't have a penis any more?  What if they can't change me back because I'm not all here?  He could feel the coarse rug against his plastic penis and a plastic leg against his plastic buns back in the storeroom 50 feet away.<br />
<br />
The next day, Tony watched the sun rise and later the store open.  Late in the morning, his spirits leaped when he saw Jeff, Jack, Eric and Mark enter the store.  From his position at the far end, he could see them walking in front of every display, looking at every mannequin.  Finally, almost last of all the possible ones, they approached Tony.  <br />
&quot;Hey bro!&quot; Mark whispered as the others nodded greetings.  Jeff, too, looked very sympathetic, now, and he was carrying his laptop.  They all circled Tony and inspected him.  In his mind Tony was shouting.  &quot;That's not my ass!  Come on guys!  Look at that weak behind!  That's not me&quot;<br />
But the only immediate response from his brother and friend was Jack sidling up next to him and mumbing &quot;Brown and blue?  Jesus Christ, guy, I wouldn't have put that outfit together when I was a little kid&quot;<br />
<br />
As Tony watched, a very simple plan unfolded.  Jeff and Eric, both much too large to wear the pants on him, found the other similar sized pairs of the same pants and took them halfway across the store and hid them behind another display.  Meanwhile, Jack and Mark both expressed interest in buying a pair like the mannequin wore.  The same young man who'd dressed Tony was the one to try and help them.  He was taken aback by how much Mark resembled the larger mannequin.  Tony thought it was a mistake to have brought Mark along.  The resemblance was just too much.  Jack and Mark had to ask two more times for the same pants as on the mannequin before the clerk could take his eyes off the resemblance between Mark and Tony the mannequin.  He looked through the racks for those same pants in the 31 inch waist that Jack requested but couldn't find any.  Tony saw him reaching around behind him.  <br />
&quot;Oh, these are 31's.  I-I could've sworn we had some more pairs in sizes like that&quot; the clerk added, looking around just as Jeff and Eric returned with a bag.  Jeff had bought the cheapest (still dramatically overpriced) pair of 31 inch waist relaxed fit jeans and a t shirt.  He pulled each out of the bag and showed Tony.  He handed the bag to Eric and powered up his laptop.  <br />
<br />
Reluctantly, the clerk agreed to take the pair off the store mannequin and, again, effortlessly picked up Tony and carried him along to the storeroom.  Jeff was undecided on how to play it.  He could zap the clerk right there, but it would look funny for 4 guys to sort of disappear into the storeroom with the clerk and the clerk not emerge immediately.  He thought another clerk was watching them, too.  He nudged Jack and nodded his head toward the changing rooms.  <br />
<br />
He again saw another clerk watching them, perhaps worried about theft from the storeroom and gestured for Eric and Mark to remain with him by the display stand outside the open storeroom door.  In just a few seconds, the clerk had pulled the pants off Tony and was over at the changing rooms with Jack.  Jack did everything possible to keep the clerk there.  He asked when these pants had come in, was there any prospect of an upcoming sale and quickly changed into them.  Despite Jack's modest rear and average penis, they were tight around his hips.  He had the clerk stand with him by the mirror and actually asked if he thought they made him look fat.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Jeff, Eric and Mark were standing by the empty shelves of an unused display trying to look bored while Jeff frantically typed away at the laptop to call up Tony's profile.  He pulled the emitter out from inside his jacket, laid it down on the counter and pointed it toward the open storeroom doorway where Tony's legs were visible.  He was only a few keystrokes away from finishing the process to transform Tony when Jack suddenly bounded halfway to him from the changing rooms.<br />
&quot;Jeff!  Stop what you're doing and look at this!  Stop!&quot;<br />
&quot;What the fu-&quot; Jeff muttered.<br />
&quot;Jeff!  Look out how tight these pants are on my little rear&quot; said Jack suddenly affecting a slight lisp.  &quot;They could never fit on Mark or somebody built like him, could they?&quot;<br />
&quot;Um, no.  I-I guess not&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff, Eric and Mark all considered this while Jack went back to the changing rooms and barraged the clerk with questions about letting the pants out and altering the hem while standing in front of the mirror.<br />
<br />
Mark darted into the store room and immediately saw that perfectly detailed mannequin Tony had a generic mannequin bulge instead of a penis and scrotum.  <br />
&quot;What the fuck!  They took you apart?!&quot;  <br />
He quickly inspected Tony's other parts to be sure they were him.  He quickly saw that they were all super detailed and jumped over to the pile of discarded mannequin parts.  He went through a half dozen limbs, chests and hips before he saw a hip bulb that had a perfectly detailed penis and scrotum in front.  He turned it around and saw a muscular rear, not the slack behind of the other mannequins.<br />
&quot;I got it&quot; he told Jeff.  &quot;I need another minute to put him together&quot;  Jeff listened to the voices from the changing rooms.  Jack had the clerk launching into a recitation of what the store would do for alterations.  Jeff nodded at Mark.  &quot;Quick!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark pulled off his brother's plastic legs and then the foreign hips.  He tossed the hips aside and then carefully reattached Tony's hip bulb and legs.  &quot;Okay!&quot; he whispered to Jeff and then jumped aside.  Jeff hit the 'enter' key.<br />
<br />
On the floor, looking up at the stained false ceiling, Tony felt the electric wave pass through him and his body steadily becoming heavier.  He felt the odd disconnections between arms, legs, head, chest bulb and hip bulb disappear.  Then, he could move, at first, it was just involuntary quivering as he transformed.  Then, his plastic shell reverted to skin and hair and he gasped and jumped to his feet.  He had just gotten to a kneeling position when he was hit in the face by the jeans and t-shirt tossed by Eric.  In a couple seconds, he had them on.  He looked at his familiar penis and sighed with relief before zipping them up and stepping out of the store room.<br />
<br />
He realized that his buddies had forgotten socks and shoes and made an effort to get behind the display where Jeff stood as the clerk returned with the pants Jack had tried on.  Jack shrugged apologetically two steps behind him.  The clerk looked right at Tony and walked into the store room to put the pants back on the mannequin.  All five boys broke into a race walk for the exit.  They heard the clerk snap &quot;Hey!&quot; in the store room and dart back out.  Tony looked back at him and the clerk stared dumbfounded at the living version of the mannequin walking away from him.  <br />
<br />
The guys quickly crossed the store to the exit with no particular attention paid to them until they were almost out the door.  The same out and proud supervisor that had seen Tony the day before stopped him at the 30 foot wide entrance.  <br />
&quot;How did you get in here without shoes on?&quot; he demanded, putting one hand on Tony's shoulder.<br />
&quot;I was the mannequin on the Dolce &amp; Gabbana display&quot; Tony explained.  &quot;The clerk took my shoes off to let someone else try my pants.  But I prefer these jeans&quot; he said and walked off as a befuddled supervisor stared after him.  <br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell happened to you?&quot; asked Mark<br />
&quot;I couldn't fit into the foufou pants they wanted to put on me so they switched by butt for another one&quot; explained Tony.<br />
<br />
Back at the store entrance, the clerk rushed up to the supervisor still staring.  <br />
&quot;That super lifelike mannequin's gone and there was a kid in here who looked just like him&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh, I'm gonna have to break out the good stuff tonight&quot; said the supervisor shaking his head.</p>
