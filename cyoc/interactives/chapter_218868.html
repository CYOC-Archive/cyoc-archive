<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">. . . Everyone that Michelle and Steve invited!<br />
<br />
In the front row were Emily, Ron, Rae, and Jason. Emily had black hair that flowed well past her modest B-cup breasts, and her hair also had golden highlights at the end. Her eyes were brown, and her sunglasses rested smoothly on her hair. She came from a Spanish family, so it shouldn’t be surprising that she would be a Latina. She also wore a white blouse that revealed a sun and a short oceanic blue skirt with gold flip-flops. Her boyfriend, Ron, had black hair that was put back in a pompadour, and his stubble was neatly shaved with a five-o&#39;clock shadow. He had charming blue eyes that could hypnotize any woman. As for his clothing, it consisted of a red Hawaiian shirt that suited perfectly, his blue shorts, and black casual shoes.<br />
<br />
Now for Rae: she was quite pretty with medium sunny blonde hair and blue eyes. Behind her hair was a pair of red earrings. Her bangs often liked to rest on her C-cup boobs as a plain white tank top covered them. She also had a cherry red skirt and light pink flip-flops. Her closest pal, Jason, had dirty blonde hair that was put in a bowl cut, and his eyes were basic black. His clothing included a black jacket with an ocean-blue shirt, navy pants, and black tennis shoes.<br />
<br />
Behind them were John, Rebecca, Jessica, Danielle, and Alicia. John, who was the last man of Michelle and Steve’s friends, had dark brown hair that was put back in an undercut. His eyes were oceanic blue, and in front of them was a pair of black glasses. His dress shirt was light blue while his pants were navy. Lastly, John wore a pair of brown dress shoes. His girlfriend was named Rebecca, who had short ginger hair and green eyes. She wore a mint blouse, which covered her B-cup breasts along with her bra, a white skirt, and a pair of light cyan chacos.<br />
<br />
Michelle and Steve were both getting close to finishing checking out their friends. Jessica had her dirty blonde hair put into two wavy twin pigtails, both of which had touched only her shoulders; her eyes were blue. She wore a violet crop top that covered her A-cup breasts; the latter part reveals that she has the smallest boobs of all the women. That resultingly got her being stuck as a virgin. Despite the news, however, she remained optimistic that there would be someone special for her. She also wore a light blue pair of jeans and black tennis shoes.<br />
<br />
Danielle is the second to last friend to go over. She had her brunette hair in two separate braids, and her eyes were hazel. A long-sleeved indigo hoodie covered her torso, half of her arms, and her C-cup boobs. She additionally had black pants and white shoes on too. Now, last but not least, Alicia–she is Danielle’s girlfriend, making both of them lesbians. Anyways, Alicia had wavy red hair that flowed past her D-cup breasts, and that easily made her the bustiest friend of Michelle and Steve. Alicia’s rose pink shirt showed a good V-neck while her black skirt had a pink stripe at the end. Finally, her black chacos revealed her toenails, which were painted pink to match her outfit. <br />
<br />
“Fantastic,” Michelle expressed, “everyone is here!”<br />
<br />
“You guys arrived much quicker than I expected,” Steve commented.<br />
<br />
“Well, hopefully, you’ve saved most of it for us,” Jessica said. <br />
<br />
“We’ve packed our stuff for this,” Ron added, “including all of our swimsuits.”<br />
<br />
“Then once you all get them on,” Michelle announced, “we will start the pool party!”<br />
<br />
“Sounds cool to me,” John replied.<br />
<br />
All nine of Michelle and Steve’s friends headed toward either the bathroom or the closet with all their beach gear inside their bags. When everyone gets out, they have all changed into their swimsuits. Alicia was in a hot pink bikini that showed off both her cleavage and her hourglass figure; her girlfriend, meanwhile, was in a purple two-piece swimsuit. Jessica had put on a light purple one-piece swimsuit, while Rebecca was wearing a green skirtini. The only thing John was currently wearing was a navy Speedo. Jason was in a pair of black swim trunks while Rae got on a red swim dress. Ron wore an unbuttoned blue swim shirt complete with a pair of dark blue swim trunks. Lastly, Emily wore a yellow tankini and a pair of sunglasses.<br />
<br />
“So now,” Steve asked, “are we ready?”<br />
<br />
“Of course, we are, amiga,” Emily answered.<br />
<br />
“Then what are we waiting for?” Michelle asked. “Let’s get this party started!”<br />
<br />
Everyone marched their way toward the pool, which had one flamingo, donut, and unicorn floaties. Music was playing in the room, and it was currently blasting “Best Day of My Life” by American Authors. The room also had cyan beach chairs, two on the left and right side and four on the front side. (Steve decorated the pool while Michelle checked out her and Steve’s friends.) However, if there was one thing that was oblivious to the nine friends, it’s that the pool water contained some of the lake water that Steve had dropped earlier from one of Michelle’s water bottles.<br />
<br />
“For the first five minutes,” Michelle announced while getting her feet in the pool, “feel free to do whatever you like! Games will be starting shortly!”<br />
<br />
“Alright!” Rae expressed. “It’s party time!”<br />
<br />
“Danielle and I will be resting in a beach chair if you need us,” Alicia informed.<br />
<br />
“So will I,” Jason also informed.<br />
<br />
“Steve and I will set our beach towels,” Michelle said.<br />
<br />
“Looks like it’s just the six of us in the pool, right?” Steve asked.<br />
<br />
“Yep, it sure does,” Jessica confirmed. “At least for the time being.”<br />
<br />
“Well then, the last one in the pool is a rotten egg,” Rebecca challenged.<br />
<br />
As soon as Rebecca did that, she, Ron, Emily, John, Jessica, and Rae all raced to the pool, trying their best to avoid being the loser.</p>
