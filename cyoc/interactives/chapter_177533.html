<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Hi everyone :) This is another story based off an idea that was sent to me. This is a bit of a dark one so here is your warning. And as usual, feel free to send me any good ideas if you want me to consider writing them. Anyway, I hope you enjoy this one and I&#39;ll see you next time!</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Ah! There you are! Come on Princess,”Vicky said as she gestured to the heavy fish tank in front of her, “come and say hello to Leia; my adorable pet pygmy shark!”<br />
<br />
At Vicky’s suggestion you nervously peered over her shoulder in order to get a better view of the next unfortunate individual that she wanted you to see. However, when you looked at the shark’s tank you immediately let out a whinny of pure horror. There, lining the walls of the water-filled container, were about 30 lifeless animal skeletons!<br />
<br />
Upon noticing your reaction, Vicky held the tank up so that you could get a closer look at the grim decorations surrounding it. You immediately started to feel sick as you watched the lifeless animals dangling from strings around the edge of the shark tank. And, as you heard the skeletons rattling occasionally whenever their bones collided, you started to get an eerie feeling that there was more to this grim display than met the eye.<br />
<br />
Added to this, you were also concerned when you noticed that there was quite a wide variety of animal skeletons arrayed before you. Most of these belonged to various kinds of small fish, but amongst these you spotted a few small crustaceans, amphibians and even mammals! Seeing all of this made a chill run up your spine as you suddenly considered that these deceased animals might once have been human beings just like you!<br />
<br />
You dwelled on this dark idea for only a short moment before the sound of Vicky’s voice knocked you back to reality. “Come on girl,” Vicky seemed to say to whatever poor creature lived inside this water-filled animal graveyard, “don’t you want to come out and say hi?” <br />
<br />
To your horror, as Vicky said this she grabbed the boney arm of what looked like a small lizard and started to move it backwards and forwards; clearly to make it look like the animal was waving as she pressed its lifeless skull right up against the glass wall of the shark’s tank. Witnessing this made you snort out again in disgust as you stomped your hooves noisily on the ground. However, Vicky didn’t seem to care as she parted the hanging skeletons like a set of grizzly curtains, which finally enabled you to see a slender black fish staring sadly back at you.<br />
<br />
“There you are!” Vicky said with a worrying amount of enthusiasm to the fish on the other side of the glass, “come and say hello to Princess, my newest broodmare. I’m sure the two of you will get along well with each other since you have so much in common. For starters, perhaps you can help Princess to appreciate her sexy new body. After all, you also know what it is like to have your masculinity taken away; isn’t that right ‘Lee?’”<br />
<br />
Hearing this made you snort again in shock. Not only was this fish once human, but she also used to be a man as well!? Surely this guy must have done something truly awful to deserve such a fate. However, you somehow doubted that this was really the case as you noted that Vicky and her family seemed to use any excuse to transform their victims. In any case, you did your best to brace yourself as Vicky prepared to tell the cruel tale of Leia’s transformation…<br />
<br />
“Where to begin?” Vicky said as she stroked her chin thoughtfully. “Well, ‘Lee’ here used to think of himself as being untouchable, what with a large, wealthy family and an inherited fortune right at his fingertips. However, when he tricked my father into buying some land that was essentially worthless, and then refused to undo the deal without a court order; that’s when we decided to teach Lee that he wouldn’t be able to rely on his family forever...”<br />
<br />
As Vicky said this she stroked over a few more of the animal skeletons dangling around the cage as she pressed a few of them against the glass and made their empty skulls stare at Leia creepily. Watching all of this made you feel sick as you now strongly suspected that the small shark was now looking at her deceased relatives as Vicky continued to play with their bony remains.<br />
<br />
“With this in mind,” Vicky said after a brief pause, “we turned the tables on Lee when we crashed his granddaughter’s wedding. Naturally, all of the family were present; which meant they were easy prey for us and a few of our friends from the Zoo. Ultimately, Lee became Leia; while the rest of her family joined her as small, worthless animals. And, as I’m sure you’ve guessed by now, Leia’s family are still with her to this day, though they aren’t quite as stuck-up and obnoxious as they used to be!”<br />
<br />
Hearing this made you grimace in disgust. You could only imagine what was running through the poor shark’s head as Vicky continued to play with her deceased family members. As with most of the residents of this evil ‘collection,’ Leia’s horrific punishment was nowhere near as bad as the crime she committed. Clearly, Vicky was mainly doing this for her own amusement, rather than out of concern for some stupid piece of land. However, knowing this didn’t make watching the performance any easier as Vicky smiled down at the mortified shark in front of her.<br />
<br />
“Now then,” Vicky continued excitedly, “today is the last day in Lee’s family history… well, on the human side anyway. Now, let me go and fetch the last of your useless relatives. Then, perhaps we shall see just how much help you get from those closest to you…”<br />
<br />
With that Vicky briefly headed over to the wall of stacked-up animals as she appeared to know what she was looking for. Meanwhile, the skeletons of Leia’s family now hid her from view as they formed an impenetrable boney curtain around her once again. Sadly, there was little you could do besides watching in silence as you waited nervously for Vicky to retrieve whatever animal she had set her sights on.<br />
<br />
Eventually, Vicky returned with an evil grin on her face. In her hand was a small goldfish, who was clearly terrified as she urgently flopped around and gasped for breath. Thankfully, Vicky did help the fish in this regard as she dunked her hand into Leia’s tank. However, you knew from experience that Vicky was up to something; and so, with a nervous couple of steps, you moved closer so that you could peer down into Leia’s watery prison…<br />
<br />
After looking inside the tank you whinnied out again and shook your head in dismay. This movement almost caused you to smash the tank as your long muzzle brushed against it. Thankfully the glass didn’t break, though you did feel a cold chill creep up your spine when you heard the bones of Leia’s family noisily rattling together as a result of the disturbance. However, this was all nothing compared to the horror of what was happening inside the tank itself. Now, the small goldfish was currently being used to humiliate Leia as Vicky pushed it against a distinctive slit on the shark’s underside. Clearly, this was Leia’s new shark sex; and Vicky seemed to want to explore it further as she pressed the helpless goldfish right up against it in a cruel act of pure humiliation.<br />
<br />
“Now then,” Vicky said as she rubbed the goldfish’s snout up and down over the length of Leia’s tight feminine slit, “I’m sure you remember your precious granddaughter Julia. I seem  to remember she looked stunning in her elegant wedding dress. Indeed, it was a shame to transform such a young beauty, but we decided that you would only learn your lesson if we were thorough in transforming all of your family. Happily though, I think this approach has worked wonders. Now, I think you realise that your family can’t solve all of life’s problems, though admittedly they can be useful in certain situations…”<br />
<br />
After Vicky said this, loud splashing sounds started to come from the fish tank as Leia began thrashing around violently in the water. However this only made Vicky laugh as she continued with the next stage of her sick act. Meanwhile, you could only stare in stunned silence as you watched the terrified goldfish in disgust; now that she was being forced inside her grandfather’s cloaca under Vicky’s cruel and sadistic guidance!<br />
<br />
“Mmmm, that’s it Leia,” Vicky said as she continued to work the goldfish around inside the small shark’s rubbery feminine slit, “you look like you’re starting to enjoy having your granddaughter stuffed inside that cute fishy cunt of yours.” Upon hearing this, the horrified shark seemed to redouble her efforts to escape as she splashed more water out of her tank with her frantic movements. However, Vicky managed to maintain a tight grip on both struggling fish as she forced them together in the most humiliating way possible.<br />
<br />
Despite how perverse this all was though, after a couple more minutes of this sick performance you couldn’t help noticing that the commotion in the water was beginning to die down. Now, Leia seemed to be floating limply in Vicky’s grip as the goldfish continued to rapidly pump in and out of her rubbery feminine folds. If anything, the look in the shark’s eyes now appeared to be one of excitement rather than disgust as she clearly started to get turned-on by this sick, yet surprisingly pleasurable act.<br />
<br />
Things continued like this for a short while longer before Leia finally seemed to reach some sort of climax. Upon sensing this, Vicky delivered a dozen more rapid thrusts as she shoved Leia’s granddaughter as deep into her fishy folds as she would go. Then, with an expression of relief on her slender black snout, Leia appeared to finally give in to her urges as she flapped her tail and climaxed around the goldfish’s scaly body.<br />
<br />
With the humiliating display now over, Vicky finally extracted Julia from her grandfather’s slick shark sex. As Vicky did this, you thought you saw several thin wispy trails of fluid flowing out of the shark’s orifice and around the goldfish herself. Clearly, Leia hadn’t been able to control her animalistic urges, despite knowing full-well that her pleasure was coming at her granddaughter’s expense. And now, as the two fish briefly exchanged a sad look with each other, you couldn’t help feeling bad for the pair of them as you knew that there was nothing you could do to help them.<br />
<br />
You continued to dwell on the harsh reality of the situation until you were interrupted by the sound of Vicky’s annoyingly upbeat voice: “well Leia, that sure looked like fun. Now, I’m sure you must be pretty drained after such a passionate reunion with your granddaughter, so perhaps a little… ‘nourishment’ will make you feel better?  After all, your past encounters with your family have always left you feeling rather ravenous; as I’m sure all of them can happily attest…”<br />
<br />
As Vicky said this she gestured to the skeletons hanging up around Leia’s tank. Seeing this made you whinny again in dismay as you think you understood what Vicky was hinting at. You seriously hoped you were wrong, but from the sounds of it Leia had been forcibly humiliated by each of her family members, before then being made to devour each of them in turn. The whole idea was unimaginably horrible, but something about Vicky’s attitude and body language told you that she wasn’t making any of this up. Now, Leia’s granddaughter was the only surviving member of her old human family; though you suspected that that might not be the case for much longer...<br />
<br />
Right on cue, Vicky firmly grabbed the struggling goldfish and pulled her back out of Leia’s tank. The frightened fish immediately began to panic as she started to suffocate outside of the water. However, Vicky simply smiled as she held the fish just above the shark’s snout, making sure the former-man had a good view as his last living relative struggled desperately to break free.   <br />
<br />
“What’s the matter dear?” Vicky said as she smiled down at the horrified shark beneath her, “don’t tell me you’ve lost your appetite? Just look at your worthless granddaughter and the rest of your pathetic family. Surely it would be better to put her out of her misery and let her join her other relatives, rather than to leave her lingering in a body and a life that she hates. Go on Leia, I know you are tempted…”<br />
<br />
As Vicky said this your mind continued to race. You looked at the small shark and were confused by her reaction. The pain in her large, beady eyes told you that she deeply hated this cruel situation she and her granddaughter now found themselves in. However, this disgust was joined by an expression of what looked like defeated acceptance as the shark appeared to relive all of the horrors that had been inflicted on her previously. With her mind clearly torn, Leia looked up at the struggling, gasping goldfish and just watched her for a few long, sullen moments. Then, to your absolute horror, Leia shut her eyes tightly before she slowly opened her jaws wide and swam up to meet her terrified, suffocating granddaughter!<br />
<br />
You snorted out again in dismay as Vicky smiled at the shark’s apparent surrender. Then, with no further fanfair, Vicky simply dropped the goldfish into Leia’s wide-open maw, before she clamped a hand over her snout to make sure that she followed through with her decision.<br />
<br />
Sadly, this only led to one outcome as, with a loud *gulp,* Leia finally spelled the end for both her granddaughter and her family line as she swallowed the fish down in one go.<br />
<br />
Nobody said a word for a few moments after this as the grim reality of the situation took a while to truly settle in. Vicky seemed satisfied with this reaction as she released the shark’s snout and pulled her hands back out of the water. Meanwhile, you and Leia remained silent as you struggled to digest, quite literally in the shark’s case, all that had just happened.<br />
<br />
Eventually though, Vicky did disturb this eerie silence when she went over to the wall and returned carrying another fish tank in her hands. Inside was another small black shark, who appeared to lack the same human awareness that Leia did. Clearly, this shark wasn’t there to be humiliated, which left you with a fairly good idea of what this newcomer would soon be used for…<br />
<br />
“Well,” Vicky said as she put the heavy fish tank down with a grunt, “that was quite the send-off for the last of your relatives. Don’t worry though, soon dear Julia will be hanging up with the rest of your family, after which the collection will be complete!”<br />
<br />
Leia was clearly mortified by this as she looked up at her tormentor with sad, bulging eyes. However, rather than protesting, the small shark simply swam to the bottom of her tank where she avoided making eye contact with you, Vicky, or any the lifeless skeletons being displayed around her. Clearly, she was too distraught to do anything as she simply moved around her tank in circles, probably praying that this nightmare would all be over soon.<br />
<br />
Sadly, Vicky was about to prove that the opposite was true as she picked up the second shark and brought it over to Leia’s tank. “Okay then Leia,” she said with a purr of amusement, “now that your old family is gone, I think it is time for you to start building your new one. I’m sure you remember Freddie here, though it has been a very long time since the two of you were last together. Happily, Freddie is now your permanent breeding partner, which means that you will quickly begin to replace that which you have lost. Oh... and by the looks of things Freddie intends to get started right away!”<br />
<br />
Leia briefly flinched upon hearing this before the male shark moved beside her. There was then a lot of commotion in the water as Leia appeared to resist the male’s advances. Sadly though, the ordeal involving her granddaughter quickly appeared to take its toll as Leia began to tire. Consequently, the female quickly started to get overpowered by the excited male as he appeared to start hunting for the same opening that Vicky had forced the goldfish into earlier. <br />
<br />
Eventually, the male did manage to find his mate’s sex as, with a sudden jerk, Leia appeared to go limp in defeated submission. Following on from this triumph, the male shark took full advantage as he pressed his own throbbing sex organ straight into the female’s exposed passage. This was when the mating truly began as the two sharks began to splash around in excitement, both now being guided by their powerful natural urge to reproduce.<br />
<br />
Vicky chuckled to herself as the two sharks remained locked together for a short while. The mating itself wasn’t too dramatic compared to that of other animals, but that didn’t seem to matter for the horrified female as her eyes darted around the room in excitement. Clearly Leia&#39;s own body was starting to work against her as, after a short while longer, it seemed that she was beginning to move in full harmony with her mate. Now you knew that it was only a matter of time before the excited couple finished their routine and released all of the passion that had been building over the past few minutes.<br />
<br />
Sure enough, the two sharks only lasted a little bit longer before they both shuddered together in satisfied relief. Predictably, this ended with the male shooting his load deep into Leia&#39;s cloaca; in response to which she simply shuddered in delight as an eruption of white, ropy cum started to seep into the water. Then, with his mission complete, the male swiftly separated before he started swimming around the tank; clearly in defence of his new, well-fertilised mate.<br />
<br />
With the mating now complete, Vicky finally seemed happy to end Leia’s story as she picked up her tank and began walking back towards the stacked-up animals that surrounded the room. Watching this made you shudder as the skeletons hanging up around the tank clattered together noisily with each step. However, Vicky didn’t seem particularly phased by this as she carefully lifted up the glass container and placed it back where she had retrieved it from.<br />
<br />
“Now then dear,” Vicky said to the female shark as she sat sadly at the bottom of her tank, “with Freddie in there with you I expect you’ll come to enjoy your new lifestyle. After all, you are now free to do whatever you want with your new mate. And if you are ever feeling down, just remember that your family will always be watching over you! Now Leia, I think I had better leave you and Freddie to it; after all, I think you two still have a lot more private time to spend together…”<br />
<br />
With that, Vicky blew Leia a kiss as she walked away. Meanwhile, you briefly noticed the male shark taking a renewed interest in his mate before Vicky drew your attention back to her as she started hunting for her next victim.<br />
<br />
Soon, after inspecting a few of the various cages and glass tanks, Vicky seemed to finally make her selection. Consequently, Vicky brought the animal over and placed it on the table in front of you.<br />
<br />
Then, you could only watch in stunned silence as Vicky reached into the animal’s container and introduced you to yet another one of her family’s unfortunate victims...</p>
