<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Luca looked up, having turned 6 shades of red, as Park gave him a wink.  As Jae approached Ty&#39;s side, he gave Park a bit of annoyed look.  &quot;Ty can you put the trunk so we drop our boards and bags there?&quot; Jae asked, and Ty responded by popping the trunk.  <br />
<br />
Once their bags and boards were in the trunk, they got in the back seat.  Luca buckled his seatbelt as Ty started the car.  The theater was about 15-20 min away depending on traffic.  Luca pretended to look out the window as the other three talked.  Park then asked Luca what he had thought of the area.  He turned around to answer where he saw Jae&#39;s head resting Park&#39;s lap, as he ran his hands through Jae&#39;s hair or on his arms or down his shirt.  Luca realized that these two were in love.  You could tell by the way they talked to each other, looked at each other and supportive they were, not to mention the public displays of affection.  It was evident that their love was deep.  For the first time, Luca started to realize that not only had his ex might have been wrong about high school relationships but that he and his ex had never had feelings for each other this way.  He wanted what they had.  He really wasnt sure what to do with Ty.  Ty was just not what he was used to.  He was nearly a foot taller and just so big thanks to his weight training and body building.<br />
<br />
Interrupting Luca&#39;s thoughts, Ty announced &quot;Alright we&#39;re here!&quot;  They made there way to the ticket counter.  After short debate, Jae bought Park&#39;s ticket.  Ty was right behind Jae and Park.  He bought both his and Luca&#39;s tickets.  &quot;Why did you buy my ticket?  I mean thank you but I  could have gotten it.&quot;<br />
Ty looked at Luca, grinning and replied &quot;Maybe its a reward for your awesome performance in Barcelona...maybe its a reward for how great you are doing in math since I started helping you..maybe its because I&#39;m just trying to be a nice guy and good friend..I aint sure yet.&quot;  They got to the concessions stand just as Jae and Park left with a huge popcorn and single large drink.  As Ty ordered a large popcorn and drink, Luca could have swore he saw Jae wink at Ty.  Luca got out his wallet to pay and Ty pushed it away.  &quot;This is on me.  You don&#39;t mind sharing do you?&quot;  Luca shook his head no.<br />
<br />
When they got inside the theater, Jae and Park sat halfway up in the middle.  Ty looked to Luca and asked &quot;You don&#39;t mind if we sit in the back row do you?  I prefer it because you can see everything and don&#39;t have to worry about people kicking your seat or talking behind you.&quot;  Luca didn&#39;t want to admit it but he loved the back row for pretty much the same reasons.  Although he was under the impression they would all be sitting together, he said &quot;Umm yeah sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
They got to their seats just as the previews started.  He rarely got to the movies but none of these previews impressed him.  The theater was practically empty, either because the movie had been out or a few weeks or the time of day.  When the movie started he realized it wasn&#39;t a superhero movie tat he thought they were seeing.  It was a horror movie.  Between school, gymnastics, competitions and homework, he really didn&#39;t have time to go to the movies.  But of all the genres, he hated horror movies.  Most of them scared the crap out of him.  So far the movie wasn&#39;t bad.  Then suddenly the killer ambushed one of the girls causing Luca to jump to the ceiling.  He grabbed Ty&#39;s arm, wrapping his arms around it tightly, burying his face into Ty&#39;s large biceps.  He whispered &quot;Tell me when its over!&quot;  Ty smiled a little, thinking how cute Luca was, even when scared.  Using his other arm, he reached over and ran his arm up and down Luca&#39;s back, trying to comfort him.  Ty then moved his coke from the armrest between them.  &quot;You are built like a brick wall!  I can&#39;t believe you&#39;re scared.  Im gonna need you to let go of my arm now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luca turned bright red and let go, jumping back to his seat, embarrassed.  He thought &quot;OMG!!  I cant believe I did that!  I just want to disappear!  I can never...&quot;  Before he could finish his thought, he felt Ty pull him close.  Ty had lifted the armrest that separated them so he could hold Luca.  Even though he was in no danger, he felt safe in Ty&#39;s arms.  He breathed Ty&#39;s scent in deeply.  The smell of his cologne and natural smell did something to soothe and stimulate his senses.  As he took another deep breath, his heart raced.  He leaned into Ty&#39;s embrace, resting his head on Ty&#39;s huge pecs.  He slowly intertwined his finger&#39;s with Ty&#39;s.  Ty moved his left arm, using his hand he gently tilted Luca&#39;s head up.  Ty always found Luca&#39;s eyes hypnotic as he looked into them, the light of the projector flickering in his eyes.  He decided to take a risk and go for it.  As Luca looked into Ty&#39;s eyes, he saw someone who he could easily fall in love with.  Then, in move completely uncharacteristic to Luca and a split second before Ty was going to, Luca pressed his lips against Ty&#39;s, closing his eyes.  As the continued to kiss, Luca&#39;s heart was racing, he was envisioning fireworks, he ran his hands his hands up and down Ty&#39;s strong arms.  He then felt Ty wrap both arms around him as he inserted his tongue into Luca&#39;s mouth.  Luca wrapped his arms around Ty&#39;s muscled back.  Ty pulled Luca on top of him as their kissing became more intense.  Luca felt a familiar tightness not only in his pants but he noticed a bulge forming in Ty&#39;s pants as well.  <br />
Suddenly the movie didn&#39;t matter.  Sure Ty had experience with guys, but they were all just sex.  Ty had wanted something real for some time.  As soon as he had saw Luca, the day they met, Ty developed a crush on Luca.  Unlike with previous guys, Ty took his time with Luca.  This was something he didn&#39;t want mess up, he had longed for real love forever and he didn&#39;t want to screw this up.    <br />
<br />
When the movie had ended, they met Jae and Park in the parking lot, looking a little disheveled, causing both to smile.  He asked what they thought of the movie, especially the final reveal.  Both Ty and Luca danced around the subject.  Jae immediately picked up what had finally happened and winked at Park.  He then pretended like something came up and they were meeting some people.  They grabbed to bags and boards and told Ty and Luca  that they would have to rain check dinner. They then skated off.<br />
<br />
&quot;What time do you need to be home sugar?&quot; Ty asked.<br />
&quot;Oh umm its Friday so normally 10, but my parents are out of town for the weekend and I don&#39;t have practice tomorrow, so I guess it doesn&#39;t matter..&quot; Luca paused, thinking about things and then added &quot;Do you want to come over?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah sure - I got no plans the today and aint gotta get up for training....so I guess I don&#39;t got a curfew.&quot;  Ty Smiled.<br />
They drove to Luca&#39;s house and, neither knowing how to talk about what happened in the movie theater, danced around it.  When they got to the house, Luca showed Ty in and said &quot;I noticed something.  Whenever we would all hang out here, you never came.  Well I guess now you have no excuse not to come&quot;  He smiled with a huge grin looking up to Ty, trying to hide his excitement</p>
