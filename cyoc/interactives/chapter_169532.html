<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With all of the cattle now securely held inside the holding pen, the farm workers began rushing around as if they were making frantic preparations for something. <br />
<br />
Jenkins struggled to see what was going on as he was bogged down amongst the mass of cow bodies. It was complete chaos inside the pen as the cows shifted around nervously and loudly bellowed out in fear or defiance.<br />
<br />
However, after a short while Jenkins saw that five-or-so of the cows that had been at the front of the pen were now being led out of the enclosure. They were guided through a narrow corridor of steel fence before they approached a series of smaller enclosures, all of which appeared to already have cows in them.<br />
<br />
Jenkins struggled to see clearly what was going amidst the mass of writhing bodies. However, a series of distressed moos and bellows suddenly erupted from some of the other cows inside the pen with him. <br />
<br />
When Jenkins did finally manage to get a good look at what was going on, he immediately understood what all the commotion was about.<br />
<br />
Even with his relatively bad bovine eyesight, Jenkins could clearly make out the silhouette of two cows; one mounting the other.<br />
<br />
Jenkins began to panic as the implications of this revelation sunk in. He knew he was doomed if he was fucked by a bull. What was going on?<br />
<br />
He knew that it was standard procedure amongst a handful of his old equestrian clients to breed all new arrivals, just to be certain that all of their transformations had been made permanent, but this practice was largely deemed unnecessary. More likely, the Zoo had figured out that he had snuck aboard the transport truck. All he knew for certain was that he had to get out of this damn pen! <br />
<br />
Jenkins fought his way to the back of the pen, hoping to buy himself as much time as possible. There wasn’t enough space in the cramped enclosure for him to get a run-up at the fence. Instead he used his body’s bulk to try and batter the fence down. The fence clanged loudly but didn’t seem to budge. He snorted in annoyance as he slammed against the fence again and again, each time no more successful than the last.<br />
<br />
Then a fresh wave of terrified mooing rang out, which Jenkins guessed signalled the departure of the next batch of cows as they were taken to be bred. This only served to alarm the doctor more. He joined in with the bellowing as he tried to dislodge a different section of the fence, but again there was no sign of it budging.<br />
<br />
After half an hour of trying, Jenkins was still trapped inside the holding pen. He had made his way around the whole perimeter, slamming and kicking in a desperate bid to get free. But the fence still stood strong, and Jenkins now felt exhausted and sore all over. The doctor despaired as he began to sense that it was hopeless.<br />
<br />
Then a familiar chorus of distressed mooing filled the enclosure again. Jenkins turned to see another batch of former-humans being taken away to begin their new lives as dairy cows. The holding pen had an eerie feel about it; now that fewer than a dozen cows were left of the original crowd.<br />
<br />
Jenkins didn’t want to give up, but he couldn’t think what else he could do with this cursed body. He tried to garner some sympathy by mooing softly to a couple of farmhands as they approached the enclosure; but sadly all they did was laugh and mock him. This reaction made Jenkins feel sick; surely they knew that he and the others were really human, and yet they were all being treated like common livestock.<br />
<br />
After a short while spent contemplating his cruel fate, Jenkins suddenly jumped when he felt a sharp jolt of electricity strike his ass. Startled, he turned to see a farmhand reaching over the fence with a long cattle prod.<br />
<br />
Outraged, Jenkins tried to charge at the annoying man. However, the farmhand saw this coming and stepped back from the fence. “Come on girl,” he mocked “you don’t want to keep that sexy bull waiting forever!”<br />
<br />
Jenkins bellowed out angrily, but it did nothing to deter the insistent farmhand. Soon, the man was joined by two more cattle prod-wielding colleagues, who now worked together to guide him towards the gate. Jenkins didn’t want to go, but the shock started to hurt on his sore, tired body.<br />
<br />
Eventually, Jenkins was moved outside the enclosure and was being funnelled towards the breeding pens at the other end. <br />
<br />
Jenkins mooed out in pain and defiance, but the constant shocks to his ass and flanks were becoming unbearable. Soon, despite his protests, Jenkins found himself being forced into one of the small breeding pens. There, waiting to greet him, was a large white bull; with what looked to be a feverish look in its eyes.<br />
<br />
Jenkins started to tremble as he looked at the beast in front of him, desperately trying not to think about what was about to happen…</p>
