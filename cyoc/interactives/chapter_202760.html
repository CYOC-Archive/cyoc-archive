<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You&#39;re doing much better, young Lightfoot,&quot; Mr. Shikamatsu spoke calmly and with some degree of pride.<br />
<br />
His clan and family had been pretty limited with regard to possible heirs before Animalia. He had his daughter Michiko, but given her mother&#39;s heart condition, there had been worries that Michiko might have inherited it, or the risk for it. It had been something that had always been in the back of his mind. But Animalia ultimately offered many new beginnings, and while he wasn&#39;t eager to become a Rabbit Animalian, when Yumi, Michiko&#39;s pet rabbit, was uplifted, the possibility of his wife regaining her health and vigor was enough for him. He loved his wife and family, and if his wife could be healthy again, Mr. Shikamatsu didn&#39;t care. Sure, Yumi&#39;s breed wasn&#39;t Japanese, but he&#39;d noted Michiko&#39;s happiness with the pet&#39;s active and friendly nature.<br />
<br />
Now, as Animalians, the Shikamatsu family had a future that Mr. Shikamatsu was happy for. His wife was happy and healthy, and the two of them could begin formal lessons for Animalia&#39;s members for health, self-discipline, and even self-defense purposes. Yumi and Michiko got along so well that he had declared Yumi an adoptive daughter and Michiko&#39;s sister. And now, Michiko had a boyfriend/bond mate that had been one of his most dedicated students and one of his most dedicated Human students. Most of his students often were Animalians or were quick to become Animalians. But Codey Lightfoot had stayed Human for years and remained dedicated, something Mr. Shikamatsu praised highly, and by the time of his Senior Year in high school, he&#39;d also begun to notice that Michiko seemed to take interest in him over some of the other uplifted Rabbit Animalians.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m still getting used to the feet,&quot; Codey answered a bit nervously, &quot;and a whole new center of balance.&quot;<br />
<br />
Codey then demonstrated that and nearly went over, but he did recover. He was glad to then see Mr. Shikamatsu smile and chuckle in response. He&#39;d stayed Human to prove he could learn and do things on his own and did not need to gain a massively over-muscled body to be good. He&#39;d loved his pet rabbit, Roger, like a brother after Roger was uplifted, and demanded his parents turn the guest room into Roger&#39;s room. They&#39;d obliged and he got to grow up with Roger as a brother, though he began to get jealous of Roger&#39;s love for Jessica Mariana and fearful that when they married, he&#39;d lose his brother. And until he&#39;d literally ran into Michiko at comic convention where she had been doing some business for her father&#39;s dojo in Animalia, he&#39;d never realized anyone was interested in him.<br />
<br />
They&#39;d soon began dating after that, and Michiko even came out to visit him at the college in Washington he was attending, and he got show her some of the sights to see there. Though, as time went by and things became gradually more and more serious, Codey also knew that if he were to stay with Michiko, he&#39;d HAVE to become a Rabbit Animalian and that brought out his own worries about whether or not he&#39;d be good enough for her and so on. It then led to him getting help from Roger with the idea on being ready for when that time came, particularly as some of Animalia&#39;s Rabbit Animalians were starting to discuss the &quot;Year of the Rabbit&quot; coming up in 2023. But it all seemed to work out, and he felt Roger and Jessica&#39;s advice helped as he thought back on that special date...<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;You didn&#39;t have to order an all-vegetarian meal on my account,&quot; Michiko said to him as they sat one of the restaurants in Animalia, &quot;you are presently Human.&quot;<br />
<br />
Codey gave a bit of a smile to Michiko and looked back to her bright eyes and presently relaxed ears.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... if we are to take the next step at some point, I&#39;d have to become a Rabbit Animalian,&quot; Codey answered, &quot;and you&#39;re special to me...&quot;<br />
<br />
His voice fell off a bit at the end, which made Michiko raise one eyebrow. It was true that he would have to become a Rabbit Animalian if they were to marry and have a family of their own, but she wanted to make sure Codey was ready for that. She hoped tonight would be the night, given that the number of times they&#39;d kissed had started to get more and more passionate on earlier dates. One of them even had Codey slightly fondle one breast through her dress and bra and her butt through her dress before he recognized what he was doing and backed away with an awkward apology that made Michiko giggle.<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean,&quot; Codey continued, &quot;up until now... I&#39;ve always been Human. I&#39;d seen myself as Human and that&#39;s what I&#39;d always thought I&#39;d be. And then Animalia came along, and many good things came with it. I gained a brother in Roger, your father established his dojo, and I got the chance to learn real martial arts, and then... perhaps the best of these... was then finding out you liked me. I mean, a lot of women really never had time for a guy that liked Power Rangers and martial arts and so on. And I could accept that... but then... you had interest in me, and... well... it means a lot. I want to show you I&#39;m worth the attention. That I would do anything for you... to make you happy... to be respectful to you... and...&quot;<br />
<br />
His voice fell off as Michiko reached over the table and took his hands in her own. Her short fur felt soft and the pads under her fingers were tender. Her brown eyes were captivating. Her black and white markings, while similar to Yumi and the other members of her family were also different from them, and it created the interest in her that had been growing over the years. He was more than happy to become a Rabbit Animalian for her and wanted to be able to make it special for her and in a way that wouldn&#39;t be bad. Which was in part why he&#39;d asked for help from Roger and Jessica, as he was sure they&#39;d been together and would have the right tips on how be good to Michiko. The one thing he hadn&#39;t figured out was in when and how to make the move to indicate that he was ready to become a Rabbit Animalian, for her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you too,&quot; Michiko said to him, &quot;and if you&#39;re serious about doing anything for me... there will be a special place to go AFTER dinner.&quot;<br />
<br />
Codey felt a lump form in his throat as his heart began to beat faster. There was a slight smile on Michiko&#39;s furred Lapine lips, which made him wonder if she&#39;d had something planned out already. It partially made him eager, and it partially made him nervous. He only smiled back and held her hands in his own and they ended up remaining that way until the server came with their salads, breadsticks, and butter for the bread. The server also commented the couple as looking cute before going about her work and left Codey and Michiko to eat. The two of them ate quietly, though Codey retained a sort of nervous optimism over what was coming. After they finished, Codey paid for the dinner and then went out... though from there, it was Michiko&#39;s turn to take the lead as she had picked Codey up for the date.<br />
<br />
&quot;Would you like something special?&quot; Michiko asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;To be with you? Yes,&quot; Codey said nervously, &quot;I mean... I don&#39;t want to force anything on you... but you are very beautiful and... I&#39;m.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You do not need to be nervous, Codey,&quot; Michiko spoke, &quot;as this would relate to your becoming an Animalian to be my bond-mate and in time, husband.  You&#39;ve already done a lot to make me happy and I love you for it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I would like something special,&quot; Codey managed a rather dopey grin, which got Michiko to gesture to the car and Codey then got into the passenger&#39;s seat.<br />
<br />
They then rode along until they came to Lover&#39;s Woods. The cabins were set up as part of an idea for honeymooning couples, particularly at a time when Animalia was getting started and many might not have the money for a more exotic location for their honeymoons. It then picked up added business with younger couples that might want to have &quot;fun&quot; but didn&#39;t want to disturb their parents and this was especially true if the Animalians were double dosed. Occasionally Humans with romantic partners that were Animalians converted here as well, if only because they didn&#39;t find the changing rooms at Horizon to be &quot;romantic,&quot; though after Heather&#39;s attack on Lyre High and rush to try and get to WSA, that became more difficult as Federal Laws were passed that made sure that all conversions were better regulated. Codey had filled out various paperwork to have things in order for when the &quot;time&quot; came, but he hadn&#39;t known on when that time would be. Though he noted that Michiko also skipped the registry office and parked in front of one of the cabins.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t we need to check in?&quot; Codey asked.<br />
<br />
Michiko lifted up her purse from the floor of the driver&#39;s side of the car and then produced a key from it and gave a smile, &quot;I already did... because I know I&#39;ve wanted something special with you. And with it now being summer, now is the time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Codey found himself smiling as he looked over to Michiko. She wore a red dress with a V-neck that showed the upper part of her generous white furred cleavage and he felt some stirring in his pants as he looked down to that. Like Yumi and her parents, Michiko&#39;s short fur was largely white but had various points that were black, including one spot around her left eye and her right ear. There was also dappling of small black spots on the top of her left breast, though some of them were covered by the strap for her dress. Codey also noted some differences that Michiko had from both Yumi and Roger and from Jessica.<br />
<br />
This had more to do with her eyes. Roger and Yumi, being pet rabbits that had been uplifted gained certain human-like features, but their eyes didn&#39;t change all that much. In this, Roger and Yumi both had more Lapine eyes even after uplifting, and the thing that really changed for them was their eyes moving more to the front to fit binocular vision that would mirror Human&#39;s vision. Jessica&#39;s and Michiko&#39;s respective conversions changed even less with regard to their eyes as they had both been Human before becoming Animalians. Though this also meant that Codey could tell Michiko&#39;s Japanese ancestry in that her eyes... or eyelids were not like Jessica&#39;s. For a moment it made him worry a bit about whether or not he would be accepted by her family.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve done a lot to set this up,&quot; Codey said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;With some help from mom and Yumi,&quot; Michiko smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your mom...&quot; Codey blinked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Michiko smiled, &quot;you have been father&#39;s most dedicated Human student here in Lyre/Animalia... far more so than even some of the Animalians, who the dojo was set up for. In this, my family knows your character, and they approve of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They don&#39;t mind me... not being Japanese?&quot; Codey asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course not,&quot; Michiko answered as she got out and walked around the car to help Codey out, pulling him into a hug as she did so, &quot;as America is full of people with mixed heritages. And as Animalians... many of those old things don&#39;t matter as much anymore. So do not worry. Are you ready to become a Rabbit Animalian?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And your bond-mate,&quot; Codey answered as he felt his erection growing and pressing against his underwear and pants in expectation of what was to follow.<br />
<br />
Michiko felt it pressing against her leg through her dress and smiled. She pivoted Codey away and then swatted the car door shut. The two of them then walked up to the cabin. Michiko then used the key to unlock the door and then ushered Codey in. Codey quietly looked it over as he entered. He flicked on a light to see that it did have windows, but for the moment the curtains were closed. There was a large bed with an end-table with a clock on it. There was a cabinet that had a mini fridge in it and on the other side of a set area for a bathroom. It&#39;s only when he heard the door shut that he turned. Michiko tossed her purse onto the cabinet and approached Codey as he turned to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve been waiting for a long time for this,&quot; Michiko smiled as she reached behind herself and pulled down on the zipper before letting the dress slide off of her.<br />
<br />
Codey&#39;s eyes practically bulged out of his head as the dress slid off her revealing the matching pink bra and panties and she approached. Swaying the generous hips that Animalian females had and with each step her generous breasts bounced with each step. He found himself getting more aroused and he couldn&#39;t hide that. The bigger fear was more that Michiko might find him &quot;too small&quot; and would turn away. But she kept coming closer to him and was soon pressing herself against him and nuzzling her muzzle to his cheeks.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m just hoping to prove pleasing,&quot; Codey managed as Michiko lead him to the bed.<br />
<br />
He then kissed her, though more from the sides of her muzzle than from the front. But it worked as Michiko nuzzled him back and sat him down on the bed while moving her hands to the bottom of his white polo shirt. She lifted it up and was reasonably pleased with Codey&#39;s appearance. Sure, most comparably sized Animalians might have more bulk muscle just by being Animalians, but Codey was still reasonably well muscled for a Human who hadn&#39;t done a lot of body building and fairly athletic and was something that she could easily respect. She smiled as she tossed his shirt onto the floor by her dress. She then did the same with his shoes and socks and Codey watched as they clattered to the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll be fine,&quot; Michiko assured him, &quot;some things may be awkward... for both of us, but then, love making can be like martial arts. One will get better with practice.&quot;<br />
<br />
Codey kissed her again, not minding that her fur and whiskers tickled his lips a little.  The pair of them slid onto their sides with Michiko&#39;s weight coming down on Codey&#39;s left arm as he reached around trying to undo her bra.  He also felt her hands moving down to undo his pants button and resulted them being in a sort of hug as Codey figured out the clasps on Michiko&#39;s bra. Michiko managed to beat him with regard to undoing his pants button and sliding them off his hips. He soon helped by trying to shake and kick them off in an up and down manner and it wasn&#39;t too long before his pants were kicked off onto the floor and Codey finally succeeded in undoing the clasps on Michiko&#39;s bra.<br />
<br />
He barely noticed how firm Michiko&#39;s breasts remained even after being freed from their fabric prison and as Codey tossed it toward the pile of clothing. The black spots were small and proved to only be on the upper portions of her breasts the rest was all white fur, with the exception of where her tan nipples were starting to poke through her fur as Codey then left a trail of soft kisses going down her neck and toward the tops of her breasts and largely trying to follow the suggestions that he&#39;d gotten from Roger and Jessica.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmm,&quot; Michiko gave a soft moan and bucked her hips forward a little and feeling the outline of Codey&#39;s erection through her panties and feeling kisses begin to trail onto the top of her bosom, &quot;that feels nice... but aren&#39;t you forgetting something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; Codey asked back. He didn&#39;t want to reveal that he&#39;d actually asked for help on basic &quot;how to do&quot; things when it came to sex, and while Michiko&#39;s line on practice helped his confidence a bit, as it indicated that Michiko might actually be as inexperienced with sex as he was, or at least understood the point on learning and thus might be more accepting of his inexperience, but he didn&#39;t necessarily want to expose how inexperienced he was.<br />
<br />
&quot;When mated partners have sex, they generally are not wearing their underwear,&quot; Michiko pointed out to how she was still in her panties and that Codey was still boxer-briefs.<br />
<br />
Codey only blushed at that point, though he wasn&#39;t sure if it was embarrassment or arousal. Michiko only giggled and reached one hand to pull down her panties and then lifting her legs to help get them off. She eventually dangled them from her feet while moving her hands back to massage the furred &quot;lower lips&quot; around her vagina. She could smell her growing arousal, and that had been there since the restaurant, as she&#39;d respected and had some interest in Codey since high school and that had only grown since they started dating. It was something about the person she&#39;d grown to love that went beyond physical looks, which was even better after a visit to Horizon to have the Animalia Virus in her reactivated. It was playing to some of her own fantasies that would relate to Codey becoming the best male Rabbit Animalian around, her mate. She then leaned up and to her side, feeling her breast nudge Codey&#39;s face as she then attended to Codey&#39;s underwear, and he complied by moving his legs to give her easier access to getting his underwear off.<br />
<br />
&quot;And... this... is...&quot; Michiko spoke and looked down to see Codey kissing at her breasts again while massaging the other gently. He hadn&#39;t gotten to her nipples, yet, but there was time for that. &quot;This is what we want.&quot;<br />
<br />
The last bit was more of a heavy moan as she finally got Codey&#39;s underwear off and revealing his erect penis. From what Michiko had read, it seemed to be about average in size, but she also knew that it would get bigger as he became a Rabbit Animalian. She rolled him onto his back, and she was soon sitting on his waist with penis being pinned between them.<br />
<br />
&quot;But wouldn&#39;t you want me to please you?&quot; Codey looked up to her and bit pinned. <br />
<br />
He shook for side to side a bit and that did move his erection across Michiko&#39;s vaginal lips, but the way Michiko was sitting it wouldn&#39;t any entrance as she was holding it down. She did moan a little, but there wasn&#39;t much more than that and it left Codey&#39;s mind wondering over the base tips that he&#39;d gotten and on wanting to be good to Michiko.<br />
<br />
&quot;But you have been pleasing,&quot; Michiko smiled and leaned forward a bit, feeling her breasts compress a bit against Codey&#39;s chest and reaching back with one hand to then lift and guide Codey&#39;s erection so that it would point into her vagina, &quot;you&#39;ve given me everything I could want in a person... made me wish to have you as my mate and I&#39;ve been waiting for this as long as you. Please...&quot;<br />
<br />
Codey blinked and smiled at this and figured this had to be where Jessica&#39;s comment of letting Michiko be assertive came into play and he then nodded, &quot;Okay... you know I&#39;m yours. If this way is how you want it... I&#39;ll... ohhhh....&quot;<br />
<br />
He ultimately wasn&#39;t able to finish as Michiko lowered herself onto erection, and this time in way that did let it slide into her. And while Codey figured he was smaller than pretty much every Animalian in terms of &quot;size,&quot; it wasn&#39;t exactly as though he was tiny. He could feel Michiko&#39;s vaginal walls grip his penis and it ultimately made him buck his hips forward, and faster than expected. There was a moment of resistance and Michiko gave an almost squeaking type of noise as she bounced on the initial thrust and then settled back down and taking him fully into her. She then smiled again and thrust her hips down and getting Codey to try and match her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry if that hurt...&quot; Codey began, though having to pause and moan as the room suddenly began to feel warmer.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; Michiko assured him, &quot;I&#39;ve been just as eager as you... and now things are going to get even better.&quot;<br />
<br />
And to a degree there had been a bit of pain, but as they began to build a bit of a rhythm of thrust and counter thrust, things began to feel better. She guided Codey&#39;s hands up to her breasts so that he could feel their weight and feel them bounce. It also let her observe his transformation, which was already beginning, and it was starting in all the right places as she could feel his penis swell in length and girth as they paired thrusts together. Codey&#39;s fur was also starting to come in with black ring around his nose and mouth with the rest being white. His ears were for the moment still on the sides of his head and hidden by his Human hair but that would soon change.<br />
<br />
The black and white coloration was to be expected, as Michiko had noted that she and her parents had both taken on Yumi&#39;s coloring and the thing that really differed them was where the markings were. As Codey&#39;s fur grew in across his improving musculature and frame, she noted that his chest was covered in fur as white as snow and the starting of black spotting really didn&#39;t appear until his shoulders and it deepened going down the arm until it got to his hands. And as short nubby claws grew from his fingertips and teased at her nipples it was like his hands were in black gloves that ended at the end of finger where white fur resumed. And Codey remained gentle and attentive. In fact, his care and soft manipulations of her breasts as they bounced helped ease some of the pain that came from the start of their mating.<br />
<br />
&quot;Michiko...&quot; Codey moaned, &quot;I... lll...lo...oovvvvv... uuuuuuuuu.&quot;<br />
<br />
The transformation really didn&#39;t hurt. And having Michiko there and having sex with her actually made it feel even better, particularly as her vagina was starting to feel tighter around his penis, but he couldn&#39;t change the fact that he was changing and that he could feel those changes and that some of them felt odd. Despite the sort of cracking sound as his feet lengthened into long digitigrade feet, which were largely white furred with the exception of the area round his ankles where there were a set of black spots that sort of banded together like a sock. There was also the odd feeling as his nose seemed to fade into his growing muzzle until the nostrils were just little slits above his mouth and feeling his new and larger incisors touch together, which then made it harder to moan out &quot;I love you.&quot; At the same time, his ears also felt like &quot;rubber.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; smiled Michiko as she could feel the pleasure building and building and looked down to him, &quot;my very handsome Rabbit...&quot;<br />
<br />
And as she looked to him and felt her first orgasm building, she could see her partner&#39;s transformation completing. His ears had grown out and stood erect through his hair. One was largely white furred with black spots while the other was black furred with white spots. She also noted that through his eyes that he was also getting close. She smiled and put her hands down to feel his now more muscular chest and was pleased with it as she felt her vagina begin to clinch on his penis.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you too,&quot; Michiko moaned out, &quot;let us... ohhhhh... let us... cum... tooooooooOOOOOOHHHHHH!&quot;<br />
<br />
The last bit was enough and was powerful to where Codey was actually able to lift Michiko up and let his new tail move a bit before he felt himself erupt inside her. As that then subsided, he lowered himself and Michiko let herself lay down on top of him and keeping him deep inside her.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was amazing... though... you probably know this already... but... it...&quot; Codey began, finding his voice was actually a bit deeper.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was your first time,&quot; Michiko smiled, &quot;mine, too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?!&quot; Codey gasped, &quot;but your family converted in Animalia&#39;s first year. You were all double dosed then.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Michiko smiled, &quot;and it led to a lot of desire... particularly as mother and father had a lot of the passion come back into their life. To hear them make love and knowing that Yumi and I were both straight... but they loved each other and that&#39;s always what I wanted. A loving partner. Not just a casual sex buddy. Which is why I was happy to attract your attention and win your heart. For it meant you meant more to me than what you&#39;ve now become.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you,&quot; Codey managed, &quot;though... I... think I&#39;m getting hard again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which means it&#39;s time for your second dose,&quot; Michiko smiled and nuzzled her muzzle to his.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
More love making followed that and the next morning Codey and Michiko had to go back into Horizon to make sure that the vaccination that prevented the Animalia Virus from being infective was handled. But that was still something that Codey wasn&#39;t going to brag about to Mr. Shikamatsu. Codey figured that he might accept Codey dating Michiko and probably marrying her once he got through college, but he didn&#39;t think that Mr. Shikamatsu would want details on Michiko&#39;s sexual adventures any more than Michiko wanted to know about her parents&#39; sexual adventures. This left Codey standing there, almost sheepishly as he stood before his bond-mate&#39;s father.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... as Rabbit Animalians, our feet and thus balance will be different from Humans,&quot; Mr. Shikamatsu said, &quot;but Humans are not the only beings with a plantigrade foot structure.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Codey nodded in agreement.<br />
<br />
&quot;But that isn&#39;t quite what I was referring to,&quot; Mr. Shikamatsu spoke, &quot;but more your focus...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; Codey managed, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, sir... it&#39;s just that I&#39;ve come to love Michiko very much and... it&#39;s let my mind wander a bit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Mr. Shikamatsu actually gave a smile, &quot;love can do that. Just remember to keep yourself focused on all that you do. Be it here with lessons, in college in the fall, or anywhere else. That will give you and Michiko many happy years together.&quot;<br />
<br />
Codey nodded in acceptance of that.</p>
