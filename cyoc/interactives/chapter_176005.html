<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Seeing his handsome face next to yours, you couldn&#39;t help yourself and lightly kiss him. Then again, and again, then this time turning his cheek to access his lips, and you kiss him another time. This time though, instead of recoiling, Adam actually seems to play along and you both begin making out. You can even feel his erection poking your ass too, so you know that he is seriously atteacted to you. <br />
<br />
The two of you continue kissing while he still plays with your breasts. You thought he would have stopped you by now, but guess not. So, you up the anti and turn around, puahing him down on the ground underneath you as you straddle him with your legs, all while still keeping your lips together. While he is distracted by your tongue entering his mouth, you slowly begin to unbutton his pants, slipping out his cock. Once it is out in the open, you slide down his body, and kiss it, before taking the tip of it into your mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, wait! Wait!&quot; Adam says as he pushes you off of his dick. <br />
<br />
&quot;Aw why? We were just getting to the fun part.&quot; You whined, actually rather disappointed that you couldn&#39;t finish sucking his dick.<br />
<br />
&quot;2 things. First, are you sure you want to go through with this?&quot; You nod. &quot;Ok. Then 2, if we hop that fence my place is literally right there&quot; Adam says, while pointing at an appartment complex. You get up off of him and help him up. Then you both make your way towards the short fense and he helps you over while you do the same. And after crossing the road, you reach his complex and enter his appartment on the 3rd floor. By the time you take your boots off, he already has his pants down and the door locked. With his arms open, you jump onto him, wrapping your arms and legs around him and continue making out while he carries you over to the couch.<br />
<br />
Adam sets you down and help pull off your clothes while kneeling over you. As is about to pull off your panties, you stop his hand and begin sucking his cock, placing his wandering hand on your head. You grab his waist and manage to flip over your positions so that you are once again on top, sorta. More like, between his legs while he is on his back. You could not believe how much you were enjoying having his dick in your mouth. You are literally sucking a cock and loving every second of it!<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy fuck dude, I am so pissed that you are not a girl. This is like, the best head I have ever gotten. You kept bobbing your head up and down until he tapped you on you head, trying to signal you that he is about to cum. However, instead of pulling off of him, you deep throat him as much as possible, until you can feel his seed spraying down your throat and the back of your mouth. You pull his cock out but then proceed to clean it off with your tongue and lips, making sure that not a single drop of his cum had escaped from entering your stomach. <br />
<br />
Finally the dick was all clean, so you let go of it. You look up at him, still feeling unsatisfied. &quot;Fuck it, I don&#39;t even care anymore&quot; you think to yourself as you pull down your panties. Adam went wide eyed when he saw it. &quot;Woah, hold on a minute. Since when have you been a woman? I&#39;ve seen your dick before man. So how, how do you have a pussy?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Does it really matter right now? All I am asking is if you got a condom, because I am not about to risk getting pregnant here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, condom, says Adam as he pulls out one from the end table drawer next to the couch. He hads it to you and you put it on him. Then slide down onto his cock with your pussy as you both begin the real fucking. <br />
<br />
5 or 6 used condoms later, and you both are exhausted. Looking out the window, you see that it is even dark outside now. While you are lying down on Adam&#39;s chest, he checks his phone. Damn girl, 5 straight hours is not bad for your first time. Its nearly 8pm already.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Haha. Sex. Is awesome!&quot; you pant while raising a fist in the air to the best you can. Once you both catch your breath, you both sit up on the couch, with Adam holding onto you. &quot;So, care to explain now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, but you must promise me that no matter what I say, nothing changes between us, ok?&quot; You ask hesitantly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean from how things are now between us, or how they were yesterday?&quot;<br />
<br />
You blush a bit. &quot;N-now would be preferable, if that is ok with you? And while we are on the subject. About the bet, look...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;We both tied, so the bet is nullified. And as punishment for ruining a bet, I propose we now have to be boyfriend and girlfriend for real instead of just pretending&quot; suggested Adam.<br />
<br />
&quot;I Agree, babe.&quot; You say as you kiss your now official boyfriend. &quot;And, as for what I am about to tell you...&quot; you go into the story about how you got the book because of work, all of your edits, etc. Adam just listened as you spoke, not saying a word. When you finished catching him up to speed, he let out a sigh. &quot;So what you are saying is that all of this happened from what originally was just you messing around with the universe? Fuck. And now you are my girlfriend, who the world still sees as a man. Hell, even I still think of you as one by default. No wonder you were so feminine. You have been a girl this entire time.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well actually I became a girl not even a full day ago, you likely just remember things differently though. Do you want me to fix that?&quot; offered Corinne.<br />
<br />
&quot;How so?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I could make people think I always have been a girl for starters. Then we can just go from there.&quot; You offered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine, but first change you make to us is that you up our endurance and stamina. We should be able to fuck non stop eithout issue, oh and make it so that you can just decide when to get pregnant. I want to be able to fuck you at anytime without needing a condom.&quot;</p>
