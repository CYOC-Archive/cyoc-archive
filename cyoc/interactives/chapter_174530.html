<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chris and Nancy continued staring at their reflections even after the changes had stopped. Chris found it hard to believe she was the brunette in the blue bra and boxer shorts. <br />
<br />
Tanya cleared her throat to get their attention and said ‘I think you two need to get dressed’ <br />
<br />
‘My clothes don’t fit me any more’ Chris replied.<br />
<br />
‘You need to wear Nancy’s clothes. As far as anyone else knows you are Nancy until we can change you back’ Tanya turned to Nancy ‘How about you start by swapping undies. Clearly your panties no longer work for you. Take them off’ Tanya could see the hesitation in the male Nancy. ‘I don’t know what you two are embarrassed about. It’s not as if you don’t know each other’s bodies. Chris will need the dress as well’<br />
<br />
Nancy reluctantly handed the dress to Tanya then turned around and faced the wall as he stepped out of the panties. Tanya picked up the panties and handed them and the dress to Chris. ‘Nancy will need the boxers’<br />
<br />
Chris hesitated a second before taking off the boxer shorts. Tanya handed them to Nancy. Both of the changelings quickly put on their gender appropriate underwear.<br />
<br />
Nancy had no trouble putting on the jeans and shirt Chris had been wearing but Chis needed Tanya’s assistance to do up the buttons on the blue dress she was being made to wear. The dress did nothing to hide her feminine shape.<br />
<br />
As Tanya did up the final buttons under Chris’s armpits Chris asked her. ‘So when were you going to tell me that it takes 12 hours before I could change back?’ Again she was surprised to hear Nancy’s voice come out of her mouth.<br />
<br />
‘I didn’t actually know it would work. Besides I thought you could just hide in your room if it did. Mum has an early start on Thursdays and Dad always has left before you get up. I would have had you back to yourself before they knew you were missing’<br />
<br />
Nancy interrupted the conversation ‘How do I get this thing to go down?’ He indicated his crotch where his penis was creating a large bulge.<br />
<br />
‘With difficulty’ Chris replied. ‘Try having a pee or think about your dog. If that doesn’t work you might have to have a wank’<br />
<br />
Tanya giggled ‘I never thought I would hear such language coming from Nancy’s mouth’<br />
<br />
A blushing Nancy left the room and headed to the nearby bathroom.<br />
 <br />
Chris continued to question Tanya ‘You said something about needing to do a couple of changes to create Mary earlier. What did you mean?’<br />
<br />
Now it was Tanya’s turn to look embarrassed. ‘I was thinking I could change you into a taller version of Mary. One who would help our basketball team. If Mary was your current height it would make our team almost unbeatable’<br />
<br />
‘But how would you do that? Mary isn’t this tall’<br />
<br />
‘Well I had Nancy bring over a pair of her extra tall pantyhose that were unworn. If what I read is correct a second change using them would have created a version of Mary that needed extra tall pantyhose’<br />
<br />
‘A second change?’<br />
<br />
‘Yeah. I figured to change you with the pantyhose as soon as the first 12 hours were up. That way by this time tomorrow night we would be able to change you back to yourself’<br />
<br />
‘So you always intended for me to be a girl for 24 hours?’<br />
<br />
Tanya blushed again ‘Sorry. I thought it was our best opportunity. I was just going to tell Mum that you, as in Chris, had gone on a date – which would have been the truth’<br />
<br />
‘Hang on. Are you saying I would have gone on my date with Nancy while in Mary’s body?’<br />
<br />
‘Well it wasn&#39;t me who organised your date for tomorrow night. I thought you would be going out on Saturday. I was just trying to think of a reason to explain Chris’s absence’<br />
<br />
‘How much more aren’t you telling me? I agreed to help out your basketball team! I didn’t agree to being a girl for days at a time!’<br />
<br />
‘Shush. Quiet. If you keep yelling like that Mum will be up here to see what we are arguing about. You wouldn’t want her to overhear us. That reminds me, I think I should call you Nancy while you are in that body’ <br />
<br />
‘I suppose’<br />
<br />
‘You’re Nancy, Nancy Spencer. I knew you always wanted to get into her knickers. I just didn’t expect you to literally do it’<br />
<br />
‘Not funny Tanya’<br />
<br />
‘Anyway I now have a problem. I was thinking the next 24 hours was my best chance to create tall Mary. You play your own basketball on Friday and then you have your job on Saturday. I guess Mary will just have to be short’<br />
<br />
‘Not necessarily. Why can’t you become Mary? When Mum gets home tomorrow I can tell her that you have gone shopping with Nancy’<br />
<br />
Tanya thought about it ‘I guess so. I’ll just stay in my room until Mum and Dad have gone tomorrow morning. It’s the same as I imagined it’s just I would be Mary rather than you’<br />
<br />
‘I think it’s only fair. If I and Nancy need to be someone else. Why not you as well?’<br />
<br />
‘I guess so’<br />
<br />
‘Where is Nancy by the way?’ asked Chris<br />
<br />
‘She went to the bathroom. You did suggest she go and have a wank. I guess that’s what she is up to. I’m not going to interrupt her’<br />
<br />
‘Well why don’t you begin your change. I want to watch. We can surprise Nancy when she returns’<br />
<br />
Tanya didn’t want to admit to Chris that she was nervous about changing herself. She was the only one who had read the stories about things going wrong when the Medallion of Zulo was used. However the look on Chris’s feminine face told Tanya she was not going to be able to back out of this.</p>
