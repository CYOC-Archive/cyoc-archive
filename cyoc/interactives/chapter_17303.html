<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The trials of the past few days had me totally wiped out. I sat in my judges chair at my desk, its a place where I can relax the best and offers one a quiet place to think.<br />
<br />
Thinking and wondering just how we were able to get Cindy back to being human was to me a mircle. I can still see her straining like some captured wild beast as she lay there tied to her bed. Her legs, those goatish hairy legs and hooves, they strained those nylon ropes to the breakingpoint.<br />
<br />
I went along with what Joan had said would be a correct method of returning Cindy to her former self, and crazy as it seemed it worked!<br />
<br />
Wondering to this day but as I relaxed some in that nice overstuffed chair the thought of those specticles in my shirt pocket came to mind. Sitting up quickly I reached into my pocket and removed them with two finger clenched about those golden frames.<br />
<br />
Unfolding the bows I thought to put them on and see what all the others had seen, this time with my own ideas of the future and past.<br />
Slowly they were slipped over the bridge of my nose. Like a cloudy set of images floated before me even though I could still see the room around me as if looking through common glass lenses.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me see what life was like in the early 1800's!&quot; I said as if that would make the spirit in the glasses obey.<br />
<br />
The cloudy images began to move about taking firm shapes as the sight of the room around me dimmed that which I saw in the glasses became vivid of colors. As I sat there the spirit spoke to me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stand up, stand up it is for your safety to which I say stand up!&quot; said a clear and perfect pronunciated voice.<br />
<br />
I pushed the chair back and stood up, doing what the voice told me less I find myself having some horrid problem too! Even as I stood up there was in my view through the glasses around me many large trees, a forest. Turning my head from side to side I looked about.<br />
<br />
&quot;Slowly and with caution step to paces to the side, beware not to remove the glasses!&quot; said that voice but this time it spoke with authority as if something was wrong.<br />
<br />
Doing as told since I had no reason this spirit was there to injure me personally, I stepped sideways two steps. In so doing the images around me became crystal clear like you could reach out and touch them with a hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;What was wrong, spirit?&quot; I asked of it as he must of had a reason for what I was told to do.<br />
<br />
&quot;The place to where your were sitting and then stood was years ago inside the trunk of a tree. Had the glasses fallen off you would have become a part of history and also a part of that tree. Now you stand beside it and can look around with ease. Do beware that you do not removes the glasses till requesting of this spirit to return your visionary self to the present. In recent days you have seen some of the trouble which can befall one for becoming part of history.&quot; said the voice.<br />
<br />
I stood there looking about but that which was there more than a hundred and seventy years ago was a thick forest of trees. As there was nothing moving there and only large trees it felt like my vision was safe to relax and ask some questions about this phenomena.<br />
<br />
&quot;May I ask, how far back you can take me in time?&quot; I asked of the spirit.<br />
<br />
Its reply was quick to come,&quot;Time is as a river and with looking back the numbers of events makes it from a wandering stream, to a torent which one can not break free. If per chance you wandered back some thousands of years you could be swept way, never to be seen again. It is suggested to look back only a century or three less the current may take you whether you wish it or not.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What of those who lost themselves into either being a part of history   or being brought back with their physical selves different, like Ellen, or Cindy?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
Again its reply came back quickly, &quot;As in either situation, the viewer reached out from their place in time to that of another. They touched  that of another time which had in it life, be it plant or animal the factor is one of entering the space time placement of another life. It is a possible situation which for either life could have reknown effects. Effects such as transending one's mental pattern from one body to another and in such echange places, bodies, and lives lived. The tragic part of this all happens when by whatever means the glasses become dislodged or removed from the face of the viewer. This constitutes the crux to both Cindy and Ellen and many, mnay others since I and these specticles began. A pattern of use and discontinuance of use must be followed to the letter or abnormalities can arise. The death in her time of Ellen occured as her mental patterns, soul or spirit if you will became trapped into a life in the rivers of time. Being that one's spirit and with it those mental learned patterns of ones life bear no actual weight or real mass, they are easily and with great speed torn from their time and taken by the current of time to where they place and touching of two lives occured.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This was not something easy to comprehend!&quot; I stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;NO, what constitutes my beinging and from the beginning of my spirit was not something easily created! I have been deemed a purpose and set forth that those of learned ways might understand my purpose and thus use me with wisdom. There have been many who saw me as something of humor and did toy with these powers till they and even others with them were swept into past or futures undesired.&quot; exclaimed the voice of that spirit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Others, how would one take more than himself who is wearing the specticles to be drawn into either past or future?&quot; I asked rolling with the conversation.<br />
<br />
&quot;It stems from people seeing this as a toy or plaything making of humor and happiness. I and my purpose in none of that, like a young and foolish Prince Beckworth who toyed with the specticles during a party he held in 1813. His castle was once nothing more than a simple farm and lands, pastures, some fifty years before he was born. He showed the specticles around during a party, giving them to his lady friend to see the past. She seeing what was there in that spot so many years before did scream out. She was quickly surrounded by dozens of well wishing people all pressing together to see why she screamed. The lady saw there a herd of swine and as she saw them milling about her feet she did scream. As she saw those swine, was in physcial contact with them milling about her feet, another jealous lady removed the glasses for a look. In the blink of one's eye they entire lot of lordly people died in a huge pile of flesh. In that same second those souls and mental thought patterns merged with the many swine hogs to live out their lives as swine. The screams of those swine humans still rings true in my memory as one moment this spirit will never be allowed to forget.&quot; did say the spirit as I stood listening.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can understand your feeling remorse over your purpose being so perverse and causing the needless deaths like that!&quot; I said as if my puny thoughts could console anything to this spirit. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yet, what of Cindy in her half goat form and the rape of Connie her friend, is this still something which was and then by going back and stopping Cindy's fall, is not Connie free of her rape memories?' asked me of the spirit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Time is as I have said is like a river and the episode of Cindy the goat having raped a girl is still like a eddie or backwater of some event in time. If she be pregnant of the rape then what was placed in her will live too. It was fortunate for Cindy she had two loving persons who took the trouble to take her back and free her from the infection which was within her body.&quot; said the spirit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Infection, she was changed like you said in the blink of an eye to part male goat and human female!&quot; said I.<br />
<br />
&quot;NO, nay my dear sir it was more, much more, it was an infection of both spirit and body. Her DNA, deoxyribonucleic acid as it was named, is a phenomenally complex molecule found in the chromosomes of all life forms. Put very crudely, it's a chemical code that defines a life one's physical form. Cindy was infected to her sub-atomic level by the DNA of the goat. It was her human body which was to mutate, accepting that DNA pattern of the billy goat as being the stronger of the two. She would in a short space of time become in her time a male goat with thought processes simular to the goat she touched back in his time. Her ultimate rape of the friend Connie would and may have infected her in something simular to her own from of DNA mutating override making in time yet another goat of a young girl.&quot; explained the spirit as I yawned and got tired of the long drawn out conversation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Spirit can I take off the glasses now?&quot; I asked in foolishness.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nay there Sir, step back two side paces to where thee stood when placing them on one's face!&quot; ordered the spirit of me.<br />
<br />
I did as asked and then stood with them still in place so as to be told when such time was proper to remove them. &quot;How about now, ok to remove the specticles?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now is proper as where you stood was unseen to you a snail on your shoe. Had you removed the glasses your death would have occured and a snail would be some many years dead!&quot; the spirit said as I breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
