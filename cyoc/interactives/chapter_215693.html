<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">For a moment, everything was good. Bill felt his body flush with warmth as he pressed his lips against Matt&#39;s, his eyes closed as his curly brown hair fell across his face, oblivious to the wide, surprised dark eyes of Matt just centimeters away.. She he couldn&#39;t have asked for a more romantic moment than this as dreamy thoughts, satisfying thoughts, filled his head.<br />
<br />
That&#39;s when he felt an arm snake around his waist and a hand settle on his prominent rear. He felt it squeeze. His eyes snapped open and one though pulsed through his mind: He was KISSING MATT HARRIS.<br />
<br />
&quot;OH FUCK&quot; Bill screamed, his tiny, slender hands flying upwards and pressing HARD against Matt&#39;s chest, the greasy haired teen given a confused grunt and then a moan of pain as he flew backwards out of the swing and down into the wet grass.<br />
<br />
&quot;NOPE NOPE FUCK NOPE FUCK FUCK FUCK!&quot; Bill screeched as he shot out of his own swing and took off across the small park as his brain proceeded to short circuit. He had to get away from here, he had get back to being a man, he DID NOT like boys and he was NOT this...this easily woo&#39;d girl! Why didn&#39;t he stop himself? Why was had he started acting like that? Why the HELL did he KISS Matt? And where the FUCK was Eve!?<br />
<br />
Bill heard Matt&#39;s voice call out behind him but he didn&#39;t dare look back as he struggled to keep his new balance, his brain&#39;s Red Alert overriding whatever the FUCK had just come over him. He couldn&#39;t wait anymore, maybe if he just ran he&#39;d see Eve along the way and-<br />
<br />
A short honk from his left caused Bill&#39;s head to snap in that direction...Just as Bill was needing to dodge a bench. He shrieked in pain and surprise as he collided with it, the two blinding lights in front of him illuminating the, had it not happened to him, must have looked quite comical. He kept his new body from flipping over the back of the bench, but the pain of the impact radiated through his body as he tried to peel himself off the treated lumber. He lay there for a moment in the blinding light just trying to recover, a heap of (mostly ass) flesh that was deeply, deeply regretting it&#39;s choices.<br />
<br />
But then Bill heard it, a voice so high and sweet and sexy all at the same time as the lights flicked off and the shadows encroached on the Josiah Memorial Park once more, now lit only by the handful of decorative lamps like the one next to the bench that Bill was slowly peeling himself off of.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohmygod, Willow! Willow are you okay!?&quot; Eve&#39;s voice called out through the darkness, followed by the thud of a car door and the muffled sounds of feet padding across the grass. And then like a red headed, Eve&#39;s curvy, perfect body appeared in the dim light and reached out with a pair of hands that were only slightly larger than the transformed geek&#39;s current phalanges and placed them softly but firmly on Bill&#39;s rounded shoulders. Large, green eyes on a masterfully sculpted face and a plump pair of lips (not to mention the not insignificant breasts that pushed through an outfit that most certainly hadn&#39;t been picked for being sneaky and stealthy.<br />
<br />
Like Bill wasn&#39;t so masculine (especially at the moment) that he thought of pink as a &#39;girly&#39; color, but a pink hoodie, pink and white leggings AND pink shoes? And...A pink Scrunchie? And didn&#39;t Even drive a pink car? Yeesh. At least she was a little more fashionable during school hours, but it was clear that Eve was a &#39;pink lady&#39;.<br />
<br />
&quot;EVE!&quot; Bill croaked, though in WIllow&#39;s voice it sounded more like a whine, &quot;Oh god, I KISSED A BOY! I KISSED MATT!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I saw! Not gonna lie, it was kind of cute! But are you okay? You hit the bench pretty hard...&quot; Eve didn&#39;t seem to wait for an invitation as she began slowly twisting and turning Bill around in a lazy circle, her piercing green eyes scanning up and down before her firm hands began squeezing up and down Willow&#39;s scrawny arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, wha-what are you doing?&quot; Bill asked as he pawed uselessly at Eve&#39;s determined hands. They didn&#39;t have time for this, he was fine, they had to wish back before-<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m just doing a first aid check&quot; Eve said curtly as she gently flexed one of Willow&#39;s resistant arms outward. In truth Eve Eugene otherwise didn&#39;t really know what he was doing, but the growing part of his mind that was this practically perfect girl he&#39;d become had assumed command. Like, ENTIRELY seized command. The part of Eugene was still Eugene could only, for the moment, go along with the ride.<br />
<br />
The moment Willow had collided with the bench he&#39;d grabbed the strange wishing rock and SHE had lurched up out of the car, the artifact curled in her pinky and ring finger It wasn&#39;t truly important right now, the poor girl in front of her was hurt! And the knowledge of how to check for broken bones and fractures came to her easily, after all what kind of cheer captain wouldn&#39;t know how to apply first aid to one of her beloved (except for Gloria) squad-mates? *Plus she was secretly enthused to finally put some of her nurse training to good use, having done a school-work internship at the local clinic through the advanced placement courses last year after all she wasn&#39;t certain if she wanted to be a nurse (maybe a doctor) but it helped to have a diversified skillset when-*<br />
<br />
&quot;Let go!&quot; Bill yelled, finally squirming out of Eve&#39;s grasping, searching fingers and dancing to the other side of the park bench. He heard the muffled thuds of more footfalls on wet grass and he turned his curly head to see Matt making his way over to them.<br />
<br />
&#39;Oh god&#39; Bill thought as a shiver ran down his spine, &quot;Eve, I-&quot;<br />
<br />
What Bill wasn&#39;t expecting, however, were for those caring green eyes to glitter with indignation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Willow, you HAVE to let me check you first! You could have a concussion, or something might be broken!&quot; Eve&#39;s voice was full of concern, but there was an edge to it. She started around the bench, tiny feet moving WAY too fast for Bill&#39;s liking.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m FINE! SEE!?&quot; Bill danced around the other side of the bench, his eyes flashing back and forth between the frightfully determined cheerleader and the approaching form of Matt. And there it was again, that...meekness that had muzzled Bill&#39;s free will. A growing part of him wanted to run over to the boy and apologize profusely and ask if he still l-<br />
<br />
&#39;NO NO NO!&#39; Bill said, grunted, a tiny fist banging the curly locks of his head in frustration.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohmygawd I knew it!&quot; Eve cried out again, &quot;You have a concussion! You need to-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I NEED YOU TO STOP BEING WEIRD, AND LET ME HAVE THE FUCKING STONE, EVE!&quot; Bill screamed back, and in one of the apartments across the street a light flicked on, &quot;God, I can&#39;t deal with being like this anymore! I&#39;m not little miss perfect like you are!&quot;<br />
<br />
Eve stopped in her tracks and Bill felt a surge of victory swell beneath the two small peaks that rested beneath the sweatshirt, but was so short lived that it may as well not even tried showing up at all once Bill saw the look on Eve&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
&quot;How DARE you, you little...You little bitch! I go through all that effort to find you, get out in the cold and waste gas to come here and...and...And I TRY to be nice and help you when you clearly need help and you think you can just call me THAT!? You clearly MUST have a concussion or brain damage or SOMETHING that tells you to run from the people that help you!<br />
<br />
A flash of light in one of Eve&#39;s hands caught Bill&#39;s eye and terror gripped his heart. &quot;EVE WAI-&quot; he yelled, but it was no use. Whatever was happening now couldn&#39;t be stopped, he&#39;d seen that look in Tom&#39;s eyes when he&#39;d started getting irrationally angry about something Gloria had done to him. The only way to get through to him was to let him ride it out. But of course, Tom never had a magical, reality altering wishing rock.<br />
<br />
Bill tensed his aching muscles and prepared to try to tackle Eve, but it was too late as...<br />
<br />
&quot;I WISH YOU&#39;D-&quot; Eve screeched into the darkness as...</p>
