<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was a pleasant few hours for Leon Talbot. In bed with his wife Regina after seeing her in her sexy black negligée; Leon had a delightful time in removing it from her and growling as he watched Regina shift into her were-lioness fursona. Running his paws all over her fur as she enjoyed ruffling his furry mane; both were-lions flailing their tails about in pure pleasure.<br />
“Come now husband,” Regina playfully teasing; “I won’t bite. Hard,” Regina chuckling.<br />
<br />
Roaring in abject pleasure as he guided Regina to lay on the bed; staring at the willing feline below him as she mewled and murred, waiting for him to rut her. The wait wasn’t long as he guided his throbbing feline member into her snatch. Both growl in unison as they begin thrusting and gyrating; the bed creaking and groaning as they made love staring into each other’s leonine eyes. The intimate pleasure the two felt, caused both to purr as each climaxed shortly after they engaged in their respective love making.<br />
<br />
“Pleasant as that was,” Regina purring; “I want you to take me properly.”<br />
“Not until I have explored you,” Leon rumbling; stroking Regina’s head with his paw; “I want to make this moment last. And,” Leon pulling is barbed cock out; causing Regina to gasp as the barbs dig in give her another orgasm; “I want to ensure you are properly satisfied with the way the day has gone.”<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
For Regina; taking her properly, was being mounted and rutted from behind. The feeling of a large male on top and dominating as her sex was pounded senseless was what made her feel satisfied. A position Leon was more than willing to get behind as he watched his wife roll over and get on all fours, exposing her sex as her tail flicks about.<br />
<br />
That was a good hour ago and Leon was still happily rutting with his wife. The two roaring as both climaxed; Leon acting like a pure savage as he had his claws dug into Regina, unintentionally drawing blood. Regina ignored the pain as she reveled in the orgasmic bliss she was in. The magical moment however was cut short as a phone rings and Leon growling as he swears; having to get up and answer it.<br />
<br />
“This better be good,” Leon growling; “I was in the middle of something.”<br />
“I wouldn’t call if it wasn’t important,” Regina hearing that it was Leon’s younger brother; “we’ve had eyes on Frederick ever since he pitched his tents.”<br />
“Get on with it Simon,” Leon snarling; “Regina and I were currently…”<br />
“Frederick is planning on breaking his son out Tomorrow morning,” Simon interrupting his brother; “he has more men on the way as we speak.”<br />
“NOT IF I HAVE ANY SAY,” Leon roaring mad; “Daniel Parker stays right where he is.”<br />
“A simple solution would be to deal with the remaining men,” Simon speaking; “my youngest son watched Freddie get drunk. We can do to him what we just did to two of them earlier and are about to do with the two more we just snatched.”<br />
“No,” Leon growling; “I have a better ideal. Tip of the police about the planned jail break. In the meantime, pick off the rest of Frederick’s men; I want him to wake up in the morning alone.”<br />
“Okay,” Simon speaking but Leon just hangs up the phone and growls angrily.<br />
<br />
“Regina,” Leon flexing his claws menacingly; “I have to go out now. There is something I must make sure doesn’t happen.”<br />
“Don’t Leon,” Regina looking at her husband; “stay here and let the police deal with Freddie’s backup.”<br />
“I’m not helping the sheriff fight off a bunch of mooks,” Leon getting up; “I’m going to make sure Daniel Parker doesn’t leave his cell.”<br />
“That sounds like helping the sheriff,” Regina looking at her husband defur and getting dressed; “you know Sheriff Cooper will not be pleased to see you.”<br />
“I don’t care,” Leon growling; “I’m going to go over there.”<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
“Okay you two,” Sheriff Cooper looking at Eugene and Agent Reed; “Daniel is in the trunk of your cruiser. The moment you are certain you are not being followed I want you to pull over and drag him out and toss him in the back seat.”<br />
<br />
After hemming and hawing for a few minutes at Eugene’s ideal of posing Agent Reed as a prisoner being transported. A ruse to trick anyone in thinking that Daniel Parker is still in town; Sheriff Cooper relented and eventually helped with the plan.<br />
“We know of the plan,” Eugene in his state trooper uniform; “if all goes well, we will be in Seattle in a few hours.”<br />
“We’ll call you,” Agent Reed speaking; sitting in the backseat posing as a prisoner in transport.<br />
<br />
Sheriff Cooper watches as the two drive off; sighing as he walked back inside only to see Leon Talbot making a scene at the front desk.<br />
“Let me speak to the sheriff,” Leon growling or I’ll knock you on your ass or worse.”<br />
“That’s it,” the deputy snarling as he pulled out a gun; “your under arrest for threatening an officer.”<br />
“Hold on there,” Sheriff Cooper approaching; “let’s not risk sending half the department to the emergency room just to try and detain a were-lion.”<br />
“But he threatened me,” the deputy looking at the sheriff.<br />
“And I will handle it,” Douglas grinning; “handle it I will.”<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
In Sheriff Cooper’s office stood Leon Talbot as the Sheriff in his were-grizzly fursona was growling at him. The large claws at the end of Cooper’s paws were something that Leon was not keen on having to defend himself with as he scoffed at the Sheriff for what he just said earlier.<br />
“You have to be joking,” Leon looking at the were-grizzly; “you want to deputize me?”<br />
“It’s either that,” Sheriff Cooper growling; “or you spend the night in jail for threatening the deputy.”<br />
“And you thought by shifting into your fursona,” Leon looking tense; “would convince me to say some oath?”<br />
“Nope,” Sheriff Cooper answering; “I shifted so you wouldn’t try to explode and attack me when I tell you this.” Sheriff Cooper glares at Leon; “as you were bickering with my deputy earlier, I had your nephew Eugene transport Daniel Parker to Seattle. Along with special agent Brooke Reed,” Sheriff Cooper watching as Leon starts to get mad; “When Frederick and his men try and break in to bust out Daniel, all they’ll get is a full contingent of deputies waiting to arrest them.”<br />
<br />
Red with rage; Leon roars as he shifts into his were-lion fursona. Lunging at the sheriff after hearing what just happened; Leon soon finds himself tooth and claw with a large were-grizzly tossing him about like a rag doll.<br />
“Eugene told me about what Regina requested,” Cooper snarling as he continued his assault; “attacking Frederick’s men! Dropping them in the middle of the woods near the border naked! Amusing as that is,” Douglas Cooper roaring; “it’s kidnapping and assault.”<br />
<br />
Sheriff Cooper blocking Leon’s wild savage strike as the were-lion blinded with rage tries to defend himself.<br />
“I was about to have hot sex with a were-tigress I’ve fallen in love with,” Douglas grabbing the were-lion and tossing him through a wall landing into the next room; “that isn’t happening tonight. Despite the were-wedding we just had. I have to deal with this bullshit between you and Frederick Parker,” Douglas pulling up a dazed Leon and throwing him onto a chair; “it ends today! DO YOU HEAR ME LEON!”<br />
<br />
Seeing stars and feeling like he got hit by a train; Leon had no idea how powerful the sheriff could be when mad. Trying to get out of the chair; only to find the were-grizzly that easily tossed him about pin him down. Leon just looked at the sheriff.<br />
“You wouldn’t understand,” Leon stating blearily; “I nearly lost my son to that punk kid. Over a fucking car!”<br />
“Your right,” Douglas responding; “I wouldn’t understand, but that gives you no right to act the way you have been of late.”<br />
“You think it’s easy,” Leon growling; “I’m a fucking king! I have to be like this,” Leon looking scared; “the pride would attack me viciously like you just did if I showed weakness. This is a matter of social standing,” Leon crying; “if I can’t show strength, how will they trust Peter when he becomes the next were-lion king?”<br />
<br />
Sheriff Cooper looks at the crying were-lion and sighs.<br />
‘Why is it always honor and pride,’ Sheriff Cooper shaking his ursine head in disgust.<br />
“Look Leon,” Douglas placing a paw on the defeated man; “I don’t want to arrest you for threatening my deputy. Nor do I want to arrest you for trying to assault me. I want you to go home and let me handle this.”<br />
“I can’t,” Leon crying; hiding his face behind his paws; “even Regina would look at me as weak and ineffective. I told her I was going to see to it that Daniel remained in his cell.”<br />
“The only way I can think of you maintaining your stature as king,” Sheriff Cooper sighing; “is if you personally take down Frederick Parker.”<br />
“I know where he is at,” Leon growling; “it would be a simple matter for me to rip his tent to shreds and then rip his throat out.”<br />
“Yet,” Sheriff Cooper looking at Leon; “if you were deputized, you could arrest Frederick Parker. But only when he steps into this station tomorrow,” Douglas gauges the were-lion; “imagine his surprise when he gets to the cells only to see you there waiting for him armed.”<br />
“It would be even more of a surprise,” Leon chuckles; “if he saw me shift into my fursona as I was trying to arrest him.”<br />
“More so if the were-lion pride was present to assist the deputies,” Douglas speaks; “having them witness you taking down the criminal…”<br />
<br />
“You asshole,” Leon getting up; “you planned this all didn’t you. The savage beating you gave me,” Leon staring at the Sheriff; “the talk, everything! Just to get me to back off and help.”<br />
“Well,” Douglas sighing; “I can’t take all the credit Your nephew Eugene did tell me how to push your buttons.”<br />
“Devious bastard,” Leon shaking his head; “the talk about the were-tigress and were-wedding, was that all bullshit?”<br />
“Nope,” Douglas answering; “one hundred percent true. We were going to rut each other mad once my cousin’s son went to bed.”<br />
“Fuck,” Leon shaking his head; “I’ll make some calls, but I’ll need some coffee first. And assurances that I&#39;m the one to arrest Frederick Parker and the one to tell him that his son isn&#39;t here,” Leon looking at Douglas; &quot;and some clothes that will fit me.&quot;</p>
