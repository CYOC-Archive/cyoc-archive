<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It wasn&#39;t long before Tora Tachibana returned to the waiting room as Melissa stood beside the examination table that her father was presently seated on.  Melissa did feel glad to see some of her old dad&#39;s behavior. The dad who could laugh and make jokes as he used to. She didn&#39;t want to say it out loud, but she preferred that dad to where he&#39;d been after her mother, Eliza, died. That might make her sound or appear pushy which she didn&#39;t want.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Mr. Jenkins, I have good news,&quot; Tora spoke as entered the room, noting the happy scene, all things considered before him, &quot;everything does check out and you appear to be in perfect health for a male weretiger of your age bracket.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bracket?&quot; Harold asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, because we weres are so long lived, the groupings are by brackets than exact age,&quot; Tora replied and looked down to a clipboard in his hands, &quot;based on your paperwork, you&#39;ll be in the twenty to one hundred twenty bracket. And you are perfectly healthy for a weretiger in that bracket... and with your transformation complete, you pose no danger and will be in complete control.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Complete...&quot; Harold mused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, when a normal first becomes a were, that entail transformation may complete the physical transformation, but the instinctive knowledge of everything related to that were-species doesn&#39;t,&quot; Tora explained, &quot;it will drive new weres to seek additional &quot;romantic&quot; attention with the were that transformed them. And this is critical with regard to Normals becoming Weres, as if they don&#39;t complete their transformation within a certain amount of time... they&#39;ve been recorded to suffer from extensive mental problems and potentially even face death as a result. Your transformation, Mr. Jenkins, is complete and you are in no danger.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that&#39;s good,&quot; Harold said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway, we&#39;ll give you some privacy to get dressed,&quot; Tora said to him and moved to usher Melissa out of the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Harold replied.<br />
<br />
Tora ushered her out gently, with one and on the center of Melissa&#39;s back to give her just enough motivation to walk out, which Melissa was all too happy to comply with. While she felt her father looked good with his youth restored and definitely looked far more muscular than he ever did, that didn&#39;t mean she wanted to see her father naked. Out in the hallway, she found that Akane and Megumi remained quietly waiting there. Megumi waved as Melissa looked to them and then to Tora.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, my niece says that you&#39;re looking to join the werecattle,&quot; Tora said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Niece? You&#39;re not Megumi&#39;s father?&quot; Melissa asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I am her uncle,&quot; Tora gave a chuckle, &quot;Tora spoke, &quot;I am one of Akane&#39;s sons, but I am not Megumi&#39;s father.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah,&quot; Melissa answered and then looked down for a moment as her mind turned to his statement. Her heart did look to being a werecow to be with Trevor, and there were plenty of things that her mind had to admit were good reasons to join them. And her decision was mostly based on her wish not to be at risk of ever falling into the sort of state of mourning that her father was now coming out of. However, that of course didn&#39;t mean that she was fully ready, as there would be no going back once she became a were. That was enough raise some second thoughts in the back of her mind. She figured she&#39;d be one hundred percent comfortable once she&#39;d actually transformed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, yes,&quot; Melissa stated after a moment to collect her thoughts, &quot;There is this boy I REALLY like who is a werebull and...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you&#39;d wish to be with him,&quot; Tora gave a smile, &quot;Well... that is good. Not too many werecattle or werehorses out there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa nodded, &quot;Lots of people go with werewolves, I suppose, as there are more stories on them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And many also chose the various major predators, like lions, tigers, mountain lions, leopards/panthers, and bears for certain levels of power and werefoxes for sexual talents,&quot; Tora nodded, &quot;but many times weres are not as we&#39;re made out to be.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; Melissa wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Many think of werecattle and werehorses as nothing more than farmers and ranchers, which many in fact are,&quot; Tora explained, &quot;but many do contribute to the town in other ways and can be quite helpful. Many of our nurses here at the hospital are werecattle, a few even in the children&#39;s wing... as they show that as a way to show their kindness. And the head of our lab is a female werehorse. It in a sense shows that you can be anything you want to be... be it as a were or anything else...&quot;<br />
<br />
That actually made Melissa smile as it eased her concerns. She could follow her heart and wouldn&#39;t have to worry about having to be a farmer and made her more comfortable with her decision. Doctor Tachibana, meanwhile continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;In the meantime, I&#39;d suggest you go by the pharmacy before you and your father leave,&quot; Tora spoke calmly, &quot;and pick up the birth control pills for werecows. When you actually join them, you&#39;ll take one pill immediately before you join and then take a second pill after your transformation is completed. That will prevent any issues with you becoming pregnant too young...&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa slowly nodded. She remembered from the book she&#39;d gotten from Megumi that weres were highly fertile and had reproductive cycles that were a mix between human and animal, which in a sense fit with what a were was. Female weres didn&#39;t ovulate once a month the way normal human women did and in fact had a heat cycle that would require sexual stimulation to trigger ovulation, which was akin to how many animals dealt with reproduction. However, unlike animals, which had their mating season&#39;s at least once a year or at specific times of the year, depending on the animal species, female weres went into heat once a month, which actually represented their human half. That was the ultimate reason for the specialized birth control pills for each were species.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... my dad doesn&#39;t want me getting pregnant right now, either,&quot; Melissa gave a chuckle, &quot;and I&#39;d agree a bit... I&#39;d prefer to wait until I&#39;m grown up and on my feet, as it were.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tora nodded and Melissa watched as he dug into his pocket and pulled out a small slip of paper and handed it to Melissa. It included the prescription for werecow birth control pills. Melissa took it and thanked Tora as her father emerged from the room he&#39;d been in. As Melissa looked to him, she actually found herself giggling a bit at how tight his tee shirt fit him, not to mention his pants looking rather tight and short on him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, okay,&quot; Harold commented, &quot;I&#39;m going to need bigger clothing...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For your human form, at least,&quot; Melissa gave a giggle and then paused for a moment, &quot;and I&#39;ll probably need to do the same... as I&#39;ll probably get a lot bigger when I change too... bigger hips... much bigger breasts... bigger muscles, too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can hear my bank accounts in their death throws!&quot; Harold gave a teasing sigh and raising one hand up to his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure the college may provide you with some financial help with regard to getting you with new clothing as you have stated being an employee,&quot; Akane spoke from where she stood, &quot;it may not be everything, but they do hold plans that will help...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Harold answered, &quot;that will be helpful.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akane nodded, &quot;and may your futures be bright.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa nodded and followed her father as they began to walk out. The pharmacy was in a space next to the main entry area, and Melissa remembered walking by it when Akane lead her and Megumi in. She looked over her shoulder to see Megumi give her a smile and a thumbs up. She nodded back and then looked over to her father. He looked over to her as they walked along.<br />
<br />
&quot;You feel confident?&quot; Harold asked to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... and you won&#39;t mind if I&#39;m a werecow?&quot; Melissa asked him.<br />
<br />
&quot;So long as it is YOUR choice, I&#39;m perfectly fine with it,&quot; Harold gave a smile and held Melissa to him, &quot;and regardless of the cost of upgrading our wardrobes for what will be our new bodies... so long as it your choice, we&#39;ll manage.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, dad,&quot; Melissa answered, actually feeling fairly happy.<br />
<br />
And that remained with her, as they finished their tasks that related to the things they had to do at the hospital. There would be plenty of things they&#39;d need to do, but as they made their way out to their car, Melissa felt fairly confident that the new life they&#39;d come for would get a good start for. Her dad actually looked better, and from what she&#39;d heard from a man that looked older and oddly enough also had the last name of Jenkins, he&#39;d apparently begun to truly move on from her mother&#39;s death. That made Melissa happy. Harold looked better than he ever had, and even if it meant her dad becoming a were, him being the old happy and at times even joking dad really mattered to her. And as she ran her thumb over the edge of the cap to the werecow birth control pills she held, she hoped her own transformation would be &quot;a-moo-zing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll at least let me be there... right?&quot; Harold asked as he climbed into the car.<br />
<br />
&quot;You want to watch?&quot; Melissa teased.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Harold answered, &quot;your transformation should be private and between you and Trevor. I&#39;d just like meet his parents while you and your new boyfriend have your moment.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just so long as you promise not to eat your in-laws or their livestock, I&#39;m sure they won&#39;t mind you meeting with them,&quot; Melissa answered, &quot;though, the book I got from Megumi... it also says that many were groups... while they&#39;re fine with other weres visiting, you wouldn&#39;t be able to transform unless specifically invited to do so.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harold nodded, &quot;Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ll try to handle all I need to do for my new wardrobe during the day, including whatever paperwork I&#39;d need to fill out for the clothing benefits the college will provide regarding my transformation...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And then well come all the happy weddings,&quot; Melissa smiled, &quot;you and Virginia, me and Trevor, and we&#39;ll all be one happy furry family.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s not get ahead of ourselves,&quot; Harold answered, &quot;I&#39;d like you to be out of college before you actually start planning a wedding.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not even yours?&quot; Melissa teased.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you&#39;re lucky I&#39;m driving, or you&#39;d get such a tickle,&quot; Harold chuckled, &quot;speaking of which... I might have to tell Trevor exactly where you&#39;re ticklish.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa laughed in response, as things felt good at the moment.</p>
