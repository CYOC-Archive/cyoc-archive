<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br>Looking over his body, Brandon loved the changes that had already manifested in him. If he didn't know any better, he was just as muscled as the bear to his left. A question entered his mind though, not knowing what the answer could be on his own, Brandon quickly decided to ask.</br>
<br>"Hey dad... I thought you said this bear's name was Alex?"</br>
<br>"Yes, that is right... why do you ask?"</br>
<br>"Well I know I clearly heard him say that I could trust ol' officer David."</br>
<br>"You heard right Brandon... let me explain. Some of us, over the years, have felt that it would be better to have two names. One name is the human person we typically see day in and day out, however the other name is the person who we are really deep down, the person who we lock away in order to remain human when necessary. Alex is his human name and David is his anthro name. Do you understand?"</br>
<br>"Yep, I guess so... then... should I have two names?"</br>
<br>"You can... if that is what you would like. We don't have to have two names, but like I said before, for some it helps."</br>
<br>"Why would having two names help?"</br>
<br>"A human life is very different from the life of an anthro. Obviously for the main reason of the change. There are some out there who don't care for their ability to change and like living two separate lives. Those are the ones who are more fun when they do. To them, changing is a way to let go of everything that makes us part human, shedding off all our worries and cares, not thinking about the major task that is going to hit right away and letting our animalistic side reign for a while. Oh ho and let me tell you, when they change, they are hotter than heck in the sack!"</br>
<br>Brandon smiled, but then wondered what the case was with David then. Brandon looked to David's deep brown eyes with an inquisitive stare, as if he were looking through the pages of a thick novel.</br>
<br>"I know that look Brandon. You are trying to read me aren't you?"</br>
<br>Immediately when he heard that he was found out, Brandon stopped and held his head low, staring into his own lap. David outstretched his hand and lifted his gaze back to look him in the eyes like a real man.</br>
<br>"It's alright to be curious. I know I was when I first found out about my changing. My mom gave me the birth name of Alex and ever since I could remember, whenever she called out my name, it never really sounded right. Then on the night of my first change, right around your age, I heard a name in my head but I didn't know what it was. After I changed and became pretty much the bear that you see before you, I knew what my name was supposed to be. It was David, so when I change I am David and when I am normal, I am Alex."</br>
<br>"Huh.. o...k..."</br>
<br>Rick looked at Brandon, hearing the stress in his voice during those last words and became slightly concerned.</br>
<br>"Is everything alright Brandon?"</br>
<br>Brandon pushed and strained himself just to get a small sentence out. "N.... no... I think... some...t-thing is... wr-... wrong with me."</br>
<br>David the bear becoming concerned chimed in as well. He knew that there were some weres of legend that could become hybrids, but he never ever thought he would see the day anytime soon. "What does it feel like?"</br>
<br>"Gah! It feels like my insides are on fire while my muscles feel as though buckets of ice were sitting directly on them!"</br>
<br>David looked at Rick with a knowing look, but wondered if he should even say anything at all. Rick, on the other hand, knew the look because it conveyed exactly what he was thinking.</br>
<br>Suddenly Brandon's muscles surged, pushing the fibers of his clothes way past their limits. His body was becoming increasingly thick, beefy and hairy. His belly grew round but hard as a rock. He could feel his bones shift inside himself. He even noticed his skull changing shape. His ears grew slightly pointed but also round, more like a rounded point, showing signs of hybridization. His face pushed out into a muzzle, one that was like a wolf's, but slightly shorter and stubby. His nose flattened out, grew jet black and moist, but had the shape of a bear's even though his father was clearly a werewolf. Brandon felt a stirring in his pants, both in the front and back. First his tail popped out from the base of his spine, but it was of medium length and thick like a fat bear nub of a tail. Standing now with his pants off, genetailia and tail exposed, Brandon watched in amazement and delight. His cock thickened and lengthened at the same time. His cock grew to eleven inches in length, which was common among werewolves, but his cock was just as thick as David's, having the girth of a bear. Then Brandon could feel his balls churn, swelling in size and filling with a grand amount of seed. His balls slowly grew to the size of tennis balls, but then kept going until they were the size of apples. When it was finally over, he stood there with the same height, but with the best of both worlds. He was a lycanbear, a true hybrid between the two... but the only thing any of them could think was...</br></p>
