<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty groaned as his body stood up, legs still weak from the full body fucking his torso had just received.  He held his head to his stomach, horns pushing into his breasts as he stood and tried to come to terms with his new latest messed up situation.  Looking down, he saw the now docile cock lead away from his groin, its length extending all the way down to his feet and then about another two or so feet away from him where it lay serenely on the grass, almost like a snake lying in wait.  Ty grimaced, noting another thing he had to worry about now, another new piece of anatomy his body would have to adapt to, not to mention it was one more way he could be exploited in a fight, not that he had won many of those as of late anyways.  He let out a yelp as the cock twitched, then settled down once more.<br />
<br />
“Goddamit,” he said, sighing heavily, “How the fuck am I even supposed to move with this thing on me?  And why the hell are there so many cocks in this game?  Who designed this!”. He kicked the ground in anger, doubled by frustration that his female voice aroused him been when he was angered.  “Fuck, maybe I can…”. He thought about how the thing had been moving earlier.  He wondered why it was so docile now, and then he had an idea.  Parts of his brain that had never been activated began to churn, thinking very, very hard about moving the tentacle like dick that sprang forth from his body.  It turned out, he didn’t have to think very hard at all.  The thing moved like he had always had it, and it even felt more dexterous and strong than his tail.  With little effort he had made the tentacle dick rise from the ground and face him.  He guided it to his hips and began to wrap it around his waist, once, then twice, almost three full rotations until it was firmly wrapped around his body, the tip of the dick tucked right above his groin.  <br />
<br />
Ty let out a heavy sigh, feeling more relaxed now that he probably wouldn’t have to worry about tripping over the cumbersome cock like that jerk nypmh had said, but it didn’t help that with it wrapped around his waist, he felt slightly aroused from having his new cock writhe and pull against his body with every step.  it didn’t set him off, but it was a constant reminder of his current state.  He took a deep breath in to calm his nerves, then gagged.  He hadn’t noticed it before, but he reeked.  Not just of sex, but sweat and dirt as well.  His unfortunate rollick with the faeries and his latest thorough dicking had left him and his clothes covered in sweat and less mentionable things.  <br />
<br />
Looking to the stream the next to him, Ty decided it would probably be best to take advantage of a bath while he could.  Looking around the area, Ty didn’t notice any immediate threats, and when he reached the edge of the water, he did not see anything lurking in there.  The water was crystal clear and moving slowly, and seemed to be only several feet deep.  Dipping a toe in, he shuddered at the cold water, but figured it would feel good on his weakened body, not to mention it would serve to dull some of the lust emanating from his purple genitals.  <br />
<br />
It was decided, and Ty began to undress, carefully placing his head on the soft grass, face pointed towards his body.  He unwound his long cock and disrobed, placing the clothes on the rocks next to the stream.  He would clean them too, but first he needed to bathe himself.  This, as it turned out, presented something of a problem.  His head was still very much not attached to his body, and he had little desire to sheathe his dick neck into his upper pussy any time soon, for fear he may be unable to stop once he did it.  Groaning, Ty realized he really only had one good option, and bent over to pick up his head.  He shivered as he stepped into the cool water, and grimaced as he felt the tentacle dick snake it’s way towards his head and begin to wrap itself around his forehead and chin, ensuring that his head would not float away or sink as he bathed.  The warm flesh and musk did little to brighten his mood, but as he splashed water on his crimson skin and scrubbed away all the built up filth on his body, he felt a little better.  <br />
<br />
While his head bobbed in the calm stream, floating about a foot away from his body like a buoy, his ears perked up as they heard something in the distance.   It was loud, and obviously not trying to be sneaky in any sense of the word.  Loud thumps of foot falls and the cracking of branches became louder as whatever it was came closer and closer to Ty’s position.  Reeling in his head, Ty picked it up and tucked it under his left arm, holding out the right in a defensive stance as the thing came closer.  From just beyond the dim light of the clearing emerged a towering figure, its features revealed as they stepped forward.  <br />
<br />
A orc woman, and a tall one at that, stood about three yards away from Ty’s position in the water.  She was massive, easily two or three feet taller than his Tiefling avatar, and he had already estimated his own height at roughly six feet tall.  She was built like a mountain, thick muscle covering every inch of her dark green body, which was easy to tell with her minimal garb.  A leather belt wrapped around her waist, holding two large battle axes denoting her as fighter.  Below that, she wore an animal pelt wasit covering, although that was pushed to the side to reveal her unshaven and dripping green cunt.  Leather boots covered her feet, and in between the belt and her foot wear, thick scar riddle legs kept aloft a similarly scarred, muscled, and tattooed upper body that bore no more clothing save a steel armband around her right arm.  Further up, past her bulging abs, two mountainous breasts hung heavily from her chest, each capped with a thick dark green nipple.  Ty saw all of this, but was most shocked by the state of the woman’s head, or more particularly, her face.  She had the typical orc warrior look, long black hair with random braids denoting her strength, short pointed ears, and harsh eyes with dark yellow pupils. However, instead of the expected bestial nose and tusked mouth, there was a massive unshaven orc cunt in their place, it’s lips green lips several shades darker than her own, and drooling uncontrollably down her chin.  A hand was currently rubbing it desperately, but it seemed like it brought no pleasure to the woman as her eyes seemed to focus on one thing.  More accurately two actually, as they shifted between the two cocks Ty bore.<br />
<br />
Ty made to speak, but another sound beat him to it.  It was raspy and harsh, but undeniably feminine.  It was slightly slurred too, as though the owner could not quite remove their tongue from their teeth as they spoke. Of course, the orc had no teeth to speak of.  Her pussy twitched and spasmed as her voice boomed across the clearing, “Holy shit!  What the fuck happened to you!?”<br />
<br />
Ty, used now to the forests residents attempting to beguile or trick him, was taken aback at this orc’s frankness, and he was a little insulted.  “Me?  What the fuck happened to you?  Where’d you mouth and nose go?”<br />
<br />
The orc took a step forward, her posture slumping as she stopped diddling her facial cunt and pointed at it instead.  “Fine, I’ll go first.  These damn faeries, or, bugs, or whatever, just assaulted me as I was minding my own business!”  She motioned around her self, waving her hadns around to evoke the cloud of fey.  “Just flew up, peeled off my bits, and slapped this god-awful cunt on my face!” She said gesturing madly at the talking pussy.  “And now, worst of all, this thing hungers, fucking hungers, from spunk!  I can’t even try to hide it!  I nearly went mad once I smelled your, er, cock… cocks I guess?” <br />
<br />
She seemed to blush at this, a deeper green color flushing across her cheeks.  “That’s kind of why I’m here.  I think those assholes cursed me, and loathe as I am to admit it, I think I need to swallow some cock or I am going to go insane or die, maybe both.  I can feel it, like a pit in my stomach, when you’re super hungry, y’know.”<br />
<br />
Ty wasn’t quite sure what to say.  On one hand, this surely had to be another trick of the damned forest.  On the other hand, this orc woman seemed so earnest, so desperate, that it was hard to believe she was telling the truth.  And, in truth to himself, his neck dick did seem to like the idea of being rammed down that green slit…<br />
<br />
Ty deliberated for a second, before deciding to…</p>
