<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I am Ellie Smith. I am your usual young, well developing 16 year old girl. I have dark brown eyes, with light brown hair which I liked to wear long. My breast size was BB and still developing. I had a good bust too and a nice round ass. On that night I wore a yellow blouse made with some silky material and a dark purple skirt made with similar materials. But there was one thing, I wasn't attracted to guys. I was what you'd call, a lesbian. Well, on that night, SHE appeared. She was the perfect woman. She Had ruby-like eyes and red silky hair to match. She looked like a 17 to 18 year old. She had nice breasts at about CC cups and good ass and also a round ass. On the night, she was wearing a black miniskirt which just about covers her round butt. I could also see her panties which was purple made with some smooth silky fabric. She also had a short-sleeved blouse on which was colored with a light tint of pink. She also had a red ribbon tied around the collar of her blouse. Well, on the night, I was feeling particularly lonely because I just broke up with my previous date who was rather hot. I was at the bar because there were waitresses who I fancied there. Then SHE walked in. As she walked past me, I desperately needed someone to talk to. So I whispered &quot;Please sit next to me&quot; to no one in particular. It was quiet enough that no one would have heard it but then, SHE sat next to me. I looked up surprised. She looked at me with little respect. She was so hot, I felt wet in my red silky panties. So I tried to make small talk. &quot;W-what's your name?&quot; I asked politely. &quot;My name is Elliot Yujiro&quot; she said with much the same look. &quot;So you're Japanese?&quot; I asked accidentally. &quot;No. I am half Japanese. I came from Tokyo. My mother was English while my father was Japanese&quot; She said. I couldn't believe it. I was next to the most sexy girl I have ever met and she told me everything I would of though of as private. &quot;So... Do you want a drink?&quot; I asked. &quot;No&quot; She said, plain and simple. &quot;Oh... So... Why are you staring at me like that?&quot; I asked. &quot;Because I despise you&quot; She said. I looked confused. Why would she be sitting next to me answering my questions if she hated me so much? &quot;Why?&quot; I asked. &quot;Because I hate lesbians&quot; she said. I was overcome with shock. I didn't know how she could've known. &quot;So why are you sitting next to me?&quot; I asked. She didn't reply. I decided to try and continue this somewhere else because I didn't want to let anyone hear about me and my preferences. &quot;Come with me please&quot; I asked her and she followed my instructions. She got up and out of her chair and followed me out of the pub. &quot;So, do you know how to drive?&quot; She nodded yes &quot;Take me to your car&quot;. She led me to her car which a Lamborghini in metallic red colors. We got in and I asked her &quot;Do you live alone?&quot;. She nodded yes again. &quot;Is anyone expecting you tonight?&quot; I asked. &quot;No&quot; she said. &quot;Then, drive us to your place now&quot; I said. She then started the ignition and started driving. During our trip, my eyes were fixed to her breasts. &quot;At the next red light, unbutton your blouse so that I can see your breasts&quot; I instructed. So at the next red light, she did just that. Then I found out that she was wearing a red lace bra made with the silky fabric which matched her panties.  I started fondling them. They felt much better than my previous dates. I told her to completely ignore what I was doing so there were no accidents. Then I asked her &quot;Do you like what I'm doing?&quot;. She said no. &quot;But is this getting you turned on?&quot; I asked. She nodded a yes. Then we arrived at her place, which was like a Japanese mansion. It was very big but it was quite far away from the city. I told her to button up her blouse before she got out of the car. When I got inside, I was astonished. There were even wooden sliding doors that the Japanese used. &quot;So this is yours?&quot; I asked. She nodded again. &quot;So, take me to your bedroom&quot; I said. She led me through a couple of doors and fake walls to finally get to her bedroom. It's like it was built to trap visitors. Then I asked her &quot;So, why do you despise lesbianism so much?&quot;. &quot;Because it is against humanity&quot; came the reply. I was feeling horny at that moment since I was in a room with an absolutely gorgeous girl. So I...</p>
