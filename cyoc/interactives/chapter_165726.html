<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dan headed away from his first test subjects, looking for more promising prey.<br />
<br />
He spotted it in the form of Scott, a friend of a friend who lived in the same building. Scott was tall, at least 6 foot 5, which combined with his broad shoulders and lithe waist made him very intimidating to someone as average as Dan. He towered over a group of friends who all seemed to hang on to his every word, laughing at his jokes and nodding in agreement. Dan knew in his heart that Scott was a nice guy but was jealous of his easy confidence. Now he had the opportunity to make him decidedly less forbidding...<br />
<br />
Choosing his fellow Maths student Cat, a petite girl who was sitting at one of the library, he made his move. Suddenly, Cat was hunched over her desk, as she was too tall to be at eye level with her screen, and her legs spilled out the sides of the too small desk. Scott, ignorant of his transformation, was now straining to make eye contact with his now much taller friends from his diminutive stature of 5 foot 1. His body and his clothes still had the same proportions as before but on a reduced scale, which left Dan wondering if everything about Scott had shrunk in proportion as well. He&#39;d heard rumours that Scott was pretty well endowed – ten inches, if his friend Frankie was to be believed - and he was keen to explore whether the stories were true. But that didn&#39;t mean he no longer wanted to mess with Scott&#39;s height.<br />
<br />
Mind made up, Dan reversed his last swap and picked out a new victim. A guy from his Maths seminar, Mark, was in the crowd surrounding Scott and Dan thought he was a bit of a douche – ripe for taking down a notch. With a thought, Dan swapped Little Scott over to Mark, then swapped Scott’s height with Cat again, keeping everything else about the two in proportion. He could see the bulge in Marks pants looked rather bigger than before – from his adjusting, it was clear Marks underwear was uncomfortably tight. Scott pants looked a little looser in front than before the two switches.<br />
<br />
Excited now,  Dan reversed the genital swap. Marks basket deflated and Scott&#39;s ballooned outward, snaking left across his pelvis. Mark&#39;s trousers looked a little looser than before the first switch. By Dan’s reckoning, his junk would be smaller by nearly a fifth – an inch shaved off the average cock. Feeling wicked, he wanted to repeat his little trick and go even further. He switched Scott&#39;s cock with one of his mates who was shorter even than Dan, but quite muscular and built. Something about this combination and the dude’s shy demeanor made Dan think he was a little short-changed below the belt. He thought he would be an ideal candidate for a little extra length at Marks expense. Dan admired the way Scott’s cock filled the guy&#39;s pants – the dude was wincing due to the constriction of his trousers -  then returned Scott to his original height. This done, Dan swapped the short dude&#39;s now slightly above average junk from Scott to Mark, then gave Cat Scott&#39;s old height.<br />
<br />
Satisfied he’d done enough damage to Marks ego, he returned all three cocks to their rightful owners, wondering a little if it was possible to make his guinea pigs aware of their transformed endowments.<br />
<br />
Clearly he could if he wanted – Scott, despite being unperturbed by his newly reduced stature (as were the people around him), had clearly noticed changes in his crotch. His bulge looked deliciously big in his trousers, snaking to the left across his pelvis, with his heavy balls straining the front of his jeans. Even though in reality, his junk was exactly the same size as before his height swap, from Scott’s perspective it felt a fifth bigger than a moment before – if Frankie was correct  that meant nearly two inches bigger than before. No wonder his eyes were bugging out – Scott paused in the middle of his story, his hand clearly itching to feel his bulge, confirm what he suspected was now true. Scott’s short muscular friend was in the middle of the same revelation. He was adjusting his crotch trying to alleviate the tightness in his pants.<br />
<br />
Mark over in the corner, on the other hand, was making an altogether different discovery. He adjusted his crotch, presumably noticed it felt roomier than before. He looked like he was starting to feel worried, breathing heavily. He made off for the toilets, presumably to check himself out. Dan looked forward to catching up with Mark at their next tutorial to see how his prank would play out. <br />
<br />
Turning back to Scott, he admired what he’d done. Whittled down from 6 ft 5 to 5ft, Scott had gone from being remote and intimidating to Dan, to being really cute – Dan had never really appreciated before how handsome Scott was or how well he filled his clothes. The guy’s bulge – the same size as before but made to look more impressive thanks to Scott’s new height – was looking ever more intriguing to Dan. He was starting to wonder if he should find ways to get to know Scott better in future. Perhaps his new powers could help?<br />
<br />
Whatever, he decided, he would see Scott back at the dorm later so any changes could wait until then. For now, though, he had an entire campus to experiment on, and he intended to do just that.</p>
