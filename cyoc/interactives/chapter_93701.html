<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">One quiet afternoon a young man named Nathan arrived home from the expensive prep school his parents sent him to.  He was welcomed into the lavish 3 story estate by his frigid and elderly butler and caretaker, Jeeves, who directed him to his piano for his three hour after school practice.  Jeeves also informed the young Nathan that his parents were away in Europe, again, and would return sometime next week.  Nathan shrugged and silently retrieved his practice sheets while Jeeves crept away to return to his other duties.  Nathan had been raised in luscious privilege but was lonely, and unknown to anyone, gay.  He doubted his parents would care had they a moment to talk to him and at his school you could be anything along as you were also rich but he kept quiet.  <br />
<br />
As he sat down he reviewed his unremarkable reflection in the pristine piano.  He was unusually tall by a few inches but otherwise unremarkable with long, soft blond hair, a mousy face with small blue eyes and an average 18 year body that had neither fat, nor muscle nor hair yet.  He was perfectly immaculate and ordinary which suited his subdued personality just as well.  He did however, have a talent for music, one honed through meticulous practice.  Privately, Nathan envied rock and metal musicians, teen bands who took their music to the streets and YouTube and played from their heart, struggling to get by.  Here, he had everything and played what he was told for the enjoyment of no one.  It was his own gilded prison.  Feeling a rare rebellious urge, Nathan glanced around for that decrypted butler and making sure he was alone he pulled out his iPad.   <br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s try something different today&quot; he sneered, imagining the look on his parents faces.  He pulled up YouTube and began searching for a piano play through for some Bullet For My Valentine songs, today he was going to &#39;rock out.&#39;  During his search, however, he stumbled across one of the top videos on YouTube right now by NickPix.<br />
<br />
“Goddamn faggots think they own the world now that the hippie liberal government is on their side. They’re nothing but a bunch of cocksuckers. If you’re one of those homo queers, feel free to go die in a hole. Thank you, good night.”  Unaware of the damage, Nathan quickly closed out of the disturbing video rant while shaking his head and wondering how something that stupid ended up at the top viewed.  <br />
<br />
&quot;What a strange and disgusting man, maybe I&#39;m better off being gay than a hateful straight guy like him&quot; he thought aloud.  Finally, he did find his play through and watched as a cute metalhead teen played Tears Don&#39;t Fall on a small and cheap keyboard.  He had long messy hair, unshaven teen stubble and wore shorts and a tank top that exposed his decent muscles.  More than that however, Nathan felt himself attracted to the young man&#39;s virile attitude.  He didn&#39;t care what anyone thought about him, he simply did his own thing, loud and proud in his own sort of way.  Nathan began to expertly mimic the teen&#39;s playing on his piano, spicing the song up where he saw fit and weaving a beautiful melody.  His mind wandered constantly, however, back to the video and how hot the guy had been.  The more he thought about it the clumsier his playing became, he began missing notes and losing his place and tempo as his hands danced oafishly across the keys.  He felt his face flush with heat and anger at his situation.  An uncommon frustration rose up within Nathan and he tossed the piano over violently, furious at his playing, furious at his parents, furious at every damn thing.  It crashed to the ground, pieces flying every which way.  Three pieces broke off and shot right towards an unsuspecting Nathan.  Two of them molded into a round, hollow shape and became dark and pliable as they embedded themselves into his ear lobes and stretched them a fair bit becoming small tunnels.  The third shrank further, contorting in on itself and hardening into a dull metal ring which pierced his nostril.  Nathan however, noticed none of this, only the pain which made him angrier.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuckin&#39; a!  Why do I have to play this stupid fucking piano in this stupid fucking house for parents who don&#39;t care and that lurking douchebag butler?&quot;  He screamed.  The heat rising throughout his body blinded him to how different he sounded, or the drop in height he was experiencing as he lost precious inches and shrank from his respectable 6&#39;2 down to only about 5&#39;8, his clothes becoming baggy on him.  &quot;Fuck man, even my stupid clothes don&#39;t fit right, shit!&quot;  He bellowed, his voice cracking as it became deeper.  He kicked off his ill fitting shoes, tired of how his shrunken feet bounced around in them.  They slammed into a painting on the wall and crumbled to the floor.  The high quality Italian leather began to fade and decay into a more base and thinner material, dulling to grey as the sole became a dirty white and the laces faded to black.  A familiar white star logo drew itself on the shoes as they became size 7 Converse All Stars.  The silky socks on his feet also shrank and weathered, the threads unraveling and the material deepening to a jet black as they turned into no-show skater socks.  <br />
<br />
Nathan continued to fume and fuss, but was interrupted by an agonizing cracking and stretching sound which only served to piss him off more.  His hands shrank, his fingers becoming smaller and more calloused as he watched in horror, more cuts and scars appearing by the second.  They would never be the long nimble fingers of a pianist but mentally he seemed to know they still served him musically.  His arms had grown impressive muscle tone and moderate amounts of brown hair, his legs mirrored this change with toned calves and thighs warmed by a soft advance of brown hair going up into his shorts where other changes were pleasuring his confused body.  He hastily unbuttoned his preppy shorts even as they grew down across his legs and squeezed around them becoming dark washed skinny jeans that would do nothing to hide his raging bulge.  <br />
<br />
Rustling through the pockets he discovered a small, expertly crafted bowl, still stuffed with weed and a lighter.  Part of him objected, no, his parents, his advisors, he couldn&#39;t do this.  He couldn&#39;t give up what he was.  But he couldn&#39;t resist his new urges and he eagerly sucked down puffs of smoke, letting them fill his lungs and exaggerate his changes.  His uniform warped, material fading away as the sleeves became sectioned off and unraveled into nothing, revealing more of his large arms.  The front and back receded a bit forming a muscle tight tank top that revealed his proud pecs with a dash of hair in between and further down he could feel hard abs.  Spiky letters drew the phrase &#39;Your God Is Dead&#39; down across the tank in blood red ink.  He scratched his bulging pecs eagerly, such strong meaty muscles for punishing faggots in the mosh pits.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Heh this ain&#39;t so bad, actually this is awesome as fuck man&quot; he thought aloud as the smoke clouded his mind.  Scraggily dark facial hair blessed his defining jaw line while his face hardened and his eyes sank a bit.  His once beautiful blue eyes were red and watery, unfocused and high.  &quot;Fuck yeah&quot; he mumbled, taking another long puff.  He could feel himself losing Nathan and becoming Nate, the metal head and high school drop out.  His brain refocused itself, altering from the years of weed and metal.  None of his intelligence went to waste is was simply being put to better use, learning how to give a good fuck, how to play a good set, how to roll a blunt.  He was part of a close brotherhood of lost souls with respect for an underappreciated style of music.  He wanted this, he needed this.  His rich ass parents gave up on him a long time ago, he was untamable.  They stayed abroad as much as they could to avoid facing the angry son they spoiled but never loved.  Too afraid now to push him to go back to school or move out the 19 year old just stayed around the house smoking weed and playing licks on his guitar.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my fucking god, what&#39;s happening to me?&quot;  He moaned, feeling suddenly afraid and confused at his changing mind and body.   He couldn&#39;t help but clutch his throbbing member which unlike the rest of him was actually expanding a few inches, his balls dropping accordingly to pump his body with the hormones that supplied his rage and sexual need.  He imagined himself with the guy from the video at a brutal concert, blast beats exploding in the background until gradually his visage began to morph.  The man became slimmer and feminine while retaining every ounce of the fire and attitude he loved until he was grinding against a sexy ass metal chick in the center of a raging mosh pit.  &quot;Fucking brutal!&quot;  He shouted as he exploded, losing more and more of his homosexuality and weakness with each thrust into the air.  As his cream soaked the ruins of his old piano it started to melt away and assimilate itself into a beastly 8 string guitar.  His pride and joy.  &quot;That was some intense shit&quot; he groaned, shaking his head.  All memory of Nathan vanished with the remains of his piano as the new metal head picked up his guitar and started playing...</p>
