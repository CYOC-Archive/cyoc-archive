<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The car ride was relatively short. Mel spent most of it tickling and teasing Heather while Gabby commented on how cute she was. Finally they pulled into a familiar parking lot. It was the daycare Gabby owned. Heather and Mel had first met there years ago. Heather wondered why they had come here. She guessed it was to play. Gabby parked the car and climbed out to unlock the daycare&#39;s door. Mel unbuckled Heather and lifted her out of the car before following.<br />
<br />
&quot;We have no clients today so you can have the place to yourselves.&quot; Gabby said as she let them in. &quot;I have to do some paperwork so I&#39;ll be in the office for the next few hours. Have fun!&quot;<br />
<br />
Gabby switched on the lights to reveal a brightly colored lobby with comfortable seating and a long counter with cubby holes behind it. She waved at the two girls and then disappeared through a side door which she locked behind her. Mel carried Heather through the other door behind the counter into the daycare proper. Heather had been here a million times before, but something seemed different today. Mel set her down and stepped into an alcove next to the door where the staff kept their coats and purses. Heather was pulled from her musing by the sound of a zipper and the rustle of cloth hitting the thick carpet. She turned and nearly screamed.<br />
<br />
Mel had removed her nanny dress, letting it fall to the floor. She wore no bra, she had nothing for a bra to hold, and her small nipples were poking out like prickles on a rose bush. She reached down and began removing her panties. She seemed to have some difficulty doing this. Mainly because, as Heather saw, the panties seemed to be made of latex. As she peeled them off they revealed a thin cotton pad that seemed to be stuck on her crotch. After she stepped out of the rubber panties she peeled the cloth off and dropped it in a bucket with small splat. The room filled with a familiar sexual scent as Heather realized that the pad had been soaked in Mel&#39;s juices which were now running down her bony thighs and dripping from her exposed lips.<br />
<br />
Something clicked in Heather&#39;s mind and she looked around in horror. She now knew what was different about the daycare and she was berating herself for not realizing it sooner. All the familiar furniture was too big. Sized for a teen or adult. The toys were like the ones in her bath yesterday. They looked like they could be ordinary children&#39;s toys at first glance, but they all had a very sexual twist to them. The childish art on the walls had a pornographic look to it that would make the mother of an actual child faint. This was very much an &#39;Adult&#39; daycare.<br />
<br />
Heather spun and tried to open the door, intent on running away, but the knob turned freely in her hand. She remembered that it was a special knob, designed to open only if you gripped it correctly. She tried, but like the buckles on her stroller she somehow couldn&#39;t find the strength. She was trapped by a child lock. She needed to find another way out. She turned towards the fire exit, but remembered that it had a child lock too. The windows were designed to only open a few inches so she could never squeeze through them. There was no way out for her.<br />
<br />
Then she remembered her totem. It was still on her wrist. She focused on it, ready to activate it and escape back into the normal world, but then she had second thoughts. What would happen if she used the totem here? Would she be dumped into the normal version of the daycare wearing nothing but the Big Tots diaper? What about Gabby and Mel? How would they react to finding her here in a diaper in the normal world? She didn&#39;t know what to do. Escape back to reality and face the consequences there, or stay here in the scenario to be subjected to her best friend&#39;s sudden, unexplained lust again.<br />
<br />
She looked back over at Mel. To her relief she saw that Mel had at least covered up. She wore one of the employee&#39;s bright blue uniform aprons, though she still had nothing on underneath it. She had removed her shoes and stockings and was now barefoot on the plush carpet like Heather. The apron was tight against her flat chest  and hung to just above her knees. Heather could just make out the shimmer of moisture on her bare legs.<br />
<br />
A sudden soft beeping sound startled Heather so badly that she almost jumped out of her diaper. Mel turned to the counter running down one side of the alcove and removed an oversized baby bottle from the warmer set up on top of it. The bottle was full of what looked like milk, but was more of an off-white color. Heather guessed that it was formula. Mel tested the bottle on her wrist and seemed satisfied with the temperature. She turned and strode towards Heather with the bottle in her hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s get you hydrated before we start playing.&quot; she said sweetly.<br />
<br />
Heather tried to dodge and run, but Mel was too quick for her and just like before her strength seemed overwhelming. Mel scooped her up and carried her to a large rocking chair in the corner. Once Mel had made herself comfortable and gotten Heather situated on her rather thin lap she held the bottle up to Heather&#39;s lips. Heather stared at it, cross-eyed. The rubber nipple was waving back and forth before her lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on. Open up sweetie.&quot; Mel coaxed.<br />
<br />
Seeing no way out of this, aside from using her totem and facing the consequences, Heather parted her lips and let Mel slide the nipple in. She sat there for a moment with the rubber nipple in her mouth, then gave it an experimental suck. Whatever was in the bottle tasted amazing. It was like warm milk, but slightly sweet. Heather began sucking harder, trying to get as much of the liquid across her tongue as she could. She kept drinking more and more of it. The size of the bottle made it seem bottomless, but after several minutes she finally began sucking air and Mel pulled it free with a pop.<br />
<br />
Heather lay limply in her friend&#39;s arms, feeling bloated and sluggish. She didn&#39;t resist when Mel lifted her up to her shoulder and started patting her back. Heather didn&#39;t think this was necessary, but to her surprise she eventually let out a loud belch. This was followed soon after by two smaller burps and then Mel lay her back down across her lap again. The burping had helped. She didn&#39;t feel as bloated anymore, but now she had another problem.<br />
<br />
Heather hadn&#39;t peed since early that morning. Normally that wouldn&#39;t be a problem for her, but she had just finished off a massive bottle. It seemed like her body realized that it had an excess of fluids and had decided that now would be a good time to get rid of some. Heather tried to get up. Sure, she was wearing a diaper, but she didn&#39;t want to use it now. She desperately wanted to use a toilet like an adult. She turned to roll off Mel&#39;s bony knees, but was held fast.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where do you think you&#39;re going little one?&quot; Mel asked teasingly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, bathroom.&quot; Heather mumbled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Silly baby, you know you were never potty trained.&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather had to stop and think about this. In the scenario builder she had chosen to not be incontinent. So why did Mel think that she was? Was there another setting that adjusted the way others perceived you? She mentally kicked herself for not going through all the menus. This perverted daycare was also probably caused by a weird setting. She doubted that the basic sexual setting covered anything like this. Come to think of it, wasn&#39;t there a sub-menu beneath the &#39;force non-sexual&#39; button? She needed to get back to her phone, and back to the normal world, so she could check.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you having tummy trouble?&quot; Mel asked and pressed on Heather&#39;s abdomen.<br />
<br />
&quot;N-no.&quot; Heather gasped. She really had to go now and the pressure Mel was applying wasn&#39;t helping.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then what&#39;s the matter?&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather couldn&#39;t take it anymore. With a whimper, she released her bladder and began flooding her diaper.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah! There we go!&quot; Mel said triumphantly.<br />
<br />
Heather felt a sudden pressure on the front of her diaper. She looked down to see Mel was pressing her hand into the plastic.<br />
<br />
&quot;What-&quot; she began, but gasped when Mel started massaging her through the padding.<br />
<br />
Heather was still peeing. The heat of it was spreading through the thick padding that Mel was now pressing into her. Heather tried to pull away but somehow found herself grinding back into Mel&#39;s hand. Mel was skilled and the pleasure grew quickly. Before Heather had even finished peeing she was cumming into her diaper as well. Mel held her as she squirmed her way through her orgasm. When she at last lay still on her friend&#39;s lap Mel leaned down and kissed her lightly on the lips. Heather was too spent to respond.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good baby.&quot; Mel whispered. &quot;Now, let&#39;s get you changed.&quot;</p>
