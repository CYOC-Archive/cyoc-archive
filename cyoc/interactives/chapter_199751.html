<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tricia fiddled with the remote for some time, examining menus and checking options, both of which seemed nearly endless. <br />
<br />
Finally, she had programmed the remote to make exact changes to certain parts of her body. To be better prepared this time, she removed her socks, leaving herself in nothing but her bra, shirt and panties. Then she zapped her reflection with the remote, placed it gently on her desk before moving to sit on her bed, and watched as the changes began to unfold.<br />
<br />
First, her feet altered a bit, the skin gaining a slightly tougher, leathery feel. Her big and little toes shrank up the sides of her feet, becoming less substantial even as the middle three thickened and lengthened, the separation between the toes becoming less prominent. Their much thicker nails became an opaque pastel mint color to match her hair and tail. Tricia tried to move her outer toes, but only succeeded in the faintest of wiggling.<br />
<br />
With sounds not unlike the stretching of cords, accompanied by a good deal of popping, the tendons and bones of her shifted. Her feet angled downward slightly, her arches straining as her soles pushed out a size longer, moving her thick, hooflike toes further away from her. Tricia&#39;s heels shifted, becoming less substantial even as she felt two cracks in her ankles, signaling much less dexterous joints.<br />
<br />
As Tricia was examining her hybrid equine feet, her hands started tingling, and she absentmindedly flexed her fingers. It was only the familiar sounds of popping and stretching, now in her hands, that drew her eyes up to them. Her fingers shifted in a similar manner as her toes had; her thumb and pinkie fingers shortening slightly as her middle three fingers thickened and lengthened. The fingernails became pastel green and hooflike as well. With a good deal of groaning tendons and spasming muscles, her palms extended forward by an inch.<br />
<br />
She looked over them in wonder, flexing them again as the shifting sensation dissipated. They were a fair bit more awkward than her regular human hands, and she hoped her smaller thumbs sitting further back wouldn&#39;t case too much trouble with using the remote more. Picking up her phone, she found to her satisfaction that while more difficult to use than before, she could still use it well enough. The thick, hooflike nails took a bit of adjustment though.<br />
<br />
Tricia knew she only had a minute or two before her next round of programed changes kicked in, and she wanted to be back in front of her mirror for them. Sliding off her bed, she very carefully put her altered feet down on the floor. Slowly, she put her weight on her thickened toes, pushing herself up to stand up straight. As she suspected when examining them, her feet remained angled, forcing her to stand on her toes as if she was wearing invisible high heels. Her legs strained a bit with the effort, but she figured that her upcoming changes would solve that. With tentative steps, she tottered over towards the mirror.<br />
<br />
She made it just in time, muscle twitches and creaking sounds erupting from her face as it too began to shift. Her nose and mouth widened slightly, her nostrils flaring as they moved closer to her thickening lips. She bared her teeth, watching as they became larger and thicker. Her tongue began to expand in her mouth, pressing uncomfortably against her teeth and cheeks. She gagged and spluttered slightly, cursing herself for not prioritizing the changes better.<br />
<br />
Thankfully, as the bridge of her nose finished widening, a diffuse pressure slid through her jaw and cheekbones. With sickening crunch that sounded worse than it felt, Tricia felt her face push forward by two inches into a small snout. The release of pressure caused her to sneeze, leaving her chuffing and whinnying lightly as she caught her breath. <br />
<br />
Tricia admired her new reflection with approving eyes, eyes which she realized had changed with the rest of her. The whites had nearly disappeared from view as the irises had expanded in size, their color shifting from black to a pastel lavender color. Peering closer, her expanded nostrils fogging the mirror slightly as they almost pressed into its surface, she saw that her pupils had changed size, looking more horizontal and rectangular in shape.<br />
<br />
The edges of her thick lips crooked upward into a satisfied smile as she took in her new face. Not too human anymore, but not overly animalistic either. Her smile widened as a tingling in her scalp and rustling of her hair. Reaching behind her, she felt thick hair growing down her neck and onto her back. At the same time, the hair on the sides of her head began to recede somewhat, sucking back into her scalp. In a short few moments, the sides of her head were bare, leaving thick, pastel green hair running solely from the top of her head, down the back, over her neck, stopping at her upper back. She whinnied slightly in satisfaction at the sight of her new mane.<br />
<br />
Where the hair remained, it was shorter than before but still quite long and soft. Her mint green tresses on her scalp hung down along one side of her head and were long enough to reach to just past her shoulders. Tricia ran her hands through her thick locks, idly playing with her mane. She ran a finger over her furless equine ears, now exposed on the sides of her head. <br />
<br />
&quot;Perfect&quot; she said to herself in satisfaction, &quot;now just one more round...&quot;<br />
<br />
She had barely said the words when a great rumbling and shifting feeling overtook her. Tricia gasped as her whole form began rippling and morphing in shape. The muscles of her legs, straining with her freshly altered feet, began pulsating and plumping up in size and tone. Her thighs in particular grew thick and powerful, leaving her much more steady on her hooflike toes. Moving upward, her ass quickly packed on muscle, growing thick and shapely with dense muscle and fat. Her hips ached and widening, and the double whammy of this and her expanded ass split her panties, thin wisps of frilly fabric falling down her legs and about her horselike feet. The feeling of her soft tail hairs brushing across her exposed asscheeks was making her tail whip about in excitement.<br />
<br />
Her core and torso tightened, strong muscles clenching into being below a soft but thin layer of fat. She huffed and puffed, heart pumping wildly as her lungs took in greater and greater air, pressing against her ribcage. She clutched at her chest, cursing another error in ordering. With a crunching sound, her chest expanded, making way for her more powerful organs.<br />
<br />
Tricia barely had time to catch her breath before her chest expanded again, or more specifically her breasts. They gurgled as flesh inflated within them, pressing out from a simple B-cup into heavy D-cups. Already strained by her enlarged torso, her bra couldn&#39;t take the enhanced breast flesh, snapping off and leaving thick, peg-like nipples exposed to the air.<br />
<br />
The horsegirl rubbed sensually at them even as shapely muscle wound its way down her arms, moaning involuntarily as the twitching muscle growth made her squeeze her firm tits more intensely. A tingling and aching made itself known in her nethers, and she felt her asshole thicken and press out slightly as the flesh grew darker. She doubled over, a toned arm gripping the side of the mirror for support as her vagina expanded, lips darkening and thickening as well. Her thick legs quivered, nearly causing her to collapse as her abs were clenching and unclenching while her tunnel deepened and widened. Her clit buzzed, and before she knew it a strong orgasm ripped through her.<br />
<br />
She threw her head back and neighed loudly at the pleasurable sensations. So lost in pleasure was Tricia that she didn&#39;t notice as her neck began to thicken and lengthen, stretching her head a good three inches higher into the air, the new shape accenting her mane nicely. As she moaned in pleasure from her orgasm, her voice dropped an octave, becoming duskier.<br />
<br />
The pleasure faded, tiny aftershocks causing twitches all across her new form. Opening her eyes, she regarded herself in the mirror one more time, noticing her lengthened neck and running her hands along it. She could hardly believe the changes she had been able to make, and how fast and easy they had been.<br />
<br />
Tricia smiled and regarded the destroyed bra and panties on her floor before looking over to her discarded clothing. They wouldn&#39;t do, but she could easily make them fit. Why stop there though? She thought to herself. With the remote, the possibilities for outfits were endless. <br />
<br />
She strode over to her desk with long confident strides, her prior discomfort with her form all but gone. Picking it up, she uses her awkwardly shaped hands to sort through the menus, look at her options.</p>
