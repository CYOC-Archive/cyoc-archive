<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff stumbled into the dark and seemingly empty room, his eyes struggling to adjust to the sudden lack of light. As he took a few hesitant steps forward, he felt his foot hit something hard, causing him to stumble and nearly fall.<br />
<br />
Cursing under his breath, Jeff rubbed his shin and looked around, trying to get his bearings. That&#39;s when he saw it – a strange, colorful medieval setting slowly fading into view around him. It was like something out of a computer game, but much more vivid and realistic.<br />
<br />
Looking around in amazement, Jeff couldn&#39;t help but marvel at the intricate details of the setting. From the stone walls to the tapestries hanging on them, everything looked like it had been taken straight out of a fantasy novel.<br />
<br />
Just as he was about to take a step forward to explore further, Jeff heard a sudden knock on the front door. He froze, wondering who could be knocking at the door of a seemingly deserted arcade room.<br />
<br />
For a few moments, there was only silence. Then, the knock came again, more insistent this time. Jeff took a hesitant step towards the door, his heart pounding in his chest.<br />
As Jeff gathered his thoughts, he heard a faint knock on the door. &quot;Come in,&quot; he called out, wondering who could be on the other side.<br />
<br />
The door creaked open, revealing two young squires standing nervously in the doorway. One was tall and slim, while the other was shorter and more robust. They wore simple clothing, like a medieval uniform, and looked like they had just come straight out of a computer game.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello,&quot; the tall squire said, his voice trembling slightly. &quot;I am Arin, and this is my friend, Cael. We&#39;ve been sent to give you this.&quot;<br />
<br />
With a shy smile, he held out a small bracelet made of brightly colored beads. Jeff looked at it curiously, wondering what it was for.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is this for?&quot; he asked, reaching out to take the bracelet from Arin&#39;s outstretched hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a token of our appreciation,&quot; Cael explained, his voice gruff and direct. &quot;We heard that you had stumbled into our world, and we wanted to thank you for being here. The bracelet is a symbol of our friendship and gratitude.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff smiled, touched by the gesture. He had never expected to be welcomed so warmly by the squires, and he was grateful for their kindness.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; he said, slipping the bracelet onto his wrist. &quot;I really appreciate it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff felt a sudden tingling sensation in his wrist as the squires slipped the bracelet onto his wrist. As he looked down, he noticed a strange energy radiating from the beads, pulsing with an otherworldly glow.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, he felt a strange sensation ripple through his body, his limbs stretching and contorting in unfamiliar ways. His clothes started to slide, and he struggled to hold them up as he looked down at his now fur-covered body.<br />
<br />
Jeff had been transformed into an anthropomorphic opossum, just like the squires. He was smaller than he had been before, and his clothes no longer fit him properly.<br />
<br />
The squires seemed unsurprised by his transformation, as if they had expected something like this to happen. They politely looked away as Jeff tried to adjust his clothes, clearly used to these kinds of magical occurrences.<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome, Knight!&quot; Arin said with a wide grin. &quot;You are one of us now!&quot;<br />
<br />
Cael nodded in agreement, his expression serious but friendly. &quot;We need all the help we can get to protect our kingdom from the evil forces that threaten it. Will you join us in our quest?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff hesitated for a moment, still adjusting to his new body and the strange new world around him. But he couldn&#39;t help but feel a sense of excitement and adventure at the prospect of becoming a knight and joining their cause.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; he said, feeling a surge of determination. &quot;I will join you. I will fight to protect this world and its people.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cael bowed before Jeff, his head lowered in a sign of respect. Suddenly, the young squire began to glow with an intense blue light, and his form started to shift and change.<br />
<br />
In an instant, Cael had transformed into a powerful knight&#39;s armor. The medieval-looking armor was painted blue with golden trimmings, and it had a powerful rocket engine on its back. It was an awe-inspiring sight to behold.<br />
<br />
But as soon as the transformation was complete, the armor fell apart, its individual parts clanking as they fell to the ground. Arin couldn&#39;t help snickering at the rather un-elegant transformation.<br />
<br />
Jeff stood there in shock, unable to believe what he had just seen. &quot;WTF? He&#39;s dead now!?&quot; he exclaimed, feeling a surge of panic rising in his chest.<br />
<br />
Arin quickly stepped forward to reassure him. &quot;No, no, don&#39;t worry. Cael can change back at any time whenever he wants. He&#39;s been given that ability to transform this way in order to serve you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff took a deep breath, trying to calm his racing heart. He watched in amazement as Arin began to help him into the suit of armor that was once Cael.<br />
<br />
First, Jeff put on the leather undersuit, which was surprisingly comfortable despite its thickness. Then he carefully donned the body armor, which was heavy and cumbersome but also incredibly sturdy.<br />
<br />
Next came the helmet, which covered his entire head and was equipped with a built-in visor. Jeff could see the world around him in a new light, with enhanced visual capabilities and a heads-up display that showed him important information like his health and weapon levels.<br />
<br />
The boots were next, followed by the gloves, which allowed Jeff to grip his weapons with ease. As he stood up, he could feel the weight of the armor pressing down on him, but he also felt a sense of power and strength that he had never experienced before.<br />
Arin looked at Jeff with a serious expression on his face. &quot;I need to tell you something important,&quot; he said. &quot;As Cael mentioned earlier, we have been given the privilege to be your sword. We may not be able to speak in our forms, but we will guide you through whatever challenges lie ahead.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff listened intently, nodding his head in understanding. He was still getting used to the idea of being a knight, but he knew he could count on Arin and Cael to help him along the way.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Arin offered Jeff a proposition. &quot;If you want, we can do it in a cool way,&quot; he said. &quot;It&#39;ll make the transformation smoother and more elegant.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff was intrigued. &quot;How does it work?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
Arin hesitated for a moment before answering. &quot;Well, it&#39;s a bit... unconventional,&quot; he said. &quot;But if you&#39;re up for it, you can grab me in the crotch area. That&#39;ll trigger the transformation, and it&#39;ll be pretty swift and cool.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff raised an eyebrow, unsure if he wanted to go through with this. But then he thought about how much easier and more efficient it could be, and he nodded his head in agreement.<br />
<br />
He tentatively reached out and grabbed Arin in the crotch area. Suddenly, Arin&#39;s body began to glow with a bright light, and he started to shift and transform.<br />
<br />
Jeff watched in amazement as Arin&#39;s penis transformed into the handle of a sword, while his legs became part of a guard, and the rest of his body became the blade of the sword. It was an incredible sight to behold.<br />
<br />
The sword felt surprisingly light in Jeff&#39;s hand, and he could feel a strange energy pulsing through it. He knew that Arin and Cael were still there, guiding him and giving him strength.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow,&quot; Jeff said, his voice filled with wonder. &quot;This is amazing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff stood in front of the mirror in his new armor, feeling a bit awkward and unsure of himself. Cael and Arin, now transformed into his armor and sword, respectively, nudged him gently until he struck an impressive pose, holding Arin the sword aloft.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Cael and Arin nudged him again, indicating that it was time to try out his rocket pack. Jeff nodded in agreement and headed outside.<br />
<br />
He took a deep breath, feeling a sense of excitement and anticipation building inside of him. He knew that this was his chance to show what he was capable of, to prove that he had what it took to be a true Rocket Knight.<br />
<br />
With a quick motion, he holstered Arin between his armor and the rocket, feeling the weight of the sword pressing against his side. Then he activated his rocket pack, feeling a surge of power as the engine roared to life.<br />
<br />
Jeff felt himself being lifted off the ground, the wind rushing past him as he soared into the sky. He could feel the rocket pack responding to his movements, and he knew that he was in complete control.<br />
<br />
He looped and spun through the air, testing the limits of his armor and feeling a sense of freedom and exhilaration that he had never experienced before.</p>
