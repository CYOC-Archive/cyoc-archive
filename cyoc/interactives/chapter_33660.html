<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Amanda was pissed.  Not only had Suzy gone off the deep end and shot her, she had the gall to look pleased about it.  Feeling her strength returning to her she moved forward and back handed Suzy.  Suzy staggered and wasn't expecting the next open palmed slap that hit her in the breast.  The blow stung and brought tears to her eyes.  Amanda was happy to see them.  Suzy was such a slut that she deserved to be slapped around.  Thinking she could control Amanda, well Suzy was going to learn that Amanda was head bitch around here.<br />
<br />
Suzy looked at Amanda and saw her hair was turning black and she was starting to get thinner.  The wrinkles around her eyes disappeared and her eyes glittered with malice.  While her breasts didn't grow any larger, they started becoming firmer.  Which matched the change that was happening to her ass.  Silver piercings grew out of her on her navel and on her nose.  Amanda grabbed Suzy and pulled her over to the couch so Amanda could put Suzy over her knee.<br />
<br />
&quot;You've been a bad girl Suzy.  I'm going to have to teach you to behave now.&quot;  Amanda pulled down Suzy's pants to reveal a thong that did nothing to cover her rear.  Amanda brought her hand down and spanked Suzy in the rear.  Amanda expected Suzy to try and break free, like the unruly brat she was.  What she didn't expect was for Suzy to cry out with pleasure.  &quot;Yes. Oh, yes. I've been a really bad girl. You should spank me again. I deserve it, can I tell you how much I deserve it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Amanda slapped Suzy across the mouth to get the dumb slut to shut her mouth.  Her lip curling with disdain, she took her free hand, a drop of Suzy blood on it, and pushed it down her pants and began tracing it along her groin.  Then Amanda's clothes began to change so that she was now wearing a leather mini skirt that showed off her thong and her shirt was now a tight corset that pushed at her breasts to make them bigger and her waist thinner.  Amanda was just glad to have better access.  Amanda's mind continued to swirl as she realized that she was getting turned on by this power she had over Suzy.  It was only right that Suzy was punished but why should it be unpleasant for Amanda.<br />
<br />
Wet at the thought, Amanda pulled her hand out and spanked Suzy again.  &quot;Now, slut, you can speak.  If you ever talk again with out my permission then I won't have you in my house. Tell me how you've been a bad girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Amanda, I've been such a bad girl.  I screwed your daughter and she was so wild, that I just knew I wanted to do it again.  She was busy after that so I got to screw Justin but we got interrupted and didn't get to the good part.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amanda grabbed Suzy's nipple and twisted it, causing Suzy to cry out.  &quot;Stupid slut, I gave you permission to talk, not to use my name.  From now on you will address me as Mistress.&quot;  Amanda pulled Suzy up to a sitting position and ripped off Suzy's jacket so she was topless and then pushed her off onto the floor.  &quot;For that I want you to kiss my feet.&quot;  Suzy grabbed hold of Amanda's foot, now wearing 5&quot; stilettos and pulled off the shoes.  Suzy knew she wouldn't please her mistress unless she did more then was asked of her.  Having an idea, Suzy started kissing Amanda's foot, but Suzy did more then that, as she began massaging it with her hands and began gently sliding her tongue across the skin.  Amanda shivered with pleasure, before she addressed Suzy again, &quot;Your doing a beautiful job, slut.  I was going to rake your back with my nails as punishment for screwing my daughter but I think I'll let that pass.  I alway's thought Tiffany needed a good lay, and you saved me the trouble of having to do it myself.  As for your last crime, well what kind of slut are you if you can't finish the job? Maybe I shouldn't bother with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, Mistress, I'm a good slut.  I promise, just give me a chance and I'll show you how good I can be.  I beg of you Mistress, let me have a taste of you.&quot;  Suzy ended her appeal by sliding her hand up Amanda's thigh but was stopped by the iron grip of Amanda.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me make something clear to you, slut.  You are here to please me and you will do nothing unless I tell you to. That's what makes me happy, that's what I get off on.  That I can tell a horny little slut that if she want's the honor of eating me out, then she can only do it when I say so.  And if she's an obedient, submissive, little slut then I'll return the favor.  Aren't I a nice Mistress? Now I want you to eat me out and if I don't orgasm ten times in the next ten minutes then I'll just have to tie you up until I can get my toys out.  I'll enjoy using that vibrator on you.  Its never been quite the same since it blew a fuse after that 3 hour marathon session and now it will gives a wonderful shock every now and then.  I almost soaked myself it was so good.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amanda saw the fear, the humiliation, the lust that was in Suzy's eyes and impulsively Amanda grabbed her slut and pulled her into a tight embrace, kissing her so hard she thought that one of their tongues would be ripped out.  Breaking the lip lock, Amanda whispered, &quot;The clock is ticking, slut.  Show me your worth my time.&quot;</p>
