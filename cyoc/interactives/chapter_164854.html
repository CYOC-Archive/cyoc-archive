<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>I’ve been meaning to add my own chapter to this story for a long time, and I’ve finally gotten around to it. I’ll be working on the next chapter as soon as I can.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alex Mitchell was a freshman at Garrington University in Pennsylvania. He was a rather attractive young man: short brown hair, deep blue eyes, and a decently built athletic frame that he had earned from years of playing various sports. In fact, sports were the whole reason the eighteen year old was at Garrington University in the first place, as he had gotten a full ride in exchange for playing for the university’s football team. <br />
<br />
At the moment, Alex was sitting in one of the college’s lecture halls, listening to the professor drone on and on. The young man hadn’t gotten as much sleep as he had wanted last night, so he was struggling to keep his eyes open. <br />
<br />
As he finally began to doze off, the sound of someone loudly grunting in pain caused him to lift up his head and look around for the source. A few seats down from him, he could see a young man close to his age clutching his face with his hands. As he removed his hands, Alex could tell that something was wrong with the teen. Something about his face didn’t seem quite right. Then, the young man let out a yelp of pain as his jaw and nose jutted out of his face at least an inch. Alex’s eyes widened in shock. Did that really just happen? <br />
<br />
The young man quickly stood up from his seat and grabbed his bag before rushing out of the room. Then, a young man who looked nearly identical to the one who had just run out (minus the strange changes) and a young woman who had been sitting next to them both grabbed their things and followed the other teen. The professor made a halfhearted attempt to stop them before continuing his lecture. <br />
<br />
Alex was wide awake by this point. He wasn’t exactly sure what to make of what happened. Honestly, he felt rather distressed by what he had seen. That guy’s face looked so...inhuman. <br />
<br />
Thirty uneventful minutes passed by slowly before the doors to the lecture hall flew open. Everyone turned their heads to see a male student with red hair stumble into the room before collapsing onto the floor. A few students, including Alex, quickly rushed over to see if the student was okay. As Alex got closer, he could clearly see that the young man had a bloody gash across his back. <br />
<br />
“Get the first aid kit!” he shouted to a nearby student. The student nodded before bolting to the front of the lecture hall in search of a first aid kit. Alex then began to check on the collapsed student. <br />
<br />
“Hey...you with me dude?” Alex asked. “We’re going to get you hell, don’t worry. What did this to you?” <br />
<br />
The student weakly lifted his head to look at Alex. “I...I don’t know…” he said. “I was walking down the path...near the woods...when this...thing...jumped out and scratched me…”<br />
<br />
“What did it look like?” Alex asked, trying to get as much information as he could out of the student. <br />
<br />
“It...it was a huge canine…like a wolf...and it walked on two legs…”<br />
<br />
A male student that was watching laughed. “What? Like a werewolf?” he asked sarcastically. He was going to continue, but a female student standing next to him hit his shoulder. <br />
<br />
Suddenly, the injured student cried out in pain and jerked upright. He began to frantically itch his body all over before grabbing his shirt and tearing it off and beginning to scratch around the gash on his shoulder. Alex began to reach out and grab his hand to stop him, but he stopped himself when he noticed thick, orange hairs beginning to grow in. Then, the student’s mouth and nose jutted out of his face about an inch, just like the other student. Alex recoiled in fear as the student looked to him, tears streaming down his transforming face. <br />
<br />
“You...need...to...RUN!”<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the doors to the lecture hall flew open once again, causing everyone to look up. Standing in the doorway was a massive bipedal canine creature that resembled a wolf. It had a muscular frame that was covered head to toe in thick, grey fur, complete with a tail behind him. The most noteworthy thing about the creature was the massive canine cock between its legs. <br />
<br />
Almost immediately, the wolf pounced on a nearby student, knocking him to the ground. This was enough to make a few students scream in terror before everyone began to rush out the door in an attempt to escape. Alex tried to move with the crowd, but he was pushed to the ground. As he tried to get up, he noticed the wolf looming over the poor student. Alex braced himself for the worst, assuming that he would see the creature feasting on the insides of his fellow classmate. Instead, the young man saw something far from what he expected.<br />
<br />
The wolf had both of its large, paw-like hands on the student’s shoulders, pinning the poor boy to the ground. The student squirmed, trying to escape the creature’s grasp, before the wolf pressed its muzzle against the male’s lips. Alex saw the student’s eyes widen in horror as he frantically tried to get the beast off of him, only for the wolf to force the poor male into a French kiss, its tongue muffling the student’s cries for help. However, after a minute or so, the student’s protests stopped. Alex watched in horror as the male student began to submit to the wolf’s advances, wrapping his arms around the large canine as he tried to get more of the beast’s saliva. The student seemed completely unaware that his ears were beginning to round out and move to the top of his head and tan fur began to grow in. <br />
<br />
Alex realized that he had to do something. The wolf seemed to be too preoccupied with transforming the student to notice him, so he was going to seize this chance. Slowly standing up, the eighteen year old grabbed a nearby backpack and hurled it at the wolf. The backpack hit the wolf’s back, causing the wolf to break the kiss with the student and turn his attention to Alex. <br />
<br />
“Get off him you damn mutt!” Alex shouted. He looked down at the student that the wolf had been pinning down, who seemed to have come to his senses...at least for now. He quickly moved away from the wolf and ran out the doors, leaving Alex alone in the lecture hall with the beast. The wolf, clearly agitated that it wasn’t able to finish transforming the student, growled at Alex and prepared to pounce, only for Alex to throw another backpack at it, causing it to stagger. Seeing this as his chance, Alex bolted out the doors of the lecture hall. <br />
<br />
Alex ran down the school hallway as fast as he could, not stopping for anyone or anything. When he was halfway to the door that led outside, he heard the doors to the lecture hall open once again, followed by the sound of claws hitting the cold, vinyl floor. Alex didn’t need to look over his shoulders to know that the wolf was chasing him. As soon as he reached the doors at the end of the hall, the young man threw them open before pushing them shut behind him. As he turned around and prepared to run and hide, Alex saw something that made his blood run cold. <br />
<br />
There wasn’t just one beast….there were multiple.<br />
<br />
Different types of creatures were prowling the large open field in the middle of the campus. All around him, students were being forced into sex by the beasts. To his left, a large anthropomorphic white tiger was going to town on a male student, who seemed to have given up all hopes of escape and just cried as the tiger raped him. Across from him, a snow leopard was mounting a female student who was still trying to resist. To his right, another female student seemed to have completely given in to everything that was happening, as she was currently eating out a rather well endowed anthropomorphic vixen. When she looked up and began to make out with the vixen, Alex could clearly see that her face was beginning to push out into a muzzle. <br />
<br />
Alex tried to tell himself to run, but his legs wouldn’t respond due to them being completely frozen in fear. It wasn’t until he felt something, or someone, collide with him at full speed, knocking him down onto the grass. He couldn’t see who or what had pushed him, but he soon found out when a large pair of clawed, paw-like hands grabbed the male’s side and flipped him onto his back before pinning his shoulders down. <br />
<br />
Looming over him was none other than the wolf from earlier. It let its gaping maw hang open, showing the male its sharp, fang-like teeth. Saliva dripped from its mouth and onto Alex’s face. The male turned his head away so it wouldn’t get in his mouth before trying to escape, only for the wolf to growl at him. <br />
<br />
“Oh God, what am I going to do?!” Alex thought to himself. “Do I even try fighting this thing? Or do I just...submit?”</p>
