<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ethan was so focused on his videogame that he didn&#39;t notice his last change was actually activated and it was affecting several guys in a near area. Because he was in a college dorms, practically all the guys were way beyond puberty and the sudden wouldn&#39;t affect them. However, they will still grow their balls and dick&#39;s to match Paul&#39;s. It was so subtle that nobody can notice for now and when they realize it, it&#39;ll be too late.<br />
<br />
Even Ethan&#39;s balls were swelling, but as he was only wearing briefs and he was still too focused on his game, he didn&#39;t notice anything but a slight discomfort that he associated with wearing old clothing. He thought that maybe later he would make some changes to his wardrobe and maybe all the males... He&#39;s still getting ideas for his new magic app.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, on another dorm, Travis was babysitting his little brother for that night. His parents went to a wedding with no kids allowed and they asked Travis to take care of 10 years old Henry. Henry didn&#39;t like to stay with his big brother, Travis was mean to him and he was always trying to humiliate him. That&#39;s why Henry grew up being shy about his body and considering his brother as a nasty and dirty person.<br />
<br />
In Henry&#39;s eyes, Travis was the typical muscle head who smelled like a locker room, his feet almost as big as clown smelled like old cheese and he was always covered in sweat. To make it worse, his body was covered in messy hairs that was displeasing to see, and he didn&#39;t cares. Travis hairy armpits were always on display as well as the hair on his legs, feet and, unfortunately for Henry, the pubes protruding from his crotch and going upward to his belly.<br />
<br />
In fact, Travis was actually wearing just his boxer briefs while he was watching a movie. So, Henry can see all those disgusting things if he just glanced at him. Of course, Henry was trying to be focused on his phone where he was watching some gameplays from his favorite games. They didn&#39;t talk to each other for hours, except for the occasional things that Travis told Henry trying to make fun of him. But the boy just ignored him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you wanna hear something good?&quot; Travis asked his little bother, but Henry didn&#39;t answer. He just slowly raised his sight from his phone and when Travis noticed he got Henry&#39;s attention, he let out a noisy and disgusting fart that left a nasty smell on the room. Henry started to cough while he uses a hand to dispel the smell. &quot;You&#39;re a nasty idiot.&quot; Henry replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Be a man, little bro.&quot; Travis said. &quot;Do you think you&#39;ll be a pristine boy all your life? One day you&#39;ll become a smelly machine like me.&quot; Henry didn&#39;t reply but those words were exactly why he tried so hard to be so different from his brother. And he was making a good job, until now because he hadn&#39;t started puberty yet. And those changes would be maximized by Ethan&#39;s actions.<br />
<br />
The next day, Henry&#39;s parents came after him and they invited Henry and Travis to go the beach with them. Travis said yes almost immediately, but Henry hesitated. It wasn&#39;t like he could say no, because he can stay alone at home. But he wasn&#39;t very happy at the idea of watching his brother showing off his hairy jock body, and by the way his dad&#39;s dad bod. He was utterly embarrassed before even arriving to the beach.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, we don&#39;t have swimming trunks.&quot; Henry said in an attempt to cancel the beach trip. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, honey. I bought some for dad, Travis and you.&quot; Henry&#39;s mother said while she gave them a small fabric thing. &quot;A speedo?&quot; Travis asked while he looked at the red cloth in his hands. It seems he didn&#39;t like it too much either, but their father was pretty excited sporting his black speedo that left nothing to imagination.<br />
<br />
&quot;Change your clothes. We&#39;re leaving in 5 minutes.&quot; Their father said and both Travis and Henry reluctantly agreed. 10 minutes later, the whole family were in the car going to the beach. All the males wearing nothing but their small speedos and Henry doing his best to don&#39;t look at Travis or his dad. &quot;Hey, maybe you think I&#39;m some kind of exhibitionist but I have my limits too...&quot; Travis told Henry while they stayed in the back seats.<br />
<br />
They arrived at the beach, there&#39;s a lot of people, mostly young men and women around Travis&#39; age because the beach wasn&#39;t too far from the campus. As soon as they arrived, Travis found some friends and he went to hangout with them. Henry&#39;s parents were looking for a spot to place their stuff while Henry decided to explore the shore. Actually, he was looking for a place with no people where he could stay.<br />
<br />
After walking for a while, he didn&#39;t find that place, but he was also too far from his parents. He thought it was time to go back with them when something weird started to happen inside him. He didn&#39;t know it but, like a Pokemon, he&#39;s going to evolve. At first he thought he&#39;s sick, so he begin to walk to the nearest restroom, but after a few step he felt so uncomfortable that he began to groan in pain. Fortunately, he didn&#39;t get too much attention.<br />
<br />
Henry looked down and find the bulge on his tiny speedo enlarging. Not only that, but his crotch was tingling like tiny ants on his skin. Those little ants were quickly moving through his small penis and his still undropped scrotum. He considered himself a smart boy, so he thought it was the inevitable, he was finally hitting puberty. His testicles had start to produce sperm and he&#39;s going to turn into a nasty young man like his brother.<br />
<br />
Henry testicles finally dropped but they didn&#39;t stopped growing, they were going to be as big as bull&#39;s balls according to Ethan. Then, his hairless crotch began to get some hair until he was sporting a little bush that kept growing out as his belly button produces a hairy trail that attaches it. No sooner does Henry&#39;s scrotum gain pubic hair afterward. All the while that occurs, his soft dick hits four inches, and it’s not going to stop there.<br />
<br />
With his penis arriving to eight-inches, it promptly regrew a long loose foreskin. Finally, his ten-inch penis was too much for his speedo and it started to rip off. Henry covered his privates in shame as fast as he could but he can&#39;t do much more because so testosterone was flowing throughout his entire frame, and his mind was dizzy.<br />
<br />
Normally, Henry would’ve disliked to see something as disgusting in public, but for a moment, it seemed like his body was moving by its own. Without a second thought, he put his hands on his already brick-hard dick and he vigorously stroke it. &quot;Oh fuck! This is so bad, but why does it still feel so good?&quot; He thought while the pleasure swallowed his mind. &quot;This is why Travis love to have sex all the time?&quot;<br />
<br />
Because of this overpowering nature, he loudly yelp out of pleasure. While one of his hands is busy rubbing his newly grown shaft up and down, unwrapping his foreskin, while the other focuses on caressing his hefty testicles. During that, his cries of pleasure become more virile than the last because of his developing adam’s apple.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, Henry&#39;s jawline strengthens as it becomes prominent. His nose coincidentally widens to enlarge his nostrils. His lips harden and it isn’t long before facial hair spikes out from his manly face. In contrast, the hair from his scalp retreats giving him a very short haircut. Additionally, his eyebrows thicken, and his forehead widens.<br />
<br />
Henry&#39;s limbs subsequently follow along by embracing their new muscles. His hands start to grow bigger each time his dick throbs, leaving him with a manly pair of fists. His forearms bulk and his biceps follow suit as his shoulders widen. His backside thickened and soon, his rear gets supplied with solid muscle.<br />
<br />
His calves contrarily get the more noticeable muscles as they simply bulge out. Henry&#39;s feet similarly expand until they&#39;re as big and nasty as Travis. The fear on Henry&#39;s face exponentially increased when thick black curly hairs began to poke out around his armpits, forearms, and legs. Given him the same disgusting look that he disliked so much on his brother. He can smell the same locker room scent emanating from his hairy pores.<br />
<br />
As Henry&#39;s transformation hits its final stage, he managed that one of his hands stops fondling his hairy bull balls, but his other hand accelerates, making his veiny cock pulsate even more. His spine had drastically lengthened until his height was nearly seven feet tall. From there, his nipples darken while his chest develops powerful pectorals.<br />
<br />
His belly feels a pumping sensation, and, sure enough, his tummy is forming an amazing eight-pack stomach that was quickly covered in hair at the same time some chest hair turns up across Henry&#39;s meaty pecs. At once, he profoundly bellow as he hit climax. Semen rushes out of his cock like water from a fountain. That is easily going to be the best orgasm he ever had.<br />
<br />
At this point, his mind was returning to normal and realized in utterly shame what he had just done, he was trembling in fear at the new body he has. Ironically looking a lot like the kind of people he dislikes most, his brother. His dick was getting soft but it was still abnormally huge and his balls looked more bestial than human. Despite he has already touched himself, he was still incredibly horny. So, he only had two possible paths to take.</p>
