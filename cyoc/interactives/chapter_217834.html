<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jack’s mind was racing as he slowly followed behind Zane, a flurry of thoughts passing through his head before each one was chased away by a sharp tug of his leash.<br />
<br />
<i>What are those vials going to do to m-</i> <b>*TUG*</b><br />
<br />
“No dawdling, pet,” Zane cooed as Jack picked up the pace, a warm blush forming on his cheeks at the mere word ‘<i>pet</i>’.<br />
<br />
<i>Damn it, why the hell do am I enjoying this so m- </i><b>*TUG*</b><br />
<br />
Thought after thought was chased away by the maddening tension of the leash, leaving Jack with nothing to do but simply follow in the rabbit’s footsteps and occasionally glance down to watch that little fluffy tail of Zane’s wag alluringly from side to side.<br />
<br />
Zane opened the door to his bedroom and pulled Jack inside, and for a moment Jack felt a sense of relief at being in a (relatively, at least) familiar place, which made his racing heartbeat slow down to a less frantic pace. There was just <i>something</i> about this room which was calming his nerves, though Jack couldn’t exactly say what it was.<br />
<br />
As Jack looked around the room with a slightly slack-jawed look on his face, Zane watched his new pet human with amusement. Jack’s ears twitched slightly, only picking up a few sounds as the rabbit murmured under his breath. “<i>...working… -remones… response…</i>” was all Jack could understand before Zane noticed him eavesdropping and clamped his muzzle shut.<br />
<br />
“Naughty habit, Jack. Although, as a rabbit I suppose I know that you can’t always help overhearing things,” Zane chuckled, waggling his long ear playfully before sitting down at the edge of his bed. Without even thinking, Jack sat down on the floor next to the bed, right at his master’s feet. “Good boy, Jack. Not even jumping up on the bed, even though I’m sure you’d love to be in bed with me, wouldn’t you?”<br />
<br />
“Y-yes, master,” Jack replied quietly, embarrassed at how effortlessly the words slipped from his mouth. But Zane didn’t pursue the topic any further, merely smiling and nodding approvingly before reaching over and gently scratching Jack behind the ears, his mere touch sending a shiver of pleasure down his pet’s spine.<br />
<br />
“...Want to play a game again, Jack? Question for question?”<br />
<br />
Truth be told, Jack was so full of questions he wanted answered that he wasn’t sure if he could even ask them all, especially if each query was followed up by another of Zane’s teasing, erotic follow-ups. But, he just <i>had</i> to know what was coming for him, so he nodded and began to ask his first question, but Zane tapped a fuzzy finger against Jack’s lips to quiet him.<br />
<br />
“No, no, I think I’ll go first this time,” Zane sighed as he continued to stroke Jack’s hair, paying close attention to the even-so-slight signs that Jack’s ears were beginning to warp and change beneath his fingers. “...Let me see here… Ah, I think I know… When we were in town, and you saw all those other humans that had been changed… How did you feel? Spare no details, I want to know everything.”<br />
<br />
Jack bit his lip, trying to hold back his own unwilling honesty, but his compulsion to follow Zane’s will made the words spill out of his mouth uncontrollably. “...It was scary, knowing you could do that to me. It’s weird, knowing anything about me could just… go away. Turn into something else…,” Jack said quietly as Zane listened in silence. “B-but… It’s also kinda thrilling. When I was a kid, I always got a… umm… D-do I really need to say…?”<br />
<br />
“You do, pet. Keep going,” Zane prompted, affectionately stroking his fingers under Jack’s chin.<br />
<br />
“...Stories about people turning into other things always got me really excited. Movies, books, games, that sort of thing,” Jack finally managed to say, his skin lobster-red with embarrassment at having let that slip. Somehow, he knew Zane was filing that one away to use against him later. But he just kept on pressing on, even as his blush grew red-hot. &quot;So, seeing all those other humans... I-I thought it was sort of... sexy. Being turned into something else, even against your will...&quot;<br />
<br />
“Didn’t know that humans told stories like that. Fascinating,” Zane replied curiously. “I always thought they just liked being human too much to ever think about being anything else. They certainly complain enough whenever we make modifications to them to give us that idea, at least.”<br />
<br />
“That’s just because we don’t like it when-” Jack started to protest, but another gentle tug on his leash was enough to silence him.<br />
<br />
“Simmer down, Jack. I’m sure you’re starting to understand by now, but what you <i>like</i> doesn’t matter much here,” Zane said sternly, but with a tinge of sadness lurking just underneath the surface of his words. “...Now, it’s your turn. Ask your question.”<br />
<br />
“...The vials. What did they do to me?” Jack asked. The question was both curious and worried, but to Zane’s sensitive rabbit ears he could already hear the curiosity overtaking the fear.<br />
<br />
“Skipping right to the heart of the matter, are you? Not one for surprises, I see,” Zane teased. “Hmm… How to put this…? Perhaps its better to show you than to just tell you.”<br />
<br />
Chuckling to himself, the rabbit reached down with one paw and slipped it under his athletic shorts, biting his lip as he began to cup his furry balls and stroke his cock slowly. After a couple of moments, he withdrew his paw and presented it to Jack, who curiously leaned forward, his nostrils flaring out as he detected the strong scent of rabbit musk sticking to Zane’s fingers.<br />
<br />
A wave of heat flowed over Jack’s body, sweat pouring from his skin as the scent stuck to the back of his nose. The scent was all that he could imagine; the room around him seemed to fade away into nothingness, leaving only himself, his master, and that delightful musk wafting past his nose. He could already feel himself growing rock-hard under his shorts, the tip of his cock pressing insistently against the fabric and leaving a damp spot of precum. Without even thinking, Jack opened his mouth and leaned even farther forward, his tongue lolling as he eagerly, desperately tried to suck the moist sweat from Zane’s paw.<br />
<br />
“...Not quite yet, Jack. Don’t want to ruin your appetite before dinner,” Zane laughed, pulling his paw away. Jack let out a whine as the musky scent faded, and after a moment he regained his senses and realized just how out of it he had been.<br />
<br />
“W-what… what was…?”<br />
<br />
“The vial did that. You see, it&#39;s not enough to just transform your ears or your nose by themselves. Your senses themselves got a little bit of a tune-up to bring them up to anthro levels, adding new nerve endings and sensory organs to replace what you had before. Us anthros, we use our senses for a lot of different things,” Zane said as he wiped his paw on the bedsheets to dissipate his musk a little bit. “Scents, subtle sounds, body language, and even taste, they’re a part of our language just as much as words are. If you couldn’t understand them, you’d be as good as a blind, deaf slave. And considering what I have in mind for you, that just wouldn’t do…”<br />
<br />
As Zane explained, Jack was suddenly aware of the gentle scent that permeated nearly everything in the bedroom, the same musk that he’d just smelled on Zane’s paw was diffused everywhere in the room and to a lesser extent in the entire farmhouse. It was what he had detected upon entering the room, the scent that had put his mind at ease and calmed him down.<br />
<br />
“S-so I’ve got super senses now… That’s actually kind of cool,” Jack replied through heavy breaths, growing slowly more used to the improved senses that the vial had granted to him.<br />
<br />
“...You really are a weirdo, aren’t you? Most human’s don’t call it ‘<i>cool</i>’ after their first mod,” Zane snickered as he resumed stroking his transforming new pet. “Hell, we sometimes have to restrain them for a few days until everything’s done…”<br />
<br />
“Okay, but that’s just one modification, right? There were three vials, so what about-”<br />
<br />
“Ah-ah-ah, that’s your one question. You need to leave me a couple of surprises to spring on you, Jack,” Zane smirked and tapped his chin thoughtfully, wondering how he next wanted to play with his new toy. He wanted Jack to figure out the rest all on his own, so he was going to try to keep his lips sealed for a bit longer, difficult as that might be for the playful rabbit...</p>
