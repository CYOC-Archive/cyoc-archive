<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer had a random thought. If she was travelling back in time it must mean people she knew would travel back with her. Maybe it was only her age that was changing. Jennifer chuckled. There was no way she would cause permanent harm to herself by her own actions. That was impossible. Jennifer believed that there was no way the Glendale curse was able to bend reality. This thing was going to be a piece of cake for her as got inside the bus.<br />
<br />
The school was challenging for an eight grader with high schoolers mind. Lot&#39;s of physical activity and some of math problems she hadn&#39;t thought writing again in her life. Jennifer had forgotten how much she hated doing all this. Too much unnecessary work with no connection to the real life. The school lunch was hell as well as the bracers was attracting all sorts of small pieces of foods. Annoying. <br />
<br />
Alex, a student who claimed to be on the same class as Jennifer was, joined the table with her and offered Jennifer a candybar and energy drink. She accepted them and ate it small piece of choco in one chomp while she pocketed the energy drink on to her backpack. On the next recess behind the school building near the empty gardening shed, as both of them were sipping on the sugarfree energy drinks, Alex asked from Jenni if she wanted to come and visit his house after the school. It was obvious that the boy had a crush for her. Jennifer had no time for romance but decided to use his gullibility to her own benefit. Maybe he could be her lackey if she played her cards right and kept a carrot in front of him without every giving it to him. Like she was getting royal treatment from the boy. Alex just kept handing Jennifer all sorts of sweet things without even asking.<br />
<br />
Jennifer looked at the boy and asked if he wanted to drink the rest of the energy drink while waving the almost empty can in front of him. The boy got ecstatic and Jennifer saw how his mouth and eyes made a visible O-shapes. Jennifer smiled and made a demand that she wanted to boy to drink it while he was a stool for her sore legs. It seem that Alex didn&#39;t think but was already on all fours on the ground as Jennifer sat on top of him while pouring the contents of the energy drink in to his mouth. Jennifer was enjoying herself. She could still boss people around and be the most annoying prick in existence to others. If and only if she just found people who enjoyed it and didn&#39;t find it offensive. There must be sickos like Alex who would do anything for their queen even if she spat on their faces. If she acted nice on the surface and masked her true feelings. While keeping all this behind the closed doors. There was no way the curse would affect her, right?<br />
<br />
While sitting with her full weight on top of Alex. Jennifer sent a text to her mom that she was heading to her friend&#39;s place. Explaining that she felt tired from all the physical activity she had to do today. Alex commented how cute Jennifer&#39;s background picture was as it had a picture of her german shepherd Tex. Jennifer knew that Alex tried to act and be nice around her to win her over. Sadly for Alex, Jennifer had no intentions going further than this and enjoyed the presense of a simp who treated his crush like a queen. The recess was over and both of them went back to the class like nothing had happened.<br />
<br />
&quot;So your mom&#39;s okay that you are coming to over my place?&quot; Alex confirmed as the school day had ended. Both of them already sitting on the bus and driving past Jennifer&#39;s house. Jennifer explained to Alex that her mother understands that you get to experience the eight grade just once. Alex was confused what Jennifer meant by that while Jennifer kept munching on the sweets that Alex kept pulling out of his bag for her. Jennifer always had a sweet tooth and the peasant must give his queen a tribute whenever she demands it.<br />
<br />
Alex didn&#39;t live that far away and thought that it was an rough thirty minute walk if she wanted to get back to her home. The insides of Alex&#39;s home were barren. Floor had visible big rectangle sized spots and it was clear that some of the furniture was lacking it&#39;s counterparts as if they were taken. The brand new unopened cardboard boxes near the front door were telling that Alex was currently living with a single parent like Jennifer was. The things that were left in the house looked expensive and masculine as if they belongs to Alex&#39;s dad. Jennifer didn&#39;t want to make assumptions but it was clear that Alex&#39;s mom was taking advantage of his husbands big hefty wallet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad&#39;s gonna be home super late so... If you want? We can do whatever you&#39;d like to do.&quot; Alex smiled while handing the reigns<br />
to Jennifer.</p>
