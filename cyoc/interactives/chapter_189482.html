<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After work, the two guys drove to their own homes, agreeing to meet at the gym an hour later. Colt was the first to arrive, finding himself excited to see his new boyfriend work out, and horny to watch his muscles pump from the workout. Jack arrived 15 minutes after the designated time, wearing a blue hoodie for the Colts football team (a subtle joke from Colt), and black shorts. If he didn’t know any better, Colt would swear that Jack was just a guy with broad shoulders under that hoodie. Jack had his hood up, looking around nervously as he approached Colt. Colt chuckled and pulled Jack’s hood down, starting him. “Look, I know you’re nervous, but don’t be. Probably a third of the guys in here are newbies just like you.” Jack nodded sheepishly as he looked around, surveying the other people in the gym.<br />
There were a couple typical gym nuts, flexing for themselves in the mirror. On the treadmills was a line of what looked like moms, but one in the middle was definitely a guy. Over in a corner were a couple larger people who, Jack decided, had just become fat or gained a passion for exercise. There was one very skinny guy in the middle who was acting overly toxic to anyone that approached. With the Glitch, a lot of people were out of their elements now, and Jack was no different.<br />
Colt took Jack through several workouts, starting with the weight that Colt could lift and working their way up to find what Jack could do. In most cases, Jack would lift double, sometimes even triple what Colt could! Colt was impressed, and found himself enjoying having a gym buddy. He found himself looking over at the other muscular men in the gym from time to time, but he never found himself that turned on. Colt supposed that was because he always needed an emotional connection with his girlfriends before, and assumed this was no different. <br />
Eventually, they had both worked up a sweat, and Jack’s sweat was even starting to darken his hoodie around the armpits, upper chest, and lower back. Colt figured this was the time to remove the hoodies, and got very excited thinking about how Jack would look. Colt started, revealing his slightly hairy stomach before his shirt draped back down. Jack could see abs peeking through Colt’s stomach, and his chest was wet with sweat which, combined with Colt’s heavy breathing and the pump from the workout, made Jack start to get hard. After straightening out his sweaty shirt, he looked toward Jack expectantly. Jack shifted nervously as he looked around, making sure Colt was the only one looking, before starting to lift off his own hoodie.<br />
Jack struggled a bit to get the bottom past his large chest, but once he did, he threw the hoodie onto the ground victoriously, his muscles on full display. Jack’s whole body glistened with sweat that had also soaked parts of Jack’s tight tank top, which clung tightly to every part of Jack’s body. Jack’s chest had indeed grown from the pump, causing the elastic fabric to strain trying to contain them. His arms had veins popping out of every place they could, emphasizing the sheer size of his almost basketball-sized biceps. Jack’s abs were even more pronounced than before, and as Jack pulled up his shirt to examine them, he saw how large they were and how tightly they pushed against his stomach. <br />
Jack began to look to a mirror, flexing for himself with pride. Colt, however, felt his dick reach its full length and as Jack flexed, Colt felt precum begin to dribble down the inside of his leg. He needed Jack, and he needed him now. Colt quickly rushed over to Jack and planted his face firmly between Jack’s pecs, feeling them rise and fall as Jack breathed. Colt pulled himself off unwillingly and looked at Jack with lust. Jack looked around and found the locker room entrance, leading Colt into a private changing room. As soon as the door closed, Colt began to pull at Jack’s tank top, trying to expose all of Jack’s rock hard body for him. After succeeding, Colt began to kiss and massage Jack’s chest, which felt even better post workout. Jack moaned loudly, forgetting where he was. Colt began to make his way down, before eventually beginning to tug at Jack’s shorts. Jack stepped back and asked, “Are you sure you want this?” Colt nodded eagerly. “Yes daddy, I want this.” Colt realized, in that moment, what he wanted. He wanted Jack to be his muscle daddy, serving and pleasuring him how Jack wanted him to. As he processed this, he realized how right it felt as he pulled down Jack’s shorts, his boner springing up to hit Colt.<br />
Colt looked for a second before looking up at Jack, as if asking for permission. Jack nodded and Colt placed Jack’s cock into his mouth, working his way up and down, his hands feeling at the large muscles on Jack’s thighs and ass. Jack began to grab at Colt’s head, messing up Colt’s hair as Colt continued to focus on Jack’s cock. As Jack came from the pleasure, Colt himself came in his shorts. Colt swallowed Jack’s cum and relished in its taste.<br />

The two guys cleaned themselves up, Colt insisting on washing Jack’s body for him. When they were done, Jack finally asked, “So… daddy, huh?” Colt swallowed air. “ Is that okay? I know I’m technically older, but it just felt… right. Like you’re my muscle daddy and I just want to help you and please you and… it just felt right.” Jack chuckled. “I guess given the situation, it’s ok. Just not in public, even after we come out, okay?” Colt nodded eagerly.</p>
