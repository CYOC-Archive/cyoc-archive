<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Finally free and finally able to do as you please, you decide it was time to depart this little, cramped ice cave of a store. You walk over to the frozen witch and give her one, final, long, passionate kiss on the lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, my prize,&quot; You say after you break the kiss, &quot;I will return for you... After I&#39;ve found a nice, cold place to keep you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Of course, the witch says nothing in return; forever frozen in a state of sexual bliss; fingers trapped in her icy snatch. You chuckle to yourself and wonder what it would be like to have an entire gallery of such erotic pieces to yourself, but for now you simply want out of there. Taking the book in hand (Because leaving the Tome there would be the single most idiotic thing you could do), you walk to the frozen-over door and wave your hand in front of it. The ice fuses to the door to turn it into an ornate and beautifully-carved door made of ice that opens up; letting you out into the mall.<br />
<br />
At this point, a number of people have already gathered around the store. Apparently they had heard the commotion going on inside, and came to see what was up. As you exited the store, you looked about at the people. They were all staring at you; some in interest, some in confusion, and some giving you a look of disgust as they covered the eyes of their children. Many had their phones out; filming and taking pictures of you to post online, but to be honest you really didn&#39;t care. You had the power to turn them all to ice with a snap of your fingers, so anything they did or said or thought meant very little to you so long as they stayed out of your way. Every step you took through that mall was a refreshing one as you reveled in your freedom. Your mind was filled with all kinds of ideas and possibilities for what you could do now that you had your life to yourself.<br />
<br />
But as you exit the Mall, and look up to the clear blue sky and the bright sun, a strange feeling comes over you. You feel the heat of the sun wash over your frigid form, and you start to feel a bit weaker... And start to feel unsteady. You put a hand to your forehead and you can feel a wetness; the frost on your skin was melting.<br />
<br />
&quot;H-Huh? W-Wha... What&#39;s going on? I... I feel so... So weak...&quot;<br />
<br />
You find it hard to stand and suddenly drop to your knees; panting heavily as it feels like the strength is draining from your being. <br />
<br />
&quot;Haaah.... Ahhhhnnn.... Nnnngh... N-No... I... What? I... I feel so... So w-weak... My strength is... It&#39;s fading... I&#39;m... I&#39;m melting!&quot;<br />
<br />
And indeed, a puddle of water appeared under you. It seemed that you hadn&#39;t just become a being who wielded ice, but a being of ice itself. And ice plus the hot summer sun did not seem to meld well. Parts of your body were beginning to shrink as you slowly melted away; your hips and thighs growing thinner, and your breasts shrank down as well. Your hair also began to melt off your head; slowly getting shorter. The confidence that you once had was starting to fade as you realized that you could very well die if you didn&#39;t cool down and soon!<br />
<br />
But as you panted and panicked, you would notice the Tome of Everfrost in front of you; having dropped it before when you collapsed. Struggling though you were, you realized that the book was your only chance of survival in this heat. And so, without hesitation, you reached over and opened it up; flipping through the pages as you melt further. Eventually, though, you find a spell that can make it snow, and quickly read the spell aloud.<br />
<br />
&quot;S-Skies of steel, dark as... as n-night... Frigid g-gales and f-fields of white... Let warmth and the S-Summer sun&#39;s blight... Be banished now by Winter&#39;s might!&quot;<br />
<br />
The moment the spell is cast, though, you are unable to keep your eyes open anymore as you pass out; falling into the puddle of water that was once part of your body; completely drained. And for a moment, it looked like you had failed....<br />
<br />
But just then... A chilled wind began to blow and brushed over you. The moment it did, you felt a bit of your strength return and were able to open your eyes. Slowly but surely you would push yourself over onto your back, and looked up at the skies to see that clouds had begun to form; slowly taking over the skies as the sun would disappear behind them. A low rumble could be heard in the distance as the air seemed to grow colder by the second, and a few flakes of snow would fall from the sky. All around you the people would look up to notice this out-of-season snowfall begin themselves, and they began to chat among themselves about it; some people finding this quite amusing.<br />
<br />
However, their amusement would be cut short as the temperature quickly dipped to sub-freezing levels and the winds and snow blew harder. Panicked cries could be heard as the people began to scatter; it getting far colder than their summer outfits would let them resist as they desperately searched for the warmth of their cars or the indoors. Those who could not would find themselves slowly freezing in the magic blizzard that you cast.<br />
<br />
You, however, sigh a sigh of relief as you can feel the water that melted off of you slowly soak back into your being as your bodyparts that melted slowly begin to restore themselves. Your energy and your strength slowly return as you stand. You hold your arms out and let the icy winds blow against you; sighing comfortably as you do. &quot;Ahh.... So much better! So glad I found that spell; I would have died under that disgusting summer sun if not for it.&quot;<br />
<br />
You look to the book, and find the spell again. Now that you have a moment, you are able to read about the spell properly, and that&#39;s when you notice it.<br />
<br />
&quot;...This spell... It doesn&#39;t just make it snow; but literally BANISHES summer in an area altogether...&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking up and around, you watch the humans around you struggle to find warm places to hide, only to be consumed by the blizzard you have summoned; freezing into living ice statues just like the witch in the impossible cold that you summoned. And as you watched, you couldn&#39;t help but enjoy their struggle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Seems as though I have inadvertently turned this city into my own paradise,&quot; you muse, &quot;...My paradise, and Human-kind&#39;s frozen Hell... How very interesting... I wonder what I should do now that the city is practically mine?&quot;</p>
