<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tom clenched his chest in his hands and had a pained look on his face.  There was a cracking and shifting noise that the Madame could not seem to find the source of until she turned Tom around.  Above his ass was a stuck up, fluffed with dark brown and white, and flicking, was a deer&#39;s distinct tail.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very interesting, Tom,&quot; she said, giving him a pat on the arm.  He winced and blushed, feeling something odder happening.  Other changes began, curling his ears upwards through his hair that had only recently grown back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yeah,&quot; he stammered nervously, trying to cross his legs and only catches the Madame&#39;s ire. Moving to stand nearly on him, she moves her arm behind his back before violently bending him forward.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I think Tom is hiding a secret,&quot; teases the Madame, her fingers now teasing the sweating flesh of Tom&#39;s ass.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, no, stop, not here,&quot; Tom was pleading but it was all drained out when she pulled his ass cheeks apart.<br />
<br />
Gone were those massive boar&#39;s balls and even his modest normal ones.  White fur was spreading over his ass which cracked and shifted as his hips took to a more four legged position, causing Tom to cry out and keep his balance on hands and feet.  Displayed to everyone was his swollen doe&#39;s sex that looked to have just pulled the remainder of Tom&#39;s testicles in while his cock was lost in the leather area at his waist that was growing its first teats.<br />
<br />
As laughter and jeers let out, Tom started to tear up and I watched him panic as he watched his arms grow longer, but thinner, the bones cracking and shifted while he let out a loud bestial noise.  I could see his nose had darkened a good deal too and his eyes looked so wide.<br />
<br />
&quot;And to think he was my boar!  The nerve he had coming up here to suggest that!&quot; The Madame goaded the crowd out.  I saw Tom looking back at them all, laughing while his tail just flicked and his fingers were starting to merge and cramp.<br />
<br />
I grunt and almost feel sorry for him.<br />
<br />
She goes closer to him and I&#39;m able to hear a sad thing.<br />
<br />
Tom was sniffling, still changing, when I heard him ask, &quot;Please, all my groomsmen are here... my fiance&#39;s brothers... I can&#39;t live this down just... just make it last, ok?  I don&#39;t wanna go back.&quot;  The words were driven by fear but I could get it.<br />
<br />
The Madame gave him a kiss on the cheek as his snout was starting to form and back away.<br />
<br />
There was a gust of wind that blew the flaps of the tent open.  People gasped at the sudden sight of the large animal, a buck, trotting in from the night and up the aisle.  They were all stunned, lost at was happening, but I knew.  So did Tom.<br />
<br />
He looked and saw the buck coming, it&#39;s tongue out and licking the air that his, well, her ass was scenting.  He looked at me and there was emptiness in his eyes.<br />
<br />
The snout of the buck was at him quick, and I could now see the length that had been added his his neck when Tom&#39;s head sprung up.  The long red member of the buck was already out when he was on the back of him.  He was still almost human except where it mattered to the buck when he was first taken.  With every inch that was shoved into Tom&#39;s new doe cunt, I watched his face push out into a matching doe&#39;s muzzle.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; I hear him moan as the changes seem to accelerate as he&#39;s literally fucked into a doe.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;are ya doing?!  He&#39;s supposed to marry our sister in two days!&quot; protests one of Tom&#39;s wedding party as they watch the person that had been a groom getting mated in front of their very eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Seems nature decided he&#39;s better suited for a doe&#39;s life.  It&#39;s best to tell his dear love that he ran off or got cold feet.  The reality,&quot; she paused.  I looked at Tom and his body was losing quickly with no semblance of manhood on him while his body was more animal that human.  His head was completely changed, his eyes closed and I could only sweat a smile on his lips.  &quot;The reality is, he just got bred.&quot;  On cue the buck bucked and finished the job.<br />
<br />
The doe under him panted.  Eyes open, there was no look of humanity in the any longer and that was confirmed when they two mates darted out of the tent.<br />
<br />
&quot;The night just gets more interest!&quot; she declares just as people regain their composure.</p>
