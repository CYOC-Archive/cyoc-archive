<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Yes?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is going to sound real crazy,&quot; Becky said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Becky, not too long ago, I gave myself a pair of boobs, then turned you into a man and me into a woman and well, you know the rest,&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
Becky laughed. &quot;This takes it one step further.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Go on,&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've always wanted to see Australia,&quot; Becky said.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, you want a vacation there?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
Becky twirled a lock of her hair in her head. &quot;Not exactly.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now I was getting confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to see the outback as someone who lives there see it. Ask the ring to turn us into wild kangaroos,&quot; Becky said.<br />
<br />
If I were a cartoon character, my jaw would have hit the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;You want to be an animal?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
Becky nodded. &quot;The way I see it, they sort of have hands, so you can keep the ring. Anyway, if something goes wrong, you can wish us to change back.&quot;<br />
<br />
I nodded. &quot;So, um, do you want to be a male or a female roo? Do you want us able to speak as roos?&quot;<br />
<br />
Becky grinned. &quot;I'm feeling a bit frisky. I'll be the male. *You* be the girl!&quot;<br />
<br />
I raised an eyebrow. &quot;You're nuts! I like it!&quot;<br />
<br />
Becky winked at me.<br />
<br />
&quot;For this to work, I think we're gonna have to find normal roo stuff, you know, not weird, gross or abnormal,&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
Becky nodded. &quot;Okay, I give you permission for that and stuff about being able to hop naturally.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, you're sure you want to do this?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. Anyway, if it goes wrong, we can always change back. Let's do something risky,&quot; Becky said.<br />
<br />
&quot;All right then. I wish Becky to become a male kangaroo that can still speak. However, only we'll be able to understand each other. As a kangaroo, she won't find any of the things kangaroos do as gross, weird or unnatural and she'll keep her memories and intelligence.&quot;<br />
<br />
I felt a shudder and could swear that a chill went through the room. Becky gasped, lay on her back and spread her legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow I,&quot; she started.<br />
<br />
It was my turn to gasp as fur began covering her hairless body. It was light red on her legs, belly, arms and red elsewhere. Immediately, her legs began getting longer and I could sense, more powerful. I thought of hoping naked with her, the hot sun at our backs and not a care in the world. It was an exciting thought. If I were alone, it would probably be fun. With Becky, I had a feeling that it would be incredible.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm really becoming a roo!&quot; Becky said, her voice growing deeper.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
Next, her feet began to elongate as the beginnings of what would soon be her long tail appeared. I realised that the idea of my girlfriend as a roo and me as a human wasn’t very appealing to me. I decided to make a silent wish in order to make things right, at least to us. I wished to become a female roo that could still speak, would retain my memories and intelligence and would find Becky's male roo form attractive.<br />
<br />
As I felt the tingle and itch of fur covering my body. I looked at Becky. “So, our vacation can begin.”<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Becky's features were beginning to twist. Her proportions were changing before my eyes and her face was starting to stretch out into that of a kangaroo. I found myself getting excited at her being a kangaroo. <br />
<br />
I then wondered just what I had done to myself. When this finished I would find male kangaroos attractive and would be a hairy animal in the middle of the wild, naked and free to as I please. Knowing that male roo would be Becky reduced my worries to almost nothing.<br />
<br />
Becky's ears were growing to a large size, her tail was getting longer and claws were developing on her elongating feet. Her breasts were shrinking into her chest. Oddly, that didn't disappoint me.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm a kangaroo! Am I a boy yet?&quot; Becky asked.<br />
<br />
I took a deep breath and watched as a male-hood developed between her legs. I felt my posture starting to change. My legs were huge and my torso was reshaping.<br />
<br />
&quot;Becky, can I get your permission for something?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Becky said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe it's just instincts talking but can I make you extra you know potent, so we can have some extra ... fun?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
Becky's face was a kangaroo muzzle by this point. &quot;Okay, know yourself out. If we're going to do this, we might as well go nuts.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish that Becky would be extra potent as a male roo,&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
Becky shuddered and gasped. &quot;I want to hop. Please hurry up and change so we can get busy!&quot;<br />
<br />
My entire body was itching and felt strange. I could see my muzzle growing right in front of my eyes. I reached up and touched my ears and found large furry kangaroo ears.<br />
<br />
&quot;W...want me to undo the potency thing?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No I ... wow! Let's have some fun with this first!&quot; Becky answered.<br />
<br />
I made a silent wish for my transformation to be complete as soon as possible and then for us to teleport into the outback where we could be alone. A sensation of water pouring all over my body hit me. I felt everything changing so fast that I couldn’t concentrate on a single aspect of the change. When the sensation faded, the entire room went white. As everything came back into focus, I found myself standing as a female kangaroo before a male that was lying on the ground before me.<br />
<br />
Looking at the male roo, who I knew was Becky, I felt excited.<br />
<br />
“That was fun. So, what do we do now?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“First things first, make sure the ring is still on your finger,” Becky said.<br />
<br />
Seeing a kangaroo talking was quite a shock. However, I had other worries now. I lifted my right paw like hand and saw that…</p>
