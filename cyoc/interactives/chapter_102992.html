<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The first thing she heard was Jack laughing.<br />
<br />
Oh no, she&#39;d fallen asleep! She&#39;d been meaning to surprise him, waiting for him in her sexiest bra and panties to give him a bit of fun before the semester started and they were too busy to spend as much time together as she would have liked. She didn&#39;t blame him because being on the football team was a big responsibility and he had to practice and keep his grades up, but there were times when she felt like they never got to see each other. And unfortunately the school didn&#39;t allow co-ed dorms, which meant that they even lived on opposite sides of campus.<br />
<br />
So her surprise for him was ruined and even worse, his creepy roommate was with him, staring at her in her underwear.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s so funny?&quot; she snapped, furious that Jack&#39;s roommate didn&#39;t even have the decency to look away. Instead he was blatantly ogling her. He was a jerk though, acting like she didn&#39;t have the right to stop by and visit Jack in his own room.<br />
<br />
Instead of managing an actual reply Jack waved in her general direction and continued to laugh, tears streaming down his face from how hard he was laughing. Even more frustrating was how his roommate had gone from ogling to leering.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; she frowned, wishing that one of them wold actually give her an answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;How did you do it?&quot; Jack managed to gasp out between laughing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do what?&quot; she scowled, crossing her arms over her chest. The minute she did so she realized that something was terribly wrong. Something was tickling the palms of her hands and she looked down at herself. At first the dark shadow over her body didn&#39;t register. Trying to figure out what was covering her she ran her hands up and down her arms.<br />
<br />
Hair.<br />
<br />
On her chest.<br />
<br />
Down her stomach.<br />
<br />
All over her arms and legs.<br />
<br />
Thick, dark, hair.<br />
<br />
Unable to help herself, she screamed. Jack&#39;s roommate must have gotten back first before him, saw her asleep and instead of waking her up decided to have a bit of fun at her expense, covering her in hair clippings so she&#39;d wake up an itchy mess, except the hair was stuck to her. he must have sprayed her with glue first.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Jack rushed to her side and she shoved him away. She felt so itchy and gross from all the hair covering her that the last thing she wanted to do was be touched, especially when the hair would get all over everything.<br />
<br />
Struggling to calm down she stared at his roommate, &quot;You did this to me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...uhh...&quot; he stammered, his leer immediately changing into an expression of guilty confusion<br />
<br />
&quot;You glued all this to me while I was asleep,&quot; she continued, &quot;If I get a rash from this I&#39;m going to have you kicked out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Because this wasn&#39;t the first time he&#39;d been a jerk to her, just the worst. He was always looking at her like she didn&#39;t belong, like she didn&#39;t deserve a boyfriend like Jack. Sometimes guys could be just as petty as girls.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Calm down,&quot; Jack said quickly, &quot;He wouldn&#39;t do something like that. Just go to the bathroom and see about washing it off. The door was unlocked when we got here so it could have been anyone in the hall. While you&#39;re in the shower we can ask around to see if anyone saw anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
She nodded, glad that Jack at least was willing to be reasonable and even helpful, &quot;Okay, but wait until I&#39;m out of the shower. I don&#39;t want anyone seeing me like this so you&#39;ll need to wait outside the door until I tell you it&#39;s okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
If any of the girls saw her like this she&#39;d never hear the end of it. They were all petty jerks and something like this would give them reason to say horrible  things about her for the rest of the year.<br />
<br />
She couldn&#39;t believe what Jack&#39;s creepy roommate had done to her, gluing creepy hair to her while she was asleep, but even as she waited for the water of the shower to warm up enough for her to get in she couldn&#39;t help but think that Jack might be right about his roommate being innocent. She was still going to blame him because she had to blame someone, but she couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that it wasn&#39;t just some silly prank. Whoever had done it had been impossibly through, to the point where she shouldn&#39;t have been able to sleep through it all, yet she had. With Jack guarding the door so that no one else could get into the bathroom she took a moment to look at herself in the mirror.<br />
<br />
What she saw was revolting, she was covered in thick, dark hair. Except it wasn&#39;t a random scattering, it was positioned like actual hair would be. Or actual hair on a really hairy guy at least, no girl would ever have a beard and full sideburns. Leaning in closer to the mirror she saw how through whoever had done it to her had been, going so far as to make her eyebrows both darker and thicker. They looked like they nearly met in the center of her forehead. Very gross.<br />
<br />
Shuddering she rubbed her hands over her arms, trying to ignore the feeling of the thick hair covering them. The shower would be warm enough by now and Jack had been nice enough to lend her soap. Trying not to cry she went in and let the hot water wash over her.<br />
<br />
She expected that the glue would melt and the hair would wash away, but she clearly wasn&#39;t going to be so lucky. The hair remained stuck to her. Gritting her teeth she resigned herself to the fact that the glue must have been waterproof and that she was going to need to scrub it off.<br />
<br />
Working up a good lather with the soap she started scrubbing her chest, trying to wash the hairs off of her breasts. After counting off a full minute she washed the soap off and was terrified to see that the hair was still there, not a single strand of it was gone. <br />
<br />
It was a struggle for her to keep from screaming as she lifted her arm up for a closer look and saw what she&#39;d suspected from the start, the hairs were thoroughly stuck. More than that, they looked like they had grown out of her skin. Taking a deep breath she managed to grab a few between the tips of her fingers and gave them a good yank. <br />
<br />
It hurt.<br />
<br />
Only one hair had come loose.<br />
<br />
They really were attached to her.<br />
<br />
Sobbing she slid to the floor of the shower and cried.<br />
<br />
She wasn&#39;t sure how long she&#39;d been crying for when she heard the door open and Jack cautiously ask her if everything was alright.<br />
<br />
She tried to get the words out that no, she wasn&#39;t okay, she was as far from okay as she could imagine being without being dead, but she couldn&#39;t. Somehow while she&#39;d been asleep she&#39;d grown hair everywhere.<br />
<br />
She was a freak.<br />
<br />
Her life was as good as over. Jack was bound to dump her when he realized what had happened to her. She&#39;d have to drop out of school because of how badly the other girls would torment her. She wouldn&#39;t even be able to go outside because of how ugly she was.</p>
