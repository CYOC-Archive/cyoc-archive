<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff wasn&#39;t happy about the things he was seeing but was too shy to say them out loud. Jenny had become more and more chaotic as she hogged the chronivac. Jeff felt helpless near her as she was calling all the shots. Jennifer started to make changes that her mother&#39;s hard earned money would directly transfer itself to her after all the expenses had been paid. Laughing like a witch while adding more and more conditions and changes to her mother&#39;s profile and things her mother owned. She was charge of everything right now. She was the home owner. She wanted everything.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bua ha ha ha! I just transferred all my mom&#39;s savings to my bank account. She was loaded apparently but since she&#39;s not here I&#39;m pseudo rich right now for a high schooler. Like that&#39;s enough money for me to buy whatever I want and when I want without worry.&quot; Jennifer devilishly smiled at Jeff. &quot;And what I currently want is... that I want to feel your cock inside my mouth again. So... like, have fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff felt something tingling his balls and in seconds they were enlarged into size of two fist sized balls. Jeff noticed that his average size dick also grew in size into a veiny 12 inch cock. Jeff fell to the ground as his balls begun throb and pulsate like a pair of water balloons filled to the brim with liquid.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you do to me...?&quot; Jeff said as he was scared and felt his body shrinking. He begun to lose a lot of body mass including muscles and fat. Jeff also felt himself turning into a feminine twink boy more than himself. &quot;Like, Jen, oh my goodness gracious, like, you need to, like, stop this right now and... like... I&#39;m turning into a...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff begun to forget things about himself as Jennifer kept typing more and more on the laptop he had brought with him which had the chronivac installed inside it&#39;s solid state drive. Jeff turned more and more into a lesser man that he could have been and resembled a small little twink gay boy. Jeff didn&#39;t know what Jennifer was thinking. Why was he receiving her wrath all of a sudden. Was this on her bucket list or what was going on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeeen-niii! I feel so... weird! STOP!&quot; Jeff screamed as his voice got higher and feminine and his face begun to smooth. His regular sized socks begun to increase in height until the were on top of his knees. The socks had small cats with ribbons on them while the socks looked more cute than manly. The t-shirt he wore looked like a beige and pink tank-top with a text, &quot;Rawr, you know what to do with me&quot; and his trousers turned into a pair of tight shorts that had his massive bulge imprinted on it. Jeff&#39;s lengthy cock&#39;s tip was exiting through one of the short&#39;s opening. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well now my widdle twinky boy. Be a good puppy and I will in exchange turn your world upside down. As I&#39;m the alpha female here.&quot; Jennifer said as she begun the round two with Jeff by taking off his short shorts. &quot;I&#39;ve always wanted to do this as my mom always told me to &#39;get a real man&#39; when I grow up. Now that mom&#39;s gone I can have casual sex with whomever I want with. Right mom!?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff started to notice that Jennifer had unsolved mommy issues that she was projecting out on him. Using Jeff like a doll for her own pleasure. Jeff felt that Jennifer wasn&#39;t ready to handle the new 12 inch cock. Her mouth was too shallow, she didn&#39;t use her tongue and her two weak arms did nothing to keep Jeff&#39;s cock in hardened state. Making Jeff cringe as Jennfier was trying too hard this time.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the frick Jeff!! Did I actually turn you into a freaking gay!? Just moment ago you were eager to cum on my face but now it&#39;s like you don&#39;t care.&quot; Jennifer spat on Jeff&#39;s face as she was getting pissed off by Jeff&#39;s reaction. She stormed back on the computer and begun to make more changed on Jeff as Jeff felt more and more nauseated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chennihfah lis-shen-&quot; Jeff tried to say but was quite shocked how he sounded like. It was like he was doing a falsetto mixed with hint of whatever that was with his voice. &quot;Like lis-shen to me. Dah ya think I shound like dish? Like dish ish not how I should shound like, dish ish not me, yaaah?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff tried his best to convince Jenny who just stared at him with the most apathetic expression. Rolling her eyes she went back on the computer and it almost seemed like the thing had worked but something was off. Jeff couldn&#39;t move and suddenly felt his cock getting harder and harder as Jennifer begun to nag and belittle him how useless Jeff was and sounded like her mother. Jeff felt off as something was detaching from his body and felt to the floor under him. Unable to raise his head from the floor. Jennifer took the object from the floor and showed it to Jeff.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think you need this anymore...&quot; Jennifer smiled as she spun Jeff&#39;s detached cock in front of his stiff eyes. &quot;Also, have fun with my mom where ever she is as you are going to be with-&quot;<br />
<br />
And just like that Jeff was popped out of existence like Jennifer&#39;s mom was. <br />
<br />
Leaving the laptop and his cock in Jennifer&#39;s hands. Jennifer in other hand was disappointed by what Jeff truly were. Jennifer wanted a man and all she had was a sheep under the wolves clothes. She had wished that Jeff had been the bad boy she yearned every night when Jeff wasn&#39;t by her side. She justified that his boyfriend, now an ex-boyfriend, was a broken toy that she didn&#39;t want to play with anymore. She now had a chronivac to that was like a wishing lamp&#39;s genie with infinite wishes. He shook Jeff&#39;s disgusting leftover piece that was shrinking and getting flacid and threw it in the same trashcan with her mother&#39;s panties.<br />
<br />
Why would she need a boy-, an ex-boyfriend or a mother anyway?<br />
<br />
Jennifer picked up the laptop and begun to change ...</p>
