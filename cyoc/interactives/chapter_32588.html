<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><P>Tricia was eager to tell Sam about the remote, but she didn't want to do it in such a public place. What's more, after changing those jerks into mixed-up bimbos, Tricia had an itchy trigger finger. What if she showed Sam the remote's possibilities if she discretely changed her here...and then made her aware of it later?
<P>"Why are you looking at me like that?" Samantha asked.
<P>"Was I looking at you like I was planning something?" Tricia asked, trying to adopt a poker face.
<P>"Yes."
<P>"I'll tell you later," she grinned. Meanwhile, under the table, her fingers were calling up Tricia's patented cowgirl form and slightly modifying it for Samantha. During this, Mel came to take Samantha's order. She ordered the corned beef. "You sure you don't want something else today?" Tricia prodded, recalling her own sudden distaste for beef.
<P>"It's what I usually get," Samantha said, confused. Mel took the order and left them alone again.
<P>Tricia had finished programming the remote with the Acceptance set to exclude Tricia and no one else. That way, nobody would freak out as Samantha's changes started. Not even her. She couldn't wait to see how this would play out.
<P>She zapped Samantha under the table, covering up the action with a loud cough. There was no noise, but just in case Samantha felt anything strange all of a sudden, Tricia didn't want her to focus on it. "I think I'm getting a sore throat." She casually reached for her water.
<P>"So what's new?" Samantha asked, reaching for her own glass which Mel had given her a few minutes earlier. Tricia glanced at her fingers quickly and saw that they were already starting to merge together.
<P>"Well, nothing at all, really. Except for this one thing that happened when I got out of bed this morning."
<P>Tricia paused as she watched Samantha's ears form points. Her hair had begun to change color as well. Sam waited for her to continue. "What?" she asked.
<P>"Well, I don't want to talk about it here, but let's just say it changed my life." As she talked, Samantha's hair turned completely blue, and was starting to grow longer. Black fur was creeping across her skin at her neck and her wrists. "But enough about me, tell me about that book you're working on." Tricia wanted to shift enough of the conversation back to Samantha so she could better take in the changes, and to distract Samantha in case the change actually became noticed. Samantha was a poet, and was currently working on getting her first book published. As she talked about her latest inspirations, Tricia watched as black horns grew from out of her blue hair and her black fur covered every visible inch of her body. Sam even scratched at it with her new three-fingered hand as it finished growing. Her eyes turned a beautiful bright sea blue.
<P>Tricia "accidentally" dropped her napkin during this time. While under the table, she snuck a peek at Samantha's growing tail. Trish had allowed her skirt to create a hole to allow the tail to grow in uninhibited. It was already quite long, black furred with blue spots and a soft thick blue cuff at the end. It swished lazily off the chair, growing so long it started to brush the floor.
<P>When she got back topside, Samantha was talking about meadows. "You know, I don't know why I haven't written a poem about how peaceful rolling green fields are. The idea just came to mind. Don't you think it's a good subject?"
<P>"It's probably not gonna be one of your more sensational pieces, but yeah, I think I can relate to it," Tricia said honestly. Now that she thought about it, a wide open field didn't sound too bad at the moment. But she didn't let it completely distract her from watching the final changes.
<P>A large nose ring appeared between her nostrils, so large it drooped to her lips, which might become an obstacle while eating. Sam's blue hair gathered itself up at the temples and formed two thin blue braids that ran down her chest and under the table. Trish had programmed her hair to grow to floor length, even longer than her own, and she kept it loose in the back.
<P>Finally, Samantha's chest surged a little bit, and her clothes grew to accommodate. This was a little joke on Tricia's part...as if the rest wasn't. Sam had confided in Trish a few days earlier that she was contemplating breast implants. Her endowment's weren't that bad, but Samantha seemed annoyed at how men obsessed with large breasts and wondered if they would do anything for her. Now was her chance to find out.
<P>When Mel put their meals down in front of them, Samantha balked. "I didn't order this, did I? Oh geez...I don't know what I was thinking. How could I have been in the mood for corned BEEF?"
<P>Tricia snickered, but tried to keep it quiet so Sam wouldn't notice. "I did ask if you were sure," Tricia reminded her.
<P>"I'm sorry, Mel, but I really can't eat this. It doesn't feel right at all." Samantha pushed the plate away in disgust.
<P>"It's fine," Mel said with a perplexed look on her face. "Actually I don't know why I didn't realize what was going on when you ordered it. Of course I understand how you feel. Don't worry about it."
<P>"I'll have a salad like Tricia instead. Thanks, Mel." If Samantha was blushing under her black and blue-spotted fur, Tricia couldn't tell.
<P>"Sam, your tail and hair are on the floor," Tricia pointed out at last.
<P>"Oh!" Samantha's posture straightened, and then she bent over to gather her tail and hair in her lap. Tricia had put her own tail in her lap when she first sat down. "Silly me. Where is my head today?"
<P>"On that pasture, probably," Tricia said as she chowed down on her salad.</p>
