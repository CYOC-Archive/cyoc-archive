<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The lake was quite big and usually quite quiet but today tha was not the case. There weren&#39;t that many people there but enough. <br />
<br />
Karen took Ben and Susie to the changing rooms she opened the door when Ben started to protest.<br />
<br />
&quot;But that&#39;s the girls room.&quot; He argued.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sweetie, no one&#39;s going to mind and you can&#39;t get changed by yourself. You&#39;re too young.&quot; She said with emphasis on too.<br />
<br />
Ben sighed and conceded as the three of them entered a family sized cubicle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do we have to get changed together?&quot; Susie asked curiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I want to know that your changed.&quot; Karen replied as she opened her bag. She took out three swimsuits and a swim diaper.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on Susie lets get you changed.&quot; Karen said as she picked her up by her armpits and laid her on the plastic changing table.<br />
<br />
Susie was wiped down and changed of her damp diaper, replaced with a swim diaper. She was then helped into a pink one piece with cartoon fish on it and exaggerated frills around the straps and leg holes.<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel stupid,&quot; Susie said as she crossed her arms in disgust.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh don&#39;t worry, sweetie.&quot; Karen said as she reached into the bag again, and pulled out her swimsuit. &quot;Mommy has one just like it,&quot; she said as she revealed an identical swimsuit in a much larger size. Karen stripped naked and climbed into the suit. This just made Susie more upset. Karen looked amazing albeit ironically. <br />
<br />
Karen then turned to Ben and helped him take his clothes off. She helped him step into his superman trunks and then carried the two of them out to the lake after ditching the bag in a nearby locker.<br />
<br />
Karen soaked in all the looks she got from women jealous of her body and men jealous that their women didn&#39;t have her body.<br />
<br />
She carried both Ben and Susie to a small, shallow area and dropped them in the water. She sat cross legged as the two did nothing. &quot;Come on guys, lets play,&quot; she encouraged them.<br />
<br />
Getting nothing out of them Karen decided to take some rubber rings that someone had left begin and travel over to where some other kids were playing. She asked a woman who she assume was their mother if Susie and Ben could join in, to which she obliged.<br />
<br />
And so the four kids started splashing around, and slowly but surely Ben and Susie joined in.<br />
<br />
 after about half an hour or so Ben felt a pressure gathering in his bladder. He didn&#39;t want to wet himself so he shrugged it off, eventually he forgot about it and went back to playing. Karen watched the two of them from a deck chair as she talked to the other mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;So how old are your kids then?&quot; Karen asked her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, they&#39;re both five in August.&quot; She responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;No way, you have twins too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, how old are yours then.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh they&#39;ll be eight come October.&quot; She lied <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh how lovely. They grow up so fast.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, it feels like only yesterday I was pregnant with them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah but you don&#39;t look like you suffered much.&quot; The woman sighed as she looked at her own paunch of a stomach.<br />
<br />
&quot;Has it been hard for you then?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Has what? Losing weight? Yeah, but I like food to much so I&#39;m not bothered.&quot; She giggled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, that&#39;s funny. Well it was nice meeting you, but I think we should be going now. She said as she called for Ben and Susie to come over.<br />
<br />
She carried the two of them back to the cubicle where she stripped Susie down, changed her diaper and put her back in her dress.<br />
<br />
She then turned to Ben. Ben was now dancing around trying not to pee. But as Karen pulled his shorts to his ankles, the cold air made him react and urine shot out of his even more shrunken member and into Karen&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bennie!&quot; She yelled as she wiped her eyes. She lifted a struggling Ben up onto the table. He was strapped down and a diaper was slid under his butt. She powdered and put diaper cream on him and fastened the diaper up. &quot;Better. I hope your better than your sister,&quot; she Sai as she rubbed her forehead. &quot;Who knows maybe I&#39;ll have to make the two of you younger still.&quot; <br />
<br />
Ben and Susie looked visibly shaken by that as they started to walk home.<br />
<br />
As they entered the house they were carried upstairs and were about to enter their room when Karen stopped for a minute. Suddenly the word nursery appeared over the front of the door.<br />
<br />
The room had been repainted baby blue. The beds had been replaced with  wooden cribs there was a changing table stocked with diapers and pulls ups in one corner, in the other corner was a rocking chair next to a bookshelf full of children books. The dresser was no longer white, the top 2 draws where painted pink and the bottom 2 draws were the same color as the walls. Also there was a door that led into a different room. Karen opened it and showed it to the shocked children in her arms. It was playroom, it had a bunch of toys in it and a playpen in one corner.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, you two have a nap while I make dinner.&quot; <br />
<br />
She took the two of them over to the rocking chair and took out a book from the bookshelf she was going to read us a story before we went to bed. Ben was placed on her left knee and Susie on was  placed her on her right. Ben was tugging at Karen&#39;s Shirt. Karen took off her shirt and then undid her bra. Ben attacked her nipple with hunger, suckling her fill of milk. Susie was on Carol&#39;s other knee with her back against her chest. She could feel her nipple touching her back. Karen guided Susie&#39;s head into her breast and forced her to drink.<br />
<br />
 Karen took out a book about some bears living in the woods and began to read. The two of them drinking the entire time as Karen stroked their soft hair in turn. After they finished the story and they had been fed they were taken over to the cribs. They were directly next to each other with the bars lining up. Susie&#39;s was further in the corner than Ben&#39;s. They were placed in the cribs and each given a cuddly toy, Ben a giraffe and Susie an elephant.<br />
<br />
<br />
As Ben drifted off to sleep he thought he could really get used to this.</p>
