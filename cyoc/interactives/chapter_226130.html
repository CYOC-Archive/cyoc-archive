<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Hinata was sitting on a park bench with her guitar case sitting next to her. So far she hadn’t seen any of her targets and her comms were disrupted ever since she entered the park. The black haired girl wished she could have a drink but was weary of even the bottled water at this magical amusement park, she couldn’t risk any unwanted transformations and she couldn’t test it in the field.<br />
The Normal agent wondered if she should have just listened to Golf-4, she was inside but was no closer to locating the targets. Then she got up and reassured herself that what she was doing was the right way to handle this, they couldn’t allow Misery to just come and go as she pleases. Especially not after what her group had done to one of their own, even if it was only Felix. She headed towards the hotel part of the park, from there she could find the administration building where she was more likely to find information.<br />
<br />
The hotel area was separated by the main park by a wide bridge and consisted of a large jungle section in the middle surrounded by buildings. The admin building was on the far side of the area and the agent quietly made her way around the jungle center, there was no telling what might be inside.<br />
Moving to the side of the admin building she used her kitsune reflexes to scale the building and enter through an open window. The building was surprisingly empty and no lights were on, she was suspicious that the administrative building would be empty but decided to search the other floors and find out where her targets were.<br />
Hinata held her foxfire in hand to light the dark empty space. There were desks and computers and filing cabinets but everything was still, strangely there was no dust or cobwebs, but she knew nobody had been inside for some time. She took Moon Slayer out from the guitar case and secured it around her back, prepared for anything that she might find…or might find her.<br />
The elevator wasn’t working so she took the stairwell and peaked into the other floors. She climbed lower and lower until she was on the ground floor, there she saw lights and the reception area with employees and guests but it all seemed as staged as the rides here.<br />
Looking over the back she saw a heavily locked door with chains and padlocks. Moving over to it she drew her sword and sliced through the chains with ease. Hinata looked back to make sure nobody had noticed her but one of the receptionists had glanced her was and was quickly walking towards the girl.<br />
<br />
“Excuse me miss?! You don’t want to go down there!—“ she tried to warn but the Normal agent slammed the door behind her and went further down into the expansive sub levels.<br />
<br />
The Asian girl looked back in surprise to see the receptionist hadn’t followed her down, she didn’t even open the door. Everything was silent and stale like the upper floors but the kitsune could sense that there was something different about the sub levels. Igniting her foxfire once again she continued down into the lower levels, this would be the perfect place to hide but the locks on the door and the similar emptiness of the upper floors made her doubt Misery or the other were here. The girl went back to leave but found a blank wall where the sat airs and exit once were, for some mysterious reason Hinata couldn’t exit from the way she came so she continued forward. <br />
<br />
“If this is some kind of trap just come out now or I’ll make you suffer before I kill you!” She said, realizing this must be the work of a wizard.<br />
<br />
She scoffed and drew her sword, its holy light illuminating the creepy surroundings. She changed to her human/kitsune form; with long black fox ears on top of her head and four black fox tails, her eyes became foxlike and her canines sharpened.<br />
She hated wizards, they were usually cowards who relied on minions or magic tricks, but  they could be killed like any other inhuman creature.<br />
<br />
Somewhere in the lower levels Shiro watched through a magic window. After the attempted attack on them by Normal assassins, Misery had offered refuge in Circe’s park until the couple could find a new home. He was annoyed at all the fuss, the apartment was perfectly safe but Jennifer had insisted they move and he could never say no to his beloved. The blonde was at the resort section in one of the spas, hopefully she hadn’t ended up transformed somehow but Circe assured him that any transformations inside the park would be temporary. This allowed him some time to get some payback on the Normal, he wasn’t sure this schoolgirl was an agent but the sword she carried was no doubt Moon Slayer, a legendary sword held by the Normal. It would prove difficult to fight against so he made sure his spells and illusions wouldn’t cause her to attack, he could always transfigure her sword into something else but he knew it wouldn’t remain changed for very long.<br />
As he watched the asian girl make her way through his enchanted maze of rusty pipes and bricks, he thought about it he ever had a daughter if she would have proper black Japanese hair like the kitsune before him? The more he thought about it he rather liked the idea of his hypothetical daughter sharing her mother’s brilliant blonde locks. They had never discussed having children but his sister-in-law, Mika, had little ones of her own. He wondered if Jennifer thought about having children of her own, he knew she’d be a great mother but he wasn’t so sure he would make a good father, he hadn’t gotten along with his own father and didn’t know how he should act or what he should do if he ever had children. <br />
Shiro turned his attention to the intruder and prepared the next part of this mystical basement.<br />
<br />
After some walking Hinata came upon a set of doors, each had different styles and themes. They were lined up in a semicircle and looking behind them revealed there was nothing on the other side, she figured they were magical entrances of some kind. Beyond the door was nothing but walls with rusted pipes and wooden crates so she knew she had to pick one.<br />
She read the signs posted on each:<br />
“Jumbo’s Buffet”<br />
“Karen’s Care Daycare”<br />
“Happy Life Harmonies Tryouts”<br />
“Princess Candy-Mandy’s Tea Party”<br />
“Ms. Periwinkle’s School for Mystical Children”<br />
“Uncle Bob’s Farm”<br />
“?Mystery Door?”<br />
<br />
Hinata knew she had no other choice but to choose a door, but which one? <br />
<br />
“I’m going to regret this.” She told herself and chose a door.</p>
