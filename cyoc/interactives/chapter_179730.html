<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Katie couldn&#39;t take her eyes of her father. She watched him, seeing how his muscles moved as he cooked, watching his biceps bulge and his pecs dance. She began to feel bad however, thinking of his love life, or lack thereof. It didn&#39;t make sense, in this new world, that Derek didn&#39;t have anyone, and Katie couldn&#39;t stop thinking about what life would be life with both parents, with a mother. Luckily, she could change things.<br />
<br />
Katie went back and started typing again, now realizing the full extent of what she can do. She changed their mother into Dereks high school sweetheart, a 5&#39; 9&#39;&#39; blonde, gorgeous, former cheerleader. They married straight after high school and she followed him to college to cheer him on some more. Katie went downstairs to check on the progress of the change.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Derek, you&#39;re SO bad!&quot; Katie heard in a high and very feminine voice, as she made her way into the kitchen.<br />
<br />
As she looks at the stove where her father had been cooking, out of necessity, now is being operated by a woman. Derek, is hugging this woman from behind, kissing her neck and grabbing ass in a playful and loving way. Katie has never seen her father like this before, but its becoming her new reality and becomes more and more normal in her head. <br />
<br />
Katie starts to remember growing up with Olivia, her new mothers name, and Derek as her loving parents. She remembers everyone at school talking about hot her parents were, and she remembers being so proud. <br />
<br />
Little did Katie know, that upstairs the program was trying to make these changes work with her and her siblings. It began to rework the relationships, changing her and her brothers to be the biological children of Olivia and the new Derek. Her older brother was the first to feel these changes. <br />
<br />
Jake, her older brother at 18, began to feel a cramp in his leg. He stopped his video game for a minute to rub his legs, thinking to himself, &quot;ugh, must be growing pains again,&quot; but at 5&#39; 2&#39;&#39; there was not much to grow at a normal rate. Luckily for Jake this would not be a normal growth. Jason never got back to his game, as his whole body began to heat up, he felt his limbs begin to stretch, his spine becoming longer and longer. He looked down at his feet, seeing them grow and grow, becoming large and wide size 13&#39;s. His hands start to become huge mits, big enough to palm a basketball. His limbs stop growing, putting him at cool 6&#39; 5&#39;&#39;, making him no longer the shortest 18 year old in school, but one of the biggest. The next wave began almost instantly as his muscles begin to tense up and explode out of him, large square pecs push out against his shirt, cobblestone abs following directly below. His biceps and shoulders bulge out and he gives a flex feeling the tightness of muscle. His legs grow pushing his shorts to the limits, until they rip as his ass pushes out, giving him the family muscle butt, a shelf of muscle. Jake doesn&#39;t know how to process all this change, but he doesn&#39;t get long as his face starts to change, he looks in the mirror, at his hunky new body as he gets a face to match. His greasy hair starts to change color, becoming a beautiful blond like his mother, and restyles itself in a spiky jock cut with the sides shaved. He feels his cheek bones and jaw start to become more chiseled, giving him a jaw that would make supermodels jealous. His eyebrows start to fill in, becoming larger and bushier, perfect to sit above his beautiful familial ocean blue eyes. Its gives him a piercing look to match his other hunky features. Jason now looks like a stud, and all American jock that oozes sex appeal. He touches his throat as he admires everything and feels a lump start to grow, he touches and realizes it his Adams apples, and lets out his smooth baritone new voice. This triggers his last change, as his new voice starts to change the downstairs, as his penis starts to elongate. His pervious 3 inches begins to push further and further out resting at 9in flaccid and 12in erect, his balls growing to oranges finishes off his transformation. Jake can&#39;t believe what he is seeing, in just a few seconds he went from a loser to hunky jock.<br />
<br />
 Around him his room begins to change, as the video games and fantasy posters become football trophies and posters of hot chicks. His bed becomes huge king size, and clothes are scattered everywhere. It looks like the perfect room for the Quarter back of the highschool football team, just like his father. He looks around, admiring it all, and then sees keys. He looks out in the driveway and sees it, a bright red truck, pimped out. He smirks at himself, remembering all the cheerleaders he has done it with in the back. Wait, he thinks, what have I done in the back? The memories feel foreign, but they&#39;re now his reality. He has since his balls dropped, a bonafide ladies man. <br />
<br />
Before he can process this, he gets a text from the head cheerleader Stacy asking if she can come over. Jake tells her to get her hot ass over to him at once, and his new persona takes charge. <br />
<br />
Stacy knocks on the door in her tight cheer outfit, and Jake runs down now used to large mass. Stacy jumps into his arms and they start making out, as Jason takes them to his bed room. His takes off his shorts, revealing the huge cock he&#39;s got waiting for her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, god I love how big you are. Fill me up, stud&quot; Stacy screams as he slips his large python in. Jake just can&#39;t help but think, he could really get used to this life</p>
