<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">On one side Ty thought Dustin had earned his changes and would even need more. The other side were memories of the more loving foster brother Dustin had been years ago. Ty wanted to hug his brother without fearing that Dustin would beat him up for it. Soon he got an idea how he got that while also punishing Dustin even more. As Dustin had now a character and the manners of a bully, Ty didn´t need Dustin as a person anymore. And maybe his foster parents would be nicer to him without Dustin around anymore. So he quickly planned what he would do. When he was finished he summoned Dustin to his room with his powers.<br />
To Dustin the whole evening was catastrophic. Somehow Ty had made him look younger and less developed, and his parents thought it normal. How could he turn back? Maybe he would do so over the night, or he would need to beg Ty to change him back. He hoped for the former.<br />
While he was thinking he felt a strong push go through him, and in a blink of his eyes instead of sitting on his bed he now stood before Ty in his room. “What …?” was all he got out before Ty had come to him and hugged him. They hadn´t hugged for years. What was Ty thinking he did now? But he couldn´t ask Ty for an unknown reason, nor could he move away.<br />
When Dustin appeared in his room, Ty quickly stood up to hug him. To enjoy the situation more he made a silent wish for Dustin to lose his voice. He wouldn´t need it anymore anyway, and Ty could easily made himself able to hear Dustin&#39;s thoughts later. The mostly whispered “What” was the last word Dustin would ever speak, at least if Ty didn´t change his mind about Dustin&#39;s new form later. He then enveloped Dustin in his arms, making another silent wist for Dustin to just stand still as he was. Ty enjoyed hugging Dustin and kept it up. Dustin wouldn´t need to know, so Ty would simply make the changing wishes silent as well. As he already thought about Dustin as his, the first thing he wished for was that Dustin&#39;s clothes vanished while his own would disappear from his body and reappear on his bed.<br />
Dustin felt a sudden chill as his clothes vanished, only to feel Ty&#39;s body pressed to his own. Feeling Ty&#39;s little cock even turned Dustin on, his own erection grew. He saw Ty was suddenly naked, only adding to his feelings. “Wait” he thought as he still couldn´t speak: “I´m not gay, so why am I turned on by Ty? Is he doing this as well?”<br />
Meanwhile Ty felt Dustin&#39;s cock press against his body, so he made another wish. As Dustin wouldn´t need his genitals anymore, he would be allowed to shot his remaining cum out before his cock and balls would shrink into nothing, therefore he would need to grow erect.<br />
It took around ten seconds before Dustin shot his cum out and it lasted only three until he had emptied his balls in there smaller state. Even with his doubts Dustin enjoyed it, only the sucking feeling afterwards wasn´t  as pleasurable. But through the hug he still was in he felt something was missing suddenly and realizes that the sucking feeling had been his cock vanishing inside. He horrified thought: “What have you done. Ty? Where is my dick?”, but it was unheard.<br />
Ty noticed Dustin&#39;s cock shrinking away and smiled at his horrified face. “What´s the matter, Dustin? You know, even if you are mean to me, I still love you as my brother, and brothers can hug each other.” Knowing Dustin couldn´t answer him, he continued Dustin&#39;s changes with silent wishes. Not sure if his immobilizing of Dustin could be broken, the next was for Dustin to grow weaker and softer as well as slow form changes, beginning with Dustin&#39;s hands and feet but spreading further through his whole body.<br />
Dustin was still horrified as he didn´t know what Ty was planning to do with him. Still unable to move or speak he could do nothing but wait. Suddenly he felt weaker on his legs, and as that feeling got stronger, he was sure that if his body would move he would drop down as his legs felt like sticks under a ton of weight. Beside that Ty&#39;s hug got stronger, squeezing him tighter to his chest.<br />
Ty noticed he could squeeze Dustin tighter, as slowly his body got softer and lost resistance as his flesh got more and more plush. As Ty looked to the side he saw Dustin&#39;s right hand, where the fingers slowly got shorter, receding into his palm. A look to the other side confirmed that the same happened to his left hand. He could also see Dustin&#39;s feet, slowly growing shorter, the toes already absorbed back with nothing left. Soon Dustin had four mitten-like stumps instead of hands and feet. Would he regain control of his body now, even if not weakened he couldn´t do anything without help anymore. But that would be no problem, as Dustin wouldn´t need to do anything anymore when he was finished, beside looking happy and being soft and cuddly.<br />
Dustin hadn´t noticed his hands and feet had shrunken away as the overall feeling of his body was numb besides the pressure from Ty&#39;s hug, which got tighter every second. It was the strongest feeling he still had in his body at the moment. He couldn´t even tell he didn´t stood on the ground anymore after his arms and legs got shorter. Only when Ty suddenly twirled around still hugging him he noticed something was off. Ty still grinned at him as he pressed Dustin&#39;s face into his chest. “Wait,” Dustin thought, “since when is it I´m that short? And how could Ty lift me so easily?” When Ty stopped the twirling, his back faced the mirror in his wardrobe, so Dustin would be able to see himself if Ty let him a bit away.<br />
After twirling with Dustin, Ty took one arm away from the hug and instead petted Dustin&#39;s head with the free hand. Dustin weight nearly nothing anymore, so even one arm was more than enough to hold him tight. It wasn´t long before Dustin was only around one and a half feet tall, his legs only reaching down to Ty&#39;s stomach while his face was pressed into Ty&#39;s chest still. The shrunken body was by now without any bones, muscles or flesh, instead everything inside had turned into stuffing. Only Dustin&#39;s face was still normal, as the rest was covered in short brown fur, with only his stomach was a bit more cream colored. Dustin&#39;s normal hair had been sucked into his head, now as long as the fur.<br />
Ty then lifted Dustin away from his chest and higher up, so Dustin could finally see himself in the mirror. Dustin was horrified when he saw what he was now. Beside the remaining face he was resembling an ordinary teddy bear. Five seconds later Ty pressed him into his chest again, saying: “You look wonderful, Dustin. I´m happy with hugging you, and soon you will be finished changing.”<br />
Dustin couldn´t believe what Ty did to him, but couldn´t do anything as he felt his face tickling. It too was slowly covered in light brown fur. His mouth, open in shock, snapped shut and sealed itself, and Dustin felt the stitched line grow into a smile as his teeth and tongue turned to stuffing as well. His nose flattened into a black button, which pushed out a bit together with the stitched mouth into a small snout. His ears expanded away from his head while growing into a rounder shape and moving up his head. The last thing to change were his eyes, as they turned into simple buttons. He could still use all his senses, but was trapped as a teddy for Ty to be hugged and he wasn´t liking it.<br />
Ty lifted him again, smiling at Dustin&#39;s finished form. Dustin saw his now changed face and if he had still been able to would have cried. But nobody would see Dustin&#39;s emotions anymore with his frozen happy smile on that inanimate teddy bears face. Ty then turned Dustin around in his arms, so he now faced away from Ty&#39;s chest. With one arm Ty kept a firm hug around Dustin&#39;s belly while he moved over to Dustin&#39;s room. Inside the room Ty made another silent wish after looking around. Before their eyes everything that belonged to the human Dustin slowly faded away, and only some things Ty wanted to keep reappearing in his own room after vanishing. Half a minute later Dustin&#39;s room was mostly empty, having been turned into a simple guest bedroom. As Ty&#39;s room was next to this room Ty willed the wall in between to move a bit, making his own room bigger and the guest room smaller. Smiling, he wished then to be able to read and hear Dustin&#39;s thoughts when he holds him while also letting the world forget about the human Dustin completely. He also wished that nobody would question why he kept a teddy with him all the time. “Look, you won´t need to worry little Dustin, you don´t have any responsibilities anymore, nothing to do but being my little cuddle teddy forever.” Ty said grinning down at Dustin.<br />
Dustin would cry even more as his things vanished before him. “No Ty, stop it. I´m not a teddy for you, please just turn me back.” Ty hugged him a bit firmer when he replied: “What, my little Dustin isn´t happy being mine forever? You will be with time. Why turn you back if there is nothing left of your old life?” Ty decided on another wish for Dustin. While he would keep his memories and everything other, he would soon love being Ty&#39;s teddy bear. He also wouldn´t want to be changed back the longer he stayed in this form. And over time he would think he had been a teddy ever since he can think off and never a human boy, as he would think his memories were dreams instead. Maybe in a year there would be nothing left of the human Dustin but distant dreams in his cute little teddy bear.<br />
Dustin felt a wave wash over him, but didn´t know what had happened now. He was still shocked that Ty had answered to his thoughts. “Ty, if you can hear me, please, I have learned my lesson, we can be close brothers again, but please change me back. I don´t want to be a stuff toy.” Ty waited a bit before answering to that: “I can hear you, my little Dustin. But I love you as you are now, way more than before. You will ever be my brother, but you are my little teddy now and will be happy soon. There is no changing you back anymore, and soon you wouldn´t want to be a boring human anymore.” Still grinning at the horrified thoughts of Dustin that came after that, as Dustin feared he would lose his mind and be just inanimate Ty moved back to his now larger room and got into bed as it was late already, still tightly hugging his former brother as he soon was dreaming. <br />
Dustin couldn´t sleep, as a teddy wouldn´t need to, so he had to endure Ty&#39;s hug the whole night. One time Ty rolled over on top of him, but he realized he didn´t feel any pain from the weight on him. Also over the night he slowly loved the affection Ty had for him, and hoped Ty would never leave him. Still he wanted to be human again.</p>
