<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A few months had now passed since the experiment. You and Cathy had been going at it like rabbits any opportunity you could get. Now you were sitting at the kitchen table, Saturday morning, watching her make breakfast. Had not the kids been home, you would have bent her over the kitchen counter and fucked her right there. Knowing she probably was thinking the same thing. <br />
<br />
Due to the fact the experiment had solved your money problem and your increased performance at work - You could afford sending Lucas to Collage. And Mariah as well. She was actually at a meet and greet just last weekend. That meant most of the time it would only be Brad and David in the house. And David was out with his friends and that girl most of the time. Her name was Molly. That would leave a lot of time for fucking and not having to act around the kids. You were looking forward to it.<br />
<br />
You had kept at it with the jogging - it helped that going out into nature with Cathy was an easy way to get your freak on as well. Of course, this did mean the weight loss slowed down. But you had lost your man boobs and double chin. Your stomach was less soft and now more of a beer gut. Cathy kept telling you she loved how sexy she thought you were. You couldn&#39;t help but feel sexy when showered with such praise. Cathy&#39;s weight loss had also slowed down but you didn&#39;t care. You loved her large ass, big tits and soft features. She was a milf. A damn fine one. Something you had no problem letting her know. <br />
<br />
During the months you had talked with Dr Larry quite frequently. After confiding in him with what happened in the woods - He insisted on you letting him know if anything changed in that department. He was showing no signs of judgement - only fascination. To him, this was simply more valuable data. That Cathy couldn&#39;t keep herself off you was according to him probably some type of mental response to being around the people that have swapped bodies. It was simply such a high level concept the mind didn&#39;t truly want to fathom it and to her you had simply become Steve.<br />
<br />
Back at the kitchen table, David looked a bit anxious for some reason. &quot;What&#39;s the matter, David?&quot; You asked. &quot;Well... This is really hard to tell you guys, but...&quot; He trailed off. &quot;But?&quot; Cathy pondered. &quot;I want you to meet my girlfriend&quot;. David said. Cathy now giving David her full attention, not looking at the eggs she was frying at all. You could tell she was a bit upset - but gave you a knowing look. You had prepared for this. Even if you were Steve now and Cathy your lover, not your mom, it still obviously felt weird for her to hear that the man she married so long ago was now bringing home a girl. And weird for you as well. Had you two not been fucking each other like two newly weds these last months you probably couldn&#39;t have handled this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh&quot; you said. &quot;When?&quot; You asked. &quot;In 20 minutes?&quot; David said in a question-like manner. &quot;And maybe she can stay over?&quot; he added. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, Sure.&quot; Cathy responded. &quot;That&#39;s fine, just fine&quot;. Clearly a little bit taken. A loud pop coming from the egg in the pan. It was burning. Which made Cathy instead focus on cooking again. <br />
<br />
Soon David got a call and came back in with his girlfriend. It was Molly. She was a cute girl. Asian American and really petite. Guess David was trying something new after 20 plus years of being with Cathy. You looked over at Cathy that seemed, to your surprise, seemed genuinely okay with it all. Happy for David even. The shock from before merely temporary. <br />
<br />
The day went on without any incidents and before you knew it, you were in your bedroom with Cathy, about to go to bed. &quot;That went fine&quot; you said aloud. &quot;It did, didn&#39;t it? And Molly was quite a nice girl. I just hope they&#39;re using protection if they&#39;re active.&quot; She responded. &quot;At first, I thought it would be weird, but I truly just see David as my son now.&quot; She added. <br />
<br />
&quot;You know, I kind of see him as my son to.&quot; You answered. &quot;Well, I think he sees you as the father as well. And I mean, I guess that&#39;s how it is now. I&#39;ve gotten to terms with it.&quot; she responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, we&#39;ve been avoided pushing the beds together. But I want to sleep next to you. And as an upside, more room to fuck&quot; Cathy said. You agreed. That night you slept together in the same bed for the first time. You had now truly moved on. As you drifted off to sleep, you couldn&#39;t help but feel happy for David. And excited for your future.</p>
