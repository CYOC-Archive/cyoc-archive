<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Trevor Tyson was a perfect gentleman on his date with Melissa Jenkins.<br />
He was kind, gentle. Listened to everything she said and shared his own thoughts on many subjects too.<br />
Now, as he was driving her back home, Trevor wondered aloud, &quot;I don&#39;t know how to phrase this question properly, so forgive me if it comes out wrong, but back when you said there should be a right reason, how do you know when, let alone what it is?&quot;<br />
Melissa had to think long and hard about that before she could give him any response.<br />
Finally, she said, &quot;Truthfully? My mom didn&#39;t have much information about that either. But she did say when both of you feel whatever that reason is here,&quot; Melissa added, pointing to her heart, &quot;then you have it.&quot;<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; was Trevor&#39;s only reply, considering what his date said. &quot;Your mom and mine sound a lot alike. I think they would have gotten along great.&quot;<br />
&quot;I think so too,&quot; agreed Melissa. &quot;I know I&#39;m crazy about her son,&quot; as she leaned against him as much as her seat belt would allow.<br />
<br />
The rest of the journey back to her house was pretty uneventful, despite there still being a police car outside because no one knew for sure where Alice Decrux was at the moment.<br />
Upon arrival, Trevor parked his pickup truck behind the Jenkins&#39; family car on the house driveway. Melissa went to unlock the front door while her boyfriend carried the now empty cooler.<br />
Being a werebull, Trevor didn&#39;t really need it, but Melissa noted that her father had left the front porch light on.<br />
Inside the house, Melissa was surprised to find both her father and Virginia McCoy, her next door neighbor, sitting on the couch together.<br />
They were both in their human forms and fully dressed, but Trevor didn&#39;t need were senses to know what they had been doing all afternoon and evening. The hair of both adults were still mussed up, and even Melissa could detect the hot and heavy lingering scent of sexual activity in the air.<br />
&quot;Did you have a nice time Mel?&quot; asked her father. While he was still adjusting to them, his new weretiger senses told him his only daughter was still a normal human being and not a werecow, so she didn&#39;t have sex with her boyfriend.<br />
<i>At least not tonight,</i> Harold Jenkins realized, steeling himself for the moment when not only did his daughter become sexually active, but also joined were society as well.<br />
&quot;Yes I did. You?&quot; Melissa asked in return, as Trevor sat the cooler down by the front door. She didn&#39;t have to glance at any clock to know that she was at least a good couple of hours ahead of her curfew, so didn&#39;t know why her father and his... lady were waiting for her.<br />
&quot;Actually, I did,&quot; admitted Harold, while giving Virginia a quick glance and a sly smile.<br />
Melissa and Trevor actually saw the high school history teacher briefly blush as her father added, &quot;We were waiting for you because Virginia has a question she needs to ask you.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; said Melissa, turning to face their guest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Should I leave?&quot; wondered Trevor.<br />
&quot;No, it&#39;s okay. You can hear this,&quot; was all Harold said in reply.<br />
&quot;What did you need to know Miss McCoy?&quot; asked Melissa.<br />
&quot;I was wondering...&quot; began Virginia, looking at the teenage girl quite seriously. &quot;Would you consider being my Maid of Honor at our wedding?&quot; she asked, while taking Harold&#39;s hand in hers.<br />
&quot;I-&quot; began Melissa, and then stopped upon realizing what Virginia McCoy had just asked her.<br />
Trevor started smiling upon realizing what the question meant, but his girlfriend simply stood there, staring at her father and his... fiance.<br />
A moment later, when there was still no response from Melissa, Trevor feared, &quot;I think you might have broken her.&quot;<br />
&quot;Mel?&quot; began Harold with a bit of concern, as the two adults started to stand up.<br />
Finally, Melissa snapped out of her surprised expression and said, &quot;Congratulations you two!&quot; as she rushed to hug them.<br />
When he had the chance, Trevor didn&#39;t hesitate to shake Mister Jenkins&#39; hand, but wasn&#39;t sure how to respond to his history teacher, until McCoy hugged him.<br />
&quot;So when, how?&quot; began Melissa, wanting all the details.<br />
&quot;While you were gone. I realized that after all these years, my mourning was over. Virginia&#39;s the one, so I asked and she said yes,&quot; replied her father.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m glad,&quot; said Melissa, wiping a tear of joy from her eye. &quot;Now that you don&#39;t have to worry about facing possible Statute 1A charges for allegedly changing my father into a were against his will.&quot;<br />
&quot;In hindsight, my transformation might have been a bit premature, but I meant what I said. It&#39;s time to get on with my life, and Virginia&#39;s the one I want to do it with. Especially now that I&#39;ll have a couple of extra centuries to experience as a were,&quot; explained Harold.<br />
&quot;I hate to run the risk of ruining the moment, but what about Alice Decrux?&quot; asked Trevor.<br />
&quot;I made Harold promise me that he&#39;d let the police handle her,&quot; revealed Virginia, before giving her fiance a quick peck on the cheek.<br />
&quot;Say honey, now that Mel&#39;s home,&quot; began Harold, &quot;do you think we can...&quot; as he started whispering in Virginia&#39;s ear.<br />
Melissa was still a normal human, with all a normal&#39;s senses, but seeing both Virginia and Trevor blush (because his were hearing accidentally overheard what Harold asked) made her realize what her father&#39;s question probably was.<br />
&quot;You two go ahead, and have fun,&quot; said Melissa. &quot;I&#39;m going to say good night to Trevor and then go to bed.&quot;<br />
&quot;Okay. Thanks Mel,&quot; said her father, before giving his daughter a quick but chaste peck on the cheek.<br />
Virginia just said &quot;Thanks again Mel. We&#39;ll go over the details later,&quot; she added with a smile, as Harold grabbed his fiance by the hand and started leading her to the kitchen and the back door of the house, leaving Melissa and Trevor all alone in the living room.</p>
