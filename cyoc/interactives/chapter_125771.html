<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake and his dad lived alone in a small apartment. Well, they used to, apparently now its just Jake. Jake freaked out several times but couldn&#39;t bring himself to take off the underwear, not because it felt good, which it did. But because it somehow made him feel close to his dad and he couldn&#39;t bear the thought of staring at the underwear and his dad not appearing out of them.<br />
<br />
Plus its early, his dad may just be out for a jog. Jake had never known his dad to exercise ever, but desperate times call for desperate lies to yourself.<br />
<br />
Jake begged his dad to press the button to return. Jake appealed to his dad&#39;s parental duty by threatening to drink his beer in the fridge, He plucked at his father&#39;s heartstrings by rambling on about how he needs his dad to help him through high-school... always tying it back to clicking, from the underwear&#39;s point of view, the &quot;end happiness&quot; button. The perpetual orgasm would stop if that button was pressed and so it really wasn&#39;t an option. <br />
<br />
Jake rambled for hours trying to convince his dad to come back to him, sobbing and thinking about how he was an orphan. He emotionally exhausted himself and fell asleep trying to cut his dad a deal where he can take a vacation and be underwear every other Saturday.<br />
<br />
&quot;How to fix this?&quot; the underwear wondered. Only the faintest inkling of Jake&#39;s father&#39;s personality remained. Jake&#39;s father now thought of himself entirely as underwear, and Jake is Master now. Master and his fleshy body need things that underwear had when underwear transcended.<br />
<br />
The conscientiousness that once was a curious single father erupted in glee as it realized it can pass on its fleshy knowledge and let go completely of its previous life. The fleshy master will then know what to do and underwear will serve the fleshy master!<br />
<br />
Jake fell asleep on his father&#39;s bed hoping beyond hope that his dad would come home and yell at him for not sleeping in his own bed. If that were to happen Jake would have a really hard time explaining why he was wearing his dad&#39;s underwear, and Jake prayed he had that problem. <br />
<br />
Sometime very shortly after he fell asleep, the underwear began teleporting a sedative into Jake&#39;s bloodstream from the other dimension. It was utilizing the mass from Jake&#39;s 235 lb father to synthesize the chemicals and transport it back into Jake. Once enough had gone into Jake the next phase began. All the fleshy memories and thoughts that Jake&#39;s father could purge he did. The underwear recounted it one last time, and Jake lived it as though it was happening to him. All the fleshy knowledge that could be recounted, was.<br />
<br />
High school, learning to drive, college, college parties, meeting Jake&#39;s mother, becoming a father, changing diapers, working various jobs, fixing things up around the house... Some of the fleshy thoughts were initially going to be held back from the master but as the consciousness   gave its humanity and experience away to Jake, there was less and less context. It quickly degraded to passing on all fleshy memories.<br />
<br />
From Jake&#39;s perspective, he continued his life to the point of having himself as an infant and raising himself as a child. Somewhere along the line, however, while raising himself as a child he was also living a second childhood.<br />
<br />
After passing on high school football practice memories and looking at the college and adult knowledge that would soon be passed on, the consciousness realized that Master&#39;s body is not capable like the memories he was passing on. At this point the consciousness decided to also create specialized helper hormones to speed up the natural aging process and allow master to siphon off the battery. Some part of the consciousness railed against this but was silenced when reminded that this was necessary for transcending into underwear-ness. <br />
<br />
Jake awoke to a burning sensation on his groin. &quot;Hot, hot, so hot!&quot; Realizing it was coming from his underwear he quickly ripped it off  flinging it into the hallway. The rubber retained its shape for a few seconds more before succumbing to gravity. A few seconds later the underwear was so hot it no longer retained its shape, it was just a pile of goo and it was at this point it seemed to begin cooling down.<br />
<br />
Several hours ago the consciousness that was Jake&#39;s father, gave up so much of itself that, like a drug addict, the underwear began a downward spiral doing anything to increase the self pleasure it felt. It stopped sedating Jake or controlling him in any way. Jake was reliving his father&#39;s 5th grade health class when he was abruptly left to process 30 ish years of memories that were suddenly dumped on him. The underwear didn&#39;t understand what Jake was or why it was interacting with him the way it had been. Instead of focusing its energies outward  it diverted more and more of its energies inward and slowly built into a meltdown reaction over time.  In the other dimension there was a nuclear reaction that converted the remaining mass directly into energy.<br />
<br />
(I tried to leave a ton of room for the next writer. <br />
The simple questions are: <br />
Age - The underwear didnt know or understand how effective the process was.<br />
Appearance - he may look the same or only slightly different for a while before, the full effects work their way through his system.<br />
is he still aging rapidly, how long was he sedated,<br />
Potentially complicated questions are: <br />
Jake&#39;s mental age - The process stopped after Jake had been an adult but while he was reliving childhood, did this mentally regress or progress him?<br />
How did Jake interpret the memories - Did he recognize that he was getting his dad&#39;s perspectiveor is he going to start looking for his son and live the rest of his life as his father?<br />
and so on. )</p>
