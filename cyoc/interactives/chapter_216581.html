<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the car slowed down, Jeff was forced to put the Chronivac safely away and look out the window for the first time. They were approaching a mansion perched precariously on the side of a cliff. Below it was a sheer face of dusty red rock and a few stocky plants that clung to whatever ridges they could find. Around the narrow, winding road, huge eucalypts swayed in the hot breeze, and Jeff wondered, not for the first time, how he&#39;d ended up in this situation.<br />
<br />
Jeff had attended a private school in his youth, along with a fellow classmate and young billionaire, Cleopatra Hartley. He, not realising who she was, had commented on the pretentious nature of her name, and she laughed, and the two became good friends. At least until Cleo&#39;s parents pulled her out of the &#39;common&#39; private school, and flew in private tutors from around the world. He didn&#39;t hear from her again.<br />
<br />
Not, at least, until five years later. Jeff had started his own business as a physical trainer, which was a struggling business for a college dropout with not a certification to their name. Then, one day, completely out of the blue, he was contacted by someone looking for one-on-one coaching with him in particular, who was willing to pay for him to fly out to Australia for a private fitness retreat. While he wasn&#39;t so happy at being shipped halfway across the world, the pay would last him a lifetime, and they promised plenty of exposure to other high-profile customers. He agreed, of course, and it was only after he found out who it was he would be training...<br />
<br />
There was a loud cough. &quot;We have arrived, Master Moore.&quot; The driver, a stern man who had only given the name &#39;Hale&#39;, turned to stare at him. &quot;I would suggest you should get yourself ready for the young mistress.&quot;<br />
<br />
The car turned into the driveway, gravel crunching under the tires, as Jeff got his first good look at the mansion before him. It certainly dwarfed his tiny apartment and even his whole complex in size. The front yard had a circular driveway with an ornate fountain in the centre that would have at least been as long as a running track. Not to mention the amount of energy and water that must be wasted to keep the lush topiaries so green in such an arid environment. As the car pulled to a halt, an entire panel of glass and concrete shifted to welcome them.<br />
<br />
A girl stepped out the door. She was quite short, at only 5&#39;3, with a mess of frizzy red curls and freckles. She was wearing a tight, green dress which, while Jeff knew cost more than his house, seemed to hang off her skinny form in such an unflattering way. Hale cleared his throat, interrupting Jeff&#39;s staring, so he could lead him towards the young mistress. &quot;Miss Hartley, Master Moore has arrived.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I can see that,&quot; she snapped, before running up to pull him into a hug. &quot;Jeffy! Good to see you!&quot;<br />
<br />
He gave an awkward pat back. &quot;You too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s been so long since I&#39;ve seen you. You&#39;ve changed so much. And you finally had a growth spurt!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And it looks like you haven&#39;t,&quot; he retorted. Then he realised what he&#39;d said and blushed. Hale gave him a disapproving glare. But Cleo quickly laughed it off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you haven&#39;t changed a bit, have you? Now, come inside. It&#39;s too hot out here.&quot; She waved him up the stairs, before turning around and shouting at Hale, &quot;Oi, Hale, could you bring his bags in, please? He&#39;s sleeping in the master suite!&quot;<br />
<br />
Hale sighed but did as he was told. Jeff stared at him as Cleo led him inside. &quot;Welcome to my holiday home. It&#39;s a little small, but isn&#39;t it perfect for a health retreat? The forests, or &#39;the bush&#39; as the locals call it, are quite amazing. So isolated, and let me tell you, you&#39;ve never gone mountain biking until you&#39;ve done it in Australia.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff stared at her. Somehow, she&#39;d gotten even more detached from reality than she already was. But, he wasn&#39;t sure how to point that out, instead switching the subject. &quot;Um, so you wanted me to train you in cycling?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, silly. I&#39;m training to become a triathlete!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh? And you need to train in Australia for that?&quot;<br />
<br />
She laughed. &quot;Of course you do, if you want to be an adventure triathlete, at least. If I&#39;m prepared to go swimming in a river full of crocodiles, anything less will be easy!&quot; She cocked her head as a bell rang. &quot;Ah, sounds like dinner&#39;s ready. Come on, Fabian&#39;s food is to die for.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, just let me wash up and see my room first. I&#39;ll be out in a second.&quot; Jeff rushed off to his room, his ensuite alone the size of his entire apartment, and splashed some water on his face. He still felt as though he was dreaming. And, when he didn&#39;t, he was keenly aware of the bundle of nerves broiling in his stomach. <br />
<br />
If he couldn&#39;t train this stick-thin girl to be a pro athlete in just three months, he didn&#39;t want to think about what her parents might do to him. He&#39;d be ruined! On the other hand, training Cleo seemed like an impossible task, even for a world-class fitness coach. What was he supposed to do?<br />
<br />
A glint caught his eye in the reflection of the mirror. Jeff turned to find the corner of the Chronivac peeking out from his bag as if answering his question. The nervous knots in his stomach began to unwind. If he could use the evolution package on Cleo, he might stand a chance at completing the impossible task. He could turn this, gangly girl into an athletic bombshell... or even further. Now ideas were stewing in his mind, of all the things he could do to Cleo. He could make her more beautiful, or he could make her a musclebound brute. He could even make her male, or evolve her into a completely alien species. He-<br />
<br />
&quot;JEFF!&quot; A shrill voice echoed down the hall.<br />
<br />
He needed to get to dinner. Jeff gave one last look at the Chronivac, vowing that he would be back to use it. Tomorrow, Cleo would start her <em>training</em>. Right now, though, he needed to hurry before the spoilt mistress lost her temper.</p>
