<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Melissa observed what class she was in currently. History class, first period on a Monday morning, it really fucking sucked though the topic at hand was not the most boring thing to be taught. It was lesson on Jack the ripper.<br />
<br />
Looking around, she knew that others were more disturbed by the material while others were disturbingly intrigued. A prolific serial killer that was attributed to the murder of 5 prostitutes with many believing he killed even more. A truly despicable man which Melissa previously didn&#39;t hate as much, somehow being a female she despised even more. The app must have made her more emotional then before.<br />
<br />
Looking back around, there was atleast 16 others in the class with her. Perhaps the most prominent few were Jessica, Ryan and Mia.<br />
<br />
First, there was Jessica, the school&#39;s Queen (bitch). Practically the stereotype through a through. Hot, blonde, captain of the cheer, dating a model, and a complete and utterly evil bitch. As Marcus, Melissa could appreciate how hot Jessica was, but as Melissa, she despised her now. Memories that Melissa didn&#39;t have before, new ones that had formed due to her new gender, had found that her relationship with Jessica had a much greater impact. Jessica barely interacted with Marcus, but the amount of cat fights Melissa and Jessica had was unrivaled. Somehow that much could change with a relationship if genders got swapped.<br />
<br />
The next individual was Ryan, the school&#39;s football captain. He&#39;s basically a himbo with a heart of gold. Practically every student respects him and many of the teachers do as well. Despite his admittedly awful grades which he tries to improve on, his kindness and skill goes above and beyond. He&#39;s known to help out the community and volunteer at day cares. His achievements in sports are not to scoff at either. As Marcus, they didn&#39;t really interact with each other much but had friendly conversation during P.E. but as Melissa, her memories told her that she in fact, tutors him (which is another reason why Jessica despises her). New memories also told her of some rather... arousing memories and fantasies she has had of Ryan. While never ever getting to asking him to go out with her, one of the memories she remembered was one of Ryan putting her into some interesting sex plays. <br />
<br />
As for the final individual, Mia, she was practically Marcus&#39; best friend before the genderswap. They knew other since they were young and grew up quite close to each other. At some point, Marcus developed a crush on her, but things seem different now. Despite the obvious change in gender, Melissa was very similar to Marcus. Mia seemed hugely different then before though. Instead of being a bit of a goth, she now easily appeared to be a part of Jessica&#39;s squad. Her appearance was now trying to replicate the popular bitch and memories surfaced to Melissa&#39;s mind of how in this life, Mia and Melissa had a falling out which caused their relationship to split and what once was a good friend, was now a bitch even worse then Jessica. <br />
<br />
The only other notable individual was perhaps the teacher, Mr Fritz. A rather old, German man who seemed to have fought in a few wars if his scars were anything to go by. Despite his somewhat intimidating appearance, he was a respectable teacher who could be a little strict at times. If he was teaching about wars in history, then he could teach with a passion despite how I could likely trigger any remaining ptsd. But despite the risk, he teaches anyway <br />
<br />
Somewhat surprised, happy and saddened  with how the dynamic with the 3 notable students in the class, Melissa got out her phone with the app and saw a sentence generate. Surprisingly, it didn&#39;t actually correlate to anyone in the room but the historical topic of Jack the ripper.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jack the ripper was a prolific serial killer that murdered 5 prostitutes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Seeing the timer countdown, Melissa didn&#39;t really rush to change anything because she wanted to see how the app would add to her addition. When the hesitated bar appeared, Melissa altered prostitutes to aristocrats. What the app changed was in fact the name of Jack. The app changed Jack to Jackie for some reason, which once Melissa put her phone in her pocket, became clear as to what actually occurred.<br />
<br />
As for Melissa&#39;s change, it was clear that the 5 prostitutes were replaced by 5 notable aristocrats, self explanatory. As for what the app did, It did quite a bit. A lot of the notes and evidence had altered to point towards Jackie being a prostitute hired by the aristocrats, who were then murdered by her using what seemed to be surgical scissors used during childbirth. The noted pointed towards Jackie being a prostitute who was abused by aristocrats and lost her son due to one of them and the murders were revenge in the upper class. Her identity never got found but the impact of both Jack and Jackie the ripper were the same.<br />
<br />
It was actually quite intriguing to see the changes in history.</p>
