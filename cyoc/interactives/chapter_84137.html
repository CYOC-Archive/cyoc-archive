<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Okay... the mission is largely two fold,&quot; Raul said to the other Kats with him, &quot;Since the spreading vaccine is helping curtail the virus&#39;s spread, the lust factor should be getting less of a major issue...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Provided someone hasn&#39;t mutated the virus,&quot; Lia warned.<br />
<br />
&quot;For the moment we haven&#39;t seen that,&quot; Raul answered, &quot;Si Lang&#39;s friends have been attaching new animal strains, but that&#39;s so far been the general limit to it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It still doesn&#39;t change the possibility,&quot; Midnight spoke up from beside her sither, &quot;We&#39;re all certain we&#39;ve got help... and even if they only know the basics... if they have Maurice and Snowy&#39;s original formula, they have all they need to create new Kats. All they need to do is alter the virus in some way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How could the virus be altered?&quot; the police chief asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;That we don&#39;t really know,&quot; Luna answered, &quot;Maurice and Snowy have been theorizing on various ways it could be altered, so that way they can alter the vaccines as necessary, but so far they haven&#39;t fully figured that out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And for the moment, we&#39;ll need to consider ourselves lucky,&quot; Raul answered, &quot;and we must do all we can to get the Kats here back to their senses and get some leads...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what is your plan, General?&quot; Talia asked, using a professional courtesy, even if Raul had officially retired from the military.<br />
<br />
&quot;Talia... if you can, see if you can talk to the ones that have become dolphins... Dolphkats, though you may need to be careful to keep your feather&#39;s dry,&quot; Raul began, &quot;Lia, Luna, Midnight, and Ryles you are to go and start vaccinate those that have transformed and try to get them to calm down.&quot;<br />
<br />
They all nodded and proceeded to gather the supplies they had with them, as well as street maps of Rio De Janeiro. While they did that, Raul turned to the police chief as another Kat approached. Shi was another Fennec Fox based Foxkat. The police chief looked to hir as shi approached.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Agent Maria Lafayette,&quot; the new Foxkat spoke with a calm and mature voice, indicating that shi had been older before becoming a Foxkat, &quot;You may call me Maria.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pleased to meet you,&quot; the policeman answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Could you take us to your prisoner?&quot; Raul asked, &quot;We can then question him and take him into custody and see what Li Sang is up to and where he might have his lab, if he does have one.&quot;<br />
<br />
The police chief nodded.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Midnight, Luna, and all moved together with a relatively easy jog. The sounds of mating weren&#39;t as common as in other areas, but then, as the policeman had said, the bigger issue was more that some of the newly changed Kats seemed distressed that their &quot;mates&quot; didn&#39;t change with them. As they made their way into the city, that was precisely what they ran into.<br />
<br />
&quot;Davi! Davi! Oh Davi!&quot; <br />
<br />
The voice was distressed. It was not the pleasured cries that nearly every Kat was used to when they heard the choice of words. That got the three of them to rush forward and move around a corner where they found what looked like a massive Scarlet Macaw. Its arms were completely covered in feathers, though Midnight and Luna noticed that Mackat had three tiny fingers at the apex of the wings and had them wrapped around a naked human male.<br />
<br />
&quot;Davi! Por que você não me ama, Davi?&quot; the Mackat moaned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do either of you know Portuguese?&quot; Midnight asked, knowing what the language of Brazil was.<br />
<br />
Luna reached into hir purse and pulled out a small guide book and a note with written records of what to say to inquire to see if they knew English. They then approached carefully, the man looked somewhat fearful and was visibly trembling but was unable to escape the Mackat&#39;s grasp.<br />
<br />
&quot;Por favor me ame, Davi!&quot; the Mackat gave a pained moan again and clutched the man to hir.<br />
<br />
&quot;Desculpe-me, você fala Inglês?&quot; Luna asked as shi and hir sither approached.<br />
<br />
The Mackat looked up to them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wolfkats!&quot; the Mackat gasped in surprise and seemed to actually grip the man protectively, &quot;O que você está fazendo aqui? Tomou o amor do meu companheiro para me dele?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Voce fala Ingles?&quot; Luna repeated the earlier question.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; the Mackat said slowly, &quot;though it is weak...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s better than our Portuguese,&quot; Midnight quipped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why are you here Wolfkats?&quot; the Mackat answered slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re here to help you,&quot; Luna answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll help?&quot; the Mackat asked, &quot;You&#39;ll make Davi become a Kat and love me again?&quot;<br />
<br />
Luna and Midnight turned to the man in the Mackat&#39;s wings. He looked even more terrified now at the sight of Midnight and Luna.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure he loves you already... uh...&quot; Luna began.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yarah,&quot; the Mackat spoke, &quot;my name is Yarah.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He probably does love you Yarah,&quot; Midnight commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;But we were walking earlier in the morning... and there was a sort of a poof and I grew these beautiful feathers and I tried to love him so he would become my hir,&quot; Yarah answered and began to cry, &quot;but Davi didn&#39;t change... he didn&#39;t get an erection... he didn&#39;t stroke my...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Penis,&quot; Luna supplied the English word.<br />
<br />
&quot;He likely either has Type O blood with partial D antigens or has been vaccinated against the Chakat Virus,&quot; Midnight commented, &quot;He can&#39;t change, but that doesn&#39;t mean he doesn&#39;t you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But...&quot; Yarah began.<br />
<br />
Luna moved around and sat down beside Yarah and began to pet hir back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Love doesn&#39;t care about our forms,&quot; Luna said, trying to sound as comforting as shi could, &quot;One of my Aunts is a Chakat and hir mate is a Foxkat... and Cats and Foxes are not in the same animal family... Foxes are wild dogs and cats are obviously cats.  Some of my other relatives are still human....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Our mother and father are Chakats and we&#39;re Wolfkats,&quot; Midnight added, &quot;and all of them love us very much.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They... they do?&quot; Yarah asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, and proving their love for us does not require raping them,&quot; Luna explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;But... but I&#39;m so horny,&quot; Yarah almost whimpered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sex isn&#39;t love,&quot; Luna corrected, &quot;it can be a wonderful show of love... but simply having sex isn&#39;t love... especially when your intended partner is scared speechless.&quot;<br />
<br />
That was wen Yarah realized that Davi was terrified of hir and released him. He stumbled back nervously but didn&#39;t really move and put his hands down to his waist to cover his privates.<br />
<br />
&quot;Davi, eu sinto muito,&quot; Yarah said in Portuguese.<br />
<br />
Davi didn&#39;t answer but stood there terrified. It took him a few moments but eventually he turned Luna and Midnight and said slowly, &quot;can you turn Yarah back?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Luna sighed, &quot;Once one becomes a Kat... he or she or rather shi cannot go back. My sither and I were transformed in the Paris outbreak... I was twelve, she was six and we&#39;ve been Kats ever since...&quot;<br />
<br />
Davi blinked and looked a bit depressed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Weren&#39;t Maurice and Snowy talking about some new varent for the Chakat serum?&quot; Midnight wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... by attaching it to the specific hormones when aroused to give a person who wants to be a Kat the ability to be a Kat when they want to be, but can return to human form if their situation or their culture is resistant to a Kat&#39;s presence... when they&#39;re aroused their Kats, but when they&#39;re not they return to human form... but they&#39;re still finalizing the tests on the computer models and are waiting for a human volunteer... and even if it was ready... it won&#39;t work on those of us that are already Kats.&quot;<br />
<br />
Davi again looked depressed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Você ainda me ama, Davi?&quot; Yarah asked nervously.<br />
<br />
The man, Davi slowly looked to Yarah. Shi stood there, hir very bird-like penis still standing errect through the red feathers on hir belly and the the gold, blue and red feathers on hir wings looking bright in the sun. The white feathers that formed large circular rings around hir eyes and sat beside hir beak framed very fearful eyes that surprised Davi.<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s still who she was before? Personality wise I mean?&quot; Davi asked to Luna.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Luna answered, &quot;Probably far more amorous now that shi is a Kat, but to a great extent her personality probably hasn&#39;t changed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Davi then turned back to Yarah, &quot;Isso só me pegou de surpresa, Yarah. Pensei em ambos foram vacinadas contra o vírus. Eu amo você.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, the two hugged in a friendly way and Yarah looking greatly relieved. As they pulled apart, Luna administered the vaccine so that Yarah couldn&#39;t spread the virus to anyone else who hadn&#39;t been vaccinated yet. Yarah thanked them and to Luna and Midnight&#39;s surprise, gripped Davi by his arms with hir bird like feet and actually began to fly off towards a nearby apartment building. Luna and Midnight sighed when they heard more sounds, this time actually sounding like a pair of Kats mating with each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;Back to work, sith,&quot; Luna sighed.</p>
