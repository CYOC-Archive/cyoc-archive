<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Well this is really damn weird... nice having fingers again but groceries are going to be an issue,&quot; Flora said to herselves... quite literally. She spent a while staring back and forth. She was fairly used to her new body by now but didn&#39;t own a full length mirror, so there was a lot to take in. Assuming Lost had finally checked back in, she moved over to her computer, spare body getting in the way somewhat, but she managed to get one into the chair, pulled up CYOC, and had a look. Sure enough, an update! From someone new though... who seemed downright eager to get in on things at that. She thought for a moment and started typing. Her other body smirked, mischievously saying &quot;Of course if I&#39;m having to double up on food, might as well give them a similar taste, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, far away from the pair of unicorns, Moss had only just set down his phone, when he noticed all his clothes suddenly feeling quite constricting. Awkwardly, he dropped his pants down around his knees, and started unbuttoning his shirt, just as he noticed a thin white fuzz sprouting from his arms and exposed thighs. &quot;... is this really working?&quot; he asked in surprise, as the changes continued.<br />
<br />
Everything was getting thicker. His feet were stretching out, toes fusing into hooves as he struggled to get his pants off a pair of increasingly thick and bestial legs. A thin tail quickly sprouted, just as he finally got them off. Surprised, he tried to turn and get a good look, but lost his balance and fell to the floor. Curiously, he didn&#39;t land on his hands and knees though. His feet were still firmly planted on the floor. Well, at least the tips of his toes were. Hooves now really, he had to admit. He&#39;d also caught himself on the tips of his fingers, where his nails had all thickened and darkened, becoming sort of semi-hooves, not unlike the ones he&#39;d described for Flora.<br />
<br />
Moss clopped forward a bit, trying to regain a sense of balance and maybe help himself back to his feet by leaning on a sturdy table, but the pain of his still tightening shirt was quite distracting. It was a huge relief when it finally gave out, buttons popping off and scattering across the floor and sleeves tearing as that painful tightness left his chest, replaced with an odd tug and a swaying feeling.<br />
<br />
Climbing up with the help of the table he was able to get a look down at himself, and immediately noticed a simply enormous pair of breasts he was not sporting. Raising a hand to give them a feel, he was a bit surprised as he brushed up against yet another breast. It seemed he had four, the lower pair a big smaller than the top, but still the size of cantalopes.<br />
<br />
Before he could step away, he felt a sudden splitting headache, as his eye sockets widened and pulled out some to either side, and a stubby pair of horns pushed out from his head. He was also fairly sure his ears were stretching out to the sides, and definitely saw his lips pushing out as his face reshaped into a muzzle. Gritting his teeth from the pain, he also noticed how off they felt. Thicker and flatter on the bottom, barely even there on top. &quot;&quot;What&#39;th necth?&quot; he asked allowed, with a sudden lisp.<br />
<br />
The changes seem to have stopped, or at least slowed down, as Moss tried to shake off the headache and get his footing again. Looking down he was covered in white fur, aside from those massive pink boobs, which still seemed quite hairless. Here and there though the fur was turning a pale blueish green in large patchy spots. The hair he&#39;d started with was also growing out, really thickening into tight curls, which as he tugged one into view were the same shade as the spots.<br />
<br />
Slowly he stepped away from the table, having a hard time finding his balance. It was a bit like walking on tiptoes and hard not to wobble between all the added weight on his chest, and hips that felt at least twice as wide as what he&#39;d started with. He was pretty curvy all over, honestly. Chubby arms, chubby legs, thighs rubbing together, and just a bit of a gut. He was also definitely a good head or two shorter than he had been... with most of that height seeming to have been lost as his legs had gotten all bent and stubby. He could walk on them well enough with a little practice, but some experimentation proved he was a little more comfortable down on all fours... even if those massive boobs almost brushed along the carpet like that.<br />
<br />
His vision really felt off though. He could see much more of the room at once than usual, but his depth perception felt screwy, like he always had one eye closed. Suddenly his stomach started rumbling in a distressing fashion, so he ran to the bathroom. He wasn&#39;t sure if he was going to puke or something was going to come out the other end, but it felt like someone was making balloon animals out of his insides. Growing extra stomachs maybe?<br />
<br />
No sooner did that internal distress begin to settle, suddenly he was sporting a throbbing erection, so hard it was a bit painful. He barely reached the toilet as it started spurting on its own. At first it felt great, and he let out a long involuntary moo from the pleasure, but Moss started to worry as it just kept coming, like every last drop was draining out of him. Once it finally stopped, he went to clean himself off, only to find his genitals shrinking and pulling up inside him, finishing his change to an undeniably female anthro cow. As what was left of his balls reformed into the lips of her new vagina, there was an odd tingling deep within her as the more internal portions of her new anatomy took shape.<br />
<br />
Panting and out of breath, she half crawled to the mirror for a look at herself. She was pretty cute, honestly. Big expressive green eyes, pouty lips, that oh so curly hair. It didn&#39;t feel like looking at a stranger though, just herself. Good ol&#39; Missy. The chubby little cow girl the world would now see her as.<br />
<br />
Flora yawned as she finished her addition. She&#39;d been up all night, and now she had to deal with cramming two bodies into a single bed. It had been hard enough learning not to scrape her horn against the headboard, now she was going to have to get comfortable while just sort of... spooning with herself. She sighed, and hit post.</p>
