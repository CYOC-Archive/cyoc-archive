<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Twenty-four hours?  Jen thought it out.  So, by this time tomorrow I will be a sick, rubber, doll?  She looked at the clock.  It read almost too late to get to school.  She would have to borrow her brother's car.  He would not mind being away at university.  Anyway he had given Jen permission to use it in emergencies so long as she filled the tank.<br />
<br />
Jen rushed tossing the various things she needed for school into her bag.  She stopped in his room to grab the spare keys from the dish.  She would have to remember to put them back when she got home.  He was kind of a dick about not moving things in his room.  Then she was out the door.<br />
<br />
The shitty car he left in the dive was dirty from having been left under a tree for a month or two.  It smelled funny inside too; like musty fabric and week-old coffee cups.  Jen briefly thought about running back inside the house for a towel to sit on.  She did not want to ruin her fabulous cheer outfit.  Tossing her bag into the passenger seat she heard a crunch.  Hoping it was not one of the expensive bottles of body-scent she kept in there, she jumped into the driver side.<br />
<br />
Something else squeaked as she sat down.  It must have been the seat, Jen thought.  She bounced a few times to see if she could get the same noise but was disappointed.  Oh, well, she thought, just so long as the car does not fall apart as I drive.  The car started and she closed the door.  School would not wait and she had no time to spare thinking about phantom sounds and funny smells.<br />
<br />
As she drove to school Jen's mind once again thought about the funny call from that kid, Kyle.  The nerve of that kid to just call her up like it was no big deal, was just too much.  How had he even gotten her number?  And the stupidity of using the Town Curse or some silly rot, on her like magic was real or something.  She had heard about the curse when she was like eight.  She had even tried to invoke the curse once with her friend Marsha during that one sleep over.  Jen had tried to turn Marsha into a mermaid, then Marsha would have turned Jen into a princess.  It did not work then and it did not work now.<br />
<br />
As she drove through the busy streets of her town she was constantly on and off the break and gas.  Every time she lifted her leg to switch between the peddles she heard the same seat squeak she had heard when she sat down.  It was difficult to place the sound.  It was sort of like a creaking, rubbing sound.  One that she had heard before but she could not remember what it was.  It was not a spring or metallic sound.  More like ... rubber tubing?<br />
<br />
That might explain the new smell that was wafting to her nose.  It was certainly not the melon-berry scent of the body mist she kept in her school-bag.  The bottle was not broken thankfully.  Her brother would kill her for making his car smell like a girl.  The new scent was one that was much more organic.  Oily almost but not mechanical.  Like a new pair of running shoes, almost.  But more specifically just the rubber.  It smelled like a bunch of balloons were hidden in the car, Jen decided.<br />
<br />
Then the origin of the sound came to her.  It was the same sound that you got when you rubbed two balloons together.  But it was quite and muffled like the pair of balloons were hidden under the seat of the car.  The noise sounded again when she pulled the clunker to a stop at the nearest space at her school.  The drive had actually been quicker than the bus trip she had missed.  She was actually early for class after being late to leave.  The irony would have been more apparent to Jen if she was not so distracted by why her brother would hide inflated balloons in his car.<br />
<br />
Jen twisted around to look in the back seat.  The noise sounded from below her.  She sat up and tried to look under the driver-side seat for the balloons.  As she moved around to get the best look, she heard the sound again this time from up top.  How could a sound move?  The only thing moving in the car was her.  Was it following her?<br />
<br />
Jen sat very still for a moment, listening.  There was no sound.  Then she moved her arms.  Still there was no sound.  She tried spreading her knees a little then squeezing them together.  She heard the sound.  Every time she brought her legs together a sound of rubber on rubber squeak could be heard.  Curiosity got the better of Jen and she probed her legs looking for anything to explain things.<br />
<br />
She poked and podded her legs finding nothing.  She touched at her skirt finding nothing.  But she found something between her legs.  Jen pushed and there was a squeak.  She pushed harder and she could feel a rubbery, sliding, bouncy feeling as her finger pushed hard into her crotch.  The balloon on balloon sound was coming from her pussy.<br />
<br />
Taking a look around to make sure she was alone, Jen slid a hand under her waist line.  The finger tips found a patch of smooth rubber covering her skin.  The edge formed a tiny seam with her skin.  On one side there was skin and on the other rubber.  As she quested deeper she could not find any pubic hair.  The rubber part or her flexed and bent like an under-filled balloon.  Then she found her lips.  Smooth and flexible and rubbery.  Under her hand she squished her pussy hearing and feeling the ballooniness that her body had become.<br />
<br />
Jen had done this before.  She had felt pleasure and heat when she touched herself down there.  Now, the only thing she felt was fear and revulsion.  She was becoming the rubber sex-doll that Kyle had cursed her to become.  Only a day away and she would be an inanimate sex-toy.  Even as her skin tingled with a bit of sexual stimulation she felt anything but arousal.  How was she going to get out of this?  And she still had to go to school.  Or maybe she could just run?</p>
