<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dylan Spence&#39;s heart was pounding in his chest what had to be a mile a minute, he guessed. If you asked him a month ago if he ever thought he&#39;d be thirstily kissing and making out with Allison, one of the most beautiful and popular girls around campus, he would&#39;ve bitterly laughed and asked if you were joking. Joking indeed. All Dylan could think was that this had to be some prank. Some sort of...of dream! Here he was! Making out with Allison, his cock hard as a rock in his pants. And...fuck. He could feel himself even leaking a little bit. He blushed at that - he didn&#39;t want to come too soon, that&#39;d be majorly uncool.<br />
<br />
Let alone cum from just...just kissing her like this. He needed...needed to get himself de-escalated. Was she really gonna touch him? Dylan breathed and separated momentarily from her as she lightly kissed his cheek, her hand moving and feeling his chest and stomach. Dylan knew well enough that even with his body muscled up more, looking better and more fit, he was still heftier than most guys and not in the kind of movie star shape women seemed to prefer in the guys they went out with.<br />
<br />
But as Allison felt up his stomach and chest, she didn&#39;t seem to mind his heftier build. If anything she seemed to appreciate how unconventional his body was by comparison. &quot;Shirt off...&quot; She moaned under her breath, and Dylan gulped. He knew where this was going to go before too long. But he didn&#39;t want to disappoint her. He wanted to help her, to do what he could to please her. So he went ahead and straightened up and took his shirt off.<br />
<br />
He heard her make a light gasping noise when she saw him - a noise Dylan had never thought a woman would make when he took his shirt off. She moved in again and started touching his broad shoulders first, his chair tilting with the way they were moving in it. He spoke, &quot;I err...maybe...maybe we should move away from the computers and stuff...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, you&#39;re right...mm, let&#39;s go to the couch.&quot; Allison answered, still heady with desire. She knew on some level she shouldn&#39;t be fucking around like this. But she also felt desperate, rather frightened and astonished by what was going on with the guys at school, and unsure about the future. She needed something like this to keep her head in it. To provide her with some comfort after some of the freakiest highs and lows of any high school.<br />
<br />
Dylan, shirtless and shivering, led the way over toward the couch downstairs, large enough to accommodate he and Allison&#39;s perspective tryst. The stocky young man watched her remove her shirt and fought down an immediate aroused response. He&#39;d let her lead the way rather than assert himself right now. She was the one instigating the encounter. He leaned back on the couch as Allison pressed herself against him, kissing his neck while her hands felt his stomach and chest - roughly palming his broad chest and powerful shoulders - and pressing her own groin against his.<br />
<br />
Dylan groaned and felt himself involuntarily thrust. He thought about the least sexy things possible, trying to fight off an early emission. He was so inexperienced though, and he was not very good at kissing either - the time he tried to kiss her being very sloppy. Though Allison didn&#39;t seem to mind too much. She just told him &quot;You&#39;re so adorable&quot;, and led the way on kissing him back. Dylan&#39;s blush resurfacing. He didn&#39;t even know where to go from here. Could he...could he...?<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m...I...&quot; Dylan groaned. He looked at her. She seemed so into this. But he remembered what went on earlier, and who she was with. Dylan didn&#39;t want to do something they&#39;d regret. And he didn&#39;t want the girl he liked to regret things about this. As hard as Dylan was right now, and as much as he&#39;d love to thrust that organ he never got to use with a girl before into her...he just couldn&#39;t let her run right ahead into this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Allison...are...are you sure this is what you want?&quot; Dylan said, managing to calm himself down. She kept touching him, kept rubbing him, in ways that excited all this new testosterone running in his body. Made him want to just strip down and press his cock in there. But he couldn&#39;t just do that now. Not when she was obviously distressed and acting on that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dylan...please...&quot; Allison murmured. &quot;I just...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure this is what you want?&quot; Dylan breathed and looked her in the eyes, &quot;I mean, I don&#39;t want you to make any mistakes here. I&#39;m not gonna sit here and fuck you and ruin your relationship. Just...are you completely sure about this?&quot;<br />
<br />
The break in the heady atmosphere seemed to also affect Allison. She realized shortly after what she was doing, who she was doing with, and the coping mechanism she almost used - unfair on Dylan, who just wanted some affection and loving and unfair on Kendall, who she almost well cheated on due to how she was so affected by the way things were going. She looked at the shirtless Dylan, still obviously worked up, and realized she had been doubly unfair to Dylan. Leading him on like that due to her own issues.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m...sorry,&quot; Allison started, leaning back and sitting down on the floor, &quot;I almost used you to deal with my own issues with all this. Dylan, I&#39;m so sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, it&#39;s alright. Just...let&#39;s try and focus on trying to figure out what&#39;s going on and all. I mean, I&#39;m flattered. Honestly, that was the most interest I ever got from a woman.&quot; Dylan chuckled, and then looked down at himself, &quot;I&#39;ll uh, just deal with what&#39;s going on. I mean, uh yeah, let&#39;s...&quot;<br />
<br />
Allison could tell he was awkwardly alluding to his own continued arousal. She herself was still feeling a little turned on. A rather perverted idea came to mind. She couldn&#39;t very well make out any more with Dylan, owing to their mutual realization and the fact she was still in a relationship with Kendall. But maybe... &quot;Hey, don&#39;t act like I&#39;m gonna make you work with a bone in your pocket. How about we both just...independently take care of our problems?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-You mean...masturbate? Right out in front of each other?&quot; Dylan gulped, blushing again and figuring that&#39;d be at least a compromise. &quot;Y-Yeah, this would be the point where I&#39;d jerk off if I was going it alone.&quot; A nod, and Allison gave the a-okay. Dylan didn&#39;t know how good he was with jerking off like this next to someone else jerking off. But if this was all good, well...<br />
<br />
Before long Allison brought down her panties and Dylan followed suit, taking off his briefs - the big guy still wore his tighty-whities - and Allison visibly gulped. Not exactly as big as Kendall, it was obvious that the change had just as well enhanced Dylan&#39;s masculine endowment. It was about seven inches long and thick as fuck - what he lacked in size he more than made up for in sheer girth. Dylan himself felt a sense of pride in his cock now that he didn&#39;t really feel before.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m...gonna start now, okay?&quot; He asked, looking over at Allison. She merely nodded and focused on herself.<br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
The sexual session ended, Chad and Alex started getting cleaned up. Seeing as that they were in very much a public place, they needed to make it look like nothing took place here. Nothing but a shower.<br />
<br />
&quot;...whew you really tested me there.&quot; Alex breathed and wiped some sweat off of his forehead - both from the workout and from the exertion of their sexual encounter. &quot;Well, she&#39;s really into history...and she&#39;s got a nice sense of humor. We both enjoy the same kind of humor.&quot; Alex had grown to enjoy how this seemed to go...maybe he could enjoy having Chad over for a threesome with Darlene. Yeah that did seem pretty engaging as an idea.<br />
<br />
Alex started to finish and then thought about how that encounter went. He had exploded into Chad like that as if he was a much younger man. It made him think.  ...Could it be true...? He thought back to Kendall and tried to wrack his brain on the idea. As much as he was distracted admittedly by how handsome Kendall was getting lately, the thought remained. He could not remember if Kendall always looked something like that.<br />
<br />
It wormed its way in, that doubt. He thought about what it meant. Could it be?<br />
<br />
Was he actually...changing somehow? Surely not. People didn&#39;t just regress to a younger age. Such was the subject of fantasy, of stories of fountains of youth and misplaced spanish conquistadors. He was...just shaping up. Obviously, Alex thought as he looked at his reflection. Obviously. He was 60 years old and he looked it...didn&#39;t he?<br />
<br />
No, obviously not.<br />
<br />
He needed to do some better investigation now that he thought about it. He looked over at Chad. In these few days it seemed nothing went on with Chad aside from the usual. Yes, it was something he was going to need to look into. He didn&#39;t exactly mind what was happening with him if anything. He enjoyed it for what it was so far. If he was changing, he was changing into a better shape. A better form. A healthier form that didn&#39;t wrack him with pain and kept him in bed at early hours. He could run, lift and pump his muscles...!<br />
<br />
And he could fuck again. Alex grinned at the image of Chad in the showers. At his phone. He could engage with women and men both, in ways he was never passionate enough for in his younger years. Even as he thought about looking into what happened, he only considered his own occurrences a blessing.<br />
<br />
As Chad cleaned himself out in the showers, stretching as he did so, Alex went ahead and walked out from the showers and toward the mirror at the front of the locker room.</p>
