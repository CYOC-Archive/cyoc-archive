<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Amanda watched as Benton pulled into the garage; with their daughter sitting in the passenger seat of the car. Despite the two running off leaving her to clean up the mess in the kitchen; Amanda was happy to see her daughter laughing as she gets out of the car. Benton however was his usual stoic self when having to do an outing.<br />
“Well it couldn’t be all that bad Benton,” Amanda looking at her husband; “you didn’t get your nails painted.”<br />
“Don’t you start,” Benton opening up his Lamborghini’s boot; “Frieda tried to get me to go to a spa and it didn&#39;t take. I don’t need you piling on me.”<br />
“So what did you two get up to while I was busy cleaning up your mess,” Amanda watching Benton pull out bags from Awareness and a few bags without any identifying label on it.”<br />
<br />
“Dad has a new wardrobe to model for you mom,” Frieda giggling; “this way he doesn’t ruin his suits sitting on the riding mower.”<br />
“Any shorts,” Amanda looking at the clothes.<br />
“No,” Benton quickly answering; “you’ll never catch me wearing those.”<br />
“Dad doesn’t want people to see his knobby knees,” Frieda giggling again.<br />
“I don’t have knobby knees,” Benton grousing while Amanda was laughing; “oh yuck it up why don’t you.”<br />
“I will,” Amanda helping to bring some of the bags in.<br />
“We had lunch,” continuing the days events; “speaking of that, don’t forget your burger dad.”<br />
“You didn’t eat,” Amanda looking at Benton.<br />
“We’ll talk about that later,” Benton answering; “right now let’s get this stuff put away.”<br />
<br />
Amanda curious as to what they also did; opens up the bags that had no label on them. Seeing the various three dimensional puzzles, she looks at Benton who answers sheepishly that Frieda suggested he get a hobby. Pulling out the rocket kit that Frieda also grabbed from The Hobbyist; Amanda couldn’t help but stare at Benton.<br />
“Frieda insisted I get that,” Benton answering; “I can’t deny that it would be interesting to try out.”<br />
“Let me guess,” Amanda looking at her husband; “today?”<br />
“That or later this week,” Benton answering; “but I do know that Frieda is going to be helping me with these puzzles.”<br />
“I bet our daughter wants to join her friends right now,” Amanda looking at Frieda; “I’ve been following your posts on social media all day.”<br />
“So you’ve seen the photos Spencer posted of Evan Jr,” Frieda smiling; “isn’t he adorable?”<br />
“Yes,” Amanda answering; “yet what is this post of you saying we are getting a dog?”<br />
<br />
Benton choked on his cold cheeseburger as he was finally hungry enough to eat it; glaring at his daughter as he said they would talk about it when they got home.<br />
“Surprise,” Frieda answering sheepishly.<br />
“I said we would talk about when we got home,” Benton looking at his daughter; “talk. Not go and get one right away.&quot;<br />
“It’s got to be a Doberman or a Great Dane,” Amanda looking at her phone; “as long as it’s a big dog and a pure breed.”<br />
<br />
Benton and Frieda look at Amanda as she just stares back at them.<br />
“My parents have Dobermans guarding and patrolling their estate,” Amanda looking back at her shocked husband and daughter; “and I was involved in the kennel club when I was younger. Heading to dog shows and watching the judges award the best in show.”<br />
“Great,” Benton answering slowly; “anything else you want to share? A secret dream you’ve always wanted fulfilled?”<br />
“None I want to share in front of our daughter,” Amanda winks; “besides, after last night, I’m surprised you aren’t jumping at the chance to get some guard dogs roaming around the place.”<br />
“Because pets and weres,” Benton responding; “tend not to get along to well.”<br />
“And I said,” Frieda responding; “get them when they are still puppies. That way they get used to your scent.”<br />
“Frieda is not wrong there,” Amanda responding; “plus running around with a large dog can be great exercise.”<br />
“Well so much for you being on my side for this,” Benton grumbling; “did you put our daughter up to this?”<br />
“Mom doesn’t need to do that,” Frieda chiming in; “and I thought with you two not wanting a second child, a dog would be a great companion.”<br />
<br />
Amanda and Benton go silent as they finally grasp the real reason as to why Frieda wanted a dog; the desire to argue and bicker taken out of them as they stare at Frieda.<br />
“Frieda,” Benton being the first to speak; “you know why your mother and I are not planning on having a second child.”<br />
“Your three reasons,” Frieda huffing; “Bi-polar, neglect and your laughable fear of change.”<br />
“The first two reasons are valid,” Amanda answering; “your father’s fear of change; yeah I agree that is laughable.”<br />
“It not a fear,” Benton sighing; “you both know it’s hard for me to change. The daily struggle for me to accept this condition I have, having to take pills and see a therapist weekly.”<br />
“You didn’t have that problem with change when you and I were at awareness,” Frieda rebutting; “you have a whole new wardrobe of more casual clothes to wear.”<br />
“That’s different,” Benton trying to speak but gets cut off as Frieda leaves the kitchen and storms upstairs.<br />
<br />
Hearing the door to her room slam shut, Amanda stares at Benton before shaking her head.<br />
“I’ll go talk to her,” Amanda sighing; “but you know you’re getting a dog in the end.”<br />
“Must I,” Benton wanting to end the conversation; “it’s a huge responsibility.”<br />
“What is cheaper,” Amanda leaving the kitchen; “a security staff patrolling the grounds or a couple of dogs?”<br />
“Dam you,” Benton swearing.<br />
<br />
Amanda heads upstairs to Frieda’s room. Opening the door as she knocks; Amanda shudders as she sees Frieda on her bed with her pet snake out of its terrarium and slithering around in her lap.<br />
“Can you please put the slimy creature back in its glass enclosure,” Amanda looking spooked.<br />
“Snakes are not slimy,” Frieda holding onto her rat snake; “and Ralph here will not harm you.”<br />
“Put the creepy thing back in its container,” Amanda almost screaming.<br />
“Fine,” Frieda getting up; “why you are afraid of snakes, when they are more afraid of you?”<br />
“I refuse to get into that with you,” Amanda sitting on Frieda’s bed; “now come here so we can talk.”<br />
“About what,” Frieda sighing; “dad doesn’t want to talk. He just wants to circle back to his excuses.”<br />
“That is not fair to say,” Amanda looking at her daughter; “your father has fought to be a better person to you. To your friends and to the town,” Amanda speaking; “to say he has refused to change is wrong.”<br />
“Then why won’t you have another baby,” Frieda looking at her mother.<br />
“Please don’t bring this up,” Amanda sighing; “you know why. We are afraid our second child could be Bi-polar like your father.”<br />
“Dad said it better at The Diner,” Frieda grumbles; “so why is he refusing to get a dog?”<br />
“That’s just Benton being stubborn,” Amanda answering; “he is his usual pigheaded churlish self. Give him time,” Amanda smiling; “he’ll come around.”<br />
<br />
“I’m surprised you are so eager for a dog,” Frieda looking at her mother; “why?”<br />
“I used to breed pure bred Doberman’s with my mother,” Amanda grinning; “we would enter them into the various kennel club competitions all over America. I preferred it over Equestrian dad tried to push me into,” Amanda chuckling; “you can’t play fetch with a horse like you can with a large dog.”<br />
“Then why don’t we just bypass dad and go to the shelter and get one,” Frieda look at her mother; “then he’ll have no choice but to accept it.”<br />
“I like you’re thinking,” Amanda smiling; “but we’ll have to wait a while. Right now your dad needs some space,” Amanda getting up; “having his wife side with his daughter was not something he expected.”<br />
“Then I guess Father Daughter day is over then,” Frieda also getting up; “do you want to drop me off at Spencer’s or should I call her to come and pick me up?”</p>
