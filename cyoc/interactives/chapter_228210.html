<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Emily was only too happy to accompany this new version of Rick as she visited several upmarket boutiques to look for the perfect dress for whatever her special occasion was. This woman was unmistakably Rick, she shared Rick&#39;s eyes and colouring though in a feminine version. This &quot;Rebecca&quot; version of Rick was what Rick would have been had he been born with two X chromosomes, was about 20 years older and fit. She even possessed some of Rick&#39;s mannerisms such as the way she walked and cracking her knuckles, something that annoyed Emily when Rick did it, but amused her when Rebecca did it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Rebecca&quot; even paused her dress shopping to enter a gaming store and put her name down for a new video game that was to be released next week, a game Rick had indicated he was going to book. &quot;Rebecca&quot; didn&#39;t look like your typical gamer, but appeared to have kept Rick&#39;s obsession with gaming and competitiveness. She even asked Emily if she would like a new game for herself. Emily took the opportunity.<br />
<br />
As for looking for dresses, &quot;Rebecca&quot; visited two designer shops and asked to see one off creations. At the second shop, Emily only had to do a little prompting to get &quot;Rebecca&quot; to try on, firstly a pink floral off the shoulder gown, then a gold and white brocade silk maxi dress. This version of Rick looked absolutely gorgeous in both. &quot;Rebecca&quot; asked Emily&#39;s opinion, as she modelled both gowns, as if she was on a runway. Emily voted for the gold dress and &quot;Rebecca&quot; had no hesitation buying it, despite the price tag being over $500. Rebecca admitted to her as they left the shop, &#39;I won&#39;t even have to buy new shoes. My Jimmy Choo&#39;s will be perfect&#39;<br />
<br />
Rebecca led the way to the car park where she unlocked a metallic red sports car. Emily&#39;s eyes popped out of her head. In this reality &quot;Rebecca&quot; was loaded. Emily eagerly climbed into the passenger seat as her mother then drove her to soccer training. The car was fully electric and Emily read the brand &quot;MG Cyberster&quot;<br />
<br />
Soccer training was, like she remembered soccer training used to be like, when she had previously played the game. There were drills and lots of fitness stuff. Emily was not familiar with any of the girls she was training with, but they all knew her as &quot;Em&quot;. By the end of training she knew the names of most of the girls. Unfortunately Emily wasn&#39;t any more talented in this version of reality than she had been in her previous reality and could not keep up with the other girls. It reminded Emily why she had quit the game after two seasons. <br />
<br />
Emily had observed that &quot;Rebecca&quot; had driven off once training started and was slightly worried that she would be abandoned. But the red car returned after an hour and Rebecca was waiting for her when training was finished. Rebecca was there to console Emily when the team was announced and her name was absent. <br />
<br />
Emily didn&#39;t really care about not making the team, she was more excited to see where she lived in this new version of reality. Rebecca was not driving towards either Emily&#39;s old house or Rick&#39;s, instead she drove in the opposite direction towards the flashiest suburb of the city. She wasn&#39;t disappointed. Rebecca drove up to some ornate gates to a property surrounded by a tall hedge. The gates opened when Rebecca pushed a button and they entered a long driveway. The property had to be of several acres and there was a small cottage nearer the road which Rebecca bypassed to arrive at a regal French chateau styled mansion. They parked out the front beside a yellow Lamborghini. Wow!<br />
<br />
Emily followed Rebecca inside and was greeted by her father. Her actual father. It appeared he was still her father in this reality. The only difference was that he was wearing an expensive suit and instead of being a loans officer at the bank, he now apparently owned it. Emily was greeted exactly as her father used to greet her, with a brief cuddle and &#39;How is my little duckling toady?&#39; She was a little put off though when her father greeted Rick (now Rebecca) with a cuddle and a passionate kiss. It seemed the price of being super wealthy was that her boyfriend was now her father&#39;s wife. &#39;I believe dinner is ready. So we shouldn&#39;t keep the staff waiting. You can both tell me of your days as we eat&#39;<br />
<br />
Emily followed her father and the feminine version of Rick into an ornate dining room. There was a table laid out for three. She took the seat at the side of the table after her apparent parents took the seats at either end.<br />
<br />
Once seated, a maid in a black uniform with a white apron brought in some steaming hot meals. Emily did a double take a she recognised the woman. It was her mother!</p>
