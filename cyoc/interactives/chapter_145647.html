<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Optimal utilization of subject resources has been achieved. Permanence matrix warming up...&quot;<br />
<br />
Hearing this, Ruse went impossibly wide-eyed. Permanence? No, no, no, she couldn&#39;t be stuck like this permanently! She moved every muscle that she still had control over as violently as she could... but there were so few of them left that she could barely manage to wobble very slightly, far too weakly to even have a chance of knocking herself over, let alone anything else. &quot;It&#39;s hopeless...&quot; She soon conceded to herself, eyes beginning to water.<br />
<br />
The mild nausea returned again, and again she felt the sandwiches travel to each end of her body and forcefully pop out, sending bits of peanut butter flying through the air. &quot;This is all that I&#39;m going to be able to do...&quot; She thought, as she noticed a machine tentacle gently scoop up the sandwich in front of her and carry it away to some unknown destination. &quot;For the rest of my life?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Permanence matrix at 30%...&quot;<br />
<br />
Another sense of welling up in her core, but this time without the accompanying sick feeling. In fact, as the sandwiches traveled their path, she thought to herself: &quot;It&#39;s starting to feel kind of good...&quot; As they lightly exploded from each end, it felt immensely satisfying. She tried to place the feeling. It felt a lot like... well, a lot like relieving yourself after holding it in for an uncomfortably long time, which she  realized was disturbingly and depressingly close to what she was actually being forced to do here. &quot;Oh god, it&#39;s messing with my brain!&quot; She mentally cried in anguish, and the tears began to roll down her cheeks.<br />
<br />
Strangely, she noticed that she could feel her tears being absorbed into the breading around what used to be her mouth. &quot;Is this bread really... part of me now?&quot; As she felt her bread getting soggy, she continued to despair. It was a feeling unlike any human feeling, having liquid literally soaking into your... body?  She couldn&#39;t even finish the thought without a panic overcoming her. &quot;This is my fucking body! I&#39;m made of bread and peanut butter and jelly!&quot; Desperately, she tried to feel her legs, her hips, her torso, her arms, but she couldn&#39;t. All she could feel was a big blob of bread, covered in crust, with two holes on either end, messy with peanut butter. <br />
<br />
To punctuate that thought, her body made another pair of sandwiches, feeling this time almost like a massage as they traveled outward. &quot;Massaging... my bread?&quot; But before she could think more on that, they reached her holes, and this time as they ejected themselves from her, it felt even better than before. &quot;Almost sexual...&quot; She considered, relaxing slightly from the feeling. &quot;Fuck. Fuck!&quot; She quickly rebounded back to panic. &quot;I&#39;m not going to start enjoying this! This is beyond humiliating! I&#39;m a human being, god damn it!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Permanence matrix at 55%...&quot;<br />
<br />
The announcement came at her thoughts like a hard slap. &quot;But what&#39;s even human about me anymore?&quot; She wanted to badly to move her neck to get one last look at herself, but the crust held her head firmly in place. Or maybe all those muscles had become bread, too? It was hard to tell anymore. She could still feel her breasts, even if they didn&#39;t feel all that different from her bready insides at this point. Looking down, she could still make them out, thanks mostly to their size. Their discoloration had become far more pronounced, being quite deep shades of purple and brown respectively now. &quot;Fuck, they really are huge...&quot; She observed, stunned by the fact for a moment. &quot;How haven&#39;t I fallen off balance with these things?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Permanence matrix at 80%...&quot;<br />
<br />
The pressure rose up within her again, this time moving through her with a building sensation of pleasure that was impossible to ignore. &quot;Oh god...&quot; Was all she could think, and as they erupted from each end with an accompanying torrent of peanut butter, she silently screamed in ecstasy. &quot;Oh god holy fuck. That&#39;s definitely sexual now. Fuck fuck fucking fuck. It&#39;s going to feel like that every time? I&#39;m going to go fucking insane!&quot;<br />
<br />
She felt a jolt as the bottom of her breasts made contact with the cold floor. &quot;Oh no...&quot; Her panic morphed into hopelessness again. &quot;Have I blobified that much? If somebody found me, would they even be able to tell I was ever human?&quot; She crossed her eyes, realizing in terror that at some point the crusty breading had crept up and smoothed away her nose. &quot;How long have I not been breathing? How have I not noticed? What&#39;s left of me?&quot; Her eyes darted around, searching the topmost part of her field of view. &quot;I still have hair, don&#39;t I?&quot; She begged to nobody. But as she attempted to furrow her brow, she realized that she couldn&#39;t. It, too, had been absorbed into the rest of her breaded self. <br />
<br />
&quot;Permanence matrix at 100%... Awaiting review of subject before final matrix sweep.&quot;<br />
<br />
Another double orgasm came as she birthed two more sandwiches. &quot;Is that it?&quot; She wondered as she recovered from the mental fogging effects of her sandwich making. &quot;Am I stuck like this... forever?&quot; <br />
<br />
Part of the counter directly in front of Ruse made some mechanical whirring sounds as it sunk into the floor, shortly thereafter being replaced by a computer terminal rising up from the same place. It was just an old-fashioned monitor and keyboard, and Ruse was brought back to her earlier pondering of how technology this old could accomplish such advanced feats. The screen flickered to life, and Ruse could only stare at it, awash in anguish. It was displaying a perfectly rendered, slowly rotating image of the... thing... that she had become.<br />
<br />
She was even more blob-like than she had previously assumed. &quot;What the fuck...&quot; She wanted to cry again, but her tear ducts, too, had been turned into bread. In fact, the only thing left of her face was her two eyes embedded into her crust above her breasts, vaguely where her head might have been before. She tried to blink, but her eyelids were gone, too. Thankfully, her eyes didn&#39;t seem to dry. She wasn&#39;t even sure they were actually eyeballs anymore. Some part of her was happy that, if nothing else, she had been allowed to keep her sight, but it was impossible to stay positive seeing what she had become. <br />
<br />
Just a gigantic blob of crusted bread, with two holes at either end completely slick with peanut butter, two slightly smaller but still quite large blobs -- one a deep brown and the other a deep purple -- protruding out the front through the crust, and a small, hardly noticeable pair of forward-oriented eyes looking out from near the top. &quot;When did my whole head sink into my body? How did I not notice it happening? Did this machine turn me into a fucking idiot, too?&quot; She would be sobbing deeply now, if she had the capacity. Instead she simply stared, stared at this nightmarish image, stared at this strange, unnatural creature, stared... at herself. &quot;Oh god...  Oh god! Why the hell did I take this job? Oh god! What have I done?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No authorized personnel located in vicinity. Sending request for dispatch of authorized personnel to vicinity. Awaiting review of subject before final matrix sweep.&quot;<br />
<br />
A glimmer of hope suddenly wiped away her dark thoughts. &quot;This isn&#39;t the end!&quot; She excitedly cheered to herself. &quot;It can&#39;t do anything else without a person! When they get here they&#39;ll see this terrible mistake and reverse everything! Thank god, everything&#39;s going to be okay!&quot;<br />
<br />
Her eyes rolled back as she was hit by another mindblowingly pleasurable and bizarre sandwich induced dual orgasm. &quot;Fuck, they better hurry up.&quot; She complained as she recovered from the orgasmic daze.  &quot;Or I might go braindead from too much of this.&quot;</p>
