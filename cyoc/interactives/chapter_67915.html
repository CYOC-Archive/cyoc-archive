<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As soon as the text stopped glowing I was blinded by a flash of bright light. When I opened my eyes again I saw my room exactly as it was before. Well, that wasn't a surprise as the description of my new reality didn't affect anything in my room. So to see the effects my wishes had on the world I had to get some girl here.<br />
<br />
&quot;My sister likes to visit my room frequently and she's about to do this right now.&quot; I've written in the book. The sentence started glowing again and as soon as it finished I heard a knock on my door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Josh! Can I come in?&quot; I heard my sister's voice from behind the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, sure come in!&quot;<br />
<br />
The door opened and my sister Alice entered the room. She didn't look any different from her usual 16-year old self and the only thing that could indicate that the book worked at all was what she was wearing. She wore an obviously too big T-shirt and yet I could clearly see her two nipples poking through the fabric of the shirt. &quot;Right, no more bras...&quot; I remembered. I couldn't see the outline of the breasts themselves but what I saw was enough for me to feel my dick getting harder. As she took a step in the points on her shirt started dancing around as if they were pinned to my sister's chest with a set of springs and not with warm female flesh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Josh! I didn't have anything to do and I thought I may drop in. Are you doing anything interesting right now?&quot;<br />
<br />
She approached my bed and clearly wanted to jump on it. What she did before jumping was intriguing - she pressed her forearm to her chest trying to hold her breasts and then she jumped. Apparently now even such a simple thing as jumping on a bed could cause too much movement a girl would want to experience. So far so good...<br />
She laid down on her back, her torso supported on her elbows. Her breasts visibly flattened although the two dancing points on her black T-shirt remained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sooo...&quot; I started trying to hide a growing bulge in my pants &quot;How are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd say fine but today my boobs are really annoying. I was almost late for my bus and I had to run. You men can't even imagine how bad it can be. Or maybe you Josh can. Well, two years of me complaining after my Breastgiving definitely helps...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Breastgiving? What is that?&quot; I asked confused<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, the day I grew breasts. Everyone knows what it is!&quot;<br />
<br />
Well I didn't. I didn't have the memories from the altered reality. I quickly turned to the book and scribbled that Alice would tell me everything she knows about the day of Breastgiving and not think there's anything weird with her explaining such a basic thing to me.<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean...&quot; she started influenced by my writing &quot;You know it's coming when your feet start to feel funny. Remember this one evening 2 years ago? We were both almost 14. I was at this student exchange in Europe. I called you saying that I can't make myself to wear my slippers so it must be close. Nobody knows where the compulsion to walk barefoot comes from but well, that's the only warning one gets.<br />
The growing started when I was having my breakfast. It was Saturday, I remember. By 10 o'clock I already had my own set of boobs. The next day I already served my host family cornflakes with my own milk... I felt proud and adult but also I finally understood what mom meant when she said I'll be looking back to my breast-less times with a smile on my face.<br />
God, they were uncomfortable... They still are, but the first couple of weeks is the worst. Firstly you've got to wait like a week for your feet to go back to normal, until you can't think about wearing even socks. But that's a minor thing. The worst part is how your skin reacts. When the growth takes place the skin within 3 inches from one's nipples becomes slightly more elastic so it can stretch as one's breasts grow. It's not particularly pleasant, I admit, but the real problem is the normal not-so-elastic skin. It needs more time to adapt to the newly introduced part of the anatomy and until it does a girl has to deal with her breasts tugging the skin around her neck, on her back and shoulders whenever she, *they*, move.<br />
At least I was lucky enough to have my Breastgiving at a pretty standard age ending up with an average size. You know Fran Jakes? Her Breastgiving happened just six months after mine and her breasts are almost twice my size. Some girls have it even later... I mean my cousin is 18 and she still hasn't had hers. Now she can't find any job cause every employer knows that she'll be pretty much immobilized after she eventually gets her Breastgiving.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah... That's interesting...&quot; I was genuinely impressed by the amount of detail each book-induced reality shift caused. Even in someone's memories...<br />
<br />
<br />
I looked down at my crotch. The bulge was starting to get more visible. I needed to do something with that. I couldn't let my sister see me getting aroused at the sight of her breasts!<br />
<br />
&quot;If you excuse me for a moment.&quot; I said &quot;I need to use the bathroom.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
I left my room trying to hide my crotch and entered the bathroom. Mind you, I didn't want to jerk it off - I just wanted to calm down.<br />
<br />
I splashed some cold water on my face and looked in the mirror.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's getting quite interesting...&quot; I told my reflection and went back.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
When I entered my room I froze in one place, panic making me unable to move from the spot I was standing on.<br />
<br />
My sister was at the desk, writing something in The Book.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you think this is funny?&quot; she asked clearly appalled &quot;To write some sick story about women breasts just like if the way they are was your own idea? That's disgusting...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha.. What did you write in there?&quot; I managed to stutter<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh not much compared to your &quot;works&quot;... Just a &quot;happy ending&quot;, a one that would teach you some empathy if it was to become true...&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit!&quot; I jumped forward to the desk and looked at what was written in the book. Below my scribbles there was Alice's straight handwriting.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;For the next week&quot; it said &quot;my brother Josh is going to be transported to the body of a petite 17-year-old girl named Annie. Annie is spending her summer holidays somewhere nice and warm with her dominant boyfriend Mark. It happens that the first day of their stay in a new hotel is Annie's Breastgiving.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Quickly! Erase that!&quot; I yelled but it was too late. The words my sister's written down already started glowing and after a couple of seconds I was blinded by a bright flash...</p>
