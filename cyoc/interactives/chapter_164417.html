<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tucker considered. He wanted to go back to the store, but.. eh.. it&#39;s not like he had to work today. He could shave get to the store and get back. And if his hair was growing a little fast the only person he&#39;d be around long enough to notice is the store clerk, who wouldn&#39;t care. After all, he didn&#39;t need to do another head to toe, he&#39;d do that tonight, he could just focus on places where he wanted more.<br />
<br />
Lathering up, it took him about twenty minutes to make sure he got the spots he wanted. The new beard growth went first, followed by his chest and stomach. Underarms went next. Tucker had always had a thing for guys with hairy pits, it was just so.. raw and masculine and he wanted to be that guy. He left his arms and legs alone, and didn&#39;t feel like doing the careful work around his cock right now, but trimmed it down a little at the edges.<br />
<br />
Getting dressed, he grabbed a cereal bar out of his kitchen to eat on the way to the store. He hoped they were open. There were a lot more people out shopping than there were the previous evening, but when Tucker stepped into the store it was completely empty other than the same clerk who was restocking one of the shelves.<br />
<br />
&quot;Always this quiet in here?&quot; Tucker quipped with a smile as he walked in.<br />
<br />
&quot;We have a one customer at a time policy so we can focus on their needs.&quot; The clerk flashed that winning smile at Tucker again. This time he checked the name tag. Locke. &quot;So, how did it work?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like magic.&quot; Tucker responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not like. It is magic.&quot; Locke smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? You mean..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, there certainly aren&#39;t medicines that can do that. Just.. accept it. It&#39;s easier that way.&quot; You nod at the advice. Locke came closer and leaned in to get a look.  &quot;Oh! You shaved again already, I can see some stubble. We should probably get you some razor refills. The more hair you have the quicker those things dull and stop working.&quot; He looked up.&quot;Eyebrows, too, huh. Some people are afraid they&#39;ll get uni-brow.&quot; He laughs. Walking over to one of the shelves he picks up a few more razors, which he placed on the counter.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was thinking of a few other things.. I want to be bigger.&quot; Tucker stood at a rather unimposing 5&#39;3&quot; and weighed maybe 110 if he poot on heavy boots.<br />
<br />
&quot;That leaves a lot of room for interpretation. Do you want to be fatter? A bodybuilder? Taller?&quot; Locke looked like he was going to keep going.<br />
<br />
&quot;No.. no.. yes!&quot; Tucker chimed in. &quot;Taller. Though body builder...? Um, maybe just start with more muscular?&quot; Tucker looked around at the products.<br />
<br />
&quot;Some more things with gradual effects then? That way you can use them till you&#39;re happy?&quot; Locke started moving between the shelves and finally stopped in front of a bunch of tubs of what looked like protein powders. &quot;What body fat percentage do you want to aim for?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tucker stared blankly, he was no fitness guru, or a health expert. &quot;I um.. dunno. I want to be muscular, but I don&#39;t need to be shredded.. Just.. manlier..&quot;<br />
<br />
Locke smiled as he looked over at Tucker. &quot;Let&#39;s go for fourteen then.. Very fit, but not quite professional athlete. We can always adjust later.&quot; He takes a tub off the shelf. &quot;Half a teaspoon dissolved in water will become one pound of bulk at the right muscle fat ratios.&quot; He patted the side of the tub. &quot;Now height...&quot; He started wandering off and Tucker trailed after him again. &quot;Do you have a...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Six three.&quot; Tucker blurted out before Locke even finished his question, which produced a laugh as he moved behind the counter to the supplements that they had back there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, we can be more direct there then.&quot; He eyed Tucker up and down. &quot;Eleven inches then.&quot; He guessed with surprising accuracy. He opened a jar that was filled with little capsules that looked like pills. Pulling a bottle out from under the counter, he used a small pair of tongs and counted eleven into the bottle, putting the cap on.<br />
<br />
&quot;I recommend taking the height capsules first. It&#39;ll grow you taller keeping your current body shape. You&#39;ll probably put on somewhere between forty and fifty pounds that way. Then do the muscle growth till you&#39;re happy. You&#39;re skinny, so we don&#39;t need to slim you down first.&quot; Locke held up a finger. &quot;Now, I&#39;m going to be honest with you. This is a lot more powerful than the razor, and it&#39;s more expensive to match.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tucker felt his chest fall a little. &quot;How much..?&quot; He hoped he kept the disappointment out of his voice. But rent in this city wasn&#39;t cheap.<br />
<br />
Locke tapped on the register. &quot;Five hundred.&quot; Tucker must have paled because Tucker looked sympathetic.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell you what. We&#39;re working on a new line of products and we need people to test them out. If you take it and use it tonight, I&#39;ll knock half off. You just have to come back tomorrow so we can check you over to make sure it worked as intended and there were no.. strange side effects. We&#39;ll fix anything that goes wrong at no cost.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do I have to hold off on..&quot; Tucker motioned at his purchase.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope. You can use this tonight, too. We&#39;ll know what&#39;s caused by what. The magic has unique signatures.&quot; Locke smiled as he reached under the counter, pulling out a foot long wooden box and placing it with the rest of Tucker&#39;s items.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine. I&#39;ll do it. But.. I do have one question. Aren&#39;t people going to notice I changed? I mean, I want this, but I can&#39;t show up to work on Monday a different person.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No worries there. All our transformations are mixed with a bit of enchantment magic. People will notice you&#39;re different, but they&#39;ll accept it as normal change, no worse than if you got a new haircut or started hitting the gym.&quot; Locke turned the credit card reader towards Tucker. &quot;That&#39;ll be two hundred and fifty. No sales tax on magic. If you don&#39;t come back tomorrow, we&#39;ll charge you another five hundred, the discount plus the cost of the test item.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tucker fed the machine his card. He winced, but if this worked like the razor, it&#39;d be worth it. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll be back. This might be my new favorite store.&quot;<br />
<br />
Locke bagged up all his stuff. &quot;Now, don&#39;t look in that box till you get home. I even put it at the bottom to reduce temptation. So.. anything else I can help you with?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tucker didn&#39;t know what prompted it, but blurted out, &quot;Your number?&quot;<br />
<br />
Locke smiled, and it wasn&#39;t mocking but he shook his head. &quot;No can do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can&#39;t go out for drinks with a customer?&quot; Tucker asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I can. You&#39;re just not my type, sorry. But maybe..&quot; He looked at the bag. &quot;Maybe one day.&quot; Then smirked. &quot;Have a good day. I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll be exciting.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tucker waved and headed out of the store and back to his apartment. Running his hand over his jaw he felt the stubble from this morning&#39;s shave already coming in, there was some on his cheeks now. He resisted the urge to look down his shirt with all these people around though, and just jogged back to the apartment.</p>
