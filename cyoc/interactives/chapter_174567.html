<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ellie crossed her arms and pouted while The WIzZARd adjusted his robes. &quot;So where is your boss? You&#39;d better not be stalling me. There&#39;s no way this thing of yours where you can be contracted to transform me without even asking...&quot;<br />
<br />
The WIzZARD had parted his robes just enough to withdraw his penis. Ellie looked on, one eye twitching.<br />
<br />
&quot;You wanted to meet my manager. Well? Here he is.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ellie walked towards The WIzZARD. &quot;But that... that&#39;s a penis.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. It&#39;s often said of men that they are thinking with their dick. Well, here is mine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well uh...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well? What is it young lady. I haven&#39;t got all day.&quot; The WIzZARD spoke in a funny, high pitched voice like a cartoon character. Ellie looked flabberglasted, but he gently put his hand on her head and pushed her to her knees. As he did, he brushed the side of her head with his other hand, drawing out a small magical doll from inside her head. &quot;Well hello there Mr Dick - &quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Donahue. You can call me Donahue.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me, Mr Dona- &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just Donahue&quot;. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry. Donahue,&quot; she took a deep breath. The WIzZARD had stolen Ellie&#39;s self-awareness, so though she thought this was a bit odd she supposed it made perfect since that of course a sentient penis would be running things. &quot;I want to lodge a complaint against your wizard.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; The WIzZARD leaned back so that she could no longer see his face. It was just her and his penis now, though he kept speaking in his funny voice and using ventriloquism to throw his voice to make it sound like it was speaking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that sounds important. Why don&#39;t you come with me into my office so we can discuss things properly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh... okay..&quot; Ellie looked around, still not seeing any exists to the room, except through the window.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll lead the way. Take a hand?&quot; the penis suddenly stood at attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;O.. Of course,&quot; Ellie reached out, and took a hold of the very tip of The WIzZARD&#39;s penis with her thumb and forefinger. The WIzZARD then slowly shuffled to a corner of the room, next to the window, while Ellie followed along on her knees.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here we are.&quot; Donahue tried to talk, but was still held in place by her thumb and forefinger. &quot;Ah.. would you mind letting go?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! How incosiderate of me,&quot; Ellie blushed, and immediately let go.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, that is much better.&quot; The WIzZARD projected. &quot;Now, why don&#39;t you tell me what this is about?&quot; his penis bobbed up and down as he made it talk.<br />
<br />
Ellie squirmed. She couldn&#39;t feel that this was a really.. inappropriate meeting in here alone with a penis. But she didn&#39;t know what else to do, so explained her story.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your wizard has treated me poorly! He&#39;s made it out that I am to be transformed into a woman despite my protests that I want no such thing!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? Aren&#39;t you already a woman?&quot; The penis made a kind of circular motion in her direction. Ellie looked confused, looking down at herself, but without her self awareness, couldn&#39;t make the distinction. &quot;Well.. no.. I mean.. I assume there will be further changes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, of course. Sorry to interrupt, please go on.&quot;<br />
<br />
So Ellie made her case that she should not be transformed against her wishes, that it was completely unjust for a contract to be made regarding her over which she had no part, and that the WIzZARD in general was an uncivilized, insulting creature whom Donahue should be rid of forthwith. Donahue, for his part, made affirming noises in all the right places, shaking from side to side in displeasure, and soon Ellie was won over by the speaking, thinking dick, so that she was feeling a bit warm and nervous just looking at him eye to eye.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re right, you&#39;re absolutely right. I&#39;ll speak with him right away and convince him to give up this contract at once. Perhaps, he can show he can learn from his mistakes, but I doubt it. I will certainly have to let him go.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OH, thank you,&quot; Ellie sputtered in gratitude. &quot;I knew you would be reasonable and see things my way. So you&#39;ll handle it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Donahue bobbed. &quot;I&#39;ll take care of it from here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you!&quot; She gushed, and then overcoming her hesitation, kissed Donahue just on the tip. When Donahue said nothing, in fact froze still, she became suddenly worried.<br />
<br />
&quot;My apologizes Donahue.. I&#39;ve overstepped myself. That was.. unprofessional of me..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not at all, Not at all&quot; The WIzZARD, that is, Donahue cleared his throat. &quot;I was simply overcome by such a beautiful young woman as yourself.. obviously, you would be grateful, I just, had similar feelings, but I was not sure how to approach..&quot;<br />
<br />
Ellie swayed towards Donahue, and The WIzZARD took a step closer together, and then suddenly they flew at each other, pressing up against one another in passionate embrace. Ellie ended up in control, first catching him in her mouth at the base, and then kissing her way up the top. But once Donahue was placed in her mouth, The WIzZARD sighed in relief as he could simply thrust back and forth and put his focus on finishing his spell upon Ellie&#39;s new self awareness.<br />
<br />
His main concern was that she was quite wild in her pursuit for what she deserved.. quite carelessly so. While it was good to know his children would have a fierce champion and defender, her demanding nature could also bring harm to them all. It was important that she never use her confidence to hurt her children, but always being aware of when she was doing it, so she could be sure to use it expressly for their benefit. So he enhanced her self-awareness to be prepared in that regard. Also, he removed from her any inkling of masculinity or desire for men or penis; she would be hopelessly devoted to her lesbian lover, just as had been ordered. But for now, her obliviousness and omnivorous lust suited him, and would in fact entertain when he was to claim his payment. So he placed a final enchantment upon the whole thing, such that her self awareness would integrate with her personality just as he was ready to impregnate her.<br />
<br />
He finished about when Ellie was done sucking and back to passionately kissing. The virginal protection charm he had on her prevented her from feeling any real pleasure, and so this whole time she achieved little more than breathless edging. But it was time to bring this to a close... The WIzZARD stepped back, Donahue slipping from her mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alas, my dear, I fear I must return to my duties.. and you, must return to your soon to be wife.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah.. you are right. I should not tempt myself so. I must remain true to my dear Daisy. But at least, we will be rid of that horrible wizard.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alas,&quot; Donahue said, &quot;though I may instruct The WIzZARD in the performance of his duties, I cannot make demands of his personal life. And so, though I shall enact my discipline at once, I fear you will be seeing him again soon, because of his arrangement with your roommate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure Daisy..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not Daisy,&quot; Donahue shook from side to side. &quot;The other one. Lucy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lucy?&quot; Ellie looked confused. &quot;Who is she?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lucy.. you know, your roommate. Who is always with you. She and The WIzZARD have been seeing each other, and I&#39;m afraid... she&#39;s a bit of a slut.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see.. but what does that have to do with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your roommate Lucy, who you can never seem to get away from. You know what the boys call her... Loosie Lucy... Juicy Loosie.. She always wears that scandalous perfume and is constantly teasing all the boys..&quot; Donahue pointed downward knowingly, pointing between her legs.<br />
<br />
Ellie squirmed, looking around, and then felt the wetness between her legs, and her eyes opened wide at the talking penis in front of her. &quot;Oh. OH.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed, in such a way as my relationship is with you, I&#39;m afraid Lucy&#39;s relationship with The WIzZARD is ... outside of my control. Unless you can convince her...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I certainly shall.&quot; said Ellie, a look of determination on her face. &quot;I&#39;ll have no friends of mine consorting with that... rapscallion.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... good luck then,&quot; Donahue bobbed hopefully. Ellie took her leave of the penis, standing to her knees. Once there, she noticed that The WIzZARD and her were in the same room again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wizard.&quot; She glared. The WIzZARD smiled back, slipping his penis (Donahue) back into his robes. &quot;I hope you had an enlightening conversation?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I did.&quot; She glared at him with victorious eyes. &quot;And I&#39;ll be glad to see you pay for what you&#39;ve done.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, no, what ever should I do,&quot; The WIzZARD deadpanned in mock terror, to Ellie&#39;s obliviousness. <br />
<br />
&quot;Take care of yourself, I hope you have good luck at your next posision, once Donahue is done with you.&quot; She smiled at him with a predatory grin, then grabbed her purse and walked out the door.<br />
<br />
The WIzZARD caught his breath, and reached under his robe to provide his penis with some temporary relief. &quot;Well, that was something...&quot; Dealing with prospective mothers was always a tricky business, but it was always worth it. And he was truly looking forward to his rendezvous with Lucy.</p>
