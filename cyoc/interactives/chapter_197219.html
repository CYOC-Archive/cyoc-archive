<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Knowing that her minions could sometimes be...overzealous, especially when left without her direction, Gemory made her way to her palace, calling her steed to her.  Al Shamlal had been given to her by the King of Hell, Paimon, who rode a similar steed.  It had been Paimon who had taught her how to look beyond the veil of time, though, naturally, he was better at it than she was.<br />
<br />
Al Shamlal, being a demon camel (an old joke in Hell being “how can you tell the difference between a demon camel and a regular one?”; the answer being “is it being ridden by Paimon or Gemory?”) could move very swiftly, and she reached her demense in no time.  She was met by Belzazel, her Captain of the Guard.<br />
<br />
Belzazel was a tall muscular woman with immense breasts, that even hir demonic body required a special harness to support and keep out of hir way.  Kept barely restrained by hir codpiece was an equally massive penis, which grew out of hir vagina.  Belzazel was rather happily a functional hermaphrodite, and one of her oldest and most loyal servants.<br />
<br />
Despite being a little top heavy, s/he had a pair of massive wings that served as a counterbalance, and was as graceful as a dancer, even at hir size.  Gemory was used to looking up at her Captain, but at her current height, she found herself starting at Belzazel&#39;s codpiece.<br />
<br />
She could change her own size, of course, but instead, as she slid from her saddle, she bid her servant to transform.  Though not a natural shapechanger like most Succubi (Toni being an exception, as her form was meant to be a harsh reminder about making deals with Devils), Gemory had gifted Belzazel with more than one form.<br />
<br />
Belzazel shrank down to a pretty girl of average height, with relatively normal anatomy and musculature, her battle harness and codpiece simply falling off her smaller frame.  A pair of Imps quickly grabbed them as Belzazel followed her Duke into the castle.<br />
<br />
Bel was still taller than she was, but Gemory decided there was no need to press the point further.  <br />
<br />
“Status report, Bel?”<br />
<br />
“My Lord.  When you didn&#39;t return on schedule, we became worried.  While you can, of course, take care of yourself, and there was a chance you had begun a long-term venture, I decided that with a small chance you were in danger, that I should err on the side of overweening zeal.”<br />
<br />
“Oh no, what did you do, Bel?”  Gemory had a sinking feeling in her stomach.<br />
<br />
“I gave Toni approval to return to Earth, as she need not be summoned to find out what you were doing and report back, Lord.”<br />
<br />
“Oh Bel...well, I can&#39;t blame your reasoning.  I&#39;ll have to hunt her down and make sure she isn&#39;t getting into trouble.  She&#39;s only been a Succubus for ten years, that&#39;s barely more than an infant by our standards.”<br />
<br />
“If that.”  Bel grinned.<br />
<br />
Gemory gave her Captain a stern look, but she couldn&#39;t maintain it.  It was hard to be angry with someone who had been at her side for so long.  “Look, Bel, I hate to admit this, but I may be in over my head on this one.  I let my guard down with a mortal girl.”<br />
<br />
“I can have her head on a pike within the hour, My Lord.”  Belzazel replied.<br />
<br />
“In the name of Lucifer, don&#39;t do that!”  Gemory&#39;s eyes widened in...fear?<br />
<br />
Belzazel didn&#39;t remember the last time Gemory had shown fear.  “My Lord?”<br />
<br />
“She is to be protected as if she were my own personage.  Maybe more, since she&#39;s only mortal.”  Gemory fretted as she made her way through her harem.  “Not now, my lovelies, sorry.”  She waved off her succubi and incubi (though given their shapechanging powers, the difference was really moot), who looked disappointed, but that couldn&#39;t be helped.<br />
<br />
Would Danielle even want an open relationship?  Gemory wasn&#39;t sure she was equipped for monogamy!<br />
<br />
Making her way to her throne, Gemory sat down on it wearily.  Given her current size, she looked like a small child, her feet dangling off the floor.  “Ugh, why did I ever need such a big throne?”<br />
<br />
Bel kneeled at her Duke&#39;s feet.  “My Lord, what is going on?”<br />
<br />
“Alright, you deserve to know.  You are allowed to laugh at me- and if you want to quit after this, I won&#39;t blame you.”  She filled in Belzazel on recent events.<br />
<br />
To her surprise, Bel simply smiled.  “I&#39;m happy for you, My Lord.”<br />
<br />
“Eh?!” Gemory blinked.<br />
<br />
“Has it been so long that you forgot that I was once a mortal woman?  Weak and helpless, forever at the mercy of men, who could crush a woman&#39;s heart as easily as her body with their brute strength.  You gave me a body stronger than any man&#39;s, and trusted me to guard your body.  For that you have my eternal loyalty.  But for centuries, I have seen you grow ever more weary, flitting from one distraction to the next.  I realized that, despite all your servants, you were lonely.  For who could be the equal of Gemory?  Another demon would always try to dominate you, and anything less, you would play with until you became bored and banished them to your harem.<br />
<br />
You were created to love God.  But having turned from God, could you love anything else?  I have wrestled with this for some time.”  Bel gazed up at her Master.<br />
<br />
“Oh Bel...surely you realize what a disaster this is?  Demons can&#39;t love!  My rivals will see this as a weakness, and use her against me!  I may even be demoted!”  Gemory put her head in her hands and wept.<br />
<br />
Deciding that her love for her Master had to outweigh protocol, Belzazel sat on the throne (which had room for the both of them) and put her arms around Gemory, soothing her as best she could.<br />
<br />
Not accustomed to crying, Gemory found the tears burned her skin, and she forced herself to become calm.  But she didn&#39;t move for some time.  “Bel.  Do you love me?”<br />
<br />
“Of course I do.  No one treated me with as much care, on Earth or in Hell.”  Bel kissed her Lord&#39;s hair.<br />
<br />
“That makes me feel worse.  I&#39;ve never acknowledged your feelings.  And now I&#39;m in love with someone else.”  Gemory pouted.<br />
<br />
“There, there, Lord.  The heart wants what it wants, there is nothing fair about it.  You know that well- how many souls have you tempted, knowing this?”<br />
<br />
“Quite a lot.  Oh Bel, she&#39;s just a girl!  I&#39;m wicked, vile, evil, depraved...how can she ever love me?”  The tears threatened to come, but Belzazel wiped them away with her hair.<br />
<br />
“Shh, none of that now.  Yes, you open yourself up to being hurt.  And yes, this likely will end in pain and loss, I won&#39;t lie to you.  But think of the rewards!  You could gain something no other Devil has.”<br />
<br />
Gemory looked to her retainer.  “What is that?”<br />
<br />
“You could be happy, My Lord.”<br />
<br />
Thinking about that, Gemory smiled.  “I hope you know, you&#39;re going to be my Best Man.  Or Maid of Honor.  Not sure which yet.”<br />
<br />
“I will be happy to be either, if it means I can see you smiling, My Lord.”  Belzazel kissed her Lord on the forehead.<br />
<br />
Gemory hugged her retainer tightly.  “I don&#39;t deserve you, Bel.  Ok.  So you&#39;re going to be in charge while I&#39;m busy.”<br />
<br />
“Of course.”<br />
<br />
“And that means you&#39;ll have the run of the place.”  Gemory smiled.<br />
<br />
“Does that include...your harem, My Lord?” Belzazel got a lusty smile on her face, as visions of fucking Succubi with her mighty cock danced in her head.<br />
<br />
“I suppose it does.”  But then Gemory&#39;s smile turned sly and mischief could be seen in her eyes.  “But Bel?”<br />
<br />
“Yes My Lord?”<br />
<br />
“For your insubordination, no matter how welcome, I must punish you.  So you must remain in that form until further notice.”<br />
<br />
Belzazel made a sour face.  “Oh you Bitch!”<br />
<br />
Gemory kissed her Captain on the lips, then pulled away with a smile.  “That&#39;s -THE- Bitch, and don&#39;t you forget it!”<br />
<br />
Confused by conflicting emotions, Belzazel could only nod.  “Yes, My Lord.”<br />
<br />
“Oh and, lose the &#39;My Lord&#39;.  I&#39;ve decided I&#39;m a woman now.”  Gemory made a dismissive gesture.<br />
<br />
“Does that mean we are to address you as Duchess of Hell?”  Bel queried.<br />
<br />
“NEVER!!!!”  Gemory&#39;s eyes blazed.  Then, after a moment, she looked a bit embarrassed.  “Um, what I meant is, my bride will be the Duchess of Hell.  Danielle Western.”<br />
<br />
“Of course, My...Lady.”<br />
<br />
Gemory conjured a pillow and threw it at her Captain.  “Oh knock it off.  My friends call me Gemory.”<br />
<br />
Now it was Bel&#39;s turn to feel her eyes misting.  “Thank you, My...Gemory.”<br />
<br />
Gemory kissed her again, which caused Bel&#39;s temperature to rise to dangerous levels, then hopped off her throne and skipped...yes skipped...out of the Throne Room, giddy as a school girl.<br />
<br />
“Oh this is going to be trouble.”  Bel thought.  Then shrugged.  If this made her job harder, so be it.  Her smile turned vicious.<br />
<br />
“I&#39;ve been bored anyways.”</p>
