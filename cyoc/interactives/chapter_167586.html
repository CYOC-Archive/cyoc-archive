<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Through his blue vision, Jake saw his penis filling up with blood, standing at full mast, and he felt... like someone was sucking him off! No one was there, but he felt warm, soft sensations all over his dick, spreading from the head down the shaft, down to his balls, and from his groin outwards. The feeling overtook him completely. It was like a thousand hands were massaging every inch of his body, with his dick being first and foremost. This was awesome! Jake felt like every nerve in his body was lit up and dancing. He wanted it to go on and on. He realized that he was moaning. &quot;Oh, god, oh fuck!&quot;<br />
<br />
 The arteries on his neck were standing out. If anyone had seen him like that, they probably would have guessed he was trying to lift something very heavy. And his muscles seemed to be straining exactly as if that was what he was trying to do. Jake could feel the blood was rushing into his muscles, engorging them, making them swell, they were swelling with fire and pleasure. He felt the fire of joy in his chest, in his gut, in his arms, shoulders, thighs, calves and his rock-hard dick. Jake stood there looking at his naked torso and actually saw it grow. His shoulders got broader. His chest became more pronounced. His neck thickened. And the fat that he&#39;d put on during the day melted away.<br />
<br />
Jake stood there staring at himself. He was pumped. He looked exactly the way a weightlifter looked after a hard work out. His muscles were all swollen and hard, veins were standing out; it was really fucking impressive. And just when the feeling had begun to subside in his muscles, it became more intense in his crotch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuuck!&quot; Jake moaned and groaned, looking down on his red dick, watching it throb and pulse, watching it GROW. He watched as his penis pulsed and pulsed, and then stretched, like his shaft was pushing the flesh further out, like his cock was some plant from a nature documentary that grew in short intervals. He grabbed his dick with his right hand, before he felt his fingers being forced apart, as his cock broadened and thickened, growing fatter and more solid to make up for the added length, his head swelling like a purple balloon, the veins pumping blood as fast as they could, his dick growing bigger, BIGGER! He felt it in his balls, too, watching in the mirror, as they pulsed and surged, drawing up close to the shaft and expanding. <br />
<br />
As the feeling all over his junk became too much, he felt himself orgasm, heavily, mightily, cum shooting out of his big cock, hitting the opposite wall near the ceiling, once, twice, up to eight thrusts before he was finished, his cock throbbing down, cum seeping out of the slit, and he leaned in to the cabinet, sitting down on the tiles, breathing heavily as his vision turned normal again. He closed his eyes for minutes as he regained his breath, before opening them to see where he&#39;d come on the wall, where there was a hefty trail of... blue cum.<br />
&quot;No, no&quot; he moaned, &quot;not that too.&quot;<br />
   ________________________________<br />
<br />
When he&#39;d cleaned up the mess left by his discolored orgasm, he turned to inspect what had changed. Pleasingly, almost all of the fat that he&#39;d amassed the last day had vanished, leaving muscle behind instead. Disappointingly, he had not turned as massive as he&#39;d initially thought during the transformation - though he seemed to have put on some muscle, at least. Looking at his chest, there were now two distinct bumps where he knew most guys had pecs, where just this morning he&#39;d been able to see his ribs. His shoulders, though still not exactly broad, were slightly wider, a little bit of flesh rounding out the bony corner that had been there previously. <br />
<br />
His back seemed a bit stronger, in that he couldn&#39;t see his ribs as easily, and his thighs and calves were slightly thicker, too. When he turned, he could see that his nonexisting ass had achieved existence, at least, a slight roundness visible beneath his lower back from the side. When he turned to his stomach, though, he felt... mixed. His six-pack was gone, obscured under a light layer of fat, the last that remained from his eating escapades. Though... he&#39;d never really had a six-pack before either, had he? A skinnypack wasn&#39;t a real six-pack, and he could always exercise away the excess that stopped him now. Hell, he had probably stronger and bigger abs now than before, it was just that he couldn&#39;t see them! He could really get used to this feeling. His arms, too, had gotten a makeover, in that he could say that he had biceps and triceps. Granted, it wasn&#39;t much, but it was more than he&#39;d had this morning. He found the scale. 160 lbs. Which meant that he&#39;d kept most of the excess weight, but it had turned into muscle! How in the flying fuck had this happened? He thought about the blue semen again, then remembered the other thing that had grown. His cock!<br />
<br />
Jake brought the tape measure to his flaccid dick, measuring length and girth, like Elijah had instructed him years ago. He had definitely grown bigger soft, his tape showing six inches completely soft, both along and around. Then, he had to get hard for the real thing. But as he&#39;d just had a legendary nut, he had to try for several minutes to get it up, then only for thinking about Thalia, and how he would have ravished her, had she been his girlfriend, not Will&#39;s. That was also a question. How much had he actually grown? Could he be bigger than Will, the most hung guy for miles? As he got as hard as he could, he carefully brought the tape to his dick. Six, seven, eight... eight and a quarter of an inch. So, not as big as Will. And around? Six... and a half. &quot;Weird,&quot; he muttered to himself. Jake had gotten thicker than longer. Quite exactly halfway between his old size and Will&#39;s, Will being thicker proportionally than Jake and especially Peter with his slim five inches of girth. His balls were slightly bigger, too, but not even they looked to be bigger than Will&#39;s stones. Oh well, Jake thought. At least now I&#39;m longer than Peter.</p>
