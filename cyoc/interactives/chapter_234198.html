<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Before anything major could happen I gave my young mother the comforting hug she really needed. She was surprised by my action and begun to cry on my shoulder. The visions faded as quickly as they had came and I had corrected something. My mom in future would be a nerd and everything stayed the same.<br />
<br />
After a while she calmed down and said: &quot;I- I think I would be an okay mom at best for the baby.&quot;<br />
<br />
I patted my young mother&#39;s shoulder and agreed with her sentence. Saying that no-one is perfect and she shouldn&#39;t take the anger and frustration she received from David on the baby. Susan nodded her head and rubbed the stomach.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know this might be a bold question but would you like to become a father in future?&quot; She asked as she looked at my with baby doll eyes.<br />
<br />
I knew deep down in my heart that this was wrong but she didn&#39;t know who I was and saw me as a random student who cared about her. I also had to wish ring so in a way I could hop back in time and just rewrite the history. So out of morbid curiosity I just gave my young mom a kiss as: &quot;I would love to.&quot;<br />
<br />
The rest of that day we kept talking. She shared her phone number to her house and asked if we could hang out tomorrow at the school. I gave her couple of pecks in the cheek and before her parents could get home I slipped out from the backdoor. Outside the house I made a wish that one of the empty apartments in a quiet neighborhood would be my home and that no-one would question why a 17-year-old boy would live there alone. I never signed any contracts but I still had house keys at my hand. It felt weird for me to live like this and the first night was spooky. I already missed my mom but in my heart I knew that I had go through this. I just had to.<br />
<br />
So the following year as I turned 18-year-old and my mother gave birth to me. I grew up to the so-called new independed life and with the ring I had wished a emergency cashbox that would always have random assortment of money that I could spend and no-one would ask anything about it&#39;s origins. My mother in other hand did the thing she had to do and stay at home to care of my younger self. Even if I &#39;graduated&#39; from the 1980s high school. The paper I got was somewhat useless as I didn&#39;t have worry about money.<br />
<br />
The whole year felt more like an extended holiday in a different city. Where some of the places that I used to know where more old but new. Movies were a big thing to pass time and arcades were booming. Me and Susan went to see the last part of the star wars trilogy but for me, who had seen it previously, knew it too well even if it was just first releasing. She loved how I told her my idea of those three begin sequels and that in future they should make story about the dark jedi wielding the red saber.<br />
<br />
As my mom finally turned eighteen and I had spent two years living in the past. I was pretending to work but mostly spent my days just walking in nearby parks in a suit and drinking soda. Some time later she finally moved to my apartment with the 1-year-old me. It was weird for me to see my mom this exicited while literally holding my babified self in her arms. I was 19-years-old at the time and secretly enjoying this. Susan would cover me in kisses and I acted like a good father for the little me. Even in the bed she would just admire me and give lots of hugs.<br />
<br />
I had told my younger mother a fake name as I didn&#39;t want to mess up with the past that much but somehow that didn&#39;t matter at all. I rarely got headaches and visions of changes. Maybe I had finally made a new timeline where I was my own person while my younger self was seen as somebody else. As we got older my mom suggested that she is ready to have another baby at the age of 20. I really was shocked what would happen if we did and just like that I did it. So before we could basically &#39;do it&#39;. Susan had asked her parents to baby sit my younger self and while we were walking home she had given me a kiss in the cheek.<br />
<br />
This was the moment I felt nervous about. To her I was her boyfiend who she met in high school but for me she was my mom but younger, but like, much much younger. But in a perveted way I just didn&#39;t give a fuck. For the past four years I&#39;ve spent my time in past. I had thought about everything that could go wrong, including this situation. Like, should I even do this, how morally wrong was this anyway if SHE didn&#39;t know who I was and how smoothly everything had gone so far and for so long. Why should I just call quits now?<br />
<br />
I called her Susan daily but in corner of my mind I always refered as &#39;my mom&#39;. That word. It just made my boner go hard and wild. The thought of fucking my mom and be around her as we grew up was making my cock solid. I begun to admit as we walked back to my apartment how perverted this was and how odd it felt. Like in a way this whole thing would be just confusing and complicated to explain to her. How would she even react.<br />
<br />
&#39;So like Susan, just that you know. You are my birth mother, I&#39;m time traveler from year 2000 and I came here because of this ring and...&#39; I thought to myself and looked at the ring.<br />
<br />
The ring itself was still in my finger. Could it be that because of what&#39;ve chosen my other self won&#39;t get this magical wish ring.<br />
<br />
I felt assured that if anything went sour I could bail out and hop back at anytime and just fix my problems. So as we arrived back to my apartment we immediately begun to undress ourselves and went straight to the shower. In there she would wash her mouth with toothpaste and she begun to suck my dick. Inside my mind I imagined I visualized Susan more closer to my mom&#39;s age which made me go even harder. She commented how happy she was to have me around and kept going.<br />
<br />
I told her that I was ready to do it.<br />
<br />
She and I walked near the bed and I begun to slowly pleasure her pussy lips with tip of my cock. She embraced me with her arms and pulled me closer as I humped her. All I could think of me fucking my 33-year-old mother as she moaned. I wanted her to feel good about this and make this thing last a tiny bit longer. As my balls hit her pussy and I went all the way down on her. I begun to feel myself just cumming.<br />
<br />
The second I came inside my mother a huge explosion filled my front brain as I kept going. I didn&#39;t know what to think about this as it made me more hotter and hornier. The visions changed and I saw my mom happy with a man... He looked like me but there was no way... I also had a sister who was 4 years younger than me. Memories of my dad was hazy like a TV-static but I could remember my sister teasing me. I remember that she was near me when I got the ring and we...<br />
<br />
The headaches begun to throb like a water balloon that was filled and emptied rapidly. I had a lot of weird memories that were like puzzle pieces. I didn&#39;t have clear memories of the past only fragmens of people I knew. My mom was a bit slimmer and she worked as a freelance comic cook artist than comic book store owner. She was great at drawing and sometimes she would show us commisions she did for people. Me and my sister would be inspired by our mom&#39;s drawings but in the end my sister was better at it.<br />
<br />
Then I passed out and slowly opened my eyes as I witness snoring Susan full of cum dripping from her vagina. I scratched my head as I had no idea what was going on. I think I had done it and change my past drasticly with this. Whatever I did now would affect her mood as she have to take care of two children than one. I let out a sigh as I begun to worry what should I do now. It only had been 4 years and there were 11 years to wait until I was back the the year 2000.</p>
