<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Suddenly the magic enveloped Damon and he saw his clothes vanished into nothing. Damon&#39;s body began developing crimson scales, and his body shape was altering dramatically. His hips became wide, his muscles shrank, his shoulders less broad. Damon then moaned as his dick became fully erect then shrank into his body as he reached down to grasp it. Damon screamed when his dick disappeared, and he noticed that his voice sounded higher pitched like a woman&#39;s voice.<br />
<br />
Damon watched as two DD cup boobs blossomed from his chest and his stomach was swiftly overtaken by thick orange scales, which also covered his new breasts. Damon grasped his, or her breasts in disbelief but then fell over onto all fours. Damon looked back to see her feet had changed into 3 toed digitigrade claws, and she looked to her hands and saw that they were now 4 digits with thumbs, and all of her libs were completely covered with red scales. <br />
<br />
Suddenly a large tail bursted out of Damon&#39;s rear and extended to match to length of her body, and wings sprouted out of her back and grew out giving her a wingspan of over three times her own body. Damon&#39;s neck then stretched out and all of her hair fell out onto the floor, and was replaced with two orange horns that grew out of her head. Damon&#39;s ears receded into the sides of her head into holes, and fins formed over them for protection. Damon&#39;s face then fushed out into a muzzle and her teeth fell out and were replaced with lots of sharp carnivorous teeth that could rip and tear at meat like paper. <br />
<br />
Damon&#39;s tongue lengthened and split at the end to become forked, and her eyes and nostrils became slits. As the scales finished spreading to the rest of Damon&#39;s body her nails turned black, and grew larger and thicker, and her body expanded and grew making her easily 32 feet tall. When the magical particles dissolved into Damon&#39;s body at the last moment she suddenly slumped onto the floor tired and blacked out unconscious.<br />
<br />
--------<br />
<br />
<br />
When Damon awoke she was inside of a large cave curled up with her muzzle between her own boobs. Once Damon realized where her muzzle was she jumped up and looked down at her body and shuddered at the thought of where her muzzle was. Suddenly Damon heard the sorcerer&#39;s voice say,&quot;It seems that the first parts of my spell worked perfectly. Now, I wonder if it actually functions properly.&quot; <br />
<br />
Damon looked down and saw the sorcerer standing right below her and she snarled,&quot;You...you did this to me!!&quot; Damon then by instinct shot out a bellowing flame from her moth that engulfed the sorcerer, and then it occurred to her that he was the only one who could change her back, and she stopped.<br />
<br />
Damon looked at the smoke thinking that she incinerated the sorcerer, but suddenly he emerged from the smoked surrounded by a forcefield of sorts. &quot;So you can breathe fire then...good.&quot; The sorcerer said<br />
<br />
Damon then pounded the ground angrily with her claws and growled,&quot;Turn me back this instant you scoundrel!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
The sorcerer looked at Damon with a serious expression and said,&quot;And what will you do to me? Your fire does nothing, and your physical prowess is nothing in the face of my magic. Besides it&#39;s not like you can convince someone about your condition, because you may not notice it now you can only speak in dragon-tongue.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you....?&quot; Damon began then paused listening to her voice. The syllables coming out of her mouth weren&#39;t familiar to her, but she could speak and understand them fluently. Damon thought she was speaking english, but she was speaking in dragon-tongue.<br />
<br />
&quot;It seems the mental adjustments have been successful too, and that means that there&#39;s only one more thing to check.&quot; The sorcerer said<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?!&quot; Damon growled at the man, but then there was a loud thumping sound that caught Damon&#39;s attention. Damon turned around and saw that the man was gone, and from the shadows of the cave she could hear a low growl.<br />
<br />
From the shadows emerged a large pitch black dragon with blood-red eyes and it was growling at her. The dragon then saw Damon and spoke in dragon tongue,&quot;Female, who are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Damon suddenly felt afraid realizing what the sorcerer meant, but also felt oddly aroused by the strong looking masculine dragon. &quot;I uh...my name is.... uh....Da....&quot; Damon began but her words were twisted around when she said her name, and she actually said,&quot;Dameila.&quot;<br />
<br />
The dragon paused for a moment seeing the nervous look on Damon&#39;s face and said,&quot;Dameila, that&#39;s a nice name. Actually that was my great-grandmother&#39;s name, and the thought is...a comforting reminder. You&#39;re aroused too, your scent says it all.&quot; The dragon said<br />
<br />
&quot;I...uh....&quot; Dameila began <br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, I see now, you&#39;re shy aren&#39;t you. Meeting new faces is difficult for you isn&#39;t it? Or is it just your first season of mating?&quot; The dragon asked<br />
<br />
&quot;S...season of m....mating?&quot; Dameila studdered<br />
<br />
The dragon paused for a moment then gave Dameila a look of intrigue and said,&quot;So it is your first season, or were you just looking for a cave? Because if you want this one, it&#39;s already claimed by me. My name is Girahed by the way, it&#39;s a pleasure to meet such a timid soul, but don&#39;t be so afraid of destiny.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wh...what do y...you mean b..by d...destiny?&quot; Dameila asked nervously <br />
<br />
Girahed walked over to Dameila and sniffed her body, and instinctively Dameila did the same to him. &quot;Oooh, such an exotic scent you have. You aren&#39;t from around here are you? In that case, come with me miss and I&#39;ll be your guide as well as your mate.&quot; Girahed said<br />
<br />
&quot;Wh..what?!&quot; Dameila asked afraid<br />
<br />
&quot;Why of course, you should know that in this area that if a male or female dragon lands in the cave of a dragon whose gender is different then they become mates. Of course this rule doesn&#39;t apply to dragon couples, but it still applies to single dragons. Considering how aroused you are you must be single, so allow me to guide you around the area, as well as help you deal with your hormones before you go into heat.&quot; Girahed said nuzzling Dameila&#39;s breasts and working his way to her chin.<br />
<br />
Dameila paused afraid then she felt a warm sensation building up in her pelvis. She can&#39;t be going into heat right now to this dragon, she was human, a prince. But as she looked down at her breasts and vagina they looked revolting to her, but now in a different manner from before. Dameila first disgusted her dragon body because it had features of a human woman, but now she disgusted it because she yearns for the opposite sex. Dameila denied these thoughts as much as she could but then looked to Girahed and found herself conflicted. What should she do?</p>
