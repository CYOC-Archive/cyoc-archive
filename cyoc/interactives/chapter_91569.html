<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kevin walks over to the stage to find a female stripper dancing about on the stage, loving the attention. He gets extremely hard watching her move. In fact, he got so hard that he needed some sexual relief fast, however, he couldn&#39;t take his eyes off her. She was a black female with a pair of whopping JJJ cup tits, bra less! He almost came right then and there watching her, but he was able to contain his pleasure. Quickly, while the woman was still dancing sexily, he ran out to get his notebook. He saw that he was running out of pages, so he wrote that there were more pages in the book. Then, he wrote that the show would be over when he went back to the stage, and that the woman&#39;s tits were soft, and that she would go home with him. He also wrote that his dad would not be home for a few more days. As an afterthought, he wrote that he would have more tolerance to sexual stimulation, and he would still feel it the same, only stronger, as well as adding that he would have the ability to grow/shrink his cock to fit his wants and/or his sex partner&#39;s wants (if he wanted that).<br />
<br />
When Kevin got back inside the club, he found that the show was just getting over. He got to the stage, and the stripper looked his way. She announced that the show was over for her, at least for that night. She came toward Kevin. &quot;Hey there, sexy. What are you doin&#39; tonight?&quot; Kevin replied &quot;Nothing much besides watching your AMAZING performance!&quot; He was so hard it was starting to hurt. She was looking down at his tented pants. &quot;You&#39;re pretty hard by the looks of it. How about you take me back to your place and we help you out. Maybe you could help me out, if you know what i mean.&quot; Kevin was pretty much stuttering at her now. &quot;T-Th-Th-That would b-be am-ama-amazing!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kevin drove the dancer back to his house, and on the way they were talking. &quot;I didn&#39;t catch your name before&quot; He said, &quot;My name is Kevin.&quot; She replied to him, &quot;My name is Jacqueline, but most people call me &#39;Busty&#39;&quot;. When they finally arrived at Kevin&#39;s house, Kevin immediately brought her to his room, which was for once, not messy. He had brought the notebook in, so he wrote that his bed was bigger, and everyone would remember it that way. When they got onto the bed, Kevin pushed Busty onto her pack, and started massaging her breasts. For a moment, he said that he had to run to the bathroom, which was thankfully now right across the hall. He grabbed the notebook on his way out and went to the bathroom. When he was done, he had an idea. He wrote it so that he would feel Busty&#39;s pleasure and anyone he had a sexual time with for that matter, when he rubbed, played with her breasts, pussy, etc. When he got back in, he hid the notebook when Busty wasn&#39;t looking. He went back over to Busty, and started massaging her breasts again. They were both naked, and he rubbed his cock on her leg while he rubbed her breasts, and felt both of their pleasure at the same time. He felt every sensation she felt and even felt what she was thinking. She was thinking &quot;This massage is AMAZING!&quot;, and Kevin was in HEAVEN! He never thought that breast massages would feel so GOOD!. All the while, Busty was moaning with pleasure. Kevin slowly inserted his cock into her. He practically went numb with pleasure. He started expanding his cock with his mind, and Busty started screeching with joy, as well as wondering why everything got tight in her groin with Kevin all of a sudden. &quot;What are you doing Kevin!?&quot; she screamed. &quot;You like it?&quot; He asked. &quot;Yeah, Kind of. But what are you doing?&quot; Kevin figured he should tell her about the notebook, but first write that she would have no selfishness when he told her and showed her (showing her after sex). He told her and wrote down the aforementioned statement.<br />
<br />
They finished Their lovemaking, and he showed her the book, which Busty was interested in, but because Kevin was smart about it, or rather wise, she wasn&#39;t selfish about it. &quot;Would you like larger breasts?&quot; He asked her. &quot;HELL YEAH!&quot; she replied, telling him every detail she wanted her boobs to have. He wrote all of it in the book, and within a few seconds, Busty&#39;s boobs were exactly as she wanted them, and Kevin was ALREADY hard again, defying the way that sort of thing usually works. The boobs were perfect. They were the equivalent of a ZZZZZZ cup each, and were firm but floppy at the same time, and Kevin made it so that he could change them to fit his and Busty&#39;s wants/needs. They went at it again and again. They had gotten there at about 9:00PM that night, and stopped going at it at about 5:00AM the next morning. Kevin still had a day before his dad came home and he had some questions for Busty, who&#39;s boobs were now back to their original JJJ size (for now...). <br />
<br />
&quot;Busty, I&#39;ve been meaning to ask you, would you be my girlfriend?&quot; asked Kevin when they were both waking up. &quot;And before you answer, I must inform you that if you answer no, i will make you anyway with the notebook and you will be OK with it. But answer honestly&quot;. And Busty did exactly that. She DID want to be with Kevin, and she told him that. He was elated.</p>
