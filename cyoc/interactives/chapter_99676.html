<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I got an idea&quot; John told the crying Steve. John whispiered it into Steves ear to make sure that their father couldn&#39;t hear them. Steve agreed but he asked how could they tell the police if they were stuck in hideous bodies. &quot;I have an idea&quot; John said. His father had foregotten the clothes his mom was donating. He eventually found a shirt and pants that he could wear. His dad stop wearing them due to how small they were getting. &quot;But you still look skinny on a fat body&quot; Steve said. John had put on the pants that were pretty short due to his dads fat legs but were still okay looking but the shirt was very loose. John grapped a couple of pillows, and with a bit of adjustin it looked like he had a beer gut again. Luckily he was wearing a long sleeve shirt covering Steve&#39;s muscular arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just make sure nobody comes around while I&#39;m gone&quot; John told his brother and stepped outside. The cop office wasn&#39;t far away so he walked to it. People didn&#39;t stare at him making John think his costume foolishy tricked them. When he got there he told the police officer his &quot;son&quot; had run away aanand he had the phone number. The cops eventually tracked him down and said they were sending a cop right now. John thanked them and went back home.<br />
<br />
Luckily his mom nor sister had come home yet and his brother was still there. &quot;Did it work?&quot; Steve asked. John told him it did and their problems would soon be gone. That&#39;s when the door was knocked by his mother. Steve ran upstairs to lock himself in his room while John took the notes and clothes his father had left behind and threw them in his room before closing it. When his mother opened the door she saw everything normally. &quot;I had a long day hun&quot; she told John before kissing him. John felt two feelings: His mom was kiss him-WTF and He couldn&#39;t enjoy it due to him being gay- :(<br />
<br />
She then began making dinner and asked for him to bring Steve down for dinner. John walked up the stairs toward Steves room. Steve had locked the door so John knocked on it and said &quot;Its your...father open up&quot;. Steve opened the door. He had turned off his lights. John told Steve that they would pertend he was sick and he would act as their dad until they brought him home from vegas. John then closed the door and told his mom that he was sick. After dinner his siter arrived home. &quot;Where&#39;s John?&quot; His Mom asked. John swallowed and told her he had run away but he was able to track him down. His mom begin crying wondering why he had run away.<br />
<br />
----<br />
Later after his mom had calmed down she had fallen asleep on their bed. John didn&#39;t want to take a risk by falling asleep on the bed and risk being caught so he stayed awake. He then went to the bathroom and pulled down his pants to reveal a 2 inch dick. John gasped and realized that the cops must have caught his dad and he swaped his dick to teach him a lesson. Hopefully he would swap anything else...<br />
<br />
Eventually the police called him saying they had caught their son and he was in prison right now. John walked their and saw his father glaring at him in his body. That&#39;s when John noticed his father didn&#39;t have the band anymore on his wrists. The cops told them what happened and John pretended to care and then they showed him a box of what they consficated from him. Inside the box was the band and John face grew with delight. After bailing him out they walked home in silent. &quot;Why&#39;d you do it?&quot; John asked. &quot;I just wanted to live a better life, don&#39;t you see how I turned out!&quot; John agreed and then they went home. John then got the tazer that the cops consficated from his father and tazed him. He passed out on the floor. Using the band he swapped their body parts until he was back with his body parts and his dad with his. Then he swapped his dads gut and arms his brother parts back to normal. <br />
<br />
Then John swapped his dads 2 inch dick with the one he used to have. John then realized he was going to be in a lot of trouble when he woke up but he didn&#39;t care evrything was back to naormal and reality had adjusted so that his dad didnt remeber what happened. John then walked to his bedroom and fell asleep.</p>
