<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">... a leather harness, and it seems to be sized for a human, although it's a little big for you.<br />
<br />
You sit and think about what this means, and who might be your &quot;secret admirer&quot;, but nothing comes to you. However, your curiosity gets the better of you, and you remove your shirt - the harness just wouldn't look right on a fully-clothed guy, but you wouldn't even consider going out naked.<br />
<br />
You glance at your clock, and see that it's half past seven, and you could probably walk to the park in half an hour... you certainly don't think you'd be comfortable driving while wearing the harness.<br />
<br />
And so, you slip the harness on, sliding your arms under the shoulder section, doing up the straps on the side. You find that the harness is, indeed, too large for you, but it's not so large that you can't wear it comfortably. A section of it hangs at the back, sitting against your arse-cheeks, and a strap runs down to the ground behind you. It is only then that you notice the head section, complete with a mouth strap. Shrugging, you fit it over your head, and slide the mouth strap into your mouth. It tastes much like the smell of fresh-mown grass, which you find slightly appealing.<br />
<br />
Putting your wallet and keys into your pockets, you leave your house, making sure to lock the door as you go. You walk down to the street, and absently scratch your rear. You pause only a moment before heading for the shortest path to the park. As you walk, your feet start to ache, and you feel a vague burning sensation between your butt-cheeks. The itch you felt on your rear intensifies, and you continue to absently scratch, first the same spot that you originally feel the itch, then more generally around the entire of your hip region.<br />
<br />
You turn down an alley that you know to be a shortcut, and your feet start to ache so bad that you cannot stand it anymore. You remove your shoes, and decide to carry them with you, because the moment your shoes come off your feet, the ache subsides to a dull throbbing. As you straighten up to continue, you find that you're viewing the world from a slightly lower perspective. You walk a few steps before realising that your knees seem to be permanently bent. You try to straighten them, and manage to do so, although it begins to feel painful, and you feel as though you are about to fall forwards.<br />
<br />
Attributing it to mere muscle fatigue, you continue, walking with your knees bent. You exit the alley, and cross the road in front of you. A couple walking down the street about 100 metres away stop and stare at you as you cross the road - you give them a short stare, and continue on your way, trying to figure out why they had looked at you so strangely. You walk down the road about 20 metres, then duck into the next alley in your shortcut.<br />
<br />
You can see the parklands ahead of you, now - all that's left is to pass through the alley, and cross the road, and you'll be there. The burning between your butt-cheeks grows stronger, and suddenly you hear a short ripping sound. Looking around, you perk your ears (which were starting to itch like mad) up as you try to figure out where it came from, but are unable to determine the origin of the sound. You adjust your pants and underwear, which paradoxically were feeling looser and tighter, respectively, and continue down the alley.<br />
<br />
You reach the final road, and you see a woman not far down the street. She looks at you for a moment, a look of shock on her face, and then she runs the other way, screaming. You stare in her direction in confusion, then look behind you, fearing that there was something there that might be scaring her... and you see an empty street. You figure that she must be going crazy, and cross the street. As you near the other side of the street, you hear a single clopping sound. Your ears perk up again, and you look around in confusion. Upon seeing the empty street again, you glance down the way the woman ran, then, fearing that the sound was related to whatever she was running from, you walk quickly into the park, where the trees were thick enough for you to hide in the shadows, at least for a moment.<br />
<br />
You adjust the leather harness, which is starting to feel tight, and lean against a tree. As you lean forwards slightly, your pants slide off. Glancing down at them, you are shocked at what you see - in place of your normal legs, there are two hairy, animalistic legs, ending in hooves. A bulge at your crotch is putting a strain on your underwear, as is something at the back. Twisting, you see something sticking out of the bottom of your underwear, straight through a hole in them. Reaching back, you grab the strange object, to find a hairy appendage, which a quick tug confirms is attached to your rear.<br />
<br />
Being a fairly smart guy, it doesn't take you long to recognise it as a tail - and you recognise both tail and legs as being those of a goat. You remember a story you once heard, about the greek myth of the satyr, and wonder dispassionately if perhaps that's what is going on... until a wall inside you breaks, and your fear catches up with you. You drop your shoes and leave them and your pants behind as you run towards the fountain, hoping that a cure for whatever's happening to you can be found there.<br />
<br />
You only run a short distance before your underwear tears off your body in two pieces - and one of the pieces decides to get caught on a cracked rock while entangling your left hoof. Tripping, you fall to your hands and hooves, and scramble forwards, trying to regain your feet - only, you find that your body won't raise back up. You feel a rubbing sensation for a moment, and the piece of harness that had been sitting against your butt-cheeks slips down, holding your legs in place, so that you simply cannot raise back to a standing position.<br />
<br />
You continue to scramble forwards, towards the fountain, and you start to find it easier to keep looking forwards, although your neck is burning. You continue to half-trot-half-scramble your way to the fountain, which is now right in front of you.<br />
<br />
As you reach the fountain, you raise your hands up to the rim, and peer over the edge. What you find there scares you further - your ears have elongated, and are now very furry. Your hair is scruffier, and you can see some hair growing on the back of your neck, and even part way down your back. Your neck is huge, almost as thick as your chest, which is surprisingly rounded, and your neck is almost as long as your forearm. It joins your head at the back, rather than the bottom, where it normally would, and you can see the muscles bulging out at the top, holding your head up. Meanwhile, your eyes look unusually large, although your face still looks human enough.<br />
<br />
Looking back along your body, you see something equally strange - your barrelled chest is still otherwise human in appearance (and the harness fits perfectly), as are your arms... although your hands seem to naturally sit slightly differently, naturally holding your body up without any discomfort. Your torso looks completely human... until the point where your belly button had been - from there back, your body appears to be all goat, complete with pendulous testicles and sheath. You can see your tail swishing around right at the back.<br />
<br />
Carefully, you shift your weight onto your left hand, and lift your right hand up, slowly working it backwards. You find that it's not quite so easy to move your arms as it had been, as they connect to the chest in a different way from how they used to, but you manage to get your hand down to the goat-part of you. You feel the hair, convincing yourself that it's real, and then poke a finger into your sheath. Feeling your penis in there, you reach as far as you can, and just barely manage to grab onto it, and slowly pull it out. Your jaw drops as it continues to come out, stretching to nearly as long as your forearm.<br />
<br />
You release it, and it slowly recedes back into its sheath. It is only then that your ears perk up as you hear something coming.</p>
