<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Benton and Amanda where still at Awareness; Bento’s phone rings. Growling as he sees the caller id Arnold Stewart Stevenson; the were-panther was debating whether or not to answer. Figuring he wasn’t going stop; Benton answers all the while glaring at the tailor for being stuck with another needle.<br />
“Arnold,” Benton being polite; “it was been a while.”<br />
“Not since your big remodeling job,” Arnold answering.<br />
“Ah yes,” Benton grinning; “I caught your contractor trying to use inferior building materials to build my estate’s expansion. I did enjoy chasing the were-rat off my property while in my fursona.”<br />
“Loo-Look,” Arnold stammering; “it was a simple misunderstanding.”<br />
“A Misunderstanding?” Benton starting to growl; “I had to have every single piece of my house your men touched inspected and redone due to shoddy workmanship. Not one single bit of work your company did would have passed building code. But I digress, for what do I have the honor of you calling me?”<br />
“I-I was calling in regards to putting in a bid for the new elementary school your funding,” Arnold now completely nervous.<br />
“Oh you can you put in a bid,” Benton grinning; “you can put in as many bids as you want. Not one will be looked at, as the architectural firm designing the school will be deciding on who gets to build it. I have already handed them a short list of who I would like to see on the team,” Benton grins even further; “I can tell you with glee, that your company has been effectively black balled from any and all future projects funded by me.”<br />
“You can’t do that,” Arnold now sounding mad; “I have every right to earn the contract. This is a public building being built.”<br />
“Which is funded,” Benton answering; “solely by me. Which makes it a private venture; until I hand it off to the school board.”<br />
“You’ll be hearing from my attorneys,” Arnold trying to threaten Benton.<br />
“The same attorney’s that nearly bankrupted you due to incompetence?” Benton cackling; “After I sued your ass and your company for shoddy workmanship? Good luck with that.” Benton hangs up the phone with a satisfying smile on his muzzle. His wife staring at him as she holds onto her purchases of new evening wear and several dresses.<br />
“Are you nearly done,” Amanda looking at her were-panther husband.<br />
“It depends,” Benton answering; “how many more pins are you going to poke me with tailor?”<br />
“Funny,” the tailor drolls; “about another fifteen more minutes, provide you stay still.”<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
As promised it was another fifteen minutes when the tailor was finally done getting in Benton’s final measurements for his new suits.<br />
“I will contact you in a week;” the tailor speaking; “final adjustments and all that.”<br />
“Lets not forget the bill,” Benton defurring and getting dressed.<br />
“That as well,” the tailor answering; “my suits and services are not cheap. But the quality is unparalled. You were already wearing some of my stock apparel when you came in.”<br />
“My daughter bought me that suit last Sunday,” Benton signing a form; “I have to admit, it is a nice suit.”<br />
“Then you will be pleased with the ones I will have crafted for you next week,” the tailor answering.<br />
<br />
Benton nods as he and Amanda walk out of the store. Looking at the time and seeing it’s almost noon, they mull what to do.<br />
“Want to head home and wait for the council to call us,” Benton sighing<br />
“Don’t need to wait for the council to call,” Amanda looking at her phone; “Frieda just texted. Julie got a hundred and fifty year sentence.”<br />
“So that’s done then,” Benton answering; “let’s get your stuff into the car and go pick them up.”<br />
“Not necessary,” Amanda putting her phone away; “Frieda texted again. Lance is driving them back to the estate. Let’s get something to eat first before we head home.”<br />
“Grrrrrrr then,” Benton looking across the street.<br />
“Sure,” Amanda looking at the restaurant just started to open up for lunch service; “I wonder what they are serving.”<br />
<br />
Taking the few minutes to put Amanda’s purchases in the town car; both she and her husband Benton walk across the street and enter the front entrance of Grrrrrrr.<br />
“Welcome to-“ the attendant speaks but is quickly interrupted.<br />
“Grrrrrrr,” Benton removing his clothes and shifting into his were-panther fursona; “this is not our first time here, table for two please.<br />
As the Attendant escorts the two were-panthers past the red doors into the restaurant dining area; they are greeted by a were-otter waitress.<br />
“Welcome to Grrrrrrr,” the waitress smiling; “is this your first time here?”<br />
“No,” Amanda responding; “we dined here last Wednesday evening.”<br />
“Ahh,” the waitress leading the were-panthers to their table; “you had the braised pork belly then.”<br />
“So what is the set meal today,” Benton asking sitting down at the table they were led to.<br />
“It’s a bit of southern charm today,” the were-otter waitress speaking; “Cajun fried chicken with cornbread and hot grits. But to start we have a minestrone soup.”<br />
“Not too spicy for me please,” Amanda speaking; “I’m not a big fan of spicy heat.”<br />
“Iced coffee to drink,” Benton is speaking; “and yes I know the dessert is a surprise.”<br />
“You have been here before,” the waitress chuckling; “is that two iced coffees?”<br />
“Yes,” Amanda answering; “a large one for me please.”<br />
<br />
Lunch at Grrrrrrr was a quite affair. Being the first couple to enter the restaurant that caters to weres exclusively; the Knights were able to enjoy their meal in peace.<br />
“Cornbread is just like moms,” Benton taking a bite; “it takes me back to my youth.”<br />
“Your mom cooked,” Amanda raising an eyebrow; “I thought you had a household staff.”<br />
“Of course my mom cooked,” Benton answers; “even my dad liked to make a meal or two now and then. Believe it or not Amanda,” Benton sighs; “before we met, my family wasn’t wealthy. Dad helped start the company I now run and we only just moved into a mansion.”<br />
“But you said the Knights helped found Moon Lake,” Amanda looking surprised; “was that a lie?”<br />
“Nope,” Benton answering; “but like most of the founding families of Moon Lake, the Knights were immigrants to America. Fresh off the boat in New York and taking the grueling trek along the Oregon Trail; at least that is was dad let on.” Looking at Amanda; “it’s not something I’m proud of. Coming from a poor family, it’s why I became such a successful and ruthless business man. Ensuring the Knight family never again has to experience poverty.”<br />
<br />
Benton is silent for the moment before speaking up again. “Perhaps that is why it is so difficult to connect with Frieda,” Benton sighs; “I have spent too much time accumulating wealth-“<br />
“That you failed to realize,” Amanda putting her fork down; “that our daughter is our wealth.”<br />
“Now you are sounding like my mother,” Benton answering; “but you are correct.”<br />
“I’m sounding like Esmeralda,” Amanda blanching; “don’t tell her. It’ll be the death of me if you do.”<br />
“As long as you keep the family origin,” Benton placing a paw on Amanda’s paw; “I just told you to yourself. I don’t want Frieda or her children to know.”<br />
“I’ll stay silent on the matter,” Amanda finishing her chicken; “but what about your parents? What about Anton and Esmeralda?”<br />
<br />
Benton sighs as he knows that his parents; wild and carefree as they may be in their twilight years would not hesitate to talk about their roots and be proud of them. Not knowing that as they are served the same dessert both savagely devoured last Wednesday; mint ice cream with catnip infused rice pudding, a rabbit stew was cooking in their kitchen oven.</p>
