<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Special thanks to Juan Tiller for contributing to this chapter!</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Juanita Tiller, better known as JTassPlays aka PeachesnCreme, rubbed her perfectly formed breasts in front of the cameras. She had smooth skin, tanned to perfection, and as she massaged a breast she flipped her long blonde hair out of the way, smiling and revealing pearly white teeth. Along with her mesmerizing purple irises, her perfectly symmetrical features could literally break hearts.  One of her donaters to her stream had told her he’d divorce his wife for her. She’d giggled and blew him off, she did have the body of a goddess, but it had bothered her.<br />
<br />
She sighed and moaned, hand trailing down her perfect runner’s body and slapped her heart-shaped ass. Donations poured in. Demands for more. For feet pics-actually the easiest money she’d ever made, even when they wanted her to do weird shit like step on loaves of white bread. She smiled and spoke to her fans, telling them she had a surprise for them.<br />
<br />
She heard clothes rustle to her side. Juanita spared a glance to her partner, David. He too was sculpted to perfection, like Michelangelo’s statue of David come to life. Perfect build, muscular but slim and athletic. Juanita pursed her plump red lips and blew him a kiss.<br />
<br />
David was her best friend and former roommate. He used to be a nerd, but thanks to the Book of Body, he had always been a hunk and she lost him as a friend….almost. Then she showed him the Book, demonstrated it on a couple across the street, and then asked him to change him. <br />
<br />
Yes, that was the correct pronoun. She used to be a guy named Chuck. Unfortunately the life of a woman proved harder than he’d expected. For some reason, the reality shift that had happened to David and the neighbors hadn’t happened to him. Chuck, now Juanita, had to buy clothes, get new papers, everything. <br />
<br />
Being a woman and pretending to be a woman were completely different experiences. Very expensive ones. So she and Chuck had hatched a plan to make money as streamers. By the time he could afford to actually be a woman, however, he hated it. Being a woman officially sucked now, it was a job for him-literally. In a way, he was thankful that the reality shift hadn’t occurred. <br />
<br />
>Who’s there?  USER David1234 asked, donating $5.<br />
<br />
David entered the frame, 8 inch cock erect. Juanita gave a fake look of shock at the camera. Straight as she was, even she had to admit that David did something for her-at least when she was in this body.<br />
<br />
“Oh! It’s my friend David! What do you think we should do, guys?” Juanita placed a hand to her mouth in false shock.<br />
<br />
>Suck him off USER SAMhain said, donating $30<br />
<br />
>Let him rail you from behind USER Ganondorf45 said, donating $20<br />
<br />
>Use your feet to jerk him off USER Spacekat96 said, donating $50<br />
<br />
>Stop fucking with reality before you get pregnant, Chuck. USER RKPalatine said, donating $500.<br />
<br />
Juanita caught the last comment and froze. Someone knew who she was? She managed to recover and laughed off the donation. <br />
<br />
“Looks like the vote is foot-job! Okay, if you guys are sure?” Juanita batted her eyes in confusion, fishing for a few more donations. <br />
<br />
Messages poured in, telling her yes, that would be fine. SAMhain grumbled a bit, but he was loyal. David sat down next to her and shot the camera the kind of smile Superman would have if he were real. He pulled out a bottle of massage oil.<br />
<br />
“Come on babe, lay back and relax, you’ve been working sooo hard.” David cooed.<br />
<br />
Juanita sighed dramatically and fell back into his arms. He positioned her so her feet could be seen on the camera. Then he rubbed her feet sensuously. Juanita moaned and groaned. She didn’t actually enjoy it, not really her thing, but she played to the crowd.<br />
<br />
“Oh!” She bit her perfect lip and flexed her toes, “Right there, babe.”<br />
<br />
Her eyes fell on the shelf along the wall, where some of the new dildos they’d custom-order from a guy in Texas sat. She planned to show them off today, right after the foot-job. Give the dude some free advertisement. They were so realistic that she was even convinced that they moved and thrust on their own, despite not having any batteries. She was really excited in his newest sex doll, Big Hoss Hank the Horse. It was so detailed and had some many cool add-ons,it would definitely net her some big money on streams. She’d commission her own personal toy when she settled on the animal she wanted.<br />
<br />
Another donation came in, along with an alert. At least a $1000 dollars. She didn’t bother to look at it as she flexed and splayed her toes, writhing in feigned enjoyment. David glanced over at the newest donation and his eyes widened.<br />
<br />
>Fuck her silly and cum inside her USER RealityAuditor69 said, donating $100,000<br />
<br />
David licked his lips and stared down at her. Unlike ‘Juanita’, he didn’t hate his life. He loved it, especially after he compared his new life to his old ugly nerd life, thanks to touching the Book. And he really liked to stream with Juanita because…he loved her. He hadn’t just turned Chuck into the perfect woman, he’d turned her into HIS perfect woman.<br />
<br />
Sensing the pause, Juanita looked up at him and winked. “Ready lover boy?” <br />
<br />
She expected him to move her feet to his straining cock, but instead he splayed her legs wide, giving the camera a view of her tight shaved pussy. Confused, she shifted to the side and caught the last donation out of the corner of her eye. As she processed it, she could feel the tip of David’s perfectly formed cock circling her entrance.<br />
<br />
“What are you doing?” She hissed, blocking her entrance and knocking his cock away. “If you impregnate me I won’t change back until I birth it or abort it.”<br />
<br />
“Why would you want to abort our baby?” David asked, lips moving to nibble on her ear.<br />
<br />
Juanita tried to push him away, but found herself caressing his pec and moaning. “S-stop, we can’t fuck on stream.”<br />
<br />
“Stream?” David raised a perfect brow, “I’m just taping our love making.”<br />
<br />
She glanced at the screen and saw…nothing. No donations, no streams. Just a perfect angled shot of her and a close-up shot of her pussy from the two cameras in the room. Her new husband was finally going to claim her. Pleasure welled up deep inside her, though the thought was not hers. Her inner monologue was male. Wait, his. His inner monologue.<br />
<br />
David started massaging her breasts, kissing and flicking the nipples, each flick a little shock of pleasure. She moaned, enjoying the feeling despite herself. As his kisses moved up her neck, waves of pleasure radiated from her snatch. A wetness oozed between her fingers. Her free arm moved to encircle her lover, breath quickening.<br />
<br />
The kisses stopped and David gently pulled her hand free from her juicy pussy. He brought her hand to his lips and licked the fluids off them. He lowered his head to her pussy and lapped around her lips.<br />
<br />
Juanita cried out in pleasure as his tongue did things no sex toy or finger ever could. Something was wrong, but the tingles were telling her it was all right. She heard a faint *pop* and suddenly she wasn’t on the floor, she was in a Queen-sized bed in their honeymoon suite, her wedding dress in the corner on a hanger.<br />
<br />
He stared at the dress, horror edging out the pleasure. Why would he ever marry David? They were just-he failed to stifle a moan as David’s tongue flicked his clit-best friends. He couldn’t just fuck his best friend! No matter how attractive he was. And…he felt his breasts swell slightly…weren’t you supposed to marry someone you could spend your whole life with? She tried to push the voice out of her head, but it was hard when it sounded so similar to her own inner monologue.<br />
<br />
She found it hard to argue with that logic. Even harder because David chose that moment to slide his cock inside her, parting her glistening fold. She could see it on the monitor, David’s big cock gently opening her up with his thick cock like a flower. Juanita gave one final squirm but that merely let his cock bump against the side of her inner walls, lighting up her pleasure centers.<br />
<br />
David, I-ah!-I-you’ve gotta-” She wanted to tell him to stop, or at least wear a condom, but he pressed his lips to hers.<br />
<br />
“I love you too.” David broke the kiss, smiling down at her gently. “Ready?”<br />
<br />
“I-” Juanita tried, but gasped as she felt him bottom out, tip of his dick stretching her womb.<br />
<br />
David pulled out with a squelch that left her feeling empty, dick covered with fluids, before he plunged back in again and started pounding her, soft *pap*pap*paps* filling the room, alongside her moans. She tried to say something, but what could she say? Marrying her best friend was a good idea. Try as she might, with the pleasure filling her vision with stars every time his dick plunged in her, she simply couldn’t think of anything to say but-<br />
<br />
“I love you.” Juanita gasped. “I love you so much!”<br />
<br />
A ring *popped* on her finger.<br />
<br />
“I know sugar.” David grunted, pace of his thrusts increasing, “Let’s put a baby in you.”<br />
<br />
Juanita blinked. She wasn’t supposed to have a baby, right? She could always just abort it…but why would she abort their baby when they’d planned this for years? The pleasure was reaching a crescendo within in her, thoughts of having a baby and being pregnant and finally securing David as hers and she as his dancing through her mind.<br />
<br />
“David, I….” She gasped, the pleasure enveloping her, memories as Chuck fading and replaced as Juanita. <br />
<br />
She tried to grasp at them, but they slipped through her fingers like David&#39;s lovely cock slipped in and out of her luscious pussy. <br />
<br />
Being bullied at school crossed her mind, but David thrust in again with a gentle *pap*, and her walls squeezed and flexed, muscles she didn&#39;t know she had holding him inside her. And then he pulled out, and along with it the memory of her bullies, replaced with David&#39;s loving presence and strong arms. <br />
<br />
Junaita struggled with the thought, still a man in her memories.<br />
<br />
Another thrust, deeper, as though his cock were bigger, hitting every pleasure center as it slid in with a *pap*, and this time he stayed in thrusting lightly and shifting his cock around and her identity as a male, all her memories, scrambled. She moaned in confusion and held on to the only thing she had, David, her handsome rock in the storm. Her pussy remolded itself around the new cock, forming a powerful suction and with a  *pop* it pulled free, her eyes rolling back in pleasure as the memories were suctioned out. <br />
<br />
Juanita was happy and comfortable with herself now, eager for him to paint her womb white. But a name, Chuck, kept insisting it was somehow male. It made her head throb as that last holdout of her old self fought. <br />
<br />
David&#39;s cock was unrelenting and with a *pap* he thrust so deep she was sure he&#39;d gotten past her cervix and...and she was sure if he pulled out now she&#39;d lose something very vital and her pussy clamped down on that perfectly thick cock and her walls massaged it and she felt it flex and she realized it was a mistake because..because...<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, oh, I&#39;m-!&quot; She gasped.<br />
<br />
“M-me too. You’re so tight!”<br />
<br />
Juanita reached out, toes curling, for something to hold on to for the oncoming orgasm and her hand fell on the Book.  She wondered at it for a second, not sure what to do with it. She&#39;d felt his cock flex in her, it might already be too late. But then David pulled out and Chuck no longer existed and Juanita gave a quiet moan of relief, the tension in her head gone. As the relief washed through her David thurst into her one last time, impaling her on his glorious cock with a *pap* and she went over the edge, pussy spasming, the pleasure flowing through her in waves and she could feel David&#39;s cock begin to buck and her womb opened to welcome his seed. <br />
<br />
Juanita&#39;s grip on the Book tightened…and in the throes of her orgasm she accidentally smacked David in the head with it. Hard.<br />
<br />
David pulled out of her pussy and fell off the bed, his head hitting the side table with a *clunk* and going limp, his dick spewing cum on his thigh and on the floor, a huge load that would have definitely knocked her up. She stared at him in a daze, her memories and name slowly returning to her as she came to her senses.<br />
<br />
“Shape!” She said, pointing at David. <br />
<br />
David resumed his real form. Schlubby, white, 19, with messy brown hair and a crooked smile that braces couldn’t correct. A loser. The Master bedroom gave a *pop* and shifted back to the streaming room. Juanita leaned over and ended the stream, taking note of RKPalatine. Then she stood and stared at herself in the mirror.<br />
<br />
“Gender!” She barked. “Shape!”<br />
<br />
Her body lost her figure as her skin darkened and her hair receded into her scalp, darkening as well, becoming short and unkempt.  Her height rose to 6 foot, dainty runner’s build turning lanky. That didn’t last as pudge began filling out her form. Her breasts receded into her chest and hair spread across her body.<br />
<br />
“I wish this part wasn’t weird,” She said, her voice dropping a few octaves has her Adam’s apple grew in. Her face skewed and widened as it returned to his normal, pudgy teenage face. Juanita’s perfect pussy shifted, the clit elongated and thickened and her testicles pushed out with it, swelling and bobbing in a sac that was quickly becoming covered in a moderate amount of body hair. <br />
<br />
“Man,” Chuck said as the changes finished, leaving him stuck in ill-fitting clothes, “I really hate being a girl.”<br />
<br />
Chuck checked David’s pulse and examined his eyes. Just unconscious, no swelling or widening of the pupils. He’d likely wake up with a terrible headache. Chuck was shook, however, by what had almost happened on stream. As he contemplated the events of the day, he felt a wave of exhaustion sweep through him from casting so many spells at once.<br />
<br />
He collapsed back onto his twin-sized bed and wondered what had happened.<br />
<br />
Reality had shifted, trying to turn him into…David’s wife? And worse, someone had whispered to him, telling him he’d enjoy it. Was it that RK guy? No, Chuck shook his head at the thought, no, the instigator was RealityAuditor69. RK had tried to warn him, but then, how had RK even known what was going to happen?<br />
<br />
David groaned and rose from the side of the bed, unsteady. “What happened?”<br />
<br />
“You fell.” Chuck replied flatly.<br />
<br />
David sat on the bed, eyes unfocused. “What…what happened?”<br />
<br />
Chuck rolled his eyes. “You have a concussion. Don’t fall asleep.”<br />
<br />
“What happened?” David repeated.<br />
<br />
With a sigh, Chuck kept watch on David for a few hours until he snapped out of his fugue. He considered shifting Chuck again, but was afraid of having reality shift again. David hadn’t been the only one he’d shifted reality for to make more muscular, however. He was a senior in high school and a week away from graduation when he got the book….and he’d changed everything there. Mean girls turning fat, fat to thin, nerds to jocks and jocks to nerds. He’d run through every combination.<br />
<br />
Would that come back to bite him too? He had a feeling that it would. But clearly it hadn’t. Aside from David, of course. He just wished he could have gotten a better book with more varied spells. He even tried exploiting Shape, but uh….things went wrong.<br />
<br />
Whenever he tried doing things other than the most basic applications like muscle growth and weight gain, something always seemed to go wrong. He healed wounds and injuries but the wound wasn’t truly healed, it just looked healed. Gave a jock pink horns just to see if they noticed it as a prank and they hadn’t but…suddenly other people were sporting tails and animal ears and apparently bio-modding was a new craze sweeping the school. <br />
<br />
Chuck paced the attic, a tufted tail swished behind him in frustration. Surely something similar to what happened today must have happened then. But he hadn’t been affected at all! Chuck scratched the nub of the new horns that poked through his messy hair, one ear flicking in annoyance. He’d thought they looked cute, but he still got picked on for being chubby! Another of his failures.<br />
<br />
He really just wished he could figure out how to do this stuff to himself and make reality shift for him as it did all his other targets.But when he tried doing it to himself, people noticed. He’d given himself a clear complexion and muscles-not a lot, of course, he looked ridiculous with too much muscle, but nice and athletic. His day was ruined when some jocks poked fun at him, pinching him and pulling at his clothes, wondering how he’d gotten such a good muscle suit. <br />
<br />
So, after that failure and embarrassment, he thought it just might not shift reality if he performed it on himself. He had just gotten to college where he’d met David. A new start! He’d had David try and people still noticed! It was so frustrating, he didn’t know what he was doing wrong! But still, Chuck had kept experimenting with the new college students, trying to come up with something…and decided to become an e-girl and make money.<br />
<br />
And that’s how he landed in this mess, in a rented apartment next to the college with dildos on the shelves.<br />
<br />
But then he’d had a dream of a little girl, who’d asked him for help and lived in California…which sucked because he’d only just started streaming and couldn’t afford a car that would make it cross country without breaking down. But as he’d thought about the girl and the dream, he got scared. <br />
<br />
In short, along with the knowledge of other books being out there and having way more powerful spells and the fact that his Book just seemed useless in comparison, Chuck was fucked. He had no idea what he could possibly do against the Book of Beasts. Punch the owner before he got turned into a dog? Or the Book of Transmutation. That might be worse. End up a plushie or something, basically dead for all intents and purposes.<br />
<br />
Sure, he could alter their bodies, make them fat, but what the hell would that do if the Book of Myths summoned a dragon? Even a fat dragon could kill him with a flame breath. Or a small one. He knew that there were things he could do, but it seemed like a hell of a lot of work and planning compared to the Book of Arcane, which could just throw a lightning bolt at it and solve the problem instantly.<br />
<br />
Chuck put David to bed and went to his car-book in hand as he no longer trusted David-to get some food. He froze when he saw someone leaning against his little maroon Fonda. An albino with white hair and wearing an outfit he’d seen in the Fall Distian Cior catalogue one of his streamers had sent him.<br />
<br />
“Hello?” Chuck asked, hesitant.<br />
<br />
“You’re quite the artist, aren’t you Chuck?” RK nodded to the college. “That’s a fuckload of Paradox you’ve created. Nice horns. They’re cute.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t swing that way.” Chuck snorted. “And I don’t know what you mean by Paradox. Please stop leaning on my car.”<br />
<br />
“My name is RK Palatine and I am the owner of the Book of Divination.” RK replied calmly.<br />
<br />
Chuck scrambled to pull his book out of his bag but the zipper was stuck. He struggled for a bit, backing away from the albino. He wasn’t sure if this guy was going to kill him…or how, with the Book of Divination. Maybe some Final Departure-style Rube Goldberg shit. But if he could get his hands on it, that might give him a fighting chance.<br />
<br />
RK held up a hand and smiled. “Whoa, hold on buddy. I just want to offer you an opportunity at an alliance. Help out another Book Holder.”<br />
<br />
Chuck paused. “Did you know the zipper would stick?”<br />
<br />
RK smiled. “Put it in a messenger bag next time.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks for the advice, but I don’t know what I could possibly do to help them.” Chuck grumbled. “This Book sucks, man. On top of that, this contest or whatever, is a free-for-all, why would I want to help anyone. Hell, if anyone needs help, its me.”<br />
<br />
“You’re safe for now unless Paradox hits you again, caballero.” RK smirked, “I’m just thinking of the future. Many of these Book owners will kill you even if you hand them your Book just for fun or to tie up any loose ends.”<br />
<br />
Chuck swallowed. “So? What do you want?”<br />
<br />
“I’m asking you to help the Book of Beast fight the Book of Transmutation.” RK replied.<br />
<br />
Chuck laughed. “Come on, man. I’m not interfering in that shitshow. Insta-gib spells flying left and right! Why would I risk my life like that?”<br />
<br />
“You’re looking at it all wrong, it’s not about risking your life, it’s about protecting it.” RK replied. “I can forecast the future. Some of these futures are more likely than others. But I can also ‘lock in’ a future at the cost of incurring Paradox and force reality down a certain path. But see, it has to be a likely future. The Book of Beasts has limitations that your book can surpass. Your Book, used properly, barely triggers Paradox. People get fat. They get muscular. We see it as normal. Unless you do something stupid of course. Like, say, give a jock pink horns, and then you end up with cow parts that you are absolutely sure you’ve always had.”<br />
<br />
Chuck blinked and reached up to feel his nubby horns. “This is Paradox? But I bought them…”<br />
<br />
RK shrugged. “Too late to do anything about them anyways, your price has been paid. You’re just lucky you didn’t get knocked up. The Book of Beast could fix them for you if you want.”<br />
<br />
“Isn’t the Book of Beasts powerful enough on its own?”<br />
<br />
“Absolutely. But…if it falls to the Book of Transmutation, that’s a Game Over for everyone, eventually. Literally the worst outcome, 80% chance of turning you into a rather fetching cowboy fuck toy with milkable teats.”<br />
<br />
“Okay, say I believe you. I can’t change myself to fit in like the others. And…I’m afraid.”<br />
<br />
“If you make him a friend and ally, you can definitely change that. He knows the secret of changing reality for yourself.” RK handed Chuck a piece of paper. “This is the location of the owner of the Book of Beast. His name is Troy. Tell him I sent you and he might help you, but I suggest you make yourself a bit tougher. My own phone number is there as well.”<br />
<br />
RK began to walk away and called back over his shoulder, “You have a day and a half before the fight begins.”<br />
<br />
Chuck watched him walk off and then opened the paper RK had handed him. On it was a picture of a tiger man and his address. Chuck eyed the picture, tail swishing, flabbergasted, and leaned against his car.<br />
<br />
“Fuck.” He groaned, ears lowered in frustration.</p>
