<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Cody is a good looking guy he is about 5&quot;7&#39; he is toned and has short brown hair with piercing blue eyes and he is probably the only friend Todd has and they are always pulling little pranks on each other though Cody&#39;s last prank wasn&#39;t very small in fact it was down right hurtful Cody knew Todd had a crush on a particular girl and he told him that she had asked about him and that he should definitely ask her out turns out she had just gotten into a relationship with someone, they were big, and aggressive Todd ended up with some fractured ribs, Todd didn&#39;t hate Cody I mean even if he did make up that she liked him how was he to know that she had a new monster boyfriend but even so he knew how hard it was for Todd to go up and say something to her and that rejection alone would have been bad enough.<br />
<br />
looking through the app Todd selects the gender setting and swipes from male to female and sets the gradual setting on short &quot;what ever that means how do I know if short means 1 hour or year?&quot; Todd thinks to himself and makes sure that the awareness is on &quot;think that should do it&quot;<br />
<br />
Todd looks over at Cody to see if he can see any difference at all yet Cody looks over seeing Todd intently looking at him &quot;something up?&quot; Cody asks &quot;Sorry .... Uh I think you have some cake or something on the side of your mouth&quot; Todd slightly panics realising he was staring Cody reaches up and wipes his sleeve across his mouth and looks back to Todd with a quizzical look &quot;yeah you got it&quot; Todd says going back to look at his &#39;remote&#39; he see&#39;s a progress bar for Cody and he laughs a little thinking of how its like putting him in the oven and then the timer going off and out comes girl cody. Cody gets up grabs his towel and goes into the bathroom, because there isn&#39;t too much to do other that school work or TV showers usually take longer even without jacking it, Todd closes his eyes for a quick nap and wakes when he hears the bathroom door open &quot;still don&#39;t think there is any visible change maybe his skin looks softer that could just be from the shower though ... ehh&quot; Todd thinks &quot;I&#39;m going to get to bed so if you would keep the volume lower I&#39;d appreciate it&quot; Todd said &quot;sure thing want me to wake you in the morning?&quot; Cody asks &quot;sure that would be great&quot; Todds head hits the pillow and he is out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Todd! Wake up&quot; Cody shouts from the bathroom &quot;Yeah I&#39;m awake&quot; Todd groggily replies &quot;do me a favour I&#39;m not feeling great I&#39;m going to take a shower and try and sleep it off would you let my professor know on your way past?&quot; Cody calls &quot;that&#39;s a lot to ask a guy just walk into a class and give the hottest professor bad news, I don&#39;t want to be the one who takes her smile from her, shall i tell her you will be back tomorrow?&quot; todd asks &quot;No, I don&#39;t know what is up but I&#39;ve never felt this way when I&#39;ve been ill before, tell her you will let her know tomorrow&quot; Cody says Todd just realises Cody&#39;s voice sounds softer &quot;sure thing, I&#39;ll get you some aspirin on the way back too&quot; Todd calls as he leaves on his way to class he has a bit of luck &quot;just who I needed to see hi Lisa&quot; Todd calls as a voluptuous redhead turns to him &quot;ah Todd how can I help you?&quot; Lisa asks &quot;well unfortunately for me I have to be the barer of bad news Cody isn&#39;t feeling well&quot; todd says &quot;well it can&#39;t be good if he decided he can&#39;t come in, did he tell you about the time he refused to leave even after throwing up?&quot; Lisa has a worried look on her face to start but can&#39;t help but burst out laughing &quot;I can&#39;t blame him for not wanting to leave when he has you as his professor&quot; Todd teased &quot;your always such a flirt&quot; Lisa laughs &quot;but yeah I&#39;m not sure what is wrong but he said he isn&#39;t sure when he will be better&quot; Todd explains Lisa&#39;s face drops &quot;I hope it isn&#39;t serious&quot; she sighed &quot;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s too much to worry about but I will come let you know, I would love to stay with you but I do have to get to class I don&#39;t need to give Professor Stein any more reasons to yell at me&quot; Todd grumbled walking towards his class. class goes on as normal Stein taking any and all opportunities to call Todd out, its obvious it&#39;s a common thing as no one acts surprised he is called upon, after class he heads to the store gets some aspirin and head back to his dorm.<br />
<br />
as he comes in he can hear Cody sleeping so he quietly closes the door as not to wake him entering, looking towards Cody&#39;s bed it seems he pulled the covers all the way over his head but it is soaked its like he ran multiple marathons back to back he takes out the remote, points it at cody and presses pause Todd walks over and uncovers Cody as he looks he almost unrecognisable his face is pretty his hair has started to grow but it would still be considered short but the most shocking is that he is nude it looks like breasts have started to form he might have an A cup right now his areola have gotten to about the size of a penny and nipple have gotten fuller, he still as a dick but it&#39;s definitely smaller Todd has never seen it outright but sharing a room you see each other in underwear and Todd would have said they were similar in size this is like one of the Greek statues it almost makes Todd laugh out loud he covers Cody back up and unpauses him, with nothing to do he decides to leave the aspirin on the desk with a glass of water and watch something on his phone.<br />
<br />
*THUD&quot; &quot;OUCH!!&quot; Todd suddenly wakes after nodding off after hearing a feminine? voice from the bathroom he walks over and knock on the door &quot;Hey Cody you okay? you need any help &quot;NO!&quot; definitely a feminine but unquestionably Cody&#39;s voice shouting &quot;I&#39;m fine don&#39;t come in&quot; Cody adds &quot;are you sure you don&#39;t sound right&quot; Todd asks internally snickering a moment passes &quot;I can trust you can&#39;t I Todd?&quot; Cody&#39;s voice filled with uncertainty &quot;what kind of question is that of course you can, you are literally my only friend here&quot; Todd assures him the door handle turns but the door doesn&#39;t open straight away after a couple seconds it starts to slowly open &quot;don&#39;t freak out please, I&#39;m already doing that and I need someone to be calm&quot; Cody&#39;s voice gets shaky the door opens and standing there is a pretty girl wearing a hoodie and jeans that are too big for her although she is wearing a hoodie it is very clear she has large breasts her hair is long and she has tears welling up in the corner of her eyes &quot;I don&#39;t know what&#39;s happening to me&quot; Cody cries</p>
