<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next morning, word had gotten out about me. Huge crowds of people came by to look at me in my display case and take photos. I still couldn&#39;t understand what anyone was saying but they were clearly talking about me. The biologists even set up a table so they could answer questions. They sold things at the table but I couldn&#39;t see what they sold. Some of it looked like full color brochures or miniature booklets. It also looked like they were selling DVDs. Several of my friends and family stopped by. My parents rolled their eyes a lot. My friends bought DVDs and laughed.<br />
<br />
One of my teachers came by and picked up the key to open my display case. He said, &quot;Don&#39;t worry about classes. We&#39;re all so proud of you for what you&#39;re doing that we&#39;ve all excused you from classes for this.&quot;<br />
<br />
I asked, &quot;How much longer will I be here?&quot;<br />
<br />
The teacher said, &quot;I thought you knew. The news said you&#39;d be here until nine p.m.&quot; He then shut the display case and locked it again before I had a chance to ask another questions.<br />
<br />
At noon, the biologists took a lunch break but did not offer me any food. I was really hungry by then and a little delirious. I started feeling like an animal. At two, I was thrashing a bit trying to escape and get some food. At four, I had given up and just hung there in despair. Although my restraints were soft, I still began to chafe from the constant contact. I was exhausted and my legs gave out causing me to hang from my harness. I felt spit running down my chin but couldn&#39;t wipe it off.<br />
<br />
Blake stopped by to watch me from a distance but he was too shy to talk to the biologists.<br />
<br />
At five, the display case was opened and I had hope it was over but quickly realized one of the reporters had asked for a demonstration of how they do blood draws on animals so tiny. I tried to complain but my throat was so parched that I could barely manage a croak. At seven one of the students asked a question about male anatomy and a biologist thought it was fine to demonstrate on me. Held me upside down with my legs spread, they poked and prodded as the biologist explained male reproductive anatomy. I got milked again before being put back in the display case.<br />
<br />
At nine, they started packing up tables and shooing away the crowds. I thought that it might finally be over but then everyone left and I was still in the display case. I wondered if I would be there another night but then Blake came by with a key.<br />
<br />
He took me back to where the tables were from the day before, laid me down and finally restored me to normal size. Then he released me from the restraints but I was too tired to move. I just croaked, &quot;Water.&quot;<br />
<br />
He brought me water and helped me drink it. It took time because my throat was so parched that it was hard to swallow but I began to recover. When I wasn&#39;t so thirsty anymore, I said &quot;I&#39;m starving.&quot; Blake ran and got me some food. Then he started treating the many chafing injuries I had. At some point I fell asleep.<br />
<br />
I woke up in Blake&#39;s bed. He had shrunk me again and he wasn&#39;t there. I did feel a lot better. I checked my injuries and they were tender but not sore. I found my clothes nearby but they were too big for me.<br />
<br />
I was glad I was a foot tall because it was fairly easy to climb out of bed. From my perspective, the bed seemed to only be about eleven feet (3.4 meters) tall. I could almost jump it but that was risky. The door knob on the other hand looked like it was eighteen feet (5.5 meters) up. I found plenty of unused wires under Blake&#39;s bed to use as rope and climbed up to open the door. I found my way to the bathroom door which was open. The toilet required a climb of about eight and a half feet (2.6 meters). I found the plunger and used it to help me up. Then I stood on the edge carefully to pee.<br />
<br />
Then I climbed another seven and a half feet (2.3 meters) to reach the sink. I set the water and took a shower.<br />
<br />
Blake came home then and cheerily greeted me. I didn&#39;t talk to him. He offered to dry me off and I let him. Then I asked to be restored to normal height. He restored me. I got dressed and I left.<br />
<br />
I wasn&#39;t really angry at Blake but I was fuming that the situation had gotten so far out of hand. Many of my friends were delighted that I had endured so much to make a statement about animal cruelty. They invited me to watch one of the DVDs they&#39;d purchased.<br />
<br />
The DVD contained a documentary about animal cruelty. Much of the sound had been replaced by narration. It looked like it was hastily thrown together with a mixture of clips found on youtube and a handful of interviews but the majority of the footage was me in all my glory.<br />
<br />
My first scene was me running trying to keep up with the leash. The camera followed me closely so that none of the biologists could be identified. My next scene was the enema. Then they filmed a close up of my hairless dick peeing. My friends called me a shaved monkey during that scene and laughed.<br />
<br />
The next scene was of me being milked. The camera alternated between a close up of my genitals being milked, my ass being violated, and my face expressing pain and humiliation. I didn&#39;t remember crying but I could see the tear trails in the filth on my face. The narrator said, &quot;It is also a common practice in experiments with animals to take semen samples by force including probing the animals rectum.&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul said, &quot;I can&#39;t believe you let those guys milk you. I would ask if you enjoyed it but it&#39;s obvious you didn&#39;t. You are so dedicated to the cause.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then there was a scene of me being cleaned and then there were several scenes of me in the display case. The narrator went on and on about how many animals are kept restrained for long periods of time.<br />
<br />
The narrator then talked about how dedicated I was to the cause and included sound bites from Blake and the other biologists. Then the camera showed me pissing myself like an animal.<br />
<br />
After the DVD ended, Troy said, &quot;New DVD&#39;s have come out with additional material.&quot; He plugged in one of the DVD&#39;s and I got to watch myself all over again except this time, it didn&#39;t stop with me pissing myself. The cameras included news footage of the next day, additional scenes of me, and interviews with my friends and family.<br />
<br />
My friends and family talked about how I&#39;d always been interested in preventing cruelty to animals but that they were surprised at how dedicated I was to the cause. While watching this, Paul slipped his hand down my pants to feel my hairless groin. I flinched as he said, &quot;Completely hairless. You got yourself shaved completely hairless from the neck down.&quot;<br />
<br />
That was taken as a cue by my friends who jumped me and stripped me naked. I fought them but they outnumbered me. They then felt my whole body looking for any hair and if they found one, they yanked it out. They even felt my cock and balls and spread my ass crack looking for any hair. But that&#39;s all they did. They were having a joke at my expense. They let me up. I got dressed and left. The last scene I saw on the DVD as I left was me frothing at the mouth like a rabid dog.<br />
<br />
I became a celebrity and wherever I went, people wanted me to autograph my naked photos. Some of my fans gave me the creeps but many of my fans admired my dedication to the cause. Several people gave me gifts of appreciation.<br />
<br />
I avoided Blake for a few days. I was still fuming but eventually, I calmed down and went over to Blake&#39;s again.<br />
<br />
As I walked in his door, he shot me with the shrink ray, no hello or greeting. Then he grabbed me and stripped me. Then he went back to his notebook and ignored me.<br />
<br />
I yelled, &quot;Hey, Blake, you can&#39;t keep being so grabby with me. I&#39;m angry at you over what happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
Blake said, &quot;Sorry.&quot; and looked mortified. &quot;I won&#39;t grab you anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
I said, &quot;It&#39;s not that. You can grab me. It&#39;s just those biologists went too far and you forced me into being under their control but you failed to protect me. You need to promise me that you won&#39;t force me into situations like that again. You need to promise me that I can say no at any time and you&#39;ll restore me to normal height and let me leave.&quot;<br />
<br />
Blake said, &quot;I&#39;m sorry. I promise you can say no at any time. I won&#39;t force you into anything anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
We got that out of the way and I let Blake get back to his notebook. He ignored me more than usual and I was getting bored. I asked, &quot;So what do you want to do with me tonight?&quot;<br />
<br />
He said, &quot;I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m really focused on this new invention.&quot;<br />
<br />
I asked, &quot;Do you want me to leave?&quot;<br />
<br />
He said, &quot;No, I love your company. Please stay.&quot;<br />
<br />
I asked, &quot;Okay but do you want me to stay shrunk and naked?&quot;<br />
<br />
He said, &quot;Yes, you&#39;re my lab rat and my true friend. I like looking up and seeing you available for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
I said, &quot;Alright but I&#39;m bored. Do you mind if I look around?&quot;<br />
<br />
He said, &quot;Have fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
This was my first time to explore what it&#39;s like to be only one foot tall. Other than my trip to the bathroom, I&#39;d always been under someone&#39;s control at this height. This was the first time I was free to look around.<br />
<br />
Blake&#39;s desk was like a drafting table. It was angled a little and it was large. Nearby, he had a computer desk and some shelves. I found climbing to be fun and climbed to the top of his shelves. His house was a gymnasium at my size.<br />
<br />
I went to his kitchen. Blake&#39;s place was small but he did have the typical fridge and stove. I climbed to his counter top and he came out and got himself a snack. He fed me a portion before returning to his notebook.<br />
<br />
He did have a few other small animals. None of them were big enough for me to worry about. They were just lab rats of various kinds. I decided to visit them. They were scared of me because I was just a little bit bigger than they were. I got on the hamster wheel and went for a run. Then I got thirsty and decided to drink some water. Then I crawled through the hamster tunnels. Blake had set up quite a maze of hamster tunnels. I could almost go anywhere in the house through these tunnels except that there were few exits to keep the lab rats from escaping. I found my way to Blake&#39;s desk again and curled up for a nap.<br />
<br />
It was a short nap as Blake opened the lid and nudged me, &quot;I finished it or I should say, I finished fine tuning it. Do you want to give it a try?&quot;<br />
<br />
I asked, &quot;You mean you&#39;ve already tested it on animals?&quot;<br />
<br />
Blake said, &quot;Yes I have. I was just calibrating the safety features to make sure they stay at the correct settings. You ready?&quot;<br />
<br />
I said, &quot;Okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
He fired at me and I felt something tickle the back of my legs. I looked back to see what it was. &quot;You gave me a rat&#39;s tale?&quot;<br />
<br />
Blake said, &quot;Yep, you&#39;re my lab rat and now you have a tail.&quot;<br />
<br />
I asked, &quot;This isn&#39;t permanent is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Blake said, &quot;No. I&#39;ve worked it into a shrink ray so that when you&#39;re small, you&#39;ll have a tail and when you&#39;re large you won&#39;t.&quot;<br />
<br />
I thought this is pointless, a lot like so many other inventions of his. The shrink ray had some potential but even that had been used more for fun than anything useful. I guess I could live with having a useless tail.<br />
<br />
Blake asked, &quot;Do you want to have a sleepover?&quot;<br />
<br />
I laughed. A guy doesn&#39;t typically ask a guy to have a sleepover. But I said, &quot;Sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
He put away his notebook. Then he said, &quot;It has probably felt a little unfair being the one always naked while I&#39;m always dressed. But I sleep in the nude so I&#39;m going to get ready for bed now.&quot;<br />
<br />
I was amazed by the size of his cock. He was huge. I must not have ever seen it before because if I&#39;d seen one that huge before, I would have remembered it. It was almost as big as me and definitely fatter than me. His balls were also huge.<br />
<br />
He plugged in some computer games and we played for hours. It was hard to use the controller since the buttons were so far apart to me but Blake kept watching me struggle with the controls instead of watching the game so I frequently won.<br />
<br />
Then we went to bed. He set up a shoe box on his night stand for me to sleep in but before I went to bed, I lay on his pillow next to his head and we talked.</p>
