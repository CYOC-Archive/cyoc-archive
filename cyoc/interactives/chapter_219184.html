<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Will sat on his bed waiting to change back, wearing a bath towel, socks and too tight shoes. It dawned on him that he used his parent&#39;s room and master bathroom to shower, as though he owned the place. He decided he should do a once over to make sure his intrusion isn&#39;t obvious.<br />
<br />
Balancing on the balls of his feet he carefully made his way back to his parents&#39; room, though it still felt like his own. He tidied the bed, grabbed his beer and finished it before realizing what he was doing, wincing when he realized what he just did.<br />
<br />
His parents&#39; room looking better, he went back to his real room, picking out his baggiest outfit he could wear in case his body begins to shift on its own again. It took 20 minutes but eventually his body did start to feel the socks working and after another 10 minutes he was back to his scrawny, short, beardless, natural self. For good measure, he stayed in the shoes for another 5 minutes after he felt the magic transformation stop.<br />
<br />
He hoped the extra time would help he feel normal in his body but even as he were taking the shoes and socks off, his practically hairless arms and legs were jarring to him. Seemingly strange dainty things that have no place being attached to his beefy hairy body, which caused another wave of dysmorphia as he saw his stomach and chest were also hairless and flat. <br />
<br />
Panic began to rise, &#39;All his gains over years of training and football gone in a&#39;... &quot;No... That&#39;s him again.&quot; Will chided his inner monologue sure this weirdness will continue.<br />
<br />
Will grabbed the empty beer can out of his room tossing it into the garbage. He didn&#39;t notice himself idly wishing he could just grab another, turn on a game and relax. He groped at the key ring finding the keys missing before remembering he can&#39;t drive anyway. He shook his head trying to clear the invading thoughts.<br />
<br />
He looked down realizing he had put his normal shoes back on after replacing the magic socks and getting dressed... anticipating more side effects, he can&#39;t wear his main shoes without the socks, and he doesn&#39;t want to just wear the socks any longer than absolutely necessary until he understands what&#39;s happening to him. Begrudgingly he settled on his soccer shoes, they should only be worn at practice but this warrants exception. Currently the soccer shoes aren&#39;t storing a body he should return to so they&#39;re safe to wear.<br />
<br />
Magic socks and normal shoes in a bag to bring with, other shoes on, baggy clothes, wallet, phone, keys, keys? No car keys? A few seconds into searching he mentally kicked himself again and began walking to the store, sending George a text like he promised. <br />
<br />
30 minutes into the walk Will notices his soccer shoes are starting to feel a little tighter but he is only about 10 to 15 minutes from the store. His mind has been racing with how to explain what&#39;s happening, how to ask for help, and how he&#39;ll respond to various responses he gets.<br />
<br />
Entering the shop, Will spots the clerk he met less than a week ago. They were helping another customer and Will waited patiently for the customer to leave, continuing to practice his explanation and the points he wanted to make  sure he discusses.<br />
<br />
The clerk and other customer finished, leaving the store to the two of them. &quot;Hello sir and welcome, is there something I can help you find?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope so,&quot; Will started. &quot;You see, I have an unexpected issue. A few days ago...&quot; Will recounted everything, his first time as his dad 4 days ago, his day with his friends yesterday, the evening of bowling and the mental side effects that began manifesting, waking up this morning believing entirely he was his dad, the slow reversion back to himself, and finally the newest side effect of changing without the socks and absentmindedly drinking his dads beer. Will laid out what he suspected might be the cause. He reiterated that he was already transformed as his dad and tried to become his dad again unknowingly, and he also stayed his dad all day and night with the socks and shoes on. &quot;So, how do I turn back into myself and stay myself?&quot; Will finally finished.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good questions!&quot; The clerk looked at Will hungrily, like he was a fascinating experiment. &quot;Nobody has described a situation similar to yours regarding the socks before, though they probably wouldn&#39;t see it as a problem, most of our clients would probably be happy to take on the attributes of the person they sought to become.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m 15, the problem is my parents are expecting me to remain 15 until I would naturally turn 16.&quot; Will scratched at his chest realizing he had already begun bulking up taking on his father&#39;s football gains. He rubbed his cheek feeling he had stubble. &quot;And I seem to be changing faster than before, it&#39;s only been like an hour and I already look like I belong in college. What should I do?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;My guess is that your body is getting used to the transformation, so its happening faster. As for why its happening in the first place, I have no idea. I&#39;ll have to do some research and get back to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Can&#39;t I just wear my normal shoes with the socks to cancel out turning into my dad?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That could work.&quot; the clerk replied. &quot;Or it could make the unexpected side effects last longer... This might work itself out of your system in a few more hours, but if you wear the socks all day again you may just be setting yourself up to have this issue for the next week. Or, you might still continue to gain your dad&#39;s traits while you&#39;re wearing your shoes, then you won&#39;t have anything to turn you back to normal.&quot; <br />
<br />
Will stared at the man in horror, he hadn&#39;t considered... &quot;Don&#39;t you have some other magic item that will keep me from changing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, yes, but its intended for shapeshifters, and its strongly recommended not to mix magic, especially when its already acting strangely. For example, you wear the socks, turn back into your normal self, I give you an item intended to stabilize your form, but 40 minutes later you realize you are again entering your 20&#39;s. So then you swap your footwear only to find it no longer reverts you to your original form leaving you with only the option of replacing your dad and trying to force him into becoming you permanently. Mixing magic pretty reliably makes things worse.&quot;<br />
<br />
Will visibly paled. &quot;How long will your research take?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It depends on the availability of the wizard or witch who made the socks. They might get back to me today, They might be on vacation for the next month. They might have an answer, if not, I&#39;ll have to ask them about their enchantment which they may or may not share... but if they do, then I&#39;ll have to look into any known side effects and solutions people have found.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you try to reach them now?&quot; Will asked, shifting uncomfortably. He had grown substantially since he last shifted and even his larger clothes weren&#39;t suited for his dads form. &quot;I need to use the socks now or I&#39;m going to ruin my clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
The clerk walked away, returning a moment later with a book, after looking for a moment, &quot;Ah here we go, the magic socks are created by ... alright, I have the number.&quot; They looked at Will and paused watching as his body was mid reversion. A smirk crept onto their face... &quot;It never gets old watching someone become a different person.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It gets old really quick when it shouldn&#39;t be happening in the first place.&quot; Will said perturbed. His reversion completed and he took the socks off as soon as he felt the magic stop. &quot;Hopefully this will be the end of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
The clerk dialed the number and after several long seconds began talking, &quot;Yes, hello. My name is Max. Our store sells one of your products, being socks that change the wearer into the last person that used the shoes being worn. Well, a customer has returned with an unexpected side effect. After using the socks all day they seem to be continuing to transform back into the body they were using, even without the socks being worn. I was hoping this has happened before and there is an easy solution.&quot;</p>
