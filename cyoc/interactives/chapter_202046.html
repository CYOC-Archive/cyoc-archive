<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sasha now desperately found herself searching for Duke with Naomi and Diane now trying to keep up. The castle was a maze, corridors merging into one another with no end in sight. Sasha was growing frantic as she now eyeballed two sets of staircases. &quot;Which way?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sasha hold up,&quot; Naomi called, turning back Sasha now noticed her friends sprinting towards her. Skidding to a stop the couple now found themselves desperately trying to catch their breath. &quot;We don&#39;t have time,&quot; Sasha said quickly. &quot;Dukes in trouble. We have to help him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We know,&quot; Naomi wheezed, the teen now placing her hands on her knees as she tried to catch her breath. &quot;But this place is a maze. It feels like we&#39;ve been running in circles.&quot; Sasha now bit her lip apprehensively, they were right. The group had been running blindly with no end in sight. She needed to calm down, to focus. To rescue Duke she couldn&#39;t just run and hope to find where he was, she needed to think. The only question was how to go about finding him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I have an idea,&quot; Diane stated. &quot;Sasha, do you have anything that Duke has touched?&quot; Sasha paused, glancing down at the corsage on her wrist. Duke had given it to her before they left her house. When the group had returned to the Morelands house to plan, she had changed into something more comfortable  ut had left the corsage on. She wasn&#39;t sure why. Maybe she forgot about it. Maybe she wanted to hold on to something of his. Sadly she now gazed at the flower, wondering if it would be the last gift she would ever receive from Duke. &quot;I have tbis,&quot; she said sadly, holding up her wrist.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perfect no hold still,&quot; Diane stated. Sasha now watched as Diane held her hand over the corsage, mumbling a spell. Sasha cringed slightly, hoping that whatever Diane was doing wouldn&#39;t damage Dukes gift. <br />
<br />
The teenagers now watched as a small purple ball of light floated off the corsage, dangling in the air lazily before moving away. &quot;A location spell,&quot; Diane said quickly. &quot;It&#39;ll take us to Duke. Now hurry!&quot; The teens now chased after tbe orb, dodging down hallways, staircases, and rooms, venturing deeper and deeper into the castles depths. As the trio now descended a stone staircase they could hear voices in the distance. &quot;We&#39;re almost tbere,&quot; Diane whispered. &quot;Keep quiet.&quot; Sasha and Naomi nodded, creeping around the dimly lit dungeon before turning a corner.<br />
<br />
Standing before them, Sasha and her friends could now see four familiar faces. Duke was now chained to a back wall, Wyatt, Kyra, and Cassidy taking turns in assaulting the damphjr teen. Cassidy now grabbed Dukes face, punching him in the mouth before pushing him backwards. &quot;Dont fall asleep now traitor,&quot; she yelled. &quot;I haven&#39;t even begun to punish you yet!&quot; Wyatt and Kyra simply chuckled, watching as the mournful vampire took out her despair on Duke.<br />
<br />
&quot;HEY!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Wyatt, Kyra, and Cassidy paused, turning they now scowled at the three wizards glaring at them. Wyatt now stepped forward, angrily glaring at the intruders. &quot;You dare enter this castle,&quot; he growled. &quot;Leave! This is non of your business. He has to pay for his crimes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Over my dead body,&quot; Sasha snarled back. The vampires now paused in their torture, a sinister smirk crossing their faces as they slowly approached. &quot;That can easily be arranged,&quot; Wyatt grinned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cass,&quot; Naomi now called. &quot;How could you! We trusted you. Treated you kindly! We thought you were our friend!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Friend,&quot; Cassidy replied bitterly. &quot;Foolish girl. I used you. You were so trusting, giving away everything that I needed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So it was all an act,&quot; Diane grumbled. &quot;You just used us. You never cared about anyone!&quot;<br />
<br />
Cassidy&#39;s eyes now narrowed, the teen smoothing out her funeral dress as her eyes now burned with an intense hatred. &quot;The only thing I cared about was taken away from me,&quot; she replied bitterly. &quot;You and your friends destroyed ehF I love most. I care for nothing now, which will make killing you all the easier.&quot; <br />
<br />
Sasha, Naomi, and Diane now tensed, watching as the three vampires now bared their fangs ready to strike. &quot;Sasha,&quot; Naomi stated. &quot;Get Duke. We&#39;ll handle these three.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Handle them,&quot; Diane asked. &quot;How?&quot;<br />
<br />
Naomi now smirked, a mischievous yet brilliant in now sparkled in her eyes. &quot;Fusion,&quot; she exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fusion,&quot; Diane exclaimed. &quot;Are you nuts? We&#39;ve barely practiced that spell. Way too many things could go wrong.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We can do it Diane,&quot; Naomi stated confidently. &quot;Just trust me.&quot; Diane anxiously looked at her girlfriend before sighing. &quot;Okay fine.&quot; Diane now closed her eyes, trying to concentrate before Naomi tapped her on the shoulder. &quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We have to do the fusion dance.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you serious,&quot; Diane exclaimed. &quot;Naomi! Babe! We have three super pissed off  vampires in front of us and you want to do the freaking fusion dance from Dragon ball!&quot;<br />
<br />
Naomi nodded, giving her girlfriend a pleading look. Diane now gazed at the puppy dog pout, her shoulders slumping in defeat as she sighed. &quot;I can&#39;t believe we&#39;re doing this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Naomi now squealed in delight, jumping up and down in excitement as Sasha and the vampires now gazed at the odd couple. Everyone now simply watched the two curiously unable to fathom what the two of them were doing. As the two now synchronized their movements the others simply gazed at them, feeling mortified for the couple as they moved.<br />
<br />
&quot;FU. SION. HA!&quot;<br />
<br />
A brilliant white light now illuminated the dungeon, Sasha and the other shielding their eyes as Naomi and Diane touched fingertips. As quickly as the light appeared, in now vanished. Sasha and the others now curiously gazing at the figure.<br />
<br />
Instead of two teens, their now stood one. The girl appeared to be biracial, half Asian and half white. Long ebony hair now flowed half way down the girls backs her green eyes sparkled with an intensity the was unfamiliar to those that knew Naomi and Diane. The biracial girl now studied herself carefully, noticing her appeared to be in a white gui with golden boots.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow it worked,&quot; she said happily, her voice an odd combination of both Naomi and Diane. &quot;And look at my outfit its so cute. Kinda like the White Queen from Marvel without the cleavage. Although I think our books are bigger than usual.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Naomi? Diane?&quot;<br />
<br />
The biracial girl now turned towards Sasha, raising an eyebrow as she studied her friend. &quot;Oh hey Sashas,&quot; she said. &quot;Sorry, kind if forgot about you for a sec.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Better than okay,&quot; she said happily. &quot;But, I&#39;m not Naomi anymore or even Diane. I&#39;m a combination of them. Their magic hasn&#39;t been been combined its multiplied, making me the ultimate wizard.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um what should I call you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm,&quot; she said rubbing her chin. &quot;I need a really cool name if I going to impress everyone. Domi? No. Super Sorceress? Ugh pass. Oh I know! Niane!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can someone explain what the hell is going,&quot; Kyra exclaimed. Niane paused in her musings, a confident smirk spreading across her face. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fusion spell&quot; Niane grinned. &quot;You see Naomi and Diane may not have had the power to take you on but I do!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please,&quot; Cassidy scoffed. &quot;A light show and an embarrassing dance hardly poses a threat. I am a member of the Five and I can....&quot;<br />
<br />
Cassidy was unable to finish as Niane now teleported in front of the vampire, delivering a thunderous round house kick that sent her sailing through a nearby wall. Wyatt and Kyra now gawked at the smirking Niane as she struck a pose.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh and I also know kung fu now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wyatt and Kyra now lunged for the combined wizard, trying to strike her down as she now dodged before counterattacking. &quot;Sasha,&quot; Niane yelled. &quot;Get Duke, I can hold them off.&quot; Sasha simply nodded, sprinting towards her boyfriend as Niane continued to fight. It appeared that despite Naomi&#39;s eccentricities she was truely a wizard that Sasha was able to count upon as a friend.</p>
