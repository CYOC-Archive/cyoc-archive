<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
After piling his tray with food, Jake sat down and began wolfing his lunch down. His growing body demanded nutrition and Jake was more than happy to fuel his growth. As he ravenously ate his food he felt amazing, like each of his muscles was being fed after a long fast. Each time he bent his arm to <br />
 lift his fork to his mouth he could feel his bicep mound up a little higher. Jake was snapped back to reality when he felt his fork hit the hard plastic of his tray. He was out of food, but he was still hungry. Hungry for more muscle. More size. <br />
<br />
So Jake went back for seconds and loaded not just one tray but two with more food and returned to his seat, noticing the increased tightness in his jeans around his powerful thighs and particularly around his butt. No sooner than he had sat down did Jake dive into his twin mountains of food, and the feeling in his muscles quickly returned. He looked down at his tray as he ate but noticed his swelling pecs taking up more of his field of vision. Not only that, but his tray was getting lower and lower as his torso lengthened. <br />
<br />
It was about halfway through his first tray of food that Jake felt his pants start to get tight, but  Jake didn&#39;t think much of it, too lost in the bliss of growing with every bite. &quot;Gotta make room for more fuel,&quot; he thought as he absentmindedly unbuttoned his pants. <br />
<br />
He plowed through the rest of his first tray of food, not even noticing the students to his left and right scooting away from him to make more room for his widening shoulders. Not only were his delts packing on mass, but his frame itself was reforming itself, becoming broader. Jake then started to dig into his second tray of food and not long after that he had to move his chair away from the table to make room for his growing gut. His previously narrow wasp waist was quickly being replaced by a thick pillar of bulk as his waist and hips broadened. <br />
<br />
Jake however was too distracted by his swelling arms and pecs to notice anything else. A bit of food dropped from his fork shy of his mouth and he grinned to himself when he noticed his pec shelf had caught the bit of fallen food. He smiled even wider when he felt the way his biceps and pecs  had to fight for room in order for him to reach his chest to wipe his skin-tight shirt off. Jake&#39;s shoulders continued to grow wider and his traps pushed higher around his thick, column-like neck. <br />
<br />
As Jake finished his last bite of food, he heard a soft ripping sound followed by relief. He looked down and realized that his last bite of food gave his pecs the last little push they needed to  finally rip through his shirt. He also realized in the same moment just how constricted he was by his too small shirt. The jacket however, strangely, seemed to fit him just right. But as he inspected his clothes for rips he finally noticed not just how much muscle he&#39;d put on, but how much he had truly bulked up. <br />
<br />
In a panic Jake shot to his feet and heard another loud rip as his pants ripped down the rear and down the thighs, no longer able to contain his mass. Embarrassed, but mostly curious, Jake made a beeline to the bathroom to see just what happened.<br />
<br />
Once in the bathroom, Jake pulled off his jacket and tried to take off his t-shirt underneath but the simple act of reaching to pull it off ripped it beyond hope of repair, so Jake ripped it off. After that he peeled what was left of his pants off his legs and returned his gaze to the mirror.<br />
<br />
Jake&#39;s eyes bulged like dinner plates as he took in his body for the first time since sitting down to eat. Gone was the lean, cut fitness model physique he had walked into the cafeteria with. In its place was a broad, powerful body built like a tank to withstand the hardest tackles and plays on the football field. The jacket was turning him into the football team&#39;s new linebacker. No longer ripped and vascular, his body had some fat padding it out all over, but it exuded raw strength and power. He guessed his height had increased to about 5&#39;10&quot;. His face had rounded out slightly from the extra fat, but he could still tell his features had gotten a little more handsome while retaining a teenage youthfulness. His neck was as wide as his head, and was flanked on either side by rounded traps that led to cannonball-like delts. his upper arms hung at an angle from his body, pushed up as his triceps and lats fought for space. Power, corded forearms connected to massive hands that were made to palm a football. His pecs mounded round like globes as he flexed them. As his eyes wandered down he frowned slightly when he noticed he could no longer see his abs on his broad waist, but he quickly shrugged it off. The extra bulk just added to the sense of power his new body possessed. His tree trunk-like thighs forced his stance apart due to their girth. His feet were cramped and ready to burst out of his shoes as well.<br />
<br />
After he was done admiring himself, Jake grabbed his jacket and headed to the lost and found to replace his ripped clothes. There wasn&#39;t much of a selection for him seeing how few high schoolers were anywhere near his size, much less any freshmen. Eventually he found an XXL gym shirt that hugged his torso and some basketball shorts with an elastic waistband that, despite its stretchiness, almost didn&#39;t hold up to his muscle gut.<br />
<br />
After donning his new clothes, Jake went to put on his jacket and was surprised to find</p>
