<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jack had not been feeling well. Ever since he first started taking hormone supplements for a better body he had been feeling more lethargic and horny. For the past three days he had been having a hard time getting up in the morning and finishing his work for his college classes. So Jack thought it best to stop taking the hormone pills and go back to his previous daily rituals. Finally he could consume dairy again, for the pills called for no consumption of dairy whilst taking the drug. Upon that night of deciding to quite, Jack thought it a grand idea to spend it watching TV alone in his apartment and eating cheeseburgers and milk for fun. About three hours in though, Jack became extremely drowsy. It didn’t take long after that for him to pass out on the couch. <br />
At some point in the middle of night Jack was awoken by a very constricted sensation. Upon investigation, Jack was astonished to find that his shirt no longer fit him, for it appeared he had gained about a hundred pounds in his gut area while sleeping, not to mention the huge pecs he was now sporting as well. It’s a wonder the shirt held up anyways, his now recently acquired flab was bursting through the bottom of the shirt and his suspiciously larger nipples could have poked holes in the material at any moment. After removing the shirt, Jack was still unfathomably tired; so he decided to think about everything in the morning when he had at least a little energy to get up because he just couldn’t fight the idea of rest.<br />
Yet not an hour later, Jack was again awoken, only this time it was his bottom half that was tight in his pants. It appeared after removing his jeans that his legs were now significantly thicker like his upper half. His genitalia was also larger than usual, seeming to almost double in size. Now fully awake, scared, and thirsty, Jack sat for a while naked trying to decide what was going on and what to do. Taking a couple large swigs from the gallon of milk left on the floor, he choose to first go piss and then call the hospital. It was different for him to urinate for he now had a thick 12 inch dick and he figured he could fill a bathtub with the amount of piss he was releasing.<br />
 When he finished, Jack washed his hands and made to regretful decision to look up into the mirror. Looking hard at his reflection, Jack found he had a full grown black beard stretching from his ears all the way down his neck to upper chest. But that wasn’t the most astonishing part, atop his head sprouted two little nubs out of his blond hair. At this point Jack became so freaked out by what was happening he returned back to the toilet to vomit. “What am I goanna do?” he thought, “No one is going to understand how horns are growing out of my head!” <br />
It was at that moment he than realized his hands were tuning black and getting stiff. Painfully jumping up, he watched his feet do the same, only his toes were fussing together and looking shinny. Jack ran back to the couch because at this point it was hard enough standing while his toes were merging into what fearfully appeared to be hooves, big black hooves. As Jack watched this all go down he couldn’t help but drink more milk for he was still drastically thirsty. At some point though he hand to drop the nearly empty milk gallon down for he was too busy moaning at his now hooved hands.<br />
His hands changed at such an incontinent moment because now Jack had become immensely itchy. Rubbing his fuzzy neck with his hard hooves, he watched as his flabby chest became fuzzy with thick black hairs right before his eyes. At this point Jack was too startled to even be squeamish of the changes. All he knew is that he had horns, hooves, a significant amount of body hair, and a slowly increasing weight in his body. Concerned to see what else was happening, Jack heftily got up and slowly moved for the bathroom mirror. It was difficult because he now had a lot more weight that before plus the fact his feet were now hooves that clopped and slid across the wood floor. <br />
When he finally got the mirror, having fallen several times, Jack discovered his horns were now a lot larger and he was hairy. His once blond and graceful hair was coarse and black as night.  It seemed like his whole body was fuzzy with hair. Jack lifted his arms to find his armpits not only extremely bushy with black hair, but very slick with sweat. It was mistake to lift his arms in the first place, because now the whole room smelled not of B.O., but of some strange stringent musky scent. After a few minutes of examining his body and watching it get coated in black hair, jack experienced a pain more extreme than anything he has ever gone through. Screaming noises that strangely ended in long deep sounding O’s, It was his arms and legs that started to extend and shape into something else. When it was finally finished, Jack remained laying on the ground moaning as he listened and felt his joints snap. Jack tried to stand up then, but found he couldn’t due to his joints and now great weight. So he sadly compromised and stood on all fours, realizing it was easier now on his hooves. The sensation was strange for he felt the open air rush against his ass hole, which was pushing father out each second. Jack knew now there was no getting help, who would save someone turning into an animal? Looking down his furry black belly he watched as now massive leathery balls swayed back and forth and his dick merged in a sheath with his underside, which felt hot and wet. His coarse beard rubbed against his very short neck.<br />
 Jack began to heavily huff out air through his nose and mouth. “MMAAAOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!” Jack exclaimed as he felt a sharp pinch right on his ass hole. Turning his head around his heft as best he could, he saw that the flies from his garbage can had smelled their way to his anus and were accumulating. Uncontrollably, the upper part of Jack’s ass began to twitch with he could only assume to be an upcoming tail. Panicking his heavy breathing increased rapidly, followed by a massive gurgling sensation in his belly. Jack tried to move of his hooves to find it had to hold his balance with his weight sagging and swaying under him, especially his cannon ball testicals which were almost reaching the ground. “MOOOO!” Jack uncontrollably burst. “MOOOOOO! MOOOOO!” There was no stopping him. Through his series of “mooing” he could feel something slither out from above his ass and his insides tense up. “MOOOO! MOOOOOO!” Jack looked down again the see a small tuff of black hair hang from behind his balls. “GOD DAM I GOT A TAIL!”, he thought to himself through his mooing. His new tail whipped around with a mind of its own, hitting the still lingering and biting flies. Finally his insides tensed up so much that Jack had to release. The swaying tail shot straight up and what Jack then knew as hot steaming bull shit rolled out his exposed anus and pilled on the floor. He felt grossed out and also immensely relived as his tail began to rub the shit around his ass hole and in is ass hair around. Jack felt displeased that he now had to live with a huge, dirty, hairy ass and no way to escape. Every day he must shit with only his tail swishing around. As Jack stood there and thought about this life he then owned, the scent of his manure filled the room to his displeasure as the flies remained around his smelly behind. With each smell, Jack’s nostrils grew larger and flatter. His horns extended a little more and his faced gradually pushed out to that of a muzzle. It was only a few moments later Jack pissed yet again and fell asleep on the spot with no idea what he was to do when he woke up, If he still was in his right mind.</p>
