<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><Br>Once David and Buzz were done eating, they cleaned their mouths with a pair of white, cloth napkins. Satisfied, the two looked at each other and David, being a very inquisitive person, looked as if he wanted to jump off of his seat and go find that secret room. Buzz, finding David's actions amusing, just smiled.</Br>
<Br>"My! You really are in the mood to do some exploring!"</Br>
<Br>"Yeah I am! The thought of secret rooms and passage ways really excite me. So... where do we begin?"</Br>
<Br>"To be completely honest, we have to go back to your room, which is the master bedroom suite that your parents once shared."</Br>
<Br>"My room...? Why my room, there isn't anything special in there... or is there?"</Br>
<Br>"Oh there is and I am sure you are even more excited. I know you haven't been here too long and so I guess I never really expected you to even find the thing."</Br>
<Br>"Yes, I am super excited to go now! What secret does my room hide... the other room? OOH... I know, it must hold the passage to the secret room... right?"</Br>
<Br>Buzz just chuckled. "Yes, you are right David. Your room is the entrance to the hall that leads to the secret room."</Br>
<Br>"Whoo, I knew it, I knew it! Let's go!"</Br>
<Br>Before Buzz even had the chance to say "Ok." David was off in a flash and bolted for his bedroom door. Not feeling as though there was a major rush, Buzz took his time walking to David's room. Besides, Buzz knew that David would probably like an opportunity to try and find the door to the secret passage on his own.</Br>
<Br><Center>***</Center></Br>
<Br>Meanwhile, David was back in his room, sitting on the edge of his four post bed and studied the room in great detail. David knew that secret passage entries were usually hidden in plain sight and would cause someone who didn't know where it was to smack themselves on the forehead for not seeing it themselves when someone who did know it's location revealed it. Curiously, David rose to his feet and studied the nearby bookcases, as that was a typical entrance to secret passages and rooms, but found that the bookshelving was one solid piece. Dismayed, David sat back down on his bed and pondered further. Then, David thought that the entrance could be hidden by the large grandfather clock like was done in "Batman", but when he studied up close, that turned up empty as well. Thinking that his options were exhausted, David went to pick up the phone to call Buzz and see how long he was going to be since David was becoming impatient. When David went to pick up the phone, he noticed something peculiar about one of the posts on the bed that he hadn't noticed earlier. From a distance, it was unrecognizable as anything out of the ordinary other than a scratch in the wood. However, upon close investigation, David realized that it was a slot that was the same size as a Minnesota Driver's License. Curious, David opened his wallet and took out his driver's license. Thinking it was all coincidental, David put the license in the slot and then a man's voice came over the Bose Wave Radio next to his bed on the right side.</Br>
<Br><Center><I>Identification Confirmed. Access to the lab is granted Mr. Wolfe. Have a good day experimenting</I></Center></Br>
<Br>As the voice stopped speaking, David could hear the secret door open and he jumped to his feet to investigate where, since it was not right in front of him as he had expected. When David went exploring, he walked up to the bathroom door, since that was closed and the sound was a bit muffled. He didn't think the door could be there, but that was the only place he really hadn't looked. When David opened the door, his eyes went wide and he instantly wanted to jump for joy but refrained to keep his composure. There, at the other end of the bathroom was the now opened door frame that was still somewhat hidden. Odd as it was, it was inside of the full body shower, with the right edge starting at one of the glass cube walls that David thought was there just for privacy. Wanting to go in, but also thinking it would be best for Buzz to accompany him, David stood his ground at the frame of the entrance to the bathroom. Thankfully, David didn't have to wait too long since Buzz walked into the room silently right as David opened the door to the bathroom in the first place. Wanting to alert David to his presence, Buzz placed his massive right hand on David's shoulder and David jumped from the unexpected startlement.</Br>
<Br>"Jeeze Buzz, why did ya have to go and sneak up on someone like that huh?"</Br>
<Br>Laughing hysterically, Buzz had to stop in order to speak and refrain from hurting his diaphragm so much from laughing so hard. "Oh man David, I am sorry for laughing at you. It was just too much, but I do see that you found your family's secret room."</Br>
<Br>"Yeah I did, but I never thought of my parents to be much for scientists, let alone performing experiments."</Br>
<Br>"No David... they weren't and what gives you an idea like that?"</Br>
<Br>"Well for starters, there must be a computer system in the secret room because there is a scanner in the bed post that accepted my personal identification card. Then, once it was accepted, a male's voice spoke from the radio and told me to enjoy my day experimenting. That, in my opinion, would sum it all up."</Br>
<Br>"Yes, I guess that would do it for me as well! So, how about we go and check it all out?"</Br>
<Br>David nodded and walked into the bathroom with Buzz following close behind. Once they were through the secret door, it closed behind them and then a door not too far off in the distance opened. Not knowing how or why, the duo just kept walking, then entered the secret room. Once they were both completely inside, the same male voice spoke again.</Br>
<Br><Center><I>Welcome young Mr. Wolfe, you have been expected for some time now. I know what you are wondering and to answer your question before you ask, I am your parent's artificial intelligence system which helped in computating all of their experiments. In fact, your father recorded a message for you right before he died which I will play for you now.</I></Center></Br>
<Br>Surprised by all of this, the two just stood there and watched the large screen inside of the lab. Suddenly, David's father's face appeared on screen and began speaking.</Br>
<Br>"David, my son, if you are watching this then we have perished and you have inherited our estate. This was to be expected, especially after your mother and I accidentally created the virus that swept over the mansion like the plague. Your mother and I got this mansion from our endeavors at a company called Biotech. You were told that we just won the lottery and built this place. In fact, Biotech is a company that is owned by the United States Military and we were hired to research all known diseases that are employed by terroristic groups. One day, when we received orders to create a pathogen to wipe out groups of people, we accidentally created a new virus. As for what it does, we do not know entirely. All that we could figure out was it placed a separate set of genetic sequencing markers in the DNA of those who survived the genetic altering. We gave this place to you and instructions for Buzz to show it to you in the hopes that you would be able to figure out exactly what we created. HANK, our personal AI will be able to scan the both of you over and see if there has been any development to come to a conclusion. Son, we hope you enjoy life in our estate and that you can find out what we were unable to."</Br>
<Br>As soon as the message concluded, the screen went blank for a second and then HANK's face appeared on the screen.</Br>
<Br><Center><I>Now, if the two of you could lay on the table, one at a time, I could scan your DNA and see if the work your parent's mistakenly made has developed anything.</I></Center></Br>
<Br>Not really knowing anything or even expecting all of this, the two just shrugged their shoulders and walked over to the table. Since David was the new owner, he went first and laid flat on his back against the cool metal table. When he was in position, a thin and wide green light swept over his body from top to bottom, then bottom to top. When the scan was over, Buzz did the same and once his was done, the two stood back at the original screen.</Br>
<Br><Center><I>Well... it does look like things have manifested themselves in the both of you after all!</I></Center></Br>
<Br>On the screen, HANK displayed four separate three dimensional single line representations of their bodies. One was in their current state and the one beside looked like a cross between human and animal. In fact, David's looked like a wolf and Buzz's looked like a bear.</Br>
<Br>"Buzz... what do you think this means?"</Br>
<Br>"Man David, your guess is as good as mine is. You are the offspring of two military scientists... wouldn't it be safe to assume that you would know better than I?"</Br>
<Br>"Yeah, I suppose you are right, but I haven't the foggiest clue myself..."</Br>
<Br><Center><I>If I may interject... David Wolfe, what you see before you is what your genetic sequencing states. Apparently, your parent's made a 'were' virus. David, your genetic sequencing states that you are a Lupus Domesticus Humanis or Werewolf. Buzz, your DNA states that you are a Ursanus Domesticus Humanis or Werebear. Also, by checking your genetic sequencing, you will transform into these creatures within the next couple of days. Congratulations are in order I do believe, since you both are what science has been trying to do for years. A perfect blending of human and animal. Shall I notify the military about the results or should I wait?</I></Center></Br>
<Br>"Hank... why don't you wait so that we can see how things will turn out for the both of us. This is a lot of information for us to process and we should test ourselves once we have transformed to see how useful we will be to the United States Military."</Br>
<Br><Center><I>As you wish David. I will let you both out to go about your lives and once you have transformed, you both should come back here for a thorough examination and testing.</I></Center></Br>
<Br>As Hank turned himself off, so to speak, the door opened to let the duo out. Not wanting to cause suspicion, the two walked out of the room and the secret passage as calmly as they did when they entered. David then walked over to the bed and pulled out his identification, which sealed the door to the passage closed again.</Br>
<Br>"Man oh man, I cannot believe this stuff. Your parents created a 'were' virus? Do you really think that we are going to transform like HANK stated?"</Br>
<Br>"I know, I cannot believe it either! To think I am going to be a werewolf and you a werebear... this is awesome!"</Br>
<Br>Confused, Buzz's eyebrow furled. "What do you mean? We are freaks now... not to mention the other staff members. How do you think they are going to handle this?"</Br>
<Br>"To be honest Buzz, I have always thought of a werewolf to be the coolest movie monster around. In fact, I have always wondered what it would be like to be one. Don't you think that being a mix of animal and human is for the best. I mean think about it... higher senses, the physical heightening, the increased virility and the higher libido!"</Br>
<Br>"Yeah, I guess you are right. It would be nice to feel like a real man again, especially since I have recently lost the ability to perform like I once did in bed."</Br>
<Br>"See... there you go! In time, we will really see how this is going to turn out for us. We will have to have a meeting with the rest of the staff so that they are aware of what may happen to them soon."</Br>
<Br>Knowing that David was right, Buzz got on his phone and called the heads of each staff area. There were a few staff members that were there. The older man that Buzz had referred to died a day before David's arrival and the only ones that were left were Buzz the butler; Rick and Mike the cooks; Bill and Cassie the cleaning staff; Gus, Luke and Ron the gardeners; Ben, George and Jeff the security guards. Within that hour, everyone got together in the study and library area, where they were all told of what would happen to David and Buzz at some point as well as what could happen to all of them at some point. As expected, people had mixed feelings, but they all felt that it was out of their hands and whatever happened, happened. Little did any of them know, everyone was about to transform into their other selves not too long from then... but when?</Br></p>
