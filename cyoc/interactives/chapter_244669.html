<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Linda Michaels stood straight and tall with her hands placed firmly behind her back. Despite the recent actions of Fukushu, the Superior Church was still functioning normally. Having secured their newest headquarters, they now found themselves conducting an important operation in Old Town Maine.<br />
<br />
&quot;All units, come to a stop outside the forest.&quot; Linda said into her microphone to her soldiers, which included Seraphim.<br />
<br />
The soldiers did as instructed, stopping a far enough distance outside of the last known location that of the call that they had traced from Lilith Kane. The Superior Church soldiers all got out on foot and proceeded with caution.<br />
<br />
&quot;Be on your guard for any trail cameras, trip wires, or anything that may alert Moreland and the others to your presence.&quot; Linda instructed them all as she waited for responses.<br />
<br />
&quot;Trail cam spotted, preparing to neutralize.&quot; A soldier responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Another trail cam spotted on the south west side, preparing to neutralize.&quot; Another soldier said through their communications.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stand-by, found a tripwire, looks like it leads to an alarm.&quot; A soldier said as they began to disarm it.<br />
<br />
Linda&#39;s face slowly began smiling as more and more of the alarms were taken down. Linda knew Connor Moreland was smart, but probably not as smart as his father.<br />
<br />
Ten minutes of painstakingly slow progress found the soldiers securing the perimeter. Disabling the last of security measures before they slowly and quietly moved in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now all of you, incapacitate the werewolves, there should be a daughter and mother. Tranquilize them both and make sure they have a good night&#39;s sleep.&quot; Linda said as she now waited for things to play out.<br />
<br />
****************************************<br />
<br />
&quot;Rebecca, can you please go check the mailbox? I forgot yesterday.&quot; Eliana asked her daughter as she rolled her eyes getting up to go outside to their mailbox, which was several feet from the house.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I just hope the bill hasn&#39;t gone up again.&quot; Eliana sighed as Lilith put a hand on her friend&#39;s shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, don&#39;t worry, we made enough at our job and this week and we&#39;ll...&quot; Lilith began to say before she looked to see outside that Rebecca looked like she was walking funny before she fell on her knees, then fell down on the ground with her face forward.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god, REBECCA!&quot; Eliana shouted as she ran outside towards her daughter.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, wait! Eliana don&#39;t, it could be....!&quot; Connor tried to call out to Eliana who rushed over in her werewolf form and grabbed her daughter and began to pull her inside, but before they could get up to the porch, she was hit with several tranquilizer darts and fainted on the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn it. Lilith, Alyssa, stay inside. Do you hear me? Stay inside.&quot; Connor ordered. Quickly Connor grabbed his rifle carefully attaching sniper scope as quickly as he could. Connor now took a secured position, cracking the front door to survey the forest. Cursing under his breath, he now wished Charlotte or Miles were here. They were better with a sniper rifle than he was.<br />
<br />
He pointed the window towards the woods looking carefully through the scope as Lilith and Alyssa watched quietly. It didn&#39;t seem anything was going to happen, until Connor suddenly pulled the trigger letting out a shot as Alyssa jumped in fear into her mother&#39;s arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, are Becca and her mom alright?&quot; Alyssa asked a little worriedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;ll.....they&#39;ll be fine honey, we just....we just have to wait this out.&quot; Lilith said trying to act brave, but Lilith was beginning to fear for herself and her daughter more than anything in the moment.<br />
<br />
Connor then let out another shot startling Alyssa.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish grandma was here!&quot; Alyssa said crying into her mother&#39;s arms.<br />
<br />
Lilith held her daughter closely to her trying to best to comfort her. Just as Connor took did another shot, at the same time, there was a loud bang at their back door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit, they&#39;re coming in through the back now. Alyssa be ready.&quot; Lilith said to her daughter.<br />
<br />
&quot;But....but....&quot; Alyssa tried to say sounding scared.<br />
<br />
&quot;Grandma wouldn&#39;t want you to be afraid.&quot; Lilith said as Alyssa composed herself, took a deep breath and nodded. Now both mother and daughter transformed into their Solar Guardian Pluto, and Solar Guardian Saturn forms respectively and began fighting the Superior Church soldiers. Lilith and Alyssa had not been slacking on their training with each other. Lilith was now more than experienced with her staff while Alyssa was well trained with her Saturn ring discs. There seemed to be more coming inside, and Lilith didn&#39;t want the inside of their home ruined again and decided to take the fight outside.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell? Lilith, I told you to stay inside! LILITH!&quot; Connor shouted at Lilith who couldn&#39;t reply as Lilith and Alyssa were currently engaged in their own fight while Connor suddenly heard a bullet whiz by him and realized that someone was now trying to shoot at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, hell no, you are not doing that to this Moreland. You assholes are kindergartners compared to the Amberhills!&quot; Connor shouted in a taunt to the soldiers.<br />
<br />
The Superior Church soldiers obviously took offense to that and shot back as Connor now got to cover and prepared to shoot the soldiers at certain times when he thought it was safe.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile out back, Lilith and Alyssa were doing their best at taking out the Superior Church soldiers that were coming after them. Lilith was glad she had insisted the two of them practice as much as they could should anything happen to them after the whole Amberhill incident.<br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t look like another soldier was going to come towards them, until a blur suddenly shot towards Lilith knocking her to the ground as she used her staff to try and block off what had hit her and realized that it was the Seraphim, her sister!<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait! Listen to me, you don&#39;t have to fight us! We&#39;re family.&quot; Lilith tried to tell Seraphim who ignored her as Lilith pushed her off and Sophie steadied herself from falling and rushed towards the two of them as she now fought between both Lilith and Alyssa.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please! Listen to what we&#39;re saying, you&#39;re part of our family. You&#39;re name is Sophie Kane, not Seraphim.&quot; Alyssa tried saying to Sophie as she held Alyssa&#39;s hands and pushed her down onto the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up! You&#39;re both just lying to me!&quot; Seraphim shouted as Alyssa not believing what she was saying.<br />
<br />
Lilith now pushed Sophie off of Alyssa and began fighting her with her staff as Seraphim/Sophie grabbed a baton off a soldier and began fighting Lilith with it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aunt Sophie, please!&quot; Alyssa tried to say to Seraphim.<br />
<br />
&quot;I AM NOT YOUR GOD DAMNED FUCKING AUNT!&quot; Seraphim shouted as Alyssa looked hurt by this and suddenly had a thought as she ran in to her home.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alyssa! What are you doing?!&quot; Lilith shouted to her daughter as Seraphim/Sophie used this opportunity to smack Lilith hard across the face. Lilith kept up her stance as best as she could, but while Lilith might have had the powers of a Solar Guardian, she was still vulnerable to some strong attacks.<br />
<br />
Lilith and Seraphim fought each other until both were badly bruised and breathing heavily. Seraphim now rushed towards Lilith and grabbed her by the throat hard and began to hit her right in the face and much as she could. Lilith held out for as long as she could, but even she would say, she was beginning to feel tired.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lucky for you, my mother wants you alive.&quot; Seraphim said as she raised her hand and was about to hit Lilith in the face.<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s not your mother!&quot; Alyssa shouted towards Seraphim holding out a picture towards her. Lilith recognized it as a picture of Sophie from when she was young holding her as an infant. It had come from the photo album that Alyssa had brought with her from the past.<br />
<br />
&quot;In 2009, you were 7 years old when a teenage girl came knocking on your house. You politely asked your mother to invite her in because you thought she was really nice. I was that teenage girl.&quot; Alyssa said slowly stepping towards Seraphim who looked like she was trying to recall what Alyssa was talking about.<br />
<br />
&quot;You had only a few months before become a big sister to a new baby sister. The girl in the picture is you, and the baby in the photograph is my mom, Lilith, the one on the ground. You gave her that name because you thought it sounded cooler than what your own mother had given her. You&#39;re not the Seraphim, you never were. Your real name is Sophie. Sophie Elizabeth Kane, and you&#39;re my aunt. Please....believe me Aunt Sophie.&quot; Alyssa begged Sophie with tears falling down her cheek.<br />
<br />
&#39;Seraphim, she&#39;s creating a falsehood for you. Do not believe it.&#39; Linda Michaels said through Seraphim&#39;s earpiece.<br />
<br />
Seraphim hesitated now as she looked at both Lilith and Alyssa.<br />
<br />
&#39;Seraphim, neutralize and bring them both in, that&#39;s an order. Listen to your mother.&#39; Linda said as Seraphim&#39;s posture seemed to change at that last sentence.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, mother.&quot; Seraphim said as used tasers to knock them down, before using tranquilizers on both of them. The picture Alyssa had been holding fell to the ground and Seraphim picked it up and examined it. The young girl in the picture did resemble her when she was very young. Seraphim wondered if the girl had really made up the story just to deceive her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hold it!&quot; Connor Moreland shouted holding up his rifle towards Seraphim.<br />
<br />
&quot;I took out your guys up front, but I&#39;m pretty sure there&#39;s more.&quot; Connor said.<br />
<br />
&quot;There is, however....&quot; Seraphim said as she then dashed over towards Connor dodging his shots and slid her legs beneath Connor&#39;s making him fall on the ground right onto his artificial hip and before he had a chance to grab his weapon, Seraphim threw it out of his reach. Before Connor could stand, three more soldiers rushed forward, leveling their rifles at the hunter. Connor was effectively neutralized as he raised his hands.<br />
<br />
&#39;Seraphim, let me talk to him.&#39; Linda said as Seraphim now got out a phone and put a facetime call on for Linda Michaels, she then pointed the phone towards Connor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello there Connor Moreland, Linda Michaels, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve heard of me. I knew your father too. He was one of my idols when I was a young hunter, but....he disappointed me in the end. I&#39;m sure he&#39;d be disappointed if he could see you now, on the ground like this. Before I go, pass on this message to Archbishop Castignoli: God abandoned you for his true chosen follower of his ways, me. Seraphim, knock him out.&#39; Linda said as Seraphim now kicked Connor unconscious as he lay on the ground.<br />
<br />
&#39;Grab the women and get out of there before reinforcements come. I don&#39;t doubt that kitsune could be far behind either.&#39; Linda Michaels said before hanging up.<br />
<br />
Seraphim looked closely at Lilith and Alyssa. She could very much see a resemblance to the two of them and herself. Did she actually have some kind of connection with these two? All she knew at the moment, was that she had a job to finish and these two were to be brought to her mother.</p>
