<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">They found a table on a deck of the bar overlooking the course in the shade with a gentle breeze cooling them. They enjoyed a couple of Canadian Clubs then Alicia bought back a menu with a second round of drinks. As Alicia’s anti leering technique had worked once more and Henry was actually feeling comfortable they ended up deciding to stay there for an early dinner. <br />
<br />
By now Henry was totally unconcerned that anyone would recognise him a man in drag. That was unless he opened his mouth. <br />
After ordering for both of them while waiting for their meals, Alicia excused herself and headed to the ladies. Henry just sat there admiring the view.<br />
<br />
Alicia returned, Henry appreciating how she had tidied herself up. She sat down and quietly told Henry. “I realise I should have taken you with me. A real woman doesn’t enjoy looking windblown. Take your bag, go to the toilets and fix yourself up. There’s a brush and lipstick inside”<br />
<br />
So Henry picked up his new handbag and headed to the toilets, remembering in the nick of time to go to the ladies not the gents.<br />
He needed to pee but as one of the two stalls was occupied he decided it was safest to sit down, knowing that if he peed in his normal way the sound would not be right. Just as well as the sound of someone using toilet paper came from next door almost as soon as his flow started. <br />
<br />
After finishing his business he washed his hands and once more looked at his reflection. A pretty young woman was looking back at him. It was almost impossible to believe that was his reflection. He also saw his wig was a mess, looking very windblown. Heeding Alicia’s advice he found the brush and styled it much as she had this morning. Satisfied with that result he attempted to touch up his lipstick as Alicia had suggested. He made sure to use the lighter pink shade she had applied to his lips before lunch rather than the alternative, a dark almost brown shade. <br />
<br />
Upon leaving the toilet Henry almost bumped into Alex the golf pro, leaving the men’s. <br />
<br />
Henry must have looked alarmed.<br />
<br />
“Oh Rachel!” he remembered Henry’s pretend name “Sorry to startle you. How did your round go?”<br />
<br />
Henry couldn’t talk. He made a high pitched ‘ioor’ sound in the back of his throat. Gave Alex a sheepish smile and pointed towards where Alicia was sitting. Henry hoped Alex would take the hint that he had to get back to Alicia.<br />
<br />
But when Alex replied “Oh I see Alicia over there, I might join you. I’m finished for the day. Alicia can fill me in on your round” Henry could have died. He trudged back over to the table with Alex hot on his heels.<br />
<br />
Their meals arrived at the table at about the same time as Henry and Alex. Alex took the seat beside Alicia and ask the waitress, who evidently knew him, to bring over 3 more Canadian Clubs. He had observed what ‘Rachel’ and Alicia were drinking.<br />
<br />
Henry, realising he was trapped, at least until he had finished his meal had to sit there silently as Alex brazenly flirted with his new wife. To make it worse Alicia graciously accepted the drink Alex had bought and giggled at his jokes. At least she told Alex “Rachel beat me by 6 strokes” when he questioned how the golf had gone.<br />
<br />
Alex did not let the large rock on Alicia’s finger bother his attempted seduction. Alicia had caught his eye on that first morning of golf, she was exactly his type. And now that dweeb of a husband of hers was out of the way, it was his chance. The sister might be a problem, she was a looker as well, but he wasn’t getting good vibes from her.<br />
<br />
They chatted away. Alicia was from the mainland and had obviously married for the dweeb’s money. Evidently he was CEO of some company. <br />
<br />
Henry couldn’t believe Alicia would say “Henry my new husband, had to fly out for some urgent business meeting. He’ll be back on Saturday and then we fly home on Sunday” That was as good as saying. ‘My husband has left me on my honeymoon. He won’t be back until the weekend’<br />
<br />
However all he could do was sit there and take it. He had to pretend to be Alicia’s mute little sister.<br />
<br />
Now Alex was ramping things up “If you like I could show you a few magical spots only we locals know about. Are you busy tomorrow?”<br />
<br />
“Sounds good. We had nothing particular in mind. But Rachel is with me. We come as a pair”<br />
<br />
That was enough for Henry. He had finished his meal. Even though Alicia’s was only half eaten, Henry decided they were leaving. He made his high-pitched, mute girl sound ‘Ioooiea!” and tapped his wrist. Then pointed back to towards their suite.<br />
 <br />
That got Alicia’s attention. She glanced across at him with an annoyed look. Then turned to Alex. “I have to get Rachel back to our room. She needs her meds” <br />
<br />
“So are we on for tomorrow?”<br />
<br />
“Both of us?”<br />
<br />
“Yes. Both of you. I knock off at 1 on Thursday. How about I meet you here for lunch then we can set off” That made it harder for Alex but was better than nothing. It sounded like Rachel was not only dumb but possible psychotic. However, he gave the sister another look. She was certainly well built and had the same gorgeous face as her big sister.<br />
<br />
Henry by now had stood up and was making more of his mute girl noises. “1 pm here” Alicia acknowledged, as ‘Rachel’ tugged her arm. <br />
“I’ll be here a while longer if you want to come back after taking care of Rachel” Alex called to Alicia as Henry dragged her towards the door. Henry didn’t notice the ‘Thumbs up” Alicia gave to Alex behind her back.</p>
