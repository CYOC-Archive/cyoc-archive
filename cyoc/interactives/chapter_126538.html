<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Two weeks later he was walking back from school, he wanted more than ever to take of the band and show his new form to all his friends at school, yet he couldn&#39;t do that. For some reason there were invisible strings stopping his ascension. <br />
<br />
He tried a lot of methods to get rid of this instinct, Firstly and most obviously asking for it to go away. This of course failed which could suggest that it wasn&#39;t the power which was the problem but his acceptance of it. It only happened when he changed he knew that, so he had to find out what it was.<br />
<br />
The furthest he tried was 20 minutes before he got so scared that he put the band back on. It was this weird sensation to kill, to smell the blood of innocent and kind people, but to have such a hateful perception of them. He wanted to test it.<br />
<br />
And there was no better test subject then his brother Darrel, Who as much as him would want this change, In fact he constantly saw Darrel trying to work out but failing because of his disease. It was sad to watch but for a younger brother amusing to see such defeat in battle.<br />
<br />
So he would give his brother the gift he always wanted, A chance to ascend but also to see what this killer instinct was about.<br />
<br />
He opened the door to his brother&#39;s room. &quot;Get out my room ty&quot; he said angrily. &quot;Hey Darrel...hehe...Let me show you something&quot; He was advancing into his brothers room. &quot;I said get out my room ty!&quot; He said it with a higher tone this time. So Ty know he had to act fast to get his brothers trust.<br />
<br />
As Darrel was about to yell at him a third time Ty quickly said &quot;I wish we were in a safe and secure place&quot; Suddenly they both disappear and reappear in a cell. <br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell&quot; Darrel remarks, &quot;I told you I wanted to show you something&quot; I smugly say, Darrel looks around and see&#39;s the new setting and then spies a glance at his younger brother. &quot;How did you do that...a-and what else can you do&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anything I want...&quot; Ty say&#39;s smugly again<br />
<br />
Darrel stood there in awe, So ty took this chance to start his experiment. &quot;Do you want to grow big?&quot; Ty says. Darrel looks shocked but also curious &quot;Y-you can do that&quot;.<br />
<br />
Ty repeats the question again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yes if you can...please!&quot; Ty didn&#39;t want to see Darrel start begging, this was already embarrassing enough. So ty walked towards the bars of the cell and looks at Darrel &quot;Okay then, then stand still&quot;.<br />
<br />
Ty wishes the same wish he did on himself for Darrel. Darrel suddenly groans in pain, as his body starts the same transformation ty had before.<br />
<br />
His back ripped through his shirt faster than ty&#39;s did, Darrel moves his hands around with pleasure and felt his biceps inflate and crackle the shirt like a fire cracker.<br />
<br />
He pushed himself against the wall trying to stay stable, but then he feels his groan grow and loses it again, He cries out in pleasure as his body does this voluntary act of transformation on him, sculpting him into the same form Ty had.<br />
<br />
Ty decided it would soon not be safe in the room, so he exited the cell. Darrel noticed this and called out &quot;Wh-where are you going ty..&quot; Darrel says, His transformation seems to have eased a little. <br />
<br />
&quot;You are making the same progress I did&quot; tapping his gold band happily. &quot;What do you mean, did you do this to yourself first&quot; Darrel says in a sweat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why yes, and I found something weird happen when I first had my transformation, I&#39;m sure your sensing it now aren&#39;t you Darrel&quot;. Darrel looks scared and looks around.<br />
<br />
&quot;What...what have you done...Why do I feel like this&quot; He says scared now. His muscles seemed to be bulging and he seemed to be calming them, however his grip was slipping.<br />
<br />
&quot;That killer instinct you get when you transform, I don&#39;t know what it is but because of it I have been forced to stay in this puny micro form instead of that godly ascension. Wishing did nothing so this is the better option...&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty looks at Darrel evilly &quot;To see what it would do on a test subject&quot;.<br />
<br />
Darrel&#39;s veins seemed to be exploding out their skin &quot;No...no... NOOOOOO!!&quot; Suddenly he let go, And he exploded comfortably out of his leather and acrylic hide, it ripped of him and he was only in his pants at that point. He muscles were bulging and contorting. He was groaning in fear but in please. &quot;I ca- don- Don&#39;t want it to...Stop!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty had to look back to stop his feeling to change swell in him, He could here darrels cries of joy, and the bones in his body cracking like sticks. Which was new now that he thought about it.<br />
<br />
He looked back and saw Darrel wasn&#39;t only growing with muscles but also his body was changing to more animalistic, His fingers seemed to crack and grow sharp adjacent claws, His toes merged together to form flat pointed hooves. He hold his head suddenly and I saw with horror two horns growing out of his head, crusted but also battle torn. <br />
<br />
His muscles were growing sharper and harder until suddenly his muscles stopped, He was half the height of the room. However it didn&#39;t stop there his skin grew dark and brown, hair shuffled it&#39;s way out of his skin growing this thick leathery hide. <br />
<br />
He now stood in front of me a 13ft, monstrous but vignette monster from hell. <br />
<br />
Ty looked in fear but also In sadness, He know this would be his fate if he transformed also, A horrible monster from the fires below. The minotaur which wasn&#39;t Darrel anymore flexed his muscles and groaned in pleasure as it sat down.<br />
<br />
Ty with fear walked towards the bars of the cell and looks inside.</p>
