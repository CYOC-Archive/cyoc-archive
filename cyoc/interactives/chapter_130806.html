<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Tom!&quot; Matt cried out, the suggestion awakening something of a desperate idea that seemed to fit the moment.  Tom had to only turn his ear slightly before Matt continued, &quot;Think of a vixen!&quot; Matt clenched his fists as his own thoughts had set his changes into slow effect, his nails darkening.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; asked a confused Tom.<br />
<br />
&quot;A vixen!  A female fox!&quot; Matt reiterated as the very first tingle at the base of his spine sent his skin budding.  <br />
<br />
By suggestion alone the thought was there and Tom suddenly felt a strange twitching take over control of his nose.  Crossing his eyes, he watched through his glasses as the tip of his nose took on a strange shape before the skin turned a moist black.  He was about to speak when only the slight opening of his jaw caused it to pop and crack.  Then, to his shock, the whole of his face seemed to stretch forward somewhat, and then more and more. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ah-ah-awoooo,&quot; Tom was only able to manage while the beginnings of a muzzle were apparent, to say nothing of the slight pointing of his ears and loss of an inch in height.  &quot;Wh-what&#39;s happening to me,&quot; his voice squeaked at the end.<br />
<br />
Kate couldn&#39;t help but grin at the sight of the two.  &quot;Good thinking, Matt,&quot; she said, looking over at him.  <br />
<br />
For his part, Matt had slid his pants off and was admiring the look at the base of his cock, which while shrunken along with the rest of his overall frame, had started to merge with his skin to form the base of his new sheath.  Behind him, the now several inch long tail was having its first wag.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve always had a...a...,&quot; Matt then struggled as his teeth started to fall out, new ones coming in soon after.<br />
<br />
&quot;A thing for foxes?&quot; Kate finished.<br />
<br />
Matt let himself fall to all fours after admiring the longer nails and shrunken digits his new paws.  &quot;Y-res,&quot; Matt answered, his hips and legs cracking him into his new stance.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what about you?&quot; Kate asked of Tom, who was slowly lifting his shirt.  Two rows of nipples were poking out down his frame to his crotch which, when his sagging jeans drooped low enough to the point of falling, revealed that any trace of either testicle was replaced by a growing slit which was pulling in the remnants of Tom&#39;s former manhood.<br />
<br />
The churning in Tom&#39;s guts had been the first sign and while he couldn&#39;t see his cock and balls were now replaced, he saw from the sideways look on Kate&#39;s face what had happened.  Tom looked back at Matt and saw him slipping out of his shirt, partially due to his body looking mass and height rapidly.  All this as fox fur started to sprout all over him as his tail was taken in a furry bloom.<br />
<br />
His hands cramping, Tom let himself fall to all fours, his posture quick to take advantage and lock him with a few cracks, causing Tom&#39;s new tail to spring up over his vixen backside.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess..r&#39;I&#39;ll be r&#39;a... vrixen...&quot; Tom struggled to say as his own teeth fell and were replaced, his muzzle down sprouting its own fur and whiskers, his head topped with pointed ears and his old hair almost fallen out completely.<br />
<br />
&quot;You guess?&quot; Kate chuckled.  She only had to glance at Matt to see him already sniffing at the air with a growing greed.  From his new furry sheath, emerged his new red cock; his eyes blinked away any humanity as lust took him.  &quot;Matt is going to make it very clear that you&#39;re a vixen.  And in heat, I think,&quot; she added, glancing back and seeing the swollen sex behind the barely thigh high former male, nor turned vixen.<br />
<br />
Tom&#39;s mind, which had been otherwise unaffected until now, started to feel a strange numbness followed by a loss of control, and feeling.  Instead actions and need took hold.  Tom had to shake his head to think straight, or at least try to.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now you&#39;re realizing just how animal you&#39;re becoming,&quot; Kate says, kneeling down to stroke the mostly furred back of Tom.  As she did, she tried not to draw attention to the reynard coming up behind the fresh vixen.  &quot;It&#39;s better to let the animal take over at this point.  Otherwise, you&#39;ll just be really ashamed of what comes next.&quot;<br />
<br />
Before Tom could react, and as Kate stood up, a nose was at Tom&#39;s sex.  His tail perked up on reaction along and the invitation was given.  A moment later Matt was mounting him and Tom was stuck, literally.  What ever thoughts the two may have had, about school or friends or life, disappeared in a growing frenzy of thrusts, letting themselves be overtaken so by the time the knot swelled and the seed was planted, Tom and Matt were truly gone.<br />
<br />
No sooner had they detached than Tom&#39;s belly was starting to swell already.<br />
<br />
Kate hurried them into the hall and out the back into the forest behind the dorms, in the snow, before closing the door on the two.  The dashed off into the woods then, cursing the college for years to come with a huge fox population.</p>
