<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Luke was laying in bed he just couldn&#39;t fall asleep. Being unable to stop thinking about his current predicament kept him awake. He started thinking about how to solve this. The answer was obvious: The condoms got him like this so the condoms could be the solution.  He got out of bed. He wasn&#39;t feeling tired at all. He grabbed the box of condoms out of the drawer. Luke looked at pondered while examining them. They were all roughly the same looking with the rubber ring looking identical. Their size range was probably higher than his current endowment Luke thought looking at the box. To his surprise they had quite a large range written on the package. <br />
<br />
Luke continued to think about it; &quot;What if I put it on and the same thing happens again?&quot; He came up with an idea he grabbed a condom and attempted to stretch it out. It took quite a bit of effort but eventually he got it wider and longer. Luke hesitated for a moment. &quot;What if it doesn&#39;t work, what if he becomes even smaller?&quot; He sighed and gathered his courage. He then proceeded to try and get it over his dick. It fit over it like a loose sleeve. Nothing happened. Luke took it off and after waiting a while still nothing had happened. &quot;Maybe I need to be hard.&quot; Luke thought to himself. A few lewd thoughts later and it still didn&#39;t appear to help. Even now the stretched condom was a poor fit. He grabbed another condom. Clearly stretching it wider wasn&#39;t going to work so he just stretched it longer to see if that does work. <br />
<br />
Luke made sure he was aroused enough and then clumsily he managed to get the stretched condom over his dick. He had stretched it so much that the condom was probably over three times longer than his dick. Again, nothing happened. Luke exhaled deeply after waiting a few moments. He then peeled the condom off slowly. As he peeled it of his penis seemed to become flaccid and slightly stick to the condom.  As he rolled it off he suddenly gasped more shaft than he had priorly had was coming out of the condom. Quickly he removed it fully and got in front of the mirror. He groaned after what he saw. Still the same body but now his tiny pecker had changed it was now a long noodle cock, visibly longer but not notably thicker at was as if his prior pecker was attached to the end of a tube of flesh or his tiny shaft had gained over 7 times more length. Luke looked at it. It seemed really long it was hard to guess but 7 inches or more in it&#39;s current flaccid state. It was a little too long, perhaps, Luke thought. <br />
<br />
Grabbing another condom he couldn&#39;t quite get it over his semi-soft dick. He then put the loose fitting condom over his penis, still nothing, Luke had sort of expected that. He grabbed the original condom and of course it too didn&#39;t fit, it was a little too loose. He suddenly realised that even if he got another condom over this endowment it would be stretched out just to fit over it, would it even decrease his size? Either way he needed to get an erection to even get it on. Luke realised it was going to be a challenge along the way as he rubbed it. He felt his heart beating in his chest as he used both hands. He could hear himself breathing heavily and suddenly a spike in his crotch, he was ready to cum but his dick didn&#39;t feel fully erect yet. Still he quickly grabbed a condom while his balls ached and rolled it over his penis the best he could. It had grown larger gaining minor few inches in length and the girth felt a little  larger as well. Luke couldn&#39;t get it over his entire dick however no matter how much he tried. It started hurting and suddenly his penis stung. He quickly removed the condom and only a moment after he blew a load. His penis seemed even longer when he took of the condom but Luke wasn&#39;t particularly focused on that at the moment. He awkwardly rubbed his still fairly soft penis as a few more shots came out. <br />
<br />
Fatigued he didn&#39;t have the energy to do much and fell onto the bed hiding the condoms beneath the blanket. Not even cleaning up properly before falling asleep. His cock ached and felt warm in bed from masturbating but almost thoughtlessly he fell asleep not bothered by the throbbing cock.</p>
