<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When Ty woke up the following morning he quickly noticed that his teddy wasn´t in his arms anymore. He had turned on his stomach during the night and pinned Dustin down. Now Dustin didn´t lay under his chest anymore, but had moved down and Ty found him pinned under his legs instead, Dustin&#39;s face near the tip of Ty&#39;s erect cock. Through Ty&#39;s movements he had rubbed it over Dustin&#39;s face, and before he could think about it he shot a load of cum in the teddies face, bathing the brown bear in sticky white cum. Dustin had plead for Ty to wake up and stop rubbing on him, but now it was to late. “Yuck, Ty, that&#39;s gross. Even if I love your affection for me and love you back, don´t do that again.” he thought disgusted. Ty grinned down at Dustin a bit embarrassed. “Sorry, that wasn´t what I had in mind for you to experience, Dustin.” “At least not so soon.” he added in his thoughts. <br />
After a minute in silence Dustin thought impatient: “Get your ass out of bed and clean me, Ty, or change me back so I can clean myself.” Ty looked a bit shocked at Dustin&#39;s choice of words, but replied: “No, little Dustin. I won´t change you back, after all you are my teddy brother and not human anymore. And I will wash you after breakfast, For now it will be enough if I wish for you to look clean to everyone beside us two. And if I hold you any dirt and such on you won´t rub off on me.” Ty grinned as Dustin cursed him again. But that let him add another silent wish for Dustin to be unable to curse or use dirty language in his thoughts. With that done Ty stood up and left the room to go shower, leaving Dustin wait on his bed, still with Ty&#39;s cum all over him. As Ty could only hear him if he was holding him or concentrated on it, Dustin&#39;s plea for Ty to clean him now went unheard.<br />
When Ty returned twenty minutes later Dustin was mad at him. The cum had dried into his fur, and both the smell and the taste were now stronger than before to him. Ty ignored him while he got dressed in a plain white shirt and blue shorts over the underwear he had taken to the bathroom. He put his white socks on before grabbing Dustin and heading down to breakfast. He still had to see how Mark and June treated him now to think of what to do with them. Simply making them love him wasn´t what he wanted to do.<br />
Sitting down at the table and wishing them both a good morning only June gave an answer to him. Dustin was sat next to Ty&#39;s plate on the table, facing his parents. But his pleas to them for help went unheard.<br />
When Ty had finished their silent breakfast Mark finally looked at him. “You will clean my car before heading out, boy.” Ty looked at him and replied a bit angry: “Why do I need to clean your car again? As far as I have seen it´s still clean since I had to clean it on Thursday.” “You will clean it, basta. And don´t forget about the garden. I still think it was a mistake to adopt you, we should have tried more to get out own son.” Mark said also angry, far more than Ty was. June tried to calm them both down. “Ty, please just do as Mark wants and clean the car. Mark, don´t be harsh to Ty, you know you can´t get kids and I know you love Ty.” <br />
Dustin was shocked, his parents didn´t remember him. Mark was now angry at June as well, but before he could hurt her, Ty silently wished for both of them to stop moving and speaking. Then he wished to know how they felt for him and for each other.<br />
June loved him like he was her son, while her love for Mark was stretched thin already. Mark on the other hand hated Ty and saw him as useless. June was nothing more than his wife, no love behind it anymore.<br />
While both Mark and June stood there, eyes looking around in confused panic, Dustin hoped Ty wouldn´t do anything bad to them, still sitting on the table near Ty&#39;s forgotten plate. Ty himself was thinking about what should be done. June wouldn´t need to be changed, he decided. She was on his side without him doing anything to her. The only thing he wished for her now was to sit down in her chair and fall asleep, which she did seconds later.<br />
June didn´t understand why she couldn´t move, and then her body moved on its own to sit down again. Next she know nothing as she fell asleep right there.<br />
Mark was another story. Ty needed a bit to find a satisfying new role for him. Ty found it fitting to turn Mark into their new dog, as he hated animals. Not even Dustin had been able to get a pet before, but Ty would get one now. He sat down next to the teddyfied Dustin and the sleeping June before he started his silent wishes. He would make it slow, at least to Mark it would seem so. And to torture him even more Ty willed a mirror in front of him, so Mark would see himself changing.<br />
Dustin had no idea what Ty was planning. He had been scared for his mother, but realized that she was simply sleeping and relaxed a bit mentally. But the mirror was a giveaway that his father would change now. “Ty, please don´t change him.”<br />
Ty had placed a hand on the teddies leg, so he heard him, but replied nothing. He wouldn´t explain it as Dustin wouldn´t remember anyway.<br />
Mark was confused and angry. He guessed that Ty did something, but he blamed everything that went wrong on Ty. His eyes widened as the mirror appeared so he could see himself standing there.<br />
The first change was simple, as all clothes Mark wore vanished around him, leaving him naked and red in both anger and embarrassment. Then the real changes started, as both of Mark&#39;s hands and feet grew shorter, mostly his fingers and toes. The only thing growing on them were his nails, which grew thicker, sharper and longer forming claws. His thumbs and big toes moved back along the newly formed paws and changed into a dewclaw for each of them. Soft pads grew out of the lower side of all four paws. The only thing missing was the fur, but that didn´t grew, leaving the paws naked. Instead the changes crawled up his arms and legs, reforming them into matching dog legs, each shortening to match in size.<br />
Mark was screaming mentally for it to stop, but it did nothing. His cock and balls vanished into a sheath, but as Ty saw this he decided that Mark hadn´t earned it and wished for it to be vanish. Mark looked horrified as the newly formed sheath sunk back towards his body, and then it sealed itself under his skin, leaving him smooth like he was neutered. He couldn´t even feel anything there anymore, as if there was never anything to begin with. With some pain his new tail grew out above his reformed ass, all still naked. With a sickening loud crack his back bend itself to make him a quadruped being. Mark would have dropped down already if his body wasn´t hindered to move, and it was really uncomfortable for him still standing that way. The changes stopped by his neck then, leaving him a naked dog from down there.<br />
“You turn out rather nice, Mark, but I guess you will get cold if you remain naked.” Ty said smiling at him.<br />
Mark would have strangled Ty. He had been right, this good for nothing box was guilty of whatever happened to him. How he could do so, Mark had no idea. All of the sudden he felt itchy all over his body, as if millions of ants crawled over his skin. He could see the fur growing in the mirror, bushy blond fur. Half a minute later, to Mark more like an hour, he was covered in said fur from the neck down.<br />
Unbeknownst to him Ty willed him to drop down now, still facing the mirror. Mark mentally yelped when he started to fall, stopped by his stretched out front legs. Then his head started to change. With another crack his neck shifted, letting him get a bit more comfortable looking forwards to the mirror. His dark hair got blond like his fur and more wild looking as his ears vanished under the fur only to grow out on top of his head and far bigger than before. As they flapped down his mouth stretched into a muzzle, his nose integrated with it before turning into a wet, black nose. His teeth sharpened, his tongue got longer and his voice got higher, not that he would know without being able to speak. Or better barking now, as his ability to speak was lost to him. Finally his eyes grew into shape. Now Mark was a golden retriever in body.<br />
Ty stood up again and moved to pet the dog, willing him to be able to speak again. Seconds later Mark starts to bark angry at him. “Yeah, I know you are a good dog, but don´t look so angry Mark. We aren´t finished yet.” Ty said still petting him. All of the sudden Mark begun to get smaller and his barking got even higher. Ty had willed for Mark to regress into a puppy of a few weeks old. Mark was around the same size as the teddy Dustin, but was still barking angry at Ty, who still petted him on the head.<br />
“Now I have a cute, little puppy instead of a hating foster dad.” Ty said happily. Mark growled at him, still looking angry. On the small puppies face it looked anything nut that, and Ty laughed at him. Ty didn´t say anything out loud, but made a new wish for Mark. The growling stopped as Mark was pushed back mentally. He lost the remaining control of his body as a new consciousness formed, that of an loyal, obedient and innocent puppy. <br />
When the puppy showed more love towards Ty for being petted he said: “You like that? You are a good little puppy, aren&#39;t you? Now I will just need a new name for you, Mark doesn&#39;t fit to such a cute boy like you. How about Phil? Do you like that?” While Mark was yelling on the inside, the puppy nodded and barked one time, to which Ty smiled at him. “Okay than, my smart little puppy. Then starting now you will be called Phil.” Again Phil barked once. Ty had made him intelligent enough, so he really understood him, much to Mark&#39;s horror. Also he realized that Ty&#39;s renaming the puppy affected him, as he thought about himself as Phil instead of Mark. And Mark would be in the same predicament then Dustin, slowly changing mentally as well until only Phil remained inside, the new consciousness would override his slowly.<br />
While Ty continued to pet Phil he wished for June to wake up again, only altering her memory a bit, along with everyone else who had known Mark beside himself, Dustin and Ty. To the world Mark had died in an accident three months ago. Phil was a gift for Ty to stop mourning, not that he really did, and June for now was alone with Ty. They wouldn´t have any problems with money, as June got a good widows pension for Mark. Mark and Dustin would know the new story as well, but keep their memory of what real happened.<br />
“You okay, mom?” Ty asked as June woke up, sounding worried. “Yeah, but what happened?” she replied. “You just dropped back, luckily in front of that chair. You had me and Phil worried something is wrong. I don´t want to lose you too.” Ty said, faking tears, as at the moment he wasn´t really sad. Phil barked once in agreement. “I´m sorry for worrying you both. You won´t lose me, Ty, we will get through this together.” June answered, hugging him.<br />
Shortly after that Ty walked with Phil while hugging Dustin with one arm. He willed himself to hear Mark&#39;s thoughts as well, at least if he either touched Phil directly or had him on his leach. Ty had been quick to change one older belt from Mark into a collar and another into a leach to walk with him. Dustin was again pleading to be washed, so Ty tuned him out for the walk. Mark was horrified when Phil easily shit on the ground, and with a laugh Ty let it turn into a chew-toy for Phil, who happily used it, much to Mark&#39;s disgust.<br />
At home Ty let Phil of the leach before heading to the washing machine. Now Dustin was horrified screaming at him: “What are you doing, Ty?” “You wanted to be washed, and as a stuff toy that means you go into the washing machine, Dustin. Have fun in there.” answered Ty grinning before throwing teddy Dustin in, who screamed “Nooooo.” loudly in his mind. Then Ty put some other dirty clothes on top of Dustin before starting the machine. Luckily for Ty he didn´t hear Dustin&#39;s screams while he was inside.<br />
While Dustin was washed Ty played with Phil, turning various things that had belonged to Mark into toys and some clothes into a big dog bed. Mark was near breaking down, still cursing Ty but it got fewer over time as he realized how little chance he had to ever turn back. And Ty didn´t answer him to correct that he would never return to being the old Mark, so Mark didn´t know Ty could hear his thoughts.</p>
