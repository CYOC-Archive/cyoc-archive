<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After breakfast, Susan and Draco return to Draco’s room so Susan could put on some pants before heading to the park with Draco’s sister and father. In the room, Susan quickly jumps out the window over to her house and room to grab some more clothes and jumped right back. Her father had already left for the day, but it wasn’t uncommon for Susan to leave her window unlock or even open. <br />
<br />
Susan pulls some panties up before looking at her pants. “How am I going to keep these up with my tail?” <br />
<br />
“Try looping a belt over your tail.” Draco suggests. <br />
<br />
Susan pulls up her pants, noting how they seem to be tighter on her thighs and calves. “I may need to go by the store as well.” She comments to a smile from Draco. <br />
<br />
“Well, At least you can still wear clothes.” Draco replies before Susan points to her large breasts. “Okay, mostly.” He rebutted. <br />
<br />
Susan then took one of Draco’s old belts and raped it throw her pants. It was a little large, but it did the trick. Susan whipped her tail back and forth to try to make her pants fall, but they didn’t. “Looks like we are ready to go.” <br />
<br />
“No shoes?” Draco asks. <br />
<br />
“No.” Susan replies. “My feet feel like the can handle some rough ground. I mean, we are just going to the park.” <br />
<br />
“There are some trails attach to the park, we could go for a walk.” Draco then thought about how that sounded as Susan smiles with a large grin. “You know what I mean!” He snaps. “No dog walking jokes.” <br />
<br />
“Hey, I’m a wolf too, now.” Susan replies with a giggle. “So, I would be joking about me too.” <br />
<br />
Draco and Susan then headed downstairs to wait on Draco’s father and sister. As they walked down to the door, they see Laura running up dress in some play clothes. She jumps onto Susan, her head hitting Susan’s breasts. <br />
<br />
“So soft.” Laura says, making Susan blush. <br />
<br />
Mr. Thompson comes following shortly after, changed into some jogging clothes. “Laura, be nice. Give Susan some space.” <br />
<br />
“It’s fine.” Susan replies as Laura positions herself under Susan’s breasts, holding them up with her head. Draco snickers at the sight, getting a glance from Susan. <br />
<br />
The four then soon head out to the car. As they are walking out, Damian walks out as well. <br />
<br />
“Hey, I’m meeting up with Jenifer at the mail.” He says before walking pass the Thompson’s SUV. <br />
<br />
“You been seeing her a lot lately.” His father says, “When do we get to meet her?” <br />
<br />
“When you stop being creepy about it.” Damian replies as he walks off, heading down the sidewalk. <br />
<br />
“I’m not creepy, am I?” Mr. Thompson asks, jokingly. The three kids nod their heads yes. <br />
<br />
The drive down to the park didn’t take long and Susan and Draco tell Draco’s father their plan before splitting off. As they walked the trail, Susan could feel eyes watching her. As she looked around, she could see and hear people talking about her being topless and making a big deal until seeing her tail and ear. Draco held her hand in support as they continued to walk for hours. <br />
<br />
“Thanks, I didn’t think it would be this hard.” Susan tells Draco. <br />
<br />
“Well, how many Hybrids do you recall now?” Draco asks. <br />
<br />
Susan thinks for a minute. “Fifteen! It was only twelve last night.” <br />
<br />
“I wonder if any of them remember being human.” Draco says, then he gets a whiff of a familiar sent. “Hey, I know someone coming around the corner, it’s one of my brother’s friends. But they are different?” <br />
<br />
As the two kids turn the corner, they see a teenage bull-boy with a half cow-girl. It was Jacob, from Damian’s class. Both boys were part of an anima club and auto shop together. The girl, who looked to be the same age as Damian, was naked as could be. She also ah two small cow horns and ears on her head, a long tail just above her plump butt, and an udder. Fur also covered around her hips, thighs and ears. Her breasts were massive, taking up most of front view. <br />
<br />
“Oh, Hey, it’s Damian’s Hybrid little brother.” Jacob says. He was almost full bull, but on two legs. He didn’t have a sheath, letting his penis hang down, reaching his knees. He was much buffer than before. Draco remembered as a human, Jacob was skinnier then Damian, which said something. <br />
<br />
“Hi.” Draco says. “You are not with Damian at the mall?” <br />
<br />
“And watch him and Janifer flirt awkwardly to each other, no thank you.” The girl says. Draco then recognizes the girl to be Eve. She was also in Damian’s class. “What about you? I don’t remember hearing about Damian’s little brother having a half Hybrid mate. I’m Eve, what’s your name?” <br />
<br />
Susan looks up, “Oh, I’m Susan. I’m also their neighbor.” <br />
<br />
“Oh, yeah.” Jacob says, “Damian did say something about you being friends with Draco. Well, we got to go. Some ‘plowing to do.’ If you know what I mean. Tell your brother that I hope everything goes well with him and his Cat girl. HA HA.” <br />
<br />
As the two teens walk off, Susan looks at Draco, concern on her face. “Draco, My memories just changed again.” <br />
<br />
“What?” Draco asks. <br />
<br />
“There is now sixteen Hybrids.” Susan says. “I think the girl your brother is dating was just changed.” <br />
<br />
“Oh, no.” Draco says. That could mean that my brother will be changed too!” <br />
<br />
Susan and Draco try to talk about what they can do, if it is not too late. <br />
<br />
An hour earlier, Damian and Janifer are walking back to the Thompson household. Janifer is still human at this point, but follow close behind, Jeff had other plans. <br />
<br />
“Man, that store clerk was an ass.” Damian says. <br />
<br />
“I know.” Jenifer replied before taking Damian’s hand. “Thanks for standing up for me.” <br />
<br />
“Hey, anyone tries to be rude to you, I’ll deal with them.” Damian replies. “I just can’t believe that cop says there is nothing about the clerk. I mean, he tried to grab you butt.” <br />
<br />
“She did say that they will keep an eye in the store. They have been having complaints.” Jenifer adds as they walk up to the house. “Are you sure it’s fine that we can be hear?” <br />
<br />
“Yeah, my mom is at work until late and my dad took my brother and sister at the park with Draco’s new mate.” <br />
<br />
“He has a mate now?” Jenifer asks. “Is it that Susan you tell me about?”  <br />
<br />
“Yeah.” Damian says as he opens the door. The two teens walk inside and sit on the couch in front of the large window. Jeff is close behind, hidden bay his app, watching the two teens. <br />
<br />
“She completely changed.” Damian continues. “I mean, I’m sorry. I really like you, so don’t take this the wrong way, but she grew such large breast. Almost too large.” <br />
<br />
Jenifer laughs. “She is a Hybrid now. What human could compete with that?” <br />
<br />
Damian looks over as Jenifer. She was in shorts and a button-down t-shirt. She was well gifted in breast size as well. “You.” he replies with no hesitation. <br />
<br />
Jenifer leans in closer, kissing Damian’s cheek. “Protecting my body and my pride. What more could I have for a boyfriend.” <br />
<br />
Jeff sees and hears the conversation, coming to an idea. He plays with his app before pressing enter. <br />
<br />
Inside the house, Jenifer starts to feel hot as her changes begin. She lets out a small purr before placing herself on top of Damian. Damian pulls his legs up on the couch, as Jenifer seductively pats at his pants zipper. Jenifer’s arks her back as a tail starts growing above her butt. As she arks back down, she opens Damian’s pants zipper, letting out his erect penis. <br />
<br />
Jenifer starts to like Damian’s member as her tongue becomes like sandpaper. Damian moans while receiving his first head. As Jenifer licks up and down, her breast start straining her shirt. But her breast weren’t the only things growing. Jenifer’s whole body begins gaining muscle as tan fur covers it. Her ears widen and grow, moving to the top of her head. Her pants burst at the seams as her feet shred her shoes. Her hands turn more paw like as he holds herself up on the couch. Soon, her shirt explodes, as her nipples darken and widened with the inflating orbs. <br />
<br />
Finally, Jenifer places her mouth over Damian’s shaft. Going up and down with all her might, her face pushes out into a muzzle. As Damian hits his climax and explodes in Jenifer’s mouth, Jenifer takes every bit of his seed with her new lioness body. <br />
<br />
As Damian catches his breath, Jenifer licks his member clean. She then sits up with him as he leaves his penis hanging out of his pants. <br />
“Wow.” Damian says. <br />
<br />
“I told you lionesses are good.” Jenifer replies, her memories being changed with everyone else. “That was just a think you for helping me with that jerk.” <br />
<br />
Jenifer then looked at her torn clothes. “I tried to dress nice for you, but I guess my body just doesn’t want to work with me today.” <br />
<br />
“Oh, your body did fine.” Damian replies before taking Jenifer’s hand. “Now what about this boyfriend thing you talked about?” he says, smiling. <br />
<br />
“Well, you can be my mate, if you think you can go another round.” Jenifer replied.</p>
