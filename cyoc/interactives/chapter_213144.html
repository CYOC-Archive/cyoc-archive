<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As easy as it would be to age Jerry up to Elementary age and not have to deal with them for the remainder of the day, Ethan decided that he still wasn&#39;t done with Jerry and Chris for that matter. True, he&#39;d be rolling the dice with the changes he was going to make. By making Jerry as young as he wanted the Chronivac might translate Charlene&#39;s interest in him to alter reality to make him Jerry and Chris&#39; biological father. But that wasn&#39;t the case currently, and likely still wouldn&#39;t be--just as long as he didn&#39;t make Jerry too young. Like making him as young as conception, probably a bad idea, especially with Ethan in Charlene&#39;s apartment, ready and a little horny at seeing Charlene still in her bathrobe. But perhaps a little further on in the pregnancy? That might still be safe and keep him from becoming Jerry and Chris&#39; biological dad. Kneeling down, Ethan smirked as in gazed into Jerry&#39;s innocent eyes. &quot;Guess it&#39;s your lucky day Jerry,&quot; he whispered. &quot;You get a chance to start all over, not many people get the opportunity for a second chance at life--little bit of advice, don&#39;t squander it this time.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two-year old Jerry blinked before grunting and kicking a little. Ethan patted little Jerry on the head.<br />
<br />
Standing Ethan now returned to his laptop, taking a moment to bring up all four children&#39;s profiles. Making a few quick adjustments, Ethan now settled on his decision. Jerry would be going back to three months along, Charlene would be pregnant but still able to have sex, with Chris becoming an infant of eight months old. Lola and Alyssa would remain their current ages, though Ethan was thinking of how he could have some fun with them later. Smiling, he now pressed enter before admiring his handiwork.<br />
<br />
The changes to both Jerry and Chris became instantly apparent as both began to shrink, with Jerry shrinking at a more alarming rate than Chris at first, before Chris caught up. Jerry grew chubbier as babyhood overtook him and Chris wasn&#39;t far behind when Jerry lost his ability to sit upright and fell back into the cushion just a little guy propped up by a pillow. Rather quickly as months flew off of Jerry, Ethan watched as the hair on Jerry&#39;s head began to pull in and become thin and almost feathery looking. Jerry&#39;s eyes seemed to grow in his face, but Ethan knew it was just and optical illusion as it wasn&#39;t Jerry&#39;s eyes that were growing, but his skull and face that were shrinking around his eyes. Soon keeping those eyes open became too much work and effort for the few weeks old infant. He&#39;d only begun to fuss in his onesie when suddenly Jerry vanished from the couch, and Ethan heard a groan from where Charlene had disappeared to.<br />
<br />
Ethan now turned his attention to Chris, only to see the young future playboy settle in as an eight month old tiny infant sitting next to the three-year old Lola. As soon as the changes were done, now Lola and Alyssa were sitting next to one another with tiny Chris propped up on a pillow, capable of sitting up on his own, but deciding it was too much effort to do at this moment. He gurgled and gave a baby laugh and waved his fat chubby fist towards the two girls, trying to gain their attention, but Lola and Alyssa, now apparently far more friendly with one another as they giggled between themselves talking about the TV show they were watching were now ignoring the baby Chris. If only the egotistical jerk could see himself now--completely ignored by the female half of his age bracket.<br />
<br />
Ethan felt his memories settle for a moment. Chris wasn&#39;t his child, but the product of Charlene having gone to a sperm clinic before she had met Ethan. Ethan now recalled dating Charlene as her pregnancy with Chris had progressed, them meeting not long after she had decided to go through with the insemination. There was a little joke the two of them had, that if she&#39;d waited a few weeks longer before meeting Ethan when she took the job that brought them together, that Chris might not exist. Ethan and Charlene had found each other insatiably satisfying during her horny phase of pregnancy, a phase which Charlene was now currently back in as morning sickness and nausea were beginning to subside from being so frequent a problem as they were at the start of the pregnancy. Lola and Alyssa were daughters of friends of Charlene&#39;s that she had been looking after as practice for looking after older children to prepare when Chris got older.<br />
<br />
Ethan and Charlene&#39;s fun times did not cease once Chris had been born, perhaps more spread out and harder to coordinate now that Chris had kept Charlene up at all hours--and Ethan too when he spent the night.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ethan, could you come here please?&quot; asked Charlene from her bedroom. Ethan closed his laptop and then obliged his call. Lola and Alyssa were completely absorbed in the show they were watching, and half-heartedly Ethan asked for them to keep an eye on the baby, even though he knew that was a rather irresponsible and idiotic thing to ask of two toddlers.<br />
<br />
Ethan entered Charlene&#39;s bedroom to find her laying down on the bed, her bathrobe left open, giving Ethan a view of her lacy underwear underneath, which was interrupted by only the slightest of baby bumps--enough to say that she had one, and not much more, as far as Ethan could tell. And that Baby Bump was all that remained of Jerry... and which Ethan couldn&#39;t help now but feel rather proud of as in this reality, Ethan now was Jerry&#39;s biological father. Well, he had known it was a possible risk by making Jerry this young--oh well.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about the kids?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t plan on doing this all morning. A few quick rounds and then we can rejoin the kids,&quot; suggested Charlene.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay...&quot; said Ethan, not needing to be convinced any further.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think it&#39;s time for our performance reviews,&quot; suggested Charlene with a smirk, and Ethan didn&#39;t need to be told twice what that meant, already fumbling with his belt and readying to make his altered memories a reality.</p>
