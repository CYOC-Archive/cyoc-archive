<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Hannah shushed her friend Matt as she went back to reading her biology textbook. They had agreed to study together for their upcoming midterm but she was getting increasingly annoyed at her friend&#39;s interruptions. The two college students had been friends since childhood, being neighbors, they were practically inseparable since a young age. Even when, as they matured, Matt began to develop feelings for his best friend, they still stuck together, despite Hannah&#39;s feigned ignorance on the subject. It wasn&#39;t like she was much to look at, in her opinion. Her wiry, plain blonde hair that ended at her chin gave way to a body that could be described as average at best. With her A-cup breasts and her less than toned body, Hannah couldn&#39;t see what the man saw in her. After all, she was incredibly shy -- while Matt had found other friends in college with interests similar to his own, Hannah&#39;s only friend remained Matt. She was just too afraid to approach other people. The only thing she had going for her was her intelligence. She was on track to win a noble prize after she completed her goals. She was going to be a top scientist in her field and cure the world&#39;s problems and with her intellect it was totally possible.<br />
<br />
That meant, however, that there was no time for distractions as she slammed her fists on the table and gave Matt a hard stare. &quot;Look, I understand you wanna talk, but now&#39;s not the time. If you&#39;re going keep distracting me then I&#39;m going back to my room to study,&quot; she explained.<br />
<br />
Matt looked at her sheepishly. &quot;Sorry, I was just trying to make conversation. I know you get stressed during exams, and I just wanted you to relax for a bit and take a break. You&#39;ve been at this for hours, studying this much isn&#39;t going to help you,&quot; he lectured.<br />
<br />
Hannah responded by closing her books and packing her stuff. Who was he to tell her what was and wasn&#39;t going to help her? She needed to ace this exam, so he certainly wasn&#39;t going to hold her back. &quot;If that&#39;s how you feel then fine. I&#39;m going back to my room then. Goodbye.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hannah, don&#39;t be like that, I&#39;m just trying to help,&quot; Matt pleaded. Hannah rolled her eyes and sighed. She knew he had her best interests in his heart, but she also couldn&#39;t face the possibility of failure.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I know, sorry. I chill out. I do have to go back to my dorm though. Laundry won&#39;t take of itself,&quot; she explained. Matt, resigned in defeat, smiling and waving goodbye to her. If it wasn&#39;t for the fact that school was her topmost priority, there was a possibility that something could happen between the two of them. Unfortunately, Hannah had goals that wouldn&#39;t be accomplished by relaxing.<br />
<br />
As fate would have it, however, those goals would never be accomplished as she made her way outside into the warm spring air. One of our special bugs made its way onto the college campus and was searching for its first victim. Hannah walked right into it as it dove straight for her neck. After all, it was the only skin it could pierce, since even in the warm air, Hannah was practically covered from head to toe. Hannah swatted at her neck in response, shocked by the sting. How were bees were already out, she thought. She shook her head, clearing her mind of the sudden intrusion as she refocused on reviewing her exam material in her head as she walked. For some reason, however, she was finding it more and more difficult to focus on it as her body temperature rose in heat. As she walked into her dorm building and walked up the steps, the heat was beginning to feel unbearable. It couldn&#39;t have been the weather, she thought. Could she be having an allergic reaction to the bee sting? She wasn&#39;t allergic to anything as far as she was aware of, but could that have changed?<br />
<br />
By the time she walked into her room, she was beginning to profusely sweat as she was forced to removed her baggy sweatshirt and jeans. She was glad her roommate wasn&#39;t around. It would have been horrible to strip in front of her like this. Alexis, her roommate, was an intelligent woman like Hannah, but lacked the kind personality of the blonde girl. Unlike Hannah, her redheaded roommate believed she was better than everyone else, and made sure they knew it. If she saw Hannah changing in their room she&#39;d surely humiliate her for it. That&#39;s why for the past year Hannah had been changing in the bathroom to avoid confrontation. She certainly wouldn&#39;t have dared stripping down to her bra and panties in any other situation, but the blonde haired nerdy girl didn&#39;t feel like she had a choice. She was practically boiling in those clothes.<br />
<br />
She was feeling a little better in her current state, but she was still burning up. She considered calling emergency services, but first felt like she had no choice but to remove her current attire. She&#39;d simply hide under the covers if her roommate showed up, she reasoned. It was too hot to wear anything.<br />
<br />
As soon as her underwear fell on the floor, she began to feel immediately better. She was still warm, but now it was a more pleasant feeling, like she was in a sauna or a nice hot tub. She sighed in the nice warmth as she settled onto her bed. This was much better. She should be naked more often, she thought.<br />
<br />
She immediately came to her senses. Where had that thought come from? She was only nude right now because it felt better and as soon as she no longer felt warm anymore, she&#39;d put her clothes back on, right? It only felt so good to be naked right now because of how bad it felt before. She ran her hands along her body as she resettled into the feeling, assured that the rogue thought wouldn&#39;t be acted upon. Most likely. She&#39;d think on it.<br />
<br />
Soon, however, the heat began to shift. The excess heat that enveloped her body before simply redirected itself. She began to squirm as she felt a growing heat coming from her womanhood. Hannah had masturbated in the past but it was mostly due to the scientist in her that wanted to learn and experiment. She didn&#39;t really feel the need to do it for pleasure, so these feelings were quite foreign to her. Unconsciously, she slipped a finger into her pussy, hoping to quell the feeling. The result, however, was the exactly opposite. Touching her nether regions lit a fire in her that she&#39;d never even dreamed of before. She was incredibly horny, and she needed satisfaction.<br />
<br />
As she began shoving more and more fingers within her, the bug&#39;s venom began doing its real work. Hannah actions were causing the hormones in her body to go haywire due to the venom and it was beginning to have its effect on her, physically and mentally. It began with her breasts, which rapidly grew from their previous A cups to a pair natural, perky C cups. As she twisted her enlarged nipples with her other hand, her mind began its changes. She recognized that these sexual actions were so unlike her, but if her sex could make her feel this good, maybe she should be using them more often. She thought back to the many times she caught Matt staring at her, his desires clear. As her hair began getting longer and fuller, she giggled. Maybe next time she&#39;d give him a better show, she thought. It was so unfair that all he got to do was watch.<br />
<br />
By some stroke of luck, a familiar knock appeared on her door. She and Matt had developed a specific way to knock on her door so she knew that it was him knocking and not one of Alexis&#39; bitchy friends. The knock broke her out of her ministrations as a naughty smile appeared on her face. Perfect, she thought. Now she could quickly make it up to him for all the times she left him with blue balls. Without bothering to put on clothes, she went up and opened the door.<br />
<br />
Matt nearly choked on his breath as he saw the sight in front of him. Hannah, his all business, shy and nerdy friend, was now naked and panting as she put everything on display for him. It was clear that her tits had grown significantly, as did her hair, now a wavy, luscious bright blonde that was now at the middle of her back.<br />
<br />
&quot;I, uh, you -- what? Um, calculator,&quot; he squeaked as he held up Hannah&#39;s calculator in offering. Hannah looked a calculator for a mere second before taking it, tossing it in her room and wrapping her arms around him for a sloppy french kiss, closing the door behind him. They made out on their way to Hannah&#39;s bed, her lips getting fuller and fuller with every kiss. Matt ran his hands along her body, which was beginning to feel more toned by the second. As she pushed him onto the bed and began unbuttoning his jeans, Matt finally found his voice. &quot;What happened to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m just taking your advice to relax at heart. Besides, you were right? School&#39;s boring most of the time anyways,&quot; Hannah explained as pushed down his jeans and took his dick in her mouth. Matt was about to question and protest until he felt his best friend&#39;s amazing technique. Hannah had never even seen a dick before except in textbook diagrams, but it sure didn&#39;t seem like it as she deep-throated him like a pro. As she stared up at him with her brilliant blue eyes, she realized what a slut she was. Not that that was a bad thing, she mused. Being a slut sounded so much better than something dumb like winning a nobel prize. How dumb of her to pursue something so boring, she thought as her hair reached its final height, resting on top of her cute, pear shaped ass. Sex was so much more fun. She realized she wanted to drop her biology major as she popped her lips off of Matt&#39;s cock and stood up for her next act. It wasn&#39;t that she wasn&#39;t smart, it was just that being in such a time consuming major would cut into her time of looking good and feeling great.<br />
<br />
As she straddled Matt with her long, luxurious legs and toned, sexy figure, she nestled his cock in her now hairless twat. The new Hannah let out a slutty gasp in pleasure as she felt the fullness in her pussy. This felt amazing. Why hadn&#39;t she done it sooner? That was obvious; it was because she was a prude before and couldn&#39;t realize her true calling. No more, she thought to herself. She was the new Hannah. She was a slutty, blonde haired, blue eyed bombshell and no more would academics get in the way of her feeling great.</p>
