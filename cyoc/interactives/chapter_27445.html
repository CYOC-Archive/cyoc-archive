<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Katie was on edge the whole way back to the campsite. She started at every odd sound she heard, including a few that Paul had to admit he hadn't. He humored her simply because it seemed to reassure, but privately he was more than a little unnerved by how shaken she seemed.<BR>
<BR>
They finally arrived, Katie's dark brown locks hanging wild and manelike about her face, still tousled by whatever scare she'd suffered in her side-trip she'd been shuffled off to. She'd clutched Paul's hand like a lifeline the whole way, and he'd become increasingly aware of her nails digging into his palm, the curving shapes of them feeling almost sharp.<BR>
<BR>
She relinquished her grasp as they reached the fire ring, letting him kneel down and begin his ministrations at rekindling the blaze they'd shared the night before.<BR>
<BR>
As he worked at gathering the kindling and rearranging the logs, Katie paced nervously, wringing her hands.<BR>
<BR>
"Maybe we should've stayed with the group," she said with a bit of trembling in her voice.<BR>
<BR>
"They'll be back soon enough," Paul asserted, finally managing to coax a flame that started to spread.<BR>
<BR>
He smiled to Katie as the fire flared up, spreading light about the campsite. The disheveled girl seemed to recoil oddly, flames reflecting in her eyes and making them seem almost orange-gold as she bared teeth that looked too angular, nearly sharp.<BR>
<BR>
"You alright Kay?" Paul asked with a quirked brow.<BR>
<BR>
"Yeah I just... I think I'm gonna take a walk. Clear my head."<BR>
<BR>
"You sure you'll be alright on your own?" He said with some confusion.<BR>
<BR>
"I'll be fine." She said simply. "I won't be long."<BR>
<BR>
"Well okay," Paul said reluctantly. "I'll be here."<BR>
<BR>
Katie gave a clipped nod, spinning on her heel and stalking off for the woods, the breeze blowing back her hair to show an ear tapered to a twitching point...
<BR>
<HR>
<BR>
Shanna and Anna had parted ways with Jack after the trail ended, the dark-haired girl sparing him one more amber-eyed stare before they walked off.<BR>
<BR>
Shanna chuckled, her hand entwining with Anna's after they were out of sight. "So unfair to the poor boy. Emily's a big girl."<BR>
<BR>
"Old habits," Anna said, starting to relax.<BR>
<BR>
"Your little detour was the 'witches,' wasn't it?" Shanna asked curiously.<BR>
<BR>
"Yeah, nice little touch after the beer, I thought."<BR>
<BR>
"Me too. Did you accept?"<BR>
<BR>
"Hell yeah I accepted," Anna quipped with a toothy, almost feral grin. "Seemed fun enough, really."<BR>
<BR>
Shanna laughed. "So we're like sorority sisters now or something."<BR>
<BR>
"Or something," Anna replied breathily, her amber gaze looking Shanna over.<BR>
<BR>
Shanna bit her lip at the shameless ogling she received, canines hooked over lips that seemed darkened like a bruise.<BR>
<BR>
"Always where you least expect it, eh?" She said with some uncertainty.<BR>
<BR>
"That's what makes it so nice," Anna answered, reaching out to clasp the blonde's other hand and backing the object of her interest against a tree.<BR>
<BR>
They spent a moment in reverie, nostrils flaring as they took in each other's heady, musky scents. Shanna's ears slowly wormed their way through her hair, fleshy points poking forth from between wavy honey-colored strands that seemed to creep out longer, inching out from her head. Her dark-haired companion rolled her head on her shoulders, joints popping as a widow's peak began to jut from her hairline.<BR>
<BR>
Then their gazes locked, their eyes a perfect match, amber framed by darkened lids. An unspoken understanding was reached, steamy breath escaping between ivory fangs for but a heartbeat before they set onto each other hungrily.<BR>
<BR>
Kissing quickly deepened savagely, gasps for breath accented by snarls as hands turned to fevered groping. Their hair tumbled down as prudence failed, wet pops resounding in their chests and legs as they explored this new emotion with increased abandon.<BR>
<BR>
Their sudden closeness was sharply punctuated by Anna's eager hands tearing open the front of Shanna's shirt, revealing a thick ruff of honey-blonde fur.<BR>
<BR>
Shanna stared in amazement at what the dark-haired girl had revealed, looking first at the growth on herself, then to the black tufts that blossomed from Anna's cheeks.<BR>
<BR>
"What... what are we?" She asked.<BR>
<BR>
Anna was able to answer in a word.<BR>
<BR>
"Better."
<BR>
<HR>
<BR>
Jack had waited at the end of the trail for Emily. It was against his better judgment certainly, as his bombast easily flagged with nobody there to impress, and he found himself more than a little spooked as he waited alone.<BR>
<BR>
However the recent memory of their enthusiastic makeout session had bolstered his courage, and had definitely dispelled his notions about finding a girl without such an overbearing friend.<BR>
<BR>
Besides which, Anna wouldn't be looking over his shoulder tonight.<BR>
<BR>
Finally he heard footsteps grinding in the mulch of the trail. Turning about, a broad grin spread across his face.<BR>
<BR>
"Hey babe, missed you."<BR>
<BR>
"Feeling's mutual," her coy response came as she stepped out of the shadow of the trees.<BR>
<BR>
They closed the distance between them, and shared a lingering kiss. Jack however pressed for more, earning a sharp shove from Emily.<BR>
<BR>
"<B>Don't</B> touch me there."<BR>
<BR>
"But I was just-"<BR>
<BR>
His sentence was cut off by a slap tipped by sharp nails, leaving a trail down his cheek which quickly began to bleed.<BR>
<BR>
"<B>Don't</B>." She turned around and started back for her campsite.<BR>
<BR>
"Whatever..." Jack said, and wearily started after her, clutching his cheek and trying to think of a way to salvage his situation.<BR>
<BR>
<HR>
<BR>
A beast with dark-brown fur strode out of the woods and onto the rocks, shrugging off a scrap of cloth as she knelt down on the outcropping.<BR>
<BR>
This was the place, she was sure of it. Surer than she was of a lot of things, vague thoughts of someone she'd left back in the woods nagging at her moon-addled mind.<BR>
<BR>
Gazing out over the valley, she watched the campfires wink out one by one. After the last was snuffed, she raised her lips skyward.<BR>
<BR>
Her cry echoed in the trees, and it did not take long for it to be answered.<BR>
<BR>
Huddled in the tent Paul heard a chorus of wolf howls and felt very much alone...</p>
