<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I don&#39;t understand&quot; Mia said rubbing the sleep from her eyes.  Having just woken up, her parents were in her room explaining the plan for Eric, Mia and Amy to leave town for a while.  &quot;What time is it?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s early, 5:00 and we should be on the road in 30 minutes&quot; Amy replied.<br />
<br />
Mia reached up and rubbed her head and yawned.  She pulled at the shoulder length red hair and felt her face.  &quot;Yuck&quot; she said.  &quot;I thought it was a dream.  Do we have to?&quot; she whined<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes&quot; replied James.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a nice place Mia&quot; James said trying to maintain eye contact, distracted by the massive cleavage and thick and hard nipples straining against her tank top.  James had known and worked closely with Jules for nearly 8 years and had never seen her (or rather her body) in nothing except work attire.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Come on sweetie, just brush your teeth and we will get some breakfast along the way.&quot;  Amy said looking around Mia&#39;s room for things she might want to take.  Like Eric, Mia had fallen asleep very early and quickly last night.<br />
<br />
Mia slid out of bed and stood unsteadily.  &quot;My back hurts&quot; she said arching backward with her hands on her hips.<br />
<br />
James looked away as this only further emphasized everything he was trying to not see.  Mia was very immature and she had not yet grown up enough to understand the allure and power of femininity.  &quot;I should go start putting things into the car&quot; he quickly blurted out.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Would you wake Eric?&quot; Amy asked a little perturbed and giving James a look.<br />
<br />
James looked again at Mia who was still stretching her back, now by bending over and trying to touch her toes.  One of her breasts had popped out from beneath the tank top.  &quot;I uh...I think you can handle it&quot; he said and left abruptly.<br />
<br />
Mia stood upright and scratched her head and Amy understood why James fled the room.  She walked over to Mia and adjusted her top because a large portion of the aureola of her left breast was exposed.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll get you some proper underwear when we get to the lake house, but first go brush your teeth.  Is there anything you want to take?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mia looked around and grabbed a small stuffed animal and her MP3 player and then headed to the bathroom as her mother asked her.  &quot;Oh, here&quot; Amy said and handed Mia a pair of glasses.<br />
<br />
Amy walked across the hall to Eric&#39;s room.  She knocked softly and opened the door turned on the light.<br />
<br />
The sleeping woman groaned  as she rolled onto her back blinking and squinting in the bright light.  &quot;Mom, what the hell?&quot; she said angrily.<br />
<br />
Confused Eric tried to sit up, only instead of sitting up, his legs lifted slightly. Eric grunted and he rocked a couple of times and then gave up, rolling onto his side first before swinging his legs over the edge of the mattress where his black clothed legs and pale feet dangled several inches above the floor.<br />
<br />
The shifting masses of flesh on his chest settled into place moments after he managed to sit up.  &quot;Oh God&quot; he groaned and looked over at his mom as he sat there hunched over with a messy mass of red hair falling over his face and hands.<br />
<br />
Amy felt badly for Eric.  The adjustment physically from a fit, strong adolescent boy to a middle aged woman had to be one of the most opposite of things.  She thought of the alternative, that both Eric and Mia could have been lost forever or worse, trapped as mere objects of post consumer waste.<br />
<br />
Amy laid out the plan for Eric, who was almost relieved to be leaving.  The thought of Rachel or his friends seeing him like this was bothering him.  This way he could still communicate with his social connections by text.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can&#39;t  tell them where you are, you understand that right&quot; Amy asked.<br />
<br />
Eric nodded.  &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I don&#39;t want anyone to see me like....this&quot; he said  &quot;It won&#39;t be a problem and while we&#39;re gone, Dad will probably find a way to make us normal again.&quot; <br />
<br />
Amy didn&#39;t have the heart to tell him that it might take a long time before James could do anything, and she really didn&#39;t want to tell him now that getting his real body back is not possible.  She just smiled a fake smile.  &quot;Good&quot; she said and walked over to his closet.<br />
<br />
Amy grabbed some of his hoodies and t shirts.  Eric had a large frame and at about 6&#39;1, his clothing would be large enough that his t shirts and hoodies could be worn by Mia and Eric to both sleep in and wear around the lake house.   &quot;This takes care of tops&quot; she said to herself and noted that when she could shop, all she would need to purchase would be some underwear and bottoms.<br />
<br />
Eric took a deep breath and slid off of the bed planting both feet on the floor.  Slowly he stood and grimaced.  &quot;I hurt all over&quot; he said trying to stretch his back, while also trying to not stick his chest out.<br />
<br />
Amy walked over and kissed him on the forehead. &quot;Go brush your teeth so we can go&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric looked up at his mom.  &quot;Mom I&#39;m scared&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
Amy smiled.  &quot;It will be OK, you can text Rachel when we get on the road&quot;  She caught a whiff of BO as she stood close to him and not looking forward to a long car ride she suggested he take a very quick shower.  &quot;Here&quot; she said &quot;Put this on after&quot; She handed him a long sleeved t shirt.<br />
Eric paused &quot;You mean shower? Naked?&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy rolled her eyes.  &quot;Eric, you smell like a dressing room at the gym, and, um well we will  talk more later but hygiene, at this time...um for you like...uhhh &#39;this&#39;... is a higher priority now than it...was....if you know what I mean.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric stood there horrified.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Ok&quot; she said and took a deep breath.  &quot;Quickly...wash everything except your hair, it will take too long to rinse and we need to hurry out of here.  Use soap but...um just on the outside...of...well...you know... your body.&quot;  Amy felt that she was out of breath.<br />
<br />
Eric walked slowly to the bathroom.  &quot;But what about pants?&quot; he asked <br />
<br />
Amy shook her head, for now just put those back on.  I&#39;ll shop for some sweats after we get there.<br />
<br />
Eric huffed angry and stomped to the bathroom where Mia was still in there brushing her teeth.<br />
<br />
Eric pounded on the door.  &quot;Hurry up dweeb&quot; he said.  Mia opened the door.  &quot;I&#39;m almost done&quot; she said  &quot;I&#39;m brushing my hair.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mia&quot; Amy said, &quot;You do that in room.  Let your brother in so he can shower.&quot;  To which Mia burst out laughing.  The thought of her stupid jock brother showering in the body of a girl thoroughly amused her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up dweeb&quot; Eric grumbled.  &quot;Mom, tell her to stop&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
Amy raised her voice.  &quot;Mia, stop laughing at your brother and get ready&quot;<br />
<br />
Mia opened the door all the way walked out with smile on her face. Eric punched her on her shoulder as she passed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Owwwww!  MOMMY, ERIC HIT ME!&quot; Mia yelled rubbing her shoulder and pushed Eric causing him to slam backward into the opposite wall.  His butt providing more than enough cushion to cause any damage.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eric!  Mia!&quot; Amy yelled &quot;Stop it now and get ready&quot;.<br />
<br />
Mia was taken aback.  She had actually shoved Eric into the wall, something should could have never done before.  &quot;I&#39;m sorry Eric...I didn&#39;t mean to.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric gritted his teeth and stormed into the bathroom and closed the door and immediately broke down crying. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why am I crying?&quot; he said to himself and looked into the mirror.  The blurry image of a red faced woman, with red bed head looked back at him.  Eric wiped his eyes and realized he needed to pee badly.  Thankful his mother hadn&#39;t brought it up, he shimmied and pulled the black leggings down his thick hips, thighs and calves until they rested on his feet and floor and stood there in front of the toilet.  Eric knew what he had to do and gently, well tried to gently sit down on the seat.  His thighs were not as strong as he was used to and gave way about midway down causing him to plop suddenly onto the cold seat.  He froze as his nose caught strong odor...an odor he had only smelled on Rachel, a mixture of the sweet scent of vagina and pungent smell of urine and ass wafted up from his lap. An involuntary trickle of urine escaped into the bowl and stopped, something he was not prepared for.  He sat there looking straight ahead, not wanting to look down, not wanting to see anything.  Closing his eyes he imagined what it &quot;was&quot; like to pee.  Relaxing and letting out a deep breath, a sudden hiss of hot urine sprayed out from beneath him and it was over as quickly as it started.  The sensitive flesh below felt wet, and not wanting to deal with it right now, Eric chose to delay the inevitable and stood without wiping, droplets of urine struck his inner thigh.  Kicking off the leggings that were bunched up around his ankles he leaned over to start the water for the shower and froze as cool air hit damp parts of his body from behind that he didn&#39;t recognize nor did he want to.  The large breasts dangled and swayed under his t shirt as he adjusted the faucet to a comfortable temperature.  Stripping off the t shirt he tossed it onto the vanity.  Doing so he accidentally caught his reflection in the mirror.<br />
<br />
Jule&#39;s body wasn&#39;t, or didn&#39;t appear to be that fat, it just &quot;felt&quot; that way.  The breasts bobbled and hung low against his torso that had a surprisingly narrow (compared with his hips and ass) waist.  Large pink aureola and thick crinkled nipples with about a thick as the  tip of his pinky faced straight out like fried eggs.  Thighs thick and pale tapered down to chubby knees, with an unruly red bush crowning at the apex resting below a soft belly.  An 8 inch scar ran horizontally across the pale skin of his abdomen below a sunken bellybutton.  &quot;Appendix?&quot; Eric wondered and realizing he had seen enough, turned away and stepped into the shower.<br />
&quot;Come on Dad&quot; he muttered &quot;Get me out of this&quot;</p>
