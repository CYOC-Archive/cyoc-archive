<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the family adjusted their eyes from the flash, Ty became invisible and placed the phone on their table as he prepared to watch the change unfold before him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where&#39;d that boy go?&quot; The mother asked. &quot;He probably left after cringing at our stupid photo.&quot; Susie said<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the family felt a chill go down their spines. &quot;What was that?&quot; Frank asked. Alex soon started to notice Susie&#39;s feet through her flip flops. Her nails were black and long, and the bottom of her feet had puffy pads grown on them, like some kind of dog.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, Susie?&quot; Alex asked. &quot;Not now twerp.&quot; She responded. The weak conversation was broken when the mother suddenly gasped. &quot;F-Frank, what&#39;s wrong with your arm?!&quot; Frank looked down at his arms and soon notices that it was a lot of white hair growing before his eyes. &quot;What the hell?!&quot; He shouted.<br />
<br />
Billy&#39;s teeth began to grow sharper as a long orange and black tail grew from his backside. &quot;Wow!&quot; He said, &quot;I&#39;m going to be a strong tiger!&quot; Meanwhile Katie was going through some similar changes, se grew brown fur all over her body and her hands and feet reshaped into hooves. &quot;I&#39;m going to be princess of the forest!&quot; She shouted happily, &quot;Yay!&quot;<br />
<br />
The mother was not enjoying her changes as much. Her feet grew extremely long ad burst through her shoes, her big toe receding up to her ankle, she assumed a more squatted position and her belly grew a bit more round, as well as growing a pouch. A large tail burst out of her pants, helping her maintain balance. And fine brown hairs grew all over her body. Her torso grew taller and her breasts receded into her chest. Her head reformed into a more marsupial looking muzzle and her ears stretched and reshaped to match her head. She was now a Kangaroo.<br />
<br />
Franks changes proceeded as his wife&#39;s finished. He began to put on weight, his whole body bloated to match a more lazy animal. The white fur on his arms spread all over his body, with the exception of some black spots. His ands and feet reshaped into paws and his face pushed into a short muzzle, his teeth flattened for favor of a more vegan diet. Finally his ears moved to the top of his head and turned black. Frank was now a Panda<br />
<br />
Susie was a bit more oblivious to her changes. While she was texting, she felt a bit taller, due to her feet reshaping into canine paws, knocking off her pink flip flops, the black pads filled out about a half inch. her nose turned large, blocky, wet, and black. And a waft of the food in the restaurant hit her like a train. Her tongue soon flattened out and grew very long, sticking out of the side of her now blackening lips past her chin, drool dropping off the tip. She was texting her friend Lucy and was completely oblivious to any of her changes until she felt a tugging at the back of her pants. She turned around quickly and felt her long tongue slap the side of her neck. &quot;Blewwgh!&quot; She screamed, picking it up with her now harrier looking hands, &quot;Whaf tfha fphufk?!&quot; She looked down to her feet, screamed, and fell to her butt, sitting on her new appendage, a long grey and white tail. She howled in pain as she looked over her hands, black pads like her feet began to fill out on her hands, her thumb receded to her forearm, and fine grey fur grew from her arms and spread over her changing body. Her ears became triangular and sat at the top of her head. Her face pushed out into a long, thick muzzle. Her teeth grew sharp. And finally her back cracked, leaving her on a now more canine position. Ty felt like picking on her so he whispered &quot;Boobs, butt.&quot; Her small furry but began to fill out until it looked like two fuzzy melons grew on her butt, fat and squeezable for maximum pleasure. Finally she felt something odd underneath her boobs, the extra pairs of nipples she grew during the transformation began to swell along with her original pair, soon becoming filled with warm milk, they all grew to DD size, looking ridiculous for humans, but a godsend for mates. Susie was now a wolf in heat.<br />
<br />
Alex&#39; s change began when Susie&#39;s finished she got goosebumps all over his body except for his legs, and small brown feathers poked out of them, covering his whole body. His eyes widened as far as try could open and soon started to expand, growing wider and wider, his irises became black as the white of his eyes changed to yellow, he suddenly was not able to blink. His arms reshaped as his fingers turned into large feathers becoming two light wings. His legs became yellow chalices and small claws grew from his toes, speaking of which, his big toe climbed to his leg and his pinky did a 180 to the back of his foot. His head rounded out to be just as wide as his body and two horn-like feathers grew at the top of his head. Finally, his lips became hard and repositioned downwards to a curved beak, and he shrunk to about 2 feet tall. Alex was now an Owl.<br />
<br />
Katie&#39;s changes soon continued. Her neck grew long and fur started to grow all over it. Her back cracked and she was forced to a quadrupedal stance on her hooves. Her head reshaped into a sort of triangular shape as her head pushed out into a muzzle and her ears grew upwards, her nose became blocky and black. A small tuft of a tail grew on her backside  and her change was complete. Katie was now a Doe<br />
<br />
Unlike the others, Billy was exited about his changes. His hands grew large pads as they grew into large tiger paws, his feet followed a similar path, he sat on his new haunches as he watched his body become more muscular, as well as powerful. His limbs thickened with muscle and orange and black striped fur grew all over his new body. His head reshaped to fit his more hunter-like animal and his ears grew rounded and moved to the top of his head. Black claws grew on his paws and his back cracked to once again change stances. Billy was now a full grown Tiger.<br />
<br />
The whole family looked like they escaped from the zoo. Standing in the restaurant was a Kangaroo, a Panda, a Wolf Bitch, an Owl, a Doe, and a Tiger.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately for Susie. Buster, the family Great Dane&#39;s penis soon grew erect and he mounted Susie, with extra pleasure from her filled out butt. He locked his hips and began to pulse into his bitch. Her milky boobs dripped and swung in the air as her long, pink tongue was hanging out past her chin. A wolf bitch in heat<br />
<br />
The mother did a head count to make sure everybody was accounted for. &quot;O-Okay, let&#39;s see, uh... Frank?&quot; &quot;Here.&quot; A low voice responded, she looked to the panda. &quot;Okay, Alex?&quot; &quot;Here&quot; a nerdy voice responded she liked up to the owl who was perched on one of the building&#39;s supports, still wearing his glasses. &quot;Great, Katie?&quot; &quot;Here!&quot; A cheery voice responded, she looked to the doe who was enjoying what was left of her pancakes. &quot;Okay, Billy.&quot; &quot;AWW YEAH!&quot; Billy roared from across the room. She gasped at the tiger that was once her son. &quot;O-Okay then... Uh... Where&#39;s Susie?&quot; She soon heard a howl from beneath a table. She gasped loudly. &quot;BUSTER! GET OFF SUSIE!&quot; She pulled the pair out from under the table and tried to remove Buster from fucking her daughter who was in complete ecstasy.<br />
<br />
Yet unknown to them, Ty called the local zoo for some escaped animals. And the door soon burst open.</p>
