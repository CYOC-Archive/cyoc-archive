<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I don’t understand.” Xarxos stared up at the young Hispanic woman astride a dragon.<br />
<br />
“Oh, I think I do.” Trog nodded to himself. “That’s what RK was trying to tell us. Sebastian isn’t…the real Owner of the Book of Myth.”<br />
<br />
Sophia smiled. “Sebastian isn’t real. Never was.”<br />
<br />
“Could have been that too, yeah.” Trog shrugged. “Guess we’ll never know.”<br />
<br />
Sophia rolled her eyes.<br />
<br />
Trog started walking backwards, glancing behind him every few seconds, searching for the reflecting pool. Xarxos naturally backed up with him, though Trog was sure he had no idea why.<br />
<br />
“When the cartel enslaved me, they gave me a little room, just big enough for a bare mattress, with a ripped bed-sheet in place of a door.” Sophia’s dragon stalked forward, keeping pace. “They’d inject me with heroin and beat me if I refused to spread my legs for the johns. Good behaviour got you more heroin.”<br />
<br />
“When I was very young my mother read to me. Before she died. There was a book about a young abused boy who became a wizard. I hoped I was special, that an owl would come and I’d be taken away. But no owls came to rescue me.“ Sophia shrugged. “I’d pray. No one came to save me. I started hallucinating, I imagined someone who loved me and would be there for me, someone who could save me. I called him Sebastian.”<br />
<br />
Behind her, Trog spotted Mark running towards them, waving his arms and shouting something. Xarxos saw him too, spared him only a glance, and nudged Trog to keep looking at Sophia. Trog dragged his gaze away from Mark, concentrating on Sophia as she monologued.<br />
<br />
“And it continued like that for two years. And then, when I was sixteen, I found a Book next to my mattress. I was so high I could barely read. But I spoke one word out loud: Summon.” Tears trickled down her face. “And then he was there. Sebastian. And he picked me up and carried me to this loft. And then he killed anyone who came after me. And then I was in so much pain when the withdrawal started.”<br />
<br />
“He begged me to let him have the Book so he could fix me.” Sophia bit her lip. “I made him promise that if he couldn’t protect me, the Book would be mine again. He agreed. And then, suddenly, nothing hurt anymore. Life got better and better. But the wealthier we got, the more protective Sebastian became. In the end, I was locked in a tower in our mansion.”<br />
<br />
“He got a bit complacent around me and I managed to snag the Book.” Sophia smiled. “I summoned a witch that could send me to other Owner’s dreams. I made up a story-part lie, part truth-and gave my location to them. I hoped someone would come save me, or kill Sebastian and free me. He’d gone too far. I was a prisoner again.”<br />
<br />
They made it to the reflecting pool.<br />
<br />
“So why do you want the Books?” Trog asked. <br />
<br />
“Because look at you two.” Sophia rolled her eyes. “Seriously? At least Mark has a professional world builder working with him to maintain consistency.”<br />
<br />
Trog took a step towards her, closer to the pool. “Sophia, you can join as as a Book Owner and AS A TEAM, we can win this. Going solo is a bad play, you need to trust me on that.”<br />
<br />
“Trust you? You’re about to step into a permanent portal to Loch Ness, and I’m supposed to trust you?”<br />
<br />
“Uh, Sebastian’s dead, so…” Trog stepped back.<br />
<br />
“The house and all other permanent enchantments still exist.” Sophia rolled her eyes. “His summons disappeared. That’s all. I don’t even know where half the traps are.”<br />
<br />
“Are we fighting, then?” Trog asked.<br />
<br />
“I think so.” Sophia nodded. “Would you two like to stay together? I think Trog would make a very pretty Nymph and you’d make a handsome satyr, Xarxos. More in line with a guy who runs a sex toy line.”<br />
<br />
“Aren’t you going to kill us?” Xarxos asked.<br />
<br />
“I’m not my brother.” Sophia said. “But if you try killing me, this dragon has you dead to rights. Spell-off?”<br />
<br />
“Spell-off?” Trog asked.<br />
<br />
“It’s a duel. We cast spells at each other. Whoever gets reality changed first, wins.”<br />
<br />
Trog did some calculations in his head. There had to be some way to end this fight without murdering Sophia. If he fucked up, he’d be enjoying his new satyr husband’s cock in his brand new pussy. There were worse fates. At least he’d be able to have sex.<br />
<br />
“Xarxos, do you still have that Gryphon phallus?” Trog whispered.<br />
<br />
“Yes. And? Do you want tits? Because fighting her is a good way to get tits.” Xarxos whispered. “I don’t want to become some sex-crazed satyr. Let’s just hand her the Books. We settle this calmly and rationally like adults.”<br />
<br />
“Seriously, you think we should just give her our Books? We don’t even know her!”<br />
<br />
“I gave you my Book.” Xarxos pointed out. “And we ended up working things out.”<br />
<br />
“Listen babe, you heard her.” Trog glanced at Sophia, who was scanning the area for Sam. “She’s off her rocker, as they say. I’m as sympathetic as anyone else to a human trafficking victim but she’s clearly unstable.”<br />
<br />
“She did threaten us.” Xarxos nodded.<br />
<br />
“Why though?” Trog frowned. “She could have happily thanked us. Played the long game. Is it just me or does she seem kinda…I dunno…”<br />
<br />
“Desperate?” Xarxos replied.<br />
<br />
“Exactly.” Trog nodded. “But why?<br />
<br />
“I don’t know.” Xarxos whispered. “What I do know is that I don’t have a Book. She’s far enough away that if she whispers, I get reality shifted. And then who the fuck is left who remembers us like we were?”<br />
<br />
“What do you mean?”<br />
<br />
“Do you remember how we first met? The very first time we met?”<br />
<br />
“No.”<br />
<br />
“Exactly. Only RK and I remember. And now RK is gone, so it’s basically just me.”<br />
<br />
“Are you boys done talking?” Sophia interrupted. “It’s time to make your decision. Hand ‘em over or prepare for a fight. I’ll give you ten seconds. 9... 8...7…”<br />
<br />
“I-” Trog started to say.<br />
<br />
The sound of gunshots rang in the air.<br />
<br />
*BAM* *BAM*<br />
<br />
Sophia clutched her chest and fell off her dragon. She lay in the grass, unmoving.<br />
<br />
The dragon disintegrated in a cloud of golden motes.<br />
<br />
Trog and Xarxos stared at the girl lying dead on the other side of the pool. Mark screamed, running to her, trying to do CPR. But Trog had seen the blood spray from her back. Two hits, center mass. She was a goner.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br />
<br />
“I gotta thank y’all for that.” Sam spoke up from behind them, stepping out from behind a big Cypress tree. “Do you have any idea how long I had to wait to make my move?”<br />
<br />
They turned. <br />
<br />
Sam was grinning, aiming a subcompact machine-gun at their faces. He was still as handsome and nondescript as when they’d seen him last. Less flat, though.<br />
<br />
“Hands in the air please.” Sam smiled. “Take your clothes off.”<br />
<br />
“You’re dead!” Xarxos said, astonishment clear on his bullish features.<br />
<br />
“Was.” Sam shrugged. “For some reason, my Auditor let my soul go. Now strip. Ain’t gonna tell you twice.”<br />
<br />
Trog and Xarxos slowly undressed.<br />
<br />
“Where’s the Books?” Sam asked.<br />
<br />
Trog purposefully glanced at his pile of clothes.<br />
<br />
“No idea.” Trog shrugged.<br />
<br />
Sam smiled. “Of course you’d say that. Step towards me.”<br />
<br />
Trog dutifully stepped forward.<br />
<br />
Sam raised the gun. “Turn around. Slowly, fat man.”<br />
<br />
Trog went red but did as he was told.<br />
<br />
“You found a working gun?” Trog asked.<br />
<br />
“I did. Armory had a few.<br />
<br />
Trog twitched a finger. “Object.”<br />
<br />
Sam pulled the trigger. <br />
<br />
A B.B. hit Trog in the forehead. He hissed and grasped the welt on his head.<br />
<br />
“You sunovabitch!” Sam charged him, beating him over the head with the fake gun.<br />
<br />
Trog held his hands up, trying to ward off the furious blows Sam rained down upon him.<br />
<br />
Then, suddenly, Sam was lifted off his feet and flung through the air into the reflecting pool. Xarxos stood over Trog, chest heaving.<br />
<br />
Sam plunged much deeper than a foot-high pond should be. The water was icy cold and he could see something dark deep below him. It was growing in size. He kicked up to the surface.<br />
<br />
“Stop! Don’t let me die!” Sam eyed Xarxos. “Tex! Please!”<br />
<br />
Xarxos looked at Trog. “You have, like five seconds before he gets eaten.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t want him coming back again.’”Trog sighed, pointed at Sam, and whispered. “Inanimate.”<br />
<br />
Sam stiffened and bobbed in the water.<br />
<br />
“Object.” Trog pointed.<br />
<br />
The mannequin shifted and changed, transforming into an enormous chew toy.<br />
<br />
The monster rose from beneath, the chew toy squeaking. Xarxos thought they sounded rather a lot like screams of terror. Then the monster dove below the surface, and the reflection pool returned to its normal, foot deep state.<br />
<br />
Trog sighed. “Help me over to Sophia.”<br />
<br />
Xarxos picked up his obese husband and trotted to where Mark was attempting to bandage Sophia’s wounds.<br />
<br />
She was staring up at the sky, eyes unblinking. Trog picked up the Book of Myth and turned it into a guiche ring and shoved it in his pants. He gasped as his existing ring grew heavier.<br />
<br />
“Where are the others?” Trog asked Mark.<br />
<br />
“...Others?” Mark stared at him. “Oh, the Books? Over there.”<br />
<br />
Trog walked over to some saddlebags that were strewn on the ground, now without a steed. <br />
<br />
“Wait, what are you doing?” Mark yelled. “Heal her! She’s dying!”<br />
<br />
“I know.” Trog said. “But she can wait.”<br />
<br />
He dug through the saddlebags and pulled out the Book of Beasts and the Book of Divination. He transformed them into piercings too. He hesitated, but ended up plunging them down into his pants as well. The heavy pressure on his cock and balls made him gasp.<br />
<br />
Xarxos raised a brow.<br />
<br />
“I’ll change them back into Books later.” Trog glanced at the dying woman and pointed at her. “Heal.”<br />
<br />
He fell onto his generous ass as the energy left him. <br />
<br />
Sophia blinked. Then she coughed. Mark stood next to her, helping her on her feet.<br />
<br />
She stared at Trog. “You won.”<br />
<br />
Trog held a hand out to her. “Wanna join the team?”<br />
<br />
“You want me to join you even after I betrayed you?” Sophia’s eyes were wide. <br />
<br />
“Yeah, well, you clearly need a support network and you like my plays, so…”<br />
<br />
Sophia hugged him. <br />
<br />
Then she frowned. “Are you getting older?”<br />
<br />
“I…” He glanced at Xarxos. “Have always been this way. You must not have noticed.”<br />
<br />
The four of them stared at each other. A cool breeze blew up from the ocean. They only had a couple hours until it got dark.<br />
<br />
“So what now?” Sophia looked around.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, what do us Bookless people do?” Mark asked. The elf looked pretty disheveled.<br />
<br />
“You two can wait for us at our house.” Xarxos said. “Hang out at the pool. You’re welcome to stay in the first floor guest room.”<br />
<br />
“What about you guys?” Mark asked.<br />
<br />
“You take care of Sophia. We’ll try undoing the damage her fake brother caused.” Trog said. “Here, have my card. Go ahead and order pizza or something.”<br />
<br />
“Sweet. See you guys later!” Mark waved and left, Sophia staggering along behind him.<br />
<br />
“Take two vehicles!” Trog called. “Get one that can fit Xarxos!”<br />
<br />
Sophia waved back at them. “Will do!”<br />
<br />
Trog and Xarxos waited until the other two were out of sight. Then they collapsed against each other. <br />
<br />
“You were amazing!” Trog breathed, hugging his handsome husband.<br />
<br />
“You were too.” Xarxos smiled and kissed his lover, rocking back and forth.<br />
<br />
Xarxos’ cock hardened, but he realized that Trog would get no pleasure out of any sex they had. He swallowed. It was time to fix this, and then fix Trog. He’d earned it. Of course, the spell on him had to run its course.<br />
<br />
“Come on, let’s go fix as many people as we can.” Xarxos murmured, breaking the kiss.<br />
<br />
Trog pulled away and nodded. They decided to start with the Hedge. Todd must be in there somewhere.<br />
<br />
<br />
“Our team is back to five.”<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br />
<br />
Todd-or more accurately, the statue formerly known as Todd-thought of nothing but pleasure, his mind awash in an unending, toe-curling orgasm. The fact that he couldn’t move, couldn’t even twitch a furry ear, only heightened his excitement. Cum-water spurted from the tip of his big stone cock, giving him immense relief, yet his balls were always tight and pleasantly aching. His nipple being twisted was an exquisite sort of pleasure and pain in its own right.<br />
<br />
At first, right after the Medusa had altered him so pleasurably, he couldn’t think. An hour later and didn’t want to think, and then two hours ago he stopped thinking about not thinking. He sat in the garden as hours passed unnoticed in a mindless bliss.<br />
<br />
He didn’t notice Xarxos and Trog hobble into the small clearing his fountain sat in. They eyed him, talking with each other, before one of them stepped forward. They said something.<br />
<br />
The fat little satyr’s skin regained its healthy color as it reverted from marble to flesh. He moaned, spurts of hot cum landing in the pool as his final orgasm washed over him. He collapsed onto the pedestal, moaning, cock spent and laying across his fat hairy gut, tiny hooves twitching.<br />
<br />
“Todd?” Xarxos had asked.<br />
<br />
The short, fat little satyr merely moaned mindlessly.Though the pleasure had ended, his brain was blanked, neurons completely shorted out. Happily insane, hips mindlessly thrusting into the air.<br />
<br />
Xarxos ran forward, picking up the fat little satyr in his arms. Tears ran down his face. He stroked his curly hair, patted his cheeks, shook him. The satyr didn’t react, just moaned and ground his hips, eyes rolled up in the back of his head.<br />
<br />
The Minotaur held him in his arms and rocked him like a baby, sobbing.<br />
<br />
“We were too late, babe. He’s gone.” Trog patted Xarxos’ back. “I can turn him back. He might be happier like that.”<br />
<br />
“I promised him!” Xarxos choked back another bout of tears. “I told him I would keep him safe.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I don’t know why you thought bringing him along was a good idea…” Trog muttered.<br />
<br />
The golden dildo lodged in the satyr’s hole cracked and broke. Xarxos and Trog blinked down at the little satyr as golden motes of light began to rise from his form. In a brilliant flash of golden light, he disappeared.<br />
<br />
“What the hell?” Xarxos said.<br />
<br />
“Guess he wasn’t Todd after all.” Trog shrugged.<br />
<br />
“Let’s go. He has to be one of these statues.” Trog and Xarxos left to look for more people to restore.<br />
<br />
“What if he’s a fish? There’s an entire koi pond and Mark said he had an aquarium at his office.” Xarxos said as they stood next to the pool.<br />
<br />
“He won’t be at the office, but that’s another place to check for victims.” Trog shrugged.<br />
<br />
It was a busy day for them.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br />
<br />
When the light faded, the fat little satyr was lying on his hairy back, babbling and moaning incomprehensibly. He fell asleep an hour later. <br />
<br />
It turned out, a little sleep was all he needed.<br />
<br />
When the fat little satyr woke up, he found himself in a glade in the most wonderful place he’d ever seen. Floating islands hovered in the sky, clouds making strange and unique shapes. Colors looked brighter, almost uncannily so. And the smell! The glades were filled with the sent of fresh cut grass, rain, and something alluring, like a spicy lilac.<br />
<br />
The satyr groaned, realizing he was not having an orgasm. His sense of awareness was beginning to return to him. Who was he? Where was he?<br />
<br />
A door opened in the hill next to him, concealed in the tall grass that grew on it. Out stepped a handsome, sandy-haired satyr with great curling horns and a hairy body that would put Adonis to shame. A taut beer-belly and a goat-ish face with hourglass-irises marred his otherwise perfect features. The shorter satyr might have also considered the goat legs a strike against him, but he had goat legs too, so who was he to judge?<br />
<br />
“Ah, you look stunning!” The sandy-haired satyr said.<br />
<br />
“I’m fat, short, and hairy.”<br />
<br />
“Exactly. My perfect mate!”<br />
<br />
“Who am I?” the shorter satyr asked.<br />
<br />
The larger satyr’s eyes widened and a grin spread across his face. “You’re name is Thaddeus. I am Alexandros. You are a satyr and my lover.”<br />
<br />
“Why…” Thaddeus held his head. “Why does my head feel empty?”<br />
<br />
“What was the last thing you remember?” Alexandros asked sweetly out of idle curiosity.<br />
<br />
“Cumming and cumming and cumming.” Thaddeus’ eyes glazed over. “A snake lady.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, mind broken from orgasming for hours.” Alexandros nodded. “Been there, done that, brother! Anyways, You’ll be fine. I’m going to take good care of you.”<br />
<br />
“Really?” Thaddeus looked up into the satyr’s eyes.<br />
<br />
“You’re in my realm within the Asphodel Fields, the nicest neighborhood in all of the Fae World.” Alexandros shrugged. “Believe me, there are worse places.”<br />
<br />
“Oh.” Thaddeus blinked. “I guess so.”<br />
<br />
“Wine?” The satyr held out a wine-skin. “Let’s forget about bad things and live for the moment.”<br />
<br />
Thaddeus reach for the skin and found himself wrapped in his bigger lover’s arms, back pressed against Alexandros’ rugged chest. The satyr shoved the win skin into his mouth. Thaddeus choked an sputtered as wine poured down his throat.<br />
<br />
Then he was roughly shoved to the ground, grass softening the blow. He made to stand when Alexandros’ furred gut suddenly slid up behind him. As soon as Thaddeus had begun to lift himself up off the grass, Alexandros&#39; weight had pushed him back down. The satyr behind him snorted in his ear as he pinned Thaddeus, the smell of alcohol on his breath.<br />
<br />
“I’m going to take you now.” Alexandros snarled.<br />
<br />
Alexandros ground his fat sheathe against the shorter satyr’s rump. Thaddeus panted, inexplicably aroused at the rough humping. He arched his back, rear pressing against the bigger satyr&#39;s plump sheathe.<br />
<br />
&quot;You like that?&quot; Alexandros muttered. His hips slowly ground back against Thaddeus&#39;, causing the younger satyr to gasp.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I do, sir.&quot; Thaddeus bleated pathetically. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sir, huh? I like that.&quot; Alexandros huffed, grinding back even harder as the fat satyr squirmed beneath him. &quot;Why don’t you tell me what you want?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I want you inside me.&quot; Thaddeus whined. <br />
<br />
&quot;You want me inside you…what?&quot; Alexandros grunted, slowly rubbing the tip of his cock against Thaddeus&#39;s soft pucker. “Speak up.”<br />
<br />
&quot;F-fuck me, Sir?&quot; Thaddeus huffed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Better.&quot; Alexandros huffed, shoving his cock into that tight little entrance.<br />
<br />
Thaddeus whined as the larger satyr&#39;s cock slowly spread his cheeks apart.He couldn’t hold back his moans of pleasure. The fat little satyr bleated with satisfaction as he felt Alexandros&#39; shaft slide against his prostate.<br />
<br />
&quot;There we go. You’re so tight.&quot; Alexandros continued to slide his slick red cock into that tight but welcoming pucker.<br />
<br />
Thaddeus gasped, bucking back into the lovely member lodged deep within him.<br />
<br />
Alexandros grabbed his horns and used them as leverage. Thick, furry hips slam down against Thaddeus&#39;s ass, balls slapping in a steady rhythm as Alexandros built up his pace. Each thrust sent Thaddeus rocking forward, plump rear bouncing, his little poofy tail waggling in delight. <br />
<br />
Alexandros bit down on the short little satyr’s hairy shoulder, loving the little gasp of pain. He held Thaddeus down and snorted as he pistoned even harder making those plump cheeks clap. Thaddeus was perfectly made to take his cock, though he would never know it. The golden dildo had been training him even before it absorbed a spell.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, fuck yeah!&quot; Thaddeus huffed below Alexandros, the bigger satyr almost surprised to feel Thaddeus cumming before him. The short satyr’s tail wriggled in ecstasy and his ring winked and squeezed rhythmically. Alexandros&#39;s cock pulsed pleasurably inside his new plaything as he hilted deep into the still-shuddering satyr’s goaty rump.<br />
<br />
Alexandros bleated happily as he came, flooding the shorter satyr’s insides with his seed. He pressed his weight against the soft body below him. His hands rubbed and roamed along the shorter, fatter satyr’s body, massaging his cute little gut and kissing his shoulder, where the bite marks he’d made were still visible. <br />
<br />
&quot;You turned out to be a good investment after all.&quot; Alexandros pulled out, dripping gobs of cum. He rubbed a hand up and down Thaddeus’ torso, pinching and squeezing his fat nipples.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you.&quot; Thaddeus swallowed tightly. <br />
<br />
Thaddeus blushed as he felt Alexandros wipe his cock off on his furry rump, ears folding back. Alexandros inserted his fingers into Thad’s loose hole and curled them. There was a squelching sound as Alexandros rubbed Thad’s prostate.<br />
<br />
Thad’s hooves kicked and he bleated as he came the second time in the last two minutes. Alexandros smeared his messy fingers on Thad’s furry legs. He lifted the wine-skin to Thad’s mouth.<br />
<br />
Thad took a deep drink, enjoying the sweet and sour flavors in his mouth. Alexandros took a swig and swung his arm over Thad’s body. Thad wondered what he was doing until the satyr started snoring.<br />
<br />
The grass was soft, the sun was warm, a a pleasant breeze ruffled the fur on his goat legs. Alexandros was protective, warm, and smelled like musk and sun-kissed sweat and thistle. Thad nestled into his lover’s embrace and drifted off into a happy sleep.<br />
<br />

<br />
It took five hours, the sun was setting, but they’d finally finished scouring the mansion property for salvageable victims. They went to Sebastian’s offices and freed more people form their fishy state. Finally, just as it was about to close, they stood in front of Studio Village.<br />
<br />
Trog and Xarxos walked to the Cerberus’ cage. The dwarf, Trammel, puffed his pipe angrily but ultimately couldn’t stop them from taking his biggest draw.<br />
<br />
“Trog, no matter what happens with Rusty and RK, you need to understand they might not be the same as when we left them.” Xarxos advised.<br />
<br />
“What do you mean?” Trog had raised a graying brow.<br />
<br />
These changes aren’t caused by a Book, they’re caused by magic items and enchantments by beings summoned by the Book. We might only be able to restore them to a facsimile of their former selves.”<br />
<br />
Trog nodded. “Then let’s do it.”<br />
<br />
The Cerberus growled as they approached. Xarxos kept him preoccupied while Trog retreated out of earshot.<br />
<br />
“Divine Shift-Humanoid.” Trog whispered, pointing at the Cerberus.<br />
<br />
The Cerberus yelped and began shrinking, back cracking as it struggled to feet on more humanoid legs. He stopped shrinking at 7 ft tall-big enough to rival Xarxos. He was hugely muscled and kept all three heads. They blinked, intelligence filling their eyes. He stared at Xarxos, a slow smile spreading on the middle face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tex?” Rusty barked happily. “Thank the gods!”<br />
<br />
“It’s Xarxos.. How are you feeling, Rusty?”<br />
<br />
Rusty cocked his head. “It’s Ferrugos.”<br />
<br />
“That’s literally just ‘Rusty’ in ancient Roman.” Xarxos replied.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I was just fucking with you.” Rusty’s head let their tongues loll happily. “Did we win?”<br />
<br />
Xarxos nodded.<br />
<br />
All three heads howled in joy and walked forward, bending the enchanted bars apart with their bare paws and stepped out into the Park. Passersby stared at the extremely well-hung anthroCerberus. Mothers covered their children’s eyes. <br />
<br />
Rusty noticed and whined. “Um, clothes?”<br />
<br />
Trog power walked up. “Yeah, next stop.”<br />
<br />
“Whoa, who’s the old fart?” Rusty asked.<br />
<br />
“Old fart?” Trog puffed out his chest.<br />
<br />
“It’s Trog. Formerly Troy.” Xarxos said. <br />
<br />
“Why’s he so fucking old and fat then?” Rusty snorted, all three head laughing. “No, no no, don’t tell me. You wanted to teach him a lesson or some bullshit?”<br />
<br />
Xarxos strode up to him. “Enough!’<br />
<br />
Rusty socked him full-force in the side of his jaw. The Minotaur staggered, clutching his face. He looked…cowed.<br />
<br />
“What? Bitch, what?” Rusty held his arms out wide. “You think a Minotaur can stop this?”<br />
<br />
“No, but I can. Stop!” Trog pointed at Rusty. “Or you won’t be so tough!”<br />
<br />
Rusty snorted. “You realize you could literally die of a heart attack right now? That’s the risk this dude was willing to take to teach you a lesson. He turned you into a dog. He erased you from existence.”<br />
<br />
Trog lowered his arm. “We’re married.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, well congratulations.” Rusty said sarcastically. “That just makes it all okay then, does it?”<br />
<br />
“The airbnb is a multi-million dollar mansion which we now own and now we’re also basically billionaires.” Trog said. “So, um, calm down and stop punching him.”<br />
<br />
“Fine.” Xarxos huffed, glaring daggers at Rusty. “I accept your apology.”<br />
<br />
“I didn’t apologize.” Rusty’s eyelids lowered. “If you try teaching ME a lesson, I’ll break your neck.”<br />
<br />
“Boys.” Trog warned. “Be civil!”<br />
<br />
They stopped bickering and meandered in awkward silence to the stall the elf had set up previously.<br />
<br />
The elf in question was tall, slender, with platinum blonde hair that ended at the top of his butt. He was impeccably dressed. Next to him, wearing silk pantaloons drawn taut across his ridiculously muscular form, was the biggest, most brutish looking orc Trog had ever seen. RK. A bit of drool dripped from one of his enormous tusks as he watched the crowd.<br />
<br />
“No.” The elf said firmly as soon as he saw them.<br />
<br />
“Yes.” Trog replied.<br />
<br />
“A deal was made and reward was given. He is my property, by thrice made price.” The elf intoned.<br />
<br />
“Understandable.” Rusty said. “What happens if you cease to exist?”<br />
<br />
The elf glowered at him. “I am no mere elf, dog.”<br />
<br />
Xarxos bowed. “I apologize for my companion’s rude behaviour. How about a trade?”<br />
<br />
“What do you have that is worth a mortal’s soul?” The elf smiled.<br />
<br />
“How about an offer to debut your fashion line at the hottest galas in New York and LA?” Trog replied. “Full marketing. We can hash-out contract details later.”<br />
<br />
The elf tapped his chin with one finger. “Intriguing. And how about my exotic materials?”<br />
<br />
“We’ll attempt to factory farm or render a suitable, cost efficient facsimile.” Xarxos said.<br />
<br />
“And as many dumb orcs as you want.” Rusty threw in.<br />
<br />
The elf rolled his eyes. “Fine. Rok, remove your bands.”<br />
<br />
The enormous orc shakily unclasped his armbands. As soon as he did, his skull popped forward. The orc clutched his head as though in pain, mumbling.<br />
<br />
“RK?” Trog asked.<br />
<br />
“That hurts like hell.” The huge orc boomed and vomited on the street. &quot;And the name&#39;s Rok.&quot;<br />
<br />
“Yes, there are some unpleasant side effects to brutification.” The elf murmured. “You may find he is…still fundamentally lacking in IQ. And much of his knowledge is jumbled. He should be back to himself in a few weeks, albeit a bit dumber.”<br />
<br />
The enormous orc stumbled towards them. Xarxos caught him and steadied him. The orc wiped his mouth and looked up.<br />
<br />
“So Todd died, huh?” Rok said.<br />
<br />
“No.” Trog said. “Me and Xarxos looked everywhere for him. Koi ponds, statues, everywhere.”<br />
<br />
“Disappeared.” Xarxos shrugged.<br />
<br />
“Wait a second…” Rok squinted at Trog and then doubled over laughing.<br />
<br />
Trog went red.<br />
<br />
“He really did emasculate you!” Rok snorted, wiping tears from his eyes.<br />
<br />
“Please stop.” Xarxos muttered, ears lowered.<br />
<br />
“Ohohoho, Oh no!“ Rok shook his head and took a deep, shuddering breath. “Okay. Back to Todd. Anything he might have touched?”<br />
<br />
“He had a magic dildo that weird satyr gave him. Kept him aware of everything. Knew who we were instantly. By our old names.” Xarxos said.<br />
<br />
“Ah.” Rok nodded. “He got summoned to the Fae World.”<br />
<br />
“So that lewd satyr statue…” Trog shot Xarxos a glance.<br />
<br />
Xarxos nodded. “Probably Todd. The gorgon was doing finishing touches on him before I took her out.”<br />
<br />
“How do we get to the Fae World?” Trog asked. “We have to rescue him!”<br />
<br />
Rok looked down. “He’s, uh, probably gone.”<br />
<br />
“If your friend was claimed by a Fae and taken to the Fae World, I doubt you’ll be able to get him back.” The elf at the clothing stall said. “Who did it?”<br />
<br />
“Alexandros.” Xarxos said.<br />
<br />
“Hmm. He might be back in a hundred and one years.” The elf shrugged. “If Alexandros chose him, he’s unlikely to return.”<br />
<br />
“Poor Todd.” Trog whispered.<br />
<br />
“Poor?” The elf blinked. “Alexandros is said to rival Pan in his love making abilities! You should envy him. At least he won’t be dying of old age any time soon.”<br />
<br />
“Rude.” Trog muttered.<br />
<br />
“I can change that, if you’d like to take a look at my wares.” The elf smiled.<br />
<br />
Xarxos circled an arm firmly around Trog’s ponderous waist. “That’s a firm no.”<br />
<br />
“That’s more than a little disturbing to me.” The elf eyed the Minotaur. “You intend for your lover to die?”<br />
<br />
“No. You don&#39;t understand the situation.” Xarxos snorted angrily. “So please don’t speak of it.”<br />
<br />
The elf shrugged and spoke to Trog. “If you wish to save yourself…well, I’m a better option than whatever that prude has in store for you.”<br />
<br />
Xarxos dragged Trog away from the infuriating elf.<br />
<br />
“So, I’m fucking tired.” Rusty said, all three heads speaking at once. “Where’s this Airbnb I’ve heard so much about?”<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br />
<br />
Much later that night, once Xarxos and Trog had finished restoring as many people as possible to their original forms, they returned home. Trog glanced around his lovely home happily. The decor was perfect.<br />
<br />
Rok , Rusty, and Mark and Sophia followed them in. Rok and Rusty took it all in with expressions of pure amazement. Trog felt proud that they were so impressed. The original art would probably not have earned this much excitement.<br />
<br />
“It’s nice. Real nice.” Rusty smirked. “Bedroom?”<br />
<br />
“Top floor, first on the right. Rok is on the left.” Xarxos said. “Your things are unpacked and ready. I’ve also procured some more permanent additions to your wardrobes so you aren’t mostly naked.”<br />
<br />
“I’m going to sleep.” Rok declared. “Don’t wake me up. I have a migraine.”<br />
<br />
“I’m going to take a shower and wash the stink of the cage off me and then passing out too.” Rusty said. “Goodnight guys.”<br />
<br />
&quot;What about us?&quot; Mark asked.<br />
<br />
Sophia was looking around now. She&#39;d brought her things.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sophia is top floor second room on the right and Mark is on the first floor. Two doors down, just past the bathroom on the right.&quot;<br />
<br />
They helped Sophia carry her things to her room and made sure Mark got settled in.<br />
<br />
Trog and Xarxos bid them goodnight.<br />
<br />
“It’s good to be home.” Trog said, when he heard the shower turn on upstairs. He rubbed Xarxos’ back fur.<br />
<br />
Xarxos nodded, looking at him.<br />
<br />
“What?” Trog asked, adjusting his glasses.<br />
<br />
“Wanna work out?” Xarxos asked.<br />
<br />
“You know I prefer yoga.” Trog smiled.<br />
<br />
Xarxos nodded, watching the last of his husband’s muscles smooth away under a layer of fat.<br />
<br />
“Wine?” Trog asked, holding up a bottle and glasses. <br />
<br />
Xarxos shared a glass, rubbing his husband’s wide backside. Trog leaned back in his chair and groaned, enjoying the feeling, not noticing his pants bulge as his ass grew under his husband’s loving touch. He shifted, back popping painfully, and hissed.<br />
<br />
“Can you call Tanaka? I think I need an emergency massage.” Trog panted.<br />
<br />
“Of course.” Xarxos smiled. “He’ll get you all finished up.”<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br />
<br />
A half hour later, and Tanaka arrived. Tanaka lead the old bugbear into the massage parlor. Trog had been looking forward to this all day. Dimly, he remembered that the tanuki had done something to him, but all he could remember was the dry orgasm.<br />
<br />
“Disrobe.” The tanuki intoned.<br />
<br />
Trog did, slipping off his shirt, undoing his suspenders and letting his slacks fall to the floor at his feet. He glanced up and froze. In front of him was a full body mirror. <br />
<br />
The bugbear staring back was old. His fur was graying, his head was bald. And he was fat. Trog reached up and rubbed his enlarged nipple, feeling the sag of his moob, his other arm exploring his protuberant belly. Years of good eating and easy living had taken its toll on his physique. He even lacked the muscles he once possessed.<br />
<br />
“How do you feel?” Tanaka asked, watching Trog touch himself.<br />
<br />
“Just boring old me.” Trog grinned at the handsome old bugbear in the mirror. “And in dire need of a massage.”<br />
<br />
The tanuki nodded, tracing his softly padded paws along Trog’s furry back. The rest of Trog’s hair turned gray and his body wobbled and grew fatter before finally coming to a halt, belly sagging halfway down his thighs. Trog did not appear to notice, a soft smile flitting across his lips, lost in good memories.<br />
<br />
Tanaka pressed a spot on Trog’s spine and Trog felt his cock twitch<br />
<br />
“Oh! It’s been a while since it did much of anything.” Trog glanced down at his lightly chubbed cock. “Looks like Little Trog’s looking forward to a good massage too!”<br />
<br />
“A while sir?” The Tanuki smiled up at him, stubby claws tracing his back.<br />
<br />
“Hmph? Oh yes, years now.” Trog nodded, hair streaking with more white, his belly wobbling under his moobs as it grew another inch. “Oh, don’t feel bad for this old bugbear. I put it well to use in my younger years.”<br />
<br />
The tanuki’s smile widened. “Good to hear, sir.”<br />
<br />
Tanaka helped the corpulent Trog up onto the massage bed. He grumbled and wheezed, belly squishing against the padded bed. The Tanuki adjusted him, placing his long arms in such a way that they didn’t hurt his shoulders, positioning him so his spine didn’t hurt near as much.<br />
<br />
The Tanuki crawled up on top of Trog, making him gasp. Then Tanaka spread the bugbear’s wide butt cheeks and ground his cock forward. Trog gasped as he felt the warm, moist raccoon-dog dick circling the entrance to his hole. No one had been there in years and his hole was tight-!<br />
<br />
“Relax.” Tanaka pressed some spots in Trog’s back.<br />
<br />
Trog groaned as his entire body suddenly relaxed. The bugbear felt his ring loosen, a small fart slipping out. The bugbear blushed and moaned as the pink cock slipped in deeper.<br />
<br />
“Excuse me.” Trog was mortified, but it was like all his muscles had turned to jello at the Tanuki’s touch. If he hadn’t just peed, he was sure his bladder would have loosened.<br />
<br />
“Don’t feel bad, it happens all the time.” Tanaka rubbed and pressed more spots along Trog’s back.<br />
<br />
More farts slipped out the deeper the cock sank. To Trog, it was like someone was lighting up every pleasure center. A dry orgasm hit, keeping him distracted as the final transformation took place.<br />
<br />
The bugbear moaned as his long, useless cock retracted into his body, sinking into the fat in his groin. His balls ached as they shrunk, pulsing one last time. His small, two-inch cock dribbled seed onto the massage table before his genitals were swallowed by his gunt. His prostate enlarged, the Tanuki’s cock milking it, causing the tiny cock to drool a steady pool of precum.<br />
<br />
The tanuki gave a happy grunt and Trog felt a flood of warmth fill his ass that made his stomach bulge more than usual. They stayed that way for a moment, huffing and panting, enjoying the smell of musk and massage oil in the air before Tanaka pulled out. The masseuse wiped down the bugbear’s ass, giving it a playful slap,  and cleaned off his cock.<br />
<br />
Trog groaned happily and raised himself up. He could feel something wet cooling on his belly.<br />
<br />
“Oh, I do believe I came a little!” Trog pointed at a wet spot on the massage bench excitedly.<br />
<br />
“Congratulations.” Tanaka refrained from telling him it was mostly precum. And, likely, the last orgasm he’d ever experience. Xarxos was oddly prudish for a Minotaur that ran a magic sex toy empire. “You ever think of doing porn?”<br />
<br />
“Pornography? Never!” Trog chuckled. “I would never stoop so low.”<br />
<br />
“Excellent. Oh, I removed this.” The Tanuki held up the guiche piercing.<br />
<br />
“That’s certainly not mine.” Trog blushed.<br />
<br />
“Thought not.” Tanaka smiled. “I suppose I should go, then.As long as you are satisfied?”<br />
<br />
“I’m so lucky to have you.” Trog smiled. “And yes, I’m very satisfied.”<br />
<br />
The tanuki smiled and bowed. “I shall wait outside while you clean up, sir.”<br />
<br />
“I think I’ll take a dip in the hot-springs first, thank you.” Trog grinned. <br />
<br />
“As you wish.” The Tanuki let himself out the door.<br />
<br />
The old bugbear quietly chuckled. A porn star! What an imagination that Tanuki had!<br />
<br />
Trog groaned and rolled heavily onto his feet, joints feeling much better now. He waddled happily to the door to the hot-springs and clambered down into the hot water. He wrapped a towel around his face and let the warm waters soak the aches of the day from his body. <br />
<br />
This was the life!<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-<br />
<br />
Xarxos waited outside the onsen, the huge Minotaur tapping a hoof impatiently. The Tanuki sidled out the door and closed it softly behind him. He saw the impressive bull man and bowed.<br />
<br />
“How did it go? Is it done?” Xarxos demanded.<br />
<br />
“Sir, he appears to have fully accepted his life as an elderly bugbear.” The tanuki frowned. “Though, I do not know why you wished me to alter him like that.” <br />
<br />
“So he’d be wiser and less prone to overreaction.” Xarxos shrugged. “Did it you get it?”<br />
<br />
The Tanuki held out the huge guiche ring. “A simple matter. It did not make sense for him to have it in this reality anyways.”<br />
<br />
Xarxos took the ring and examined it, a happy smile playing across his face.<br />
<br />
“Object.” Xarxos said. <br />
<br />
The guiche ring turned into a huge tome, laden with spells. The Minotaur tucked it into a book-bag. It was a tight fit, considering how thick the Book now was.<br />
<br />
“I pledge that I will continue uniting Earth and the Fae World. For the Cause.” Xarxos vowed.<br />
<br />
“For the cause.” The Tanuki bowed.<br />
<br />
 If there’s nothing else-” The Tanuki moved to leave.<br />
<br />
Xarxos held out a hand. “Wait. I need you to return his youth to him.”<br />
<br />
“His youth? That..is quite expensive.” The Tanuki narrowed his eyes. “Could it be you used my powers to ‘teach him a lesson’ or some such farcity?”<br />
<br />
“I paid you.” Xarxos snorted. “And I’ll pay you again.”<br />
<br />
“You’re stretching my goodwill.” Tanaka’s eyes narrowed.<br />
<br />
“Three Wishes, grant able by the Book.” Xarxos said.<br />
<br />
“Wow. Turns out my goodwill is very stretchy.” The Tanuki grinned. “How young would you like him to be?”<br />
<br />
“26. I believe that was his original age. And in body, not mind.” Xarxos clarified.<br />
<br />
“If you want his mind in tact, that will take some reality finessing.” The tanuki frowned. “At a year a day, it should take me…”<br />
<br />
“Forty days.” Xarxos nodded.<br />
<br />
“Two months, actually.” The Tanuki grinned. “I have weekends off. Same species or…?”<br />
<br />
“Something immortal, like myself.” Xarxos shrugged. “As to species…surprise me. Pleasantly.”<br />
<br />
“May I…” The Tanuki grinned.<br />
<br />
“Yes, you can fuck him.” Xarxos rolled his eyes. “I swear Myths are horny fucks.”<br />
<br />
“It shall be done as you command, Lord Xarxos.” The Tanuki bowed and waddled away, heavy balls wobbling between his legs.<br />
<br />
Xarxos watched him leave. When he was gone he carefully flipped through all the new spells. Some of them were very interesting, but he couldn’t keep the Book this way. RK would want his Book of Divination back sooner or later. He popped the Book of Divination out of the tome, and the title became the Book of All Matter Living and Inert.<br />
<br />
Xarxos peeked over the wall and watched his older lover luxuriate in the hot-springs. A promised made and a promise kept. Now it was only a matter of fighting Arcane and Time. And his husband would be properly capable of fighting them.</p>
