<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Buddy and Louise sat quietly and happily together and held hands. While they had to have some sessions with Doctor Jones to help them with some of the things that related to Project Hermaphroditus and their new bisexual natures that came as a result of it. However, they had felt lucky that they had been in love with each other before their conversions. Some things were different for them now, but ultimately where it counted, the two of them were more than happy. In a sense they could get along quite well together with their changes and adapt in both ways, and as they talked with Doctor Jones, both of them thought back on their recent conversion...<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;You want to go... together?&quot; Kicheko asked as she and Akia came out from the transformation room at Horizon where Kicheko&#39;s conversion had been handled.<br />
<br />
Both of the them nervously looked between Buddy and Louise with puzzled looks. Neither of them was necessarily &quot;shamed&quot; by their nudity, but they were a bit surprised when both Buddy and Louise volunteered to go together. While they had expected volunteers with the project, as they knew that those who had come to the waiting room where the Project Hermaphroditus members were waiting had come to join the project, they didn&#39;t actually expect Buddy and Louise to volunteer to be Hyenas together.<br />
<br />
&quot;This may come as something of a fairy tale... but...&quot; Louise began, &quot;We&#39;ve actually loved each other BEFORE all this happened. I&#39;ve seen myself as male and have loved the woman in Buddy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;ve seen myself as a woman and loved the man in Louise,&quot; Buddy spoke with a small blush, &quot;So... we&#39;d like to go together and become each other&#39;s mate...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You love each other!&quot; Akia said with a smile and perked ears.<br />
<br />
Akia&#39;s mind thought on Vito as shi made the statement. While he had to return to the zoo where he worked, because they didn&#39;t give him that much time off, Akia still liked him a lot. Shi could remember the care he provided while shi was a mundane hyena, and despite her status as a hermaphrodite at present, shi did see hirself as more female than male. Enjoying the pleasures that related hir new maleness was nice, but shi still saw hirself as female and hir mind was attracted to Vito for his kindness. The fact that Buddy and Louise had declared their love for each other reminded hir of Vito and almost immediately made hir feel happy for them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Buddy smiled to Louise. Louise responded by squeezing Buddy&#39;s hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then we shall go together,&quot; Akia declared with a glance to Kicheko, who nodded. &quot;Kicheko and I can share our milk with you and provide each of you with both your doses. From there... love will take care of the rest.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kicheko nodded as well. While shi was actually more interested in some of the sexual pleasures that were technically possible, shi did recognize the relationship that Buddy and Louise had declared.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think they even have some glasses in there we can use,&quot; Kicheko commented, &quot;that way neither of you have to worry about something you won&#39;t have interest in at the moment... though... that will probably change, regardless of how you identify yourselves.&quot;<br />
<br />
Buddy and Louise both nodded...<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
And of course, there were glasses. Kicheko and Akio both provided milk and Buddy and Louise enjoyed it. Buddy remembered the great pleasure as hir breasts pushed forward and as a real vagina formed between hir legs and just behind hir balls. While some of the sensations in her transformation that were more animal-like, the muzzle, the fur, the tail, the claws were odd, they weren&#39;t too bad, and Buddy loved the obvious signs of development of the half of hir sex that shi&#39;d always seen hirself as. Louise felt the same way, and in that, the pair then switched names. Buddy became Louise and Louise became buddy in order to fit how they saw themselves, and while there would be some more of these sessions in connection with their acclimation to being Animalians, they looked forward to marriage.<br />
<br />
Across the aisle in the other chairs, Hiroshi and Xenophon sat together with some knowing glances to each other. While Xenophon found hirself more and more attracted to Daffodil, particularly as shi was the stallion/mare that gave Xenophon hir two doses, that didn&#39;t mean that Xenophon didn&#39;t have some sense of friendship with Hiroshi in the sense that all of them had gone through their own sense of troubles that were made worse by a crook&#39;s hack-job. It was a sort of platonic friendship that was firm and was there even before their conversions. Both of them thought back to their own conversions as well.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow,&quot; Hiroshi spoke as he looked up to Goldenrod with his eyes actually focused on Goldenrod&#39;s sheath, &quot;You&#39;re big.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... all horse Animalians can be big,&quot; Goldenrod gave a sort of grin, &quot;you ought to see my cousin...&quot;<br />
<br />
Goldenrod was referring to Samson there. A part of hir did have to admit that Samson was a well built stallion, but there wasn&#39;t any actual sexual attraction to him, mostly due to the knowledge that Goldenrod and Samson were related by blood and the rest was the knowledge that Samson was happily devoted to Abby. A good part of hir own acclimation had been with Samson helping hir adjust to moving on two legs rather than four, and in the course of this, Goldenrod heard a lot about how wonderful mare that Abby became and the only reason that they hadn&#39;t formally married each other was the fact that both were still in high school at WSA. Goldenrod&#39;s reference to Samson was more a comment that Samson was an impressive stallion that Abby was lucky to have.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I like you,&quot; Hiroshi commented and reached forward to run his fingers down the front Goldenrod&#39;s sheath making the Animalian give a semi-aroused nicker.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what do you think?&quot; Daffodil asked to Xenophon who seemed captivated by hir chest. Shi wasn&#39;t sure if it was jealousy or something else, but figured it best to be polite, as Xenophon was there to convert and escape the wrongs that the various black market hacks had done to all the Project Hermaphroditus volunteers.<br />
<br />
Xenophon was captivated, but not by jealousy. A good part of her could care less about Daffodil&#39;s sheath. Xenophon saw herself as a male and in that was drawn more to Daffodil&#39;s breasts in the way that most men were attracted to women. A part of the memories of what had happened because of the black market hacks and the pains that all of them had suffered also seemed to draw up feelings in Xenophon that she didn&#39;t think were possible for a human female, the urge to be the protector and guardian. She&#39;d never let anyone harm Daffodil or any of the other Hermaphroditus volunteers again, and since Daffodil could give Xenophon that chance to become how she had seen &quot;herself,&quot; she took it.<br />
<br />
Xenophon reached forward and wrapped her lips around one of Daffodil&#39;s erect nipples and was soon rewarded with the taste of hir milk, which only encouraged Xenophon to drink more as she began to feel warm. She felt warmth from growing fur and soon from growing muscle mass. Daffodil gave a happy moan at that and soon lead Xenophon into the room that shi&#39;d just emerged from with Goldenrod. Goldenrod watched as Xenophon was already quickly changing. She seemed to be rising up into a digitigrade stance with each step and black fur growing. Goldenrod also soon caught a very male scent coming from Xenophon, but couldn&#39;t focus for too long as Hiroshi&#39;s efforts to arouse Goldenrod&#39;s attention also began to succeed.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll need to go somewhere private,&quot; Goldenrod said to Hiroshi, &quot;we can&#39;t do it out here in the waiting room.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hiroshi nodded, and the two soon made their way to another transformation room that was available.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
And that was then handled. Xenophon became a stallion/mare, as did Hiroshi and in many ways both felt better about their stature as Animalians. Xenophon felt more in touch with the feelings of maleness that shi had always felt, and shi felt shi could now defend Daffodil from anyone that might ever consider harming hir. There was some feelings that related being bisexual, which with Daffodil was an added benefit. The pair of them could satisfy each other in everyway. Hiroshi seemed to be the best adjusted in that while shi might still feel &quot;fluid&quot; with regard to hir gender. In having both sets of equipment, shi could now live in a way that would reflect that. Hir hope was that Animalia would accept that, though the session with Doctor Jones seemed to reflect that they would.</p>
