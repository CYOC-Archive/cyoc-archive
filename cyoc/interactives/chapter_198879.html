<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Now, you go and play...I&#39;ll be upstairs if you need me....you remember the rules, boy...no going in the bedrooms.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff looked at her, nodding. He was a good boy and would follow the rules. He padded over to where his toys were, and grabbed his favourite in his mouth happily.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Sally went up to the bedroom and sat down in the chair. She noticed a smartphone charging next to the computer. She picked it up and began scrolling through the notifications. She cursed as she read one of the messages, and logged onto the computer to get some work done....this was supposed to be a relaxing day and now she had work to do all of the sudden.<br />
<br />
A few hours later, Sally rushed down the stairs. Jeff ran over to her happily, expecting her to play with him. &quot;Sorry, boy....I have to go out,&quot; she said, jingling her keys in her hand.<br />
<br />
Jeff heard the word out from his female Master. They were going out? Walkies? He barked happily.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, boy....I&#39;ll be back soon, and we&#39;ll have some fun...promise.&quot;<br />
<br />
He looked at her, trusting her completely...but something was bothering him...he was having trouble understanding what. He was supposed to be a human...but he was having trouble understanding how he wasn&#39;t....or...He decided it wasn&#39;t important, Master would do what was best for him.<br />
<br />
“That’s it.. whos a good boy, now I want you to stay, STAY.. Understand?” Sally said to Jeff while giving the back of his ears a good rub, somehow, she knew he liked it.  <br />
<br />
“arff” Jeff Barked , wagging his tail before turning around and curling up in his sleeping cushion. <br />
<br />
“Good boy, I won’t be long… I just have to run a quick errand “ she said checking her phone notifications, In this reality Sally was a college student living at home, she had a project due next week which she was working on with a guy called Mike and had to quickly rush over to pick up some paperwork apparently.   <br />
<br />
Smiling that Jeff was behaving she quickly waved and left, not forgetting to lock the door before heading to her car. Recalling a scolding from Jeffs mom once, shaking her head at that thought Sally was quite happy with how quickly everything was coming to her.  It seemed to be that the chronivac has linked their experiences, so sally was able to draw upon most of Jeffs life skills or so she thought. <br />
<br />
Little did she know, every time she performed a human action which required experiences from jeff, they left him and transferred over to sally piece by piece. By this point Jeff didn’t know what a phone was and had only experiences of sitting in the boot of Sallys mother’s car.  <br />
Pulling out of the driveway Sally popped on the radio, shaking her head lightly to a catchy pop song she’d never heard before but became familiar the more she listened. The same thing happened with each following song before she found herself singing the lyrics in time with Taylor swifts new song. <br />
<br />
After a few more songs sally pulled up at mikes house, getting out she knocked on the door, catching her reflection in the glass panels sally briefly felt conscious and primped her hair a little, as the sudden shock that this will be the first human-human interaction since Jeff hit her . <br />
<br />
The door swung open and sally was greeted by the handsome smile of white teeth and warm inviting eyes. Mike stood 6ft 3” tall, with a well build body, he was wearing a white tee and some loose fitting shorts, tiny droplets of sweat on his forehead as if he had just finished a workout. <br />
<br />
“Sally , glad you could come over and don’t you look lovely as always, is that a new dress? <br />
<br />
<br />
“Oh yeah funny you mention that I guess you could say I just got it today” Sally said with a little giggle, considering the situation.  <br />
<br />
“Well blue is a really good colour on you, anyway want to come to my room I’ve been working on the project a bit.”  <br />
<br />
“okay, lead the way “ <br />
<br />
Mike nodded as he led Sally to his room and they both quickly got sucked into work. <br />
<br />
Initially Sally would struggle with a concept and have to re-read it, but found that as the afternoon wore on , it got easier and easier to her satisfaction. And towards the end, she even found herself enjoying the company of Mike. He was a really good partner. <br />
<br />
Which got sally Thinking, as she looked over to him scribbling down notes on a notepad, his muscles tense and legs bare. Sally flushed a little as she felt turned on suddenly.  Considering Jeff was a dog, atleast for today she couldn’t exactly have sex with him which is what she would prefer. But maybe she could get practice. yeah practice she thought.  That way when Jeff turns back and they make love, she’ll be experienced in human sex.     <br />
<br />
While Sally was self-rationalising having sex with Mike despite being fully able to turn jeff back any moment she wished. Mike was eyeing sally out of the corner of his eye while she had been flustered and smiled. Finally she cracked and was vulnerable he thought. <br />
<br />
“aah so I think I’m done for the day” Mike said while stretching, making sure to flex his abs. <br />
<br />
snapping out of her daze, sally looked at mike instantly blushing again, <br />
<br />
“uh I don’t know” was all she could meep, <br />
<br />
“Well I was thinking we could have some fun if you know what I mean” as mike took of his top and laid on his bed, patting the side next to him while locking eyes with Sally.  <br />
<br />
Sally took a deep breath, after having rationalised it, she was curious, and she wanted to follow her bodily instincts.  <br />
<br />
So without saying a word  sally walked to the edge of the bed, as she lifted the strap of her blue dress of her shoulders and gently slipped it down to the floor.  Standing in her lingerie bra and undies that she had picked up from her wardrobe earlier. <br />
<br />
“and the rest? “ Mike said with a sly grin, while he too got more comfortable<br />
<br />
Sally gave Mike a playful look as she slowly removed her bra and panties, edging into the bed. Soon enough  the two where making love and Sally found herself lost in the moment. <br />
<br />
“Wait don’t you want me to wear a con..” Mike began to say before he too stopped talking and began to relish in the raw love making, he’d never had sex feel so primal before he thought.  <br />
------<br />
<br />
Jeff had started getting worried, how long had it been since Master was home, his sense of time had vanished and the hours sally spent away to Jeff felt like weeks.  Wondering upstairs, Jeff wanted to go to his former room to lie down but upon reaching the top of the stairs felt a strong feeling that he was being naughty. Not liking this negative feeling Jeff quickly climbed down the stairs again.  He was told to stay and stay he shall he thought simply. <br />
<br />
while lapping up some water, Jeff heard a loud Beep coming from the side of the other room. Flipping the water bowl over in excitement Jeff rushed into  the other room to inspect the situation, easily pushing the door open. <br />
<br />
What stood before him was the chronivac which was beeping loudly with an alert “ Pregnancy detected! –  Select  an option. <br />
<br />
Jeff looked up confused, he didn’t understand what any of this said anymore, but feeling like it was urgent he was compelled to act.</p>
