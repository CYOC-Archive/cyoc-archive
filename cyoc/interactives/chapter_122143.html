<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Jen! Come on, wake up!&quot; A voice called, and with a start Jen awoke. Shaking her head, the girl gave a long, slow yawn. Rubbing at her eyes, the girl tried to sit up, but failed. It felt like there was a great weight on her chest and she just couldn&#39;t get it off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yeah. I&#39;m awake.&quot; Jen called back, trying to shake the rest of the sleep from her mind.<br />
<br />
&#39;What a strange dream&#39; she thought to herself, &#39;getting cursed to steal my sister&#39;s boobs. Yeah, as if that would ever...&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on sleepyhead,&quot; Jessica said as she entered the room, completely shirtless. Her chest was bare.<br />
<br />
And it was flat. No breasts, no nipples. Nothing but the six pack that the her sister had worked long and hard for. &quot;I know that you have trouble getting up in the morning, but come on... you&#39;re going to be late for school at this rate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;R-right.&quot; Jen spoke softly, staring at her sister&#39;s chest, an action that only brought a grin as the fitter girl flexed.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? You wishing you had abs and guns like these?&quot; It was a response that was just so... so indicative of her sister still being herself that it kind of pulled Jen out of her confused funk. &quot;Or are you jealous that I don&#39;t have any weight fat sacks on my chest? I mean, I know that the guys love your fun pillows, but that has got to be hell on your back, having four like that. But it really does look like your up, finally. So hurry and get dressed. You don&#39;t want to be late again, do you?&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, the shirtless and breastless girl turned and left the room, leaving Jess to her confusion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...&quot; She said quietly, staring at the retreating form of her sister. &quot;It wasn&#39;t a dream.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen... didn&#39;t really know how to react to that thought. She... she was a freak. A person who could switch out and change her body with the parts of anyone... hell, anything else.<br />
<br />
That was...<br />
<br />
That was...<br />
<br />
Why had Kyle done this to you? He was trying to get revenge for that prank some of the other cheergirls had done to him since he was following her around and constantly trying to ask her out, despite the fact that she had been very clear and straightforward about the fact that she was not interested in a relationship with him.<br />
<br />
So why did he give you something so AWESOME?<br />
<br />
The words of the curse flickered back across Jen&#39;s mind, and she smiled, noticing that there was a very important loophole that that idiot had forgotten.<br />
<br />
Sure, any part she added to herself had to stay for a week, but that was fine.  Because any part that came directly from her could be added and removed at her leisure.<br />
<br />
She tried to sit up again, but the weight of her sister&#39;s breasts added to her own was quite sizable. And so she reached down into her sleep shirt, took a hold of a breast in each hand, and with a sound not unlike a pop pulled. Leaving her with a boob in each hand, and only her sister&#39;s breasts on her chest.<br />
<br />
She really wasn&#39;t sure what to do with the extra breasts, and so she decided to try out the second little trick that the idiot had given to her. Sending her breasts to storage... whatever that meant.<br />
<br />
Looking down at her hands, she was a little surprised to realize that they were already gone. To wherever &#39;storage&#39; was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh.&quot; She said quietly to herself, &quot;That was a lot easier than I&#39;d thought it be.&quot;And with a shrug, the girl climbed out of bed and started getting ready for the day.<br />
<br />
Heading into the kitchen she spotted something really out of the ordinary.<br />
<br />
The entire family at breakfast. How odd. Father was normally out of the house by now... or rather it was rare enough that he returned, and given the glare being saddled at Mother it was likely somehow because of her that they were both at the table.<br />
<br />
Likely had something to do with the papers sitting between them.<br />
<br />
Jess was there, eating a hearty and filling breakfast while trying to keep the tension light by talking with your younger brother and younger sister.<br />
<br />
Alex was your younger sister, just under 16 who was a freshman at the highschool. She was something of a &#39;social oddity&#39; as you had heard one of the other cheerleaders say. That was not a term you were particularly fond of, but it was an accurate one. Some might have called her the stereotypical emo girl. Which as someone who at least had a small scattering of an understanding of the culture that your sister was a part of (After all, what kind of big sister didn&#39;t try to learn about the things that your young sister liked) you understood was a statement that she despised.<br />
<br />
The term that your sister used to describe herself was Anti-Nihilist. She loved the world and everything in it because nothing she did mattered. A bit of a dark view to have, and one that you really disagreed with - mainly the idea that she didn&#39;t matter. Of course she mattered.<br />
<br />
But none the less. Your sister inherited the almost porcelain white skin that your Irish mother had also gifted to you, and hair that was originally the color of the sun that she had inherited from Father your sister could have been called a classic beauty. She wasn&#39;t into the look however. So she dyed her hair black as the night, except for the streaks of neon pink that sliced through her hair. Combine that with the thigh high stockings and the midnight blue lace gloves that go with the similarly colored dress, and you have what some people might call a Gothic Lolita. A term that still confuses you, because aren&#39;t Lolitas those people who like little girls?<br />
<br />
Then there was Maxwell. Not Max, Maxwell. He liked his first name, and he wanted to be called by the full of it. Max looked particularly uncomfortable at the table, unlike Jess who looked pissed, and Alex who looked amused at the whole thing.<br />
<br />
But ever since Mother and Father split they had been trying to use Maxwell as a way to one up each other and get him to say that one of them was better than the other. You did your best to try and keep him out of their nefarious clutches, but you didn&#39;t really have the power. Neither did Jess, because Mother still technically had custody of both him and Alex, despite the fact that she basically left the four of you to Martha to raise.<br />
<br />
Maxwell for the most part looked like your average kid. Maybe a little nerdy, he did have glasses. At least, for now he had glasses. He accidentally ripped one of his contacts a few weeks ago, and surprisingly neither Mother or Father had used the opportunity to get him new ones as a means of getting at the other. They were probably trying to show off how terrible the other was by pointing out how the other one hadn&#39;t gotten him new contacts yet or something.<br />
<br />
And today was Martha&#39;s day off, so perhaps the whole family wasn&#39;t here, but then again perhaps it&#39;s for the best. Mother is always rude to Martha, and Father is always flirting with her.<br />
<br />
It would make this horrible awkward morning even worse if she was here.<br />
<br />
It was then that a thought slipped into Jen&#39;s mind, as she stared at the family sitting around the table.<br />
<br />
She could take things from them. Place them into storage or add them directly onto herself.<br />
<br />
It might not have been the most wholesome of thoughts... but the idea of getting back at her parents for being the awful people that they were was appealing... Shaking her head, she entered into the dining room and took a seat, looking around the table.</p>
