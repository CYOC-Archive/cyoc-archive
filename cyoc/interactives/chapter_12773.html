<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was a big day in the city of Cliffton and the Stinson household, it was a Tuesday, the first day of school for the new school year. However this year things would be different for the Stinsons' especially Jim. Jim was now a freshman in high school, and his next oldest brother was a seventh grader and his youngest brother a fourth grader. What did this mean, it meant that he was now growing up however to him it meant that he had the house to himself until his brother's got home at 3:15 since their school ended at 3:00 and his ended at 2:30. This time difference would allow him to do his favorite activity everyday, and so he began today. <br />
<br />
Jim was standing in front of a mirror in the one place he shouldn't be, yet all he could do was smile at his reflection and the way his body felt. He loved the panties he was wearing and the way his dick felt as it rubbed and twitched against the silky material of the red French cut panties with lace trim. Jim also loved the bra he was wearing not only because he loved the feel of the straps pressing down on his shoulders, but he loved the way it held his underwear that he stuffed into the cups of the bra making it look like he had a set of breasts under the white turtleneck and red blazer he was wearing. Speaking of the white turtleneck, Jim enjoyed the feeling of it  brushing on his neck every time he moved his head, while also enjoying the way it matched with the red blazer which was only buttoned up two buttons. As for the red blazer it looked and fit perfect on Jim especially with the matching red slacks which had an elastic waist but still had holes for a red belt that looked awesome especially the gold buckle in front. Yeah it will be great Jim thought every school day I will be able to wear the exact same clothes my mom had on yesterday, as he took a sniff breathing in the perfume and aroma of  his mom's clothes.     <br />
<br />
However Jim was not one hundred percent happy at his reflection, he wanted to wear her nylons and heels however he didn't have time. Plus he hated his short hair and wished he could have long hair like his mom. Not to mention the fact that he couldn't wear her ear rings since his ears were not pierced. Jim let out a big sigh as he saw the bulge in the pants, that sucks too he thought as he caressed his cock through the pants, with his hand. At the sight of his hand he thought of what else sucked, not being able to paint my nails and wear her sparkling diamond wedding ring, since she always has it on. However at the thought of his mom’s wedding ring Jim remembered what he put in his pocket, a ring. So he raced out of his parent’s bedroom heading for his room.<br />
<br />
In his room, Jim held the pants in his hand as he dug in the pocket and pulled out the ring. It was a ring he had found at school in a hall way and he quickly snatched it up as he envisioned what beauty had the ring on her finger. Jim smiled at the gold band, that looked a little dirty and rusty,  as he pulled it out of his pocket, however he didn’t have time to fix that now. So he slipped the ring on his left hand on the same finger his mom’s wedding ring is worn, pretending it was her wedding ring. Perfect Jim thought as he felt his cock begging for relief, twitch beneath the pants and panties. Now its your turn Jim stated as he rubbed his cock through the pants and panties and reached for the belt to unbuckle it.  <br />
<br />
So there it was 3:15 Jim was done with his business and had everything put in place, as he rested on his bed dressed in his clothes trying to catch his breath as he heard someone just coming in the door and making their way up the stairs. He heard a door shut and recognized it as his youngest brother's room down the hall. Jeff is home he thought to himself. A minute later he heard someone else enter the house and that person made their way up the steps. He heard the door next to his bedroom close it was Jake his other brother. Jim rested on his bed, closing his eyes waiting for one of his brothers to knock on his door.<br />
<br />
Next thing Jim knew he heard someone knocking at his door. He rubbed his eyes and looked at the clock 4:20 p.m., shit I must have dozed of Jim thought to himself as he yelled &quot;Come in&quot;<br />
<br />
The door opened and there stood his mom dressed in black high heels, nylons, skirt and blazer, touched off with a gray silk blouse with black buttons.<br />
<br />
&quot;How was your fist day of high school&quot; she asked with excitement as a big smile was on her face.<br />
<br />
All Jim could think about was how wonderful it was going to feel to be in the gray silk blouse. Not to mention the black skirt and slip he assumed his mom was wearing underneath the skirt and then sensation of them sliding against his legs, and nylons. Yeah tomorrow I’m going to wear those nylons too, I’ll just have to be a little quicker getting dressed, yet at the same time be careful with everything. <br />
<br />
“Well how was your first day” his mom asked again with excitement and a hint of impatience.<br />
<br />
“Good” Jim said as he studied his mom’s ears with jealousy at the earrings that dangled with each move she made.<br />
<br />
“That’s it, good” his mom asked with disappointment.<br />
<br />
“Yeah that’s it” Jim stated as he noticed his mom’s brown hair brushing against the collar of her black blazer. <br />
<br />
“Well supper will be ready at 5:00, then maybe you’ll be a little more talkative” Jim’s mom stated as she started to leave his bedroom<br />
<br />
“Maybe” Jim replied as his mom closed the door.<br />
<br />
Jim couldn’t help but touch his cock imagining he was in those clothes right now as he laid back and closed his eyes.<br />
<br />
There was a knock on the door as Jim was startled again and he heard Jake yell “Dinners ready.” Jim rubbed his eyes and looked at the clock which now read 5:00. I shouldn‘t have went to bed so late last night he thought to himself as he got up from the bed and headed out his bedroom door down the steps to the kitchen.<br />
<br />
Just outside of the kitchen door he heard the clip clap of his mom’s high heel shoes on the hardwood floor of the kitchen and upon entering the kitchen he couldn‘t help but be jealous since there was no noise when he took his first step on the hard wood floor of the kitchen. <br />
<br />
When he entered the kitchen his two brother’s were already seated on one side of the table, while his dad was at the head of the table. The table itself was filled with five plates, five glasses, silverware, a bowl of mashed potatoes, a smaller bowl of gravy, a medium sized bowl of corn, and a gallon of skim milk. Jim went over and sat directly across from his two brother’s as his mom clip clapped her way over with a pan in her hands. She set the pan down in the middle of the table on a hot plate and Jim looked disgustingly toward the meatloaf just set on the table. Jim’s mom took her seat on the opposite end of the table as Jim’s dad, her husband. <br />
<br />
Dinner began as Jake and Jeff started telling their dad and mom all about their first day of school as Jim sat quietly and ate his food. However he noticed something on his left hand. Shit he though to himself I forgot to take off the ring, if anyone sees it I ill be humiliated. So he put his left hand down and proceeded to eat only with his right hand. Jim listened to his two brothers talk while his mom and dad would add their comments in. Every once in awhile Jim would look up from his plate to catch a glimpse of his mom in that blouse, blazer and skirt. He couldn’t help but imagine what it would be like to be sitting there in her spot with those clothes on acting like she does, to actually be her, his mom, and then he heard his mom’s voice “Jim, what about you, all you said about your first day of high school was that it was good? I want to know how are your classes, teachers, did you meet any new friends?&quot; <br />
<br />
Jim looked up at his mom, her brunette hair, the black blazer, the gray silk blouse, the dangling earrings. “I wish I was my mom” Jim said to himself as he felt a wave of dizziness and then a foggy feeling came over his brain and he closed his eyes to try to focus his brain. Next thing Jim knew he heard a voice, a very familiar voice, start talking about English 9 and Earth Science and Mrs. Sherman, the voice was telling his day Jim thought as he opened his eyes. What he saw was his body sitting on the right hand side of him, staring at him with hunger studying each move he made as he talked about his day. Jim turned his head for a second feeling something brushing against his ears but yet at the same time it seemed something was dangling form his ears hitting his neck. With his head turned he noticed his dad was now sitting straight across from him and his two brother’s were on the left hand side of him, he was sitting where his mom sat. That meant as he turned his head and peeked down to see a gray blouse and black blazer, that he was now his mom, Janet Stinson. But how?<br />
<br />
Who cares Jim thought to himself as he couldn’t help but smile as he turned back to his old body who was now starting to talk about a kid named Pete he met at school. Jim wondered whether it was his mom in his body, only his old body was digging at his meatloaf exactly as he did when he was in that body, god he hated meat loaf. Not to mention he keeps talking about school like he went through it all day. Jim listened to his old body finish about about his last class of the day Spanish as he noticed his old body stare back at him. It was the same stare as before, and Jim recognized the stare and the thoughts behind it, my old body is imagining wearing these clothes, in fact tomorrow he plans on wearing these clothes. Oh my god!<br />
<br />
Jim slowly raised his right hand off his lap and clutched the fork. He noticed the slim hand sticking through the arm of the blazer. On the hand he noticed the long dark red nails which brought him to the thought of his mom’s hand. He quickly lifted the left hand and as he brought it up he saw what he wanted to see, the gleaming diamond wedding ring, the one his dad placed on this hand on their wedding day. However something else caught his attention right above the wedding ring was the ring that he was wearing on his old body now it’s on his mom’s body. How did that get there?<br />
<br />
Magic thats how Jim thought this must be the cause of me being my mom but how, what did I do? Jim thought and thought as he listened to his dad talk about sports with his old body and two brother’s as he continued eating his meal especially the meatloaf which didn’t taste too bad today. Then it hit Jim I made a wish, I wished I was my and then Jim caught himself before he said the next word. Jim breathed a sigh of relief thinking to himself if the ring worked and I wished to be my mom, since I’m now in my mom’s body I would become my mom’s mom, my grandma. Jim shuddered at the thought of being in his grandma’s body and decided he didn’t need to experiment with the ring he had what he wanted, his mom’s body and life. <br />
<br />
Dinner went quick as the boys and Jim's dad scarfed down their food over their sports discussion. Jim wanted to chime in but he knew his mom didn't know anything about sports so he sat quietly and ate his food like she always did. Before Jim knew it Jake and Jeff were sprinting out of the kitchen and soon after his old body started to leave as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jim do you think you could help me put the dishes away?&quot; Jim asked his old body as he listened to his mom's soft sweet voice coming from his body as he talked for the first time. <br />
<br />
&quot;What I didn't do anything wrong, why do i have to help? Jim's old body whined. <br />
<br />
&quot;Because your  mom asked you to&quot; Jim's dad backed him up as he got up from his chair and started to leave the kitchen stopping where Jim was standing. <br />
<br />
&quot;All right&quot; Jim's old body replied sheepishly, knowing he was defeated. At the same time Jim's dad leaned in to him as he was seated at the table and as Jim breathed in his dad's cologne their lips meant for a second. His dad pulled away &quot;a lovely dinner as usual.&quot; he said and he left the kitchen leaving only Jim and his old body in the kitchen. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well should we get started&quot; Jim stated still trying to get used to his mom's voice coming out when he talked as he pushed his chair up and stood up balancing on his high heels. Its a good thing I have so much practice he thought to himself as Jim started to clip clap his way over to the dishwasher with a plate in his hand loving the noise he now made when he walked. However he also loved the way the skirt, slip and nylons felt on his legs as he took each step. <br />
<br />
When he got to the dishwasher and loaded his plate he enjoyed the feeling of his earrings bumping his neck as they dangled down, along with his long hair which not only hit his neck but fell into his face.  Jim also enjoyed the way the silk blouse felt as he moved his arms putting the plate in the dishwasher. However what he enjoyed the most was when he caught his old body staring at him with envy.<br />
<br />
They put the rest of the dishes away with Jim only catching his body a few times. However he did notice the bulge in his old bodies pants and Jim could only smile at the cause of it. The blouse, skirt, nylons, slip, panties, bra, wedding ring, nails, earrings, he was now wearing, and the clip clap of the high heels when he walked. Yeah that's who I am my mom, Janet Stinson. <br />
<br />
&quot;Is that everything mom?&quot; the new Janet could only smile at being called mom for the first time.<br />
<br />
&quot;yes that's everything except&quot; Janet said as she moved over by Jim. Janet proceeded to wrap her arms around her son pressing her breasts into his chest as his tee shirt touched her gray silk blouse driving Jim wild inside. Jim instinctively wrapped his arms very loosely around his mom letting them rest on the back of the black blazer he desperately wanted to wear. They both broke the hug as Jim headed to his bedroom and Janet headed for the living room where her husband was with a smile on her face knowing what her son would be doing in the bedroom. <br />
<br />
John Stinson dressed in khakis and a polo shirt after changing out of his suit, was seated in his leather recliner watching the news as Janet Stinson entered the living room and sat down on the couch. However something caught his eye &quot;Are you going someplace?&quot; John asked.<br />
<br />
No why? Janet replied and looked at her husband. <br />
<br />
&quot; Usually you change out of your work clothes as fast as you can&quot;<br />
<br />
The new Janet remembered how the old Janet would complain about how she felt in her work clothes thus she would either change as soon as she got home or right after dinner. So the new Janet thought maybe she should go and change into one of the sweat pants or  sweatshirts the old Janet would always wear when she got home &quot;I don't know I just feel comfortable today.&quot; Janet stated.<br />
<br />
John laughed &quot;women&quot; he replied.<br />
<br />
Janet and John started to watch the rest of the news however Janet was bored quickly and wanted to have some fun with her new body. What to do she thought to herself as she thought of suggestion. I could drive somewhere now that I have a driver's license and a car. Then a evil thought came to her mind, I could explore my body since i have never seen it naked, then change into the sweat pants and sweat shirt the old Janet always wears. However a truly evil thought came to her mind I could confront my body who is probably masturbating right now and demand to know why he was in my clothes today. What should I do?</p>
