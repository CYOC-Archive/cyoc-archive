<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Cool!&quot; Ric said looking down at the two black cats. Marco was slightly bigger than Mr. Mendes. The two of them purred and played...then lapped up the bowls
<br>
 of milk the boys put out. 
<br>

<br>
 Ric insisted that the two men remain cats all that night. The next morning Josh walked into the living room to see Ric playing with the two cats, &quot;Aren't you going to
<br>
 make them human again?&quot; Josh asked. Ric Answered, &quot;Um, sure...I mean I guess I have too..but I really like the idea that these two cats were once Mr. Mendes
<br>
 and Marco...It's really an odd feeling to know we did this.&quot; Ric then looked at the slightly worried Josh, &quot;Don't worry.&quot; Ric said, &quot;I can change them back after
<br>
 swimming lessons.&quot; Josh suddenly realized this was the morning of their weekly swimming lessons with Coach Conners at the park pool. The pool was only a few
<br>
 blocks away, so no need to change a cat back into a human to drive them. 
<br>

<br>
 The boys got ready, left their former guardians more milk and some cat food they bought the night before and headed for the park...locking the cats inside and
<br>
 taking the book with them. 
<br>

<br>
 In his house, Jacob Conners was putting a tee shirt on over his shorts. Jacob stood 5'10&quot; tall, was slightly muscular and was very hairy. He had curly black hair that
<br>
 hung a bit down his neck and covered the tops of his ears. His chest was thick with black hair that ran in a thick treasure trail down to his pubic area and his hairy
<br>
 legs. Hit armpits were covered in thick black hair and he always had a five o'clock shadow. His face was very friendly, and boyish in a way...he was like a hairy
<br>
 Carmine from &quot;Lavern &amp; Shirley&quot;. 
<br>

<br>
 Jacob kissed his beautiful blonde wife Angela good-bye. Even though he still had feelings for her, their marriage was in a rut...Jacob wasn't sure Angela still wanted
<br>
 to be with him...she seemed to have lost interest...and he was right. To be fair to Angela, She also cared for Jacob, but no longer in the romantic arena. 
<br>

<br>
 The coach put on his ball cap and went to the pool dressed in his tee shirt, shorts and tennish shoes with socks. As coach, he did not have to suit up and get into
<br>
 the water...the boys at the pool were advanced past his having to be in the water with them. 
<br>

<br>
 Swim practice went as usual. Ric and Josh decided to stay in a splash around some more...their guardian was a cat now, what could he say about them being late? 
<br>

<br>
 When the boys got to the locker room, they caught Coach Conners naked and stepping into the shower. Josh was a little timid about showering with an adult, but
<br>
 Ric seemed to be mesmerized by Jacob's hairy body. Josh got in and out quickly. All the coach said was, &quot;Hey boys...gettin' the chlorine off?&quot; and turned
<br>
 around...not wanting to expose himself too much or make the boys self-concious. 
<br>

<br>
 At the lockers, Ric whispered to Josh, &quot;Gimme the book.&quot; Josh reached for the book, &quot;You're not gonna make Coach Conners a cat too are you?&quot; Ric rolled his
<br>
 eyes, &quot;No stupid, but I wonder what Coach Conners looked like without all that hair. Here's something.&quot; With that, Ric uttered a spell. 
<br>

<br>
 In the shower, Jacob Conners was regressing back in age. He started to shrink. The hair in his dwindling body began to deminish. Jacob did not notice the changes
<br>
 in the least...he was caught up in the erotic wave of the spell. He grew shorter and younger...his dick and balls getting smaller too...the uncut coach had been well
<br>
 endowed. Finally, all that was left of Jacob Conners was a thirteen year old boy with just a little armpit and pubic hair...just enough to say he had some hair. 
<br>

<br>
 Ric walked into the shower, &quot;Hey there..you almost done?&quot; Jacob turned around and in a cracking voice said, &quot;Yeah. You're Ric right?...we were in...swim class
<br>
 together...right?&quot; &quot;Sure,&quot; Ric answered, &quot;Who are you again?&quot; Little Coach Conners answered, &quot;Jacob Conners...or Jake if you like...I feel a little weird, I know
<br>
 why we're here, but it's bit mixed up.&quot; Ric told Jake not to worry, he had just gotten tired from swimming. It didn't make sense, but young Jake bought it. 
<br>

<br>
 Jake got out and dried off. Ric picked up his wedding ring that had slipped off in the shower. Ric had already had Josh pack Coach Conners' clothes into their
<br>
 bags. The boys convinced Jake that his clothes had been stolen and loaned him Ric's swim trunks to wear home...wet, but they covered. 
<br>

<br>
 Ric was proud of himself...this had been a complicated spell. He had actually turned Coach Conners into a 13 year old boy and made his mind beleive that was his
<br>
 natural state. Aside from some blank spots, Jacob Conners did not know any better that he had been thirteen and a swim student with Ric and Josh all along. 
<br>

<br>
 Ric told Jake he was to stay with them that night. Jack suddenly remember something...sort of, &quot;I forgot....I didn't tell my wif...my..my mom. I have to go home to
<br>
 tell her.&quot;</p>
