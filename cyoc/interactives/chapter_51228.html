<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jensen looked at Cassii and said, &quot;We'll come but I want to bring Alice with us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who's Alice Daddy?&quot; Cassii asked.<br />
<br />
Alice stepped forward and said, &quot;I am Alice,&quot; and did a little curtsy. &quot;I am so gay to have another sister like me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Alice,&quot; Cassii said curtsying back. &quot;I'm also happy to meet another like me that is my sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
'What about your sister Cindii?' Candii asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know I'll always be your little girl Mommy Candii and Cindii will always be my sister,&quot; Cassii said. &quot;My love for you will never change.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you talking to?&quot; all of them asked at the same time.<br />
<br />
'Looks like you forgot they can't hear us sis,' Mike said with a smirk in his voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was talking to Mommy Candii who is my dress,&quot; Cassii said laying a hand on her dress.<br />
<br />
&quot;You poor thing,&quot; Kaylee said hugging Cassii. &quot;We'll take care of you. The whole pack will. I have a question for you though. You said that my love is your father. Is your mother here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes she is,&quot; Cassii said looking at Darla.<br />
<br />
Darla smiled and said, &quot;I'm her mother.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I wonder what this means for when we have pups the natural way if we do Darla,&quot; Jensen said thinking a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;We need to restore the symmetry between us now,&quot; Alice said nodding.<br />
<br />
&quot;That can wait though,&quot; Jensen said, &quot;as well as the other introductions. Right now we need to go see Madam Serenity to ensure the pack's survival. Will it be alright if Alice comes along Cassii?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't see why not,&quot; Cassii said. &quot;It may be better this way in case they've made a lion like me. We can go in opposite directions in order to confuse them. Though they will eventually find us if they included the ability for them to smell our trails.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We do not leave any scent that can be tracked,&quot; Alice said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh we do leave a very faint one,&quot; Cassii said. &quot;It's too faint to be picked up ordinarily but Cindii had made sure that I could so I could track her when I wanted.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A good ability to have,&quot; Jensen said thoughtfully. &quot;But enough of this for now. Abby, Samantha, Darla, Fran, Julie, continue on to the island. Remember what I told you should Kaylee and I be killed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course Master,&quot; Darla, Fran, and Julie said at the same time.<br />
<br />
Nodding his approval Jensen took one of Alice's hands and Kaylee took the other. Cassii offered her hand to Jensen and once he took it they took three steps and were at the police station.<br />
<br />
Jensen looked around and noticed the two lions in the room. A sudden surge of anger took him and he was tempted to have Alice or Cassii take him through. Before he could do such an irrational thing though he reminded himself that it was an enclosed space and there were two of them. Brian looked up and said, &quot;COME OUT HERE SO WE CAN KILL YOU.&quot; He came right up to the mirror like he was going to reach in and grab Jensen.<br />
<br />
&quot;I came to talk not die,&quot; Jensen said calmly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You broke into our house and tried to kill us,&quot; Brian said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Enough Mr. Hardy!&quot; Cassii said and clawed Brian's mirror world ghost form. Brian let out a roar of pain and grabbed where Cassii had clawed. In a loud voice Cassii said, &quot;NOW SETTLE DOWN MR. HARDY. THE PAIN WILL GO AWAY MOMENTARILY. I'M NOT IN THE MOOD FOR THIS. I'VE BEEN MOLESTED BY MY FOSTER PARENTS OVER THE PAST THREE DAYS AND I'M ABOUT READY TO SNAP.&quot;<br />
<br />
This brought on a deathly silence followed by Jensen, Kaylee, Felicity, and Brian all shouting, &quot;I'LL KILL THEM!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that's one thing you can agree on,&quot; Cassii said a bit calmer now.<br />
<br />
This drew a chuckle from everyone except Gill who said, &quot;Let the police handle that. I'll need a statement from you Cassii.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course but can it wait?&quot; Cassii asked. &quot;It's just that they don't know about what I am and it would take me awhile to get from there to here. I wanted them to think that I was an ordinary little girl so they wouldn't be afraid of me seeing as how they have never lived in Glendale and so have never heard of the game.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand,&quot; Gill said nodding. &quot;It can wait until tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You do not need to worry about people outside of Glendale,&quot; Alice said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean Alice?&quot; Cassii asked looking at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;People outside of Glendale will think it is normal for you to be what you are,&quot; Alice said. &quot;I have tested it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is worrisome,&quot; Cassii said frowning.<br />
<br />
&quot;That means the curse isn't confined to Glendale,&quot; Madam Serenity said. &quot;How did it get out?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The curse is still confined to Glendale,&quot; Cassii said. &quot;Though there seems to be a loophole that allows it to alter all of reality not just in Glendale.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen thought for a minute then said, &quot;You just gave me an idea on how to test the limits of the game some more Cassii.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can we talk about what we came here to talk about now?&quot; madam Serenity asked. Looking at Jensen she said, &quot;I assume you're Jensen.&quot; Jensen nodded and then Madam Serenity looked at Alice and asked, &quot;And you're Alice?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pleased to meet you,&quot; Alice said curtsying.<br />
<br />
Madam Serenity looked at Kaylee and asked, &quot;What's your name dear?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm Kaylee,&quot; Kaylee said, &quot;alpha female of the Big Bad Wolf Pack.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright my name is Madam Serenity,&quot; Madam Serenity said. &quot;Since I've been trapped in this body by the game I have made it my mission to find a way to stop the game and help those that have been it's victims.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You've been trying to break up my family,&quot; Jensen snarled.<br />
<br />
&quot;A family you've made from some unwilling people,&quot; Brian growled.<br />
<br />
&quot;They're happy in my pack,&quot; Jensen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Would they have willingly joined if given the choice?&quot; Madam Serenity asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Jensen said. &quot;Why wouldn't anyone want to become a big bad wolf?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Some people are happy with their lives they way they are,&quot; Madam Serenity said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cassii is happy with her life as she is now,&quot; Jensen said feeling confident of the answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;I bet she says different,&quot; Brian said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you want to bet?&quot; Jensen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you have?&quot; Brian asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;How about if she says she's happy you leave our pack alone,&quot; Jensen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't agree,&quot; Madam Serenity said hastily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jensen, Kaylee, Alice,&quot; Felicity said thinking of something. &quot;To you three I have a question. Transform or Dare?&quot;<br />
<br />
All three said, &quot;Transform,&quot; at the same time. Then Jensen laughed and said, &quot;You just wasted your turn since we're locked in our wolf forms.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brian and Madam Serenity were staring at Felicity like she had gone mad. She had already used her turn on Ashley. Felicity didn't pay them any mind however as she said, &quot;For your transformation you will transform into a person who can appreciate everything you, and your Master, and all your pack mates: have done, are doing, and will do, with perfect objectivity.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen and Kaylee chuckled at that for a moment before the pain hit. They grabbed their heads and howled as what they have done and what they have been thinking about doing suddenly hit them. Both fell to their knees and Jensen asked, &quot;What have I done? I turned my own and Kaylee's parents into our children. I've made Marcine and Jack into deer so they could provide a heard for us to feed on. I didn't give anyone a chance to willingly accept being a part of the pack. I turned people into statues and gargoyles.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's alright Daddy,&quot; Cassii said hugging Jensen. &quot;You were under the influence of the curse. It's purpose is to spread misery and to grow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Marcine and jack are stuck as deer though with no way to change back,&quot; Jensen said. &quot;They can't talk to us so they can't answer the question.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cassii smiled and said, &quot;Cindii must be a fortune teller since when she transformed me she gave me the ability to talk to all animals. I still have my turn so I can ask them that question though I have to get Cindii's permission first.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about the statues though?&quot; Jensen asked. &quot;They can't speak.&quot;<br />
<br />
'I may have an idea,' Candii said. 'If I remember correctly Rachael had added 'and others' to our ability to speak to each other through you.'<br />
<br />
Jensen stiffened in surprise and asked, &quot;Who said that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who said what?&quot; nearly everyone asked.<br />
<br />
'It seems we can speak to them through you Cassii as long as you're touching them,' Candii said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then you may be able to speak to the statues if they're still aware Mommy Candii,&quot; Cassii said smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean I was hearing your dress?&quot; Jensen asked looking puzzled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Cassii said, &quot;you were hearing Mommy Candii in your mind through me. You must be a fortune teller too Rachael.&quot;<br />
<br />
'I'm not Cassii,' Rachael said. 'I just put that in there because I was going to turn Cindii into a doll and I wanted them to still be able to talk to her.'<br />
<br />
&quot;So what's Rachael?&quot; Jensen asked having heard Rachael.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rachael is my locket,&quot; Cassii said. &quot;I'll tell you the story later.&quot;<br />
<br />
Madam Serenity looked at Felicity and asked, &quot;How did you do that? You used your turn on Ashley.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's obvious,&quot; Cassii said breaking her hug. &quot;She had two turns and only used one of them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How can someone have two turns?&quot; Jensen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's simple really,&quot; Cassii said. &quot;The way it happens is for someone who has a turn to ask you the question and you had already been asked before but haven't used that turn yet. In theory you could store up to an infinite amount of turns but I would advise against that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why is that?&quot; Kaylee asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;The curse is semi-sentient at least,&quot; Cassii said. &quot;It's sentience grows every time the number of turns increases. If all the turns became stored in one individual the curse could gain full sentience and become a big menace.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then we have to stop it,&quot; Madam Serenity said. &quot;I have been given something that will wipe out someone's turn if they have one without it being used.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That won't work,&quot; Cassii said shaking her head sadly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why not?&quot; Madam Serenity asked thinking she wasn't going to like the answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because the five witches didn't curse the people,&quot; Cassii said. She sighed before continuing, &quot;They cursed Glendale itself. Even if all the turns are cancelled the curse will remain and in time will find someone to start it again. Why do you think the curse has had quiet spells before? It's because people were transformed into inanimate objects or animals that couldn't talk. They couldn't pass the curse on so their turn lays dormant and eventually there's no one to pass it on. That is until the curse finds someone to start it again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All those turns going unused,&quot; Gill said shaking his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;So we can't win with this curse,&quot; Madam Serenity said sadly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't say we couldn't win,&quot; Cassii said. &quot;All I said was that getting rid of everyone's turn wouldn't end it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then how do we end the curse?&quot; Madam Serenity asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;The answer is simple,&quot; Cassii said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Glendale is cursed,&quot; Alice said in a thoughtful voice. &quot;Therefore if Glendale was changed to another name Glendale would no longer exist...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And thus the curse would be broken,&quot; Cassii said finishing Alice's sentence. &quot;At least as long as it didn't get renamed Glendale again.&quot; Just then she felt the curse get highly angry and said, &quot;The curse didn't like me telling you that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can sense the curse?&quot; Madam Serenity asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can sense it's mood,&quot; Cassii said. &quot;Like I know it hates someone but I don't know who.&quot;<br />
<br />
Madam Serenity nodded then turned to Alice and asked, &quot;You didn't seem to be affected like the other two Alice. Why is that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have always been able to see what we have done and will do with perfect objectivity,&quot; Alice stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then why have you done what I asked if you knew it was wrong?&quot; Jensen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because you asked me to Father,&quot; Alice replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright from now on if I ask you to do something that you know is wrong tell me,&quot; Jensen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Father,&quot; Alice replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;If the bet's still on I'll take it,&quot; Brian said bringing up the bet again. &quot;That is if Cassii will tell the truth which I'm kind of doubting since she has called Jensen Daddy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen looked at Cassii and said, &quot;Cassii, I want you to tell the truth. Are you happy with what you are now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If I said I was you would have no idea if I truly was since my mind may have been transformed,&quot; Cassii said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think we can safely say her mind wasn't transformed when she was,&quot; Madam Serenity said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I agree,&quot; Brian said. &quot;I don't think anyone who had their mind transformed would say they may have had their mind transformed. I'll believe what she says.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Go ahead and tell them if you're happy with who you are,&quot; Jensen said looking just a bit worried about the answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Other than the incident with my family being transformed into inanimate objects and the last three days with my foster parents I've been very happy,&quot; Cassii said smiling. &quot;When Cindii said she wanted a little sister like herself and asked if I would like to be her sister I agreed after she told me what she planned on doing.&quot; She frowned then continued, &quot;I miss our monthly runs in the woods where we were adult wolf women for two days.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean you can get older?&quot; Madam Serenity asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes,&quot; Cassii said. &quot;Cindii was the oldest in the family until she was cursed. The guy made her ten years old and able to shift into a glass wolf pup who could travel through mirrors and an adult wolf woman once a month for two days and not being able to age otherwise. He wanted to drive her crazy with that last part. Being able to be an adult again but a wolf woman who may not be able to play adult games because she was a wolf. She accepted it though and didn't really feel any real loss at not being able to have children of her own.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about you?&quot; Jensen asked. &quot;You gave up being able to have children too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I had made my peace with that long before I came to Glendale,&quot; Cassii said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then I'm a man of my word when it comes to bets,&quot; Brian said. &quot;We'll leave your pack alone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But we still need to undo the mental transformation on his pack,&quot; Madam Serenity said shocked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll do that,&quot; Jensen said. &quot;I'm the alpha male of my pack after all and they are my responsibility.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just so you know the ones that broke into the Hardy's home and assaulted them will need to face justice,&quot; Gill said. &quot;If you're going to be a part of this society you have to live by it's rules.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Jensen said. &quot;And I'll face justice myself once my pack is sorted.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My love you can't do that,&quot; Kaylee said horrified.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just about the whole pack will have to face justice my love,&quot; Jensen said. &quot;Just about all of us are guilty of kidnapping and yes, what we did is kidnapping. The only ones I don't see having to face justice are the newest pups since they haven't done anything yet. And Cassii, I welcome you into the pack or what will be left of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Daddy,&quot; Cassii said smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now down to business,&quot; Jensen said as he turned to Alice. &quot;Alice, I want you to right up a transform wording it very carefully so the pack will have their minds cleared like ours have been. I also want you to add a clause to stop any further mental transformations in them. From now on if we use the curse to add to the pack we'll make sure that the people are willing to join. I know of one child who would like to and I believe Isabella got his name.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It should be ready soon Father,&quot; Alice said. &quot;I need pen and paper though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Here,&quot; Gill said holding out a pen and pad of paper to the mirror. Cassii took it since she was closer and gave it to Alice.<br />
<br />
As Alice started working on the wording Madam Serenity said, &quot;We need to discuss how we're going to get the town's name changed and what we'll do about the pride.&quot;</p>
