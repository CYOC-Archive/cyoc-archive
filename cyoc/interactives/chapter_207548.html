<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">He had to play along… for now. It wasn’t going to last, he made sure it wouldn’t last. But until he saw a way out of this mess, he had to play the part of the loyal cabin boy. Swabbing the ships deck, enduring the lecherous sailors, and just hoping he would be able to sleep by himself tonight. The rush of so many new crewmembers meant that the pirates weren’t too direct with Nate. Most were already spent from the cells, or had made good use of the other cabin boy. <br />
<br />
Just like the rowing from earlier, Nate found the simplest tasks hard. He was small, thin, and weak. The constant movement of grabbing buckets, mops, and bending over to clean was taking its toll. He was half tempted to give up and just throw the supplies away. But that would piss off the captain, and Nate didn’t want that. <br />
<br />
He pushed through the pains and aches to make sure it was a job well done. The deck and cabins were spotless, the other cabin boy preparing meals for the crew. He finally had time to himself, sneakily grabbing a plate and preparing to run off to a quiet corner of the ship. Stopped by the first mate who grabs Nate’s shoulder and offers a toothy grin.<br />
<br />
“Captain Strongarm wishes to speak to ye.”<br />
<br />
Oh great, the captain again. He did his job perfectly, and the captain still wanted to see him. Was it not enough? Couldn’t he just have some private time alone? Nate knew better than to disobey the crew, setting aside his meal and going to the back room of this floor. Finding the unexpected on the other side.<br />
<br />
Strongarm was laying in his bed, completely naked and on top of the sheets. Grey and orange hairs lining his dad bod. One arm resting by his side, the other behind his head. Showing off hairy pits, and stinking up the room with his BO. It smells of sweat, a hard smell which almost knocks Nate off his feet. The cabin boy finding a strange fascination with the scent. Basking in the rich texture, just letting it fill him up and drive him forward.<br />
<br />
“Ye hungry for me cock, Nate?”<br />
<br />
The cabin boy looked to the hirsute captain. Eying his pulsing cock as his stomach grumbled. He was hungry, and he needed his fill. Approaching the pirate and preparing to join him on the bed. The Captain shaking his head as he starts to climb on.<br />
<br />
“First, ye want me cock in your mouth. Savvy?”<br />
<br />
Nate nods, the captain shaking his head again.<br />
“Say it.”<br />
“I-I want your cock in my mouth!”<br />
<br />
He couldn’t believe what he was saying. Admitting to the captain that he craved dick. Nate knew that he wouldn’t be saying this if he wasn’t drunk off the pirate’s musk. But he wasn’t thinking in this moment, he just accepted his words and finally climbed onto the sheets. <br />
<br />
The captain embraced his underling as the two got closer. Smothered against his barrel of a chest, Nate looking up past the hills of skin and hair. Beaming at his captain, then bringing his nose down the pirate’s body. Pressing it into his hairy pubes, taking a whiff of what he had to offer. Just as pungent as the scent from his pits, just as appealing as he finally starts to line up his mouth with Strongarms cock.<br />
<br />
He slowly lowers himself, wetting the captains dick with his mouth. It’s a perfect fit, as if designed to the exact specifications of the pirate before him. Cock rubbing inside him, stretching him wider as he starts a regular motion. Down to his pubes, then back up to the tip. Sometimes toying with the pirate, licking the top of his cock, or deepthroating himself for several seconds. Whatever he can do to please the captain, who starts to grab onto the cabin boy. Forcing him still and giving him his fill.<br />
<br />
“Drink, son. Ye need it to grow up strong.”<br />
<br />
Son? Nate doesn&#39;t question it, the captains’ words are just music to his ears. He wants to do nothing but drink down his fill. Swallowing the waves of spunk that are deposited into him. Chest heaving as he takes more and more. Some of what he lost finally being returned. His weak arms tired from the cleaning were gaining the slightest bit of muscle. Smooth and hairless chest pressing out, as short hairs grow between his pecs. <br />
<br />
Though the changes don’t stop there.  Unbeknownst to Nate, his brow thickens, and nose grows. The slightest change that none but the captain would notice, as it draws closer to his bushy brows and bulbous nose. A few hairs on Nate’s head turning a light red, as the drunk cabin boy finally finishes his drink. Swallowing what remains in his mouth, then jerking his own cock. Shooting his load into the sheets, as Captain Strongarm brings a hand around Nate’s back. Holding him tightly against his own chest, as the two men doze off to sleep.<br />
<br />
Nate wakes the next day feeling strange. His body is burning a bit, probably from all the work he did. Everything’s a bit blurry as he looks down and see a bit more muscle on him, hey, maybe the work is going to pay off. Though where is he? He can’t remember anything, besides knowing that whatever happened last night felt good. He saw another arm on him, the captains in fact. The older pirate still holding him tight against his naked chest. <br />
<br />
Realisation sets in, Nate still having the aftertaste of pirate spunk in his mouth. It still tastes good too, damn it this isn’t right. He looks to the unconscious captain, a strange sense of belonging and love taking over. This is getting worse and worse, he doesn’t know how much time he has left.</p>
