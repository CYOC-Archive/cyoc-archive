<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">He wiggled his new toes, &quot;Big hands, big feet, big cock...&quot; he thought to himself as he decided to go see his friend David. <br />
<br />
Now Ryan had his eyes on David for a while now. He was almost sure he was bisexual and until now he stayed pretty quiet about that. Although now after his transformation he had the confidence to just be open about it. He had caught David eyeing him once or twice, he seemed interested but Ryan never had the guts to ask, but now he wouldn&#39;t have a problem openly asking his friend if he was gay or not.<br />
<br />
David was certainly not bad looking in any way. First thing that should be said was that David was a football player. He was about 6&#39;4&quot; with a nice tan, and a mix of muscle and fat that any good football player needs. He doesn&#39;t fit any stereotype in fact he has slightly above average grades, not quite enough for honors but in the A- or B+ range. So pretty decent considering average was about a C. <br />
<br />
But after practices the team showers together which results in most of the team being rather homophobic. Ryan suspected that David didn&#39;t come out for fear of ridicule from his team, but he couldn&#39;t be completely sure. That&#39;s why he was off to go see David with his new found confidence to find out.<br />
<br />
It was after football practice that Ryan had showed up as the football players were leaving the locker room. Ryan didn&#39;t want to just barge right in. Eventually David came out and Ryan greatest him. David didn&#39;t recognize him though as he&#39;s changes were that extreme. He wasn&#39;t bad looking but now he certainly didn&#39;t look like the Ryan that everyone knew.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey David&quot; Ryan said. David wasn&#39;t too surprised though, being on the football team people knew his name when he didn&#39;t really know them. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh hey&quot; he said not sure what the dudes name was. &quot;I&#39;m sorry dude what&#39;s your name?&quot; <br />
<br />
Hot and still respectful too. Ryan thought. That was another way David didn&#39;t quite fit the stereotype, he wasn&#39;t a bully in fact he couldn&#39;t tolerate fighting or anything like that unless it had to do with the sport he was playing. &quot;Dude it&#39;s me Ryan&quot; he said as if it were obvious.<br />
<br />
&quot;No way, you don&#39;t look like Ryan&quot; David said. &quot;For real who are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No seriously I&#39;m Ryan&quot; he insisted. David couldn&#39;t help but feel himself get a little hard at this guy, he was cute. But he tried to push those thoughts out, he couldn&#39;t deal with the insults or backlash from the team if everyone knew he was gay. Ryan then went on to explain what happened to him at the shoe store earlier. <br />
<br />
Now David really was hard at the idea of Ryan becoming this cute Geeky dude, that would be awesome. Admittedly it was weird but still sounded pretty cool. <br />
<br />
Ryan didn&#39;t want to humiliate David with what he was planning to do but at least the bulge in his pants told Ryan that his suspicions were accurate. So he asked David if they could hang out at one of their houses, and David agreed to going to Ryan&#39;s.<br />
<br />
A few hours later David arrived. Ryan explained an idea he had that maybe the shoes could work on David just as they had on himself. David was a bit weirded out but get hard again at the thought of becoming a cute geek. He wanted to get rid of those thoughts, but Ryan was the only one here, it&#39;s not like the team would catch his hard on this time. David agreed to give it a try as Ryan took of the All-Stars and handed them over to David.<br />
<br />
David slipped them on and at first felt nothing. Then he groaned as he felt his feet push forward and grow to a new size to fit the shoes. &quot;Crap this actually works?&quot; He gasped in surprise. He believed Ryan but didn&#39;t really think they would have worked a second time. He felt himself shrink very slightly to 6&#39;1&quot;, the exact same height as Ryan. He felt his chest flatten no longer having the bulging muscles needed for football but becoming lean muscle. <br />
<br />
He gasped as he felt his hands stretch and crack as they grew larger, proportionate to his bigger feet. He felt his hair grow out into a bit of a messy look, not quite as messy as Ryan&#39;s but more so than his normal. His face began to shift and change still looking handsome but not quite as manly as the jock had looked before he just had more of an attractive boyish charm to him now. <br />
<br />
He felt some alterations to his mind as his intelligence stayed just about the same but he got a slightly more geeky personality. He wasn&#39;t as into sports or working out anymore but still really cared about his health and taking care of his body. He moaned just a bit as he felt his dick grow a few more inches and got harder than before. <br />
<br />
He felt more confident and open about himself and decided to stop ignoring his feelings as he grabbed Ryan and the two began to kiss. With his new form he wouldn&#39;t have to worry what the team thinks of him as he could admit that he liked Ryan especially now with his adorkable body. <br />
<br />
The two appear toy bi geeks embraced each other as they could now start better lives together.</p>
