<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Warning: It's long...<br />
-Intro-<br />
It was the middle of summer and Bryce Myres stood at the doorway waving as his parents departed for their 20th anniversary trip. They <br />
have been saving up for a special getaway for this very occasion and finally the waiting was over. They decided on a trip to Italy <br />
complete with a few days in Rome, tours through vineyards, and skiing in the Alps. It was gonna be a memorable trip.<br />
<br />
Bryce was already 17 so they decided that he would be alright alone, being an only child, for two and a half weeks. Bryce had been left <br />
alone before and knew how to look after himself and the house, so off his parents went leaving him a credit card for groceries, which <br />
also wasn't a problem since the stores were just a few blocks away. As his parents drove away Bryce went back inside and began <br />
thinking of stuff to do while his parents had the time of their lives.<br />
<br />
There really wasn't much to do now, since Bryce had broken up with his boyfriend after summer started and his bestfirend, Leslie(a boy) <br />
wasn't coming home from camp for another week. That's right, Bryce was gay, and everyone knew about it. He had always been a good <br />
guy around everyone so he was pretty well liked, and when he came out, nobody started bashing him for it but just shrugged it off, also <br />
because there were already three gay guys in the school, Leslie being one of them.<br />
<br />
Bryce and Leslie were best friends, but only that, they thought that dating would just make things awkward, so they each approached <br />
one of the other gay boys and things just clicked. Obviously Bryce didn't quite make it and Leslie had to break it off while he was at <br />
camp, leaving Bryce utterly alone.<br />
<br />
-Enter The Cyoc Store-<br />
Bryce pretty much just watched tv, ate, cleaned up a bit, surfed the web, and slept for the rest of the day. Boring as he had initially <br />
thought when he was told he was being left alone.<br />
<br />
The next day, Bryce slept in but was awakened by an odd feeling around noon. Something just didn't feel right in the air but he ignored <br />
it and continued with his morning(afternoon). Deciding on riding his bike around(he never got his drivers license yet), he ate some <br />
cereal and got dressed. He got his bike from his front yard and rode around back to check that the back door was locked while he was <br />
gone.<br />
<br />
Bryce's bike ride didn't last long as he skidded to a stop at the backyard. There stood a door, plain white with a sign beside it reading:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&quot;Cyoc Store! Make your wildest dreams come true!&quot;<br />
<br />
He cautiously approached the door, wondering if this was some kind of joke. He looked at it at all angles and found that it was just a <br />
plain looking door that seemed to stand on it's own as if it were supported by the air on it's brass hinges. He tapped it warily and <br />
jumped back when a voice called, &quot;Come in!&quot;. Thoroughly curious, Bryce grabbed the doorknob, slowly opened the door, and poked his <br />
head in the impossible, yet unmistakably real shop.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well don't be shy guy and come on in,&quot; said a boy about his age standing right by the opening. He was taller than Bryce, maybe 6' and <br />
wasn't exactly thin but fit. His blond hair was a little long with a bit of a curl and almost covered his blue and...green eye? Other that <br />
that, the guy looked ordinary and was dressed in blue jeans, a white shirt, and tool belt with odd gadgets. &quot;Speechless huh?&quot; said the <br />
boy as he stepped aside to let the awe struck boy in.<br />
<br />
-Getting Started-<br />
When Bryce finally a snapped out of it, he turned to the smiling boy asking, &quot;What is this place?&quot;. It was definitely a store, yet all the <br />
shelves and containers set up were empty. Light seemed to come from the ceiling, yet no lights could be seen. There was a counter to <br />
the side with a only a register, a clipboard, and a pen. There was also a flatscreen monitor attached to the wall behind the counter that <br />
appeared to be off and not plugged to anything.<br />
<br />
&quot;This, my friend, is the Cyoc Store!&quot; announced the boy, gesturing to the empty store.<br />
<br />
&quot;But-&quot;. &quot;...there's nothing here?&quot; said the boy finishing his sentence, &quot;Well there will be once we get started, so are you ready?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, sure,&quot; Bryce answered hesitantly, &quot;for what exactly?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll see,&quot; answered the boy, leading Bryce to the counter towards the clipboard. &quot;Now if you would just fill out the information here,&quot; <br />
said the boy as he handed Bryce the clipboard with a single sheet asking for personal and seemingly random information.<br />
<br />
Bryce just went along with it filling out every blank honestly:<br />
<br />

<br />
Once he was done, he gave the clipboard to the boy who told him to wait a moment and disappeared to the back room. After a few <br />
minutes, Bryce noticed the screen beginning to flicker as his information began appearing and a 3d image of himself as he looked now.<br />
<br />
The boy came back out and went behind the counter. &quot;All set,&quot; announced the boy, &quot;feel free to check out out merchandise and just give <br />
me a shout if something interests you. My name in Xander and I'll be your repairman.&quot;<br />
<br />
Repairman? Anyway Bryce was so intrigued by the monitor he didn't notice that the shelves had somehow filled up with an odd <br />
collection of items, random things like some software called &quot;Chronivac&quot;, various vials full of colorful liquids, different kinds of jewelry, a <br />
wide array of clothes and body suits, and even an aisle full of sex stuff. Bryce really began to get curious now about what kind of store <br />
this was.<br />
<br />
-Possibilities-<br />
Bryce looked back at Xander who eagerly looked on and said, &quot;Don't be afraid to try anything, I'll be here if anything were to happen.&quot; <br />
What did he mean by that!?<br />
<br />
Bryce just walked off to see what he could find...</p>
