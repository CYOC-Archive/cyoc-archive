<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">John entered the bedroom, finding Andrew sitting on an empty bed, now devoid of anything on the surface. The shades had been drawn and a few candles had been lit and placed throughout the room, giving the bedroom a new aura. Once much more romantic than before.<br />
<br />
“I’ve been waiting for you,” Andrew said and gestured John to come closer. In seconds John was standing in front of Andrew, the man grinning as he observed John carefully.<br />
<br />
“First, I don’t think you’ll be needing this.” Andrew unbuttoned John’s cum-stained shorts and pulled them down, leaving them bunched around his feet. His feet were bare, no shoes he owned capable of fitting his bigger feet, resorting him to walking around barefoot. However, that wasn’t what Andrew was focusing on, more interested in John’s lack of undergarments. “My, what a naughty boy. Going commando are we?”<br />
<br />
John had been unable to find a suitable pair of underwear for his larger body, his boxers now sizes too small for him, leaving him to only wear his XXL t-shirt and baggy shorts. But John hadn’t found himself freeballing problematic, assuming there wouldn’t be a time when he would have it come up. If only he knew.<br />
<br />
John’s face turned a bright red as he stood naked in front of Andrew, the words Andrew said only fueling his embarrassment as his body stood proudly on display for his neighbor. As expected, John felt shame from his current position, yet, the feelings from before were back, excitement coursing through his body as the tingle at his ass returned. It wasn’t long before John’s cock rose, rising to its 14 inch erect length as arousal flooded him.<br />
<br />
“I see you’re still excited. Is that what was troubling you before?” Andrew put his index finger on John’s shaft, moving it slowly to the head where pre had already begun to form. He then began to trace John’s glans with his finger, his mouth forming a devilish smile. “But don’t worry, I am too.”<br />
<br />
Despite the lust that overwhelmed him, John tried to retaliate against his neighbor’s advances, the former straight man protesting his new gay desires. However, the black pill still had a great hold on him, not giving him much power to resist. In the end he can only mutter a single, “We can’t!” in between his shallow breaths, the words taking an incredibly large amount of effort to say.<br />
<br />
“Hmm? Why not?” Andrew raised his eyebrow at John, surprised at his sudden retaliation. “Are you worried about my age? Trust me, in spite of how I look, I’m actually 28.”<br />
<br />
Like John’s previous appearance, Andrew looked like a basic guy. He had short black hair, bright blue eyes, and pale skin. He also looked much younger for his age, his lack of facial hair, thin build, and short stature giving him a boyish look. It didn’t help that he was slightly immature, usually driving John and others up the wall with his childish and pushy personality. However, where John had only seen a nuisance before, he could only see an attractive twink. One he was willing to submit to despite his larger and muscular form.<br />
<br />
“Now, undress me.”<br />
<br />
John fingers moved to Andrew’s torso, tugging the shirt off the smaller man and pulling it off him. Next followed his jeans, John undoing Andrew’s belt and pulling the pants down, leaving Andrew only in his boxers where an impressive bulge could be seen. With a quick tug, John was met with something he had not expected on Andrew: a girthy and long cock that was rock hard. It must’ve measured 10 inches! This was definitely not something the average guy had.<br />
<br />
John stared at the member with lustful eyes, the twinge in his ass growing even stronger. “What’s wrong with me?” John thought as his gay desires grew even stronger, leaving the previously straight man confused as to what his body now craved. The same could not be said for Andrew, who wore a smug look on his face. He knew exactly what John wanted. And he was going to give it to him.<br />
<br />
“Be a good boy and lie down. I’ll get everything set up.” Andrew stood off the bed and pushed John to it, the powerful man toppling over easily, his legs feeling as if they were made of jelly, as he fell on to the bed and laid on his back. Grabbing a bottle of lube off a nearby dresser, Andrew vigorously lathered his fingers before drawing them closer to John’s ass, his hole pulsating from its need.<br />
<br />
John winced as he felt a cold and slimy finger meet his asshole, the finger slowly pushing itself in as his entrance greedily accepted it. John then let out a loud moan, the finger giving him a new pleasurable sensation. As Andrew began fingering him, making sure to prepare John well enough, he inserted two more fingers along the way causing John to squirm continuously on the bed. The large man was being deeply affected by Andrew’s actions, losing himself in a daze of lust, despite his sexuality.<br />
<br />
Andrew pulled his fingers out, a small “shlorp” produced as they exited. “Okay, now that I got you all nice and ready, we can begin.” Andrew got some more lube and lathered his tool, making sure to apply generously before he brought his dick to John’s ass. John’s hole was pulsating again, seeking something to fill it, and in a single thrust, Andrew pushed his entire cock inside.<br />
<br />
“Ungh!” John moaned, surprised at the foreign object now lodged up his lubricated ass. It felt painful but not much, a blissful feeling overtaking him more from the arrival of the large and warm object. Andrew lifted John’s hairy thick legs and, holding on to them, began to fuck John.<br />
<br />
John continued moaning as he felt Andrew’s dick repeatedly slam into him, the girthy cock removed from him before forcefully pushed back in, hitting his prostate over and over. By now, John’s dick was leaking copious amounts of pre-cum, leaving a glossy layer over his hairy abs as his dick twitched and jerked in response to his arousal.<br />
<br />
The two continued to engage in sex, the smaller man fucking the brains out of the bigger one. Odors of lube and pre blending in with the sweet smells of the candles. John cummed first, a large load of semen splattering onto his pecs and stomach. However, Andrew didn’t cum, he just continued to fuck John, leading him to ejaculate a second time. This time some of the cum reached his mouth, entering his opened jaws and quickly being swallowed. It tasted delicious to John, not even aware of what he had done, as he lost himself to the pleasure Andrew gave him.<br />
<br />
Finally, Andrew reached his final edge as he released into John, his warm seed filling John up as he cummed. Removing his cock from John’s asshole, he laid next to the huge man and panted, exhausted from the sex.<br />
<br />
As the two laid side by side, covered in lube and white bodily fluids, a strange sensation crept into John. One of pure happiness and content. Was it… love? He couldn’t be sure. It had been a while since he felt something truly like this, his ex not giving him the same feeling since the first time they began dating.<br />
<br />
“Hey, come closer to me,” Andrew said, pulling John toward him. As the norm now was, John obeyed. He moved closer to Andrew, his neighbor pulling him into a warm embrace as he drifted off to sleep. It wasn’t too long before John followed suit and fell asleep, a smile on his face as he nestled closer to Andrew.</p>
