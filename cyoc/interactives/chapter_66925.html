<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Just as Mark's laughter was dying down, I leaped towards him and tried to slide the ring off his finger. If I could get my hands on the wishing ring, maybe I could put an end to this craziness. I didn't know if it was possible to un-wish wishes made but I thought that I could slow down my transformation so much that it wouldn't complete even in a thousand years.<br />
<br />
My body felt funny, but I could see that nothing visible happened to me so far. I still had my male strength and size and to be honest as far as the sportiness of us two nerds was concerned, even though Mark was taller than me I was definitely the stronger one. I still had some chance...<br />
<br />
I hit his hand knocking the ring off his finger. I saw, almost like in slow motion, the magical object flying through the air, both me and Mark trying to catch it.<br />
<br />
I pushed him to the side with one of my hands and reached with the other to catch the precious projectile...<br />
<br />
I did it! I caught it. I felt like a goddamn Harry Potter catching the golden snitch!<br />
<br />
Now I could put an end to this madness. I stood up looking at Mark.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish&quot; I began when Mark suddenly interrupted me.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't want you to speak!&quot; he shouted still lying on the floor after I pushed him<br />
<br />
Why should I listen to you, you scum? I thought and tried to finish the wish I started but I found it impossible to move my lips. I was struggling to make a sound and apparently my struggle was clearly visible on my face as I saw a nasty grin creeping onto Mark's face.<br />
<br />
&quot;You see Jon&quot; he said slowly standing up &quot;I think that because I wished you to become a girl you have to listen to me now... It doesn't matter whether your transformation is complete or not; I wished you to be a girl so sooner or later you'll become one. The universe might just treat you as one now already! And that means I can use my Fem-Master influence on you!&quot;<br />
<br />
That was a great fiasco of my plan. I couldn't wish anything if I couldn't speak. The ring was of no use to me!<br />
<br />
But I still had my fists. I jumped forward to Mark wanting to beat him up but he, again, was faster.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want you to stop where you are and don't move!&quot;<br />
<br />
Again, I felt my body stopping to move, listening to Mark's command rather than my own. It was a horror. I knew that many terrible things might, or rather will, happen to me. It was just a matter of time...<br />
<br />
&quot;So Josh, you want to fight with your old friend. Make love not war! And you can be sure there will be love made later, when you're more suitable for it...&quot;<br />
<br />
I just couldn't comprehend it. How could a person get so drunk on power? How could my friend turn into... this evil madman!<br />
<br />
&quot;But you seemed you wanted to make a wish, didn't you Jon? I won't take this pleasure away form my friend... Go ahead, I want you to make a wish which will please me...&quot;<br />
<br />
Now, that was even weirder... Instead of my muscles simply not working I felt them start to move on their own. My mouth opened and I heard words coming out of it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish&quot; I started involuntarily &quot;that every bit of masculinity taken away form me was added to Mark.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes, YES! Thank you Jon, you're too kind! Now, why don't you reward yourself? I want you to wish for something that will make your new life harder...&quot;<br />
<br />
Again, I felt a wish I didn't conjure leave my mouth. I shuddered when I heard it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish the girl I am becoming to be weak and frail, even for the new standards.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha! Great!&quot; Mark cheered &quot;I really enjoyed this one! Do it again! Wish for something that will make you feel more miserable!&quot;<br />
<br />
Why didn't he stop that?! Why did he have to play with me so much... Didn't he know how much I hated what was happening..?<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish the girl I am becoming to be the cutest teen in town, as well as the one with the widest hips and the leanest waist.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good. Again. Wish again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish the girl I am becoming to be hyper-fertile and allergic to contraceptives.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish the girl I am becoming to have an extremely high-pitched voice and a tendency to be particularly loud during sex, whether she enjoys it or not...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;AGAIN!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish the girl I am becoming to have the longest tongue of all the humans which makes it hard for her to talk but allows her to give the best blowjobs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;AGAIN!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish the girl I am becoming to be extremely easy to sexually arouse and to have an over-lubricating vagina.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;HA, HA, Ha, ha! Now THIS is going to be interesting. I can have any woman I want but why do I feel that it's going to be YOU I'm going to take advantage of most?&quot;<br />
<br />
I wanted to wake up. I hoped this was some sort of bad dream so hard... But it wasn't. I described the new womanhood earlier and now I was to become a girl. A girl with some 'enhancements' I wished upon myself just a few seconds before. And I couldn't do anything about it...<br />
<br />
&quot;Now I want you to give me the ring back.&quot;<br />
<br />
I felt myself reach out my hand to Mark giving him the stone. He smiled in a disturbing manner.<br />
<br />
&quot;A few things first before I allow you to move freely. Firstly I don't want you ever to attack me or talk other people into attacking me. Secondly I don't want you to ever use the ring unless I ask you to. Thirdly whenever I don't want you around I want you to start looking for any man that could fuck you. And by the way, I wish that anyone who screws you gets an extreme boost to his stamina so he ends up fucking you until you virtually fall unconscious form exhaustion. This of course includes me. And finally I want you to get a full control over your body now and check yourself out, cause it became pretty apparent by now that you're changing...&quot;</p>
