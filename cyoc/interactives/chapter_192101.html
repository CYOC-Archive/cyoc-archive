<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Old Man Jenkins... That&#39;s what the neighborhood called him. The nosy old man who would peer out his window to make sure the kids weren&#39;t messing up his lawn or, if some poor soul who dare knocked on his door, get a verbal shouting from the crotchety old man! Jenkins seemed like something out of a standard sitcom, complete with him wearing a robe and boxer shorts when he answered his door. His round belly would press tight against the robe&#39;s snugness as a pair of slippers graced his feet, glasses perched on his large nose, judging brown eyes just behind the lenses and his head mostly bald with a stretch of white hair circling the sides and back while his chin had a thick beard thus completing his old man look.<br />
<br />
In short, he seemed like someone who could use a little more gayness... er, happiness in his life. As soon as he heard the sounds of a couple of young voices drift by his house, Old Man Jenkins rushed to his feet to see if those young voices were of people coming to ruin his peace and quiet. The chubby old man pulled back the curtain of his house, looking out into the neighborhood to see a pair of young wolf-men, one with white fur, the other pitch black with blue highlights, holding hands as they approached your house. Old Man Jenkins scoffed as he saw the two wolf-men wearing no clothes, letting the whole world see their bare butts and swaying furry balls.<br />
<br />
&quot;How disgraceful,&quot; Old Man Jenkins mumbled to himself, not realizing his own cock began to rise with excitement, &quot;There should be a law about being... clothed.&quot;<br />
<br />
The old man&#39;s words started to change as his robe, boxer shorts and even slippers disappeared with only his glasses left. The old man stood naked before his neighborhood as all he could do was stare at the two wolf-men, their balls looking so ample and soft.<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean... uh... I bet those balls would feel so nice in my han... paws,&quot; Jenkins said, just as his own bells began to grow larger while white fur grew on them, &quot;Ohh... They seem such nice... HOT... wolves.&quot;<br />
<br />
The old man grunted and whimpered as his ears grew into points, his nose and face soon stretching outwards causing his tongue to lag out and his glasses to do a balancing act before his brown eyes. Old Man Jenkins&#39;s hands grew hairier and hairier, the nails stretching out into points as his face finally formed into that of a fine wolf-muzzle, his ears finishing soon after. The old beast grunted as his feet grew larger, thicker, adapting to his ample size. The pair of longboats grew hairier and hairier, like his hands, with the toes each getting a shiny claw to match! Jenkins grunted and panted, leaning forward as he started making thrusting motions at the two wolf-men who entered your house, feeling something pull on his rear as he did so. With each thrust he could feel something getting close to release... One, two, THREE! Pop! With a long whine of pleasure, a white fluffy tail emerge from his rear, tipped with icy blue hairs as the blue hairs formed around the old wolf&#39;s crack while the white hairs thickened over the rest of the area, moving quickly to give the now horny beast a proper fur coat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yesss....,&quot; Jenkins hissed as his thoughts of the three of them in a romp at the local bar, his belly on the rail as he gets pounded by the wolf-man with the pitch black fur and blue highlights, the other one giving his muzzle a workout. It would be like the old days when he was a younger pup and showing the pack he used to run with how to handle a mighty red rod.<br />
<br />
The old wolf had finished his changes, his fingers and toes now covered in the same icy-blue fur as his tail-tip and rear crack while the same blue graced his chest and belly as well as around his now hefty nuts. The thick beard still gracing his now canine muzzle, with the tips now in that icy-blue color while his claws were each tipped in red. Only the top of his head remained bare from fur as the old beast began to feel a passion he hasn&#39;t felt in forever. The old wolf let out a loud howl, echoing the lustful call throughout his house, as his cock erupted against the window making it stain with what felt like YEARS of pent up frustration. When the sensation of his pure eruption finally subsided after the moment feeling like eternity, Jenkins wobbled back to his recliner leaving a trail of spent seed behind him, where he slumped down and let his round belly press on his still hard rod and thick thighs. The old wolf closed his eyes and began playing with his round furry gut, massaging it as his thoughts began to wander.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw, those boys looked so sweet,&quot; Old Wolf Jenkins sighed, &quot;I hope they will pay this old beast a visit before cumming home.&quot;<br />
<br />
And, with what seemed like a wish answered, the sound of his doorbell rang throughout his now musky smelling house. Jenkins opened his eyes and soon got up from his recliner to see who was at the door... Grunting and panting as he did so, his thoughts ran through the possibility of who could be on the other side of the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe some lovely people who need help from &#39;Grandpa&#39;,&quot; The old wolf chucked as he opened the door.<br />
<br />
There standing on his front porch was that of you, Cody and the neighbors, Michel and Jack. The group could see the old wolf&#39;s cock still dripping from the excitement from before, pooling that potent seed before them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Grandpa!&quot; You exclaimed, &quot;I wanted to bring the neighbors over... Michel and Jack... and have you meet them! Especially since you&#39;ve been so good with helping me with my thrusting technique for college credit!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenkins looked puzzled for a second before shaking his head, giving it a rub and laughing, &quot;Oh yes! I keep forgetting that! You know this old wolf needs a good pound in the head, as well as the ass, from time to time to remember things. Though I&#39;m sure after some time with me, your old professor is gonna get some pointers from YOU.&quot;<br />
<br />
You, Cody and the neighbors laugh at the jolly old wolf before the chubby beast moves back into the house.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cum in, cum in!&quot; Jenkins said as he motioned for the group to follow, &quot;I wanna hear all about what brought the new neighbors to our den in the suburbs! And maybe get in a quick study session, eh?&quot;</p>
