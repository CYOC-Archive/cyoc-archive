<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kenith sighed contentedly, looking up at his now older brother, Sam, with a mixture of admiration and affection. He didn’t quite understand why Sam had wanted to be twelve again—why he missed being older, more independent. Sam had said it was fun being six for a while, but he missed the freedom that came with being a twelve-year-old. He didn’t enjoy snuggling with Mom and Dad as much as Kenith did, and he definitely didn’t enjoy the limitations of being so young.<br />
<br />
But Kenith, on the other hand, loved everything about being six. He was perfectly happy being the cute little boy with long blonde hair, still small enough to climb into his mom’s arms after a long day, and still carefree enough to enjoy playing with his toy cars or rolling around on the floor. The world felt brighter at this age—innocent and full of wonder. He wouldn’t trade it for anything.<br />
<br />
As Kenith sat cross-legged on the floor, gazing up at his newly transformed twelve-year-old brother, he smiled. &quot;You’ve gotta be a good big brother now,&quot; he said with a playful grin, knowing exactly how to get under Sam’s skin.<br />
<br />
Sam, towering over Kenith with his long blonde hair, cool demeanor, and all the confidence of a preteen, smiled down at his little brother. &quot;I am the best big brother,&quot; he teased back, reaching down to sweep Kenith off the ground effortlessly, lifting him like he weighed nothing.<br />
<br />
Kenith squealed with laughter as Sam carried him over to his bed—now exclusively Kenith’s, since Sam had his own room again. Kenith’s tiny hands gripped Sam’s arms as his laughter filled the room, and Sam, with a mischievous grin, tossed his little brother onto the bed, watching him bounce slightly before launching into a full-on tickle attack.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sam! Nooo!&quot; Kenith giggled uncontrollably, squirming as Sam’s fingers danced across his sides, tickling him mercilessly. The sound of their playful wrestling echoed throughout the house, and in that moment, everything felt perfect. Sam had always been his twin, his equal, but now, as his older brother, Sam had embraced the role of protector, watching over Kenith with a new sense of responsibility.<br />
<br />
&quot;I’m going to be the best big brother in the world,&quot; Sam said with a laugh, his voice filled with warmth and affection. He continued tickling Kenith until the little boy was breathless with laughter, his face flushed from the joy of it all.<br />
<br />
After two hours of playing, laughing, and talking about all sorts of nonsense, Sam finally stood up, giving Kenith a mock-serious look. &quot;Alright, kiddo, time for me to do some twelve-year-old stuff—homework, video games, you know, boring older brother things.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kenith pouted for a moment, but the pout quickly faded into a smile. He knew Sam had his own responsibilities now, things that came with being older, but he also knew his brother would always be there when he needed him. &quot;Okay,&quot; he said, lying back on his bed with a contented sigh. &quot;I’ll be right here, playing with my cars.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam chuckled as he ruffled Kenith’s hair affectionately. &quot;Don’t get into too much trouble,&quot; he teased before heading out of the room, his long hair swaying as he walked out, leaving Kenith to his own world of imagination.<br />
<br />
The house felt warm, safe, and filled with love. Sam, now old enough to watch over Kenith, had fully embraced his role as the older brother, taking on the responsibility with pride. But even though Sam had his own life to live as a twelve-year-old, there was no doubt that the bond between the two brothers had only grown stronger.<br />
<br />
Later that afternoon, as the sun began to set and the house filled with the golden glow of the evening, Kenith heard the familiar sound of the front door opening. His heart leapt with excitement. His mom was home.<br />
<br />
Dropping his toy cars, Kenith darted out of his room and ran straight to her, wrapping his small arms around her waist as she smiled down at him. &quot;Hey, sweetheart,&quot; she said, her voice soft and loving as she bent down to kiss the top of his head. &quot;How was your day?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was great!&quot; Kenith beamed, snuggling into her embrace, his little face pressed against her side. He loved moments like this, feeling the warmth of his mom’s presence, knowing that everything in his life was as it should be.<br />
<br />
While Kenith snuggled with his mom, Sam was in his room, busy with his homework, but he still kept an ear out for his little brother, his protective instincts never far from the surface. Being twelve again gave him the best of both worlds—he could enjoy the independence of being older while still being there for Kenith, the brother he loved more than anything.<br />
<br />
And for Kenith, being six again was perfect. He had his toys, his mom, his brother, and a life that felt full of joy and adventure.<br />
<br />
The household was finally at peace, and the two brothers had found the perfect balance between their new roles. Kenith was happy, playful, and carefree as the little brother, while Sam, the now older and wiser sibling, took his role as protector seriously, ensuring that nothing would ever hurt his precious little brother.<br />
<br />
And as the night settled in, with Kenith curled up beside his mom on the couch and Sam content in his room, the world felt right.<br />
<br />
Everyone was happy.<br />
<br />
And that was all that mattered.</p>
