<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Gloria stretched, a contented smile on her face as she made her way towards the bedroom. Living off campus certainly had its advantages, especially if it meant staying with your boyfriend.<br />
<br />
Sophmore year for the young woman had started much smoother than Freshman year. Instead of worrying about revealing magic to an unsuspecting roommate, Gloria was now living with Caleb. Although her father may not be thrilled with the arrangement, he was willing to go along with the idea. As Lisa had explained trying to hide magic from those who didn&#39;t know was a herculean effort. Still, Gloria&#39;s parents,  as well as Calebs, had given the young couple a serious if not mortifying talk about what was expected from the pair. As Gloria now peaked into the bedroom, her heart began to race as she gazed at her sleeping boyfriend.<br />
<br />
Dressed only in a pair of boxers, Calebs muscular body was on full display for the young college woman to see. Caleb certainly knew how to maintain his physique, his muscles looking as if they were sculpted from marble. As she now placed a gentle kiss on his forehead, she could feel him begin to stir from his slumber. &quot;Morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning,&quot; Caleb replied groggily. &quot;Time is it?&quot; Gloria glanced at the clock, noting it was still early for the couple. &quot;Almost nine,&quot; she replied. Caleb frowned, rubbing the sleep from his eyes as he smoothed his dirty blonde hair. &quot;Why you get me up so early,&quot; he grumbled. &quot;You know I don&#39;t have any classes til eleven.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; she smirked. &quot;But I just got a call from my sister in law. Kellie was hoping you could check something out for her.&quot; Caleb sighed, slowly easing himself out of bed as he gazed at Gloria. Clothed only in a t-shirt, the young blondes body offered Caleb a magnificent view. The freshman 15 had been immensely kind to Gloria, her breasts now a healthy and perky C cup, with a slight curve to her hips and firm, flawless legs. If the young hunter was going to be woken up early, he certainly didn&#39;t mind this view. &quot;So what happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Morgan said she saw two foxes in the backyard and she started talking with them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Caleb raised an eyebrow, a pair of foxes in the suburbs didn&#39;t exactly raise any alarm bells. &quot;Okay. And?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;These foxes talked back to Morgan,&quot; Gloria stated. &quot;And asked if she knew any wizards.&quot; Caleb sighed, grabbing his hat before looking for clothes. Talking foxes asking about magic certainly raised some alarms. &quot;Okay yeah that sounds serious,&quot; he stated as he hastily began to dress. &quot;Did she give a description?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;One was white. The other was black and red. You know how Kellie gets when it comes to Morgan, she&#39;s always cautious.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you blame her though,&quot; Caleb replied as he began to gather his equipment. &quot;After the vampires tried kidnapping Morgan I don&#39;t blame her for being cautious.&quot; Gloria nodded, approaching her boyfriend as she gave him a tender kiss. &quot;Just be careful okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Twenty minutes later, Caleb now found himself in the woods behind Kellies home. Thankfully, Gloria was getting rather good with her teleportation spell, the first couple times Caleb had found himself feeling nauseous. Quickly finding a pair of tracks, the young hunter now began to follow them.<br />
<br />
These tracks were certainly different, two sets of fox prints yet they appeared to be standing upright. Immediately Caleb began to think of the kitsune but why would two kitsune be here? The only interaction Caleb had with kitsune was Akira and the Harris&#39;s children. They had no reason to sneak over to Kellies and talk with Morgan. The sound of voices now caused Caleb to crouch down, his eyes scanning the area carefully, surprised by what he saw.<br />
<br />
It was two kitsune but Caleb was surprised by what he saw. The two kits were young, still children judging by their voices and size.  Currently it seemed they were arguing with one another, from what Caleb could discern they appeared lost. Cautiously he now crept forward, his hands raised. The last thing he wanted was to be viewed as a threat.<br />
<br />
As he called out to the pair, Caleb could see them jump in alarm. &quot;Easy,&quot; he said softly. &quot;I&#39;m not here to hurt you. I just want to ask some questions.&quot; Studying the pair, Caleb could see the white kit seem to relax, her eyes still wide with fright but willing to listen. Unfortunately the black one seemed to embrace the fight of his fight or flight response.<br />
<br />
Caleb gasped, deflecting the attack of the black and red kit before grabbing his arm and putting him to the ground. Placing the kit in a wrist lock, he looked to control the kit without hurting him. &quot;Raiden,&quot; the white kit exclaimed before leaping at Caleb. The hunters eyes went wide in shock, quickky releasing Raiden before dodging the white kits clumsy attack. Grabbing a bolo from his belt, Caleb now flicked it at his attacker, entangling the white kit and causing her to fall over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sachiko,&quot; Raiden cried, quickly leaping to his friends aid as he tried to free her. Caleb now tried to calm them, he wasn&#39;t looking to frighten these two but he certainly couldn&#39;t let them attack him. As Raiden now tried to free Sachiko, Caleb could hear him call for help.<br />
<br />
&quot;Darren we need you!&quot;<br />
<br />
Caleb raised an eyebrow, who was Darren? In a flash of light, Caleb got his answer. A teenage boy around Connors age now appeared in front of him, the teen looking first to the kits before glaring at Caleb before unsheathing a katana. Already Caleb could tell the kid wanted to fight, the young hunter quickly trying to draw his weapon only for this teen to cut his firearm in two. As the young hunter now tried to fall into a defensive position, he felt himself soaring backwards. This teen was a wizard and had struck Caleb with a spell that knocked the wind out of him. Slamming into a tree, Calebs body was immediately wracked with pain from the blow. Barely conscious and in pain, Caleb tried to focus on the trio as he weakly called out to Spark.</p>
