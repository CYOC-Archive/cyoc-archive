<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff quickly put his pants down after taking his shoes off. Since he was recently starting puberty, his pale body was almost underdeveloped with a few thin hairs on his crotch and under his armpits.<br />
<br />
He wasn&#39;t very proud of them. In fact, he felt awkward each time his classmates saw them because they were even more underdeveloped than him. Plus, they recently had learned about puberty and it was still weird to think about the changes on their bodies. However, Jeff&#39;s girlfriend was a year older than him and way more developed. Girls usually start puberty before boys, after all...<br />
<br />
Jeff was constantly trying to impress her by doing big boys stuff like driving a motorbike, cooking his own food or watching R rated movies with her. Most of the time, he regrets doing it but his girlfriend enjoyed watching him trying hard, so he kept doing it.<br />
<br />
This time, he remembered his girlfriend&#39;s word when they to the beach and she saw those big beefy guys walking around with tiny speedo. &quot;You should try one of those. I bet you&#39;ll look sexy.&quot; He blushed back then and he blushed again now. He didn&#39;t think he would look sexy, he wasn&#39;t as strong or endowed like those guys but he didn&#39;t want to miss the opportunity to take a picture and show his girlfriend that he can do it.<br />
<br />
He took the thong. At first, he thought it was tiny for a man but that&#39;s because he didn&#39;t know a banana hammock was meant to be small to show off more. He sniffed it and realized it wasn&#39;t very clean. It smelled fishy, literally and he almost puked about the idea of wearing a thong that has held his brother&#39;s sweaty balls, or even worst, his roommate that Jeff barely knows.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here goes nothing!&quot; He said before he gulped and quickly began to move the thong through his thin legs. As the straps touched his skin he realized that it was smaller than he thought. Well, at least the straps around his waist and butt because the pouch in his crotch was ridiculously long but too narrow to cover anything else beside his prepubescent dick and balls.<br />
<br />
&quot;I better take that picture quickly, this thing is pretty uncomfortable.&quot; He said as he took his phone out of his pants&#39; pocket. &quot;Shit! This thing is itchy!! What THE-??!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Nathan was coming from McDonalds with his little brother&#39;s meal. He also bought an ice cream for him that was eating as he opened the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff! I&#39;m back!!&quot; He shouted expecting to find his brother waiting for him at the kitchen table, but he got no answer. He was going to shout again when he heard a loud thud coming from Jeremy&#39;s room. &quot;What was that?&quot; He wondered as he dropped the burger and his cone and ran to find it out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit!! It doesn&#39;t fit!!&quot;<br />
<br />
When Nathan arrived he got startled of finding an almost naked guy struggling with some pants on the floor. His big fat feet were in the air as he tried to pull the pants waist past his thick hairy thighs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you and what are you doing in my place?!!&quot; Nathan yelled while he took a desk lamp to use as a weapon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nat?&quot; The man said as turned to see him. &quot;Oh, Nat!! I&#39;m so glad you&#39;re back!!&quot; He immediately discarded the small pants and stood up to huge Nathan who was too surprised that he dropped the lamp. But a second later, he reacted and pushed the stranger guy away.<br />
<br />
&quot;I will ask you again. Who are you and what are you doing in my place?!!&quot; Nathan quickly grabbed the desk lamp again and took a defensive stance. &quot;Where is Jeff? What did you do to my brother?!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s me!! I&#39;m Jeff!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha, I&#39;m not stupid, dude. My brother is 12 years old, not a 20 something weirdo wearing a skimpy thong...&quot; Nathan realized something. &quot;Hold on, that&#39;s Jeremy&#39;s banana hammock. Why are you wearing it?!! Are you some kind of perv?!! Holy shit!! JEFF!! JEFF!! Where are you!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you I&#39;m Jeff!! I was snooping around your apartment when I found this thing. I thought it would be funny to send my girlfriend a photo of mine wearing it but when I put it on I started to grow up!! Now I&#39;m stuck in this hairy and sweaty body. Shit! Seriously, how can you deal with these things under your arms!!&quot; He raised his arms to show up his newly grown armpit bushes while he grimaced disgusted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff? Is that really you?&quot; Nathan started to believe that this hairy dude was his little brother. The way of speaking, the stupid story and the remarkable resemblance to himself was convincing him. &quot;I can&#39;t believe it! You&#39;re as old as me! How did this happen?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d told you. I put this thong on and then I turned into this!!&quot; Jeff was moving awkwardly as he wasn&#39;t used to his new frame. &quot;Shit! Look how much hair I got!! Is this how do you look under your shirt?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;More or less. Except that my pubic hair is not that dense. You&#39;re definitely hairier than me&quot; Nathan can&#39;t take his eyes off Jeff&#39;s crotch. &quot;Maybe even hairier than dad!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shit! Gross!! No one wants to hear they&#39;re hairier than their dad! That&#39;s bullshit!!&quot; Jeff started to insult uncontrollably. &quot;Nat! Do something! I don&#39;t wanna stay like this!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know what to do! That&#39;s not even mine!&quot; In that moment, Nathan got an idea. &quot;Jeremy! His girlfriend gave it to him! We must ask her!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, call her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t have her phone number.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, then call your roommate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, I&#39;m on it.&quot; Nathan was looking for Jeremy&#39;s number in his phone. &quot;Meanwhile... Would you mind giving the thong to me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;WTF?!! Why?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If it is really magical I want to try it on myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But it&#39;s the only cloth I have!&quot; Jeff protested. &quot;You&#39;ll see my junk!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, we&#39;re both men. We&#39;re brothers and I&#39;d seen you naked before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When I was 3 years old!!!&quot; Jeff yelled. &quot;I have grown since then!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can see it! You didn&#39;t have hair in your ass when I changed your diapers! Hahaha!!&quot; Nathan was laughing while Jeff blushed ashamed. &quot;Come on, I want to see what the thong will do to me!&quot;</p>
