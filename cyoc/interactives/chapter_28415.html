<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>Jennifer, the former Jonathan, stomped upstairs in a funk. Get ready for <i>bed!?</i> What was her mom...er...dad <i>thinking!?</i> They had to find a way to fix this! She wasn't going to act like a <i>girl</i> just because something had turned her into one! But...parents were parents, and she stood even less chance of winning in an argument with them than she had before. Accompanied by her new twin sister Michelle, she stomped into the bathroom. They both grabbed their toothbrushes and started brushing. It didn't work as well as usual; their teeth were all canines now and therefore not so flat-faced and easy to brush as the incisors and molars they had had, and the toothpaste got all over the fur around their lips. Still, it was this or get cavities, and both of them dreaded going to the dentist.</p>
<p>Suddenly there was a thump outside the bathroom window. Climbing on top of the toilet seat and peering out, Michelle spotted none other than younger-sister-turned older brother Kevin, trying to get the hang of balancing on a tree branch. "<i>Daaaaad!</i>" she called. "Karen...er, Kevin's out climbing in the oak tree!"</p>
<p>"All right," their new dad's voice called back. "I'll get him." The girls could hear Danielle voicing protest, but after Mark reasoned with their former dad for a minute, the objections stopped, and they could hear the front door open. Picking up a hairbrush, Michelle began to brush her hair out, offering a second brush to Jennifer. She spat in disgust. "No <i>way!</i>" she said. "I'm not doing that girly crap!"</p>
<p>Michelle giggled evilly. "You have to, now," she snickered. "It'll get all tangled if you don't, and then it'll really hurt. If you have long hair, you have to brush it."</p>
<p>"I'll cut it off, then!" Jennifer snapped. She reached for the scissors, but Michelle snatched them away and held them behind her back. "Noooo you don't!" she cackled. "You've gotta ask Mom or Dad before you do something like that, duh. Now turn around and let me show you how to brush your hair or I'll tell them you tried to cut it off."</p>
<p>Jennifer could barely contain her loathing for the brush, but she still remembered the trouble she'd gotten in when she tried to barber herself once before. Cringing, she turned around.</p>
<p>There was the brush in her hair...darn it, this was for <i>girls!</i> Why did she have to do this girly stuff just because she'd gotten turned into one!? It wasn't her fault! She shouldn't have to suffer just because...<i>oh! It feels so good!</i> Michelle was an expert at hair-brushing, having had some twelve years' experience before turning from a sixteen-year-old to an eight-year-old, and she was doing her best to make things pleasantly gentle, the better to freak out Jennifer. She was going to enjoy this, she thought - even if she had just lost eight years, there was someone living with her who'd have an even harder time adjusting.</p>
<p>Lost in a reverie at the touch of the brush, Jennifer suddenly realized what was happening. This couldn't be right! Hair brushing was for <i>girls!</i> She couldn't be...<i>enjoying</i> it! She tried her best to be distressed, but she couldn't shake the mellow happiness that the brush brought to her. It was more than just the brush, really - getting her hair brushed was also like getting petted would be for a normal cat: something gentle but scratchy raking across her head in a rhythmic pattern...she couldn't help it, she started purring softly. But just as she was about to get worked up over this, Michelle finished.</p>
<p>"There we go!" Michelle beamed. "<i>So</i> much better. That wasn't so bad, was it?" Part of Jennifer wanted to say no, it wasn't, wanted to say so very badly, but she managed to keep it in check, though she couldn't bring herself to say otherwise, either. Michelle grabbed her by the hand and dragged Jennifer into her room.</p>
<p>Michelle's room was changed, somewhat: instead of one bed, there were two, and the dresser was noticeably bigger than it had been. "Oh," she said. "I guess this is our room now, not just mine. That's okay, I don't mind having another <i>girl</i> share a room with me!"</p>
<p>"I'm not a-!" Jennifer began to protest, but Michelle shushed her. "Not a girl?" she snickered. "Of course you are! Look, you've even got girls' clothes in your side of the dresser!" She pulled the top-right drawer open, and Jennifer saw that it was true; in the drawer were girls' panties and knee-length socks (though the socks were of the heavy-duty variety, obviously due to their claws.) Folded neatly and placed on top of the socks and underwear was a nightgown, which Michelle grabbed and held out to Jennifer. "Here you go," she smiled. "Come on, we've got to get ready for bed!"</p>
<p>"I'm not wearing <i>that!</i>" Jennifer snarled. "I'm not a girl, darn it! I don't care if I got turned into one, I'm not going to wear girls' clothes!"</p>
<p>Michelle laughed. "You're wearing them now," she said. "Haven't you noticed?" She gestured towards Jennifer, who suddenly realized that she was in fact wearing a pink jumper with Hello Kitty on it and cringed again. "Pretty girly, if you ask me," Michelle continued. "It certainly can't be worse than this, and you know Mom and Dad aren't goin to let you sleep in your clothes."</p>
<p>Jennifer had a terrible sinking feeling. She was trying to fight this, really she was, but she was blocked, cornered, and outmaneuvered at every turn. She knew Michelle was right - they weren't allowed to sleep in their clothes, and these were the only pajamas available...and they really <i>weren't</i> worse than what she had on - in fact, probably better, a frill-less powder-blue nightgown versus a pink jumper...</p>
<p>Sighing and moaning, she took the nightgown from Michelle, then hesitated, unsure how to proceed. "Oh, <i>really!</i>" Michelle scoffed. "Take off your clothes, doofus! Gosh, how hard is <i>that</i> to figure out!?"</p>
<p>Jennifer nodded, started to remove her clothes, then hesitated again. Michelle rolled her eyes. "Oh, come <i>on,</i>" she said, "it's all right for you to take off your clothes around girls if you're a girl yourself, <i>duh!</i>"</p>
<p>Wanting to protest but unable to find the energy, Jennifer numbly removed her jumper, T-shirt, and socks. "C'mon," Michelle said. "You don't need to wear anything under a nightgown, stupid." Nodding absentmindedly, Jennifer removed her panties as well. Trying not to think about the fact that she was naked, a naked girl no less, she quickly slipped the nightgown over her head.</p>
<p>"There we are!" Michelle said, having just finished her own dressing routine. "That wasn't so bad, was it? Come on, bedtime. I don't think Mom and Dad are going to be up to tuck us in tonight."</p>
<p>Before Jennifer could say anything, Michelle had deftly flopped her into bed and thrown the covers over her, then climbed into bed herself and shut out the light. Jennifer lay there for some time, huddled under the blankets in her nightgown, listening to her new dad and new brother. They were discussing something out on the front lawn. It didn't sound like they were fighting, but some pretty intense emotions were on display. She wondered what they were talking about.</p>
<p>Even though nobody was fighting, she was scared. This was all too comfortable! She shouldn't be dressing like a girl, and she certainly shouldn't find it this comfortable! But she did...the nightgown, a sea of soft fabric, caressed her, and even as she waged an inner battle with the part of her moving her toward acceptance, she fell asleep.</p></p>
