<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was then that Susan finally let go and embraced her new sex completely. The pretty, demure, feminine woman had been replaced by a handsome, confident, and masculine man, and Matt had every intention of exploring every aspect of his newfound manhood.<br />
<br />
Matt leaned forward and kissed Janine again - more deeply this time - establishing a gentle dominance that was becoming of his new status as a man. His erection was straining against its confines, creating a noticeable bulge in his pants. Janine took note and broke off the kiss, biting her lower lip submissively.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s get inside.&quot; She said, leading Matt into her apartment and into the bedroom. Once safely inside, the two lovers began making out passionately. Janine reached back, unzipping her dress and allowing it to fall through the floor. She then stepped back, allowing Matt to take in the view. He smiled as he saw that she indeed did have on her good underwear, a sexy red lace bra with matching panties. He remembered going lingerie shopping with her as Susan and giving each other opinions on how they looked in various undergarments. &quot;You&#39;re going to drive men crazy with those!&quot; Susan said to Janine at the time, and looking on her now as a man Matt could see that he had clearly been right in his previous identity. Seeing a woman like this really was an incredible experience.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re beautiful.&quot; Matt said, and it was no exaggeration. Her bountiful breasts filled the cups of her bra perfectly, and those skimpy red panties complemented her feminine curves perfectly. He couldn&#39;t wait to get them off and see the main prize.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now let&#39;s see what you have.&quot; Janine said seductively, unfastening his belt. Matt took his shirt off while Janine slid his pants and shorts to the ground, finally exposing his manhood. It stood proudly at attention, making Janine sigh in lust. Matt was silently grateful for having been blessed with a very nice package!<br />
<br />
Matt pulled Janine close, his erection pushing against her womanhood through her panties. He reached around and expertly unclipped her bra, allowing it to fall to the floor and exposing her luscious breasts to him. Finally, he slid her panties off, leaving both of them to take in each other&#39;s naked forms. As close as they had been, Susan had never seen Janine naked before, and the sight was almost too much for Matt to handle. His eyes traveled down her neck, to her perfect tits with their pink, erect nipples, down her trim stomach to her childbearing hips, and finally to her neatly trimmed pussy that was clearly wet with excitement. Every instinct was telling Matt to toss Janine on the bed and fuck her brains out, but the tiny part of Susan that was still with him told him otherwise. He cared about her, and he wanted to do this right. And having been a woman himself, he knew exactly how to do it.<br />
<br />
Matt gently guided Susan onto the bed and climbed on top of her. Locking eyes with his lover, he began kissing her neck and then slowly worked his way down, giving each breast attention before kissing her stomach. Janine was swooning, giving him implicit permission to continue on.  His face was now inches from her pussy, and he could practically feel the heat emanating from it. Going down on her, he kept thinking about what he liked when he was Susan and turned that knowledge into expert precision. Matt couldn&#39;t believe how much he was enjoying the taste of her womanhood. Just the fact that he could bring such feelings to a woman was amazing! For her part, Janine was screaming in bliss, bucking her hips as he continued to pleasure her in ways she had never experienced before. Soon she was shuddering in orgasm, her tight pussy convulsing around Matt&#39;s tongue as he brought her to  her peak. As she basked in the afterglow of her orgasm, Matt lifted his head up from between her legs and propped himself over her again.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was fucking incredible!&quot; Janine said, panting. &quot;Where in the world did you learn to do that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s just say I have experience.&quot; Matt said, grinning.<br />
<br />
Locking her beautiful blue eyes onto Matt, Janine then said the one thing he had been waiting all night to hear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Baby, I want you to finish the job. I want your cock in me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you want it,&quot; Matt said teasingly. &quot;You&#39;ll have to ask nicely for it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Matt! Please, I want you to fuck me!&quot; Janine said breathlessly.<br />
<br />
This was all the permission Matt needed. Slowly he lowered his cock towards her aching pussy, allowing to tip to hover above her entrance for a split second before sliding into her. The feeling of finally entering her was an indescribable pleasure. Matt began to pump his manhood into her, slowly at first and then increasing speed in response to her cries of pleasure.<br />
<br />
Matt was simultaneously experiencing the pleasures of sex as a man for the first time while also marveling at how incredulous this situation was. This was Janine! Susan&#39;s best friend! He thought back to all the times that they would paint each other&#39;s nails, experiment with makeup, and do a million other girly things together. And now here he was as a man, fucking her! And they were both loving it!<br />
<br />
Lost in pleasure, Matt and Janine were now screaming each other&#39;s name as they rapidly approached climax. Matt could feel it building up inside him, and he knew what was about to happen next. He began pumping faster and faster as his orgasm continued to build, and build, and build, until finally he let go, shooting his seed into Janine&#39;s waiting pussy. At the same time, Janine experienced her second earth-shattering orgasm, the walls of her vagina milking Matt&#39;s cock for all it was worth.<br />
<br />
Exhausted, the two lovers collapsed onto the bed, embracing each other and sharing one final kiss before falling asleep in each other&#39;s arms.</p>
