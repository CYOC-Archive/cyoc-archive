<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In addition to various other ways Animalia was celebrating its anniversary, there was a special contest going on at the Meat Market, not the adult cosplay contest though. In a way, it was similar to the Bare-As-You-Dare contest two years back and had drawn in quite a few participants from that competition. But while the Bare-As-You-Dare focused how less a person could wear without exposing any naughty bits, this was actually a stripping competition. Competitors had to perform an erotic dance on stage while gradually but alluringly removing their articles of clothing. Displays of flexibility and grace would improve scores, but weren&#39;t strictly needed. This was a contest for amateurs so no professionals were allowed to compete. The most that the regular strippers would be doing would be to show some of the easier moves to do on stage.<br />
<br />
Quite a few Animalians decided to try this challenge. Those who didn&#39;t work at the Meat Market would assume their strong, fit bodies would make erotic dancing easily. But they soon found keeping to the rhythm as they moved and trying to appear sexy than silly was harder than it seemed. It certainly was being a memorable show. But the most memorable part was something nobody had expected.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, did you really have to come here?&quot; asked Nicole in annoyance.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just wanted to spend the day together,&quot; said Joanne.<br />
<br />
&quot;This isn&#39;t exactly the place where you take your mother to work,&quot; said Nicole pointedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;That is true,&quot; said Joanne, &quot;I never understood why you couldn&#39;t do a dance style that&#39;s more...elegant.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean like over-feminized dances like waltzes or ballets?&quot; asked Nicole, rolling her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;They are perfectly respectable forms of art,&quot; said Joanne, &quot;Much more involved than just spinning around on a pole.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pole dancing is much more than it looks,&quot; said Nicole, &quot;But I wouldn&#39;t expect you to understand. Strip-dancing is a young woman&#39;s game.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joanne&#39;s brows furrowed, &quot;What do you mean &#39;young woman&#39;s game&#39;? You know that we&#39;re physically the same age now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In body, maybe, but not in spirit. An old woman like you wouldn&#39;t know what to do on this stage,&quot; said Nicole smugly.<br />
<br />
Joanne narrowed her eyes before heading towards the DJ. She made a request for a particular song before going to the sign-up table. Presently, after waiting for the latest person to get off the stage (who incidentally trying to swing around the pole only for him to slam his groin into it), Joanne walked up onto the stage. She leaned against the pole and waited for her song to start.<br />
<br />
As soon as the DJ started playing &#39;Sexy Naughty Bitchy Me&#39;, Joanne started her dancing. It started off with some simple spinning around the pole. But then it started to get more involved as she was lifting her legs up much higher than the audience would have expected them to go as well as spinning around with considerable speed. But she wasn&#39;t just up there to dance. As Joanne swung around the pole, she was unbuttoning her blouse with her other hand, revealing more of her bra. Once her blouse was draping from her shoulders, Joanne pulled her arms out before tossing it to the side. Next, as she was grinding her ass against the pole, she unbuttoned her pants before letting them drop and kicking them away.<br />
<br />
Nicole had to admit, she&#39;d never expected to see her mother dancing on a stage in her underwear. Then again, very few people would ever expect to see their own mothers that way. Nicole had to admit that her mother had some agility and flexibility, though it would take more than that to win this- Wait, what was she doing? For a second, it looked like Joanne was unclasping her bra. But Nicole knew her mother would never go that far. Ok, so the straps were now loose, but she was still holding the cups to her chest. Clearly this was as far as she&#39;ll be willing to go. Not in a hundred years would Joanne ever-<br />
<br />
Nicole&#39;s jaw dropped about the same time that Joanne&#39;s bra did. That wasn&#39;t just a simple fumble, that was a deliberate discard. As an Animalian, Nicole had developed a blase opinion on modesty. And working in the Meat Market had made her quite at ease with herself and others revealing their bodies in erotic ways. But nothing, <i>nothing</i>, could ever prepare for the the sight of seeing her own mother pole-dancing in nothing both her panties. Oh, Joanne sometimes hid her nipples behind one of her arms or the pole, but quite often her bare breasts were bouncing in full view for anyone to see.<br />
<br />
It was embarrassing enough for Nicole to see such a spectacle, it was even worse when Joanne had scored way more than anyone else and won the contest. Nicole retired to a table, hoping to bleach her brain with some strong drinks. She was only starting to get buzzed when Joanne walked over. She had mostly redressed herself, but she left her blouse more than halfway open. &quot;Hmm, quite a bit of prize money,&quot; said Joanne as she fingered through the 20s she had been given, &quot;Though it&#39;s little more than lunch money for me. Maybe there&#39;s a little charity I can donate this to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just...how...did you learn to move like that?&quot; asked Nicole.<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you ballet is an involved form of dance,&quot; said Joanne, &quot;Oh, I was never lead dancer, but I did build up some strong muscles and stamina. And that was when I was only human. I have to admit, that was pretty fun. Maybe I should come dance here more often.&quot; With that, Nicole really started hitting her drink. She wasn&#39;t quite sure how much it would take a fennec fox to get sloshed. One would think a desert species that had to preserve their water couldn&#39;t get drunk so easily. But Nicole was now very determined to find out.</p>
