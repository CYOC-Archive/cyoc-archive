<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Todd and Blake stopped at the entrance to the kitchen.  Marc stood at the stove, bare naked as he prepared breakfast for the boys, the smell of cooked sausage wafted throughout the room.  &quot;Uncle Marc?  Where's Jay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Living room, I believe, watching some TV before breakfast.  Hope you boys are hungry.&quot;  Marc turned around, his large cock swaying between his toned thighs as he dished out the eggs and sausages in the pan onto a pair of plates.  &quot;Sit down, eat up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Blake was shifting uncomfortably from foot to foot, his eyes running over Marc.  &quot;I.. I'm gonna pass.  Where's the shower?&quot;  Todd rolled his eyes.  Just his luck, Blake was getting more turned on by their dilemma than anything else.<br />
<br />
&quot;Across the hall from your room.&quot;  Marc set one plate down on the table, along with a fork.  He motioned for Todd to take a seat as Blake left the kitchen, trying to hide an obvious bulge in his pants.  &quot;Eat up.  I'm sure you have questions but it's better to talk over food.  Right, nephew?&quot;  Marc grabbed the other plate and a fork and sat down at the table across from his nephew.<br />
<br />
Todd sat down and picked up his fork.  He sniffed the air, causing his stomach to rumble at the delicious smells wafting towards him.  He scooped up a bunch of egg and some sausage, cramming it in his mouth.  They were rich and earthy, fulls of herbs and spices.  It was some of the best food he'd ever eaten.  He started to ask his question, then paused to shovel a few more forkfuls of food into his face.  Marc just smiled as he watched him, barely picking at his own food.  Todd had finished off almost all his food before he finally managed to spit out his question.  &quot;What happened to Jay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He stumbled into one of my experiments.  I had intended to try the bananas on him, but he went for the pickles instead.&quot;  Marc shook his head.  &quot;Though they did seem to work on him well.  I think he would have been happier had it gone my way, but he's kind of adorable this way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?  Pickles?&quot;  Todd's eyes went wide, looking at the fridge, then down to his own now empty plate of food.<br />
<br />
Marc just laughed at his nephew's reaction.  &quot;Yes, all the food is laced with my special plants.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot;  Todd shot up out of his seat, his skin felt hot, tingly.  He felt like electricity was coursing through his entire body.  His clothes felt tight on his body, they felt wrong.  &quot;What did you give me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just a little something to bring out something you didn't know you had in you.&quot;  Marc leaned back in his chair, crossing his arms over his lean, bare chest.  &quot;And it doesn't matter why, in a bit you won't care.  You'll love what you become.  I do, Jason does, Blake certainly will.&quot;<br />
<br />
Todd quickly ran back towards the stairs.  He needed to grab his stuff and his friends, and they needed to leave.  He ran into the room, and started grabbing everyone's bags.  As he bent over he was met with the sound of ripping fabric.  He quickly stood back up, looking at the rip that had opened up in his jeans.  Three inches of his stomach was visible between his shirt and the waist of his pants.  Todd had always been fit, but now his stomach was swollen with muscle.  Dark brown hair was creeping up from under the waistband of his pants, up his stomach.  The crotch of his pants were stretched taught over a much larger bulge than he normally sported.  He grabbed his shirt and yanked it off over his head.  He looked down at his chest and his eyes widened.  His pecs had grown a few inches, his nipples were larger, hard and perky.  Light brown hair had grown in a dusting across his pectorals, meeting the strip that had grown up his stomach.  As he watched it thickened slightly, turning into something more akin to fur.  His stomach lost some definition as it plumped out, the Freshman fifteen in one go.  He lifted his arm and rubbed his fingers through the hair on his chest.  Even his arms were thicker, the brown hair along his forearms.<br />
<br />
Finally he couldn't stand the way his pants were digging into his waist anymore.  He undid his fly and dropped his pants.  It took a little effort to get the pants down past his thickened, hairier legs.  His cock flopped free, eight inches of penis dangling between his legs alongside a pair of balls the size of chicken eggs.  He lifted his hand up to his jaw, running his fingers along his stubble.  Just then the sound of the shower hit his ears.  Blake.<br />
<br />
The thought of his friend across the room showering brought his cock quickly to attention.  &quot;No.. No..  I'm not..&quot;  Todd still found himself walking across the hall way, buck naked.  He stepped into the bathroom, looking at himself in the mirror.  He looked only slightly older, but that could be chalked up to the muscle and the hair.  There were none of those little signs that indicated age.  He simply looked like a hairy, muscular eighteen year old.  Jay had become a twink from the food.  And from the look of things he became a bear.  He looked over to the shower curtain, Blake's form visible behind the white sheet.  Blake's hand was wrapped around his cock, slowly stroking one out.<br />
<br />
Todd suppressed a chuckle.  Blake wasn't confused at all, he knew exactly what he wanted.  Todd gently pushed the curtain aside, looking at Blake's face, eyes closed, mouth parted in pleasure.  Todd stepped into the shower as quietly as he could, then slowly set his hands on Blake's hips.<br />
<br />
Blake jumped at the contact, spinning around an coming face to face with Todd.  &quot;Todd?!  What are you?  What happened to..&quot;  Blake's eyes ran up and down Todd's body, his interest becoming more and more obvious.  Todd pulled Blake in close, his hairy body up against the other teen's smoother one.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought this is what you wanted.  No having to worry about us accepting you for who you are.&quot;  His cock rubbed up against Blake's as he tilted his head and locked lips with his friend.<br />
<br />
Blake pulled back, pressing his hand against the wet fur on Todd's chest.  &quot;This isn't you.  This is like Jay.  Your uncle is doing something to us..&quot;  Blake's tirade cut short with a gasp as Todd's hand wrapped around his rigid shaft.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what?  You don't want this?  You don't want my rock-hard cock up your ass?  All you have to do is accept it.  I like this.  Look at me.  Hairy and muscular and masculine.  Exactly what you want, isn't it?  Or do you prefer men like Jay?  Lispy and effeminent.&quot;  Todd's hand slide down Blake's backside, along his ass until fingers pressed against his virgin hole.<br />
<br />
&quot;Todd... I..&quot;</p>
