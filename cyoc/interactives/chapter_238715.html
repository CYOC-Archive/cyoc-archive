<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was getting late. Miles however was keen to keep the night going. “How about we play a few rounds of Dare or Drink before bed?!”<br />
The others were keen so Myles began.<br />
“First, Roy, I dare you to not milk yourself, or have anyone else milk you, until tomorrow morning! Haha.”<br />
Roy smiled with some concern. “Well I’ll take that dare, but if I burst from a blueberry juice overload, it’s all your fault Myles.”<br />
<br />
“Ha yeah yeah I take full responsibility.” Myles smirked through the screen. “Next, Gavin, I dare you to make a chocolate blueberry milkshake for the room to drink without using any ingredients from the kitchen.”<br />
Gavin laughed out of confusion. &quot;Haha what? Where am I getting that sort of…&quot;<br />
&quot;Well for one, there&#39;s a bucket of blueberry juice from Roy here.&quot; Axel pointed out, seeing where Miles was going with this dare.<br />
&quot;And we could get the milk from Murray&#39;s breast milk, seems like they&#39;re getting quite plump right now.&quot; Neal joked.<br />
&quot;Eww, come on guys you don&#39;t want to drink my milk!&quot; Murray covered his leaking breasts with his arms in protest. <br />
&quot;Oh come on Murray it&#39;ll be fine, Gavin’s mum was considerate enough to bring you down her breast pump, you wouldn&#39;t want to be ungrateful.&quot; Axel teased.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that leaves chocolate, which unless Oscar shits chocolate bars, we&#39;re totally out of luck.&quot; Phil pointed out.<br />
Oscar rolled his eyes, &quot;and you all know I don&#39;t, I don&#39;t shit anymore.&quot;<br />
&quot;Nonsense,&quot; Randall said, crawling over to Oscar before grabbing Oscar&#39;s erect chocolate dick and snapping it off. &quot;This should be enough.&quot; Holding the chocolate cock and balls in his hand.<br />
Oscar stared in shock. &quot;Did… did you just… castrate me?!?!&quot;<br />
&quot;It’s no biggie, we have a spare for you.&quot; Neal said, licked the base of Axel&#39;s unattached cock, and crawled over, sinking the warm moist base into Oscar&#39;s ruined groin area. Axel&#39;s dick sank in nicely and Neal smoothed the chocolate around it. &quot;There, good as new.&quot;<br />
“What? Gavin needed the chocolate, or he’d have to skull a drink. Seems only fair.” Randall said, acting with fake innocence.<br />
“I can cum chocolate, you idiot! I practically had an unlimited supply!” <br />
“Oh whoops, then why didn’t you tell us?”<br />
“I was going to Randell, but you ripped off my dick before I could!”<br />
“Umm well it’s too late now.” Gavin interrupted, trying to calm things down. “I’m sorry that they did that to you Oscar, but there’s no point wasting it now.”<br />
<br />
Oscar shrugged in defeat. “Fine, do whatever. Maybe it’ll grow back at some point if I eat enough chocolate.” He looked down at his ‘new’ dick. The human skin contrasted with the chocolate skin around it, but still was attached perfectly after he smoothed the pubic area a bit more. Then the dick started getting hard. <br />
“Sorry, my bad.” Axel called out, embarrassed. “All your eyes looking at my dick got me hard.”<br />
“I just like to remind you that mine was totally bigger than this before you all eat it.” Oscar proclaimed as he thrust his hips around to show off Axel’s boner even more.<br />
Randell held Oscar’s cock next to Axel’s to compare. The chocolate one being thin, long and cut, while the other was curving upward, its foreskin stretching open around the tip.<br />
“Yip by about 2 inches. Sorry for the downgrade there buddy.”<br />
“Hey!” Axel protested.<br />
<br />
Gavin took the chocolate cock. “Right so I’ll sneak upstairs to grab what we need and melt this in the microwave. Phil, can you set up the breast pump for Murray?”<br />
Gavin quietly headed up the stairs to the kitchen. He held his heavy ball sack scooped up in one arm and Axel&#39;s cock in the other&#39;s hand. It was past 11 so mum should be asleep by now, hopefully she won&#39;t hear anything. Reaching the kitchen, he dropped his balls back down to rest on his knees and put the cock in a glass bowl. Placing it in the microwave and setting it for 30 seconds, Gavin used that time to grab the other things he needed. Not a blender though, that&#39;ll be too loud, he&#39;ll make do with an egg beater. Watching the last few seconds of Oscar&#39;s solid penis melt into a bowl of liquid chocolate was kinda mind blowing. It was so weird to think about, and made him uncomfortably hard. It occurred to him that they probably could have tried molding the choc cock back on Oscar and maybe it would have been back to fully functional? *Oh well, too late I guess.* <br />
<br />
Downstairs, Oscar started feeling oddly warm around his crotch region, not his temporary new cock either, instead his ‘phantom cock’. It got really warm, uncomfortably so, but not painful. Then it started feeling really good, and then extremely good, like he was on the verge of cumming. It felt like he was having an edging session, slowly waking for minutes on end only to pause right before the climax. His chocolate body was suddenly filled with endorphins in anticipation for the perfect orgasm, but then suddenly nothing. Oscar sighed in desperate frustration, he assumed that feeling must be his poor cock melting away on a stove or in a microwave upstairs. Now he was stuck, on the edge, but can never release. All he can do now is prey to the chocolate gods that he somehow gets it back. Whether re-grown, or maybe a new one could be sculpted. If that could work, he could totally go for whatever size he wants. Maybe he&#39;d go for a 12 inch one, or since he&#39;s already a chocolate freak, a 24 inch one… flaccid! Just as long as he gets feeling back, this realistic dildo strap-on one Axel has “lent” him is nowhere near adequate. He desperately needed that orgasm!<br />
<br />
Grabbing the bowl and all the other equipment using both hands and his stretched out cock, Gavin was out of limbs to carry his balls, so he creeped back down very uncomfortably, trying not to wack his balls with his knees.<br />
By the time Gavin was back, Phil was almost done pumping the milk from Murray&#39;s breasts. The pregnant boy was moaning a little bit from the weird sensation on his sensitive nipples, and Gavin could spot his boner struggling to escape its metaphorical prison of being crushed under his belly. Gavin also noticed Roy was almost all blue now, with only faint patches of skin tone, and he was starting to look a little pump. *Guess he’s starting to swell now that he’s not allowed to juice himself.* Gavin thought.<br />
<br />
Myles continued to encourage the whole fiasco by giving random and usually unhelpful instructions through the video call. Gavin knew his boyfriend just wanted to sew chaos for the fun of it. He must be quite bored living by himself stuck on top of his colossal balls.<br />
<br />
Into the measuring jug Gavin poured the breast milk, then Roy’s blueberry juice from the juice bucket, and finally Oscar&#39;s melted cock chocolate. Whisking it all up for the next 5 minutes he got it to a mostly bubbly thick mixture. Nothing like a true smoothie, but definitely close enough. Satisfied, Gavin took a gulp and it was delicious. He then shared it around the group with some boys more willing to drink than others. Only Johnathan, Myles and Jeffery missed out for obvious reasons. Despite some of their initial skepticism, all of them enjoyed the taste once they tried. The whole jug was quickly consumed.<br />
<br />
“That was delicious.” Neal said, rubbing his toned abs. “You three should make a business selling that.” <br />
“Ha sure, but there wouldn’t be much of me left very quickly.” Oscar reminded him.<br />
“Hopefully it’ll grow back after you’ve drunk your melted cock,” Myles mockingly reassured him, “Though only one eighth the size since the others drank the rest.” He then laughed at the idea.</p>
