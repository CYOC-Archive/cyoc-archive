<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Right, well I can’t stand around here jibber-jabbering all day,” the attendant cheerfully said, collecting your reins, “time’s a wastin, let’s get the two of you back home,” she tied your halter to Harry’s saddle, and then sticking her foot into his stirrup, she mounted the stallion. Clucking her tongue at the horse, she then began leading you back toward the stables.<br />
<br />
Stunned you didn’t even think to resist as you followed after her despairingly. Hearing the thump of your own placid hoof-steps and feeling the halter wrapped securely around your face and head as you were led along, you couldn’t have felt less like a human if you’d tried!<br />
<br />
As you walked your mind began to wander; you couldn’t help but remember now the mare you saw in the stable previously, the one who’d been so afraid, who’d fought so hard with her captors, who had looked at you with such pity. She’d known then what your fate would be, known that you’d soon be joining her as a beast-of-burden, but she’d been powerless to do anything to help you, just as powerless as she’d been to prevent her own transformation. You understood now what she had been so afraid of, as you now shared her fears, seeing the entire future lying in wait before you as a dark yawning chasm that threatened to swallow you whole.<br />
<br />
As your hooves plodded along you began feeling more of the rapidly cooling fluids from your mating with Harry continue to drip down between your hindlegs, itchy, it matted the hairs of your tail together, leaving you feeling so soiled and filthy.<br />
<br />
You desperately wanted to clean yourself off, but the simple fact was that you now had hooves instead of hands, and forelegs instead of arms, there was no getting around your new anatomy. It made you wished that the attendant would just take notice and help clean you up, even if she were to tease and mock you about your changes and the lusty passion you experienced as a mare with her stallion.<br />
<br />
As the stable complex came back into view the attendant caught your attention as she waved her hand towards it. “The Stable is one of the premier horse training, trading and breeding establishments in the country,&quot; she said proudly. &quot;Our horses fill a vital demand, being used for everything from farmyard work, to the mounted police forces, horse racing competitions, to dressage shows, and of course breeding. Our studs and mares are in high demand for the exceptional horses they sire and rear, their foals benefiting from their parent’s health, strength, temperament, fertility and virility.”<br />
<br />
“Of course, the Stable only permanently houses a few prized horses like Harry here on site, most of our incoming stock are sold to farms or breeding centres as soon as they finish their training, only the very best animals get to remain here with us.”<br />
<br />
Stock? You thought for a moment, numb with shock, she was talking about people!<br />
<br />
“Whether you will join our select few or not will very much depend on your behaviour and how well you take to training over the next few days.”<br />
<br />
You all but came to a halt at that, your mind fixing on that one word that promised you a lifetimes worth of degradation and humiliation; training. Surely they weren’t going to train you like some sort of pet!?<br />
<br />
Having noticed you’d slowed up, the attendant turned to look at you in disapproval before her lips split into a smirk of unremitting cruelty at seeing your face, “oh yes, you are a horse now girl, a common farm animal, and you will be trained as such. At the end of which we will decide whether to sell you or keep to you.”<br />
<br />
Tugging on your lead sharply, the attendant quickly got you moving again. “Oh, and on the subject of training, we have found over the years that males, such as yourself; when transformed into mare’s need much more training to accept what they now are. As you can imagine male-to-female mares aren’t terribly thrilled at the prospect of getting mounted and filled with foals, we had quite a lot of incidences in the early days of fillies kicking their stallion’s during breeding sessions. So, in order to help reduce the risks of that happening, your training will not only help you to acclimate to your new body, it will also help you accept the pussy housed between your hindlegs.”<br />
<br />
Though you really should have got caught up on the revoltingly prophetic words, ‘mounted’ and ‘foals’, as soon as you heard her say ‘breeding sessions’ your mind was immediately cast back to just moments before, where you were snorting and panting beneath Harry. The huge black stallion roughly fucking you, rutting his massively long shaft in and out of your newly formed vagina!<br />
<br />
Shifting your hooves nervously, you shook your head from side to side, trying to purge the foul memories from your mind, at best you just pushed them to one side. Looking up you noticed you were now entering the Stable proper, the attendant dismounted from Harry and passed his lead off to a stablehand who then led the stallion back to his stall. Looking around you soon noticed a young woman with equine ears riding a different stallion out of the building, oblivious to the changes that were even now progressing.<br />
<br />
The attendant turned to see what had caught your attention then gave you a flirtatious wink, “new mare,” she whispered as the two of you watched the girl start her last ride as a bipedal creature.<br />
<br />
The horse’s stalls were exactly how you remembered them, but now details that you considered irrelevant before had taken on new meaning, like the plaques with the exclusively human-like names, the haunted, far-away looks in the eyes of all the new horse’s, that like you, had only just ‘arrived’ today, and the stablehands that followed your slow trot with a focused intensity, ready to subdue you immediately were you to offer even the slightest resistance.<br />
<br />
Tugging on your lead the attendant brought you to an open stall on the same row you’d only a little over an hour before walked down as a human. Reluctantly you walked inside and took stock of your new surroundings. It wasn&#39;t the largest enclosure by any means, but it was big enough for you to comfortably lay down in if you wished. In the corner was a bed made up of fresh straw, with a filled-water trough sat next to it.<br />
<br />
The sight and scent of the stall that was now yours, brought your true horrifying situation home to you like nothing had before.<br />
<br />
Only this morning you’d been human, you’d gotten out of bed, washed, shaved, brushed your teeth and gone through the hundred other things involved with getting ready for the day which you never gave much thought to. Such ordinary things, such human things; parts of your existence that you never questioned, that you believed were immutable, unchangeable, until now, when suddenly, they were not…<br />
<br />
Now you were a horse, an animal, as was your girlfriend Jessica! It was insane, but it was true. You’d been transformed into this body against your will, and you knew you were hardly the first to have had this happen to them.<br />
<br />
That of course begged the question; out of all of those horses you’d seen today, how many of them had once been people? Half of them? All of them?<br />
<br />
At first meeting/seeing them you’d have never guessed what they really were, or who they’d once been, after all they’d looked and acted just like real horses, and the idea that they’d ever been anything else would have been ludicrous until now.<br />
<br />
Just how long had these poor souls even been here? Months? Years? How long had it taken them to break? To give up on all hopes and dreams of rescue or escape? To give up on their very humanity, and start thinking and acting just like real horses? How long would it take for you to do the same?<br />
<br />
God! What had any of you done to even deserve any of this? You&#39;re human fucking beings... you had lives, families, all that had been taken from you. You’d been kidnapped, transformed, and now these people were now going to train you up to sell like fucking cattle... how could they do that!?<br />
<br />
With your mind all awhirl with these dehumanising thoughts and feelings you didn’t even feel it when the attendant slipped your halter off, only really realising something important was happening when you heard her close the door and latch it behind her, locking you inside the stall!<br />
<br />
Whirling around, you saw that you were now trapped. Coming over to the door, you tossed your head whinnying piercingly, looking through the bars at the attendant who was staring unrepentantly back at you.<br />
<br />
“And now that you’re settled girl; to ensure that you make no mistakes or errors in judgement, I’ll give you a quick rundown of the rules you are now expected to live by.” She cleared her throat, “first, as long as you remain a resident here at the Stable you will listen and obey every command you are given by either myself or another attendant without pause or hesitation. You’ll sleep, eat, drink and shit when and where we tell you to do so. You won’t damage your stall, you won’t act aggressively towards any of our workers, customers or any of the other horses, and if the time comes that I want you to transform someone, you will do it like the good little filly you are. Any hints of defiance, any contradictory behaviour of any kind and you will be punished.”<br />
<br />
Before you could even respond to this tirade of shocking demands, the attendant was holding up one finger which she pointed towards you with menace.<br />
<br />
“And before you even think of it, let me disabuse you of any silly notions you may be entertaining about the likelihood of escape; not only are these stalls designed with a more-than-animal-like intelligence in mind, but new mares always enter into heat the day after their transformation, it’s a failsafe designed in the unlikely event that a filly ever manages to escape the Zoo.”<br />
<br />
“To ensure your understanding I’ll expand on this point; your heat will soon put you into a state of mindless perpetual mating rut that will overwhelm any silly attempt you make to resist. Now there is a spell at work upon you, this magic currently holds you imprisoned in your current equine form. This spell has purposefully been crafted to adapt to different situations so that if you do manage to escape and happen to meet any male of a different species, whether that be horse, dog, cat, or rat you will find yourself transformed into a female of that species, and then your heat will drive you to mate with him, and after it is done you will be locked into that form for the rest of your days. Stallions have always been easier in this regard; we can induce heat in our mares to bait any escaping male, they quickly succumb to their animal instincts with a few raised tails.”<br />
<br />
She giggled at that, before coughing and continuing on, “if you do still somehow manage to get out though, please trust me when I say that we will capture you before you get very far, and when we do the punishments we will inflict will be… severe. Understand?”<br />
<br />
You didn’t make a sound, only stared at the attendant forlornly. But she seemed satisfied.<br />
<br />
“Tomorrow you and the other new mares will all enter into your first heat cycle, but your training won’t officially begin until a few days later. We give you this time so that you have the chance to properly bond with your new bodies, to experience the full spectrum of what it is to be and live like a horse, but none of you will be given any relief to your raging sexual urges during this period, you will only know such release when we say so.”<br />
<br />
She paused for a moment to let that sink in before she carried on, “some describe the heat of fillies as a torture without end,” she said conversationally. “That after only a few hours one all but begs to be mounted. However it may be, my colleagues and I find we cannot argue with the results, as the forced abstinence seems to be the perfect method for breaking-in even the wildest of beasts.”<br />
<br />
“Remember the rules girl and you’ll be fine,” the attendant said turning to go, “I’ll be by to check in on you tomorrow morning, until then rest well, and eat lots of hay, it’s good for you.”<br />
<br />
You then watched, feeling completely helpless as she walked back up the hallway to greet another unfortunate young couple that had just arrived, the attendant shot the couple a dazzling smile, suggesting they take a nice romantic walk out into the woods to look at a little lake she knew nearby!</p>
