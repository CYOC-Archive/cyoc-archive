<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jim looked at all of his options in the edible section of the Chronivac and it was hard to pick what type of food he wants to be.  But then, he remembered that he always had a sweet tooth.  Jim always love candy and has a tendency of having it for a snack or a midnight meal.  One of his all time favorite candies is a Hershey’s chocolate bar.  He always liked how it went from hard and crunchy after one bite to soft and chewy at the end.  And the taste always made his mouth water.  To him, a Hershey’s bar is by far his most favorite candy ever.<br />
<br />
Looking back at the Chronivac, Jim wondered what it would be like as a chocolate bar.  Sure it would be a pain not moving at all and have none of his senses with him, except for his sense of feeling everything around him, but it would be interesting spending life as the one thing he liked.  Plus he could understand what being chocolate is all about.<br />
<br />
Going to his options, he selected a Hershey’s chocolate bar as his choice of a full food transformation.  He also decided to remain as a chocolate bar overnight until the morning.  He knows that his parents were out to a party and won’t be back home until one in the morning or more, his older brother is at the movies with his girlfriend, and his younger sister is at a sleep over with her friends.  So he won’t have any problems of them coming in and eat him by accident without them knowing he was a chocolate bar.  He decided not to have the mental change on him or the reality change.  There are two reasons why.  For one, he wasn’t going to do much since he’s going to be an inanimate piece of food.  And for two, he doesn’t want to change his reality since he’s going to be a Hershey’s bar for the night and remain like that while the others were asleep.  After putting all the information down, he moved the mouse cursor to the start icon and clicked on it.  After that the timer section popped up and started to tick down.  It said that he has five minutes until the change is complete.  This will give him time to observe all the changes from head to toe.<br />
<br />
The moment he felt a tingling, he knew the changes are starting.  But the strangest part was that the changes weren’t starting all over his body.  Instead it was starting in his groin.  He looked down and noticed a bump slowly sticking out in his pants.  He quickly unzipped the zipper and pulled down both his pants and boxers down to get a quick relive.  After he did that, he noticed his penis growing, extending, and becoming erect without him doing that.  He wondered if this is part of his change from human to chocolate.<br />
<br />
As he was thinking about that, he started to feel a little hot and aroused.  Within moments, his body was on complete automatic.  He got up, took off all of his clothes, and approached his bed with no control what so ever.  Once he got on the bed, he placed his hand on his dick and rubbed it up and down.  He was self-pleasuring himself for no reason and couldn’t stop it.  He continued to stroke harder and harder until he started to exploded in an orgasm.  He then started to cum out of his dick but he didn’t see and seaman coming out of it.  Instead, he saw chocolate coming out of there, like real hot milk chocolate.  He was quite surprised at this and touched it with his fingertips to see if it’s real.  Feeling the melty substance, he begins to realize this was actually real chocolate.  The program was actually turning him into what he likes to eat.<br />
<br />
As he was looking at his hands, Jim noticed the chocolate spreading down his fingers and on his palm.  He then looks down the same thing on his penis as it spread down its shaft while the top kept on exploding like a volcano erupting.  From what he can understand is that the chocolate liquid is going the spread all over his body until it covered him completely.  Even if he wants to stop it, he couldn’t.  He was too horny to cease and his body wouldn’t let him.  Like the Chronivac wants him to do it.  So he continues his masturbation skills while the chocolate spreads.<br />
<br />
While he was stroking his little friend, the chocolate goo went down his shaft and was spreading around his waist area.  At the same time, his hand was completely covered in the same substance and was going down his arm.  Ask once the chocolate covered both his dick and hand, it started to harden and acted like a shell over them.  Yet for some strange reason, he could still move them like a second skin.<br />
<br />
The chocolate continued to spread as hit waist was completely covered from his dick all the way around his butt.  Normally, the chocolate liquid would’ve destroyed the bed sheets he was on.  But it didn’t stain them at all.  It was like the changes were on his body and it’s not staining them one bit.  It was strange for Jim.  But he let that slide as he continued with his changes.<br />
<br />
The chocolate that was on his hand continued to down its arm and up to his elbow.  During that time, the chocolate started to spread up his stomach and back and down his knees.  He was experiencing every moment like it.  The chocolate went down his lower arm and onto his shoulder, slowly creeping up his neck.  He could feel his throat tingling as the brown water was on his skin.  Chocolate spread on his stomach and back and was now up to his chest.  His knees were completely covered in chocolate and it was now on his knees, hardening along the way.  The more the chocolate spread and more Jim was enjoying it.<br />
<br />
The moment it reached his neck, the chocolate was at the bottom of his face and into his mouth.  His teeth and tongue was covered in the same substance.  The moment it was down the inside of his throat, Jim could feel the taste.  But just as it entered his throat, it spread even deeper.  The chocolate spread into his stomach, lungs, liver, muscles, bones, and even his heart.  None of which didn’t kill him.  They were all still functioning like normal.  Jim could feel the brown liquid spreading in his body and was enjoying every second of it.<br />
<br />
Jim’s body was almost covered in chocolate inside and out.  Only twenty five percent of his body was still bare and not covered in brown candy.  But that would soon change.  Chocolate was on his chest and was covering his nipples.  The cocoa one his shoulder went down in his upper chest.  The moment both chocolate’s spread on the top and bottom parts of the chest the two connected forming into one.  The chocolate was now on his lower part of his legs and were getting closer to his feet.  His face was halfway covered as the chocolate went up to his nose and into his nostrils.  Not only is he feeling and tasting the chocolate, he was now smelling chocolate.  <br />
<br />
Almost three minutes in, his body was almost covered.  His entire chest now had chocolate all over him as it went up to his other shoulder and arm.  This same substance was on his feet and was sealed by the toes hardening instantly.  Even his face covered up completely with his eyes seeing chocolate, A.K.A. they were covered in chocolate.  His ears were filled to the brink with chocolate and his brain was covered with chocolate completely.  Even his hair became cocoa as well, as each strand was filled completely.<br />
<br />
Soon enough, his body is covered in a hundred percent chocolate and his disk stopped ejaculating brown cocoa.  Once he finished masturbating himself, he looked down to examine his body.  Everything from head to toe saw made of chocolate and there wasn’t any flesh anywhere.  In the light, his skin gives off a nice shiny sheen.  After a bit of a look over, Jim was amazed at what he was seeing and experiencing.  He almost looked like a chocolate guy from those Hershey’s commercial, or an Axe Chocolate Spray.  He wished he would stay like that forever.  But he was in the halfway mark, so he has to change completely into a chocolate bar.  Once again, he felt another tingling in his body.<br />
<br />
Jim looked at his hands and noticed they were slowly wilting.  He then looked at his body and saw it doing the same thing as his hands.  In seconds, his eyes were getting blurry as his nose and mouth were sealing themselves up.  His probable guess that he was starting to melt away.<br />
<br />
In another minute, his body melting away.  His fingers fused together while his arms absorbed right into his body.  His legs and feet did the same thing as they disappeared as well.  The muscles in his chest loose definition while his nipples vanished away.  His weener started to go limp and melted away completely, absorbing into his skin.  Even his balls shrank away and joined his dick as well, leaving his privates bare and missing.  He could feel his head loosing his likeness was through his shoulders with his eyes, mouth, ears, and nose sealing itself completely.  He was couldn’t speak, couldn’t hear, couldn’t hear, and couldn’t see.  But he could feel every part of his body melting and rearranging.  Once he was melted completely, his body took shape.  It flattened and expanded to fill the entire bed.  On the top surface, designs came out and shapened into what a Hershey’s chocolate bar should look like, small little rectangle squares with the Hershey’s logo on each of them.  What was once his body was now the world’s biggest candy bar.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, something strange happened to the bed.  The bed sheets lifted themselves up and were covering the candy bar.  The first bed sheet changed material and was a shiny aluminum foil wrapping.  The second bed sheet turned into paper and sealed the foil along the way.  The top of the paper changed color from white to brown and the Hershey’s logo appeared on it.  Jim could feel the changes around him and although he couldn’t see, he could imagine what it was like.<br />
<br />
On the final minute, he could now feel himself shrinking.  In reality, there’s no such thing as a big candy bar.  So the chocolate bar that was once Jim shrank on the bed and became the equivocal size of a candy bar itself.  Soon enough, the five minutes were up and Jim was nothing more then a mere Hershey’s bar on the bed.  Jim no longer had any sense except for the one to feel.  So he would tell if anyone would open the wrapping the tried to eat it.  Plus being that his family was away, he won’t have any problems of them finding him in that state.  So all he has to do is remain there and wait until the morning comes.  During that time…</p>
