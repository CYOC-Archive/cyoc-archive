<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ot had been around a month into their journey east, and the heat from the desert below had begun to do its work to everyone abord the train, and with the natural added heat of pregnancy it left everyone tired hot and somewhat grouchy at midday, Lina was one of those people right now, she lay upon the sofa with a electrical fan turned up to the max in her hand, aimed at her face, <br />
<br />
Lina wiped her brow as beads of sweat trickled down her face, a lazy kick then rolled across her belly&#39;s surface, lina watched as the bump that Echos foot caused shifted back and forth, lina then rubbed over the small bump causing Echo to pull back her foot, before putting her hand our to press against Linas getting Lina to smile &quot;I bet you three are doing mutch better I there than were doing out here hey?&quot; She said as she let her head fall back against the armrest, her arm now draped across her belly &quot;and I thought I was big before, but they do say the largest growth spurts are in the last months&quot; Lina muttered to herself as she felt her size.<br />
<br />
Lina looked like she had swallowed a exercise ball, Lina had never felt so tight and full before, even when she had over sixteen babies within her, she felt stretched out sure, but it was never anything like this, her womb felt like a over filled water balloon plus the increased size of her children didn&#39;t help her sence of fullness, This train of thought lead Lina to once again worry about the speed of her children&#39;s development, not a month ago they resembled seven month developed babies, but now they looked like two week old newborns, all three of them which Lina found strange, not just because of the increased maturation speed, but the inclusion of Luna in this acceleration, Luna was human, but somehow her time spent in Linas womb had begun to change her.<br />
<br />
Lunas skin had begun to turn a deep blue, the whites of her eyes had turned black, with her irises turning a glowing blue, but what had Lina concerned was the second pair of arms that had rapidly developed below her original pair, Lina had questioned Echo and Storm about this but even they had no idea of Lunas rapid transformation, &quot;well babies I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on and neither do you, so what do you say we make the most of our situation hey?&quot; Said Lina as she got up and waddled out of the command car.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought I&#39;d find you here&quot; said Viki as she entered the greenhouse car, the car was mostly made up of glass, with a white metal roof and a half barrel shaped glass cover running along the middle, with openable windows should the train travel below the cloud line, the floor was made of marble textured tiles and oak plank plant boxes running down both sides of the car, with a verity of fruit and vegetable plants growing within, but Vikis attention was in the middle of the car, there was a rectangular wood plant box in the middle with a cherry blossom tree planted in the center, with a verity of ferns and flowers blooming at its roots, but at the front and back of the box were two carbon benches, the one at the front was what Viki was staring at, because in it sat Lina.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where else would I be&quot; said Lina as she held a blue Jay on her finger tip, holding it close to her transparent womb, all three babies had their hands up against its surface, stairing wide eyed in wonder at the bird who hopped up and down Linas finger, whistling her tune before fluttering up into the cherry blossom, &quot;this is the coolest car on the train, plus me and the kids love the birds&quot; said Lina as she certessed her belly lovingly &quot;I know what you mean, this is the only room that can calm Chloey from her little tantrums&quot; said Viki as she bent forward, clutching her baby as chloey gave another powerful kick &quot;case in point&quot; chuckled Viki as she refilled her lungs, her silk gown falling off her sholder, but Viki chose not to correct it, it was too hot to worry about modesty, plus it wouldn&#39;t be anything Lina hadn&#39;t seen before thought Viki with a giggle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok whenever you giggle to yourself its never good news&quot; laughed Lina as she heaved herself up and waddled over to kiss her wife on the way past, Viki decided to give Linas ass a quick squeeze, getting an eep in reply, Lina flashing Viki a knowing smirk &quot;your appetite never goes down does it honey?&quot; Said Lina now turning to Viki &quot;not for you hon&quot; said Viki with a smile &quot;if it wasn&#39;t so hot, and if the children were asleep I think I would have a taste of you for myself&quot; she moaned as she rubbed her breasts against Linas, Linas heart rate began to quicken, once again rialing up the babies.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oopse sorry Lina, I should have thought that through, however it was worth it to know I still know how to make your heart race&quot; said Viki with a wink, Lina blushing in reply before pecking her wife on the cheek and waddling towards Sofias new workshop car.<br />
<br />
Sofia was faring no better against the heat, her workshop now had a large air conditioning system installed on the roof, Sofia was currently panting like a dog, sweat bucketing down over her rubber body, her womb nose felt like a miniature furnace, the body heat of her five children who were long overdue to be passed to a birther were causing Sofia to worry her tech was literally going to have a meltdown, the weight and feeling of fullness I her milk filled breasts only added to discomfort, &quot;mommy, I&#39;m hungry&quot; came a small voice, looking down Sofia saw Misty, with Lina, Viki and Lucy having to carry Echo and her kin, as well as Catherine and Violet being tasked to scout ahead on one of Sofia&#39;s new transports, she had been tasked with being Mistys new mother, this task had been slightly aqard for her, the only experience she had ever had with children had bee  ones in a crib and suckling at her breast, it had been her sister who had filled in the groups role for Mama.<br />
<br />
Sofia wiped her eyes at the memory of her sister, she then felt a tiny hand on her leg, looking around her belly she saw Misty looking up at her with tears of her own in her eyes &quot;Mama no cry&quot; she said as she hugged her belly, Sofia held her hand over her heart at this, Misty had realy grown on her, Sofia scooped up Misty and held her to her breast, Misty nestling in and latching on gently as always, it had been three weeks since Lina had asked her to look after Misty and they were already like mother and daughter, Sofia once again wiped her brow as Misty fed and then she herd the sound of her car door sliding open, and in waddled Lina.<br />
<br />
No matter how many times Lina saw Sofia&#39;s new workshop she was stuned by how intricate its design was, the walls were all composed of the same white metal that made up the rest of the train, the roof and floor were both a carbon black material that felt both spongey yet firm, Lina guessed that Sofia had replaced the floor to this material when she was asked to look after Misty, on the left side were metal storage shelves, with a verity of bits and bobs that Lina had no name for, and in the middle of the left wall was a large garage style door, on the right side was a half compleat ground vehicle on what looked like a car lift, it&#39;s carbon tires could spiral in and out to change its shape, and its pipe frame made it light yet sturdy and to top it all off, Sofia had designed them to fold down into human sized rectangles as thick as a plank of wood, looking to the storage closest to the door, lina saw that four had already been completed, as well as some of simular design, but with hover plates simular to the trains instead of wheels, Violet and Catherine had taken one of those three weeks ago and it&#39;s been radio silence ever since &quot;Hey boss you there&quot; came Sofias voice as she got up from her desk chair, her belly leading the way with Misty latched on to Sofias brast happily suckling away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, just lost in thought, and seeing how your doing, again I&#39;m so sorry for putting all this plus Misty on you but as you can see me and the two misses have had our hands tied&quot; chuckled Lina gesturing to her belly as Echo continued to practice her backflips, Sofia smiled &quot;it&#39;s fine, I enjoy keeping my hands busy, plus me and the little lady have grown quite attached to one another, also I&#39;m not overworking, some of the other girls abord come and assist me, there are some things I just can&#39;t manage like I used to&quot; said Sofia petting the side of her swolen womb.<br />
<br />
Then Alice&#39;s voice came over the speakers &quot;all personal report to the command deck........</p>
