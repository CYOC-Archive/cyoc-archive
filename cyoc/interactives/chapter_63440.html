<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The transfusion had managed to stabilize Megan Jenkins from the Mountain Lion's attack. She would likely still need stitches to close the wounds that the wild cat had opened, but considering the emergency and the events of Leona's trial, I doubted the hospital could refuse to treat the injuries. From the back seat of our squad car, I watched as Officer Barnes led the ambulance back to the small clinic in Columbia Falls. It wasn't much, but since Megan wasn't in need of major surgery, going to Kalispell without seeing a more local physician first would have broken the procedure that just about every doctor insisted on following.<br />
<br />
&quot;Will you be alright?&quot; I asked after a few moments.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know,&quot; Officer Barnes answered, &quot;I mean... I guess I'm supposed to be Megan's step-dad now... or at least on the road to it... I've helped Dani... Officer Jenkins with a lot of the things that she's done to make Megan's life happy... and then to find that we... she... nearly lost her. First to the girl's biological father... then to a Mountain Lion.&quot;<br />
<br />
I didn't answer right away.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can tell you that we'll both be very grateful to you and Molly for saving her,&quot; Officer Barnes sighed.<br />
<br />
We continued on at speeds normally not done in town, but to some extent it was for the best. Just in case there was any complication. The one issue was the thing of a &quot;police escort&quot; that Officer Barnes had promised. Ambulances were equipped with their own sirens and the laws were clear that traffic was to clear for any emergency vehicle, law enforcement, fire department, or ambulance. We weren't needed to insure that no one messed with the ambulance. But, as he said, he was probably going to be Megan's step-dad and was concerned for her. I decided not to argue on that issue.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was Molly more then me,&quot; I replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;All the same, if it weren't for her... Megan would be gone,&quot; Officer Barnes answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't even know the school had Molly's blood type...&quot; I commented, &quot;or if it even stayed the same after transforming.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The school nurse probably included a lot of that in whatever medical record forms they probably had her fill out when she was hired with the school,&quot; Officer Barnes commented, &quot;Something rather routine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But as an aide, Molly doesn't draw any medical benefits or something like that,&quot; I told him, &quot;they wouldn't NEED medical information, because she isn't covered by the school for it... that and that we've had to see a vet for our medical needs since moving out here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They don't give her benefits?&quot; Officer Barnes asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;She's listed as a temporary employee for the district,&quot; I responded, &quot;no &quot;temporary&quot; employee gets any benefits package.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe she filled out the form anyway,&quot; Officer Barnes shrugged, &quot;all the same, they had the information, and your wife was able to help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose,&quot; I commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;And regardless, thank your wife for me,&quot; Officer Barnes answered as we arrived at the clinic.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Megan was still unconscious as the EMTs from the ambulance rolled the gurney to the side emergency entrance. She was easily larger then any kid her age, and was the same size as any tiger cub  at the same stage as they grew up in the wild. I couldn't pin point where that was though off the top of my head. Tigers in the wild tended to live to a maximum of 26 years, and it was likely that most tigers in the wild died around age 15, considering how violent the life of a tiger in the wild was. Either from wounds inflicted by hunting too dangerous prey or from conflicts between tigers. And cubs only stayed two years with their mothers. <br />
<br />
Now, Leon, as Leona, had assured every animal-person that their life spans wouldn't suddenly shorten to that of the mundane animal's. We would retain a human lifespan, provided we avoid serious injury or disease. They took her into a small treatment room and slowly moved the sleeping cub onto the table, which was thankfully strong enough to support her weight.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now...&quot; a doctor came forward after a few minutes, thumbing through what reports the EMTs gave him, &quot;the girl was attacked by a Mountain Lion...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Officer Jenkins spoke, &quot;the &quot;tiger-lady&quot; as the kids call her saved my daughter in more ways then one...&quot;<br />
<br />
The doctor nodded and looked at Megan, then at Officer Jenkins, then at Officer Barnes who was holding her hand, and then at me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is he related to the victim?&quot; he asked at me.<br />
<br />
&quot;No sir, he is my partner,&quot; Officer Barnes spoke, &quot;we were the responding officers. Officer Jenkins here has been a VERY good friend of mine and she came out as soon as the school then informed her on the identity of the child that was attacked.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He could be an &quot;uncle&quot; though,&quot; Officer Jenkins spoke up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come again?&quot; the doctor asked.<br />
<br />
He was taking a small electric shaver and was slowly shaving the fur on Megan's belly away from where the wounds left by the Mountain Lion were. The school nurse and the EMTs had managed to get the bleeding stopped, and from what I could see, the very earliest stages of the natural healing process. Not quite &quot;Wolverine&quot; fast, but certainly faster then one would expect from most humans. Likely the higher metabolic rate that Molly and I had found we had after our own transformations.<br />
<br />
&quot;The cub's blood type matches my wife's,&quot; I spoke up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah... well... this is all extremely knew and to be honest, Mr. and Mrs. ...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Barnes and Jenkins,&quot; Officer Barnes answered, &quot;we haven't quite got that far yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
The doctor nodded, &quot;anyway, while the result of the lawsuit that has put the Animatrix Serum on the market has required that we treat animal people... I must tell you that I am not familiar with a tiger's anatomy and stuff. It would probably be easier to use the local vet for her treatment for awhile.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Her wounds!&quot; Officer Jenkins gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Will be treated,&quot; the doctor answered, &quot;the bleeding appears to have stopped, and it appears that the worst of it was merely blood loss. The Mountain Lion's claws didn't dig in deep enough to damage to the internal organs... luckily. All that is needed is to stitch the wounds back up... the seeing of a vet will do better for dealing with vaccinations and any possible diseases your daughter may encounter in the future.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aren't you supposed to study up on these sorts of things?&quot; Officer Barnes asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am... and I have been studying,&quot; the doctor grunted, sounding somewhat frustrated, &quot;but as Leona said at the trial, I'm now having to study the anatomy of more the one species... and in this case, one not native to this country. It will be a long time before I can deal with vaccinations, feline diseases, and other &quot;cat&quot; issues in general, and tiger issues, specifically. A vet will already be prepared for those things.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ass,&quot; Officer Jenkins grumbled under her breath, clearly frustrated that someone would be backing out of treating her child on a routine basis. It was low enough that the doctor wouldn't hear her, but I certainly did.<br />
<br />
&quot;I will also need to see the written permission slip signed by yourself, Mrs. Rhoer-Wayne, and at least one member of the city council,&quot; the doctor continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT?!&quot; Officer Jenkins gasped, &quot;this was all done on the fly... because she was attacked and needed the blood transfusion to save her life!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which is why we aren't asking if your daughter was conscious for the decision,&quot; the doctor replied, &quot;but the laws passed by the city council to restrict the spread of tiger people... animal people through Columbia Falls was very particular, and MUST be followed. No exceptions. If you haven't done that, I will have to report this to the City Council and the school board and let them take it from there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There wasn't any time for that,&quot; Officer Barnes told him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then that is too bad for your partner and his wife,&quot; the doctor gave a smile, &quot;as they will BOTH be unemployed by this time tomorrow.&quot;</p>
