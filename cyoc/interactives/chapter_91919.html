<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff hated what he had become but couldn&#39;t do anything to stop it. His limited senses continuously pushed him to arousal, his arousal brought him to climax and climax ripped away his youth and pushed him closer to taking over his fathers role as the man of the house.<br />
<br />
Jeff wanted to yell that his father would never get away with this, but he knew his father essentially already had. Some minor details needed to be worked out with his mom&#39;s and brother&#39;s understanding of who dad is to them. why he is staying with with Jeff&#39;s family while Jeff isn&#39;t there, and where would Jeff be?<br />
<br />
Dad was back to work and he and Jeff had been working together to orgasm as often as possible, not that Jeff wanted this but he was helplessly addicted and wildly horny all the time. When his dad set them up to recharge from orgasm faster, Jeff wasn&#39;t thinking he meant immediately. Jeff could feel himself trying to focus on accepting his fate and working with his Dad to ensure that his dad&#39;s plan runs smoothly, this way when his dad programs things into the chronivac he can make requests so he likes his life after his Dad runs off with Marc, Jeff hated this because he knew he would normally be yelling at his father but his dad reprogrammed him to make the best of things even if he had to make a sacrifice for everyone else to be happy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad? Whats going to happen when we get home? Mom and Jacob are going to notice you getting younger eventually, and they will miss me by tomorrow, I mean, this all started last night, you may say I&#39;m out with friends tonight but mom wont let that fly for three days in a row.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dad pulled out the chronivac and checked some of the settings, &quot;No we should be good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Since you&#39;re in there, how am I going to be a father, how am I going to run a house, get a job? Im still finding out who I am as a person, how am I supposed to fall into those roles, Im just 16?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff had noticed that his telepathic voice had settled into a much deeper than usual sound, he hadnt been counting how many times they had shifted their ages but he could tell he was older than an hour and a half ago. Jeff&#39;s dad could hear his son&#39;s voice changing and could also feel his son&#39;s fabric penis growing inside him. He had kept count, and he had taken some precautions to keep things from getting crazy. Jeff started to ask what he meant by, &quot;We should be good&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me just demonstrate.&quot; With that, Jeffs father began rubbing the elastic band on Jeff, and then snapping it so Jeff effectively slapped him. This immediately made Jeff ready to go off, and upon doing so Jeff felt a gentle heat settle on him before clearing. <br />
<br />
&quot;Woah dad, what was that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Does your voice sound strange to you. Jeff?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, why would it? Did you feel that warm feeling?&quot;, Jeff answered. <br />
<br />
&quot;How old are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;17. Just like yesterday and the day before that... I guess technically Im 17 and a third plus a month now that, that just happened. What was that warm feeling dad? Didnt you feel it? Why aren&#39;t you answering my question?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff...&quot; Jeff&#39;s dad said with an unmistakable grin in his voice. &quot;We have been having vigorous sex all afternoon, how can your age only be 1 month different?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s brain was spinning from the information, his dad was right, but none of it seemed right. &quot;Dad, could you explain this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Before you accepted your role as my helper, you were imagining all these scenarios where things go wrong. The best solution you and I were able to come up with was recalibrating reality every year. I have access to all your thoughts Jeff. You didnt even notice as I asked your brain to work on the problem or went into the chronivac to make that and a few other adjustments.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your mom and Jacob think its normal for you to be 17 just like you do. I decided they are going to become a year younger with me, Jacob will become 1 and your wife will end up being slightly younger than you. That way you can take over fatherhood with a 1 year old instead of an 11 year old. When you are a few years older you will start to notice your mom and think of her with lust, seeing her as just an older woman. This will intensify until we are around 8 years apart. you will begin calling me brother and you will think of your mom as your wife. you will be her husband and she will think you on a business trip. I will be your brother to them too, visiting from out of town. Once you hit 31, I will be 29 and ready to go after Marc. You will loose your fabric boner and fall asleep. I will take you off, erase your memory of this, restore you to being human, give you a good job and the knowledge to do it, and we will go from there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff couldnt remember his little brother Jacob ever being 11, but he could remember his junior year. Jeff didnt know what to do without being able to trust is memories or what he considered normal. It had been a few minutes and he was still addicted to his dads cum... unable to stop himself the cycle continued.</p>
