<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was late when Damia awoke.  She felt very strange, as well as disoriented.  Laying on the <br />
floor didn't help matters.  She shivered, and realized she was naked.  Which was odd, since <br />
she didn't remember getting undressed. <br />
<br />
As she started to stand, she realized she was laying on shredded bits of clothing....her <br />
clothes!<br />
<br />
Suddendly frightened at the implications, she rose to her feet and looked around wildly for <br />
any sign of intrusion.  If she'd been attacked or raped, surely....er...wait a minute.<br />
<br />
Why did everything look smaller to her?  She towered over the furniture in the room.  <br />
Looking down at herself, she looked the same but....there was no doubt.  She -was- <br />
taller....much taller.<br />
<br />
She quickly made her way into the bathroom, where a full-length mirror was attached to <br />
the door.  <br />
<br />
&quot;My Goddess....look at me!?  But...how?&quot;  She ran her hands over her body, amazed by her <br />
new height.  Though she still retained her slender figure, her legs and arms seemed much <br />
longer, and she could tell she'd gained muscle mass as well.  She felt her nipples <br />
harden...if this was a dream, it was arousing the hell out of her!<br />
<br />
Then she remembered the Chronivac...it was impossible, but...<br />
<br />
She rushed back to the screen.  It was displaying a line drawing of a young woman.  Next <br />
to the woman was a window that said:<br />
<br />
CURRENT HEIGHT: 6'3.6&quot;<br />
CONFIRM: Y/N?<br />
<br />
Damia blinked.  Somehow, the machine had made her a half inch away from 6' 4&quot; tall.  <br />
She'd always wondered what it would be like to be taller, but this was just -too- tall.<br />
<br />
She sat down, frowning at the realization her cute little goth-lolita outfit was trashed, and <br />
looked at her options.  She typed &quot;N&quot;.<br />
<br />
It returned to the WebCam view of herself.  Ok, Resize should work, but what else was <br />
there?  Fooling around with the tabs, she saw the following options:<br />
<br />
Race<br />
Gender<br />
Age<br />
Clothing<br />
Miscellaneous<br />
<br />
She clicked on Clothing.<br />
<br />
A side window opened, with a vast array of clothing options (including nude, which she <br />
had to giggle at).  On a whim, she hit Random.<br />
<br />
Suddendly, she was wearing a pair of low-rider denim jeans with sparkles and little star <br />
and heart designs, pink ankle socks, a pair of thick-soled white tennis shoes, and a pink <br />
baby-t that said &quot;Princess&quot; on it, with a cut-out heart.  <br />
<br />
Which revealed the swell of her breast.  She laughed, realizing this was the kind of outfit a <br />
preteen girl would wear.  <br />
<br />
She hit &quot;accept&quot;, deciding to have some fun.<br />
<br />
Then she looked at the Age tab.  It displayed her current age of 19 in a box.  She clicked <br />
on the box, and erased the 1.  Then she hit return.<br />
<br />
A strange sensation washed over her.  It was warm, and pleasant, like the attention of a <br />
lover...she lay back, moaning softly...this was very nice.  She could feel her body change, <br />
shrinking in size as her clothing became loose on her....after awhile, her breasts dwindled <br />
and shrank away, her figure slimmed and she felt an odd tightness in her crotch.<br />
<br />
Her hips realigned themselves, and her body and pubic hair receded away....and then it <br />
was over, leaving her gasping and wanting more.<br />
<br />
Her voice was higher pitched, and looking up at the computer screen, she saw the webcam <br />
picture of herself, a cute girl (still very tall for her age) wearing clothing much too big for <br />
her.<br />
<br />
She grinned.  That was easily fixed, as she went back to the clothing tab.  A few seconds <br />
later, and her clothing suddendly shrank, and was a perfect fit on her body....except for <br />
the shoes, and one sock, which had fallen to the floor during her transformation.<br />
<br />
The whole affair struck her as hilarious, and despite herself, she laughed.  She hadn't felt <br />
so giddy in a long time.  She kicked off the other shoe and removed her sock.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Hm, but I'm still very tall for a girl my age....let's see, this says I'm 5'7&quot;.  That's <br />
ridiculous...&quot; she reached for the Resize option.  It was tricky, but after a few minutes, she <br />
decided to be 5' tall.  Still tall for a girl her age, but she couldn't resist the urge to be taller <br />
than her original size.<br />
<br />
Examining miscellaneous, she noticed the options in there included hair and eye color, <br />
skin complexion...all manner of fun stuff.  After toying with the options for awhile, she <br />
gave herself short platinum hair and dark blue eyes.  She ran her fingers through her hair, <br />
and giggled again.  This was fun!  She'd turned herself into a completely different person.<br />
<br />
Sliding out of the chair, her bare feet touched the plastic runner.  Her shoes wouldn't fit, <br />
with one being made for a 19 year old amazon...but she doubted anyone would mind if <br />
she went around barefoot.  A grumbling in her stomach made her realize how hungry she <br />
was.   She'd missed dinner by an hour!<br />
<br />
It was her own fault, since she'd played with the options to give herself a very flat <br />
tummy...it looked awesome, but well, the price tag was that she didn't have much inside.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just one last change, and I'll get some food.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Going back to Miscellaneous, she found the option which would give her more muscle.  <br />
Not enough to look strange, but she'd always wanted to be stronger.  Then she noticed an <br />
option that said SUPER STRENGTH.<br />
<br />
Right clicking on it, it said the following:<br />
<br />
SUPER STRENGTH: This allows the subject to have strength vastly in excess of what their <br />
muscle and body frame could produce.<br />
<br />
Since she'd already made herself as strong as a very tall 9 year old girl could be without <br />
looking freakish, this would be perfect.  This option let her multiply her strength by a <br />
given number.  Not really sure what to put in, she decided to give herself 4x the strength <br />
of a girl of her muscle and body type.  That should do it, she thought to herself, as she <br />
grabbed some money, her keys, and headed out, looking for dinner.<br />
<br />
Not noticing a window pop up on her computer.<br />
