<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The two girls went through to the kitchen and grabbed a couple bottles of wine, then went straight up to Emily&#39;s room, shutting the door behind them. Music was quickly switched on and they both had a swig from their bottles.<br />
<br />
While Kate went through her bag of clothes, Emily checked on her phone. She scrolled through the group chats, then found another notification from the weird app.<br />
<br />
&#39;Nate Andrews - Updated&#39;<br />
<br />
Emily&#39;s stomach dropped, but she opened the app anyway despite her apprehension. Next to her own name it still said &#39;Cow&#39; but it had increased to 5%. Emily was still confused about what this meant, but she scrolled down to find Nate. When she found his name, it had &#39;Pig&#39; next to it, at 1%.<br />
<br />
&#39;What the fuck?! Is this thing listening to me?&#39; she initially thought. <br />
&#39;Wait but it was upstairs when I said that to Kate...&#39;. Suddenly it clicked that she referred to herself as a cow earlier.<br />
&#39;Is this thing just recording what I say about people then? But why? What does that even achieve?&#39;<br />
Emily debated about whether she should tell Kate about the app, but decided against it. At least until she knew what it was doing with the information.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anything interesting in the chats Em? You look pretty concerned&quot; <br />
<br />
Emily snapped out of it again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yea it&#39;s all fine, just checking my bank balance, you know how it is&quot; she lied, forcing a laugh with it.<br />
<br />
Emily continued drinking her wine while Kate showcased her non-casual outfits. She was always quite jealous of her friends figure. They&#39;d known each other since they were 7, and while Emily was the taller one, she always thought Kate had a more feminine figure. She certainly blossomed earlier than Emily, and had always been quite well endowed in the chest since then, which her smaller frame happened to enhance.<br />
<br />
Emily realised she was just staring at Kate&#39;s boobs while she was standing there waiting for her thoughts on the dress.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess that response says it all!&quot; Kate laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yea! Sorry you just look like a stone cold fox in that dress. Your boobs look amazing&quot; Emily&#39;s gaze was broken from them when she noticed her phone light up again out the corner of her eye.<br />
<br />
She reached for it when Kate interrupted her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Em, does it look alright from the back?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yea definitely, it&#39;s a good length, shows off enough of your legs without going too far.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay good, you think this&#39;ll grab Eli&#39;s attention for the night?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For sure! I doubt he&#39;ll be looking at anyone else&quot;<br />
<br />
Eli was Nate&#39;s best friend, so if Kate was sure he would be there, it was confirmation that Nate was going to be out too.<br />
<br />
Kate blushed at the reply. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey shouldn&#39;t you start getting ready now too?&quot; She asked, changing the subject.<br />
<br />
&quot;I will in a minute, I think I&#39;m just gonna go for another cig first&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay well hurry up! I&#39;m gonna start my hair and makeup but I&#39;ll come out with you next time&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily grabbed a cigarette from her pack and put it between her lips, then grabbed her phone and went out into the back garden.<br />
<br />
Emily lit it up and left it dangling from her mouth so she could use her phone easier.<br />
<br />
&#39;Kate Miller - Updated&#39; was sat on her home screen. She quickly opened it up. There were no changes to her percentage this time, but now &#39;Fox&#39; was listed next to Kate&#39;s name, also at 1%.<br />
She scrolled down to find Nate had increased to 3%.<br />
Emily didn&#39;t know whether she should be concerned about this or not, but either way it was stressing her out slightly. Ash fell onto her phone and she realised she&#39;d already finished her smoke without even taking it from her mouth, but she used it to light another then started trying to search for the app on the web.<br />
No matter how she worded it, there wasn&#39;t anything relevant in the search results, so she locked her phone and stuffed it into her hoodie pocket. <br />
<br />
Emily was sat there power smoking her second cigarette when she found herself staring at the grass again.<br />
<br />
&#39;It definitely looks tastier than it used too...&#39; she started wondering.<br />
&#39;A little bit wouldn&#39;t hurt would it? Just to satiate my curiosity?&#39;. Emily stood up and glanced through the kitchen window to see if anyone was in there, then looked up to see that the curtains were pulled shut in the twin&#39;s rooms.<br />
&#39;Nobody has to know... Just a quick mouthful to see if it really does taste as good as it looks, that&#39;s all&#39; she reasoned with herself. The thought of doing it was actually turning Emily on slightly, giving her major deja vu from when she started smoking. The idea of doing something she shouldnt really aroused her, which just made her want it even more.<br />
<br />
&#39;Yea just one handful can&#39;t hurt, then I better go get ready&#39; she decided.<br />
Emily did one more check of the windows to make sure nobody was watching, then quickly walked out to the turfed part of the garden and squatted down. She took one long, last drag on her cigarette and tossed it to one side, then ripped out a clump of grass from the ground. <br />
She gave it a sniff first, then eagerly shoved it into her mouth.<br />
<br />
&#39;Oh god, that&#39;s soooo good&#39; she thought as she slowly chewed it, savouring the taste. When she swallowed it, her stomach filled with a warmth that moved up to her breasts. Without a second thought, she got all fours and pushed her face into another clump of grass, pulling it out with her teeth. She repeated this a few more times, before regaining some ounce of self control.<br />
<br />
Emily forced herself back into the house, and leaned against the kitchen counter.<br />
&#39;Where the fuck did that come from? People don&#39;t just eat grass!&#39; she scolded herself.<br />
&#39;Go the fuck upstairs, get ready and go out so you can get fucked&#39;. Emily wasn&#39;t entirely sure she actually thought like that normally, but it was better than the grass thoughts so she settled on it.<br />
<br />
Emily went back up to her room, and started gulping down the wine. She needed to get the grass taste out of her mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck took you so long?&quot; Kate asked. She&#39;d already finished her hair and was just starting on her makeup.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry&quot; Emily said, after forcing down that last mouthful of wine. She started getting undressed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just got a bit distracted on my phone out there&quot;. She finished pulling her baggy hoodie off, and emerged to see Kate staring at her body, jaw dropped. Emily looked down at herself, and tried not to look as shocked on the outside as she was on the inside.<br />
<br />
&quot;Err... Em? Have you put on a little weight? And not in a bad way?&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily didn&#39;t really know what to say, so she just forced a smug grin and a shrug.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh you bitch!&quot; Kate laughed.<br />
&quot;How the fuck have you managed to keep those beasts hidden for so long?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily turned and looked in the mirror. Her breasts had grown at least a cup size, maybe even two. They were definitely too big for the bra she was wearing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fashion choices, I guess?&quot; She hoped that sounded more convincing to Kate than it did to herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you definitely succeeded at that! Why are you wearing that bra with them though? Haven&#39;t you bought new ones yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess I just didn&#39;t realise they&#39;d grown so much&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh you sly bitch, there&#39;s no way you could not NOT notice they were getting that much bigger. Well anyway you&#39;re lucky I brought extra bras for my different outfits, so you can borrow one of those for now.&quot; Kate handed her a lacey white bra. <br />
<br />
&quot;See how that fits&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily unhooked the old bra and her breasts jiggled out freely. She didn&#39;t bother trying to hide them as the old bra didn&#39;t hide much anyway. She hooked up the new one, which fit better although it was maybe a tad too big.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like you&#39;re almost a D with me!&quot; Kate said excitedly, then went back to doing her makeup.<br />
<br />
Emily grabbed her black jeans and started putting them on. They felt a little tighter around the arse and hips, but she managed to squeeze into them. The v-neck was a different story, and only vaguely resembled how it used to once she managed to pull it over her new tits. It was pretty stretched out, and more than just a sneak peak of her cleavage was visible. It couldn&#39;t even reach her jeans anymore, revealing a slight, but sexy amount of midriff.<br />
<br />
Emily took a moment to admire herself in the mirror.<br />
&#39;I look hot as fuck!&#39; she thought.<br />
&#39;I&#39;m definitely getting some tonight&#39; Emily  thought, then quickly straightened her hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Em, wanna come for a smoke?&quot; Kate asked, already dangling one.<br />
<br />
Emily thought for a second. The wine was kicking in hard now and she really needed another smoke, but the idea of being around the grass again made her uneasy. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sure&quot; Emily said, grabbing her pack and phone. She couldn&#39;t fight all her cravings at once.</p>
