<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chris wasn&#39;t sure how humankind reproduced if everyone had penises.  He could ask around, but that might get awkward.  Besides, he could just use the Controller of Reality to change how reproduction was done.  It seemed like the Controller could do literally anything, so he had the opportunity to get creative.<br />
<br />
Going through the Controller&#39;s options, he found an option for reincarnation.  He set it so that when someone dies, their conciousness gets sent to a random body part.  From there, they can unmerge from their host, becoming a physical copy of them as a young adult, retaining their memories and gaining their host&#39;s.<br />
<br />
And since everyone would reincarnate as a young adult with all the knowledge of their past life, there was no need for kids.  So he aged all kids in the world up to young adult.<br />
<br />
Chris confirmed his decisions... and started flailing on his back, as his world and body seemed to distort itself!  Why wasn&#39;t his body moving like he expected?  Why could he see both sides of the bathroom at the same time?<br />
<br />
And then, he paused his flailing when his eyes caught sight of something large flapping on either side of him.  And when he paused, so did the objects.  Making a connection between what he saw and how his body felt, he lifted his right arm... only to see a bird&#39;s large wing lift off the floor on his right.  He craned his neck to look down at his body.  He saw a mass of feathers, with a pair of yellow bird feet sticking up.  He flexed his toes, and saw the bird&#39;s toes flex.<br />
<br />
Chris laid his head back on the floor.  He was a bird.  Why was he a bird???  He closed his eyes, and thought about the changes he just made.  Reincarnation, random body part... wait.  He didn&#39;t specify the body part of a human.  Was he reincarnated into a bird&#39;s body part in this reality?<br />
<br />
Opening his eyes, Chris slowly tried to lift himself off the floor.  It was somewhat awkward, the way his body was built.  He wanted to use his hands, but not only did he no longer use his hands, but his wings were proportionately way bigger than his arms were.  The trickiest part was getting on his feet.  He found it was similar to walking on hooves, so he had a little experience there.  But as soon as he stood up straight, he found himself losing balance and falling over, again.  He tried again, this time remembering that birds had a different posture.  He couldn&#39;t stand straight like a human.<br />
<br />
Spreading his wings out to keep his balance, he carefully stepped toward the mirror.  What he saw was enough to make his lower beak drop.  His reflection was that of a bald eagle!  With his wings spread out as they were, he looked absolutely majestic.  A little awkward with unsure footing, but majestic.  Height-wise, he seemed about as tall as he was as a half-sized man.  And his wingspan was something else.  In this apartment bathroom, his wings almost reached wall to wall!<br />
<br />
Chris slowly pulled his wings in, and slowly turned in front of the mirror, looking at his profile.  He wasn&#39;t sure if he liked this or not.  On the one hand, he turned into an animal, that&#39;s cool.  But he had no intention of going all the way like this.  He didn&#39;t even consider becoming a bird, of any sort!<br />
<br />
He looked at his chest.  One of the first things he noticed was that he was wearing a satchel strapped to his chest, the strap going around his shoulder and chest like a purse.  He craned his neck down, and opened the flap of the satchel with his beak.  Inside, he could see a plastic card.  With a little effort, he was able to pull it out and look at it.  It was his ID, showing him as a bald eagle.  Same name.  Reincarnated in 2012.  So he was 11 years old?  No, he made it so everyone reincarnates as a young adult.  How old was he in bird years?  How old is he now?  He didn&#39;t feel old.  Still, he probably couldn&#39;t expect to live to 100, anymore, so that was a bit depressing.  At least he knows that reincarnation is a thing, now.<br />
<br />
Chris noticed one other detail on the ID, even more important than his age.  Sex: FEMALE???  He... she looked between her legs.  She knew things felt different down there, but she assumed that was because birds have different plumbing.  She facepalmed with her wing.  Why didn&#39;t she make the same changes to animals that she made to humans?<br />
<br />
Wait... she still could!  It might be a little tricky without hands, but she could totally use the Controller of Reality to give her a more comfortable body!<br />
<br />
But as she looked around the bathroom, the Controller was nowhere to be found.  She blinked her eyes and shook her head.  Maybe she just wasn&#39;t used to having her eyes pointed sideways.  She closed one eye, and looked around with the other, turning in place as she scanned the room.  But, she still couldn&#39;t see the Controller.  Did she not have it in this reality?  Why did she have it in other realities but not this one?  Is it because she&#39;s an animal?  Unless it&#39;s just placed somewhere else.<br />
<br />
She carefully started walking out of the bathroom.  She found walking with bird feet both easier and harder than walking with hooves.  On the one hand, she was lighter, and the way her toes were spread meant she had more grip with the floor.  At the same time, it was harder because she wasn&#39;t used to having a toe pointing backwards.  And her tailfeathers were dragging on the floor, too.  She wished she knew how to move in this body.  Wasn&#39;t she supposed to have inherited the memories of her reincarnation host?</p>
