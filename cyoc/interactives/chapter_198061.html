<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">We now return to the office of Diane in Heaven.  You may remember her, she is a bureaucratic Angel, tall, hot librarian glasses?  She was currently focused on her paperwork, while a young Angel of below average height was kneeling between her legs, under her desk.<br />
<br />
The Angel wasn&#39;t Amielle, of course, but her replacement, who was simply named Love.  Love was also a Second Class Angel, and quite new at her job.  She was wide eyed and very sweet-natured, and was doing her best to please her new girlfriend.<br />
<br />
She&#39;d never had a girlfriend before, but Diane was good to her, if a little stern at work.  At home, however, she was very different (she&#39;d already asked the young Angel to move in, which made Love deliriously happy).<br />
<br />
Even now, Love was thinking about cooking and cleaning for her lover, and other things that filled her tiny body with visions of domestic bliss.  Diane noted that Love was, if anything, somehow less bright than her predecessor, but had a great deal more common sense.  And she was so adorable!<br />
<br />
Just then, the Dominion entered Diane&#39;s office, causing her to bolt upright so suddenly, Love hit her head on Diane&#39;s chair.  A soft “Ow!” could be heard from under her desk.<br />
<br />
Diane blushed but, being a professional, didn&#39;t let that affect her demeanor.  “Dominion, how may I help you?”<br />
<br />
The nine-foot tall woman shook her head.  “I see you took my advice, Diane.”<br />
<br />
“Yes, come on out, Love.” Diane commanded.<br />
<br />
Making sure to wipe her face with a napkin, Love scrambled out from under the desk.  She was under 5&#39; tall, with a cute, heart-shaped face framed by a hairstyle featuring long bangs.  Her hair was a light pink color.  She had large, bright blue eyes and reminded most people of a younger sister (even if they didn&#39;t have one).  She was wearing a simple pink dress (that being her favorite color) and was barefoot.<br />
<br />
The little Angel curtsied, not really sure what the etiquette was here.  “Lady Dominion, it&#39;s a pleasure to meet you.  I&#39;m Love.”<br />
<br />
Despite looking older, Love had only been 12 when she died.  She&#39;d had a tragic past as a child prostitute, but somehow, she had kept her faith in God when others would rail against their Creator.  When asked about returning to life, she said she would rather stay in Heaven- Earth was too cold and too cruel for her.<br />
<br />
So she&#39;d been made a Second Class Angel, and her memories of her old life removed.  Her name was unusual for an Angel, but Naming was above the Dominion&#39;s paygrade.  It certainly did suit her, however.  “Could you give us a few minutes, Love?  I have something important to talk with Diane about.”<br />
<br />
“Oh!  Of course!  So sorry!  I&#39;ll go type something!”  The little Angel dashed off, kicking her bare feet behind her as she half-ran, half-flew out the door.<br />
<br />
“A little young, I know, but she&#39;s a hard worker.”  Diane explained.<br />
<br />
“Oh yes, she was working very hard when I came in.”  The Dominion wasn&#39;t trying to be crass or judgmental, but she just had that kind of voice.  She mentally sighed when she saw Diane flinch.  The problem of being management is that you really can&#39;t be friends with your employees.  “Anyways, it seems we have another of the Fallen starting to spend an inordinate amount of time on Earth.”  She put a file down on Diane&#39;s desk.<br />
<br />
Diane opened it and gasped.  “Dantalyon?!  What&#39;s going on?”<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m not sure, but according to Raphael&#39;s report, Gemory coming into contact with the girl, Danielle was no accident.  I have a feeling that we&#39;ll find similar evidence in this case.”<br />
<br />
Diane flipped through the file on the mortal girl, Cole, and her eyes got as large as Love&#39;s.  “Wait...this can&#39;t be...”<br />
<br />
“Yes, somehow, this one slipped through the cracks.  She has no idea who her &#39;father&#39; was.  So now we have two Dukes of Hell who have encountered unusual mortals, and are now consorting with them on Earth.  It might be a coincidence, but...”<br />
<br />
“Trifles light as air are to the jealous confirmations strong as proofs of holy writ”, Diane quoted.<br />
<br />
“I rather prefer a more direct quote”, The Dominion said.  “Coincidence is God&#39;s way of being anonymous.”<br />
<br />
“You think this is part of the plan?” Diane gasped.  “Then why weren&#39;t we given instructions?”<br />
<br />
“You and I both know that God has never told us the entire Plan.  Our reactions could be taken into account.  After all, who else could have foreseen what would happen when Amielle encountered that Succubus?”<br />
<br />
“...point taken, Dominion.”  Diane nodded.  “I take it you want eyes on Dantalyon, then?”<br />
<br />
“Yes.  Maybe don&#39;t send someone young and impressionable this time.”  The Dominion said.<br />
<br />
Again, Diane flinched.  Millennia of good work, and now this blight on her record!  “I have just the Angel in mind, Dominion.”<br />
<br />
“You can call me Mazarine, Diane.”  The Dominion, Mazarine, said.<br />
<br />
“Yes, Dom...I mean, Mazarine.”  Diane was confused.  Being allowed to use her superior&#39;s name wasn&#39;t a reward she had been expecting.<br />
<br />
“Since we may need to start working more closely from here on out, I feel we should have a better relationship.”  Mazarine paused.  “I don&#39;t suppose you&#39;re free anytime this week after work?”<br />
<br />
Diane blinked.  “I can clear my schedule, Mazarine.”<br />
<br />
“Good.  I was thinking dinner.  Bring Love with you.”  With that, Mazarine strode out.<br />
<br />
And for the first time, Diane caught herself looking at her superior&#39;s shapely behind.  &#39;I&#39;m either going to get a promotion out of this, or a whole heap of trouble&#39;, she thought to herself.<br />
<br />
Love poked her head back in the room.  “Any orders, Diane?”<br />
<br />
“Oh good, Love.  Yes.  Two things.  We have a date one night this week, go get yourself a nice dress.  And some shoes.”<br />
<br />
Love pouted a bit.  She really didn&#39;t care for shoes, after all, she could fly!  But a date?  And a new outfit?  That brightened her day quite a bit!  “Sure thing, Diane!”<br />
<br />
“But before you wander off, I need to see Jophiel.”<br />
<br />
Love&#39;s eyes somehow managed to get even bigger than normal.  “Uh..of course, right away!”<br />
<br />
<br />
Jophiel entered the office of the Principality who went by the name “Diane”.  Jophiel was a girl of average height, with short blonde hair.  Her wings were golden, and carefully nestled between them was a sheathed greatsword about a foot shorter than she was.  She wore a dark red backless jumpsuit, and apparently, not unlike Love, she didn&#39;t care for shoes.  Despite being a great beauty, even among Angels, she had a sullen look about her.  She brushed past Love after being announced, and leaned her sword against Diane&#39;s desk before sitting down in a chair.<br />
<br />
Slouching down would be a better way to describe it, as the Angel had very bad posture.  It was hard to pin down her exact age- Jophiel was traditionally a young lady, but over the centuries, the mortal age of majority had risen and Jophiel wasn&#39;t 100 percent on board with the times- she still remembered when 12 was considered old enough to be engaged, and a girl of 15 was practically an old maid, after all.<br />
<br />
So she could be best described as “teenish”, with the demeanor of a 35 year old.<br />
<br />
Diane didn&#39;t like dealing with Jophiel, whose name literally meant “God&#39;s Beauty”.  Once upon a time, she&#39;d been the Archangel of Wisdom, Understanding, and Judgement (though she was one of the few, like Uriel, who still carried around her flaming sword).  Over the years, however, she&#39;d become more and more jaded and insufferable, and was now mainly reserved for dangerous missions.<br />
<br />
“Jophiel, it&#39;s good that you&#39;re here...” Diane started.<br />
<br />
“Jo.” The Archangel interrupted.  “I go by Jo now.”<br />
<br />
Diane blinked.  This was new.  “Jo, then.  Anyways, I have a mission for you...”<br />
<br />
“Who do I have to kill?” Jo drawled.  While not an Angel of Death, she was an Angel of Judgement, and her sword wasn&#39;t for show.<br />
<br />
“Hopefully, no one.  This is primarily a reconnaissance mission.”  Diane handed the file to Jo.<br />
<br />
Jo looked at it.  “I&#39;m shocked.  It&#39;s almost like people forgot I was a spy.”<br />
<br />
&#39;Gee, I can&#39;t imagine why&#39;, Diane thought, but she was too much of a professional to snark at her employees.  Though privately, she really wanted to bust their chops like Dame Judi Dench in the Bond movies.  She watched as Jo read the file indifferently, then the Archangel rose an eyebrow and whistled.<br />
<br />
“A Second Generation?  How&#39;d you guys miss her for so long?”  <br />
<br />
“I have no idea, I just found out myself.  For the moment, however, Dantalyon is the person of interest.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, Dantalyon&#39;s a cagey fucker.  Subtle, has a lot of tricks, not one for straight up fights.  Wish you&#39;d called me in for Gemory.”  The Archangel smiled.  “She&#39;s a real wildcat.  And not just in bed.”<br />
<br />
Diane stoically ignored the crass Archangel.  Jophiel had once been as sweet and gentle as Love.  What she had become was tragic.  But she was loyal and good at what she did.  Even if what she did wasn&#39;t pretty.  “So you can begin at once?”<br />
<br />
Jo hopped to her feet and picked up her sword as if it weighed no more than a toothpick.  “Yeah, yeah, keep your panties on...oh, you&#39;re not even wearing panties, are you?  Naughty girl.”  She flashed a toothy grin.  “Let me guess, you and Pinky out there?”<br />
<br />
Diane simply responded with a glare that could freeze water.<br />
<br />
Jo just chuckled and headed for the door, returning the sword to it&#39;s position between her wings in a smooth motion that would be impossible for most.  Once she was gone, Diane let out a scream of frustration.<br />
<br />
Love poked her head back in.  “Did you call, Diane?”<br />
<br />
“Yes.  I think we&#39;re going home early today, Love.  I need a hot bath and some extra pampering, I&#39;m afraid.”<br />
<br />
Love smiled.  “I think I can help with that.”  She moved to Diane&#39;s side, and the Principality gently stroked the pinkette&#39;s hair before flexing a bit to straight up teleport them home.  Her job was hard, but Love really did make things a lot easier.</p>
