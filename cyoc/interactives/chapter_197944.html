<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lucas was stunned seeing the man in the mirror. He could hardly believe his eyes, in fact he felt like this was definitely a dream. In the mirror was a tall muscular adonis of a man that looked very much like him! He found that at the height he now stood at, he actually had to bend down a little to get full view of his head.<br />
His head, for the most part, looked very similar, with just a few differences. First, his hair was the same length and color he usually had, but underneath his face he had a full beard, making him look much older than the 21 years old he was. Even despite the beard, he could tell that his jaw had become a bit squarer, enough to give off a masculine energy.  His neck had grown thicker with muscle, and his Adam’s apple had grown pronounced, making his voice almost an octave deeper. If it wasn’t for the look of surprise on his face, the overall timid look he normally wore would have been replaced with a intimidating, confident look.<br />
Below his neck, he was completely hairless, showcasing a large and wide muscular body. His pec muscles were large and heavy, big enough to leave a firm crease underneath, but not so large he could not see his own feet if he were to look down. His stomach was covered in muscles, leaving no trace of any fat on his body. The muscles beside his abs were also easily visible, and he didn’t bother to count the muscles there as most muscular men did, since he didn’t even know what would be counted as abs. He did find enjoyment, however, in watching these muscles contract and expand as he moved, stretching around to watch them flex and relax. He also had a tattoo on the side of his stomach, a line of Japanese kanji. He recognized it, but didn’t recall what it said.<br />
On either side of his wide chest sat two melon-sized arms, with clear veins running down his arms and forearms, which were proportionately large and impressive. Above his arms were large boulder shoulders and his hands were thick and large, but not out of place compared to the new size of his body. Looking down, he also had two large legs, with thick muscular thighs and impressive calves. His feet also seemed larger, but again seemed about the same in proportion.<br />
Still not believing this to be real, Lucas wanted to experiment with the body he found himself in. First, he placed his hands on his stomach. In doing so, he noticed a few things. First, where his usual ‘treasure trail’ of hair was normally, there was now nothing. Not a single trace of hair, he was completely smooth-skinned, as if it wasn’t shaved off but instead he was just completely hairless. Second, and he had to look at his hands to confirm this, he didn’t have a single callous on his hands. He knew that for someone to have the body he currently was looking at, it would require a long, long time spent in the gym, and that time would form callouses on their hands, but his hands were the same as before, just larger and thicker. This could only mean that if this was real, however this body happened it wasn’t earned. Lastly, though, al’s most important, as he placed his hand back on his muscular stomach, he felt incredibly turned on. The mere feeling of his abs and obliques being rubbed felt intensely arousing. He moved his other hand to his chest, grabbing one of his pecs, and squeezing it. As he did so, his arousal increased tenfold, he closed his eyes and moaned loudly, forgetting where he was as he become overwhelmed by his own arousal. The hand on his stomach began to migrate down, reaching for what he assumed to be a equally massive cock.<br />
Instead what he felt was a very small, hard 1-inch nub.<br />
He opened his eyes and looked for the spot between his legs in the mirror, which he had to step back to do so, placing his muscular back against the wall across from the mirror. Between his legs was a very foreign sight, and the last thing he expected to see. The dick he was sporting was indeed hard, but stuck out only an inch or less and even his pinky finger was thicker than it. His ballsack was nowhere to be found. Instead, below the micro penis, was a slit, a vagina! He could easily tell that this slit was moist, almost dripping with a liquid of some kind. Curiosity overtook him as he touched the liquid and held it up to his nose, immediately recognizing the smell. It was his own cum!<br />
His arousal began to get the better of him. As one hand massaged his pecs and abs, the other one began to slide a finger into the slit, providing massive amounts of pleasure to Lucas. He moaned loudly, unable to control it and began to slide a second finger into his vagina. <br />
“H-hey, um… d-do you mind if I… uh, you know, since you’re already getting off, if I… um…” Lucas heard from beside him, the doorway to the bathroom. He opened his eyes and looked to see his roommate, Chris, but looking a bit different than he was used to. <br />
Chris was just a bit taller, but shorter than Lucas was used to, comparatively. He had the same body hair that he did the day before, a fair coating but not thick. He looked a bit bigger in the face, abs his beard a bit fuller. Chris’ pecs also looked a bit plumper, and instead of showcasing a toned stomach, there was a thin layer of fat there, enough that you could no longer see the muscles on his stomach as he stood like you could just the day before. <br />
Most importantly, between Chris’ legs stood an erect 10” penis, thick too, looking like a phallic energy drink sticking straight out of Chris’ pubic bush, and a large ballsack hanging underneath to match. <br />
Chris stood in the doorway with a lustful look on his face as he stared at Lucas’ fingers inserted into his crotch. Chris swallowed timidly before finishing his thought. <br />
“W-will you let me cum inside you again…?”</p>
