<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen was constantly looking in the mirror, looking more closely at the new vagina on her face, when her doorbell rang. She couldn&#39;t just answer the door naked, so she ran to her room and dressed as fast as she could. Her blouse was easy, but to hide her cock she had to wear the longest skirt she had, one that completely covered her legs and she had never worn it before. Only then she could hide her cock, which dangled between her legs with the tip just a few inches above the floor.<br />
<br />
In the delay to answer the person the front door began to ring desperately. When Jen was dressed, she ran and, as soon as she finished going down the stairs, she tried to scream that she was about to open the door, but she remembered that she couldn&#39;t because she no longer had a mouth. Thinking fast she took a cloth that was thrown nearby and tied it to her face like a mask and opened the door to see who was calling.<br />
<br />
Jen barely opened the door and the person who was ringing the door was already entering her house. Among the people she knew, only one would do that and she was not wrong, it was Heidy, a friend of hers since high school. Unlike her, Heidy married shortly after she graduated from college, her husband was a wealthy man and she always had something to do. They just had no children because Heidy was sterile due to an illness she had as a teenager.<br />
<br />
&quot;Finally Jen, it took you so long to answer the door that I thought you were ignoring me.&quot; Heidy said without looking at Jen, who noticed that she was carrying a suitcase. She didn&#39;t even look back and went up to the second floor with Jen following her. &quot;What was the guest room again?&quot; she asked<br />
<br />
As she couldn&#39;t speak, Jen simply went ahead and opened the guest room door, which was a little messy since she hadn&#39;t cleaned in a few weeks, since her parents spent a few days  there.<br />
<br />
Heidy sat on the bed, looked at Jen and said &quot;Jen, I just had an argument with my husband. Do you remember that about 10 years ago I told you that I was very proud of his solidarity, because he had helped a single mother to get a good job? And how much had she become friends with us after that? Yeah, I found out they were having an affair. I left for my community work but forgot my wallet, so I had to go home and get it, but when I went into the room I caught them naked on our bed. We argued, but the woman said I had better find out, so she wouldn&#39;t have to disguise it anymore. She even threw in my face that my husband was the father of her son all along and that he had impregnated her when we were already married. I couldn&#39;t take it, so I packed up and left that house. I had nowhere to go, so I decided to stay here until I decided what to do from now on. I hope I&#39;m not being a nuisance.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do I do now? Her situation is complicated, I would do the same if I were in her place, I also don&#39;t care if she stays here at home, but she arrived at the worst possible time. I don&#39;t know what kind of reaction she will have when she finds out what happened to me.&quot; Jen thought, unable to say anything<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s your problem Jen? You are very quiet. Say something.&quot; Heidy said<br />
<br />
Jen thought of a way to answer her friend, so she took her cell phone and used it to send a text message that said &quot;I&#39;m sorry, but something happened and I&#39;m not able to speak now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Heidy read the message and said &quot;Something happened? Don&#39;t tell me that you are sick.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can rest easy, I&#39;m not sick.&quot; Jen replied with another text message<br />
<br />
&quot;So did you have an accident and get hurt? Is that why your face is eaten? Do you want to hide the scar?&quot; Heidy asked<br />
<br />
&quot;It is not like that either. It&#39;s just something weird.&quot; Jen texted<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean something weird? What happened?&quot; Heidy asked<br />
<br />
&quot;You will not want to know, you will be disgusted.&quot; Jen texted<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop making excuses. All you do is make me want to know what happened to you.&quot; Heidy said<br />
<br />
Jen thought about it and sent the text &quot;Okay, I&#39;ll show you, but you have to promise me that you won&#39;t make a fuss.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, now tell me right away what happened so you can&#39;t speak.&quot; Heidy said<br />
<br />
Jen then removed the cloth that covered her face, showing the pussy on her face to Heidy who gaped.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it? What happened to your face? Is that a vagina instead of your mouth?&quot; Heidy asked surprised<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right, and it&#39;s incredible.&quot; Jen texted<br />
<br />
&quot;It can&#39;t be, it can&#39;t be the real thing.&quot; Heidy said and quickly she was already standing in front of Jen, where she started to feel the pussy on her face.<br />
<br />
Jen knew she should be mad at the intrusion, but deep down she felt like she wanted it and was enjoying being touched. This made her cock start to get hard and lift her skirt, something Heidy noticed.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is happening? There&#39;s something big under your skirt Jen.&quot; Heidy said<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s just my new dick. It&#39;s a little big but it&#39;s really good to have it between my legs.&quot; Jen texted<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you get a dick too? No way, I have to see this.&quot; Heidy said and lifted Jen&#39;s skirt, exposing her cock and saying &quot;What the hell is this. Your cock is not a little big, it is huge.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s big enough that I can suck it myself without a problem. Okay that when I did that my mouth turned into a pussy.&quot; Jen texted<br />
<br />
&quot;But how did it happen? You are not going to say that your dick just grew out of nowhere.&quot; Heidy said<br />
<br />
Jen ran to the kitchen and came back with the spray bottle of &#39;Salve of Transformation&#39; with her. &quot;I just splashed some of it on my crotch it didn&#39;t take long to grow.&quot; she texted<br />
<br />
&quot;This is incredible, who would say that something like this exists.&quot; Heidy said</p>
