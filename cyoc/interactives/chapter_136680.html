<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Ahhhh… thank you,&quot; Spencer gave a heavy and actually contented sigh as she settled down onto the blanket that Morgan Barr had set up.<br />
<br />
In an odd way she did feel genuinely better. That burning desire that never seemed to be sated seemed to have gone away and she&#39;d found that after waking up from the last batch of love-making between the two, there was a strange sense of physical calm. Some of it was still rather new to her, even as a teen were who had grown up a were. She was well aware of the fact that weres had higher libidos, and from some talks with her dad, she guessed that high libido was where humanity got the idea that weres were uncontrollable rapists when transformed, though beyond what her father had told her she really didn&#39;t study too deeply into old legends and that sort of thing.<br />
<br />
The end result had been that Spencer had really found herself unprepared for one of the facts of life that related to both growing up and were reproduction. It then meant that as she came into her first real heat cycle and in the process of growing up, she&#39;d found herself far more interested in things than the way she thought she should be and created some frustration when she recognized that something wasn&#39;t &quot;right.&quot; Thankfully, though, her father had gotten lucky enough to find a were that could scratch her &quot;itch&quot; on short notice, and that had seemed to work. Particularly as she now felt more in control of herself than she did before, though that didn&#39;t stop her from being polite and curious about the young were that had been so helpful. A good part of her mind was still relatively interested in Eric Anderson and his girlfriend, but he wasn&#39;t here and Morgan was. He&#39;d also been helpful, it would be rude to just run off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t mention it,&quot; Morgan answered as he rolled onto his side and looked to her.<br />
<br />
His voice was half eager and half nervous, as though he had much opportunity for this sort of thing and was in a way uneasy with the situation and what would come next. That puzzled Spencer a bit, as from what her parents had told her as she grew up, was that Moon Lake was pretty tolerant and open with many things related to sex. There were some things that were illegal, obviously, but it was not like some of the sorts of regulations and rules that Spencer had noticed on many of the military bases that her father was sent to over the years that seemed to make it seem like the act of sex alone was somehow wrong. In this, she&#39;d figured that Morgan likely had friends at school or in his pack that he hung out with from time to time and that that had lead more serious relationships. Yet the tone of his voice sounded as though Morgan didn&#39;t have that sort of experience.<br />
<br />
Not that Spencer really had that much room to judge. Her father&#39;s military career had taken her from point to point and often without ever running into another were. She&#39;d had some friends and even a boyfriend for a little while, though nothing super serious, mostly due to the fact that the relationships often proved brief when her father was transferred. In this, they&#39;d never really been in one place long enough for her to really form lasting friendships. And even if they did, her status as a hybrid were and with part of her own makeup being werecat, there was the potential risk that her specific were virus strand would produce the same result as if a werecat mated with a normal human male. The werecat strain of the virus would kill the human male because the werecat strain entered through the chromosomes that marked gender, and thus the XY rather than XX paring lead to major negative consequences. Spencer couldn&#39;t be sure of that, but it was possible, which made any potential serious relationship with a male normal difficult. With female normals, there would be at worst a situation were their sexuality might be changed, but that would do less damage than her strain of the were-virus killing someone. All of this meant that she really didn&#39;t have much of that sort of experience, either, and that was probably one of the things that made Eric Anderson and Julie Stovall nervous around her.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t sound all that confident,&quot; Spencer commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;You noticed, eh?&quot; Morgan gave a weak smile before lowering his ears in submission, &quot;well... with my being homeschooled... I&#39;m afraid I haven&#39;t had much chance to meet with others my age. I do fine in the summer and official pack meetings... but during the school year, when just about everyone has a tighter curfew than normal... I&#39;m kind of left on my own.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m probably not too much better,&quot; Spencer admitted, &quot;hybrid were... part werewolf, part werepanther, and part werecat... combined with my dad&#39;s military career, and I&#39;ve never had the time or &quot;safety&quot; really forge lasting relationships. In this, Moon Lake and everything about it IS rather new to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You probably did get to go to school and hang out with other kids, though, right?&quot; Morgan wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;For a while, yeah,&quot; Spencer shrugged, &quot;You don&#39;t?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really,&quot; Morgan admitted, &quot;I&#39;m home schooled and to some extent... a lot of my life is rather sheltered. I have some friends that I can see during the summer and of course at official pack meetings... but other than that... I don&#39;t see too much of what goes on outside my home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That doesn&#39;t sound right,&quot; Spencer said with a frown, &quot;Even if you&#39;re home schooled... you should have the freedom to interact with people and hang out.&quot;<br />
<br />
She had her own puzzled thoughts in relation to the younger Anderson boy and his girlfriend, but that didn&#39;t mean Spencer wasn&#39;t aware of what were the basic concepts of right and wrong. And something in what Morgan said didn&#39;t sound &quot;right&quot; to her. It was almost as if Morgan was a prisoner of his parents in a way that most people generally weren&#39;t.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... but during the school year, most of the kids I hang out with in the summer are in school,&quot; Morgan shrugged, &quot;and curfews tend to be tighter. Not much I can do about that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So... why are you home schooled?&quot; Spencer asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... my folks aren&#39;t big on the whole vaccination thing,&quot; Morgan answered, &quot;as weres... we really don&#39;t need it and felt that Moon Lake agreeing to abide by the laws regarding public schools and students being vaccinated. They found that sort of thing redundant since those diseases generally haven&#39;t been strong enough to effect weres.&quot;<br />
<br />
Spencer tilted her head to one side for a moment, &quot;being home schooled over something like that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep,&quot; Morgan shrugged, &quot;it means for most of the year I&#39;m largely left on my own... which doesn&#39;t get any better when I say the wrong thing or put my foot in my mouth.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shy, I suppose?&quot; Spencer wondered, guessing that Morgan needed to get out more, and would do better if he did so.<br />
<br />
&quot;At times,&quot; Morgan shrugged.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can fix that,&quot; Spencer mused, &quot;I&#39;ve met a couple of kids at school... they seem rather nice. We could all meet somewhere after school and have fun that way. Go exploring and pave your own path.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If they aren&#39;t too busy with their own thing,&quot; Morgan answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll be fine with it,&quot; Spencer answered, &quot;they seem pretty smart. So it&#39;s not like school is going to get in their way or anything. So... some fun and hanging out would be good. Good for them to get some exercise, good for you to meet new people...&quot; Spencer then paused before silently thinking, &quot;and good for me for other reasons...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Even that might have to take a break,&quot; Morgan commented, &quot;as the call my parents got to set this up also came in relation to a special pack meeting... I suppose to welcome you in?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably me and my dad,&quot; Spencer answered, &quot;my dad is a werewolf. My mom is a werepanther werecat hybrid.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And thus you got the exotic beauty of all three combined,&quot; Morgan gave a weak smile.<br />
<br />
Spencer smiled back as Morgan was a bit more confident with that, and to a certain extent she did like the compliment. His being homeschooled over vaccination requirements for public schools was a bit odd, in that getting them didn&#39;t hurt and weren&#39;t something that took a lot of time, but that wasn&#39;t the biggest thing that Spencer guessed at. In this, Spencer found him a bit shy that was the thing that was so hampering, but once he got over that, she was fairly sure he&#39;d make someone very happy, as he&#39;d already done a very good job helping through her first heat cycle. That was enough to give her some ideas, particularly as the driving need wasn&#39;t there anymore, though it was still a school night and she had her own curfew to see to. And a lone howl going through the woods and coming from the general direction from which Spencer had approached gave her some indication that she was expected home soon.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think that&#39;s my dad howling for me now,&quot; Spencer spoke turning one ear in the direction of the howl, the way wolves and werewolves communicated over long distances.<br />
<br />
&quot;When will I see you again?&quot; Morgan asked Spencer got up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hopefully fairly soon,&quot; Spencer answered, &quot;I&#39;ll talk with some friends I made at school and figure a plan to go hang out... if not that, then surely by whenever the pack can get its meetings in order.&quot;<br />
<br />
And with that, Spencer than made her way into the woods, easily making her way past branches and other obstacles with ease. As she looked back over her shoulder though, she saw Morgan cleaning up after their romp. The thing that gave her a bit of a smile in getting some successful social interaction that didn&#39;t come off as forced or overly flirtatious, which might have been one of the things that Eric Anderson and Julie Stovall responded to in the way they did. Though, some of it was also that Morgan also had a small smile and his tail was happily waging.</p>
