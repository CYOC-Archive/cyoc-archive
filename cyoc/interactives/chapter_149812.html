<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;What&#39;s Chad doing in this place?&quot; Bruno asked as he watched his buddy disappear into the &quot;Spa.&quot;  Immediately, after Chad entered, some muscle bound guy in spandex put a &quot;Closed&quot; sign in the window.  Bruno paced back and forth for nearly an half hour.  Finally, he got up the nerve to ring the bell.  No one came in response.  He leaned on the bell for nearly five minutes.  Then he went down the alley, and tried the door on the loading dock.  He wondered why a spa had a loading dock, but figured the business had been something else before it was a spa.  The door was locked, but Bruno noticed an open transom window above the door.  He looked back and forth to make sure no one was around.  He sprung up, caught the edge of the window, did a handstand, and lowered himself through the window, and made a perfect landing.  He grinned.  Everyone knew him as a swimmer, but he was also a gymnast.   He stopped and looked around the room he was in.  He frowned,  it appeared to be a shipping room with large animal crates, and shipping labels.  But this is a spa, not a pet store?   He walked over to the open crate waiting on the metal table. It looked like it had just been polished.  There were labels on the animal crate.  One read, &quot;CHAD- SLAVEBOY&quot; and the other read, &quot;DELIVER TO: 14 Morning Wood Drive.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning Wood Drive?&quot; Bruno said with a chuckle, then he looked back at the slave boy tag, and his expression became serious, &quot;Oh, oh.&quot;<br />
<br />
 Chad might be in serious trouble.  Bruno walked down the hallway,  He could hear voices coming from one closed room.  It was the room Chad was in.  Bruno squatted down and looked through the old style key hole. He couldn&#39;t help smiling at Chad&#39;s predicament, and his loose sweat pants were tented as he watched.  When Brendan headed toward the door, Bruno ducked into one of the nearby doors.   He waited in the darkened room, until it became mostly quiet in the next room.  Well, mostly quiet, it sounded like a fishtank pump was running.  He checked the keyhole.  Then he slipped into the room.  Chad was unconscious with major wood.  There was now a clear hose hooked up to ass that was pumping a murky white liquid into Chad&#39;s ass.  It looked like it had half a tank to go.  Bruno checked his watch, and figured Chad had a least another half hour to go, and Bruno was afraid that detaching Chad might harm him.  Besides there was a nearby file folder labeled &quot;CHAD-SLAVE BOY&quot;, and a binder labeled &quot;Care and Training of Your New Slave Boy Chad.&quot;  Bruno smiled.  He really did plan to rescue Chad, but he was curious, and if Chad had been turned into a slave boy, well Bruno should probably know what that meant and how to take care of him.<br />
<br />
The file was too technical, just measurements, and dosages, and the like.  So Bruno switched to the binder, he was on the third page, when he became alarmed.  The liquid being pumped into Chad had to the cum probiotic.  Chad would only be able to eat cum if Bruno didn&#39;t stop, and maybe reverse it.  At least halfway.  Then he&#39;d pump Chad&#39;s old intestinal flora and fauna back in, at least half of it.  Chad would become a bro with benefits.  Bruno found a flash drive in the front pocket of the binder, and pocketed it.  He assumed it was a digital version of the manual.<br />
<br />
Bruno probably should have reversed it completely, but he figured he didn&#39;t have time to pump it all out before the 3 thugs returned.  He flipped the switches on the machine, and white murky liquid started to fill its tank.  The number 2 tank was filled with murky brown liquid, and had a separate hose.  Bruno kept one eye on his watch, and one on the door.  Chad seemed out of it, but he&#39;d apparently been injected with various drugs, so that wasn&#39;t a surprise.  The white tank was over 2/3rds full, when Bruno switched it off, extracted the clear hose, and inserted the dark solid one.  He flicked on the machine.  It was faster this time, and the brown liquid was down to about a third of its tank when Bruno shut it off.  He figured, he probably still had 5 minutes to get Chad out based on the original speed of the machine.  He slapped Chad&#39;s face, but wasn&#39;t able to wake Chad.  He noticed a gurney in the corner, and undid Chad&#39;s straps.  He hoisted Chad over his shoulder in a fireman&#39;s carry, but ignored the gurney, it would be better if they thought Chad got up and walked away on his own.<br />
<br />
Bruno was tempted to take advantage of Chad&#39;s stretched hole, but he didn&#39;t want to get caught, and if Chad had really been reprogrammed, even partially as a sex slave, it would be more fun, if he asked Bruno to fuck him.  Bruno got hard just thinking about it.  Chad was hard to but it was probably because of all the stuff being pumped in and out of his ass.<br />
<br />
He made it out the door, and was halfway to the back exit, when he heard foot steps approaching, so he ducked into the nearest darkened doorway.  It turned out to be an animal crate storage cupboard.  There were at least a dozen crates.  Apparently, the spa really was a slave manufacturer.   Bruno thought about all the young men that had appeared on milk cartons in the past couple years, and wondered if they ended up like Chad. <br />
<br />
Suddenly, there was a commotion.  Brandon or Brendan raised the alarm, Chad was gone.  A lot of feet could be heard running.  More than just 3 thugs.  Bruno had an idea.  If they searched, they probably wouldn&#39;t check empty animal crates.</p>
