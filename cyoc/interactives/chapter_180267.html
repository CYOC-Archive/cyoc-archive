<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jackson stopped by to regale the guys with some more stories, but they kept giving him odd looks. And then there was Danny, sitting in the corner smirking at him like he knew some joke that Jackson just wasn&#39;t in on. So after a bit more Jackson excused himself and went in search of the bathroom to take a piss. The bathroom upstairs was locked, so he slipped into the master bedroom, looking around and heading into that bathroom. He wouldn&#39;t make a mess or anything. He stepped up to the toilet and let himself go, sighing as he drained himself.<br />
<br />
His cock felt heavier in his hand, but maybe it was still chubbed up from that BJ Gabe had given him. He smiled a little at the thought. He was even better at sucking cock than Sasha was. And it wasn&#39;t even really gay when he thought about it. It was just a mouth, not like he was fucking the guy up the ass, or playing with a cock himself. He was just getting himself sucked off.<br />
<br />
He shook his cock to get the last drops off then pulled up his pants, but he stopped as he caught his reflection in the mirror. &quot;Yo.. what the fuck?&quot; He muttered as he leaned in. His hair had receded, noticeably, and what was there was kind of thin. Jackson always knew he was going to go bald eventually. Even guy on his mother&#39;s side had some baldness, and bio class let him know he probably would follow, but he thought he had years yet. Had he just not noticed? He had always been self-conscious of his hair, using product and everything to make it as full as possible, but maybe the pool had washed it all out. And despite having shaved this morning, he had stubble on his jaw, a very noticeable five o&#39;clock shadow.<br />
<br />
Was that what all the guys had been staring at? Jackson leaned in close, and as he tilted his head down he could even see the beginnings of a bald spot a top his head. &quot;Fuuck. Maybe it&#39;s time to shave it off?&quot; He thought about it for a moment. Buff guys with bald heads was a thing, after all. And they were hot and got laid. It&#39;s not like it was the end of the world.<br />
<br />
He looked down and saw an electric trimmer on the counter. It probably belonged to Gabe&#39;s dad. Jackson had met the man once, he was a huge furball, and he wondered how that big buff guy had such a slender, smooth son. Maybe Gabe was adopted? The thought left Jackson&#39;s head as he picked up the razor and flicked it on. Without even hesitating he ran it right through the center of his head. &quot;No going back now.&quot; He did it again and again, each time taking another strip of hair off his head, shearing it down to stubble. He switched the heads and cut even that down. He&#39;d need to go over it with a razor to get it smooth, but it was gone now.<br />
<br />
Jackson grinned at himself in the mirror, running his hand over his bare scalp. It made him look so much older, but not as old as a bald spot would have. Who needed a head of hair anyway when they had muscles like Jackson fucking White? It was like he had finally broken some plateau. Rolled over from a teen and into a man. If he had to trade hair for muscles, well fuck, that was a trade he&#39;d make.<br />
<br />
He flexed for himself in the mirror then frowned, when has hid pits gotten so hairy? He shaved them, but right now they were full of short, dark stubble. The hair on his head was disappearing, but it was being a nuisance else where. And he swore he had just shaved his chest this morning, but he must have missed some, as he could see the stubble on his pecs above the low collar of his tank top. That was another thing he had always done, shaved himself smooth other than around his dick the moment hair had grown anywhere but his pubes.<br />
<br />
He picked up the trimmer to start attacking the offending stubble then remembered where he was and put it down. He could deal with that at home, its not like there were any girls around here to impress anyway. He quickly cleaned up the mess he made, and stepped out of the bathroom right into Danny Yang. A Danny Yang that for once in his life actually seemed smaller than him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jackson?&quot; Danny asked, staring up at Jackson&#39;s head.<br />
<br />
Jackson wanted to cuss out the Asian Adonis, then stopped himself. &quot;Trying a new look.&quot; He said, terse and to the point as he tried to shove past Danny in the hallway. Why did he feel guilty? This guy used to be his friend, sure, but that was over, obviously. Danny was such a pretentious fuck, completely full of himself. It had felt good to fuck his girl behind his back, bring the prick down a few rungs. But Jackson still felt guilty. Like it was some stupid bullshit that young guys did that he just didn&#39;t want to be involved with anymore. Part of him wanted his friend and workout buddy back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks good.&quot; Danny said after a moment and Jackson turned to look back at him.<br />
<br />
He opened his mouth to tell Danny to fuck off but what came out instead was, &quot;Thanks.&quot; Then. &quot;Forget about Sasha. She&#39;s a slutty bitch anyway. Fuck, I even heard she was doing Coach Meyers. Hell, I think you were the only guy at school that didn&#39;t know how much she slept around. You have your head too much in your own muscles.&quot;<br />
<br />
Danny looked away, frowning at something. &quot;Still was a fucking shitty thing to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was.&quot; Jackson admitted. &quot;But it&#39;s done.&quot; He shrugged his heavy shoulders and headed back downstairs. &quot;Move on, Danny. It&#39;s not like she&#39;s the only bimbo with big tits around here. Get over her, and yourself. You know why no one likes you, Danny? You&#39;re an arrogant prick. It&#39;s time to grow up.&quot; Where had that come from? Jackson felt like he was lecturing some wayward teen instead of talking to his old friend. He shook his head and headed back downstairs, not waiting for or wanting Danny&#39;s response.</p>
