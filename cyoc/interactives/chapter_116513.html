<br />
After Hamilton left you walked around the room multiple times as you were getting used to your new senses such as your smell, and hearing. You seemed to quickly adapt to walking on all fours, and on paws too, and you got used to moving your longer ears around your head. You couldn&#39;t get used to your tails though, and they seemed to get in the way of each other constantly, but you figured out you could move all of them in unison easily without much effort so you stuck to that.<br />
<br />
You surprisingly barely took notice to your manhood with it being both new, and life changing for you overall. You never thought you would ever actually think this either, but you felt bored just sitting in an empty room. You looked over at the dog door again thinking about leaving the room for a look around, and you were definitely curious as to what was on the other side. &quot;Other familiars...like me, but different...I don&#39;t know anything, but I can&#39;t unless I go outside. I at least want to see what some of the others are like. But I&#39;m...&quot; You thought then paused, and shook your head,&quot;I just have to find someone who&#39;s shy and new like me...hopefully.&quot; You thought to yourself.<br />
<br />
You saw the door, and hesitated before going through as you saw a number on the top of the door, and you thought that it was worth memorizing all things considered. Once you got the number memorized you took a deep breath and went through the door. You walked outside to see that you were surrounded by a small wall, and you were inside a garden of sorts on a castle in the bright daylight. You saw 4 other doors, and you were surprised that there were so little, but something else immediately caught your attention as you felt something tiny run up your leg.<br />
<br />
&quot;What in the...!&quot; You began as you saw a rat peer down into your eyes from your hear. &quot;Hi there, your the newbie aren&#39;t you. I&#39;m Scamper, or at least that&#39;s what my master says my name is, I&#39;m not so sure about it personally. Anyways who are you?&quot; The rat, Scamper said<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Glacier, why are you running around my body like that?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Just getting a feel for you, I do this to everyone here, because I&#39;m small and it&#39;s hard to get around for me, and since your door is right next to mine it won&#39;t be a hassle for you. So besides that what was life like for you before this?&quot; Scamper asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Uuuuh, do I have to answer if I feel personal about it?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you were a different gender before weren&#39;t you, that&#39;s why you&#39;re squeamish. I haven&#39;t been here 2 months yet and I&#39;ve seen it all. You aren&#39;t the first either there have been males who became female, the reverse, and everything in between...you don&#39;t want to know what that means. The point is you&#39;re not alone, and the organization here also gives us small areas so that new blood like you aren&#39;t so shy.&quot; Scamper said<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh, Well at least there&#39;s that going for me.&quot; You said looking over to see a blue dragon looking out over the edge of the castle, who seemed to be close to your size except slightly larger overall.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who&#39;s that looking off the edge?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh that&#39;s Saphire, she&#39;s been here for about a week now, and in her case she was male, and she&#39;s a bit self conscious about that. Maybe you can comfort her some considering your previous gender was what she is now.&quot; Scamper said ducking down in into your fur.<br />
<br />
You hesitated for a moment, and then walked over to Saphire and sat down near the edge. Saphire immediately took attention to you, and tilted her head sideways puzzled. &quot;Are you new?&quot; Saphire asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Literally woke up almost an hour ago, and honestly things have been...complex involving my body, but from what I know that&#39;s how things are. I&#39;m Glacier by the way, I already know yours, Saphire right?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you know that?&quot; Saphire asked taking a few steps back<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re blowing things.&quot; Scamper said emerging from your fur<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey it&#39;s not like I&#39;m hitting on her or anything.&quot; You said peering up to see Scamper<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, that explains why you made the first move, and how you knew my name.&quot; Saphire said squinting,&quot;So what did that little rat tell you?&quot; Saphire asked walking back over to you <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m right here you know, and he knows about that little secret you told me. But listen I had good reason for telling him, and he can relate to your situation...well I guess your situation in reverse.&quot; Scamper said<br />
<br />
&quot;You dirty little...wait relate in reverse? Give me a good enough reason, and maybe I won&#39;t step on you rat.&quot; Saphire growled<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...Glacier can you help me?&quot; Scamper asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually he&#39;s telling the truth I was kind of...female before this whole thing happened. And Scamp here says you were male, so I understand how you feel...sort of.&quot; You said nervous.<br />
<br />
&quot;Scamp?&quot; Scamper asked with a slight tone of annoyance in his voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...uh I didn&#39;t expect that. Huh, well I guess that&#39;s alright for both of us.&quot; Saphire said<br />
<br />
&quot;See I had good reason.&quot; Scamper said<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut it rat! You only got out unscathed because your hiding in this ones fur. Your name was Glacier right, sorry I&#39;m in an awkward situation all around here.&quot; Saphire said<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep that&#39;s me, and feel free to ask any questions you have being female.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;You can ask me about being a guy too, so I guess this makes us friends in a way.&quot; Saphire said and her eyes started glowing blue.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh crap, I have to go my master wants me for something, see you later Glacier.&quot; Saphire said entering a dog door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whew! Glad she&#39;s gone.&quot;  Scamper said<br />
<br />
&quot;You really should watch yourself around her, she could kill you if she wanted to.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I just need a good reason most of the time. I have you, and if not if she actually does than my master, and hers won&#39;t be happy.&quot; Scamper said<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I don&#39;t do fire, I have ice magic and froze myself to the ground earlier when I got mad, so I don&#39;t like fire.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I wasn&#39;t there for that part, I was watching by the way. I squeezed through a wide crack in the wall of your pen and saw most of it, but I wasn&#39;t there for that.&quot; Scamper said<br />
<br />
&quot;You spy around?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;I do it, and practice it for my Master, Fredrick, he tests me on stuff like that. Small is good for sneaking, and I assume you will probably learn magic from yours. Who&#39;s your master by the way?&quot; Scamper asked<br />
<br />
&quot;My master is Hamilton, and honestly I don&#39;t know much yet, about him I mean. He left after a brief talk, and explanation saying he had something to do.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it&#39;s best not to get caught up in stuff that doesn&#39;t involve you, especially in our position. Food should be here soon, so can you drop me off by your place?&quot; Scamper asked, and he decided to move up to your head again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, I was thinking of heading back myself, what time of day is it by the way?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d say early afternoon, we familiars usually have more time late afternoon, early evening time area, so the other two should be out then.&quot; Scamper said<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, I&#39;ll see if I can come back out then.&quot; You said approaching your door, and Scamper made his way down your leg, and onto the ground again. &quot;Thanks Glacier, and see you around later. You&#39;re going to fit in nicely.&quot; Scamper said as he scurried over to a dog door, and squeezed his tiny body through.<br />
<br />
&quot;I sure hope so Scamper, I really do.&quot; You muttered as you entered into your room. When you were back inside your room you looked around once again and thought,&quot;Welcome home...I guess it&#39;s all right.&quot; You saw two dog bowls beside the door Hamilton left through. One bowl had water inside of it, and the other had chopped up pieces of meat that appeared to be cooked.<br />
<br />
You paused for a second and looked at the two bowls then gave in to hunger as you haven&#39;t eaten since you woke up, and you wondered how long you were knocked out. Nonetheless you were happy that you were starting to fit in, even though you still feel kind of miserable about being what you were. Once you finished you walked over to your bed and lied down inside, and stared at the door as you waited for your master, Hamilton to return. When...</p>
