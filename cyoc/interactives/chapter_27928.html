<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tammia hadn't just change the two guards' gender and upgraded their magic <br />
status, both now sported a second pair of arms! All of them brandishing a <br />
wicked looking scimitar!  Tammia hadn't bothered to alter their attire when she <br />
'upgraded' them, thus the new vixens were attired in just loincloths and sword <br />
belts (now with three extra holders for their weapons).<br />
<br />
This might have thrown off Vicki and the others, but the nine vixen had been <br />
female for so long that seeing a naked female body in of itself rose no <br />
reaction out of them other than how a male would react to see another male <br />
naked, a slight feeling of alarm and revolution. <br />
<br />
Keiko wondered if this meant they themselves could now all be considered <br />
gay. Then again, since they were all currently female, Keiko managed to <br />
reason that technically they were all still straight (well, she jumped to the <br />
conclusion as such, being Karther's loyal sex toy she hadn't really talked that <br />
much with her fellow slaves.). <br />
<br />
Luna didn't waste time wondering about such things at the moment. All she <br />
knew was that two heavily armed (ugh) people were coming at them and <br />
were brainwashed just like everyone else in this castle. But that didn't mean <br />
that being cut to pieces by them would be any less lethal! <br />
While 'T' had restored their free will and Ego, the vixens still had the combat <br />
knowledge in their heads that Karther had given when he changed them into <br />
weapons to try and kill 'T' for daring to interfere with his fun and games of <br />
stealing people from their lives and making them his little dollies to play with. <br />
Thus, Luna proved to be very good with the spear she was holding deflecting <br />
the four sword trusts directed at her beating heart. <br />
<br />
Vicki didn't remember Karther having any female fighters, men were for work, <br />
girls were for pleasure in Karther's mind. But something about them was <br />
familiar. &quot;Robert? Gene? That you?&quot; Vicki asked, having been with Karther <br />
long enough to remember the names of his other work hands. <br />
The two Shiva like vixens didn't respond, just mutely continued their attack. <br />
Vicki wondered if this had been a quick fix transformation that had left their <br />
minds in pieces, leaving behind all the reasoning skills of a machine. <br />
<br />
Thankfully there were still nine of them and only two of the Shiva guards. But <br />
Vicki wondered how long that was going to last. Luna was continuously being <br />
forced to retreat or back up, the shiva vixens were like walking sushi <br />
machines. Trying to get a hit in would reduce whoever tried to bloody chunks! <br />
That was when another of her sisters (she had thought of them like that for so <br />
long it was hard to think of them as otherwise), Lucy, stabbed the halberd <br />
Karther had given her into the floor and used it as a vault to get in a flying kick <br />
right at one of the Shiva vixen's heads knocking it on it's back and putting <br />
them between the rest of the group and Lucy. <br />
Luna took advantage of the relief and jabbed at the other Shiva vixen's side. <br />
The fallen Shiva vixen however stabbed all four of it's swords in the ground <br />
then double kicked Luna back into her sisters, given the shiva vixen time to <br />
stand back up. <br />
Luna cursed, if this hallway was wider then they could make better use of their <br />
numbers! As it was only about three of them could face the shiva vixens at the <br />
same time. <br />
Vicki held the cross around her neck T gave her, wondering what she feared <br />
more, dying in a place no one would ever mourn her passing, or becoming <br />
Karther little toy again. Both outcomes made her shudder. <br />
<br />
+++<br />
<br />
Alexsandra had served Karther for as far back as she could remember, true <br />
that wasn't more than a year or two, but that didn't matter. She existed for the <br />
sole purpose of serving her master, nothing else mattered in the slightest! It <br />
was her meaning, her reason for living! She had felt something happen to her <br />
master. While the other foxes in the castles were content to go about as they <br />
were -programmed- to do, Alexsandra, either due to an idiosyncrasy in her <br />
brainwashing, or maybe some actual emotion that had somehow evolved <br />
from Karther treating her like an actual sentient being, had decided to seek <br />
her master out. Most of the foxes didn't question her, the ones that did she <br />
simply lied and said had been called to her master's presence, which wasn't a <br />
complete lie to her she rationalized. Having been a slave to Karther for so <br />
long, maybe even longer than Vicki, Alexsandra was fairy able to navigate the <br />
castle's changing shape. However, she felt something else, it felt like her <br />
master's power, the one that had always been at the back of her brain telling <br />
her that everything was all right, seem to be gone, this made her almost panic! <br />
Was the master gone? Hurt? Alexsandra's search became all the more frantic. <br />
<br />
+++<br />
<br />
One moment they were fighting Tammia, the next they were back home <br />
watching foot ball. The image shattered a second later.<br />
&quot;You can't use illusions on a brain with two minds.&quot; Tabra said matter of fact. <br />
&quot;You want to screw with our brain you're going to have try a lot harder!&quot; <br />
Though honestly if the angel fox hadn't been of two minds, she could have <br />
been easily trapped in that illusion totally unaware of the untruth of it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Tabra.&quot; Janice asked as they dodged a direct energy blast from Tammia. &quot;I <br />
need to know, if we did what you said would happen. Become one person, <br />
would we be strong enough to save Tammy?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I refuse. I won't let that happen until we've been stuck together so long we <br />
can't stop it. And if we forced it, the new person who'd exist because of our <br />
merging would be mentally unstable because we had -forced- the fusion <br />
along. Why do you think most collective intelligences are so insane? Oh right, <br />
you wouldn't. Sorry.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Then what choice do we have?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tammia may have taken her master's power, but that doesn't mean she <br />
knows fully how to use it or handle it. All her magical knowledge was <br />
implanted in her, not learned, and that always leaves holes. And you can't be <br />
-given- skill, she's can't use the huge amount of magical power she has to it's <br />
full potential!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess that's some good news.&quot; <br />
<br />
Another spell blast, this one that -curved- as they dodged, knocked into the <br />
angel fox, and she sent into a wall. The angel fox blasted it to glass, which <br />
was positively useless for Karther's stolen magic to animate. <br />
The angel fox saw that the blast that atomized their jeans and shirt. <br />
<br />
The Tabra half of her said, &quot;Mental note, next time you chose something wear, <br />
picking something that can take a lot more punishment, it's distracting with <br />
these things swinging around during a life or death fight!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me! I haven't had a chance to life a normal life as a fox girl and I hope <br />
I never do!&quot; The Janice half of her retorted. <br />
<br />
&quot;You might change your tune if your only other option is to be Karther's toy <br />
again!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't let that happen! Tammy! Please remember! We're supposed to be <br />
guys! Not foxes! Not queens or angels! Just two ordinary male humans! Don't <br />
do this!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;It is your mind that is confused and clouded my other body, we'll have to <br />
correct that one way or another!&quot; Tammia replied tries to lower the castle <br />
ceiling right on top of the angel fox, a blast sphere of holy light turned it all into <br />
useless sand. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh!&quot; Janice moaned holding her head. &quot;Do those always give us such a <br />
headache?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, somethings they give us an even -worse- headache!&quot; Tabra returned. <br />
&quot;Which is why I really hate doing them!&quot; <br />
<br />
Tammia declared. &quot;Come back to me my other body so we may serve our lord <br />
as we always have!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She's crazy!&quot; Janice gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Her brain washing, combined with the magic Karther gave her, on top of what <br />
she took from him, is seriously rewriting her awareness and thinking process. <br />
Just pray <br />
<br />
&quot;I don't pray! I do!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You'd be surprised how closely related they can be some times! Mind on the <br />
fight!&quot; Tabra yelped, smashing some sand stone hands that rose out of the <br />
ground. &quot;This is pointless, we need to lure her outside of the castle.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Isn't it all just sand out there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A machine is useless outside the power grid. Once outside the castle she <br />
won't be able to animate the sand anymore!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Best idea we have I guess!&quot; Janice muttered. A dart of shot from the angel <br />
fox's wings and stuck Tammia in the gut, drawing blood. <br />
<br />
&quot;You'd hurt your own body?&quot; Tammia said confused. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come and catch me!&quot; Said the angel fox backing off, baiting Tammia, and it <br />
was working. <br />
<br />
&quot;So what should we call ourself when we become one person?&quot; Janice <br />
asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Drop it.&quot; Tabra retorted. <br />
<br />
Tammia meanwhile, the magic continuing to change her, enabled her to grow <br />
six tails, the max her current magic level could allow without her body <br />
becoming magically unstable.</p>
