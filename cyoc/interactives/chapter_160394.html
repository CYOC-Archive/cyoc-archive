<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kendall had heard from Yolanda in a bit of gossip that after Connor and Allen had stayed over at her place after a long night of partying, so she was headed off to his place - thinking by now he might be home and in need of a check up. She swore, with how he acted some times, she worried he&#39;d drive drunk some night and get destroyed on the road or something. She quietly opened the door just in time to hear a feminine cry of pleasure from the living room. Her mind raced to the immediate conclusion, but she didn&#39;t hear Connor&#39;s grunting or groans, and then her mind went to the next conclusion.<br />
<br />
A look of horror crossed her face as she crept, inch by inch, into the house. She had never felt so scared by just these noises in her life. She had never felt so much like an invader. An intruder. She looked into the living room and saw it. Connor...now turned into a woman again, laying there pleasuring him/herself.<br />
<br />
Was this Josie and Jenna&#39;s doing? Was there someone else at school who by some alchemy acquired the Chronivac and took out there problems on him? When Kendall saw Connor changing position, she frantically hid herself in the hallway. Her eyes darting from the scene playing out, to the door, and then to the whole area out there. She was seeing it happen again. She was seeing her Connor vanishing before her.<br />
<br />
Some rather more clueless individuals might ask; why not just love Connor as he is now? Why not just have sex with a woman? And that was a clueless request. Sexuality, especially Kendall&#39;s, did not work that way. She wasn&#39;t so flexible she could just...deal with this as if it was no small change.<br />
<br />
Kendall, choking down an emotional reaction so as to avoid alerting Connor, hurried out the door and unwittingly slammed it shut behind her. She was frantic with her phone, trying to get into contact with Josie. She had a lot of peoples&#39; numbers, and along the way she&#39;d managed to get Josie&#39;s. She had no idea what she was expecting...<br />
<br />
&quot;Josie, this had BETTER not be your doing.&quot; Kendall said into the phone as it was picked up by Josie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kendall?&quot; She started, and then realized something from the tone, &quot;Oh...oh God, it must seem like---it&#39;s---you have to understand. Connor asked for this to be done. She wasn&#39;t happy as a male. She wanted to---&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;CUT! IT! OUT!&quot; Kendall didn&#39;t even realize she was crying into the phone when she screamed her response, &quot;Cut it out. He&#39;s not...He&#39;s not...&quot; Since when was she ever going to cry over losing him? Him? She collapsed on to her knees, &quot;This can&#39;t be happening. This...this is a nightmare. A nightmare. And I&#39;ll wake up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not a nightmare, Kendall. It&#39;s something you just need to accept. Things like this...they happen.&quot; Josie said in an attempt at conciliation, &quot;If you love Connor you&#39;ll accept her for who she is now.&quot;<br />
<br />
The phone clattered across the ground, ending the call along the way. Kendall stood there, covered in a cold sweat, shaking and shivering with a combination of rage and hurt. She had been betrayed by Connor, who was enabled by Josie and Jenna, and now she was going to be cut off of her plan, and everything she built her life toward was in one day destroyed.<br />
<br />
She lost a boyfriend she never knew how much she appreciated...<br />
<br />
She was going to be alone at the top.<br />
<br />
And then she heard her phone start ringing. She walked over to it, slowly, and examined the number. It was...not Josie. In fact, she had never seen this number before. It had an extension number she wasn&#39;t familiar with at all, and there was something odd about the exact numbers. 976...something or other. She picked up the phone, and noted the scratches and breakage from her fit, wincing. But again, she was well to do, and so could get a new one at a moment&#39;s notice.<br />
<br />
Answering the number after some hesitation, Kendall heard a scratchy, somewhat raspy deep voice on the other end, &quot;I take it you are displeased with the results of our product?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your product!?&quot; She almost exploded, and calmed down, &quot;Are you saying...the Chronivac is your...product?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes.&quot; The voice on the other end stated, &quot;After its inventor met with his tragic fate, it passed into my capable hands. And I keep an eye on everyone who is affected by it. Including you, Kendall.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your &quot;product&quot; has---&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Changed things up quite significantly?&quot; A few hoarse laughs at the other end, &quot;Such is what happens. The Chronivac is made to do this, after all. This is what it&#39;s always done.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what?&quot; Kendall asked, quite simply feeling done, &quot;Did you call me to gloat? To tell me I need to accept this and move on? That reality itself is just going to adapt and make me quietly accept the new way of---&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohh no no, my sweet little cheerleader. Not at all. Accepting how things are is a losing path right now.&quot; The voice took on a certain edge to it, and a sickly little chuckle emanated, &quot;I&#39;m going to even the playing field a bit. Give YOU a Chronivac with which to play.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kendall paused, and then the phone shut off. When she looked at her phone again, all the extraneous damage from earlier was fixed. Her eyes widened, and she gasped when she saw a spot that had been empty on the App Screen now had the Chronivac Logo listed there...with Chronivac 7.0 underneath it. How had he---? She was still not sure this wasn&#39;t all some sort of sordid nightmare.<br />
<br />
But she couldn&#39;t help herself. Loading it up, she saw the calming interconnected blue squares take up the phone screen. Was this what Josie and Jenna had...? It loaded up and showed a picture of herself, making her wince at the nude model. She looked through the options, and saw that Connor was in here...<br />
<br />
Loading his profile showed Kendall an image of the woman that had been in Connor&#39;s house. This drew a scowl to her face. The machine read out the data, saying his biological gender was Female, and apparently he had been &quot;Transgender&quot;. Had they secretly added that bit? Jenna and Josie... Kendall looked down and then at the Chronivac.<br />
<br />
She had a very obvious choice before her here. And whatever was the difference between her Chronivac and theirs, she just had to trust that this would work. That this was going to help. Help...them. Yes, she rationalized. She needed to do this for THEM BOTH. Kendall started looking and saw it could access Connor&#39;s past forms. Clicking to his male form, Kendall saw some other options - and decided to improve him a little bit too.<br />
<br />
Add a bit of size to his manhood, give him 10 more lbs of muscle... and she saw it. Mental changes were in here too. She could fix the &quot;damages&quot; done to Connor&#39;s mind. A few clicks on there, and she had added &quot;return to male mindset&quot; added to the list of changes. She gulped, and then waved off her reservations - altering Connor&#39;s mind further. She knew what she was doing transgressed on his choices as she added more mental changes. More and more, all designed to make Connor as he was - and just to keep things from escalating again, she went as far as easing him up on the socially maladjusted and inept.<br />
<br />
It was like playing God. A sickening feeling in her stomach.<br />
<br />
Kendall clicked through the timer. She could go as far as setting how long it would take for all these changes to commence. And she selected one second. Clicking through some other options, she made it so Connor wouldn&#39;t be aware he was being changed, and that the world outside of her would remember none of this. Just so she could keep a watchful eye.<br />
<br />
Her finger hovered over the &quot;Induce Changes?&quot; button. The bright blue little button hardly looked sinister, but now she looked at this, it felt like she was accepting a deal with the devil somehow. She had not bargained her soul, she had not offered it flesh nor blood, but she was left with a sick feeling.<br />
<br />
Before she could reconsider, she quickly pressed the button. She half expected a torrent of energy to pour out of the Chronivac App, to see or feel something tremendous or terrifying...but she felt nothing. She could not detect any sort of activity happening. It just said after a second that changes were completed. She looked around, half expecting to feel immediately judged or cast down...but she supposed she&#39;d gotten used to such a paranormal state of things it would not have surprised her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m...I&#39;m such a nervous wreck now...&quot; Kendall murmured and then headed to Connor&#39;s house to check and see if it worked.<br />
<br />
Entering the house, she didn&#39;t hear the sound of a woman pleasing herself, and instead heard the slightly more chaste sounds of Connor exercising. She entered the living room to see her boyfriend doing push ups on the floor, shirtless, and then he noticed her and got up with a smile, &quot;Hey babe! I was missing you. You know, I was thinking we never seem to really DO anything together. We just hang out at school, fuck like rabbits...not like there&#39;s a problem with that, and we don&#39;t go on dates any more.&quot;<br />
<br />
He walked over to her and Kendall&#39;s eyes widened as she looked around.<br />
<br />
Connor hugged her tight, and Kendall just stared right on past him. She was grateful she had gotten him back, but she did so by overwriting his wishes with her own. And despite the fact she should have oh so enjoyed that so very much, she couldn&#39;t enjoy it. And she was having trouble figuring out why. Why that was...<br />
<br />
&quot;How...how about we go do Japanese food at that c-charming new sushi restaurant?&quot; She offered, still standing there awkwardly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing, babe. You know I love new food.&quot; And with that Connor went upstairs to go get everything ready for a date. Kendall just stood there for a minute.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; she whispered as she realized why she wasn&#39;t enjoying this as much as she thought she would, &quot;it&#39;s...it&#39;s because I&#39;m horrible.&quot; She looked down and then up at the ceiling, hearing Connor moving around up there. She just stood there, waiting, until Connor came back downstairs in a polo shirt and jeans now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ready to go, babe!&quot; He said with an eager smile on his face.<br />
<br />
And Kendall for her part just walked along with him. She smiled, well, she tried to. She was going out to a date and dinner with Connor, and everything SEEMED to be resolved. So why was she feeling so distinctly like she&#39;d lost something she never knew she had? She got into his car with him and headed out, resting her head on his broad shoulder.<br />
<br />
Why, she asked herself, is this so complicated? Why do I feel so...bad, doing this?<br />
<br />
She managed to temporarily dismiss her concerns and happily smirk as she and Connor arrived in short order at the high end Japanese place. Kendall clenched her hand around her phone in her pocket.</p>
