<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“why arent u at school right now?”, Mackenzie asked.<br />
<br />
Crap. Had that much time passed already? The clock at the top of Kelsey’s vision told her that it was now 8:15. Time flies when you’re trying to understand the body horror you’ve just been thrust into.<br />
<br />
Typing out a response on her keyboard was as easy as speaking the words aloud. “mackenzie i need help. can you please come over to my house? im in the bedroom and i cant get up.” She wasn’t sure how to explain the rest. Maybe she was wrong and there <i>was</i> some other explanation for everything she’d experienced up to this point, but she’d need someone else to look her over to be sure. Her parents must have already left for work by now, and she wasn’t sure she wanted them to find her like this anyway. A friend like Mackenzie, on the other hand, she figured she could trust.<br />
<br />
It didn’t take much convincing, either, to get Mackenzie to skip her first-period English class - even if the girl was totally confused as to why she needed to do this. Now all Kelsey had to do was wait. She flipped her camera back on and watched the bedroom ceiling, her mind wandering through unanswerable questions like what she was going to do when “help” actually arrived. It was only a matter of minutes before her microphones picked up the distant, muffled sound of Mackenzie’s voice. “Kelsey?”, she shouted. “Where are you?”<br />
<br />
“im in my bedroom,” Kelsey texted in reply. She heard Mackenzie stomp through the hallway, wondering out loud, “She can hear me, but she can’t say anything?”, as the voice grew closer. Soon Mackenzie’s face appeared in the field of the camera view, looming over her and wearing a baffled expression. “This is definitely her bedroom...”, she muttered to herself. “And there’s her phone on the nightstand. So where did she go?”<br />
<br />
Kelsey quickly typed out, “im here!!! im in the phone!” and hit send. She heard the expected pinging sound that came from Mackenzie’s purse an instant later, proving that the message had been received. But Mackenzie didn’t need to glance at her screen to see it. She was watching, her mouth hanging open, as the phone in front of her seemed to type out the message by itself. “Kelsey?”, she asked, shocked. “Is that... you?”<br />
<br />
Before Kelsey could finish typing out “yes!!!”, she watched with sudden dread through the camera lens as her friend leaned in closer and closer until her face nearly filled the limited view, followed by a well-manicured hand reaching out. Kelsey abruptly felt herself being lifted into the air, a soft, warm, flat surface wrapping around her back that could only have been Mackenzie’s seemingly giant hand. Whatever doubts she had left about the nature of her strange new existence were gone. The phone wasn’t just entrapping her consciousness, it had also somehow become her physical body, inside and out. She nearly started typing “hey, put me down!”, but quickly realized that being held wasn’t a terrible feeling. It was better than lying helplessly on a nightstand, at least.<br />
<br />
Kelsey had been interrupted in her thoughts by the unexpected sensation of being hand-held, but she soon regained her composure. “i dont know how this happened”, she typed, well aware that Mackenzie was watching every keystroke she made, rather than looking at her own phone to receive the message. “i just woke up this morning and i was in the phone!”<br />
<br />
Mackenzie just stared, her eyes wide and frightened, as she tried to make sense of what she was witnessing. When it sunk in that the device she was holding in her palm actually <i>was</i> her friend, she jerked back in alarm, her grip loosening as if she had just discovered a spider crawling up her wrist. But she realized a split second later that she absolutely shouldn’t drop Kelsey and potentially break her, and she held the phone more confidently again. The next words came very slowly from her lips. “Do you realize that you’re about to die?”<br />
<br />
“what??!?!”, Kelsey replied one letter and punctuation mark at a time.<br />
<br />
“Oh, crap, no no no, I mean like how a phone dies? Like, you’re running really low on battery. You’re at like 5%.”<br />
<br />
“oh.” The text conversation was starting to look very strange and one-sided as it appeared on the screen, Kelsey being the only one who needed to send messages to communicate right now. Of all the nights for her to forget to put her phone on the charger before bed... Well, this certainly wasn’t the first time she’d made <i>that</i> mistake, thinking of the times her phone had annoyingly run out of juice in the middle of a school day. But the thought of running out of battery was much more existentially worrying now. What would happen to her mind? Would it be like going to sleep? Would her personality even persist after being shut off and restarted? She didn’t want to find out.<br />
<br />
And she wouldn’t have to. Mackenzie quickly found the dangling charger cord beside Kelsey’s unmade bed, and it didn’t occur to her to ask for permission before putting it in.<br />
<br />
Kelsey, for her part, didn’t see it coming. One moment she was trying to decide what to type next, and then everything changed. When she felt something pressing against her lower opening, she thought of it as her vagina before she realized it was her charging port. Not only was it in the same general location on her reshaped body, but it wasn’t any less sensitive than it had been when it was flesh. And while she had experience sticking something electric up there, she’d never had the electricity actually flow <i>into</i> her before. Nor did the penetrating male end fit so perfectly and snugly into her hole before, snapping into place with a gentle <i>click</i> that told her it would be stuck in there until it was deliberately pulled out... by someone with hands.<br />
<br />
The flow of electricity through her charging port and across the length of her body was incredible. Not orgasmic, exactly, but a feeling so warm and pleasurable that it had sort of replaced sexuality in her inorganic body. It was, at the same time, her new form of sustenance, providing all the energy she needed to keep herself alive. Maybe if the charging port were on the top of her rectangular body, she would’ve thought of it as a mouth instead of a vagina. But either way, she didn’t want it to stop. She <i>needed</i> that penetration to continue until her battery was full of juice.<br />
<br />
“Kelsey?”, Mackenzie asked a minute later. “You’re still in there, right?”<br />
<br />
“yes”, Kelsey wrote, the words snapping her back to reality even as her whole body felt flushed and heated. “still here.”<br />
<br />
“Well, I’m glad I could help you with... whatever this is,” Mackenzie said politely. “But I do need to get back to school before too much longer. You know how I feel about English class, but I’ve got a big test second period that I can’t miss. Do you... want me to take you with? Or should I just put you back down now that you’re on the charger?”</p>
