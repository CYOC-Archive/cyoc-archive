<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I think I know what I want to wish for!&quot; Mike exclaimed as he typed into his phone. As he finished, Taylor looked at his phone to see what he put in. &quot;I wish for a younger brother... I didn&#39;t know you wanted a brother.&quot; &quot;Well I AM an only child and you DO have a younger brother, so of course I would want to know what it&#39;s like.&quot; &quot;Well go for it!&quot; Taylor didn&#39;t feel the need to tell Mike his younger brother is a pain in the butt. Besides, nothing was going to happen after all. &quot;Well here goes nothing!&quot; Mike pressed enter and another screen appeared saying the wish would be granted in 10 seconds with a countdown to match. &quot;You think we&#39;ll get your younger brother in the mail? lol.&quot; Taylor joked. &quot;Yeah, and it will come from the stork too!&quot; A few more seconds passed as the two joked with each other and then the timer hit zero.<br />
<br />
A bright light flowed forth from the phone. &quot;Ah!&quot; &quot;Ah!&quot; Mike and Taylor covered their eyes. The light slowly faded away as the two boys readjusted their eyesight. &quot;That was annoying,&quot; Taylor said as he picked up Mike&#39;s phone and handed it back to him. &quot;Yeah...&quot; Mike looked back at his phone. &quot;It says my wish has been granted.&quot; Mike and Taylor looked around the room. Nothing seemed different and there was no one coming to the door either. &quot;I guess nothing happened after all,&quot; Mike finally said. &quot;Told you it was a scam.&quot; <br />
<br />
Taylor got up to walk back to his own phone. And as soon as he did, he noticed something was off. He looked down and noticed his socks were loose on his feet. Thinking, they slightly slid off from the flash, he bent down to readjust them, but they scrunched further up his ankles. It was like his feet were too small. &quot;That&#39;s weird.&quot; &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Mike asked as he got up to check on Taylor. &quot;My socks don&#39;t fit all of the sudden and...&quot; Taylor stopped mid sentence  as he started at Mike. &quot;What?&quot; Mike asked, confused as to why Taylor was staring at him. &quot;Um... Am I going crazy or do you look taller?&quot; &quot;Huh? I don&#39;t know what you...&quot; It was Mike&#39;s turn to stop mid sentence. Now that he mentioned it, he could see the very top of Taylor&#39;s head standing up. But that wasn&#39;t all. Taylor&#39;s hair looked shorter then it had before. &quot;Umm... you look different too Taylor. Are you getting smaller?&quot; &quot;Huh, no it can&#39;t be. I...&quot; Taylor looked around and saw that he wasn&#39;t eye level to the things in the house thathe was before. &quot;No way! This is...&quot; Taylor looked back at Mike. He looked different once again. &quot;I think you&#39;re growing, Mike!&quot; &quot;And you&#39;re shrinking Taylor!&quot; <br />
<br />
Both boys looked down at their bodies. Taylor saw his pants start to hang loose and his T-shirt was starting to get baggier on him. His socks were even more loose then they were before. Mike could feel his clothes tightening on his body. Looking down more, he could see the ground move down from his vision just as his big toes tore holes through his tight socks. &quot;Mike?! What&#39;s happening to us?!&quot; Taylor asked in a panic. His voice sounded higher then  usual. &quot;I don&#39;t know! I don&#39;t... Ohh.&quot; Mike suddenly pressed down on his stomach. &quot;What&#39;s wrong?!&quot; Taylor still panicking asked his friend. &quot;Ohh... Taylor... My pee-pee feels funny! Ugh!&quot; Taylor looked down at his friend&#39;s crotch to see a huge bulge in Mike&#39;s shorts. &quot;Ohh... Taylor... Taylor!&quot; Before either could figure out what was wrong, the bulge shook several times as a wet spot formed in Mike&#39;s pants. &quot;Ohh... Ugh! Guh!&quot; &quot;No way!&quot; After a few more seconds, the shaking calmed down. <br />
<br />
&quot;What just happened?&quot; Mike wondered. &quot;Why did I wet myself?!&quot; Taylor simply looked at his confused best friend. He looked much more different now. His face was more rugged and less baby faced and some hair was growing on his upper lip. &quot;Uh... Take down your pants.&quot; Taylor asked. &quot;What?! No, I don&#39;t want you to see my wiener!&quot; &quot;Just do it Mike!&quot; Taylor yelled as his pants fell off his waist. &quot;Ah! Okay, okay!&quot; Mike did as he was told and with some difficulty, pulled down his pants and underwear. What the two boys saw shook them to their core. Starting at them was Mike&#39;s penis, no longer that of a little boy. It must have been eight inches long at least, and thick as a can. Hair was covering his balls at a rapid rate. As they continued to stare at Mike&#39;s packages, Taylor felt his underwear fall. With some trepidation, he lifted up his too long shirt and stared at his own penis. &quot;No way...&quot; Taylor&#39;s penis was still small, but much too small for a boy his age. In fact, it hadn&#39;t been that short since he was eight. Both boys said nothing as they frantically pulled off the rest of their clothes (Mike&#39;s socks were already ripped completely). <br />
<br />
&quot;Ahhhh!!&quot; They both yelled out as they started at each other. Mike was huge. In addition to his already huge penis, his entire upper body was completely bigger. His pectoral muscles jutted out and hardened, a small six pack of abs was slowly forming across his stomach. His arms and leg muscles were huge and still growing. And his body was now covered in hair. He looked no older than  18 years old. Taylor was much smaller and still shrinking. His body was all scrawny. Whatever musculature he had was now gone. Mike watched as he continued to shrink. He looked no younger than six, no five.<br />
<br />
&quot;Taylor!&quot; Mike said in a much deeper voice. &quot;I&#39;m scared!&quot; &quot;Muh... Me too! Ahh!&quot; Taylor held his throat as a much younger voice came out from it. &quot;What&#39;s happening to me?! To us?&quot; Taylor cried out. &quot;I don&#39;t know! I...&quot; Mike looked around as now the entire house started to change. All of Mike&#39;s things were being replaced with stuff much more fitting for an older man. And that wasn&#39;t all. Things that he hadn&#39;t seen since he was even more younger started appearing again. If he had to guess, it was things for a child of very young age. Less then five at least. Family portraits changed, Mike was replaced with an older man and one that looked almost like him now, but another kid was entering the picture on his mother&#39;s lap. He looked back at Taylor. &quot;What?!&quot; Taylor asked. He looked like a four year old now. &quot;Ummm...&quot; Mike went back towards his phone, his feet growing at he took each step. Picking up his phone, he looked at his contacts and next to Taylor, he saw... &quot;Oh crud!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?!&quot; &quot;Holy cow! It my wish, Taylor!&quot; &quot;What do you mean?!&quot; Taylor asked. He walked up to his huge friend, no older than 20. He looked at the phone and under his name it said... &quot;Younger... Brother?!&quot; &quot;Yeah! It my wish! I wished for a younger brother and its you!&quot; &quot;But that&#39;s... No! Why am I getting younger then?! &quot;I don&#39;t know! Maybe I&#39;m getting more years from you or something?&quot; &quot;I... I...&quot; Taylor could say nothing as his de-aging took its course. His arms, legs and feet were all stubby, like a three year old. Mike was his opposite. He must have been 21 at least. His painfully erect dick continued to hang over Taylor. &quot;No! I hate this! I don&#39;t wanna be a baby!&quot; As he got even younger, Taylor could feel himself losing faculties he had learned over the years. His bladder felt full even though he peed several minutes ago and his stomach felt awful. &quot;Ohh... My tummy!&quot; Taylor clutched his stomach this time, but he wasn&#39;t getting his first erection. His stomach loosened up in his shrinking body as he pooped onto the floor. &quot;Ah...Ahh!&quot; Taylor started to cry. He couldn&#39;t control himself. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Taylor... I&#39;m so sorry... Ah.... OH!&quot; Mike&#39;s dick shook again as he ejaculated once more. &quot;Woah!&quot; Taylor stumbled back. He was able to dodge the cum, but he fell on his butt triggering his bladder as he now relieved himself of his urine onto the living room floor. &quot;This sucks!&quot; was all Taylor could say as he let nature take it course. As he finished peeing, his body stopped shrinking at two years old. &quot;Dude...&quot; was all Mike could say as he stopped growing in return at 22 years old.</p>
