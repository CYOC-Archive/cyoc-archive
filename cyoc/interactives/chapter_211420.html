<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As he was trotting along, he was beginning to somewhat enjoy the new scenery. At least, as much as he could &quot;enjoy&quot; anything. He was still stuck as a donkey. But at least this was different from that field he was stuck in. And the fresh smells!  He began to understand why animals such as dogs, have such short attention spans, as they wanted to sniff everything. All these different flavors of smells he had no idea that existed out in the world around him! There were as many different varieties of things to sniff, as there were colors to see for humans. <br />
<br />
Jeff had to try to keep his mind focused. He was on a mission, and had to keep moving forward. At least he was beginning to become accustomed to the sounds of his hooves on hard road surfaces. And the fact that he had hooves. But that was only temporary. As long as he walking/trotting along, he didnt mind not having hands or an upright gait. <br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t take long before Jeff came to yet another crossroads. A T-intersection. The road he was on, was just some little-used back country road. The road he found, was a little bigger. Like a back country two-lane highway. There sign posts ahead that Jeff couldn&#39;t quite make out. <br />
<br />
He approached the sign posts. A numbered highway, with directions to two different towns. This was when Jeff found out something new about himself in this state. Some quite terrifying:<br />
<br />
He found.....he couldn&#39;t read! That&#39;s right. At first, Jeff thought it was due to his bleary vision. He got as close to one of the signs he could. He still couldn&#39;t make out the letters! They just like Russian letters to him or something! No matter how much he tried looking at them, they just wouldn&#39;t resolve in his mind into a useable language! <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, fuck!&quot; he eventually thought with dread as he saw a lonely general store several dozens of feet down the small highway road. The sign above the store was in perfectly painted large print, and in perfectly contrasting black and yellow colors. Jeff stood there with growing trepidation. <br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t fucking read that!&quot; He thought, with the follow-up thought: &quot;donkeys have no need to be able to read, just like they have no need for....hands....&quot;Did that chronivac switch me with a random ass donkey in RUSSIA!?&quot; he thought, &quot;just to force me to live like an actual donkey who can&#39;t read or understand speech!?&quot;<br />
<br />
He thought for a second he would just walk into that store and ask for help for directions. But almost as soon as he thought of that, he also knew he couldn&#39;t talk and that he was still a god damn filthy donkey! <br />
<br />
&quot;Heee hhaaww!&quot; He blurted out, just to make sure. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck me! I can&#39;t read! I can&#39;t talk! I can&#39;t write! What the hell am I supposed to do!?&quot; He was oggling his donkey-shaped body stretching out behind his vision.<br />
<br />
 &quot;A fucking donkey,&quot; he thought. &quot;The useless body of a fucking donkey! Why the hell did I ever want to switch positions with a fucking donkey in the first place!?&quot;<br />
<br />
He was starting to get hard again at the thoughts of his impossible situation. He looked at the big black terrifying one-eyed monster that was ever-present below him. The way it looked, and feeling it hanging and bobbing down there as a part of him, was both terrifying and exhilarating at the same time. Just like being stuck without hands or speech.<br />
<br />
 &quot;That&#39;s why,&quot; he thought. &quot;To fulfill the sexual fantasy of being forced to live like this! All of this, just for a few moments of sexual pleasure!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff could just stand around in the middle of this road day or until he gets struck by a vehicle. Or he could proceed with the journey he had begun. Huffing in frustration, Jeff decided to proceed. But first.....<br />
<br />
He spotted a big truck with big mirrors in the small parking lot on the side of this general store. The truck was a bobtail semi without a trailer. It was an older model, clearly heavily used. Some rust spots, even.<br />
<br />
Jeff could normally clearly and easily see most of his body at any given moment this entire time. He could also sorta &quot;see&quot; his long snout extending out from his face; mostly as a big blind spot in his vision. It was mostly more less just a long shadow right there. But he&#39;s never yet had the opportunity to actually check out his head and face. To see what he looked like. He was also still sporting the massive hardon of a jackass, remember.<br />
<br />
With several clip-clops, his giant schlong bobbing up and down and his big back balls hanging loosely and wobbling massively and slowly just under his anus, he wandered towards that truck. <br />
<br />
Now, Jeff was a large jackass. A good 500 lb animal, and he had become used to the size of his body. He didn&#39;t like that he was a big obnoxious jack. It kinda made it more.....animalistic and disgusting. Just a big dumb old horny beast. Jeff knew instinctively he would be able to easily look into those mirrors without stretching or trying to stand on something. He has started to become fully develop his own spacial awareness of the body he was having to live with these past three days....<br />
<br />
Anyway, he approached the truck mirrors. In addition to getting used to his size, he was beginning to get acclimated to the fact that he was a donkey. The initial shock of body horror was wearing off. He was getting used to seeing his big, thick, wide,  long gray-furred body back there behind his vision. And feeling it. He was getting used to feeling his mostly expressionless face and his inability to facially express more nuanced emotions than anger and fear. He was definitely used to the weight and movement of his long ears, so much so, that he had forgotten that he had such humiliating things attached to his head. <br />
<br />
What he was NOT used to, was the reflection of his face! Upon seeing his own reflection; the &quot;identity&quot; he was stuck with, Jeff was right back to square one all over again. <br />
<br />
On the one hand, he knew that was him. On the otherhand, he also did NOT know that was him! Despite everything he&#39;s been through the past three days up to this point, he still had it in his mind that he had blue eyes, smooth, pale cheeks, and blond hair with a button nose. That&#39;s been his identity in his own mind all along. It was also partially why he was so humiliated, being stuck with a beastly body. He instinctually took it for granted that he was somehow recognizable as a human stuck with the body of the donkey. He kinda somehow thought the world would know who he was upon seeing him. Which is partially what motivated him to escape that farm to begin with. Toayne seek out some help.<br />
<br />
However, what he saw in that reflection was somehow completely unexpected. All he saw was just some plain old stupid donkey face with really tall, wide ears and large unintelligent brown eyes. That wasnt him! It couldn&#39;t be! <br />
<br />
There was a complex mix of emotions all rolled up into one in that moment. The exact same feeling when he first sitched bodies with some random horny male donkey in the first place:<br />
<br />
Terror<br />
Denial<br />
Humiliation<br />
Frustration (the feeling of being trapped or stuck)<br />
<br />
Disgusted. Literally, being grossed out! He had the face and body of a donkey! Not a donkey that he had transformed into himself! Oh no! A real donkey he had SWAPPED PLACES with somewhere in the world, and being given the very filth that was stuck with this body that real donkey was creating and living in! He was literally put in the shoes, or rather the hooves, of an actual donkey and it&#39;s filthy lifestyle! <br />
<br />
And many other different indescribable emotions, all rolled up in his sexual fantasy come true!<br />
<br />
Standing there, disgusted and grossed out, he was coming to a slow realization that he was a complete and total jackass! Not a trace of his human identity. Not. A. Trace! As far as the entire world would ever be concerned, he was a pure donkey through-and-through! Not a lick of intelligence behind his big brown eyes! <br />
<br />
Jeff opened his big black furry lips to look inside his own mouth. A line of huge flat slabs of donkey teeth and the gross-looking gums they were shoved into.  Clearly unbrushed and never taken care of! His huge thick slimy tongue. That was HIS mouth now! Those were HIS wide nostrils now! <br />
<br />
If the horrible situation of knowing he was forced to have to breath through that donkey&#39;s big wide black nostrils and mouth wasn&#39;t bad enough, he attempted to speak:<br />
<br />
&quot;Hee haaww-!&quot;<br />
<br />
It was in this moment that it really finally hit Jeff in both the heart and the gut:<br />
<br />
There way to communicate. Absolutely no way to communicate whatsoever! Not ever! Whatever thoughts Jeff had in his mind, would remain locked away  between his big donkey ears, and come out as obnoxious brats from his big rubbery donkey lips! There was never going to be a way to express his thoughts! Not ever! <br />
<br />
What was he to do now!? Up to this point, he had only thought of escape from that field and it&#39;s notorious fence. He only thought of the next step ahead. But now he was thinking several steps ahead in his desire to become human again. To switch back to his human body with that donkey! Who knows what that donkey was doing to him and his reputation!? <br />
<br />
But he couldn&#39;t communicate! Couldn&#39;t read! Had no idea where in the world he even was! <br />
<br />
&quot;Heee hhhaawww...&quot; He let out a forlorn bray on this lonely stretch of highway as it really began to sink in. This is who he was now. What he was. He really began to realize there was never going to be a way back. This was now his life. <br />
<br />
With a deep feeling of forboding in his heart and trying to repress what he already knew, he sadly turned and clip--clopped his way back towards the highway. Jeff just chose a random direction to begin walking. <br />
<br />
&quot;At the very least, I could make-do with a little bit of freedom away from that field,&quot; he thought to himself. It was good to be out and about, even as a four-legged creature. <br />
<br />
Jeff had no idea how long he was walking. Several vehicles rumbled past him, which put such a fright in him that was as irrational as that electric fence. He supposed it was because they were so.....LOUD! <br />
<br />
In any case, after a bit, he began to hear water. Water! He also began to smell it! It sounded and smelled so fresh and enticing! It was coming from the other side of the road! Jeff needn&#39;t have looked both ways before crossing. Indeed, it wouldn&#39;t have done him any good, seeing as how his eyesight was unreliable. He could hear anything coming from miles away. Jeff just simply meandered to the other side of the road.<br />
<br />
There were trees, and he could clearly hear the sound of a creek or a brook somewhere among the woods. A gust of wind momentarily blocked the sound somewhat, but as he proceeded into the woods, the water was getting louder. It must have been further away than Jeff thought, as he seemed to be walking through the woods for quite sometime. <br />
<br />
The buzzing insects were beginning to get to him. His tail did it&#39;s best to keep them from his back end. His ears were constantly twitching to keep them out. &quot;I can&#39;t fucking scratch myself!&quot; Jeff thought. &quot;HAAAAAWWW!!&quot; he eventually sighed in frustration. He REALLY hated being stuck as an animal with God damned HOOVES! &quot;Fucking useless, these things are!&quot; <br />
<br />
Nearly in tears with the desire to use fingers he had not possessed for the past 3 and a half days and would never possess; to scratch a particularly intense insect bite he suffered on his right shoulder, he had FINALLY spotted the god-given stream he was hearing and smelling from quite a distance. <br />
<br />
Hee-hawing instead of yelping for joy, Jeff bounded through the woods, nearly overturning his right front ankle (not a &quot;wrist&quot;) on a loose rock towards the sound of freshness. This was no ordinary stream through the woods. It was a creek that was practically an outright river! <br />
<br />
&quot;Haw!&quot; Jeff said, forgetting he can&#39;t say &quot;Yes!&quot; Whichade him momentarily cringe. But there was water! Lots of it! He could finally bathe himself! Or at the very least, allow the water to rinse his body. <br />
<br />
He carefully made his way down to the back. This was definitely much easier on four legs than two. But even so, when finally stepped foot in some nice clean water for the first time since swapping with this donkey....Lord knows how long it has been since this body of his has felt water before the swap....Jeff had lost his footing and began to plummet chin-first towards the shallow rockey bed. As he was falling face first, his hind legs pushed his back hooves off the rocks behind him and he propelled forward and a bit upwards. With a splash, he managed to get his front legs back under him just as the wide middle portion of his body splashed down into deeper water!<br />
<br />
The water had a sharp descent at that point, as it came up to his snout. It was also quite swift. Trying to regain his footing to paw at the rocky bottom, the water instead lifted his bouyant body up and he was carried more towards the my middle of the creek, which was even deeper and swifter yet!<br />
<br />
Poor Jeff was a complete loss as to how to swim with hooves instead of hands. Another big disadvantage of being stuck as a donkey! He also began to snort in order to keep the water from going up his big wide black nostrils. Lucky for him, his donkey body was more bouyant than his human body would have been. Unfortunately, he could only weakly doggy-paddle. It was the only way his current bodily physiology could &quot;swim.&quot; No breast stroke. No back stroke. And even the doggie paddle was far less effective with no means of cupping the water like a human hand could do in order to more effectively swim! He was desperately trying to use hands he didn&#39;t have. He NEEDED his hands! <br />
<br />
Huffing and half braying, he kicked as much as he could towards the far bank, all the while trying to will his hands from their restricted blocks of hooves! It took a short while, but he did eventually made it close enough to the far bank to where he could FINALLY touch bottom with his legs. Propelling himself up the onto the rocky shore, huffing and braying, Jeff finally began to actually get angry upon seeing his own donkey rear-end come out of the water; the looking down and seeing legs and hooves instead of arms and hands. <br />
<br />
&quot;Stupid hooves! Can&#39;t even swim with these things! God dammit! I can&#39;t be stuck as a fucking DONKEY!  I&#39;m so damn SICK AND TIRED of this fucking body!&quot;<br />
<br />
He turned to look at his reflection in the mirror like surface of the creek once the surface tension went back to normal. <br />
<br />
&quot;Heee hhhaawww!!&quot; He brayed at himself angrily upon seeing his stupid unidentifiable non-human donkey head staring back at him. <br />
<br />
&quot;A fucking DONKEY! Why in God&#39;s name would I think it would be fun to switch bodies with a fucking donkey!?&quot; <br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s sexual fetish of being stuck in such a humiliating and helpless animal was beginning to wear off as his irritation with a lack of hands and inability to move around and speak as a human continued growing. This wasn&#39;t good. It was no good at all. Jeff couldn&#39;t handle the thought that that was him. That it&#39;s been him for the past three days without a break. And the thought of multiplying those three days by hundreds, maybe by thousands, was staggering. <br />
<br />
This was a choice he had purposely made just for a few moments of sexual pleasure. Now it was a choice he&#39;s going to have to live with, whether he liked it or not!</p>
