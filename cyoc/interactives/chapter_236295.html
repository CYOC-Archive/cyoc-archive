<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Caleb Moreland was dreaming again. He dreamed he was pummeling Wyatt&#39;s face into the ground with his face looking bloodied and beaten. As he stood up to look at Wyatt&#39;s lifeless body, he suddenly heard crying from behind him. He turned around to see young Andrew Tepes and other children behind him in silhouette.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why did you kill our daddy mister monster?&quot; Young Andrew Tepes tearfully asked as Caleb suddenly shot up awake.<br />
<br />
Caleb rubbed his eyes as he looked around, he was back in the hospital room next to Connor who was still resting after his successful surgery. Nina and Spark had gone to get some food from the cafeteria for Connor to eat. While Nina and Caleb visited as often as they could, as they were still having the house finished, Spark practically lived by Connor&#39;s bedside. Caleb could now see Connor waking up as Caleb stood up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey little brother, I heard from Aunt Julia that you should be able to come home in a few days once you get back up on your feet.&quot; Caleb said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I wonder how dad felt whenever he had to be in the hospital.&quot; Connor groggily wondered aloud.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, he wasn&#39;t really too crazy about hospitals, you know that. His arm incident was probably the only time he couldn&#39;t leave sooner than he wanted. Man....I still can&#39;t believe he did what he did. But then again, he&#39;s a Moreland, he went out fighting.&quot; Caleb said as Nina and Spark came into the room with them each carrying Chase and Charlotte separately.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh good, you&#39;re awake. I&#39;ve brought you the best of what I could find at the hospital cafeteria. You wouldn&#39;t believe how hard it is for them to make some good food here.&quot; Spark commented as Chase clutched onto her shirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Spark, it&#39;s a hospital, not a five star restaurant.&quot; Nina said shaking her head while little Charlotte slept on her shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well they should make better food, especially for my fiancé here.&quot; Spark said as Connor began to drown out the voices of his family in the room. He thought of his father, Jacob, or rather he tried to think of the last thing the two had said to each other.<br />
<br />
He did remember one of the last times he saw him was when he and Spark were getting ready to go out to do something either on a date or with their friends, he didn&#39;t remember which it was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bye son.&quot; Jacob said to him as Connor just nodded back but said nothing.<br />
<br />
&#39;No, that&#39;s not what happened, was it?&#39; Connor thought as he tried to remember again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bye son, love you.&quot; Jacob Moreland said as Connor and Spark began to walk out the front door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, bye dad. Love you too.&quot; Connor said as he and Spark gave a loving wave before proceeding out the door.<br />
<br />
&#39;That doesn&#39;t seem right either.&#39; Connor thought to himself as he tried to remember again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bye son.&quot; Jacob Moreland said as Connor came over and gave his father a hug before heading out the door with Spark. Connor now shed a little tear down his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Connor, honey, are you okay?&quot; Nina asked her son as she, Caleb, Connor, and Rick who had also just come into the room with Julia carrying young Tammy were looking at him now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah I am, I was....just trying to remember the last thing I said to dad.&quot; Connor replied as everyone now grew silent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you know what? I actually saved this before the old house was destroyed. The family photo album.&quot; Nina said as she pulled out the album which looked pretty heavy.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know your father and I worked on it for a while, though I think we didn&#39;t get around to filling out the pages when you all met Gloria and.....&quot; Nina explained before she opened up to what she thought was the last page of pictures.<br />
<br />
She then proceeded to go past it and see that Jacob had actually added pictures without her aware. He added a picture of Gloria and Caleb together, Connor and Spark at their first dance, Caleb and Gloria at prom, there was a picture Caleb saw with him and Duke which made him hurt a little inside. Then there was the pictures of Nina pregnant with the twins, then the birth of the twins, the last photo he had added before he obviously stopped was the last new family photo with Chase and Charlotte. Nina was getting emotional, especially after she saw a note left behind by Jacob.<br />
<br />
&#39;Keep adding all the love, you&#39;ll always be my love, forever.&#39; Nina&#39;s eyes started to get teary now as she tried not to cry. Her kids saw this and smiled at the last gift Jacob Moreland had given Nina.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dadda.&quot; Little Charlotte said waking up and saw the pictures before her. Nina gave her young daughter a smile and kiss on the cheek.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, are you okay?&quot; Connor asked as Nina nodded while closing the album and wiping away some of her tears. Julia came over and gave her a little pat on the back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Connor the good news is that you should be able to leave in a few days now. The bad news is of course that you&#39;ll have to have quite a while of recovering.&quot; Julia said as young Tammy began to get a little fussy and Julia had to pat her back.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s fine with me. I&#39;m going to be by his side helping him recover as much as I can and I swear Connor before the year is over you&#39;ll be walking as normal as you can be again.&quot; Spark promised.<br />
<br />
&quot;So we can be ready for the wedding, right? You&#39;re going to look beautiful as a bride Spark.&quot; Connor complimented as Spark blushed at her fiancé&#39;s compliment. Before Spark could say anything else, little Chase pooped in his diaper.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Chase, you little mood killer. Now we&#39;ve got to change your stinky diaper.&quot; Spark said holding Chase away from her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hopefully he doesn&#39;t do that around the girls when he grows up.&quot; Nina joked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah and hopefully he plays nice with Tammy and Charlotte when they get older too.&quot; Tammy commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Which reminds me, honey, when do you think we should let Tammy into the &#39;family business&#39;?&quot; Rick asked.<br />
<br />
Julia shot her a husband a look, trying to control the famous Harris temper. &quot;Well I&#39;d say never, but we&#39;ll see when she grows up.&quot; She said rocking her baby to sleep. &quot;I better not see you encouraging her though Rick.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you&#39;re just looking after her, but we&#39;ve got to prepare her for these things.&quot; Rick said as he and Julia continued to discuss the matter.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile Spark was trying to find the diapers to change Chase, Nina and Caleb were showing Charlotte more pictures of her daddy. Connor looked around the room and smiled happy to have his family beside him.</p>
