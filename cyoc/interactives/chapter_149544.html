<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Everyone deserved a nice day at the beach and there was also the opportunity to make other people&#39;s lives better as well. Gloria thought over how she could phrase her wishes so each pair could get what they wanted. Once she made up her mind, she quietly made her wishes. The ring thrummed and soon its magic was affecting the other people on the beach.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
June was getting a little frustrated. She had wanted to spend a nice day at the beach, let Tommy have some fun while she scoped out any potential men who she could bring back home. But as soon as any man started talking with her, Tommy kicked up such a fuss. &quot;Tommy, if you don&#39;t keep your voice down, we&#39;re going back home,&quot; said June sternly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t like those men,&quot; pouted Tommy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tommy, Mommy just wants to make friends. Don&#39;t you want to have a daddy some day?&quot; asked June.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would I want a daddy? You&#39;re all I ever want,&quot; said Tommy.<br />
<br />
June sighed in exasperation. Tommy was just a little too attached to her. It wasn&#39;t his fault. He never knew his father. She hadn&#39;t even seen that jerk after that one-night stand. But while she was trying her best to raise Tommy on her own, she still felt a woman&#39;s needs. And it would be better for Tommy if he had a father to look after him. If only he&#39;d let other men come near her.<br />
<br />
But then the magic started affecting them. It mostly affected Tommy who started growing bigger. He was quickly shooting up in height as he was looking less childish. The only way June was affected was that she remembered having Tommy earlier and earlier, her life getting more complicated and harder to manage as Tommy became the product of teenage pregnancy. But then Tommy passed the age where it would have been impossible for June to have given birth to him, causing her mind to blank as a new reality was being written.<br />
<br />
By that point, Tommy, or rather Thomas, was gone through his last teen years. Puberty had been kind to him, causing him to grow tall and very handsome. He was also growing very muscular. Even after finishing puberty, his muscles still kept growing, becoming one of the buffest guys on the beach. As the magic finished its course, it left Thomas a 28-year-old man and a professional football player spending a day on the beach with his wife.<br />
<br />
Thomas turned to June and said, &quot;Hey, babe. You&#39;re not checking out other guys, are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
June gave him a coy look and said, &quot;No more than you&#39;re checking out the other chicks here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why look at them when I have you?&quot; asked Thomas, pulling June onto his lap. June smiled at him before they started making out.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Part of the beach was reserved for people who wanted to lift weights. People of different shapes and sizes were pumping iron to build up muscles. Of particular note were two small kids were trying to pick up the smallest weights. Though they weren&#39;t as serious as the older people. &quot;Hey, look, Nora,&quot; said the boy, holding up a small dumbbell, &quot;I&#39;m a superman.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You wish you were a superman, Marco,&quot; said the girl, who was holding up a similar weight, &quot;You&#39;re not going to be that big when you grow up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll still be bigger than you,&quot; said Marco, &quot;Everyone knows boys are bigger than girls.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not gonna be a little girl,&quot; said Nora, &quot;When I grow up, I&#39;m going to be bigger than anyone.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was at that point that the magic touched them. They felt no more than a small shudder. But they were soon filled with a lot of energy. &quot;I&#39;m gonna try the bigger weights,&quot; said Marco, &quot;You can stick with the small weights.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As if,&quot; said Nora, &quot;I&#39;m gonna get bigger weights than you.&quot; The two of them picked up some heavier dumbbells and started lifting them. They would have been too heavy, but they were growing bigger now, getting stronger.<br />
<br />
When Marco got to 11 years old, he found the dumbbells not enough of a challenge. &quot;Bet you I can lift a barbell more than you,&quot; said Marco.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re on,&quot; said Nora. The two of them started with the smaller barbells, which were initially a struggle for them. But as they entered puberty, they got strong enough to manage them more easily. Their bodies reflected it as Marco&#39;s baby fat had already burned up and he was becoming buffer. Nora&#39;s chest was starting to push out as she got a more toned look, particularly her exposed stomach. Their clothes were growing with them to match their bodies and show off their physiques.<br />
<br />
At 15, Marco said, &quot;You mind spotting me on the bench press?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You better not be going light,&quot; said Nora. She stood over Marco as he lifted some pretty heavy weights. She was admiring the way his chest was becoming more sculpted. Meanwhile, Marco was watching as Nora&#39;s breasts were growing bigger above him, driving him to lift even harder.<br />
<br />
At 19 years, Marco got off the bench press and said, &quot;Ok, Nora, let&#39;s see if you can move this weight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;With pleasure,&quot; said Nora as she laid down and started lifting. Now it was Marco&#39;s turn to admire Nora&#39;s increasing muscular tone, as well as good look at her cleavage from above. Nora was also eying up Marco&#39;s body even as she kept lifting. From this angle, it was particularly easy for her to noticed the growing bulge in Marco&#39;s shorts.<br />
<br />
Eventually, 21-year-old Nora got off the bench press. She had grown up to a very attractive woman, her beauty and curves not offset by her very muscular physique. &quot;Still think women are too small to be muscular?&quot; she asked in a teasing tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you can only get as far,&quot; said 22-year-old Marco. He had become even more ripped at his new age, easily being the biggest guy on the beach. He was still taller than Nora and was very massive.<br />
<br />
&quot;Still, I think we&#39;ll beat everyone in the couples bodybuilding competition,&quot; said Nora.<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re not even gonna come close,&quot; said Marco.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, how about we head back and exercise some different muscles?&quot; asked Nora suggestively.<br />
<br />
&quot;Still think you&#39;re more limber than me?&quot; asked Marco.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think, I know,&quot; said Nora.<br />
<br />

<br />
Betty was glad to spend the day with her daughter, Georgina, but the more she tried to relax, the more old regrets kept bubbling up. It started over having Georgina at 18 because of an accident. As much as she loved her daughter, she wished she could have given her a better life. Now they were both so old and Betty was thinking she hadn&#39;t done enough with her life. She felt that Georgina could have done better if she was a better parent.<br />
<br />
But then the magic hit them and they felt a lot more at ease. Years quickly swept off of them. Wrinkles and grey hairs disappeared as more vigor returned to their bodies. Their breasts became perky again as fat accumulated with age was shrinking away. Interestingly, Betty was growing younger at a faster rate than Georgina, closing the age gap between them. Before long, they were lovely women in their 20&#39;s again, but the magic wasn&#39;t finished there. The magic pushed them back into their teen years, causing their curves to start shrinking. But the youthening was slowing down by then. They eventually stopped before they got to the other side of puberty. Now Georgina was 14 years old and Betty was no longer her mother who had her at 18, but her older sister by 18 months.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure are a lot of people out today, Betty,&quot; said Georgina.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why not? It&#39;s a wonderful day,&quot; said Betty.<br />
<br />
&quot;You wanna go out in the water or something?&quot; asked Georgina.<br />
<br />
&quot;Or something,&quot; said Betty, &quot;Plenty of guys around here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Betty, don&#39;t get carried away with boys again,&quot; said Georgina.<br />
<br />
Betty sighed. She didn&#39;t know why, but Georgina had always been able to rein her in when she was getting a little too boy crazy. It was probably for the best. Betty could have gotten herself into real trouble if her sister wasn&#39;t the voice of moderation. &quot;How about we see if there are any girls who want to chat?&quot; suggested Betty.<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds good to me,&quot; said Georgina.</p>
