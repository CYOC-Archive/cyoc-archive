<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Judy looked down at Jim, now her younger baby brother, and thought for a minute. While she stood there in her now older and, sexier 20 year old body, <br />
Jim shifted on the bed nervously and a bit scared. He was worried what his sister was going to do to him, he just wanted to turn back to his normal age. As <br />
he sat there waiting for the inevitable, tears began to fill his eyes and slide down his cheeks, a response to his now younger emotions; mostly his fear. Jim <br />
suddenly realized that he was crying and quickly brushed away his tears, accidently letting out a loud sniff.<br />
<br />
Judy, hearing it, looked down at her brother and, noticing his teary fear filled eyes, suddenly felt an urge to go sit on the bed and hold him in her arms; to <br />
comfort and protect him. Judy shook her head, trying to get rid of the new feeling welling up inside her.<br />
<br />
'Why am I suddenly wanting to comfort my brother? He deserves this after all that he had done to me when I was younger than him! I should not feel <br />
sympathy for him, I will not feel sympathy for him, I will-,' Judy's train of thought stopped as her eyes focused, again, on her brother.<br />
<br />
No matter how hard he tried, Jim couldn't stop the tears from flowing. He sniffed again as he started to sob, his little shoulders shaking with each breath <br />
that shook his 4 year old frame. He eventually gave up and, not caring anymore if his big sister noticed, placed his face in his small hands. His tears fell <br />
faster as his fear grew. <br />
<br />
The feeling had by now spread up into Judy's chest, filling her heart with maternal love for the crying 4 year old. Judy couldn't deny the wanting to comfort <br />
him any longer, she had to comfort him. With that final thought in her mind, Judy quickly ran to her mom's dresser and grabbed one of her large t-shirts <br />
and threw it on. Then, opening another drawer, she grabbed a pair of panties and drew them up her legs. Judy then quickly headed back to her brother's <br />
bedroom, grabbing a blanket from the hall closet on the way.<br />
<br />
Jim was still sitting on the bed with his head in his hands, when he felt something sit on the bed beside him and felt something soft and warm wrapped <br />
around his small body. He opened his eyes and rubbed away at an eye, sniffing again, as a pair of arms gently wrapped around him and lifted him up onto <br />
someone's lap. He looked up at Judy with his tear stained face, to see her smiling down at him warmly and her eyes filled with motherly worry and <br />
sympathy. Jim didn't know what to think as he stared up at the beautiful woman that was his sister, a confused look appeared on his face when his mind <br />
switched out the word 'Sister' in that sentence for 'Mother'.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mommy?&quot;<br />
<br />
Judy felt her smile widen and a tear slid down her cheek, when she heard his small voice say that word. She pulled Jim to her chest as she tightened her <br />
embrace around him. She felt Jim, wrap his tiny arms as far as he could around her waist. Judy removed one hand from his back and placed it on the back <br />
of his head and began to run her longer fingers through his hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, sweetie, it's mommy, I'm here,&quot; she said to him in a soothing voice.<br />
<br />
As Jim sat in his sister's lap, his mind began to change back to that of a child's. Judy, in his mind, was not his sister, but his mother. All his memories of <br />
his older self vanished and were replaced by new one's of him and his mommy. Jimmy nuzzled against his mother's chest and closed his eyes as he smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you mommy,&quot; Jimmy said happily.<br />
<br />
Judy choked back a sob as her tears now began to fall. She lifted Jimmy up and kissed him on the forehead, then gave him a hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you too, Jimmy,&quot; she whispered in his ear.<br />
<br />
Judy looked up at the balloon that was sitting on top of the dresser and she couldn't help but smile at it. She had a few more things that she wanted to <br />
change and none of them included changing her son anymore.</p>
