<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You tried your best, but being more used to your own mares left you more uncertain with Brandi.  In the end, while it was a close call, you ended up losing by a mere second.  <br />
<br />
WHITNEY- Oh dear.  Well, I must say I’m a little disappointed, but I’m also impressed, Calvin.  You have nearly quadrupled the size of your herd in a single challenge.<br />
<br />
Calvin grinned as he approached her, his new mare.  He ran a possessive hand through her hair, and she wickered pleasurably in response.<br />
<br />
CALVIN- Don’t be disappointed, Whitney.  Your son did admirably.  I’m sure he’ll win another fine herd in time.<br />
<br />
Saying this, Calvin immediately bent her over the counter and set about claiming her as his own.  Meanwhile, your sisters surrounded you, both to comfort and scold.<br />
<br />
ZOE- Aw, Brother!  How could you!?  Now, I’m gonna have to pack all my stuff!<br />
<br />
LUCY- Sorry, John, but I kind of knew this would happen.  Look on the bright side.  At least you’ll have a strong stallion to act as a role model.  <br />
<br />
Grace stayed silent, but you could read her expression.  She was not sorry at all.  Her eyes were already roaming the winning stallion with anticipation.<br />
<br />
A jolt of shame ran through you.  How could you lose?  Your herd had been much larger, and you had been its only stallion for years!  Then, the answer hit you.  Calvin was older and more experienced.  While Brandi had been his only mare, he had no doubt successfully won her through another challenge while you had simply inherited your herd from your father.  Really, if your father had still been alive, you would have been exactly where you are now: simply a part of another stallion’s herd, waiting for your chance to break out on your own someday.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, you watched your sisters move on to their new leader and lover.  Zoe pressed herself against Calvin even as he snorted in triumph, filling Whitney with his dominance.  Despite your eldest sister’s earlier protests, she seemed determined to make the most of the new arrangement.  Her persistence was soon rewarded as Calvin took her next.<br />
<br />
On the sidelines, you watched, feeling an odd tingle wash over you.  Oh well, it could be worse. At least he’s strong and handsome.  <br />
<br />
You blinked and shook your head.  Where did that thought come from?  No, you were just admiring a worthy opponent.  And who could blame you?  The stallion had muscles like a Greek god, much bigger than your own measly limbs.  <br />
<br />
A small bit of leftover pride made you amend that.  Your body wasn’t measly.  You just had a different kind of attractiveness, right?  Times were changing.  Many mares preferred the sleeker, gentler look, these days.  Slender frame, softer face framed by long hair and mane, slightly pronounced hips, even your smaller male equipment, these things were considered attractive by a growing number of mares.  Many stallions, too…<br />
<br />
Again, your thoughts made you frown in confusion.  Why should you care about what other stallions liked?  You had no interest in other stallions.  <br />
<br />
While Calvin finished with Zoe and moved on to Lucy and Grace simultaneously, you felt yourself getting hot.  Running your hands over your chest, you fondled your small buds that had always looked out of place on a stallion, even an androgynous one like yourself.  Still, they were nicely sensitive, just like the little nub between your thighs that acted as the only thing keeping that M under the sex category on your ID.  The only thing keeping you from even considering a stallion as a potential lover.  <br />
<br />
Hearing Lucy’s delighted neigh followed by a pleased gasp from Grace, you smiled to yourself and gave your hand sized globes a squeeze.  Your wide hips twitched at a sudden feeling of wetness down below.  No, stallions were beneath consideration.  That is, they used to be, until…<br />
<br />
To your surprise, another pair of hands snaked around you and grabbed the lush breast flesh that your own dainty fingers couldn’t contain, those huge assets gifted to you from your mother’s side of the family, bigger even than Lucy’s!  Brandi put her face over your shoulder, nuzzling your cheek through your long, silky hair as her own breasts mashed into your back.<br />
<br />
BRANDI- So what do you say now, sweetie?  Still think Calvin can’t handle five more mares?  Still think your family is better off without a stallion?<br />
<br />
Wait, no stallion?  And FIVE more mares?  But weren’t there only four in your family?  Whitney, Zoe, Lucy, Grace-<br />
<br />
Your mental roll call was interrupted when Grace let out a shriek of ecstasy louder than anything you ever heard from her before.  Calvin pulled out, letting her tumble on top of her sisters now sprawled together on the floor in a daze.  Only your mother, being more experienced, had managed to stay upright.<br />
<br />
Brandi giggled as she gave you a push towards Calvin.  The stallion rolled his manly shoulders and casually cracked his neck.  Then, he turned, grinning smugly down at you.<br />
<br />
A detached part of your mind was still trying desperately to hold on to its previous train of thought.  Whitney, Zoe, Lucy, Grace, and…and?<br />
<br />
CALVIN- Jessie, it’s your turn to choose.  Will you join my herd?<br />
<br />
Ah yes.  Silly Jess!  How could you forget yourself?  Jessica, known to family and friends as Jessie or Jess.  Perhaps, it had been all those years standing in for your deceased father.  A strong-willed mare watching over her family in a stallion’s world, keeping her mother and sisters fed.  And satisfied, thanks to an impressive collection of toys and a few perfected skills.  Over time, you had stopped thinking of yourself as just another mare, putting aside the idea that your herd could use a stallion of its own.  <br />
<br />
Now, in the face of this true stallion, you felt a strong sense of what you had been denying yourself all this time.  <br />
<br />
You gulped, your body already telling you in no uncertain terms to accept.  Still, your mother had always said you have a stubborn streak.  Whatever choice you made, it would be your decision alone.  Folding your arms under your huge rack, you made the stallion wait while you deliberated.  A few seconds more just for good measure.  Then, you smiled and answered.</p>
