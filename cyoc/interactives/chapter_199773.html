<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer had been used to getting good grade from bullying, manipulation, bribes, or good old seduction. Now however, Jen-Jen was found herself thinking about her situation. <br />
<br />
Kyle had said her reality would be retconned so his transform and dares were a natural part of reality. Therefore, she&#39;d always been the goblin as Kyle made her. Therefore, she&#39;d always been bi, she&#39;s always been eager to physically anymore since hitting puberty, and she&#39;d always been brilliant. Knowledge and intelligence weren&#39;t the same thing. <br />
<br />
Looking around at everything, the TV, the computer, the cordless phone, everything was just so, simple. It almost left Jennifer confused at how she&#39;d ever been impressed by any of it, but she knew logically it was because she&#39;d never had this level of intelligence before to process it all. <br />
<br />
But she did notice the step stoles everywhere, and several note books now dotted the selves. She took  one and read it, it was her hand writing, in the same horrible grammar, but the observations were all detailed and logical. <br />
<br />
Being the only goblin alive born to rich human parents, she&#39;d taken careful notes on herself. Her physical limits, her anatomy, her body chemistry, etcetera. There were also notes on the humans around her constantly underestimating her due to her inability to master grammar, but the same humans coming crawling back to her every time test time came along. She also apparently had several patents to her name in spite of still being in high school, and she&#39;d made her family even richer. <br />
<br />
There was no note of her bullying or tormenting the geeks or nerds, or other outcast. Checking her cellphone, she found the names of several the &#39;loser brigade&#39; as she&#39;d once called them now listed. <br />
<br />
The details of her life included were almost to perfect. Until she found a note, written to herself, from herself. <br />
<br />
&#39;Hi Jen-Jen. Me spend years learning about me. It make no sense me be goblin but parents human. But medical records show me her baby girl. Been observing legends of Glendale &#39;Transform or Dare&#39; curse. Me find stories of victims. Me cross reference history. Me conclude: reality must change for me to be goblin. But me never play game. Me find no link to Jen-Jen in chain of curse. Me conclude, reality changed, but reality had been changed yet. Me wake up one day, and me remember world where me not goblin, but me not remember this me writing to you right now. Me scared a little that me not be me anymore. But me know Jen Jen super smart, so me deal with it. Me leave notes and stuff for you to learn to be Jen-Jen.&#39;  <br />
<br />
Jennifer noted this was logical. If this was a retcon to reality, then logically Jennifer would have realized the inconsistency with reality even if reality didn&#39;t. <br />
<br />
Jennifer hurried back to her room. She didn&#39;t find her alter to her own vanity she was so proud of. Well, there was still the boy bands, and the cheer leader outfit (even genius&#39; needed a hobby), but also mountains of notes, prototype devices everywhere, and her own personal workshop. Given her smaller size, there was more room. <br />
<br />
She did find her closet was now overflowing with jewelry, all of a gold and gems variety. Any clothing she found within was purely for practical purposes, like a lab coat, goggles, gloves, and some rubber gloves, boots, and collar. And an expensive custom dress for formal occasions. <br />
<br />
Her grades made the school GPA the highest in the country. So she was given a lot of leeway. And with the fortune her inventions had made her family, they gave her all the more. <br />
<br />
She remembered her notes observing that even stepping on a nail was of no concern to her with her tough hide. And hot and cold bothered her little until they reach extremes that humans would faint at. <br />
<br />
She looked down, her sock was missing, or rather, it had never existed. Jennifer tossed off the rest of her uniform, she didn&#39;t feel like wearing it today, leaving her naked. She&#39;d have to get her backpack and books though, even if she&#39;d memorized all the material ages ago, she needed them for formal reasons. If only she had a while more and she could build a compressed spacial storage device... Oh wait. She&#39;d always been this way. Therefore... yep!<br />
<br />
Jennifer picked up a gold necklace, dangling from it was a cube with tiny jewels on the surface. She pressed a few of the gems, and in a flash appeared her school books and papers. A few pushes more and they vanished again. <br />
<br />
Her cube also contains some other items for her personal use and experimentation. Her family could easily pay for test subjects, but Jennifer felt it didn&#39;t help with observations in a total natural environment. <br />
<br />
Jennifer realized thanks to Kyle she&#39;d missed the bus.<br />
<br />
&quot;No big problem.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jen-Jen grabbed a device next to her bed, opened the window, and leapt up. The umbrella like device opened up into a pair of propellers. This slowed her fall to the point she was almost floating. She buzzed her way to the next bus stop and landed in time for catch up with the school bus. <br />
<br />
As Jen-Jen expected, the bus driver, nor any of the students were shocked at her appearance. Jen-Jen hopped to a seat and sat down nearly. <br />
<br />
However, Jennifer did notice a problem as the bus drove around and more people came on board. None were giving her the looks of lust that you&#39;d expect for being the school fucktoy. Didn&#39;t these small minded creatures know that she was open to anyone, anywhere, any time? It was her civic duty, and even if anyone complained, she was too precious to the school for anything to stick. <br />
<br />
That was when Jen-Jen realized Kyle had made a sever miscalculation. <br />
<br />
Kyle Perkin&#39;s &#39;Transform or Dare&#39; made her being the school fucktoy a natural part of reality. But his &#39;Transform or Dare&#39; had said nothing about adjusting people&#39;s tastes and preferences to match! <br />
<br />
&#39;Kyle! You am idiot! You forget to make everyone wanna use gobbo fucktoy! Not everyone want sex on the spot! Lots of people just not into that! Let alone into gobbos! You am jerk! How am Jen-Jen to be school fucktoy when no one want to fuck Jen Jen?!&#39;<br />
<br />
Jen-Jen growled on frustration. Even objectively knowing that it was all part of Kyle&#39;s &#39;Transform or Dare&#39;, it didn&#39;t change the fact it was now a fundamental part of Jen-Jen&#39;s existence and she wouldn&#39;t have it any other way. She wanted sex, but none of these dumb humans were interested in giving it to her. Maybe she could wipe up a hypno-ray on lunch break and reprogram their tastes and social mores. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Jen-Jen,&quot; it was Kimberly, a close &#39;friend&#39; of Jennifer&#39;s (as much as she HAD &#39;friends&#39;), and part of the cheer squad. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Kim-Kim.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So uh, thanks for helping the rest of the squad with our examines, gave us plenty more time to practice our routines.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jen-Jen fulfill her function so Kim-Kim and Squad fulfill theirs,&quot; Jen-Jen said calmly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, right, so score anyone?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Stupid humans not seem to realize gobbo superior in ways they no get!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll take that as a no.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jen-Jen observed her superiority complex wasn&#39;t that different from when she&#39;d never been human. But now it came from her own achievements and intellect rather than family and inherited wealth. She&#39;d truly been part of the sub-intelligent rabble. <br />
<br />
Jennifer had seen the cheer squad as a means to an end, same as they saw her. United in their collective vanity and ability to wrap any guy around their little finger or any girl crawl at their feet. <br />
<br />
Jen-Jen saw them as a collective pet for her to take care of and nurture. She&#39;d been considering many possible ways to upgrade them to be more efficient. She now had the power of the curse, but she already knew what to do with that.<br />
<br />
The naked goblin touched her necklace, making her phone appear. She effortlessly hacked the school computer system, immediately finding where her target was likely to be. <br />
<br />
Math class was boring, but not for the reasons Jennifer had. Now Jen-Jen doodled some quantum equations just to keep the trigonometry baby talk from rotting her goblin brain. Watching these humans struggle with such simple concepts was physically painful. <br />
<br />
Jennifer had reveled in her sense of superiority, but Jen-Jen craved to have some closer to her intellect around her, some who had the brains to appreciate her work. She&#39;d only not skipped grades because she technically needed classes on her record to get into a collage. That, and like anyone with a pet, it felt wrong to simply abandon the squad now that they&#39;d come to depend on her. <br />
<br />
Jen-Jen left the class early and none dared tried to stop her. They all knew she came to class just to humor the teachers anyway. <br />
<br />
Jen-Jen walked into Kyle&#39;s class just as the bell rang. <br />
<br />
Kyle couldn&#39;t help but grin at her as he saw her coming, the teacher and students having already left.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Howdy beotch, how&#39;s karma treating you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You make miscalculation. Most humans no wanna fuck gobbo!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No, I didn&#39;t. You wanna be screwed more than anything, yet you&#39;re gonna be hard pressed to find anyone whose gonna! Hey! I could screw you if you want it that bad! In fact, I know you want me to!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Am right.&quot; Jennifer nodded. &quot;Me do wanna Kyle to screw gobbo! Me also observe. It obvious you base Jen Jen gobbo on video game. Jen Jen nothing like gobbos in folktales.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Meh. Got me there. Can&#39;t blame me for going with what&#39;s popular.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You am riding high on justice Kyle-Kyle forget to secure Kyle-Kyle. Transform or Dare.&quot; <br />
<br />
Kyle let out a gasp.<br />
<br />
&quot;If Kyle say &#39;Dare&#39;, gobbo make Kyle think Kyle dog and leave in kennel for rest of life. Kyl-Kyl can guess what transform will be, gobbo know it what Kyl-Kyl want all along. Why else Kyl-Kyl leave curse with gobbo and not even order gobbo to not use curse on him and show up to school?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was captain of the football team before I got cursed by my &#39;best friend&#39; and second-stringer. Made me realize I was a loser and a bully.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Plenty time to compare notes later. Now chose, doggie brain or gobbo?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle sized. He knew better than try to attack Jennifer. To run for his life. The curse twisted fate so there was no way to escape once the words had been spoken. <br />
<br />
&quot;Transform.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For transform, you become gobbo, like Jen-Jen, except guy gobbo. Have manhood to match Jen-Jen&#39;s boobies! It always ready to serve or be served. But even if it hit with big nasty hammer, you not hurt at all. You have no problem going around naked, you like it that way, just like Jen-Jen. No one bother us gobbos &#39;bout it, nor bother &#39;bout gobbos when we screw. Reality retcon so you always sex gobbo!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle shrank down. His clothes vanished except for his backpack. His skin close nearly all its hair except for the top of his head. His skin turned dark green, hard and rubbery. His nose grew huge like his ears were big and wide like a bat&#39;s. His fingers and toes crew pitch back nails. His mouth filled with teeth like a sharp. His eyes lost their pupils becoming deep almost glowing red. His figure became that of a body building, three feet of solid muscle. <br />
<br />
His manhood grew until it was passed his belly and up to his chest, he could rest his chin on it if he wished. <br />
<br />
He felt his mind expand in ways he never even imagined before. Everything had been so simple, so obvious. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wanna screw gobbo?&quot; Where Jen-Jen&#39;s first words.<br />
<br />
Kyl-Kyl nodded and leapt on top of her. Her body easily able to taken in his member as it stabbed into her, only feeling pleasure. Both were hit with shockwaves of pleasure that left their minds wheeling. They humped each other again and again. <br />
<br />
And true to Jen-Jen&#39;s Transform to reality, everyone who saw the goblins making out in the middle of the school day in class didn&#39;t so much as blink. It wasn&#39;t like they hadn&#39;t seen it a million times before. Whatever the pair of hyper-intelligent goblins wanted, they got. <br />
<br />
Finally Kyle and Jen-Jen separated. <br />
<br />
&quot;Gobbo Kyle thank Gobbo Jen. This serious upgrade. Everything improvement. Not believe how dumb human Kyle was.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me know. This not revenge gobbo, this am gratitude.&quot; <br />
<br />
The two goblins looked at the slow-witted humans hurrying, the ones who hadn&#39;t already gotten to their next class. <br />
<br />
Kyle and Jen were not worried. They had the material so perfectly memorized all they needed to do was show up for projects. They could leave green manure in their seats rather than go the bathroom and none would complain. <br />
<br />
Both goblins were thinking the same thing, <br />
&#39;What gobbos do next?&#39;</p>
