<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Cyoc monster dad and monster son story<br />
Upon descending from the mountain, Ron and Nick decided to head back home. They knuckle walked their way back to the house. Since they were very huge, they decided to walk in without opening the back door and so they bashed through it effortlessly. Then, a funny feeling overcame them. More changes were on their way! They grew long sharp gray claws and their ears pointed. Their tails lengthened to about 10 feet and thickened. Their spines on their back grow longer. Their fur gained some yellow, green, and white spots and magenta streaks. Their skin turned medium blue green. Their tongues grew to seven feet long, a foot wide, and much thicker. They could change the size at will. Their posteriors bloated until they were eight inches long and toned. The fur on their head looked more like their default human hairstyles except longer. Their backs sloped like a buffalos. The fur on their bellies turned lavender while most of their fur remained violet. They grew pads on their hands and feet. Afterward, they decided to go on a double date with their respective girlfriends. Ron’s was named Maxine and Nick’s was named Leanna. Maxine was an attractive 5’10’’ woman with luscious black hair, green eyes, and a beautiful body. Leanna was a cute redhead about Nick’s age, with purple eyes. Maxine and Leanna knew each other because they were next door neighbors.<br />
<br />
Ron and Nick called them up, asking if they would like to eat dinner at their house. They both agreed. They altered the settings so that while not in sight of other humans, they were stuck in monster form but while in their sight they were humans as default but could turn into monsters. At about 5, they heard a ring at the doorbell. It was Leanna and Maxine! They knuckle walked over. They shifted to human form in time for them to open the door. The respective couples hugged each other. Leanna asked, “What’s for dinner?” Ron answered, “A mountain of spaghetti and meatballs, an ocean of soda, a football field of ice cream, and huge amounts of pizza, burgers, steak, salad, chili, chicken, and quinoa!” Maxine and Leanna looked at each other in confusion. Leanna asked, “Huh?” Then Maxine spoke to her, “You know Ron. He loves to exaggerate and make jokes like that.” Leanna chuckled. Then Ron and Nick served the dinner. Maxine whispered to Leanna, “Wow. He really did mean it this time.” Then they all proceeded to eat. Then Nick asked, “So, anything going on today?” Leanna replied, “Nothing much. Just knitted a scarf for my cousin.” Maxine replied, “I swam 20 laps in my pool in one hour. You?” Ron answered, “We gained the power to turn into monsters and gained superhuman strength, speed, senses, and athleticism in monster form.” Maxine said, “Hahaha. You always joke about how you wished you could turn into a monster, Ron.” “No really, we mean it this time. You see,” Ron replied, “we found a website that can turn people into monsters temporarily. We used it to select our attributes as monsters, and set it so that it would be until two weeks in that we would start to lose this power and our monster forms would look less monstrous and after three weeks in, we would be 100% normal again.” Leanna replied, “You really do sound like you mean it this time. Would you please show us?” “Sure thing!” Nick answered. Then they started to change in front of the women. First, the guys’ posteriors bloated out until they were about eight inches long. Foot long, medium purple sprouted all over their bodies, except for their lips, the palms of their hands, and the soles of their feet. The hair on their heads turned purple but they retained their hairstyles. The blue, white, green, and yellow spots and magenta streaks appeared on their fur, and their stomach fur turned lavender. Their lips became bigger. Bulges appeared in their pants and grew longer until their monkey tails ripped through their pants and underwear. They lengthened until they were about twelve feet long and six inches thick. They sprouted humongous pink bull horns. Their nails turned into long, sharp, light gray claws. Their ears grew bigger and more pointy. Then, they started to grow taller and wider. This finally caused their clothes to rip apart and fall on the floor, and their shirts, socks, shoes, pants and underwear merged into loincloths, along with all the clothes they owned. They briefly stopped transforming to see if all their clothes were in the loincloths and they looked in their dressers and nothing was there! Then they went back down to the table to continue transforming. They grew until they were 16 feet tall. Their bodies became 10 feet wide. Their hips grew wider to accommodate. They had a few additional changes this time around, such as getting wider, fatter and more muscular to fit their 16 foot tall bodies. Their bellies grew 50 times the size they were in human form because they were gaining a ton of fat. They became really bulky and looked like they were about 10 feet thick when looked at from the side. Their arms became about 9 feet long, and gained about 72 times the muscle they had on when they were human arms. They looked like bodybuilders. Thick pads formed on their hands and feet. Dinosaurlike spines grew on their heads down their backs and along their tails, which then gained tufts at the end. Their heads grew huge to accommodate their huge bodies and horny reptilian ridges grew on their foreheads. Their backs sloped like that of a buffalo. Their jaws elongated into apelike jaws and their noses grew out to form proboscis monkey noses. Their eyes turned bright green. Their legs shortened to about three feet long, which was small for their size. Their feet changed to look like hands. Both their hands and feet exploded with muscle, and grew about five times their original size. Their legs exploded with muscle and were about 50 times more muscular than they were in human form. Their bodies were forced forward like an ape and their forearms became four times the thickness of their upper arms. Their tongues grew seven feet long, much thicker, and a foot wide. Their internal organs shifted around and grew to accommodate their huge bodies. Webbing formed between their toes to help with swimming. Finally, their fangs grew in. They grew a few more teeth, then all their teeth grew huge, slightly jagged, and turned into fangs. What were their canine teeth as humans grew especially large and sharp. Some of them stuck out of their mouths even when closed. Now that they weighed about 10,000 pounds, including 6,000 in muscle, 3,000 in fat, and 1,000 in bone. The chairs they were sitting in collapsed but they could sit on the floor at the table just fine. The girlfriends, who were having fun watching the transformations, were psyched and hugged them. They exclaimed, “Oh my goodness! You meant it when you told us you could turn into monsters! Your monster forms are absolutely huge and strong and fat and muscular and handsome and cute!” Ron and Nick’s fat furry stomachs provided comfort and were soft and Ron and Nick wrapped their long huge thick arms around their girlfriends. The girlfriends started to kiss their respective boyfriends on the lips in a makeout session that lasted 15 minutes. Ron and Nick decided to test their powers out and swallowed their girlfriends harmlessly as their stomachs were huge enough to fit a human and humans inside were in a protective air filled bubble. Their digestive juices also had no effect on humans. They removed them who described it as fascinating. Ron and Nick also tried to use their tails to lift their girlfriends. They wrapped them around them and successfully lifted them. It turned out that any of their hands or feet or their tails could lift pretty much anything, no matter how heavy it was. They also tried to eat with their feet and it worked. Ron and nick also drank ten gallons of the soda each and burped so loudly that all the windows in the house broke, (though nothing else did) a few trees fell down, and the girlfriends’ hair was messed up. The girlfriends looked weirded out but then cheered, saying, “That was awesome!” then hugged and kissed their boyfriends again. Ron and Nick decided to eat all the food and drink all the soda that their girlfriends didn’t drink. They decided to hike a really tall mountain again. Maxine and Leanna got on their apelike monster boyfriends’ huge backs. Then, Ron and Nick knuckle walked to the front door. They ran to the door, then busted right through it harmlessly side by side. There was now a huge, 16 by 20 ft hole in the house where the door once was. In ten minutes, they successfully hiked the 7K mountain from earlier in just ten minutes. They traversed lakes with their new swimming abilities courtesy of their webbed feet, strong limbs, fat to keep them afloat, and their expanded lung capactiy. Maxine and Leanna fell in once, but then Ron and Nick sucked them into their stomachs, where the air bubbles that formed saved them from suffocating. They climbed steep cliffs easily since they were now had long, strong arms and legs and huge hands and feet. Maxine and Leanna were thrilled through the whole thing. Briefly they almost fell to their deaths but then Ron fell one hundred feet to the ground harmlessly and lay flat there so Maxine would land on his soft, fat, furry belly, while Ron climbed down the cliff and grabbed Leanna with his foot. Then he wrapped his tail around her and placed her back on his back. Then after just ten minutes, they reached the top of the mountain! The view was amazing and some birds flew near them and even landed on them. They decided it was time to head back down. Leanna and Maxine asked to stay the night so they could have more fun tomorrow. Ron and Nick, who now had beautiful, deep voices, said yes. So then Ron and Nick used their strength to put the front and back doors back together. Then, Leanna and Maxine each slept in a guest room. Before going to bed they asked, “Do your clothes come back intact when you change back? We’re confused.” They changed back in front of them, and then the clothes they were wearing returned intact, and the clothes in their dressers returned, also intact. They said, “Wow, that’s amazing!” The next day, they all left the house again, this time to swim in the Atlantic Ocean all the way to Italy and back in just three hours. They had a campfire in the woods near the house and ate s’mores. Of course, Ron and Nick ate about seventy five each. Afterward the girlfriends asked if they could be turned into monsters too temporarily.</p>
