<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Frantically, James dialed his doctor&#39;s office and cringed when it went to voicemail. The office was closed! He left a message saying he needed to set up an appointment ASAP. He then paced around looking up skin color changes on his phone again. He scrolled through those med sites for at least a half hour, and they all basically said it was some kind of cancer, but none of the symptoms seemed quite like what he was experiencing. It looked like he had scales, like a reptile. The most recent weird thing he could think of was that carnival and the creepy girl he&#39;d met there. Had she drugged him? Was this an emergency? Should he call an ambulance? Go to a hospital? Or go back to that carnival?<br />
<br />
He was so confused about what was going on that he couldn&#39;t really figure out what to do. He didn&#39;t feel bad, but he looked completely different from head to toe. What was this? But then he dropped his phone, because a burst of surreal sensations overwhelmed him from his groin and from his ass.<br />
<br />
At first, he couldn&#39;t quite put his finger on it. It felt like tubes him were starting to shift, and his butthole was starting to tingle. Then he yelped at once because he felt a testicle pop right inside his body! Then he yelped again because the other one went back up with it! He could feel them in there, like little bubbles that he knew had outside him.<br />
<br />
Breathing quicker now, he yanked his lower garments off and stared at what had become of his genitalia. Sure enough, his dick was there with no balls underneath it. Reaching down he couldn&#39;t even find his ball sack. What on earth was this? And still there was that feeling in his ass.<br />
<br />
Frantically patting the entire space between his penis and his butt, looking for any trace of his scrotum or anything that might have pushed his balls inside him, he finally brushed a hand across his anus. This surprised him, because it wasn&#39;t even behind him any more. It should have been between his butt cheeks, but here it was, only slightly farther back than where his scrotum had just been. And even as he held his hand still against his hole, he could still feel his hand rubbing it as if it were moving? Was his anus moving? Was that the tingling he&#39;d felt? How can that even happen?<br />
<br />
The hole kept inching forward until it was just under beneath his penis. It didn&#39;t hurt, but it was unbearably disorienting to feel his rectum pointing almost in front him! He almost thought the thing was going to get buried up inside his cock somehow, but then the strangest thing happen. His penis started to harden! He didn&#39;t feel at all aroused, but he could stand there stunned and watch his dick become erect. Scratching his head in confusion, he tried to understand why this would happen, but all the while, his forward-facing butt hole started either growing or getting swallowed up by some sort of larger whole that was forming, which before much longer had finally surrounded the base of his penis. James gasped, and then all at once, he felt something like a rubber band go tight inside his hips, and his dick got yanked inside him like his balls had! His whole squeezed shut around it, and he was left staring at an odd slit on the flat, scaly skin of his groin.<br />
<br />
James stared at his slit for another second or two, and then he screamed. And the he screamed again. &quot;What just happened? What just happened? Am I a scaly WOMAN?&quot; he started screeching, clutching his head in disbelief. But even while this was going on, he realized he could still sort of feel his dick inside him, still changing in was he couldn&#39;t figure out, but still as hard as ever. And didn&#39;t girls have three holes? Why did he just have the one?<br />
<br />
James was starting to think that no one could help his with this. At least he didn&#39;t want to show anybody yet. At least not without some kind of idea about how he could even describe it. So at last, curiosity got the better of him, and he built up the courage to start to feel around again. He doesn&#39;t dare to touch that strange new slit of his, at least at first. Instead, he reached around to feel his ass, and got the surprise of his life when he could even feel his cheeks back there! It was just unbroken scaly skin back there, and definitely not a hint of his asshole. So it really had moved. He really was seeing it in front of him. Or if not, it was somewhere down inside whatever he was looking at. But was his cock still in there, too?<br />
<br />
He gulped, and sticking out a single finger, he finally touched his scaly slit. It felt weird to do it, but not as bad as he expected. Actually, it felt kind of okay. Sticking his finger inside there surprised him with a mix of strangeness and actual pleasure. Sexual pleasure. Like his junk was safely tucked inside there after all. In fact, in the midst of all this, James almost felt like he might start getting an erection. But he didn&#39;t actually feel his dick hardening. Instead, he felt strange new muscles inside him trying to sort of force something out of him. Something under his slit swelled and pushed his finger away. He watched his hole get opened wide by his hardened shaft, which was intensely swollen at the base. It looked pale and misshapen, but it was definitely a cock. And it was definitely hard.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, this is too weird,&quot; he chanted, breaking his silence and never having seen a gator&#39;s erection before. All he could think was there was something terribly wrong somehow to see his cock poking out of this hole that he could probably shit out of if he needed to. It didn&#39;t make sense, so he shook his head and relaxed those muscles of his down there. All at once, his dick ducked backed in his slit, as though something were holding in there whenever he was not aroused.<br />
<br />
&quot;I gotta figure this out. I gotta go find that woman, or some kind of doctor, or I don&#39;t know. Can I even go out like this? Who is even gonna know what this is?&quot;<br />
<br />
Little did he know, that several miles away, Kayla was out there looking through a crystal ball, laughing at what she had just seen. &quot;That poor young man doesn&#39;t realize how much I know,&quot; she said. &quot;He&#39;ll come back here after all, I think. Or maybe not. I might go see him if he won&#39;t.&quot;</p>
