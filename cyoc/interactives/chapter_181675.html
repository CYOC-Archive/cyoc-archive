<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Did you see Vince and Tom going at it this morning? Tom&#39;s looking older but that doesn&#39;t seem to be stopping V.&quot; Bryan chuckled a little. Wes just shook his head at the gossip.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, how is it living with the Jansens?&quot; Wes asked as he leaned into Bryan as they walked along. Bryan had an arm around Wes&#39; shoulder, and honestly Wes liked the way that muscular arm rested along his shoulders. It was steady and solid, unlike so many things around the school nowadays.<br />
<br />
&quot;Weird.&quot; Bryan responded quickly. &quot;They act like I&#39;ve always been there, been their other son. Ross is the only one that seems to know something isn&#39;t quite right, but he doesn&#39;t seem to care. It&#39;s like, the older the wish gets the more it seems normal to everyone.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wes nodded. He was thinking the same thing. His own home life had changed. He still lived in his old home with his old parents, but he was adopted now. Not that they treated him any different, but it was an odd change to explain away the differences in him. So many people were changing in the school, but none were quite as drastic as him and Bryan. But their changes caused the least stir. Maybe Bryan was right, once the changes ended things started to settle.<br />
<br />
Even Wes was starting to accept things. He was happier when he didn&#39;t fight it. All these others going on though, it just kept stirring the pot and even if people accepted some of the changes, they noticed them.<br />
<br />
The two headed for the locker room. They had a free period before gym started, and Bryan wanted to spend the time lifting weights and pushing his new body to its limit with Wes helping him out. Wes watched Bryan strip down with a smile, and when Bryan noticed he pressed Wes up against a locker, neither wearing anything but their underwear, firmly kissing him. &quot;I thought you wanted to lift weights.&quot; Wes said when Bryan shoved his hand into Wes&#39; boxers, grabbing at his cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is a weight.&quot; Bryan quipped, giving Wes&#39; thick cock a squeeze. But after a couple teasing strokes he broke off and went back to get dressed.<br />
<br />
Wes cursed in Spanish under his breath. Bryan enjoyed getting him worked up, and now he&#39;d probably be walking around with a boner for the next hour while trying to work out himself. Wes gave a long sigh and slipped into his gym shorts, pulling on the tee over it. Bryan was now similarly dressed, Wes rubbed a hand along Bryan&#39;s chest before the two went out of the locket room and over to the weight room.<br />
<br />
Surprisingly the room was occupied. Wes didn&#39;t recognize the man on the fly machine. Probably in his late twenties, he had a well-muscled and well-toned physique verging on that of an amateur body builder. His hair was raven black even though it was cut short it still looked thick. He noticed Bryan and Wes easily enough. &quot;Hey boys. Let me finish this set and I&#39;ll get out of your hair. Didn&#39;t know anyone wanted the room this period.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wes knew that voice though. And now that he looked at the man&#39;s face, mentally added a couple decades. &quot;Coach..&quot; Wes said uncertainly, Bryan looking just as baffled by the man as Wes felt. Bryan&#39;s expression was almost comical when he figured it out from Wes&#39; one word. After a few more clanks of the weights, Coach Mason hopped off the machine. &quot;Sorry, boys, I just needed to burn off a little energy, I haven&#39;t felt this good in years. Enjoy.&quot; He gave Bryan a meaty slap on the shoulder and headed towards his office.<br />
<br />
&quot;Want me to take care of that for you?&quot; Wes asked a shell-shocked Bryan who was now sporting his own erection clearly visible through the soft fabric of his shorts. Bryan just nodded and Wes grinned, he pulled down Bryan&#39;s shorts and set to work. He really was getting used to his new life.<br />
<br />
-------------------------<br />
<br />
Coach Mason pretended not to notice the two teens at full mast from watching him work out. As a teacher it was something he learned to ignore, especially when he had to deal with a bunch of sex-crazed teens in a gym class. He had been there himself once, best to just ignore it and move on. It was hard with those two, though, both were packing.<br />
<br />
But not as much as the man who was waiting for him in his office when he stepped inside. Kendall sat in one of the chairs facing Mason&#39;s desk, nervously bouncing a leg. Mason was used to some of the boys coming to him for advice, but usually it was the jocks. Brainier students usually had other professors to bother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kendall.&quot; Mason said as he walked by.<br />
<br />
The man gave a jolt, not having heard the office door open. Alone with Kendall for the first time in.. well.. ever. Mason actually took stock of the man. He didn&#39;t look like a teen, not with that build and face. He almost matched Mason himself in size, almost.<br />
<br />
&quot;Coach. I, um, sorry, I couldn&#39;t think of anyone else to talk to.&quot; Kendall fidgeted a little, shifting in his chair as he looked the sweaty Coach up and down. &quot;I...&quot; He hesitated. &quot;I needed to talk to a teacher that doesn&#39;t think grades and graduation are everything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah.&quot; Mason said with a nod as he leaned against his desk, facing Kendall. It was true enough, he was one of the few on staff that didn&#39;t mind telling students that academia wasn&#39;t for anyone, and helped a few of his boys sign up for trade schools or apprenticeships instead. &quot;Kendall. You&#39;re one of the top students in the school. I&#39;m sure you&#39;re going to be fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not anymore.&quot; Kendall said with a shake of his head, his speech was slower, more deliberate. &quot;Whatever is going on in the school, I&#39;m not.. I mean I can&#39;t.. I..&quot; Kendall let out a growl of frustration and pounded his fist on the arm rest of the chair, the wood gave a little creak but thankfully didn&#39;t break.<br />
<br />
Mason leaned forward and grabbed Kendall by the shoulders. God they were solid, his fingers barely pressed into the other man&#39;s skin, like grabbing a pair of rocks. Mason felt his cock stirring and tried to direct his thoughts elsewhere. This was a student, as much as he didn&#39;t seem to look like one. &quot;Shh.. Take your time. It&#39;s alright.&quot;<br />
<br />
-------------------------------<br />
<br />
Kendall was reacting to the touch as well, calming and relaxing. It felt good, a strong, smarter man telling him everything was going to be alright. It felt like how it should be, someone to look out for him. The coach was a good looking man, too, he felt his cock firming against the denim of his overalls. Kendall pushed back those thoughts and stood up. &quot;Sorry, this was a mistake. I shouldn&#39;t have come here.&quot; Coach&#39;s hands were still firm on his shoulders though.<br />
<br />
Thinking was getting harder by the hour. It already felt like he was thinking through cotton compared to how his mind used to be. But he let coach push him back down into the chair. &quot;I&#39;m just feeling out of place, Coach. Like I don&#39;t belong here anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mason crossed his arms over his chest and looked Kendall up and down. &quot;You know, manual labor is good for both clearing the head and putting things into focus. If you really think that might be where your future is.&quot; The coach reached into his desk and pulled out forty bucks, holding it out to Kendall. &quot;You have a free period right now?&quot; Kendall nodded, staring at the money curiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Groundskeeper quit a week back and I need the field lines redrawn before tomorrow&#39;s game. I was going to do it, but I think it might be good if I give you the chance, work out some of this frustration. Money&#39;s a bonus.&quot; Kendall licked his lips as he looked at the forty bucks, then grabbed it and tucked it in the front pocket of his overalls.<br />
<br />
Coach Mason grinned at that, and took the key for the storage shed off a hook on the wall and handed it to Kendall. &quot;I&#39;ll come down and check in on you in a bit.</p>
