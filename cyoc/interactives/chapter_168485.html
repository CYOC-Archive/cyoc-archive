<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Well, first things first.<br />
<br />
Troy had to show off how jacked he was now in comparison to before, even though it was just a few inches across the board, he felt that it was as a whole enough to completely change the impression of him. He knew a couple of the guys like fucking Cliff were gonna be working out there. He chuckled and looked down at his new and improved physique, &quot;Won&#39;t they be surprised to see &quot;Teeny Troy&quot; looking so much more impressive.&quot; For some reason though, the thought of looking so much bigger next to Cliff was turning him on, and Troy gulped as he watched his manhood erect in his boxers. &quot;Hot damn, my cock&#39;s bigger...can&#39;t wait to give it to my girlfriend tonight.&quot; <br />
<br />
Troy got dressed in a stringer shirt and shorts, checking himself out in the mirror again, not even minding that his manhood hadn&#39;t gone down yet. Heh, he thought, maybe advertising that I&#39;m a stud ready for a lay might open up my options beyond my girlfriend! Troy noted as he stepped outside that his sense of smell seemed heightened. Everything seemed just a bit keener, more noticeable. He wondered if this was some sort of side effect of Equinox, and mused it wasn&#39;t even so bad.<br />
<br />
As Troy got into the car, he was acutely aware of how oddly...closed in it was to be in a car like this. He&#39;d never felt this uncomfortable before just getting into his own car. Aw well, maybe it was just the size increase, he was gonna have to get used to things not fitting quite as well as they did before. As Troy drove off, he thought about how enjoyable it was gonna be to show up Cliff there. If he saw Cliff doing 315 on bench, he was gonna go for 325. He trusted he could make it---<br />
<br />
And again, just thinking about these kinds of masculine contests caused Troy to start to feel aroused again.<br />
<br />
Maybe he just needed...a pitstop. Yeah just a pitstop to take the edge off so he wouldn&#39;t have any embarrassing incidents at the gym. Troy parked his car on the side of the road, near some trees, and fished out his errant, demanding organ. He swore the foreskin on it looked slightly thicker than usual... ah who cares, it looked and felt fuckin&#39; sensitive and this was gonna be good!<br />
<br />
Before long Troy was propping himself up on his seat, arm over the passenger side headrest as his other arm jerked his manhood, polishing the head, rubbing all the way to the base, and groaning. Fuuuck, this felt amazing. If this was how it was gonna be from now on, he loved how this was looking to be... <br />
<br />
He felt his muscular physique with one hand, all the while the other pulsed up and down on his manhood, the sensitive head looking large and prominent. A little larger than he remembered, but it wasn&#39;t a tremendous enough difference for Troy to look at it any differently. He just wanted to cum. His body was just driving him up the wall, feeling how muscular he was now. Knowing he was bigger and stronger than Cliff, and that his girlfriend would just be wowed by how big and buff he was. Hell, he could probably fuck Cliff too---woah wait that was kinda weirdly gay, Troy mused to himself... though he did not get much time to ruminate.<br />
<br />
Troy felt it surging up inside of him. His orgasm, all at once! He gasped and scrambled, his cock dribbling precum. He managed to get the door open, and let out a breath.<br />
<br />
He sprayed his cum all over the ground, grinning to himself as he finally felt assuaged. He breathed at first uneasily, and then eased back into his usual. The emission looked thicker and different in some way. Troy wondered if it might be an effect or if it was just the way it spread on the ground. Troy shrugged at any rate.<br />
<br />
Troy fixed up his shorts and made sure his dick was inside his boxers, and then headed back out on the road to the gym. Thankfully for now he was not in need of any more pitstops.<br />
<br />
By the time he got to the gym, he was heading in just in time to catch Cliff heading in as well. Cliff was large, but not entirely toned. His cannonball biceps as he called them were free of striation and any veins, and while he had amazing broad shoulders, pecs and a solid back, his gut was rather tellingly large. However, Cliff was blessed with a sturdy, powerfully muscled ass, jacked legs, and strong calves. Enough to make him surprisingly fast on the field. As the two guys ran into each other, Cliff looked Troy over, clearly astonished by how much muscle Troy had put on in such a short amount of time. &quot;D-Dude! Where&#39;d all this come from!? You uhh...you sure all this is natty, bro? Coach would have your head on a platter if---&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, chillax. It&#39;s all good. I&#39;m not on any steroids.&quot; Troy said with a coy grin at Cliff. Yeah, it seemed Cliff couldn&#39;t keep his eyes off of Troy&#39;s body, and Troy wondered if Cliff might be gay or bi or something. Even as they stepped inside, Troy looked back at the incredulous fellow jock, &quot;You mirin&#39;, bro?&quot; He said with a follow up flex of his bicep.<br />
<br />
&quot;...Yeah dude, I&#39;m mirin&#39;.&quot; Cliff said in an uneasy tone. He seemed to be doubtful about something, maybe the fact Troy was supposedly all natural, but he went along and checked in at the front desk.<br />
<br />
Before long, Troy and Cliff were getting ready for their workout, Troy feeling pretty strong right now and wondering if he could show Cliff up right in front of him. Which he could do if he went with the same workout as the other jock. He contemplated. Should he do his own workout and show off that way? Or should he go about a similar workout to Cliff, and make it really clear who was top jock around here...</p>
