<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Twist of events, Chris, John, Mike and Moth at doll size<br />
<br />
The Pleasure Island managers have notice some irregularity about Wyatt shrinking process. They’ve heard that the shrunken teen may has not being informed properly because he was maybe intoxicated by some substance such alcohol, and he never really verbally or signed up any agreement before being shrunk. In a matter of fact, the staff just took his friends&#39; word for it.  So the security squad rushed to where they were to investigate. The main agent carried Wyatt to a more private place and asked him:<br />
<br />
“My question is simple, have you or have you not agreed for being shrunken to that doll size?”<br />
<br />
The teen was in a very difficult situation and didn’t want to cause any troubles to his friends. But he was not a good liar, so he kind of turned them in.<br />
<br />
“Nope they have not as told me I could be shrunk when they invited me to come with them here. They definitively deceived me, made me shrunk to have their fun with me. But I have to say that they have not hurt me at all. They were relatively nice, well as long it pleased them though. But I do not wish to deposit any complain against them at this point. But can you make me grow back?”<br />
<br />
The agent informed Wyatt that they have strict rules there for never ever shrink anyone against his will. The consequences would be to shrink down the transgressors and may being given to his victim’s custody.  That new information have set a fire in Wyatt’s imagination. He always wanted to have Chris tiny, and now he could, and as bonus also having John, Moth and Mike. <br />
<br />
“Lets do that then!”, giggled Wyatt<br />
<br />
In no time, several security agents escorted the silly teen to the shrinking chamber, but first they grown back Wyatt. <br />
<br />
“NO NO please Wyatt, forgive us, all we wanted was to have some fun with you, we didn’t mean any harm to you!” Cried Chris. But Wyatt was too aroused to even consider to change his mind. <br />
<br />
He saw his 4 questionable friends being pushed inside the chamber. From a view screen, he was able to see them shrinking 1/6 or their original size. Their clothes shrunk with them though. Then a valet brought their belongings from their hotel room, and they shrunk those too.  Chris, John, Mike and Moth were very upset, accusing each other and tried to put the blame on someone. They even began to have a fist fight. But a security agent have separated them without much difficulty as they were at a doll size then. A member of the shrinking process staff have provided a thick cardboard box padded with blue quilted velvet. <br />
<br />
A technician has been assigned to put the shrunken guys inside. The tiny teens were horrified to see him towering them, so they tried to runaway but there were nowhere to hide. Besides, he was not very good looking, in his mid 50’s and looked like a mean guy. The first one who has been grabbed was Moth. He screamed as loud he could, but he found himself inside the box. The second one was Chris, and he was squirming and kicking a lot. The old man, to show him he was no fit to resist much, squished the tiny guys genital just hard enough to make his point. “Hey you faggot, leave my dick alone, you pervert!”, said Chris in his very homophobic self. But the man was not impressed and put him with Moth in the box.  Then he captured Mike and held him in his left fist and John was in his right one. To the giant man’s surprise, they acted in a very passive way, they were like rag dolls. Then the man put the lid on the box, carried it outside the chamber and gave it to a very happy Wyatt.<br />
<br />
For some reasons, the grown-back teen was more in the mood of celebrating than going to the hotel room with his 4 tiny guys right away.  In a matter of fact, a member of the Pleasure Island staff told him that there was a place to meet other guys with tiny companions and have some fun. Inside the box, the shrunken teens heard and feared for the worst. As Wyatt was walking to that place, they were slightly shacked, so they were not able to stand up.<br />
<br />
Wyatt entered a building but the specific place he was seeking was in the basement of the restaurant. The more he was descending, the darker it was. Passing a double barn door, he walked inside and saw a large circular table with people seated around, but in the middle was a bartender. (doughnut shape) There were also other smaller tables, restaurant benches, and privates booth of different sizes.  He noticed that the persons were very affectionate, touching each others, nicely talking, passing from table to table to meet with as much others they could.<br />
<br />
One of the host of the place walked Wyatt to a small table for 4 persons. “As I presume it’s your first time, the best way to meet others is to seat here with your tiny guy or (guys), and you can be 100% sure someone will ask you if you are agree to talk and even play a little.”,The nice man said. The teen smiled, thanked him and ordered a large lemonade and 4 tiny juice for his tiny pals.<br />
<br />
Inside the box, they all heard but they began to think to try to runaway, but how. Suddenly they saw a dim light flooding the box as Wyatt removed the lid. “Here your tiny drinks, you sure are all thirsty”, Said Wyatt giving them tiny plastic glasses filled with cold juice. The teens appreciated to have beverages, so they drank it. <br />
<br />
Then, out of the blue,  Wyatt reached down at Chris with is hand to pick him up.<br />
<br />
“Hello, so you wanted to see my genital and you kept me naked, right? I think it’s my turn to do the same you did to me as all your friends were watching.”, said Wyatt.<br />
<br />
At the very moment tiny Chris was hand held and out of the box, two young teen boys approached to introduce them self. One of them was Kevin, the other one was Alfred. Kevin was holding his 35 years old shrunken former swimming team coach wearing in his left fist. The tiny man was wearing red Speedo.  Alfred was playing with a nerdy teen boy around 16-17 years old who worn glasses, blue shirt and beige trousers. <br />
<br />
“May we seat and meet you and your tiny pal?” Alfred asked on also behalf of his friend.  Wyatt nodded with a smile and said:<br />
<br />
“Sure thing, be seated, Alfred and Kevin, you are welcome. Nice to meet you, my name is Wyatt. I have 4 tiny pals actually. Before today, they tricked me, and made me get shrunk without my consent. They has been punished I grown back and now they are in my custody. The one I hold is Chris, a very homophobic guy who play nice, but do lots of gay stuff for a straight man. Inside the box are his friends who was part of the plot of having me tiny just for their own fun. Look inside, there is Moth, Mike and John.”<br />
<br />
Kevin replied, very shocked: “OH Gee man, I’m so sorry you has been tricked. But it’s pay back time, right? I can assure you, our tiny pals were all perfectly consent”<br />
<br />
Wyatt smiled as he began to strip Chris bare naked who yelled while squirming: “NO WAY stop that, they are perfect strangers,  at least you know all of us!”  But too bad for him, it was to much fun to do it. The former tiny 35 years old coach in Kevin’s fist was very aroused to see Wyatt undressing that other tiny teen boy. His giant pal felt his tiny dick getting hard. So he pulled down the tiny Speedo to play with the little boner. Alfred was snuggling his face against his tiny teen nerd<br />
<br />
Then...</p>
