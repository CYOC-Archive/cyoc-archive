<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nancy’s house was only two blocks away and the real Nancy had no hesitation walking that distance after dark. However for Chris the walk was terrifying. Firstly she was not used to her body. Bits of her she wasn’t meant to have were wobbling as she walked. Her centre of gravity was different. There was also a gentle breeze blowing which caused her dress to billow. Worst was the feeling of helplessness. She was now a weak female. She imagined a rapist hiding behind each tree. She knew how good she looked and imagined she was the target of every creep in town. <br />
<br />
She tried to hurry but that just made her boobs bounce more. She got to the end of the street only to see the street lights were out. Something was rustling in the trees and she freaked out. She turned and ran back to her own or should we say Tanya’s house. <br />
<br />
Nancy or “Chris” had returned upstairs to Tanya’s room where he was telling Mary about what it was like to have a penis. As a matter of fact he was demonstrating how big it had grown and “Mary” was looking for a ruler to measure it with. “Mary” figured that as she was no longer a blood relation of “Chris” it was okay to touch. <br />
<br />
However they were interrupted by frantic knocking on the front door. ‘Put it away and go and see what that is about’ suggested Tanya. <br />
<br />
Mrs Morrison had been about to go to bed herself when the knocking started.  She looked through the peep hole and saw a frightened looking Nancy. She quickly opened the door ‘Nancy, did you forget something?’<br />
<br />
‘Mu…Mrs Morrison….. Sorry I got spooked. There was something or someone in the trees and all of a sudden I didn’t want to be alone in the dark’<br />
<br />
‘Oh you poor girl. Come in. Should I call the police?’<br />
<br />
‘No I’m sure I just panicked it was probably just a cat or something’<br />
<br />
‘Would you like me to drive you home?’ <br />
<br />
‘No. I’ll be fine. I just need to compose myself’ Mrs Morrison gave “Nancy” a comforting cuddle<br />
<br />
“Chris” had heard the conversation from the top of the stairs. Feeling brave he quickly bound down the stairs.<br />
<br />
‘What are you doing back here Nancy? What’s the matter?’<br />
<br />
‘I just got spooked. Must have been a cat in the trees’ “Nancy” replied with what she hoped was a sheepish grin on her face. <br />
<br />
‘I could walk you home’<br />
<br />
‘Um. That’s very gentlemanly of you’ Chris thought it a very good idea ‘I accept’<br />
<br />
‘How about a cup of tea first’ suggested Mrs Morrison.<br />
<br />
‘It will be fine Mum’ suggested “Chris” ‘Nancy was just telling us how she needed to be home for a 10.30 curfew. We wouldn’t want her to get into trouble’<br />
<br />
‘Well you two get going in that case. I’ll ring your Mum and explain. She can have a warm drink waiting for you when you get home’<br />
<br />
‘I’ll get some shoes on’ said the real Nancy. He was still in bare feet.<br />
<br />
“Nancy” waited downstairs with Mrs Morrison while “Chris” ran back upstairs. He was loving how in this body he could walk up 4 steps at a time. He felt so strong. It took him several minutes to locate Chris socks and put some shoes on. He loved the idea of walking the real Chris home. It made him feel like a knight looking after a damsel in distress. The only problem was that thinking about Chris in her dark blue dress was making his penis enlarge once more.<br />
<br />
He tucked the penis as much as possible and made his way downstairs once more. Not wanting to alert Mrs Morrison to his erection. He went straight to the front door and called out ‘Ready when you are Nancy’<br />
<br />
Chris had spent an awkward couple of minutes with her Mum. Mum had made her sit on an armchair and was asking her questions about Nancy’s family. Questions she didn’t know the answer to. <br />
<br />
When “Chris” called out that he was ready, Nancy was up in a shot. Calling out ‘Goodnight Mrs Morrison’ as she bustled to the door. <br />
<br />
Mrs Morrison walked to the door herself and watched the two teenagers walking down the drive. She was proud that Chris had volunteered to walk Nancy home. He was turning out alright. The two kids were chatting to each other as they walked. Nancy had seemed very ill at ease when she had been sitting on the couch but in Chris’s company she seemed more relaxed. She wondered if a bit of puppy love was at play. She went back and dialled Jenny’s number to tell her that her daughter was on the way and explain why she might be just a little late. The two mothers had often chatted about how Chris and Nancy were well suited to each other.<br />
<br />
Chris did feel much more comfortable having a big strong body accompany her on the walk back to the Spencer residence. She down played her panic attack but Nancy was enjoying being the gentleman. He took her hand as they negotiated around some puddles on the sidewalk. Chris didn’t mind as it did make her feel safe. She had been spooked pretty badly when she had been walking alone and her breathing was only just back under control.<br />
<br />
Their hands stayed together as they negotiated the street without lights. The sidewalk was pretty rough and Chris stumbled at one point. Nancy’s strong arm prevented her from falling over. ‘Are you okay?’ he asked. <br />
<br />
‘I twisted my ankle, but I don’t think it is anything serious’ Chris replied.<br />
<br />
However the ankle was sore and she appreciated the strong arm around her waist, supporting her. <br />
<br />
Nancy couldn’t believe how nice it felt to have an arm around Chris’s waist. He could feel the dress sliding against her skin as her hips swayed. Of course this did not help his erection. It felt like his crotch was about to burst. ‘I don’t know how you can live with this penis. It constantly wants to get out’ he told Chris<br />
<br />
‘I call him “Mr Percival”’ giggled Chris. ‘I can guess how you must be feeling. I know it can get painful when you can’t get relief’<br />
<br />
‘So how do I get relief?’ asked Nancy.<br />
<br />
‘When you get back to my room. There are some magazines underneath my bottom drawer. Pull the drawer out and you will see them. Look at the pictures and just do what comes naturally. You have my permission. Just try not to make too much of a mess. It would be worthwhile to have some tissues handy’<br />
<br />
‘Well I suppose I should give you permission to explore your body. You’re a virgin so please don’t stick anything inside’ Nancy told Chris. ‘But I imagine you will enjoy touching my nub’<br />
<br />
Chris hadn’t actually thought too much about her new anatomy. Perhaps she just had not had time. There had been too many other priorities. She had cupped her breasts when she had first put the bra on and that had been pretty exciting but she hadn’t even looked at what she had down below when she had put the panties on. The possibilities now flooded her mind.<br />
<br />
‘Well we are almost there. If your Mum rang mine then Mum will be waiting at the door, so we probably should separate for the remainder of the journey. I’ve enjoyed holding your hand. I’d like to do it again when we are back in our own bodies’<br />
<br />
‘Well goodbye I guess. Thanks for walking with me’<br />
<br />
‘No I’ll walk you to the door. I want to check out that ankle. I have a basketball game to play on Sunday. Look Mum is there’<br />
<br />
Chris looked up. Mrs Spencer was outside her door walking towards them. ‘So I call her Mum?’<br />
<br />
‘Yes. Her name is Angela but call her Mum’<br />
<br />
The ankle was sore so “Chris” took her hand once more to steady her. However this time he just held her steady. No more more having a sly grope as Mum neared. ‘She stood in a pot hole and twisted her ankle’ “Chris” explained as the woman approached.<br />
<br />
Angela bent down and examined her daughter’s ankle. Then came up tut-tutting ‘This doesn’t look good. Chris you’re a big strong man. She shouldn’t be walking on this. I want you to pick Nancy up and carry her inside. Follow me. We will take her straight to her bedroom’<br />
<br />
Nancy didn’t need a second invitation. She wanted to test out her new found strength. She knew that although her true body was tall she was relatively skinny. Chris’s body should be able to lift her 130 pounds. <br />
<br />
It proved exceedingly easy to lift Chris. It became even easier when Mum told “Nancy” to ‘help Chris by clasping him around the neck’<br />
Nancy effortlessly carried the girl into what was really his bedroom but he had to pretend that he didn’t know the layout of the house. Mum had him deposit “Nancy” on the bed after removing the bedspread. He got a quick glimpse of the ankle in good light. It appeared to be swollen.<br />
<br />
‘Thank-you Chris you’re a real gentleman. I can take it from here’ it took a moment for Nancy to realise he was being dismissed. Mum was sending Chris home. He stood there dumbfounded for a second before regaining his composure. <br />
<br />
‘Sure thing Mrs Spencer. Good night “Nancy” let’s hope that isn’t as bad as it looks. Umm I’ll see myself out<br />
’<br />
As he left the room he bumped into his older sister who had come in to see what the commotion was about. She was wearing a sexy red chemise. <br />
<br />
Nancy left and began the short walk back to the Morrison house.<br />
<br />
Chris looked at her ankle slightly alarmed at how it had swollen so quickly. It looked nasty. She was amazed she had been able to walk any distance on it.<br />
<br />
‘Who’s the hunk?’ asked a female voice. Chris looked up to see an attractive looking girl in a red chemise. He knew this must be Nancy’s older sister who was home from college. Alison was her name.<br />
<br />
‘That’s Tanya’s little brother. Chris is his name’ Mrs Spencer replied. ‘He’s certainly growing into impressive young man’ <br />
<br />
‘Nice’ said Alison ‘But too young for me. I’m impressed little sis’ Chris felt herself blushing. For the first time she realised just how attractive her true body was.<br />
<br />
‘I’ll get some ice for that ankle Nance’ said her mum ‘It could well be broken. I’ll get you to the doctor first thing in the morning’<br />
<br />
‘It will be alright Mum. It doesn’t feel so bad now I’m no longer putting weight on it’ Chris was alarmed as first thing in the morning was when she was getting her own male body back.<br />
<br />
‘Lets get the doctor to decide that’ Mrs Spencer left the room.<br />
<br />
Chris realised she was in deep shit when she finally tried to stand again. Her ankle could not take any weight. “Mum” had to help her to the toilet but at least she left the room when Chris was seated. There was no opportunity to examine her groin with Mrs Spencer hovering outside the door waiting to be called back in to help her to her feet once she was finished.<br />
<br />
Finding the right muscles to urinate was more difficult than Chris expected but when she finally got it her bladder voided with a rush. At least defecating worked the same whether you were male or female.<br />
<br />
Mrs Spencer returned when summoned and supported her when Chris washed her hands and cleaned Nancy’s teeth. She was then supported back to Nancy’s room where “Mum” had her stand on her good leg while the dress was removed the bra taken off and a pink nightgown similar in style to the one Alison was wearing was put over her head. She was then helped back to the bed and the ice-pack was removed. Mrs Spencer pulled the doona over Chris, gave her a kiss on the forehead and turned off the light. She left the bedroom door open saying ‘If you need anything Nancy just call. Don’t try getting out of bed on your own’<br />
<br />
Chris lay there thinking about how she could get back to her own house in the morning. It seemed impossible. She might be stuck as Nancy for longer than she had anticipated. <br />
<br />
At least she now had an opportunity to feel her breasts and locate that “Nub” Nancy had mentioned.</p>
