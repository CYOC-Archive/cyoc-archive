<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I only managed to give five semen samples that first time. Then I got dressed, kissed Blake, and went to class. I couldn&#39;t concentrate during class. I was distracted by questions of why I was letting Tim and Paul get semen samples from me.<br />
<br />
My next visit with Blake started like my last visit. I stripped as soon as I walked in the door. He shrunk me. He went to his notebook to ignore me. I climbed him and sat on his shoulder. My large genitals made the climb difficult but not impossible.<br />
<br />
Blake went to kiss me but got a face full of my genitals. He set me on his desk, readjusted the shrink ray, and shot me causing my genitals to shrink to match the rest of me proportionally.<br />
<br />
I asked, &quot;I thought you liked my large genitals.&quot;<br />
<br />
He said, &quot;Sometimes, I have thought I would like you to be one foot tall with normal sized genitals. Sometimes, I have thought of making you more mouse like or smaller. There are many ideas that float through my mind but so far, I like you best this way.&quot;<br />
<br />
I climbed his arm back to his shoulder and gave him a kiss. He kissed me back and started petting me.<br />
<br />
Then the phone rang. Blake answered it and the more he talked, the tenser he became. I couldn&#39;t tell what he was talking about since his end of the conversation was mostly, &quot;Yes, sir.&quot; and &quot;I&#39;ll be there.&quot;<br />
<br />
I asked, &quot;Who was that.&quot;<br />
<br />
He said, &quot;That was the dean. They are convening a formal meeting to discuss the shrink ray.&quot;<br />
<br />
I asked, &quot;Do you have to go?&quot;<br />
<br />
He said, &quot;They invited me but yes, I have to go.&quot;<br />
<br />
I asked, &quot;Why? It&#39;s your invention.&quot;<br />
<br />
He said, &quot;They&#39;ve been calling me every day since the invention went public. People have been wanting to know how you became so small. Haven&#39;t people been calling you too?&quot;<br />
<br />
I said, &quot;Yes, most of them want my autograph. Some of them want to do kinky things with me. Some have asked how I got so small.&quot;<br />
<br />
Blake said, &quot;Yes and you probably told them I shrunk you. From day one, they&#39;ve been interrogating me to find out exactly how I did it and what I plan to do with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
I asked, &quot;Literally?&quot;<br />
<br />
Blake said, &quot;No, but I feel interrogated.&quot;<br />
<br />
I asked, &quot;So are you going to go to this meeting?&quot;<br />
<br />
Blake said, &quot;Yes. I think this will be a time to work out some arrangements so they&#39;ll stop pressuring me. I&#39;m still not looking forward to it.&quot;<br />
<br />
I asked, &quot;Do you want me to come with you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Blake said, &quot;I&#39;d like that. I don&#39;t feel like working on my inventions tonight. You want some ice cream?&quot;<br />
<br />
He took me out for ice cream but we ran into trouble at the restaurant. First they complained about my nudity quoting, &quot;No shoes, No shirt&quot;. When Blake tried to pass me off as a pet, the waiter said, &quot;...only service animals that are specifically trained...&quot;. Then the waiter went on a tirade about how fake service animals cause problems for people with real disabilities like his cousin who&#39;s dog has been trained to spot the signs of a seizure before his cousin falls. I had to wait outside while Blake got our ice cream to go and we left. This meant having to explain my situation to random strangers but that went okay. I just continued to play the animal and some of them even pet me.<br />
<br />
We still managed to have a good time although I was banned from entering most businesses where people go for fun. Then we had another sleepover and I slept in my shoebox. I studied his face as I drifted off to sleep, his sapphire blue eyes, the gentle curve of his nose, the soft curve of his jawline.<br />
<br />
The conference the next day was held in a medium sized meeting room. The dean was there as well as several members of the college staff. Tim and several of the biologists were there. Tim must have invited Pete but the dean than asked Pete to leave. &quot;This is not open to the public but only to those who have a relevant involvement in this matter.&quot; Then the dean looked at me and said, &quot;I think we can allow your lab rat although he wasn&#39;t invited. This concerns him as much as it concerns you.&quot; The rest of the committee agreed and I got nervous.<br />
<br />
Once the committee started, one of the first people to speak was Josiah, a psychologist and academic counselor. &quot;Now, Blake, I can tell you&#39;re nervous and you don&#39;t need to be. You&#39;re not in trouble. We&#39;re all delighted that you invented a shrink ray. We&#39;re having this meeting because we are concerned for you and not in any way upset with you. The implications of inventing a shrink ray are bigger than you may realize and we&#39;re looking out for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
I looked over to where Tony sat. He was passive as usual but I got the sense that he had been talking to Josiah before the conference.<br />
<br />
Much of the conference was formal jargon that didn&#39;t say anything such as the chairperson saying, &quot;The floor recognizes...&quot;<br />
<br />
Silas, the head of physics said, &quot;I find it annoying how arrogant the biologists in this college get. You biologists often act like your science is the foundation for all other sciences. Although we work together and should listen to each other, you biologists often expect us to listen to you but you frequently ignore anything we have to say that isn&#39;t a repetition of what you say. Now, you will listen. Blake is not a biologist. He&#39;s a technologist which isn&#39;t even a science. Although science and technology are related, even interdependent, Blake isn&#39;t one of yours. In fact, his technology falls more in the realm of physics than it does in biology so he ought to be coming to us with this shrink ray instead of taking it to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
After some pointless arguing between the physics department and the biology department, Silas directed a question at Blake, &quot;How did you handle the problem of mass?&quot;<br />
<br />
Blake said, &quot;I did a combination. I partly condensed mass so that he has more density than he would normally have for his size. I did that so he wouldn&#39;t be so fragile. But to keep him from being too heavy, I let some of his mass escape into the atmosphere.&quot;<br />
<br />
Silas asked, &quot;So he&#39;s permanently shrunk?&quot;<br />
<br />
Blake said, &quot;Oh no. I never try any invention unless I&#39;m confident I can reverse it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Silas asked, &quot;So where does the mass come from when you reverse the process.&quot;<br />
<br />
Blake said, &quot;I tapped into the other dimensions. You know that matter, even though it cannot travel as fast as light, can travel fast enough to seem like it appears out of nowhere. I used forces from the other dimension to attract matter from that seeming nowhere.&quot;<br />
<br />
Silas began choking and grabbed his glass of water. Finally he said, &quot;You just simply used other dimensional forces to extract matter from the seeming nowhere? We can&#39;t even identify what those other dimensions are. Many scientist don&#39;t even believe those other dimensions exist because we have no way to prove their existence beyond a mere theory but you just tapped into those other dimensional forces?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tony asked to address the question and said, &quot;This is why we usually leave Blake to himself. There is no question that he is a genius and that he understands the universe far better than he can explain it to the rest of us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Silas had to excuse himself and he abruptly left the conference.<br />
<br />
After a while, Holden, a general from the Pentagon spoke. &quot;My concern is the potential for turning this into a weapon. Blake, can you tell me the usefulness of your shrink ray as a weapon.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tim spoke up and said, &quot;If I may be allowed to help Blake answer, the shrink ray can be used as a weapon but it is not a very efficient weapon. With the cost of manufacturing a shrink ray and the difficulty of using it, most people will still prefer to use a simple gun. I think the only ones who would be interested in weaponizing a shrink ray would be those who specifically do not want to kill such as the police. They would more likely use it in the same way they use Tasers now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Blake added, &quot;Besides, so far I&#39;m the only one who even knows how to operate the shrink ray. I&#39;ve tried to teach Tim but he keeps handing it back for me to operate. If anyone were to steal it, they wouldn&#39;t know how to use it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Holden said, &quot;All the same, we are still going to monitor you to make sure it isn&#39;t stolen. We&#39;ll agree that it&#39;s a low security risk but it is still a risk.&quot;<br />
<br />
The security issues were hammered out to allow Blake the freedom to continue doing what he wanted but requiring Blake to keep the military informed about any potential security issue.<br />
<br />
Josiah brought up the most interesting points of the whole conference. &quot;Now we don&#39;t want to violate your confidentiality Blake but I&#39;d like your permission to share confidential information in this closed meeting. This is why we closed the meeting to the public. The seriousness of this shrink ray means that the members here, including Silas who left, ought to know some of your psychological profile. I can&#39;t require you to divulge but I am asking you to allow us to ask. All the members here agree to respect your confidentiality and not let anything you say go beyond this committee.&quot;<br />
<br />
Blake agreed to full disclosure.<br />
<br />
Josiah said, &quot;Blake does not see me on an ongoing basis but he has come to me from time to time to help him sort things out. I have already told him what I&#39;m telling you now but could not say before. The reason Blake&#39;s inventions are rarely useful is because Blake&#39;s inventions are influenced by his own personal fetishes. He isn&#39;t trying to invent anything useful. I&#39;m sure he could invent something useful if he tried but let&#39;s just say that his inventions are really just fetish fuel.&quot;<br />
<br />
The dean asked, &quot;You mean all this time we&#39;ve been supporting a deviant and you didn&#39;t bring this to our attention sooner?&quot;<br />
<br />
Josiah said, &quot;It isn&#39;t that simple. Although his fetish influences his inventions, his inventions have shown some potential for usefulness. Can you imagine surgeons being able to shrink down and perform microsurgery, construction crews being able to shrink down to get into those tiny crawl spaces, solving all parking problems by shrinking cars when they&#39;re not being driven. His fetish may influence his invention but you can&#39;t tell me his invention is useless.&quot;<br />
<br />
The dean said, &quot;Alright but Blake, we want you to work on versions of your shrink ray that we can sell to the public, free of your fetish. People don&#39;t want rat tails.&quot;<br />
<br />
I spoke up, &quot;If I may, my tail has been very useful allowing me to climb more easily than I could without it.&quot;<br />
<br />
The dean said, &quot;Alright, but still, I want valid usefulness from your shrink ray, not fetish.&quot;<br />
<br />
Josiah continued, &quot;Even fetishes are not as simple as people think. People tend to talk as if the fetish was somehow separate from the mind, as if the penis had a mind of it&#39;s own. The truth is that the brain is the largest sexual organ in the body. The majority of what controls a person&#39;s sexuality is in the brain, not in the hormones, not in the eyes, not in the penis. Specifically our sexuality is controlled by the limbic system in the lower part of the brain near the spinal cord. It is the same system that controls our other emotions such as fear and anger. Because of that, there is major mixing between ones emotions and ones sexuality. Fetishes grow out of this mixture. Often people who have a fetish for transgender stories have feelings of misogyny or misandry. Often people who have a fetish for the inanimate have feelings of vengeance or a desire to control. Often people who have a fetish for furry have feelings of longing for freedom and the simplicity of life as an animal. I suspect your lab rat wants a simpler and freer life. Is that right?&quot;<br />
<br />
I said, &quot;No sir, you are wrong. I don&#39;t know my own feelings that well but it is not about wanting a simpler life.&quot;<br />
<br />
Josiah said, &quot;I&#39;ve never met you before so I have nothing to base an opinion on but I have spoken with Blake often enough that I can tell you where his fetish comes from. Blake has abandonment issues. Although both his parents are still around, Blake has not been able to depend on them. They gave guardianship of Blake to Tony and you all might as well know, Tony doesn&#39;t want that job. He&#39;s done what he needed to do for Blake&#39;s sake but he admits he doesn&#39;t care for Blake and so Blake feels again like he has no one to depend on. Therefore, his sexuality is colored by the fear of abandonment and the need to control someone and keep him from escaping or abandoning him.&quot;<br />
<br />
I asked Blake, &quot;Is that true?&quot;<br />
<br />
Blake picked me up and held me close, &quot;Yes, it&#39;s true. You don&#39;t know how good it makes me feel to see you in my rat cage or sitting on my desk.&quot; He kissed me.<br />
<br />
Josiah continued, &quot;I&#39;m glad you brought your lab rat to this conference because he needs to know this and we all need to know this. As far as Blake is concerned, his only desire is to keep his lab rat. He won&#39;t try to do anything else on his own. However, other individuals with other fetishes may try to influence Blake to do things that are far more destructive.&quot;<br />
<br />
I noticed that Josiah was looking at one of the biologists as he said that but I couldn&#39;t tell if he was looking at Edward or Ivan.<br />
<br />
Josiah continued, &quot;I propose that we give Blake his lab rat on a more permanent basis. Lab rat, would you agree to become his lab rat twenty-four seven?&quot;<br />
<br />
I said, &quot;No, I will not. I&#39;m a student trying to get good grades. I also want to hang out with my friends and go out sometimes.&quot;<br />
<br />
The dean said, &quot;As much as I dislike the idea, I agree with Josiah and I think we can accommodate you. I think we can arrange for you to continue classes inside your rat cage and continue to be able to go out sometimes. If we negotiate these accommodations with you, would you agree to move into Blake&#39;s rat cage and be his lab rat.&quot;<br />
<br />
I looked up at Blake and decided, &quot;Yes, yes I will.&quot;</p>
