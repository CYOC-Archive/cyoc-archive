<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Overview:<br />
This branch is designed to allow the user to fill in for a broken inanimate object until it is replaced, the Chronivac will protect the individual from all harm and no change is permanent or irereseable. The willing employee will be employed by Transdem Labs and will receive a modest wage to those who are desperately in need of income. This is a divergence from the usually dark path of most Chronivac stories and is an attempt at seeing a lighter side even of the device being a force of goodish intentions.<br />
<br />
Philip had been out of work since he left college, moving around and retraining again and again, yet the work force was after younger men it had left Philip in a little bit of a rut with bills to pay and failed aspirations, almost anything would be good at this point.<br />
 <br />
It was late in the evening whilst Philip was sitting at home watching TV, a package arrived at the door, after signing for it he brought it into his home. &quot;I had not ordered anything&quot; he thought to himself. Yet his name was on the box, he lived alone and had little in the way of friends &quot;Who would have sent me this&quot; he wondered as he carried it into his apartment and placing it on a table whilst he opened it.<br />
 <br />
Inside there was a leaflet with the following:<br />
 <br />
&quot;Congratulations you have been selected based on the finite curve of probability to receive a fully operational Chronivac. Please note this device has the capacity to destroy your reality, due to this nature any and all operational use should be taken into serious consideration. We hope you enjoy this device and use it to improve your life. Note: Transdem Labs will not be held responsible for any and all personal actions completed by this device.<br />
 <br />
It seemed quite foolish yet with nothing better to do Philip plugged the device into his computer whilst he awaited for his computer to detect it. His computer rebooted itself and entered a operating system called &quot;C-OS9&quot; he chucked to himself what a odd name, must be the ninth iteration of the device.<br />
 <br />
Once the device had loaded he was presented with a simple list of items, what would you like to modify with a list of items, (Yourself, Another Individual, An Object) using his mouse he decided to play with the device and clicked on Yourself.<br />
 <br />
He was presented with a new list of items, &quot;What would you like to become&quot; (Animal, Inanimate, Other, Misc.)  as well as a side window containing a list of Options, help and support, in the bottom corner of the screen was a button for employment opportunities. Clicking on this out of wonder he was presented with the following:<br />
 <br />
&quot;Dear user, we at Transdem Labs are a strong believer in providing opportunities to the disadvantaged and unfortunate. We are capable of using the device to provide employment opportunities. You the individual will be transformed into a inanimate object to fill a role that is vacant anywhere in the world for a week, with options of filling in for the object fulltime if desired/available. We will provide a modest wage and company benefits including pension. All employees will be protected from any misuse, damage or universal collapse caused by previous/future iterations of this device. We hope you are interested and look forward to a simple fulltime 9-5 job at which you will be returned to normal and teleported home at the end of your hours, overtime and enjoyment options will be available if requested. This is a contract and can be opt-out at anytime outside of your working hours. In return we will gather information about your transformation to improve our device. If you Agree to our terms this will disable all features and lock the device to you except for completing the job in question.&quot;<br />
 <br />
Philip couldn&#39;t believe it, could this device do what it actually stated, what harm would come to him, he could be a digger at best or a plug socket worst and he would be protected. With a glimmer of hope in his eyes he agreed to the terms out of desperation. What harm would come with being a inanimate object each day when he had bills, a lot was riding on this if it didn&#39;t work he would be homeless before the end of the year, his saving are running low and he is out of options. Filling out his bank details and agreeing he was told to come back tomorrow and await his first day of work.<br />
 <br />
A final note stated, &quot;Please do not arrive late in front of your device as this will cancel your employment for the foreseeable future&quot;. Also please arrive in front of your device naked, you are ok to eat before hand if you desire but it is not required. With one last message stating, do not worry about your home, the Chronivac will protect your processions and any damage/power loss to this device. Thank you for helping us test this device and hope you enjoy your first day&quot;.<br />
 <br />
There was a lot riding on this, if it was true, he hadn&#39;t even bothered to test the device, whilst it was only 8pm he decided to go to bed whilst brushing his teeth his mind was filled with a million thoughts, what would he become each week?, he wasn&#39;t sure if being tired or if he could sleep on the job would be available, but he wanted to ensure that he put his best foot forward and be presentable for his first day of work as he made his way to his bed.<br />
 <br />
He sleep well that night, for the first time in ages there was some hope an escape from his troubles that usually plagued his dreams, yet there was calm even to the impossibility of tomorrow and he drifted off. The morning came around it was 8am, he decided to jump in the shower and get some breakfast, he didn&#39;t want to be too hungry once got home, if it even worked.<br />
 <br />
He walked in front of the Chronivac waiting the countdown on the screen, it was 8:59am he started to shake thinking it was recording him naked as the device glared at him while the screen of his computer displayed: Awaiting &quot;New weekly job&quot;.<br />
 <br />
Philip was ready for anything he didn&#39;t care, he needed this to work, he was so desperate. 9:00am came and the screen updated, &quot;Your job this week is as a....&quot;</p>
