<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Not-June the raptor woman snorted, smug pride in her bones at putting the fear of god into that heartbreaking twerp. So -small- compared to her. Stupid, sniveling little brat of a child. Worthless simpering parasite, another useless mouth to feed, always with that stupid sad look on his face, like he honestly expected her to...<br />
<br />
She paused. That wasn&#39;t her thought. That was just an echo of June. An ugly echo. She closed her eye and focused, trying to clear her head. Her rush of power filled again, and too eagerly she willed her intellect to grow further, still feeling the rush from her first. She smiled as she began to ascend past the intelligence of the dreary woman she had been, becoming a true intellectual powerhouse. She looked at the others, still reeling from their former-self&#39;s memories returning. <br />
<br />
Some unsettled feeling in her mind nagged at her. That thought. That... resentment. That... -rejection.-<br />
She looked again at that photo, of June and Mark. The unhappy looks on their faces. The smug shit-eating grin on Dustin. <br />
<br />
Ty. Barely in frame. Looking lost. <br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
&quot;Ty.&quot; Came her voice. &quot;Stop dawdling and come down to the kitchen. Do -not- make me call you again.&quot; She said, firmly. She wasn&#39;t shouting, but her voice reached his room loud and clear. <br />
<br />
Tears still fresh in his eyes, Ty took a shuddering breath and opened the door. He winced every step down, feeling afraid of every noise he made. He couldn&#39;t even think about what was going to happen. His head was just a stormy cloud of dark static.  <br />
<br />
Eventually, he made his way to the kitchen door. It was dark in the room. There was a single candle lighting the space, sitting in the middle of the table. Just bright enough to illuminate -her- face dramatically. Her judging eyes, her shadow stretching to the top of the wall behind her. There were two other big shapes, Not-Mark and Darcy, looking towards him, but somehow more in shadow than Not-June. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come. Sit down.&quot; She said. <br />
<br />
Ty stood there, paralyzed. <br />
<br />
She narrows her eyes, reptilian slits boring in to him. &quot;Now.&quot;<br />
<br />
He forced himself forward and with a shaking hand pulled the chair back and sat down. He was utterly dwarfed by the dinosaurs seated around him. <br />
<br />
Not-June spoke again, the others looking on in silence. &quot;This is what&#39;s going to happen Ty. Before we make any decisions on what we do with you, you&#39;re going to answer some questions. And you should answer them with -absolute- honesty, Ty. I&#39;ll know if you&#39;re lying, so -don&#39;t.-&quot; <br />
<br />
Ty looked up, swallowed hard, and nodded. <br />
<br />
Not-June didn&#39;t bother to acknowledge his assent, instead moving directly to her first question in this dark dino tribunal. <br />
<br />
&quot;When I was your ignorant little raptor slut, did you love me? Did you actually care about me at all?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty paled. Some small part the questions would at least start a little easier than this. But... no. Of course they&#39;d shoot to the heart of it right away. He felt sweat bead on his brow and trail down his nose as he struggled to answer. <br />
<br />
An impatient tapping sound filled the air, Not-June&#39;s claws rapping against the table. <br />
<br />
His mouth was dry, but he answered as best he could. &quot;Y-yes. Yes I loved you. I... Think I loved you. I felt. Felt happy with you. You were sweet, sexy. You were... n-nice and cute. I, I wanted us to be together for a long time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her eyes narrowed again. &quot;Then why did you do what you did to me? -Betray- me? Try to get rid of me like that? As I pleaded with you to love me as I loved you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty choked back a retching noise, feeling heavy like lead. &quot;I.... I-I didn&#39;t. I didn&#39;t want to get rid of you. I. I was... I just wanted it to be simple. I didn&#39;t want you to remember, to care about that old June&#39;s life.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You wanted a subservient little chicken to be your pet? Not a partner, not an equal, not someone to love?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;N-no! I. I. I...&quot; He shook his head, barely able to keep his thoughts strait. &quot;I just wanted someone who loved me, you were... you were starting to... I panicked...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;And you could have had my love, but you withheld it from me as soon as it became complicated. You warped me into your pet, had my admiration and loyalty and the second I questioned it you got rid of me. Do you understand how painful that is?&quot;<br />
<br />
He sniffled. &quot;Do I understand? Do I understand?&quot; He asked, face growing hot. &quot;OF COURSE I UNDERSTAND!&quot; <br />
<br />
Not-Mark put his hands on the table, about to move, but a look from Not-June made him stop. <br />
<br />
Ty continued, feeling the words spill out of his mouth like fire. &quot;DO -YOU- know how it feels to be a fucking orphan for so long, getting adopted, thinking you&#39;re finally gonna have a family, and then, when you get there, they look at you like you&#39;re a fucking stain on the ground? I tried... I tried -so hard- to be a good son, those first couple years, to get a single fucking &#39;I love you,&#39; &#39;I&#39;m proud of you,&#39; ANYTHING! But you didn&#39;t want that. You just wanted the fucking government subsidy from adopting me and for me to stay quiet and out of the way. Every day, getting belittled, getting ignored, getting left behind as some meathead asshole who does everything he can to make you feel like shit gets everything they want on a fucking silver platter?&quot;<br />
<br />
The trio of dinos showed no apparent reaction, but Ty was far too deep into his explosion to care.<br />
<br />
 &quot;All I wanted. All I ever *FUCKING* wanted-&quot; He emphasized by slamming his fist on the table. &quot;Was a family! I wanted someone, ANYONE to love me!&quot; He fought back the impulse to vomit as he recollected the day&#39;s events. &quot;And I... I feel sick now. What I did to them... oh -god- dustin. I... I just hated them so much. I wanted them to hurt. Hurt like I did. Feel helpless like I did, small, -weak-. Feel HATED like they made me feel! But I didn&#39;t... I&#39;m not...&quot;<br />
<br />
He collapsed. &quot;I&#39;m sorry! Oh god I&#39;m so sorry! Just kill me. Or turn me to stone or.. or blank me. Just don&#39;t make me go back. Bo back to being.... -hated- like that, looked down on by you all. I can&#39;t take it!!! I didn&#39;t wanna hurt you... I was just so scared of you hating me! Like she did! So I tried to make it go away, make your questions go away, just be happy and love me and never look back! I felt happy for once! I just.. I just wanted.. I&#39;mm... I&#39;m so...&quot;<br />
<br />
He sobbed, burying his face in his hands.<br />
<br />
He waited for the condemnation. The jaws on his flesh. The flush of change. Anything. <br />
<br />
What he didn&#39;t expect was the tender scaly hand gently laying itself on his head. <br />
<br />
He looked up, eyes bleary. His former step-mother&#39;s face leaned down close to him. No malice on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;I had to hear it from you to be sure.&quot; She said. <br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
She looked at that picture, eyes boring in to it. In her adrenaline fueled fury, she hadn&#39;t really taken any time to sort through her restored memories, realize the person her former self had been, the story that had lead up to her change and love and betrayal. She... As she had pumped up her intellect, the sweetly satisfying rage began to simmer down, calm rationality fighting it back. This needed more time. She made a thought, and a time bubble surrounded ty&#39;s room. She&#39;d sort him out later. <br />
<br />
But as she tried to run over the questions in her head, she was interrupted.<br />
<br />
The raptor formerly known as mark stumbled over. Darcy was still clutching his head and groaning. <br />
<br />
&quot;Who that?&quot; Said Raptor Mark dumbly. She had been rushed, awakening his memories but apparently they hadn&#39;t integrated into proper intellect. <br />
<br />
&quot;Your former existence.&quot; Said Not June. &quot;Don&#39;t you remember? What he did to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh. Hm. Yeah..&quot; Said Mark. &quot;Made me raptor. Felt good. Matin&#39; good.&quot;<br />
<br />
Not-June grimaced. Was this really the most his bird brain could muster? Just like that drunk asshole to not give a- She quirked her brow. Another phantom memory popping up, further filling her with concern. &quot;He wiped that being from existence to make you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmf.&quot; Said Mark, crossing his arms across his considerable pectorals. She had perhaps been... indulgent making his new body lithe and muscular. Strong, but still a touch shorter and less powerful than her. But she felt owed that pleasure. &quot;Mark look bad. He dumb. Fat. Weak. No like him.&quot; <br />
<br />
Not-June was going to try and ague with him, but paused, searching her former life&#39;s memories of Mark. A bitter, drunk asshole obsessed with his masculinity despite being an awful excuse of a man. Never once paying June a kind word with any kind of genuineness to it. A loveless, ugly marriage with a loveless, ugly man. Hm.<br />
<br />
Not that June was that much to write home about. A bad drinking habit even worse than Mark&#39;s, bitter heart full of ice. Looked at her neighbors with disdain, especially those... oh gods she was HORRIBLY fucking racist. With growing shame, Not-June dug through her memories. Surely she wasn&#39;t that awful to her children...<br />
<br />
Darcy, no, -Dustin,- yes, yes she loved that boy. But... it wasn&#39;t a good love. It was a smug satisfied pride in a son with a promising sports career, ready to live vicariously through his success, spoiling him, turning a blind eye when he bullied other kids, stayed out drinking and getting up to all kinds of shit. He was the pride of Mark, of course, a Man&#39;s Man, a chauvinistic cad with about as much respect for women as a pigeon&#39;s respect for car&#39;s windshields. <br />
<br />
Of course June was unhappy. The raptor woman tried to remember the last time that woman felt an genuine happiness, and blanched as a very recent memory immediately came to the forefront. The raptor ravishing her body. The excited, sinful bliss. That was her, wasn&#39;t it? Not some warping from Ty, she genuinely was so sexually unsatisfied that being fucked by that raptor was some kind of blissfull awakening... She licked her lips. Gods, yes, that eager little bastard humping her brains out. Wanting more, so much more! A liftime wasted not cumming her soul away. Then the -change-. And then sweet smelling pink boy came, made nice sounds... mmm... tasty cock, she knew sucky, remembered sucky. Sweet sweet. Fuck! Fucked so good, yesssssss... She wanted more, and got more. He fucked so much, made her come, rub and rub and cum and cum, good good good good CUMS! <br />
<br />
She was panting, fingering herself in the middle of the room, and then caught herself, forcing herself to calm down, feeling embarassed angry... hurt that she couldn&#39;t just be enjoying that right now. Damn that Ty! Why couldn&#39;t he have just been good to her? She would have... she wanted her mate. Her sweet cuddly mate who made her feel so good... <br />
<br />
She grit her teeth. No. No feeling sympathy, no feeling sorry for him, for what he did to her. She would have stayed with him no matter what if he&#39;d just trusted her, loved her. Loved her like June had...  not... loved him. At all. <br />
<br />
Even with her newly expanded mind, she struggled to describe the feeling of comprehending the empty space where affection ought to be for a child. The memories of disdain, of repeated put downs and neglect felt like ice inside her skull. God, god there was this one moment, young Ty, only eleven... a -baby- for god&#39;s sake, made something for her for mother&#39;s day. It was roughly hewn, made of clay, painted with less than stellar care in the painting, but it was significantly more than Dustin had bothered with. And she dumped it in the trash. In front of him. While Dustin laughed. She didn&#39;t do nearly as much as Mark would, but she&#39;d just cross her arms and sit and watch and not feel a thing for him. <br />
<br />
She understood now. Where it all began.<br />
--<br />
<br />
&quot;As cruel as your actions were...&quot; Said Not-June, still stroking Ty&#39;s head. &quot;They were a clear result of a long cycle of abuse. Lashing out against years of cruelty. You wanted love, yes, you even loved me as best you could... but you were too afraid of opening up, to being vulnerable to someone else that you immediately tried to pull away, protect yourself at other&#39;s expense and even your own, sacrificing connections to avoid being hurt by anyone else.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty stared up at her, confused. &quot;How...&quot;<br />
<br />
She smiled. &quot;I willed myself to have a comprehensive understanding of psychology.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So.... so what now?&quot; Asked ty, genuinely at a loss. &quot;I. I still erased my family. Did what I did to you.... Am I being forgiven?&quot;<br />
<br />
Not-June retracted her hand. &quot;Hm. No, not yet. I&#39;m not just ready yet, and It&#39;s not up to me alone.&quot;<br />
<br />
The candle suddenly flared and the others were visible now. Raptor Mark looking down with an uncaring expression, Darcy/Dustin with his bulky arms crossed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... yeah.&quot; Said Ty, sinking deep into his seat. He was going to fucking die. <br />
<br />
Raptor Mark spoke first. &quot;You do this?&quot; <br />
<br />
Ty nodded. <br />
<br />
The dino man shrugged. &quot;Ok. Me no care. Mark dumb. Me feel good. Me strong. Me liked mating. When we eat? Me hungry.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty looked to Not-June with confusion painting his features. She shrugged. &quot;Ironically, he&#39;s the most reminiscent of his former self. If more of a... what&#39;s the term, Himbo?&quot;<br />
<br />
The sound of a throat clearing pulled Ty&#39;s attention towards the slab of ruddy orange dino beef that was Darcy, formerly Dustin. Right... Ty&#39;s heart sank. <br />
<br />
&quot;You were mean.&quot; Said Darcy. &quot;Really mean. I remember being small, it hurt.&quot; <br />
<br />
Ty grimaced.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m so sorry. So... so sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Asked Darcy. <br />
<br />
&quot;YES!&quot; Said Ty. <br />
<br />
Darcy stared him down for a silent eternity, before uncrossing his arms and smiling simply. &quot;Okay Boss.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? You believe me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Darcy looked at Not June. &quot;Lady said you&#39;d, uh, turn purple if ya lied.&quot;<br />
<br />
She chuckled. &quot;I -did- say I&#39;d know if you were lying.&quot; <br />
<br />
Ty looked around confused. &quot;This. This is too easy... I. I did all that to you...&quot;<br />
<br />
Not June sighed. &quot;Yes... but. We had time to talk over our feelings, time distillation bubble, don&#39;t ask. And... we agreed as hurtful as your actions were, the seeds of that were planted by our former selves. And... to be frank.&quot; She narrowed her eyes. &quot;I despise that woman. A wretch who blamed everyone around her for the life she wasted. She had so many opportunities she denied herself. She was an awful person... and a disgrace of a mother.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Dustin was mean too.&quot; said Darcy, glumly. &quot;He was really mean all the time and laughed when folks were sad and I don&#39;t like that. And... and... he has a girlfriend but. But he had one before and she wouldn&#39;t fuck him when he wanted so he left her for the... uh... new girlfriend? And he did it really mean and she cried and I don&#39;t wanna make girls cry.&quot;<br />
<br />
Not Mark chuffed. &quot;Changing feel good. Me no care. Me feel sexy!&quot; He growled, rubbing his cocks brazenly with his scaly mitts.<br />
<br />
Darcy brightened. &quot;Oh yeah, I feel uh, real good. My body&#39;s real good I like it, so. Uh. Thanks?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty struggled to process it. But Not June&#39;s coy expression froze him in his tracks. <br />
<br />
She lightly trailed her hands from the top of her head down to her shoulders, luxuriating in the softness of her blue and red feathers. &quot;I must admit, Ty, one of the big factors in me being so merciful towards you right now is your sense of taste. Even before my personal improvements... I was beautiful. You must agree, hm?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I mean...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t turn purple on me Ty~&quot; She said, grinning wickedly. <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re beautiful!&quot; Sputtered Ty, blushing as his memories turned to the more... favorable events of the day. &quot;Gorgeous.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm.&quot; She said in agreement, fluttering her tail fan playfully. &quot;And, in those moments we shared, those lustful passions, those relentless mating sessions? When you&#39;d melt my mind with constant gushing orgasms?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty began to sweat once more. Why was she going on like this? He&#39;d been pingponging between fear, abject shame and reconciliation and he was in no state to withstand the arousal she was attempting to instill.<br />
<br />
&quot;They were... woonnnnderfulll~&quot; Sighed, smiling. &quot;Mmmm, its the funny thing, Ty. I mispoke when I implied you made me into your slut. The fact of the matter was, June Smith was a deeply repressed slut all along. That first ordeal shattered a dam in her mind. A voracious, hungry desire for pleasure that is the -only- thing I&#39;m happy to carry on from her. I. Am. A. SLUT.&quot; She said, teeth snapping with each word. <br />
<br />
Ty gulped. <br />
<br />
&quot;It was no secret I was head over heels with you Ty. Not just for the sex... but the -domination.- I tried to have my fun with these two... tried to assert my dominance, make them the pets, just to relieve some frustration... It was alright. But, I must admit, it was missing something. Even with my power, my intellect, my -strength..- I am a hopeless submissive, funny, no?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And these two, just don&#39;t have it in them. Darcy is too polite, and this one? Too self absorbed in his own pleasure.&quot; <br />
<br />
Not Mark chuffed in annoyance, but said nothing. <br />
<br />
Not June sighed. &quot;To be satisfied, I need a mate. A dominant, loving mate. A master~&quot; Cooed Not June. &quot;In those moments, when you tenderly fucked my walnut sized brain out, I felt it. I felt that love. When there was nothing between us but lust and raw instinct, there was no room for bad memories or trauma. Just. Us. Beasts rutting. But the dominance was even more than the sex. I&#39;ll let you in on a dirty secret.&quot;<br />
<br />
She leaned in, breath tickling Ty&#39;s ears. &quot;Changing... transforming. Is so, very arousing. Changing, no, BEING changed, watching others -be- changed, oh Ty you have no idea how intoxicating it is. You&#39;ve awakened this beast, this reborn shell of a bitter woman, to a world of impossible kinks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;J-june...&quot;<br />
<br />
She snarled. &quot;Not. June.&quot; She straightened up. &quot;I am so far beyond that woman, even without my power, even as a primitive slut like I was before, I am superior to her. I am...&quot;<br />
<br />
She smiled, something suddenly clicking in her head. <br />
<br />
&quot;I am Juno.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s... that&#39;s a good name.&quot; Murmured Ty, completely overwhelmed by her sexual aura. <br />
<br />
&quot;I know it seems hypocritical to sing the praises of your perversions. But fuck it, I&#39;m a balance of contradicting forces. Human and beast, past and present, power and submission, I find what our powers can do... intoxicating. Did you know I turned the sky green for a moment? What they could do... Even I struggle to fully comprehend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So. What?&quot; Asked ty. &quot;Do we just... carry on? Horny transformation stuff and all?&quot; <br />
<br />
She frowned. &quot;Unfortunately, Ty. No. As we are, there&#39;s still heartbreak, too much for me to feel safe giving you control again. Until I have my assurances... You will not have power over me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty shrank, not arguing back <br />
<br />
Juno continued. &quot;I have... an Idea on how we can start the healing process, but as of now, there are other matters to be observed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Look down, Ty.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty did, and gasped. The candle had been replaced as the light source, and now on the table there was...<br />
<br />
A birthday cake. A huge one. Chocolate iced and covered in swirling decorations. Fifteen candles dotted the top. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wha... I...&quot;<br />
<br />
Juno sighed. &quot;Although I have not... fully forgiven your wounding actions... I am intent on fixing the mistakes my predecessor made. I am intent to use my power to make things better.  Make things... -Evolve.- Make a wish Ty. Any wish. I want to hear your desire, it will help me... think.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty looked at the candles, feeling tears form in his eyes again. <br />
<br />
&quot;I just... want things to be good. For me and Juno to be happy together again...&quot;<br />
<br />
He blew, and the room was bathed in darkness.<br />
<br />
She smiled. &quot;I think I know just what to do.&quot;</p>
