<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Paul wandered over the countryside looking for that herd of ponies he could call as his home. There were some but even as he stood near their fenceline the mares became skiddish and fled to the barn. He had simular luck everywhere he went and was beginning to think that Zepar's curse was for him to remain as a pony soldier pony.<br />
<br />
After almost two weeks of wandering and with the new lifestyle of being a pony, Paul was losing himself to the animal conscience. <br />
<br />
A stop to graze on the front lawn of one Patricia Doyle, she a widow lady and Scottish to boot. It began as Paul grazed, his new self took over and as he ate his fill from the green grasses of Patricia's lawn his human rational usually fell to sleep.<br />
<br />
The continuous repeating of the lips action of gathering, gripping, allowing those front teeth to bite off the grass and then do some massive chewing all worked so very smoothly. Paul would quickly slip from a longing, wishing human trapped inside a pony animal body, he'd become a plain docile pony like anyother one might see.<br />
<br />
So then did Patricia see this strange pony to be nothing more than just a friendly beast. She not having a pet but did own a good 10 acres along with her large and spacious home. She lived also alone, her husband having passed away not all that long ago. He being gone and her still at the young age of thirty one, she thought having even such a large pet might be fun.<br />
<br />
Patricia approached Paul with some caution wondering if he be tame or wild. As she came closer the pony caught her scent and raised his head, ears alert, and tail flicking as a sign of his normal nervous nature when around humans.<br />
<br />
Stepping close to him Patricia petted the ponies' neck and mane. Her hands being warm and soft lulled Paul, his pony self into a friendly mood. Even the human mind of Paul which was still left inside that smaller brain felt a sensing of someone here was kind.<br />
<br />
Patricia urged Paul to walk and follow her around the side of her great house and soon had him lured into the storeage shed out behind the home. A bucket of water and there also an open but fenced area Paul could call as his home.<br />
<br />
So things just happened as Paul found a loving and caring person in Patricia. She too found of Paul the pony to be a sweet loving animal and pet. Her occasional horseplaying with him made for physical fun and interaction between human and one mixed mindsets of changed human and a pony mentality.<br />
<br />
As summer moved in time to fall and with that changing of the leaves Paul was by this time in his pony life finding what was human about him and his past as fading away. He accepted well his animal self and began to do things like an aniaml with the odd exception of dirtying his stall. He would wait with cossed legs for Patricia to release him into the pasture. Then in a rush he's trot to one section and do his dump. This done the strnage mannered pony would trot back to his barn and stall. Patricia would set out a half bucket of mixed grain, a quarter bale of hay and let him eat in peace.<br />
<br />
The purchase of a true scottish pony cart from her homeland had Paul learning and liking to pull his lady friend from home to market. So this went on as the coming of winter and chilly days and freezing nights made for Paul a new realization of what a naked pony feels being naked to the elements.<br />
<br />
Paul was from deep in his pony conscience feeling a lve for his owner. When she would come near he offten showed off his passion for her touch by dropping his fire hose and getting very stiff. His routine of this action made for him a coditioned response, one that Patricia found to be quite humorous.<br />
<br />
Often as Paul stood erect and thinking of his owner in passionate ways, he'd stand stiff, body stretched out to accent his maleness all the more. He'd stiffen himself, lifting the massive pony stallion organ up till it bounced off a flatened well muscled belly.<br />
<br />
Unlike so many ponies, Paul's belly though rounded was basically flat and not rounded into a fat gut. Paul was a young, sleek, and slender form of a pony. He kept himself trim and fit as much still thinking of human hygene and human manners of thinking about his health.<br />
<br />
Patrica's thinking of her pony pet changed after an accident when Paul while drawing her cart on day slipped on black ice and fell into the ditch along the road. Standing again up her pony was covered in wet yucky mud and looked the worse for it.<br />
<br />
Once back to his barn the dear lady unhitched Paul from the cart and led him to stand in the middle of her garage and stable. A hose of warm water and one sponge had her washing a friend and pet from the filth of the road.<br />
<br />
That passion for his lady owner returned and while washing off the mud Patricia saw the long pony organ fall and become erect. It was then she had the thought to actually touch the thing, and doing so her mind filled with memories of her husband.<br />
<br />
A soaking water water treatment had Paul thinking of his owner in deep and more passionate ways. Oddly for Patricia, she too was enjoying the touch of his pulsing organ and felt too of what Zepar had endowed Paul the pony with, large sized testicles hung in a black skinned pouch.<br />
<br />
This became her first of many encounters with Paul the pony and his male self. A strange aluring feeling grew between her pet and herself as almost a spell fell over animal and human female.<br />
<br />
Patricia being very wealthy from her late husband's life insurance had an easy life living alone on her estate. A hired gardener was there during the spring, summer, and early fall days, but othersise she and Paul were alone.<br />
<br />
The relationship grew to allowing her hygene minded pony the run of the unfenced back lawn and even the rear deck. Patricia would lounge in her hot tub and watch Paul graze of flolick on the lawn. He even tried to step into the hot tub once but was shewed away by a laughing naked woman. <br />
<br />
So little by litle during the mild winter months the lady owner and her pet pony began an affair. She would spend much time toying with his male self and he then was allowed times to sniff her own scent. Paul having pony instincts now would often give an affectionate lick to Patricia's more sensual parts, making her laugh.<br />
<br />
Little did Paul know of the demon who sent him into the cold cruel world as a pony and animal. Zepar being the devil Lucifer's choice demon for insighting pedophilia in mankind was also well versed in making men think and live worse than common beats. So he must had had a good laugh as Paul and Patricia slipped into a sensual relationship.<br />
<br />
The coming of warm spring days had the pony now a year since his transformation by Zepar becoming insensed with mating. <br />
<br />
Patricia on that warm sixty degree day in spring had just finished her daily soak in the hot tub when from the garage stable came an awful screaming whinny.<br />
<br />
Paul feeling his spring time passions, the urge to mate, and his own deep seeded human desires to feel the sensation of being at stud, made him scream out his confusion.<br />
<br />
Alone and totally private a naked owner came to the stable and stood before her pet pony. Paul seeing her in this way thought of only pony passions and stepping close burried his soft nostrils into her groin. Two deep drafting breaths brought into his mind her wonderful scent. Yet two harsh exhales thrilled Patricia as she'd not felt in a couple of years.<br />
<br />
Petting and feeling of each the other commensed as lonely female human felt the longing to be whole again. As then too for young Paul who longing to find love in a animal pony form was becoming insensed with this wonderful friendly woman.<br />
<br />
Patricia slipping into the lusty mind which Zepar would have wished, laid over some bales of hay. Her legs spread wide she let Paul the pony sniff and then lick her into a dreamy lust for feeling what should not come true.<br />
<br />
Instincts took over in Paul and the pony he had become so willingly over the past many months began the ritual of equine mating. A bounce up his forelegs either side of Patricia's shoulders had his male organ erect and thrusting to hit a mark. <br />
<br />
Rational thoughts were fading even for Patricia as she knowing her actions to be so very wrong went ahead and allowed things to happen. It was with the sensual touch of a ponies' stiff cock head to her lips of human female sex that sent her into a lusting wild panic.<br />
<br />
A coaxing hand held the shaft to its mark and her own juices oiled the head allowing it to slip in side her body. A mild mannered pony with boyish human memories moved his male organ in slowly. <br />
<br />
Patricia maoned with wild feelings of remembered passion her hubby Ted having been almost as large as Paul's pony member. Her soft alluring sounds had Paul thrusting his cock ever deeper and with this felt the tightness he longed to know. <br />
<br />
Now it happened that once inserted deeply, Paul the pony began to work his rock hard cock around in a harsh pony fashion. Paul came quickly his white river of cum and then seven slugs of semen roaring out the end of his black shaft.<br />
<br />
As the load was spent the sensation remained and pony stallion at stud remained connected to his lover. Minutes of glory and sensual feelings passed. An hour and then more time as the two felt and toyed with the other in wild beastly passion. <br />
<br />
Patricia wished it would never stop and longed for her pony pet to remain jammed deep. Her sex being stretched to the limit of bursting was a feeling and longing she'd held back for so many years. Now she had a lover animal though he be the pony was willing and able to give her the satisfaction she'd wished for so long.<br />
<br />
A screaming whinny from Paul was an equine sign of male domination. His animal self wishing to remind and tell all that this one female was his!<br />
<br />
One full and bulging lady waddled back to her hot tub and soaked off the dry crusting remains of Paul's cum and overflow of semen. Setting there she watched as long strings of his cum and liquid semen oozed from her pussy rising to the surface of the water. <br />
<br />
Relaxed more than she'd been in years Patricia played with the rounded cooking globs of Paul the ponies' semen as it surfaced and remained in thick jelly like orbes.<br />
<br />
Pressing on her swelled tummy she squeezed out the massive load of Paul's semen as fingers tried to keep her lips open and vagina leeking. At last unable to clear out the infectious semen from her body Patricia saw something which might help. <br />
<br />
Jumping out of the hot tub she grabbed a garden hose and proceeded to ram it in her pussy making a river of spent semen flood onto the deck.<br />
<br />
Tired and her passion spent Patricia laid out on the deck and fell sound asleep. It was after sundown and with the moon rising in the east when she awoke. A friendly hairy rump was pressed up close to her side as Paul seeing her sleeping did also fold himself down and lay near his mate.<br />
<br />
Stallion and mate shared more time toying together as for Patricia she felt the chill of night cover her body. Paul continued to do his best with soft muzzel and roving lips to make the young lady keep her thrilled sexual light burning.<br />
<br />
About midnight she got up and feeling the chilly air turn to cold Patrica opened the door to her house and went inside. Turning arouns she was ready to slide the glass door closed and lock it when Paul had his big head poked inside.<br />
<br />
At first she pleaded with him to stay outside as an animal of his size should. It was not his thought as he instead stepped into the family room and stood flicking his tail and looking around. <br />
<br />
Laughing at her pet and his actions of finding the family room as someplace interesting Patricia walked off to the bedroom for a warm robe. Returning moents later she heard voices and rushed into the family room expecting trouble.<br />
<br />
There she stood with mouth open stunned to see her pony stallion lover seated on the carpet. On his tailed round butt he sat with forelegs supporting his mass and eyes fixed on the telelvision. He had somehow turned it on and was watching the set with obvious interest as if he'd done this before.<br />
<br />
Calling his pony name of &quot;Roy&quot; Patricia saw him look her way and with his long neck and pony head motion for her to join him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wierd!&quot; was all she could say as Patricia went to sit on the footstool next to her pony and mate. Looking at this crazy situation she became more and more uneasy with it as the show made her pony grin and almost laugh.<br />
<br />
Refreshments offered as she got popcorn for herself and a bunch of celery for the pony. It was the popcorn which her pony prefered and not the greenery. Together until early morning it was Patricia who fell asleep on the floor.<br />
<br />
The sound of her alarm clock buzzing awoke her to find the pony on in the room. Looking to the sliding glass door it was still locked so the animal must be inside her big house. Checking the kitchen she found not even a hoof print. Looking everywhere she found nothing and was going crazy when from upstairs she heard him whinny. <br />
<br />
Racing up the long winding stairway she went to the bedroom where her alarm clock was still buzzing its brains out. There she stood amazed at her bed and the pony stallion who lay tucked in under the covers. This was now more than just odd as how or why would a pony animal wish to sleep in a bed? A soft whinny of affection Paul made as Patricia walked to his bedside and sat down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your one crazy creature!&quot; said Patricia to her pet.<br />
<br />
A reaching head of a pony tried to lip nibble her breast as she pushed his head away. Then he tried to poke his nose in between her legs as she again pushed him away. It was at this moment Patricia saw the blankets begin to tent up as someone under the covers was getting quite erect.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on get out of my bed, you don't belong in the house and certainly not in my good bed!&quot; exclaimed Patricia as she tossed off the blankets covering Paul's pony body.<br />
<br />
Bounding up the pony stallion stood there erect and nickering at his mate. He followed her right up to the bathroom door and whinnied when it closed for her privacy. Turning and making his way downstairs Paul did his best to get out bread for toasting, opening the fridge and grabbed with large teeth the bottle of orange juice. Opening drawers he found his nimble lips as good tools to pick up fork, knife, and spoon for to set the table for his lover.<br />
<br />
Going about things as if it were a sunday mornig and he was again at home with his parents Paul made breakfast for his lover. The scene was an eye opener for Patricia when she came into the kitchen. There standing at attention was he roan haired pony stallion by the kitchen table with dishes placed, and utensils, and a bottle of orange juice with sizeable teeth imprints in the bottle's neck.<br />
<br />
Bread placed by the toated, a box of Wheaties set by a bowl on the table it looked like she had an almost human pony pet!<br />
<br />
Paul being his new self stood there thinking of human trappings while if one checked below and behind you'd see his shaft out long black and very erect.</p>
