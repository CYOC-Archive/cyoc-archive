<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Do you like her?&quot; came an eager voice as John came in from the Jenkins family front porch and soon found himself greeted by his sister, Janice.<br />
<br />
Harry and Jenny weren&#39;t back from the college, yet, and a part of John wondered if they might have other things that related to all the nonsense that James Harper Senior had caused on both the Harper family and Moon Lake. Of course, he didn&#39;t know for sure, and the older Jenkins in this particular Jenkins home remained fairly calm and quiet on all that. John figured though that they were also still frustrated that Dieter Wilhelm had hired people to kill one of their sons and nearly succeeded in killing the other son, which John understood. And Henry and Lisa Jenkins seemed to be good people that he was more than willing to give them their personal space on things.<br />
<br />
However, at the moment, &quot;personal space&quot; wasn&#39;t actually the thing that John felt he was getting at the moment. For as soon as he came in the front door, he&#39;d been greeted by his sister who practically bouncing about with a curious smile on her face. Some of it made sense, as they were in a new town and for the most part it looked like Moon Lake would be their new home, assuming the lawyers in Alabama did things correctly, though John really didn&#39;t know how well that would work, but it did seem like things would go forward in that regard. However, with it now being early November, it meant neither of them really had anyone their age they could talk to on a reliable basis. Most kids were in school, and even if the others in the town knew of him and his sister, John figured his father&#39;s actions was probably enough to get them to keep their distance...<br />
<br />
Except for Ginger, a young weretiger who he and Janice had met on a walk in the general area around the Jenkins home. She was kind and friendly, and had voiced her desire to be John&#39;s friend. Privately, John thought this was nice, though it did also trouble somethings in the back of his mind that he wasn&#39;t quite sure on how to answer. Though, he was glad to have a potential friend in Ginger, and he figured that she might help him get used to things at Moon Lake High, once everything else fell through. John and Janice had also met Ginger&#39;s brother on that walk, who Janice had found &quot;cute,&quot; though Janice seemed more interested in weremers than anything else and Ginger had also told John later that her brother HAD a girlfriend. That had generally meant that while John seemed to have attracted Ginger&#39;s attention and friendship, Janice hadn&#39;t had similar &quot;luck.&quot; That, John had figured was probably what left Janice so curious into Ginger&#39;s interest in him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I saw you talking out there on the porch,&quot; Janice than said with a smile, &quot;Do you like her?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ginger&#39;s a friend,&quot; John answered, though that didn&#39;t answer Janice&#39;s question.<br />
<br />
&quot;But do you LIKE her?&quot; Janice asked, &quot;I mean... this place will be home for us soon enough. We&#39;ll get to stay here, and Jenny and Harry... and his parents will be there for us...&quot;<br />
<br />
John nodded at that. The plan that had them here had been to help them get to a safer place where they could grow up without their father&#39;s fits of rage other issues. John knew that Harry&#39;s parents were more than willing to help with them. About the only thing that he didn&#39;t know was the agreement that Jenny had reached with William and Martha Anderson, which would essentially let them serve as surrogate parents for Jenny, but then, neither John nor Janice had met everyone that Jenny and Harry knew, yet.<br />
<br />
&quot;...and I&#39;m pretty sure she likes you,&quot; Janice continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;As a friend,&quot; John stated, remembering what Ginger had said to him while his own mind also wrestled with whether or not more was possible and if he even wanted that.<br />
<br />
Janice rolled her eyes with some disbelief. While she wasn&#39;t really old enough to fully consider getting a boyfriend or anything like that, there were a few girls that she had hung out with at school back in Alabama that had voiced that sort of interest. Much of it was in relation crushes on pop stars and that sort of thing, which would of course mean that they&#39;d never get to hear a full return of their attention, but it did give Janice enough to figure out that Ginger O&#39;Toole liked John a bit more than just as a friend. However, she didn&#39;t say anything verbally to that fact, as she did feel a bit jealous.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do the Jenkins need our help with dinner?&quot; John asked as they came into the living room with the couch folded back so that it was a regular couch, as with Huck healed enough to move around a bit more and with Betty Timid staying close to him, he was able to return to his own home. In this John knew that for some, things were getting better and had some obvious good futures. John liked Huck, and was glad he&#39;d found someone to make him happy. He also respected Huck&#39;s advice.<br />
<br />
Janice glanced toward the kitchen where she could hear the shuffling of feet and dishes. Occasionally there was a &quot;beep&quot; that came out of the kitchen, but she figured that that was just something that related to timers and so on. She got the sense that John was avoiding her questions, which only fueled her curiosity and jealousy in the fact that John had someone that was interested in being at least friends with him. Eventually they heard the door that lead into the garage that indicated that Jenny and Harry had gotten home.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think so,&quot; Janice answered, &quot;but they&#39;ll let us know if they need anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
John nodded and moved to sit on the couch, though he found Janice following him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, John,&quot; Janice said to him, &quot;this will be home soon, and she does seem nice. Surely you like her? Right?&quot;<br />
<br />
John was about to answer when a new voice cut in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like who?&quot; came a voice from the doorway to the kitchen and making both John and Janice look up to see Harry and Jenny standing there, with Harry&#39;s arm around their eldest sister and his hand resting on her hip. It was Jenny who had spoken.<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s a weretiger named Ginger,&quot; Janice answered, &quot;John and I met her and her brother while out for a walk the other day. They seemed nice, and I think Ginger likes him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And do you like her?&quot; Jenny asked to her younger brother, though her voice was more concerned than anything else. Something in her instincts gave her the sort of sense that John might be battling with things that would go beyond friendship and social interaction to where he was concerned about his own sexuality as to whether he was straight, bi, or gay. Jenny knew that John would need to be able to get through that, which Moon Lake would allow for and welcome him regardless, but that would probably take time. There was also the mention that Ginger was a weretiger, this would mean that if John did have romantic feelings for her, there would be a lot of things that would need to be handled. <br />
<br />
They could obviously date and not risk John becoming a were if he didn&#39;t want to be one, but the fact that she was a were was a major issue. In this, Jenny was well aware of things that related to that issue, for as a werefox, she&#39;d gone through that, knowing that once she&#39;d become a werefox, any physical relationship with Harry would mean he would have to become a werefox, which he was more than willing to do. At the same time, she could also feel her own high libido coursing through her, and she had enjoyed her time in private with Harry where they could be intimate. In this, if Ginger was a were, she had similar drives and would want the attention, which could complicate things. In pure theory, John didn&#39;t have to become a were, but it would mean that he and Ginger could never be together physically if he wanted to be with her but to remain human.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well she is nice... and I suppose I like her as a friend,&quot; John said slowly, &quot;She&#39;s really the only were outside of you guys and Huck that Janice and I have met... I really... I really don&#39;t know beyond that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny gave him a small smile and moved to sit by John and wrapped an arm around his shoulders. Harry stood by quietly, noting that John was absentmindedly scratching at the couch cushions. Jenny didn&#39;t see John scratching the couch&#39;s cushions, but she did remember her dreams and the seeming out of the blue warning that her dream self had given her, and that drove Jenny to try and make sure that John was comfortable.<br />
<br />
&quot;And that&#39;s perfectly fine,&quot; Jenny told her little brother, &quot;you&#39;re quite free to make your own decisions and regardless of what you choose, you&#39;ll be welcomed and have friends here. If this Ginger remains a friend who happens to be a girl, that&#39;s fine. If she becomes a potential girlfriend, that&#39;s also fine. Just remember to be polite with her... and to be honest with yourself. Okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right,&quot; John nodded, &quot;and she did say she would always be my friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that&#39;s good,&quot; Harry smiled, &quot;and hopefully, she&#39;ll be the first of many friends for you and Janice. Because Moon Lake is a good place to be... both Huck and I found plenty of friends here as we grew up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Must be nice,&quot; Janice looked down for a moment, &quot;would any of them mind... well... all the stuff dad put them through?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Some may have some resentment at your father for his actions,&quot; Harry admitted, &quot;and will be even more irritated with his boss, but I don&#39;t think anyone will take it out on you personally.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both John and Janice gave sighs of relief at that. Moving to a new place would always be difficult, as both of them would have to start anew, regardless of the issues they&#39;d had. However, in his friendly way, they also seemed to trust Harry quite a lot. He was kind, and some ways was very much like his older brother, though there were some differences. From some talks that Janice had had with Lisa Jenkins, she had learned that Harry planned to be a fireman after he graduated college, an Moon Lake did maintain a small professional service with a position due to open in four years. It countered heavily to the construction company legacy that Henry Senior and Huck had with Jenkins Construction.<br />
<br />
&quot;And there are no bullies?&quot; John asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;None that I remember,&quot; Harry spoke, &quot;and I&#39;m pretty sure that both of you will do well and will find friends. It won&#39;t matter if you&#39;re a normal human and they&#39;re weres. You&#39;ll have friends...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And it shouldn&#39;t be too long before your older brother can get a family lawyer in Alabama to put together a formal form of consent similar to what was drawn up here,&quot; Jenny assured both of them, &quot;and you will be safe here with us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t wait,&quot; Janice declared as she leaned back on the couch, &quot;I mean... I&#39;ll miss some of the friends I had back in Alabama, and maybe James can get their addresses and we can be pen pals... but at the same time, there so much about this place that&#39;s new and exciting. And interesting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is different,&quot; John agreed.<br />
<br />
&quot;But it&#39;s still a wonderful place,&quot; Jenny answered, &quot;even before I became a were... I was falling in love with the town and with Harry. And after I became a were... and felt my bond Harry... I never want to leave this town. And even if you two don&#39;t become weres yourselves down the road... I want you to enjoy Moon Lake too... to feel free here. And to be loved here...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But they&#39;d let us become weres if we want to be, right?&quot; Janice asked, her mind still fluttering on the idea of being a weremermaid, particularly after learning that it was possible. Some the images she had of herself in that form were influenced by popular media, but that was about all she had. And Jenny had already shown that as a werefox she wasn&#39;t some mindless animal out to eat or mate with anyone that happened to be in the way.<br />
<br />
&quot;If that&#39;s your choice, yes,&quot; Jenny said slowly, &quot;though... it would probably be best to wait for the moment and not get too eager about anything. As once you become a were... you CAN&#39;T go back.&quot;<br />
<br />
John and Janice both nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... Janice... how was your day?&quot; Harry asked, &quot;things go well?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty much,&quot; Janice answered, &quot;your mom has shown me some things that she&#39;s stitched over the years. She&#39;s quite good... and has been very nice.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry smiled at that. His mother was pretty traditional in many respects, and had made various quilts and things like that for him and Huck over the years. They&#39;d been of good quality and included the top blanket on the bed that he presently shared with Jenny. From time to time his mother would show them off, and on some rare occasions someone bought one that she&#39;d made. She&#39;d even made friends with some of the weres in Moon Lake that enjoyed the same hobbies. From what Harry remembered, that had actually been one of the ways that his mother had more fully adapted to some of Moon Lake&#39;s more unique aspects.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m pretty sure she still has some friends that she meet up with from time to time for stitching and quilting... I&#39;m sure she&#39;d let you join if you want,&quot; Harry commented, &quot;at least while you&#39;re waiting for when you two can go to school.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe if it comes on a day when there isn&#39;t much going on,&quot; Janice commented, &quot;the thing I would like... is to find a friend, like John has with Ginger.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;m sure you will,&quot; Jenny assured her, &quot;You&#39;ll just have to be patient.&quot;<br />
<br />
John and Janice both nodded at that. While there were some things that he was privately puzzled on, John did at least like the idea of having a friend in Ginger. And in Moon Lake, John was at least sure that Jenny wouldn&#39;t get bent out of shape of him having friends. Janice was a bit more eager, but from what she&#39;d seen so far, Moon Lake didn&#39;t look bad and the possibilities would mean she could find good friends go from there. In this, she might be a bit more willing to make the decision as to whether or not to join a were group than John, but regardless... both of them did feel at home in the town, even after only being there for a couple of days.</p>
