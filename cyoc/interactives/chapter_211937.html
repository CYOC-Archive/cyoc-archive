<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Probably the best one yet. <br/>
- final edit before next chapter.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“…” thought Bull as he stared the important boy walking toward him, smiling his dopey smile, while feeling a warm happy feeling between his legs, drooling all the while. The only thing present in that otherwise empty head of his was the certainty that he must not piss or shit himself for the next 2 hours.<br />
<br />
Jeff continued to walk towards Bull as he heard Karl’s answer, noticing just how out of control his grampa daddy was getting, a small stain was already appearing on his beige pants over his decently sized erection. “Bull” he said to the man, who instantly perked up, opening his mouth, and saying “...” while standing there raising his arms as if he was trying to hug Jeff from a distance, all the while making needy empty faces at Jeff “He truly is mindless at the moment” thought Jeff, relishing on how much control he had over the -once respectable and proper- man, now little more than a meat puppet. “Please start thinking again, we have a guest with us, you shouldn’t be resting like this during work hours anyhow” he said to Bull, who with a strong shake of his head felt blood rushing to his head for the first time in what felt like hours.<br />
<br />
“BWUH” uttered the Principal in an undignified manner, flinching as if his brain was just turned off and on again, making Karl worried that something was still wrong with him, but still not moving from his guarding spot, since he had orders to follow “Orders from my -BOY-“he thought wistfully, unmoving while his cock jumped and trashed inside his cage, trying for the first time in over a decade to get hard, a minuscule stain appearing on his pants, almost imperceptible to the naked eye.<br />
<br />
Bull just stood there, wondering where the two idiots were, not remembering anything that had happened, but feeling that at least several minutes had transpired while he was in a daze. Now finding that his boy stood further away near the door, and one of the security guards, the freaky muscular one, was standing at attention near one of the windows.<br />
<br />
“Jeff my boy, what happened?” said Bull, “I seem to have lost track of time” he said while raising his arm over his pecs and checking his Rolex. Not noticing his subsiding erection or the stain that now adorned his once immaculate dress pants, since his massive pecs didn’t allow him to easily look down at himself.<br />
<br />
“I’m not sure Mr. Cowbell”, said Jeff -making Bull frown at hearing such a cold answer from Jeff- “You must have gotten tired and simply dozed off while standing there, I know the janitors can be a handful” Jeff said while pointing at the security guard with his head. Karl here found you and was about to get help when I came back inside. It’s been about half an hour since we talked” clarified Jeff.<br />
<br />
Now more in control of his faculties, Bull truly took notice of the freaky looking security guard standing dutifully to the side “Karl? Oh yes that was his name, for a second there I believed he was called something else” he thought, “But no, that’s his name. The guy has been working here almost as long as I have, remembered Bull, being a former alumnus, he was quickly hired when he expressed an interest in continuing with the security guard program, Lincoln’s High being a specialized school for manual labor, sports, and more physically oriented professions since its inception almost a hundred years ago, now also functioning as a community college for the try-state area, given that the campus was so large. Karl worked as the head of the guards, 3 in all”.  Rambled Bull to himself trying to gather his thoughts, still a little woozy from his near brain-dead experience.<br />
<br />
As Jeff stared at Bull, he noticed he still looked lightheaded, “seems like turning him into a zombie and draining some of his traits did a number on my poor gramps, he should be fine, but I should hurry up with my plan so he can rest and work on my homework”.<br />
<br />
Before Jeff could say anything, Bull spoke up “Mr. Sobaka, please remove yourself from the classroom and continue with your duties elsewhere, me and Jeff here must have a little discussion. We were sadly interrupted last time” said Bull grumblingly.<br />
Karl was in agony, he had to follow two sets of conflicting orders, and couldn’t bring himself to move or make a sound, he had to stand at attention and guard them BUT he also had to leave them, he just couldn’t bring himself to disobey his newfound love. However, his decades of training were too ingrained in him, too strong for his feeble mind. “His Boss made a direct order, as a security guard he MUST obey” he yelled at himself in his mind, while he yelled back in answer “BUT we are currently fulfilling -OUR BOY’s- orders, those have to take precedence, he is simply too important” His brain feeling like it was melting, becoming fried inside his head as his body remained stiff, only occasionally *twitching*.<br />
Bull looked annoyed at Karl as he just stood there after his clear command, all the while thinking to himself “This is the first time he takes more than a moment to fulfill an order, the guy is so dutiful that I kept him around even while he creeps out half the faculty and most of the students” thought Bull grumblingly “I may need to get rid of him, I have a feeling he is Jeff’s type”, he thought ruefully while staring at the guys chest. And just as he was about to repeat his order, “Mr. So...” he was rudely interrupted by Jeff.<br />
<br />
Jeff looked at Karl as he started getting red in the face, clenching his teeth, seemingly in physical pain, and realized what was happening not a moment too soon. <br />
<br />
“Karl!” he said, interrupting Bull, “please ignore Mr. Cowbell&#39;s command for now, and stand outside for a moment, you can resume your duties in a few minutes, just wait for now”.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, in another part of the building, a pair of burly Janitors worked in unison, cleaning in perfect harmony, and in record time, while one of them farted constantly *Fart*, carefully making sure he didn’t shit himself for the next 2 hours, and the other one scratched at himself whenever he wasn’t holding cleaning supplies, seemingly unbothered by the constant flatulence or the way his eyes were tearing up from the smell and the chemicals he was dutifully using. As Cliff shoved every piece of trash in the room onto his face, chomping away mechanically and efficiently instead of his usual messy manner, Ed started getting red in the face as he promptly fell to the floor, shaking from time to time, passed out cold, seemingly just having had a stroke. Cliff stared at Ed for a moment, mostly checking out the noise or if something had gotten dirty again, before continuing with his janitorial duties, now adding up the ones belonging to the other -seemingly incapacitated- Janitor.<br />
<br />
“Jeff my boy, not everyone listens to you the way I do, you can’t expect…” Bull began saying to Jeff, the words dying in his throat as he saw a relived looking Karl almost jump to obey Jeff, moving as fast as his bulbous body would allow him to, squishing himself through the door in a rush, probably injuring himself in the process.<br />
<br />
In another room a passed-out Ed *groaned* as he felt a few of his ribs *cracking*, not waking up, even as a few drops of blood fell from his right ear and nose, likely as an after effect of his stroke, his eyes half-lidded and looking in different directions. <br />
<br />
All the blood was dutifully cleaned by Cliff as he exited the room while heading on to the next one, having just stopped by for a moment to deal with the body on the floor, finding it too heavy to move out of the way and deciding -in his simplified mind- that since it was a person it must be ignored, going over him while *farting* a particular nasty one right over Ed’s face, as he *groaned* on the floor.<br />
<br />
Karl felt even more appreciation -if that was possible- for his newly found Boy as he was saved from himself. “I love my Boy, I LOVE MY BOY” he thought stupidly, while heading outside as fast as his booted feet could carry him, making sure to not drop his awesome sun glasses, nor wrinkle or tear away his uniform as he jammed himself through the door as fast as he could, putting the pressure on his trained abdomen, uncaring if he fractured his ribs again, having gotten used to the pain ages ago “A minimal price to pay for my duty, he had thought the first time it had happened”. Only now realizing, after squishing himself through the door and assuming his usual guard pose, that all the pain in his body, gained from years of training and abuse, was seemingly gone. Like it wasn’t even there in the first place, always reminding him of his job and duties. For a moment he felt a sense of loss, having found companionship in his pain over the lonely hours of the day, while working at his dream job, but realizing quickly that it had to have been due to finally talking with the love of his life “that had to be it” Karl thought frantically, “I suddenly get better of all my injuries as soon as I had a real chance to talk to Jeff” thought Karl excitedly “This is truly the happiest moment in my life, even better than when I finally got my dream job… well almost as good at that, but pretty close” he thought wryly, longing to touch himself all over and check all his former injuries, but deciding on staying in his -comfortable- guard pose, with his arms straining over his massive pecs and gut, making sure the love of his life was protected while he had a friendly conversation with the Director, as he was still on the clock after all, so his needs could wait until after his shift ended, in about 12 hours or so.<br />
<br />
Jeff *sighed* inside the room, finding the last few minutes exhausting, yet very entertaining, enjoying how cartoony his daddies were getting. Finally taking a good look at the now wide-awake Bull and deciding he would have to punish him for talking over him again. “I need to teach him a lesson; he must learn that there are consequences for speaking out of turn. I know he can’t help himself to try and take control, to be the confident, perfect Director, pillar of his community, while also being the lust-filled daddy for his boy, despite how both of those qualities often clashed, so he tries to take control whenever he can. And while it&#39;s funny watching him try to be both, I think it&#39;s better if I do something about it now rather than later. Besides I do need to change something just for him, now that the trait sharing thing applies to all my daddies&#39;&#39; thought Jeff in amusement.<br />
<br />
In a true show of intelligence, Bull remained silent as his boy stared at him, feeling like he had done something wrong, and dreading to upset his boy further, wisely deciding to leave him to his musings while he patiently waited. Only now and again staring at his Rolex, checking the time, and reminding himself about his many duties, chief among them, finishing up his boy’s homework. “Those teachers of his give him too much homework”, he thought grumpily, “I should fire the lot of them, but it will be next to impossible to find such manly men in so short notice” he mused, deciding then and there that he would start looking if time allowed, and, while his mind wandered, his nicotine starved body tried to reach out for his trusty pipe in his pocket, quickly realizing that it was nowhere to be found, as he started patting himself and looked at the floor trying to find the darn thing, unwittingly showing his boy his broad backside, letting him come to a decision that would affect Bulls life greatly going forward, in ways that would endlessly amuse Jeff.<br />
<br />
“Bull”, said Jeff to the crouching form of his grandpa daddy, as he looked back at him with a smile, from now on you have 2 personalities, one the shining example for the community, the upstanding pillar of this high school that everyone in town has grown to love and respect -That’s the current you-. This personality will only answer to “Mr. Cowbell, or Bill Cowbell, or The Principal &#39;&#39;, you will be unable to hear or recognize your old nickname -Bull- from here on onwards, at least when coming from me. For when I, and only I say the name -Bull- the second personality manifests.” Said Jeff, taking a *breath* before continuing.<br />
<br />
Bill Cowbell stared at his boy in an amused fashion, thinking he was too old for such games, but enjoying his boy’s attention just the same. Deciding on humoring him, he said “well my Boy, and this ’new personality’, how is he like? asked Bill in a fatherly way, in the manner a father speaks to his young son while he is being silly.<br />
<br />
Jeff smiled evilly and said, “Bulls personality is the opposite of Bill Cowbell, where he is prim and proper, Bull is crude and crass, while Bill is smart, Bull is but a dumbass, while Bill often dislikes Jeff other daddies, Bull thinks of them as his closest friends. The only things Bill and Bull have in common are that they are both crazy for their boy Jeff, a penchant for smoking pipes, if different blends, and the confidence they both exude, if for different reasons. Bills from his many years of experience and intelligence, and Bull’s from his stupidity and selfishness.” Finished Jeff.<br />
<br />
Bill continued to smile while gently *shaking* his head at his boy&#39;s antics, all the while saying: “Well now, that doesn’t sound nice at all, why would you want me to act like that? Said Bill, “maybe Bull should be…” he couldn’t even finish the phrase before Jeff simply said; “Wake up Bull” and watched the magic happen.<br />
<br />
Bill Cowbell closed his eyes after hearing his boy say something his mind could not process, and when he opened them again, a different man in the same body was standing there.<br />
<br />
Bull *shook* himself in a very animal-like manner *Brhuhhue* muttering incoherently, as if waking up from a long sleep, hitting his head with his palm *grunting* as he did so with an exaggerated frown on his face, and after a shaking his head one last time, he took a huge *breath* of air as if tasting it for the very first time, all the while scratching at his chest in an undignified manner.<br />
<br />
Jeff couldn’t be happier at the way his grandpa daddy was acting - one of his grandpa daddies, he corrected himself with a smile- he truly seemed like a completely different person, his mannerisms were all different. Whereas Bill looked inviting and warm, Bull felt like an animal, with a raw wildness to him.<br />
<br />
Bull touched and *sniffed* every part of himself he could get to, trying to familiarize himself with his body, not that he could even spell the word – familiarize-, but &#39;thought&#39; of the concept just the same. Starting with his wide manly nose, as his eyes crossed while looking at it, seemingly for the first time, taking notice of his bushy mustache as one of his big paws touched it in appreciation, liking it immediately -unlike Bill who only endured it for his boy&#39;s sake-. As he took notice of his hands, he &quot;sniffed&quot; and &quot;licked&quot; them, paying special attention to his fingers, enjoying the smell of his nails as he jabbed them one by one into his wide and manly nose, right through his stupid walrus mustache. Seemingly overwhelmed by all the new stimulus, he just stood there *grunting* all the while, trying to look at everything all at once. Appearing to the world as some kind of overdressed ape.<br />
<br />
After about a minute or two of rapidly cycling between all of his fingers at least twice, with a stupid wonder filled look on his face, he moved on to his bulky arms, where his once wondrous look swiftly turned into a frown at the things covering him. <br />
<br />
Whereas Bill&#39;s face often had a confident smile, Bulls resting face seemed to be a wide-open questioning look, with an animal-like intensity. Probably since he knew next to nothing -about anything really- and his simple mind got overwhelmed easily.<br />
<br />
After patting his arm for a bit, he got annoyed at the thing covering him, and with some difficulty, disposed of the jacket he was wearing, throwing it and his glasses to the side with little care, *snarling* in frustration at finding yet another thing covering him underneath the first one. Seemingly having a heavy dislike of clothing, especially this kind, in contrast to Bill, who loved wearing his expensive suits.<br />
<br />
At some point Bull realized he was wearing a tie, and after quickly *sniffing* and *licking* it decided that he hated it too and attempted -unsuccessfully- to remove it, finding it too hard to figure out how to open the thing, ending up pulling on it the wrong way, and choking himself making an*Ugh* sound, while *Snarling* in frustration.<br />
<br />
“Let me get that for ya” said Jeff to Bull while walking towards him, knowing deep inside that no matter how he acted, Bull would never hurt him, and feeling his connection to Bull stay just as strong as always, *chuckling* all the while at how cute the guy was acting, completely unafraid of the possible wild animal he had just unleashed.<br />
<br />
Bull *snarled* at the voice before he recognized that it came from his boy Jeff, and once he did, his demeanor changed. While he still looked intimidating, now he also looked eager, like an excited puppy staring at a new toy, or a kid opening a present from Santa. “BOY” he said in a rough sounding voice while looking at Jeff with an intense look, the first actual words he has spoken since &#39;waking up&#39; as Bull, “MY BOY” he clarified, pointing at Jeff and then at himself. “If he had a tail, it would be wagging so hard” thought Jeff with a smile – filing away that possibility for later- feeling the happiness exuding from Bull at the mere sight of him, while not noticing Bulls bulge as it began to throb.<br />
<br />
In a moment Jeff was next to Bull, reaching out to his neck, and in under a second, removed the offending tie. Once that was done, he decided on helping his now simpler grampa, using his hands to first cup a feel of Bulls massive chest, earning him a happy sounding *grunt* from Bull, and then starting to unbutton Bulls shirt, having the feeling that this animal disliked clothing. All the while Bull attempted to *sniff* Jeff, *huffing* in happiness trying to get more of the smell into his nose. Strangely without touching him, like he was waiting for something…<br />
<br />
“Boy removed choking thing” Bull said, “Bull likes Boy” he added simply, while his boy touched his chest *grunting* in pleasure as he did so, unabashedly checking out his boy in a manner Bill would never do, not even in private, licking his lips, feeling a rising need deep within his loins for his boy, and mostly ignoring his throbbing fuck-stick, considering his ass as far more important, in just the opposite way Bill would do.<br />
<br />
As his boy helped him out of the thing on his chest -Bull offering no resistance to his ministrations- he couldn&#39;t help admiring his boy as a series of sensations and concepts appeared on his simple mind, all focused on the important boy in front of him, since he was mostly unable to think using words anymore.<br />
<br />
Immediately after his boy was done, he pawed at himself with his big hands, enjoying the feeling of his bare torso for -what it felt to him -the first time in his life, looking in wonder at his furry chest, enraptured by how big and sensitive it was, enjoying the way his white hairs and perky nipples looked, and the way his midsection -tummy something told him- looked like. &quot;Bull like tits&quot; he said simply, while staring at his ample chest, as if stating a fact. &quot;Tummy nice too&quot; he added after a moment, raising his eyes to look at Jeff, as if waiting for his approval.<br />
<br />
Jeff admired the way his white-furred daddy looked like, &quot;he really takes care of himself&quot; thought Jeff delighted, &quot;hard to think the guy is in his 60&#39;s, with a body like that&quot; he thought with a hungry look in his eyes. Only realizing after a minute or so that Bull was looking at him expectedly, as if waiting for him to comment on his body.<br />
<br />
Jeff smiled at his daddy, as he took a few steps back to truly admire the whole specimen of a man in front of him, all the while saying &quot;looking good Bull, looking good&quot; with all the eloquence his young mind could muster while distracted by the daddy in front of him. Having seemingly forgotten about all his other daddies, including the giant of a security guard who stood only a few feet away.<br />
<br />
Bull gave Jeff a toothy smile, partially covered by his stupidly bushy mustache, and repeated &quot;Bull likes Boy&quot; in his gruff voice, taking a step away from the place he woke up in, for the first time, realizing as he tried to move that there were also things on his legs and feet? -Paws, something told him-. And so, with a *snarl* he pulled at the things as he tried to remove them by himself, not finding much success, since his paw-like hands seemed too big and uncoordinated to him, no matter how he pulled, like they weren&#39;t made to deal with things with precision. And as a testament to the quality of the pants, they didn&#39;t bulge or tear at all, as they were made by a local tailor to stretch comfortably over Bill muscular legs, who had a penchant for physical activity and needed sturdy yet classy looking dress pants. And so, Bull, unaware this, just couldn’t get the things off, and the more he pulled, the more discomfort he felt from the brown thing on his waist that held the damned things up. Getting more and more annoyed by the second *snarling* at the things in his legs as if to scare them into freeing him.<br />
<br />
Jeff just chuckled at Bull antics, realizing right away that he was trying to remove his pants without taking his belt or shoes off first. “He is SO CUTE now, kind of like a puppy, but even dumber” thought Jeff, not feeling scared at all of the 250 pounds -man- as he *snarled* at his pants in frustration.<br />
<br />
“Here let me help you again” he said to Bull, getting close to him once again, and *petting* him right on his head -like you would a puppy- distracting Bull with ease as he quickly forgot his pants in favor of staring at Jeff with an elated look on his face, while rising his muscular arms around Jeff in a hug-like motion, trying to force himself to hug him, but stopping just short of doing so, since Jeff hadn’t given him permission. So now Jeff had the big bear of a man surrounding him from all sides in a sort of- but not really- hug, while clearly not touching him, *panting* as he did so.<br />
<br />
Jeff just smiled ruefully, pushing on the big arms easily, as they offered no resistance to him, making Bull *pant* happily from his touch, while gently removing Bill&#39;s Rolex and putting it on his own wrist, seeing it as payment for having to deal with the animal, and laughing as the arms quickly rose again in the -not hug- pose “Well the commands I gave my grandpa daddy with the chronivac seem to apply to both personalities” thought Jeff somewhat disappointed, “good to know I guess” he thought… half hoping the wild animal would throw himself at him, blushing while imagining what would happen, all the while admiring the way the white furred torso of his daddy looked like… after taking a moment, he banished the thoughts so he could focus, Jeff was a patient man, and so he would take his time.<br />
<br />
While admiring the furry torso Jeff also realized the implications, &quot;that means Bull also has the mind controlling musk, the compulsion to hug people he likes, and his workaholic tendencies… that last one is weird for Bull&quot; realized Jeff, “what does a workaholic animal even looks like? Thought Jeff, Hell, what jobs can he even do now? Hugging people for money? Construction? I mean it could work If he does not have to interact with others that much… rambled on Jeff in his head as his animal-like daddy stared at him hungrily.<br />
<br />
A forgotten about Karl stood just outside the classroom door, wondering just what the hell was going on with the Principal and -his- boy,  wondering if he should do or say something, but having the once in a lifetime bright idea, that he should mind his own business and just stay there guarding the perimeter, falling on his security guard instincts for guidance, as he had the certainty that whatever he did now would most definitely end up badly for him.<br />
<br />
As for the Janitors, Ed was coming around to, still feeling the compulsion to be the perfect Janitor, but finding his body uncooperating, just knowing without a shadow of a doubt that he couldn’t piss or shit himself for at least the next 2 hours or so, trying and failing to get up, all the while clutching his bruised right side.<br />
<br />
Cliff was finishing up the next room, mechanically shoving old bubble gum he had found stuck to one of the tables into his mouth, directly swallowing it. Next, he realized the vacuum cleaner was full, and so his Janitor brain had the bright idea to dump the contents of the vacuum in a garbage bag, along with some leftover cleaning supplies to get it wet enough and then starting to shove all the dust-turned-muck into his mouth, freeing up the vacuum cleaner for the next room. Chomping away mechanically and efficiently as his stomach got even more distended, *farting* all the while, but making sure not to piss or shit himself for the next 2 hours.<br />
<br />
Back in the classroom, Bull *grunted* In frustration, the things on his body were still there, as his boy worked away at the brown thing on his waist, making him desperate to feel his boy touch his actual body, and not through the things, *squirming* in need. He so wanted to touch his boy, to hold him in his arms, and have him fuck him senseless. His behind was on fire, his need too much for him to bear, and so he did the only thing his addled mind could think off to get his boys attention. He “whined”.<br />
<br />
*Hrrmm* *Whiiine* *Hrrmm* Jeff heard as he worked away at his daddy’s waist, finding the belt a bit too tight to easily remove, not helped by the fact that Bull kept *squirming* trying and failing to get closer to him. Just then Jeff realized his daddy was not snarling and grunting anymore, he was making a different sound, a far cuter one. Jeff looked up and saw Bull with tears in his eyes making puppy-like noises at him, practically screaming at him - in his own stupid way - just how much he wanted to touch Jeff.<br />
<br />
“Jeff …Hug... Please” managed to say Bull between his *whines*and *whimpers* trying to sound cute, but using the same gruff voice from before, in a way that pushed all Jeff&#39;s buttons. <br />
<br />
Seeing the state of his daddy, Jeff couldn&#39;t be happier. “THIS is what he wanted, the dapper daddy is fine and all, but a needy stupid one? It&#39;s just unbeatable” thought Jeff happily. “The Bill personality is fine for day-to-day stuff, as I enjoy him as a working adult, but a snarling animal-like daddy has his own appeal too, and it&#39;s truly fortunate that they are both the same person,” thought Jeff with a smirk.<br />
<br />
“If you want to hug me, then STOP moving around so much, and let me remove the rest of your clothing, I know you don’t like them, I’m just trying to help you out of them” Jeff told Bull patiently, talking to Bull, a man over 3 times his age, in the way you would to a pet or small child.<br />
<br />
Bull *whined* one last time before falling silent, still holding his arms around Jeff, but stopped squirming to let his boy do his job, trusting him implicitly, and knowing he should always let others take point, talk and work things out first before trying to assist, he should never ever lead, nor that he cared to, being too focused on himself and his boy (This of course being a mirror of the way Bill would act, often taking command as soon as he was able to, while being truly concerned about others well-being) “This daddy is shaping off to be quite the submissive animal,” thought Jeff drily, probably for the best, since Mr. Cowbell could be a bit overbearing, thus giving the same man a different flavor” he mused. <br />
<br />
Finally, Jeff was able to remove Bulls’ classy belt, discarding it with the rest of his clothes. Admiring the way Bull’s torso looked almost naked. “This old man takes good care of himself” repeated Jeff to himself, as he calmly stared at the muscular and plump torso, covered in white hairs, and crowned by two massive mounds of fat and muscle, with a huge cleft between them... And a needy looking face resting on top, staring at him with a pleading look in his eyes, and a too-big bushy walrus mustache, that still looked ridiculous on him.<br />
<br />
Jeff smiled as he got to work on the big loafers. “Raise your right leg” he commanded Bull, who carefully raised it, now wanting to hurt his boy, while still having his arms raised around Jeff in the -not hug- pose.<br />
<br />
Jeff could not help it and started laughing, his daddy looked ridiculous, the big, popular, and powerful Mr. Cowbell, that from his new memories was the most well-known man in town, having not run for mayor due to a heavy dislike of politics, but still dabbling his influence here and there. Was standing precariously, balancing on only one leg, while both of his arms were too busy hugging nothing.<br />
<br />
Bull just frowned at his boy, unable to understand why he was laughing or at what, too busy using his meager brain power to avoid falling on his butt, to even consider the possibility of stopping his still impossible hugging attempt.<br />
<br />
Deciding to take pity on his animal-like daddy, Jeff took a hold of the right loafer and gently removed it from the massive foot. Letting loose a putrid cheesy and sweaty smell that almost made Jeff drop the foot in surprise. “Shoot I forgot about that for a second there” He thought with a surprised look on his face, “I had gotten so used to his smell that I didn’t expect it to just jump at me like that” he said while holding the massive foot. “Here, hold this,” he said to Bull, handing him the shoe. “Play with it or something, while I finish up down here.” He said, trying to distract his daddy, as he was starting to *whimper* again.<br />
<br />
Bull looked at the thing his Boy handed to him with anime-like curiosity, grabbing at it with both hands, but before he could inspect it, his boy removed yet another thing from his foot, finally freeing it. Bull *growled* in appreciation, enjoying the way his boy touched his foot, wiggling his toes in happiness, elated at the direct feel of his boy on his body. Enjoying himself immensely as he noticed the way his boy stared at his paw? foot? -he wasn&#39;t sure, but it didn&#39;t seem to matter-.<br />
<br />
After a minute or so of wiggling his toes like a child, to the endless amusement of Jeff, Bull caught a *whiff* of an interesting odor coming from the thing in his hands, deciding to bring it closer to his face, wanting to inspect it in the way his instincts told him to, by *sniffing* it. And *Sniff*he did, as he brought it near his face, the powerful foot funk hit him like a truck, overwhelming his tiny brain with a heavenly smell, second only to his boy’s, but much stronger at the moment, feeling his eyes roll into his head in pleasure, almost falling on his butt with how strongly he suddenly thrust the thing to his face, making his useless cock jump inside the too tight thing.<br />
<br />
For his part Jeff was enjoying the feel of the warm foot on his hands, watching, and almost giggling at the way the toes curled, noticing the white hairs all over the top of the foot, petting it and finding the smell a lot more bearable without the damp sock – that he saved to feed it to Cliff later on in the night – before he heard his daddy start *grunting* in earnest, and felt rather than saw how he just SHOVED the shoe into his nose, *inhaling* the putrid smell of an entire day worth of foot funk.<br />
<br />
Jeff raised his eyes to find Bull having the time of his life with the shoe, *kissing* it all over and sniffing the inside for all he was worth, turning it around in a way that allowed his nose to smell the inside as much as possible, just shoving his handsome face into it, *moaning* loudly as he did so, very unlike Bill - who even in his wilder moments tried to control himself a bit, while he only endured his own foot funk at Jeff’s request-, all with no decorum, unabashedly doing so, uncaring of how stupid he looked or who might even hear.<br />
<br />
Jeff dropped the foot in surprise, staring wide eyed at his animal-like daddy and at the gigantic yet ignored erection that stubbornly stood against the confine of his pants, just a few centimeters away from Jeff’s own face. He couldn’t help himself and *petted* the thing, expecting quite the reaction from Bull, but finding none. “Huh… how odd, thought Jeff, maybe it’s because Bill was more of a top? Does that mean that Bull is…” but before he could finish the thought, he saw an opportunity to take the shoe off Bulls hands.<br />
<br />
Bull righted himself instinctually once Jeff let go of his foot, only getting distracted enough to stop his *sniffing* session once the foot touched the cold floor of the classroom. Making him interested enough in the new sensation to allow Jeff to take the shoe off his hands, having realized that Bull would never drop it if he did not take it now. And he wanted to keep playing with his daddy, they were only getting started after all.<br />
<br />
Bull wiggled his toes in happiness feeling the comforting weight of his body on his bare sole for the very first time. Only noticing, after a second or two, that the nice smelling thing was nowhere to be found. As he looked at Jeff for help, he didn’t notice the nice smelling thing drop near the other -useless- things. Too busy staring at the love of his life, his boy, who was helping him out so much. “BOY” he said in his deep growly voice.<br />
<br />
Jeff met Bull&#39;s needy unblinking gaze before saying, “Now raise your left foot, you dummy&quot;, with a wide smile on his face.<br />
<br />
Bull smiled dumbly, still looking lustfully at Jeff, and proceeded to do just that, using one of his idle hands to enjoy the feel of his furry torso, while the other one went to a more prominent place, what he genuinely wanted to play with, his butt.<br />
<br />
Jeff took no notice of this, being mostly body blocked by Bull&#39;s bulk -and his distracting pulsing bulge-, all the while attempting not to move his daddy too much to try and help him retain his balance, as he only saw him pawing at his belly while gently raising his left foot, while he wobbled a bit precariously. He quickly removed both the shoe and the sock – saving the latter for Cliff- now far more prepared to face the foot funk. <br />
<br />
Bull&#39;s left foot looked mostly the same as his right one, having a similar funk as well, “Of course my perfect daddy would have perfect proportions, even his feet are handsome” thought Jeff wryly as he let the foot gently down, admiring the perfect pair of stinky feet in front of him.<br />
<br />
Once again what caught Jeff attention were the *grunting* sounds coming from his daddy, who he now realized was using both hands to play with his butt. Having dropped his pants and underwear just low enough to allow easy access. Using one of his paw-like hands to spread the cheeks and shoving the other inside as far as it would go, all the while staring at Jeff with a hungry look on his face, drooling with need.<br />
<br />
“Yup, most definitely a bottom” thought Jeff, “and a needy one at that” he added.<br />
<br />
Bull burned with need, he needed his boy inside of him right now, but he still had stupid things on him that didn’t let him move freely, and his boy had told him to stop moving around so much, so he had to listen to him first, and then worry about his needs. “He was Jeff&#39;s daddy, and Jeff&#39;s needs came first, even a dumbass like him knew that” he &#39;thought&#39; pridefully.<br />
<br />
Enjoying the way Bull looked at him, Jeff went back to the grueling work of removing the pants and underwear of a too excited adult man over three times his senior. Finding the most troublesome part to be the iron hard cock, which was still being ignored by Bull, and was stretching the clothing to the limit, not allowing Jeff to easily pull down the pants. Getting tired of the struggle, Jeff decided to take some of Karl&#39;s strength, -who he had every intention of rewarding after he finished this play session, since he had the good sense to not interrupt him while being dumb as a plank- and just pull the pants straight down, finally removing the fuck-stick from his too-tight confines.<br />
<br />
The cock was a thing of beauty, it proudly stood at almost nine inches with a glistening head of pre, not having cummed despite all the evenings ministrations, making Jeff amazed at the sight, since he wasn&#39;t consciously aware of some of the rules the Chronivac had given his daddies, having taken them from Jeff inner desires when transforming all the men; chief among them; -daddies do not need release, a daddy already did his job when making his boy- and “a daddy is always ready and willing for his boy-, two core inner-truths for all his daddies.<br />
<br />
Finally, Jeff stood up, having removed all of Bull&#39;s clothing, instructing him to raise one foot after the other, allowing him to remove the offensive constricting items, discarding them to the side and finally admiring his whole daddy, in all his naked glory, for what felt like the first time. Quickly realizing that it was in fact the first time, since he had only made most of the horny changes after his memories were already altered, quickly recalling that for all of Bill’s neediness of him, he had managed to stay mostly composed, only getting intimate a few times while no one was around. “Damn it old man, you only got to second base, freaking prude” Thought Jeff in mock anger while wearing a smile on his face, while enjoying the warm happy feeling of the new memories. &quot;Still, I did love the attention&quot; thought Jeff,  “good thing I kept that side of him intact, it&#39;s cute in a way for an older man to act like that, since he was showing me respect.” added Jeff, while looking at the naked animal-man standing in front of him, *grunting* in need, with most of his right hand stuffed down his own butt, as his ignored cock jumped wildly.<br />
<br />
Still, Bull has his charms too. Thought Jeff.<br />
<br />
Bull could not take it anymore, he had tried showing his boy just how much he needed him, and the too-smart boy didn’t seem to take the hint, just staring at him with that perfect smile of his, making him even needier. But before he could start *whimpering* again to get his attention, his boy finally moved, rightfully ignoring his useless fuck-stick and going straight for his face, kissing him on the lips and grabbing a hold of Bulls massive shelve like pecs.<br />
<br />
With a*slurp*-like sound, Bull stopped trying to shove his hand into his butt, dropping both to the side, as his simple mind was too overwhelmed by the touch of his perfect boy on his lips and chest, their faces being close enough so that he could get lost in his boy&#39;s eyes as he took an involuntary *whiff* of his face, almost passing out at the feel of his boy&#39;s heavenly smell.<br />
<br />
Before Jeff allowed his daddy to touch him, he made a change to him with his ability. “While Bull is the personality in control his ass produces no waste, being clean of all feces, absorbing the ones already present back into the body to be shit out by Bill at a later time, gathering all of them for as long as Bull remains awake” thought jeff staring at his grampa daddy’s needy eyes, stealing a quick glance to his right hand, finding it clean once again. “If Cliff was here, I may have just made him clean and prep Bull, but since he is not here, I find this to be more convenient” Thought Jeff. And as for lube well…<br />
<br />
Using Karl’s strength, he not quite-gently pulled on his daddy shoulders making him drop to his knees with a startled *Yelp*, grabbing a hold of his head tenderly, kneading it, while ruining Bills carefully stilled hairdo. As he got comfortable for what was coming.<br />
<br />
“Boy strong” thought Bull with a surprised look in fish face. “Bull liked that” he said in his gruff voice, having calmed himself a bit now that his boy had finally started touching him, too engrossed in the warm feeling of Jeff hands on his dumbass head to care about the pain on his knees, that quickly disappeared anyhow, like the one from his ass had a moment ago.<br />
<br />
“Bull” said Jeff in a commanding tone, making the neediness in Bull&#39;s ass rise once again, “Suck” he said simply as he dropped his own pants, revealing his very own veiny cock, standing at just shy of 8 inches, that while smaller than his Daddy&#39;s -at least for now - he cared about, unlike Bulls did with his. Grabbing a hold of Bulls head with one hand, as he guided his cock toward his face with the other.<br />
<br />
Bull needed no further encouragement, taking first a tentative *sniff* and *lick* of the tantalizing fuck-stick before him, quickly realizing that he loved it, opening his maw wide and attempting to swallow it whole -with quite more eagerness than skill- only managing to take about half the thing inside his mouth before having to remove it, *gagging* and *spluttering* unaccustomed to the invasive feeling -since Bill was a straight man before realizing his love for Jeff, so he had never ever given a blowjob before, not having any muscular memory related to it-, but going right back in there, trying again and again, and every time managing to push it just a little further, while *gagging* less and less, *grunting* in happiness with every thrust of Jeff, as Bull pushed in time with his boy, trying to impale himself on the fuck-stick and get his nose as close to his boys crotch as possible. All the while ignoring his own cock, which jumped wildly with each force-filled thrust, making a mess of pre everywhere, hitting Jeff&#39;s legs from time to time.<br />
<br />
Jeff was in heaven, the feel of his muscular and manly daddy on his cock was unlike anything he had ever experienced, the eagerness with which Bull sucked him while impaling himself on his crotch, made him feel loved in a way he hadn’t realized he needed, satisfying a thirst he didn&#39;t even know he had. “You may hug me” he told the old man on his knees, whose simple mind was too overwhelmed - as his paws were busy fondling his chest while sucking Jeff off - to consciously hear what Jeff had just said. But his body knew, and as soon as Jeff finished talking, Bull&#39;s arms jumped at the chance, finally unleashed, as they swiftly wrapped themselves around Jeff&#39;s legs bringing himself closer in a flash, pressing his ample chest against Jeff&#39;s legs forcefully *groaning* and *moaning* unabashedly, as his chest finally made contact with Jeff&#39;s body, fulfilling one of his most basic needs -To Hug Jeff-, feeling it to be -almost- better than the cock in his mouth, which he didn&#39;t ever considered dropping even for a second, since it belonged to his perfect boy.<br />
<br />
For his part Jeff realized that he might have made Bull’s need to hug him constantly a little too strong, going by the sounds he was making and the way it reinvigorated his sucking. But it did not feel too important now, considering that his daddy was still *sucking* happily away while *moaning* like a cheap slut. <br />
<br />
Jeff could feel the way his daddy&#39;s hand grabbed needly at his legs, roaming, massaging, and pushing his body harder against the all-too-willing mouth, finally grabbing a hold of Jeff&#39;s butt and not letting go. This pushed Jeff over the edge as he started thrusting even harder against his daddy’s face, uncaring if it hurts him, finally making contact with the back of his throat, and with the feel of Bulls bushy mustache on his crotch, Jeff came hard down his daddy’s throat.<br />
<br />
Bull&#39;s simple mind was so overwhelmed with all the stimulus, that his -small- rational side was long gone, burned away by his need. Now only his animal side remained, and it NEEDED that important cock inside of him, nothing else mattered -NOTHING-. Now that his boy had allowed him to hug him, and having fulfilled that basic need, his body wanted nothing more than to pleasure his son with the best tool for the job. His dumbass head. *COCK, COCK, COCK, COCK…” he thought on repeat as his boy abused his mouth unabashedly, making him proud, as he realized he was meant to be used like this, like a simple tool, like the beast that he is, uncaring about silly things like self-respect -once again in a reverse of Bill qualities-. And with a final mighty thrust his boy forced himself down Bull&#39;s throat, allowing Bull&#39;s face to finally reach his boy&#39;s crotch, letting him take a deep *whiff* of it, imprinting his boy smell on his stupid mind as the boy selfishly cummed down his throat.<br />
<br />
Bull was so proud of himself, giddy with the knowledge that Jeff&#39;s baby batter had safely landed inside his tummy, elated at how useful he had been for his boy, regardless of his own needs -in a rare show of commonality with Bill-.<br />
<br />
Jeff *panted* in exhaustion staring as his daddy gently removed his spent cock from his face, as he loudly *swallowed* what felt to Jeff were gallons of his cum, all the while  *kissing* and *sniffing* all over his cock and crotch area, quietly *moaning* and *grunting* lovingly, -like he was trying to imprint Jeff&#39;s smell on his small brain-, staining his face and mustache with Jeff&#39;s juices. “He probably is,” thought Jeff, “like a simple animal, he is marking himself with his mate&#39;s smell.” thought Jeff in wonder. And the best part was, his daddy was still ignoring his own throbbing monster, which continued to jump between Jeff&#39;s feet, seemingly angry at being ignored, while causing a pool of pre to appear on the floor. Bull having forgotten about the thing entirely.<br />
<br />
Jeff spent a few minutes gathering himself as he enjoyed the feeling of his manly daddy on his crotch, all the while *petting* him like he was a dog, hearing him *grunting* in appreciation while he hugged him. And just as he was about to push his daddy away, he felt the pool of pre reach the sole of his shoes, “The Janitors might want to clean the room again” thought Jeff wryly… “OH SHIT, the Janitors!” exclaimed Jeff loudly, making both Bull and the enraptured Karl jump in surprise.</p>
