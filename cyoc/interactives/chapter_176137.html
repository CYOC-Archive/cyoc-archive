<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"> – Two Months Later –<br />
<br />
You knew it was time. Your belly had just spasmed in pain as your ‘puppies’ signalled that they were ready to be born. You paced around for an hour as Vicky got everything ready for the delivery.<br />
<br />
When you had started showing, she had renovated one of the horse’s stalls into a safe place for you to deliver your litter. Clean blankets and towels covered the floor and instinct had driven you to pick out one of the farthest corners from the stall’s entryway to make up a little den, you now paced around it fearfully as Vicky tried to help you prepare.<br />
<br />
Eventually, you could no longer ignore your instincts and laid down on your side, you began breathing heavily as nature took control.<br />
 <br />
This isn’t happening! This isn’t happening! You repeated to yourself, panting harshly, and wincing as one after another the contractions began to hit, Vicky stayed at your side throughout all of it, keeping a monitor on your pulse and breathing. “Don’t fight it Princess,” she instructed, “you’re body knows what to do, just let it happen.”<br />
<br />
Suddenly feeling a contraction bite deeply into your belly, you gave a little yelping cry and arched up, rolling over as if to stand, but Vicky was instantly there, comforting you, she gently put you back onto your side.<br />
<br />
“Push Princess, just push when you feel like you can,” she coaxed, her hands stroking your head, comforting you, as she wiped your tear-streaked muzzle, whining, your body tensed painfully again as another contraction pulled at your insides.<br />
<br />
“Push, come on, push that puppy out, you can do it,” Vicky encouraged, watching as you panted and pushed, clenching your eyes shut in pain as you felt a large object begin to pass into your birth canal and slowly emerge out from your swollen vagina.<br />
<br />
Oh God, this isn’t happening!!! You continued to repeat to yourself, even as you grunted and pushed your first puppy further out into the world, finally it slithered free from you in a rush of bloodied liquids.<br />
<br />
“Good girl! Look your first puppy!” Vicky said, stroking your head as you whimpered, allowing your primitive canine instincts to lead, as you reached out, and with your sharp, white fangs cleanly tore the birthing sack open, letting the tiny struggling animal trapped within free.<br />
<br />
Licking the blood and embryotic fluids from its soft short fur you soon cleared its airways; the puppy immediately began yelping and whining its new-born distress.<br />
<br />
Locking your amazed eyes on the damp little furry thing that had just been born from your body, you watched closely as Vicky very gently touched and stroked the puppy, while you licked and nosed your new born, marking his scent forever in your mind.<br />
<br />
Looking at the puppy, your mind raced with the finality of the situation; you had just given birth. You were now a mother, it was inconceivable, but that didn’t make it any less true.<br />
<br />
Blind and seemingly immobile, the male puppy continued yelping piteously, overcome with concern for your pup you anxiously nudged him towards your milk-engorged teats urging him to feed from your body.<br />
<br />
“Your first little one,” Vicky smiled, watching as the pup searched out one of your teats with his tiny jaws before quickly grabbing hold and starting to nurse, relieving some of the pressure in your overly-full canine teats as he enjoyed his first meal.<br />
<br />
Suddenly your body tensed as you began the birthing process again, giving birth to another puppy shortly thereafter, and then another. Around three hours after it had first begun, six beautiful pups had been born.<br />
<br />
All had pure black coats, and were breathing normally, it was a clean birth and a healthy litter.<br />
<br />
Vicky cooed over your new-born’s, congratulating you, she stroked and petted you, praising you warmly as you nudged the last puppy to a nipple to drink, curling around your little family protectively.<br />
<br />
“What a beautiful sight, a mother and her puppies,” Vicky crooned, “and you might not be the only canine mother around here soon.”<br />
<br />
That got your attention, you looked up at her sharply, both your ears swivelling to face her.<br />
<br />
“I’ve been talking with a couple of my supervisors recently, and they’ve been thinking they might expand our operation, maybe form a business alliance with the ‘Kennel for a Day’ people in order to get some of our customers to start walking their dogs and scooping us up another dog into the bargain.”<br />
<br />
“Most of those animals are purebreds, and the new dog becomes an exact copy of the one they walked, other than the reversal of gender of course. And just think, as soon as we start breeding them, well… there’s a lot of money to be made in such an enterprise. If it takes off, I’ll make sure you get first pick of any stud’s that return, maybe even transform a few yourself, only the best for my girl.”<br />
<br />
Hearing that made your sore canine vagina twitch, as much as it disgusted you, you were almost looking forward to the day when some handsome new canine stud or other mounted you, and scratched that particular, carnal itch that oestrus inspired in your body.<br />
<br />
Shivering at the thought, you shook your head slightly. Right now you could give no thought to the future, what would be, would be. You knew if the time came that Vicky wanted to breed you with some stud, that you would be given no choice about it happening, it was a hard pill to swallow, but you’d long accepted that your destiny was no longer in your own hands.<br />
<br />
A few minutes later, after Vicky had cleaned the delivery site up, and checked each puppy over one last time, she gave you some time alone with them, letting you all snuggle up together.<br />
<br />
Looking down again, you couldn’t help but feel a genuine rush of maternal affection for your puppies, feeling them all suckling away there. They were beautiful, and despite the odd and obscene manner of their conception you couldn’t find it in yourself to regret it now.<br />
<br />
The birthing had exhausted you, and laying out on your side you found your mind drifting to the past; the last couple of months had been anything but easy, new cruelties, new indignities had been heaped upon you daily after your return to the Stable. You’d been forced to see that a lot of your previous freedoms, that as a human you’d taken for granted, were now in the past and would stay there forever.<br />
<br />
The only thing that kept you strong through all of these trials was Jessica, she was your rock, and you were hers, though her belly had begun to swell with her first foal, she and you kept each another company, you never spoke of course, but you had your own sort of silent communication based on feelings and emotions, it wasn’t much but it was enough for the two of you.<br />
<br />
And despite what she’d said, Vicky rarely kept the two of you apart, the only reason she wasn’t here with you right now was that the birthing stall had to be kept as sterile as possible and there had been a real danger that she might have contaminated it.<br />
<br />
Already you were missing her presence though, you felt a hole inside. You hoped Vicky would let you see one another tomorrow, you wanted to introduce her to your puppies, wanted to show her that despite everything this had made you happy.<br />
<br />
Jessica and you had finally found your place in this new world, maybe it was one that neither of you had ever wanted, maybe it was one that neither of you had ever imagined possible, but you were together, and together you could face the future without fear, because in the end that was all that you ever needed.</p>
