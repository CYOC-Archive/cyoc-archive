<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>For the next few minutes, the only thing that could be heard in 
Jenny's room was the sound of her getting dressed and complaining 
about random missing garments. Before long however, Jenny was dressed 
and about ready to head out, or at least, that was the plan.
<br>Just as she was about to do so however, her balance began to sway 
as her vision blurred. At first she thought it was just a bit of a 
rush to the head, but she seriously began to worry as it grew worse 
and her throat began to tighten.
<br>Panic began to set in as she realised something was very, very 
wrong. Her heart, racing with sudden adrenaline, pounded in her ears 
as they began to ring, further disorienting her.

<p><i>What was happening to her?</i> She desperately wondered as her 
skull pounded, each pulse diminishing her sight and lessening her 
breathing.

<p>It was at that moment a sudden realisation hit her. As she 
panicked, some part of her mind was frantically searching her memories 
for something that could help or explain what was happening to her, 
and it had just found its answer.
<br>The mocking echo of Kyle's curse lingered in her head for an 
instant before pain pushed it away again.
<br>That was it. The curse was real and was now taking effect, just as 
she had cast it out of her mind as a prank.
<br>Now it all made sense. Her head pounded because it was shrinking, 
her throat was tight because it was vanishing and her eyes and ears 
were confused because they were fading away.

<p>10 seconds later, she was no longer able to breath as her throat 
closed up. Instinctively, she grabbed for it, but instead found 
herself holding what seemed to be a smaller version of her face. In 
front of her loomed an indistinct dark shape, but her eyes had 
diminished so much, she could make out no more than that.

<p>She wanted to scream, but could make no sound, and so was forced to 
wait without breath as the rest of her head slowing slipped away and 
her mind did the only logical thing it had left; shut down.

<p>
<br>It was some time later when Jenny woke up on the floor.
<br>It was pitch black and she was dizzy. Trying to piece together 
what happened, she took a deep breath...then stopped.
<br>She felt something strange in her crotch, like some sort of 
strange vibration. Was something in her panties?
<br>Still holding her breath, she reached down to her crotch, but felt 
nothing out of place. She started to breath a sigh of relief, but then 
the sensation returned, along with a small just of air onto her 
hand....from the inside.

<p>Slowly but surely, recollection followed by realisation set in.

<p>“No...” she begged, “Please no”

<p>But alas, she felt her crotch move as she talked out of her vagina. 
Were she not so terrified, she would have found that she would have 
been getting slightly aroused from the sensation, but fear was 
overriding arousal at the moment.

<p>She quickly pulled her hand away in shock as she tried to take 
stock of the rest of her situation. Clearly she could hear, as she had 
just heard her own voice, even if it had been a bit muffled, so why 
couldn't she see?

<p>Of course, the answer was that she still had her top on, which 
covered where her new eyes should be. As she worked that out, she 
quickly took her top off, noting the distinct lack of head as she did 
so. As her bra came off, light flooded into her sight, something which 
was both good, as she could see again, but bad as it confirmed she was 
seeing from her breasts.

<p>Attempting to look around the room, Jenny found she could not move 
her eyes like she could before. The only way to change the direction 
she was looking was to point her breasts in a different direction, 
either by turning her torso, or by moving her breasts with her hands.

<p>Looking in the mirror on the wall of her room, she could now 
observe her new body. Other than her missing head, she looked just the 
same as ever; even her now optic breasts looked the same.
<br>Quickly taking off her skirt and panties, she nervously positioned 
herself so she could see between her legs in the mirror.

<p>“Umm...Hello?” she tested with a shaky voice and gasped in horror 
as she observed her slit moving to form the words.

<p>This was too much. She couldn't bear to look at herself any more as 
she got up and dashed back to bed, her perspective jiggling every step 
of the way.
<br>Tucking herself under the covers, she tried to go back to sleep, 
something which was not helped by her apparent inability to close her 
new eyes.
<br>Eventually she began to cry, only to cry harder when she found 
that instead of tears, she was now weeping little droplets of milk. 
Before long however, she managed to drift off, leaving a small milky 
smear on her sheets where she had wept.</p>
