<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff walked over to his computer and sat down with a weak smile.<br />
His resolve to keep moving forward had filled him with a renewed confidence.<br />
He could do this. He could get through this.<br />
<br />
He decided to channel this confidence into a few rounds of one of his favorite video games. As he dodged explosions and blasted his virtual opponents to pieces with his rocket launcher, he felt at peace. This was familiar, this was normal.<br />
His brain was practically on autopilot, and it was a welcome reprieve from his troubled thoughts.<br />
<br />
Before long he had lost track of time, and when he finally decided to close the game he was shocked to see that the sun was already setting.<br />
&quot;Might as well start my search.&quot; he thought, opening up his web browser.<br />
<br />
Just as he was about to type the keywords into his search engine of choice, he realized that the tabs from earlier were still open, and he was greeted by the image of an attractive asian woman wearing nothing but a strap-on dildo.<br />
Quickly opening a new tab and navigating to the search bar, he entered the name of his home town and &quot;magic shop&quot; in quotation marks.<br />
<br />
Predictably, most of the results were for shops that sold magic kits and other novelties. As he scrolled through the list, he though about how best to narrow down the search, but he also found his mind wandering back to the woman in the strap-on.<br />
<br />
Distracted, he reopened the tab for another good look. The beautiful asian lady was easily a 10 out of 10, and her perfect breasts were significantly larger than average but still totally natural looking. As his eyes traced her perfect body, he felt a tingle of reassurance that he was still a healthy teenage boy and he was still attracted to the female form.<br />
The tingle settled in his groin, and while he was used to the physical feeling of arousal, this time it was accompanied a new sensation entirely.<br />
<br />
He no longer had a penis, so there was no feeling of hardness. Instead, a new, more difficult to define sensation was spreading through his pussy, centered on what he assumed was his new clit.<br />
Soon he was rubbing his thighs together, flushed with shame. The tingling warmness between his thighs was begging for stimulation and he felt like this desire wasn&#39;t going to go away on its own.<br />
<br />
He brought his index and middle finger to his mouth and moistened them. &quot;Is this seriously happening? Am I seriously about to do this?&quot; he thought to himself. But it was too much to resist.<br />
<br />
Jeff unzipped his jeans and slid his hand down into his boxers. Focusing his eyes on the image of the attractive woman rather than the business down below, Jeff experimentally touched the entrance to his new anatomy and jumped at the electric sensation.<br />
After catching his breath, he hesitantly tried again, bringing his moistened finger tips to the topmost part of his pussy where he could feel his clit begging for attention.<br />
The first stroke sent a jolt and a shudder through his whole body and he nearly let out a yelp.<br />
<br />
Closing his eyes, Jeff began to imagine the nude asian woman standing before him. He imagined kissing her passionately, then fondling and caressing her sizable breasts. As these images played through his mind, he continued to rub at his clit slowly and carefully, still uncomfortable and inexperienced with pleasuring his new anatomy.<br />
The sensations sent shockwaves of pleasure through his body, feeling somewhat similar to what he had felt when he masturbated with his penis, but also incredibly alien and new.<br />
<br />
Picturing himself suckling and licking the woman&#39;s breasts, Jeff gritted his teeth and began to enthusiastically rub at the sensitive outer parts of his pussy. Still uncomfortable with the idea of penetration, his fingers slid up and down his slit, focusing on the painfully sensitive nub of his clitoris. The sensations had him rocking back and forth in his chair and a trickle of drool escaped from his lips.<br />
As he tilted his head back, eyes still clenched shut and pleasure rocking his body, Jeff was startled out of his masturbation session by a sudden yelp behind him.<br />
<br />
Whipping his hand out of his jeans and turning around to look over his shoulder, he just managed to catch Emily ducking out of sight back into the hallway.<br />
<br />
After a seconds-long pause that felt like an eternity she quietly whimpered, &quot;Sorry! I didn&#39;t mean to-&quot;<br />
Another pause.<br />
&quot;I just wanted to tell you that dinner&#39;s ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff was frozen in shock. How much had she seen? Not knowing what to do in this situation, he simply waited for Emily to leave, paused for a few minutes to catch his breath, then awkwardly shuffled out into the hallway.<br />
<br />
He went downstairs to eat dinner with his family and as before, they were all cheerful and supportive. His mother once again asked how he was recovering and his father wanted to know if he&#39;d be ready to go back to school soon.<br />
&quot;Maybe in a couple of days.&quot; Jeff muttered, blushing furiously and refusing to look anyone in the eye.<br />
Emily just smiled a knowing smile at him without saying a thing.<br />
<br />
After finishing his meal, Jeff quietly excused himself and headed straight for his room, closing the door behind himself.<br />
He decided that he should really look into getting a lock.</p>
