<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Steve took a while to spell the sentence multiple times before and after he changed it. It wasn&#39;t only because he wanted to be sure that he won&#39;t get fooled again - he&#39;s already stuck on all fours - it was also due to his pregnancy-related brain fog.<br />
<br />
His body wasn&#39;t meant for feats of strength nor thought. It was meant for breeding, for being a slave. In truth he was a walking womb with the rest of the skunk attached. Especially now as he lied on his side in a small puddle of his own milk, not being able to stand up, not being able to even stand on four legs, as his overfull womb put too much strain on his back.<br />
<br />
He couldn&#39;t help himself by lifting it with his hands any more, since he didn&#39;t have those. He was a feral skunk, larger than a normal one - almost human sized - but still quadrupedal.<br />
<br />
He moaned softly as his unborn dragon fetus wiggled in his belly. He could feel it getting into birthing position - his snout pressing down on his cervix. He didn&#39;t have a lot of time till the birthing began.<br />
<br />
Steve repeated the sentence one last time:<br />
<br />
&quot;Steve thinks about the anthro rabbit he took&quot;<br />
<br />
He changed two things &quot;plushie&quot; to &quot;anthro&quot; and &quot;left&quot; to &quot;took&quot;. This should summon the druggie, then he could ask him for help.<br />
<br />
As he accepted the sentence suddenly the bedroom door opened - an anthro rabbit fell out of it hitting the floor with a thud.<br />
<br />
He immediately stood up inspecting himself and looking around panicked. Then he noticed Steve laying on the floor next to the computer desk.<br />
<br />
&quot;He got you too, eh?&quot; he asked looking at the female skunk on the floor.<br />
<br />
Steve&#39;s foggy brain took a while to comprehend what the guy was on about. In the meantime the anthro rabbit took a few steps closer, but then started gagging and immediately covered his nose with his paw.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh wow that guy did a number on you...&quot; he added.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please help me...&quot; Steve started, looking at him with pleading eyes. &quot;Take the phone, generate a sentence and turn me back by changing it...&quot; he pointed a paw towards the smartphone laying on the floor, the milk puddle slowly enveloping it.<br />
<br />
The rabbit came closer, still covering from the stench. He gave Steve a disgusted glance, clearly a stinking overly pregnant skunk laying in a puddle of its own milk deserved that. Steve was glad that at lest he faked a concerned smile afterwards.<br />
<br />
The rabbit took the phone and looked at it. &quot;So what now?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Press... ugh.... press the refresh button&quot; Steve managed to sputter as the dragon stretched his womb outwards with a sudden kick.<br />
<br />
&quot;Frank is looking at Steve as he&#39;s about to give birth&quot; the anthro rabbit read aloud.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, please change it so I&#39;m not pregnant&quot; Steve begged.<br />
<br />
The anthro rabbit looked at it for a while, dark miasma slowly gathering around him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... I see...&quot; he said finally. &quot;Nice to meet you Steve, I&#39;m Frank&quot; he said with a look of disgust on his face. &quot;I saw the last sentence, clearly you&#39;re Steve and this phone&#39;s main account is also Steve. Playing around with this shitty app didn&#39;t do you any favors, eh?&quot; Frank said calmly, although Steve could clearly feel the rage hidden behind his words.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please help me, I&#39;m sorry, so sorry....&quot; Steve tried to beg.<br />
<br />
&quot;It wasn&#39;t fun being stuck as an object, you know?&quot; Frank interrupted. &quot;Let&#39;s see now...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Steve is a pregnant skunk on the brink of giving birth&quot; Frank read aloud from the phone screen. &quot;What if we removed &#39;on the brink of&#39;?&quot; Frank looked down on the skunk.<br />
<br />
Steve was only able to grunt and eyed him pleadingly as fear completely overloaded his small skunk brain.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, you&#39;d die, no way you&#39;re getting... Whatever&#39;s inside you out through that little cunt of yours...&quot; Frank said calmly.<br />
<br />
Steve would sigh with relief hearing Frank change his mind, but only a groan escaped his lips as the dragon inside him hit squished his lungs suddenly. Steve doubled over in pain, trying unsuccessfully to calm the dragon with his useless paws and legs.<br />
<br />
Frank pressed the screen a few times in the meantime and suddenly the anthro rabbit turned into an anthro skunk.<br />
<br />
&quot;The fuck?!&quot; he shouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;What... what did you do?&quot; Steve gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;I changed &#39;Frank is bothered by the stench&#39; to &#39;Frank is not bothered by the stench&#39;. Sorry you... you kinda smell.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Duh...&quot; Steve threw in response.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why did it... &quot; Frank started, but then as he got a good look of his arms. &quot;Ah I see, skunks wouldn&#39;t be bothered...&quot; he finished.<br />
<br />
&quot;The app is cursed...&quot; Steve said between raspy breaths. &quot;It makes you do things, it fools you, twists your words against you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That I see... Let&#39;s see now...&quot; Frank pressed the screen a few times and suddenly started writing.<br />
<br />
Steve felt helpless but in his panicked state managed to roll onto his legs and slowly started to waddle towards the exit. He needed to escape, ten feet away and he&#39;d be safe from any change Frank would force upon him. He managed to take three excruciating steps before he suddenly felt a twisting sensation in his belly. Something weird happened, suddenly his womb became even heavier although it did not grow in any way. It was so heavy in fact that it pinned him in place as it not only touched the ground, but actually rested on it completely.<br />
<br />
Frank came closer and poked his taunt belly. Steve felt something slide inside and heard a muffled scraping sound.<br />
<br />
&quot;How many dragon eggs do you think you&#39;re having?&quot; he asked mockingly.<br />
<br />
Steve gasped as suddenly one of the eggs started sliding into position. Soon he felt its end pass his cervix and out of his cunt. He fell to his side trying to look down his body, but his belly completely hid anything below from his eyes.<br />
<br />
Frank approached his backside and gave the crowning egg an audible tap of his finger, making Steve wince in return as the other eggs rolled around inside him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Seems someone&#39;s gonna be a mommy for some dragon eggs soon!... Or maybe not...&quot; Frank said as he started typing something again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s add &#39;can&#39;t&#39; instead of &#39;about to&#39;&quot; he said out loud.<br />
<br />
The crowning egg slowly slid right back into Steve as he gasped and moaned. His cervix shut back just after the egg returned back into his expanded womb forcing the other ones into new resting places.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh wow, this is amazing when you&#39;re not on the receiving end, eh? Not so nice when you&#39;re a perpetually pregnant skunk slave though?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please...&quot; Steve moaned.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have a better idea what to make of you...&quot; Frank gave him a twisted smile.</p>
