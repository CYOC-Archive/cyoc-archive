<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Austin had to admit that even the warm shower water was already soothing enough for him as he rinsed himself off from the day&#39;s sweat accumulation. As he was reveling in the rinse off, he didn&#39;t notice the light sound of footsteps or the presence of another person until some gently tapped him on the shoulder. When he turned to look, he was met with a slender finger in the path of his head turn, unintentionally squishing his cheek into it while briefly seeing the cute, smiling face of Sakura... without any clothes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah! Did I walk into the wrong bath or...?&quot; he shouted, blushing as he went to try and cover himself up only for Sakura to softly hold his shoulders to calm him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, do not worry Austin-chan! It&#39;s a kon&#39;yoku, mixed bathing so you are perfectly fine here! I just came in to help wash you!&quot; Sakura said with a giggle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, that&#39;s alright Sakura, I don&#39;t really need--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay Austin-chan! Washing the back feels really sugoi amazing too!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...Well, okay. As long as you&#39;re okay with it Sakura,&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh arigato thank you Austin-chan!&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Sakura went to work washing his back, taking a wash cloth and soaking it with soap and adding a personal touch of pre with a giggle. Austin had to stifle a moan as she went to work on his back, melting into her touch as her fingers massaged his muscles while the rough cloth gently scrubbed away any grim and dead skin. Unbeknownst to him, the combination of traditionally made soap and Sakura&#39;s pre left his skin supple and smooth not unlike his own, devoid of any hair and blemishes.<br />
<br />
Austin was about to start washing himself as Sakura squeezed out the towel when she started working her hands into his hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, wha--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw, please Austin-chan? I can help you with your hair too! You look so tired you might shine die! Let me treat you to a sugoi cleaning!&quot;<br />
<br />
He couldn&#39;t really argue too much as she was already massaging shampoo scalp and hair, and he had to admit, it actually felt really good too.<br />
<br />
&quot;O-okay then Sakura...&quot; he said, trying not to think how cute she was as he failed to suppress his blush.<br />
<br />
Austin&#39;s mind soon relaxed as he let her do her work, delicately scrubbing and washing his hair. Like with his back, he was unaware of the changes going on with him, as she moved her hands from the roots of his hairs to their tips, causing them to grow longer and silkier with every stroke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhh, your hair is so soft and kawaii!&quot;<br />
<br />
Austin could only give a hazy mumble at her comment as she continued to wash his hair, pouring warm water to rinse out the suds as it flowed all the way down to his butt. He couldn&#39;t even object to her as she began massaging his face with gooey soap, still oblivious as she cleaned the rest of his head, her movements appearing as though she was molding his face as it shifted into more girly, slender proportions like her own.<br />
<br />
The relaxing feelings quickly shifted into that of pleasure as she moved her hands down to his neck, gentle presses making his neck less tight as his Adam&#39;s apple smoothed out. His broad shoulders and chest shrank as she rubbed her hands across his muscles, even making him giggle when she scrubbed her hands under his pits, letting out voice indistinguishable from a young girl&#39;s and the curly hairs in his armpits receding into nothingness.<br />
<br />
Going down to his abdomen, he could barely suppress a moan when she massaged his six pack, smoothing them out into a slender belly as she gently squeezed his waist thinner. The same could not be said when she got to his hips as they became wider with every rub, as well as her thighs becoming quite thicc. His moan could not be kept in as she kneaded his butt cheeks, causing them to inflate into a squishy bubble butt. He could have sworn that a finger occasionally slipped in between them a few times, but the pleasure was too much to notice anything else clearly.<br />
<br />
Sakura&#39;s hands made their way down his calves to his feet, eliminating any hairs just like the rest of his body, leaving him with completely supple hairless skin, save for his eyebrows, lashes, and hair of course. He could barely stifle any sign of pleasure physically now as he curled his toes with a moan as she worked her fingers in between them and massaging the soles of his feet, removing any manly wrinkles and calluses.<br />
<br />
Austin&#39;s pleasure senses shot through the roof when he felt her fingers fondles and massage his balls.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, Austin-chan! We&#39;re almost done!&quot; Sakura said sounding unfazed with her actions.<br />
<br />
His semi-erect penis was now at full mast as she washed his genitals. He wondered if she knew her washing method was more like pleasuring him as she rubbed body soap up and down his dick and practically juggled his balls with one hand, once again removing any pubic hairs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aaaand we&#39;re done! Wah~ You look so sugoi kawaii, Atsuko-chan!&quot; Sakura said.<br />
<br />
Austin briefly wondered who she was talking to, but the daze of pleasure was melting the two names together so he figured he just heard wrong.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s take a bath together, Atsuko-chan!&quot;</p>
