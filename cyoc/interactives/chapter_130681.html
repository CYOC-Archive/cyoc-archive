<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It took Derek a solid half a minute to understand what Lucas had said. Remember the changes? He was changing reality, he realized, so of course that changed his memory.<br />
<br />
&quot;God, I didn&#39;t even realize that&#39;s what was happening,&quot; Derek explained with a giggle. &quot;Man, it&#39;s like I&#39;m some dumb, slutty musclehead.&quot;<br />
<br />
As soon as the words left his lips, his weight seemed to explode. His muscles ballooned exponentially, not that Derek understood what that word meant anymore. His body lost a lot of body hair as his libido was greatly raised. His height shot up about another foot. His clothes tightened around his bulging muscles in all the right ways. His possessions changed into mostly workout gear and exercise equipment. His mannerisms became more rugged as his his need for cock increased dramatically. While Derek would solely bottom, now their fuck sessions became more balanced, with Derek and Lucas enjoying each other&#39;s cocks and asses. Not that Lucas complained; his boyfriend was practically one of only people who could keep up with him. If it wasn&#39;t for his love of manipulation, he&#39;d be completely sexually satisfied by Derek. Unfortunately, Derek previous statements still held true and any new commands simply reformed around their new reality.<br />
<br />
It was due to this that Lucas, who had a fetish for whatever Derek looked like, now loved muscular jocks. Even though he knew the ring caused this, he had always believed it was on account of his bisexuality that he wanted them. They were an incredible turn on for him, so naturally he&#39;d want Derek to be as much of a jock as he could be.<br />
<br />
That didn&#39;t change, however, that it was too dumb and dangerous for Derek to keep such a powerful item. He&#39;d just witnessed his desires change from slightly out of shape to ripped and buff and, while he didn&#39;t regret the change, he wasn&#39;t about to let Derek do it again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Babe, you trust me without question, right?&quot; Lucas asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, I trust you without question,&quot; Derek responded, realizing the statement&#39;s truth immediately.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then say that your tongue stud will be replaced by a normal one while your magical one will be given to me,&quot; Lucas ordered. He wanted Derek to keep a stud because it looked really hot, but the dumb hunk didn&#39;t need a magical one. Derek repeated the statement with Lucas&#39; help and they watched as the magic stud unclasped from Derek&#39;s tongue and pierced Lucas&#39; while a regular stud appeared on Derek&#39;s, filling Lucas with joy. He could do whatever he wanted to anyone, he thought with glee. The possibilities were endless.<br />
<br />
For starters, he was going to make Derek the perfect muscle slut. While he liked where Derek was, he knew it&#39;d be easier to change others if he desired something more generic, and since he&#39;d like whatever Derek was, the solution was simple.<br />
<br />
&quot;Derek, you&#39;re such a perfect and sexy muscular man. You&#39;ve got such great hair and eyes, and your body is amazing given how impressively buff your upper body and legs are. Your bubble butt of an ass and large cock compliment you perfectly since you&#39;re so good with your perfect asshole that feels better than the best, sopping wet pussy. And your cock so easily moves in an out of any asshole, it was as if it was always pre-lubed. It&#39;s not a surprise really that you can make any guy orgasm through anal stimulation and that you can just as easily reach orgasm in the same way. You&#39;re also the world&#39;s best, insatiable versatile hunk. Not to mention, I&#39;m so happy that you&#39;re a nudist like me and that you got that tattoo on the small of your back that says &#39;Master&#39;s cock sleeve&#39;. It&#39;s good to know that you know your place,&quot; Lucas explained with a smirk. Reality around Derek almost visibly warped due to the rapidity and magnitude of the changes Lucas was making. Derek&#39;s hair, once plain and badly cut morphed into a half curly, half wavy bedhead that always seemed perfect. The redhead&#39;s freckles only better complemented his rugged looks and ripped body. Every massive part about him developed a deep tan. The only things that seemed to look better the longer Lucas looked at them were Derek&#39;s long, thick cock and massive bubble ass. No one seemed to be able to understand why it was that Derek&#39;s ass and cock were so amazing. His ass was better than most girls, his cock was better than most guys, and that, along with his seduction skills, left most guys either questioning or sexually awakened in more ways than one when they looked at it for too long.<br />
<br />
Almost everyone who fucked the dumb hunk wanted more by the end and almost always had more gay experiences as a result of Derek. Ultimately, Lucas had to let Derek fuck other guys for three reasons: his own fetishes made both boys happy in their very open relationship, he couldn&#39;t keep up with how horny and insatiable his boyfriend was and he had to let his boyfriend fuck others as part of Derek&#39;s job. After all, with his looks and body, he was the best porn star in the world. He was like a prodigy, with his first video even doing well with straight men. He was the world&#39;s best versatile hunk and everyone knew it.<br />
<br />
It was a good thing then that he was incredibly submissive and loved Lucas immensely. As his tattoo said, he was always there for his master to use and he loved it. He now never wore clothes either but nowadays that was mainly to please Lucas. He had be constantly ready for his boyfriend and due to his libido all he had to do to make that happen was to be naked at all times.<br />
<br />
The changes settled as Derek nestled himself perfectly in his boyfriend&#39;s arms, which was impressive given how wide his shoulders had become. They were positioned in such a way that with just a little movement, Lucas could easily enter his horny slut. Given how easy it was, of course he did.<br />
<br />
Good God, Lucas thought as he started fucking his boyfriend&#39;s amazing manpussy – boypussy seemed to dainty for such a hot hunk like Derek – and listened to his Derek&#39;s loud, deep, slutty moans. Could this get any better?</p>
