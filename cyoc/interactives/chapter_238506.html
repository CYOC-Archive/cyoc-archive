<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The air in the room felt intense as Sylvia and Mary was celebrating. Sylvia coughed too many times to be used for smoking while Mary was content with only one cigarette. Jennifer noticed that the house was only one floor high as the second floor was missing. The whole house didn&#39;t look like a home at all but a shelter where they all lived. There were no-one living there besides them and as Jennifer peeked from the window she saw that they were living somewhere quiet. She couldn&#39;t see any big supermarket in the distance but two or three mom and pop shops that filled the little town.<br />
<br />
Sylvia was already serving them dinner as she was handed a can of peasoup with a spoon, no, it was a little spoon made out of plastic playing card. She lukewarm peasoup felt heavenly as Jennifer&#39;s eyes begun to tear. Sylvia and Mary patted Jennfier&#39;s head as Sylvia gave her a big hug while pushing her big breasts on her face. Her mother wiped the tears of joy on them as Jennifer munched the whole thing saying how tasty it was.<br />
<br />
While Jennifer was eating the tasty peasoup she took a closer look at her parents. Sylvia only wore a very tight maybe one size too small tank top that made her nipples poke out. She also had a very flea-market-esc skirt that barely hide her bottom and revealed to Jennifer that she wasn&#39;t wearing any kind of underpants. Her grandma Mary looked pretty much the same as she also had a tank top but it seemed to fit her more but the skirt she had was so short that even miniskirt would have blushed as it made one fourth of her bottocks to show. At least Mary wore some sort pasties to cover her nipples and a black thong that did it&#39;s job. Both of them wore so little clothing that they could have been wearing nothing at all. Especially her mother as the clothes didn&#39;t fit her at all.<br />
<br />
After some time had passed and the whole famiyl had finished eating. Sylvia asked Mary to come to the master bedroom as she had a surprise for her which was also meant for Jennifer. Sylvia also said that as it was surprise Jennifer wasn&#39;t allowed to see what it was before tomorrow. It also meant that Jennifer had free time to look at every corner of the house where they were living currently as she placed the peasoup can on to the kitchen table.<br />
<br />
First was the room where she came from and saw it that it was locked with a slide from outside. Making it sure that only her mother and grandma could open it. Maybe this was a special occasion as they seemed to be very happy about something. Jennifer having no clue. As Jennifer slided her room door open she noticed that it was a big supply closet that only had Jennifer&#39;s mattress on the middle of the room. All her belonging were on the shelves as a single lightbulb was hanging from the ceiling. Thankfully the lightswitch was on her side of the door. In the distance she saw a brown wooden bucket that looked empty. Jennifer wondered what was is used for but quickly continued inspecting her room.<br />
<br />
Thankfully all the trash it had was the white-yellow bed sheet and the planket she had. On the small corner Jennifer saw a drawing that someone must have made with a marker. It looked like a stick figure of a angry person while holding someone&#39;s arm. Jennifer didn&#39;t understand what it meant but walked back outside to see other rooms, like the kitchen and the small living room.<br />
<br />
The master bedroom on the opposide side of the house looked indimidating. Lot&#39;s of a dents, weird looking chipped piece and the door that had lot&#39;s of pretty lights. Underneath the door a blue-green-red rainbow color shot itself on to the floor making it pretty looking. Jennifer thought about touching the door but heard her mother and grandma talking on the other side.<br />
<br />
The kitchen was still, a kitchen, nothing weird of it beside the some trashbags it had while the living room looked clean as it also had the front door with the white benches. The TV looked something out of internet. Like something from two centuries ago. A bulky electronic piece of junk that showed satelite TV.<br />
<br />
As she was ready her mother and grandma joined with her to watch TV and kept smiling at her as if they knew something going to happen soon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom. Can we just show her &#39;the gift&#39; ?&quot; Sylvia said while she couldn&#39;t contain her happiness.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gift?&quot; Jennifer asked as Mary bursted in laughter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay. Let her have it.&quot; Mary said while Jennifer turned her head to her mother who was presenting her with a sloshing can of some liquid.<br />
<br />
It was BEER!?<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom!? How did you-&quot; Jennifer asked as she stared at it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know! It&#39;s meant for your surprise party but I just wanted to show you how premium we stole this time.&quot; Sylvia said while yoinking back the beer can back her own lap. &quot;Like. Somehow I got six of them and no-one noticed!&quot;<br />
<br />
Sylvia was clapping her hands as Mary begun to explain what was going to happen, &quot;Tomorrow you&#39;ll have your &#39;graduation&#39; day as I&#39;m pretty sure that you are old enough to continue our legacy. I&#39;ve been keeping close eye on your height.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Le-legacy? You mean...?&quot; Jennifer trembled as Mary just patted her head and continue watching the TV.<br />
<br />
Jennifer let out a quiet, oh fuck, out of her mouth as she couldn&#39;t believe what she just heard. The sun had already set and the TV displayed the time being three hours before the midnight. Mary turned the TV to a different channel while Sylvia was humming and singing how it was big day tomorrow. The situation wasn&#39;t looking great at all. Both of her guardians were mentally ill or even worse sociopaths who didn&#39;t know right from wrong. Jennifer had to make a decision now if she wanted to go through with her life this or go an inch backwards and hope for the best. Both options not looking good for her.</p>
