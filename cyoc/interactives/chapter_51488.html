<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the goddesses were deciding what to do Astara looked at the next world she wanted to conquer. &quot;Well it seems like this world of women is ripe for the taking,&quot; Astara said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know if it's such a good idea taking that world,&quot; Dana said.<br />
<br />
&quot;From all reports they're very peaceful which will make converting them easy,&quot; Astara said with a wicked grin. &quot;They won't be fighting back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I still feel uneasy about it,&quot; Dana said.<br />
<br />
Astara looked at the first demon she had created after she was summoned. She still had some qualms about converting others but those qualms grew less everyday and with each world they converted. She had never come out and said that she had felt uneasy about converting a world before. Astara sat in silence for a few minutes. Finally she asked, &quot;What makes you uneasy about it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know,&quot; Dana admitted. &quot;Maybe it's too easy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Astara had to think that over. What Dana had said made sense. &quot;What do you propose we do then?&quot; she asked pinning Dana with a hard stare.<br />
<br />
&quot;We could send Ninjatta to find out what defenses they have,&quot; Dana said. &quot;If they have hidden defenses she'll find them. She has yet to fail.&quot;<br />
<br />
Astara nodded her agreement. She had barely converted one world because of their hidden defenses and so had created Ninjatta. That world hadn't looked soft though while this one did but looks could be deceiving. Ninjatta knew how to do her job and she knew to eliminate any that saw her.<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
In another city on the goddesses world Rachael Donner was nursing her youngest child. She was in heaven as far as she was concerned. She was very thankful that the change had occurred to give her the body she always knew she should have had. She smiled down at Melissa who was almost done. Suddenly she felt something and her smile turned into a frown.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey honey,&quot; Allison said as she came in. &quot;Where's Jessica?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;At Patty's,&quot; Rachael said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's wrong?&quot; Allison asked hearing the tone in Rachael's voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have that feeling again,&quot; Rachael said. &quot;It's stronger this time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Seeing that Melissa was done Allison took her and watched Rachael get up and go to her room. Allison followed looking worried. The past few times Rachael had felt like this she would automatically go to the room she had set aside for a couple of things from her male life that hadn't vanished during the change. It was during these times that Allison was reminded of how moody Rachael had been as Rick. &quot;It's probably nothing like it was the last few times,&quot; Allison said trying to take Rachael's mind off what she was feeling.<br />
<br />
&quot;You remember the day of the change,&quot; Rachael said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't forget it,&quot; Allison said. &quot;You had really scared me when in the school you just blurted out the change was coming. In answer to my question you just repeated the change was coming and then started counting down. The change wave hit just as you finished and you were thrown down to the floor.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And this ring fell off my finger,&quot; Rachael said holding the ring up. It had a moonstone in it and engravings of the seven planets known to the people a long time ago. It had fit Rick's finger but it didn't fit Rachael’s. This was odd since Rick's class ring had changed and stayed on Rachael's finger. &quot;You know that I had the feeling that something was going to happen that day,&quot; she continued. &quot;And when the change wave was coming that feeling had become really strong. Strong like this feeling is getting. Something is about to happen and I don't like it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure it's nothing,&quot; Allison said in a soothing voice. She had to take Rachael's mind off of it or else her worry would sour her milk. &quot;Maybe you're just a bit jealous of how big former men's breasts are compared to your's&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachael smiled and said, &quot;I'm happy with the size of my breasts.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you're only a c where the others are at least triple d sized,&quot; Allison said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm happy with my breasts,&quot; Rachael stated again kissing Allison. After breaking the kiss she continued, &quot;I know I'm not normal but normal is boring.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I can't argue with that,&quot; Allison said. &quot;Have you been able to get your locket open today?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachael sighed and said, &quot;No. Five years and I still can't get it open.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure you'll get it open someday,&quot; Allison said. &quot;You're only twenty-three after all. How did you like your party yesterday?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachael giggled shaking her head. &quot;I told you that I loved it,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's nice that your birthday is on change day,&quot; Allison said reaching out and squeezing one of Rachael's breasts. &quot;It gives me an excuse to go all out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I really liked you being covered in strawberry pudding,&quot; Rachael said nibbling on Allison's ear. &quot;You were so naughty.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So were you taking your time eating it off of me,&quot; Allison said smiling. &quot;You knew what it would do to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You enjoyed it,&quot; Rachael said reaching down to Allison's pussy. &quot;Just like you're enjoying this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We should put Melissa down for her nap before we go much farther,&quot; Allison said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can wait a few extra minutes,&quot; Rachael said. &quot;But once she's down for her nap you're all mine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wouldn't want it any other way,&quot; Allison said with a mischievous smile.<br />
<br />
As Allison turned to put Melissa down for a nap she heard something that made her blood run cold. It was Rachael counting down in the same flat, mysterious tone she had used when she counted down the seconds remaining until the change wave hit them. She had said she hadn't liked the feeling she was getting. Was the change going to be undone? Was Allison going to lose Rachael?<br />
<br />
As Rachael finished counting down a swirling vortex of energy appeared in front of them. Out of this vortex stepped a creature that Allison could only describe as a demon. It was clearly female. It's skin was pebbly and green. It had four arms. It's eyes were a blazing red. It had a snout like a lizard that was open to show three rows of sharp teeth. It had claws on it's fingers and feet which looked like they could rip through steel. It's tail looked like it could be used as a whip and it had four claws on the end. A closer look revealed that there was actually a hand at the end of the tail. The vortex vanished and the demon shot her tongue out wrapping it around Melissa. &quot;NO,&quot; Allison screamed knowing that the demon was about to devour Melissa.<br />
<br />
Before the demon could reel in her catch a sword sliced through her tongue. The demon screamed while Melissa wailed. &quot;Get behind me,&quot; Rachael said in a tone that said she wasn't going to argue.<br />
<br />
Allison wasn't about to argue any point. Rachael was standing there with the sword looking scary. Of course the demon was looking scary too but Rachael was staring at it not showing any fear. Part of the demon's tongue was still wrapped around Melissa and Allison started unwrapping it as Rachael swung the sword at the demon. She quickly found out why Melissa was crying. Whatever was on the tongue burned. By the time Allison got the tongue off there were red blistering welts where the tongue was. Allison looked up to see the fight between Rachael and the demon. The demon had seemed to have grown swords from her arms and was swinging them at Rachael. Rachael was able to block some blows and barely dodge others though she had several cuts. She always stayed between the demon and them though. The demon had some cuts too and when it whipped it's tail around Rachael was able to slice the end off. The ferocity with which the two fought was unreal. During this Allison noticed that the fake gems in the sword's hilt were glowing. She had to wonder what that meant and if it was the sword fighting or Rachael. The fight seemed to take hours but in reality only lasted a few minutes and those were the longest few minutes of Allison's life. She didn't know what damage the demon's tongue had done or if it was still burning. She didn't know if Rachael would survive or not. If the demon killed Rachael then it would come after them next and there would be no escape since the room didn't have a window. She had to get Melissa to a hospital. Finally the demon scored a hit and Rachael went down. It looked like Rachael was a goner but she thrust the sword up and through what was hopefully the demon's heart as it was getting ready to deliver a killing blow. The demon had a look of shock on it's face as it staggered back and Rachael pulled the sword from it's body. With a look of utter contempt Rachael swung the sword a final time and decapitated the demon.<br />
<br />
Allison was too stunned to move for a few moments as Rachael slumped down on the ground and the sword fell from her grasp. &quot;You don't like fighting,&quot; Allison finally said. &quot;Even at school you wouldn't get into fights when others would pick on you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was about to eat Melissa,&quot; Rachael said slowly and with a grimace on her face. &quot;There are times to fight and one of those times is when those you love are in danger. I was not going to sit back and let that demon eat Melissa and then you and me. I had to stop it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I need to call nine one one,&quot; Allison said. &quot;We need medical attention. You and Melissa especially.&quot; Just then Melissa quieted down and Allison couldn't feel the burning anymore.<br />
<br />
Looking down Allison saw the demon's body shrinking. It's skin smoothed out and turned the color of human skin. It's breasts shrank down until it was left with a flat chest. It's tail shrank back up into it's spine. The claws became finger and toe nails. The end of the tail that had been cut off faded out of existence as did the tongue. It's head grew brown hair and the teeth fell out. It's muzzle flattened into a human face. As soon as the demon had finished transforming Allison gasped and had to put her hand over her mouth. She could see the look of utter horror on Rachael's face as she stared at what the demon had become. There were no words to describe what each of them were feeling and definitely no words to describe how Rachael was feeling or what she was thinking. For there on the floor where a demon once laid dead was Jessica's nude form, her head cut off by her mother.<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;NO!&quot; Astara's scream echoed through her palace sending various demons scurrying to find a hiding place. &quot;Ninjatta is gone. The one who did it will suffer greatly.&quot;</p>
