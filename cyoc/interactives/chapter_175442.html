<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mavis had not gone unscathed meanwhile. While her family members were turning, the young woman had already started feeling the same warmth between her legs, but she was doing a good job of ignoring it. While the changes are greatly accelerated by giving into the lust, they still occur if ignored, especially the beginning stages.<br />
Leaning over her books, she crossed and uncrossed her legs, as she not only was felling horny she was also itching all over that area as scales were not compatible with tight cotton panties and yoga pants. Had she not being so stressed with her finals, she might have done something about it, but for now she was being held back by it, but it would not take long for her damn to break.<br />
Meredith had finally impaled herself on the full length of Miles&#39; shaft. His transformation progressed quickly, pushed by the effects of the saliva and pheromones. He didn&#39;t resist when his mother started moving, slamming her whole weight onto his lap with increasing force. More and more of her fluids coated his member and surrounding area, driving his lust even more. His passivity didn&#39;t last long, as he soon grabbed the woman&#39;s hips, trying to guide her to increase her speed, which she gladly did after leaning over him, bringing her snout in touching distance to his face.<br />
Her eyes, once scary now looked beautiful. Like two emerald, burning with desire. His hands grabbed at her ass, now scale to scales. Meredith whispered sweet words in his eyes, which would disappear soon. She asked for his seed, told him of all the eggs she would lay with his offspring. He closed his brown eyes, then opened his new yellow ones as their tongues danced together.<br />
&quot;Hey guys I&#39;m making coffee, do you want some?&quot;<br />
Meredith Froze. The sound was coming from the kitchen, where Mavis was now trying to use caffeine to keep focused. She let go of her weight for one last time, just as Miles finished transforming and release his seed inside her, driving her own orgasm.<br />
&quot;Mom? Miles?&quot;<br />
Meredith responded, trying her best to sound normal. She didn&#39;t want Mavis to run away if she saw them. She motioned to Miles to be silent while both sneaked to the door between the kitchen and the kitchen. Mavis was moving like she needed to pee badly, and a small protuberance was poking against her pants above her ass. Meredith asked her not to come to the living room claiming she broke a glass cup and was still trying to clean the area. Her daughter was still in a zombie mode, and taking advantage of that, the lizard woman sneaked behind the counter, where her cup was sitting while she looked for sugar. A small drop of saliva would do.<br />
Who knew one person could be this tired? And horny. A big part of Mavis wanted to lock herself in her room and bring out her dildo, but she would be useless for at least an hour if she did that. She sipped her black concoction, an old friend who had saved her many times. She then set the cup down, looked out the window.<br />
&quot;OH GOD!!!&quot;<br />
She exploded! The orgasm came out of no where, but it was strong. She jumped out of the chair and instinctively moved her hands to her pussy as if she felt pain, but once they were so close she couldn&#39;t help but to shove them inside her pants, and then her pussy. She keeled and with tears of pleasure in her eyes started to finger herself. While she was incapacitated, both lizards moved in on their prey, ripping away at her clothes to expose her transforming body. She didn&#39;t know who these strange creatures were, but at that moment she didn&#39;t care. The male shoved his cock near the horny woman, who didn&#39;t resist much before sting to suck on it. The female restrained Mavis&#39; hands, and started using her longer and skilled tongue pleasure her.<br />
The efforts of both lizards spread her transformations faster than either had experienced it before. In the effort to pleasure the male, her face elongated way before the scales reached her head, creating a second set of scales that spread from her mouth to everywhere else. She showered some distress when chunks of hair started falling out of her head, and she finally figured who those creatures where from their moans, but that distress passed in seconds as she started feeling more comfortable in her new body.<br />
When she was almost done, both mother and son too a step back, frustrating her, who was close to another orgasm. <br />
&quot;Do you know who we are?&quot; Said Meredith in a playful tone of voice. Mavis responded that she did, and begged them to help her finish her transformation. Miles picked his sister off the ground and put her on her feet. &quot;Sis, I need to fertilize you eggs too. And mom needs some attention too, don&#39;t be selfish&quot;. The idea made complete sense to her, she looked at Meredith, on her back spreading her legs. She quickly caught on and got on her hands and knees before lifting her tail and shoving her snout in her the older woman&#39;s pussy.<br />
Later that day, both Mavis and Meredith were researching on the internet the best materials to make a nest. Instincts alone could only take them so far on a formerly human world, their higher intellect was an import tool still. They had time, the eggs would take several days to be ready, and Miles was hard at work, fertilizing them. Several families in the neighborhood found themselves in this weird, where the taboos of old were now a norm. Their family had been the most boring out of many in fact, the Miles was still a male and both Meredith and Mavis were still female. Some houses had their gender reshuffled severely, man and woman turning into male, females or she-males, seemingly at random. Her friend Kate, now a golden retriever filled her in on everything that had happened with the Smith family and how they were the catalysts of this change. Everyone seemed happy with their new form, no matter what it was however, as was Meredith. The two friends even had some inter-species fun after the explanation. Despite being from different species, both found each other&#39;s form extremely attractive, same for all neighbors.</p>
