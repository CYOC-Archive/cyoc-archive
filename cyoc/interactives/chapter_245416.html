<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Remington Albers smiled as he could see Sophie and Roland sitting on chairs that had been part of the old Albers home in Lyre, the home they&#39;d lived in before he and Vera became Mamenchisaurus Dinotopians and needed larger furniture. He liked the cases where his daughter and son-in-law picked things that had come from him and Vera over Tyler and Persephone Luwrie, but he also wasn&#39;t going to get into any sort of open rivalry with the only other Sauropod Dinotopians in Animalia. And especially not on father&#39;s day with Sophie and Roland calling to wish them a &quot;happy father&#39;s day&quot; together, mirroring what they&#39;d done for Vera and Persephone on Mother&#39;s day. The biggest real difference was that because they didn&#39;t have the computer that SMU provided, Sophie and Roland were likely using one of their phones for the call, and set to run through Zoom/Skype. It let Remington and Tyler see Sophie and Roland, but they likely wouldn&#39;t be able to see them, which left it as something more of a group chat. Though, from what the phone&#39;s camera showed, it looked as though Sophie and Roland had done a good job with setting up their apartment in Dino City.<br />
<br />
&quot;Things are looking good there, you two,&quot; Remington said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks dad,&quot; Sophie replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was probably because of our big blue helpers,&quot; Roland turned his head a bit so that Remington and Tyler could see him wink. Animalian physiology did allow for the large forward facing Human-like eyes with regard to the focus and orientation, but for both Roland and Sophie, they couldn&#39;t change where the cartilage crests were on their heads.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your mother and I were happy to help,&quot; Tyler answered, &quot;and there had been a lot of back and forth... and the drive by to Lyre/Animalia was lonely...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can imagine,&quot; Roland admitted.<br />
<br />
&quot;While we&#39;re on the subject of things going on while Roland I were moving...&quot; Sophie commented with a curious look in her eyes, &quot;how did you and mom make out with the assignment Horizon gave you with the herm Mamenchisaurus... Ko... Koj...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Koji Tomoshita,&quot; Remington spoke helping Sophie with the more Japanese name. <br />
<br />
Jen may have had an Anglicized name, but from what Remington knew, it was entirely possible that Jen might have just been a shortened form of a Japanese name that would sound more &quot;American&quot; when shortened. It was also possible that her family had been in America long enough that they gave her an &quot;American&quot; name rather than a Japanese one. Remington had never asked, as that wasn&#39;t his business. And while Koji had a working understanding of English, Jen was able to help with some of the signs on Ishinowa Island. That made Jen and Andrew&#39;s help pretty big. He then paused to look to Vera, who was seated to a side with Persephone with her and gave a small smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;And your mother and I made out very well, though I&#39;m not sure why you wanted to know,&quot; Remington then spoke and then raised a hand with three fingers raised. He then lowered them into a fist, and as the last one lowered, Sophie answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad! Not like that!&quot; That earned some laughter that Tyler, Vera, and Persephone joined in, though Remington did turn to a more serious answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;As for the help with Koji... that was a good adventure worth telling,&quot; Remington commented and then began the tale...<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The sun shone brightly as Remington and Vera made their way through the terminal on Heiya Island. They&#39;d been a bit puzzled as to why they came to Heiya Island when Koji was living on Ishinowa Island, but they supposed that maybe the new island didn&#39;t have direct air service yet. As from what had been reported, while connection of Animalian colony islands that were part of Japan were fast becoming their own Japanese prefecture, some of them were knew enough that full flight service wouldn&#39;t be easy. They were met by Andrew and Jen just as they came out from the baggage claim area.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry if we kept you two waiting,&quot; Vera managed with a small yawn, &quot;I can&#39;t believe I feel so tired in such sun...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, there is a fairly decent time zone difference between Japan and even the US west coast,&quot; Jen told them, &quot;and Nevada is in that specific time zone...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... and while the plane was comfortable, I wasn&#39;t able to sleep all that well,&quot; Vera admitted, &quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be up for much in the short term...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; Andrew assured her, &quot;a lot of these tests are pretty standard, and between you two and Koji, it&#39;s going to be a bit of a comparison between of you and hir. It&#39;s a means to help provide for what can be expected from Animalians of all kinds. And these comparisons have been done across the board with regard to the herms against the single gendered individuals... and would work with some of the sorts of studies and research they did with me to see on what sort of potential stresses that would come with assuming such... gargantuan size.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Most of the testing will be done once everyone is better adapted to the present time zone,&quot; Jen added, &quot;particularly when we have a bit of a ferry ride to Ishinowa Island.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They have ferries?&quot; Remington asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;And ones big enough for us,&quot; Andrew nodded, &quot;though... we&#39;d best keep going. They have their own travel timetables to keep. Jen and I can update you on some more things as we go.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That might help keep us awake from a long flight,&quot; Remington commented as they walked along and came out, &quot;you said a lot of this mirrors things that they did with you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, for strength and size measurements that Horizon and Rex felt could be used for extrapolating data on the mundane animals when making the comparison between Dinosaur and Dinotopian,&quot; Andrew nodded, &quot;and normally Rex would be here for this, as it would fit with a lot of his present work with non-Avian Dinosaurs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When we got the call, it sounded like he had something else going on,&quot; Vera commented.<br />
<br />
Jen and Andrew both chuckled, &quot;Yes. They&#39;ve recently had some scientists publish reports on some Tyrannosaur bones found in New Mexico being similar enough to Tyrannosaurus to be part of that genus but yet distinct enough to be its own species, Tyrannosaurus Mcraeensis. And because of some points that would sound as being distinct, the facility that has the fossils has been willing to cooperate with some requests that Rex as has made to get his own examination of the bones that the reports used. It went through his employers with the state park... And while they won&#39;t move the bones, they will grant Rex access to looking over the bones and make his notes on whether or not the researchers missed something... so, he&#39;s been all shades of excited.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess I would to if something new came up with regard research in my field,&quot; Remington commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;And is why we&#39;re along,&quot; Jen commented, &quot;not only is the work similar to what Andrew and I have gone through for understanding measurements, strength tests, speed trials and so on, but to also help with any translation issues you may need, as I take it your Japanese isn&#39;t good?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nonexistent,&quot; Remington answered, &quot;but Koji actually seemed quite capable of speaking English when we talked on the phone through Skype or Zoom... whatever they&#39;re calling it these days.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s good,&quot; Jen commented, &quot;though... some things with signs may still pose an an issue. Ishinowa Island is new enough that they may only have signs in Japanese at the moment.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vera and Remington both nodded to that. From there it wasn&#39;t long until they came up on the coast of Heiya Island the improvised harbor on its north shore. And there was a ferry waiting for them.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;So... you had a boat ride from Heiya Island to Ishinowa Island,&quot; Roland said slowly, &quot;how did that go?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll admit to being a bit seasick, making me look greener than I already do,&quot; Remington admitted.<br />
<br />
&quot;You weren&#39;t the only one,&quot; Vera agreed with him.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, needless to say, if the jet-lag didn&#39;t mean we couldn&#39;t go with the tests on that day,&quot; Remington finished, &quot;the sea sickness would. Thankfully, Koji did understand when we arrived on Ishinowa Island. We got a room in the inn just rested through the rest of the day and through the night. It was the next day that we actually began doing a lot of the measurements and tests.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Remington and Vera were actually pleased to find that while Ishinowa Island wasn&#39;t quite as built up as Heiya Island was, it did have some construction that had some things functional. Most of the homes and residences on the island look like up-sized versions of various Japanese dwellings that predated much of what was known about Japanese architecture, particularly outside Japan, began to be built. In this, the Dinotopian colony sort of have had the same sort of &quot;prehistoric&quot; feel for architecture, but wasn&#39;t going off of the sort of stylized neolithic type structures that Dino City had. In some ways, it made some of the facilities on Ishinowa Island feel a bit more real while Dino City at times looked like it had been inspired by cartoons about the stone age made in the fifties. <br />
<br />
The stadium that they were in was also set up a bit different. Unlike the Claw Coliseum or the Dino Dome, which had their main &quot;stadium&quot; look like it was fit for sports like basketball, the one on Ishinowa Island actually had almost outdoor setting, with a grass field that looked like it was set up for soccer and with a track around its outer edge.  The roof looked lie it was largely class or a clear plastic that would allow for light to come through. Things like the gym, pool, and changing rooms were built into areas that then came outside of all this. It was an aura that left both Remington and Vera in awe, and grateful to being able to do this while not being seasick.<br />
<br />
&quot;You two feeling better after yesterday?&quot; came Koji&#39;s voice from behind them. It was a bit deeper from where it had been when they first talked on the phone before Koji&#39;s conversion, and learning about Koji seeing herself as male at the time and converting after putting on too much weight as a result of having the perception of being rejected by her parents at the time. Though, Remington knew that also came with Koji now being a shi and a hermaphrodite Dinotopian.<br />
<br />
They turned to find Koji standing there in a pair of dark blue shorts with a light blue tank top. The tank top hung a bit loosely over Koji&#39;s chest and covered the sports bra shi was wearing. The front of the tank top had a whale&#39;s tail emerging from the water. In some ways, it was fairly similar to his own outfit, though his tank top was a plain white shirt with no decal or insignia on it. He also had it made as it was to also stand a part from Vera. Vera was wearing a pair of light yellow short-shorts, a faded blue tank top that had just a low enough neckline to let Remington note the light gray sports bra his wife was wearing. It was sturdy enough that he hoped that this test wouldn&#39;t have anything like what happened in the Year of the Rabbit competition. It was something that would likely help them stand out from each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;A lot better, thank you,&quot; Vera answered, &quot;and you look a lot better now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Koji gave a polite smile while glancing to Andrew and Jen who stood nearby.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anything from your folks?&quot; Vera asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think they fully understand it... but they ultimately proved a lot more supportive than I thought they would be,&quot; Koji admitted, &quot;so... there is some hope for some things.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good to hear,&quot; Remington commented, &quot;you&#39;ve met Jen and Andrew?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Known more by reputation than anything else,&quot; Koji commented, &quot;the first Sauropod Dinotopians... but yes. Though, I&#39;d suspect that some stretches will be required before any of the comparisons are done.&quot;<br />
<br />
Remington nodded, &quot;and in all directions for legs, shoulders, arms, back. As I believe from what were told by Rex and Jeremy over the phone that they&#39;re looking at how fast a pace we can manage. How well can we maintain a certain pace, so there will be some running involved.&quot;<br />
<br />
A lot of the testing reminded him of stories he&#39;d heard from Sophie that had related to things that her Animalia Ambassadoria team helped with in Animalia&#39;s first four years, in which Simon Truman, and his mother, Sandy, had helped serve as the control group for the comparison between them and the first hermaphrodite Wolf Animalians, Lunette, Night Runner, Paula, Dusky, and Chelsea.<br />
<br />
&quot;There will also be some strength testing to see on how much you can lift, bench, and squat,&quot; Andrew answered, &quot;and that&#39;s all to provide the proverbial measure on what you can do and so that Horizon my also have data they can also publish to help anyone else who wants to become a Mamenchisaurus some expectation of what they can do.&quot;<br />
<br />
There were some nods as Remington began working on a series of stretches, many of which went back to things he did while in school and playing football and basketball back then. He barely noticed that Vera and Koji essentially followed his lead with regard to the stretches. He would have figured that Koji might not have known, given the condition &quot;she&quot; had been in before hir conversion, but he would have thought that Vera had been in some girls&#39; sports back when she went through high school. Of course, maybe some that had been more casual. But, Remington was still content to lead the stretches while Andrew and Jen overlooked things.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is there any particular order to which all of this is to go?&quot; Koji wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really,&quot; Andrew answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then, can we go with the running events first?&quot; Koji wondered, &quot;I mean... I&#39;m sure none of us are fast, but I know I&#39;m faster now than where I was before my conversion.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew and Jen nodded and they moved from the spot where they were standing. Andrew to the notepad and stopwatches and went down the straightaway on the track while Jen moved to the start of a curve on the inside part of the track.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll go with the male races first,&quot; Jen spoke and motioned for Remington and Koji to align with her right hip, &quot;I will count to three, and when I say three, you run to where Andrew is.&quot;<br />
<br />
Remington and Koji both nodded and tried to assume a basic runner&#39;s stance. They both nodded again when ready, letting Jen know to start the countdown. Remington assumed that this would akin to some of the standard sort of sprint races, like the 100 yard dash or whatever the metric equivalent would be. They then heard the countdown and went when Jen said three. The race went quicker than what Remington expected from both himself and from Koji. To a certain extent, it was also where he actually felt faster, which he had as a surprise. He knew that Sauropods weren&#39;t going to be great sprinters. Their great weight and height would mean a high speed run would be impossible, and that Sauropod Dinotopians would only be helped so much by some of the benefits of hybrid posture that any Animalian could have. As they passed Andrew, the Brachiosaurus Dinotopian pressed a button on the stop watches he had.<br />
<br />
&quot;That felt great!&quot; Koji said to Andrew while panting a little and noting some water bottles that had been left in the grass by where Andrew was standing. &quot;I&#39;ve never pushed myself that much... and I&#39;m glad the sports bra that&#39;s been made could handle things... and more glad that what they support shrank by a lot in my conversion, at least so far as proportion goes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s all pretty good,&quot; Andrew commented, &quot;Remington, you were actually a bit behind my time for this event and about a second and a half ahead of Koji.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wouldn&#39;t that fit within some of the ranges that would be expected between racers of the same gender?&quot; Remington asked, &quot;wouldn&#39;t there be some bigger difference because some of the tradeoffs that would come from Koji being a herm?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It could fit,&quot; Andrew shrugged, &quot;from what Jeremy and Rex have both mentioned, there wouldn&#39;t actually be too much of a difference in certain areas. Koji looks to have a shorter stride than you, and that likely helped you &quot;win&quot; the race, but shi was also able to move her legs faster and thus more strides in the same amount of time... Which could be a benefit of hir being a bit smaller than you. And as said before, a lot of this is to give Horizon data that can be used for more precise expectations.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So... that would be good for Koji, help hir gain confidence in these things?&quot; Remington asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose,&quot; Andrew managed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Koji said to him, &quot;the form... and actually having the male equipment is more what I take confidence from. I would have looked to do more to be male... but some of the scans found that there is some muscle tissue that runs into my... chest... and the doctors worry that removing my breasts would, well, cut those muscles and open up a bleeding risk they don&#39;t want to take.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... that&#39;s part of why Horizon thinks that female Animalians retain very firm chests, despite their size,&quot; Andrew commented, &quot;there is added muscle support that goes beyond what would normally be there in a Human.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;So it was all races that you won?&quot; Sophie asked to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was an element to it,&quot; Remington managed, &quot;and I actually did better with the endurance race. Of course, that&#39;d also be something I&#39;m better trained for these days. I may have been an okay athlete in high school, but certain responsibilities and activities got hectic when in college, and the competition there was tougher than I was. Working with stocking and scheduling and team management at the lumber yard has a fair amount of that sort of walking exercise...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And some anerobic exercise as well,&quot; Roland commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe after I became a Dinotopian,&quot; Remington chuckled, &quot;before then... we actually had a crane for a lot of that work. But with my youth restored, I was happy to help, even if a lot of that also goes a bit below where my position at the shop is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How&#39;d mom do?&quot; With the races?&quot; Sophie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty good,&quot; Remington smiled, &quot;Koji largely won those races, but they were relatively evenly matched there. Something that I guess would be cases where within a species, there wouldn&#39;t be too much difference between individuals... and she looked very good in her shorts.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad,&quot; Sophie groaned. She could accept her parents being active and into things like sex. But she didn&#39;t brag about the things Roland could do in bed and she didn&#39;t want a play by play of the things her parents did in bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;The real surprise came with the weight lifting session,&quot; Remington continued, &quot;and particularly the squats.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That surprised me too,&quot; Vera spoke up, &quot;are you sure you want to admit this on father&#39;s day?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s been about a week or so since all of this,&quot; Remington answered, &quot;I&#39;m sure that Sophie and Roland might have heard something about it by now... Either from Heather or Jeremy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;ve actually talked more on Rex&#39;s paper,&quot; Sophie commented, &quot;and much of it seems to be more a point that while the points raised on Tyrannosaurus Mcraeensis carry some validity as a separate species from Tyrannosaurus Rex. The only thing that Rex adds that might be on the more controversial side of things apparently relates to some debate on things that were published after the first reports on the new Tyrannosaurus species, Mcraeensis, on the spread of Tyrannosaurs between America and Asia. And there, about all Rex really says is that the material that would present the new species wouldn&#39;t by itself drastically change too much with the entire Tyrannosaur family tree.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So it would seem that Rex agrees that Mcraeensis is a legitimate species from Rex,&quot; Remington gave a shrug, though he doubted that Sophie or Roland saw it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty much,&quot; Sophie shrugged back, &quot;so... what was this surprise with regard to the squats that you and mom had to do to compare with Koji?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That your mother has stronger muscles in her hips, butt, and upper legs than I do,&quot; Remington managed, &quot;I was able to squat about 3.9 tons. Koji got 3.99 tons. Your mother had 4 tons.&quot;<br />
<br />
Remington watched as Sophie&#39;s beak clicked open and shut.<br />
<br />
&quot;And it was comparable to Jen&#39;s numbers with the same lift,&quot; Vera spoke up, &quot;she had 4.01 tons. She and Andrew guess its one of those odd cases where the Animalia Virus, particularly with Dinotopians, looks for ways to &quot;improve&quot; things. The actual animals were quadrupeds  and to handle both their own large weight, and potentially the weight of the male when mating, many of the bones in their hips would fuse for added strength.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But because all Animalians can be both bipedal and quadrupedal... and focusing more on bipeds,&quot; Remington picked up, &quot;likely coming from a very Human start... particularly for the Dinotopians... some of that alteration came with improvements and enlarging the musculature to handle any and all weight issues.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Among other things,&quot; Vera smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mooooooooooooom! It&#39;s father&#39;s day!&quot; Sophie protested, which only earned laughs from the others, including Roland.<br />
<br />
And to Remington as he glanced to Tyler, he also had the sense that regardless of some of the conversation not being a typical father&#39;s day conversation, it was going well.</p>
