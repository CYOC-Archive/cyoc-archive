<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With Sarah establishing ties with the fae, Deputy Director David Francis now organized a search team for Jacob Moreland and his family. Jacob being out of contact for this long was concerning, the old hunter wasn&#39;t the type of person to simply vanish. As the team now pulled onto the Morelands property, they could immediately see why.<br />
<br />
The house was leveled, still burning from a likely explosion. As David and the others exited their vehicles, they began an immediate search, surprised by what they saw. &quot;Rosario how many bodies do you see,&quot; he asked. Anna Rosario grimly began tallying up the corpses surrounding the Moreland home. &quot;Almost 50 sir,&quot; she replied. &quot;Almost all gunshots with some caught in the blast. Whatever went down here, Jacob put up a fight.&quot; David nodded, a grim expression on his face. Glancing at one of the corpses, he recognized the symbol of the Normal. &quot;Wesker any sign of Jacob or his family?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No sir,&quot; Greg said sadly. &quot;Meyers is leading her team into the rubble of the home. Honestly, if they&#39;re there I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll like what we find.&quot; David could only sigh, with everything that occurred over the last few hours losing Jacob would be a critical blow. The Normal had caught everyone by surprise, attacking Circes Park, kidnapping the Soul Drive, stealing Chenoa&#39;s magic, and murdering more people than he wanted to think about. <br />
<br />
&quot;Director Francis!&quot;<br />
<br />
David turned as Hailey now sprinted towards him. David was surprised as to Haileys energy, the young vampire had just returned from a grueling mission only to throw herself into this operation. &quot;What is it Meyers,&quot; he asked. &quot;Sir we found a body,&quot; she exclaimed, David feeling his stomach drop. He had held out hope that Jacob would be okay but realistically, he knew this was coming. &quot;You found Jacob?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No sir,&quot; Hailey replied. &quot;We found a vampire corpse. It&#39;s burnt to a crisp!&quot; David balked, Jacob wasn&#39;t here but where was he?<br />
<br />
Two hours earlier <br />
<br />
Jacob stood, trying to stretch his back before picking up his cup of coffee. Following S.P.E.A.R agents leaving for the vampire realm, he had returned home. It was getting late and after so many years away, he savored the quiet time he could spend with his wife and children. &quot;So where&#39;s Connor,&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;He and Spark were going out with their friend Miles,&quot; Nina replied. &quot;Nothing apocalyptic mind you. Just some harmless teenage fun.&quot; Jacob simply nodded, it was odd that his eldest boys were now venturing off by themselves. With Caleb away at school and Connor spending more time with friends, the retired hunter found himself embracing the quietness of the empty nest. &quot;So quiet around here without the boys,&quot; he commented. &quot;Until the twins wake up,&quot; Nina replied with a chuckle. &quot;We don&#39;t quite have the house to ourself yet Jacob.&quot; The hunter nodded, taking a sip of coffee before gazing into his wife&#39;s eyes. They maybe a ways off from having an empty nest but they could still enjoy these quiet moments together.<br />
<br />
Jacob grunted in pain as an explosion of glass rang out behind them. Sinking to his knees, he began to cough up blood before glancing at the window. He had been shot but that was impossible! The glass he had installed was ballistic proof, it should be able to stop even the most high powered rounds. That&#39;s when he realized the mistake, it could stop the most high powered modern rounds and the Normal certainly weren&#39;t from modern times. &quot;Jacob,&quot; Nina exclaimed as she pulled her husband away from the window. Already they could hear machine gun fire, the bullets ricocheting off the panels of the house. Tearing open her husband&#39;s shirt, she could see a bullet hole on the right side of his chest with an exact one on the other side. &quot;It&#39;s a through and through,&quot; she said quickly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Noticed,&quot; Jacob winced. &quot;Think it knicked my lung.&quot; Nina nodded, the years of work as a hunter taking over. The wound wasn&#39;t immediately fatal luckily but, he would need medical attention immediately. The biggest concern now was blood loss. Keeping low she now turned on her gas stove before warming up a pair of knives. &quot;How many do you see,&quot; she asked. Jacob grunted, scooting his way up the wall before twisting his head. &quot;Say 30 out front,&quot; he winced. &quot;Probably more in the back.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Nina now reached for some alcohol, Jacob noticed Daphne enter the kitchen. &quot;Sir I locked the doors,&quot; she said. &quot;And I brought you this.&quot; Glancing at the golem, Jacob could see the golem brought a small arsenal of firearms. &quot;Thansk Daphne,&quot; he grunted as he reached for a pistol. &quot;Get Jim and the twins. We&#39;re going to need to make a quick exit.&quot; As Daphne now ran, Nina approached holding a knife with a white hot blade. Giving her husband a swig of whiskey, the pair exchanged a look. This was going to hurt.<br />
<br />
Jacob grunted, holding back a scream as Nina cauterized the wounds. The smell of burning flesh stung the air but at least the bleeding was stopped. Grunting in pain, Jacob slammed his fist into the wall before grabbing his pistol. With a yell, he now returned fire with his wife at his side. <br />
<br />
Outside, Blackbird watched as her troops moved into position. Although the Boss had aged her into adulthood, Blackbird aka Ann fondly remembered the night she had torn Jacob Morelands arm from his shoulder. At the time they weren&#39;t trying to kill him but secretly, she hoped she did. Instead Jacob Moreland survived, working with S.P.E.A.R to keep her kind in check. When the Boss gave her this assignment, she could barely hold back her glee. A chance to finally finish off Jacob Moreland. To do so, the Boss had Remy design a high velocity round that could penetrate even the strongest ballistic glass of this Era. Considering the Normal came from 80 plau years in the future, it proved to be a simple task as Blackbird hit her mark. All they needed to do now was get inside. <br />
<br />
Jacob scowled as he and Nina reloaded. They were better shots and already eliminated at least a dozen soldiers but the Normal had a clear numerical advantage. When Daphne secured the doors, she had secured a solid metal plate that latched into place. The plate itself was secured within the walls, allowing the Moreland family extra security without making their home seem like a prison. The Normal discovered this when they reached the doorway, the sounds of them trying to break in could clearly be heard. For now the doors were holding but it was only a matter of time before they gave way. &quot;Jim,&quot; Jacob coughed, wiping blood from his lips. &quot;Need you to get Nina and the kids out of here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oy no problem,&quot; Jim the immortal skull replied in his cockney accent. &quot;Where too?&quot; Jacob thought for a moment, the sounds of bullets bouncing off the house making it hard to think. &quot;Magic Shop. Take them to the Magic Shop.&quot; Jim may not be able to nod, but he seemed to convey he understood. &quot;I can get us there but there&#39;s a problem,&quot; the skull stated. &quot;Gonna take a minute to open and close.&quot; Jacob nodded, exchanging a look with Nina that made his wife pale. &quot;No,&quot; she screamed. &quot;No! Don&#39;t you dare Jacob Moreland! There&#39;s got to be a better way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There ain&#39;t Nina,&quot; Jacob replied, his voice low. &quot;In about five minutes those doors are going to give way. If that portals open than you and the kids will be in danger. Someone has to be here to make sure you get out safely.&quot; Nina bit her lip, they had prepared for something like this. After proposing, Jacob explained the &quot;nuclear option&quot; if their home was ever breached. In that situation, they would need to destroy the home and everything in it. Hunters carried far too many secrets, meaning nothing could fall into an enemies hand. In those situations, Nina thought the pair would escape together. Now, looking at her critically injured husband, she knew it would just be her. As Nina quickly gathered the Hunters Diaries, Jacob now placed a gentle kiss on both Chase and Charlotte&#39;s foreheads before whispering to them. &quot;Jim get em outta here!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob watched as the immortal skull now opened a portal to the Magic Shop. As the shop came into focus, Nina tossed the diaries through before taking the children and Jim in her arms. Husband and wife now exchanged a parting, heartbreaking glance before the portal closed leaving Jacob alone with the golem Daphne. As Jacob reloaded his pistol and shotgun, he glanced up into the stoic stone golem before him. &quot;You should have gone with then Daphne.&quot;<br />
<br />
Daphne said nothing, the massive stone golem stoic as her marble eyes locked with Jacob&#39;s. &quot;We both know you&#39;re going to need to stall for a couple of minutes before the timer reaches zero. You cant do it yourself,&quot; she said quietly. &quot;Otherwise they could stop the countdown and take everything in here.&quot; Jacob nodded, grunting in pain as he repositioned himself. &quot;True,&quot; he sighed. &quot;And what&#39;s left here could cause major problems for everyone we know. Can&#39;t let anyone get a hold of it. Ya do realize though, this is a one way trip.&quot; The golem nodded, understanding what Jacob was saying. This was a suicide mission that neither one was expected to survive. It struck Daphne that she was willing to sacrifice her life, when Jacob was giving her permission to save herself. For that reason alone she wouldn&#39;t abandon the hunter that made her a part of his family.<br />
<br />
&quot;It has been an honor being part of your family Jacob Moreland.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob smirked, Daphne was an indispensable part of the family, caring for Connor and the twins and making life easier for Nina. As the doors gave way he felt an eternal gratitude towards the golem. Maybe, just maybe, they would get out of this alive. Providing cover to the Amazonian golem, he watched as Daphne raged. He always suspected she was capable of fighting, she just never showed it. As she now began fighting off soldier after soldier, he admired the golems abilities. As yet another broken soldier sailed passed him, he noticed a familiar foe lurking in the doorway.<br />
<br />
&quot;Daphne watch it!&quot;<br />
<br />
Daphne turned as an adult vampire with red hair lunged at her. Blocking the initial attack, the golem slammed the vampire into the wall before delivering a thunderous blow to her midsection. As Daphne looked to cave in the vampires skull, she dodged. Jacob&#39;s eyes now went wide as the vampire kicked at Daphnes elbow, snapping the marble golems arm clean off.<br />
<br />
As Daphne stood, Jacob could see her face remained stoic. She may have lost an arm but she was still in the fight. Now fighting at a disadvantage, she continued to damage the vampire, slamming her into the walls and delivering punches that would turn a normal opponent to paste. Unfortunately, the golem was not fighting a normal opponent. The vampire sprung to her feet, despite her silence Jacob could see the rage in her eyes.  She hadn&#39;t expected this level of resistance and was growing tired of Daphnes interference. Scanning the room, the vampire saw an opportunity. Seeing a metal safe, the vampire grunted, swinging the metal object with all her might and connecting with Daphnes head. Jacob could do little more than watch sullenly as Daphnes head was knocked from her shoulders before the vampire brought the safe down on her head. As the golem s lifeless body collapsed to the floor, Jacob gazed up at his would be executioner. &quot;Think I heard your men calling your name,&quot; he grunted. &quot;Blackbird was it?&quot;<br />
<br />
The auburn haired vampire said nothing, simply stomping her foot down once for yes. Jacob nodded, a grin crossing his face. &quot;That ain&#39;t your name though,&quot; he said. &quot;Just what the Normal call you. Isn&#39;t it Ann?&quot;<br />
<br />
Another single stomp, signaling yes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Knew it,&quot; Jacob smiled, a raspy cough escaping his lips as he wiped the blood from his lips. &quot;You intending on killing me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Stomp.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thought so,&quot; Jacob grunted, his eyes locking with the murderous vampire that had haunted his dreams since his maiming. &quot;You&#39;ve haunted me since you did this,,&quot; he stated, gesturing to his missing arm. &quot;Knew someday you&#39;d come back to finish the job.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stomp.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bout what I thought,&quot; he chuckled, reaching into his pocket to retrieve something. Blackbird watched with malicious interest as Jacob now slowly withdrew a stopwatch that was counting down. &quot;But you should&#39;ve known better vampire. Hunters...we always got a plan.&quot; Blackbird/Ann now tilted her head curiously watching the digital numbers tick down as a wide smile spread across Jacob&#39;s face. Slowly it dawned on her what it was as Jacob spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;I win.&quot;<br />
<br />
Blackbird could do little more than scream as a massive explosion now engulfed her. The magically aged up vampire felt her entire body burst into flames as an explosion now obliterated the Moreland home.<br />
<br />
********************<br />
<br />
&quot;We can&#39;t find Jacob&#39;s body Director Francis,&quot; Meyers stated. &quot;All other bodies were accounted for, including the Morelands golem. We found pieces of her inside.&quot; David nodded grimly, without Jacob&#39;s body it was hard to say what happened to the hunter, but he wasn&#39;t holding out much hope. &quot;Good job Meyers,&quot; he said softy. &quot;Secure the scene and get the bodies to the morgue. I receivedword that Jacobs family is safe, at least somethingdecenthas cone out of this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do we tell Director McMillan?&quot;<br />
<br />
David glanced upwards towards the sky, for now it was impossible to say what happened. &quot;I&#39;ll tell her Jacob is MIA,&quot; he said sadly. &quot;She&#39;s going to be broken up about it but we can&#39;t say anything for certain.&quot; Meyers nodded, a sullen look on her face as she gazed at the ruins if the Moreland home. Jacob had saved his family but it may have cost him his own life.</p>
