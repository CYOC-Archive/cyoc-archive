<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“...Yes. Yes I do, sir.”<br />
<br />
It had been less than 24 hours that Mark Stevenson had muttered those words at the dean’s office and he was already regretting his decision. His gut told him that he should’ve refused, but his parents were so proud of him when he told them that he had finally been accepted at an university...He just couldn’t allow himself to break his parents’ heart. Mark had always been a good boy all his life, he never got into trouble and his high school grades had been excellent, but in this day and age a fine young male couldn’t afford a scholarship with just high grades and good intentions. He certainly needed that scholarship, but was he ready for what was to come? He always did as he was asked and obeyed all the rules so he wasn’t that worried about being disciplined. But still, was giving up his genitals really that necessary? On his last night at home, the young man stayed up for hours staring at what was below the sheets with the help of a flashlight. His manhood seemed to sleep peacefully, completely unaware that the following morning it would be separated from his owner for years to come. Mark thought about having one last wank, but he was so nervous that he didn’t manage to cum before falling into a deep sleep. When he recovered his consciousness it was already too late to even have a proper breakfast so regrettably his genitals were tucked inside a tight pair of tighty whiteys with their balls full.<br />
<br />
And now here he was, at the gates of Dickering Men’s University. A flag with the university’s emblem stood proudly on top of them. Mark wasn’t sure what that emblem was supposed to represent, but it looked eerily similar to a pink dickhead. It was probably better if he didn’t ask. The dean had given him explicit instructions for his first day at campus. He was to go to the processings building first, then present himself to his classmates at the faculty building and finally his roommate had supposedly been told to accompany him to his room.<br />
Mark was decidedly scared about the processings building. The name made it sound like this campus was some sort of penitentiary, but the name wasn’t the worst part of it.<br />
“READY TO KISS YOUR BABY MAKERS GOODBYE, BEAUTIFUL SNOWFLAKE?!”<br />
“Aaaaaaah!” Mark nearly pissed himself. He had barely entered the building when a giant mountain of a man showed up! And he wasn’t just huge and muscular, he was wearing black rubber boots and gloves and a similarly colored-singlet left his humongous biceps, pecs, and bulge on his crotch clearly visible to everyone. But the most bizarre thing was on his head: a black helmet that didn’t let anyone see his face that was shaped like the school’s emblem. In other words, it looked like he had a giant rubber black dildo head on his shoulders! Who the hell was this monstrosity?!<br />
“Please, don’t kill meeee!”<br />
The masked psychopath got closer to Mark and inhaled, smelling the young man’s pheromones. “I SMELL COCK! SOMEONE’S GETTING PUNISHED TODAY!”<br />
“Now that’s enough, you two!” A man in uniform said.<br />
The masked man seemed reluctant, but ultimately let go of Mark and stood at attention in a corner of the room. When Mark recovered his breath he asked the man who the hell that was.<br />
“First up, we don’t tolerate that kind of language over here. If you had been processed already I’d have no other choice but to punish you. Second, that hulking beast is one of Dickering Men’s University hounds, or “Dickhounds” for short. They’re well-trained personnel, most of them selected from penitentiaries all over the country, specialized in sniffing penises of all shapes and sizes as well as other types of contraband that would cause sinful behaviour among our students like dildos and vibrators. And third and most importantly, you’re Mark Stevenson, right? I’ve been waiting for you. Let me make this clear, I’m supposed to be on vacation. I spent last month removing hundreds of genitals from all the new arrivals. Imagine my surprise when the dean calls me because there’s one last student who enrolled late...<br />
“Oh, I’m sorry sir...” Said Mark, he didn’t really want to cause any trouble.<br />
“Of course you are.” Answered the man coldly. “Let’s get this over fast. Strip while I get the devices ready.”<br />
The man searched through the drawers looking for something while Mark stood there dumbfounded.<br />
“DIDN’T YOU HEAR, MARK STEVENSON?! STRIP OFF THOSE CLOTHES AND ASSUME THE POSITION!” Growled the dickhound.<br />
As much as he was shaking, Mark had no option but to obey the orders. He removed his shirt, exposing his pale and lanky torso. He barely had body hair apart from his armpits but he liked the treasure trail that went from his navel to his pubes. After removing his shoes and socks, he removed his pants to reveal fragile-looking legs mostly devoid of hair just like the rest of his body.<br />
The man in uniform finally found the small blue disc he was looking for, but he got really angry when he saw that Mark was still wearing his underwear.<br />
“We don’t have all day! Your pecker is probably nothing to call home about so strip off those tighty whiteys and let’s get that disgusting thing removed.”<br />
A blushing Mark lowered his underwear and, just as the man had said, his genitals were pretty much unremarkable. His small testes and flaccid penis flopped as he jumped to get out of his briefs. Then man put on white gloves and was about to place the disc over the young man’s crotch when, to Mark’s surprise, started stroking the exposed penis.<br />
“What the...? Woah...”<br />
It was the first time another man had touched Mark’s genitals. He felt ashamed but it felt surprisingly good. After last night’s fiasco this was just the relief he needed...<br />
“Is this as hard as you can get?” Asked the man.<br />
“Oh...Yes...It’s never been this hard ever before...” Said Mark feeling like he was about to orgasm already.<br />
Then the man stopped stroking and placed a ruler next to Mark’s penis.<br />
“3.95 inches long when hard.” He said as he annotated that data in Mark’s student file. “Just as I thought. Very unremarkable.”<br />
The dickhound laughed very loudly as he patted his own gigantic bulge through the singlet. He apparently found Mark’s size hilarious.<br />
Then it was the moment of truth. The blue disc was placed over Mark’s cock and balls and, just by pressing a small button on the side of them...*CLICK!*<br />
Mark’s mouth was left hanging open. He could felt the man’s gloved hand cupping his genitals but...They were no longer attached to him! Between his pubes was just a blank crotch, he was like a Ken doll!<br />
“Mmm, interesting, it shriveled up very fast.” Said the man teasing the tip of Mark’s penis with his finger. “At least it’s circumcised. That’ll make storage easier.”<br />
“Please, don’t touch it like that...” Mark pleaded.<br />
“Actually you are no longer the legal owner of your penis. It’s the property of Dickering Men’s University until your graduation, unless you cancel your scholarship, then it that case it’s property of this university indefinitely.”<br />
“What?! Nobody told me that...”<br />
“We keep your penis as a guarantee. It was clearly written in your scholarship’s agreement.”<br />
Mark was devastated. Did that mean that if he never managed to graduate he would never get his cock and balls back? That sounded scary!<br />
Mark’s genitals were carefully stored in a crystal container. A sticker with a serial number linking back to Mark’s student file and the phrase “Property of Dicking Men’s University” was printed and glued into it.<br />
“We’ll send it to the vault later. All the student’s penises are properly cleaned from any urine and smegma stuck on them once a week, so if you feel like you need to pee just let go. And now, for the final part of your processing...”<br />
“What?! There’s more?”<br />
“We have a tradition here. To commemorate your rebirth as a pure man you’ll be completely shaved. You’ll be smooth as a baby. Or even more. If you are a good boy, you’ll be allowed to regrow some of it back over the months.”<br />
Mark wanted to protest, but then the dickhound got hold of him with an electric set of clippers.<br />
“LET’S MAKE YOU SOFT AND CUDDLY!”<br />
“Nooo!” Mark cried, but the dickhound was too strong. The masked man shaved away the hair on Mark’s head completely, including eyebrows! His armpits were next to go, but the part that the dickhound really enjoyed cutting off was the treasure trail and Mark’s pubes. He pressed the clippers very hard on Mark’s blank crotch as he did, like he wanted to remind him that nothing was there anymore. The sparse hairs on his legs were shaved as well and Mark was really embarrassed when he was ordered to show his asshole as the hairs on his butt were mercilessly ripped off.<br />
Mark was now completely smooth and devoid of hair. That, combined with the fact that he had no genitals, made him feel like a mannequin.<br />
“And that finishes off the processing. All right! I can finally go home now! You can go now to to the faculty building to present yourself to your teachers and classmates.”<br />
Mark was about to leave, but then he realized that his clothes were gone.<br />
“Hey! Where are my clothes? They were over there a second ago!”<br />
“Ah, I delivered them to your dorm’s laundry. They smelt quite badly.”<br />
“But how can I go around the campus naked like this?!”<br />
“What do you mean, ‘naked like this’? Don’t you know what ‘presenting’ means? You have to go to your classroom and present the naked, shaved penis-free new you to your classmates. All the new arrivals are required to go nude their first day, it makes them humble and helps them accept their new status among their peers...Now that I think about it, as you’re a month late, you’ll be the only naked student on campus today...Oh well, sucks to be you.”<br />
Mark’s scholarship had just begun, and it already felt like hell on Earth...What more could happen on his first day of his cockless life at Dickless U?...<br />
<br />
“SUCKS TO BE YOU, BUT YOU NO LONGER HAVE ANY PEEPEE TO HAVE SUCKED OFF! HAHAHAHA!” Mocked the dickhound as he shoved the naked, hairless and emasculated Mark outside the processings building...</p>
