<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Dave!!! Dave!!! Dave!!!&quot; You cry in your mind but Dave clearly isn&#39;t hearing you. You keep trying to cry out to him but your lips won&#39;t move at all, more like they can&#39;t now. You try to pull your hand down or wave it side to side to try to get his attention but you feel no movement in you at all. You for a moment gasp in excitement as you watch Dave get up and start moving toward you. &quot;Dave Dave! I&#39;m stuck in the painting! I can&#39;t move! Come here and touch me so we can speak! D- Dave? Dave, what are you doing?&quot; You watch motionless as Dave grabs the 2 liter on the table between you and the couch and pours himself a drink then turns around and goes back to moving toward the couch. You then hear him mutter about how he can pose you and ask himself if he can command you out of the painting to. &quot;But... I like being 2D... What did you do to me that makes me not able to move my body?...&quot; Dave then looks at his watch and you can&#39;t hear him very well with him being as far away on the couch but you can roughly hear him say its 10:30 at night now. &quot;Oh shit, it&#39;s that late? I got my art class in the morning! ... But... I can&#39;t go to art class if I&#39;m a painting now... Dave, please come help me move!&quot; You then see Dave look at you and comment on your immobility. &quot;But I&#39;m NOT faking it! I- am I really inanimate now? Dave... help me... please?&quot; <br />
<br />
Dave looks up at your painting, &quot;Well since your okay, It should be okay to let you stay in there overnight... &quot; Dave then gets up and walks past you. &quot;I&#39;ll tell your teacher you had to call out sick tomorrow, I&#39;ll try to figure out how to get you out of that canvas when I get back from work around 3. You take care of yourself in there. Night!&quot; Dave then goes into the back room of his apartment and closes the door, leaving you alone in the living room trapped inside the canvas completely unable to move or speak. <br />
<br />
&quot;You... your just going to... leave me in here overnight? D-dave!!!!!&quot; You try to call to him one last time as he closes the door to his room and turns off the lights. &quot;It&#39;s like he didn&#39;t even think to check on me...&quot; You stand there waving Hi motionless and silent for what feels like 30 minutes, only way you know the actual time is from the time clock bouncing around on his TV, its now 10:53. You&#39;ve only been alone in the scene for about 8 minutes since dave went into his bedroom to go to sleep. &quot;Okay, so... I can&#39;t move... I can&#39;t speak... but I can still see into the real world outside of my scene... My body feels so funny because I&#39;m 2D, and I&#39;ll be honest, I think I can get used to this feeling... I&#39;m not hurting, and this arousal feeling running throughout my body is so satisfying... Ya know, I think I can accept this feeling but not being able to move is... hmmmmm...&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave begins to take off his clothes and put on his nightwear. While getting dressed, he looks at his reflection in the mirror. Looking at his reflected image on the flat surface does make him ponder a bit about your situation in the other room. &quot;-sigh-, he did always want to be one of his own drawings... What if he never want&#39;s to return to 3D and just permanently remain 2D drawing.... I have the power to grant him that fate. And we can always talk, although I need to touch him to do that he really could just stay like that in there... -yawn- I&#39;ll talk to him in the morning before I go to work and see what he wants to do... I mean, it wouldn&#39;t be right for me to try to rip him out of the painting if he wants to stay that way...&quot; Dave then crawls into bed still pondering your situation inside of his canvas as he drifts off to sleep.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile in the other room, you are lost in your own thoughts too, even though you can clearly see into the room around you, you&#39;ve tuned it out to listen to your own thoughts, with the clock now reading 11:34 at night. Your still pondering on your immobility issue but are steadily finding it less and less threatening and more so relaxing. You begin to wonder if you can even sleep now that you are effectively, a real painting. You think about closing your eyes but know they won&#39;t move like the rest of your body. You quickly get a glance at the time and read its now almost 11:45 PM now and as you continue to try to close your eyes your vision feels like its getting blurry, or warping, or fading? You try to close your eyes and drift to sleep and your vision continues to fade but as you do its more like your going straight into dreaming, whats weird to you is how your vision seems to be warping, or... reversing. You begin to see an image in your mind as you start to fall asleep that feels like its calling to you, or out to you, you try to move towards it with your minds eye but as you get a clearer image you realize you are seeing your own 2D body standing there waving &#39;Hi&#39; your minds eye becomes caught in the image as you sink into it in your dreaming. As your dream further seats you into your scene, you realize that you definitely are dreaming, but... Your dreaming inside of your scene... More like your scene has fully taken up your field of vision completely, much like how if you turned around and looked into your scene while you were awake. &quot;Wow, it really is like I&#39;m a painting... I think I&#39;m dreaming but I really do feel like I&#39;m looking at my own body&quot; You don&#39;t know what time it is anymore but have started to notice that as you focus on your own image your feeling increasingly more and more comfortable and aroused from being 2D and more accepting of your own body... You begin to admire your features more than you normally would have, now that you feel like you have an eternity to admire yourself you begin to feel more appreciative of your form, the individual little brush strokes making up your hair, the little paint daubs on your face giving it detail, the detail and contrast in your clothes and the highlights in your eyes. <br />
<br />
Your beginning to love your painted form even more as you fascinate on your own scene, and as you do, you feel it become even more arousing and comfortable, as if sucking you in even further. You even notice that if you focus on specific parts of your image you can feel more intense pleasure in that part of your drawing. You even take time to focus on the feeling of canvas paper running through your whole body and think about how comforting it feels to be woven into something, much like if you were resting in the worlds softest blanket but instead of simply resting on it, it ran through you entirely to the point you are that blanket. <br />
<br />
You don&#39;t know what time it is anymore, but you are feeling in love with the idea of just being a painting... Even though you can&#39;t move or speak, the feeling of not moving is strangely more satisfying that it would be to be moving and trying to speak feels like it would be silly, your a 2D drawing now after all, why would you need to speak? You could speak all you like but theirs no one else in your scene anyway... Your alone in there after all. Perhaps Dave could draw or paint you a buddy, or perhaps a home so you arn&#39;t in such a dull blank scene, or perhaps paint you a different set of clothes? or a new face? or a new whole body! You always wanted to be anime! Well maybe you think you could ask Dave about it when he comes back... The art leading the artist? Oh now thats just silly, but isn&#39;t being a living painting already silly?<br />
<br />
You continue to ramble on in your thoughts as you dream, meanwhile in Dave&#39;s dreams, he wakens in his back room near his bed and moves his way towards the living room. He sees the canvas there but light seems to emit from it, even stranger is you aren&#39;t there. He panics a bit but sees that there is a cup of brushes next to the easel he hadn&#39;t placed there. Dave however looks into the canvas but to him its more like a doorway, but as he tries to go in, he finds he can&#39;t as if some invisible barrier is in the way, he then grabs one of the paint brushes in the cup and without thinking motions it toward the canvas but jumps back as he sees you move into frame from the bottom of the canvas. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hi!&quot; You say to him in the dream. Dave shocked says &quot;you can speak!?&quot; You reply, &quot;your dreaming silly! And your the artist! It&#39;s a bit lonely in here, can&#39;t you change something about my scene? or perhaps change something about me!&quot; &quot;Change you?&quot; Dave says questioning, &quot;Why?&quot; You then reply, &quot;Because I&#39;m your artwork silly! Your the one who pushed me into the canvas and turned me into a painting! Don&#39;t you want to do me up like one of your french girls?&quot; <br />
<br />
Dave then wakes up with his alarm clock howling, its 5:30 am in the morning, and he has to be at work in an hour...</p>
