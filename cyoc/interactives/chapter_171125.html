<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You exit the stairwell onto the 5th floor, then briefly down the hall and into the women&#39;s changing room. It&#39;s only the second time you have been in here, the first time when the men&#39;s room was out of service and you worked late that night. You head over to one of the two shower/changing stalls, hang up your backpack, and close the door. You pause for a moment, and gaze into the full length mirror on the back of the changing room door. There is a second mirror on the separation wall with the other shower stall, so you can see front and side at the same time. Your thighs are huge, but toned.  Your butt has just a little jiggle, but is mostly muscle. You can move each butt cheek separately. The suit has really good chest support, as you are sporting E or F cup breasts. They are so big, you don&#39;t know how to judge them. Your chest falls as you breath deeply, letting it sink in that you are looking at your own body. The firmness of the compression by the suit serves as a constant reminder....this is probably not a dream. Dress code....dress code.....dress code....you think to yourself. Then you realize...the zipper.<br />
<br />
First thing is first, empty the backpack and look for anything that can help you pull the zipper down. You take out the bra, top, leggings, and shoes. There is a bag that has makeup, and a bag with some jewelry, your handbag, and a toiletry bag with tampons and pads. You then proceed to dig through your handbag, finding nothing to help. You take a moment to ponder everything before you, and eye a strap on your wallet. The wrist strap is rather long and has a small snap hook on the end. You unsnap the wrist strap, and then reach behind your neck to find the zipper. You then try to snap the wrist strap to the zipper and after many attempts, success! You then slowly unzip the suit, holding the top of the zipper with one hand while you slide your hand down your back, tugging the wrist strap. You work to peel your arms out of the suit, then pulling it down over your muscle butt, then your thighs, and after that...you step out of it. Sure enough, the suit is bone dry, and smells clean, as if it were never worn. There is no reason to shower, you smell yourself, and you smell as if you just got out of the shower.<br />
<br />
The bra is the first piece you put on. There is no label, but it&#39;s a very stretchy fabric, with a defined chamber for each breast. You take a moment to get it into place and each breast in it&#39;s place. The bra is both supportive and keeps your big twins apart. The sleek, shiny black color makes it hard to determine how big your chest is, that is, until you look at the side profile. &quot;Damn they are big,&quot; you think to yourself. You step into and take your time sliding up the black shorts, stopping just above your knee. They feel like your bra, and also hide how big your butt sticks out, until you look at the side mirror. You cannot remember when your ride to work was more comfortable, and an ample bottom helped. Finally, you put your arms into the blazer, buttoning it at your waist. The blazer shows of your cleavage nicely, but looks very business like. You will have to give Candy credit at lunch for picking out  a great outfit. You slide on the two flats and put everything else back into the backpack. You make one last check, and unlatch the door and head out and to your cubicle.<br />
<br />
Accounting is small, just four people who all report to the CFO. The fifth floor is also the C-suite, and the fancy offices and board room are on one end of the floor, the other end is the executive secretarial pool, travel, and accounting. The best part is the cubicle walls go to the ceiling, and they have doors. You sit down in your chair, and pick up where you left off last Friday. The rest of the morning is normal. You have emails, a few calls for some &quot;quick numbers&quot;, but mostly your busy pulling numbers from various places, running it through your process (mostly using a spreadsheet to do pivot tables), and posting your output for the CFO to review, which he almost never does, but it doesn&#39;t matter, you take pride in your work. Your next door neighbor, Gerry, knocks on your door. It&#39;s just after 12:30, so it&#39;s lunch time. You grab your wallet out of your backpack and open the door.<br />
<br />
Gerry does a double take,  and asks &quot;Did you change your hair?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;New shampoo,&quot; you reply quickly.<br />
<br />
Gerry nods, his eyes never make it above your chest. His flushed face tells you everything. You turn and head to the stairwell, with Gerry following, his eyes stay glued to your shiny butt. There is a small staffed canteen service on the third floor with hot meals during lunch. You get in line and take a tray and slide it on the rails in front of the serving counter. Muffin comes up to you while your in line, still wearing the cycling skinsuit ... which brings questions to your mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Join Carol and I at the table. Bring your little friend too,&quot; Muffin offers and steps out of line and back over to the table she was sitting at with Candy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Care to join me for lunch Gerry?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
Gerry smiles, &quot;It would be an honor. Thank you for asking.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two of you get your lunch, pay, and sit down with Candy and Muffin, both of whom continue to wear the skinsuit from this morning&#39;s ride.<br />
<br />
Muffin smiles, &quot;Carol and I are a hit on the second floor. The COO came down with a laptop issue...and left without his laptop. He was a very happy fellow. He said we looked very nice and appreciated physical fitness in the workplace.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gerry&#39;s eyes didn&#39;t know were to stop, so he kept bouncing his glancing stare from chest to chest among the three sets available. He didn&#39;t dare speak, and was content to slowly eat his lunch while being visibly turned on by Candy and Muffin&#39;s erect nipples poking through their skinsuits.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cheaters,&quot; you say to the two. &quot;By the way, thank you for the outfit you picked out, it is surprisingly tasteful.&quot;<br />
<br />
Candy is smug, &quot;I told you so, and there is no harm in using your assets. Yes, I do agree it&#39;s completely sexist, but is is the world you live in.&quot;<br />
<br />
You ask, &quot;So HR said nothing?&quot;<br />
<br />
Candy shook her head no, &quot;The lady who took our badge photos was very complementary of how we looked. She admitted her jealously. Nice lady. I think she is the Director of HR, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
You slowly nod yes, and sigh deeply, &quot;Well played you two.&quot;<br />
<br />
Candy reaches out and pats the top of your hand, &quot;Now now....Ariana here didn&#39;t want anyone to get special treatment, so HR changed the policy, and the COO signed off. If you don&#39;t have a client facing meeting, you can use the Athleisure dress code. It&#39;s brand new today.&quot;<br />
<br />
You look over to Muffin, &quot;So you just change the rules?&quot;<br />
<br />
Muffin smiles, and nods slowly, &quot;We did ask nicely and put forth ourselves as an example.&quot;<br />
<br />
Candy look at you and asks, &quot;The COO has asked for us to help him with his mouse problem in his office this afternoon. Would you like to join us?&quot; Muffin gives you a rather obvious wink.<br />
<br />
You shake your head no, &quot;You two should be enough to diagnose a mouse problem with his laptop.&quot;<br />
<br />
Candy gives a brief chuckle, &quot;Too bad, Ariana and I don&#39;t mean to garner all of the attention. We can share.&quot;<br />
<br />
Muffin and Candy stand up with their empty trays, &quot;If you change your mind, you know where to go. And feel free to choose what you want to wear,&quot; Candy says. The two then turn together to put their trays in the return bin, and out of the eating area.<br />
<br />
Gerry smiles, and tries to make small talk, &quot;Your friends seem nice.&quot;<br />
<br />
You turn to your tray and eat, sighing deeply and responding to Gerry, &quot;Yea...they are always up to something.&quot;<br />
<br />
In your mind, this one day trail, has just added another day. You didn&#39;t want to take off the skinsuit, but you sure don&#39;t want to go put it on now. Gerry finishes his lunch, but stays until your finished and walks out with you, back to the fifth floor. Just before you exit the stairwell on the fifth floor, you turn to Gerry and ask, &quot;What part of me do you enjoy looking at the most?&quot;<br />
<br />
Gerry turns white in surprise, and looks to the floor, &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; then attempts to barge past you, but you stop him with your leg.<br />
<br />
&quot;No...really. There is no sexual harassment thing here, I promise.&quot; you say to Gerry.<br />
<br />
Gerry shakes his head, &quot;No...that&#39;s not allowed. Pretty girls only have to make the accusation and it&#39;s guilty until proven innocent. I can&#39;t lose my job.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gerry&#39;s ex-wife broke this once good, and always meek man. You pull the bottom of your bra up and expose your bare breasts to Gerry. &quot;Now do you believe me, there is just you and me having a private conversation,&quot; you say to a now flushed red Gerry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your thighs. You have the thighs of a baby making machine, and your breasts are a close number two. Babies need milk,&quot; Gerry says very softly, his face throbbing red.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Gerry, I am so sorry that bitch of an ex wife mess you up so much,&quot; as you step up and hug Gerry into your chest. He is tense at first and slowly relaxes as the hug goes on. After the hug, Gerry&#39;s clothes were now quite loose on him. You were both the same height, but he was easily pushing 300 lbs. You don&#39;t know what happened, but Gerry excuses himself and heads to the men&#39;s room in a hurry.<br />
<br />
You return to your desk when a grown man wearing clothes that are way too big for him knocks on your door, which is open. &quot;Thank you for the kind words earlier,&quot; says a much more fit looking Gerry. You stare straight at his eyes, as you see Gerry&#39;s eyes are glued to your chest. Gerry goes into his cubicle and closes his door where he works for the remainder of the day.<br />
<br />
Your other accounting neighbors are not in the office today, and the quiet lets you focus back on work. You don&#39;t stop even when Gerry says bye for the day, and it&#39;s when Candy and Muffin are standing outside your door for who knows how long, they get your attention by knocking on your open door.<br />
<br />
Candy asks, &quot;Do you want to stay here or ride home with us?&quot;<br />
<br />
You turn and grab your backpack. &quot;I&#39;m done for the day. Can you help me get the skinsuit on?&quot;<br />
<br />
Candy nods, and you proceed to disrobe in the hallway, as Muffin holds your back pack and passes what your wearing into the backpack, then handing Candy the skinsuit with the wristband still clipped onto the zipper.<br />
<br />
Muffin taps Candy on the shoulder, &quot;Told you he&#39;s smart. He used the wristband thingy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thighs, butt, chest, and arms all fit super snug. Once Candy has you zipped up in the back,  you sit in your chair to tie your cycling shoes. <br />
<br />
Muffin hands you your backpack when you stand up and says, &quot;Backpack is optional tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll meet you by the stairs, I need to go pee...sorry,&quot; you say, the urge now quite obvious due to the compression of the suit.<br />
<br />
Muffin leans forward and whispers, &quot;Go in the suit...,&quot; then leans back, with Candy nodding her head yes.<br />
<br />
You nod your head no, and try to make it to the women&#39;s restroom, but you don&#39;t. The compression highlighted the urge to go, but movement made it impossible to hold, and your bladder was empty when you made it to the restroom door. You step into the restroom now with only the desire to dry off as best you can before the ride home. You feel down with a towel you grabbed, and it&#39;s dry. No wet spot, but it&#39;s still warm. You throw the towel away and exit back into the hallway where Muffin gives you your backpack again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Trust is hard ... we understand ... Ready to go?&quot; asks Candy.<br />
<br />
You put both arms though the backpack, and the three of you head down to the parking level to unlock your bikes for the ride home. Muffin gives you a complement for your conversation with Gerry. She threw in sudden weight loss and afternoon in the men&#39;s room as his bowels flushed out nearly half his bodyweight. &quot;The guy at lunch, you should ask him over Friday night. Guys like foursomes,&quot; Candy said Muffin told you her part in today&#39;s happenings.<br />
<br />
&quot;We will see. He&#39;s still in a very venerable place and I don&#39;t want to hurt him. He is quite clingy, which his ex-wife used to manipulate him. I won&#39;t let that happen to him,&quot; you advise, being protective of Gerry.<br />
<br />
The ride home was less eventful, since it was getting dark, and the three of you were not as noticeable on the ride home, which seemed like the first normal thing of the day.</p>
