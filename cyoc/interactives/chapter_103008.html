<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The werefox slowly awoke and stretched, before a smile crossed his muzzle, because his beloved werevixen was curled up next to him.<br />
William Anderson&#39;s heart beat a tad faster at seeing his beautiful wife Martha lying in his paws.<br />
After moving to Moon Lake and their oldest son Nate fulfilled his lifelong dreams of becoming a werewolf while honoring the town&#39;s rules by becoming &quot;the family were&quot;, the married couple decided to take the plunge as well and joined were society as its (then) newest vulpine members. They had already decided that whatever species they became would be as a matched pair, but the Andersons loved the fact that the werefoxes&#39; life/mate bonds strengthened their already happy and successful (open) marriage.<br />
As William cuddled closer and nuzzled her neck, Martha started to stir.<br />
&quot;What time is it?&quot; she asked, still a bit sleepy. They had been going at it, hot and heavy, ever since their sons left, leaving them all alone in the house.<br />
&quot;A little after 6,&quot; replied her husband, after glancing at the clock radio on the night stand. &quot;It will be dark soon. Want to go out and do something foxy, my sexy dear?&quot; he asked.<br />
&quot;Maybe,&quot; she teased, running a paw against his furry chest. &quot;But I&#39;d like dinner first.&quot;<br />
&quot;Want me to go downstairs and russle up some Thanksgiving leftovers for two?&quot; he offered.<br />
&quot;Not poultry-giest again,&quot; she kidded, sharing their personal joke of what to call endless turkey. &quot;Besides, what I want to eat is all ready to serve,&quot; Martha said as a smile crossed her muzzle, while her free paw stroked her husband&#39;s hardening werefox shaft poking out of its sheath.<br />
William yipped in pleasure, his fox tail wagging happily as Martha began to orally enjoy her mate again.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE, NEXT DOOR...<br />
Samantha and Frances Twist had long since reconciled after the Town Chancellor&#39;s difficulties accepting her wife wanting to &quot;experiment&quot;  and taste semen fresh from the source arose. Since Friday afternoon, Frances had gone above and beyond the call of duty, reaching new heights of sexual pleasure showing her mate how much she loved being Samantha&#39;s wife.<br />
But eventually that changed.<br />
Except for meals and bathroom breaks, as well as another sensual bubble bath for two, the married lesbian werecats were now expressing their mutual love and desire for each other.<br />
Now a quiet Saturday evening dinner for two had progressed to dessert, with Samantha bringing in strawberries, chocolate pudding, and whipped cream for two.<br />
Still in their fursonas, the happy couple sat at their dining room table and ate by candlelight. Each dipping a strawberry into the chocolate pudding before squirting a dab of whipped cream on it before sensually feeding their mate.<br />
Samantha looked disappointed upon realizing the strawberries were gone, but smiled at Frances as she dipped a fingertip into the chocolate pudding.<br />
Frances eagerly opened her mouth in anticipation of being sensually fed anew, but was surprised when her wife wiped the pudding on what Samantha always called &quot;her cute button nose&quot;.<br />
After licking what she could off with her werecat tongue, Frances grinned at Samantha as she grabbed the can of whipped cream.<br />
Samantha feigned shock as she reached for what was left of the chocolate pudding and ran back to their bedroom, her tail swishing sexily behind her.<br />
Frances blew out the candles and followed her mate.<br />
What ensued became a sensual feline-centric dessert that eventually required another intimate bubble bath for two and new bed linen.<br />
<br />
ELSEWHERE...<br />
After taking Eric Anderson&#39;s Queen, Evan Lawson managed to win that chess game, but it was still a tough mental battle against a worthy opponent.<br />
Now tied at one win apiece, Evan was setting the board up for the tie-breaker game when his daughter Spencer said it was getting dark, and she would love a chance to stretch her legs since it was now legal for her to go outside, still being stuck in her hybrid were form as her injuries healed.<br />
Evan (reluctantly) agreed and offered to order take out while Eric accompanied Spencer on a short walk through the woods.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s supposed to be here within 30 minutes or its free,&quot; her father reminded her as the happy couple walked out the back door into the surrounding forest.<br />
Once they were out of her father&#39;s acute hearing range as a werewolf, Eric told Spencer about Evan&#39;s offer, which unfortunately also led to him eventually losing the game.<br />
&quot;Dad&#39;s offered to pimp for you?&quot; Spencer said in disbelief.<br />
&quot;He&#39;s offered to keep an eye out in case he ever meets a werepanthress other than Nate&#39;s girlfriend who might be willing to induct me into were society,&quot; Eric explained, while holding his girlfriend&#39;s paw that wasn&#39;t in a sling.<br />
&quot;Basically the same thing Slugger,&quot; said Spencer, while kissing the top of her boyfriend&#39;s head, since her fursona was taller than his normal human height. &quot;He must really like you and truly wants us happy and together if dad&#39;s willing to go to such lengths for us,&quot; she realized.<br />
&quot;Someday I hope to make you happy as the were of your dreams too, but right now I&#39;m glad I make you happy as just plain old Eric Anderson.&quot;<br />
Spencer looked at him and said tenderly, &quot;There is absolutely nothing plain about you Eric Anderson. You&#39;re everything a girl could ever hope for in a guy, and a whole lot more too. I could of done without the double feature of Bower Junior and Senior, let alone this,&quot; she said, briefly waving her slinged arm, &quot;but that trail did lead me to you. You are the best thing that has ever happened to me in my entire life, and I&#39;ve got this mighty strong feeling that things are going to get even better between us than they are now. Whenever it happens, you eventually becoming a were, regardless of what species, will just be icing on the cake. You&#39;ll still be the Eric Anderson I love. Just with a fur coat,&quot; added Spencer, before kissing him.<br />
When their lips parted, Eric said, &quot;I hope this isn&#39;t too forward of me, but I got you something,&quot; as he reached into his pants pocket and pulled out a pink piece of plastic.<br />
&quot;A <i>Star Sapphire power ring from the Green Lantern series</i>?&quot; asked Spencer, recognizing what it was.<br />
&quot;I got it as part of an old comic book promotion while I was still living in Minnesota. I want you to have it,&quot; said Eric, trying to slip it on Spencer&#39;s free paw, but with her still being in her fursona, the closest it came to fitting was on the upper half of her pinkie.<br />
&quot;There,&quot; he said, looking at it proudly. &quot;I seriously love you Spencer Lawson, so please think of this as a promise ring, until...&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh Eric!&quot; she cried, hugging him close and tight, momentarily forgetting he was still a normal human.<br />
Eric felt a little pain, but never said anything as they kissed again.<br />
&quot;You know, I don&#39;t have anything for you,&quot; realized Spencer.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve already gotten the one thing that I treasure more than anything else. You,&quot; said Eric, before kissing his girlfriend again.<br />
With a smile on her muzzle and on his face, Spencer put her good furry arm across his shoulders as Eric wrapped an arm around her furry waist before they happily walked back to the Lawson house for dinner before continuing the ongoing chess match.</p>
