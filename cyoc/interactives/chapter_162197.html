<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Since that day at Madame Illusia show, Mateo and Hector&#39;s lifes changed drastically. Mateo became more confident, his self-esteem increased a lot and he turned into a very popular guy in his school. His father, on the other hand, learned to respect his son, he became less aggressive and started to bond better with Mateo.<br />
<br />
However, those changes took their time and it became common to see monkey Hector hanging around the house. Mateo wasn&#39;t a bad son, so he didn&#39;t use his music box when his father was working or when they&#39;re in crowded places. Hector appreciated that and he ended up liking becoming a monkeyman sometimes. He even built a special room to play and to keep his bananas which became even more common to see in their house.<br />
<br />
Eight years later, little Mateo had become a good looking 16 years old teen. Athletic, very popular in high school and frequently dating a lot of girls. Hector supported his son behavior although he didn&#39;t like it that much and, after a few months, they almost completely forgot about the music box. However, one night things changed again.<br />
<br />
Hector was working late on his computer and eating a banana when he heard a weird noise downstairs. It was past midnight and he was alone. Mateo was sleeping with a friend, or that&#39;s what he thought. Because when he went downstairs he found out his son completely drunk, his hair made a mess, his shirt wrong buttoned and his shoes on his hands, or at least one of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? You&#39;re drunk!!&quot; Hector yelled at his son. However, Mateo was too intoxicated to answer. He collapsed on the floor and Hector had to carry him to his bedroom. He sighed disappointed as he stared at the drunk teen sleeping like a rock. He had became a better person and he thought that his son was becoming a better person as well. The next morning, Mateo just pretended that nothing happened and he ignored his father when he tried to talk about it.<br />
<br />
That kept happening weekend after weekend. Frequently Mateo arrived so drunk that he can&#39;t walk, sometimes he arrived with drunk girl and Hector could hear his son&#39;s mattress screeching due to the hardcore sex Mateo was having. The last straw happened a night when Mateo arrived before midnight, something unusual for him now, but he was accompanied by his friends, they&#39;re mildly drunk but they had tons of beer cans that they buyed illegally because they&#39;re still 16 years old. Hector was trying to ignore the noise that those teenagers were making in his house, but when he heard a cop siren approaching he knew that he had to interfere.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mateo! Calm down!! Please!! It&#39;s very late!!&quot;  Hector tried to speak with his son but he just ignored him. His friends were making fun of him and the banana in Hector&#39;s hand. So, Mateo turned around embarrassed and yelled at his father in a way that Hector reminded of himself in the past. He dropped his banana in the ground and left momentarily. After that, the cops arrived at the home and all the drunk teenagers ran out through the back windows.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hector came back and talked with the cops. They gave him a warning before they left the house. Now, Hector was alone with his son who was cockily drinking a beer can on the couch. Mateo just smiled at his father as if he didn&#39;t care that cops had arrived and his friends ran away like rats. Hector smiled back and revealed to his son that he had in his hands the old music box that his son had used against him for several years.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you want to be a monkey now, dad?&quot; Mateo grinned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you remember what Madame Illusia said? The music box charms the subject it is used against.&quot; Mateo eyes wide opened and he ran to stop his dad. However, he wasn&#39;t fast enough because Hector had started to turned the clank. Mateo tripped and took a simian position with his knuckles on the ground. While his clothes vanished in the air, Hector realized that it was the first time he saw his son naked in a very long time. He was amazed to see some hairs on his son&#39;s chest but most impressive was the bush of pubes around his crotch. He saw those hairs thickening and becoming into monkey fur just like had gone through a lot of times.<br />
<br />
Mateo tried to protest but he can&#39;t speak anymore and he only could make monkey sounds that suddenly turned into moans when his 5 inches dick grew big and pendulous like his father&#39;s. From his back, his spine had already lengthened to create his monkey tail that moved side to side like if it has its own life. &quot;Pleas-ook! Dad!!&quot; Mateo managed to beg before he lost control of his body and start to jump and act like a monkey. His face red of shame as he unwittingly showed off his junk to his dad for the first time and scratched his now hairy butt.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, son, but tou left me no choice.&quot; Hector told to his monkey boy as he threw him a banana. &quot;Take it, you&#39;re going to love them.&quot;</p>
