<br />
++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Charles Wise Senior awoke to the feeling of a great headache. He remembered heading up for a major fishing tournament in Norway, which had the chief prize going to who caught the biggest fish. This was commonly the way to win any fishing tournament, but if the fish being caught wasn&#39;t a game fish, the tournament wasn&#39;t necessarily as fun, particularly when it was mandated catch and release. He remembered getting hit by something and then nothing. He remembered wandering around a lake in Sweden and a random cabin, but not much more than that. However, as he woke up he did hear voices.<br />
<br />
&quot;Will your soughters play with me?&quot; a voice asked, sounding very much like a little girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;I cannot see why they wouldn&#39;t want to play with you,&quot; answered a more adult voice that sounded like it was halfway between a woman&#39;s voice and a man&#39;s voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; said the little girl.<br />
<br />
His eyes fluttered open to see what looked like a giant cat with the tail of a scorpion, the torso of a human with four breasts and the head of a saber toothed cat talking with a scorpion taur. The Scorpion taur was covered in a black exoskeleton with small hairs in places, but &quot;she&quot; seemed to have a more human like face. The only thing that made her look inhuman there was what looked like the multiple jointed mouth-parts (Chelicerae) of scorpions that grew out from &quot;her&quot; cheeks and looked like they were to help pull food into her mouth. He also thought he saw what looked like a few small solid black primitive eyes right above those mouthparts. Her regular eyes where where they should be and were the same size as a human eye, but was also solid black. She had what looked like two sets of arms, one ending in giant pincers and one ending in clawed hands. Charles Wise Sr. didn&#39;t know what to make of these creatures, but for the moment he was too out of it to really be afraid.<br />
<br />
&quot;Unnnhhh...&quot; he gave a weak groan as he moved his head.<br />
<br />
That attracted attention of the creatures in the room with him. The more cat-like one turned and slowly approached, giving Charles Wise Sr. a better look at her saber-like teeth and the four breasts that she had, though they were covered by an some plant fiber that he couldn&#39;t identify. He only groaned again as she approached. As he looked to her, he also found that those four breasts looked rather firm, yet still soft.<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s awake,&quot; the cat-like one said to the scorpion-like one.<br />
<br />
Gaining some strength and getting over the surprise at their inhuman features, Charles Wise focused the cat-like one&#39;s maternal material. He then tentatively reached out with one hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Such exotic beauty,&quot; Charles Wise Sr said slowly and caressed the lowermost breast on the cat-like one. The breast was warm and soft, yet firm, and even with the vest on, he could feel a nipple, so this creature wasn&#39;t wearing a bra deliberately or didn&#39;t know about them. He then thought, &quot;Heh... I could teach her a few things on looking pretty and what men want...&quot;<br />
<br />
The reaction he got, however was not what Charles Wise Sr expected.<br />
<br />
&quot;DAD!&quot; Charlie shrieked and leaped up and back, nearly crashing into the wall.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad...?&quot; Charles Wise senior said slowly, he remembered having two sons, whom he did love, though he wished that he had gotten custody instead of jealous prude he had been married to. But both of these creatures looked rather female, how could they be his sons.<br />
<br />
&quot;A lot has happened since you last saw us,&quot; Charlie spoke as shi recovered and brushed hirself off. Shi loved it when Sally massaged hir breasts. Sally&#39;s hands were gentle and shi was Charlie&#39;s mate. When they were with each other and did those sorts of things it was to reaffirm their bonds of love, the bonds they fully forged all those years ago when shi and Sally first came into heat and then conceived Pinkie and Janice. But this wasn&#39;t Sally. This was hir father and shi did NOT want to be felt up by hir father. &quot;A lot has happened...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re gay?!&quot; Charles Wise senior demanded.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Charlie answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;But... but you&#39;re female...&quot; Charles Wise answered as he eyed his soughter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually... I&#39;m a perfect hermaphrodite,&quot; Charlie said slowly, &quot;it happened after you vanished on that last fishing trip you went on. A couple of scientists, wanting to end war, racism, homophobia, gender biases and whatnot figured out  a way to perfect a retrovirus that would turn people into hermaphroditic cat-taurs... Chakats. Their original idea for it was to simply unleash it like a virus and it spread through Fee City... some neighbors were changed, coated a vibrator in their cum and sent it to me. I was wearing shorts at the time and a drop of the cum fell on my knee... it took awhile for my body to fully absorb the virus... but  in the end the change was inevitable... My body elongated and I grew forelegs... my balls pulled inside me and vagina formed behind my penis... I grew a tail and breasts and a my face pushed into a muzzle. I became a Chakat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You turned into that...?&quot; Charles Wise Sr questioned.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, then I was based more off of a Cheetah, now I&#39;m a Manticore based Chakat,&quot; Charlie explained, &quot;either way, I became a creature with both genders that are fully functional.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about that girl you liked?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sally? Shi is a Chakat now too... also transformed during the outbreak in Fee City, and we are happy together as mates and parents,&quot; Charlie answered, giving a proud smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;You sired children in her?&quot; Charles Sr. asked, finding it all hard to believe, but strangely he found himself accepting it.<br />
<br />
&quot;And shi sired children within me,&quot; Charlie smiled again, &quot;I am both a father and mother and so is Sally. And we love each other very much...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve been pregnant?&quot; Charles Sr asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I have,&quot; Charlie answered, &quot;I AM a hermaphrodite a perfect one. Not just someone who felt feminine on the inside but was born male and had surgery. I have both sets of equipment and organs and they all work perfectly... in fact both Brent and I are pregnant right now... though for me at least it&#39;s very early. Only about a month along.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Brent?&quot; Charles Sr said slowly and turned to the Scorpkat who had moved around to the side of the bed to stand beside Charlie. It was at this time that he noticed a young Chakat, who looked like shi was about six and carried hirself like shi was about six.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, dad, it&#39;s me,&quot; Brent said slowly with a a great sigh, hir mouthparts moving in as shi talked to allow hir to speak, &quot;I wasn&#39;t transformed in Fee City like Charlie was... I was actually out looking for you and ended up in the Vatican...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The Pope ain&#39;t a fisherman,&quot; Charles Sr grumbled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe, but I&#39;d gotten clues from some guy that you were there... but while the two that started the outbreak that transformed Charlie realized their mistake... the revelation of it got some terrorist named Li Sang interested and he threw his entire organization into using the virus to commit robberies and sow chaos,&quot; Brent answered, &quot;Charlie&#39;s actually part of a team of Kats that have been trying to get the lid back on the genie&#39;s bottle as it were...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope you killed this Li Sang,&quot; Charles Sr growled, deciding that he would hate the one that his son&#39;s had been fighting.<br />
<br />
&quot;He did pay for his crimes,&quot; Charlie spoke, &quot;but his organization has survived him... and they actually launched the outbreak in the Vatican.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And they haven&#39;t just been using cats... in the Vatican they used various Arachnids... spiders, scorpions, and others... I became a Scorpkat and was raped by one of the Scorpkats there...&quot; Brent said slowly, watching as hir father&#39;s eyes widened, &quot;and I&#39;m presently carrying twenty eggs...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Twenty?&quot; Charles Sr said slowly.<br />
<br />
Brent nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Couldn&#39;t you fight?&quot; Charles Sr asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;The lust phase of the virus is pretty hard to fight,&quot; Charlie spoke, &quot;the Kats that raped Brent probably had no wish to do so... but were so horny that they did it anyway...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And at the time... I was horny enough that I couldn&#39;t fight,&quot; Brent sighed, &quot;what happened was rape... but the virus couldn&#39;t be fought once infected. As a result... I will soon be joining my sither as a mother...&quot;<br />
<br />
Charles Sr then watched as Brent then moved the little Kat in front of hir. He noticed that the little Chakat looked like shi would have saber teeth when shi grew up.<br />
<br />
&quot;At least with regards to children I&#39;ve given birth to,&quot; Brent continued, &quot;but since I&#39;ve taken in little Kila here, I&#39;m a parent by means of adoption.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And we&#39;re all living here in Janace, Colorado where we&#39;ve been combating outbreaks for twelve years,&quot; Charlie added, &quot;and we&#39;ve formed rather large families...&quot;<br />
<br />
Charlie decided not to mention hir mother specifically. Shi did remember the divorce between Nikole and hir father, though shi didn&#39;t know how well Brent remembered, as Brent was younger than Charlie by a few years. It had been rather contentious and perhaps ugly, and considering that shi had been groped by hir own father before he realized the Kat he was groping was his soughter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Brent, why don&#39;t you get the others,&quot; Charlie spoke, &quot;we&#39;ll let Dad meet the rest of his family and perhaps some of our friends here...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Brent nodded, &quot;Kila, can you stay here with your Auncle?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, momma,&quot; Kila answered.<br />
<br />
With that, Brent turned and headed out.</p>
