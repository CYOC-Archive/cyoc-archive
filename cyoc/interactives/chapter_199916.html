<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I looked back at my old/my little brother&#39;s body what I was stuck as, still having to pretend to be him, looking back at Jason in my little brother’s body smugly smiling at me, I really had no other choice but to say “Fine!” thinking it could be interesting to see how other mothers treat their kids first hand, so I walked out the door and headed down the stars feeling Jasons clothes really well fitting seeing my now dark skin wearing a tank-top and running shorts, being able to see all my arms and legs what had mussels on them now unlike my brothers what look like twigs. <br />
<br />
Once I got down the stars Jason&#39;s mother was right there, I took a gulp not knowing what this is about and how is this going to go and said “yes mom?”  she looked at me and said “Jason, I know you don’t want to go tomorrow, but please hunny, don’t hate me” she was rubbing my shoulder and being very physically affectionate what might seem normal for a mother to do with their son, but this was odd for me, Jasons mom was hot, and I was getting turned on by her being so monthly to me. <br />
<br />
but I was enjoying it Tim could not get tuned on yet and I was enjoying very young hormones, sure, she was my biological mother right now, but my mind is a 16 year old boy whose brother mostly stole your body, so I am going to enjoy the little things, while being stuck going to summer camp, and I thought I&#39;m going to help Jason while having a little fun, so I said “mom, I don’t hate you I just don’t want to leave you alone, I worry about you getting lonely and I want to be the one to look after you” and it worked like a charm, she just said “aaaw.. Come here” giving me a nice tight hug” you shouldn&#39;t worry about me like that, that is my job to care about you, not you me?” God I am loving this I could feel her tits on my chest and feeling the amount of love this woman has for her son it felt even better. <br />
<br />
After another 10s she let go of me and said” well does that me you are ok going to the camp tomorrow?” I just smiled and said “yes mom” in a happy voce, she kissed my head and said “well you better go and entertain your guessed” I just said” ow yer” archly forgetting where I am and that I am in Jasons body, thinking I was in some sort of fantasy and got up and went upstairs. <br />
<br />
When I got back to my room, I steal had a raging boner on this small dick but when I opened the door, I saw Jason in Tims body playing with his dick naked looking frustrated and when he saw me, he looked a little ashamed of what he is doing but said “why is it not working!!!” knowing what he was meaning, but Tim is still too young to masturbate and I have not seen any signs of him trying to do it, so I am going to guess he does not know what it really is so I said “what is not working” and why are you naked in my body?” he looked at me like I could not be serious and said” you know jerk off?” I just looked at him trying to look confused and said “Jer...k off?”  <br />
<br />
He started to get frustrated and came over and stood next to me naked and said “ yer it is like sex but you use your hands to do it yourself” again I made a confused face and said “but sex is when a mom and a dad play with each other in bed?” doing my best to sound like a 10 year old , he laughed a bit and said “god I forget how naive you are, well look you got a hard on now, you lucky having my body” I looked down at his now my dick seeing it was pretty obvious that dick was hard and I said “well what do I do with it, I thought it was something to do with your body?” he repliyed “well you play with it, go and take of them shorts and boxers and go for it, it will be the best thing you will ever do“ I just shrugged and did what he said trying to act naïve. <br />
<br />
So I stood there only now wearing a tank top one hand on my new dick kind of surprised that it is black as well, for some reason thinking it would be white, and started to play with it flapping it around still trying to act naïve, Jason looked embarrassed properly from seeing his body acting/doing such a thing, and said “no no no, not like that!!” so I just said “how”, actually wanting to jerk off now feeling the selectivity from touching the dick not being able to not think of anything but Jasons mom and he said “fine I will show you” with him getting fed up. <br />
<br />
I was quite unsure about this thinking that this is going a little too far but before I could think of anything to stop him his hand was around my dick jerking me off, and all I could say is “oh my god” feeling the most intense feeling I have ever felt not being able to stop panting and feel back on to the bed leaning back using my arms to hold myself a little bit up, and Jason said “good isn&#39;t it”  and for the first time it came off weird hearing my little brothers voce talking to me about sex and knowing that is my little brothers hand around my dick, but I ignored that and new it was realy Jason doing it and said “yer this is amazing” Jason just said back ”I told you, it seems like your body is not ready for such activity&#39;s” with him grabbing his/ my little brothers dick and feeling nothing and  it staying floppy, and he carried on saying “ this is the only time I&#39;m doing this for you, and I want my body back in a bit” all I could say was “faster, please” and he smiled a bit looking at my face seeing how much I am enjoying his body and stated to grip tighter and went faster, and after a minuet of going fall frontal, I felt the build up release and a white stream of liquid squirted out of my dick. <br />
<br />
After that we clead up the mess and Jason wanted to switch back saying that he didn&#39;t mind being taller but he did not like being so skinny and not being able to get a hard on with him saying ”kids get beating up at his age if you can&#39;t get it up yet” with him only being one year older than Tim, but I get how one year can mean a lot of certain stuff at this age, so we swapped and I went from being black small and muscular back to my skinny, tall, long hear, brother, and Jason went back to his old body, and we decided to not mess around with the socks anymore, at least not to night, we talked maybe using them at summer camp for fun, but for the rest of the night we played on Jason&#39;s PlayStation and I fell back in to the role of a 10year old kid, accept Jason made me jerk him off once when we went to bed saying it is only fair, what I could not argue against, playing as my naïve little brother who everybody thinks I am except my dad, and what was nothing wore that me and my dad did or try to do in Tim’s body. <br />
<br />
The next morning Jacon seemed happy that his mom was not badgering him about the summer camp and we got ready and left to the camp buses, with me not wanting to be my little brother still, but who knows I got the socks so that could became anybody at camp, or it actually cold be fun at this age doing who knows what at camp.</p>
