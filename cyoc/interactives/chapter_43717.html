<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You know in a way this is your fault Mr. Howard.  If you hadn't sent me to the library then this wouldn't have happened, at least not today and you could have kept bossing me around.  I'm tired of you, and even though I wish no one else was involved, I'm glad that I get to do this to you.&quot; Dana stretched her wings as far as they could go and covered Mr. Howard in her shadow.  Mr. Howard looked every which way and waved his arms pleading but Astara's spell had his legs frozen to the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please Dana, don't do this. I'm a human being, I make mistakes, can't you forgive me?&quot; Mr. Howard was begging and tears were coming from his eyes even as Dana put her hand on the side of his face.  Mr. Howard was surprised at how soft it felt and an infectious heat that kept his face warm long after Dana pulled away and the heat began to spread and go down his face to his chest.  His heart began to beat a mile a minute and he stopped begging as all thoughts about his life burned away and only lust remained.  Panting, he looked around and his eyes were drawn to the demon in front of him.  Her breasts were larger then any he'd seen before and he longed to fondle them.  Instead of trying to get away, now he was pulling at his clothes and reaching toward Dana's breasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't forgive you, Mr. Howard.  That is an attribute of the divine and now I only have the desire to punish.  Soon you won't be a human being and you won't care about forgiveness.  I've never liked you Mr. Howard and now I can have you all to myself.  I hope you get used to that lust Mr. Howard because you'll never be able to satisfy it.&quot;  Dana's fangs were bared as Mr. Howard had managed to pull his shirt off and was pulling at his pants getting them down as far as he could.  Sweat was running down his face as his skin took a reddish tinge and the smell of smoke began to fill the air.  As one last step, Dana stepped forward and kissed Mr. Howard who responded like a drowning man being given air.  His hands were all over her and his tongue probed her mouth but he screamed when Dana bit that tongue off with her fangs and blood began to spill from his mouth.  Mr. Howard tried to speak but only incoherent sounds came forth.  Sweat was flowing off Mr. Howard like he had been working out for hours and then his sweat stopped and dried in a few moments before his body burst into green flames.  Mr. Howard screamed in pain as his body fell to the ground, released from his paralysis and wouldn't stop.  The black smoke from the flames stayed concentrated over the body and took on form of a nude man with the physique of a body builder and with glowing embers for eyes.  The figure attempted to speak but it could only make a howling noise that caused all the men in the assembly room to get an erection and the women to scream in terror, all the hair on their pussies standing on end.<br />
<br />
Dana looked at the results of her handiwork and she felt her demonic desires sing in satisfaction and Astara's enchantment tried to fill her with an orgasmic joy.  Red rings appeared around the green of her irises and this time they didn't fade as Dana resisted the spell.  Dana could hear Astara's laughter all the while, scornful that Dana would resist the completion of her transformation.  -Oh yes, I made the perfect choice in you.  You will be a perfect steward to my power.  Just accept the power and you won't feel the pain for the pleasure.-  Dana refused, for if she did that then she would be no better then Astara with her mad design to conquer this world.  Dana could think of several other ways to go about this and accomplish this without wasting effort on a single high school.  Realizing where her thoughts were headed she instead diverted them to why Astara wanted this change to occur.  Dana wasn't sure how, but she could guess that Astara would become even more powerful if Dana were to give up.  Then Dana could play all sorts of fun games with the pitiful mortals.  Dana looked at the dead blonde that Astara had impaled, Dana had seen the girl in the halls before and had even been in a class with her though she couldn't remember her name.  The blond had always been opinionated and tried to pick fights with the teachers but she had gotten over her head when she challenged Astara.  Dana would have to be devious if she hoped to come out of this on top.<br />
<br />
Returning her attention back to the shade of Mr. Howard she said, &quot;From now on you are smoke and cannot interact with the world even though you lust for everyone here.  You will be my spy and if I like what you do then I'll do this.&quot;  Dana grabbed the shadow creature's dick and began massaging it.  The shade jerked around but its penis didn't move.  When Dana stopped the shade gave another howl which Dana took to mean assent.  &quot;Excellent, Astara, I leave the rest to you unless you wish to gift me with another?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You forget yourself Dana, the shade is mine.  Just as you are or should I remind you of the fact?&quot; Dana slyly smiled, &quot;That won't be necessary.&quot;<br />
<br />
Glad that the matter had been settled Astara decided to change the art teacher, Ms. Holmes next.  &quot;Please no!&quot;  Astara placed her middle finger over Ms. Holmes left eye, &quot;Well since you said please.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Astara's claw cut into Ms. Holmes face carving a vicious wound from the crown of her head to the edge of her chin.  Blood flowed freely from the wound and stained the side of her face red.  Dana watched in interest as the wound stopped bleeding and scarred over leaving mangled tissue and her left eye had turned completely black.  Ms. Holmes' pudgy body then began to ripple like water as she gained the body of a 17-year old boy's fantasy.  Her hair was a glistening blond that went all the way down to her back and her waist shrank and her butt gained definition.  Her pear shape now an hourglass she saw all the stunned faces looking, as her skin rippled again and her clothes dissolved into her body and her hair turned into a rainbow of color, even the patch on her groin.  Freed from her paralysis, her skin rippled again and her skin turned dark, her face became more Fae like and her hair was snow white as she moved into the crowd of students bending in close and whispering in their ears, her look changing as she went from person to person but the scars on her face always remained.  Most of the boys didn't notice as they were to preoccupied staring at Ms. Holmes new rack.<br />
<br />
Next Astara grabbed the P.E. teacher, Mr. Jeanne.  Knowing there was nothing he could do to change the matter he decided to take it like a man.  Too bad he'll soon be a woman, thought Astara as she slapped him on the chest.  Mr. Jeanne gave a start as a set of boobs grew from his chest and strained against his buttoned up shirt.  A button blew off revealing his newly acquired cleavage even as he felt his penis soften and being pulled up into him.  Having an average figure before, Mr. Jeanne grunted as she grew three feet in height to become a 8'10&quot; giant of a woman and thick muscles began to grow along the length of her body until the seams on her sleeves and pant legs tore and rags fell to the ground.  Fully changed Ms. Jeanne was quick to get up close to the former principle and his secretary.  Astara figured Ms. Jeanne had made a good choice since any of the mortals would have been unable to satisfy her.<br />
