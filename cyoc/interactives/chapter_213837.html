<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jim was psyched that he had become friends with Jordan, Steve and Sean. These were all muscle dudes, who wanted nothing more than spend every free moment outside of the classroom in the gym, lifting weights and growing their huge muscles. He had recruited Tristan and Alex, his nerdy friends from the science lab, and he had grown them into muscle nerds, all thanks to the magical ring on his finger. The group had grown a little bit, but Sean had asked him to find some more new members. <br />
<br />
So Jim set out to find new members as he walked around the vast, long hallways of the high school when he heard someone sit down on the bench by the long row of lockers. He turned around and looked on. Unfortunately, it was a girl from his class. Jim was about to walk away, when he heard a quiet sobbing.<br />
<br />
He felt sorry for the girl, so he walked up to her and sat down next to her. <br />
<br />
“Hey, what’s wrong? Why are you crying?” he said quietly. <br />
<br />
The girl, named Cassie, was scrolling through the messages on her cell phone with one hand as she wiped away the tears with a tissue using the other. <br />
<br />
“Oh, hi Jim. I’m just… I just got rejected by the cheerleading squad again.” Cassie sighed. “I’m a new student and I’m just having a hard time fitting in here. I got no friends and nobody seems to like me.” <br />
<br />
Cassie was short and a bit stocky, with long, straight, brown hair and deep, brown eyes. She had a cute face, but she was a little overweight and none of the popular girls wanted to talk to her. She was only 16, but she had no friends in school. <br />
<br />
“Oh, man… I’m sorry to hear that. I wonder what I can do to help you?” Jim wondered out loud. <br />
<br />
“Boys have it so easy. Guys help each other out to get in shape and to play sports. It’s not that way with girls. Either they like you or they hate you. If you’re not part of the group, then you’re just out of luck. The popular girls don’t want to talk to me. I’m the outcast here.” She sobbed. “I wish I were a tall, handsome guy. You guys have it so much easier. You go to the gym and boom! Problems solved!” <br />
<br />
“Uhh… I just joined a club for muscle guys… I know what you’re talking about, Cassie…” <br />
<br />
“Yeah, but I’m a girl! I bet you only want guys in that club!” she sighed. “I’m such a loser!”<br />
<br />
“No, you’re not! I bet you’d make a great, tall, handsome muscle guy! Big, tall and muscular!” Jim grinned. “Just go into the locker room, and you’ll see!” <br />
<br />
Cassie stood up and wandered into the women’s locker room, which was right down the hall from where they were sitting. Luckily, there was nobody else at school, so no one would see what was about to happen to the girl.<br />
<br />
As soon as Cassie entered the locker room, she was overcome by a strange, intense tingling sensation. Her short, stocky legs began to bulge with muscle everywhere, growing longer and thicker as layers of thick muscle began to form where her quads and calves were. Her quads grew thicker and wider, making her panties and shorts feel painfully tight. She quickly pulled all her clothes off, leaving her standing naked in the locker room, before the large mirror, where she observed the strange transformation as her body continued to change before her very eyes. <br />
<br />
After she had grown over a foot taller, to almost six-foot-four inches tall, she noticed how she began to gain more muscle on her arms and on her torso. Her feminine features slowly disappeared, as he breasts deflated and disappeared, leaving her staring at large, solid pectorals instead. Her torso now sported a well-defined sixpack of muscular abdominal muscles while her shoulders continued to widen, thanks to growing delts, traps and lats. Her backside grew as well, with mounds of muscle forming everywhere. Her long, brown hair shortened and began to look more like the hair style for a teenage boy. <br />
<br />
Her thin, short arms grew longer and thicker as big, solid biceps and triceps formed, completely covered in long, deep veins. She felt a surge in strength in her arms, causing her to make fists and flex, causing her biceps to swell up in full glory. She flexed the same way she had seen the boys do that during PE class. In fact, she had become more like them now. She was becoming more like a teenage boy with every passing second. <br />
<br />
Cassie’s nail polish faded from her nails and her lipstick disappeared from her lips. Her face became more masculine as her jawline became straighter. A thin coating of hair formed across her chest, on her armpits and around her groin area as one more part of her body changed as she looked down.<br />
<br />
Cassie’s vagina sealed up and faded away as a stubble appeared at the front center of her groin. Two testicles formed as well, which hung from the base of the growing penis, which grew longer and thicker until it was about nine inches long. She was officially a boy, now. A tall, muscular boy, with short, brown hair and brown eyes and plenty of muscle to go around. Standing six-foot-four, the young man, now named Casey, saw new clothes appear over his bigger body. He was wearing shorts, underwear, a tank top and high tops over white, athletic socks. He looked like a gym rat!<br />
<br />
Casey wandered out of the women’s locker room, only to be greeted by Jim. Jim rose to his feet when he realized how the shy girl had changed into the big, towering muscle boy. <br />
<br />
“You look awesome!” Jim smiled, looking up at the big dude. “They’ll love having you at the muscle club!” <br />
<br />
“Thanks! I feel so… different! I can’t imagine how quickly I changed into a guy! This is incredible!” Casey smiled, looking down at his big, buff physique. His voice was deep and baritone now. He was like a big, handsome young man. <br />
<br />
“Let’s go to the gym! The guys are waiting to meet you, big guy!” Jim grinned, as he led the newest member of the muscle boy club to the gym.</p>
