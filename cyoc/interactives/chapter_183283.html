<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Man, your ass is amazing, you know that? It is smooth as butter when I thrust into it, but is still tight as hell somehow too. You slide as if your hoke is super loose, but the second I stop moving you, you seem to just  stick in place like glue.&quot; Commented your GF as he continues to piston in and out of your ass as fast as he can. <br />
<br />
At the moment, you are laying down on your stomach on the bed and he is standing behind you with his large hands on your somewhat shapley hips. Your ass is sticking slightly upwards in the air due to his height being just that tall. He is at least 6 and a half foot tall, while you may not even be breaking 5 foot now. All you have to go off of is that when standing, he can rest his chin down on your head and your toes still hang about just above his ankles, when pointed downwards.<br />
<br />
You do not want to admit it, but ever since you came that first time, you have been thourally enjoying the feeling of his cock. Perhaps he could tell, as he has seemingly put a lot more focus into how he is using it too. Now instead of jumping, thrusting, or pushing you up and letting gravity do the work, he now is in control of every detail. You are so glad you can bury your face in the bed, as you are certain that you do not want him to see your face right now or hear you moaning like a bitch.<br />
<br />
You cum for the third time now, still fully flaccid, and feel your ass start to balloon outwards even more, giving you quite the booty. The pitch of your voice is also very slowly getting higher as time goes on too. Then your ass suddenly starts stinging as you feel and hear the slap your GF just gave your new ass. It feels too good. So good in fact that you actually cum again. You do not even know how you can cum  twice in under a minute, but somehow you just did.<br />
<br />
This time your torso narrows out, while your waist tucks in slightly in the front while your hips actually expand outwards slightly, giving you what would be considered a really nice figure, if you were a girl that is. &quot;Wow, your getting hotter by the minute, aren&#39;t ya.&quot; He comments from behind you, slapping your ass again. You do not cum this time, but are sure as hell close to it.<br />
<br />
Your GF starts to trace around your donut with his finger, sending what feels like electricity through your body, and causing you to arch your back in pleasure. That donut is the most sensitive place on your body at the moment, and he fully knows it. As he keeps circling around it, you no longer can stop yourself from moaning. &quot;MMMMMmmmmphfffff!&quot; You moan as you try covering your mouth in a bad attempt at stifling it. For one, your hands are far to small and delicate now to properly do it, but also, it would have been a loud moan, as you really just wanted to let it all out and scream in pleasure. There was no longer any pain, just pure blissful pleasure. You were just too embarrassed to do so.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh? That was a cute noise. Let me hear some more!&quot; Your GF demands as she grabs both of your wrists and pulls both of your arms straight backwards. Now with no way to stop it, and honestly no more reason to not either, you just let loose. <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s it, moan for me!&quot; Commands your GF. His powerful, domineering voice is turning you one even more, as you cum yet again. This time, it is your shoulders that change, narrowing inwards, along with your neck thinning slightly, and growing a bit longer. Your Adam&#39;s apple also is no where to be seen either. <br />
<br />
At this point, a good wig and some makeup would be more than enough to pass you off as a girl. Your voice, while not feminine, is not masculine either, and the higher pitch is making it lean more towards feminine sounding.<br />
<br />
You feel your GF&#39;s hands on your hips turn you over. He grabs your left calf and lifts your slender leg above his head as he flips you over to face him. &quot;Woah, that&#39;s not the face I was expecting to see.... But... I am not really complaining either, I guess. It fits this new body a lot better than your old one would have.&quot; He says. This was not the interaction you were expecting. &quot;Huh, what do you mean? Describe it to me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh, well. For starters, you won&#39;t have any issues passing for a girl, even without makeup or a wig. But I guess I am just a bit irritated that your face is prettier than how mine was before I looked like this. Your not wearing makeup and have really great lashes already. Um, your face is narrower, but cuter. Your eyes are slightly bigger, and your eye color turned to green.  I don&#39;t know, your just really cute looking.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I am still a guy right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Honestly, it is gonna be a really tough sell on that one. Your looks scream girl. And besides your baby carrot of a dick, your basically are one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I dont have boobs either.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not every girl has them big. Some are really flat chested. Plus, I am kind of thinking that somehow your asshole is doubling as your pussy. I mean, what ass self lubricates? Plus, you know that time a few minutes ago when I made you cum after hitting something in your ass? Yeah, I am pretty sure that was not your prostate, since I tried to poke it again, and ended up passing right through it. My guess is that it was your cervix or something. It&#39;s like your pussy and ass are sharing the same space maybe. I don&#39;t know for sure, but that is my guess. Unless you know exactly what kind of secret fantasy of yours that we are currently playing out?&quot; Your GF countered. <br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think I have a fantasy for this though... at least I can&#39;t remember having one. So I don&#39;t even know myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then why do you care so much? Just enjoy it, it&#39;s your fantasy afterall.&quot; He says to you, and then to stop you from replying, he kisses you. You suddenly realize that your GF has control over her body again, and yet you still do not. And somehow you manage to have another orgasm, cumming yet again, but oddly, no apparent changes occured to you.<br />
<br />
You cant do anything as you are forced to experience your body start making out with your hot boyfriend. Which as if to insult you, makes your chest push out a small bit, giving you unquestionable tits. They are small, maybe B-cups, if being generous. You kind of wish they were a bit bigger if you are going to have them anyways. <br />
<br />
You feel your body begin to play with your new boobs while you are still making out with your boyfriend. They are very sensitive, but nothing compares to you donut of an asshole in that reguard. They are definitely your new boobs though.<br />
<br />
Your boyfriend then cups your ass cheeks and lifts you up, nearly pulling out of you, if not for the ring&#39;s prevention. Your body wraps your legs around his back and you continue to kiss him. Not he continues to kiss you. Your body has definitely taken over the leading role in this. Your boyfriend breaks off the kiss and looks at you. &quot;Oh just accept this already. So what if you become a girl? Or a guy with a girl&#39;s body and the remnants of his dick? We can undo this all later anyways. Come on. This would be so much more enjoyable if you were able to act out your own will as well. Please just do it.&quot; He begs you.</p>
