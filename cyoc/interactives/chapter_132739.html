<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next morning as you found something to get dressed in you decided to look at your body a little more closely. You didn&#39;t have a lot of hair on you... maybe if you trimmed your whiskers and wore a hat you could pass as a short woman... Then you thought back to how uncomfortable it was to sit at the dinner table, and that you probably wouldn&#39;t want to stay on two legs all the time... which wouldn&#39;t be very human. Then there were your nails which now were just retractable claws. Was a little neat flexing them in and out a  little bit, and most of the extra hair was more around the head and tail. Then again there was also the fact that while your budding breasts had shrunk a bit now you had 3 times the number of nipples. You sigh and put on some of your more kid clothes. That was another thing hard to get used to, the fact that everything looked so big again. You tried getting more used to the movements of your body, but the way it felt natural was just very different for you. <br />
<br />
Your mother had come back home in the after noon with some  new clothes for your body, and some fast food.  Looking through them there were a bunch of long dresses. Your mother  said &quot;There wasn&#39;t a  lot. Not a lot of non-humans around.  A dress or skirts would make the most sense though right? Your tail would be a bit tricky to design for... I got your favorite hamburger though!&quot; You went to go start eating the fast food when with the first bite the burger was a lot less appetizing then you remembered. The meat tasted great, but the buns and  other condiments were a little less than amazing. There was a ring at the doorbell. You heard your mother say &quot;Oh, Sara and Nora! What a surprise what brings you here?&quot; <br />
<br />
Sara said &quot;We were coming to bring some hand outs from class. Is Anna doing alright?&quot; <br />
<br />
Your mother said &quot;She&#39;s doing... fine... Mind if I go check on her for a second?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nora said &quot;If you need to check on her to see whether we can visit we can come back another time.&quot; <br />
<br />
Your mother said &quot;No No... it&#39;s not that sort of thing i&#39;m worried about. You&#39;ll probably see at some point. Just please give me a second.&quot; then your mother left and got to the kitchen where you had made only a little progress on your burger. Your mother asked &quot;Anna, I know this is a bit strange for you, but why not have Sara and Nora see? They&#39;ll find out eventually and this could help you get back into school.&quot; <br />
<br />
There was a part of you saying &quot;No please! I can turn back into a human I swear!&quot; however most of you knew this was permanent and said &quot;Sure. Wasn&#39;t the most hungry anyways.&quot; <br />
<br />
Your mother brought them inside to the living room where you were sitting down with a hat on. Sara said &quot;Anna you look... are those whiskers?&quot; <br />
<br />
You nodded and took off your hat showing your ears and said &quot;umm... Those headaches were kind of a side affect of this... whole thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nora looked quizzically and asked &quot;So your headaches caused you to turn into  part cat?&quot; <br />
<br />
You thought about how much to tell them and  said &quot;Well... Turns out I was adopted in a way! It was less me turning into this and more this turning into a human...&quot; <br />
<br />
Sara going towards you pulled on your ear to see if it was real and you started to hiss at the pain. Sara said &quot;yep those are real all right... So you were always a cat person?&quot; You nodded, and Sara saw the burger you were eating and said &quot;Well you really don&#39;t know much about your diet. Cat people tend to be mostly carnivorous with some occasional fruit here and there. No wonder you weren&#39;t really digging into that burger...&quot; she then started looking at your arm and said &quot;And your skin is so smooth and hairless... Man Anna you must be some pure bred or something. You must be worth a fortune at least.&quot;<br />
<br />
You pulled your arm away and said &quot;Your not selling me.&quot; <br />
<br />
Sara said &quot;I know not selling, but I know this cute cat boy that you may be interested in.&quot;<br />
<br />
You said &quot;Your not selling my children either.&quot; <br />
<br />
Nora slapped Sara on her head and said &quot;Seriously though Anna. Your kind don&#39;t exactly have a ton of rights. I&#39;m not sure how the school will react and maybe opening yourself up to being a career pet could-&quot; <br />
<br />
You  mother said &quot;She&#39;s not going to be a pet!&quot; <br />
<br />
Nora said &quot;Well career pet...  More akin to a housewife in some ways. Considering where we are and how hard it would probably be for her to find a well paying job.&quot; <br />
<br />
Your mother said &quot;Your a little too young to be worried about jobs. aren&#39;t you?&quot; <br />
<br />
Sara thought then said &quot;Actually here&#39;s an interesting idea! I&#39;m going to go visit some relatives again, the one&#39;s with the cat boy! If  Anna feels good enough she could come along, we could get some better supplies, and she could socialize with more of her own kind!&quot; <br />
<br />
A couple of weeks later you were on a plane with Sara. It took some hassle to get you a seat, and now you were on a leash because of laws. However you were going to be visiting some of Sara&#39;s relatives while you figured out who you were and what exactly you would do with your life... Especially since you were kind of expelled. When you landed...</p>
