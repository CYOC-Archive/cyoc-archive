<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After arriving home she logical decided that it would be best to test a few of the other settings to see what they did.  She took her books out of her bag, and hid the gun inside it to keep people from noticing as easily, and headed towards the park to test a few settings, however what she failed to notice was that her little sister Jill had decided to follow her as she often did to spy on her older sister.  Jill unlike her sister was a spoiled rotten 9 year old who wanted everything, and god save you if you got in her way, but back to Sue.<br />
At the park Sue found a nice bench to sit on that was reletively off to the side and was pondering her first move.  She decided to go with a random change and closed her eyes and spun the dial around a bit, it stopped on body hair.  Being a good sport and knowing she could just as easily reverse it she went along with it, though she was not too keen on the idea.  She thought it at least a good idea to use another person of the same gender at least and aimed it at a random jogger.  At first her whole body tingled a bit, and she itched a bit in a few places, but after about a minuet she still didnt see any differences, which was fine with her so she went with another one after stoping to scratch a slight itch in her armpit.  With that she decided that the body hari one wasnt very noticable, what she didnt know was it treated it as she had shaved all the hair off in the places she had shaved before just now there was a lot more, she would find out latter that night when she goes to take her shower, removes her panties, and sees the one place she never botherd shaving yet as she realy didnt need to only being 14, as for the random jogger she would be happy to know the treatments she was taking to get rid of most of her body hair in time for summer had worked after only the first one and will be happy to not see it back again.<br />
Back with Sue as she decided to try another of the more interesting options to her brains.  She looked around and found her target, one of the seniors in her school who was known to be smart, but never used it due to being extreamly rich and having almost all the boys wrapped around her finger.  Sue figured she wouldnt miss much for the short bit of time she intended on just testing the gun after all not keeping anything she was too nice for that.  She fired the gun and at first didnt notice much, but then she tried to think about one of her classes she was having a bit of trouble in to test if it worked.  Sue was never very good in math, yet as she sat there thinking about the stuff they were doing in class that day she relised it was all very simple, and eventualy without realizing it she started formulating things from classes way above hers.  As she came out of her daze she relised she had still been holding the trigger down, she looked at the other girl who at this point had a very perplexed look on her face and was having issues remembering who she was let alone what 1+1 is.  Sue reversed the gun and returned the other girl to her normal state, or at least mostly.<br />
At this time Jill was getting bored of spying on her sister she just seemed to be sitting in the park and was about to go home when she saw something very interesting, Sue deciding to try something a bit more brave and go for something a bit more noticable she set the devise to breast to se if i acctualy did what she thought it would do and pointed it at a sleeping girl she knew was on the cheerleading team.  At first it was barely noticeable that the other girl's bra was getting looser, but as Jill and Sue noticed Sue's almost nonexistent chest was definetly getting bigger it was at this time Jill first noticed the gun like thing in her sister was concealing and that she was pointing it at the cheerleader.  About the time Sue reached a large B that was starting to strain at her bra she flipped the gun and set everything back to the way it was, she had enjoyed that test quite a bit and was almost reluctant to go back to normal.  She was almost ready to go back home, but decided to try the height option again since she knew what it was like to shrink, she wanted to try the other way.  She aimed at the cheerleader again and started growing slowly, she reached about 6 and a half feet and stood up for a second to see what it was like before returning to normal again, and decided she rather enjoyed being taller though probably not this tall.  She returned to her normal height of 5 foot 4 and put the gun away, then decided to just sit around a bit and enjoy the day before heading home as it was getting late, her sister on the other hand was extreamely excited as she had just seen her older sister use the gun and rushed home so as not to get caught spying, as well as to plan her way to get that gun so she could have anything she wanted from people, maybe even show her sister whats it is like to be bossed around by an older sister(doesnt matter if she was just usualy trying to keep her out of trouble)</p>
