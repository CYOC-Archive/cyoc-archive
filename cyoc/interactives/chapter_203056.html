<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rusty and Lenny shifted and changed, fat melting off their bodies and a rather large part of Troy sincerely missed it. All that hard work of eating down the drain. He shook off the thoughts that intruded without his permission. They didn’t sound like him, really. Almost like someone with a voice synthesizer tuned to his subconscious was whispering in his ear.<br />
<br />
Lenny’s big bear apron pulled up and solidified into a proper muscle-gut, his flabby arms and legs melting away, revealing slabs of hard muscle, covered in only a light layer of chub. Rusty himself was the biggest change-fat sliding away, muscle resurfacing, beard falling out. Troy gave a small sigh of relief. Now to get the Book to him.<br />
<br />
Troy walked in. Rusty glanced up and gave a hard look from the Book to him. Troy nodded and gestured to Rusty to come outside. Rusty excused himself and met Troy at the door.<br />
<br />
“What did you change?” Rusty whispered.<br />
<br />
“Reality cascade from when you changed me. We turned into fat nerds.” Troy whispered back and handed him the book. “Now fix me before I lose myself and we all get fucked.”<br />
<br />
Rusty nodded. “Erm, sorry babe, but, what did you look like before?”<br />
<br />
“Athletic, less muscular than you, with a great ass. A muscular one. You can tone it down a bit, though. Last time you managed to give me a ridiculous keister.”<br />
<br />
“So…bubble-butt. Got it.” Rusty nodded. “Hurry, I think you’re actually getting fatter.”<br />
<br />
Troy nodded and hurried inside, turning up the volume of the stereo as he did. He walked over to where Lenny sat. Lenny hurriedly pitched the game he and Rusty had been playing to him. Rusty had no way to actually hear Lenny over the stereo, but judging by his excited gestures and tone, he got the gist of it. He’d known him for years, in this reality anyways. But it was time to get back to business because snacks were appearing on the table next to Troy and he was visibly swelling with every pawful of chips.<br />
<br />
“Alright, one twunk coming up.” Rusty whispered, concentrating on Troy. “Half.”<br />
<br />
Troy slimmed down almost immediately. Rusty frowned. Typically, changing someone couldn’t actually change their body fat percentage. Troy wasn’t even sporting his usual potbelly. This was the Book of Beasts, not Body. Something fucky was afoot. As Troy’s wobbly ass firmed and shrunk, Rusty dismissed his concern. He didn’t know the how’s or why’s of the Book, but this seemed to be working.<br />
<br />
“Alright, now to go in an turn the damn music down.” Rusty grumbled to himself. His stomach growled. He patted it in response and…<br />
<br />
It shook. He glanced down at the burgeoning beer gut in horror. “Ah, fuck.”<br />
<br />
And it truly was a beer-gut. He and his bros loved to game and party and all those empty calories had to go somewhere after all. His beer-gut wobbled in response to Rusty’s altering memories and swelled even larger, untucking his shirt. It re-sized, and the plain white tee he’d sported to show off his muscles began to shift to green with a mushroom logo on it. That was the 1-up icon from the game with the plumbers, totally old-school. His breasts swelled and sagged with fat onto the rather hefty gut he sported. <br />
<br />
Rusty desperately stopped thinking, shutting his eyes. Why was he getting fatter? They’d altered reality back and fixed the problem. This was worse. Faster. Last time he’d changed it had taken literal hours.<br />
<br />
A *pop* behind him made his heart freeze, he slowly turned around and opened his eyes. Where once stood Rusty’s Bustang and Lenny’s Dualie flatbed was parked a beat-up old van. He could see the wrappers from fast food trips piled up on the dash. Cold horror dawned on him then. They’d lost their police jobs in this new reality. Somehow, he’d made everything worse!<br />
<br />
“Oh God, I’m poor now?” Rusty whimpered. As if in response the rust on the van spread visibly and a small crack ripped across the windshield. Rusty grimaced. There really was someone listening. <br />
<br />
“Please, I know you can hear me. Stop….I…I’m sorry for calling Lenny fat. How do I fix this?” Rusty begged, growing jowls wobbling.<br />
<br />
His phone-no longer the top of the line smartphone, just an old flip phone-fell out of his holster as his belly jiggled and swelled, shirt pulling itself up and exposing his billowing gut, dense fur running like a treasure trail up it. Dimly, Rusty wondered how it had fallen out, and realized he no longer wore pants with a belt, just a pair of black mesh nylon basketball shorts that smelled like musk that did nothing to hide his love handles and the fat ass that stretched them wide behind him. He was growing so fast reality wasn’t able to shift-his shirt re-sized as he thought of it, but didn’t quite reach all the way past his gut, leaving a good inch of hair and fat exposed. He tried to pull it down but his belly grew even more. This was like a punishment. <br />
<br />
As he struggled with his ill-fitting outfit, he noticed the phone had flipped open and saw the photo it displayed there.<br />
<br />
It was the photo of RK he’d secretly taken a day ago, at the party. He’d had his suspicions about him and ran him through the database and found he-he-<br />
<br />
Rusty paused. <br />
<br />
His mind was running into a brick wall as he struggled to remember what he’d found, because he no longer ever worked as a police officer. He glanced through the window and grimaced. Troy and Lenny were groping each other’s growing fat, fondling each other and frotting. Garbage was piled around them-empty takeout cartons, pizza boxes, empty ice cream containers. The futon was folded out and Lenny’s stuff was laid out on it. Lenny lived with them, in this reality.<br />
<br />
Desperate, he picked up the phone and speed dialed the number RK had left them. He really hadn’t wanted to do it but desperate times called for desperate measures and all that.<br />
<br />
“I knew you’d call, Rusty. How’s it hanging these days butterball, or should I say, porker?” The voice on the other end of the line was cheery.<br />
<br />
Porker? <br />
<br />
Rusty looked at his paws. Or rather, his hooflets. He snorted in surprise and looked in the window. Lenny and Troy had shifted again. Troy’s feline face had shed most of his beautiful fur, leaving behind bristles and an upturned snout. Lenny was almost fully a boar, tusks curling out the bottom of his mouth as they continued to grope each other’s flab and oink. It made his own penis stiffen and unfurl. <br />
<br />
Wait, unfurl? He snorted and shook the thoughts away, suddenly aware of his own growing tusks. Not just fat nerds. Pigs. Boarmen. <br />
<br />
“Are you doing this?” Rusty grunted, snout snuffling.<br />
<br />
“Nope, read the future. I’m afraid this is what happens when you fuck with reality. He fucks back.”<br />
<br />
“He? Tho there’th really thomeone.” He paused, wiped the drool away, tried to find away to work his muzzle around his jutting tusks. “Wait, no, I don’t care right now. How do I make it thtop?” <br />
<br />
Rusty tried desperately not to think about his clothes pulling tighter on his fattening form, now always just a size too small. His tail, his wonderful waggy tail, shrunk and twisted and bristled as it warped into a boar’s tail. He could see his own reflection in the window and the sight of the bristly, ugly pigman staring back terrified him. Although he was fond of the new Mohawk he was sporting, it made him look kinda tough despite the fat…<br />
<br />
“Hey, focus!” RK snapped. “That’s the Auditor whispering in your ear. Ignore him.”<br />
<br />
Rusty nodded and tried to concentrate, ignore his growing contentedness with his new form. It was feeling less horrifying and more…natural. Even his overly tight clothes made him feel a little hot under the collar, like it was his choice. He wore the weight well, why not show off a little? <br />
<br />
That thought, he realized, hadn’t come from him. The voice hadn&#39;t stopped, if anything, its whispers grew more urgent. How happy he&#39;d be just sucking and fucking with his nerdy bros and eating whatever he wanted. He loved cooking after all, he&#39;d gone to culinary school. Multiple *pops* sounded from the kitchen and a chef&#39;s coat, covered in food stains, appeared there. New utensils and a sous vide machine appeared on his counters. Even the garbage and some of the dirty laundry disappeared and the cartons and pizza boxes were replaced with plates heaped with food he&#39;d cooked, the new reality shifts making it much more tolerable and appealing.<br />
<br />
Rusty&#39;s mouth watered,  jowls quivering as his memories as a professional chef filled in. He really did love food. At that unspoken declaration, his fur shed and bristled  across his body, his gut surged forward a bit more, now almost to his knees. The van behind him shifted, cleaning up, becoming more like a food delivery service, one that brought hot plates of food to workers in offices across the city. The voice kept whispering, promising him that he wouldn&#39;t need to worry about the Book, it would take it and give it to someone else, he&#39;d never worry about anything again, he could just have fun and relax into his hedonist lifestyle. <br />
<br />
Rusty almost broke then, his curly cock pulsing pre into his shorts as images of him and his bros just hanging out and relaxing all day after he got home from work, endless days of video games and BattleAnvil dancing in his head. He knew he was close to the end, his body wobbling with layers of swelling chub, and his chin bristling into a short beard that didn&#39;t hide the prominent swell of fat dangling below it. <br />
<br />
But it was also a trap, a reality trap he could literally feel caging him in. And he wasn&#39;t the kind of guy who fell for the same trap twice.<br />
<br />
Rusty ground his teeth and shut out the voice in his head.<br />
<br />
“I’m…I’m fine. I can thorta tell when it ithn’t my thoughtth.” Rusty snuffled.<br />
<br />
“Look, I can explain everything to you, but right now you have a minute before the Auditor finishes you off. If you want to be a smokin’ hot puppy dog, do exactly what I say and think only what I tell you to think. You need to alter Lenny first or it all breaks again. Most importantly is what I’m going to tell you to change, so listen close.”<br />
<br />
Rusty listened.<br />
<br />
___________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
“You’re lucky I’m a good boyfriend, you know,” Rusty commented as he walked in. <br />
<br />
Troy glanced over at the anthro German Shepherd, muscular, trimmed fur, and then down at Lenny-no, didn’t he like to be called Leonard? Leonard’s huge bear paw was rubbing his potbelly. Why was he doing that? Even Leonard seemed confused and pulled away from him.<br />
<br />
“Ten seconds away from being done for.” Rusty glared at Leonard. “Aren’t you married, pal?”<br />
<br />
Leonard grimaced and shifted away, back to his seat. The bear was a power lifter and looked it. Sure, he had a gut, but it was more a muscle gut than anything. The rest of him was built like a brick shithouse. It made Troy swoon. But now Leonard was looking at the gold band on his thick finger, ears flattened in shame.<br />
<br />
“I-yeah, I am, but…” Leonard glanced up at Troy and whispered. “He’s hot.”<br />
<br />
Rusty smirked. “That’s perfect. Glad to hear it. Still got those little items?”<br />
<br />
If bears could blush, Leonard would be beat red. But he had fur. “Y-yes.”<br />
<br />
Troy glanced between the two, took Rusty by the elbow and bustled him outside. “Okay, you used the book. Why and what happened?”<br />
<br />
Rusty sighed. “If I hadn’t, we’d all be a bunch of fat nerds jerking each other off. I turned you back, but I could feel myself shifting again. You two were getting fat again too. Then I remembered something.”<br />
<br />
“What?” Troy asked.<br />
<br />
“He was married. His wife and kids were outside our range. That was too much for reality and…bro, I think something tried to, like, audit us.” Rusty finished, keeping the conversation he’d had to himself. <br />
<br />
“Something like..what?”<br />
<br />
“God. Or some low-level reality manager. Probably the latter.”<br />
<br />
“Come on, God? Why-you aren’t even religious!” Troy was flabbergasted.<br />
<br />
“I felt it. It was like someone was in my head-someone else, not just my new personality or whatever, but someone listening and actively responding. Manipulating my own thoughts. For some reason, being a group of fat nerds was the fix. If we’d let it happen, some other guy would be her husband and….I mean, that would be that.”<br />
<br />
“His wife and kids had a husband, a gap in reality….so reality filled it in. Or tried to, anyways. Do I have that right?”<br />
<br />
Rusty nodded. “We’re damn lucky he wasn’t popped into existence before you changed us back. There wouldn’t be any gap left, even the book wouldn’t have saved us. I guess it takes a while to create a new human being whole-sale.”<br />
<br />
“Why not just have an old flame pop up? Easier fix. We wouldn’t even realize what had happened, we’d just be…fat nerds.”<br />
<br />
“Because it got off on it. Our slow change Whatever it was, we’d amused it. You heard it whispering.”<br />
<br />
Troy nodded. “A perverted…angel or something. I was worried we were under attack by someone with the Book of Body or Mind or maybe both.”<br />
<br />
They stared into the distance together, deep in thought, for what felt like five minutes. Rusty spoke first.<br />
<br />
“We can’t use reality warping spells anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
Troy glanced at him. &quot;Oh? Are you sure?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t be a smartass. I&#39;ve learned my lesson.&quot; Rusty growled. &quot;Nearly had a darn heartattack when I saw the beerbelly coming back. But you know, I really should have listened to your concerns because you&#39;re right about one thing. We’re way too fucking lax when spell users that can alter reality and change our thoughts are running around. We should black out our windows. Just to be safe.” Rusty stated. <br />
<br />
Troy nodded. “That&#39;s good, but still. Angels? Really?”<br />
<br />
“It’s a contest to see who gets to be God. Of course someone’s watching. Someone with a dirty mind and a mean streak to boot. I think.”<br />
<br />
“A mean streak. You hated fat guys and nerds.” Troy said slowly, “So this Reality Auditor or whatever-”<br />
<br />
“Changed me into that for yucks.”<br />
<br />
“It was a warning, too.” Troy continued. “Like I said, he could have done that AND screwed us over at the last minute.”<br />
<br />
“Whoever it was set it into motion but didn’t interfere when we course corrected.” Rusty nodded. “Or maybe they couldn’t interfere. We’d given them an opening and they audited us but we closed the loophole before it was completed. Either way, we need to be real fucking careful, because near the end it sounded desperate.”<br />
<br />
“Alright, no more reality shifts. But there’s something else I wanted to ask.  Last thing I remember, you said you were on board with RK’s plan.”<br />
<br />
“Because I turned into a fat useless pussy. I won’t fuck up like that again, I promise.” Rusty growled.<br />
<br />
“I believe you babe,&quot; Troy held up his paws and glanced through the window at Leonard. &quot;Are we…still fucking him then?”<br />
<br />
Rusty smirked. “Of fucking course. And he’s a closeted bisexual now.”<br />
<br />
“How the fuck are you pulling this stuff off? You shouldn’t be able to do things like that.” Troy huffed. “I certainly can’t do it.”<br />
<br />
“I’m better at manipulating reality than you are, I guess.” Rusty shrugged. “I am exhausted though. Casting spells takes a lot out of you.” Rusty handed Troy the book. “Take care of it and keep it away from Leonard. He’ll do something stupid if you don’t.”<br />
<br />
“Okay, fine….” Troy paused. “You act like you know that for certain. Did you call someone?”<br />
<br />
“I have no idea-”<br />
<br />
“You did! It was RK, right? I bet you asked how to do all that shit. And you’re still turning him down?”<br />
<br />
“I did what I had to, okay?” Rusty rolled his eyes. “I’m not ashamed of asking for help. I didn’t want to end up a furry fatso. Nothing I was doing was working to stop us from turning into butterballs. He gave me some advice, that’s all.”<br />
<br />
“I see.” Troy smiled.<br />
<br />
“Also, for real, don’t let that fucking bear near the book. RK warned me about that. He gets that book and we are super fucked.” Rusty warned.<br />
<br />
“Details?”<br />
<br />
“Reality audit, but we all end up in a zoo.” Rusty nodded at Troy’s questioning glance at Leonard, who was setting up plates for dinner. “Yes, he fucks up that badly.”<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
They ate dinner with gusto, feeling absolutely famished and exhausted. Lenny…Leonard and Troy chatted happily. Rusty kept a careful eye on them, his experience with the Auditors leaving him weary. No weight gain so far. No fat porkers snuffling down chips and playing with each other’s dicks. A normal life. <br />
<br />
RK had actually delivered on his promise. But Rusty now owed him for saving them from a flabby future. ‘Three favors for three lives’. Rusty ground his teeth. He hadn’t trusted the fucker and now he was indebted to him.<br />
<br />
“Are you okay?”  Troy asked as he cleaned off the table.<br />
<br />
Rusty shook his head. “We were close to losing ourselves. Real fucking close.”<br />
<br />
Troy rubbed his arm. “Don’t be too shook up over it. Either way, we’d all be together, right?”<br />
<br />
Rusty pondered that for a moment. “Yeah. No. Maybe. It felt like losing. And I hate losing, Troy. It’s the worst feeling in the world.”<br />
<br />
“You lose all the time in WarAnvil.” Lenny called from the couch.<br />
<br />
“Because 5th Edition rules fucking suck!” Rusty barked back.<br />
<br />
“Cope and seethe, bitch.” Lenny snorted. <br />
<br />
Troy patted Rusty on the back. “Git gud scrub.”<br />
<br />
Rusty smiled and pinched Troy’s ass. “Ready to take a bear from behind?”<br />
<br />
“Fuck yes.” Troy giggled. “Does he know?”<br />
<br />
“Know what?’ Lenny called.<br />
<br />
“Stop eavesdropping, ass.” Rusty barked and made his way to the living room.<br />
<br />
Rusty came to a stop in front of Lenny and lifted him up. Lenny balked, the big bear almost shying away from Rusty’s touch. The German Shepherd smirked and dug around in Lenny’s shorts.<br />
<br />
“There, there.” Rusty cooed. “Just taking off that cock cage.”<br />
<br />
There was a *click* and Rusty pulled the device carefully out of the Bear’s pants. Lenny gripped Rusty’s muscled arm and whimpered as the cage finally set him free. Rusty leaned around the bear’s muscle-gut and rummage around his ass for the butt-plug, Lenny’s short tail flicking wildly. A *plop* sound happened and Rusty pulled the plug. Lenny’s pants fell to the floor.<br />
<br />
“How’s it feel?” Rusty whispered.<br />
<br />
“E-empty?” Lenny replied<br />
<br />
“Perfect.” Rusty smirked. “Go wash yourself out.”<br />
<br />
Lenny nodded and hurried to the bathroom just as Troy exited. They bumped into each other and Troy laid a hand on Lenny’s muscle-gut to steady him.<br />
<br />
“Whoa there big guy,” Troy said, staring up into Lenny’s green eyes.<br />
<br />
Lenny stared back, meeting the tigerman’s gaze and unable to look away. “Sorry.”<br />
<br />
Troy smirked and smacked Lenny’s wide ass, making him jump. “You’ll be making it up to me later.”<br />
<br />
Lenny shot him a confused look and walked into the bathroom. Troy went into the living room, closed the curtains, and then he and Rusty waited, naked and stroking their cocks, for Lenny to come out. The bear finished, toilet flushing and came to a halt.<br />
<br />
“Uh.” The bear stuttered.<br />
<br />
“Strip, dumb-ass.” Rusty pointed to the foldout bed, “And get face down and ass up.”<br />
<br />
Lenny struggled to pull his clothes off his massive form. The shorts were too tight for him to properly unbutton them and it popped off. His ears fell. That had been a new pair. His shirt, stretched tightly over his muscle-gut, got easier to remove as he rolled it up and over it, exposing his copper-colored furred belly. <br />
<br />
It was strange to Lenny that he would struggle with simple clothes. Like he hadn’t been a bearman for the last two years…but he shook his head. He’d signed on to the police to qualify for the bear form. His wife didn’t understand….and she hadn’t put out lately. And Rusty….he shared his hobbies and didn’t care if anyone knew he was gay. That confidence had turned Lenny on more than anything, though that big red rocket had certainly helped. But it was Troy-that sexy, perfectly muscled tigerman with a bubble-butt that had really set him off.<br />
<br />
The bear settled into his position on the pull-out bed. “So, uh, am I stretched enough for you, Rusty?”<br />
<br />
From the side table, Lenny heard a *click* and a *whir*, and then cool gel smeared itself between his thick ass cheeks. The bear flinched. A clawed paw covered in the cool gel gently inserted itself into his anus and smeared the lube around Lenny’s hole. The claw bumped something that made him jump.<br />
<br />
“Whoa, what-” Lenny whimpered.<br />
<br />
“Prostate.” Rusty’s voice came from further behind him than he expected. Who was fingering his hole? Troy? But Rusty was supposed to-<br />
<br />
Rusty walked around in front of him, his foot-long dick bobbing gently as he stepped in front of him. The bear’s muzzle twitched and took in the musky scent of horny dog. Rusty grabbed his cock and teased Lenny, rubbing it around his muzzle. Lenny’s mouth watered and he tried to get it in his mouth.<br />
<br />
“You aren’t loose enough for me, but you’re perfect for Troy.” Rusty allowed Lenny to latch onto his dick and suck. “Oh man, you are horny.<br />
<br />
Lenny nodded or, well bobbed on Rusty’s dick in response with a quiet moan. It had been so long, almost a week. He sucked and lapped the sweet precum off Rusty’s dick and Rusty rewarded him by massaging his head with both paws, firmly forcing him down to the base of his cock, making Lenny choke.<br />
<br />
“We’ll have to work on that gag reflex. Just relax.” Rusty said.<br />
<br />
“Glurk.” Lenny replied.<br />
<br />
“He hasn’t even taken the knot yet.” Lenny heard Troy say behind him.<br />
<br />
The tip of Troy’s cock circled the entrance to his hole. Lenny expected himself to tense but the week-long training had paid off. Troy slid in slowly. Lenny moaned around the engorged dog prig in his mouth as the knobbly barbs of the tigerman’s cock rubbed and stimulated his insides. His own tiny cock hardened into a nub in his fat pad and drooled a constant stream of pre that dribbled onto the bed.<br />
<br />
Troy kept going until the base of his 7 inch cock sunk all the way in to the hilt before he started thrusting. Lenny gasped and Rusty took the opportunity to shove his knot in. Tears streamed down the bear’s face as he was spit-roasted and raw-dogged (literally) from both ends, in and out, in and out.<br />
<br />
The pressure in his prostate grew stronger, the dribble of pre turning into a steady stream. It was building to something big. Lenny wanted to gasp or cry out, warn them that he was about to blow his load, but it was like he never needed to. Rusty had noticed his lack of bobbing and forcefully began to thrust his cock down his throat, while  Troy behind him sped up as well, clapping his cheeks in a manic frenzy.<br />
<br />
The pressure and stimulation was growing too much, he couldn’t keep it down, he could feel the orgasm welling up like a volcano in his groin. Suddenly Rusty’s cock buck and shook in Lenny’s throat and a warm wetness that tasted metallic filled his mouth. On cue, Troy gave one final thrust and a similar warmth filled his innards. <br />
<br />
It was all too much for Lenny, who, with cum actually dribbling from his nose now, bucked his own hips. His balls rose and pulsed, cock shooting ropes and ropes of cum onto the bed-sheet below, orgasm crashing through him in wave after wave of ecstasy.<br />
<br />
Rusty pulled out and wiped the tip of his dick on Lenny’s face. He jumped when Troy slapped his ass and shoved the butt-plug back in. Lenny looked up at Rusty, who grinned and held up the cock cage.<br />
<br />
“Time to get back in, bud.”<br />
<br />
Lenny whimpered.</p>
