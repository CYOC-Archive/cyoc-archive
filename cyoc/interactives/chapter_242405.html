<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">On the TV in Ally&#39;s house, the picture went from mythological teachings to static. The blizzard of pixels got more chaotic as sparks spewed from the screen and the TV shook and rumbled as if it was possessed. Then a bright light was seen by Billy and Max from the outside. The two had been invited Sarah had invited both of them for a study session but they were running about twenty minutes late, as the boys were covered their eyes a shock wave passed through them and everything else. Once the light died down Billy&#39;s eyes widened as Ally&#39;s home was covered in glitching static pixels of varying sizes. The door became warped before turning into a curtain. The two boys rushed in to check on Billy&#39;s girlfriend and best friend.  <br />
<br />
Inside the house had changed. Although Max and Billy had never been in it before they knew no house had a hallway that expanded into a never-ending void. &quot;maybe we should go back and get... someone&quot; Max suggested. Only when he turned around he saw the wall with the door break off and float away along with several chunks of the hall. &quot;no turning back now. We got to find the girls&quot; Billy said. Before Max could ask what the plan was Billy did a running jump to the nearest platform. He landed on what seemed to be a medieval chandelier. &quot;come on!&quot; Billy said as he jumped across the debris like it was hopscotch. Max was more hesitant but the action was soon forced on to him as the remaining hallway began to crack apart. He followed Billy as best he could toward a strange light. Billy jumped onto the most significant chunk of land followed by Max.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, we&#39;re here now...&quot; Max lifted his head after panting with his hands on his knees. When he did he saw four figures. Each was covered in translucent static and frozen in a single pose. Two they didn&#39;t recognize one was a woman in Viking clothing and the other was a black Eastern dragon. These two were so translucent that the boys saw right through them. The other two made Billy gasp and Max go wide-eyed. They were a teenage boy in armor and a forty-foot dragon. They were as translucent as the other two but had the bodies of Sarah in the teen and Ally in the dragon. &quot;Sarah&quot; Billy rushed to her frozen form and tried to pull her out. Only to find her completely immobile. However, his actions seemed to affect the light causing lightning to come from it. &quot;Billy stop&quot; Max pulled him away. &quot;it&#39;s not going to work.&quot; he said. &quot;then what can we do huh?!&quot; Billy was frustrated and shoved Max. &quot;hey coming in here was your idea&quot; Max returned the shove. He was shocked to see a fist heading right for his head.  <br />
<br />
After it made contact Max stumbled back, right into the eastern dragon. The second he stepped inside he froze and the dragon mimicked his posture as best as it could. Billy stumbled as the entire void shook. The floating island he was on glitched and became more like a living room but still out of focus. The light now emanated from a knocked-over TV. Realizing he might be making a big mistake Billy kissed the lips of his frozen girlfriend. &quot;in case this doesn&#39;t work&quot; he ran right into the girl in Viking clothing. Once he entered her the girl mimicked his running pose. For a few moments nothing happened. Then the entire void began to glitch out.  <br />
<br />

<br />
Ally rose slowly from the floor. He shook his head as his eyes refocused. &quot;What happened?&quot; he recognized his voice, but it was more masculine and deep than before. He reached for his phone and unlocked it. Setting it to mirror, he saw a red-scaled anthro dragon whose horns almost touched the ceiling. He had on a blue sweatband, blue muscle shirt, and gym shorts. He let out a shout when he saw his reflection. he didn&#39;t look like Ally and he didn&#39;t look like Alzurn who Ally was convinced wasn&#39;t a dream. His entire body had fur covering his hard scales. His ears were now similar to a canine&#39;s. His mane wrapped around his neck like a lion. His body would rival bodybuilders.  <br />
<br />
Ally could feel his cock get erect as he found he liked this body. His thoughts were turning more sexual as he reached for his shorts. A moan made him realize he wasn&#39;t alone as he whipped around to see a teenage boy rubbing his head. The young man looked similar to his friend Sarah. His red hair was short and messy. His clothing looked a lot like what he wore before the remote. However, he had a sword strapped to his back and the emerald belt buckle. &quot;Sarah?&quot; Ally rushed over to his friend.  <br />
<br />
As he lifted him Sarah looked around confused. &quot;who&#39;s Sarah&quot; the young boy clutched his head in pain as memories of Sarah suddenly flooded into him. &quot;okay that explains the object&quot; Simon said. The two discussed what to do next. Their two forms seemed to have been jumbled up. Ally still felt like herself mostly but couldn&#39;t deny a bit of Alzurn&#39;s personality remained. The reverse was true with Simon. He remembered the memories of Sarah but they felt like the life of another person. Looking around the room he noticed the house looked different. The TV was half melted into the ground. A medieval chandelier from his castle hung above their heads.  <br />
<br />
All the furniture seemed large and more durable than before. Not to mention the now massive stone brick hallway leading to the dining room and the main hall was... wait! Simon and Ally ran over to two unconscious forms. One was a gorgeous woman that reminded Simon of Amy but with black hair and the other was an eastern dragon woman that was as black as midnight except for her blonde mane. Ally picked up the dragon anthro and Simon the woman.  <br />
<br />
After setting them on the couch the two eventually came around. &quot;what happened?&quot; the girl said. She then saw the two males in front of her. At first, she thought she was dreaming. Then she looked at herself. She screamed as she saw breasts jutting from beneath a cheerleader shirt. Billy knew she wore her jersey over here. No, she wasn&#39;t a she, she was a woman. No! She was female, she&#39;s a girl. &quot;Billy what happened,&quot; Max said as she raised his clawed hand. He was so shocked he tried to run only to fly right into the ceiling. &quot;ow!&quot; she said as she rubbed her head. &quot;wait you just said, Billy. So your... Max!&quot; Ally rushed over to her and dusted her off.  <br />
<br />
Ally couldn&#39;t believe the two people he had crushes on in both realities were one now. he could feel Alzun&#39;s bravery peeking through and went with it. &quot;so...&quot; Ally began only for Simon to interrupt. &quot;what happened to you guys?&quot; he asked. Billy and Max explained how Sarah had invited them. Ally facepalmed at not seeing the double date Sarah had planned. Why else would she insist on a break? They then explained the light and rushing in. Then Max crossed her arms as she explained the punch throwing her into Midnight&#39;s form. Billy then explained she saw how that fix things somewhat so she went into Amy&#39;s form. They also learned the two former guys had no memories or personalities of Amy and Midnight. Simon felt sad his girlfriend was gone but Billy explained she still loved him. They were deciding what to do next when...</p>
