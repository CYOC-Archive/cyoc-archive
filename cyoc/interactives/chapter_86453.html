<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Katie thought long and hard about her decision.  It was true, she&#39;d enjoyed being an adult in the brief time she was one so far.  She had gotten to do things no child her former age could dream of doing, and she now knew things about life and growing up she could never understand before.  At the same time however, she had a strong dislike of it.  Adults could be just as childish as children, sometimes moreso.  The time in the bar had opened her eyes to the new ways of life, of sexuality, of stupidity, in the adult way that she truly didn&#39;t like.  She herself knew and felt these things, and she was truely curious about them, but growing up so quickly had made it seem like a passing phase.  In an instant, she&#39;d gone from an inert child to sexually active woman.  She had the memories and experiences but not from first hand knowledge, so it was like remembering a dream.   What was more, she liked being a child, at least a more grown child, more than she had as an adult.  There were fewer responsibilities, especially with her mother now a child herself.  No one to boss her around, or tell her now, and with the ring she could make almost anything happen to her age or the age of people around her.    It thrilled and scared her at the same time.   She wanted to try a nice middle age, older than 7 or 10 but not older than 14 or even 13.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s it,&quot;  Katie thought looking down at the ring on her finger.  &quot;Ill make my wish for that.&quot;   <br />
<br />
She moved away from the girls to a secluded room in the house, a bathroom that had a full length mirror.  She wanted to see this for herself and moved to stand in front of it.  Then she made her wish and felt the ring warm as the glow flowed over it.  <br />
<br />
The first obvious change was to her height, she felt and saw her body begin to creep backwards through time, her clothes beginning to get increasingly larger on her youthening body.  Her hair which fell to her shoulders and down her back began to pull its way back up, picking up sheen as natural highlights replaced ones that an adult would color in.  Her skin began to moisten as puberty&#39;s hard hold began to take effect.  Pimples began to sprout from her once beautiful face...marring it.   Watching them form, she saw the signs of a &quot;pizza face&quot; she would have as a high schooler and shivered.  Just another reason to not become a teen.  Her arms and legs began to become more lanky and coltish and she felt a distinct tingle in her chest as her breasts began to diminish.  Her shoes and pants became far more roomy as she wiggled her toes inside.  She was approaching what would probably be her junior year in high school as she left college years completely behind.  Then she felt something on her teeth.  Opening her mouth she ran her tongue over them to find she had braces.  That perfect smile she had as an adult...was hard earned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Id be a total outcast in high school!&quot;  She realized.  &quot;This is awful.  I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t try these ages.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Her thoughts of sex and sexuality began to become more murky.  Wheras she had understood it as an adult, as a teen she began to feel more curious and perhaps even desperate than anything else.  She squirmed feeling her insides warm with the thought of pleasures brought to it in private....working their way backwards as she approached her sophomore year.  This sexual frustration built in her body though her mind was losing the sexual essence.  It was maddening as she resisted with all her strength to use the ring to stop the change right here to relieve herself.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Thats not what I want&quot;  She kept telling herself in her mind.  Crossing the threshold from sophomore to freshmen, she felt a palpable relief as some of the tension ebbed away to shyer curiosities.  Noticing other girls when showering, talk of changes to the body, her own cycles, things like that.  &quot;I wonder what it feels like to kiss.&quot;  She found herself thinking.  <br />
<br />
That thought, that question, began to become the prevailing feeling and desire as the sexual arousal returned to the more innocent and curious delvings of junior high.  By now her chest was beginning to flatten, and her hair had pulled up to her neck.  The pimples which had formed were slowly diminishing after freshman year and soon were giving way again to smooth and flawless skin.  The braces still dominated her teeth, but shifted and changed with new arrangements, now more the kind worn by someone fresh to them.  The feeling was now again brand new to her mouth as her tongue fuddled with the contraption and words became harder to speak.  Her blouse was now voluminous around her dwindling breast.  Her pants had given up the ghost and she stepped out of them and unbuttoned her dress.  Her panties still clung to her loins but she could see the dark outline of pubic hair diminishing underneath.  <br />
<br />
She did not mourn its passing.  The hairs itched in the worst way, now as they drew back into the skin she felt herself transitioning from 8th to 7th grade.  Closing her eyes, she undid her shirt and finally spread her legs and stood naked at the mirror.  She took a deep breath and opened her eyes.  The last pimples were gone, and a light freckling had begun to dot her cheeks as her perfect nose began to turn up again with childhood.  Her eyes were growing wider, younger and the spark of innocence was swiftly returning.  Her hair, now to her neck, began to fashion itself into the length for a ponytail as her coltish arms and legs continued to diminish.  She watched a smoothness flow over her arms as the last unsightly hairs prickled and dissapeared from her body, leaving the only remaining hair on her head.   Her breasts were now swiftly diminishing mounds of which her 13 year old self was very curious.  <br />
<br />
She tried to think in her head of the things she&#39;d known, but now she was more curious and confused than anything else.  She didn&#39;t understand growing up or puberty too well, and what she did know sparked some desires but most were met in her mind with little gigglings of how silly or potentially gross they were.  &quot;Perfect.&quot;  She thought.   Indeed looking at her body, she knew this was the right choice.  The twelve year old grinned and twirled around once for good measure.  Looking at her discarded clothes she made a second wish.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I wish that my clothes and everyone elses would adjust to their current age and circumstance that we&#39;re in and that no one will remember any different.&quot;  <br />
<br />
There was a warmth and then her discarded garments suddenly picked up and began to change into a pair of pink pajamas perfectly forming and flowing around her body.  Her nails on fingers and toes were studded with fake stones and pink nail polish.  Her hair was braided with childish care.  She grinned.  This would be the perfect sleepover.  Opening the door she tramped out to join the other girls.</p>
