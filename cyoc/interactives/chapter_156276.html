<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>By CAIN</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Now, before you see your family, I just want to let you know I took some time to prepare them as best I could for the shock of it all.” Jeremy solemnly said to me. “That said, I suppose you can never really prepare anyone for a change as big as this – I imagine you are still having issues coming to terms with it, after all.” I nodded in agreement. “All right then, if you are ready, I’ll take you to the meeting room I set them up in – and just like I told them, if you need the assistance of any of our staff, to include our mental health counselors, we are at your disposal.” I nodded again. <br />
<br />
Jeremy then smiled, “OK! Well, that out of the way let me take you to them now.” I returned his smile. <br />
<br />
A short walk down the hall toward a small meeting room, he paused at the door while I took a deep breath. I have to admit, I was nervous as Hell. A thousand thoughts ran through my head, and I could picture a thousand outcomes of how they would take this – and most of them not well. But maybe that was just the pessimist in me, I needed to think more positively. After all, I was still alive – just in a different shell. <br />
<br />
Jeremy held the door open and ushered me in, a firm solid hand on my shoulder. The shock in Trisha’s eyes at seeing my new appearance was blatantly obvious. And to her left, sitting with a thick hoodie was my youngest son Michael. Trevor wasn’t present, but I imagine him being two states away, getting here would take some time before I’d get to see him. <br />
<br />
Tears formed in her eyes as she stood and covered her mouth in utter shock, “Paul? Is that… is that really you?” she asked, with her voice shaking. <br />
<br />
“Yeah, Trish, it’s me…” Damn, it sounded so strange saying my pet name for my wife with this younger raspy voice. I moved toward her, and she stood as still as a statue, clearly unable to process this monumental change to her husband’s appearance, and probably just how terrible I looked now. I looked down into her gorgeous emerald green eyes. I moved closer again with my thin tattoo and scab covered arms out ready for her soft embrace, yet she continued to stand as still as a statue, her eyes wide in disbelief and… repulsion? Well, who could blame her, I was not only a completely different person now, but this new body of mine wasn’t the best option… Not like I had been given any option that is.<br />
<br />
“Please Trish…” I said, looking down at her, about to break down into tears myself. “It’s me, this is me now… All of this. I didn’t have a choice, but at least I’m still alive. I still love you. I’m still your husband.”<br />
<br />
“This… This can’t be real, right?” She looked at the doctor, “This is some sort of joke, a prank?” Tears streaming down her face now, but her tone had turned from shock to anger at this point. I knew that tone only all too well after two decades of marriage, and I recoiled slightly at it. It was partly out of instinct, but partly because I was emotionally taken aback that now she no longer accepts me as her husband. <br />
<br />
“Ma’am,” Jeremy started, “This is no joke. I know it is unbelievable, I know you had your reservations in our discussions over the last couple of weeks, and I know nothing could prepare you entirely for seeing your husband’s new form in person. But please believe me, that this person IS your husband Paul. Our project was a success, and because of that, we were able to save your husband’s life by giving him a new one.” Jeremy said, as solemnly and firmly as he could muster.<br />
<br />
She looked at him, and then looked at me, grimly. “What’s my favorite color?” She asked, firmly. <br />
<br />
“Lavender purple.” I replied immediately. <br />
<br />
“Where did we meet?” She asked.<br />
<br />
Oh, I guess we’re playing that game, despite what the doctor told her. OK… “We met at the university book store, I was helping you find your obscure accounting book, then we had coffee at the little shop nearby.” <br />
<br />
She started to smile, in a somewhat devious way. “OK, last one then, when is our wedding anniversary?” <br />
<br />
It was my turn to look at her in shock. I always forget what it is, only because there is so much going on that same time of year with both sons being born that same week, the same week as my father’s birthday, and then Christmas only a week later. You’d think that would help me remember it, but my brain just doesn’t work like that. <br />
<br />
“I, uh… Trish, you know I can never remember that!” I said finally exasperated at trying to recall it. <br />
<br />
At that, she broke out in a huge smile and leapt up and hugged me tightly, “OH PAUL! It really is you!”<br />
<br />
I looked over to Jeremy who at first was dumbfounded, but then started to crack up, with Michael joining in, I couldn’t help but laugh a deep throated guffaw myself. So that’s how I laugh now, even that is alien to me. <br />
<br />
“Yeah Trish, it’s me, all six and a half 20 something scrawny White boy body of me.” I replied, still laughing. <br />
<br />
We continued to hug for another minute. I was so happy to see her again. I could feel the dampness from her tears begin to soak through my t-shirt into the tank top I wore underneath. I was crying a little too, if I’m being honest. But these were definitely happy tears. Though it had only been a little over a two weeks since I last saw her in person, it felt simultaneously like it was only yesterday and that it was also an eternity ago. In a way, I guess I could say it was a lifetime ago. <br />
<br />
She broke off the hug and re took her seat, I sat next to her on her right, with my son Michael seated across from me. Jeremy was still standing by the door, I assume there to answer any initial questions they might have and ensure things went smoothly, or at least as smoothly as could be expected, considering.<br />
<br />
I looked at Michael and smiled. He had been looking me over carefully as I was hugging Trisha. Maybe cautious or concerned about this (physically) stranger hugging his mom? He finally spoke, “Damn, Dad…You look like shit!”<br />
<br />
I retorted almost immediately, with a smile “Gee, thanks Mikey, nice to see you too.”<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry Dad, it’s just…” At this point Michael stood up and walked over to me, looking over my tattoos and arms more closely, “Well the tattoos are pretty sick, but all them scabs and shit, you look like you’re straight out of a zombie flick.”<br />
<br />
I was about to explain the circumstances when Jeremy cut in, to me he said “I already explained to them the donor situation, and that your appearance will be a temporary condition.” <br />
<br />
I nodded. “That’s Mickey, just trying to be a little shit, as usual.” I said and everyone in the room chuckled at that. <br />
<br />
“So Dr. Jenkins,” Trisha said, “You never told us who the donor is, just that he was a John Doe. Is that something you’re not allowed to tell us?” She asked. <br />
<br />
“Well no,” Jeremy started, “If I knew the identity I would tell you. As I explained before, as far as we know, he was a transient on the streets. No ID, no one reported him missing. We’ve ran his prints through the national database, and so far, nothing has come back. So he was never arrested, never joined the military, never worked for the government – as far as we can tell.”<br />
<br />
At this point I interjected, pointing at the tattoo on the side of my neck. “I don’t know why, but I have a feeling this might be the last name.” Then I stood, lifting up my shirt to show the tattoo on my stomach, “And I have a hunch this was maybe his mom, or someone close to him?” <br />
<br />
“Hmm, could be a possibility,” Jeremy said, “Julie Hollinger – If she had the same last name as him, she may not have, after all.” He jotted the name on his notepad, and then a little more, “You say this is a hunch?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, just a feeling I have, I can’t explain it, maybe it’s just me trying to make sense of things. It could be a stretch but maybe that’ll help figure out who this was? It’d only be right we somehow let his family know he’s gone… Well I guess physically he’s not, but the person they knew before doesn’t exist anymore.” Jeremy nodded and continued to write more notes. <br />
<br />
I turned back to Trisha and Michael, asking them all about what I missed. Trisha mentioned that Trevor, my oldest, would be in town after Friday, when he has his last finals for the semester. He was going to be staying with us through the break. I pictured Trevor, who used to tower over me by almost a half a foot, standing right about 6’3”. But now, I was taller than him! How crazy is that? It would be good to see him again too, since I hadn’t seen him since summer break as he decided to visit his girlfriend’s family during Thanksgiving, when we would normally all get together with our extended family and cook up a big meal. Michael mentioned he was training hard for the State Championship and he was confident he would win that title this year for sure. I asked him about school and he said things were going well, when Trisha mentioned he was failing English and she was giving him extra attention so he could try and pass. He looked sheepish at that, slightly embarrassed knowing I always had high expectations of him. <br />
<br />
About this time, Jeremy mentioned that the hospital cafeteria would be closing in a half an hour if we wanted to get some food before then while we were here. Then before he excused himself, he said he wanted to talk to me a little after, so to find him in his office when we were done. I nodded and said I would. <br />
<br />
I still wasn’t all that hungry yet, and Trisha said she’d be fine for now. Michael said he was starving and asked Trisha for a little money to go grab something, asking if we were both sure we didn’t want anything. We said no, but thanks. And Trisha said that she would text him when we were done talking and meet him in the lobby. “Cool deal” Michael responded flatly then he looked at me “It was good to see you Dad. We’ll talk more later”, and then he gave me a timid hug and left. <br />
<br />
Trisha and I sat in silence for a good minute, with her looking me over intently. She finally broke her silence, “So, are you ok with… well, with all of this?” she said in a friendly way, gesturing toward me with her hand, moving it up and down quickly. <br />
<br />
“Well, like I said before, it’s not like I had much of a choice. Being taller and younger is, well if I’m being honest, it’s weird but probably a plus out of the whole thing.” I said with a brief smile. “But if I had a choice, would I have picked a drug addict’s body? No, probably not.” I said matter-of-factly. <br />
<br />
“Can I be honest?” Trisha started, “I think the tattoos are kinda sexy.” She said, impishly. She saw the astonished look on my face, “What? I do. C’mon, you know every girl wants a bad boy, right? Besides, you’re still my husband, on the inside at least, so I know you’re not REALLY a bad boy, but you have to admit, you DO look like one now, and to me, that’s kind of turning me on right now.”<br />
<br />
“Are you… are you serious right now?” I asked, thinking she was pulling my leg. She stood up slowly and seductively walked over to me. While she was wearing her mom jeans and a university sweatshirt, I couldn’t help by feel my new dick start to harden at the sight of her. She pushed me back on my chair and straddled my lap, like she was some sort of stripper at a sleazy night club, and damned if I wasn’t enjoying this show! And as a result, my new ten inch uncut dick was making my boxer shorts and jeans very uncomfortable.<br />
<br />
She reached down with her petite hand underneath her and rubbed the fabric where she could feel my cock start to harden with the way she was dry humping me. When she felt my new tool, her eyes shot open wide. “Oh my God Paul, that thing is huge!” <br />
<br />
I smiled and laughed. “Yeah, I guess it is Trish, and now it’s all yours as much as it’s mine!” then I pulled her into me and gave her a deep sensual kiss. I could start to feel the heat from her and she stripped off her sweatshirt, leaving only a thin camisole revealed. I reached up and started to fondle her breasts through the fabric and she was just loving it! <br />
<br />
Part of me wondered, should I be jealous? Here is my wife of two decades, going wild over another man’s body. But then I thought better of it, it IS my body now, and I am still her husband, and frankly, this body will probably do a way better job of pleasing her sexually than my old one could, so why the hell not? Damn, how weird is that thought? Almost like I’m about to cuckold my own self. <br />
<br />
She was kneading the hell out of my cock with one hand, and feeling all over my body with her other as I continued to kiss her deeply and fondle her perfect breasts in a way that felt like it was the first time I’d ever done so, like I was a teenager again going nuts over my kinky girlfriend. We broke off our kiss, she yanked off my two shirts, seeing my thin toned chest fully for the first time, and she started to tweak my nipple piercings. <br />
<br />
“FUCK Trish!” I whispered loudly. <br />
<br />
“What? Does that hurt?” She asked, concerned. <br />
<br />
“No, not at all, that gets me so fucking turned on actually, that shit is so sensitive!” <br />
<br />
“Oh really? So THIS” she said, as she briefly yanked at the rings, “gets you turned on?”<br />
<br />
I quivered underneath her, “Phew! Yeah, it really does!” I said.<br />
<br />
She then stood up, and slowly ran her hands down my chest, breezing over the nipples once more, then down my shallow six-pack, and past my belly button. She quickly undid my belt and jeans, and slid them down past my knees. My hard cock, finally free, stood straight up out of the slip of the boxers. She moved to her knees and looked at it, curiously, since it was not only nearly twice the size of my old cock, but also had the foreskin. Much like myself, I doubt she’s ever seen an uncut cock before, unless she maybe watched some sort of porno without me or something. <br />
<br />
She experimentally played with the foreskin, sliding it up and down. While she was satiating her curiosity, I was getting more and more turned on. After a minute of her manipulative ministrations, and me starting to leak quite a bit of precum, she took the head into her mouth. Since I was the third guy she ever dated in her life (the other two being back in her high school) I doubt she’s ever had a cock this big before. But she did her best to take in as much as she could. I realized that what actually helped get me going was if she would play with the hood around the head a bit more, so I told her to tongue it, and she went at it like a pro. <br />
<br />
I was leaning back in my chair now as she went to town on my new cock, softly moaning her name and mixing in some dirty talk now and then. She would reply with some dirty talk of her own, which only helped to get me even more turned on. “Fuck Trish, I’m getting close now babe!” I said, almost out of breath. <br />
<br />
She stopped suddenly. My eyes were closed at this time, so I opened them to see what was going on. She was slipping out of her jeans and panties. “I want to ride that dick Paul, fucking pound me with that big fucking cock!” Who was this woman? Damn, getting this new body was apparently the spark that got her fires going – maybe this was going to be a bit win-win after all? <br />
<br />
“Are you sure babe? I don’t have a condom, do you?” I asked, not sure how far she wanted to go with all this. Don’t get me wrong, I was enjoying the Hell out of my wife acting like such a depraved whore for this new body. But I also thought about the potential consequences. If I got her pregnant, well, it wouldn’t be my REAL kid, but from the seed of this John Doe druggie. What sort of affect would that have on that child or our family? <br />
<br />
“Yes, I am sure. I haven’t been fucked in two months Paul, since after that party with your office. I need it so bad right now.” She said, like a woman possessed with pure lust. <br />
<br />
“What if I get you pregnant?” I said, voicing my main concern. <br />
<br />
“I don’t care Paul, if I get pregnant, it’s still OUR child no matter what. But right now, all I can think about is that huge dick getting my pussy all wet!” <br />
<br />
Well fuck, who am I to deny the lady’s request?<br />
<br />
So I pushed her back onto the table and fell to my own knees, being tall enough now that I could do what I was about to do to her. I put her legs on my shoulder and went down on her. I quickly realized what the tongue stud was for as I had her moaning like a bitch in heat in no time and I swear I made her cum at least once just tonguing her pussy already soaked with her own juices. <br />
<br />
“Just fucking put it in me Paul!” she whispered forcefully, I had gotten so wrapped up in eating her out, again, like it was the first time I ever done it, that I had zoned out of all else except paying attention to what my tongue was doing. <br />
<br />
I stood again, letting my jeans fall to the floor with a heavy thud, and I swiftly pulled her to the edge of the table (God I hope no one is going to eat off this later – I oddly thought to myself right then). I reached down to my throbbing hard tool, stroked it a couple of times to let the precum get it nice and lubed up (not that I’d need the lube with the tongue lashing I just gave my wife and the juices she had flowing already). Then I smirked to myself, “You know, it looks like this guy had a piercing in his dick before, might be interesting to put it back in later.” I said, not really expecting a response from Trisha the way she was waiting for me to rail her. <br />
<br />
So without further ado, I slid into her all the way, feeling deeper into amazing pussy than I had ever gone before – what an odd but fantastic experience! I could tell she was having the same experience right now. Here was a dick almost twice the size of her husband’s previous one, plunging deep into her canal as well as stretching her out slightly. From my perspective, it was like my wife had a tighter pussy than she had before and I could feel parts deep inside of her with my cock head I didn’t know existed. <br />
<br />
She reached down to play with her clit as I pumped her swiftly and played with her breasts again. Man I was really focused on her breasts for some reason. I mean, I always thought she had amazing tits, nice little C cups, not too big, not too small, just the right size for her petite frame. But here I was now just totally fucking entranced with them. <br />
<br />
Trisha let out rapid short gasps, trying her best to stifle her moans and the multiple orgasms I was giving her now. Damn she was so hot! Unfortunately, since I shot a load (well two loads) in the shower before, I had quite a bit of stamina now. But I also realized that the hospital cafeteria was probably closed now and Michael would be wondering what was taking my wife so long. <br />
<br />
So I did my best to come to orgasm, instead of playing with those perfect bouncing globes before me, I reached up and started to tweak my own nipples as I ever so rapidly plunged my hard cock in and out of my wife’s juicy pussy. I started to stand on my tip toes, bringing her body up with me slightly. <br />
<br />
“OH FUCK TRISH, I’m gonna cum!” I said aloud, forgetting to whisper (but at least not loud enough to raise the suspicions of those nearby). <br />
<br />
“Fucking give it to me Paul, give me that fucking load now!” she squealed, also trying to keep her voice down. <br />
<br />
And then… <br />
<br />
Another massive explosion! Of course, I couldn’t see it since my dick was deep into my wife at that point, but it felt even larger than my first orgasm in this body before my shower just over an hour ago. I slid all the way in, feeling my balls continue to throb as they pumped out my load into my wife’s waiting uterus. In my mind, I could picture a billion strong little swimmers making their way toward an egg…<br />
<br />
I lay down on top of her, allowing my cock to deflate inside her. I could feel her rapid pulse, and mine too pounding in my ears. I’m sure I was flushed with my exertion. And my wife had a look of total bliss on her face. Eyes closed and a serene smile. <br />
<br />
She was the first again to break the silence, “Is it weird that I sort of feel like I cheated on you?”<br />
<br />
I could only laugh at that, “You know, I was bouncing the same idea in my head earlier, that maybe I should be jealous of how turned on you are by this druggie’s body.”<br />
<br />
“OK, yeah, he’s no Hollywood model or anything, but it is YOUR body now, and honestly, he’s got a lot of potential.” She said, lifting up my face to look into her eyes. “And if you can fuck me like that all the time, that would be just perfect!” She said. Then we both laughed at that. Yeah, this was going to work out for us just fine I had a feeling. <br />
<br />
Both of us were fully dressed again a few minutes later. We realized the room stank of sex, and there was no way to deodorize it. We could only hope this late at night, no one would need the room for any business so we could get away with our little risqué escapade. <br />
<br />
“Well I better go meet our son before he thinks I forgot him or got lost.” Trisha said, as she stretched up for another kiss. I held her tightly once more. I didn’t really want to let her go, but I knew she had to get home, take care of our boy, and get some sleep before work tomorrow. “But I’ll be by after work tomorrow, it’s parent teacher night, so it won’t be until after 6 unfortunately.” <br />
<br />
I nodded, “Yeah, that’s fine, gives me time to get some things done around here before that.” I said, thinking about needing to meet with Jeremy after this, as well as probably wanting to meet with their shrink tomorrow at some point. <br />
<br />
“Of course, unless you don’t want me to, I plan to bring Michael with me tomorrow night. He didn’t get much of a chance to talk to you tonight. I feel kinda bad about that, but when I saw you… Hmm… Well mama has needs!” She said with a chuckle. <br />
<br />
“Trish, I would love to fuck you again… And again… And again! But you’re right, we should be fair to Michael, give him a chance to get used to the new me too. But at least I’m glad you’re OK with this.” I said, gesturing over my body. <br />
<br />
“Oh I am MORE than OK.” She said with a devilish smile, “Especially with THIS!” she said as she forcefully grabbed my semi hard cock, making me quiver once again. It’s amazing how this little 5’8” woman could make this 6’5” White boy weak in the knees like that! <br />
<br />
“OK, enough of that, before we end up fucking again!” She gave me one more deep kiss. “I’ll see you tomorrow babe, sleep well and I love you.” <br />
<br />
“I love you too Trish. And tell Michael I was happy to see him again and I love him too and to be good in school.” <br />
<br />
And with that, she nodded and left.<br />
<br />
I was alone in the room for a couple of minutes. I thought about what I had done – not that I regret it, not in the least! It was probably the best sex I’ve had in my whole life. Weird how my wife hasn’t changed (well not physically like I have) but sex with her tonight was infinitely more passionate and sensual than it ever was before. I guess that’s another plus, but it oddly made me feel inadequate, at least the old me. I guess I really need to stop thinking of myself in the terms of the old Paul, and instead start learning to accept this new reality I was thrust into. <br />
<br />
I shook my head and sighed. I stood up, straightened out my shirt, and made my way to the nurses stand to ask where Jeremy’s office was. I had quite a lot to unpack with him tonight.</p>
