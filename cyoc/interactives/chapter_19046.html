<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tyler was confused by a number of the instructions.  Sexual orientation?  What on earth was that?<br />
<br />
Confused, he went to the online forum of the earth corporation that had made this and entered a chat room, creating a persona for himself with the earth-names the delivery boy had used: &quot;Big Bad Rover.&quot;<br />
<br />
*Big Bad Rover* Hi.  Just got this new product.  Kind of confused.  What's my sexual orientation?<br />
<br />
*RosaR* Lots of us are confused at first, but then we know what we like and it's all good.<br />
<br />
This was not very helpful.  Tyler typed more.<br />
<br />
*Big Bad Rover* Uh, no.  Honestly confused.  What's a sexual orientation?<br />
<br />
*sillieboy* Well, what sex are you?<br />
<br />
*Big Bad Rover* Male, last I checked.<br />
<br />
*RosaR*  Well, do you like men or women?  Or both?<br />
<br />
*Big Bad Rover* Only met one man in my life.  He was...confusing.  Didn't like him much, I guess.<br />
<br />
The delivery boy really was odd.<br />
<br />
*Big Bad Rover* If it helps, I'm not human.  I'm a wolf.<br />
<br />
*sillieboy* Oh<br />
<br />
*RosaR* Well, do you like male wolves or female wolves?<br />
<br />
*Big Bad Rover* For what?<br />
<br />
*sillieboy* For sex.  Duh.<br />
<br />
Oh...  So that's what it's about.  Now this made more sense.<br />
<br />
*Big Bad Rover* Well, if a female wolf in heat is around, I'll have sex with anything.  Even the arm of the couch.<br />
<br />
*sillieboy* Heat?<br />
<br />
*Big Bad Rover* When they release their pheremones, when they're fertile.  Hell, I even get turned on by horse pheremones and cat pheremones.  And vulpine ones are almost the same.<br />
<br />
*RosaR* Yes, but who do you desire when they're not in heat?<br />
<br />
*Big Bad Rover* Uh, no one?<br />
<br />
These humans were seriously insane.  No pheremones?<br />
<br />
Tyler had mostly had sex with vulpine women, because a slim young wolf was almost the same as a very large adult male fox, and when you're at college, it's a good way to rutt and not get pregnant.  But an alpha male wolf emitted pheremones strong enough to get a whole pack of females to come into heat at once, with estrus in synch, which is something that Tyler and every other male wolf aspired to, at least once he bulked up a bit was done being a young lone wolf.  And if he was lucky enough to not live his life as a beta.<br />
<br />
But being able to procreate with vulpine women, not to mention feline and even equine women?  That sounded hot.  Human sex might even be interesting.<br />
<br />
Tyler went to the Chronivac and typed in a command: &quot;Please list species options under Sexual Orientation menu.&quot;<br />
<br />
It took a moment, as it appeared that the program was loading up new software, but then a list of species came up.  His current one of LUPINE was already checked, but he clicked the mouse and added VULPINE, EQUINE, and FELINE, then clicked the &quot;Mental and Physical&quot; box.<br />
<br />
He typed in another request: Please check Alpha Male boxes, mental and physical, for appropriate menus.<br />
<br />
The Chronivac clicked and whirred, then reported: Operation complete.  Other options?<br />
<br />
Tyler typed: Please add 'human' under 'sexual orientation' menu as well.<br />
<br />
Warning: Human mental/physical makeup differs from Furry.  Estrus cycle more frequent but less pronounced, male pheremones similarly different.  Admixture not fully researched.  If proceeding, clients are requested to fill out consumer feedback forms.  Continue Y/N?<br />
<br />
Tyler clicked Y, then went and clicked the APPLY CHANGES button.<br />
<br />
There was a whirr from the Chronivac and screens flashed up one after the other, most of them something called a CHIMERA.<br />
<br />
The first thing that Tyler noticed that he was growing, but then that made sense, since Equines were larger than almost every Furry, and Felines ranged from small Cats to huge Tigers and even the rare Sabretooth, like his friend Bob, who was terribly embarrassed about being a throwback and something of an outcast because of it.  Plus alphas were bigger than other wolves as well.<br />
<br />
The next thing he noticed was that his hair was growing, both on his head and on his tail, turning red, as did all the fur on his body, save his arm which began striping black as his fingers grew tiger claws, while his his feet changed into hooves.  And he grew larger and more powerful, tearing out of his clothes, while his shoulders broadened and his chest hair thinned until at last he stood there, a chimera.<br />
<br />
He inspected himself.  The different parts were mostly blended and shaded.  He'd gotten mostly the fur of a lupine, especially the tail with its white tip, while his legs and cock had become equine.  His torso had apparently become human, especially the chest, though thankfully with some hair coverage, while his arms had become like those of a tiger, with lovely red bands and much sharper claws.  But his face was still recognizably his same old lupine head, with only two changes, one attractive, one odd.  The attractive one was that his fur had now become as red as the average fox, which was rare for a wolf, and the odd one was that the fur on the top of his head had grown into a mane somewhere between a lion and a human, over a foot of luxuriant blond mane, the same color as his original fur.<br />
<br />
However, Tyler felt incredibly handsome and virile, since he was an Alpha Chimera, producing pheremones that would send any female wolf, cat, fox, horse/donkey or human into heat after just a few hours exposure.  And with the human blend, he was suddenly just becoming turned on by himself, because he was one sexy chimera.</p>
