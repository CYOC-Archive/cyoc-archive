<br />
Sarah had had enough, first she was reduced to a 12 year old, now she was some busty bimbo. There was only so much the Director of S.P.E.A.R could take. Storming into guest relations, she now stomped towards an employee, an anthro cocker spaniel girl who looked fresh out of college. The dog girl smiling with her ears tied to look like two pigtails. &quot;How can I help you Miss?&quot; Sarah reached into her belongings, slamming her identification badge down. Seeing it the anthro dog girls eyes grew wide as Sarah now spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get Circe NOW!&quot;<br />
<br />
Twenty minutes later, Sarah found herself entering a steam room. After discovering her identity, the employees of Circes Amusement Park became noticeably anxious, apologizing sincerely before calling Circe herself. In her dealings with the other timeline, Sarah had found Circe to be the most reasonable. Lilith, being a demon witch, would torment her guests. Those torments though had become much tamer recently, Sarah chalking it up to her agreement with the wizards. Baba Yaga, while powerful, seemed more interested in her relationship with Merlin than business. All of Sarah&#39;s interactions with the old crone had been pointless with Baba appearing flighty at best. This left Circe.<br />
<br />
Circe may have been a powerful sorceress interested in transformation but she understood diplomacy. Sarah assumed it was from living through the golden age of Greek culture. Regardless, she apologized and offered to reverse Sarah&#39;s bimbo transformation. Unfortunately it meant returning to her previous transformation Lilithhad inflicted on her.<br />
<br />
Sighing inside the steam room, Sarah could feel herself transforming. The womans body returned to its previous adult appearance, her face losing its bimbo proportions as her breasts returned to normal. For a moment Sarah was her adult self once more, but she knew it wouldn&#39;t last.<br />
<br />
Unlike last time, Sarah&#39;s robe shrank with her. Gazing at herself, she could see her curves decreasing, her limbs narrowing, and once proud breasts reduced to small, conical mounds of early adolescence. As her barefeet lifted from the floor, she gazed down at them before hopping off the bench. As she exited the steam room, she now gazed at her 12 year old appearance once again.<br />
<br />
There was no denying it, this was Sarah McMillan age 12. Standing around five feet tall with long brunette hair cascading past her shoulders with conical breasts and skinny legs she looked exactly as she had when she had been an sporty, adorable sixth grader. Thoughts of her childhood now front and center as she gazed at the brunette preteen in the mirror. Growing up in Central Michigan, visiting her grandparents in both western Michigan and Indiana, even thoughts of being a complete daddy&#39;s girl. The memories of spending Saturday and Sunday afternoons watching football with her dad gave the reduced agent a warm, nostalgic feeling.<br />
<br />
Sarah now shook her head, clearing away the euphoric nostalgia she was feeling. That was the problem with Circes Park, other amusement parks made you have feelings of nostalgia and childish bliss. Circes made those feelings reality, it was a brilliant business model, allowing adults to actually be a kid for a day as well as living out an transformative fantasy in their mind. As much as Sarah wanted to just sit back and relax, she had a job to do. Smoothing out her white tarry cloth robe, she noticed a pair of white slippers that perfectly fit her tiny barefeet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sarah?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah screamed, jumping as the voice startled her. Turning her anxiety immediately turned into embarrassment as she stared at an obviously befuddled Jacob Moreland. &quot;Jacob what are you doing here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Its been an hour Sarah,&quot; he replied curiously, looking over the obviously embarrassed 12 year old. &quot;Let me guess Lilith.&quot; Sarah sighed, nodding as she found herself gazing down at the floor. She had hoped to avoid being seen like this. Jacob now stood over a foot taller than her, looking more like her father than a coworker. &quot;Please don&#39;t say anything to anyone,&quot; she said softly. Jacob smirked, clapping his one good hand on the girls shoulder. &quot;Dont worry I won&#39;t say a word. Now what&#39;s the plan?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah now firmly explained what they would do. Circe, realizing Lilith had overstepped immediately wanted to make amends. This meant the duo would interview Bong-cha the vampire. Although they wouldn&#39;t be able to take her from the grounds, they could interrogate her for information. Entering the interrogation room, Sarah furrowed her brow as she stared at the punk vampire. Thankfully Circe had provided some clothes, a tshirt, jeans, and pink converse sneakers complete with bra, panties, and socks. While the outfit was embarrassing, resembling clothes she wore at this age, she was at least glad to not be wearing the robe anymore.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck is going on,&quot; Bong exclaimed. &quot;I&#39;ll ask the questions,&quot; Sarah replied, trying to sound firm despite the childish tenor of her voice. Unfortunately all it did was cause the vampire to burst into laughter. &quot;Questions,&quot; the vampire laughed. &quot;What questions? Do I want to join thr Girl Scouts? The answers to this week&#39;s quiz? Does the cute guy like you or does he like you like you?&quot; Bong laughed harder, causing Sarah to frown. This wasn&#39;t starting off on a positive note, thankfully she had Jacob.<br />
<br />
Jacob now reached into his pocket, taking out his ID before sliding it towards the vampire. Wiping her eyes, Bong glanced down. Immediately the vampire stopped laughing, her eyes going wide in terror as what little color left her face. <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re...you&#39;re a Moreland?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well what do ya know,&quot; Jacob grinned. &quot;Looks like the night stalker does have some sense.&quot; Bong-cha gulped, her rebellious facade fading as she fearfully gazed at the demon hunter. Every vampire knew who the Morelands were. They were the monsters that vampires feared the way humans feared them. Sitting only feet from one now made the Korean vampire wonder if she would join so many other vampires as a pile of dust.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here&#39;s the deal blood sucker,,&quot; Jacob stated. &quot;Unless you want to end up a pile of dust you&#39;re going to tell us everything you know about the Normal. Oh and if you make any smart-ass comments about my partner I&#39;m gonna give ya a silver piercing in a place I guarantee will hurt.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah got it,&quot; Bong-cha replied nervously. Gulping she now told the pair everything. How they met the Boss and a vampire named Ann. At the mention of Ann, Jacob fidgeted, a scowl forming across his face. &quot;Was she a child?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No man,&quot; Bong said quickly. &quot;Although the hooded dude said something about a spell. She could&#39;ve been at one time but now she was like older. Probably late twenties a badass if she manhandled Luca.&quot; Sarah glanced at the demon hunter, noticing the anxiety on his face. &quot;Jacob?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s nothing,&quot; he said quickly. &quot;What happened after they tagged you with the bombs? Did you have a handler?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah and that&#39;s the weird part,&quot; Bong exclaimed. &quot;It was a kumiho named Choon Hee.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s a kumiho,&quot; Sarah asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;They were a cousin of the kitsune,&quot; Jacob stated. &quot;And a bloodthirsty one at that. They used to eat human hearts but they&#39;ve been extinct for centuries. The kitsune saw to that but the few that did escape were killed off by hunters more than a century ago. You sure it was a kumiho?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Definitely,&quot; Bong stated. &quot;She said so, plus I saw her.&quot; Jacob sighed heavily, rubbing thr grey stubble on his face. Kumiho were bad news, nearly as powerful as kitsune they were notorious for their magic and brutality. Trying to take one out would be difficult even for the best of hunters. &quot;Okay vamp here&#39;s the deal&quot; he said. &quot;Any information you get on the Normal you give to us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And in return I won&#39;t throw you in prison,&quot; Sarah added. &quot;You mean detention kiddo,&quot; Bong smirked, immediately regretting the quip as Jacob glowered at her. &quot;Yeah fine I got you.&quot; Sarah now glanced at Jacob, noting the concern on his face. They had gained valuable information but judging by the look on Jacob&#39;s face she wondered if they could handle what was to come.</p>
