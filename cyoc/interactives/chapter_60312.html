<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the army charged up the spiral ramp concussion grenades rained down upon them. Shrapnel bit into their scales. Two soldiers lost their footing and went down when grenades went off directly under them. They were quickly back on their hooves following up the rear despite the black blood streaming from lacerations on their legs and under their bodies.<br />
<br />
Matt lashed out with his chains at the two hinny demons rolling the grenades down the ramp. His chains magically reeled out from his shackles a good 30 feet and wrapped their necks. Matt flicked his wrists and both demons were killed instantly as their necks were snapped. Matt grinned as he absorbed the harvested souls directly through the chains, which retracted smoothly back into the shackles. <br />
<br />
Matt felt his lance-like cock extend a foot past his forelegs once more, it’s tip a wicked hollow point. Thoughts of impaling an enemy on it thrilled him. So did the possibility of hosing down a group of enemy with his deadly acidic cum. <br />
<br />
Matt noticed a tingling on his chest and head. All the souls Matt had consumed were bringing about further changes in his body due to his increase in demonic power. As he charged his nipples pushed out into wicked two inch spikes, as additional spikes formed a crest on his head and neck, poking through his mane like an iron Mohawk. One spike for each soul harvested.<br />
<br />
The army’s charge carried them off the ramp into the main ground floor hall. Instantly they were caught in a wicked crossfire from guards in the first level side passages and a group of hinny demons with full riot gear with their backs to the fortified main doors. The defenders fired solid steel slugs into the charging mass of centroid death. The charge was halted just past the side passages due to intensive fire from the defenders at the door. The ambushers from the side passages ran out in an attempt to surround the army only to be cut down savagely from behind by the three wounded demons following in the main army’s wake. Chains ripped off heads and limbs. Souls were harvested, the energy flowing to the three commanders.<br />
<br />
Matt and  Don stood on opposite sides of the wide hallway and unleashed their breath weapons. The defenders before the door didn’t stand a chance as they were bombarded by a sonic attack and consumed by flames, Their souls flowed to their killers, the power making up for some of the wounds suffered.<br />
<br />
Even though pain was a pleasant sensation to the demons, Matt and Don knew they were hurt. Both had taken solid slugs to the chest at close range breaking scales and cracking bones beneath. As with all creatures of their adopted race the pleasure got more and more intense until death or unconsciousness. Paul immediately charged and took his turn at the front as he bellowed and rammed the flaming remains of the defenders and the sealed door at their backs. Matt and Don followed on his tail, as did the now re-grouped army.<br />
<br />
The exterior doors exploded under Paul’s assault spewing smoke, steel, and remains into the cool night air. Paul used his own breath weapon as he bellowed. A thick fog spewed from his mouth obscuring the vision of the defenders as it enveloped the charging army. While the fluorescent opaque green gas was toxic to most life demon and otherwise, his brothers and the army were immune to it’s effects.<br />
<br />
“Freedom!”, roared Matt.<br />
<br />
“Fire!”, barked Thunderhooves.<br />
<br />
The defenders on the walls and in the yard had no good targets thanks to the obscuring gas spewing from Paul. They fired into the column blindly scoring hits at random. The volume of fire was such that none escaped unscathed, but the charge was not slowed.<br />
<br />
The defenders outside the gate had a clear shot at Paul as he lead the advance. He was hit by a murderous hail of fire that would cut a lesser creature to shreds as he tore through the main gate. His left eye was shot out, and he took several shots that broke armor and penetrated flesh. <br />
<br />
“Army run left, I will cover.” Paul’s mental voice sounded almost orgasmic.<br />
<br />
“Blood and glory brother. We’ll get the others through”,  Don assured his bother who was about to sacrifice himself.<br />
<br />
“Blood and glory Paul. May you die well”, Matt responded.<br />
<br />
Paul charged straight ahead out of the main gate still spewing his toxic cloud. He ran directly at the armored SUV shielding Thunderhooves and some other defenders. The rest of the army turned left, exiting the cloud and running away from the prison.<br />
<br />
Thunderhooves rose up and fired his enchanted anti-tank weapon right at Paul. The blast sent him flying, his breath spewing a column into the air. Paul hit the ground with a meaty splat as he was knocked back to the prison gate. <br />
<br />
Incredibly he climbed to his hooves and charged once more at the SUV. Thunderhooves was shocked and only managed to dive out of the way barely in time. Paul smashed into the vehicle crushing the two defenders still sheltering behind it.<br />
<br />
Thunderhooves came up once more with his weapon and fired at Paul’s flank. This shot smashed his ruined body into the crumpled SUV. Paul lay still, barely breathing.<br />
<br />
Thunderhooves surveyed the situation. Two other lesser demons were down, in addition to this leader. Definitely not total success, but he hadn’t been skunked. “Mount up! Chase those bastards where ever they go! Kill them all!”<br />
<br />
As the combat forces scrambled to their vehicles Thunderhooves grabbed a medic and pointed at Paul.. “Make sure that thing doesn’t die! The boss has lots of questions.” Thunderhooves neglected to mention that at the moment he considered himself the boss.<br />
===============================================================<br />
<br />
Don and Matt ran at full gallop, the army keeping pace. According to the signs they were approaching the main access to the guest area. <br />
<br />
He could sense his brother Paul. He was down and barely alive. A plan formed in Matt’s mind to save him and increase their power. “Brother, we run for the guest area. Kill as many as possible. The energy will help feed Paul and keep him alive.” Don grinned and barked his assent.<br />
<br />
As they approached the camouflaged gate Matt and Don attacked it with their breath weapons. The false front burst into flames and was then blasted through by the charging warrior demons.<br />
<br />
Once among the crowds of Pleasure Island the warriors went berserk, attacking every creature in reach with chains, breath, spikes, and hooves. The corrupted crowd stampeded before the charge, with the defenders in their vehicles trying to catch up through the wreckage.<br />
<br />
Matt wasn’t sure of the death toll, but he knew his dense Mohawk of spikes reached to his tail, with spikes now fanning out across his shoulders and back. Don had acquired multiple sets of horns and now had some sprouting from his shoulders and back. They were looking more and more like dad. Many buildings were in flames. The crowd of dead, wounded, and disoriented was so thick their pursuers had fallen too far back to engage.<br />
<br />
The only problem was they were running out of island, and they were too chewed up to fight the defenders.    <br />
<br />
===============================================================================<br />
<br />
Kyle was meditating in the reception paddock. The operation to corrupt the stables of Glendale was on the home stretch. Amy was standing by the phones near the shipping corral with the last few corrupted beasts awaiting transport when a team returned. He and horse had said nothing to the others about the events on the plain of lust. Horse felt it was best not to distract from the ongoing operation.<br />
<br />
“Kyle! Buddy! It’s Matt! I need that gate now!” The unfamiliar voice growled in his consciousness. <br />
<br />
Kyle leapt to his hooves pulling the dildo from his ass. He concentrated and opened the bridge across space to the source of the contact. What he saw before him was shocking, the themed main street of Pleasure Island was burning. A few frightened humans ran through the portal quickly followed by seven monster centaurs. <br />
<br />
“Close the portal!”, the lead beast roared even as the fleeing humans were cut down with some kind of magical chain weapons.<br />
<br />
Kyle slammed the portal closed as a few bullets whizzed by and peppered the inside of the empty barn.<br />
<br />
“What the hell!?” Amy came running at a gallop towards the paddock full of monster centaurs.<br />
<br />
Matt embraced Kyle and hugged him carefully. “Thanks dude, I owe you big” Matt growled. <br />
<br />
Don also trotted over and joined the embrace. He licked Kyle in a very lupine manner. “Careful of my horns”, he cautioned.<br />
<br />
“Amy, these are my friends. They are safe.” Kyle was overcome. Two of his best friends were safe, even if he didn’t recognize them.</p>
