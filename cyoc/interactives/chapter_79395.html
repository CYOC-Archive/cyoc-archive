<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Dylan and Tina sat there confused they both began to feel extremely concerned for Wendy. What had happened? <br />
What could possibly cause something like this. Out of curiosity Dylan picked up the whoopie cushion to <br />
investigate.                                                          <br />
<br />
&quot;What just happened?&quot; Tina said with a whimper.<br />
&quot;I don't know. Maybe it has something to do with this whoopie cushion.&quot;<br />
&quot;Do you think she'll be alright? I mean...did you see her hands and feet turning into whoopie cushions too?&quot;<br />
Dylan only let out a grunt in reply. He was severely worried for Wendy, though he didn't need to say it. They both <br />
were. One thing that he didn't mention was his reason for concern. Sure their friend seemed to be turning into <br />
whoopie cushions but she was also incredibly annoying. Tina was only concerned because the situation was so weird. <br />
Dylan, on the other hand was concerned because he secretly liked her. Despite her...defining personality trait, <br />
she was beautiful.<br />
<br />
Dylan sighed a little as Tina shuffled her feet beside him. Suddenly the shuffling grew more frantic as she let <br />
out a loud yelp. Dylan immediately directed his attention to Tina who was frantically pointing at her feet and <br />
trying to hold back a scream. Slowly Dylan looked down and saw the horror. Her feet were slowing swelling up and <br />
turning a dark shade of red. It was then he noticed an odd sensation in his hands and feet. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh God...oh God! Dylan, what's happening!?.&quot;<br />
&quot;We must have received a dosage of powder when I sat on the cushion.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fear threatened to over take Dylan at that moment but he pulled himself together for the sake of Tina.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dylan...&quot;Tina whispered, &quot;do you think Jen was affected?&quot;<br />
Dylan cursed lightly under his breath. &quot;Where did she say she was going?&quot;<br />
&quot;To get help.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that they slowly got up, so as not to attract attention, and walked out towards the nurses office. Dylan was <br />
finding it increasingly difficult to walk as his feet swelled in his shoes but he had to press on. Tina was having <br />
similar issues as her feet continued to swell. As they walked her latex feet slapped loudly on the floor and all <br />
but the middle toes on her feet were absorbed. She whimperd quietly as her remaining toes lost their shape, <br />
becoming long, rubber tubes.<br />
<br />
Finally they made it to the nurses office. Just in time too because Tina's feet were starting to make farting <br />
noises. Walking in however, they found the floor littered with whoopie cushions and Jen's clothing.<br />
<br />
&quot;No not Jen too!&quot; Tina yelled<br />
&quot;Tina...look at the nurses chair&quot;<br />
<br />
She glanced over and let out a massive scream. In the chair was the nurse almost done transforming into whoopie <br />
cushions. She reached out to them and tried to say something but only a fart came out. Seconds later she fell <br />
apart. Dylan and Tina stood for a moment contemplating the situation before Tina suddenly fell over with a fart.<br />
<br />
&quot;No...please God no.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her hands were completely whoopie cushions.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dylan...I...I don't want this. I don't want to die.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dylan ignored her, focusing on his own changing hands and feet. Before it was too late he removed his shoes and <br />
socks to discover his feet had finished changing long ago. He sat down in a nearby chair to await further changes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tina, I'm afraid there's nothing we can do. I seriously have no idea what's going on.&quot;<br />
&quot;Then it's over. I may as well lye down a die. Is that what you're saying?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes&quot;<br />
<br />
With that he removed his shirt to watch the changes. As the red discoloration spread up his body it caused his <br />
legs to bulge in various places. Tina meanwhile was completely focused on her waist. Her ass was swelling and <br />
filling with air. With her whoopie cushion hands she forced her jeans and panties off to observe the change. <br />
Seeing Tina's exposed womanhood made Dylan erect but he feared it was something else causing his pecker to <br />
stiffen. He too removed his pants and underwear to expose a raging boner. Tina stared at it wishing she had seen <br />
it under different circumstances. Sometimes she fantasized about sucking his penis. How else was she supposed to <br />
entertain herself in the evening?<br />
<br />
Directing her attention back to her sex she watched the lips of her vagina swell outward as all hair in the region <br />
fell off. As pressure built behind her womanhood she began to rub herself. She figured this would be the last time <br />
after all. Suddenly air began gushing from her slit, pushing her hand away. As she stared, growing increasingly <br />
aroused, her vagina dilated and all distinguishing features of her slit, including her clit, melted away leaving <br />
behind a wide, smooth rubber tube devoid off all sexual sensation. It slowly decreased in diameter, becoming just <br />
another whoopie cushion.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile Dylan was having problems of his own. The flesh of his dick was becoming increasingly shiny and slick <br />
and as the swelling reached the base of his shaft, it suddenly went limp like a wet noodle. He reached down and <br />
tried to stimulate it but it was absolutely numb. Within seconds the head disappeared, the hole widened <br />
significantly, and it turned a bright red. It let out a final jet of air, causing another farting noise.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Dylan, I guess this is it.&quot; Tina exclaimed as her breasts began to change shape under her shirt. Her voice <br />
was becoming extremely weak as her lungs ceased to function. As her elongating nipples pressed tightly against her <br />
shirt she let out one final breath, in the form of a cart.<br />
<br />
Dylan watched as her arms and torso began bulging in various places. As each bulb began to separate from her body <br />
Dylan closed his eyes and waited for the same to happen to him. He didn't wait long. Within moments he lost all <br />
feeling below his neck and he felt his face beginning to melt away. With his final moments he opened his eyes and <br />
looked at Tina. Suddenly he wanted to scream because as Tina faded away, she was blowing mass amounts of that <br />
transformative powder into the ventilation system.</p>
