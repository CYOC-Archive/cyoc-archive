<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Martin, why are you naked?” A mix of amusement and puzzlement crossed Sam&#39;s face, the lizardwoman rubbing her head in discomfort from it&#39;s impact moments before. Your serpentine gaze locks with a familiar pair of black briefs and a silver hoodie in a pile, a thick blush coming across your face, although that feeling fades. “You scared me for a second. If I didn&#39;t know any better, I&#39;d say you looked like that bastard dragon.” <br />
<br />
Tensing up at Sam&#39;s casual remark, your eyes drop to the brown eagle splayed on the floor in a puddle of his own seed; Tyson. The eagle&#39;s firm and muscled belly is bloated from your seed, which you had clearly forced him to consume through domination.<br />
<br />
Domination. The word seemed so foreign to you. How could you commit such an act? Was he even okay? What if you hurt him? Didn&#39;t you throw Jessie away? Your questions were halted as Alex suddenly brought you into a hug, resulting in loud squeaking that echoed throughout the hall. You could feel the tiger&#39;s gratitude exerted from his large muscular arms.<br />
<br />
“You <i>saved</i> Tyson, Martin!” A surprised hiss escaped your lips as the white tiger suddenly licked your cheek, obliviously catching a tear. Whether it from your guilt or how Alex was almost choking you was beyond your comprehension.<br />
<br />
“<i>Saved</i>.”<br />
<br />
You were being thanked for committing such a heinous crime.<br />
<br />
You force a smile as Alex releases you. Sam lay on her knees beside Tyson, checking his breathing. Glancing over to you curiously, she brings a hand to her lower jaw. “I don&#39;t see a trace of yellow goop anywhere on the floor. You forced it <i>all</i> down his throat?” A hesitant nod made her grin. “Well, at least his gag reflex had some exercise. Good job snake boy, proof you&#39;re stronger than you look.”<br />
<br />
Jessie comes up to examine her unconscious latexified friend. Although she keeps her distance. <br />
<br />
To them it may have been because of the latex. <br />
<br />
To you, it was because of <i>you</i>.<br />
<br />
“Is Tyson alright?” The girl&#39;s eyes were filled with concern. A nod and thumbs up from Alex reassured her. “Thanks to Martin of course. I didn&#39;t expect his muscles to actually grow though…”<br />
<br />
As if on cue, a loud cough escaped the birdman&#39;s yellow beak, his golden eyes fluttered open, no longer filled with the stupidity of a jock. Sam rises up to give him space, which Alex fails to provide as he hastily drops to his knees. “Tyson! You&#39;re awake! It&#39;s me, Alex!” The tiger shouted in joy, gently nudging his friend&#39;s thick arm. <br />
<br />
Tyson&#39;s head slowly turned, his predatory bird-like eyes meeting the feral yet kind eyes of Alex.<br />
<br />
“<i>Allleex…</i>?” Alex wasted no time in helping his friend sit, grinning happily. The eagle seemed to have struggle speaking, his speech slurred. “Allleex… Wai are yuu… A white tigurrr?” Alex&#39;s expression turned solemn, although his toothy grin remains. <br />
<br />
“My friend saved me by turning me into this. If he didn&#39;t I would&#39;ve become some draconic sex toy. Maybe even a clone… But I&#39;m fine! And so is Jessie, and she&#39;s still human!” The tiger excitedly gestures to both you and her.<br />
<br />
“...Hi Tyson…” She struggles to say. “I&#39;m glad to see you&#39;re okay.” The brown eagle shakes his head, bringing a yellow talon-like hand to his face. “Ugh…” Sam smiles serenely, slightly chuckling. <br />
<br />
The hall falls silent, although a slightly pleasant aroma seemed to drift into it, unnoticed by all...<br />
<br />
“Hey Alex…”<br />
<br />
“Yeah?”<br />
<br />
“Why am I naked?” The eagle asks, his speech no longer slurred, as if sobering up. Alex giggles childishly. “Uh… Don&#39;t worry about it.” It seemed as if Tyson had no memory to any events before being given your essence. He seemed unusually calm too, even as he curiously flexs his talons.<br />
<br />
Jessie&#39;s gaze falls to Tyson&#39;s avian “equipment.” Quickly diverting her gaze to her feet, she remembered the clothing around her neck. Grinning, she held up the black shorts and tank top. “I&#39;ve got a cure for what ails you, Tyson!” The eagle&#39;s beak opened in protest, but was ignored as Alex helped him to his taloned feet. <br />
<br />
“I wake up as a naked eagle made out of latex only to be playing dress up with the <i>worst</i> fashionista in town…” A hearty laugh from Alex caused Tyson to jump, his beak twisted into a frown as the white feline loudly pats his avian friend on the back. Jessie&#39;s mischievous grin only widens. After stepping out of the puddle of latex, Jessie excitedly holds up the black set of clothing to his face.<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m not wearing those! Do I look like a meathead to you?” Jessie giggles, pointing to Tyson&#39;s muscled physique. His eyes widen in shock, experimentally flexing his biceps. “What? When the hell did I work out so much?” <br />
<br />
“Looking pretty good, <i>‘bro.’</i>” Alex snickers as Tyson blushed furiously. “Oh shut it.” He begrudgingly lifts one foot, before doing the same for the opposite to let Jessie slip on the black gym shorts. “I can do it myself you know.” She glares at him before pointing to his taloned hands.<br />
<br />
“Right.” He remarks flatly. Jessie&#39;s eyes look away as she reaches the eagle&#39;s crotch, her face a thick shade of red. The thick musk of latex excited her slightly, although she ignored it.<br />
<br />
Breathing a sigh of relief, she backs away and gives a thumbs up. Tyson scowls in return, poking at the shorts with his claws. “You didn&#39;t get any underwear.” <br />
<br />
“Does it matter as long you have something covering your dong?” The teen chortles as he lowers his head in defeat. Tossing him the black tank top, the eagle holds it up in disdain. “Are you trying to embarrass me? Why&#39;d you choose such revealing clothing? Alex&#39;s t-shirt barely even fits him and that lizard isn&#39;t even wearing a shirt under her jacket!” Sam gives a devious grin at his statement before looking back at you.<br />
<br />
“Well, at least you&#39;re wearing clothes now, unlike a certain naughty serpent who takes his clothes off to dominate.” Tyson glances at you curiously before shutting his eyes in repulsiveness. Your attempts to conceal your members with your hands fails to do much.<br />
<br />
She chuckles as she struts up to you, placing a clawed finger on your chest and slowly tracing it down, stopping just above your crotch. Ignoring your nervous hissing, she gives you a sly wink before bringing up a familiar pair of boxer briefs. <br />
<br />
Snatching them, you quickly slide them past your large feet, but Sam interrupts you. “Someone&#39;s going to have to lift that tail of yours, snake boy.” You cover your face in mortification, completely forgetting your previous worries as a new fear overwhelmed you.<br />
<br />
Grasping the tip of your tail, she sensually caresses it, before bringing it through the hole in the clothing. After a few moments the boxer briefs were firmly attached to your waist. Sam winks as she eyes your backside. You hiss quietly as you remember her words from when she first helped you put on the clothing.<br />
<br />
“I must say Martin, for a male your rear almost matches mine.” You bury your serpentine face into the silver hoodie in utter mortification as she loudly declares her “observations.” Her chuckling is joined by the laughs of Alex and Jessie, now having discovered your “secret.” <br />
<br />
Tyson&#39;s grumbles join your sheepish hisses as he fidgets with the very loose black top. He frowns as it barely even covers his pecs. “Jessie, you planned all of this out, didn&#39;t you?” She giggles mischievously once again. <br />
<br />
“You haven&#39;t changed one bit…” She giggles more, but within her eyes you catch a hint of sadness.<br />
<br />
Everyone else has changed, while she hasn&#39;t.<br />
<br />
The mortification you had felt shifted into remorse for your earlier actions. Tyson had been saved but at what cost?<br />
<br />
But did it matter…? Tyson was <i>here</i> and <i>safe</i>! Jessie and Alex were grateful… <br />
<br />
You shook your head.<br />
<br />
<i>So what</i> if you needed to take questionable actions? In the end, you succeeded in saving him… As long as they&#39;re saved, why should they be mad?</p>
