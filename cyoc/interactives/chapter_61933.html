<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Once out of the door Jenny saw the bus getting ready to leave. Quickly she bolted to the bus yelling and waving her arms so she could get the drivers attention. She heard the comforting sounds of the busses air brake being put back in and the door swinging open so she could get on. As soon as she got on the bus she scouted the seats on the bus to find her friends she was going to sit with. While the bus driver got ready to leave again.<br />
<br />
 Finally she spotted Vanessa sitting in the very back of the bus looking out the window, she walked over as the bus started to move and sat next to her and said “Hey Vanessa, how are you doing?” she looks away from the window and yawns then says” Hey Jenny, I am good just really tired and I am not exited for our P.E. class this early in the morning though.” Jenny thought and remembered that they would be starting their swimming unit. And was dreading it as well but for some reason she didn’t know why she didn’t want to do it. She shrugged it off and they then went back to talking tell they arrived at school.<br />
<br />
As jenny and Vanessa walked through the school talking a scrawny and geeky guy holding his books for class bumped in to her. he started to apologies but jenny dismissed his apology like it was nothing and pushed him into the lockers making him drop all of his books saying “out of my way you little geek. You just interrupted my conversation with a dear friend”. Then they continued on their way to the locker rooms to the sound of people laughing at the unlucky teen scrambling to pick up all his books.<br />
<br />
In the locker room jenny and Vanessa parted ways so they could get their swimsuits on. Jenny pulled out a neon pink one piece from her backpack it was her only swimsuit she had that was actually school appropriate. As she pulled it on she made her way out to the pool. Walking through the doorway leading to the pool she was hit with a strong smell of chlorine and saw the water, immediately she felt like she needed to get in that water it wasn’t a want it was a need and the longer she waited the more she needed to get in the pool, also her swimsuit began to feel like it was getting tighter by the second she pulled at it trying to get some relief but to no avail. She saw her class sitting on the bleachers talking. Then out of nowhere her body started to get hotter but only around the swimsuit it became unbearable and she decided that it was an emergency and pulled her swimsuit off her as fast as she could.<br />
<br />
Throwing her swimsuit away from her she quickly felt her skin cool down. but the need for the pool only grew, she took a shaky step towards the bleachers covering herself up so that no one could see her nudity, but surprisingly no one seemed to be looking at her in anyway. Looking back at the water she could see its stillness like no one has been in it and felt the need grow again. She quickly jumped in the water and could feel a sense of fulfillment. She came up to top of the water and could only see one person looking at her it was a geek Kyle Perkins watching her with a smile from ear to ear. She screamed “what the hell is going on right now”.<br />
<br />
Only to feel a tingling starting at her ears; she reached up and felt them, though they didn’t change size they started flatten out but got wavy then  the rest of the skin started to shrink into her head and soon there was no ear canal there was just a fin on either side of her head. Though she could still hear it was just a little bit muffed now. Then her cheeks started to tingle she touched them but couldn’t feel any difference but any on looker would notice a little sparkle on her cheeks and less on the rest of her face but a sparkle like there was a fine coating of glitter on her face. Then the tingling moved down her neck and got stronger just below her breasts she looked down and couldn’t tell what was going on below her breasts but noticed a slight glitter sparkle on her skin around her breasts. the tingling continued down her body tell it got to her hands which she watched in horror as some of her skin from each finger started to connect with its self making her fingers webbed to her first knuckle then she noticed the tingling getting stronger at her back she reached back and could feel three bumps growing about an inch above her hip the middle bump grew to about three inches while the other two on either side grew to two inches. <br />
<br />
Jenny freaking out decided that it was the water doing this to her so she started to climb out of the water. Just after she got her breasts above water she felt it harder to breathe, she could still breathe but it felt like she was breathing through a small straw. She finished climbing out of the pool and still felt the changes continue but noticed some skin moving that she didn’t see before. She examined it and realized she had gills now just below her breasts.<br />
<br />
Looking back at her class they just continued to chat and the teacher Mrs. Wilson was now trying to get them to pay attention so she could start the lesson. Jenny started to plead to them to help her but no one but Kyle even looked her way, not even Vanessa.  Finding it hard to breath she got back in the water and could breathe again. She looked down and saw scales making their way down her legs. They looked all different shades of pink. About mid way down her thigh she felt like her legs needed to be together, so she put her legs together and immediately they started to combine from her mid thigh down leaving both her butt and vagina and some space to get between them. Then finally she felt her feet form her bottom fin. It was like a dolphin’s tail fin but pink. Finally she felt the tingling subside. She swam up to the edge of the water to see if anyone noticed and found…</p>
