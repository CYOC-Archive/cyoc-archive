<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Amelia slowly swam back to consciousness. At first she thought that she was being held by a doll, but then she blinked and saw that what she thought to be a doll, was in fact her sister. Sitting up, she asked Anna, &quot;Are we dolls?&quot;<br />
<br />
Anna looked at her and replied, &quot;I don't know. I think we might be be, but I'm unsure. If I look at you just right way, you appear to be a doll that someone can pose. What I do know for sure is that we appear to be inside my doll house, though how we got here, that's a complete mystery to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking around, Amelia asked, &quot;Is this kitchen bigger or is it just me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Anna looked around and then said, &quot;The kitchen is bigger. The house appears to be in some sort of, I don't know, transformation. Just before I came in here, the foyer changed before me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amelia nodded at this and began making her way to one of the two doors that led out of the kitchen and into the house. Out in the hallway, she stopped and Anna almost ran into her. Looking up and down the hall, Anna commented, &quot;This was not here when I went to find out who was screaming. This was the foyer.&quot;<br />
<br />
As she said this, Amelia opened the door in front of her and both girls could see the foyer, now larger and more elegant. Not having anything to say about it, Anna merely reached out and shut the door. Looking at her sister, she asked the other girl, &quot;Any idea on how to get out of here and return to our normal size?&quot; who merely replied that they should first try exploring this area before anything else and began wandering down the hallway.<br />
<br />
Not liking these turn of events, Anna thought Amelia had the right idea and figuring it was probably there best way to not only see how they got into this mess, but there also might be a solution to their problem, followed after.<br />
<br />
-------<br />
Jon was worried. Currently he was sitting on the toilet in the women's restroom. Before him he could see his penis, hard and throbbing, sticking out past the hem on the skirt.<br />
<br />
This was a problem because Jon had never had a real hard-on like this; the closest being when he had pleasured Frank. Even back then his penis, and testicles, really hadn't grown in years and had always looked like a prepubescent boy's. In fact, it had become such a problem to grasp his shaft to pee, that Jon had taken to sitting down to pee like a girl about two years ago.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wonder if this has anything to do with the vitamins Cindy has been giving me,&quot; he thought. &quot;After all, boys, as far as I know, don't have breasts or start growing any when they're about twelve years old.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jon lifted up his skirt, briefly wondered if maybe he'd taken all this to far and then reached up and pulled down his pink panties.<br />
<br />
Taking off the bikini briefs, Jon balled them up and stuffed them into a pocket on his book bag. Lifting up his skirt, briefly noting the tampons lying on the floor - &quot;Why'd I buy those,&quot; Jon thought, remembering how he'd purchased three sanitary napkins when he ran into the bathroom not eight minutes ago - and as the cramped, bloated feeling in his lower abdomen and groin continued to grow, he watched as his penis began to change.<br />
<br />
At first it stayed hard, but then began to grow flaccid as it started to turn red. And the redder it got, the more flaccid and smaller it got. Before his very eyes, Jon watched as first his penis and then his testicles shrank and then disappeared. Seeing only flat skin, he suddenly felt a sharp stinging sensation from between his legs.<br />
<br />
Scared, Jon reached down and pulled from his bag a compact mirror for applying blush to his cheeks, for whenever he wore make-up. Opening it, he slid the mirror out and after a few tries, he managed to hold it between his legs so he could see what was happening.<br />
<br />
Reflected back, Jon watched as the area split open in a pink gash and the lips major and minor formed. As the clitoris and clitoris hood formed and Jon developed a slight camel toe, he sat back on the toilet. Not even looking at the mirror, knowing what he'll see, Jon commented in a high, feminine voice, &quot;Great! I've turned into a girl. What the heck is going on here?&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking down at the mirror, Jon gasped as he saw a couple tiny droplets of blood on the reflective device. Scared, but knowing what was happening because he'd been taught in health class how a girl's body went through puberty, Jon reached down for one of the tampons laying next to the book bag.<br />
<br />
Fumbling, Jon opened the plastic like paper and placing the device between her legs, holding it slightly at an angle and leaning forward slightly, she slid the sanitary napkin into her new formed vagina, unaware as her hips and waist shifted sex and gender, while her butt tightened up and grew smaller.<br />
<br />
Ashamed for some reason, wanting to cry, flooded suddenly with a wave of emotions, Jon, now fully Joy, reached down and pulled her panties back out of the book bag. Pulling them back on, not sure if she liked the way they pressed into her crotch, she picked up the rest of the tampons, put them in her bag and left the stall. Her first stop was the dispenser, where she purchased a couple more tampons and then deciding she wanted to talk to Nurse Brenda, Joy left the restroom - dropping the mirror in the garbage on her way out.<br />
<br />
-------<br />
Amelia and Anna were hopelessly lost. Not only had the house continued to grow and change before them, but also there was the way things looked one way and then when the girl's turned, they were either gone or remade to look like something else all together.<br />
<br />
Tired and worn out from there endless searching, finding nothing that would offer some sort of relief, Amelia and Anna eventually found themselves inside a bedroom. Saying nothing, the girls stripped off their clothes and dropping them on the floor, both climbed into the bed. Before falling asleep, Anna said, &quot;We'll find an answer tomorrow.&quot; From Amelia, she got no answer, but the gentle rhythm of one who'd fallen' asleep. Yawning, Anna joined her sister and within minutes, she to slept.</p>
