<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Molly awoke to the cries of her unhappy 4 year old.  He was sitting upright.<br />
<br />
“Poor baby, what’s wrong?”<br />
<br />
“Ba, ab ab ab bad”<br />
<br />
Molly seemed to just grasp what he was saying.  “Did you have a bad dream?”<br />
<br />
Continuing to cry, he just reached out to be held.<br />
<br />
One arm wrapped around his body the other under his bottom, Molly once again felt a sopping wet diaper.  She stood up to more easily comfort her little man.<br />
<br />
Jasper felt like he was losing control.  I’m a grown man, why am I acting this way.  I don’t need a mommy to hold me just because…… he stopped himself mid thought.  Molly isn’t his mommy. How is she holding me like this? Then he remembered the bean.  <br />
<br />
Molly noticed that Jasper had settled down a bit and figured it was time to move things along.  “Let’s get the icky diaper changed.” With that Molly put on her robe and took him off to the bathroom to change him.<br />
<br />
Jasper was not yet completely adapted to this moment and his self-image was strained when he caught sight of himself as diapered little boy in the bathroom mirror as he was being put down for a diaper change.<br />
<br />
“Here you go baby” as Molly slid a pacifier into Jasper’s mouth before putting him down on the changing mat.  <br />
<br />
Jasper was confused, this should be over, he thought, what’s going on? I’ve had enough, when is this nightmare going to end?<br />
<br />
Molly was speaking to him in a singsong little voice reserved for babies.  “Now first mommy needs to lift your little legs, such cute little legs, and carefully remove these plastic pants.  Can you stay still for mommy while she does that?, yes you can, oh yes you can.”  <br />
<br />
He was conflicted with being talked to like he was a baby, it was so stupid, but still, somehow, it made him feel special.  It was making him feel loved.  He couldn’t hold back his emotions and found himself starting to smile.  <br />
<br />
Molly noticed everything as she carefully managed to unpin his diaper.  She was filled with joy as she saw the smile beneath the pacifier.  “That’s my happy baby.” Molly said as she gave Jasper’s tummy a little tickle.<br />
<br />
This elicited the expected giggle from him.  It was virtually indistinguishable from the cute little giggles of a toddler. <br />
<br />
The newly minted Mother and son were having another bonding moment.<br />
<br />
Molly, tweaked Jasper’s nose “who’s a good baby? yes you are, yes you are, yes you are.”  The laughter and giggling continued.<br />
<br />
Jasper felt the wipes, but was so entertained throughout the change that he hardly fixated on his plight.  Dirty diaper removed, wiped bottom cleaned, new diaper affixed, done. <br />
<br />
Jasper was now a very happy little boy.  <br />
<br />
Mommy stood her good little boy up on the changing pad where he stood, all smiles, now suckling his pacifier without a care in the world.<br />
<br />
Jasper loved his mommy and wanted her to pick him up so he could hug her.   <br />
<br />
It was still early in the morning and Molly was still tired.  Rather than stand there and hold Jasper, Molly walked them down to the couch put on the TV to a cartoon show and sat holding her baby boy.<br />
<br />
Jasper was not as interested in the tv as he was in Molly’s breasts.  He couldn’t take his eyes off of them.  Though he was suckling on his binky, a bit of drool was falling around the sides of his mouth and dripping.<br />
<br />
Molly finally noticed Jasper’s fixation.  Her breast ached all the time.  She had assumed she could just wait out the rest of her time, but knew what Jasper wanted.<br />
<br />
“Does baby need to nurse?”<br />
<br />
Jasper hadn’t connected his behavior with his primal need.  He blushed at Molly’s words.<br />
<br />
“Oh baby, it’s okay, most infants need to nurse.”<br />
<br />
Jasper couldn’t stop blushing.  His wife/mommy just called him and infant and he actually felt like one.  The binkie fell from his open mouth and he reached his hands out in a grabby manner to Molly’s breasts and mewed “Mama….mama”<br />
<br />
“Let mama check your diaper first” Molly just totally manipulated the little guy to reach into his pants to check him, finding him dry she proclaimed “good baby you are still dry.”  Then repositioned him, cradling him on her lap to nurse.<br />
<br />
Jasper once again began suckling, taking to it like a pro. <br />
<br />
After a time, Molly once again switched him to the other nipple after he had made his way through the first.<br />
<br />
Again, not long after the switch, Jasper squirmed in his mama&#39;s arms. Noticing this, Molly was once again amused at how he had embraced this infantile roll.  She then moved her free hand to the back of his diaper. The padding was becoming damp. Once again her baby soon lifted his bottom and began pushing a mess out, filling his seat entirely. Molly just smiled and returned to rubbed the back of Jasper&#39;s head gently. <br />
<br />
Jasper was embracing his infantile role, either indifferent or completely oblivious to the accident, even smiling as he continued to nurse while pooping his diaper. <br />
<br />
Molly once again pressed her hand against the diaper&#39;s seat to get an idea of how bad the accident had been, as she wondered if her big boy might be regressing further. The soft, poopy mass squished as Molly pressed on it.  Molly hugged her stinky little guy.<br />
<br />
Jasper was so peaceful, that Molly wasn’t even sure he noticed when he finished nursing and repositioned him vertically for being burped.  He stir a bit as he spit up a small amount of milk then settled into a heavy slumber.<br />
<br />
Jasper was like dead weight.  Asleep, totally unphased by the mass of crap clinging to his bottom.  <br />
<br />
Molly had a choice and went with let sleeping babies lie.<br />
<br />
She spread out a receiving blanket and laid him out on his stomach in front of the tv.  For her part, she stretch out and slept on the couch.</p>
