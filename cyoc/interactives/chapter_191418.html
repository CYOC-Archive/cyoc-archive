<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">(Authors Note: I am changing the ages of these characters. I don’t want to write fetish shit about characters that are supposed to be 12 years old.<br />
Carter is 17 and Penny & Scarlett are both 15.<br />
That’s all, please enjoy.)<br />
<br />
Scarlett sat, scrolling through her phone. Wasting time.<br />
<br />
She knew she was procrastinating and she could be doing literally anything else. But today was just… boring.<br />
Nothing exciting had happened. Nothing interesting. Just boringly plain. She wasn’t even in the mood to hang out with her best friend, Penny.<br />
<br />
Scarlett continued to scroll through her phone. It was bland, no one was out partying. No one was doing anything interesting. She was ready to die from boredom.<br />
She scratched her chest and immediately noticed something.<br />
Scarlett was one of the more popular girls in her class, as was Penny. Both girls were around the same height, however Scarlett had a clear difference from her best friend. Her chest. For a girl still developing, they were significantly larger than her classmates. So when she looked down, she didn’t expect to see them deflating like a balloon!?<br />
<br />
She quickly sat up on her bed and stared as her breasts shrank more and more,<br />
“NO!!” She screamed, grabbing at her them and failing to truly grasp their mass. In the span of just a few seconds, her double D’s were looking more like B’s. They looked like they could’ve been Penny’s size as this rate, “How did…” she questioned, terrified that they may completely disappear. She knew her parents were rich, so at the right age she always just get implants, but if they got too small it might be too difficult to get back to her original size. But that was far from the problem.<br />
<br />
As she stared at the much smaller chest, between her much wider cleavage (if you could even call it that) she noticed something else.<br />
She was wearing a tank top and shorts that she’d thrown on when she got home from school.<br />
She noticed that her stomach was starting to bloat.<br />
“Nothing else! Please!!” She screamed in agony as everything she valued was disappearing. Her appearance.<br />
<br />
She could only watch as her belly bloated. Larger and larger. And it wasn’t a pregnancy bump, this was real fat. She could even feel love handles beginning to develop. Her slim figure disappearing by the second. She finally pushed herself off of her bed, which was slightly more difficult due to her weight increase. And it wasn’t stopping.<br />
<br />
By the time she reached her wall mirror, the damage was beyond repair. Her belly was pushing her tank top up, causing her belly button to begin poking underneath. She watched her thighs under her shorts start bloating. She wouldn’t stop growing. She placed her hand on her face and could feel a secondary chin developing, like a pocket of fat.<br />
<br />
Then, out of no where, she saw her nose start growing. It didn’t last as long as her weight increase, but her nose quickly grew significantly larger. It reminded her of her mother’s nose. She’d been lucky with genetics, inheriting a cute nose from her Dad, and missed out on the large ears belonging to her mom. But now, she even noticed her ears growing. It was like…<br />
<br />
“I’m becoming my MOM!?” She yelled, terrified. Her worst nightmare was coming true. She stared at herself in the mirror, watching as her belly button got more and squished. <br />
The only thing she inherited from her mother was her curves, and now even they were disappearing. It was like she was becoming an overweight version of her own mother!<br />
<br />
Her lips started to widen and thicken, but not in an attractive way. Not to mention her eyes shrunk a little.<br />
She had noticed that her whole body was starting to age. She was cycling through year after year, maybe even decade! From 15 years old, she suddenly aged to around 40, her Mom’s age!<br />
She didn’t even have the chance to mature. She simply began to sag.<br />
<br />
Her now almost non-existent breasts began sag, her whole body started to wrinkle a little, especially on her face. Her belly looked like it’d been folded over 50 different times. Her legs, her arms…<br />
<br />
She stood there, tears running down her face… she had become exactly what she wanted to avoid.<br />
Her Mom.<br />
<br />
Finally, her transformation came to an end. She looked vaguely like herself, but almost 30 years older, fatter, much less curvy, and with half her mom’s worst features.<br />
<br />
She stood, looking at herself in the mirror. Crying at how hideous she was.<br />
She fell to her knees, and began to cry loudly, almost like a baby.<br />
She was on the brink of a tantrum before she heard a familiar voice.<br />
<br />
“Woow…” Penny said, clapping. Slowly,<br />
“P-Penny!” Scarlett panicked, trying to cover her body which was unsuccessful considering even her clothes couldn’t do that, “I don’t know what happened… but you have to believe me! I’m Scarlett!!” She tried to explain, knowing her best friend is typically sceptical of most things,<br />
“You really are dumb…” Penny said, belittling her friend, “make her feet bigger!” She said, enthusiastically,<br />
“W-what…” Scarlett said, confused by the comment. Then suddenly, she looked at her feet.<br />
They were growing.<br />
<br />
“How did you do that!” She looked at her best friend with fear, “and make it stop!!” She screamed,<br />
“Alright, alright,” Penny said, twirling her hand, indicating to stop the change. And just like that, it did.<br />
<br />
Scarlett’s socks felt very tight on her increased feet, but she was relieved that it stopped. She tried to figure out what shoe size she would’ve been now, adding to her brand new list of insecurities.<br />
<br />
“Wait…” she realised, looking at Penny, “YOU did this!!” She yelled, quickly pointing at her friend, causing her arm to jiggle with fat.<br />
“Obviously!” She replied, laughing. Then looked to face… no one, “oh right. I guess she’s the one who changed you, but I had all the ideas,” she laughed.<br />
“What are… who are you talking to..?” Scarlett asked, a little scared,<br />
“Her…” Penny replied, pointing towards absolutely nothing,<br />
“P-Penny…” Scarlett started, “there’s no one th-there…” she mentioned.<br />
<br />
“Oh that’s right!!” Penny said, realising her mistake, “Quinn, make yourself visible to Scarlett,” she said.<br />
Suddenly, a woman appeared, standing next to Penny. She was a little over average height with a very decent figure. She had bright blue hair and pink lips. She wore some kind of strange one-piece dress… she couldn’t figure out how she would’ve gotten it over her body. The she realised, this woman had just appeared out of nowhere!<br />
“Ahh!!” She screamed,<br />
“Shhh!!” Penny quickly shushed her friend, “alright lets to back to my house,” she stated,<br />
“All three of us?” Quinn asked,<br />
“Yep,”<br />
<br />
“What the hell do you mean—”</p>
