<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You put on the headphones. Instantly, you hear some intense insrtumental music flow through your ears. You recognize it, its from the latest RPG you played. You sat back into your seat, smiling and closing your eyes, thinking back to that game. It was so much fun. You then thought to how much you loved video games in general. New memories were flowing into your head, and your body began to change.<br />
<br />
First of all, your body began to get smaller. Much smaller. You lost inches upon inches as you dwindled down. The client had specified specifically that he wanted his gamer girl to be small, petite, insecure. Of course, you didn&#39;t mind. As you reached your final size of 4&#39;8, you didnt notice anything wrong, even though you were now covered in clothes much too big for you.<br />
<br />
The music switched to another song, this time from Overwatch, and you smiled. You thought about all the late night, staying up until 3 am playing your favorite game. Nothing made you happier. As you smiled, your lips grew tiny, getting smaller and daintier. You eyes seemed to grow a bit larger, and changed into a lovely greenish-blue color. Your face rounded out and smoothed, all facial hair falling off. Your face looked like that of a young girl. However, the changed to your head weren&#39;t done. Your hair grew longer, turning a dark black. It fell down to your shoulders. Messy and unkept, but in a very cute way. Honestly, you couldnt be bothered to make your hair all nice, that would take away from game time! Plus you always thought your messy hair looked pretty, in its own way.<br />
<br />
The music changes again, and you hear a familiar tune. The main theme to Skyrim. You smile again, remembering all the adventures you had with the game and its mods. You reach your hands up to adjust the headphones. Your hands became slimmer, daintier and smooth as they touched the headphones, though you did not notice. Your arms quickly followed. Your clothes also showed signs of changes, the shirt turning green with black sleeves, it configured itself to your new frame. Despite being your new size, the shirt still hung slightly loosely on you. The right side drooped down slightly, exposing your now smooth and rounded shoulder on one side. Again, giving you a messy yet cute look. You pants shrunk down, growing smaller and tighter until you had a pair of plain red shorts on.<br />
<br />
As the next song came on, you were lost in a trance. You leaned back on the chair, and to your surpised, it went back with you, reclining like a car seat. Weird. Wanting to get comfortable, you kicked your shoes off. The things came flying off. You looked to your feet. The socks you had on earlier simply vanished. Your feet began to shrink, losing any hair and getting daintier and daintier, shrinking down to a womans 6. Very petite and small. You wiggled your toes a bit and leaned back, kicking your bare feet onto the table. The store owners likely wouldn&#39;t like that, but you didn&#39;t care. You were so comfy you could just fall asleep here. Besides, you knew some guys were into feet, so who knows, you might be giving someone a treat here. The rest of your legs began to change. They grew longer and smooth. You thighs plumped up very slightly, leaving you with some very womanly legs. You crossed them over one another in a very feminine way.<br />
<br />
As you adjusted in your seat, you feet something strange within your shorts. Your butt began to get much more round and squishy. it grew larger and plumper, until it felt as though you were sitting on a cushion. Your expanding rear began to tighten the already tight shorts. You squirmed in your seat again, adjusting yourself to your now rounded rear. Your hips also began to expand slightly, tightening the shorts almost to the point of tearing. They weren&#39;t too large, neither your hips or your butt, though just enough to leave you with a modest girlish figure. Down below, you felt your manhood recede into your body. You were now a girl where it counts.<br />
<br />
Your final changes then began. Your chest began to itch, and began to expand. Nothing too dramatic though. In a few seconds you had a modest pair of little B cups. Your waist began to recede, adding to the tiny curves your now feminine hips gave you. Your stomach grew flat and smooth. The changes had completed. Where you once sat was now a petite, short gamer girl, with messy hair and emerald eyes. Finished with the music, you got up from your seat. You picked your shoes off the ground. Behind you, you noticed a mirror you swore was not there before. You walked barefoot over to the mirror. There you were in the reflection.<br />
<br />
You were very short, the shortest girl in your class. You were never made fun of, really, though all the other girls just thought you were adorable. With your rather small breasts and curves and messy hair, no boys ever showed interest in you. You had a personality to match your body as well. You were rather shy and reserved, and sat in the back on the classroom all the time. You didn&#39;t really have any friends, but that was fine with you. You had your video games. They made you happy, and if you ever found someone who shared your interest, you would break out of your shell and begin talking. Unfortunately, most people at your school dont seem to have any interest in the subject.<br />
<br />
But why were you here? Oh, thats right, your date. You remember the note you found in your locker, decorated with hearts and such, asking you to meet someone named &quot;Nick&quot; here. Apparently, he also has an interest in video games. You looked down to your feet, wiggling your toes and swaying back and forth in excitement. if....if he liked you....and you liked him. You blushed and smiled at the idea that you could have a boyfriend. You decide its about time to put your shoes back on, and you slip your dainty feet into the sneakers, not bothering to tie them up. You then walk to the front of the store, where your new boyfriend is waiting</p>
