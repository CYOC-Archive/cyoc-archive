<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Timmy stood towering over what was left of the house, his massive body heaving as his chest rose and fell. The sheer scale of his presence outside in the open air was overwhelming, every inch of his now-15-foot frame exuding raw power. Jamie, standing a few feet away, could feel the weight of his younger brother’s presence pressing down on him, the sheer size and masculinity almost suffocating. But there was something else that demanded Jamie’s attention—Timmy’s massive cock, jutting out like a battering ram, curving slightly upward and pulsing with obscene vitality.<br />
<br />
Timmy’s monstrous 30-inch cock throbbed, its angry purple glans slick with pre-cum that dripped in heavy ropes onto the ground below. His massive balls churned audibly, the tension in his body growing unbearable. Timmy’s deep, rumbling voice broke the tense silence. “Jamie... I... I can’t hold it anymore...” he groaned, his massive hands reaching down to grip his cock. The veins snaking along its girthy length bulged even further as his fingers wrapped around it, stroking with powerful, deliberate movements.<br />
<br />
“Timmy, no!” Jamie cried out, panic lacing his voice as he watched his younger brother’s body tense and shudder with arousal.  At this point, Jamie didn&#39;t fully understand how the pill had effected his little brother but one trend seemed to be making itself clear to Jamie. It seemed like orgasms had a high likelihood of triggering growth spurts. They really needed to get to Charlie to get his help, ASAP. But right now Jamie had a much more immediate concern.  The blood was draining from his face as he watched his brother continue to pump, “I don’t think this is a good idea!”<br />
<br />
But Timmy wasn’t listening. The overwhelming sensations coursing through his body had taken control, the flood of testosterone and hormones drowning out any rational thought. His moans grew louder, more guttural, each stroke of his massive cock causing his body to tremble with barely contained power.<br />
<br />
“Ohhh... Jamie... I... I can’t stop...” Timmy gasped, guilt and pleasure written on his face, his massive frame quaking as his stroking grew faster and more intense. His enormous balls churned violently, swelling even larger as they prepared to release the torrent building within.<br />
<br />
Jamie’s heart raced as he backed away, his instincts screaming at him to run, but he couldn’t tear his eyes away from the terrifying display of raw masculinity in front of him. Timmy’s moans reached a deafening roar as his entire body tensed, every muscle flexing and veins bulging to the surface. And then it happened.<br />
<br />
“UUUUUHHHHHHHHHH!!!” Timmy bellowed, his cock erupting with a force that defied comprehension. The first thick rope of cum shot out like a cannonball, slamming into Jamie with enough force to send him flying 10 feet backward. Jamie landed with a thud, completely drenched in the hot, sticky fluid, gasping for air as the sheer volume overwhelmed him.<br />
<br />
The ground trembled beneath Timmy as his orgasm continued, wave after wave of thick, creamy cum shooting out in unstoppable torrents. Each burst was accompanied by a guttural groan from Timmy, his towering body quivering with pleasure. The earth beneath him was quickly saturated, streams of cum pooling around his massive feet as his climax finally began to subside.<br />
<br />
As the fog of carnal pleasure dissipated from Timmy&#39;s brain and he started to realize what happened. Scanning the ground beneath him, he spotted a little figure several feet away, completely covered from head to toe in his cum. Timmy felt alarm bells ringing in his head. Oh god! I just blasted my brother with my own cum. Is he hurt!? <br />
<br />
“Jamie!” Timmy gasped, his deep voice filled with panic as he stumbled toward his brother. Each of his massive steps caused the ground to quake, cracks forming in the earth under his sheer weight. His colossal body radiated power, every movement a reminder of the terrifying strength he now wielded. Timmy’s towering form blocked out the sunlight, his shadow engulfing Jamie as he bent down, his enormous hands trembling slightly with guilt. The sheer size of those hands, capable of crushing a car like a soda can, made Jamie’s breath hitch in fear.<br />
<br />
“Oh my God, are you okay? I’m so sorry!” Timmy’s voice, deep and resonant, boomed with such force that it vibrated through Jamie’s chest like a physical wave.<br />
<br />
Jamie coughed, wiping the sticky mess from his face, struggling to regain his composure as he looked up at his impossibly massive brother. Timmy’s face, though flushed with embarrassment, still carried the same boyish worry Jamie recognized, a sharp contrast to the godlike body towering above him. “I’m fine,” Jamie muttered, though his voice trembled with a mix of fear and disbelief. His heart raced as he glanced at Timmy’s hands, so large they could accidentally crush him with a single twitch. “Just... please be careful and aim that thing somewhere else next time!”<br />
<br />
Timmy’s face flushed with embarrassment, the contrast between his shy expression and his monstrous body almost jarring. But before either of them could say another word, a deep, rumbling sound filled the air. Timmy’s entire body began to tremble again, his muscles twitching and his eyes widening in alarm.<br />
<br />
“Jamie... oh no!  Uhh... I think I messed up! I-I feel.... I f-feel it happening again!,” Timmy shouted in his commanding, hyper-masculine voice.<br />
<br />
The growth spurt began with a deafening crack, Timmy’s bones stretching and his muscles swelling at an exponential rate. His already massive frame surged upward, quickly passing 20 feet as his shoulders broadened and his chest expanded like a pair of massive boulders. His traps rose higher, nearly swallowing his neck, while his lats flared out even further, giving him the appearance of a living mountain.<br />
<br />
“Ohhh... it feels so good...” Timmy moaned guiltily, his voice shaking the ground as he threw his head back in ecstasy. Veins bulged across his skin, pulsating with raw power as his biceps and triceps exploded with size, each arm now thicker than a grown man’s entire torso. His pecs jutted out obscenely, each one larger than a car, and his abs became a monstrous twelve-pack, each ridge of muscle so deeply cut they cast shadows over one another, as if carved from solid marble. His obliques flared out like thick, corded steel cables, further enhancing the grotesque power of his core.<br />
<br />
Jamie watched in sheer terror as Timmy’s legs swelled into massive columns of power, each one thicker than the largest tree trunks. His feet, now the size of small vehicles, sank into the ground with every step. And then there was his cock. The monstrous appendage grew even larger, thickening obscenely, its pulsing veins bulging like cables across its impossibly hardening length. It throbbed violently, the skin stretched taut over the surging mass of engorged flesh, becoming a terrifying pillar of raw virility. The veins snaked and twisted along its grotesquely expanding surface, pumping rivers of testosterone-fueled blood into the angry purple head, making it quiver with overwhelming power.<br />
<br />
It towered over Jamie, the sheer heat of it radiating like a furnace, each pulsing spasm sending fresh streams of pre-cum oozing down its impossibly thick shaft. The crown of his cock swelled even larger, stretching outward with terrifying mass, the angry, swollen head glistening as if aching for release. <br />
<br />
Timmy groaned, his breath hitching, as the monstrous appendage flexed involuntarily, a colossal muscle of its own, pulsing, asserting its dominance to everything around it. Every fiber of its hulking mass screamed primal, unstoppable power, the very sight of it leaving Jamie paralyzed in terrified awe. <br />
<br />
 There was also something new that Jamie hadn&#39;t really noticed before. A thick scent permeating the air that smelled like some concoction of sex and unfiltered masculinity. Neither of them realized Timmy&#39;s hyper-powerful cock was now pumping out a cocktail of pheromones. It filled the air in such concentration that Jamie felt his head getting a little foggy.<br />
<br />
Timmy’s massive balls, now the size of boulders, churned audibly, the sound almost hypnotic in its intensity. His entire body radiated raw, alpha male dominance, an aura of power so overwhelming it pressed down on Jamie like a physical weight. Every muscle on Timmy’s body seemed to pulse with obscene vitality, veins bulging and throbbing in a symphony of unstoppable power. Jamie’s heart raced as he looked up at his younger brother, now twice as large as he had been before. The sheer scale of Timmy’s presence made him feel utterly insignificant, like a speck of dust next to a living god.<br />
<br />
Each movement Timmy made sent tremors through the ground, his towering frame exuding such an intimidating energy that Jamie found himself trembling uncontrollably. The deep musk of pheromones hung heavy in the air, clouding Jamie’s thoughts and making his knees feel weak. His instincts screamed at him to submit, to kneel before this unstoppable force of nature, but Jamie fought against the primal urge, clinging desperately to his resolve.<br />
<br />
The impossibly thick scent of testosterone and raw masculinity seemed to seep into Jamie’s very being, amplifying his fear. He gulped hard, his breath shallow as he forced himself to speak. &quot;Timmy,&quot; he croaked, his voice barely audible over the thunderous sound of his brother’s churning balls. He hesitated, his body paralyzed by the overwhelming presence of his colossal sibling. Every fiber of his being screamed that he was too small, too fragile, to even dare to address Timmy.<br />
<br />
But the sight of Timmy’s cock, now a terrifyingly monstrous appendage that rivaled Jamie’s entire body, and the way his brother’s body seemed to revel in its own growth, compelled Jamie to act. This couldn’t continue. He couldn’t let it. Gathering every ounce of courage he had, Jamie forced himself to speak louder, his voice cracking with both fear and determination. &quot;Timmy... we need to find Charlie and get his help! We need.... need a way to shrink you back. This... this is too much. You’re getting too big!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamie’s knees buckled slightly as he finished, his heart pounding so hard he thought it might burst. Something... something to do with that scent in the air, it was giving him a terrible feeling in his gut that he shouldn&#39;t have... shouldn&#39;t have defied this god-like man by suggesting they needed to find a way to reverse this. The act of defying the overwhelming dominance of his younger brother’s presence felt almost suicidal, but the words had been said. Now he could only wait for Timmy’s reaction.<br />
<br />
Timmy’s booming voice rumbled through the air, trembling with both embarrassment and hesitation. The sheer power of it felt almost physical, reverberating through Jamie’s chest and leaving him weak-kneed. “Shrink back?” Timmy repeated, his impossibly massive frame trembling slightly as his face flushed red with guilt and embarrassment, a stark contrast to his terrifyingly dominant presence.<br />
<br />
Seeing the hesitation in his face, emboldened Jamie to say speak up again and express what needed to be said. “Yeah! Timmy, you’re huge! You’re... you’re terrifying! We can’t just leave you like this!” he blurted out, his voice trembling as he tried to summon the courage to keep speaking.<br />
<br />
Timmy shifted nervously, his colossal hands—capable of effortlessly crushing steel—fidgeting like an embarrassed child’s. Despite his overwhelming size, the vulnerable expression on his face felt almost incongruous. “I... I know,” he stammered, his deep, earth-shaking voice taking on a shy, almost timid quality. His massive shoulders hunched slightly, as though trying to make himself smaller—an impossible feat for a body so enormous and powerful. “Y-you&#39;re right... But...,&quot; the expression on Timmy&#39;s face showed just how much Timmy was wrestling with what he was about to say, &quot;But... it-it feels so good, Jamie! I don’t know how to explain it... but this body... it’s... it feels incredible.” As he said, this Jamie watched as Timmy&#39;s cock twitched involuntarily, another globule of pre bubbling out and sliding down its length.<br />
<br />
Timmy’s voice faltered, his blush deepening as he struggled to put his feelings into words. “Every step I take... every breath I draw... it’s like nothing I’ve ever felt before. My body… it’s so strong, so powerful… it’s like... like it’s rewarding me for being this big. God... just breathing practically...practically turns me on.” He blushed even deeper at this comment. Fearfully, he looked down at Jamie, afraid to see his look of disapproval. His enormous chest heaving as he fought to contain his emotions. Jamie&#39;s mouth simply hung open in shock but no words came out.<br />
<br />
“Jamie...” Timmy’s voice softened, trembling with a mix of guilt and reluctant honesty. “I don’t want to shrink. I know you&#39;re right and that... I should… but I can’t stop thinking about how good this feels. How... right it feels.” His massive frame shuddered as he took a deep, shaky breath, the ground trembling beneath his feet.<br />
<br />
Jamie stared up at him, his heart pounding as he processed his brother’s words. The sight of Timmy’s massive hands fidgeting nervously, the way his towering frame loomed overhead, made Jamie feel like a fragile speck in comparison. And yet, beneath the terrifying size and power, He could still look into his brother&#39;s increasingly masculine face and see in those eyes the same shy, boyish Timmy he had always known.<br />
<br />
But something was also changing that neither Jamie or Timmy could see. Timmy&#39;s hyper developed balls were dumping so much testosterone into his blood stream--so much testosterone that was being pumped into through his body and into his brain. Even though Timmy was still Timmy, this feeling of power, this feeling of pleasure his brain was being rewarded with was becoming almost addictive.<br />
<br />
Timmy gulped, as he made a realization. Admitting it out loud almost more to himself than to Jamie, “I...” Timmy’s voice cracked slightly, his embarrassment overtaking him. “Actually, uhh... I hope this doesn’t stop, Jamie.” He paused, his gaze flicking away as though ashamed to admit it. “I-I hope I keep growing... bigger... stronger...” His words came out in a trembling whisper of shame and desire, but the sheer power of his voice still made Jamie’s heart race.<br />
<br />
Timmy’s colossal body seemed to tremble with arousal at the very thought, his cock visibly swelling once more as his thoughts consumed him. Jamie watched in a mix of horror and awe, the air thick with tension. Whatever his brother was becoming, it was clear that Timmy was starting to embrace it—and that realization sent a wave of terror through Jamie.<br />
<br />
Timmy&#39;s massive frame shuddered with pleasure at the thought, and Jamie felt a wave of terror wash over him.</p>
