<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Not having a clear goal in mind Jenny decided simply to wander around the store and enjoy the fact that she could. She knew that her dresser was somewhere in the store, but given that just the rubbing of her bra against her plastic breasts was driving her wild with pleasure and making walking more difficult that it should have been. Jenny figured it would be best to get accustomed to moving with her new body before introducing herself to the new girl, she also just wanted a change of scenery after two months starting at lingerie racks.<br />
<br />
Jenny slowly started walking in the direction of the casual wear department, two months frozen wearing nothing but lingerie had left her with a burning desire to pick her own clothing. The only reason she hadn&#39;t taken off the set she was wearing now was to help her build up a tolerance to fabric rustling as she walked, a problem that covering up more would only exacerbate. She kept her eyes open for anyone else moving around the store and made special note of any mannequins she passed by, but didn&#39;t see the employee. Maybe Kyle was just lying about having changed her? Jenny wasn&#39;t sure if she was hopeful or disappointed by that possibility. Having someone to interact with would be nice, but she wouldn&#39;t wish her current fate on anyone.<br />
<br />
On reaching the casual wear section Jenny took a look at a display that had been set up with three mannequins, two were identical with mirrored poses flanking a slightly younger one giving off a slightly flirtatious vibe. It had a genuine looking smile on her face, and was posed in a way that gave off a natural confidence and openness. Looking at it Jenny had the urge to climb on the platform and give it a hug, and maybe just a quick kiss. The mannequin did have a nice body, with firm (ha!) round C cup breasts lightly covered by a midriff-baring tank-top, a trim waist and a slight flare of the hips giving it a slim but noticeable hourglass figure. Its long slim legs were displaying jeans that looked painted on with a bit of &#39;designer tearing&#39; showing the smooth plastic complexion of its thighs. Jenny figured that if a girl at her school had looked like that, there might have been some competition for the boys&#39; attention. Heck, Jenny had never had a thing for girls, but here she was contemplating making out with a fake one. Of course Jenny was now a fake girl too she remembered, brushing a hand over her nipple-less breasts and moaning slightly from the pleasure that brought. The thought snapped her out of her reverie and she took another look at the mannequin that had captivated her so. Jenny was going to turn to the casual wear racks, but felt some silly urge to actually address the mannequin, which she then realized she might not even be able to do. So maybe her silly urge had some point to it after all, she faced the mannequin and tried to speak,<br />
<br />
&quot;W-well s-sweetheart, I don&#39;t think kissing you will help solve my problems, but stay put and I&#39;ll be back by morning to pose with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
The noise surprised Jenny at first and she stumbled over the first couple of words, but she was happy to learn a new fact about her body, and then was surprised for an entirely different reason.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re sure you don&#39;t want to kiss me?&quot; The mannequin said, breaking its pose and giving Jenny a little wink &quot;You had a pretty serious look of lust on your face when you were staring at me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny jumped as the mannequin came to life and ended up falling to the ground with a clatter of plastic, mixed with moans as the sensations overwhelmed her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry for that little prank Jenny, I was hoping to introduce myself to you in a more affectionate way. I&#39;m Stephanie formerly your dresser, now your co-worker of sorts.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stephanie hopped down from her platform and extended a hand to help Jenny get up, which Jenny refused, partly out of fear that touching this girl would overwhelm her with lust and partly because something was off.<br />
<br />
&quot;You...&quot; Jenny stammered, &quot;You seem happy. How can you be happy? Yesterday you were a living girl, now you&#39;re a mannequin. An object! How are you happy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah.&quot; Stephanie gave Jenny a pitying look, &quot;I&#39;m happy because I wanted this, I&#39;ve always wanted this. I&#39;m sure you noticed me feeling you up while changing you? Well that was part out of attraction to you, and part out of wanting to be standing next to you. So when that guy came up to me and said that since I seemed to love the mannequin in the lingerie department maybe I should join her, I told him I&#39;d love to. He was surprised by that but we worked something out. He gave me exactly what I wanted through that &#39;transform or dare&#39; thing, and then I used the power on him to make him more attractive to the girls at his school. He wasn&#39;t too careful though so he doesn&#39;t realize, and never will, that if a girl so much as touches his erection he&#39;ll become a solid sex-doll until he&#39;s used to make a woman orgasm. Oh, and sorry that I didn&#39;t change you back. It wasn&#39;t until I was changed that I knew you were once a real girl. That &#39;game&#39; is scary powerful.&quot;<br />
<br />
By this time Jenny had gotten up and was staring at Stephanie with a dumbfounded expression. This girl had *asked* to be inducted into the living hell that was now Jenny&#39;s life. At least some manner of revenge against Kyle had been taken, but with him out of commission there was nobody but Stephanie who knew Jenny was real. At that realization Jenny slowly sank back to the floor, falling on her knees.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll be stuck like this forever.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, cheer up, at least you&#39;re not alone, and I promise I&#39;ll make this fun for the both of us! Now come on, we&#39;re two mannequins with free reign of a huge mall, lets go exploring.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stephanie extends her hand to Jenny.</p>
