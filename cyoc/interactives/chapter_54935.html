<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen quickly hopped into her car and sped off to school in an effort to not be late.  The good <br />
news was she did not live far from the school so the possibility for her to get there on time <br />
was still valid providing she didn't get stopped by the cops.<br />
<br />
Jen's drive took her through a small neighborhood, which cute and adorable in many ways, <br />
but Jennifer was in too much of a panic to notice any of the scenery, including the stop <br />
sign she ran through.<br />
<br />
Like some unwanted relative that everyone knows, the siren of a police car made Jennifer <br />
groan in anger.  Pulling over to the side of the road, Jennifer knew her chances of getting <br />
to school on time were completely shot, so she thought she would make herself as <br />
comfortable as possible.  Leaning her driver seat back, Jennifer stretched herself out and <br />
yawned not even noticing the odd bump at the base of her spine.<br />
<br />
By the time the police officer, a gruff man of probably 40 with a handlebar mustache and <br />
salt colored hair, came to Jennifer's window; Jennifer's tail had fully grown in and Jennifer <br />
had almost slipped into a catnap.  Rapping on Jennifer's window, the cop was a little <br />
unhappy that the youth in the car had such disrespect for authority that she was napping.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mam, would you like me to give you your ticket now or would you like me to come back in <br />
a few hours after you've caught up with your sleep schedule?&quot; said the officer as Jennifer <br />
rolled the window down.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh could you, I think that would be an excellent idea,&quot; said Jennifer trying to loosen the <br />
officer up so he hopefully wouldn't be too hard on her.<br />
<br />
The officer just glared back saying, &quot;License and registration please.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Right,&quot; replied Jennifer as she reached into her purse and pulled out her license.  <br />
Jennifer then reached for her registration which she kept in her glove compartment.  After <br />
failing to reach the glove compartment's handle Jennifer said, &quot;One second,&quot; as she moved <br />
to undo her seatbelt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mam, you're not supposed to unbuckle unless-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There we go,&quot; giggled Jennifer as she loosed her seatbelt and turned to have better access <br />
to the glove compartment, which meant putting her butt to the police officer and whacking <br />
him several times with her newborn tail.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mam, ma Bleck, Ma, MA!&quot; shouted the police officer as he battled Jennifer's flicking tail.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?  Here you go,&quot; said Jennifer as she handed the officer her vehicle's registration.  <br />
When Jennifer looked at the officer again, she swore something was different about him.  <br />
Maybe it was the sudden loss of his mustache or the fact he looked slightly younger, yet <br />
Jennifer had this thought that the officer had always looked like he did now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you mam,&quot; huffed the officer as he walked away, not noticing his changes either.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gawh what's his problem,&quot; said Jennifer as she took her seat again, stretching out like she <br />
had done before, scratching the top of her head, the source of some odd itchy feeling.  The <br />
more Jennifer scratched, the better it felt.  She scratched and scratched and scratched, not <br />
even noticing that slowly her human ears faded away as her new cat ears took their place <br />
atop her head.  Finally content with her scratching, Jennifer yawned again setting herself <br />
up for another nap... only to have a slightly familiar voice stir her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um... Mam,&quot; said the voice.  Jennifer looked to see a much younger officer looking at her.  <br />
The officer appeared to be in his late twenties, early thirties as signaled by his brown hair <br />
and deep voice.  However, that really was the only thing masculine about him.  His face <br />
seemed relatively male, but his skin looked softer almost as if he had been using a really <br />
good skin lotion.  Yet the slender but muscular arms, long legs, heel-like shoes, the tight <br />
pants, general curves, and the beginnings of a bosom painted the officer more as female.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; began Jennifer as she rubbed her eyes, &quot;What is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You seem to have given me your student i.d.  Could I please have your driver's license?&quot; <br />
answered the officer, his voice cracking in a few places.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh sure, I'm sorry,&quot; said Jennifer as she pulled out her bag again.  &quot;I do that sometimes.  <br />
It's because I used the same photo and when an angry cop is glaring at you anyone could <br />
make a mistake.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was glaring?&quot; questioned the officer, his voice still cracking.  &quot;I'm sorry I had no idea.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's alright, you must go through a lot of crap in your line of work and I'm probably not <br />
making it easier.  Here you go,&quot; said Jennifer as she handed the officer her actual license.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's no trouble, I should have this done in just a few minutes,&quot; said the officer in a <br />
distinctly female voice.<br />
<br />
Jennifer once again stretched out in her car, figuring that since she was already late she <br />
might as well be well rested.  She knew the officer was just going to interrupt her again, <br />
but she didn't care.  The idea of a nap just seemed perfect.  Wanting to be as comfortable <br />
as possible, Jennifer slipped her socked feet out of her shoes.  Placing her feet on the <br />
dashboard and her shoes in the passenger seat, Jennifer leaned back and fell asleep easily.<br />
<br />
Jennifer eventually awoke to a tapping on her door.  She stretched and was greeted by a <br />
rather interesting voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me.  Um... I know this might sound odd but...&quot; said the voice of a young woman.  <br />
Looking Jennifer saw a woman who may have been nineteen in age in a police uniform <br />
with a cat tail flicking happily behind her.  The officer's bosom must have been at least C if <br />
not D and she seemed eager to show it off by the way she was leaning on the edge of <br />
Jennifer's rolled down window.  Suddenly, the officer's hat popped off her head and fell into <br />
Jen's car, knocked away by the addition of two new cat ears sticking out of her long brown <br />
hair.  &quot;Oh sorry,&quot; said the officer as she reached in to get her hat.  &quot;That always <br />
happeeen~!&quot; said the woman as gravity caught up with her, causing her to <br />
practically fall into Jennifer's car, her feet sticking out of the driver's window.  &quot;Sorry, I'm a <br />
bit of a klutz sometimes,&quot; said the officer, her tail flicking in Jennifer's face.  <br />
<br />
&quot;It's alright,&quot; said Jennifer, who was very tempted to grab the officer's breasts for some <br />
reason.  The officer pulled her feet into the car, loosing a shoe in the process, and pulled <br />
herself into the passenger seat, shifting Jennifer's shoes to the dashboard.  <br />
<br />
&quot;There we go much better,&quot; said the officer who now sat happily in Jennifer's passenger <br />
seat.  &quot;Now where was I?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You were about to ask me a question, I believe,&quot; said Jennifer as she opened the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh you can leave that out there,&quot; said the officer as she waved dismissively.  &quot;I hate heels <br />
anyway.  Don't know why the chief keeps making us wear them.&quot;  The officer then gladly <br />
took off her other heel, rolled down Jen's window and threw the shoe out the window.  The <br />
police then remembered what she came back to Jen's car.  &quot;Right, well to be honest.  When I <br />
got back to my patrol car, I was about to start punching in your information when... I <br />
completely forgot why I pulled you over.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh it was because... because... you know I can't remember either,&quot; said Jennifer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?  Wow that's odd.  I mean you think you would remember the reason you would pull <br />
someone over or get pulled over.  I guess you and I are just like that,&quot; said the officer with <br />
a smile as she leaned back in Jen's car.  &quot;By the way my name is Kate, do you mind if I get <br />
comfortable?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure why not,&quot; said Jennifer as she too leaned back, propping her feet on the steering <br />
wheel.  Kate smiled as she slowly started to undo the buttons on her shirt till it was <br />
completely open, revealing her lack of a bra.  &quot;Ah that is so much better, you have no idea <br />
what it's like to go around in a hot patrol car, waiting for a crime that might not happen.  <br />
It's rather boring.  It's nice to take a break like this every once and a while.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;To be honest,&quot; began Jenn, &quot;You don't really seem like the type to become a cop.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I've just always admired the police.  They do a job that many people wouldn't dare do <br />
and that's what drew me in.  However, due to my klutzy ways... I've been posted for patrol <br />
duty for the next three weeks.  My boss is such a jerk.  I apologized for the spill.  You think <br />
they would make coffee pot handles that weren't so slippery.  Yet it's a job that needs <br />
doing and I'll gladly do my best.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You really are a nice person aren't you,&quot; said Jennifer, smiling at the energetic catgirl's <br />
determination.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well so are you,&quot; answered Kate.  &quot;I mean who lets a stranger into their car.  Granted I'm <br />
not really a stranger since you know my name and I'm a police officer so I'm not going to <br />
do something evil, but you are really nice.  By the way I love your socks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?  Thanks, its nice to find someone who appreciates this sort of thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell me about it,&quot; said Kate as she looked at Jen's feet.  &quot;I wonder, could you put your foot <br />
over here?&quot;  Jen did as she was asked and Kate swung her foot over and placed her foot <br />
against Jen's.  &quot;I thought so.  You and I are the same size.  Ain't that funny?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah imagine that.&quot;  Jenn and Kate laughed about the coincidence for a bit, before Jen had <br />
an idea.  Looking through the clothing, gym bags, and water bottles she kept in the <br />
backseat of her car, Jen managed to find two match pink stocking with glitter stars and <br />
blue swirls.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are those,&quot; asked Kate.<br />
<br />
&quot;These were going to be part of an outfit for one of our halftime shows last year, but the <br />
principal mandated that all performances had to be done while wearing school colors.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow he sounds like a real prick.  Maybe he and my boss should meet up, they might find <br />
they have a lot in common.&quot;  The two girls laughed at the idea.  The two girls chatted for a <br />
few more minutes becoming fast friends.<br />
<br />
Eventually, Kate stood outside Jennifer's driver-side window wearing her police uniform <br />
with Jen's pink and blue stockings.  Jennifer spoke as she turned the car on, &quot;You have my <br />
number right.  Call me sometime.  Maybe you and I could go get lunch.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I would really like that, now you get onto school,&quot; said Kate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes mam,&quot; saluted Jen with a smirk as she drove off toward school, content that she had <br />
made a new friend.</p>
