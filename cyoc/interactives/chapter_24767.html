<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Derek was filled with panic as he saw the big hairy gut bump the door open, but he soon realized that Chris was guiding the obviously shocked guy. The same thing had happened to him that had happened to Chris and his friend Jason. Derek decided he would have to figure out just what the hell was going on, and he would do that by asking the only ones who would know.<br />
<br />
Chris sat the new guy down next to Jason and arranged him similarly, and then turned to look expectantly at his master. <br />
<br />
“Chris,” he said, once again assuming an authoritative tone. “I want you sit down, too…” He paused, realizing all the floor space had been taken up by the hairy giants before him. But he immediately devised a solution. “…on the toilet.” Chris maneuvered his way through the two sets of legs and sat on the toilet, jumping slightly and inching forward. This puzzled Derek who quickly realized Chris’s dick was now dripping with toilet water.<br />
<br />
“Alright,” he soothed. “Everyone relax. Everything is going to be just fine.” He merely listened as all three of them deeply, calmly and sleepily repeated his assurance. “Chris,” he began. “What happened to you??” He said this with a little bit too much harshness, something he realized too late.<br />
<br />
Even in his hypnotic state, Chris winced as if he was a child being scolded. “I’m sorry master. I was just trying to do what you commanded. Whenever any guy around me had sandals on, I got hard. And when someone was in bare feet, I shot.” Chris had been very quiet, but Derek had heard him and remembered his earlier commands at the shoe store. <br />
<br />
“But what caused you to grow so large?” Derek asked, this time taking the tone of father who was comforting a child afraid of discipline. Chris’s brow furrowed, and it was a moment before he responded.<br />
<br />
“Well, I was around a bunch of guys in sandals, and my dick was getting harder and harder. Then I realized it was growing, too. When one of the guys took off their sandals, I shot my load. Since my dick was so huge now, it caused the rest of my body to grow big, too.” Derek thought about this silently. He supposed it made sense, but then, did it have to? The magic of the socks obviously wasn’t limited to feet, and since when was magic supposed to make sense?<br />
<br />
“So what about Jason?” he sighed. “How did he become like you.”<br />
<br />
Chris’s brow remained creased as he replied, “I was showering after practice when Jay walked in. I turned around and I jizzed all over him. That made his feet grow big. Then, after I got big all over, I shot all over him again. I think it was because some guys were coming back from the shower in bare feet. So Jason grew big all over. Just like me.” Once again, Derek met this revelation with silence. So sperm was a transfer for the magic as well. He soon deduced that the latest giant had been in bare feet when Chris was sneaking up on him. Derek was developing a paternal concern for these men; children, it seemed. He had gotten them mixed up in this mess by trifling with magic that was beyond him. He knew he couldn’t change it, but he could help them accept it.<br />
<br />
“Chris,” he said. “No longer are you going to find any extreme arousal in men’s feet. You will become as you were before in your sexual desires. Do you understand?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, master,” came the reply. Now that he felt certain it could no longer be spread, he began to help them cope with their new bodies. First, Chris.<br />
<br />
“Chris, how do you feel about your new body?”<br />
<br />
“I feel like I’m too big to be normal. Like I won’t fit in and be able to do all the stuff I did before.” Derek was filled with regret, and was determined to make things right.<br />
<br />
“Chris, I know you are naturally a great guy with an infectious personality that most can’t resist. Anyone who knows you will accept you as you are, and so will you. All this growth was from a sudden growth spurt you had over the summer. You had always been a little bit bigger than the average guy, but this past summer, you just grew to your full potential.”<br />
<br />
“Yes, master,” came the deep, bold and confident reply. Already, Chris was set. Derek smiled, and turned to Jason.<br />
<br />
“Jason,” he said.<br />
<br />
“Yes...yes, master?” Jason was at first unsure, but even his subconscious-self followed his best friend’s lead, just as he always had.<br />
<br />
“Jason, how do you feel about your body?”<br />
<br />
As he spoke, Derek saw tears run down his face. “I feel like a freak,” he whispered. “I was ridiculed as a kid for being different, quiet, and intelligent. I finally found friends on the soccer team, a place where I belonged, and a best friend in Chris. Now the hell will begin again because of this huge body I…have.” The last word became a quiet sob. Derek thought for a moment, and he instructed Jason as to what he must do.<br />
<br />
“Jason,” he began. “You aren’t a kid anymore. You are a man. A grown man. Anyone who ridicules you for your body is simply jealous of you and what you have. And when they bother you, show them just how much of a man you are, and they will stop.” The tears running down Jason’s face stopped, and a small smile played across his lips. “You got big like this recently, a major growth spurt that surprised every one. Jason, do you understand?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, master,” he replied in a soft, but surprisingly firm voice. Finally, there was the last person who had been unwittingly brought into this. But Derek suddenly realized, he didn’t even know his name. He went over to the man, who seemed to be sleeping, and rested his hand on his shoulder. Derek felt the connection he already had with Chris and Jason. <br />
<br />
“What is your name?” he asked.<br />
<br />
“Bill Raamski,” came the reply. <br />
<br />
“Bill, what are you here in the locker room for?” As Derek had suspected, he was here for a football practice. “Bill, how do you feel about your body?”<br />
<br />
“I…” he started slowly. “I think it’s fuckin’ awesome! I’ve always wanted to be big, but I now I’m HUGE!! I’ll be unstoppable on the field, and women won’t be able to resist me. Not that they could before.” Derek was certainly surprised by this response. He was the polar opposite of Jason. But, that didn’t mean he was fine as he was.<br />
<br />
“Bill, how did you get this big?” <br />
<br />
“I was in front of the urinals over there, and then I felt this warm sticky stuff all over me. And then I just started gettin’ bigger ‘n’ bigger!” With the last sentence came a grin. Derek could tell that Bill Raamski was going to have no trouble at all adjusting to his new size. However, he didn’t want him to remember the actual way he’d become this big.<br />
	<br />
“No, that’s not how it happened,” Derek said, altering the football player’s memory. “You got this big by working out, eating a lot, taking supplements, and, of course, damn good genes!” Bill grinned and laughed heartily.<br />
	<br />
“Yeah, it was hard work, but hey, I was built for it!” he said, no memory remaining of what actually happened. Derek smiled, glad in the fact he had at least somewhat remedied the situation.</p>
