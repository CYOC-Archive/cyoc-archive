<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Later watching more of the broadcast Leona's lawyer spoke.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, your decision here will effect not only this lawsuit, but also this country, our society, and possibly all of <br />
humanity for the western world.   Simply because we CAN do something does not mean we SHOULD or ALLOW that something.   We stand <br />
before Pandora's box. <br />
<br />
If we open it. We'll be opening the door for customized human beings, making DNA testing and tracking effectively useless. And people's DNA <br />
will become just another commodity. Our very existence as a species will become in passing.  What is keep the army, human traffickers, <br />
mobsters, and dictators from using this technology to create slaves who can not fight back or super human monsters?<br />
<br />
&quot;Wouldn't we be creating ANOTHER LINE that the haves can use to separate themselves from the have nots? Or legal binding contracts that say <br />
someone MUST agree to have their DNA violated if they wish to have a certain job? And those who could not afford such a procedure? How <br />
could normal humans compete against those whose DNA had been specialized for their given task? <br />
<br />
And IMAGINE THE COST to public services!!! So many different species and so many different physiologies and body chemistries!  Doctors who <br />
before only needed to know the biology of one type of species, humans, would suddenly need to know several!  Bed sizes, breathing masks, <br />
medical tools, iron lungs, medication,  all would need to be made where they'd be ready to accommodate ANY of any number of warm blooded <br />
species. Assuming it even stops there! And as these groups get larger, we'll be creating NEW lines for people to draw in the sand among <br />
themselves. <br />
<br />
And please please please remember this technology is frightening and overwhelmingly new and exists purely by sheer accident!  We don't know <br />
what side effects it could have that we have not seen yet and will not make themselves known yet for decades! You can not allow a creature we <br />
do not even know yet the full true nature of loose into the world. Or it could end in devouring us all.&quot; <br />
<br />
That was when the persecution chose to have it's say. <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;What precisely IS humanity?&quot;  The persecution began, &quot;Through out history many criminals and maniacs were consider in the public mind too <br />
horrid in their actions to possibly be human.  And in centuries past, Europeans scientifically believes that Africans were a completely separate <br />
species from themselves.  IS humanity just DNA? If you stripped a person of their emotions and freedom of will, could you call that persons till <br />
human?  Is humanity a species, or is it our ability to function as a group, and for -most- of us to tolerate each other's difference just enough to <br />
work as a community?  If you were to put a machine in the body of a human being, and the mind of a person into a machine, which one would <br />
you say is human, which one would you say has humanity? <br />
<br />
Every last one of or nearly every last of the victims of the Fun House did not intend to become what they are, nor did they have time to prepare <br />
for it.  And we have yet to have a criminal report on any of those victims harming a human being or acting like feral animals. In fact, a humanoid <br />
tiger is currently a respected and effective police officer and has proven to be a very useful asset among his fellow officers.&quot;<br />
<br />
I started hearing this, noting how the persecution had been careful not to actually call me a victim.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Can this technology be abused? That's a completely absurd question. OF COURSE it can be abused! All technology can be abused and has been <br />
abused through out all of history!  The very first weapons human being used to kill each other were developed originally as hunting and farming <br />
tools!  Are nuclear weapons a blight upon humanity? Yes they are. But nuclear power in countries like France is a fact of life and in fact HAS <br />
improved lives.   All technologies have proven dangerous in one form or another and will continue to prove dangerous in one form or another.  <br />
<br />
The fact none of the victims have devolved into puddles of slime, or turned fully into animals or grown a second head on their bellies speaks <br />
volumes already of this technology.  Does it pose a threat maybe to the continued existence of humans? MAYBE. But does it pose a threat to <br />
the continued existence of HUMANITY? No more than any other technology.   Even if two hundred years from now everyone chose of their own <br />
free will to become humanoid donkeys, we would still want to get up, go to work, get paid, and come home to bed. <br />
<br />
Humanity is NOT a species, humanity is the part of us that enables us to work together and function as a culture. And the Fun House victims <br />
which have been trusted to and proven to be able to function in society in spite of them something overwhelming physical differences and <br />
sometimes handicaps has proven that they STILL HAVE humanity even if they are no longer human as Miss Leona has repeatedly pointed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Would this bring another difference to humanity? YES. But we are creating new differences among humanity ever day! Cultures upon sub-<br />
cultures upon sub-cultures. Would this completely change culture given enough time? YES! But so did the printing press, the industrial <br />
revolution, and then the changes brought on by the micronization of computers is STILL being felt.   But it can just as easily encourage <br />
economic -growth!- As custom clothing, tools, and what not rise in demand! Now that this technology exists, it'll continue to exist, and we <br />
simply can not ignore it or pretend that we can put it back in the box and imagine we never saw it. That is a fantasy. Pandora's box is already <br />
opened.&quot;<br />
<br />
Watching the TV broadcast, on an off chance I took a careful look at the persecution and the people at his table. <br />
<br />
Molly guessed what I was doing and took a look as well. <br />
<br />
&quot;What do you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No. It isn't him. Doesn't even look remotely like him! None of those on the persecution table do! And the worst part is that this is a civil case, <br />
not a criminal case!&quot;<br />
<br />
Molly tilted her head, &quot;That makes a difference?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;YES! In a criminal case the persecution needs to provide proof beyond any reasonable doubt. In a civil case you weight which party has <br />
presented the most convincing evidence.&quot; 'And I wouldn't admit for the world, but the physical evidence was stacking in the persecution's <br />
favor.' <br />
<br />
Molly's ears tilted, &quot;Oh. I see.&quot; I could guess she thought that Leona was going to win default if it came to a stalemate. <br />
<br />
&quot;I've also been checking pictures of people on the persecution's team and employees of some of the companies having verbally given support to <br />
the grass roots group behind the persecution given if they hadn't given direct funding to it. And of course the grass roots movement itself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And nothing. None of their faces matched our mystery man at all.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Whoever he was. He sure seemed determined to make sure we didn't find out who he was  . . . &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm starting to think that we're only so fixated on finding out who he was BECAUSE it's a mystery . . . &quot; I sighed, &quot;And it doesn't change a damn <br />
thing about how this civil suit is going to go.&quot;</p>
