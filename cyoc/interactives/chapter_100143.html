<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty left the house and went to the town center. He knew a small café close to <br />
high-street which was not too overcrowded. He would go there and maybe <br />
if chance came, he could have some fun there? As he was walking down the<br />
street he was reaching into his pockets and petted his two pocket-dicks assuringly. <br />
They were snuggling to his hands and felt obviously pretty comfortable in his <br />
pockets. <br />
<br />
&quot;I wonder how they breathe, or whether they have to breathe!&quot; Ty thought to himself. <br />
&quot;Would they need food or any other nourishment? Was it enough to just wish for <br />
them to exist and they existed? Could they actually starve if he did not provide them <br />
proper nourishment? And if they had, how would they ...? ... Well, every living being <br />
has to process their food and get rid of the excess ...!&quot; those where Ty&#39;s thoughts <br />
when he was arriving at the café. <br />
<br />
It was late afternoon and since the café was pretty small and not on highstreet <br />
itself, there were only that many people sitting there, reading newspapers and having <br />
a hot chocolate, tea or coffee. This wasn&#39;t one of them take-away places that were <br />
ruling city-centers nowadays, none of those places where stressed-out businessmen <br />
orbusinesswomen rushed in to order their café-latte-moccachino with hazelnut <br />
arome, lactose-free cream on top with almond-syrup and sprincles or whatnot. <br />
This was an old-fashioned place that was calm, where people spend some time <br />
to calm down and relax over a nice cup of Italian coffee. They had decent expresso <br />
here, or ground coffee and the most fashionable they got was a cappuccino, but <br />
what cappuccino it was! Ty knew it was the best in town, the beans used were <br />
true Arabica and it had been prepared by a real barrista, a coffee expert who had <br />
been taught in Italy. <br />
<br />
Ty ordered a cappuccino and yeah, if it was only for the coffee he might just as <br />
well just have wished for it, but there were limits to his powers. He enjoyed the whole <br />
process of ordering, watching his cuppuccino being prepared and then served. <br />
What he paid for was the whole package and only the whole package would add <br />
to the atmosphere that people felt so soothing to their soul. Snipping his fingers <br />
and simply wishing for some coffee to appear would be like gulping down a <br />
caffein pill as compared to a real cup of coffee. He would also have to wish for <br />
the soothing old music playing in the background and as a matter of fact: he didn&#39;t<br />
even know what music it was, so how could he wish for it? It must have been <br />
music from old French movies or something. The only interprete he thought he <br />
could remember was Edith Piaf, but that was about it. If he would have wished <br />
for it, he would have to take all those aspects into consideration and as a matter <br />
of fact: it was easier and the result more pleasing just to go to this perfect place <br />
and enjoy it the way it was. There were things where he with all his powers had <br />
to surrender to, but that was good. It was good to know there were still things <br />
that were beyond his abilities. Not everything could be done by magic.<br />
<br />
When his cup of hot coffee-goodness had been brought to his table (another <br />
aspect of service he enjoyed here), he added just a hint of sugar, sunk his <br />
spoon into the cappuccino and stirred it up. Whilst doing that he was taking a <br />
look at the scenery. There were a number of small found tables placed in <br />
rows, with two wooden chairs at each of them. Only five of the tables were <br />
occupied. <br />
<br />
There was one man sitting close to the corner, reading a newspaper, sometimes <br />
putting it on the table to read it, then again pulling it up and holding it in front <br />
of him like in the old crime-movies, where spies try to hide behind a newspaper. <br />
Reight behind him on the wall there were hanging photos of long deceased <br />
Hollywood-stars from the 1940es and 1950es maybe, and at the upper end of <br />
the wall there was hanging a large mirror that was running down the whole length <br />
of the wall. <br />
<br />
On the opposing side of the room were two elderly ladies sitting, intensely chatting <br />
away in a whispering tone as if they had to make sure no one would here their <br />
secrets. Ty was sure, they were gossipping about some people that they would <br />
probably be very nice and polite to if they were appear. He knew that type of women. <br />
If the other was gone, they would surely badmouth about her. <br />
<br />
Right next to the window there was sitting a woman with a child. She seemed <br />
to lack some sleep, since she seemed quite tired from the look of it, but she still <br />
enjoyed her cup of coffee and was watching her little boy who was sitting opposite <br />
of her, sipping on his mug of hot chocolate. He might have been around three <br />
years of age, his legs were dangling from the chair and when he was not drinking <br />
his cocoa, adding some more to his moustache of chocolate, he was fighting his <br />
cake with a fork that was obviously too large for him to handle. They seemed like <br />
nice people and enjoyed her day. <br />
<br />
Finally there was a young woman sitting at one of the center tables, only two <br />
tables away from where Ty was sitting. She was facing towards the reader, <br />
having the two elderly ladies sitting behind her, her left profile facing into Ty&#39;s <br />
direction, so he could observe her without being noticed. She had a classic <br />
profile as one might say. Actually quite beautiful if you took a closer look, but <br />
she was very timidly dressed, with a very long skirt, a pair of very modest glasses, <br />
not those horn-rims that were in fashion lately and hardly if any make-up. <br />
She long had ash-blonde hair that had been tied in a knot and wore a shirt with <br />
very long arms. She was reading a book and Ty had no doubt she was studying <br />
psychology or maybe English literature. She was quite beautiful, but seemed <br />
either not to care about it, or even tried to hide it.</p>
