<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Janice Camberton was a bit anxious about going to Mieni Atoll, namely because she wasn&#39;t sure if her and Walter&#39;s fur would be too smothering in the tropic climate. But it turns out a skunk&#39;s fur wasn&#39;t too thick and they could adapt to the warmer temperatures rather easily. After that, Janice began enjoying Mieni Atoll very much, enjoying the luscious tropical island and its lovely beaches.<br />
<br />
It had taken a little bit of coaxing from Walter to coax Janine into the water. Not because she couldn&#39;t swim or was afraid of the water, but she felt that her swimsuit was a little too revealing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Janice, dear, there is nothing to be embarrassed about,&quot; said Walter, &quot;We are on the beach and there isn&#39;t anyone around.&quot;<br />
<br />
Janice kept her beach robe around herself and said, &quot;But anyone could come in and see in me zis scandalous attire.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Janice, it&#39;s barely scandalous. You know what the therapist said. You need to allow yourself to loosen up,&quot; said Walter, &quot;You shouldn&#39;t have to repress yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Janice took a long breath and said, &quot;Alright, very well.&quot; She untied her beach robe and allowed it to slip off, revealing the purple one-piece she was wearing under it. It was rather tame by human standards and even more so by Animalian standards, but it still clung tightly to her curves and it dipped in the front enough to show off some impressive cleavage.<br />
<br />
Walter smiled and said, &quot;There&#39;s the beautiful skunkette I am mated to.&quot;<br />
<br />
Janice smiled back and said, &quot;You flatterer.&quot; She allowed Walter to pull her close before they started kissing. In Walter&#39;s arms, Janice wouldn&#39;t mind being naked to the world. She certainly liked running her hands over his muscular chest and back. He had doing a lot of work to get ready for the bodybuilding competition. Janice didn&#39;t care if Walter might not win, she was more than enough man for her.<br />
<br />
It was funny how close they had become despite the very awkward start of their relationship. Janice was one of Lyre&#39;s normal residents until the Outbreak happened. She heard a commotion outside her house and went to investigate. Near her garage, she saw what she thought was a man in a skunk costume. She approached the man from behind and asked what he was doing. Unfortunately for her, Walter was in a very nervous state after having just been uplifted and Janice&#39;s question startled him. And frankly, she chose the wrong side of him to approach from. Being sprayed by a man-sized skunk is as unpleasant as it sounds. Janice&#39;s eyes and nose were burning so much that she could only helplessly accept assistance from Walter. She couldn&#39;t even tell when her fur started growing as the Animalia Virus was present in Walter&#39;s spray as well.<br />
<br />
Naturally, Janice was rather upset to discover she had become a smelly skunk. However, Walter apologized profusely and helped her descent herself as best as he could. Fortunately, skunks had a slight resistance to each other&#39;s sprays and it didn&#39;t take too much scrubbing for Janice to get the smell out. But she was still a skunk afterwards. But to Janice, this wasn&#39;t entirely so bad, as long as she wasn&#39;t stinky all of the time. And the establishment of a brand-new community of changed humans and animals helped her deal with her change. Walter felt responsible for Janice&#39;s change and spent a lot of time with her to help her cope. Walter might have been born a normal skunk, but he soon proved himself to be a clever and openhearted fellow. He even learned French so he and Janice could talk to each other more smoothly and have private conversations. It didn&#39;t take long for their relationship to blossom into love and the two of them became mates.<br />
<br />
And considering this trip to Mieni Atoll was considered their belated honeymoon, there was logically one thing that was bound to happen. Of course, Janice wasn&#39;t bold enough to mate with Walter out in the open, not even in Lover&#39;s Lagoon. But she had no reservation with making love in their own room.<br />
<br />
Janice gave loud gasps as Walter drove in further, stretching her out more. &quot;Ah, Walter, I&#39;m so close,&quot; she gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not close enough,&quot; said Walter, &quot;But I know how to fix that.&quot; His hands moved to her bare breasts and he started teasing her nipples with the practiced skill he had acquired since he and Janice first became mates.<br />
<br />
Janice gave a soft cry and arched her back. Walter&#39;s fingers felt like lightning on her body. She was so charged up that she had to push against Walter even harder. The increasing pitch of her voice was the only warning Walter got before she let out a louder cry as her pussy convulsed. Walter thrust three more times before he let loose his load into his mate.<br />
<br />
The two skunks lied next to each other as their heart rates went back down. &quot;Janice, would you you&#39;re happy with your honeymoon?&quot; asked Walter.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m &#39;appy being with you wherever we are,&quot; said Janice, &quot;Zere is only one zing I miss.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; asked Walter.<br />
<br />
Janice sighed and said, &quot;I miss my maman. She did so much for me to get away from ze life of a maid in France. But what &#39;ave I done for &#39;er? I just wish I could &#39;ave &#39;er&#39; back in my life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure she&#39;s still proud of you,&quot; said Walter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oui, she&#39;ll be glad I&#39;m doing better,&quot; said Janice, &quot;Oh, Walter, if only she could meet you, I know she could like you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And if you&#39;re any reference, I&#39;m sure I would like her too,&quot; said Walter.<br />
<br />
Janice playfully pushed him and said, &quot;Walter, are you saying you would be attracted to my mozer?&quot;<br />
<br />
Walter froze and said, &quot;Er, that isn&#39;t...I didn&#39;t mean...&quot;<br />
<br />
Janice laughed and said, &quot;I am only teasing. I know you have eyes for only me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Walter grinned and said, &quot;So, you like teasing, huh?&quot; His hand reached around and pinched Janice&#39;s butt.<br />
<br />
Janice gave a yelp and said, &quot;Careful, Walter. We don&#39;t want to make zis room uninhabitable for anyone else.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, we&#39;d probably have to pay a pretty big bill if we did,&quot; said Walter.<br />
<br />
Janice snuggled closer to Walter, pressing her large breasts into his muscular chest, and said, &quot;I zink I&#39;m ready for more of your big bill now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Walter tilted Janice&#39;s chin up and said, &quot;I was hoping you were.&quot; He kissed her on the lips again, allowing their furnace of love to stock up again before they made more love.</p>
