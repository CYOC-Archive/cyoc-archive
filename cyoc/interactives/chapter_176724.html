<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Going with the &quot;lighten up&quot; theme you decide to go back to the room to catch Wendy before she leaves.   You drop the box off hurriedly with the pool guy and head toward the main hotel on the beach. <br />
<br />
There are a lot of well lit paths on the way,  but it&#39;s a tourist trap so they tend to wind toward every so imaginable to get you to spend your money on little key chains with your name on them along with millions of other worthless trinkets.  Being as you&#39;re bare foot your not looking forward to extra walking.   Not to mention that the weight of your new breasts bouncing and trying to fall out of the top was a bit distracting. <br />
<br />
You cut through a little alley way that should shorten your trip.  It&#39;s not well lit,  but you&#39;ve been in stranger places and been fine. Your distracted by the new sensation of your nipples rubbing against the silky feel of the swim top and your thighs rubbing against one another.  Lost in those trains of thought you don&#39;t even realize that there is a man waiting on you a few feet up the alley.  By the time that he does register your already being grabbed around the waist and carried inside of a doorway.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi there beautiful.  What are you doing down this way?&quot; a raspy voice sounds off in your ear.  It&#39;s dark inside the little room,  but you look around for a weapon. You&#39;re inside of a storage room of some sort. There are shelves full of clothes mainly the t-shirts that supply the tourist trap shops with their cheap merchandise. You don&#39;t spot anything that would be effective,  just boxes and clothes. &quot;Oh,  are you a bit shy honey?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will kill you if you try anything,&quot; you reply.   Even though you&#39;re pissed about the situation this new body&#39;s voice is husky. The man grasps you tighter around the waist pulling your ass into his crotch and uses his other arm across your collar bone to subdue you. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,  your a fiesty one aren&#39;t you?&quot;  His lips are right next to your ear and he only has to whisper in order to be heard. You quickly jab at his face and then doing your elbow down striking him in his side. The result is immediate. Your hand hurts like hell and everything below your elbow tingles with the sharp shots of pain from pins and needles. <br />
<br />
He gathers one hand and then the other into one of his securing then behind your back. &quot;That wasn&#39;t very nice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How about you let me go and see how nice I can be.&quot; Your spitting mad now and would love to have your male body back right now. You would destroy this guy.  But,  your stuck in this helpless body. Your thin wrists are restrained in one of his strong hands and regardless of how you pull you can&#39;t seem to get free. <br />
<br />
You&#39;re pulled backwards toward one of the shelves and hear rustling behind you. You feel a set of zip tie restraints slide over your wrist and tighten.   Your stomach drops as you know that these are designed to hold 300 pound men during a fit of rage.  At 120 pounds your chance of breaking them is almost zero. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright,  your free.  Show me what you&#39;re going to do,&quot; he says as he releases you.   You spin quickly to look him in the eyes.  He&#39;s got to be 6&#39; 2&quot; and well built at about 230 pounds.  He&#39;s spent a lot of time working out,  but you can tell it&#39;s not gym muscles.  He&#39;s tanned from days outside in the sun and instead of bulky muscles built for looks with iron weights he&#39;s toned with a bulk and stature that says he&#39;s used to throwing 120 pounds of weight over a shoulder and carrying wherever it needs to be. <br />
<br />
He has some very broad shoulders with blonde hair that reaches just past his shoulders. His strong jaw line and high cheek bones are tight showing that he doesn&#39;t retain any extra body fat.  His bare chest displays a set of carved pecks and there is a glisten of a silver ring in each nipple. <br />
<br />
His trunk narrow at the waist,  more so as he takes each deep breathe and his six pack shows through. The man&#39;s hips flair out supporting what have to be very muscled legs clad in blue jeans.  His boots are worn from use and the brush leather shows scuff marks from his work. <br />
<br />
All in all,  you&#39;re in shock. There is not detestable scar running across his face. You rolling jiggling gut out any other marking of a disturbing man who would take a woman against her will in an alley.  No,  this man would have been equally successful in a bar buying a lady a drink. He wasn&#39;t average looking,  but was actually quite attractive. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well,  I&#39;m waiting.   What are you going to show me?&quot; he asks a he begins to advance toward you. Your having trouble breathing as the man takes up all of the space within the room. His sent is a mixture of banana boat sunscreen,  fresh salt air from the ocean,  and his own musk.   None of which are appalling to your senses. <br />
<br />
Your back his a shelving unit and you stop moving.   You hadn&#39;t even known you were walking backward. He steps into you placing a hand on either side of you and resting them on the shelf. He leans in placing his cheek against yours,  the shaved skin smooth with no prickle of a 5 o&#39;clock shadow. His lips are just next to your ear and he again whispers,  &quot;Well,  if you&#39;re not going to show me a fight, then perhaps you&#39;d like to show me something else.&quot;<br />
<br />
His tongue gently runs along your ear lobe and unexpected tingles race down your spine. A hand reaches forward and pushes your top to either side getting your newly found and as of yet unexplored chest. A hand palms your left breast and hold it firmly with a squeeze. <br />
<br />
Your breathe rushes in.  Stupid body has never been touched and doesn&#39;t realize that certain people in certain situations shouldn&#39;t elicit a response like this. None the less it does respond.  Your nipples have become hard and extra sensitive and there is a slickening occurring between your legs. <br />
<br />
I finger glides over a hardened nipple and a soft moan escapes. &quot;Oh,  you like that do you?&quot; He does it again with the same response escaping you before you can cut it off. He sucks gently on your ear and begins working on your neck.   Your skin is so sensitive that the sensation urge another moan from you. <br />
<br />
What the hell is going on, you ask yourself.  Get a grip.   This guy wants to have his way with this body and unfortunately your wearing this body right now. His free hand leaves the shelf and grips your ass pulling your crotch against his.   There is no mistaking his intent as the bulge from his jeans rubs against you. You find this traitorous body grind back against him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh hell,  you are enjoying yourself aren&#39;t you?&quot; After a moments pause,  &quot;Come on now,  you can admit it to little old me.&quot; On the word me he pushes his bulge against you suggestively.  You&#39;re screaming out in your mind,  but you&#39;re not sure if it&#39;s in wanting to kill this man or urge him onward. <br />
<br />
He lightly pinches your nipple and an excited moan vibrates throughout you. &quot;Fuck baby,  i can&#39;t do this anymore.   We&#39;ve got to go right now. I&#39;ve got to be inside of you.&quot;</p>
