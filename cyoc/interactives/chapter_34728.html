<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;NRG-X is a new drug that increases the energy output of the body's mitochondria.  As a <br />
result, it's intended to greatly increase stamina, as well as the body's natural reserves.  <br />
Side effects include an accelerated metabolism, increased need for food and drink, <br />
insomnia, restlessness, and hyperactivity.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sage whistled lowly.  &quot;Sounds dangerous to use.  Would it cause someone to age faster, <br />
too?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tests on laboratory animals hasn't shortened lifespan any, but that could be a risk for <br />
humans.  Your heart is very healthy, so we shouldn't have to worry about any problems <br />
there.  It's up to you, of course.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sage shrugged.  &quot;I'll give it a go.&quot;<br />
<br />
Before she went to bed that night, Sage took the first pill.  It was hard to swallow, and she <br />
nicknamed it the 'Multivitamin from Hell'.<br />
<br />
She only slept for five hours, feeling unusually bright and active, despite the early hour.  <br />
Sage was NOT a morning person.  She got up, showered, dressed, cleaned up the <br />
apartment, did some laundry, and organized her CD collection before she got bored and <br />
decided to go for a jog.<br />
<br />
Two hours later, she finally stopped to rest for a bit.  It was amazing, she felt great!  If one <br />
pill could do that, what would she be like in a week?<br />
<br />
She ate an entire large pizza that night, and watched three movies she'd rented...well more <br />
like two and a half, since she'd fast-forwarded past the boring parts of one of the movies.<br />
<br />
Still not quite tired, she surfed the internet, and read two long fanfics in record time <br />
before taking the second pill and laying down.<br />
<br />
She was up again in four hours time, feeling fully recharged.  She made breakfast, and <br />
then put one of Skye's workout DVD's in the drive, trying to burn off some excess energy.<br />
<br />
She then went for another morning jog, which ended up with her at the library, where she <br />
spent a few hours catching up on some novels she'd missed.  She couldn't believe how <br />
quickly she devoured the text; she'd always been a quick reader, but never like this!<br />
<br />
Checking out a few books, she dropped by the hospital and read to Skye, even though <br />
there was no sign her lover heard her.  She ran into Skye's father, and for the first time <br />
ever, won an argument with him...her memory seemed sharper than ever, and she was <br />
easily able to turn his accusations against him.<br />
<br />
She felt amazing...the only thing that could improve her mood would be Skye waking up.<br />
<br />
The next morning she woke up, feeling fully rested....after only three hours of sleep!<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh this can't be good.  I need more rest than this, or I'll start flaking out.&quot;<br />
<br />
She checked the want ads...maybe she could take on a part-time job?  <br />
<br />
By the end of the day she'd gotten TWO jobs, she'd work part-time at the video store, and <br />
she'd offered to babysit for her neighbor's seven year old.<br />
<br />
Sage got along great with Megan, and to her astonishment, was easily able to keep pace <br />
with the younger girl's energy.  In fact, Megan had gotten tired long before Sage, after a <br />
whole afternoon of playing games, watching movies, and going to the park.<br />
<br />
In a short time, Sage had noticed her body becoming more fit and trim, the result of her <br />
intensive exercise.<br />
<br />
But even pushing herself to the max, she only got five hours of sleep, and she awoke <br />
feeling...chipper.   Sage was never chipper.  That had been more of Skye's personality.  But <br />
she couldn't help herself.<br />
<br />
She decided to wear the dress Skye had bought for her several months back.  Sage hated <br />
dresses; as tall as she was, she felt like a scarecrow playing dress-up, but she had to <br />
admit, admiring the muscle tone she'd recently acquired...she looked good in the baby <br />
blue dress.  She took a bunch of pictures for Skye before undressing.  It wouldn't do to get <br />
the dress all sweaty.<br />
<br />
Standing there in the nude, Sage licked her lips.  For the first time in her life, her own <br />
body was turning her on.  She'd hated her body, but, as she ran her fingers along her <br />
leg....she could get used to this.<br />
<br />
She lay back on the couch and closed her eyes, thinking of Skye, as she rubbed her crotch <br />
and played with her small breasts.  Her nipples seemed extra perky, and it wasn't long <br />
before she came, her back arching in pleasure.<br />
<br />
She liked it so much she pleasured herself twice more.  It had been so long since she'd <br />
had an orgasm, it felt delicious.<br />
<br />
She then showered, and put on her work out clothes, first exercising, and then going for <br />
her jog.<br />
<br />
She hit the library, worked her shift at the video store, read another book to Skye (and <br />
wore the dress), then showed up to watch Megan.  She joked that it was more like a <br />
playdate, and both her and Megan had a lot of fun, before she tucked Megan into bed, the <br />
seven year old left worn out by her energetic friend.<br />
<br />
That night, Sage contemplated the fourth pill.  &quot;Ok Sage, this is great, but you're more <br />
hyper than Megan, and she's seven, for fuck's sake.  What will another pill do to me?&quot;<br />
<br />
She was certain her reaction to the medication was more extreme than normal.  Looking in <br />
the mirror didn't reveal any signs of aging, thank God...if anything, she looked a bit <br />
younger!<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok,if I wake up and I'm a teenager, I'll give Marcy a call.&quot;  She didn't think she was really <br />
getting younger, but it sure felt that way.<br />
<br />
She pleased herself again before going to sleep.</p>
