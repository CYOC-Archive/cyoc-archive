<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tyler kept his hands in his pockets, waiting for the saliva to dry. He didn't want to gross people out before they became man-gorillas. But that didn't stop him from sharing cups with others. He was curious as to what would happen to the girls. When he felt his saliva dry up, he began exchanging hand shakes, fist bumps, and high fives with everyone he bumped into.<br />
<br />
He even found touching through clothing caused a diluted effect in one's behavior. He had initially started out with his left hand on the catcher's shoulder, pretending to be drunk. The catcher didn't seem to care. After a little bit, the catcher moved closer to Tyler. His hand migrated to the catcher's side. After a little longer, no one they chatted with noticing, the catcher got even closer to Tyler. The pair rotated, with their backs facing the wall. Tyler then grabbed the catcher's butt.<br />
<br />
The catcher coughed and looked at Tyler, but he didn't pull away. &quot;The name's Matt,&quot; he said, extending his hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tyler,&quot; Tyler answered, shaking Matt's hand. Tyler began massaging the butt cheek he had grabbed. The change in Matt's expression was almost immediate. His eyes filled up with lust, and he licked his lips. Not letting go of Tyler's hand, Matt opened a door to his left and pulled Tyler inside. At that moment, Tyler saw one of the girls reaching back to undo her bra.<br />
<br />
Signaling to Matt to wait just a second, Tyler grabbed the hand of a nearby frat brother he had infected earlier. He could tell that the guy was about ready to take off his jacket.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen,&quot; Tyler said. &quot;Can you do me a favor? I'll do one in return.&quot; He winked seductively at the guy. The guy smiled and nodded. &quot;I need you to start locking up the house.&quot; He then pointed to a couple of guys he had just infected. &quot;Tell those guys to go home and lock the door behind them.&quot; The guy winked back and told Tyler he'd do it. Tyler then closed the door to the room he and Matt were in.<br />
<br />
It must have been Matt's bedroom due to the multiple portraits of him scattered throughout the room. What Tyler was not prepared for was the onslaught of posters of muscular bodybuilders: some posing, others making out with another guy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Matt, can I ask you something?&quot; Tyler asked, walking over to Matt. Matt only raised an eyebrow. &quot;Have you always been gay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ever since high school,&quot; Matt said proudly, rubbing his bulge. &quot;But enough talk, time for play.&quot; He took off his shirt and threw it to the side.<br />
<br />
Matt was very well built, even bigger than Nick was before he had gone man-gorilla. His pecs were the size of juicy watermelons. He had a well-defined 6-pack, and his shoulders were nice and broad. He had not begun changing size though.<br />
<br />
Tyler placed his hands on Matt's pecs and massaged them. Matt arched his head back in obvious pleasure. The dried saliva on Tyler's hands caused Matt's pecs to slowly start inflating.<br />
<br />
&quot;You already found my sensitive spot!&quot; moaned Matt. &quot;You're amazing!&quot;<br />
<br />
Liking what he was hearing, Tyler removed his hands and began licking, making out, and kissing Matt's pecs. Matt moaned loudly, not even caring if people heard him through the door. He still remained blissfully unaware of his pecs gaining size.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, even louder moans and crashes could be heard on the other side of the door. They both stopped and listened. A couple people yelled in fear, but their yells quickly turned into moans of pleasure.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's going on out there?!?&quot; Matt asked, suddenly alarmed yet still aroused.<br />
<br />
Tyler took it as his cue to step it up a notch. He yanked Matt's pants and jockstrap to the ground, exposing Matt's rock-hard 13-inch cock. Before Matt could say anything, Tyler forced his lips on top of Matt's, wrestling with his tongue. As that happened, he took off his own pants, wrestled his lower hands out of his shoes, ripped the T-shirt, and waited for the changes to happen to both of them.<br />
<br />
They embraced each other as their muscles suddenly began to balloon outward. Their shoulders grew, and their arms lengthened, sending shivers of pleasure up and down the two men. Their leg muscles grew huge as they reformed into arm muscles. Their hard, growing cocks pushed and rubbed against the other's, eliciting moans from the two individuals. When Tyler felt the growth stop, he ended the kiss.<br />
<br />
Matt was breathing heavily and looking at Tyler's body. Matt was still noticeably bigger but not by too much. They still didn't separate. Matt grinned broadly.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was the best kiss...ever,&quot; he said, slowly breaking away from Tyler. He then saw his own body, his lower arms and hands, and his own giant arms. He kissed Tyler again. &quot;I love you, Tyler!&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you too, Matt,&quot; Tyler replied, embracing his new lover again.<br />
<br />
Tyler beat his chest a few times and said, &quot;Now let's do this how man-gorillas do it!&quot; They both jumped onto the bed. It collapsed under their weight, but they didn't care. They were in love.</p>
