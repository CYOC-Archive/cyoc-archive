<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Let&#39;s get out of here,&quot; Penny said after a bit.<br />
<br />
Her attention still on the screen, Lisa was inclined to agree, as the smell of her brother&#39;s room was starting to get to her. Yet, at the same time, she wanted to know more about the computer game Jeff had on his laptop and why it was showing a detailed profile of both her and her friend. Nodding absently, the fourteen year old girl reached across the desk and unplugging the computer, she stated, &quot;Okay. But we&#39;re taking this with us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Outside the bedroom, they had a quick discussion on what they should do with the laptop. After coming to the conclusion that both wanted to know more about why the programme running was showing what it was, the talked about where to set it up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your room?&quot; Penny suggested, but Lisa didn&#39;t like the idea and shaking her head, she shut the door to Jeff&#39;s room, thought about where they could go, before she decide on a place. Looking at her friend, she commented, &quot;I know where,&quot; and heading toward the dining room, she set the computer on the table, ran the power cord across it and toward the nearest outlet.<br />
<br />
After she&#39;d plugged it back in, Lisa pulled a chair over to the end of the table as Penny sat down. Each looking at the screen, they were unsure what they should do, if anything. Neither having any inclination to play video games, they couldn&#39;t explain, but there was something about Jeff&#39;s game that drew their attention. Reading their profiles, each amazed at the amount of details, curious to know how the thing knew such things about them, some so intimate they&#39;d never told anyone, Lisa soon broke the silence when she asked, &quot;What do you think we should do?&quot;<br />
<br />
Penny was unsure as she reached out and tapped a few commands. Finding they were relatively simplistic to figure out, that they allowed for easy navigation, she pulled open a window that showed her stuff she could change and alter about herself. Spotting an option for wings, she doubled clicked on it and began to scroll through it. Finding it had a large range from the smallest bird, the bee hummingbird, to the largest, the ostrich, it also offered other options that ranged from animals like bats to fictional, such as dragon wings to prehistoric creatures like pterodactyls. Having always had a fascination with flying, and as a little girl had wondered what it&#39;d be like to have wings, Penny said, &quot;I&#39;m trying this,&quot; and scrolling through, she settled on a pair from a powerful owl, adjusted to them so that they&#39;d be big enough to carry her, and when it brought it up, adjusted reality to accept her like this, with only her and Lisa aware of the change, and for it to be permanent, yet did not hit confirm.<br />
<br />
Next to her, also unaware of exactly what the programme could do, and had done, her friend thought what Penny had done was a riot. Keeping her face neutral, not sure how the other would react if she began to giggle, she truthfully told her friend, &quot;You look cute with those wings,&quot; as she hit a few key strokes to bring make her profile to the forefront.<br />
<br />
&quot;Promise not to laugh?&quot; she asked her friend and when the other girl nodded, Lisa clicked about until she found the drop-down box she was looking for.<br />
<br />
There had alway been one thing she&#39;d been curious about, but had never told anyone. When she saw the information buried in her profile, she was mortified it was there for all to see. Certain Penny had seen it, she was relieved her friend hadn&#39;t said anything about her curiousity of wondering what it&#39;d be like to see your genitals instead of having them placed out of sight between your legs. Knowing the difference between boys and girls, she thought at first she&#39;d give herself boy parts. But, upon seeing what Penny had done to her profile, she changed her mind. Pulling  up the option for dicks, she scrolled through tapir, gorilla, dolphin, koala, alpaca, and who knew how many others before she reached rabbit. An idea coming to her, she doubled clicked on the option for barnyard, narrowed down the search, and scrolled through pig, sheep, bull, goat, and finally settled on horse.<br />
<br />
Before her, the picture of her morphed and she saw a naked version of herself with a horse&#39;s penis and balls. Making adjustments, she set the flaccid state at twenty-one inches and the erect state at thirty-three. After she’d done that, she made a few changes so that the prepuce was also there and the cock could withdraw back into the sheath, and after a thinking about it for a moment, flattened her chest. Having never like her breasts, she found them annoying as they were often itchy, tender, drew attention she didn&#39;t want, both from boy who stared and girls who teased her about her A cup, whilst wearing a bra was often uncomfortable and an annoyance. Finishing with that, finding her profile now looked like a flat-chested girl with a huge dork, she tried not to smirk as she followed her friend&#39;s example and set the reality so it was accepted for her to be like this, that it was only her and Penny aware of the alteration, and for it to be permanent.<br />
<br />
The screen blinked and both girls watched as a dialogue box pulled up that asked, &quot;Confirm all choices?&quot;<br />
<br />
Still under the assumption that it was only a game, they looked at each other. Neither wanted to hit the accept option, and both were tempted to return the laptop to Jeff&#39;s room. Finding their hesitancy off, Lisa soon wondered to herself, &quot;Why? All that&#39;ll happen is that it&#39;ll create a profile for some game my older brother was playing,&quot; and believing this, she glanced over at her friend, saw that the other looked to feel the same way, and before she could change her mind, she clicked the option.<br />
<br />
Neither was sure what would happen, but was sure what did happen wouldn&#39;t. As a throb that itched washed over Penny&#39;s shoulder blades, and she took off the open button-up she had on over her cami to scratch at the area, Lisa groaned, shifted in place and spread her legs so she was sitting like a boy. A sensation like what she felt when had her period settled in her nether regions, and for a moment she wondered if she was having her cycle early, as the last one had been only about a week, week and a half ago. But then as the discomfort started to move southward, she became convinced this wasn&#39;t the case, and leaping up, she muttered a hasty, &quot;Excuse me,&quot; before she ran for the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Unaware of what her friend was experience, and had said, Penny was instead too preoccupied with her own issue. The itch in her shoulder blades had grown so bad, she was gritting her teeth and resisting the urge to scratch, mostly because of the bony protrusions she&#39;d felt the last time she&#39;d done so. Rolling her shoulders, causing the straps of her shirt to slip down onto her arms, she bared her teeth, hissed and leaned forward. Reaching out to grip the edge of the table, she stood and arched her back so that her shoulders were fully exposed. Starting to pant heavily, unaware that certain options had become active, she grimaced as the two bony protrusions tore through the skin and the skeletal start of two wings twitched uselessly back and forth as they continued to grow in length.<br />
<br />
Inside the bathroom, Lisa had just enough time to close the door before the discomfort in her groin became too much. Squatting down, she tried to undo the buttons on her jeans as they started to grow tight, but unable to do that, she reached and grabbed hold of the edge of the sink. Gasping out not in pain, but rather in pleasure, she was surprised by this, and bearing down, finding it not only felt right but also seemed to cause what she was feeling to increase, she missed it as the seams on her panties and jeans strained, then started to pop. The tightness of her pants growing, she was worried for a moment about it before she was distracted by the odd sight of her chest reducing in size. Finding it funny, she uttered a laugh that almost was like the whinny of a horse, moaned aloud when something between her legs brushed against her panties in a sensual manner, and bearing down harder, she sighed in relief when the uncomfortable tightness abruptly vanished as her underwear and jeans came apart at the seams as a ponderous pair of horse testicles dropped into the sack that had been formed when her vulva had sealed shut and an black, erect penis that used to be her urethra and clitoris swung out and up to attention.<br />
<br />
Wide eyed, she stared at the erect member, torn between surprised by how huge it was and that she now had a cock and set of balls. Reaching down, she almost touched it, but at the last moment, took off her shirt and removed the shredded remains of her panties and jeans. Naked, she turned toward the mirror that was hung on the back of the bathroom door and peered at her reflection. Finally able to bring herself to touch the newest part of her body, she moaned in a sensual manner at the feel of her fingers against the tip and before she could change her mind, Lisa grasped the erect shaft with both of her hands and ran them up and down as she jerked off for the first time in her life.<br />
<br />
Oblivious to everything around her, Penny twisted her head one way, then another as she tried to look at the growths that now extended eleven feet from tip to tip. Watching as tendons and sinew formed as the wings took on the appearance of being what they actually were, she flexed and flapped them in an attempt to alleviate the new itch that came over them when the feathers started to grow in. Unaware that she was doing so, and that her mental awareness as a human had dropped by ten percent, she leapt up on the chair, shifted about until she was comfortable, squatted down to roost and continued to turn her head one way after another as she watched as best as she could the growth happening behind her. Finding it both disturbing and fascinating, she didn&#39;t hear the neighs of pleasure her friend uttered from the bathroom, as her attention was instead focused on trying to move her neo-appendages.</p>
