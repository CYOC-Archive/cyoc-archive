<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As John was working at making Ryan feel like the little kid he was, he heard some creaking and loud steps in the hallway.  Ryan did too.  It had to be one of the other guys.
<br />
Aside from being extremely embarrassed to be seen as he was, Ryan was also happy that one of his good friends was coming.  He couldn't believe how evil Johnny was acting.  This had to be the worst thing that could possibly happen.  There had to be a way out of this.  Ryan picked himself up clumsily and waddled toward the door on his short chubby legs.  Maybe Eric, Mike or Sei could help him find a way ro reverse this.
<br />
John saw the obvious excitement in Ryan's face and instantly figured out why he was happy.  &quot;Hmmm,&quot; he thought, &quot;maybe the rest of the guys shouldn't know the truth just yet.&quot;  He had a new plan and was about to let it unfold.  John grabbed Ryan's discarded t-shirt and pulled it over his barrel chest and ripped midsection.  He also picked up Ryan's size 13 Doc Martens and slipped his feet inside them.  After doing so, he took a few steps across the room, picked up Ryan rather abruptly and swung him over onto the bed.
<br />
Ryan, again feeling much more like a child, began to bawl.  John smacked him in the face and explained to Ryan that if he said one word about what had just happened, he would be in for a world of hurt.  Ryan reduced his cry to sniffling.  With large glassy eyes, he looked up to John and asked him, &quot;Pwease John, why don you hewp me?  I'm yo big bwotho.&quot;  Ryan felt absolutely pathetic sitting there, a naked three and a half year old completely at the mercy of his once younger brother.
<br />
John returned his question with a disgusted look and simply said, &quot;because I want you to know what it feels like to be the younger brother.  Besides, I don't know how the hell you got so puny and how I got to be such a stud.  How the hell am I supposed to do anything?&quot; 
<br />
Just then, the door was shoved open by Eric.  John flashed Ryan one of those &quot;don't say a word&quot; looks.
<br />
Eric took in the situation.  in front of him was a tall really built guy about his age with dark hair.  He was wearing Ryan's clothes, but Eric didn't realize that since the outfit consisted of a plain white t-shirt and jeans, something anyone could be wearing.  On the bed was a naked little blonde kid who looked just old enough to walk and talk.  He was a puny thing, all red in the face with tears streaming down the sides.  Eric deduced that John must be some sick pedophile trying to violate the poor kid.
<br />
However, before Eric could say a word John launched into his pre-fabricated lie about what he and Ryan where doing in the room.  He told Eric about how his car had broken down and how they were looking for help in the house.  His kid had gotten upset and soiled himself which explained his nakedness and the pile of clothes in the corner of the room.  John introduced himself as Ryan Holling.  
<br />
Eric reciprocated by introducing himself and informing John about how he and his friends had gotten stranded there.  Eric was completely believing John's story.  Ryan couldn't believe how gullible Eric was.  Even though it seemed like a credible story, John definitely had an obvious funny tone to his voice like he was hiding something.  Eric, however was never the brightest of the jocks and he didn't pick up onto it at all.
<br />
&quot;Perfect,&quot; thought John.  John told Eric that he should go find the rest of his friends while he would try to calm his kid down.  Eric agreed and turned around to find his buddies.  Before he left though, he turned around and took one last look at John and Ryan.  He felt sorry for the kid, he was probably cold in that drafty house with no clothes to keep him warm.  Eric crossed his hands over his waist and pulled his hooded baseball team sweatshirt over his head and wrapped the kid up in it.
<br />
Ryan felt so small and helpless especially being surrounded by Eric's big tanned arms.  In between sniffles, managed to squeak, &quot;Ewic, hewp me!&quot;  Eric was astonished.  How did this kid know his name?
<br />
&quot;Shit, he'll ruin my plan,&quot; thought John.  John's eyes wandered around the room as his mind reeled for an explanation.  As his eyes rested on the sweatshirt he found his explanation.  John blurted out, &quot;Oh look, Eric, he read your name off your sweatshirt!&quot;
<br />
&quot;Smart kid,&quot; replied Eric with a smile and headed out the door.
<br />
&quot;What a small-minded fool,&quot; thought John as Eric left, &quot;a college guy being outwitted by an eleven year old.&quot;  John smiled down at Ryan who was cringing in fear.  He thought John was going to kill him.  John had no intention of actually hurting Ryan, he just wanted to embarrass the poor kid and teach him a lesson. 
<br />
Eric strutted down the hallway and into the kitchen.  He heard a noise in the basement.  Turning toward the basement door he realized that his sandals were a little uncomfortable, his feet were sliding around in them a little bit.  Brushing that off as the leather straps getting stretched out, he started down the stairs, calling out Mike, Ryan, Sei and Johnny's names.  As he was heading down, he tripped and fell a few steps.  Hurting pretty badly, he sat up and realized his one sandal was missing and the other one was barely hanging off his foot on his outstretched leg.  His khaki shorts seemed loose in the waist and his sleeveless t-shirt was hanging loose over his torso.  It should have been tight since that was how he wore all his shirts.  Something was really wrong with the situation.</p>
