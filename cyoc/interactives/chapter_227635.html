<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Robin popped the chocolate into her mouth, angrily chewing as the events of the beauty pageant continued to eat at her self-esteem. As she chewed, she failed to notice the tingling in her lips begin. As she walked, the chocolate&#39;s effects were already starting to take effect. Her walking posture relaxed a bit more, turning from an angry stomp to more of a seductive sway. Her hair began to grow longer, slowly but surely. As she reached the bench, she finished chewing and swallowed the chocolate. Now the real fun would begin.<br />
<br />
Scrolling through her social media, Robin was startled to feel a twinge in her chest. She started to feel a little unwell, and chalked it up to disappointment and exhaustion. Standing, she grabbed her bags and began to walk for her car. Luckily she had parked close by, so she made it there quickly and started to drive home. All the while, the chocolate continued to work it&#39;s effects on her. As time continued to pass, she began to wonder why she was angry. All of a sudden, the anger that she had felt before felt distant, less important. It didn&#39;t seem to matter any more, though she couldn&#39;t figure out why. In fact, not much seemed to matter any more. She still remembered what had happened, but it just didn&#39;t seem to matter anymore.<br />
<br />
As she parked in the driveway of her house, and got out of the car to make the short walk to her front door, she paused. There was a tingling sensation in her chest. As she looked down, wondering if she had eaten something bad, she realised that she could seem them swelling beneath her very eyes. Shocked, she ran to the front door, unlocked it and let herself in. Dropping her bags at the front door, she ran to the mirror. Sure enough, her breasts were starting to grow. Hypnotised, she watched as they grew larger and larger. Pain rushed through her as her shirt struggled to keep them contained, but to no avail. She scrabbled at her shirt, clawing away at it and literally ripping it away and freeing the massive globes on her chest. They bounced and bobbled as they were released from their prison, and a wave of relief and pleasure settled on Robin. Her nipples hardened as they were exposed to the cool air, harding into inch-long nubs. Her breasts continued to swell, but Robin paused as she felt the same tingling happening in her hips. <br />
<br />
Struggling to look past the new massive orbs on her chest, Robin instead turned her eyes to the mirror in front of her. As she watched, she realised that her hips were widening out, pushing into a massively exaggerated hourglass figure. Her jeans strained and screamed as her hips pushed out until she heard as loud *SNAP* as the waistline burst. Her pants fell to the ground, leaving her in just her panties, which also burst and fell to the ground a moment later. Her ass expanded, bubbling out into a perfect sphere. As the physical changes slowed, Robin took a moment to spin and examine herself. The first thing she noticed was that her hair was much longer than it was before, now extending to mid-back. Her lips were fuller, more plush and her eyelashes were also longer. But all of these changes were completely dwarfed by the new mounds on her chest. Reaching up, Robin gently caressed the tip of the nipple of one of her new breasts. A shiver ran through her entire body, culminating on her pussy which grew damp. Damn, that was sensitive. Taking a deep breath, Robin placed both  hands on her breasts and squeezed. <br />
<br />
Stars flashed across her vision as bolts of pleasure shot through her body. Her pussy began to leak juices down her leg as she almost came from the pleasure which shattered her psyche. Robin fell to her knees as the haze faded from her mind. It was then that she noticed that her breasts were getting heavier. Heavier than they were before. Though the size and shape didn&#39;t change, she could feel the weight change as they stopped bouncing as much as before. Looking to the mirror which now seemed so much taller now that she was sitting on the ground, she watched in fascination as her nipples darkened, turning a dark brown color. Robin was having a hard timing thinking through the haze, but she vaguely remembered her biology lessons from school. Reaching up again, she took her nipples in hand and squeezed them. <br />
<br />
A spray of white liquid burst from each nipple, landing with a soft splatter on the mirror opposite her. Robin screamed as the pleasure culminated all at once, an orgasm wrecking her body and sending her from her knees to spasming on the floor as her pussy gushed juices everywhere. In a haze, Robin continued milking her breasts, milk flying into the air and landing on her body as she came over and over again, the endless cycle of pleasure repeating again and again and again. <br />
<br />
When she eventually came to, she lay in a pool of her own milk and pussy juices, soaked to the bone. Her hair was wet, plastered against her back. And yet, her breasts were still full. A stream of milk slowly traced it way from her nipple, down the massive valley which was her cleavage and pooled at the bottom them. Robin could only think of one thing right now. She needed something to fill her, and she needed it NOW!</p>
