<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It wasn't until Cody had mentioned it but Ty realized that he was now an even worse bully than his foster brother had ever been before. Dustin did treat him like a slave but he never took away his life as miserable as it was. <br />
<br />
“I guess you're right.” Ty felt so ashamed. “But you'll have to admit that he did make the last few a living hell for me.”<br />
<br />
“True but he never turned you into something you weren't.” Cody told his friend. “I don't know how or why you got this gift, but I do know that you are not a revengeful person. You were given the chance to help the weak. Hasn't he suffered enough?&quot;<br />
<br />
“I suppose you're right.” Ty knew that his friend was right once again but didn’t want to admit it.<br />
“You know I'm right and you know that you need to make it up to him for being so mean.” Cody watched as Ty just hung his head in shame.<br />
<br />
 Ty was almost ashamed to answer his friend. “I know now that I am no better than he was a few days ago but if I return him back to what he was it will start all over again.”<br />
<br />
“Have you forgotten that you can make him forget that he ever bulled you?” Cody said to his friend reminding him of his gift. When Ty raised his head Cody saw an evil grin. “I know that look, Ty ... what are you going to do?”<br />
<br />
“I just thought of a way to get Dustin to be nicer to others and at the same time make it up to him.” Ty said slyly.<br />
<br />
“How are you going to do that?” Cody said in a doubtful tone.<br />
<br />
“Step one; Make him forget what I did to him these last few days. Step two; Let him keep the memories of what he was so he will want to better himself so he can help others. And last but not least Step three; I will make him better than he was and still have my fun with him.”<br />
<br />
Ty closed his eyes and sent his foster brother a telepathic message. “Dustin, I want you to turn around and go back to the gym. You will think this action is your own idea.”<br />
<br />
“What did you just do?” Cody asked Ty when he saw his friend open his eyes.<br />
<br />
“I sent Dustin a telepathic message.”<br />
<br />
The two friends watched Dustin stop dead in his tracks causing the person that was too busy texting, to run into him. After saying he was sorry Dustin turned around and headed back towards the gym that he was denied admittance. To his surprise he saw his foster brother standing there by the door.<br />
<br />
“Out of my way Ty, I need to talk to the gym manager.” Dustin said with a determined tone.<br />
<br />
“We need to talk first.” Ty said in a low hypnotic voice.<br />
<br />
With a hand on his foster brother’s shoulder Ty guided Dustin to a nearby alley, with Cody close behind.<br />
<br />
When they got to a secluded corner Ty released his grip on Dustin’s shoulder. Dustin blinked a couple times as he regained his senses. For a second he didn’t know where he was until he saw his foster brother. Fearing what Ty might to him Dustin began to shake with fear. “Wha ... what are you going to do to me?” <br />
<br />
“Dustin, I'm sorry that I took away all of your hard work and made you a grade-schooler.” Ty said trying to apologize to Dustin. “I just want to make it up to you.”<br />
<br />
Dustin tried to cower as far back into the corner as he could.<br />
<br />
Ty prepared to lay out his plan to Dustin. “I can't take the chance that you won't tell someone about me if I give you back your normal life but I have a proposition for you. I will give you a little something extra for all the anguish I put you through in return for your silence. But remember I can always take it all back and return you to your present state.”<br />
<br />
With great hesitation Dustin agreed to Ty's proposal. Slow his body began to feel all tingly. The great pressure that kept him small released its grip on his body. With the pressure released Dustin's body started to return to normal.  The preteen body gave way to a teenage one which in turn matured into young adulthood. The boyish clothing he was forced to wear changed into something more befitting an older teen. It felt good to Dustin to have his old body back again but it didn't stop growing. With a puzzled look on his more mature face Dustin looked at his foster brother square in the face.<br />
<br />
“Ah, you noticed that didn't you.” Ty said when he saw the look on Dustin's face. “Here comes the “something extra” I was telling you about.”<br />
<br />
Dustin's six foot four height had returned but his weight kept growing. 190 ... 195  ... 200 ... 205 ... 210.  As the pounds were added on Dustin felt heavier and heavier. But these weren't pounds of fat being added on to his body they were pound of muscle. With each breath he took in inches were added to his girth causing his chest to stick out further. His growing arms pushed against his sides and his thicker legs pushed against each other increased the width of his upper and lower body respectively. His waist went through the least amount of growth but change it did. The formless midsection gave way to well defined set of abdominal, oblique’s and intercostal muscles that were needed to support the heavier upper torso.<br />
Dustin's growth had completely changed the bulky teenager into a massively built young adult. His tight form fitting clothing showed off the hours he must have spent in the gym obtaining the body it now covered.<br />
<br />
“Ty, this is incredible!” Dustin said in amazement feeling the muscles of his new body. “I love all these big muscles so much.”<br />
<br />
“You will able to keep this body but you will have to use it in a more constructive way.” Ty tells Dustin. “You will want to show it off as you become the protector of all those that you have bullied on in the past.”<br />
<br />
Cody was standing off to one side while Ty worked “his magic” on Dustin. He didn't want to interfere with what Ty was doing but he also wanted to make sure that he was doing the right thing by way of his foster brother. That was when he noticed a small detail that Ty had forgotten about. He reaches over and taps Ty on the shoulder and whispers into his ear.  <br />
 <br />
“I think you forgot something down there.” Cody said nodding towards Dustin's midsection. “He still is a little under developed if you know what I mean.”<br />
<br />
For a moment Ty has no idea what his friend is talking about. He gave Dustin bigger muscles than he had before. His weight has increased because of his new muscle mass making him look more intimidating. He even gave him a ... bigger  ... package. “D'OH I forgot the package.” Ty tell himself.<br />
 <br />
“Thank you Cody for pointing that out to me.” Ty pats his friend on the back. His hands lingers a bit longer feeling the broad muscles of the shoulders. “Dustin, I have been reminded that I have been remiss on giving you the perfect body. But now I'm going to correct that little oversight. I never told you this before but I’ve seen you naked in your bedroom before I got my “gift”. I now see why you were such a bully to me. You have an abnormally small penis for your age. I'll be nice to you and let you control the size of your penis for one time only.<br />
<br />
“But I ... Oh My Gaud!  What’s happening to my ...?” Dustin's question was cut short by a sudden pleasurable feeling in his groin. <br />
<br />
In the groin area of his tight workout shorts a bulge began to form. Larger and larger it grew until it was almost pornographic in size.<br />
<br />
“Dustin, you've got quite an imagination there. Are you sure you want it that big?” Ty said asking his foster brother. “Once it is done even I can't reverse it.”<br />
<br />
“Yes, do it now before I change my mind.” Dustin said quickly. For a brief second Dustin had a change of thought. Did he say how big I wanted it soft or hard? OH GAUD NO, if it is this big soft how big will it be hard?  “Ty wait I ...”<br />
<br />
But he was too late. Dustin overwhelming wave of fear changed to that of pleasure. It was very obvious to Ty and Cody what Dustin was feeling right at that moment. The large bulge began to elongate down one side of the shorts, stopping just short of the hem line.<br />
<br />
“OH MAN THIS BODY FEELS SO GOOD! Dustin shouted out loud for the entire world to hear. “I'M BIG ALL OVER!”<br />
“Yes you are big guy.” Ty tells his now bigger foster brother. “But remember it comes at a cost.” <br />
Dustin doesn't hear Ty's warning. He proceeds to go through a posing routine like he had seen many of the guys do in the gym. <br />
<br />
“Wait till the gym manager sees me now.” Dustin thinks himself. Thoughts of beating the crap out of the guy filled Dustin's mind. As he did his poses his body began to feel strange. He began to feel weaker and weaker with each passing moment. That's when he noticed his muscles were getting smaller. <br />
<br />
“Ty, what are you doing to me? The perplexed Dustin asked his foster brother.<br />
<br />
“It's all you. It’s always been all about you.” Ty walks up to the shrinking teen. “You will be able to keep the bigger body but only if you are a nicer person. Do you really want to make that guy pay for the way he treated you?”<br />
<br />
“Yes I do.” Dustin's shrinking body began to pick up speed. His body was just about back to his former size. <br />
<br />
“No I don't want to make his pay.” The shrink process stopped.<br />
<br />
“You want to forgive him don't you?” Cody asked Dustin.<br />
<br />
The idea of having to be nice to get what he wants begins to appeal to Dustin. “He is kind of cute in a ruff kind of way.”<br />
<br />
Dustin's body began to grow bigger once again. Kinder thoughts began to fill his head. <br />
<br />
“There was rumor going around the gym that the only reason he is still employed there is that his brother owns the gym.” Ty tells his little group of two.<br />
<br />
“My older brother heard that the reason the guy is in such a bitchy mood all the time is that his boyfriend of ten years ran off with a younger guy.” Cody added to the conversation.<br />
<br />
“Why don't you go talk to the guy and be a friend to him.” Ty suggested to Dustin.<br />
<br />
The kinder thoughts soon over took the mean and spiteful ones. Dustin's body began to grow faster and bigger.<br />
“See all you need to do is be nice to everyone and you get to keep your new body.” Ty told Dustin when his foster brother regained his larger body once again.<br />
<br />
“It does feel good to be nice to everyone.” Dustin said giving his small foster brother a man hug. Still no use to the bigger and stronger body he squeezed Ty a little too hard causing him to gasp for air.<br />
<br />
It was hard for him to breath in the grip of his foster brother’s bear hug. In a raspy low voice he bleeds with Dustin. “Dustin  ... please ... I need to  ... breathe!”<br />
<br />
Once he was free from the bear hug, still gasping for air, Ty reaches over to Cody for support in standing.<br />
“Sorry about that Little Bro. I guess I don't know my own strength.” Dustin says while flexing his right bicep.<br />
<br />
Ty recovered enough to be able to talk again. “No problem Big Bro. <br />
<br />
“I think I’ll go and have a talk with the gym manger and see if we can be friends.” Dustin says as he grips his now larger package giving it a good hard squeeze.<br />
 <br />
Both Ty and Cody watched Dustin, in the distinct muscular swagger, walk back around the corner towards the gym's front entrance.<br />
<br />
Cody was the first to speak. “Now don't you feel better being nice to your foster brother.”<br />
<br />
Ty, still had not fully recovered from the manly embrace, just turned towards Cody and gave his friend a dirty look.</p>
