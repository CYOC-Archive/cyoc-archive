<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Is something wrong?&quot; Jeff asked, when Ryan hadn&#39;t given him an answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;N-no,&quot; Ryan lied. He still felt like something was off. It was like he was missing something. Sure, a massive tiger man sitting on his bed should have been weird. That wasn&#39;t it thought. &quot;I just need to go to the bathroom,&quot; he settled on. Maybe just a few minutes alone would give him some idea what was wrong.<br />
<br />
Ryan went down the hallway to the bathroom. As the door closed, his older sister&#39;s door opened. Christina was waiting for her time to strike. Without her dad or Ryan in the way she could easily get to talk to Jeff alone. &quot;Hey there big guy,&quot; she stood in the doorway with just an oversized t shirt on. It was one of her ex-boyfriend&#39;s from the college they were going to. It just barely went over her lower half, leaving nearly nothing to the imagination.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sup,&quot; Jeff said, only glancing up from his phone. His eyes went back to the screen as he typed away at something.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that all you have to say?&quot; Christina asked. Her lithe body sauntered into the room showing off her hips as well as she possibly could. No man could ignore her for long. The whole reason her boyfriend was an ex was because he couldn&#39;t handle all the attention that she got. And he had this strange expectation that she wouldn&#39;t act upon felt so controlling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep,&quot; Jeff continued typing away at his phone.<br />
<br />
It was starting to annoy her as she plopped down on the bed next to him. Her hand graced his powerful bicep as she leaned in to get a better look at whatever he was doing. &quot;You&#39;re not the least bit interested in me?&quot; she asked as sweetly as she peered into his phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re not really my type,&quot; Jeff grinned, turning his phone to the side.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not your type?!&quot; Christina shouted. No man ever denied her. The absolute gall and arrogance to not be attracted to her was something she never heard before. But she had to calm down. &quot;Maybe I could be,&quot; she laid down against the bed, pulling her shirt up and exposing her vagina. A finger gently pushed inside of her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; Jeff laughed, watching her play with herself. &quot;You want to be my type?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course!&quot; she moaned loudly, twisting her legs as she continued to play with herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Jeff shrugged. &quot;I was going to test this out on Ryan, but oh well.&quot; He hit a few more buttons on his phone.<br />
<br />
Christina watched as she continued to rub her finger against her clitoris. Then a sudden shot of ecstasy shot through her entire body. Every muscle seemed to flex as she writhed on top of the bed. Never in her life had she felt so much pleasure surge through her. Christina continued to run her finger along that spot, not realizing that it was starting to grow. The small bump quickly grew larger. <br />
<br />
A strange feeling ran through her insides as they were developing to be her outsides. Ovaries turned into balls. A long shaft developed where a vagina had been. Christian stroked it. His back arched at the feeling. &quot;Bro!&quot; Christian groaned. He paused. Not only was it far deeper than it had been, but the word came out as though it was completely normal. It was just enough of a distraction to get him to pause. He cleared his throat. &quot;Bro,&quot; Christian tried asking again. If anything, his voice just grew deeper and more commanding. &quot;What&#39;s going on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m making you into my type,&quot; Jeff answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wh--&quot; Christian couldn&#39;t even get the word out as his dick cried out for more attention. He continued stroking it as his balls churned. Just the simplest touch sent him into a frenzy of sexual bliss. His back arched again as a deep primal grunt left his throat. An Adam&#39;s apple developed in his widening neck. &quot;Fuck man! Why&#39;s this feel so fucking good!&quot;<br />
<br />
Christian&#39;s hand started exploring his body. The petit and small frame he&#39;d always kept from working out changed drastically. Working out wasn&#39;t for losing weight it was for gaining muscle. The thoughts invaded his mind more and more as each of his workouts were about pushing himself further and growing larger. His arms doubled in size in and instant. Then a small pulsing continued as they passed the average man&#39;s. Thick veins ran up and down his biceps and forearms as more oxygenated blood coursed through his body feeding the growing muscles.<br />
<br />
Shoulders grew wider and molded into massive spheres on each side of him. Bones continued to grow thicker and longer as they added more to Christian&#39;s height. The same was true of his rib cage that gave him a far more imposing look. His soft bouncy breasts pulled against his chest into strong and powerful muscle. Strong abs developed were a smooth torso had been giving them a distinct cobblestone look.<br />
<br />
Dirty blond hair erupted from his skin causing a forest of hair to cover his body. Hair sprouted around his widening chin into a thick but well-trimmed beard that ran up the sides of his face. His long dirty blond hair pinned itself into a man bun that fit perfectly on top of his head. &quot;Oh fuck me...&quot; he moaned as a small amount of clarity hit him. He got a good look in the mirror and the strong smell of sweat was starting to fill the room. <br />
<br />
&quot;If you insist,&quot; Jeff smirked as he through Christian&#39;s muscular legs over his shoulders. His massive cock pressed up against Christian&#39;s asshole. The sudden pressure was too much and Christian ended up coating his hairy abs in cum. &quot;I didn&#39;t think I made you that sensitive,&quot; Jeff mocked as he pushed inside.<br />
<br />
Christian didn&#39;t even notice over his own moans for more. He begged for that cock to push deeper inside him. His asshole confirmed perfectly to the large rod and squeezed it just the right amount. Jeff&#39;s claws dug into the bed and the floor as he grunted with each thrust. &quot;God damn I made this hole too good...&quot; he moaned. His teeth clenched as he thrust again, holding onto the sensation as long as he could, but his dick had other ideas. His moan turned more into a roar as he finished inside the other man. <br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s thrusting turned wild as he felt his dick empty out into Christian&#39;s asshole. Each time twisting his head in delight as more of his cock was milked. &quot;God damn...&quot; he cursed again as he pulled out. &quot;I&#39;ll have to make a few adjustments. Even before he pulled up his shorts, he went back to his phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell?&quot; Christian asked. &quot;What happened to me!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm?&quot; Jeff turned to him. &quot;Oh that. I turned you into my type. That&#39;s what you asked for,&quot; he said with a bit of a cocky laugh. &quot;Feels pretty good, eh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? No!&quot; Christian lied. He couldn&#39;t deny that he enjoyed the feeling of being so large and the fact that the XL shirt that he had been wearing was now in tatters across his chest. Not to mention how he&#39;d just soaked it in his own fluids.<br />
<br />
Jeff smiled, rolling his eyes. &quot;Sure it doesn&#39;t,&quot; he said while typing on his phone.<br />
<br />
Christian felt his face blush as his cock had hardened again. Just looking at Jeff, he felt turned on all over again. He was almost fighting the urge to just jump back on his brother&#39;s bed and let the massive tiger fuck his ass all over again. &quot;Whatever,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever?!&quot; Ryan walked back into his room. &quot;Look at my room!&quot; he said at the huge wet spot on his bed. Not to mention Jeff&#39;s claw marks in his covers and carpet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t blame me,&quot; Christian started off. &quot;It&#39;s my fault for tempting Jeff to fuck me.&quot; The second part didn&#39;t come out right. He was going to blame everything on Jeff, but instead he blamed himself. &quot;The hell?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds like it&#39;s your fault!&quot; Ryan shouted. &quot;Damn it! You always do this!&quot;<br />
<br />
Christian was about to defend himself, but suddenly dozens of memories of him getting fucked by Ryan&#39;s friends filled his mind. He suddenly realized just how many people he&#39;d have use him as a cum dump. He tried to defend himself, only to come up with nothing to say. <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s alright man,&quot; Jeff interrupted. &quot;We can still hang out. What do you want to do?&quot;</p>
