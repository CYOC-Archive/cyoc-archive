<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Will Fraser was just a normal, smart 17 boy who was busy at school and had a good life with good friends. However he was always yearning for a different life, a simpler life, a life where he was  something special.<br />
<br />
He walked into class and sat down not seeing the note lying on it. He saw it as he was opening his books and decided to read it.<br />
<br />
To my new friend,<br />
<br />
You’re not happy with who you are, are you? Here&#39;s a game to make a change in your life. Have fun! I know I did! Your new friend.<br />
<br />
“That&#39;s strange....&quot;, Will thought, &quot;What sort of note is this? Who would give this to someone?&quot; He may not have wanted to admit it, but the note was right. He wasn&#39;t happy with who he was, and desperately wanted a change.<br />
<br />
He took a pen out of his pack with some trepidation and started the survey.<br />
<br />
1. If you were a girl, would your handwriting be nice?<br />
<br />
It would be extremely girly and neat.<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t notice that his handwriting was no longer his unreadable scribble but was beautiful handwriting.<br />
<br />
2. If you were a girl, would you like pink?&quot;<br />
<br />
No more than any other girly color.<br />
<br />
His pen changed to a nice light blue. <br />
<br />
3. If you were a girl, would your hair be straight or curly?<br />
<br />
I would want it to Straight and Wavy with it being incredible soft to touch.<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t notice his usually very greasy hair becoming soft and light on his head.<br />
<br />
4. If you were a girl, what would your favorite color be?<br />
<br />
Light Blue, Green and Pink<br />
<br />
Nothing Changed<br />
<br />
5. If you were a girl, what color would your hair be and how would you wear it?<br />
<br />
My hair would be a full dark blonde with it reaching just below my shoulders.<br />
<br />
He noticed an itch on the back of his shirt and moved his head to scratch it, only to see a strand of blond hair on his face. He couldn&#39;t believe it, was this note changing reality. He could finally live like he wanted to. He didn&#39;t care which sex.<br />
<br />
6. If you were a girl, what color would your eyes be?<br />
<br />
My eyes would be a deep, beautiful ocean blue that many people remark me on.<br />
<br />
Andrew felt like his eyes were very dry for a moment as his irises changed color, but a few blinks alleviated that.<br />
<br />
7. If you were a girl, what kind of skin color and what kind of complexion would you have?<br />
<br />
My skin color becomes a light golden tan ,that is flawless, smooth, and soft. My complexion is perfect.<br />
<br />
He shivered as his skin shifted, becoming more feminine and all the moles and freckles he had faded away, leaving flawless skin behind. The color darkened from his pale white skin which rarely went outside. Will paused for a moment to touch his skin. The touch gave him a wave pleasure awakening his still male organ<br />
<br />
8. If you were a girl, would you be sporty?&quot;<br />
<br />
I&#39;m very healthy and have a great metabolism. I also work out a lot to keep my self very toned but not too muscular, except for my ass which is extremely nice and bouncy.<br />
<br />
He felt as if he was seating on  a cushion as his new ass pushed out. He also felt himself lose some weight but felt much healthier and tight.<br />
<br />
9. If you were a girl, what over activities would you be involved with?<br />
<br />
I would be on the cheer leading team as captain as well as the main singer in the school musical as I have a beautiful voice. I would also play netball and run track.<br />
<br />
He felt his throat readjust and spoke, surprised and the soft voice which came out. His memories also flooded with sporting and cheer leading moves he had never heard of.<br />
<br />
11. If you were a girl, would you wear dresses and skirts?<br />
<br />
I would wear skirts and short cut pants all the time to show off my ass and designer dresses to show off my great figure. Occasionally I wear yoga pants.<br />
<br />
He felt his pants morph into a small skirt which reached about mid thigh. The wind was quite chilling on his man parts still.<br />
<br />
12. When you are a girl, how many siblings will you have?<br />
<br />
“Dropping the disguise, huh? Good, now we can get down to business” Will chuckled.<br />
<br />
My family is the same as it is right now except I also have a twin brother named Harry Fraser who is extremely good at running, swimming and rugby. He is also quite smart and good looking.<br />
<br />
13. When you are a girl, will you wear high heels?<br />
<br />
Yes, but only when going out. Usually I wear whatever is in fashion or a pair of flip flops.<br />
<br />
He watched as his feet became small and soft. His shoes became flip flops and he saw that his nail were painted a light green<br />
<br />
14. When you are a girl, will you wear jewelry?<br />
<br />
Yes, I wear small diamond earnings and amazing emerald and diamond necklace <br />
<br />
A piercing pain emanated from his ears as they shrank and diamond earnings set into the lobes. He felt cold metal on his neck.<br />
<br />
15. When you are a girl, would you have any other accessories like glasses or hairbands?<br />
<br />
I wear sunglasses outside and I have a small designer watch.<br />
<br />
16. When you are a girl, what size breasts will you have?<br />
<br />
C cup breast that are perky with moderate sized nipples.<br />
<br />
He felt a large weight on his chest as he squeezed them to make sure this dream was real.<br />
<br />
17. When you are a girl, will you be attracted to guys?<br />
<br />
Yes, my boyfriend is Alex Given who is the star player on the rugby team and the best runner in the city.<br />
<br />
He looked around to see the biggest jock in the school sitting right next to him/her as was turned on by him and all the other hot boys in the class.<br />
<br />
18. When you are a girl, what kind of shirt will you be wearing?<br />
I would be wearing a low cut shirt which matches my skirt due to my great sense of fashion.<br />
<br />
The plaid button down shirt she was wearing shifted, accommodating her new breasts and slim feminine torso.<br />
<br />
19. When you are a girl, will you shave?<br />
<br />
Yes, I am naturally very hairless and only have to shave under my arms.<br />
<br />
He felt a chill as his naturally hairy skin became smooth and clear.<br />
<br />
20. When you are a girl, will you use tampons or a pad?<br />
<br />
Excited by this question he quickly scribbled down: My flow is generally lighter. I wear pads on most days but if I&#39;m playing sports I wear a tampon for convenience.   My last period ended four days ago.<br />
<br />
Her grin widened again as she felt her genitalia pull inside becoming their female counter parts. She felt her internal organs shift around becoming female. She couldn&#39;t see, but her new vulva was nice and flat, just the way she hoped for. Her hips flared out slightly as her thighs and butt became more feminine while her waist pulled in. She loved her new hourglass figure.<br />
<br />
21. When you are a girl, what kind of underwear will you wear?<br />
<br />
Usually a thong but also a bikini briefs occasionally.<br />
<br />
She felt something slide between her butt and vagina and moaned in pleasure <br />
<br />
22. When you are a girl, what kind of bra will you wear?<br />
<br />
Right now I&#39;m wearing one that matches my panties. My breasts are perky enough to not need a bra, but I usually wear one because my nipples are sensitive.<br />
<br />
She felt a soft, silky material cup her breasts.<br />
<br />
23. When you are a girl, what will your intelligence be on a scale of 1 to 10 (1 being a ditzy bimbo and 10 driving the class nerd up the wall)?<br />
<br />
Thinking she was currently a 9, Will wanted a simpler life and decided on a 6, not being too dumb but not book smart either.<br />
<br />
24. When you are a girl, will you wear makeup?<br />
<br />
Only occasionally. My skin is so perfect that I don&#39;t need much makeup, but I occasionally do wear small amounts to accentuate my model like natural beauty.<br />
<br />
Her face became female and extremely beautiful like a face you would see at Miss Universe.<br />
<br />
25. When you are a girl, what is your age, height without shoes and weight without clothes?<br />
<br />
I&#39;m 5&#39;9&quot;, and 140 lbs. I&#39;m 17 years old. I will still look youthful when I am 40.<br />
<br />
Andrew shivered as she shrank from her current 6’0” down to 5&#39;8&quot; and lost some weight. Any remaining masculine features vanished. She was left with a fit, trim, slim, and very pleasing body. Her body was now completely feminine. She looked like her ideal female version he could think of.<br />
<br />
26. When you are a girl, what sort of libido will you have?<br />
<br />
Quite higher, I&#39;m horny very often.<br />
<br />
“Okay last question.” she thought to herself.<br />
<br />
27. Final question. When you are a girl, what will your name be?<br />
<br />
Michelle Elizabeth Fraser but most people called her Mich.<br />
<br />
After she wrote her name, “If you want to have a happy life as a girl, pass this on to the next person. Boy or Girl, don&#39;t matter.” Appeared at the bottom of the page.</p>
