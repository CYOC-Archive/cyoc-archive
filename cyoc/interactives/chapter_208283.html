<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Glen Trud was walking around the area as he had some free time when he saw the magic shop. A magic shop? Like supplies for a magician or something like that? Well, the shop seemed interesting enough, probably not a terrible place to kill some time until he had to head home. Once he got inside, the man realized that this shop wasn&#39;t where magicians go for their wares. In fact, it was probably more likely a place where witches go shop for their wares. There were so many strange and mysterious artifacts and curios. Some looked like regular objects, and some looked like they came straight out of the Necronomicon.<br />
<br />
There was one item that caught his eye, however. A belt with a dial on it labeled &quot;The Muscle Belt.&quot; What caught Glen&#39;s attention was how normal this item was compared to the rest of the items in this shop.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you interested in that product, Sir?&quot; Glen turned to where the voice came from and found a clerk approaching him, &quot;Ah, I see. You&#39;ve taken an interest in the Muscle Belt. Just put it on and set the dial to your desired muscularity while you wear it, and the belt will shift your body to your desired shape.&quot;<br />
<br />
A belt that lets you change how muscular you are, huh? Honestly, Glen didn&#39;t believe any of this Magic Mubo-Jumbo, but it made him think about his own body. He was a thin man with a slightly pudgy stomach, and while he didn&#39;t mind how his body looked, he couldn&#39;t say that he loved how it looked either. Maybe it was time for Glen to start using his company&#39;s gym.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell, you want. Normally this belt is $29.99, but for you, how does ten dollars off sound? Think of it as a new customer bonus.&quot; Ten dollars off, huh? Then it would make it cost around a regular belt. You know what; Glen did need a new belt.<br />
<br />
&quot;At that price? Sure I&#39;ll take it.&quot; It was pretty clear to Glen that the clerk gave him that deal to convince him to be a repeat customer. Not sure if Glen will be coming back, but hey! At least he got a good deal on a belt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for your patronage, sir. Let me wrap this up for you. Oh, also remember to read the manual for this.&quot; Glen paid for the belt and left the store, thinking that he wouldn&#39;t be coming back anytime soon. Oh, if only he knew.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------<br />
<br />
The next day, Glen was getting ready to head to work when he decided to wear his new belt. He wished that his roommate George was around to give him an opinion, but he was already out of the house. Looks like Glen had to rely on his own judgment to see if he looked stupid with this belt. The businessman took the belt, carefully slid it through the loops on his waist, and fastened it. Well, the belt wasn&#39;t bad looking except for the small dial on the side. It certainly looked out of place, but maybe it would be a good conversation starter or something. Maybe it could also help him keep track of the numbers he needed to remember. Glen turned the dial to the first setting, just as an example of needing to remember to get one thing when he felt a strange sensation pulse throughout his body.<br />
<br />
All Glen could do was gasp as he felt the strange sensation shift his body. It felt like his entire body was suddenly tightening and stretching. The sensation was over as soon as it started, but it left Glen feeling different. His clothes felt tighter too. Then, Glen&#39;s eyes widened as he realized what had happened. Glen quickly unbuttoned his shirt to find that the belt had worked as advertised. <br />
<br />
&quot;No way!&quot; Glen&#39;s body was now lean and defined instead of skinny-fat like before. Everything was just so tight and toned now, his arms, his shoulders, his pecs, and especially his abs. That pesky fat and love handles were gone and now was a lean six-pack. Glen never had abs before, so he was especially happy about that. He looked like a swimmer now, but he was curious what he would look like if he was a bit more muscular.<br />
<br />
The businessman, once again, turned the dial on the belt, this time to the second setting, and instantly the familiar tingling sensation flooded his body. Glen gazed at the mirror to see all of his muscles grow at once. His shoulders got wider and rounder giving him the beginning of a v-shaped. His arms had inflated beautifully buff proportions. His pecs gained more mass and pushed out further. His abs thicked with his obliques starting to come in. Finally, Glen noticed that his pants were feeling a little tight. Specifically in the legs and the rear, signifying that his legs were not left out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooh, this feels so good!&quot; Glen moaned to himself as he rubbed his new toned muscles. He just could believe that belt actually worked. Wait, didn&#39;t the clerk say something about a manual? Glen looked around and eventually found the bag and pulled out the manual. He was going to have fun with this.<br />
<br />
----------------------------<br />
<br />
Later, Glen arrived a work and was enjoying the attention he was getting. The dress shirt and pants that he was wearing weren&#39;t hiding his new physique at all.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, you&#39;re looking good, Glen. Are you working out, Glen? Damn, Glen, you&#39;ve got to tell me you&#39;re gym routine.&quot; These were the compliments he was receiving that made his confidence rise sky-high. And this was all from the second setting. Glen had to wonder how everyone was going to react when he chooses a higher setting or another function.</p>
