<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">„What are you doing?!“, the elderly, naked scientist asked shockingly. He just woke up – and was strapped onto a table!<br />
<br />
“Science of course! That is what you prioritized. Results. Papers. Research. We are all tired of your tyranny, Doctor Barbas!”, the young lab assistant laughed, as he strapped his Boss onto a lab table. Doctor Cameron Barbas couldn’t believe it. He just wanted to research this wave of light! But he also was relentless in his research. He betrayed donors of their donations, he used new lab assistants as guinea pigs, he forced all his underlings to work overtime every day without extra payment, and he declined all vacation requests. In short – he was not a nice boss.<br />
<br />
His lab assistant Alex Schwartz has had enough of this. Hoping that the wave of light will affect his boss, he wanted to make sure that HE was the one finishing this research. And if the wall didn’t affect Doctor Barbas, he would be fired anyways – and he very much didn’t mind. He wanted to quit next month anyways.<br />
<br />
Alex made sure to position the table with the strapped down Doctor into a perfect right angle to the wall of light. The doctor laid on his back, arms and legs stretched out – his feet would be the first part touching the light, which was only moments away from hitting the research facility. Alex wanted to make sure that the doctor could speak as long as possible before the light would hit his head and make talking impossible.<br />
<br />
“T minus 30 seconds, Doctor. Let’s hope you will be affected. It would be in your best interest to describe your feelings as detailed as possible”, Alex said with a wide grin and grabbed a pad to take notes.<br />
<br />
“No, no, please noWOOF WOOF AROOF”, was heared from the adjacent office. Apparently, the hot female scientist who was a bitch to all her co-workers was turned into a bitch for real.<br />
<br />
“You heard that, Doctor Barbas? Doctor Misato was apparently affected. I guess we’ll call her Missy from now on!”, Alex chuckled at his own joke.<br />
<br />
“You will be fired, Mr. Schwartz! I will destroy your career, your life, your future! I will not watch helplessly as you …”<br />
<br />
<i>Bzzzzzztttttt</i><br />
<br />
While Cameron Barbas was speaking, the wall of light appeared in the room. The golden, opaque light came right out of the white tiled wall and made its way to the table the Doctor was strapped on. Alex took a seat as far away from the light as possible to make as many notes as he could. He knew he could also be affected, but his colleagues would find his notes if he turned into a pet or object. Yes, object! A video from the day before went viral, as it showed the transformation of a banker into an ATM machine right in the middle of the sidewalk. It even was filled with money and connected to the network and power grid – it was unbelievable! That wall could almost change reality itself apparently.<br />
<br />
Alex turned on the screens showing a live feed from two cameras placed on the corners of the wall the light just went through. It was not see-through, so Alex had to watch the live feed after the wall hit the Doctor.<br />
<br />
Centimetres away from his feet, the Doctor could feel the buzzing of the wall on his skin … and then it touched him. He knew instantly that he was affected – people unaffected feel nothing when they touch the wall, like he did not feel anything all those years before. But now, he felt a tickling, buzzing sensation, as the wall went over him without mercy.<br />
<br />
“I … I can feel something … My toes seem to stretch …”, Cameron muttered – his scientific mind taking over. If he was going to be changed, he could at least help deepening the knowledge about this cursed wall.<br />
<br />
“Yes, I see the wall hitting your toes on the screens … It looks like …”, Alex furrowed his brows. Could this be possible?<br />
<br />
“What? Speak to me, what do you see?”, Cameron wanted to know.<br />
<br />
“It looks like … your toes are turning into fingers!”<br />
<br />
“Fingers? Am I turning into an Ape or …”<br />
<br />
“Not quite … I can notice ….”, Alex zoomed the footage in, “There are French nails. Those are the slender fingers of a female!”<br />
<br />
“What? How can … Ack!”, Cameron moaned as an audible crack went through his legs. Sound was able to travel through the wall of light without problems. “My feet … I can move them effortlessly! I can wiggle my toes like my fingers … that is so strange!”<br />
<br />
“Yes, I can see your new nails have a nice, pink colour … hey! I see you giving me the finger!”, Alex yelled.<br />
<br />
“Good – you don’t deserve any better!”, the Doctor chuckled.<br />
<br />
“The wall will hit your knees next … I guess they will turn into your elbows … yep. That was it!”, Alex mentioned after hearing another snap. “I must say, your hairy ugly legs make quite some tender arms, Doctor. I am curious what happens when the light hits your genitals!”<br />
<br />
Cameron gulped. “My .. why … oh no!”, he muttered. If his legs were finished turning into arms, then – following the logic of a human body – a head should be next! Will his pelvis become a head?! Penis? Testicles? <br />
<br />
Time seemed to skip for the Doctor as he thought about the words of his lab assistant, when suddenly, the light hit his groin – and where the light of the moving wall hit the tip of his glans, a much bigger mass appeared out of the wall from the other side.<br />
<br />
“It … feels … strange … my … penis …”, the doctor muttered and looked at Alex … but he was spellbound to the screen the Doctor couldn’t see. If Cameron would have been able to watch the feed, he would have seen that the tip of his cock was indeed turning into the tip of a head. Blonde hair flowed from that head and much more hair appeared right where the wall passed over his cock. Alex saw that closed eyes have appeared on the newly growing head, and as the wall passed over that last eyelash … they opened wide. Beautiful, baby blue eyes whirled around frantically, as if they were not sure what to focus on first!<br />
<br />
“I … I can see the other side of the room … it is so strange … Like having four eyes …”, Cameron muttered incoherently. Apparently, he was going into some kind of shock - but the wall still moved further. A dainty, upturned nose appeared and started to inhale deeply as the wall passed the little ridge under it … and then, the wall hit Cameron’s balls. His testicles vanished as the wall passed through him, and a very, beautiful mouth appeared from the other side of the wall … making sounds.<br />
<br />
“Mhhhmmmm”, it made, as beautiful, thick, red lips appeared.<br />
<br />
“What is happening?!” Cameron asked the hundredth time. “Wha I haening”, the new mouth exclaimed at the same time. Alex couldn’t move his head or even blink, as he watched that bizarre event. Finally, the wall has moved to the Doctor’s bellybutton – but a very beautiful woman’s face blinking fast was where an old man’s genitals have been seconds before.<br />
<br />
“Like, where am I? What is happening to me? What is, like, this totally shiny wall?”, the woman’s head asked. Her voice was high-pitched and sexy … and sounded very bimbo-ish! Since her head has been fully formed, it appeared that she was able to speak on her own now.<br />
<br />
“I … I can feel it move its mouth … This is not possible … What … if… what … my … head …”, Cameron stuttered in shock. The wall moved further, and as it passed his belly button, a huge set of boobs appeared out of the passing wall. The moment the wall touched the Doctor’s collarbone, the massive set of tits – easily EE-Cups! – were finally free and didn’t touch the wall anymore, so gravity pulled them down and they flopped onto the girl’s belly. The wobbling of those milky, soft globes lasted for at least fifteen seconds.<br />
<br />
“Tehee … it feels so strange, like, if there is a mouth between my legs!”, the woman’s face said.<br />
<br />
Cameron was only whimpering anymore, as the light touches his armpits. His hairy, wrinkly arms vanish into the light and reappeared as the beginning of soft, smooth thighs. His whole body lifted up some centimetres, as his back became round and slowly, a perfect, thicc bubble butt pushed it up – but that was not what his mind was focused on. The light was nearing his chin! <br />
<br />
As it touched his face, he tried to jerk away, but wasn’t able anymore! The skin became tender and smooth, his beard vanished, and a soft fuzz reappeared behind the wall, and as the doctor muttered his final words … he could feel his mouth turning sideways. His Tongue and teeth turned into sticky, female lubricant. The aroused, puffy lips of a young collage aged girl were in the place a mouth was stuttering only seconds ago!<br />
<br />
“AHHHHNNNNN”, the high-pitched bimbo voice moaned out loud, as the nerve-endings of a mouth turned into the sensitive nerve-endings of female genitals!<br />
<br />
Alex gulped, as he watched the nose, eyes, and forehead of his former boss vanishing behind the wall of light. Jerking arms and fingers morphed into tender legs and tiny feet, and suddenly, the table the woman was constrained to was behind the wall of light! With a sigh, Alex stood up, took a deep breath, and walked straight through the wall of light. There was no escape anyways! He sighed again in relief, as he passed the wall without any strange feelings – he was not affected again!<br />
<br />
“Help! Please! I don’t know, like, what’s going on! This is totally not cool!”, the girl pleaded.<br />
<br />
“Here, let me help you!”, Alex said and quickly opened all restrains. The girl sat up and lifted her hands closely, observing the beautiful, manicured nails.<br />
<br />
“Do you … do you know your name?”, the young lab assistant asked – and saw that in the corner of the room laid a purse, where the doctor’s briefcase was before. That corner was a blind spot for the cameras.<br />
<br />
“My name … is … B .. Bambi I think!”, she muttered and lifted her bountiful boobs with her fresh, new hands. Alex, watching this naked lady playing with her goods, started to blush and walked to the purse and crouched down to open it. It was a fake designer purse, and inside he found a mingle-mangle of eye-liners, tampons, a … mini vibrator, condoms …<br />
<br />
<i>Damn, she must be quite the slut</i>, Alex thought, as he finally found a wallet. He opened it and looked for some ID.<br />
<br />
Name: Bambi Cumminghard<br />
Sex: F<br />
Age: 19<br />
Height: 5’5 ft.<br />
Eye colour: Blue<br />
Occupation: Exotic Dancer<br />
<br />
<i>Huh, so Cameron Barbas went to Bambi Cumminghard … and it looks like she is quite the bimbo. How ironic!</i>, Alex thought … and heard a high-pitched giggle right behind him! He turned around, and … saw straight into the glistening groin he already saw on the screen before!<br />
<br />
Bambi stood before him and winked.<br />
<br />
“Like, thanks for freeing me. I am horny now, and I wanna reward my hero – wanna lick my pussy?”, she asked and pushed her hips right into Alex’ face!<br />
<br />
“Hmmgn”, he tried to say, but as his tongue entered those sensitive lips … he just grabbed her thicc bubble butt and pulled her into him. Alright, what the hell. It seemed that the balls of the former doctor transformed into that sex-crazy bimbo brain of hers.<br />
<br />
“EEEP! Ohhh, you are so strong! I like strong men!”, she happily sighed as he manhandled her roughly and started to coo and moan in bliss.<br />
<br />
Alex closed his eyes and thought about the doctor, as he gingerly tried to bring her to orgasm. Could Cameron feel his tongue? Was he still aware?<br />
<br />
<i>Time for some more research!</i></p>
