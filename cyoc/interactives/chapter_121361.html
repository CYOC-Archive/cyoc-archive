<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Hello and welcome to a brand new episode of Animalia Ambassadoria.&quot; Said Abby, showing off her new gold medal from the Triathlon event.<br />
<br />
&quot;Today we look at new plans for next year, future plans for Animalia colonies, and some laughs from the IAC.&quot; Said Sarah.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll also meet a few of the competitors from the games and talk to them briefly.&quot; Said Malice.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
&quot;One of the plans is to have a kind of parkour obstacle course similar to what cane be found in nature.&quot; Said Sophie, reading a list posted from Anderson about future events.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you want to suggest an event for next year&#39;s IAC Games, post the idea on the website for reviews.&quot; Said Roland, &quot;we can&#39;t guarantee your event idea will be in the games next year, but we will definitely have a look at your suggestion.&quot;<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
&quot;So Judy,&quot; began Sarah, &quot;We heard that the giant squid attack near Mieni Atoll is prompting new research into the virus&#39;s capabilities.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;While I shuddered when I saw the beast,&quot; said Judy, shuddering a little, &quot;it&#39;s appearance is making the scientists think about uplifting deep sea specimens, such as the angler fish, to explore the depths. Part of the reason is to find out the inspiration for the infamous kraken.&quot;<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
&quot;So how does the building of the new museum going?&quot; Asked Malice, talking to Joe through video chat.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s actually going quite well.&quot; Answered Joe. &quot;We&#39;re getting help from both Australia and Japan in building the structure proper. Several Polynesian tribes are offering to make modern replicas of their cultural art and are donating several canoes of their craft to the museum. But the biggest part will be the Giant Squid Exhibit.<br />
<br />
The study of the giant squid is complete, and the resin block that will be preserving it is well underway. We will also be adding several references to giant squid and similar creatures to the exhibit, such as the encounter with the giant squid from the classic Disney adaptation of &#39;20,000 Leagues Under the Sea&#39;. <br />
<br />
We will be celebrating the grand opening of the museum with an all-you-can-eat sushi bar, and we would like you to be there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds like fun.&quot; Said Sophie, &quot;Animalia Ambassadoria will definitely be there to cover it.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
&quot;We now welcome Thunderhoof, one of the competitors in the finals for the IAC Super Heavyweight Bodybuilding Competition.&quot; Began Abby as he came in. He was a storm grey Clydesdale Animalian with darker grey tail and mane. When he appeared in his posing &quot;thong&quot; and sat down on the couch, there was a lot of digital swooning contents.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what prompted you to become part of Project Phoenix?&quot; Began Sophie, trying not to stare at his abs, or his Adonis belt, or his bulge.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, I was part of the Animalia Reinvention Program.&quot; Said Thunderhoof, sadly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, why was that?&quot; Asked Roland, doing his best not to pry.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was originally a lawyer that was drawn into McCarthy&#39;s accusatory web against my will.&quot; Answered Thunderhoof, even more sadly, &quot;After that, the political fallout destroyed my career, but I managed to get my revenge when I helped shred the accusations of a communist conspiracy in the military, and later condemn McCarthy.&quot; At this, he grinned in the kind of pleased way that people do when they help bring down the very figure that ruined them. &quot;President Eisenhower managed to get me a quiet place to start over as an apology for what I endured.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what got you into the ARP?&quot; Asked Malice, all of that going over her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Replied Thunderhoof, truly looking it, &quot;but that information is classified.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;To quote Mass Effect 3,&quot; said Roland, &quot;That&#39;s just the government&#39;s fancy way of saying &#39;mind your own business.&#39;&quot; This sparked a storm of conspiracy theory comments.<br />
<br />
&quot;But to make up for it,&quot; said Thunderhoof, brightening up significantly, &quot;here is something amusing that happened to me before the IAC Bodybuilding Competition began.&quot;<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
The clip began with Thunderhoof sitting at a bar, showing how he had lost the taste for alcohol with his conversion, and ordering a fruit juice. Next, a woman came over to him, her flushed face and slight wobble walk showed that she had a bit more to drink than usual. After some conversation (and a few more drinks for the girl), she began flirting with him, which led to the inevitable:<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve *hic* got shomplache you can belongsh.&quot; She slurred, leaning into him seductively.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Asked Thunderhoof, mentally counting down in his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yesh.&quot; Slurred the would-be Juliet, &quot;Between my shoft-&quot; But that was as far as she got. She fell off her barstool, knocked the bowl of pretzels off the bar (which landed on her head, by chance or fate), and promptly passed out. Shaking his head, Thunderhoof slung her over his wide shoulder, and carried her out to the Animalian version of the &#39;drunk tank&#39;. But it was clear, from his facial expression, that her mumbling was something not intended for polite audiences.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
After a few laughs between the group, Malice, with tears of mirth in her eyes, asked, &quot;So now what do you do for money?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;While it IS true that a lot of us are dancers/performers at the Meat Market,&quot; said Thunderhoof, still whickering slightly, &quot;That is only a part-time job. We actually have other occupations as well. I myself actually work as a construction worker.&quot;<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
&quot;We now go live to the Grand Amazon River Hotel and Casino, where construction of a future Animalia Colony is under way. Our representatives there, Mandíbula and her new mate Crânio, are going to tell us about how things are going there.&quot; Said Sarah, as Mandíbula and Crânio logged in to video chat.<br />
<br />
&quot;So how are things going there?&quot; Began Abby.<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re going good.&quot; Answered Mandíbula, still getting used to this form of communication. &quot;We&#39;ve got the major parts done, but the electric wires are still getting worked on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anything being done about that mosquito colony we encountered on our first trip?&quot; Asked Abby, remembering what took flight when they first entered the property.<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;ve actually released a kind of fish called gambezi, or mosquitofish, that was specially bred to bring down mosquito egg and larva populations into the pool where you mentioned such a thing happening.&quot; Answered Crânio, even less used to this form of communication than Mandíbula. &quot;But future plans are in works to control the mosquito population.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;On a different topic,&quot; began Roland, remembering what they had found at the hotel, &quot;Any news on the ancient burial ground Melbourne was excavating?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The archaeological authorities in Manaus have determined that what was found was more than just a burial ground.&quot; Said Mandíbula, reading the update from the dig site. &quot;It turns out that what was found was a kind of meeting place between various Amazon River Basin tribes as a kind of neutral ground.&quot;<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s all the time we have for today.&quot; Said Sarah, after some more announcements, funny clips, and scenes from the IAC, &quot;Tune in this Friday for the official Closing Ceremony for the IAC, and see you all next time in the wilds of Animalia.&quot;</p>
