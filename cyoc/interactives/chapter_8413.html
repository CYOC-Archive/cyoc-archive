<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With a sigh, Scott slid off the couch onto the floor, his pumpkin-sized balls pushing <br />
his legs apart under the coffee table.  &quot;No,&quot; Scott said, looking at the small rabbit.  <br />
&quot;I'm an enormous cock and balls with a racoon attached,&quot; he replied with one paw on <br />
the head of his dick as it stretched up towards his chin.<br />
<br />
Saul inched forward, wanting to get next to the oversexed giant before he shrank too <br />
small to enjoy this.  A broad, pink tongue escaped Scott's lips as his erection swelled <br />
unabated.  Big, black whiskers twitched as Scott licked himself, wrapping one arm <br />
around his shaft to hug it to his chest.  Saul felt his diminishing member harden at <br />
the sight, and he quietly slid under the table and headed for the swelling orbs before <br />
him -- each one seeming taller than his entire, still-reducing body.<br />
<br />
Tim felt his balls tightening up as he watched Scott service his growing member.  It <br />
was already face-to-face with the hairy beast, and was beginning to stretch above <br />
Scott's eyebrows.  Tim had to put a hand on the wall to steady himself as his center of <br />
gravity shifted, his own formitable member straining against gravity as it inflated.  <br />
Finally, Scott's member extended past his head, and with obvious force of will he held <br />
it to one side, looking towards Tim.  &quot;You say the box did this?&quot; Scott asked, <br />
gesturing towards the box on the table and Tim nodded.  &quot;It's time it did something <br />
else,&quot; Scott said.<br />
<br />
Scott ran his free paw along its front.  One of the stones had a down-arrow.  That <br />
seemed promising.  Another stone had a circle joined with a down-arrow, and it <br />
seemed to be stuck in the &quot;pressed in&quot; position.  Running his claw around the second <br />
stone, he discovered that it was a circle and arrow, but unlike the down-arrow stone, <br />
this stone rotated freely in space and would stay in any direction it was pointed.  <br />
Scott frowned.  He turned it until it pointed down too, pressed in the down-arrow <br />
stone, and opened the box.<br />
<br />
A puff of smoke tickled his delicate whiskers as dust settled on his giant rod, his furry <br />
face, his strong arms, and his rotund belly.  Clapping the boxtop closed again, he put <br />
a hand down to scratch behind Saul's ears as the small bunny nosed his enormous <br />
balls, easily twice the rabbit's size.  Saul seemed to have stopped shrinking, Scott <br />
noticed.  A little small for a bunny, but not too small to tickle his sensitive globes.<br />
<br />
Scott looked over to Tim.  The fox-man had managed to right himself by leaning <br />
against the wall, his stiffening member now pointing more &quot;up&quot; than &quot;out&quot;.  Whether <br />
in response to his small friend's ministrations, seeing Tim's excitement, or entirely on <br />
its own, Scott felt pressure starting to build up in his cock.  It felt tighter, was starting <br />
to tingle and was definitely getting harder.  He put both paws on the tip and started <br />
massaging.  Each touch felt electric, and Scott was soon rubbing his paws all over the <br />
end of his cock, trying to stroke its thick sides with both of his muscular arms at the <br />
same time.  Even Saul's small touches seemed to be amplified by his body now.<br />
<br />
He felt it in his arms first.  His shaft was thinning.  His hands confirmed it, feeling the <br />
tip of his dick narrow.  Then he saw it starting to retract ever-so-slightly towards his <br />
crotch.  It was as rigid as a board, and he knew he was going to cum any second, so <br />
he started licking the shaft with his wide tongue.  Somehow, his dick didn't explode <br />
as it contracted.  It seemed to get even tighter as it gave up each centimeter, and <br />
Scott was soon well beyond the normal intensity where he would have orgasmed.<br />
<br />
As the tip of his hard member retreated back to the point where he could lick it <br />
properly, Scott wondered how small he wanted to be.  Stretching his mouth over the <br />
tip as best he could, it was clear there were advantages to having a dick long enough <br />
for self-sucking.  He giggled and grumbled as it gently teased him, contracting <br />
gradually and making him bend his neck slightly.  His whole body started to buzz as <br />
his sexual intensity climbed.<br />
<br />
Tim stumbled over to Scott, and climbed onto the couch behind his large comrade-<br />
in-changes.  He hefted one of his basketball-nuts to each side of Scott's head, resting <br />
them on his broad shoulders as they spilled forward.  Reaching over their mass, he <br />
raked his claws through the fur on Scott's front, scratching his chest and arm <br />
muscles.  Leaning down, Tim nuzzled Scott's sensitive ears with his own pointy <br />
muzzle, breathing softly.<br />
<br />
Scott's eyes were closed, his lips wrapped around the end of his shrinking cock as it <br />
dropped to chin-level.  With Saul gently tickling his huge balls and thighs, and Tim <br />
now aggressively petting his strong upper body, Scott's whole body felt like an echo <br />
of his cock.  He felt his muscles stiffening, and it became harder to breathe.  Finally, <br />
he took his mouth off his dick to gulp for air and his climax finally exploded.<br />
<br />
Scott trembled as the energy was released from his orgasm into the rest of his body.  <br />
He felt his arms and legs shake as his dick pulsed, pumping unknown amounts of <br />
cum into the room.  His butt slid on the floor, and the couch moved behind him as <br />
tension was suddenly released from every part of his body.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's working!&quot; chirped Saul from under the table, sounding just a little disappointed.  <br />
It was definitely working, Tim mused watching the white jet arc towards the ceiling, <br />
pleased by the intensity of Scott's orgasm.  Tim felt his balls shift against Scott's <br />
head, and he looked down to see Scott slumping as he convulsed in pleasure.  <br />
Slumping?  No, he saw: Scott was shrinking.</p>
