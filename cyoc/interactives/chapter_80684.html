<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I, Princess Sara of the West Kingdom was now a hand puppet like those you'd see in a Punch and Judy show and <br />
for the first time it didn't look like I'd be changing back anytime soon.<br />
<br />
I thought back through the sequence of events that led to this. First of course was me being kidnapped by the <br />
Witch Morgana. I was on my way home from a visit to one of the Kingdoms orphanages where I'd had out food and <br />
hug the poor, unfortunate little children when my carriage came to a sudden stop. My body guard Betram told me <br />
to wait inside the carriage whilst he went to ask the cab driver what the hold up was. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure it isn't anything bad, Bertram, you silly goose!&quot; I said as I stepped out, &quot;The streets of the West <br />
Kingdom are the safest in the land!&quot;<br />
<br />
I held my long dress above my ankles as not to dirty it, step-mother would scold me dearly if I got my <br />
expensive clothes messy, and looked around. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why Bertram it's just a lost little child!&quot; I exclaimed. <br />
<br />
A sorry looking little girl in nothing more than rags stood tearfully rubbing her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Step away from her, m'lady&quot; Bertram said sternly.<br />
I ignored him and asked, &quot;Whatever is the matter, dear?&quot; whilst leaning over to wipe the little girls tears <br />
with my handkerchief.<br />
<br />
&quot;I need a Princess,&quot; she had said much to my confusion. She grabbed my hand and in shock I instinctively <br />
turned tried to step back. As I did so I noticed the small mouse sat on the cab mans seat, desperately looking <br />
for a way down from up so high, and no sign of the cabbie at all. I turned to face Bertram and he too was <br />
missing. <br />
<br />
A tug on my arm pulled my thoughts back to the little girl and seemed to loose my footing and fall backwards. <br />
Next I was swinging through the air, the childs big, strong hand the only thing keeping me from falling in the <br />
gutter.<br />
<br />
The child was a giant to me now and I swung back and forth at her size as she skipped passed a loud and <br />
frightened goose. She giggled and sang happily &quot;Tra, la la, la la!&quot; through the streets and I caught her <br />
reflection in a puddle. She was swinging a teddy bear in a blue dress.<br />
<br />
It wasn't long before I was in her home in the forests and she had grown into a rather stunning, raven haired <br />
beauty who looked to be in her late twenties. I was once again my self and in a cage.<br />
<br />
She told me I was bait to lure Princes whom she'd then transform into whatever took her fancy, the first of <br />
which was the golden Prince Jake who became a vapid teen girl and sold into slavery and soon many Princes had <br />
become an all manner of things. She enjoyed this all little too much but I got the distinct impression she was <br />
doing it as some sort of rebellious campaign against the male dominated rule makers as much as it was about <br />
her getting herself off.<br />
<br />
On one such encounter a lovely elven ranger named Maedel was turned into a tree along with the Prince she <br />
served. I had begged Morgana not to use her as fire wood and as an uncharacteristic act of kindness, Morgana <br />
restored her... apart from the fact she still had wooden skin.<br />
<br />
Maedel an I became fast friends. Partly, out of necessity, I suppose you could say, seeing as we were forced <br />
to share a bed together - NO not like that...<br />
<br />
Where I was prudish and meek, Maedel was crass and boisterous. She claimed to not be &quot;fruity&quot; like other elves <br />
but I became convinced she wasn't strictly a &quot;meat-eater&quot; either. Gosh! That sounds much lewder than I had <br />
meant it too...<br />
<br />
Later another bizarre rescue attempt was made. This time by the cocksure Princess Connie that cut her hair <br />
short and wasn't afraid of rough housing like the boys. Morgana saw to it that she'd be making love and not <br />
war after a few modifications that turned her into something of a sex addict. Her father, the King of Molossia <br />
came to rescue her by trading the soldiers he had with him to Morgana. <br />
<br />
The King made sure his wayward daughter wouldn't be rough-housing WITH the boys by keeping her in a chastity <br />
belt.<br />
<br />
Soon after, another Prince came to rescue me. This time my own brother! Morgana refused to let him stay <br />
without being transformed and he refused to leave and I... well I didn't want to leave either... The result <br />
was my brave and heroic little brother became his own fantasy of the moment - an elf ranger modeled after <br />
Maedel! And being a chauvinistic lecher his fantasy was a sexy submissive. Oh brother you do cause some <br />
trouble but not as much as our mother!<br />
<br />
Father had apparently died and step-mother was planning to marry the King of Molossia and to hand the whole of <br />
the West Kingdom over to him! The entire West Kingdom handed over to a King from the smallest, loser Kingdom <br />
that didn't even control a whole city and its sorry excuse for a castle was in fact a disused bank!<br />
<br />
Well, needless to say, I was having none of this and neither was Morgana. She went to Molossia and declared <br />
war in order to become the Queen of the little Kingdom and prevent the marriage. She also brought back some <br />
more Molossian Soldiers, now buxom wenches.<br />
<br />
The war looked to be going in our favor with our army of wenches but it took a sudden turn for the worse. <br />
Morgana accidentally turned herself into a toilet and we were all imprisoned... That is until Morgana's <br />
daughter showed up - the half-Dragon Knight Ariadne.<br />
<br />
We escaped while she attacked the city with the help of our dear mother the prude who had undergone a shocking <br />
transformation into a big bosomed, red and black rubber clad jester cursed to act a fool. Meanwhile, Ariadne <br />
was captured. But looking back it was probably the toilet thing that had got me to where I am now, afterall <br />
there was a chamber pot in the prison we could have used instead...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I watched from my place as a hand puppet, perched atop my own hand, as Morgana watched my jester body and <br />
those of my brother and mother, as well as Maedel (now a pinocchio style puppet) were forced into a silly can-<br />
can dance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for rescuing me from that disgusting King, mother,&quot; said Ariadne with scorn in her voice as she <br />
glanced at the enormous sow that had been the King.<br />
&quot;I, uh heard about your transformation into...&quot; Ariadne began.<br />
&quot;Quiet, Ariande!&quot; Morgana said raising a finger to her lips, &quot;No-one will ever speak of that again or face the <br />
consequences.&quot;<br />
<br />
Clearly, Morgana was still quite upset about having been transformed into a toilet and it seems that could <br />
very well be why she turned on me. I knew she planned to take the Kingdom of Molossia for herself but she <br />
didn't have to take my Kingdom too! There had to be a way to get back in her good books....</p>
