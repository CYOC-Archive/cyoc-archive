<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Troy rested his head on Lancer&#39;s chest. He liked the feeling of just being next to someone else. Even if he could barely fit on the couch with Lancer on his side, he enjoyed the thick arm wrapped around him. The only thing that would have made it better was if he was still in his Leonin form. Troy still counted his blessings. He stared off for a moment before noticing the large blade resting in its scabbard. <br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s this?&quot; Troy asked. Even if he knew full well it was a sword, he&#39;d never properly held one. He reached down from the couch, a bit further than he expected and then fell. <br />
<br />
Lancer looked over the edge of the sofa at him. &quot;Hmmm?&quot; then noticed where he was reaching. &quot;My sword?&quot; Without much effort, he stepped over Troy&#39;s small body and around the remnants of the coffee table. It unsheathed with a perfect sounding &#39;sheenk&#39; and almost seemed to glisten in the light. &quot;I was gifted this when I was promoted into being a paladin. It&#39;s far from the best sword I own, but it&#39;s easier carrying around when off or relaxing in my chambers.&quot; With one hand he easily swung it around like it was nothing. Even though he&#39;d shrunk a couple of inches, he still looked to be built for just about anything.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I see?&quot; Troy asked. &quot;I&#39;ve never held a sword before...&quot;<br />
<br />
Lancer looked a bit concerned. &quot;Sure,&quot; he said, handing it over with two hands. One gripping the hilt while the other laid flat against the blade. &quot;Be careful though. It&#39;s still a weapon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure. Sure,&quot; Troy dismissed. Until he actually held the piece of metal. His whole body almost toppled over as Lancer removed his hands. Only a bit as he caught the smaller man before he could actually hurt himself. &quot;Woah... That&#39;s heavy...&quot; Troy looked over the piece of metal, now using both hands. It was supposed to be used with a shield, but with how big Lancer&#39;s hands were, Troy could fit both easily on it. &quot;How do you hold this thing...&quot;<br />
<br />
Without the fur, it was a lot easier to see the other man blush. &quot;Just a lot of training...&quot; Lancer said. &quot;Here let me show you.&quot; He ducked around the sword and moved his way to Troy&#39;s back. His arm reached out, and hand completely engulfed Troy&#39;s. &quot;Now, you don&#39;t want to have a loose grip or a grip like you&#39;re trying to strangle a goose. Something tight enough to hold onto the blade but loose enough that you still have full movement in your arm.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lancer held the blade up, taking a lot of the weight off of Troy. He could feel the movement as Lancer guided him through a swing. &quot;Woah...&quot; Troy muttered as he watched the blade move around. Somehow it flowed through the air like it was completely weightless. It was also helpful feeling the strong man right on his back. Those massive arms swaying with his weak ones. Or how his lightly bearded face rested on Troy&#39;s shoulder, speaking so confidently about something Troy knew nothing about. Games and moves had always made it seem like sword fighting would have a ton of flipping or action. But the gentle way Lancer swung the sword, it was obviously much slower and more meticulous. No movements that could easily lose you an arm or a leg. No fanciful dancers that were set to music. Just simple acknowledgment of the danger and just as simple of movements to counter it. <br />
<br />
It was barely even a minute before Troy&#39;s arm felt like jello. His body just wasn&#39;t made for this kind of action. And feeling those hard, well worked muscles against his body, made it all the more clear that he wasn&#39;t meant to be a fighter. Let alone a paladin. &quot;Hey,&quot; he actively moved against Lancer&#39;s movements. &quot;I&#39;m getting pretty tired...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah?&quot; Lancer looked down at him concerned. &quot;I didn&#39;t go too far did I m--&quot;<br />
<br />
Troy gave him a glare knowing full well what was about to come out. &quot;No... It&#39;s just that I&#39;m feeling a bit tired. Let&#39;s go lay down again.&quot; He made sure to set down the sword and then pull Lancer back to his bedroom. &quot;I just want to lie with you. Shift.&quot; Claws, fur and sharp teeth quickly grew in. Along with his rounded ears and a tail that swooped down his back. Lancer looked down at himself. &quot;You look better this way,&quot; Troy smiled still pulling at the now massive lionman.<br />
<br />
&quot;You think so?&quot; Lancer growled, though the smile planted on his face betrayed his anger. He easily lifted Troy up, who gripped onto his shoulders at the sudden change in elevation. Then plopped down onto the bed. It took a second before Troy was able to properly register where he was. The quick and sudden change threw him for a loop, but he quickly found himself resting on Lancer&#39;s big meaty chest. He soon found him body relaxing, splaying out against the much bigger man. Followed quickly by petting his golden fur. <br />
<br />
A weird pit formed in Troy&#39;s stomach as he laid there. He suddenly felt nervous. &quot;Do you actually want to play that stupid game that my coworker wants to play?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm?&quot; Lancer purred. Troy refused to look him in the eyes, so he used his big, clawed hand and placed it on top of his head, then forced him to. &quot;If it means spending more time with you,&quot; he smiled, &quot;I would love to.&quot;<br />
<br />
Troy felt his face turn red so he buried it deep into the other man&#39;s pecs. It was a few seconds before he worked up the nerve to show it again. &quot;Okay! Then I&#39;ll find out when the game is and then summon you again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds like a plan,&quot; Lancer said.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t long before Troy&#39;s body relaxed and drifted off to sleep. Excitement seemed to rush through him as he dreamed about spending more time with Lancer. It didn&#39;t matter if they were both learning a new game, he was going to make sure that he enjoyed it.</p>
