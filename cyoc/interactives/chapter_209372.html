<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ellie pulled her phone out, texting James for the fifth time,<br />
<br />
‘Make a wish already!’<br />
<br />
She was seated at the dinner table with her mother, her father, and as she dreaded… her sister, Freya.<br />
Of course, Freya was talking about herself tonight. Non-stop. As usual.<br />
Ellie sat with a grumpy look on her face. Her sister, seated completely opposite to her, wasn’t paying her any attention.<br />
‘I’ve got a new boyfriend! I think I’m in love! I have a new job! I just got promoted!’<br />
All Freya ever talked about was herself.<br />
<br />
Ellie’s father looked over to her, “c’mon sweetheart, you haven’t even touched your dinner,”<br />
“She’s probably just not hungry!” Freya chimed in, getting her fathers attention, “but like I was saying, my boyfriend’s mom is totally rich and she bought me a brand new handbag for our dinner next week! She always calls me so gorgeous, it’s so kind!”<br />
“She sounds wonderful,” her mother replied, “and your boyfriend, as far as you’ve described him, sounds like a real dreamboat,”<br />
Blah blah blah… Ellie didn’t care at all.<br />
<br />
“I wish her boyfriend wasn’t as sexy as she’s talking about… I wish she didn’t have everything she could ever want!” Ellie whispered to herself, “maybe then she’d learn her lesson… c’mon James I wanna mess up her ‘perfect’ life as much as I can!” She said, her father looked over at her, muttering,<br />
“Seriously sweetheart,” her father said, he leant closer so Freya couldn’t hear, “I know you aren’t a big fan of your sister, but she’s only here once a month. She’s living the life she’s always dreamed! You’ll do exactly the same one day,” he finished, “now please, try and eat some of your dinner…” he said, averting his attention back to Freya,<br />
“Alright,” Ellie whispered to herself, “I wish Freya wasn’t perfect,” she said to herself. No one even batted an eye.<br />
<br />
‘Done’<br />
<br />
Ellie looked at her phone… James made a wish already. Wait…<br />
<br />
—<br />
<br />
Ellie looked up at Freya, knowing exactly what was going to happen. She didn’t know what, but that wish was about to do something to Freya.<br />
Without needing to pay a lot of attention, she immediately noticed something about Freya’s face. Her nose, it was growing!<br />
Her perfect button nose, the one she always talked about and how ‘perfect’ it is- or was! It was getting larger, thicker, looking more and more odd on her face. This is what Ellie wanted! And she wanted more!<br />
But that was it…<br />
Her nose stopped growing, and Freya was still blabbering on about her life,<br />
“And despite everything he still treats me like I’m the most beautiful woman in the world!” She said, placing her hand on her heart as she closed her eyes believing her life to be amazing. Maybe even better than before.<br />
It humbled her… and yet she still made Ellie look worthless!<br />
<br />
“Something else…” she whispered, “something she can’t just ignore and overcome…”<br />
She quickly texted James, ‘another wish, quick!’<br />
Almost immediately James replied, ‘hold on’<br />
<br />
Ellie waited, staring at her sister with malice in her glare.<br />
‘Okay, done’ <br />
Ellie smiled, “I wish Freya had a pair of big buckteeth!” She said to herself, quietly.<br />
<br />
As Freya talked, she watched as her two front teeth began to suddenly grow. Not only did they grow longer, but bigger. They widened, making them more and more noticeable as she spoke. She was starting to look like a bunny. Like a donkey. Like an ass!<br />
<br />
But it didn’t stop her.<br />
“He always tells me he loves me because of the person I am, not what’s on the outside!”<br />
This bitch…<br />
“And furthermore, he says that my imperfections are what makes me perfect…”<br />
<br />
“We’ll see about that,” Ellie said, knowing she was about to unleash one final reckoning upon her ‘little-miss-perfect’ older sister,<br />
She texted James, ‘One more’<br />
‘Are you seriously using three wishes on your sister?’<br />
‘Of course! You know how much she deserves it’<br />
‘Maybe’ he started, ‘but i don’t want to give you too much satisfaction in revenge’<br />
‘You made my mum into a bombshell because you’re a creep. The least you can do is give me one more wish’<br />
‘Fair point.’ He said, ‘but remember your actions have consequences!’ He finished, putting a little ghost emoji after his final message.<br />
<br />
Ellie looked at Freya. She had at least one more wish to use against her wretched sister. She was going to make it worth it,<br />
“I wish everything Freya considers beautiful about herself becomes ugly!” She finished.<br />
<br />
—<br />
<br />
As she stared back at Freya, she immediately noticed changes beginning.<br />
<br />
Freya’s perfect blonde straight hair suddenly turned brown, her natural colour. Then, each strand of her hair sprung up, leaving a weird greasy curly strand in it’s place. Her hairline shifted, leaving her decent forehead completely exposed, shining for the world to see. Her nose remained the same, as did her teeth. Her ears didn’t change as she didn’t consider them necessarily beautiful, but her lips got fatter, puffier and swollen, not in a sexy way like her mother, like they were swollen from a reaction of some kind.<br />
Her cheeks suddenly swelled as her jawline protruded. Her chin jutted out forwards as fat suddenly started piling from beneath. Her eyes sunk and shrunk into her skull, making her have a constant squint to them. Her eyelashes disappeared and her eyebrows grew bushier.<br />
Oddly enough, her breasts didn’t change. Ellie had always been jealous of her sisters fair sized breasts, but clearly she wasn’t so proud of them. Her arms on the other hand bloated like two balloons as they swelled with fat, covering themselves in a fair layer of hair. Her belly, usually very tight and exposed through her choice of clothing ballooned outwards. Ellie felt it hit the table on her own side it got so large. She could see through the glass table as Freya’s thighs bloated to look like tree-trunks, once again covered in a fair layer of hair. Her feet grew at least twice as large. She wasn’t wearing any shoes or socks, but if she had they would’ve certainly broken.<br />
<br />
Ellie remained staring at her total mess of a sister. The once very good looking and attractive older sister was now an ugly 20-something year old disaster, wearing clothes she clearly wasn’t suited to wear and… living a life she was in no way suited to live!?<br />
<br />
“He says that he can look past everything, and of course we know there’s a lot to look past,” Freya said, making both her parents chuckle, “but at the end of the day, he loves me. And I love him,”<br />
Her mother looked as if she was going to cry. Her father was smiling with genuine happiness for his eldest daughter.<br />
Ellie looked on in absolute disbelief. After everything she’d done to her sister… she was still happy?<br />
<br />
Ellie looked completely dazzled like a deer in headlights. Her mother and father both noticed. They looked at each other, her mother sighed,<br />
“You need to eat otherwise you’ll feel a lot worse, honey,” her mother said,<br />
“She’s right. We’ll talk about this later, okay,” her father said.<br />
Ellie looked down at her food, still flabbergasted… but the food did look very delicious. She incredibly hungry, and maybe it was a good distraction from the disaster of a plan that just unfolded.<br />
<br />
—<br />
<br />
A few hours had passed. Ellie ate all of her dinner, as well as the leftovers her mother and father left. With the willpower she still had, she chose not to each the leftovers of her sisters plate. She didn’t even want to look at her.<br />
<br />
As she raided the fridge of snacks, Ellie began to walk back to her room. Defeated. That was when she was stopped by…<br />
<br />
“Hey.” Freya said, grabbing Ellie by her arm. Ellie froze, almost dropping her midnight meal,<br />
“U-uhm…” she stuttered, not even turning around, “y-yeah..?”<br />
“I wanted to… uh… talk to you,” Freya said, looking down at the ground. Ellie turned herself around to look at Freya, not quite making eye contact with her,<br />
“Sure… I guess,” Ellie said, placing her snacks on the counter next to her.<br />
“I just… you know we’ve never been close, and… and don’t tell mom and dad, but I’m not gonna be here next month. I know you’re going off to college and stuff and you try to avoid me whenever I’m home… so I know I might not see you again for a long time,” she started, Ellie looked on at her with genuine surprise, “b-but I wanted to just tell you I’m sorry for all the times I’ve been bitchy… and I know I ignore you a lot and talk about myself all the time, but I really think you’re a good sister,”<br />
“W-wha… really?” Ellie asked, not sure how to respond,<br />
“I mean… when you look like this,” she said, gesturing to herself, “it’s hard to not be a little jealous when your little sister is as gorgeous as you,” she admitted, making Ellie openly blush, her mouth open, “and I think we can both agree it’s a little hard to compete with mom,” she joked, scratching the back of her neck as she did. Ellie let out an awkward chuckle,<br />
“Y-yeah… she’s a little unrealistic if I’m honest,” Ellie replied, looking up at her sister, finally making eye contact for the first time in a long time,<br />
“Totally,” Freya said. She then broke eye contact, “I’m sorry for all those years I treated you like… like shit!” She said, looking genuinely upset, “but most of all, I’m sorry I didn’t get to be your sister,” she said, pulling her eyes back up to look at Ellie, “and I really mean that,”<br />
<br />
Ellie looked as if she was about to cry. And eventually, after staring into her true sisters eyes for the first time, she did. She wrapped her arms around her sister, squeezing her tightly as she sobbed. Freya started crying as well, hugging her sister back.<br />
The two just hugged. They didn’t know what else to say to one-another, but as their hug ended, and Ellie looked into her the eyes of her real sister… she could only see the pain she’d caused her.<br />
She knew what she did, and she didn’t regret it. But she’d left a permanent scar on Freya, taken away so much that her life would naturally switch directions…<br />
She looked deep into Freya’s eyes and said, “I wish you were the version of you everyone used to see, but the version of you now inside,”<br />
<br />
Ellie grabbed her sister once again, wrapping her arms around her one last time. She felt as Freya’s body changed, regressing back to it’s original state. After a few more moments, she let go of her sister,<br />
“W-well I should get back to my room,” Freya said, “gotta leave pretty early tomorrow,”<br />
“Yeah… I still got school,” Ellie admitted, chuckling to herself. She looked at her sister. She was the same sister she used to know… but she was definitely different. She was wearing glasses instead of contact lenses. She was wearing a shirt with the band ‘Rose-Well-Earned’ written on it with a pair of jeans finishing off the look, as opposed to her typical cropped blouse and skirt. She had her naturally brown hair tied up in a ponytail as opposed to her dyed blonde she used to have.<br />
She smiled at her sister, “are you still friends with James?”<br />
“O-of course,” she said,<br />
“Not dating or anything?” She teased, knowing Ellie hated people suggesting the two should get together,<br />
“Still no!” She said frustratedly, but with a smile on her face, turning to a laugh. She was laughing with her sister…<br />
<br />
—<br />
<br />
“Goodnight, Ellie,” Freya said, waving her sister goodbye as she entered her room,<br />
“Night,” Ellie replied, smiling to herself as she walked into her own room, closing the door and just sliding down it to sit herself on her floor.<br />
She was still in shock as to what had just happened… she didn’t think these wishes could change the course of her life so dramatically. She’d finally learned to love and respect her sister through humbling her; her and James now had no destiny as a future relationship… the wishes really were altering her and James’ life significantly!<br />
As she sat on her floor, thinking whilst devouring her snacks, she wondered what James could’ve been doing all night.<br />
<br />
She shrugged, knowing he’d probably done the usual and was playing video games.<br />
As the hour passed, she realised it was close to midnight. She had to get up the next morning.<br />
She finished her snacks, drank her pop. Then brushed her teeth, put in her pyjamas and jumped into bed. She smiled as she began to fall asleep… what an odd day.<br />
<br />
— — —<br />
<br />
James was in the process of trying on a number of tight articles of clothing that truly accentuated his rear, all of which he had wished for.<br />
As much as his bubble butt got in the way, he stayed true to his word and hadn’t wished it away. But while he had it, he might as well see how it looked in the right kind of clothing. He was cringing, but secretly he was loving it!</p>
