<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWWWW HEEEEEEEEEEEE HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWWWW HHHHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE HHHHHHHHHHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUUUUUUUWWWWWWWWWWWWW” brayed Anthony, a mental of explosion of blinking lights and ecstasy erupting in his poor human mind as he felt Darren’s tight grip fire up every single burning new nerve on his mammoth donkey cock. The pleasure was so intense and overwhelming that it was truly painful. His lurking donkey-mindset, however, seemed anything but displeased about it. <br />
<br />
With a firm hold, Darren pulled back on his friend’s donkey dick, furthering the intensity of sensations Anthony was experiencing and causing his mushroom-tipped head to fully expand and engorge, loads of pre-cum oozing out of his piss slit. “HAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWW HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWWWW HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW HHHHHHHHHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWW HEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!” Anthony couldn’t stop himself from braying madly, wildly. All he could see were stars as every touch, stroke, and heartbeat coursing his veiny black penis was driving him insane with lust. The same images of jennies flashing before him that he thought were abominable and gross became visions of pure desire to quell an aching need which rested heavily in his tight and shiny scrotum. As Darren began to stroke his equine length harder, Anthony began unconsciously thrusting slightly to meet his hand movements, flexing his pelvis muscles to make his gigantic meat thwap into his fat furry belly. For a brief instant, Anthony thought back on how he was used to masturbating; in the privacy of his air-conditioned room, with some body lotion and an HD computer streaming hot chicks touching themselves or getting pounded. Now, he was a dirty animal naked in a field, with flies buzzing all around his putrid aroma and his friend firmly wanking his 20-inch shaft, which Anthony was bouncing and bouncing and thumping against his barreled underbelly, smearing and staining it with his viscous seminal fluids. He wished he was dead.  <br />
<br />
Darren, meanwhile, kept pumping the donkey’s mighty shaft. To him, that’s all Anthony was from now on, a fate which Darren reckoned he probably deserved. He didn’t see the beast he was groping as anything other than a common farm animal at this point. He looked like a donkey, brayed like a donkey, and undoubtedly stank like one, as evidenced by the permeating bestial musk practically dripping from his sweaty balls as they churned with the anticipation of release. He could feel every pulse in the donkey’s cock as he clutched it tight, stroking it back and forth to a symphony of belligerent brays. Anthony was his animal – his property. His only value to Darren and his family was the hot spunk in his swollen gonads. He needed to get the rest of whatever human remained of Anthony out of HIS donkey, and he knew that meant making that dome-shaped forehead encasing his human brain crunch down and donkify whatever vestiges of Anthony remained until he was just the stupid jackass he always was when he was human. <br />
<br />
*CRACK* *SNAP*<br />
<br />
Darren looked up to see what caused such a sickening sound. Looking at his donkey’s head, he saw that the beast’s muzzle had extended further, almost fully lengthened to where it was supposed to be. The dumb animal brayed in agony; there was no way such a monumental shift in bone structure would feel anywhere near pleasant. That was the moment Darren validated his hypothesis. Looking down on the horny animal, Darren understood that his donkey would need to CUM Anthony’s brains out. Sure, maybe he could give his mighty shaft a few more good tugs, but Darren didn’t see any reason to waste a good orgasm from a stud donkey like Anthony. Kneeling back down on his knees, Darren held one of the donkey’s ginormous testes in his hands, feeling its radiant warmth and hefty weight. He marveled at how thick and heavy they were. Anthony was always a well-hung guy, and it seemed that attribute carried over in his transformation – his cock and balls were exceptionally large, even by donkey standards. Whichever jenny he gave to him first was sure to get WRECKED. <br />
<br />
Anthony had the same revelation regarding his fate when his muzzle snapped out – if only he could cum, he thought, then this would all be over, and he could fade from life and existence and end the cycle of pure degradation and embarrassment. Collecting his senses, Anthony brayed frantically, begging that Darren would grasp his still-hard donkey boner and finish the job, to just finish him and get it over with. Darren, however, had other plans. Grabbing the rope, he tugged his stupid jackass to the stable they were approaching, the smells of other equines and their shit sending a mix of signals into Anthony’s subconscious. As they walked, his unattended erection began flopping and smacking his thighs and lower body uncontrollably. An inescapable sense of dread overtaking him as he began to fear for the worse of fates – spending his last moments of self-awareness by plunging his monstrous fuckstick into a tight, hot donkey vagina. <br />
 <br />
Finally, they reached the stables, which were musty and dimly lit – but safe and warm from the elements outside. Darren tugged Anthony down the aisle, and walked him into a secluded, empty stall. Anthony brayed for mercy the entire way, incessantly vocalizing his fears and worries in the only way his body would let him, all the while feeling the sick sensation of his floppy donkey dick softening and retracting into his leathery sheath. Darren, doing his best to not alert anyone in the nearby farmhouse, had reached the limits of his patience. “ANTHONY!” Darren yelled, staring at the jackass eye-to-eye. Anthony immediately ceased his noise-making, hoping Darren would offer him some solace or help – anything. Darren smiled – he knew a part of Anthony was still somewhere in there, and that was the problem he was going to fix.<br />
<br />
“Anthony, listen to me,” Darren said, looking as if he were trying to calm the donkey. “I know we used to hang-out and play football together, and those were good times, but right now, you’re a fucking donkey, and I don’t think anything’s going to change that. I mean, you literally showed up here and walked around on all four hooves while eating my grass and pooping everywhere. You don’t even have a man’s dick anymore – you just have a smelly-as-hell donkey sheath with a horse cock squiriming in it. Face it, man, you’re life’s over. Now, we’ll take good care of you here, but that means I’m going to need you to do what donkey’s do. I’m going to need you to FUCK donkeys, Anthony. You are going to FUCK A DONKEY! HAHAHAHA” Anthony brayed in fury as Darren mocked him, laughing at his horrible fate, but he also felt a small rush of energy in his groin again, much to his dismay. <br />
<br />
“Y’know, it’s still so weird for me to think, that, after seeing you naked when we were in the locker-room, that I’d get to see your cock turn into an animal sheath and that you’d become my personal property. You even let me fondle your junk and borderline jack you off! And you didn’t do anything about it because you’re so stupid, just like the stupid-looking animal you are now. I mean, I’m totally straight for sexy, fine women, but I have to admit, it’s hot as hell knowing that I’m going to force you to fuck your humanity away inside a fucking barnyard ANIMAL! You STUPID JACKASS!”<br />
<br />
“HHHHHHHHAAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWW HHHEEEEEEEEEE HAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWW” Anthony protested, his cock hanging out half-hard at the notion. Darren just continued laughing, right in his face, and his body was powerless to do anything about it. Darren’s laughter and Anthony’s brays were suddenly interrupted, however, by a familiar tune. Anthony’s ears perked up – it was his text-message ringtone!<br />
<br />
Darren grabbed Anthony’s phone out his pocket. He had swiped it from his car earlier in the day. “Oh, well look-y here” Darren said, an evil smirk forming on his face. He turned the phone screen so Anthony could read it with his widened, frightened eyes:<br />
<br />
MOM:<br />
hi sweety, its gettn late just wanted to make sure u r safe. Luv u!<br />
<br />
Anthony’s massive donkey heart sank. Mom. His mother. What would she do if she knew what had become of him? Anthony hung his head low in shame. Darren, however, seemed thrilled. Unlocking Anthony’s phone screen, Darren immediately replied to Anthony’s mom’s text, acting as if he were Anthony himself.<br />
<br />
ANTHONY:<br />
LOL STFU i fuk donkeys now. ive become a jackass stud. Im never coming back. I just want 2 mate wit animals from now on. No more football/future/family 4 me – just green fields and donkey n horse puss. Goodbye. Here’s the last image ull ever get of me:<br />
<br />
And with that, Darren went to Anthony’s rear and lifted his tail out of the way, taking a nice photo of his shit-encrusted asshole and furry donkey rump, making sure to also capture his half-hard dick dangling between his hindlegs, before sending his mother a final image of her only son to remember him by. Her pride and joy was now just a stupid donkey who belonged to Darren. Of course, Anthony’s mother immediately called and caused his phone to ring, but Darren just laughed and tossed it aside into a nearby water bucket, destroying the phone. Anthony cried in defeat, but, of course, all he actually did was release a whimpering series of brays. <br />
<br />
“SHUT UP!” Darren yelled. “Here, wait here, and I’ll go get something to cheer you up, JACKASS.” And with that, he left Anthony confined to his own devices in his new home, a grungy, wooden box stall meant for beasts like him. It was probably a little smaller than his human bedroom, except now he was a much bigger animal. Anthony looked around at the constricting prison-like walls. This was to be his dining room, his bedroom, and his bathroom, yet it didn’t have a table, a bed, nor a toilet. He was expected to eat in the same spot he slept on and the same floor he’d carpet with feces and urine. He imagined himself dying in here someday, all alone, reeking of his own waste, and nobody would even care, they’d just be annoyed with having to deal with disposing of his filthy animal carcass. For the first time in his life, Anthony made a mental and sincere prayer to God or whoever was out there, begging for mercy, or a second chance, or a change in fate. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately for Anthony, jackasses didn’t have souls worth saving. <br />
<br />
It was then that Anthony could hear Darren’s approaching footsteps, along with the clip-clop of what was Anthony’s greatest fear – a jenny. He knew it was a jenny because his budding donkey thoughts were dinking in the putrid smell of her heat, and his rubbery half-hard cock began to pump itself full of blood to its full mast. Once more, Anthony felt the painful need to cum, his shaft thickening and hardening, stretching the skin of his sheath to its limits, his glans flaring magnificently as his entire rod raised and smacked his furry chest.<br />
<br />
The donkey within him began stomping his hooves, his tail whipping furiously from side-to-side while he aching, churning balls began to build in pressure, the skin of his black scrotum completely taught against his voluminous testicles, each begging to release their mighty load of fresh donkey sperm. He was so excited, his asshole even burst out a gaseous wet fart. “HHHHHHHHAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWWWW” Anthony brayed, and then the door to his stall opened.</p>
