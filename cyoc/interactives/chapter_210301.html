<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Oliver scanned the shelves of the secondhand store. There was almost no one in here today. A slow day was perfect, he thought. He could try things on in the changing room with the ability to turn into the former owners! <br />
<br />
The limit was 4 items at the same time, so he found some clothes around his size or slightly bigger and tried them on. <br />
<br />
The ring glinted. He could tell, somehow, that it was pleased that he was using it. Somehow, he felt the ring wanted to be used. <br />
<br />
The Halo T-shirt turned him into a rather ugly, dumpy man in his mid 30s. Pass, he thought. He put it aside for the return pile. Next up was a pair of pants only slightly bigger than his size, at 34x32, which was a two inch difference to his height. He morphed from the dumpy gamer to a Mestizo looking man with closely shaved stubble. He looked with shock. He was Hispanic now. Nothing special. He was in his 20s now. He definitely had more Native blood than European. Deep copper skin and deep onyx eyes. He looked like he could have been working in a field picking strawberries, he thought. He took them off and put them in the reject pile as well. Most of these guys were sporting dicks even smaller than his own. Some of them clocked in at only 3 inches tops! <br />
<br />
Next up were a pair of sweatpants. Probably gonna be fat, he thought. <br />
<br />
He was surprised to find that he was now in the body of a much bulkier man. Probably nearing 50 but definitely handsome for all his wear and tear. A total DILF! He had so many lines in his face now! He touched them, felt the new way his face wrinkled around the jaw of a man who might have been a former athlete. He had a gut, true, but he also had strong muscles that had gone only a little to fat. Fighting the battle of the bulge. Hair had been thinning for maybe a few years earlier. Probably some hardworking office dad, he thought. Handsome face, though. And the arms aren&#39;t too bad, either. He marveled at having prolific arm hair for the first time. He toyed with it. He checked out this DILF&#39;s dick. 7 1/2 inches. Not too shabby! This one was definitely a keeper! <br />
<br />
&quot;Testing. One two three. Wow. Wow. This voice is super sexy!&quot; Oliver said, impressed. Not only was he a DILF, he was a DILF with a voice that sounded more like Will Arnett than his crappy teenage voice that had dropped only a little bit after he reached puberty. &quot;Always wanted a sexy dad voice,&quot; he said, playfully, checking himself out and flexing his dad bod, slapping his gut a few times. <br />
<br />
He placed the unwanted items to the returns pile and decided to keep the jogging pants. <br />
<br />
For his next few turns, he didn&#39;t find much. Most of the men were fat or just plain old. Lots of fat grandpas. None of the Hawaiian shirts revealed anyone good looking so he just abandoned the idea altogether. Most of the Asian men didn&#39;t appeal to him. None of them worked out very much either. Just thin or bland looks. <br />
<br />
Finally, he picked out a pair of very large cargo pants sized 45&quot;x40&quot; inches, a pair of size 15 cowboy boots, and a pair of surf shorts. <br />
<br />
He tried the jeans on first. The idea of having a larger waist probably meant being fat, but the combination of fat and tall made him so curious he could barely stand it. The ring on his finger glinted as Oliver fit the far-too-large jeans over his legs. They were ten inches longer than the size he normally wore. <br />
<br />
Oliver looked at his reflection. He was a high school senior but looked like a boring, homely nerd. Glasses. Beanpole arms with barely any definition. He had a good core and his ab muscles had some definition but the rest of his body was pretty lame. A lower than average frame, he thought. Cursed to be an ectomorph. <br />
<br />
His legs grew almost instantaneously. <br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; he said in another man&#39;s voice. He looked up to see the cargo pants fit him perfectly now. He was in his 40s, he guessed. Completely bald with an enormous, bulging muscles with more than a bit of fat attached. His face was so rugged, but the dick that came with this body was easily 11&quot; long. His face became a giant &quot;O&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit,&quot; the man whispered in a low, gravelly voice. Lucky there was no one around to hear him! <br />
<br />
He flexed his giant arms. He must be, what, at least 6&#39;5&quot; now. His arms were easily 20 inches in diameter. The bulges they made were incredible. His neck was so thick! He could easily intimidate any other man walking around like this, he thought. Maybe get a job as a bouncer! He could see himself shoving guys out of a bar who had one too many a drink that night. <br />
<br />
He decided that he liked the look of the muscular dad with a few pounds on him but this body was that and then some. A wrestler body. His face was a paragon of manliness, strong and firm with thick stubble. He licked it with his tongue. He could barely grow facial hair at the age of 17 and now he was practically a beast! If he had to wager a guess, he might say German or Eastern European. A white gorilla of a man born to be in charge. The chest hair alone was a virtual forest! He&#39;d need a weed whacker to take care of all that graying dull brown fur! Tattoos covered his left arm, enhancing his sex appeal quite considerably. <br />
<br />
None of the other dicks came even close to the one he had now. He took off the pants and saw his naked body now in all its hot glory. He looked like he could fuck younger twinks in a gay porn, he thought. <br />
<br />
Hmmm. This body was definitely gay! <br />
<br />
&quot;Amazing!&quot; he said, looking at all the hair on his hands. <br />
<br />
Right. The pants were a keeper. He put on the boots next. It was a little tough because even though he was taller, his feet were now slightly thicker and wider than the cowboy boot, in spite of having the toe room. Finally, the ring relented and his foot grew longer and narrower. Morphing in front of him was one of the most drop dead gorgeous men imaginable. <br />
<br />
He had been hoping to find a younger man who was also large and alpha looking but nothing topped this. <br />
<br />
Perfect teeth. Perfect eyes. A face that could star in movies. Chestnut brown hair. It was the perfect length, not too long or short, just perfect and wavy in the way it bounced around. His looked chiseled, his jaw was strong but made his face slightly long. Muscles were taut and gorgeous. He sported a delirious smile. He had never in his life thought he could look like such a JOCK! Handsome and with taut muscles. He was now probably around 6&#39;2&quot;, taller than most men but not too much taller. This guy was just handsome as hell. He had some crags to his face but not many. His eye sparkled a beer bottle green like a Rocky Mountain river in a canyon somewhere.<br />
<br />
Imagine the number of ladies that I could get with this body! He chewed his lip. He was so excited! Imagine the looks on people&#39;s faces as he walked through a club dressed like this! But then, he didn&#39;t have ID for this body, he thought. Meh. Don&#39;t worry about it, he thought. I&#39;ll deal with that later. <br />
<br />
Finally, he tried the surf shorts. <br />
<br />
The first thing this muscular body said was &quot;Don&#39;t fuck with me&quot; but the tattoos really completed that look. He was aghast. Standing before him was the most muscular specimen yet. He sported some of the most amazingly shiny black hair. A small mustache grazed his lips. Was he part Hispanic? No, he thought. He suddenly realized that his tan skin revealed European Spanish and Anglo blood. With his gorgeous hair slicked back, he took stock of his muscles. What was he, 5&#39;11&quot;? And if he had to wager a guess, he&#39;d say at least 230 pounds. Well into studhood territory. This body was more of the perfect mesomorph. Hardly any fat. Tanned. A drop dead gorgeous smile. Dick was a slightly above average 6.5 inches.  <br />
<br />
He thought of all the studs he could find to watch at the beach. Even though he wasn&#39;t gay, he was gay when he looked like this. He could feel his dick getting so hard to the thought of all that beach muscle, all those guys with their pecs bouncing and glistening in the sun, their perky asses bouncing as they ran on the surf. <br />
<br />
He was greedy, he realized. He quickly changed back into his clothes and found himself disappointed. Here was the same drab Oliver as before. No one noticed him. No one cared.<br />
<br />
He could become a straight older office DILF, an older bald gay gorilla of a musclebear, a 20something handsome straight cowboy and a nearly 30 gay muscle hunk with a physique to die for.<br />
<br />
He bought these items from a thankfully uninterested woman behind the counter who asked him for about 20 dollars in a thick Hispanic accent. Polite and no chit chat. Perfect. He was hoping to avoid explanation as to why he was buying clothes for a much bigger man! <br />
<br />
Finally, he was home. He was so excited. He could now walk around as any of these men! <br />
<br />
The first one he would try out would be...</p>
