<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;ok, let&#39;s get you to your new home, there is some other legal mumbojumbo we need to sort out and it will be easier to do it at your new house&quot; you (Andy) beamed at the news that you had your own house and said &quot; wait what!, i got a house already?&quot; well yes you have a 2 story 4 bedroom, 2 bathroom house with a big garden and even a pool in the back&quot; you could not believe it, it sounded too good to be true. <br />
<br />
  <br />
<br />
you both got in your agents&#39; car and he drove for 10 minuets an till you were in a very nice neighbourhood and drove in to a nice big house with a garage on the side you knew this was your new house and got out as fast as you could when you got out you saw a perfect house but when you look at the garage you see two kid size BMX&#39;s what was odd, but you were to thrilled with your new big body new life and house! <br />
<br />
  <br />
<br />
So you shrug it off and follow your agent inside your new house, once inside you look around expecting it to be empty or newly furnished but, it wasn&#39;t, there was lots of shoes piled at the door ranging from big shoes what would fit my new body to kid’s trainers and you even saw shoes what looked like they were for a woman, but you shrugged it off and following your agent hopping he will explain. <br />
<br />
You followed him, and you passed hanging&#39;s what had child/tween Parker&#39;s coats on and one what looked like it belonged to my new body and once again a pinkish one what would fit a slender woman, you kept on going an till you see a picture what makes you stop in you tracks you pick it up and look at it closer. <br />
<br />
It was a pitcher of the new adult me but I had a woman what looked to be my new age Maybe a little younger with long blond hear very slim and had big tits and a big ass, her arm was around me with her hand going into my back pocket, but there were two kids standing right in fount of us with their arms around each other&#39;s shoulder, the boy on the right looked to be about 7/8 with curly dark blonde hair going down below his Sholders, an athletic body and a big smile on his face, the boy on the lift of him looked quite similar but was nearly a head taller than the other boy looking to be about 11/12 years old and had straight dark blond hear what only just reached his shoulders, he also had an athletic body but you could see more muscles than the other boy. <br />
<br />
You holded up the picture and asked “what is this!” he looks back at me and said in a quiet voce “well that is your new life”, you look at him in shock and shout “WHAT?” he looked gloomily at me again and said “yes, we don’t tell people how swapping normally have to take on Somone else&#39;s life, but I thought that coming from a family what where abusive and stole all your hard earned money, we thought this life will be good for you, and well there is no going back, and well I might as well tell you should get use to the name Charly, and being called dad.” <br />
<br />
He came up to me putting a hand around my shoulder saying ”trust me you will love your new life as a dad” he pointed at the woman in the photo and said” that is Susan your wife, she is a lovely woman and is very positive” then he pointed to the two boys saying” the younger one in Tyler and the older one is Sam, they are lovely kids with both of them being straight A students and Tyler being top in his group in Jamnastics and Sam the captain of the local football team, trust me you will love them”. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
You looked at the pitcher of you new family not expecting gaining a new family, one where you are the dad, all you wanted was to get away from your mom and dad, but looking at your new wife and kids you felt a sort of wanting for them in some odd way and said “well I will give this family thing a try” your agent smiled at you and said “good, I know you will grow to lovie them as much as the old Charly did, and talking about the old Charly” Mr agent turned his head up the stairs and shouted “Andy come down now” you were confused why did he just shout your old name up the stairs. <br />
<br />
but you herd movement, something small moving, in less than a minute you see a boy running down the stairs and you recognized him straight away, it was your old body looking very giddy and came running straight at me saying in my old child&#39;s voice “so has he decided to be my dad” you were in shock your old self what you were less than 2h ago was hopping up and down right in front of me, wearing my old soccer shorts and my green tank top, the agent said “ not yet, I&#39;m about to explain it to him now” the new Andy looked disappointed, but kept on staring at us, the agent started to explain “as you have probably have guessed that this is the previous Charlie inside your old body, and well the court hearing has declared your old parents are unfit to raise any children so we normally give the previous owner of the body a choice who is you, you can adopted him with you being old enough to do so and try and give him the best life you can, or we will have to put him in foster care” you looked at you agent and then down at the new Andy who suddenly ran up to you rapping his small arms around you giving you a hug while saying “please be my dad! I will be the best son ever! Your agent said I can continue your acting career and I can bring lots of money into the household and I would be the best big brother to my new brothers and I will do all the chores you want me to do! Please be my new Dad, Please Please Please!!,  <br />
<br />
I looked down at him feeling his arms trying to give me a hug, not being able to reach all the away round my big body and I decided...</p>
