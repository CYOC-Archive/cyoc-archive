<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The doors closed behind us. Initially, we were in complete darkness, until a large strip of fluorescent light illuminated the corridor we were standing in. The dull, grey walls were littered with warning signs and clumsy pipe work. Two more doors stood at the end of the hallway, with the sign “Research Station: Omega” dangling from the ceiling. Andy and I briefly exchanged looks, before glancing at our raging hardons. Andy’s musk was so enticing, and the trail of sweat down his neck was just begging to be licked. However, we both pushed our primal urges to the back of our minds as we cautiously walked down the corridor.<br />
<br />
The doors opened up to a large circular room. I was shocked at its size. It was huge! Multiple rows of desks surrounded an odd-looking machine, which stood in the centre. A large sheet of frosted glass on the machine glowed purple. A man in a white labcoat was diligently working on it. He had jet black hair, and a thin layer of stubble. He looked more like a soldier than a scientist. I knew he looked odd when he entered the lab with the other researchers yesterday. The room was eerily quiet, with the exception of a few low moans coming from the centre. My eyes widened when I saw Doug lying down on some sort of stretcher. A thick, glass tube was affixed to his crotch, which lead directly into the machine. Doug didn’t seem to be in any pain. Quite the opposite really. As his naked frame writhed about, I watched as his rock-hard cock shot a massive load into the pipe, which then traveled into the machine. I don’t think I had ever been more confused in my life. However, any questions that popped into my head almost immediately left it when I saw Alex emerge from behind the machine. He was still completely naked. I suppose after today any sense of humility was thrown out of the window. His body hadn’t changed. I felt my cock throb as my eyes wandered down his frame. He looked like he was actually helping the scientist, which was odd. Still, Andy and I ran towards them. It was a relief to see they were alright. Once Alex saw us approach his mouth stretched into one of his big, dumb grins.<br />
<br />
“How the hell did you guys get in here!?”<br />
“Never mind that! Are you okay?”<br />
“We’re fine. Doug’s doing great, as you can see.”<br />
“Who’s he?”<br />
“This is Dr-“<br />
“Nick! I can’t believe it!”<br />
“Andy?!”<br />
<br />
The scientist looked up in awe at the recently-grown soldier..<br />
<br />
“You look so different…”<br />
“I missed you.”<br />
<br />
As they embraced, we watched on, confused. Alex laughed nervously.<br />
<br />
“You two know each other?”<br />
“I’m sorry. I haven’t been totally honest with you.”<br />
“Andy and I have been trying to infiltrate this facility for months.”<br />
“You see, we’re part of this group-“<br />
“A group?”<br />
“It’s more like an organisation.”<br />
“And what does this ‘organisation’ do?”<br />
“Our main goal is to track down and collect any reports of genetic mutation. We exist solely to prevent any global outbreaks of serums like these.”<br />
“You probably know about the outbreak at Barleyford. We were the ones who stopped it.”<br />
“Once we heard that a remote lab in the Scottish highlands actually found a way to quantify that mutation into a serum, we had to see if those rumours were true.”<br />
“They were way closer than we thought, and they want to use it as a weapon. As a way to create an army. We can’t let them.”<br />
“Their masterpiece is just behind that sheet of glass. Thanks to your squadmate, it’s almost ready.”<br />
“What do you need Doug for?”<br />
“This machine takes his sperm and compresses it down to a seemingly infinite level. The result is this purple liquid. At least, that’s what their research notes suggest. Are you OK?”<br />
<br />
I sat down on the floor. It was just too much to take in. A secret corporation infiltrating a secret lab? A machine that converts cum into that purple stuff? My mind almost collapsed from the sheer ridiculousness of it all. But as I saw Doug, 8ft tall and hung like a horse, shoot another load, I realised that it really wasn’t the craziest thing to happen today. Still, my mind raced with all sorts of questions. I don’t know how long I was in my head for, but it was long enough for Alex to sit beside me, gently placing his hand on my shoulder. He wasn’t even trying to hide his semi-erect cock..<br />
<br />
“I know, it’s a lot to process. But I feel like we should help them.”<br />
“Why?”<br />
“I dunno. Just seems like the right thing to do. And besides, you’re too deep now. It’s either this or the Lieutenant water boarding you.”<br />
“I guess you’re right.”<br />
“I usually am.”<br />
<br />
He winked, his grin simply refusing to subside. Suddenly, I heard Andy gasp in delight as the machine began to whir. Nick’s eyes widened.<br />
<br />
“It’s ready! Careful now…” <br />
<br />
He slowly slid open the sheet of frosted glass, and carefully reached in. He pulled out a large gun, made mostly of small glass tubes and pieces of metal. It glowed bright purple, as the serum danced along the tubes.<br />
<br />
“This is their only prototype. I’ve got all of their research notes, so I doubt they’d be able to make it again sometime soon.”<br />
“Great work Nick!”<br />
“Can I see it?”<br />
“Sure, but be careful. It’s very delicate.”<br />
<br />
It felt a lot lighter then I was expecting. It felt like it was going to crumble in my hands. I had no idea they were working on something like this. Before I could give it back, a cacophony of heavy footsteps could be heard coming from the corridor. It grew louder and louder, until the doors to Research Room Omega swung open, and what was left of 1st Platoon marched in, along with their Sergeant. They all had their gas launchers pointed directly at us, using the desks for cover. To make matters worse, I heard an even heavier set of footsteps behind them. We all froze in fear as Lieutenant Reed strode into the room. His shirt was covered in large sweat patches, and his shorts looked somehow even tighter than before. I couldn’t take my eyes of the bulge that swung between his meaty thighs. He spoke with his usual booming voice, his face turning red with anger. He still maintained a fake grin, and a false sense of calmness.<br />
<br />
“I was wondering what caused those two accidents outside. Please, Liam, put down the gun. I’m sure we can all work this out.”<br />
“You’ve been irresponsible, Sir. We cannot let this lead to a large-scale outbreak.”<br />
“I should’ve known you were in on this Dr. Jefferson. If you do not listen to me I assure you, your futures will be less than bright. Now Liam, put the gun down!”<br />
<br />
The air grew ridiculously tense, as all eyes were on me. Our only exit was blocked off, and I could tell Reed was growing more and more agitated by the second. However, I heard Alex whisper behind me.<br />
<br />
“Their uniforms aren’t waterproof.”<br />
<br />
It didn’t take a genius to work out what he meant. For once, I didn’t think about anything, as I pulled the trigger. I was almost thrown back from the recoil. We watched as a heavy stream of the serum landed directly on the soldiers. Reed swiftly hunched under a desk, avoiding it entirely, as the Platoon were completely drenched in the liquid, including the Sergeant. Some of the soldiers were frantically trying to shake the serum off their black uniforms, but it was too late. They moaned as they felt it seep into their skin, and it wasn’t long before they started to transform. Most of them removed their gas masks as they cried out for help.<br />
<br />
“Fuck! What do we do?!”<br />
“Everyone stay calm!”<br />
“Ohhh-“<br />
<br />
The sound of their uniforms stretching as their bodies grew filled our ears. The way in which they transformed was seemingly random. One of the men groaned as their balls quadrupled in size, sending forceful waves of testosterone throughout his body. Another one flexed his arms as his biceps bulged out. Even the Sergeant couldn’t control himself, as he watched his body grow taller. Their uniforms weren’t going to last much longer. Everything happened so quickly. Their hormones were running wild, as bestial urges easily took control of them. Two of the soldiers were violently making out on the floor. Their cries for help had turned into pleasurable groans. They all wanted to show off their hairy, still-growing, bodies. One man used his newfound strength and completely tore his uniform off, before shoving his cock deep inside his squadmate, who writhed about in pleasure as he felt it grow inside him. Whilst all of this was happening, Reed emerged from his hiding place and stood menacingly on a desk. The sounds of the growing soldiers behind him was so loud, we could barely hear him.<br />
<br />
“YOU IDIOT! DO YOU REALISE WHAT YOU’VE DONE!?”<br />
<br />
I wanted to shoot him. He certainly deserved it. He already took the stuff, so why not give him a larger dose. However, when I went to shoot again the gun shook violently, causing one of the pipes to come loose, as what was left of the serum sprayed onto my torso. I instinctively dropped the gun and jumped back in surprise, causing the weapon to fall to the floor, and smash into a million pieces. Alex helped me up. I could already feel that tingling sensation across my entire body. I looked at what was left of the gun. The voices of the Platoon was considerable deeper now, and only grew louder, their low moans were almost deafening.<br />
<br />
“Shit, I’m sorry!”<br />
“It’s OK! I’ve got their research notes, that’s what matters!”<br />
“We have to get you out of here! Come on!”<br />
“YOU’RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE!”<br />
<br />
Reed’s face was somehow redder than before. He had given up on his false grin, as he gritted his teeth from anger. The room grew warmer by the second, as the Platoon’s bodyheat skyrocketed. He was so angry he didn’t even notice what was going on around him. My shoulders began to widen, and my torso elongated as Reed continued to berate us.<br />
<br />
“YOU HAVE CAUSED SO MUCH DAMAGE ALREADY! THERE IS NO WAY IN HELL YOU ARE LEAVING! NOW, I ORDER YOU TO OHHHH-“<br />
<br />
Reed moaned and hunched forward. I saw his bulge twitch in surprise. Slowly, he turned around to realise the Sergeant, now a fully-grown 8ft wall of muscle and testosterone, had firmly gripped the Lieutenant’s ass with his huge hands. Reed could only watch as the man towered over him, tearing off the his shirt with ease. He then grabbed Reed’s shorts, and with one quick pull threw their fragments across the room, leaving the Lieutenant completely naked. He tried to cover his cock, which was now semi-erect, as his body began to sweat profusely. The rest of the Platoon saw what was happening, and eagerly circled their comparatively small superior. I think it was the first time I heard genuine fear in Reed’s voice.<br />
<br />
“All of you, stop this now! No! Let me go-“<br />
<br />
He couldn’t even finish his sentence, before the platoon descended on him like predators pouncing on prey. His mouth was filled with one of the men’s giant members. The Sergeant eagerly rested his cocktip between Reed’s cheeks. He was lost in a sea of naked bodies and sweat, as soldier upon soldier rubbed their sweaty bodies against his, ensuring no part of him remained untouched. My cock ached for release, and I could feel it beginning to grow in my shorts. I knew we needed to leave whilst we had the chance, and so we ran back down the corridor. Just before we charged through the entrance the of the lab, I could hear Reed’s powerful voice resonate throughout the building.<br />
<br />
“DO IT! OHHHHH FUCK! DEEPER!”<br />
<br />
Reed was lost to the collective musks of his Platoon. His roar of delight was the last thing I heard from him. As I ran, I noticed my steps were getting larger and larger. As the doors flung open, the sunlight nearly blinded us. The two giant guards were gone. The main gate was just ahead. Freedom. I felt a cool breeze tickle my stomach. I looked down to see my vest barely covered my abs, which looked way more defined than before. I must’ve grown taller without even realising it! My thighs widened so much, they rubbed together as I ran. And my ass, it was huge! It just kept growing too, part of it spilling out of my shorts, which were on the brink of exploding. I had to stop; running and growing was surprisingly tiring. I adjusted my skintight shorts, only to feel my balls swell enormously under my hand. The urge to fuck someone was just too overwhelming. I would’ve jerked off right then and there if it wasn’t for Alex, who grabbed my hand and practically dragged me back into a running speed.<br />
<br />
“We can’t stop. We’re almost out!”<br />
“It’s too much…I can’t.”<br />
“You have to try, come on!”<br />
<br />
My voice was so deep. Alex didn’t seem phased by it, but it sent my hormones running wild. Everything felt so itchy. Large patches of thick hair started to grow on my chest. I took a deep breath in and out, as my pecs expanded, tearing off what was left of my vest. A messy jungle of chesthair stood proudly in its place. I could feel the immense levels of testosterone running throughout my entire body, as my face darkened with a beard. My mind grew more and more fuzzy, as those primal urges were brought right to the forefront of my brain. It felt like I HAD to fuck someone to survive. Alex’s ass looked so inviting. Still, I kept on running, focusing solely on the path ahead. Down the hill. Through the woods. Off the roads. I didn’t know how long we were running, but it was long enough for Alex to grow tired.<br />
<br />
“Where are we going?”<br />
“Towards the lake. There’s a truck we can use.”<br />
“Will they fit?”<br />
“Hopefully!”<br />
<br />
My large feet almost tripped on a root that protruded from the ground. It felt so strange being huge, as if the world had gotten a lot smaller. Alex too, I towered over him. I finished growing at around 9ft. Even Doug had to look up at me. His eyes were fixed on my ass. A thick stream of precum was leaking from my cock. I wasn’t sure how much of this I could take!<br />
<br />
When we finally made it to a small clearing, Andy and Nick quickly approached a large pile of loose branches and sticks. They removed them to reveal the truck. Doug and I climbed in the back, our bare torsos rubbing against each other as we sat down. The other three jumped in the front, and we were off. Finally, I could let loose.<br />
<br />
My shorts didn’t need much convincing to come off. My throbbing manhood grew again, piercing through the fabric. A thick stream of pre hit Doug in the chest. He was already jerking off. My balls were the size of basketballs, as they dangled between my thighs. I couldn’t fight it anymore, and as I pumped my cock, my brain was overwhelmed with pleasure. It was the best I had ever felt. The truck shook as Doug and I practically thrusted our entire bodies into our hands. As I had the orgasm of a lifetime I could do nothing but yell out in pure euphoria. It was as is this huge and unrelenting tidal wave of pleasure flooded my brain, and as I came so did Doug. It was like two meaty firehoses, spraying outside the truck, leaving a messy river of our seed on the road. The sheer force of our loads propelled the truck forwards, as it hastily sped away. The lab grew smaller and smaller, until it was almost out of sight. Still, we were emptying our balls everywhere. I don’t know how long we went on like this for, but it was long enough for Alex to say:<br />
<br />
“Bloody hell, are you two ever gonna stop?!”<br />
“They’ll tire themselves out.”<br />
“So, we’re out. What’s next then.”<br />
“Back to our headquarters. Until then, it’s probably best you know more about our group…”<br />
<br />
And so, we escaped. Where we were heading, I wasn’t quite so sure. It was good to be out of that place, and as I watched the lab shrink over the horizon, I couldn’t help but wonder how many more cases actually exist in the world, and why exactly this ‘organisation’ was necessary. I had no idea what was in store for us.</p>
