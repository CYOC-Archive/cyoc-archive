<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">John decided it was time to find someone else to be an alpha with him.  He called his friend Matt to see what he was up to and came over to his place.<br />
<br />
Matt had always been the kind of guy you felt you could trust with anything.  With his natural olive tint, his slightly curled black hair and his well-toned physique, he was the envy of most men, but he was actually quite a dork.  He loved the kind of shows that your normal dork does and was very affectionate with John, but just as friends.<br />
<br />
John came over to tell Matt about what had happened.  Matt didn't believe him at first, but John brought him over to see the &quot;fruits&quot; of his labors.  Seeing the wild beastmen fucking, Matt turned to John and told him that he didn't feel safe.  After John ordered the beastmen to quiet down and not leave the house, they did so.<br />
<br />
&quot;What were you thinking?&quot;, Matt said.  <br />
&quot;Why would you do that to them?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because&quot;, John replied, &quot;that first one had it coming and it was just way too hot.  I want you to be there master with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No way man, not in a million years. This is messed up.&quot;<br />
<br />
John came up with a plan, wondering if it might work.  While Matt was talking, John pricked himself and let some of his blood mix with the vial of beastman formula.  He excuse himself to get a glass of water and got one for Matt as well, while dipping the formula in Matt's drink.<br />
<br />
Matt took a drink and kept talking.  &quot;Man, why do you feel this way?  Don't you realize you don't have to control others?  I would have...gladly....uhhh&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What's wrong Matt?&quot;, John said.  &quot;Oh man, I feel weird...did you do something to me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I put a bit of my blood in the formula and gave it to you.  I want to see what happens.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;uuuuuh, John, why?  I can feel my body getting warmer and hotter.  My cock is so hard.  I want to resist...uhhh.&quot;<br />
<br />
John watched as Matt began to growl, but only barely.  Matt began to feel his hair grow out all over his body. He began to feel a heat rising inside of him, but one that he could fight back against, slightly.  He felt his knuckles crack and he gave out a slight growl.  He looked at himself in the bathroom mirror and saw his incisors grow out.  His ears began to become pointed, while his eyebrows become a unibrow.  He felt his forehead thicken and he could suddenly smell everything.  His muscles bulged, keeping his physique within regular human realms.  As the change finished, he growled at the mirror, but was still himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god&quot;, he said in a deep voice.  &quot;I feel so different, so sexual, but I still feel like...like me. I can still think.  Why, John, why?&quot;<br />
<br />
John was in awe that it worked and he could even smell the difference.  Matt had become a true alpha. <br />
<br />
&quot;It's okay buddy, I just wanted to see how you would feel.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How I feel?  I have a huge pecker with foreskin that I'm straining not to touch, a coat of fur, sharp teeth, pointed ears, deeper eyes and a gruff voice and desire to howl.  And to mate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?  Well, let's go back to my house so you can...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;NO.  I want to mate.  With you.&quot;  With that, he bit into John's shoulder slightly, bit his own tongue and allowed his blood to seep into John's body.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell man?&quot; John said, but immediately, he felt the change upon him.  All of that fire he felt must have been coming inside of everyone else began to bubble forth and he could see feel his body grow slightly, feel his teeth sharpen, his brow sloping outward, his smell increasing.  He felt his ears tug and he growled, somewhat shocked that he was making the noise.  He felt his cock change while claws grew out.  He began to growl more because he could smell Matt, his fellow Alpha...<br />
<br />
&quot;Matt, man, I need you.  Let's become mates, like our species does, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt looked at him, felt his new impulses and knew he had to give in.  &quot;Okay John, let's do this.&quot; <br />
<br />
They began kissing, feeling each others' new, alien bodies furry bodies, licking each others' fangs.  They smelled each other as they began to stroke, beastmen in body, but still human in mind.  Matt laid John down and began to insert his penis into John's rectum.  They then allowed their new species' instincts to take over.  They both began to howl wildly as they mated.  As they both came, Matt shot inside of John while John's cum went into Matt's mouth.  According to their species' instincts, they were now mated.  <br />
<br />
They both felt their bodies change back slowly to their previous forms. &quot;Whoa, man&quot;, Matt said.  &quot;Yeah&quot;, Josh said.  &quot;I get the feeling that being around each other we'll start to change if we haven't had sex in a while. I guess that's what it means to be an Alpha.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess so&quot;, said Matt.  He immediately got up, put on his clothes and told John that they needed to take care of the fellows that had been changed.  &quot;We need to set them free.  Then I need to not see you again, so that I don't change into that.  Even though I care, I just don't know, John.&quot;<br />
<br />
John nodded, and they got in the car, speeding over to John's house, before the change overtook them again.</p>
