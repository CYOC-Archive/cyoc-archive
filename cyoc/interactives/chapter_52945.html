<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next day started off absolutely horrible for Matt. Theo's loud snoring and constant moaning in his sleep kept him awake for a good majority of the night. Theo was still out like a light as Matt got up from bed. As he headed for the only mirror in the cell, Matt accidentally walked over that disgusting puddle on the floor. &quot;Damnit..&quot;, he sighed. He looked at the bottom of his foot and noticed and his covered with speckled of rock, dirt, and now water or whatever it is. <br />
<br />
He angrily continued towards the mirror and looked at his red-eyed self. From closer inspection, he noticed a deep stubble coming in around his face and scratched at it. It's that time of the week again he thought. The guards then made a loud shower call, clanking the cell bars with their guns as they made down the hallway yelling. &quot;Hey fools, Rise and shine!&quot; said a guard. Theo continued to sleep. &quot;Hey stupid, wake his big ass up.&quot; Matt jumped over to Theo and standing to rub his back. &quot;Hey, dude. Get up. It's shower time.&quot; Theo moaned and continue to snore loudly. &quot;Tch, that's why no one talks to his ass. He smell's like a big pile of shit.&quot; The guard yelled. What the guard said was quite different to what Theo told Matt yesterday night. Nevertheless, Matt didn't like the guards attitude. &quot;Lay off him will ya.&quot; &quot;Ha, you butt buddies or something?&quot; &quot;Look, the guy seemed to had a hard time here at prison so why don't you buzz off.&quot; &quot;Fine, I'll just do that. Go ahead and smell like him for the rest of your time here.&quot; <br />
<br />
Matt sneered at the guard as he walked by, suddenly Matt realized that he actually stood up for this guy! A guy he just met yesterday no even! What in the world!? He would never act this way towards a guy, especially as big as him. &quot;Hey, Matt. Thanks for sticking up for me. I know I'm big enough to defend myself now, but I really appreciate what you said back there.&quot; So he was awoke, eh? &quot;Hey, why did you lie to me like that last night?&quot; &quot;Er.. I have a very bad fear of water and can't stand to look at it rather then be in it; a severe case of Hydrophobia is what the white suits call it. That's why I'm here now. I ended up pushing a guy who couldn't swim over a ledge into a river cause I was mad. I was too scared to help him and let him drown, and now I'm labeled as a murderer. I'm sorry, bud.. I was afraid that you would think I'm a some freak or something and wouldn't like me anymore..&quot; &quot;Buds, don't lie to buds Y'know.&quot; Matt replied. Theo made that sad puppy dog face again and look as he was about to cry. <br />
<br />
He didn't know what it was but Matt couldn't stay mad at the big guy. His brutish demeanor that he initially thought of Theo when he first saw him pulled an absolutely 180. Matt rubbed the guys back trying to comfort him and Theo started to silently cry. While Matt felt sad, he also felt disgusted at Theo for crying as big as he is. &quot;Hey, c'mon now. You're a big guy right? You shouldn't be crying for petty shit as this.&quot; &quot;I-I'm r-really sorry.&quot;, Theo sniffed. Matt was starting to get mad. &quot;Seriously, quit crying. Man up. No more lies alright?&quot; Theo nodded and wiped the tears off his face. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hold up a minute, did I seriously just comfort another guy?&quot; Matt was astonished. He was a class-A jerk in school, a bully to every nerd who crossed him, yet he managed to comfort and calm a &quot;man&quot; he hasn't even known for a whole day? Matt was seriously starting to get weirded out. &quot;Hey, bud? You okay? You don't look too good&quot;, uttered a concerned Theo. &quot;I-I'm fine, I think.&quot;, he said as he scratched his armpit unnoticed. He eyed Theo from head to toe as he still layed across his bed. Before he reached his head back to Theo's rear. The previous guard came by, opened the cell and threw in plenty of laundry. &quot;Haha, you really do like that guy do ya? Take these prison clothes. You'll be needed them since I ain't letting you guys out for showers anymore.&quot; &quot;Bastard.&quot; Matt angrily replied. &quot;What you call me!?&quot; The guard pulled a Taser out and shock Matt. Matt fell to the floor in pain. &quot;Don't go thinking your hot stuff just because you're new in this joint, dumbass!&quot; Theo angrily jumped out of his bed, confronted the guard, and began to sneer at him.&quot;Uhuhuh, I wouldn't be doing that if I were you. I'll send you to the hole faster then this guy fell on the floor.&quot; Theo didn't care and continued to slowly approach him. The guard covered his nose.&quot;Fine, fine. I get it. Back off will ya your stench is worst when your up close.&quot; Theo forcefully shoved the guard out of his cell and slammed it shut. Theo quickly turned looked and looked at Matt. &quot;You okay, bud!?&quot; &quot;Y-yeah, I'm fine.&quot; &quot;Here, hold still.&quot; Theo slowly picked up Matt and carried him to his bunk.</p>
