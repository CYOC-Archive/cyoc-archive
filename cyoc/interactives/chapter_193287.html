<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff looked through the package. It would be permanent if he were to do something. He then thought about it for a minute.<br />
<br />
That was when Jeff realized the perfect chance. He could merge with his next door neighbor. Her name was Ava, and she was relatively new to the area. Not only that, but she did look rather hot too.<br />
<br />
Jeff then set the parameters for the change. He set it to reality alter, and that he would be in charge. He also set it so that the change would take only about ten minutes to complete. <br />
<br />
Jeff looked over what he had set, and decided upon it. He took a deep breath.<br />
<br />
“Here goes nothing.”<br />
<br />
He hit the button, and immediately felt like heading next door. He had set the program to merge himself and Ava when they next touched.<br />
<br />
Jeff got up, and headed for the door. His parents were away, and he probably wouldn’t see them again as himself. He then opened the door and walked to the next house over.<br />
<br />
Jeff rang the doorbell, and a woman answered the door.<br />
<br />
“Oh, hello Jeff, how are you?” The woman asked, who also happened to be Ava’s mother.<br />
<br />
“I’m doing great. Is Ava home? I need to ask her about something for school.” Jeff said.<br />
<br />
“Oh yes, just a moment.” Ava’s mother said. The door then closed. Jeff waited for another moment when the door opened yet again.<br />
<br />
This time, a young girl answered the door, one with gorgeous straight hair, and a nice pair of breasts. She had vibrant blue eyes, and a light skin tone. She was also wearing what looked to be short shorts and a tank top.<br />
<br />
“Hey Jeff, you said there was something about school?” Ava asked. <br />
<br />
Jeff nodded, “yeah, I wanted to check on the math homework, I didn’t get all the questions written down.” He said as he fabricated his lie.<br />
<br />
“Oh yeah, give me just a second.” Ava said as she closed the door yet again. Jeff decided that the next time she opened it, he would make his move.<br />
<br />
Ava opened the door, notebook in hand. “Here you go.” She said, passing the book to Jeff. As he took it, he brushed his hand against hers. <br />
<br />
They were both then filled with a rather orgasmic wave of pleasure. Jeff was sure he just let a bit out there. <br />
<br />
Ava then turned around, and Jeff felt like there was a force pulling him towards Ava. She went upstairs to her room, and Jeff followed.<br />
<br />
When they got up to the room, Ava locked the door, and then stripped stark naked in front of Jeff, who did the same thing. <br />
<br />
Ava sat down, and Jeff felt forced to sit directly on top of her. He then felt his body tingle, as the merge officially started.<br />
<br />
The first thing to happen, was their feet merging together. Jeff felt as his feet were forced into Ava’s. He looked down to see that the hair originally there was disappearing. He felt as they became smaller and much more petite.<br />
<br />
He then felt his ankles and calfs start to push into her body. He could feel as his muscle was being added, but things such as his hair were disappearing to a clean shaven look. He could even feel as his bones merged with hers, while hers would take priority. <br />
<br />
Jeff then felt as his knees, and upper thighs merged with Ava’s. His butt then started to push inward toward Ava’s vagina. He could feel as it became more round and pronounced. Giving him a round ass. <br />
<br />
He then felt the part that he had been waiting for. His penis sat directly on top of Ava’s vagina, and Jeff could feel as it was pulling itself inward. He realized that Ava’s body was stronger than his, and that he would be a female. He felt as his penis and testicles fully vanished, leaving him as a her. <br />
<br />
Jeff reached her old hand to her now new and tight vagina. She felt pleasure with every second that her had was down there. She felt the new lips of her pussy, and reached a finger into her new vagina. She moaned a bit with pleasure, as well as Ava’s part.<br />
<br />
The next changes were in her upper body, starting with her stomach, which lost a lot of fat that had built up. She then felt as her chest pulled inward towards Ava’s, and that any fat she had there, were just added to her new breasts.<br />
<br />
He arms then merged, becoming rather dainty, but underneath was a good amount of muscle. <br />
<br />
The last changes were their faces, as they were pulled together. Jeff could feel as Ava’s features were more dominant, which made sense, even if she did end up getting some features such as Jeff’s nose. <br />
<br />
When Jeff’s hair vanished, that was the end of the changes. Jeff had now essentially become her next door neighbor. With that, Jeff felt as a rush of memories flooded in. Things such as her birthdays, first kiss, and other things were gained. She also had a memory of a new name, Sarah. <br />
<br />
Sarah then realized that she was sitting full naked on her bed. She looked around to the new, yet familiar room. It was definitely girly, but she noticed that the computer from when she was Jeff was now in her room. It seemed that she got to keep the chronivac after all.<br />
<br />
Sarah then explored her body, which was again, both new and familiar. She felt up her body, from her toes, up to her new vagina. She then played with her breasts.<br />
<br />
Sarah then decided to do something she had always wanted to do, by practicing many provocative poses. The first of which was spreading her legs as far as possible, and then feeling as her Vagina rubbed against the cloth of the bed.<br />
<br />
Sarah then decided on what to do next.</p>
