<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Calvin listened to what the girl was telling him, thinking she was off her nut or having him on. After she'd finished, he just stared at her before finally asking, &quot;This is some type of joke, right? You get some schmuck to do this and you and your friends have a laugh?&quot;<br />
<br />
Shaking her head, the girl, whom Calvin had learned was called Tanya, furrowed her brow and shook her head. Looking at Calvin, she explained, &quot;As I said, this is for a sorority initiation. I just thought you could help me,&quot; and crossing her arms, she begin to chew on her lip. Still looking at Calvin, she said, &quot;I just thought you could help, especially with the way you look.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What's wrong with the way I look,&quot; Calvin explained.<br />
<br />
Still biting her lip and furrowing her brow, Tanya explained, &quot;Well, you do have the air of somebody that is totally comfortable with their sexuality. But at the same time, you have a feminine look. So I figured you'd be perfect.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thinking this girl was having him on, finding it hard to believe that at six foot four inches he looked anywhere near feminine, Calvin thought about telling this girl she should get her eyes checked. Instead, he asked, &quot;You said this was for a sorority initiation,&quot; to which she nodded and than Calvin said, &quot;Any you want me to dress up as a girl so you can prove that you actually found somebody, a total stranger, to bring with you to this party?&quot;<br />
<br />
Another nod from Tanya and than she replied, &quot;Uh huh. If you don't want to do, that's fine. But I only have a couple hours before the party,&quot; and still furrowing her brow and biting her lip, she uncrossed her arms, crossed her arms a second time and than added, &quot;I could pay you, if you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shaking his head, thinking that woman only paid men for select services, Calvin told her, &quot;That's okay,&quot; and glancing away, he started to think.<br />
<br />
On one hand he thought this would be a perfect opportunity to meet some girls and maybe teach them about their place. While on the other hand he thought this was totally beneath him, a hair-brained-scheme and something only a girl could think up. Weighing the pros and cons, Calvin continued to stare off at nothing. In front of him, Tanya uncrossed her arms yet again and after a moment, crossed them a third time and asked, &quot;So can I count on your help or not?&quot;<br />
<br />
In a terse tone, Calvin told her, &quot;I'm thinking,&quot; feeling her prattle was a prime example as to why girls needed to be shown their place.&quot;<br />
<br />
Calmly, looking at Tanya, he smiled and said, &quot;I just need to think. What you're asking for is a lot,&quot; and looking off, he added, &quot;Yeah, I'm secure with my sexuality, so that is no problem. It's just...&quot; and trailing off, Calvin tried to figure out a way to explain.<br />
<br />
Still hugging herself, biting her lip and furrowing her brow, Tanya nodded as if she understood what Calvin was trying to get at. Still looking off, Calvin asked, &quot;And I would have to go dressed as a girl? I couldn't go dressed the way I am,&quot; and making a motion with his hand, he indicated toward the simple shirt he was wearing, shoes and jeans.<br />
<br />
A shake of her head and Tanya replied, &quot;No. The sorority was specific that it had to be a girl and somebody I don't know.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sighing, Calvin continued to think of what he should do. As he found himself torn between the idea of him pretending to be a girl to be a real bad idea and whom he could meet if he was dressed as a girl, Tanya suddenly cut into his thoughts and said, &quot;Listen. If you don't want to do it, that's fine. It's not like it is going to hurt my feelings or anything. But I sort of need you to make a decision and soon.&quot; and uncrossing her arms, she gazed at Calvin, an expectant look crossing her face.<br />
<br />
Calvin, focusing on her and deciding that maybe doing this would allow him to meet some girls and teach them their place, nodded and told her, &quot;All right.&quot;<br />
<br />
Clapping, Tanya looked as if she was about to hug him, but instead shifted and told him, &quot;I can promise, you shan't regret this,&quot; and making a motion for him to follow her, she said, &quot;Making you look like a girl is going to be so easy. My major is fashion design and my minor is theatre, both of which come super easy, almost natural to me,&quot; as she started to walk.<br />
<br />
A feeling of wanting to tell Tanya to shut it, to put her in her place, crossed Calvin's mind. Instead, repressing the feeling, he just listened and nodded as he followed her back to were she was living.<br />
----<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay. So this is my place and I am sorry if it's kind of messy,&quot; Tanya said as she opened the door to her apartment and kicked off her shoes. Behind her, Calvin also removed his shoes and gazing about, he casually commented, &quot;I've seen worse.&quot;<br />
<br />
Smiling, Tanya asked, &quot;Really?&quot; to which Calvin just nodded as she led him through the apartment.<br />
<br />
As she opened the door to her room, Tanya explained, &quot;So making you look like a girl will be no problem. It's just getting you to walk, talk and act like a girl that might cause us some minor problems.&quot; and reaching for a couple bottles on the dresser, she handed them to Calvin, telling him, &quot;I need you to first rub the purple stuff over your legs, chest, armpits, arms and any part of your face that a beard and moustache would cover. Leave it on for five minutes, it will start to feel cool about then, and than scrub it off. Afterward, I need you to wash you hair with the peach-smelling stuff and you face and body with the peach-coloured stuff.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nodding, wondering what it was he was getting himself into, Calvin asked, &quot;Where's the bathroom?&quot; to which Tanya immediately pointed to a door on the other side of her room.<br />
<br />
Another nod and Calvin started for the bathroom as Tanya explained, &quot;Towels are in the small closet behind the shower,&quot; and than exited out of the bedroom leaving Calvin holding three bottles full of what he thought appeared to be oddly-coloured cum.<br />
<br />
Walking into the bathroom, Calvin dropped the bottles on the sink and seeing that he was still wearing the ring the Roma had given him, he thought about taking it off. Instead, he located the small closet and taking out a towel, he dropped in on the sink. Spying a digital timer, he once again wondered what it was he was getting himself into, but shrugging, he began to shrug off his clothes. Naked, he picked up the bottle of purple goop, examined it for a moment and than squirted a fair bit on his hand.<br />
<br />
As he looked at what he had squirted in his hand Calvin suddenly had a feeling of normalcy come over him. Shrugging, unsure why he thought it would feel normal for him to be spreading some glop on his body, Calvin began to slowly lather the purple stuff over his body, starting at the ankles and working up. Afterward, he set the timer and waited.<br />
<br />
When the digital timer announced five-minutes, Calvin began to run the shower, thinking, &quot;This better be worth it,&quot; as he did so.<br />
----<br />
<br />
After fumbling his way through the two other bottles, Calvin stepped out of the shower about twenty-seven minutes later and reaching for the towel, he began to dry himself off. Wrapping the towel around his waist, Calvin stepped out of the bathroom and was immediately accosted by Tanya, who asked, &quot;Do you mind wrapping the towel around your torso? Just below your armpits?&quot;<br />
<br />
Not seeing the difference, Calvin replied, &quot;Why?&quot; in as casual as a tone as he could muster.<br />
<br />
Appearing to fumble with what she was about to say, Tanya blurted out, &quot;Well. Because a girl does it. And if anyone were to show up, not that I'm expecting anyone, with what I am about to do, I think it might be kind of awkward to explain why I'm making a boy look like a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
Not sure how to respond, Calvin thought for a moment before turning and heading back into the bathroom to readjust the towel. Behind him, Tanya called out, &quot;Thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
After he'd adjusted the towel so that it was wrapped around his midsection, Calvin returned to the bedroom and following Tanya's directions, took a seat. Moving around behind him, commenting, &quot;I'm going to start with the hair. I'll be lengthening it with some cosmetic pieces so that it is shoulder length,&quot; and running her fingers through his hair, Tanya began.<br />
<br />
After she'd finished with his hair, Tanya moved around to his front and explaining, &quot;This foundation with help with your facial appearance,&quot; she began to rub some type of tan cream on Calvin's face.<br />
<br />
When she'd finished that, Tanya insisted that Calvin push the towel down to just below his chest. When he did that Tanya began to apply two items over his chest, needing no explanation as Calvin could clearly see that they were what appeared to be fake breasts complete with a set of life-like areolas and nipples. When she finished with that, Tanya rubbed more of the tan cream over both the breast and his skin and after a moment, Calvin found it hard to tell were the inserts began and his own skin ended.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stand up, please,&quot; Tanya told him and when Calvin did so, catching the towel before it dropped to the ground, she handed him a dress and told him, &quot;Put this on. It fastens up at the nape of the neck.&quot;<br />
<br />
Feeling ridiculous, Calvin stepped into the dress and fumbled with the catch. When Tanya saw he was having problems, she stepped forward and assisted, pulling and pushing until, when Calvin looked down, he found himself staring at his own cleavage. As he did this, Tanya handed him a pair of underwear, low-cut bikini briefs with a purple floral print on them, and said, &quot;Make sure you tuck your equipment back,&quot; as she reached forward and adjusted the dress some more, commenting, &quot;Glad I didn't go with a C cup. Your body looks fine with a B cup,&quot; as she did so.<br />
<br />
When Calvin had finally gotten the panties on and his privates tucked back between his legs, Tanya handed him a pair of shoes and than guided him to sit on her bed when Calvin took them. Showing him how to sit and position himself, Tanya than showed him how to put the heels on and carefully position the straps so that they wrapped around his ankle, offering support. When Calvin had finally gotten the shoes on, Tanya encouraged him to stand and guiding him back into the bathroom on shaky feet, feeling like he was going to fall over at any moment, Calvin allowed himself to be positioned before a mirror. Staring into the reflective surface, he could only gape.<br />
<br />
As Tanya commented, &quot;You make such a lovely girl, you don't even need make-up,&quot; Calvin stared at his reflection, noting that he really did look female, from his shoulder length dark-blonde hair down to how smooth his legs appeared.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now we begin teaching how to walk, talk and act like a girl,&quot; Tanya announced as Calvin realised that for some odd reason, he no longer looked to be over six feet tall. Peering closer, he thought that he in fact appeared to be about five-foot five, five-foot three without the heels. Curious and wanting to ask how Tanya had managed such a think, Calvin had no time to ask as Tanya turned him around and led him back to the bedroom, through it and into the living room.<br />
<br />
Sitting down on the couch, she smiled and said, &quot;Your name is Sandy. Now, Sandy, walk for me.&quot; as both a feeling of uncertainty and the sensation of normalcy crept over Calvin.</p>
