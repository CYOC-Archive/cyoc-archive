<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mr. Mendes just stood in his bathroom, looking at his tiny little boy cock. None of what just happened made any sense. He looked over his body again. He was still the same height, he stepped on the bathroom scale, his weight hadn't changed either. Even the hair that led away from his cock up to his bely button was still there, only it started about two inches above his dick. Mr. Mendes went on searching his body for any other changes, while the boys quietly closed the bedroom door, and went back to the den.<br />
Ric was thinking about the way Mr. Mendes looked with his tight, slim, cut body that had a prepubesent penis attached to it. Ric's own member began to fill his briefs. Josh had thought it was mean to make Mr. Mendes' cock so young, he was really nice and didn't deserve a dick that looked like it belonged to an 5th grader. Josh turned to Ric and asked &quot;I don't think it was right to make his dick so small. Ric, I think you should make Mr. Mendes the right size.&quot; Ric looked at his little brother, annoyed that he had wanted to change Mr. Mendes back. He considered turning his brother's meat back to the size of a five year old, that would shut him up, Ric thought. Quite suddenly, Ric agreed with Josh, and said he'd make Mr. Mendes look normal, again. They both crept back to the master bedroom, and opened the door, just enough to see Mr. Mendes still in the bathroom.<br />
Mr. Mendes didn't know how much time had passed since his last jack off. All  he knew was he was a good looking stud, with a toned and tight body, with his 13 year old cock planted between his legs, even if it looked like it was more around the age of twelve or eleven. His mind couldn't except what he saw sticking out between his thighs.<br />
Ric found the spells he was looking for, he would combine two spells to get the right effect. Mr. Mendes shuttered, his cock felt like it was inside a warm wet mouth. He looked down to see his small organ get hard, it went to its full length, 3 and a half inches. Mr. Mendes moaned as it began to feel like someone was skinning his entire package, his cock and his balls. He looked and down a realized why it felt like his crotch was being ripped apart. His balls had grown back to his 14 year old size, stretching his sack to more than it could hold. His shaft had outgrown his foreskin, it was half an inch too long for his little boy flask. The searing pain faded as his skin began stretching itself farther down his cock covering more of it, and his sack loosened and let his balls move away from his body. A small and neat coating of hair sprouted from the base of his rod, with a thin line of a few hairs leading up to the trail near his belly button, but his balls remained hairless. It seemed at least this time around his balls would be bigger than he remembered, they were the size of walnut shells. He watched his cock lengthen and get just a little wider, until it was five inches long, he expected it to keep on going, to bring him back to his former 7 and a half. So did Josh. But it stayed a 5 inches long, hard as steel, but only five inches long.<br />
Josh turned to his brother and asked &quot;What happened? Why did it stop? He only looks like his junk is on its way to being the right age. Like it stopped in right after Jr.high or something.&quot; Ric smiled at his little brother, &quot;I never said anything about making Mr. Mendes 32 again,&quot; he wispered, &quot;all I said was I'd make him look normal. Would it be normal for a 14 year old to have have a grown man's piece hanging out in front of him?&quot; Josh looked at his brother, completely confused, Ric told him to just watch Mr. Mendes. Ric said the second spell so softly that Josh could only catch bits and pieces of what he was saying, not that he understood the language anyways, not without the book to guide him.<br />
Mr. Mendes reached down to touch his manlier, but still teenage rod. His body began to feel weird, like his whole body had falled asleep. The sensation stopped, he ran back to his bedroom mirror to see if anything had changed. He looked himself over, no, nothing had changed, other than his cock and balls, which still looked 14. Wait, the hair on his arms and legs seemed to be less than what he remembered, the same went for the hair around his belly button. Since his first year in college, he had been in the weight room at least 5 times a week. He had never gotten huge, but that was okay with him, he like being able to see nice definition on his chest and stomach, and how his pecks stood out just alittle, with the slight, but hard six pack making small ripples in his torso. Along with the soft ball size biceps curving his arms, his calves that looked like they had two avocados stuck in them.  He looked at his body, thinking even if his dick was too young to match the rest of him, he still had a great looking body, for anyone's age. That's when he noticed the shadows his muscles made, began to get smaller. At first he thought it was a trick of the light, and shifted postions in front of the mirror. No! His muscles were getting smaller! His chest didn't stick out in front of him as much as it did a second ago. He still had his six pack but it looked a little sunken in. His biceps looked like they were the size of baseballs now, and his calves only seemed to be lemon-sized. His wrists and ankles looked like they had no muscle on them, as if they only had the bone beneath the skin, his fingers looked the same, long and gangly. Mr. Mendes recalled the image of himself in his senior year of high school. He had grown to his full height of 5'8 but he had almost no buldging muscles, like he did after college. He remembered that all the muscles in his body could be seen as he moved, he had only about three percent body fat, he wasn't skin and bones though, he had his muscles, and he was pretty hot looking in high school, still, he was sad at losing the pounds of muslce. He looked in the mirror and realized he was looking into the eyes of his 18 year old self, with one small exception, his cock still looked like it belonged on his body when he was a freshman. Almost as soon as he thought that, he began to regret it. His muscles began to soften, and the hair he had left on his arms and legs began to get lighter. His muscles looked a little smaller now and they didn't look so defined anymore. His spine began to feel numb, the ends of his leg and arm bones felt the same way. He noticed the carpet looked closer than it had before. He then realized he was getting shorter, he was now just over 5'6. He still had his spidery hands and long feet. He felt that numb feeling in his bones again, this time it was more intense. He looked around his room, judging from how tall the mirror was he guessed he was only 5'4 now. He groaned as he watched much of his muscle fade away beneath his thin layer of baby fat. If he flexed, he could still see the muscle moving underneath the skin, but it wasnt very impressive. Mr. Mendes, now Franky, as everyone had called him throughout high school, watched as the last remaining hairs on his belly got lighter and dissappeared. The same thing happened with his arms, the hairs turned almost blond, and then they weren't even there anymore. He examined his legs, only a few wiry light brown strands were there now, mostly around his ankles. He felt one last wave of numbness, the strongest one since it first began. Franky shut his eyes, he didnt want to see what he looked like now, but he couldn't stop himself. He was just a little taller then 5 feet. There was no hair on his arms or legs, and just a few hairs that travled up his stomach, they didn't even reach past his waist. His hands still looked huge to him even though they had gotten younger, they seemed to big for him, he looked down and saw that he looked like he would fit into a size 9 shoe. Pretty big for someone who's only about 5 feet tall. He remembered now, he was very clumsy in junior high, his hands and feet had grown before the rest of him. His cock looked perfect now for his body, his balls even seemed a little on the big side.</p>
