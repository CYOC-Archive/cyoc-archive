<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was already about mid afternoon when the two of you finally were left alone. &quot;I need to lie down for a bit&quot; you said as you began taking off your heels. Mia stops you however. &quot;No wait. Keep them on. If you are going to be a woman, walking in heels may become a necessary talent to have, so while I am here, could you please continue to wear them. That way I can catch you if you are about to fall.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maybe it was how she said it, but you decided to trust her and kept the heels on. &quot;Ok, so now what?&quot; Since she didn&#39;t want you to sleep yet, she could make the plans.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right... um. Now then, how do I say this without sounding wierd? Uhhhhhh... screw it I will just be blunt with it. Do you wanna fuck?&quot;<br />
<br />
Next thing you knew, Your left leg was raised over Mia&#39;s shoulder with the other on the ground, as she pumped her erect clit-dick in and out of your ass while you were moaning like a bitch in heat. Her clit-dick felt better than any dildo you owned. And your balls kept slapping against it too, sending shivers throughout your body. This was the best sex you have ever had, hands down. You both were going pretty hard too. And the nub that was formally your dick had been just drooling precum down your leg for a few minutes now. <br />
<br />
With your back pressed up against a wall, Mia lifted your other leg over her right shoulder and wrapped her big strong hands around your tiny waist, making sure you didn&#39;t fall backwards. Almost all of your body weight was centered on her Clit-dick though. Oh yeah, you could get use to doing this. You never expected that you would enjoy being the one getting fucked so much. <br />
<br />
It was then you felt it. A pressure was quickly building up somewhere behind your own dick. Building and building, until you finally felt it burst out from your dick as you sprayed an incredible amount of cum everywhere. Globs of it plopped down onto the floor in thick, gooey puddles, while the rest of it dripped off of Mia&#39;s and your own chest. The sight of it made you tense up as another round of cum sprayed out of you. It was just so erotic. You were finally out of breath after your third and final orgasm. There was just so much cum everywhere. But you figured with balls the size of yours, it likely was to be expected.<br />
<br />
Mia chuckles after a few seconds, which makes you also start laughing. &quot;Damn you sure made a mess&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;And who was it that made me do it?&quot; You reply, leaning over to rest your body on her chest. You were surprised at just how flexible thia woman&#39;s body was. You could put both legs fully behind your back and head without using your hands at all. &quot;Ugh, I feel so sticky now&quot; Mia said as she carried you to the bathroom. Her clit-dick hadn&#39;t yet left your ass too, so each and every step felt like a small thrust to you. <br />
<br />
After drawing a bath, Mia slides in with you, taking a seat in the warm water, and begins wiping off all of the cum. The two of you were still attached the entire time too. You wondered when it was that you would let her go, if ever. Mia gently began cleaning your boobs for you, as you watched her hands work. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, so do you think that we should change how we address each other and ourselves?&quot; You ask. Mia stops cleaning your boobs and pauses for a bit. &quot;Like, Clearly you are much more of a man than I am, at least currently. And I am now a woman, and quite possibly will be one for life. So I was thinking that, at least for me that is, maybe I should start referring to myself as a woman. As in when you are speaking of me, you would use she, not he, and such. And I would be your girlfriend or whatever we are considered. Our sex just now really drove that point home for me. I am a woman now. I have huge tits, which are still growing bigger as we speak, I sound like a woman, I am the one who gets fucked, my dick is nearly a fully formed pussy, and apparently I have the beginnings of a womb now too. The only difference between me and any other woman is that I have a huge sack of estrogen hanging from my soon to be labia.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mia just listened until you were done before she spoke. &quot;It&#39;s up to you I guess. I personally prefer to still be called Mia and such, but I guess when we are out in public, I could stand being called your boyfriend for appearance reasons. But if we are entering that kind of relationship, I want to be a girlfriend to you, at least unless I get more comfortable as a man. But I can call you my girlfriend if you want to be seen as a woman now.&quot;<br />
<br />
You nod in agreement, after which, Mia resumes massaging your boobs under the guise of &quot;washing&quot; them. You didn&#39;t mind though. She could continue groping you for as long as she wanted for all you cared. &quot;It felt nice, so why would you ever ask her to stop?&quot; was your reasoning. Mia&#39;s clit-dick was still hard in your ass, so to return the favor, you slowly began moving your ass around, seductively playing with it. <br />
<br />
For the rest of the day, you both did everything togethed, specifically because your ass refused to let go of her clit-dick, not that either of you minded though. On the contrary, the both of you found it to be a little bit exhilarating. As long as you kept your heels on, you were just tall enough to where walking was not difficult. But for the most part, you spent the day with your smooth, hairless legs wrapped around Mia&#39;s waist with your arms wrapped around her back, letting your ass and her clit-dick support your weight.<br />
<br />
Later that night, a knock came from the main door to the apartment, Mia walked you both over and answered it, finding both Dr. Jill and Dr. Anna standing there. When they saw you both, Dr. Anna blushed, while Dr. Jill remained unphased and greeted you both. &quot;Good evening, I am happy to see you both are taking to living with each other well enough. I will just say this now, but be sure to use proper birth control once you start your menstrual cycle. There would be nothing we could do if you were to become pregnant besides treat you as any other human mother from that moment forward, as policy dictates that we do not mess with babys and birthing unless under certain circumstances. We of course will provide you with everything, feom the pill, to condoms, to even a small transformation where we replace all of your ovum with those of a dog in order to make pregnancy impossible, that is of course, unless you get ejaculated into by a male dog.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure.... I will keep that in mind.&quot; You say awkwardly, while internally, you were now curious about whether carrying around and eventually birthing a litter of puppies was enjoyable or not. Mia however answered for you. &quot;Don&#39;t even think about it.&quot; She warned you. &quot;Think about what?&quot; You respond. &quot;Don&#39;t become some dog&#39;s bitch. If anything, you are my bitch, and mine alone, got it? Oh and you will never get anything past me ever again. Just FYI, but your ass is terrible at keeping secrets and lying. I felt you tighten up when she mentioned birthing puppies.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is an interesting observation Mia&quot; interrupted Dr. Anna, having just regained her composure. &quot;As for why we are here. We have an update for you both on your current conditions. As you both know. We have been monitoring your bodies for the last several hours, and have also completed several tests using the blood we took earlier today. And from what we can guess...&quot;</p>
