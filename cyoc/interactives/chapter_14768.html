<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty stood before the tall mirror and let out a deep sigh.<br />
<br />
“Okay, time to get rid of all the muscles and to be my old 124-pound self again…” he wished out loud.<br />
<br />
His giant muscles started to deflate like balloons which were losing all the air. His legs were slowly shrinking in size, and his torso and arms were quickly losing their muscle mass as well. In a matter of seconds, Ty just stood there, looked at his old, scrawny self once again.<br />
<br />
“Wow… What a wild ride that was!” he whispered to himself. He was very pleased with the way his body responded to his wishes, and he marveled at the extent of his powers. He could do whatever he wanted now; he could form, change and manipulate his body to be as tall, as big, as small, or as muscular as he wished. Never before had he felt so good about himself!<br />
<br />
He was looking at himself, standing there, in his bedroom, wearing only his boxers. He was barefoot and his chest was showing, but he didn’t care. He was just having way too much fun changing himself before his mirror.<br />
<br />
“Let’s see, what haven’t I tried yet?” he wondered out loud, while he stared back up at the wooden panels on the ceiling.<br />
<br />
“I know!” he cheered, as he snapped his fingers. “I can shrink… I can make myself shrink until I’m only six inches tall, and I want my boxers to shrink along with my body, so I don’t catch cold!”<br />
<br />
His body was overcome with a strong tingling sensation, and the shrinkage got underway immediately following a jolt. Ty just looked around the room, with his mouth open wide in amazement, as he was going through a sinking feeling. The room started growing larger, the bed, the walls, the chair, the desk, and the posters on the wall were all apparently growing larger as Ty slowly continued to shrink in size.<br />
<br />
Ty tilted his head straight up and noted how the ceiling seemed to be moving farther and further away, while the bed appeared to be growing bigger and bigger. <br />
<br />
Ty slowly turned towards his desk, and chuckled at the sight of the desk now standing taller than him, as he quietly passed the three-foot mark in height. The bed was now very high, and the chair seemed to be growing to gigantic proportions! The legs under the chair were now as big as columns of a building, the bed was now too far from the ground, and the handle on the bedroom door was now much beyond his reach.<br />
<br />
“Whoa… this is totally majestic…” Ty wondered out loud, as he passed the one-foot mark in height. <br />
<br />
Ty turned around and faced the tall mirror. It suddenly seemed so hard to believe that he was over nine feet tall, and that was just a few minutes ago. He stood in complete awe of his powers, and he couldn’t help but laugh at the possibilities which existed for him, now that he had fully mastered his abilities.<br />
<br />
He wanted to feel what it was like to shrink, so he knew what others would go through, when he would make them shrink as well. He loved the idea of being so tiny, that he could be unseen by others. He could walk into any room unnoticed, and he could see and hear everything that he ever wanted, without even being noticed by any normal human being.<br />
<br />
“I’m gonna have way too much fun with these powers… Seriously!” Ty laughed to himself, as he noted that the shrinking had stopped. Nothing seemed to be growing anymore, and everything had stopped increasing in size.<br />
<br />
Ty turned towards the bedroom door, which was closed. The white, wooden door now seemed like it was as tall as a skyscraper, and the ceiling seemed to be so far away, like the clouds in the open sky.<br />
<br />
The opening between the bottom edge of the inch-thick wooden door was about an inch from the flat, tiled floor in his bedroom. Although he was now six inches tall, Ty didn’t feel like bending down and crawling under the door on his stomach.<br />
<br />
“Shoot…” he laughed “I can make myself small enough so that I can WALK under my bedroom door without having to crawl on my hands and knees…. It’s so cool having this power… “<br />
<br />
Ty began to shrink once again, and this time, it stopped when he was exactly one inch in height. He turned around and took one more look at his giant room, which seemed like the bedroom of a giant. Then he turned towards the door, and he quietly walked right under the edge of the tall, wooden door to his bedroom.<br />
<br />
“Ha! Who would think, I’d make myself only an inch tall?” he wondered to himself.<br />
<br />
Ty found himself standing in the hallway. The bathroom was to the right, and Dustin and Peter’s bedrooms were on the left. <br />
<br />
For the moment, he thought about who he would visit first, while enjoying his new, tiny size.<br />
<br />
“Boy am I going to give somebody a scare in the middle of the night….” The one-inch tall Ty chuckled to himself, as he slowly started to make his way down the hall.<br />
<br />
As he looked down, he could see details that he would have never imagined. He saw the grooves between the different tiles on the floor, as well as all the tiny cracks in the tiles and in the walls. Small dust and dirt particles were everywhere, as he noticed certain things for the very first time in his life. The house was like a giant building to him, and he was fascinated by the perspective that the size had given him. He was practically as tiny as a mouse, and he could barely imagine the hours upon hours of fun he could have.<br />
<br />
“Let’s see….” He wondered. “Who should I visit first?”<br />
<br />
Ty was standing before the two doors. As he looked straight ahead, he noticed that there were no lights that were shining in either bedroom.<br />
<br />
“Both of those sluggards are sound asleep…” he laughed, as he stood before the two bedroom doors, wondering where he should go next. He figured that this would be the night where he would begin the adventures of Ty, the tiny guy!</p>
