<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Sorry to keep everyone waiting for the next episode. It&#39;s been a VERY rough week at work but I&#39;m here now.—tmw.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The O&#39;Tooles were just like any other family.<br />
Both parents worked, although Mom was usually home before the kids got out of school for the day and once Dad came home, everyone would sit around the table and talk about things while having dinner.<br />
The fact that since this is Moon Lake, the O&#39;Tooles were also a family of weretigers wasn&#39;t considered odd.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, how was school today?&quot; was their father&#39;s usual opening question. They were all sitting around the table in their fursonas, but unlike their more animalistic &quot;cousins&quot;, were using such modern conveniences as silverware, plates, glasses, and napkins while minding their table manners.<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; replied his son Fred, to which his daughter Ginger nodded in agreement.<br />
After each spouse inquired as to how their respective day at work went, Jeanette O&#39;Toole brought up the subject Ginger hoped she wouldn&#39;t.<br />
&quot;I met John Harper today,&quot; she said.<br />
&quot;Oh? Where?&quot; wondered her husband Nelson.<br />
&quot;Here.&quot;<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; he asked, surprised at her response.<br />
&quot;Apparently our daughter and him have a date Saturday,&quot; said her mother calmly, to which both father and daughter looked shocked and her brother Fred surprised. &quot;Pending our permission, of course.&quot;<br />
&quot;What kind of a date?&quot; asked Nelson, turning to look at his daughter.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not an actual date date,&quot; replied Ginger, suddenly feeling herself on the defensive. &quot;John asked me to show him around Moon Lake, and when I said I&#39;d have to ask for your permission first, he insisted on coming over here and meeting whoever was home parent wise.&quot;<br />
&quot;How much of Moon Lake did you plan to show him?&quot; was her father&#39;s next question.<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll be walking from here to the high school and back for sure. John and his sister Janice won&#39;t be able to start school until sometime towards the end of the month at the earliest when all the legal formalities are finalized. He hasn&#39;t gotten out much since arriving here and wants to know the town better,&quot; explained Ginger.<br />
<br />
&quot;The poor guy is probably going stir crazy, being cooped up in the Jenkins house so much,&quot; guessed her brother.<br />
&quot;That&#39;s partly right, but John&#39;s smart and is looking forward to starting school again,&quot; added Ginger.<br />
&quot;Willingly?&quot; asked Fred in disbelief, which got a disapproving look from both of his parents.<br />
&quot;What&#39;s he like?&quot; Nelson asked Jeanette.<br />
&quot;Surprisingly nice. Polite. Even a bit shy and timid too,&quot; replied his wife, to which their daughter nodded in agreement.<br />
&quot;His parents may have been...&quot; began Ginger, pausing because she wasn&#39;t exactly sure how to explain it. &quot;His parents might not have been the ideal mother and father, but the Harper children are nothing like them.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well dear, it&#39;s not that we don&#39;t trust your judgement. It&#39;s just that we&#39;ve heard a lot about them since Jennifer was turned by that rogue were-vixen, and we&#39;d like to know the difference between fact and fiction,&quot; said her father.<br />
<br />
&quot;If anything, the kids are victims. I don&#39;t know all the details, but John&#39;s told me a lot about what he and his siblings have had to deal with, even before his father got that crazy idea to come here in hopes of stopping Jenny&#39;s wedding to Harry Jenkins because he promised her to that Wilhelm character,&quot; said Ginger, trying to defend her friend. &quot;She and Harry are arranging to have guardianship for John and his sister Janice, while their older brother is already an adult and can take care of himself.&quot;<br />
&quot;That is a lot of responsibility, especially for newlyweds,&quot; conceded her mother.<br />
&quot;True,&quot; agreed Nelson. &quot;But what both your mother and I are more concerned about is the fact that... well, you&#39;ve never really shown any real interest in any one particular boy before, let alone the fact that John Harper is still a normal.&quot;<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t understand,&quot; admitted their daughter.<br />
&quot;Do you know what John Harper&#39;s long term intentions are toward the town and were society?&quot; asked her father.<br />
&quot;John doesn&#39;t bear us any ill will because of what happened to Jenny, or anything bad towards weres, if that&#39;s what you&#39;re asking. He never even considered the concept of weres, let alone our actual existence before coming here, but John likes Moon Lake.&quot;<br />
&quot;What about his intentions toward you? What are yours toward him? Whether they intend to or not, some children of abusers do grow up to become abusers too, regardless of gender or species,&quot; said Jeanette O&#39;Toole.<br />
&quot;You met him. John&#39;s not like that,&quot; protested Ginger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe,&quot; agreed her mother, &quot;but it has been known to happen.&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve never heard that before. Are you sure?&quot; asked Ginger. &quot;John would never—&quot;<br />
&quot;Besides, except for Jenny, the rest of the Harpers are still normals,&quot; added her father, quickly changing the subject and not giving his wife a chance to respond. &quot;While I&#39;ve heard that she has since adjusted and is very happy as a were-vixen herself, does John, let alone any of the others, plan to join were society at some point?&quot;<br />
&quot;Once he&#39;s an official citizen of Moon Lake, John&#39;s open to the idea, but it&#39;s more a question of when, why, and what; not if with him,&quot; said Ginger confidently.<br />
&quot;That Janice keeps going on about wanting to be a were-mermaid when she&#39;s able to do so,&quot; quickly added Fred. &quot;But she won&#39;t be 14 and eligible until sometime next year.&quot;<br />
&quot;And John&#39;s told me that Jenny&#39;s hoping after they finish college next spring, her big brother and his fiance will move here too,&quot; said Ginger. &quot;Their parents are the only one&#39;s who don&#39;t know about us,&quot; she added, waving a furry paw in front of her weretiger family. &quot;But none of the kids ever want to see them again anyway.&quot;<br />
&quot;Besides, even if the father didn&#39;t have the heart problems I&#39;ve heard about, both him and their mother are too old now to risk joining,&quot; said Jeanette, thankful her husband changed the subject so she didn&#39;t have to reveal her painful past before they met, fell in love, and got married.<br />
&quot;But you never answered my question young lady,&quot; said Nelson O&#39;Toole, staring at his daughter. &quot;How do you feel about John Harper? Let alone how does he feel about you?&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>And mom never answered my question about how does she know victims might become abusers themselves,</i> recalled Ginger, but only said aloud, &quot;I like him. We&#39;re friends.&quot;<br />
&quot;And long term?&quot; wondered her father.<br />
Ginger O&#39;Toole returned his intense stare, but in the end couldn&#39;t lie to him. &quot;What I might hope for and what actually happens remain to be seen.&quot;<br />
&quot;You&#39;re not planning on ushering him into were society, are you?&quot; asked Nelson O&#39;Toole.<br />
&quot;Like I said. John isn&#39;t opposed to the idea of becoming a were, but when, why, and what are still undecided,&quot; was her only response, keeping her promise not to reveal the fact that John Harper was still confused and undecided as to whether he was straight, gay, or bi.<br />
&quot;Ginger, you do know everything involved with a normal becoming a were. Right?&quot; her mother wanted to know.<br />
&quot;Yes. I have no plans of ushering John Harper into were society myself, but if he asked, I wouldn&#39;t be opposed to the idea.&quot;<br />
&quot;That&#39;s the point. HE has to ask. That rogue vixen not only gave the Skulk a bad name, but all of were society in general,&quot; Jeanette reminded her.<br />
&quot;Mom, I promise both you and dad that I will not usher John Harper into were society without both his permission and letting you know first. Okay?&quot; asked Ginger.<br />
&quot;You have feelings for this boy, don&#39;t you?&quot; her mother wanted to know.<br />
Ginger wanted to say how she really felt about John Harper, but instead just reminded her parents, &quot;He&#39;s my friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both parents looked at each other, as if lost in thought.<br />
Ginger turned to look at her brother in hopes that he had any insight on the situation, but all Fred did was shrug his furry shoulders and continue eating his supper.<br />
Finally, her father turned back around and told Ginger, &quot;You can show the boy around Moon Lake Saturday.&quot;<br />
It was all Ginger could do to keep from expressing her joy over their decision.<br />
Then her mother added, &quot;We just want you to tread carefully. Especially when a normal is concerned. We know us weres have a different perspective on life than they do. Like how... open we are on some subjects,&quot; she added, while reaching out and taking her husband&#39;s paw in hers. &quot;We just don&#39;t want to see anyone get hurt.&quot;<br />
&quot;Especially you,&quot; added her father.<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry. I won&#39;t,&quot; promised Ginger.<br />
<i>I know what it&#39;s like to be young and possibly in love,</i> Jeanette thought, looking at her daughter. <i>I just don&#39;t want you to make the same mistakes I did.</i><br />
