<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You still couldn&#39;t believe what you had just done, you were Sam, Sam was you. You had complete control over the jock&#39;s body! Looking at the clock above the door leading back to the first floor hallway, you realized that Sam only had a few minutes left of his calculus class before hitting his favorite class of all time: Physical Education. <br />
<br />
PE was only required for freshman, but any student who wanted to take more advanced PE classes could through their senior year. Sam had signed up for a mix of weightlifting and PE each semester, flipping and back and forth between the two. He was currently taking PE this fall. <br />
<br />
You searched through Sam&#39;s memories to acquaint yourself with what you were getting into. Sam loved PE for three reasons: it was a way to work out and get sweaty, he was able to play games with his jock friends who also participated in PE, and the PE locker rooms overlapped with the freshman PE classes, so he and his fellow jocks usually got into the freshman&#39;s business at least once a week for a little ritualistic bullying. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm,&quot; you thought to yourself as you opened the door and worked your way back to Sam&#39;s class. &quot;I could have some fun with the freshman, or I could transform one of them, make them an uber-jock too, or I could help one of my football buddies get swole. Or maybe it would be time to possess someone else?&quot;<br />
<br />
The more the fantasies swirled around in your mind, the more you felt your dick harden with excitement. Walking back into calculus, you crossed the classroom while Sam&#39;s teacher continued talking over the day&#39;s lesson. You quietly sat and dreamed about what you might do next. Part of you just wanted to soak in the power of the ring immediately and explode into &quot;god mode&quot; that would totally enrapture the class. Part of you wanted to seduce some of your better-looking classmates, like Tina, the drama starlet who&#39;s bright blue eyes and crisp blonde hair made every guy hot, or your old jock buddy Jack, the most self-centered, self-proud and self-assertive man that you knew. The very fact that he was such an asshole to everyone but only the most athletic of jocks made you horny for him.<br />
<br />
The bell let out its loud ring as the students started packing their things. You threw Sam&#39;s books into his bag and worked your way back to his locker. You knew the combo as well as you knew your own and turned the knob. You dropped your books in and grabbed Sam&#39;s gym bag. It smelled sweaty, had the distinct jock smell that you knew Sam created after a hard workout. <br />
<br />
You threw the bag over your shoulder as you felt a shove and a head enter your field of vision. It was Oliver, your Italian buddy and champion tight end on the football team. He was going to State next year and just finished all the recruiting wine and dine over the past few months. Every big school wanted him to start as a true freshman and he was one of the favorites for you to throw to whenever you played QB on the team. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sup, bro!&quot; He said. &quot;Coach said today&#39;s sessions in PE are gonna be weights. I&#39;m gonna target thighs, gotta get those turns in place for receiving on Friday!&quot; Oliver mimicked a surfing kind of move as you moved through the hallway and toward the athletic corridor. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sweet,&quot; you said, trying your best to script out whatever Sam would have said to a fellow football bro, &quot;Chest and arms for me. I have a feeling Tom isn&#39;t going to be able to throw on Friday, so coach might be putting me in as backup QB again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Duuuude,&quot; Oliver said, hopping with energy, &quot;you fuckin dominated Central High last week while Tom was out. He&#39;s a great player, don&#39;t get me wrong, but I don&#39;t have a problem with you filling in for him. We&#39;re on track for an undefeated domination!&quot; <br />
<br />
You realized as you walked through the hall that all the students around you and Oliver looked at you differently. With respect, even with a little fear. You smirked. Sam definitely lived the good life, and you were enjoying it too. Relishing in it. It felt fuckin&#39; good to be king of the school. <br />
<br />
But your thoughts quickly went back to the small brass band that wrapped around your index finger. It gave you this body, and you felt it aching to give you so much more. You had the power of the gods awaiting to grant you any wish, any command that you could imagine, and you couldn&#39;t wait to use it. <br />
<br />
Oliver smacked your left shoulder to suggest that you step in front of him and lead through the narrow corridor and staircase down to the &quot;Phys Ed - Men&quot; locker room as the old plastic sign had inscribed. You kept your steps light as you gave a small jog down the staircase. The senior PE class was small, just a handful of committed jocks from a couple of varsity teams: Sam along with some buddies on the football team, as well as two guys on the weightlifting team, four guys on the hockey team, and four guys on the track and field team. All of them were accomplished athletes in their senior year and had all become good friends over the years, both in class and outside of class during their various summer athletic camps. <br />
<br />
Strutting yourself down to the rows of lockers underneath the gym, you saw the usual slew of Sam&#39;s jock classmates in various states of undress, some giving you a head&#39;s up nod to acknowledge your presence. You threw Sam&#39;s gym bag on the nearby bench as you opened Sam&#39;s locker. Opening the bag, you found a pair of black compression shorts, Sam&#39;s high school football Champion brand gym shorts, a couple of used and stinky t-shirts and a couple pairs of ankle socks. In Sam&#39;s locker were an older pair of running shoes that he used for PE. <br />
<br />
You slipped out of your hoodie and t-shirt in one swoop and took a moment to acknowledge Sam&#39;s body - your body that you had just inherited. Sam had a slightly golden brown tint to his skin. Hair was just starting to fuzz over his pecs, but a thicker treasure trail started thinly at his six pack and forested up over his belly button and underneath his waist, where his jeans still covered. You quickly unbuckle his belt and push down the jeans. Sam sported a tight pair of dark grey boxer briefs. This dick that you now owned was about twice as large even in its flaccid state as yours. Sitting squarely behind it two bulged balls pushed against the dick making for a nice contour against the briefs. Sam&#39;s legs were finely tuned, thick bulbous layers of muscle ran down his thighs and to his calves. Dark brown hair covered each of them like a forest. <br />
<br />
You turned your head as you heard the freshman class walk into their aisle of lockers a few rows down. Even though the classes were in separate gyms, they had to share the lockers with the advanced PE class whenever there was an overlap. <br />
<br />
Oliver gave you a head&#39;s up, &quot;Yo Sam, I dare ya you can&#39;t throw my used jockstrap over one of the frosh&#39;s heads!&quot; Oliver said chuckling as he pulled out a black jockstrap from his bag. <br />
<br />
You chuckle, turning your head, you see a couple of the other football bros in nearby lockers snicker and egg you on to do it. <br />
<br />
The ring heats up on your finger. Lots of options to have some fun in the locker room. What do want to do now?</p>
