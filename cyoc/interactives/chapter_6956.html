<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dr. Greg Pilsner was staring into his microscope with intent.  The small slide at which he was looking contained his work for the night.  He smiled at what he saw.  The last few hours he had spent mixing and combining had achieved the results he desired.  He stood up straight and pulled his voice recorder out of his lab coat pocket.  &quot;Step 1 a success.  Cells show hypothesized change.  Begin step 2 promptly.&quot;  He put the small recorder down on the counter next to his microscope.  He replaced his goggles and turned back to the sink where he was mixing various liquids.  Suddenly, the buzzer of the lab's main entrance went off.  &quot;Who could that be?&quot; he said aloud.  Thinking to himself, he found that it was odd Ray hadn't called.  Even when only he had to come to the lab for some reason, Ray always notified he was coming first.<br />
<br />
Greg walked to the door of the small laboratory.  This wasn't the main lab that was used.  It was a kind of small, more secluded lab.  Most of the work that went on in this lab was not official work of any kind.  It was for various side projects the scientists worked on.  Greg's experiment of this night was one such side project.  Greg went to the door and opened it.  He was immensely surprised by what greeted him there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tabitha!&quot; he exclaimed with surprise.  &quot;What are you doing here?&quot;  He immediately recognized the differences in her appearance.  He was afraid to say anything about it, however.  He didn't want to upset her and risk her telling Rick, putting their professional relationship in jeopardy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, Greg,&quot; she cooed while walking into the lab.  Ricki and Brenda followed in behind her.  &quot;I came over here to give you a message from Rick.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, OK,&quot; he said with obvious confusion in his voice and his expression.  &quot;Why didn't he just call?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He's a little...unavailable right now,&quot; Tabitha reasoned.  &quot;But he wanted to let you know that the two formulas he was working on at home were both a success.&quot;<br />
<br />
The look on Greg's face brightened.  &quot;That's marvelous!&quot; he said.  &quot;This will ensure that our work will be successful.&quot;  Ricki and Brenda smiled, taking pleasure at Greg's ignorance of the &quot;success.&quot;  &quot;Did he say anything else about what happened?&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Since you seem so eager to know, Greg, I'll tell you what else he said,&quot; Tabitha said.  Inside her mind she was laughing hysterically.  &quot;He said that he accidentally mixed some of the liquid together, and it produced an interesting side effect.&quot;<br />
<br />
Greg looked worried now.  &quot;Side effect?  What kind of side effect?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A pink smoke,&quot; Tabitha said.  She reached inside her purse and pulled out the Flits can.  She held it out in front of her so that he could see the evidence of Rick's work.  <br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell?&quot; Greg asked, reaching for the can.  Tabitha wouldn't let him touch it, however.  &quot;How?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know,&quot; Tabitha shrugged.  &quot;Maybe you should ask Rick.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will,&quot; Greg said, walking a few feet to the telephone.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't need to call him,&quot; Tabitha said.<br />
<br />
Greg looked puzzled.  &quot;Why not?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I'm right here,&quot; Ricki said.<br />
<br />
Greg took several steps backward.  He blinked repeatedly in obvious disbelief.  &quot;You are certainly not Rick,&quot; he said.  &quot;You're not even the same sex!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, duh,&quot; Ricki laughed, walking directly in front of Greg.  &quot;That's because there was a side effect of that smoke.  It transformed me from your colleague into this beautiful, buxom figure you see before you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't believe you for one minute,&quot; Greg said with confidence.<br />
<br />
Ricki exhaled and shrugged her shoulders.  &quot;I guess we're just going to have to prove it then.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Tabitha tossed the can into Ricki's awaiting hands.  Greg was too slow to react.  As soon as Ricki caught the can, she sprayed a huge amount directly into Greg's face.  He started to cough uncontrollably.  Almost instantly, his coughs became higher pitched.  &quot;Sorry about this, Greg,&quot; Ricki said.  &quot;We wanted to do it the easy way, but you didn't.  Suffer the consequences.&quot;<br />
<br />
Greg's coughing continued without slowing.  He staggered forward, his face emerging from the smoke.  His face had already transformed.  His black hair was growing down the sides of his face due to his head being cocked forward.  Between the coughs, he was able to say, &quot;What...have...you...done?&quot;  His voice had also completely changed to a feminine voice.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Showing you the truth,&quot; Ricki said.  Her voice was a little cold.  <br />
<br />
Greg's face now looked stunningly gorgeous.  As with the other three, there was not one wrinkle or blemish to be found.  His lips were full and red, his cheeks were soft and rounded, and his nose was narrow and petite.  His Adam's apple was no longer visible.  The length of his hair was now extending all the way down to the middle of his chest.  It was growing longer than that of the other three women.<br />
<br />
Greg took a few more steps, and in the process, his feet lifted out of his shoes.  They had shrunk several sizes.  Even his socks simply slipped from his feet.  His toenails were painted purple, which was different than the others.<br />
<br />
Greg's pants fell to the floor as he was finally able to brace himself up against a counter.  His boxers followed them down, due to the contraction of his waist.  Greg had been a little wide, a size 34 to be exact.  But his waist had lost a good 8-10 inches in the last few seconds.  His breathed in sharply, gasping for air.  His shirt also looked baggier around the middle, leading to the conclusion that his stomach and chest were also contracting.  <br />
<br />
His hips ballooned out, causing him to groan with more agony.  &quot;It burns,&quot; he said.  He had stopped coughing when his waist narrowed, probably because he could barely breathe at the time.  It did not resume now, however, which was probably also for the best.  <br />
<br />
His legs and arms had already thinned.  They did add small muscles, though, something that Greg did not have before.  His fingernails had lengthened, and his hands and fingers had grown smaller.  There seemed to be very few changes left to take place.  In fact, his change was happening much quicker than Ricki's or Brenda's. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now what?&quot; Greg shouted out.  &quot;It's too tight.&quot;  The three women did not have to ask what he meant, for they could plainly see what he meant.  His breasts were growing, straining through his cotton shirt.  The buttons started to pop off in every direction.  His expanding nipples ripped through the shirt before every button shot off.  His new breasts grew quickly, forming perfect mounds of flesh on his chest.  They stopped growing at D cups, just like Brenda and Ricki, but his nipples and areolas grew larger than those of the other two women did.<br />
<br />
The now almost totally female Greg doubled over in a combination of pain and exhaustion.  Only his lab coat still clung to his body.  He shook it off his shoulders, leaving himself in the nude.  His penis and testicles were the only things that had not yet changed.  They had shrunk considerably, but were still present.  &quot;Oh, God,&quot; he muttered while he closed his eyes.  His genitals began their final push into his body.  <br />
<br />
In the blink of an eye, his testicles deflated, separated, and pulled back onto his body on either side of his decaying cock.  They formed his vaginal lips while his penis pulled steadily inwards.  &quot;Oh, God,&quot; he moaned.  This time he lamented in pleasure rather than agony.  A smile developed on his face and he looked like he was about to have an orgasm.  His pubic hair retracted into his body completely, leaving him totally without any kind of hair other than that on his head.  His once proud penis shrank into his body and rearranged itself internally to form his clitoris.  &quot;Aahhh!&quot; he screamed as he climaxed.  The rapidity of the change had been too much for him.  Fluids quickly ran down his leg.  Ricki noticed and reached into a drawer to pull out a towel.  <br />
<br />
Greg fell onto the floor, completely overcome by the changes.  He kept moaning, &quot;Oh, my God,&quot; as Ricki crept closer to him.  He opened his eyes and saw Ricki standing over him.  She dropped the towel onto his impressive chest and said, &quot;You'll want to clean yourself up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Greg sat up and did what Ricki suggested.  &quot;You were right, Rick,&quot; he said as he wiped up the evidence of his orgasm.  &quot;But why?&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;First of all, call me Ricki,&quot; she demanded.  &quot;I'm not Rick anymore.&quot;  She answered his question next.  &quot;If you mean why did the smoke cause this effect, I still don't know.  I'm hoping we can figure that out together.  As for why did we come and change you, what I just said is one reason.  Another is because you're the person that's here.  Another reason, which Tabitha just told me, will have to wait for later.&quot;<br />
<br />
Greg stood up to face his formerly male colleague.  &quot;I don't know what to say,&quot; he said.  &quot;Can you change back?&quot; he asked with concern.<br />
<br />
&quot;No way that I know of,&quot; Ricki admitted.  &quot;Nor do I want to.  I'll be honest, I don't think that I ever will.  This body feels too good.  You know what I mean.&quot;  Greg looked down at his feet in shame.  &quot;Don't be ashamed.  I wasn't.  Neither was Brenda.&quot;<br />
<br />
The mention of Brenda's name brought Greg's face back up from the ground.  &quot;Brenda?&quot; he asked, staring intently at her face.  &quot;That was Brendon?&quot; he asked with a great deal of shock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure was,&quot; Brenda answered.  &quot;Right after Ricki seduced me into having sex with her, this is what happened to me.&quot;  Greg still looked at her in shock.  &quot;And she's right.  I don't want to change back either.&quot;<br />
<br />
Greg shook his head in disbelief.  &quot;I never would have thought you and Brendon would agree on anything,&quot; he said to Ricki.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you want to be technical, we still don't.  As far as we're concerned, we're completely different people.  Tabitha, too,&quot; Ricki explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;So that's why you look...altered,&quot; Greg said carefully.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yea I know it must have been a shock to see me so 'enhanced,' I guess,&quot; Tabitha said.  &quot;These two seduced me, and after we all had sex, I changed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, let me get this straight,&quot; Greg said, his scientific mind taking stride.  &quot;You,&quot; he said pointing at Ricki, &quot;and me, too, changed because of that smoke.  You two changed after sex.  It's like a virus.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But a good one,&quot; Ricki said.  &quot;Any way you look at it, at least as far as I care, it solved the problems in our house.  That's what we intend to do with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do what?&quot; Greg asked suspiciously.</p>
