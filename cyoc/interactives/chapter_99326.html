<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dustin, as the sheep-man Ashauna, awoke to the feeling of something large swelling and stretching his asshole.  He realized that Horace was still penetrating him.  He languished in the feeling, moaning and stroking his cock, which grew erect again quickly.  He clenched down, and pushed against the large cock, loving the feeling.<br />
<br />
This roused the bison-man, who grumbled &quot;Mmmm, what a way to wake up...!  Want me to fill you up again?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... yes!&quot; moaned Ashauna.  &quot;Fill me again!  Stuff me so full and spill all your seed into my ass!  I love it!&quot;<br />
<br />
The bison-man complied, and as they were laying on their sides, he began thrusting his enormous cock in and out into Ashauna&#39;s ass.  The two anthro-men moaned and bellowed as their pleasure mounted.  Horace twisted onto his back and turned Ashauna so the sheep-man was straddling him and facing him.  The enormous cock continued thrusting and buried itself to the base as Ashauna rode it.  Finally Horace whispered, &quot;I&#39;m going to come inside your sheep ass!&quot;<br />
<br />
And he did, and cum spewed forth once again into Ashauna&#39;s bowels.  Ashauna cried out and began cumming as well, spraying it all up into the air and it rained down upon them, splattering everywhere.<br />
<br />
Cum leaked out from Ashauna&#39;s ass, coating Horace&#39;s shaft.  Cum also leaked from his mouth, having shot its way all the way through his system.  He made out with Horace, sharing the taste of the cum eagerly.<br />
<br />
Finally, for the first time in hours, Horace withdrew his cock from Ashuana&#39;s ass.  In the mirror Ashauna watched as he saw his stretched out hole spilling cum out of it like a faucet.  He loved the warm feeling of the cum coursing through and out of his body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s get cleaned up.  I have to meet my wife at the airport in a little while,&quot; said Horace.<br />
<br />
Dismayed, yet still satisfied, the two lovers cleaned up in the showers, put their clothes back on, and headed back out to the front.  Ashauna&#39;s butthole continued leaking cum the entire time, though by the time he was dressed it had ebbed to a slow drip which kept his underwear pleasurably wet as if he had a wet man-gina.  Horace kissed Ashauna good-bye, then headed out.<br />
<br />
Ashauna heard a whistle from a nearby table.  He turned to see a cat-man who said &quot;I don&#39;t know how you got lucky enough to have HIM, a lot of us have been trying for months with no success... how&#39;d you do it?  And how was it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ashauna politely answered.  &quot;I just caught him in a horny mood.  I guess it was luck and I was available and talking to him.  It was the most amazing sex I&#39;ve ever had!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll bet, &quot; returned the cat-man.  &quot;My name&#39;s Chase.  I&#39;m waiting here for a few buddies.  We were planning on having a threesome, but I wouldn&#39;t mind making it a foursome, if you&#39;d like.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s generous,&quot; Ashauna replied.  &quot;I may take you up on that.  But while we wait, can I ask you something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, shoot,&quot; Chase responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you as a human?  And how is being an anthro different?&quot; Ashauna asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;s usually considered rude to ask an anthro about their human life, so be careful with questions like that.,&quot; said Chase.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t know that,&quot; said Ashauna.  &quot;This is my first time, and I&#39;ve been trying to learn those answers for myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chase spoke in a relaxed tone.  &quot;It&#39;s perfectly okay.  I don&#39;t mind talking about it.  To be honest in my human life I&#39;m a pretty average guy.  I have a wife and a kid and a normal job.  The biggest difference for me is as a cat-man I&#39;m as gay as they come, and I love being on bottom.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do too,&quot; Ashauna said, smiling shyly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can tell,&quot; said the cat-man.  &quot;I saw the tell-tale wetness of your man-gina, and most anthros can smell it pretty clearly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... I didn&#39;t realize...&quot; Ashauna stuttered.  &quot;So... you, uh, are straight as a human?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes,&quot; Chase continued.  &quot;My wife and I are straight as an arrow.  In fact, we were both against any sort of alternate sexualities or gender identities.  We were a bigoted couple of people and a lot of people hated us for it.  In fact, we were miserable because of it, though we didn&#39;t realize it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That changed, obviously,&quot; Ashauna observed.<br />
<br />
Chase went on.  &quot;Yes it did.  We got it in our head to try out anthropomorphing, and as the fates would have it, we both ended up in gay morphs.  For a while we both shut down and tried to deny our urges, but before the night was out, we had both succumbed to our urges.  The next morning we talked about it.  We felt ashamed for doing what we felt was wrong, but as we talked it out, we both realized that we had enjoyed it.  Both of us had returned to being straight of course, and we acted on it, having the best sex we&#39;d had in a while.  But both of us also had a new perspective, that when we were gay anthropomorphs it felt as right and normal as it did when we were straight humans.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We were lucky,&quot; Chase continued.  &quot;We both learned what fools we&#39;d been, and were able to change our attitudes.  We&#39;ve since established that every Wednesday, and sometimes more often, we&#39;d come change into an anthropomorph and have gay sex with someone else.  We experimented with morphs at first, finding favorites.  We&#39;d always experiment one at a time, so just in case we got a straight morph, we&#39;d scrap the gay idea that night and go at it as a straight human and anthro.  But anytime we got a bi or gay morph, we&#39;d go have some fun, and enrich our human lives in the process.  By now we&#39;ve settled on some favorite morph choices and those are the ones we use.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So that&#39;s who we are,&quot; Chase was coming to a close.  &quot;We are straight humans who become gay anthropomorphs every Wednesday.  My wife calls it &quot;hump-day&quot;.  That&#39;s her over there.&quot;  Chase indicated to a camel-girl who was sitting with a cow-girl and a lynx-girl.  &quot;Looks like she&#39;s going to have as good a time tonight as I will, and I&#39;m happy for her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So...&quot; Ashauna said.  &quot;You both don&#39;t mind being gay at all?  What if you were gay as a human?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that could possibly be bad for our marriage,&quot; Chase answered.  &quot;But more likely me and my wife would find a way to make the alternate sexuality work.  She might look for a transgender morph, or I might if my wife was gay.  We might even consider a sex-change as a human, though it would have to feel right for the one transitioning.  Gender can be fluid, but it&#39;s not something that can be forced.  You are what you feel you are.  My wife and I are very close, so we&#39;d try our best to find a way to stay together.  We wouldn&#39;t let something silly like sexuality or gender come between us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And if I&#39;d never met my wife...&quot; Chase contemplated.  &quot;I&#39;d just end up with another guy, and it would feel as right and normal as it does now, as a gay cat-man.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Remarkable,&quot; said Ashauna.  &quot;I&#39;m glad you and your wife are so close.  You&#39;ve also given me more to think about.  You see, I think I&#39;m gay as a human, but I&#39;m not sure, and my feelings have come on quickly.  I wanted to try out being gay as a sheep-man, and I&#39;ve found I like it a lot.  But based on what I&#39;ve been hearing, being gay as a sheep-man wouldn&#39;t affect my human self at all... is that right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You are right,&quot; Chase answered.  &quot;Your current self has no bearing on your human self.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What it has done for me though,&quot; Ashauna continued, &quot;is make me realize that acting on my mind&#39;s true desires feels normal and right.  If it feels right as a gay sheep-man, it will feel right as a gay human.  Thank you for talking to me about this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My pleasure,&quot; said Chase.  &quot;It sounds like you&#39;ve been suppressing your gay thoughts for a long time.  If you grew up in a stringent household, as I did, then it&#39;s no surprise that you have.  But no matter what, you have to be honest with yourself.  Be open-minded and listen to your own desires.  By doing so, you may discover things you never knew about yourself.  One of my wife&#39;s lovers learned after she started going on lesbian anthro dates that as a human she likes dressing as a man and wearing a strap-on, yet still prefers being a woman.  This discovery came because going anthro taught her to open her mind.  Her husband learned that he enjoys his wife even more that way, now that she is expressing her desires without fear or hesitation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll keep that in mind as well,&quot; said Ashauna.  Then he said &quot;One more question, but not on the same subject...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, go ahead,&quot; said Chase, kindly.<br />
<br />
&quot;How does the process of returning to human work?&quot; Ashauna asked.  &quot;Remember this is my first time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chase answered, &quot;If you are within 8 hours of the maximum time, and you sleep for at least 3 hours, the morph will reverse itself.  Otherwise, when the maximum time is reached you&#39;ll pass out for an hour and wake up a human again.  If you drink a changing coffee the time will reset based on the most recent one drank.  You can only do this if it&#39;s the same morph.  For new morphs you have to wait for your current one to run out.  There are rumors that they are working on creating an antidote to change back instantly, but i hasn&#39;t hit the markets yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, good to know,&quot; responded Ashauna.<br />
<br />
Just then a horse-man and a bear-man sat down at their table.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, here are my friends,&quot; Chase said happily.  &quot;The horse is called Forte and the bear is Pete.  They are here for our little orgy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ashauna&#39;s member grew hard at the sight of their huge muscles and enormous veined cocks.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve brought a friend for us I see,&quot; said Pete.  &quot;And oh he is adorable.  I&#39;ll love taking that cute sheep ass!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll love it even more!&quot; exclaimed Ashauna.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oooh!  Wonderful!&quot; boomed Forte.  &quot;I love it when they are sluts!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll all be bathing in cum so long as you have this sheep-slut milking your delicious cocks!&quot; Ashauna said sultrily.  He was getting good at this gay anthropomorph thing and he was really getting into it and enjoying it.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s enough teasing,&quot; Chase sighed.  &quot;Let&#39;s head on back and get this started...&quot;<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
Several hours later Ashauna was back at his parents&#39; house.  It was after midnight and he tiptoed up the stairs and into his room, hooves making a faint tapping noise despite his efforts to move silently.  &quot;Phew&quot; he though as he entered his room and eased the door shut softly.  He really didn&#39;t want to be caught as he was.  His underwear was soaked with cum from his man-gina, and his cock was incessantly hard.  The taste of cum filled his mouth and he burped every so often, bringing more cum up that Ashauna savored before swallowing it back down.<br />
<br />
He stripped off his clothes and went to bed naked.  He hoped his cum-filled body would return to human form cum-free, but he wasn&#39;t sure if that was how it worked.  Sleep came quickly, and he dreamed of being fucked by large anthropomorphs.  The difference was, in his dreams, he was being fucked as human Dustin.  He came into his sheets multiple times over the night...</p>
