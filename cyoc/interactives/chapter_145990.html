<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Thoughts back in order, you approached the lonesome two who had woken up before you.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s up guys?&quot; You said, as you shoved open the sliding door towards the back garden.<br />
<br />
Their faces turned. You were slightly taken aback at the sight.<br />
<br />
There sat a guy, slightly hunched over, with two breasts hanging underneath his shirt, cleavage straining its hem. His arms were way too slender for a guy who looked so muscular from behind. And now still, he sported a six pack and had some crazy leg muscles below his torso. He was one of those typical jocks you met at least once at every party.<br />
<br />
He was hunched over that way because his breasts were absolutely massive, and his back, as muscular as it was, couldn&#39;t properly hold the sudden strain. He had probably not trained the correct muscles for that. The sight was really weird, amusing all the same.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yo Mattster,&quot; a feminine voice called from next to the jock. It was from the person seated next to him. &quot;How was the trip?&quot;<br />
<br />
You were a bit taken aback at the sudden call of your nickname.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do I know you?&quot; You asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;All your life dude.&quot; The... girl said with a high soprano. She had a wide grin on her attractive face.<br />
<br />
No, wait. Her face didn&#39;t add up.<br />
<br />
Rubbing your head again, hoping to get rid of the headache, but to no avail, you took a closer look at the sight before you.<br />
<br />
Not a girl.<br />
<br />
Except for the face.<br />
<br />
What you saw in front of you was the body of a dude, but the face of a chick. The... tomboy stood up, and you found that he was the same height as yours. Checking his body out, you saw it was fit. Definitely a guy&#39;s, you could see it from the bulge in the swim trunks he was wearing. He had no shirt on, and no breasts were visible.<br />
<br />
His face was a different story. You gawked at it. It was perfectly symmetrical, and wore a wide grin with pearl-white teeth. She... He had a small Greek nose, and her eyes were hazel in color. Their hair was all bright blonde curls, almost a female variant of-<br />
<br />
&quot;Gareth! Holy shit!&quot; You exclaimed. You winced as your own outcries mixed with the splitting migraine you were suffering from.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right?!&quot; He said with a high soprano unlike the voice he used to have.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your face is a girl&#39;s.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A chick&#39;s,&quot; Gareth corrected.<br />
<br />
You looked over at the jock-with-breasts, then checked out the people who were still sprawled everywhere on the floor.<br />
<br />
One chick was buck-naked, and looked to be awake, or waking, as you could see what was clearly a morning wood developing in her crotch. Another guy had the plumpest lips you had ever seen, as well as big eye lashes and a mess of long, curly hair. The boobs of one girl had disappeared, and been substituted by large pecks, muscular like a man&#39;s. She must have worked out for some time already, before the change.<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;ve all taken that party drug, haven&#39;t they?&quot; You asked.<br />
<br />
The party drug -the party community called it Chance- was a drug originally produced by a large pharmaceutical company called OppoSex. It was meant as a way to turn people into the other sex, developed after a breakthrough on the study of Transgenderism and its relations to the biological sex. Before, it was only meant to be used by people who wanted a sex change. The pills were expensive, and its changes were only temporary, without clarity about how long each pill lasted.<br />
<br />
Pills that hadn&#39;t completely made it through the production process, were rejected and then &#39;disposed of&#39;, but really, in some way or form, it managed to enter the black market as a drug that could make people feel amazing for some time, and a fetish feast for the people interested.<br />
<br />
Party-goers were in for the sensations, not the transformations. But, as it was all only temporary, it didn&#39;t really matter too much.<br />
<br />
&quot;They have, and you too, I see&quot; Gareth said. He started walking towards the house, past you. &quot;I gotta find the toilet in this house, hope it isn&#39;t &#39;occupied&#39; ifyouknowhatimean.&quot; Upon passing you, he smacked you in the ass, hard.<br />
<br />
Looking down, you realized why.<br />
<br />
You ran past him in a hurry. &quot;Not if I find it first,&quot; you shouted back at him.<br />
<br />
_____<br />
<br />
Even on the second floor, it was a mess. The party-goers had absolutely thrashed Joe&#39;s house. You guessed he wouldn&#39;t do that again anytime soon. For a summer pool party though, this had been amazing.<br />
<br />
You realized quickly though, that you hadn&#39;t thought things through, when you took one of those OppoSex pills.<br />
<br />
The rejects had the nice sensations yes, but they still transformed people, although it was never certain where, and to what extent, or for how long.<br />
<br />
Looking down at yourself, you hoped the changes would disappear quickly.<br />
<br />
Below the belt, everything looked to have changes.<br />
<br />
The first thing you had seen were your feet and toes. Smaller, less hair, incredibly feminine. Not a patch of roughness to be spotted.<br />
<br />
Going up a little further, you found that your legs still had some hair on them, but their color was much less prominent, marking them as practically invisible. Your calves had grown smaller slightly, but as the transformation had reached your thighs, you found that they had expanded substantially, becoming thick like a chick&#39;s.<br />
<br />
The expanded skin had spread up your ass too. Looking behind you, you found that it had grown into a nice cushion begging to be smacked during a round of passionate rough-<br />
<br />
What were you thinking?<br />
<br />
You just imagined yourself as the fucking girl, no, as the fucked girl.<br />
<br />
A wet patch formed between your legs. The last part of your transformation. Your crotch.<br />
<br />
Stepping out of your summer cargo shorts, then you boxers, you spotted a neat, hairless pussy, soaking in juices, and you remembered the absolutely crazy drunk sensations from last night.<br />
<br />
You sat your large soft ass onto the toilet bowl, pulled your shorts down to your feet, and spread your beautiful new legs.<br />
<br />
You saw the gaping hole, the sticky juices around it, the prickly crotch hairs starting to sprout through your otherwise clean skin, and the minuscule clit hidden between the lips of your new woman parts.<br />
<br />
You brought a finger to it, and felt the sensations you had always wanted to feel, the ones you were always so curious about, because you always heard the beautiful moans of your sexual partners, but never knew what they actually experienced.<br />
<br />
Pleasure shot through your nerves, sensations almost too much, unlike anything you felt before. They ran up your spine, and entered the aroused parts of your brain, influenced by new hormones, yearning for more, whatever you could give yourself.<br />
<br />
Your rubbed the area around it, circling the small nub, and the pleasure built.<br />
<br />
Without feminine breasts and nipples needing any attention, you could focus your other hand on other things. It reached down into your newly formed glory hole, and started pumping in and out, squishing and squelching noises sounding every time you entered your pussy with another thrust. You shuddered as your breathing became ragged, pleasure building.<br />
<br />
Your face twisted into a mix of frustration and bliss.<br />
<br />
The pace of your heart-rate quickened, you pumped more and more, faster and faster, deeper and deeper. Your hand rubbed around your clit, then pinched it, hard.<br />
<br />
You closed your legs in a sudden jerk of the muscles, feeling how pleasure rocketed into your brain, and how the muscles within you lower belly spasmed in sheer sensation. The feeling built all over your body. Your arms convulsed against your torso, your breathing came in gasps, your legs closed, and opened, then closed again, in a cycle that seemed to last forever. Your toes curled until they cramped.<br />
<br />
Juices from your new snatch jetted into the toilet bowl, clattering against the metallic surface in loud, violent spurts. When it was finally over, you just sat there, hoping you could keep these parts just a little longer.</p>
