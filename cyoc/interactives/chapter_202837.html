<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I... still don&#39;t believe any of this.&quot; Jake said, &quot;People can&#39;t just change like that!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;d say you&#39;re looking at living proof right now!&quot; Alice replied, &quot;C&#39;mon, I&#39;ll show you first hand what it&#39;s like, I promise you won&#39;t hate it. And if you do... then I&#39;ll buy your lunch tomorrow.&quot; She said as she put her hands on Jake&#39;s shoulders and attempted to pull him out of her employers office. Even still, it seemed as though Alice was struggling a great deal to move Jake even an inch. <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not going to work... but fine. If it will get you to shut up.&quot; He replied turning around and flicking Alice on her puffed out nose.<br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon then! Follow me.&quot; Alice replied in a coy manner, leading Jake down the hall. Just next door was a plaque with a very classily written &quot;dressing&quot; on it. &quot;After you...&quot; Alice gestured to the door. <br />
<br />
Jake entered the room only to discover it was no more than a cubical in size. Sure there were some lockers on one of the walls, but the only truly notable thing about this room was the air hose dangling from the center of the ceiling. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey.&quot; Alice called from behind him, &quot;You&#39;re going to be needing this.&quot; She said as he tossed him the pair of ears which her boss had just unveiled earlier. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... thanks.&quot; Was all Jake was able to say.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know what to do, yes?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I think so.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll see you on the other side then!&quot; Alice said before shutting the door on Jake, leaving him alone with his thoughts and the reflection of himself in a mirror that was on the backside of the door. <br />
<br />
Now Jake found himself in the same situation he had just seen his best friend go through. He was staring down the barrel of a gun, though this gun looked more like a pair of chocolate coloured rubbery cat ears and an air compressor dangling from the ceiling. He had to admit, he was curious how this all worked. But he was equally terrified. If this thing should work, it would see him turn into an inflatable cat girl. None of those words sounded particularly appealing to Jake. But at the same time, that shouldn&#39;t be possible. It disobeyed every law of physics and reality he had come to know. There was that. There was also Alice&#39;s promise. She said that he would enjoy it. And that if he didn&#39;t there would be a free meal in it. Free sounded nice. Anything sounds nice to someone as desperate for a job as Jake was. But was he this desperate? <br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing risked, nothing earned.&quot; he thought to himself.<br />
<br />
Jake cautiously adjusted the cat ears on his and quickly before opened the valve sporting one of the ears. Nothing yet. It had only taken Alice a few seconds or so to change right before his eyes. Perhaps it would be best to close his and wait out the change. But an even bigger urge in him was telling him to relish in the change and try to decipher what exactly he had seen transpire earlier. <br />
<br />
Hand shaking, he reached up for the air compressor. He fidgeted with it&#39;s plastic end as he tried to get the nozzle of the ears to line up. Eventually a soft *click* was heard, and Jake realized that all he would have to do is press down on the valve. And then a few seconds later, he would be different. <br />
<br />
Jake probably spent more time idling about his decision than it would have taken him to just change right then and there. But sure enough, the desire for answers got the best of him and his hand jammed down on the air compressor. <br />
<br />
It immediately felt like he had been placed in the middle of the world&#39;s strongest air tunnel. Only instead of blowing on his skin, it felt like his insides were being blasted by a continuous gust of rushing wind. The initial gust caused him to quickly jolt back and clinch his eyes shut. Upon reopening them, nothing looked different. That was at least until his vision seemed to shift suddenly. It was as if any imperfections he had with his sight automatically corrected himself. His field of view widened and his sense of colour improved drastically, as if the saturation of the whole world had been turned up to eleven. <br />
<br />
Jake quickly put a hand up to his face, trying to feel around for any changes. He physically cringed when his normal hands came into contact with what felt like slick plastic. Weirder still; he didn&#39;t just feel the plastic on his hands, he could feel his hands from the plastic too. The fear of Alice being right had planted its seed in Jake&#39;s head, which by now he hadn&#39;t realized had been reduced to a hollow latex shell. The thought of that was quickly interrupted by the sight of Jake&#39;s hands and torso.<br />
<br />
He watched as the wave of latex crawl up his arms, only to leave his skin hair and blemish free and ending with the same puffy inflatable white gloves he had seen on Alice. His chest, quite literally, ballooned outward with a sudden rush of air. His shirt had been overtaken by a black sheen, now with two orbs sticking out from the top. Each one crisscrossed with a set of stitching seams, eerily similar to the ones seen on inflatable toys. <br />
<br />
Jake couldn&#39;t see what was occurring beneath the now-obstructed view of his new breasts. But he could feel it. He felt a bloating in his waist, and eventually when the bell of his new maid dress had formed he had put two and two together. Just like Alice before, his new &quot;dress&quot;, which felt all the more part of him as his arms or head, began sporting all of the same maid flare, including the faux inflatable &quot;frills&quot;, the print on apron, even something he hadn&#39;t taken notice on Alice earlier; a warning label. &quot;CAUTION! Café staff members are not lifesaving devices. In the event of an emergency use a safety-rated floatation device...&quot; The warning continued down the text box only to eventually repeat itself in Spanish and Japanese. The last language seeming very fitting for the line of work he might find himself in.<br />
<br />
Now, with his view even more obstructed by the curve of his skirt, Jake could only guess what was going on bellow his waist. The cool rush of air he felt in his legs and the slight squeaking noise he heard with each twitch of his thighs seemed to key him in to what was happening. Kicking one of his legs forward, Jake could see the same black inflated boot he saw on Alice earlier, as well as the insinuation of white stockings. Seams ran up and down the sides of his newly transformed legs. Transformed... Jake mused on that word for a half a second, he knew deep down in the pit of his now nonexistent stomach that not only was he changed, but his whole world. This had been possible. What else could be? His thoughts were interrupted with a strong feeling housed in many parts of his body, both inside and out. The strongest of which was felt right in the center of his torso. Trying to see what was happening gave Jake no success, but feeling around with a rubbery hand confirmed his suspicion; an inflation valve, just like the one he saw on Alice, and just like the one&#39;s he had seen on numerous pool toys and beach balls, had appeared on him.<br />
<br />
Which now meant that his transformation was over. <br />
<br />
Movement felt different to Jake. His whole kinesthesia seemed off. His body felt as though there was no weight to it. He put a hand up to his new breasts, feeling them as if he was touching bare skin. He put his other hand on the front of his inflated skirt, giving an identical feeling. Now Jake began to experiment with his sense of balance, taking short and cautious steps. He began to turn around towards the door when he finally saw it. Saw him. Saw her. The mirror.<br />
<br />
The realization had seemed to finally set in.<br />
<br />
Looking back in the mirror at Jake was an inflated cat girl which, truthfully, looked a lot like Alice&#39;s new form. The most drastic differences between the two were the hair and the face. This girl&#39;s hair was far longer, extending down halfway her back. It was a bright chestnut colour, the same as her cat ears, and even featured some inflated puffy bangs sticking out and above her animated face. Then there was the face. She had the largest and cutest anime eyes Jake had ever seen; bright gold with a cat&#39;s slit pupil. Just like Alice, her facial features had no depth. Her eyes and mouth existed simply as animations on her latex skin. The only dimension on her face was provided by a puffed out nose and a single seam running down the meridian. Jake opened his mouth, the girl in the mirror responded. Jake winked, the girl reciprocated.<br />
<br />
That was him. <br />
<br />
By now, Jake was...</p>
