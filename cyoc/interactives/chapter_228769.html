<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I need some God dame wine.” stated Stacy as she stood up and headed over to the where Monica had multiple bottles of wine hanging on a rack in her kitchen.<br />
<br />
“I’ll get down some more glasses.” ordered Monica <br />
<br />
“I wish I could join you.” stated Mary as one of her hands moved to her belly where her newest child was growing inside of her. “At least this cub will be born within our pride.”<br />
<br />
“That is one more bounce I guess.” stated Rose as Monica placed down three glasses as Stacy grabbed a bottle. <br />
<br />
Stacy didn’t grab a bottle opener instead she let the spell slip for a moment as she extended one of her claws from her fingers letting the razor-sharp claw uncork the bottle. None of them said anything else as she poured three large glasses of wine and sat down.<br />
<br />
“The question is how do we go about this?” inquired Stacy.<br />
<br />
“I would say do a group change, get everyone in one place, a cabin in the woods and make sure the pride is there to back us up.” stated Rose before she eyed Mary “However I don’t see Thomas would let you go anywhere far away from a hospital at the moment.”<br />
<br />
“No.” confirmed Mary as she lovingly ran her hands down her stomach. “This will be our first girl and he is really looking forward to welcoming his daughter and so am I.”<br />
<br />
“Which is why I say we start with you.” said Stacy as everyone eyed her, as leader of their group of friends, she had been given the task to make sure all four of them remained undercover and to keep in contact with the pride. That is why she was the one to find out about them being recalled. <br />
<br />
“That is against the ancient traditions of the pride the Alpa’s wouldn’t be happy with me to leave you all.” countered Mary <br />
<br />
“You’re with cub, no offense you will not be much of help to us right now.” Stated Stacy with her normal bluntness. <br />
<br />
“Stacy has a point.” confirmed Rose “Besides if we do have to force this change on them, how much help could you really be.”<br />
<br />
“If anything, you could get in the way.” confirmed Stacy<br />
<br />
“They are right.” confirmed Monica as Mary let out a resigned sigh. “You have to be the one to go first.”<br />
<br />
“I get it.” stated Mary, this was abandonment of her duties of Alpa of this small group, but she did have a higher duty to protect her unborn cub, for that was the next generation. “Thomas is working from home today, our boys are home sick today, flu.”<br />
<br />
“Now?” inquired Stacy as all the women looked around at each other. <br />
<br />
“Now.” confirmed Mary as she stood up, as the rest of them downed their glasses of wine. <br />
<br />
Two of the four of them lived in the same culdesac of houses, so reaching Mary’s house was as simple as walking across the street. <br />
<br />
The house like Monica’s was upper middle/upper class.<br />
<br />
“I am back honey.” Announced Mary as she walked back into her house. “The girls are with me.”<br />
<br />
“Ok, I thought you would be there longer.” Came a voice from the kitchen area, as the four women walked into the room. To find a man in his early 40’s standing there with a cup of coffee. He was slightly heavy but not in a fat way, he had been an offensive lineman in college so most of the “fat” was actually muscles. <br />
<br />
“Welcome home honey.” Said the man as he placed down his coffee cup and came around and kissed Mary before wrapping her into a hug and placing a hand on her stomach. “So how are my two lovely girls doing?”<br />
<br />
“Doing good.” Said Mary with a loving smile, before she got serious. “Thomas, there is something I need to talk to you about.”<br />
Thomas had some concern on his face. <br />
<br />
“What is wrong?” inquired Thomas clearly concerned.<br />
<br />
“Shouldn’t we get your boys as well?” inquired Stacy<br />
<br />
“No, lets talk first.” stated Mary as she wrapped her hands around Thomas’s hands. “Thomas, I love you more than anything else, but I have lied to you about something. Something very important.”<br />
<br />
“What is it?” inquired Thomas “Whatever it is, we will face it as a family.”<br />
<br />
“Um…” said Mary unsure how to say it.<br />
<br />
“Well, I will be totally honest with you, I just got called back to my home pride and I am afraid you and the boys will have to come with me.” stated Mary “I am not, human, I am what you would call a werecat.”<br />
<br />
Thomas looked at her with a confused look before laughing a bit.<br />
<br />
“Really funny.” laughing a bit. <br />
<br />
“Show him.” said Stacy <br />
<br />
Mary let out a sigh, as she reached up to a necklace which all four of them shared. The story was it was a sign of their friendship when in truth it controlled the spell that kept them in human form. <br />
<br />
She let her true form out, before the man she loves eyes, the father of her kids, her body began to grow. She was actually short for a werecat but she grew to a point where she could look her husband in the eye. <br />
<br />
Her muscles grew in size, as tannish yellow fur began to appear across her flesh. Her bones snapped as kicked off her shoes as best she could as her feet shifted into more cat like feet with padded feet. Her breasts grew as well, her cloths also ripped as she became nude. <br />
<br />
Claws grew out of her fingers before she pulled them back into herself as her teeth changed into fangs. Her blonde hair remained basically the same and she was still clearly pregnant. Her belly, chest and lower jaw now covered with light tan fur while the rest of her was a darker tan. Her ears shifted into rounded shapes that moved to the top of her head. A long tail grew out of her tail bone, as it did a fur covered end grew out. <br />
<br />
“I am a were lioness.” explained Mary with fear in her eyes as she was concerned how the man she loves would react to her true form as Thomas just looked at her slack jawed.</p>
