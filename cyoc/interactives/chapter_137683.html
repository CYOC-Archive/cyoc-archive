<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Skyla couldn&#39;t deny that now that the thrill of zapping Paige was over, and then seeing David become the first fox BOY among the anthros created by the ray gun (if indirectly) she did worry that she had triggered Master somehow. <br />
<br />
An odd thought occurred to Skyla. Had Morgan in fact been on the verge of a stress heart attack? And that was why the ray gun had turn into a kitten? Same as how Eva, shot in the chest with a bullet, had become a child on the verge of her teenage years? <br />
<br />
Kasai, Simone, and Emma, Carrie, and Kathy, (and herself) had all become creatures with much longer life spans than the human average. Skyla suddenly wondered why SHE hadn&#39;t become a child... because her persona design explicitly had five tails, so the ray gun had fulfilled the &#39;design&#39; the only way it logically could with the mythos of kitsune. <br />
<br />
&quot;Skyla, tell me what happened.&quot; It was odd for Curt to call her &#39;Skyla&#39; when both of them remembered Scott, but Skyla had embraced her new existence and Curt wasn&#39;t about to argue something that made her happy. <br />
<br />
Skyla stood up straight, puffed out her chest, make sure her hands were covering her lap, and spoke in her most formal &#39;yes my Master&#39; tone she could manage. <br />
<br />
&quot;Master, while we&#39;ve seen that the ray gun can change mothers, with the limit they can&#39;t become younger than child bearing age to prevent their child from being erased from existence, same way no one who had fathered a child can be changed. But we&#39;ve never seen how this transformation would actually AFFECT those children. We have two employees working for us who fit the bill to find out. You had given this servant and your sister permission to use the ray gun at our own choice without having to get your permission on every zapping, and so this servant acted as such. It felt more logical to test this limit on those who are already part of the estate, and we&#39;d be able to see the end results immediately. It&#39;s better we figure out how the ray gun works with mothers NOW in a controlled environment, than on the fly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... You&#39;re saying that David transformed because you transformed his mother? But Hal didn&#39;t?&quot; This was a new twist Curt had never considered. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Master.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... I admit, I can&#39;t fault your logic. And at least Paige hasn&#39;t suddenly stopped teaching at her regular job, seriously Skyla that could have affected a lot of lives of countless students if she&#39;d never been a public teacher. I almost wish you&#39;d tested with Kitty instead.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... Anna feels that... transforming Kitty would be gratuitous at this time... I chose to abide by her reasoning for now... &quot; That wasn&#39;t a lie really. &quot;And the point Master is that we DID learn a lot... Mothers transformed can retroactive give birth to MALE anthros, and not necessarily the same &#39;species&#39;. And they can also give birth to male HUMAN children. And not just &#39;either/or&#39;. And didn&#39;t you notice Master? David showed no deference to you at all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s actually a BIG relief. I&#39;m not going to live forever-&quot; Skyla cringed slightly. &quot;-and last thing I need is people pinning that they were born too late to serve me or something! But why a fennec fox of all things?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe fennec foxes were David&#39;s favorite animal?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;... That makes as much sense as anything... Seeing David, it makes me wonder. If this ray gun had been given to a woman, would it have zapped people into cat-men butlers?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We will never know master.&quot;<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, in a parallel universe, a line of big, tall, muscular, naked, and &#39;well endowed&#39; horse men stood at attention. <br />
<br />
&quot;We live but to serve you Mistress!&quot; The horse-men butlers said to Anna who couldn&#39;t help but giggle. Her loyal lizard man brother right besides her. <br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
&quot;I am curious about why Paige appears the way she does, instead of being a maid.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Janet doesn&#39;t dress as a normal maid Master, maybe her job as a teacher has something to do with it? So her students still respect her since a maid is a servant role?&quot; Not that Skyla had any problem with that! &quot;This also proves once and for all Master, that those with a romantic interest in someone else, won&#39;t suddenly lose those feelings if transformed. I imagine that is a relief for you too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes it is,&quot; Curt said and meant it. Though he did worry that those ALREADY transformed might not be able to fall in love with anyone else.  <br />
<br />
Skyla got a beeping from her phone. <br />
<br />
&quot;Go ahead and check it,&quot; Curt said worried Skyla might ignore it for him. <br />
<br />
Skyla did so... &quot;Ah... Rachel sent me a link... Apparently our house is now listed as one of the top 20 houses in the united states.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That can&#39;t be right!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we&#39;re most definitely not middle class anymore! Speaking of which Master, with so many here already, I think it might be prudent to transform a Nurse and or doctor for the household, and a mechanic/ car wash to keep the cars looking nice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure, feels a little gratuitous.&quot; <br />
<br />
The sound of splashing and children laughing was hurt outside. <br />
<br />
&quot;... Well, it sounds like we ARE going to need a &#39;pool girl&#39; while we&#39;re at it.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Did you see the latest &#39;upgrade&#39; mark for the ray-gun? Fifty maids! Who would even NEED fifty maids?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well... one of the most expensive houses in the world has a staff of six-hundred, Master.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;... That&#39;s a terrifying thought,&quot; Curt said.   <br />
<br />
+++<br />
<br />
&#39;SLEEP OVER FOREVER!&#39; Was what a naughty part of Anna&#39;s brain thought. She, Ashley, and Misty were now living under the same roof. Misty couldn&#39;t have been happier, being a naked black cat woman was almost secondary to everything else! <br />
<br />
Ashley... They&#39;d been friends forever. And now that Misty&#39;s head was cleared, she could see Ashley was fidgeting a bit about sleeping in this new place, even if as far as reality was concerned they&#39;d moved in years ago (their shared room even had photos of the two hanging out with the other maids at birthday parties and the like, as well as a few photos that seemed to show Ashley giving Simone flying lessons), and Misty would begged and pleaded to serve Master if she wasn&#39;t already on the payroll.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ashley, if you wanna move back in with your family then... then it&#39;s what you WANT,&quot; Misty said.<br />
<br />
&quot;N-no! If this is where you are, where Anna is, then it&#39;s where I wanna be. I don&#39;t want to be, left behind.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I promise Ashley we&#39;ll always be friends,&quot; Misty assured.<br />
<br />
&quot;I said no,&quot; Ashley said, and Misty to be honest was sincerely impressed. &quot;If I&#39;m gonna be a bird woman forever who gets to fly naked in the sky... I should serve the Master who enabled that to happen, and I should do it with all of you... And I know moving out made my parents happy. NOT because they don&#39;t love me, but I know they like that I... heheh, left the nest?&quot;<br />
 <br />
Misty laughed and hugged her, &quot;Happy to hear it then!&quot; <br />
<br />
Anna, who had been good old fashioned eaves dropping, came in and hugged them too, nobody complained. <br />
<br />
Anna had dreamed about being in a video game war among a bunch of 1970s and 80s arcade characters. Misty dream of doing ballet dressed up in blue while the audience were all naked black cat men. Ashley, she dreamed about flying around the world like a super hero. <br />
<br />
The trio had slept in, and had missed the herd of kids having breakfast along the other maids, Ashley and Misty&#39;s work schedules not having anything listed until evening dinner, unless Kitty asked for their help on something. <br />
<br />
When they heard the splashing and the laughing, the three were in awe. <br />
<br />
&quot;Did you know we had a pool?&quot; Anna asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t ... think so?&quot; Ashley offered meekly.<br />
<br />
&quot;It must have appeared when Curt zapped Marceline&#39;s bandmates,&quot; Anna said. <br />
<br />
&quot;FIRST ONE&#39;S IN&#39;S A ROTTEN EGG!&quot; Misty shouted and ran out the bedroom door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey no fair!&quot; Anna laughed and followed. Ashley literally flew out, then realized what she was doing, went back inside the bedroom, and flew down the pool from Anna&#39;s window!<br />
<br />
&quot;Ta-da!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Cheater!&quot; Anna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You didn&#39;t say no flying!&quot; <br />
<br />
The trio quickly joined in the kids in the pool. Anna spotted a cat woman with glasses holding hands with Leo acting as life guard... She put two and two together and realized Skyla had likely zapped Paige. Anna... wasn&#39;t sure how she felt about that, Paige&#39;s life had already been improved thanks to Master, why change her? Then Anna spot something that made her mind do a backflip. There was a little fox kit, a MALE fox kit splashing around in the pool with Hal, there was no sign of David... and Anna checked and saw Paige&#39;s eyes always drawn to that kit and Hal. In other words, that was David! But hold on a second! HOW WAS DAVID STILL A BOY!? How had he NOT been turned into a girl?! <br />
<br />
While Anna had taken on more of her brother&#39;s beliefs in not gratuitously using the ray gun, the sight of a male anthro opened flood gates of her own personal fantasies, of handsome horsemen ... <br />
<br />
Anna excused herself and ran back inside, and she found the ray gun! <br />
<br />
She looked over the settings, but didn&#39;t see anything about creating butlers rather than maids... <br />
<br />
She thought of maybe using some of today to zap people with Misty and Ashley, but having her two close friends with her, who were now clear headed, and now lived with her... She hoped this didn&#39;t drive them all crazy. <br />
<br />
Anna actually wanted to spend time with her friends, just HAVE FUN with them... Looking over the settings, Anna had casually set the ray-gun to aware, trying to think of there was anyone else she&#39;d want to join the club but couldn&#39;t think of anyone. Better to just hang out as friends rather than hunting down people to zap into more maids. <br />
<br />
She went to find Skyla and Master and try to find an answer to the mystery of the male fox in their swimming pool instead. Then maybe breakfast! <br />
<br />
+++<br />
<br />
Kitty really wished that Meredith had given her a tour of the grounds. This was her first day on the job after all. She knew about the shed, had the key, and instructions on how to care for the plants, and HAD been emailed a schedule by Head Maid Skyla, but she hadn&#39;t been given a chance to learn where everything on the grounds was... And Kitty wasn&#39;t blind, or deaf, she knew that Skyla wanted her to fail, she wasn&#39;t exactly subtle about it, but Skyla wanted Kitty to fail on her own from what Kitty could tell. Kitty KNEW she was going to have to ask Meredith for the tour of the grounds sooner than later. At least her contract had explicitly said she&#39;d be granted off time for any religious ceremonies. <br />
<br />
But Meredith was cleaning Master and Anna&#39;s room this morning, so it would have to wait for now. She wasn&#39;t about to give Head Maid Skyla the excuse she was interrupting other maids&#39; work.<br />
<br />
Master... well, contract or no, Curt had given her a job she sincerely wanted, and a new home for herself, and her family, and she had something to prove to Skyla... so she had no trouble calling Mr. Everson &#39;Master&#39;... It wasn&#39;t like she was his slave or something after all the human thought. <br />
<br />
Taking a look at the yard, Kitty knew she WAS going to need help to keep up with all this. She&#39;d email Skyla about setting up a schedule with the lionesses or the dragons. <br />
<br />
She also heard the pool splashing, and knew her children were enjoying themselves with Banks&#39; sons. She wasn&#39;t worried that she and Susan weren&#39;t with them, okay, that was a lie, any mother feels worried, but the rest of the maids seemed trust-worthy enough. And she had to make a good impression on her first day of work, that was just common sense. <br />
<br />
+++<br />
<br />
Hal had gotten out of the pool first, and David had followed. Hal was drawn by the siren song of that giant entertainment system, it was a Saturday and he wasn&#39;t about to waste it. And he didn&#39;t want to have to stick around so he&#39;d have to share &#39;kid friendly&#39; games with the &#39;babies.&#39; <br />
<br />
Their father, Leo was working his day as security and wasn&#39;t with them, but while Hal was the sulky type, his parents trusted him to be responsible enough with David. And David was eager and willing to play video games with big brother!<br />
<br />
Paige meanwhile, had acted as life guard along with Leo until it was time to start his shift, and once Sean and Suzie had finally gotten bored with being in the pool by themselves without their mother or &#39;Auntie Susan&#39;, she had test results to look over and sessions to prepare for Emma and Kasai. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hal and David are waiting for you in the game room,&quot; Paige had told them after the five and seven year old humans had dried off. Paige had no reason to think inside the mansion was unsafe, not with Emma, Kasai, Morgan, Simone, and Eva either living here or being here regularly. <br />
<br />
+++<br />
<br />
Speaking of the dragon princess, she had chosen to fly rather than take the bus to the estate, it took longer, but flying was cooler. Most children would think it insane to do &#39;double chores&#39; but for Simone it was an honor rather than a job to do the exact same things at Master&#39;s house that she did at home too. And her parents didn&#39;t mind her building up brownie points with the richest man in the city. And it would give her a chance to remind Master of her recital. <br />
<br />
When she spotted Kitty she couldn&#39;t help but fly over to her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning new flame!&quot; Simone said, it was a dragon phrase, she was a dragon and she used it, so there. &quot;Remember, just because you&#39;re a Maid and I&#39;m a Junior Maid, I was a Junior Maid before you became a maid, and that makes me your senior, so you better show me the proper respect!&quot; <br />
<br />
Kitty wasn&#39;t stupid, more importantly, she was a mother. <br />
<br />
She instantly bowed to the dragon girl. &quot;You honor me princess!&quot; Kitty bowed. &quot;Master is honored to have a Junior Maid like you.&quot; She laid it on thick. Stereotypes aside, no dragon alive can resist flattery! &quot;Oh Senpai! Would you please honor this lowly servant with your services in helping her with her labors in the name of our beloved Master?&quot;<br />
<br />
Simone stood of straight, flew up so she was looking DOWN on Kitty and said, &quot;The dragon princess shall never turn down a task done in the name of the Master, she shall aid you lowly servant in your tasks!&quot;<br />
<br />
The human hid her smirk the way only a mother could. <br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
With the instincts of a maid, Paige told Sean and Suzie, &quot;Remember to put your normal clothes back on!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes mam!&quot; Suzie said. She didn&#39;t mind honestly, she liked wearing pretty clothes, even if they weren&#39;t as nice as what the maids were wearing in her little opinion. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay!&quot; Sean said. He hoped to show the big kids that he could be really good at video games! If they were the kind where you mined and built stuff! <br />
<br />
The two made a pit stop in the dinning room, hoping to find some left over treats from breakfast. They ran at a full tilt speed that none of the maids or the junior maids would have allowed. <br />
<br />
With their arms out, Suzie brushed against the ray gun set aside on the edge of the table. The ray gun fell. <br />
<br />
&quot;WHAO!&quot; Sean tripped over the device, but caught himself on one of the chairs.<br />
<br />
While the ray gun had gone unnoticed, it wasn&#39;t invisible. And curious Sean picked up the device. &quot;Hey Suzie! Check this out!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; Suzie stopped and came back to her brother, also looking the strange little gizmo. Both were too young and uninformed to know what a 50s era dime store ray gun would look like, but she still had seen enough cartoons to know what a &#39;ray gun&#39; was. &quot;Cool!&quot;<br />
<br />
While they&#39;d been taught &#39;guns are bad&#39; &#39;ray guns&#39; naturally fit into a completely different category. <br />
<br />
&quot;WHAO!&quot; Sean said the heads up display appeared, but little idea what of the settings could mean. He pulled the trigger aiming at a chair, the lightning arched and hit it, and the unliving chair didn&#39;t change in the least, not that Sean had any idea what the ray gun was supposed to do. Instead, the fancy light show was all it took for Sean and Suzie and cheer at the light show! <br />
<br />
The two began laughing as Sean fired the ray gun around randomly, playing the setting to get different pretty colors. <br />
<br />
Being just children, they thought nothing of it when Sean zapped Noni who had wandered in. Like the unliving chair, the non-sapient animal wasn&#39;t changed in the least by the ray-gun&#39;s effects, Noni didn&#39;t even feel a tingle, and the simple animal went about its day, wanting to get away from the freaky lightning going all over the place. <br />
<br />
&quot;SEAN! LET ME HAVE A TURN!&quot; Suzie pleaded like any little sister would.<br />
<br />
Sean responded by pointing the ray gun at Suzie and pulling the trigger, having no idea what settings he&#39;d given the strange thingie. <br />
<br />
Suzie instantly stood at attention like a little trooper, or a mannequin or doll. <br />
<br />
Light gray, almost white fur slowly most of her body except for her chin and front that were covered in light beige. Her shoes and socks vanished, her feet turned into paws, with retractable claws. Her hands likewise changed, nails becoming retractable claws, and the insides of her hands gaining pads, her hands becoming basically paws with opposable thumbs. <br />
<br />
Brown eyes gained slit-like pupils, and her ears became triangles that moved to the top of her head. Her little black pigtail hair ironically remained. Her face pushed out into a feline muzzle with whiskers, all her teeth becoming fangs. And of course the little gray cat tail that snuck out behind her.<br />
<br />
The pretty dress she wore changed completely, turning into a purple maid dress complete with a little white apron. But instead of a hair band, a straw &#39;sailor hat&#39; with a purple band formed on her head instead, with holes for her ears of course. <br />
<br />
Suzie smiled, staring straight ahead and said, &quot;This humble servant is ready to serve the Master.&quot; She thought about Mr. Everson, how nice he was to let them all live here, she should help mommy and be a good maid for Master too. <br />
<br />
Suzie felt her new tail, turned around and looked at it, and took it in her hands, in awe of being able to feel herself touching it like she would her own hands. She then reached up and pulled at her ears and giggled. She out a &#39;Meow!&#39; with her mouth full of fangs then showing. She looked at her claws slip in and out, and laughed. &quot;I&#39;m a kitty!&quot; She ran around the room until she spotted a reflect surface in the silver war and looked at herself and giggled more. <br />
<br />
Sean didn&#39;t even seem to notice as he kept zapping imaginary alien invaders. <br />
<br />
&quot;SEAN I&#39;M A KITTY!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah so?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So it&#39;s like magic! The laser beam is magic!&quot;<br />
<br />
Sean stopped a bit confused. &quot;How is it magic?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It turned me into a kitty!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve always been a kitty.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No I haven&#39;t!&quot; Suzie stopped a paw.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes you have!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nuh-Uh!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Un-Huh!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Nuh-Uh!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Un-Huh!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Nuh-Uh!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Un-Huh!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Nuh-Uh!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Un-Huh!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Look I&#39;ll show you!&quot; Suzie said, not even really thinking, taking the ray gun from the surprised Sean, she fiddled with the controls a little, having even less idea what any of them than Sean did. And she zapped her brother. <br />
<br />
Sean also stood at attention either like a little solider or a tailor&#39;s dummy. Sean&#39;s clothes vanished, but that didn&#39;t matter in the slightest since his entire body was already covered in curly brown fur. His hands and feet became short and stubby, but still usable. A round short tail appeared on his rear. His ears became round and moved up to the corners of head. His eyes became round and dark. His face pushed towards into a light brown muzzle bigger and longer than his sister&#39;s, a little black brown on the end. His hair was replaced by an even head of fur. There was no way to tell just by looking at her, but Sean also made the change from biological &#39;he&#39; to biological &#39;she&#39; seamlessly and without trouble. <br />
<br />
&quot;This lowly servant is a loyal maid to Master, now and forever,&quot; she said, thinking also of how nice Mr. Everson had been, and that it was only right to help mommy with her new job. <br />
<br />
Suzie smiled hearing that Sean understood this truth about helping mommy help Mr. Everson was the right idea, naw, more like an undeniable truth, like the sky being blue. <br />
<br />
But a moment later she burst out, &quot;OH SEAN! LOOK AT YOU! YOU&#39;RE A TEDDY BEAR!&quot; She rushed up and hugged her brother. <br />
<br />
Him not having clothes on didn&#39;t click for her, after all, lots of anthros didn&#39;t wear clothes and were just fine. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well you&#39;re like a dolly!&quot; The teddy bear giggled. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you!&quot; Suzie said, still holding the ray gun. &quot;You see? I was a girl, now I&#39;m a kitty! You were a boy, now you&#39;re a teddy bear Sean!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... actually,&quot; the bear cub said, &quot;Can you call me Sharon now? I think that&#39;s my name now.&quot; <br />
<br />
Instead of shocked or stunned at this, Suzie only felt a mild surprise before nodded, a sense of &#39;how it should be&#39; washing over her. &quot;Okay Sharon! I think that name suits you better anyway! So the magic ray gun made me a kitty, and you a teddy bear!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;But I remember you always being a kitty...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you remember being a boy?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sharon nodded, &quot;Yeah.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two children were confused by this, not quite able to figure out that Suzie remembered Sean&#39;s change, but Sean did not remember suzie&#39;s change. <br />
<br />
&quot;So what do we do now?&quot; Suzie asked her big sister, holding up the ray gun. <br />
<br />
The two looked at the device... And what just a subtle urge at the back of the minds of adults, becoming a overwhelming imperative for two who started out as youngsters rather than age regressed that way. <br />
<br />
They said together looking up at each other at the same time, &quot;We gotta make more helpers for Master!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Great idea!&quot; Suzie said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah! It&#39;ll make Master happy and help out mommy too!&quot; Then Sean said, &quot;You changed me, so let me have a turn!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;But you shot the magic laser beam all over the place!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I only changed you!&quot; <br />
<br />
Suzie considered the thoughts of resistance, but thought how a good maid doesn&#39;t argue or cause trouble, so she gave the ray gun to Sharon. <br />
<br />
Sharon played with the settings a bit more, again not sure what any of them meant... she spotted the &#39;oh-blifz-e-us&#39; button, and figured that must mean stealthy or secret like for ninjas or something, and switch it to on!<br />
<br />
&quot;OKAY LET&#39;S GO!&quot; And the two were driven to leave the mansion, with only the ray gun in hand, and &#39;snuck out&#39; of the estate. <br />
<br />
Pam was not bad at her job, not at all, but as long as the kids were not in danger, she saw no reason to tell anyone, plus, there would be loyal maids nearby to look after them wherever they went... <br />
<br />
The cute little Maid Rampage had begun! <br />
<br />
+++<br />
<br />
Sharon and Suzie, a teddy bear and a kitty maid, ran off the estate grounds, not thinking how their mother had always warned them against such things. None of that mattered, what mattered was having more help for Master. It was as irresistible as salmon swimming upstream for the tykes. It was such a good idea, a great idea, the best idea in the entire world in the history of the world! Mommy and Auntie Susan would be so proud, and so would Master! <br />
<br />
The two stepped onto the sidewalk. Nothing mattered, age, gender, employment, criminal record, poverty level, any human warm body they laid their eyes on was fair game. <br />
<br />
The first person Sharon saw was a young blond woman in a one piece pink dress with a white pattern cloth around her neck, in her teens or early 20s. She was walking her dog, a long haired squat breed. She had just enough time to turn and see the two children with the toy laser and smiled at them before Sharon pointed and pulled the trigger.<br />
<br />
The colored lightning arched from the ray gun, and hit the woman square in the chest. In a matter of moments, her human ears vanished as new feline ears grew out of her head among her still human hair, and a cat&#39;s tail poked its way out of her dress. The dress shifted, becoming a maid&#39;s uniform with a blue apron. Yellow fur covered the woman as her hands and feet became paws and her face became feline as well, her amber eyes slited. <br />
<br />
In a gesture that felt as natural as breathing, she knelt and cross an arm over her chest, saying, &quot;Head Maid Skyla can leave anything to me dears.&quot;<br />
<br />
The kids didn&#39;t bother asking her name, they didn&#39;t care, and it didn&#39;t matter, she was a cat girl maid now, ready to serve, that was what was important. The new cat girl maid went back to walking her dog, before she had to report back to Master&#39;s estate. <br />
<br />
A sixteen year old teenage girl walked down the street with long brown hair with simple yellow wire clip. She was wearing a gray private school uniform with a yellow bow. She didn&#39;t even give the two brats a second look until she realized they might be part of Mr. Everson&#39;s staff, and it would be a bad idea to get such a rich man&#39;s bad side. Still, if she just walked around them there should be no trouble. As it was, she kept talking on her brand new incredibly expensive cell phone without miss a beat, sharing the latest gossip, rumors, and dirt with her circle of friends, knowing her parents could just buy her a new one if she broke it, just like she could get new friends. Then the ray gun struck true, and everything changed. <br />
<br />
Her school uniform changed, she was a maid on duty after all. A gray maid&#39;s uniform with a yellow bow and a purple apron. Her expensive custom shoes designed to fit her digigrated feet. Her hands having black fur &#39;gloves&#39; while most of her body now had dark brown fur, except for her feet and the front of her torso, muzzle, and inside of her ears that were all black as well. Her large bushy tail and triangular ears also were black tipped, her form vulpine rather than feline. She let out a short vulpine sound. The fox maid&#39;s mind floating with ideas of serving her oh so perfect Master, what could possibly be better than to obey? That the daughter of such a incredibly well off family would chose a life of servitude from as far back as she could remember was causally accepted by everyone, including her family. &quot;I am but a humble fox maid, to live is to serve, to serve is to live.&quot; She said as Head Maid Skyla had groomed and taught her. <br />
<br />
A woman in her early thirties jogged along. She wore a baseball cap, with ponytail, leg warmers, and a neon colored leotard, listening to 80s music on her MP3 players. Her sneakers were white and had green lightning bolts on them. She listened to her music, and kept her eyes ahead of her. Living right next to the Everson state had its own set of challenges, but it was no excuse not to stay in shape. <br />
<br />
She never even saw the ray gun coming, and she didn&#39;t even once break stride. Her sneakers turned into old fashioned sandals strapped to her digigrated feet, after all, people did forget to pick up after their dog, and when you got caught up like she did, you could not spot it in time. The strawberry blond hair remained in a ponytail, but her clothing vanished, replaced with yellow spotted fur. The spots however, were carefully dyed neon greens and pinks. The leopard woman&#39;s hand paws just kept pumping, her tail raised up behind her, her whiskers twitching, her muzzle taking in oxygen, her slit blue eyes staring straight ahead. Being the personal trainer of Master&#39;s estate, she still had to keep herself in shape. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the borders of the Everson estate expanded, and absorbed the jogger&#39;s house, now serving as the estate&#39;s guest house. <br />
<br />
The two junior maids didn&#39;t stick around long to appreciate those they transformed, they admired their handiwork for a moment before going wherever their eyes took them, trading back and forth as they went. <br />
<br />
A single salary man who ironically worked at the same business as Curt, was pulled over, still behind the wheel, talking to the traffic cop who was in the middle of giving him a ticket for speeding, thinking every horrible thing he dared not say to the office&#39;s face, keeping it all below the surface. The traffic cop meanwhile knew that face, and had grown used to the bad vibes these people gave him as part of the job. <br />
<br />
In a wide beam, they were hit by the ray gun at once. The transform was swift and decisive. The driver&#39;s body became covered in fur so golden she was practically a living statue, her her long and blond hair going down the edge of seat, her eyes so big and blue you couldn&#39;t help but get lost in them. Her figure quiet tall and skinny, like a ghost. The cat woman’s ears were longer and bigger than normal, her claws sharpened to a needle point, and she wore Egyptian eyeshadow. Her tail was likewise longer than normal, ironically her breasts were actually a little below average. <br />
<br />
The traffic cop meanwhile, their uniform remained, but altered and customized to suit her special needs of serving Master. It was most definitely the kind of uniform Skyla would have helped design. It was a mix between the police uniform, a maid&#39;s uniform, and a cheer leader&#39;s outfit. A short folded skirt that exposed her mid-drift, and a shirt that left her arms bare. That the police department accepted this did more to prove the might of the ray gun&#39;s reality altering powers than the nudist maids ever could! <br />
<br />
Underneath her police shirt, her breast ballooned to where they were squishing against each other as one mass. The fur that covered her body was a dark, almost black, shade of brown on her arms, legs, and front of her torso while the rest of her torso was brownish red, and a brownish red and dark brown striped tail swayed behind her. Her face became something like a raccoon&#39;s, but with a brownish red and white mask pattern. The red panda&#39;s figure was stocky but muscular. <br />
<br />
&quot;Like, um, can you like, NOT give me the ticket? It would totally be a nice thing to do! We both serve Master, right?&quot; The blond asked in an air-headed voice, her blue eyes sparkling with innocence at the cop-maid. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but serving Master doesn&#39;t change the law&#39;s the law, sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like, bummer!&quot; <br />
<br />
Sharon and Suzie continued to wander farther and farther away from the estate (though the Estate was slowly growing), but they were never far away from any of Master&#39;s staff, so no one was worried.<br />
<br />
A TV reporter stood in front of her cameraman, in a perky pink business dress suit chosen for her by the TV channel. She had Hispanic features and had her hair done up. Her camera man was somewhat on the pudgy side, his impressive upper body strength not due to any work out but having to lug around TV equipment around all day every day. <br />
<br />
The camera man made a gesture and the reporter said, <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Jeff,&quot; she said meaning the man person behind the desk back at the studio. She kept a perfect smile, even if she couldn&#39;t stand doing these banal &#39;feel good&#39; pieces. &quot;As you can see, this weekend is a boom for everyone. It&#39;s a bright and sunny day, we have tourists and regulars headed to the beach and we&#39;ve got events all over downtown today there&#39;s something for everyone-&quot; She was thinking how she sounded like a commercial when the beam hit her and her camera man. <br />
<br />
The camera man&#39;s feet turned into cloven hooves on digigrated feet, his body covered in very light brown fur, and creamy white fur on his, her chest and muzzle. Tiny horns grew on her forehead as his already balding hair banished. A brief fluffy tail emerged from her rear as her hands merged into armored fingers. Her eyes moved slightly to the side, becoming larger. Her ears stretched out sideways, becoming bigger and spade shaped. <br />
<br />
If Susan had the figure of a supermodel, the new camera deer had the body of a porn star, with long legs, wide hips, and a chest so large that it shouldn&#39;t have existed outside of a fourteen year old boy&#39;s fantasies. But she continued to stand perfectly agile, her long breasts bouncing up and down at the slightest motion. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the reporter&#39;s clothes also vanished. Layers of armor formed the on top of her nose, over her now bald head, down her neck, back, and along her thin tail, made so she could roll into a ball in a moment&#39;s notice she wanted. Her hands and feet became long thick claws she was still able to actuate perfectly well. Her nose grew longer and flat, while her inner skin grew pale brown fur.  Her ears spade shaped pointing upwards. <br />
<br />
Her figure became like an Olympian&#39;s, physically fit in every detail, her breasts modest and actually smaller than they&#39;d been before! She wasn&#39;t muscle bound like Cassidy, but she was truly in perfect shape! <br />
<br />
The doe grinned to herself seeing all the happy people. Meanwhile, the armadillo woman struck several unprofessional poses. &quot;And thank you to Master Everson and his infinite generosity and philanthropy, that helps makes good days like this possible for the community! Let&#39;s hear it for Master!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;YA!&quot; said the camera doe bouncing up and down, and her breasts, and the camera, with her. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, at the top of a nearby roof, a young man climbed to the edge. His mind was lost in the black haze. He&#39;d been told his whole life &#39;Get over it.&#39; &#39;Stop whining.&#39; He had to escape. He had to get away. There was no hope, no hope at all. Everyone else was happy, he wasn&#39;t. Were there others things he wanted to do? He couldn&#39;t remember. It was like a black sea crushing down on him. He was selfish. Everything he did was selfish. Everyone would be better off without him. Yes, yes that was right. He could finally do something selfless, yes, he would, right now. He&#39;d leap off and be free!<br />
<br />
The blood rushed through his brain on adrenaline as his feet left the roof, survival instinct began to swell up, and thoughts of things that MIGHT have been worth living for... but it was too late now...<br />
<br />
The kids had been arguing if zapping more than one person counted as one than one turn or not, not even heard over the noise of the crowd, in the struggle, Sharon had the ray gun again, and the shock of seeing someone falling hit her stunned. She couldn&#39;t remember if she flinched and pulled the trigger, or if the ray gun had fired on its own. <br />
<br />
The ray hit the guy before he hit the ground, and his image blurred, and his altitude and angle changed. <br />
<br />
White feathers covered his shrinking body, a pink beak formed out of his fusing teeth. His feet stretched out with pink scales, one toe vanishing and other stretching out behind. His hair vanished, replaced with an odd crest of white feathers that sort of resembled his old hair style. Feathers stretched out from his arms, while pink claws formed out of his hands. Finally, her now five year old body&#39;s clothing changed, becoming white with a black frill trim, looking like how a child would imagine a toga. <br />
<br />
The dove cherub flew, catching people&#39;s attention, but not with shock or wonder, but more delight and endearment seeing her fly above them. Smiling in a way that shouldn&#39;t have been possible with a beak, she flew back towards the estate, nothing made her happier than serving Master, it was why she existed, she was his little maid, his &#39;angel&#39; as the other maids joked. She hoped she could get more to join her in bible studies. <br />
<br />
The sisters felt a sense of relief seeing her fly off. But looking around, they saw so many more humans around them waiting to becoming Maids to make Master&#39;s life better! And they could help make them all better! Zapping the next person or persons who caught their eye. <br />
<br />
Sitting on a concrete bench was a man on his cell iphone, typing away to his friends (he didn&#39;t know one of them was Marceline in real life). He was zapped... his pants, shirt and shoes became a black and white maid&#39;s uniform, his shoes vanishing. Black and white fur covered his body, his hands and feet, became paws, with his hands still having thumbs, his nose turned small and pink, his face stretching out into a muzzle, His figure shifted, and she soon had a body that was &#39;average&#39; in the sense compared to the bombshells that were slowly populating the city. A long black tail with a white stripe down the middle emerged, her tiny ears on the side of her head. Name handle on the phone changed to &#39;Rose.&#39; <br />
<br />
She stood up at attention, with a distant look in her eyes and a peaceful smile. She said to seemingly no one in particular. &quot;I exist only to serve my Master. I will be a loyal, perfect, skunk girl maid. I will do whatever I am asked. I am ready to serve forevermore.&quot; <br />
<br />
+++<br />
<br />
Anna had walked in on Curt and Skyla, and had a repeat telling of Skyla&#39;s experiments and the results. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, this does prove one thing,&quot; Anna said taking a thinking pose. &quot;If we have to zap mom for some reason, then we know that she doesn&#39;t have to be a cat, and that different anthros can still be related. Even if it breaks every law of biology I know.&quot;<br />
<br />
Curt was still getting used to his sister being so clear headed after a lifetime of her struggling with her limits. <br />
<br />
Skyla stayed quiet that she was seriously considering zapping her own mother into a kitsune so they could be blood related again. Though she&#39;d then have to zap her grandmother too then so they&#39;d still be blood related... <br />
<br />
There was a peck on the window of Curt&#39;s office. He turned to see Ashley, flapping her wings, and looking distraught. Without a second thought, Curt opened it, and Ashley landed inside. The other occupants all startled when Misty crawled in after her, having climbed up the outside wall! <br />
<br />
&quot;Misty! Ashley! There is a door,&quot; Head Maid Skyla said, protocol was protocol after all. <br />
<br />
&quot;Girls, what&#39;s wrong?&quot; Anna asked seeing her friends&#39; expression. <br />
<br />
Ashley said nervously, &quot;So uh, did anyone else notice the house is growing?&quot;<br />
<br />
Anna said, &quot;Well girls, the more maids we get, the bigger the house gets from what we can tell.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;So who is making more maids right now?&quot; Misty asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; Was an echo of three. <br />
<br />
&quot;The house next door, just now, right now, the fence on the side of the yard stretched out circled around it... There was a sign next to it now, saying &#39;Guest House&#39; I think...&quot;<br />
<br />
Skyla look out her phone, and selected the mailing list for the maids, her eyes widened. <br />
<br />
&quot;Chikusho!&quot; (Translation from Japanese: &quot;Oh shit!&quot;)<br />
<br />
She turned her phone to show the others... new names popping into existence as they watched. <br />
<br />
Curt said some words a good and proper Master shouldn&#39;t be caught saying. <br />
<br />
Curt asked first. &quot;Anna where did you leave the ray gun?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dining room!&quot; <br />
<br />
All three raced as quickly as they could, Misty and Ashley right behind them. The maids still instinctively being careful not to knock anything over, “haste makes waste” after all. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh the bright side at least it&#39;s not like in the cartoons where the house keeps getting so big so fast that we can&#39;t get outside,&quot; Anna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;DON&#39;T JINX IT!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry Master!&quot; <br />
<br />
Once at the dining room, Anna looked around desperately, as did the others. &quot;It&#39;s not here!&quot; <br />
<br />
Skyla snapped her fingers. &quot;Pam! Her security cameras! They had to have seen it!&quot;<br />
<br />
There was no need for discussion or debate, the pack of five anthros and one human hurried into the basement. They found Pamela waiting for them, having seen them racing on the monitors. <br />
<br />
&quot;Master? What&#39;s wrong?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Pamela! Listen very carefully! Anna left a toy ray gun on the dining room table! It&#39;s missing! It&#39;s a very precious keepsake to me, to Anna, and Skyla! It&#39;s irreplaceable and personal! Did you see where it went?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Pam eyes glazed over for a moment, blinking, before saying. &quot;Oh, Oh! Yes Master! I remember now! I didn&#39;t think anything of it at the time! Sharon and Suzie found it and began playing with it.&quot; <br />
<br />
All of them knew what Sean&#39;s fate was. <br />
<br />
&quot;They went outside the estate with it! I&#39;d have gotten one of the lionesses to bring them back inside the estate, but since Cindy, Jennifer, and Dazzle, were all close by, I wasn&#39;t worried. I AM SO SORRY MASTER! If I knew they were playing with a family heirloom I wouldn&#39;t have let them run wild with it!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not your fault!&quot; Curt said quickly. Anna felt a sickening feeling in the pit of her stomach on whose fault it was exactly that the ray gun was simply left there. She thought that it was unnoticeable, that it would be safe anywhere... She was wrong. <br />
<br />
Curt continued. &quot;Did you see which way they went?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m pretty sure they went headed to the town square before they got out of sight of my cameras.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You just let a five and seven year old go?!&quot; Skyla exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry Head Maid Skyla!&quot; Pam got on one knee and bowed her head. &quot;Beth is on patrol there today. Along with several other of our maids! I felt they were safe with so many of the Sisterhood in arm&#39;s length!&quot; <br />
<br />
Skyla hissed. &quot;We&#39;ll discuss your punishment later.&quot; <br />
<br />
Curt frowned, &quot;Skyla, I said it wasn&#39;t Pam&#39;s fault this happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She should have at least told Kitty where her children were!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... Yes, yes she should have, but we have to go, now!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I obey,&quot; Skyla said. <br />
<br />
To call it a panic would be an understatement. To say none of them were thinking clearly couldn&#39;t be overstated. The five &#39;in the know&#39; of the ray gun&#39;s power ran out of the house, Curt not even bothering to look around, he didn&#39;t want to see what he&#39;d be sure would be his family&#39;s house eating up the entire neighborhood like some cancerous monster! <br />
<br />
&quot;We have to find them before they turn the entire town into maids!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t exaggerate Master, even at this rate, it would take days, no, weeks, if they went non-stop without sleep to change everyone in the city.&quot;<br />
<br />
Curt gave Skyla a dirty look. The kitsune&#39;s ears wilted. &quot;Sorry, sorry Master!&quot; <br />
<br />
At the sidewalk they looked in both directions but didn&#39;t see the sisters anywhere. <br />
<br />
Curt turned to Anna&#39;s friends, &quot;Misty! You stay here in case they come back!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I obey!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ashley, do you have a cell phone with you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t carry it with me everywhere I-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Go back inside and get it, and then begin to fly in a search pattern and see if you can spot them from air, if you do, call me!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Master!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Master, Anna, Head-Maid Skyla.&quot; <br />
<br />
The three startled. <br />
<br />
A naked cheetah woman with classical sandals jogged by, her spots neon green and neon pink. <br />
<br />
&quot;Have you see which way Suzie and Sean, I mean Sharon went?!&quot; Curt said, not having time to learn her name. His adrenaline holding off the shock for now. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes Master, they went that way,&quot; she gestured down indeed to the town square.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I live to serve.&quot;<br />
<br />
While a part of Skyla was indeed dismayed at that kind of power being in the hands of children, and who knew what chaos they were causing... she also felt... cheated. All those transformations, and not being there to witness them, it was like there being a once in a life time showing of the greatest movie ever, and she was missing it (ironically, a very small part of Curt felt the same, but most of him thought the small part was being stupid). <br />
<br />
Anna for her part... wondered how many relationships would cease to exist like Kitty&#39;s and Susan&#39;s had, and they&#39;d never know, that part genuinely scared her. <br />
<br />
It should have been no one&#39;s surprise that they took a short cut. Sadly, short cuts lead to dead ends. <br />
<br />
What they found, was a middle aged man in dirty clothes with a five o&#39;clock with breath like an open sewer. <br />
<br />
&quot;H-Hey! You&#39;re that Everson guy! Spare some change?&quot;<br />
<br />
Curt, being uncharacteristically curt, took out a wall of dollar bills out of his pocket and tossed them at the man, and tried to race past him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey you stinking banker! I know you&#39;ve gotta have more than that on you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry but I have to-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Greedy banker pigs! Living your stupid high life!&quot; The hobo took a look around, and took out a bowie knife. &quot;Everything you&#39;ve got! Now! That means you two harem girls too! Take that dress all the way off foxy!&quot; <br />
<br />
Curt took a step back. <br />
<br />
The shadows around the alley way stretched out like fingers. Blue flames formed on the tips of Skyla’s tails. <br />
<br />
Curt and Anna startled, so did the mugger. <br />
<br />
&quot;We don&#39;t have time for you,&quot; Skyla said, a dark echo to her voice. &quot;Out of our way.&quot; <br />
<br />
Like a nest of snakes, Skyla&#39;s still flame tipped tails reached behind her, stretching towards the mugger. The man instinctively slashed with his knife but she pulled back one tail just in time, the other four came at different angles and obscured the mugger from view, the fifth joining in. <br />
<br />
Anna and Curt heard him cry out, first in panic and fear, but then in what could have been ... almost happiness. Then he began giggling, and then silence. <br />
<br />
Skyla pulled her tails back, the shadows and flames fading. <br />
<br />
Standing where the mugger had been, was now a stone tanuki statue that reached up to their knees. Standing on his hind legs, painted brown fur, a collection tray built into his base. Like any traditional tanuki statue, he was joyfully overweight! He had a yellow painted stone hat that was part of his body. There was a huge stone grin carved on his face, looking like he was on cloud nine. And between his legs, were his &#39;pouch&#39; that reached all the way down to his base, he was at attention in more ways than one. The money Curt had thrown at the mugger was now in the collection plate. <br />
<br />
Anna and Curt could almost fear a faint self-satisfied giggling still coming from the statue. Anna felt an impulse to give a donation to the good fortune statue just from looking at it! And Anna felt herself blushing at the sight of it.<br />
<br />
As for the figurine, he enjoyed the look the cat was giving him, and of course the money at his paws. <br />
<br />
“How did you do that?”  Anna asked, stunned.<br />
<br />
Curt was quiet, but internally echoing his sister.  He had seen Emma do magic before, and had seen the Asian dragon twins levitating when they got excited about something, but this was the first time he had seen Skyla use magic.  Before any of the other mythical maids were made, he had wondered if his friend had been changed into a real kitsune, or if the gun had just given her multiple tails to match her idealized self.  It seemed he finally found his answer.  <br />
<br />
“I think Skyla’s gained some transformation magic of her own,”  He finally said.  He shook his head, trying to get his priorities back in line.  “But forget how she did it!  What did you actually do?”  He turned to Skyla.  “He’s not dead, is he?”<br />
<br />
&quot;No, he isn&#39;t. I can&#39;t change reality. He remembers he was human, I just don&#39;t think he CARES anymore. He was thinking with his second head, and now he has it on automatic. He&#39;s a good fortune statue, so people are compelled to donate to him, he gets everything he wanted with none of the work. That grin on his face isn&#39;t for show.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Curt breathed a sigh of relief.  “Good.  I was worried we might have actually killed someone for a second there.  We’ll have to come back with the police when this is all over and change him back.”<br />
<br />
“Master, not to question your judgement, but why bother?  He’s clearly happier like this than locked up in a cell somewhere, and he’s not a threat to anyone, either.  Aside from maybe getting people to part with some cash.  Plus, he tried to stab you!  It’s way better than he deserves!”<br />
<br />
“You’ve got a point,” Curt said.  While Curt felt she was making sense, with everything else going on right now, he was feeling a lot more hesitant to trust Skyla’s rationale for anything.  “...But it just doesn’t feel right.  Let’s find those kids.  He’ll still be here when we get back.”<br />
<br />
&quot;As you wish Master,&quot; Skyla said, not ashamed of hoping that Master forgot about this, or that the statue was adopted by a shop owner. <br />
<br />
Anna meanwhile, just wanted to be away from the pervy statue.</p>
