<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Author&#39;s Note: Most of the main point on &quot;weres being exposed&quot; and Moon Lake&#39;s responses to what has happened to Lionel Ulysses has gone on in the Tad thread, and if you&#39;re looking for the responses... it&#39;d be best to check it out. These chapters here in the Anderson thread are merely covering the areas that build up to the actions and responses in the Tad thread and how they relate to what&#39;s gone on in the Anderson thread, since both are in Earth 1.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Samantha felt a bit frustrated as she pulled into her parking space near Moon Lake&#39;s City Hall building. She had been looking forward to at least ONE quiet Sunday where she wouldn&#39;t have to be too busy with things. A lot of her job focused on welcoming new people to Moon Lake and making the transition into were society for at least one member of the family as easy possible, but that wasn&#39;t all that she did, and right now with Martin Stovall absent, she had to take on a few extra duties. Right now, what had happened in Seattle had put her in a position where she was having to deal with both the extra work and some of the main duties that she typically would have to deal with.<br />
<br />
As Samantha got out of her car, she heard her cellphone ring and ring in a way that was almost urgent. She slowly moved to answer it. She expected some people to call the office phone as that was the number most people knew. Not too many people knew her cellphone number, and as Samantha answered it, she recognized the number as one of the people that DID have her cellphone number, Martha Anderson. She sighed and prepared to tell her that she didn&#39;t have time to chat at the moment. She would normally enjoy catching up with Martha and maybe finding out what had been going on next door as tactfully as she could manage, but her job and responsibilities came first. As she answered, she was surprised to hear a panicked voice speak very quickly through the phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not true is it?&quot; Martha asked, &quot;We haven&#39;t been exposed...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve seen the news...&quot; was all Samantha could manage in her surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it true? Have we been exposed?!&quot; Martha repeated her question. <br />
<br />
Her voice sounded very nervous. Samantha could hear William in the background and it sounded like he was trying to calm her, but not fairing that well. And that made sense, weres had done their best to stay hidden and avoid detection for the fears of what might happen if discovered. Much of her role in Moon Lake was to assure that secret remained a secret. Moon Lake did have plans for the likely inevitable revelation that weres were real, but it was hoped they&#39;d have concrete proof of acceptance before those plans were activated. Samantha also knew that new weres tended to be the most concerned, usually for the fact that they&#39;d joined to keep the secret and didn&#39;t want to be in a situation where they did it for nothing and didn&#39;t want to lose what they might have gained by becoming weres.<br />
<br />
&quot;We don&#39;t know for sure, yet, dear,&quot; Samantha said slowly as she collected herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can&#39;t let that happen!&quot; Martha stated quickly, &quot;you can&#39;t let anything bad happen!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Be assured that I will do my best to make sure that whatever happens that Moon Lake is safe,&quot; Samantha said slowly, &quot;You have nothing to worry about.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have PLENTY to worry about!&quot; Martha answered, &quot;this could hurt Eric!&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha nodded and she could understand her fellow werecat&#39;s worry there. Ben might not be hers and Frances&#39; son by birth, but they loved him dearly and she couldn&#39;t count the number of times they&#39;d worried over something that related to their son. Martha was worried about her youngest, who to Samantha&#39;s knowledge was still a Normal and could lose his older brother and both parents if the response to weres being revealed was negative.<br />
<br />
&quot;Things will be fine,&quot; Samantha promised, &quot;we try to keep things quiet and secret... but we do have measures in place for such a situation which we have had worked out for quite a long time and refined over the years. The plans should put us in the best possible light and will hopefully allow your family to stay together and that you won&#39;t be separated from a Normal son.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He isn&#39;t a Normal,&quot; Martha answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?!&quot; Samantha gasped, hoping they hadn&#39;t had another sort of incident like how William became a werefox.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eric&#39;s been dating Julie Stovall, she&#39;s the mayor&#39;s daughter,&quot; Martha began.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know who the Stovalls are,&quot; Samantha spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... he&#39;s been dating Julie and she&#39;s gotten out of his shell in a great many ways,&quot; Martha explained, &quot;they&#39;ve looked good and happy together. It&#39;s done a lot to help Eric grow and be more active socially. It&#39;s made me happy to see him happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha didn&#39;t say anything as she shut her car door and began to walk into City Hall as she listened to Martha continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;This past Friday they committed themselves to each other and Eric became a weremer, totally of his own volition,&quot; Martha continued, &quot;Julie didn&#39;t force him and she&#39;s made him so happy...&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha was still quiet for the moment, as while Martha was praising her son&#39;s relationship, there was still something that sounded like she wasn&#39;t at ease with the situation.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t want him to lose that happiness,&quot; Martha spoke, &quot;I don&#39;t want him locked in some tank and kept apart from Julie... not after he&#39;s come so far.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will do all that I can,&quot; Samantha promised, &quot;we have the plans to deal with weres being revealed... and if it does happen we will use them. You have nothing to worry about with regard to your happiness or Eric&#39;s. You have my promise.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Martha replied, sounding a bit better.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... and tell Eric congratulations for me when you can,&quot; Samantha told her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Will do,&quot; came Martha&#39;s answer, &quot;please keep us safe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll do my best,&quot; Samantha said with a sigh and hung up and walked along.<br />
<br />
She made her way in to find that there was a great deal of &quot;excitement&quot; going on. There were a fair number of phones ringing, which would go to answering machines as much of the staff had the day off or had reduced hours. Katherine Chambers, Moon Lake&#39;s Deputy Mayor, was coming from one of the other offices with a fresh cup of coffee that she had gotten. She noticed Samantha as she came in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Today&#39;s going to be hectic, I think,&quot; Katherine said slowly, &quot;my phone&#39;s been ringing off the hook with some nervous folks wanting to make sure Moon Lake is secure and that family members outside Moon Lake are okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Understandable,&quot; Samantha answered, &quot;has anything new come over the news yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think they&#39;ll actually show the press conference here in a bit... but nothing new has come about,&quot; Katherine answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... hopefully things work out,&quot; Samantha sighed, &quot;Has Chief O&#39;Hara come in yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, we&#39;ve been following things in our own press conference room,&quot;  Katherine sighed, &quot;If they decide to push the issue in the media... we may have to go to Plan In the Open.&quot;*<br />
<br />
&quot;If that happens,&quot; Samantha sighed, &quot;We&#39;ll be ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
* Plan In the Open will ultimately be fully explained in the Tad thread...</p>
