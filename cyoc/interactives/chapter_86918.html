<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff&#39;s brother happened onto the chronivac working with his brother listed as a jock strap wrapped around Ramon&#39;s balls and cock.<br />
<br />
He giggled.<br />
<br />
Noticing that it isn&#39;t just Jeff&#39;s profile that is on the screen but Ramon&#39;s as an attachment is listed as well.<br />
<br />
Now Jeff&#39;s little brother knew Ramon but didn&#39;t know that much about him. He knew that he was a huge beast of a man. At 327 pounds he most would call him fat but all the sports that he played gave him a musculature that could have been more associated with weightlifters than fat men. He didn&#39;t realize how hairy Ramon was either. He mostly saw Ramon in his sports gear not showing off much of his skin but from the bit of fur sticking out around his collar and his forearms it wasn&#39;t a stretch to believe he was furry all over. All that hair at Ramon&#39;s crotch had to be holding in the dribbles of pis and the caked on cum that didn&#39;t make it&#39;s mark and that had to be nauseating to Jeff. He would have assumed that Ramon was straight and there it was right on the screen he was straighter than any man could ever be. He was at the maximum on the scale of sexual preference toward straight. The size of Ramon&#39;s balls and cock were greater than average and were therefore stretching out his brother Jeff.<br />
<br />
He had a few ideas for both his brother and Ramon. His first change to Ramon was that he doubled the size of Ramon&#39;s cock and balls giving him a python that would have embarrassed any porn star. His balls were the size of bowling balls and damn did they drip cum constantly. Having resolved to keep the jock on for 3 to 4 weeks this would permeate Jeff and Ramon&#39;s pubic hair and by the time Ramon took Jeff off he would not only be use to it he would crave Ramon&#39;s cum. He changed Ramon&#39;s sexual preference completely to the other direction. Making him fully gay but without that hint of nellyness that most associate with being gay. He was still very much of a butch man he just craved men now which didn&#39;t do his dripping balls much for the next few weeks when he would see other men naked in the locker room.<br />
<br />
His next change was to his brother. He made it so that he would change back to human as soon as Ramon took him off. He changed his brother to slightly more straight than half way but having been worn by Ramon for 4 weeks he craved Ramon&#39;s scent, his size, his power. HE CRAVED RAMON. He would remember that he was spose to be straight but he couldn&#39;t help himself.<br />
<br />
As the weeks passed on Jeff was amazed at the amount of food Ramon ate. He wasn&#39;t surprised that he ate a lot, being the size he was didn&#39;t happen by accident but damn he was a human garbage disposal. That was when Jeff found out that Ramon got off on eating. He had done this before the changes but Jeff felt Ramon grow horny when he was gorging. Ramon was a gainer. And if he hadn&#39;t worked out so much he wouldn&#39;t have the muscle he had. He would be a big fat slob. Jeff seemed to be grateful for this. He wanted his man to be somewhat mobile but he grew to love Ramon&#39;s eating binges.<br />
<br />
It came one night that Ramon passed out after an all you can eat buffet and a case of beer. Peeling Jeff off he laid the stinky sticky jock on his chest as he went to sleep and in the morning, just as if it were always that way Jeff was resting next to Ramon holding on to his lover.<br />
<br />
Jeff woke with a start and looked into those big ebony eyes of Ramon and began to crawl up that mountain of a man and straddle his belly. Feeling Ramon&#39;s cock stiffen up he felt it poke at his back side and he knew what he wanted. The stress on him for so many weeks made his asshole easily accommodate the extra large cock balls deep. Ramon&#39;s cock could be seen poking at Jeff&#39;s abdomen. He rubbed the bulge as though he were caressing Ramon&#39;s cock without his ass caressing it. He was masturbating Ramon through his stomach wall this gave a reason for the stretch marks on Jeff&#39;s abdomen. It was really the weeks of wear but this made sense as to why he had stretch marks once he became human. Jeff would grab a handful of fur on Ramon&#39;s sides and pull himself up and down on the curve of his belly and becoming exhausted climbing the behemoth it took close to an hour before Ramon emptied the contents deep into Jeff&#39;s abdomen bloating him like a beach ball ready to fill Jeff when he produced the next load. Although he had dripped cum the last few weeks he hadn&#39;t really cum and filling Jeff really stressed Jeff&#39;s belly and finally emptied Ramon&#39;s balls.<br />
<br />
There was a curve now to Jeff&#39;s spine that happened due to Ramon wearing Jeff but that just gave Ramon&#39;s cock easy access to Jeff&#39;s ass and mouth. He could almost dislocate his jaw like a boa constrictor and swallow that cock whole.<br />
<br />
Jeff saw Katie from time to time and somehow knew he wanted her but he craved Ramon.<br />
<br />
And all recollection of the chronivac was erased from both Katie and Jeff&#39;s mind.<br />
<br />
His brother had better uses for the chronivac.</p>
