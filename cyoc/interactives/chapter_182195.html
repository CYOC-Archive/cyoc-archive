<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It had been 6 years since the previous events. Jade, Mark, and Tommy have lived happily during those 6 years, living calm lives. zThey were highly respected in their county, as the money they had brought helped them with improving the farm, which included mechanical milk pumpers, more stables, more cows, and most importantly, farm hands. <br />
<br />
Our new story begins on the fields, where Jade and Tommy sat eating their lunch. Tommy was having a grilled cheese sandwich with a side of Jade&#39;s milk, though he&#39;s still learning how to eat with his hands. He&#39;d get cheese all over his face, which made jade chuckle. She cleaned the cheese from off of his face by licking her massive tongue on him. &quot;There ya go, darling.&quot; she said. <br />
<br />
Tommy giggled and wiped his face with his hands. &quot;Silly mommy!&quot; he said, and continued to giggle. <br />
<br />
Jade craned her neck downwards to take another bite of grass. Tommy saw her do it, and thought it would be good for him too. He took his stubby arms and grasped the grass. He yanked the grass from off of the dirt and began to chew on it. Jade noticed him copy her and immediately swallowed. &quot;No, no, Tommy, spit that out!&quot; Jade said. Tommy stopped chewing and did the best he could to spit the grass out. Some still lingered in his mouth, but the majority was out of his mouth. Jade sighed. <br />
&quot;Do not do what mommy does, okay?&quot; she says. <br />
&quot;Why not, mommy?&quot; He asked. <br />
&quot;Because, mommy is a cow, and you&#39;re a baby boy! Now, eat your sandwich, or else mommy-cow&#39;s gonna eat ya!&quot; she replies, gently gnawing at his belly as he giggles.<br />
&quot;Okay, mommy!&quot; he says, giggling, as he takes a huge bite off of his sandwich.<br />
A few years before that, Jade would&#39;ve been embarrassed to admit that she was an animal. Nowadays, she says it on a daily basis. She still does know when to not talk when Mark has guests around, though. It&#39;s always a pain to be stuck with the rest of the cows for a whole day. There&#39;s nothing interesting going on except staring at grass and cow butts and udders for hours. But enough of that, Jade was getting side-tracked with her thoughts again.<br />
<br />
She does quite enjoy her &quot;new&quot; life as a cow, seeing as she&#39;s gone 6 years being one. As the farm changed drastically, so has her habits. Mark bought a lot more fields from his land owners which agreed he could expand. Mark bought a lot of equipment for the cows too, including Jade.<br />
<br />
She doesn&#39;t really like the auto-milkers. Something about they&#39;re suction just throws her off while she&#39;s being milked. Her udder teats feel sore whenever she&#39;s in the cups for more than five minutes, which she usually is with the amount of milk she&#39;s storing every few hours. Mark had hoped she would like it, but she explains to him that her teats were too sensitive for machines, whatever that meant. <br />
<br />
Her udder hadn&#39;t really gained in size as much. She never really gave it any attention when it came to anything else except milking or nursing. She was really good at that. She&#39;d spend the majority of her day either sleeping, watching TV, being milked, or eating. <br />
<br />
The farmhand Mark hired milk her well. Though, the new people always are a hassle to deal with. Sometimes they&#39;ll make a mistake and pull or squeeze too hard, which sends painful shivers down her entire body. She really likes being touched though. She doesn&#39;t know if it&#39;s instinct or for pleasure, but she really likes being touched, especially in her udder, probably because it&#39;s her most sensitive and hairless part. She does get horny at some times of the year, Mark just says that&#39;s her in heat. She&#39;d smell the scent of bull and go crazy for it for the rest of the day, or she&#39;d get kinky with Mark whenever it was his turn to milk her. Her udder would get noticeably more sensitive during her heat period, though. <br />
<br />
Her Barn changed a lot, too. She had to get a tag attached to her ear, which sucked, but it gave her special recognition to the farmhand that she&#39;s Mark&#39;s most precious cow. The farmhand never questions it, so she&#39;s alright with it. In fact, she&#39;s never been anywhere other than the farm in 6 years. She&#39;s been bothered by that ever since she&#39;s transformed, and Mark&#39;s hoping to do something about that.<br />
<br />
Mark&#39;s applied for this farm to be an educational sight in which schools can file field trip papers in order for bordering suburban town schools can go to to learn about the farm. Jade was the main attraction, and she&#39;d always loved being pet by all the kids who come. They even try and milk her, which she admits, they do try their best. Some of them are good at milking, while others are not too much. Sometimes, when she&#39;s not around for the kids, Rosie takes her place as the milk cow. <br />
<br />
That&#39;s right, Rosie, the calf that Jade birthed 6 years ago. She&#39;s a fully developed dairy cow now, and has been selected to breed with Kevin, their bull. She&#39;s had 2 calves so far, which were both sold into other dairy farms across Texas. She was somewhat proud of her, but she knew Rosie wouldn&#39;t care, so she didn&#39;t do anything bout it. Tommy had a good relationship with Rosie, and they&#39;d hang out with each other whenever Jade or Mark were busy.<br />
<br />
Anyway, she&#39;s been thinking and staring off into space for about five minutes now, and Tommy&#39;s all finished with his sandwich. Every time they have a picnic, Jade would always let Tommy suckle from her udder, usually just for the sake of him getting a little snack paired with his lunch. Usually, when they&#39;d be in her barn to watch a movie or something, Tommy would fall asleep on her, mouth still sucking on her udder, which was adorable. Though, his drool is kind of annoying at times, but he&#39;s too cute that you can&#39;t stay mad at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yay! Mommy milky time!&quot; he said, putting his mouth up to her teat and sucking away. &quot;Be gentle, now, mommy hasn&#39;t had her milking yet, and she doesn&#39;t want you to bounce on her that much.&quot; Jade said, cautious about her udder. Another thing with Tommy is that his teeth sometimes gets into the sides of her teat. She would grunt or moo slightly when this happened, but she managed to get through with it. They have thought of weaning him at some point, but they still don&#39;t know when or how. <br />
<br />
Ironically, Jade&#39;s milk production never seemed to decrease, even years after birthing her only calves. They have tried to  not milk her for a few days at a time, but it was simply too unbearable for Jade to endure, so they eventually had to milk her. Mark&#39;s promise was kept, as he helped her get through all of her troubles a s a bovine. Whenever she had tense or sore udders, she&#39;d get a massage from him, which made her moo in relief as the pain got soothed by Mark&#39;s skilled hands.<br />
<br />
Speaking of Mark, where was he? He missed lunch. As Tommy detached, full of Jade&#39;s milk, They quickly went searching for him. It was a weekend, so luckily, no farm workers were on duty, so they were free. Tommy dashed into the house, with jade trotting behind him. Tommy hadn&#39;t finished with the milk, so trotting was n annoying process. As Tommy opened the door to the inside, Jade waited outside, as her udder had been stuck there once before when it was extremely full, so she wouldn&#39;t take that chance ever again.<br />
<br />
Anyway, Moments later, Mark comes out with Tommy in his left arm and a Flier in the right. &quot;Mark, where have you been?&quot; Jade asked.<br />
Mark only had a smile on his face as he nodded, reading the paper. &quot;What?&quot; Jade asked again. <br />
<br />
&quot;You wanna go on a road trip?&quot; He finally asked.</p>
