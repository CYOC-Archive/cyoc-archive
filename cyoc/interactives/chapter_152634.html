<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Through the haze of sleep, I could feel the creeping need to use the bathroom.  It wasn&#39;t extreme, so I continued to lay down, grabbing my phone to check my sites while I woke up.  Friday evening had been uneventful until the evening, when Lucas managed to make me grow an udder by drawing it.  Thankfully, destroying the drawing did something, right?<br />
<br />
To my horror, a large lump jutted from my stomach as I lay on my side.  It was concealed by my sheet, but the telltale teats made it clear that it could be nothing else.  Why did I fall asleep immediately after destroying that picture, if it wasn&#39;t removing it?  I tossed off the sheets, and it was seemed even larger than before.  Worse yet, it sat much heavier than before.<br />
<br />
I heaved my body into a seated position.  The udder fought to stay on the bed, but with some effort I shoved it onto my lap.  I could see the beginning of veins on the sides of it, and while it was less sensitive to touching from the sides, the teats felt like they were in need of attention.  As I squished a hand into it, I realized the udder felt far more dense than before, and my need to pee immediately shot back into the forefront.  This cursed appendage wanted to be milked!<br />
<br />
I mentally spat at the notion.  I knew I would be a slobbering wreck if I tried to milk myself, and the entire process could easily take an hour between the near-orgasmic sensations I&#39;d experienced the first time around.  However, this caused me to realize I should really check how I was going to pee from now on.<br />
<br />
I moved my hand down the side of the taut udder, brushing its underside and exploring the area beneath.  As I moved my hand further down, I realized there was no way I still had by old genitals.  The udder&#39;s flesh had gone too far down, meaning my penis was definitely fused into this milk-filled organ now.  Or, I was now a female?  Taking great care, I moved my hand further down, exploring the area between the udder and my anus.  Disturbingly, I also found nothing but a brief section of skin.  I had no genitals to speak of, just a big cow udder?  Pulling my hand back, I was terribly confused.  Did burning the drawing remove my genitals?  If only I&#39;d checked before that.<br />
<br />
As I stared at this dastardly growth, something caught my eye.  My pants were still strewn on the floor, but there was something wrong with them.  I slipped off the bed and pulled the pants off the floor.  Instead of a zipper, there was a large swath of material missing at the crotch.  The upper hem has a long strip of material with a button at the end.  This thing was clearly designed to let me wear pants with this udder, but how was that possible?<br />
<br />
I looked around my room, and the closer I looked, the more things I found out-of-place.  One of my school books now had a black-and-white patterned cover.  There was a small toy cow on my dresser.  There was a small, but out of place pillow on my bed, laying at about where my groin would.  Even more curious was the empty gallon-sized mug with nothing in it on my desk.  <br />
<br />
As I continued to look around, I realized one of my wall pictures of me when I was 13 had a noticeable pink blob hanging from my crotch.  I grabbed my phone to verify this.  Going through my picture archive, all my photos that included my lower body now had the udder as well.  What&#39;s more confusing was that there were several pictures that I know I never took, including several closeups of the mammary.  There was even one picture with what was probably my udder hooked up to a machine of some sort, along with follow-up pictures of a milk-filled canister.<br />
<br />
What was all this?  It was like the world had changed with me, except now I apparently always had this milk-filled mass hanging off me.  Did this mean the world saw my misshapen form as normal?  Or, at least normal enough that I could be seen by others?  Was Lucas also affected by this?<br />
<br />
I needed to figure out what my life was, and based on the nagging sensation of pressure from my udder, I needed to find out fast.  I went to my dresser, and immediately noticed a complete lack of boxers or underwear.  I still had plenty of shirts, and the pants all had that stringy button-strap and gaping hole at the front.  I had fewer shorts than before, but they followed the same design.<br />
<br />
The shirt was no problem, but I couldn&#39;t see what I was doing when donning my pants.  After a few minutes of fumbling while standing on my own pants while trying to see around the udder, I gave up and took a seat to put them on.  The udder was still consuming an annoying amount of visual space, but with some dedication, I finally got them to about my waist.  I took the strip over my udder and buttoned it on the far side, creating a loop of denim around the ball of flesh.  It bit slightly into the udder at the top and I could feel space beneath, but it wasn&#39;t as bad as I would&#39;ve thought wearing pants with this over-sensitive thing was going to be.<br />
<br />
As I left my room in search of Lucas, I immediately began to feel parched.  Ignoring that for now, I checked on his empty room.  &quot;Lucas?&quot;  I raised my voice to let it carry through the house.  I heard a muffled &#39;yeah&#39; that sounded like it was downstairs.<br />
<br />
I waddled my way down the stairs, each step causing the udder to stiffly bounce into my legs before returning to proudly sitting in front of me.  The TV was on and I could see Lucas&#39;s head poking out from the middle of the couch.  On most Saturdays, I&#39;d spend a little while watching with him, so I walked around the seat and sat next to him.<br />
<br />
As I did, he turned to me with a confused look on his face.  &quot;Why didn&#39;t yo-&quot;  his eyes glided down from my face to the udder lazily sloshing on my lap. &quot;-woah!&quot;<br />
<br />
I quickly began to spin my head through the possible reasons for his reaction and what I could have done wrong, but it ultimately boiled down to two things.  Did he know the udder wasn&#39;t normal, or did I break my normal pattern in a world where my udder is normal?  I decided to keep quiet and give him a blank look.<br />
<br />
He began to giggle uncontrollably.   &quot;Didja forget to milk yourself last night, or this morning?  Mom says if you don&#39;t, it&#39;s just gonna keep getting bigger!&quot;  To emphasize this, he puffed out his cheeks while pantomiming toward my udder, pulling his hands away as if they were being pushed back by my ballooning udder.<br />
<br />
Seeing as he wasn&#39;t panicking, I could only assume the latter.  &quot;Well, do you want to play a game?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lucas looked to the television, then back to me.  &quot;Yeah!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, it&#39;s a pretty easy one.  I&#39;m going to give you the responsibility of telling me how to do my morning upkeep.  If you get it right, I&#39;ll got get fast food for dinner tonight.  If you mess it up, then I&#39;m going to remember it when I&#39;m cooking dinner tonight.  I want to see how observant you are.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lucas gave a huge smile.  &quot;Ooh, this is easy!&quot;  He jumped up, then dashed over to the kitchen, allowing me ample time to follow.  When I got there, he climbed on top of the counter, then opened a cabinet.  Instead of being filled with junk food like it used to be, there were now several piles of fairly large brown discs, each packaged individually.  &quot;You eat one of these before every meal, and...Uhh...Oh!&quot;  He slipped off the counter, then moved over to the sink, where there was another large mug.  &quot;You drink enough water to fill two of these every day!&quot;<br />
<br />
I was about to ask where I was getting all this water from, when I realized we now had a pretty heavy-duty water purifier next to the sink. <br />
 Was this why I was so parched?  I decided to take the moment now and fill the mug, just so I could get rid of this tremendous thirst.  In a matter of seconds, I&#39;d already downed nearly a third of the gigantic tankard.  Where did I even put it all?  I realized Lucas was waiting for me to finish, so I decided to continue with the tour.  &quot;Alright, anything else?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Duh!&quot;  <br />
<br />
Lucas led me to the back door, then went outside.  He moved along the side of the house until he came to a tarp.  After struggling with it alone for a few seconds, I helped him pull it off.  Beneath it was what I could only guess was a milking machine.  There were four suction cups leading to a device that was hooked to a canister, with several other canisters laying nearby.  A metal n-shaped bar stood out of the dirt, likely intended to be grasped while being milked.  Not too far away was a sideways refrigerator that seemed to be actively running.<br />
<br />
He waved at the machine.  &quot;Every morning after breakfast and every day after school, you use this.  Mom says you always sound very happy because it hurts to make as much milk as you do and keep it all in.&quot;  He looked around a bit, then refocused on me.  &quot;Um, I think that&#39;s everything.&quot;<br />
<br />
I considered the possibilities, looking down at the pink sac that had changed so much in my life.  I could accept it and just do what Lucas is talking about.  It really needed to get milked, and a milk machine shouldn&#39;t take too long.  Then again, I was very insecure about what I might say or do while being milked from all four barrels... I could alternatively try taking my chances with Lucas, and see if he remembered drawing me or was willing to redraw me without the udder.  But that got me into this hole, and it might just get me deeper.</p>
