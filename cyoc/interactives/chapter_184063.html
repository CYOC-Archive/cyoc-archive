<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Decidedly and to remain less visible to the passing traffic driving along the busy road, this lone bull stayed hidden, me  walking alone the rows of corn stalks. As I walked between the tall still corn plants as yet not cut down, reaped for the corn crenels, the smelling of the dry corn became tantalizing.<br />
<br />
Time was all I had as a bounty right then, so I stopped my slow strolled walking and stood giving some study ass how best to eat a cob filled with nutritious corn. Reminded quickly as to the lacking of hands to grasp and pluck the cob of corn, I was forced to do my plucking with lips to rip the cob free from the corn stalk.<br />
<br />
Once torn free from where it had grown during the summery months, it being then as late fall, the corn stalk was dry-dead. My talent at removing the corn cob was at best clumsy, as wrestling with the stalk I tore it from out the soft ground; to holding in my teeth its bounty of corn. Again I came face to face with the realization of how different it was to being an animal, rather than a hand dexterity human. I then dropped the long corn plant stalk and began pawing my right fore-cloven hoof to break away the leaf sheathed corn cob so that I could then munching, eat something to sustain my big body.<br />
<br />
Believe me, that eating at something lying loose to roll along the ground and lacking hands to grasp as hold it, is a torture to a human mind held captive inside the body of a new bull. As I already mentioned, there was nothing to do but ignoring of time spent while eating. I had no idea where to go, had no home, no parents, no friends to rely upon for giving me my needs; I stood as alone and highly vulnerable.<br />
<br />
Munched corn and the dry cob tends to make a bull&#39;s mouth as dry and the bull as a whole gets thirsty.<br />
<br />
Thirst is a driving urge that tends to degrade all rational thought, as then instincts, and the sniffing of the air offers a dull bovine mind suggestions. Walking became as wandering, the lower level of dusk light granting this bulky big bull some manner of anonymity. As walking became trotting, the wind and some faint scent of cows drew my nose to find and follow; seemingly alert to the fact as where there were cows, was as well water.<br />
<br />
In this situation instincts won the day over rational thoughts, as soon a barbwire fence came between a herd of Jersey milk cows and one thirsty, horny feeling bull. Wanting of water to drink and finding the scent of cows as something instinct-wise as desirable; I walked along the pasture fence to find, as come upon the farm buildings.<br />
<br />
A horse watering trough filled full  of clean and refreshing water became a full-on distraction. I gulped at the water, loving the cleanness of it as refreshing my taste buds and a dry tongue. I was reminded soon of my new and vulnerable self when an ignored lasso passed over my muzzle and clung then snug to my stoutly muscular neck was drawn up snuggly tight.<br />
<br />
Turning to see who held the other end to the rope, I heard the voice of a young person say, &quot;He is a beauty!&quot;<br />
<br />
A older as fatherly voiced man then reiterated his son&#39;s compliment of me and my perfect as pedigree Angus bull self as being a very healthy specimen. As then the rope grew taunt and I was led to the barn and put, given a stall to call my home if even it were a temporary home for the likes of the new me!<br />
<br />
The man and his son I never before then had met or knew, yet they looked at me as if I held some worth. We each eyed the other, or until the youth made a noted remark as to the size of my bovine bullish scrotum. He seemed amused greatly about the size of my balls; as was I liking the weighty feel and how they did swaying, bonk at my hind hocks when I would walk or trot.<br />
<br />
The father figure walked away, he leaving his admiring son to gawk at me in my bovine new body. As I eyed the teenager, I noted his stare. He came close and began petting my furred self, his hands tending to wandering closer down, as toward my bellied sheath. His touching where I was highly sensitive and delightfully sensual, worked to arouse my bovine cock to where the youth took to him stroking my male meat.<br />
<br />
Time was on his side and offered me a manner of self masturbating that until then my attempts had failed to gain anything but some trickled splatters of my pre. As the teen became more enthused with what was my new penis, or as on an animal it is referred to being a cock; he with his one free hand took to messaging my big balls.<br />
<br />
I soon realized my present sense of feeling horny as was pent, ready if mating to ejaculating my wealth of unspent semen.<br />
<br />
I stood mostly rigid, looking not at the youth coaxing my cock, but was looking, staring at a blank wood wall and trailing all my thought processes to relish the masturbating of me; it felt glorious!<br />
<br />
Suddenly, I felt what my bovine mentality suggested was the lips of a cow vulva, and from this instinctive sensation, my balls surged, as semen gushed forth. I felt the glorious surge boil out the end of my stout cock; hearing not a happy cow mooing, but heard the youthful teenager as coughing, choking, he had his mouth held over the end to my hot pink colored cock, was ingesting, drinking my spent semen. My roaring orgasm was spent quick-like, all done in one massive jetting action as was necessary for when a bull breeds with a nervous cow.<br />
<br />
I then had the mind worth to turn and  look back as down to where the teenager was seated beside my sheath and a fast dwindling bovine cock. He as well gazed a milky look up at me, not knowing what I might do, but never did he expect me to offer him a slight grinned smile as to my feeling of being sexually satisfied. As then if ever a bull had a good reason to laugh, I did a noticed chuckle, seeing my semen as plastered all over the face and dripping from the chin of a near drowned in semen foolhardy youth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Muroo,&quot; I did bellow as slowly turned toward the still seated youth. Our faces came into a close proximity, he nose to my muzzle. As if mothering a new calf, I began a careful licking of my spent semen from off the chin, lips, and nose of my new, as horny friend.<br />
<br />
Strangely, the youth teenager sat quietly and let me licking, clean his face.<br />
<br />
I finished the licking clean and so softly as affectionally did speak a low tone &quot;Muroo,&quot; what seemed to disturb the lad. The youth slowly drew his knees to him being in a kneeling position while still looking me in the face, as he spoke, &quot;Were you ever a person, I mean as a human being?&quot;<br />
<br />
Imagine then how he reacted when with another soft mooing by me that I did nod my head as to affirm a truth to his question put to me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like how, how did you become then as is a bull?&quot; The boy asked, and caused me to think, as with my right fore-hoofs I did draw the word &quot;Hello,&quot; in the loose sawdust covered barn stall floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, hello, you wrote the word hello,&quot; yelled the youth as his sense of panic made me then smirk a bovine sort of grin.<br />
<br />
As again I thought and scrawling, wrote my name and title, &quot;Frank Barnes, county medical examiner!&quot;<br />
<br />
That stunned my new friend to quickly stand up, as take a moment to stare at me, before he turned and ran out from the barn to do as say what I did not care, but it gave me reason enough to again chuckle.</p>
