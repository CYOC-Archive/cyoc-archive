<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">On the plane flying from Dover flew quietly when it left the city. On it, Simon Tree sat in his seat. There weren&#39;t many on the plane, as those that fled Dover typically fled to other locations nearer to the city. But the Kats in Dover never made it to the airport, and air travel wasn&#39;t stopped until after Jess and Sally&#39;s team arrived. So, Simon, tired of being raped by the lust driven Kats cleaned himself off and made it to the airport, figuring he&#39;d spend some time with his brother in Honolulu until things quieted down. He had been too poor to buy an individual dose of the Wise Vaccine, but since he didn&#39;t immediately transform he figured he was immune or the strain was one of the older ones that the Justin Vaccine blocked. So, he sat quietly in his chair.<br />
<br />
However, as the plane flew he began to feel slightly more uncomfortable. He began sweating and it grew worse the longer the plane flew. Eventually it got too much and he made his way toward the bathroom on the plane.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me, sir, we&#39;re going to be landing soon,&quot; a flight attendant said to him.<br />
<br />
He looked to her and a strange thought came to him, &quot;Man... I want to hump her so bad...&quot;<br />
<br />
Simon didn&#39;t know where that came from and slowly blushed and then said, &quot;I just need to wash my face.&quot;<br />
<br />
Simon then went into the bathroom and locked the door. He then looked into the mirror.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where did that come from?&quot; Simon wondered to himself, &quot;where did that sexy...&quot;<br />
<br />
Again he paused, quietly wondering where that came from but soon found his thoughts drawn to a physical sensation. He felt blood rushing to the organ between his legs and it began to grow hard, pushing against his underwear and pants.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the... why... why am I so horny?&quot; Simon wondered and looked down to see his growing erection rising up and out of his waistband and pushing against the material of his clothing. Simon had always had a rather large member, but the feeling coming from it now was different. It was growing almost painfully erect.<br />
<br />
&quot;Arrgh... were is that sexy attendant....&quot; Simon found himself saying, his voice filling with a powerful desire and lust, &quot;I... I... I want to mate her...&quot;<br />
<br />
And with that, he pulled his pants and underwear down to let his large member stand free in the bathroom. The room was feeling even warmer and Simon thought he saw calico colored fur starting to grow on his legs. Claws began to grow out of his hands and Simon felt a new sensation on his chest. His shirt felt tight. Simon looked down to see very feminine breasts begin to push out of his chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have breasts?&quot; Simon asked as he pulled his shirt apart creating an audible ripping sound to expose two B cup breasts that were covered in calico colored fur and were growing larger. Their nipples were hard with arousal and Simon brought up his hands to cup them as they grew and grew and grew. Playing with them as the passed a D cup  soon alerted him to another sensation between his legs. His testicles had not only shrunk but were pulling inside him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m becoming a Kat!&quot; Simon screamed as hir testicles were completely within hir and a vagina formed where they had been behind hir pens, which was rock hard and waiting to be rammed inside that attendant.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sir, you need to return to your seat!&quot; came a voice from outside the door. It was the attendant!<br />
<br />
Simon turned hir head to the door and was about to say something when the bones in hir face began to physically rearrange. Not only did they become softer and more feminine, but a feline muzzle pushed out of hir face and shi actually mewed as hir muzzle completed and hir ears moved to the top of hir head.<br />
<br />
&quot;I need...&quot; Simon began and then gasped, hir voice sounded more feminine and found herself leaning against the locked door as the pain seemed to move to hir spine and ribs. Hir now G cup breasts swayed in the air as hir spine began to lengthen and hir feet became the digitagraded rear paws of a cat. The bones seemed to snap and crackle as they changed and altered. Simon felt hirself losing her balance as shi leaned against the door and hir feet were pushed back. Inside hir chest shi could feel a new set of ribs forming. Shi was becoming a Kat, and hoped shi was a damn sexy one. Then shi felt hir spine lengthen into a long catlike tail.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sir, we&#39;re going to open the door, we have a key,&quot; the attendant spoke.<br />
<br />
Despite hir erection, Simon felt hir forelegs begin to grow and shi felt some pain in this. But once hir forelegs were fully formed, Simon knew what shi needed to do. Simon was now a Calico colored Short-Haired Cat based Chakat, and as shi settled onto hir four legs the attendant finally opened the door. The attendant looked at hir in surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;I need to fuck,&quot; Simon announced as the plane shuddered as it landed, Simon had stripped the attendant and positioned her under hir and prepared to mount her.<br />
<br />
And that was how the Hawaiian outbreak began.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The night went quietly for all the kids that were at Charlie and Sally&#39;s home while most of the others were either on the East Coast or were involved in controlling it. And as they slept peacefully, with either parents or other relatives checked on them occasionally. And the sun soon rose to begin waking up the Kat kids. In hir bedroom, Janice awoke to feel two things. One was the sun&#39;s rays coming in through hir bedroom window. The other was hir arms and forelegs wrapped around Snowflake. The young white Chakat was still asleep and actually seemed to purr in hir sleep. Janice remembered the sleepover that Snowy agreed too after their adventure to Philly with Raul&#39;s team. They spent time talking before Janice pulled hir best friend outside of Pinkie and who shi wanted as hir future mate into a hug and rolled onto hir side and fell asleep.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning sleepyhead,&quot; Janice whispered into Snowflake&#39;s ear before licking the young white Chakat, as if grooming the back of hir ears with hir tongue.<br />
<br />
That successfully woke up Snowflake, who smiled to find hirself walking up in Janice&#39;s arms and forelegs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning, Jan,&quot; Snowflake using an abbreviated version of Janice&#39;s first name.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jan?&quot; Janice asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... your grandma&#39;s a Kat now too and I think shi said shi was going to be staying with us here in Janace and you were named for hir...&quot; Snowflake began to explain.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s different variations on the same name,&quot; Janice pointed out, &quot;Grandma is Janace. J-A-N-A-C-E. I am Janice, J-A-N-I-C-E. Similar, yet different.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Snowflake nodded, &quot;but it&#39;s still the same name. I figured I&#39;d call you Jan and that way we know which one of you is which based on what is said... especially when whoever is talking to one of you isn&#39;t looking at you...&quot;<br />
<br />
Janice only shrugged and let Snowflake get up. Shi then felt one ear twitch as a voice said &quot;grandma?&quot; in one of the other rooms. That was either Reca or Diamond. The two of them were quick to get up and get dressed, with Janice loaning Snowflake one of hir shirts. They also made sure that they didn&#39;t step on Foxy and Silky who were sleeping on the floor in the room. They didn&#39;t wake up during the conversation between Janice and Snowflake, but then Janice knew hir cousins were very sound sleepers. Once dressed, they made their way into Reca&#39;s room, and found that it was Reca who had spoke. Shi was actually laying on the bed given to Janace and Diamond was in Reca&#39;s bed, and Reca&#39;s cries for grandma had woke hir up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey guys, let&#39;s keep it down,&quot; Janice said to Reca an offered hir hand to Reca and then another hand to Diamond. &quot;Not everyone is up yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is grandma back?&quot; Reca asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not yet,&quot; Snowflake told hir, &quot;I think the stuff on the East Coast was big enough that they&#39;ll be gone for awhile.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m hungry,&quot; Diamond announced.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then let&#39;s go get some breakfast,&quot; Janice lead hir sithers to the door. Shi&#39;d show that shi was a good big sis and responsible.<br />
<br />
They made their way to kitchen and dining area. They had to make their way around some of the other kids that were there. Some of them were kids that Charlie and Sally had adopted over the years as part of their shelter while others were the kids of the Kat Kops. Janice got a particular kick out of seeing where hir sither fell asleep. The television was still on, now showing a morning news program, and on the couch, Pinkie was cuddled up to to Alia on the couch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe we&#39;ll have a double wedding,&quot; Snowflake whispered to Janice, &quot;When we grow up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Janice nodded and giggled.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean double wedding?&quot; Reca asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re getting married? Like Midnight?&quot; Diamond asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;When we grow up we will,&quot; Janice answered softly, &quot;but that will be when we grow up. For now... we&#39;ll simply date... and let&#39;s not wake them up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Reca and Diamond looked over to the couch and shrugged, &quot;Okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
They settled into having various bowls of cereal and many of the others also got up and joined in. It left the boxes out on a counter and Janice and Snowflake ended up playing &quot;ground control&quot; to help their sithers and the other kids that were present with them as they got ready for breakfast. Some of it created a great many smiles as Mary and Fluffy were fairly close to Alpha and Centuri as well as Shasta and Heather. Ryles and Casey&#39;s older soughters also sat with them and it did create some confusion, and Janice felt a little overstretched, even with Snowflake, Pinkie, Silky, and Foxy&#39;s help once they got up. Jezza helped, but shi also seemed hesitant to do anything with children that weren&#39;t hir own. Some of this ended though when Flake, Alexis, Talia, and Midnight arrived.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look momma! Cereal!&quot; Tres announced holding up hir bowl and spilling a little milk onto the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Janice made it for us,&quot; Sert added, presenting hir own bowl to Flake and Alexis.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Flake came forward and gently got Sert to set hir bowl back on the table while Alexis did the same for Tres. Shi then looked up to Janice who was seated next to hir cousin, &quot;Thank you dears for your help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just doing what we can,&quot; Janice said politely.<br />
<br />
&quot;And show we&#39;re big gurls,&quot; Snowflake added.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I bet you are,&quot; Flake smiled, &quot;and with all this I bet you&#39;ll be great parents when you grow up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Janice and Snowflake both gave happy grins at the praise.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you want some cereal, momma?&quot; Tres offered a spoonful to Alexis.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your dad and I already ate,&quot; Alexis said politely, &quot;Did you two have a good night?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeth...&quot; Tres answered after taking a bite of hir cereal, &quot;we played truth or dare with Tris and Sirt.&quot;<br />
<br />
Danna and Mikkie&#39;s children smiled at the memory of the game.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...&quot; Alexis asked, &quot;anyone dared to plan out their future families?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tres, Tris, Sert, and Sirt all looked at each other in an odd way and then looked to Alexis in an puzzled way. Unlike Janice, Pinkie, Silky, and Foxy they hadn&#39;t developed any real romantic interests yet, but Alexis, Flake, Danna, and Mikkie all had running bets on which of their soughters fell in love with each other, or whether or not they&#39;d fall in love with a kid or kat they met in school.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll know when you&#39;re older,&quot; Flake finally said patting Sert on hir back.<br />
<br />
&quot;You two did rather well,&quot; Midnight said to Janice and Snowflake.<br />
<br />
&quot;We did our best, sis,&quot; Janice said to Midnight.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you know how our parents are doing?&quot; Snowflake asked, wondering why Snowy didn&#39;t come to check on them.<br />
<br />
The adults then traded glances.<br />
<br />
&quot;It would appear that they&#39;re getting the East Coast under control, but one fled Dover on an airplane headed for Hawaii,&quot; Talia said, &quot;and we&#39;re organizing teams to go...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Teams?&quot; Snowflake asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mina and I will be staying here to help look after all the kids, Ryles and Casey left on some secret mission, and Gloria will be waiting for our prisoner from New York, but Maurice, Snowy, Alexis, Midnight, Talia, Ronnie, and Timothy Chakat will be the adults going,&quot; Flake said slowly, &quot;but since it looks like all of Hawaii could fall victim to this... we may need additional help...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll help!&quot; Janice volunteered, &quot;Snowflake and I helped in Philadelphia!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Without permission,&quot; Flake commented sternly and then sighed, &quot;but given the size we will be needing numbers...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Janice, Pinkie, Silky, Foxy, and Snowflake, you will be coming with us, it&#39;ll be your first official mission,&quot; Midnight spoke firmly, &quot;but you&#39;re to stick with the adults in each team and you aren&#39;t to stray far from where we can protect you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But... sith (pronounced seethuh),&quot; Pinkie began, &quot;You were twelve on your first mission...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that was only because there was no one else who could go,&quot; Midnight answered, &quot;dad didn&#39;t want me in danger and nearly stressed hirself into giving birth when I was urged to go.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fluffy and Mary actually gave a cheer, thinking Midnight was referring to their actual birth, which came later.<br />
<br />
&quot;And we want you to stay safe,&quot; Talia spoke, &quot;My mate may have been twelve... but these missions can be dangerous and full of things even you are presently too young to see.&quot;<br />
<br />
The twelve year old Kats selected for the mission gulped and then nodded and followed Alexis, Talia, and Midnight out.</p>
