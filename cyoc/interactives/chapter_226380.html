<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You hold the wheat crystal up close, turning it this way and that as the sunlight dances across its glittering facets. A strange sense washes over you as you peer into its luminous depths, almost as if something resonates in response.<br />
<br />
Lost in its mesmerizing light, you almost forget where you are for a moment. The impatient whine of a child waiting for their gift jolts you back to reality. You give your firm shake, and the fuzzy ox head shakes comically again, casting off the crystal&#39;s strange effect. With a bemused grin beneath your costume mask, you toss it lightly back into the bountiful sack.<br />
<br />
Plunging your hand in once more, you retrieve a proper &quot;red pocket&quot; and toss it to the beaming child. But after the kids are satisfied, your curiosity gets the better of you. Sneaking one last glance at the crystal, its luster now seems a pale, translucent white.<br />
<br />
A strange unease flashes through your brain. You chalk it up to the light and shrug it off, squaring the broad ox shoulders padding with determination. There is still work to be done, and you won&#39;t let any foolish fancies distract you now. <br />
<br />
Just then, a booming voice cuts through the din of the crowd. &quot;Hahaha, nothing can forever contain me, Niu the Ox! I&#39;m back again!&quot; You recognize the playful, spirited tone even without seeing the speaker. Clearly, someone is in high spirits. You didn&#39;t pay him any attention and focus on your task as a costumed performer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everything&#39;s all topsy turvy - where has clumsy Niu found himself?&quot;<br />
&quot;Why&#39;s that fuzzy face so familiar? Does this outfit resemble my own form, yet your shape differs greatly! Are you mimicking old Niu for amusement?&quot;<br />
&quot;The little peeps are out to play just like the old days! HELLO friends, come give old Niu a nuzzle!&quot;<br />
&quot;Aww shucks, they can&#39;t see me at all. What magic is this that holds me here now? If only I had listened when Shu spoke of, but all grows hazy...&quot; <br />
<br />
Whoever said that, seems to be overly enthusiastic. You should barely hear anything through the thick fabric, except for this annoying voice that keeps pestering you. His voice is so loud and piercing that it makes your tired brain, which is reluctant to turn, begin to think.<br />
<br />
Stranger how it seems to come from everywhere. One moment by your left ear, then above as if floating on the breeze. You strain to spot its owner through the costume&#39;s limited viewport but see no sign of them. Moreover, this hyper tourist stirs no reaction in the crowds or staff, which his impossible volume should already defy the laws.<br />
<br />
A familiar knot of dread tightens in your stomach. You remember that you had a slight stomachache before, maybe you overestimated your physical fitness and start hearing things?<br />
<br />
No, you refuse to believe it, and you&#39;ve never let doubt or fear slow you down before. With the resolve of an athlete, you shrug off any silly notions of hallucination. Tracking this mystifying voice for the truth, nerves of steel guide you where others may flounder in fear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Moooo, Clever Niu believe he has cracked this at last! I must be taking part in a recreation of the old solstice rituals. That splendid suit of my faithful candidate pays tribute to me, just as before, our purpose holds - to spread joy and happiness for all the people. Filling their days and the world with thrive, after all!&quot;<br />
<br />
You hear his latest words, and you feel a shiver run down your spine. You ignore the unease prickling your skin and quickly turn your head to the source of the voice. But you are not prepared for what you see. A translucent ox is floating in mid-air, right above you. It has a faint color of wheat throughout its form and gazes proudly at you. His massive form dwarfs you and your ox mascot suit. He looks like a ghostly version of the ox.<br />
<br />
It should be impossible, but you can see the bull smiling. He beams at you cheerfully and strides towards you as if he is walking on air. &quot;What an honor to be represented by such an upstanding soul! Together we will surely sustain this land&#39;s prosperity for years to come.&quot; <br />
<br />
Your fear comes true, not only are you hearing hallucinations, but also seeing them!<br />
<br />
&quot;Now take a closer look, this design is actually not bad, although it doesn&#39;t fit with mighty Niu&#39;s appearance, it still captures my verve. There was a word my little brother used once...ah yes, artistic! Your suit captures the artistic spirit splendidly.&quot; He smiles warmly in gratitude, oblivious to your horrified stare beneath the mask. <br />
<br />
You act recklessly before thinking. As if you want to get rid of the hallucinations, you move your hands forward with all your strength, trying to push away the giant ox who calls himself Niu. But you feel nothing, your hands go through him as if he is made of air. Instead, you lose your balance and stumble forward. You try to regain control of your body, but the cumbersome mascot suit is hindering you. <br />
<br />
As you trip over your hooves boots, balance slips from your weary frame. You pitch forward, vision tunneling towards an up-close greeting with the ground. <br />
<br />
&quot;Worry not, my little candidate, help is nigh!&quot; booms Niu&#39;s jovial and confident voice close behind.<br />
<br />
You could sense him rushing to you, and glimpse a blaze of wheat-gold light filling your constrained view. You are completely overlaid by him, wisps of radiance curl around the whole mascot suit, slowing your fall into a gentle arrest. <br />
<br />
A strange warmth washes through your tired muscles, different from the trapping heat inside the mascot suit, this warm your from the soul, not unpleasant but welcoming even.<br />
<br />
However, the suit is the opposite, where flexibility now feels as rigid as a statue. Its weight increased drastically, resembling the solid weight of a true oxen rather than fuzzy fabric. Trapped stiffly, you marvel that this bizarre new heft doesn&#39;t crush your frame.<br />
<br />
Although the suit remained thankfully intact, its new rigidity concerned you more than any damage.<br />
<br />
Your musings were cut short as two meaty fists rose of their own accord, waving in an overly exuberant greeting. Panic fluttered in your chest - this oversized garment had become animated without your consent!<br />
<br />
Before fear could fully take hold, Niu&#39;s exciting tones rang out. &quot;Fret not, little guy, the show must go on! The real Niu will showcase his talents to the crowds. This will be the best ritual ever in their lives!&quot;<br />
<br />
His words brought no comfort - you were not merely watching but had become an unwilling participant. The suit was possessed by that thing now! Awaiting your doom was not your style, you tried twisting, throwing your weight against it. But it was like hammering steel with your bare hands, all this futile effort would eventually wear you down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nay, nay, settle yourself kiddo, stop tickling me!&quot; laughs Niu, as if you are playing with him.<br />
<br />
You are mad and you decided to try again even harder this time. However, a warmth pulsed through the suit once more, tightening every padded contour until not an inch remained free of its grasps. Paralyzed within, you could only stare helplessly through the costume&#39;s slitted eyes.<br />
<br />
Within the encompassing suit, anger rose as helplessness set in. When you try to roar out, the paddings expand to the point where it threatens to fill your mouth, muffling any sound.<br />
<br />
Trapped in stifling silence, you strained to regulate heavy gasps. Yet within moments, a strange synchrony emerged - the padding pulsed in time with each of your breaths, each beat releasing a soothing warmth sensation, it reminds you the massage after heavy trainings. Discomfort ebbed as this bizarre squirming of the suit continued, steadying frazzled nerves.<br />
<br />
Outside, Niu cavorts energetically to roaring applause You feel the suit moving on its own, making you dancing around. His joyful antics earned people cheering and clapping, somehow you found solace. <br />
<br />
You think back to what Niu said, perhaps this was just ritual performance in his eyes, he will back to wherever he should . If he is playing this role brought smiles, he will also kind to you?</p>
