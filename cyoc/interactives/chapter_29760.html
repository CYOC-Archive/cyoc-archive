<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><P>The flight back to Samantha's would have been more enjoyable if Tricia wasn't preoccupied wondering what her friend had in mind. What did she mean about needing a direction? That didn't matter to Tricia, as long as she was in a form of her own design that stood out from other people's ideas of fantasy creatures.
<P>Once back in Samantha's house, Samantha took the remote from the hallway table where Tricia had left it. She glanced around, frowning. "Let's make this place a little more comfortable. I feel really cramped in here." She shot the living room with her remote and the area widened considerably. The entire first floor gained floor and ceiling space. The ceiling was about fifteen feet high now, and although the items in the room hadn't grown, they were spaced out enough so that Samantha and Tricia could flex their wings without worrying about hitting walls or knocking over anything. After adjusting the world acceptance settings to avoid panicking anybody who just saw the house grow from the outside, Samantha took a good look at her friend.
<P>Tricia nervously twitched her long tail. She felt it tickle as it scraped the backs of her ankles. "Well?" she said at last.
<P>"I'm thinking," Samantha said. "You said even though you came to the decisions arbitrarily, you still like what you are now?"
<P>"Yeah, for the most part," Tricia responded. "But now I'm starting to feel like these wings are just in the way. I liked flying before, but I wouldn't want to have them all the time."
<P>"That's easily changed," Samantha said. She punched a few buttons and zapped Tricia, and then watched as the bat wings shrunk into her backside. Tricia walked around a little.
<P>"Ah, that's better. They were really heavy."
<P>"I'm just getting started," Samantha said. "To find the direction that you really want to go in, I think first we should take you farther down the one you've already picked. We'll see if you're truly ready for what a form like yours has to offer or if it's actually something that bothers you."
<P>"Okay," Tricia said, not quite understanding what she meant. She plopped down on the couch as she patiently waited for Samantha to input her complex instructions into the remote. "I'll call this RBCow2," she said, hitting Save. "Ready?"
<P>"Not really," Tricia said nervously. Her response was met with a white flash from the remote. She stood up in surprise, waiting to feel her first changes.
<P>Her clothes tightened. Her body was toning itself up, but subtly. She retained her feminine curves, but a small bit of extra muscle and fat was added, giving her a stronger frame. Her thighs strained her shorts, but it was still tolerable. Her shell top was another matter. Her breasts were growing continuously, making very visible impressions in the dark red fabric.
<P>"Oh, I took the liberty of making your bra disappear so you wouldn't be too uncomfortable," Sam mentioned with a sly smile on her face.
<P>"Sam! What are you doing to me?!" Tricia gasped. Her feet changed next, sending her off balance. She hit the floor on all fours, and her hair fell about her face, blocking her vision. Her feet felt like they were being stretched, as did her tail. It grew thicker, forcibly expanding the hole in her shorts as it changed. She felt her face being pulled as well, and a familiar headache setting in, but even worse was the strange feeling she was getting in her chest.
<P>Her breasts were straining her top, and her entire chest area was flooding in warmth. It was an eerie feeling, and strangely pleasurable. Her back strained as the weight of her breasts increased. She couldn't handle the constriction any longer. Her breasts were on fire. She grabbed her top and tore it off. Its thin back straps broke easily. Relief of one kind, however, was replaced by discomfort of another. She felt a pressure inside her breasts. Her mind was telling her they were full. Full of what? She was starting to feel afraid of what was happening to her body, but there was also a part of her that was enjoying the changes and the new sensations emerging from this transformation.
<P>Still hunched over on the floor, Trish bravely inspected her new, strange changes with one hand. When they touched her large breasts she realized how sensitive they were. A shiver overtook her momentarily. She was still mostly blinded by her red hair and couldn't see much of anything else. Just as she was feeling the changes subside, she received another zap from the remote. She coughed at the sudden constraint placed on her neck, but she wasn't choking. Something, whatever it was, had just caused her neck to feel tight. She brought a hand to it and heard a hollow rattle. Her fingers fell upon something large and metallic.
<P>"Wh...what...," she coughed. Her voice sounded a touch deeper, and for some reason she found it harder to speak clearly. Her tongue wasn't able to move the way she wanted it to. "What did yooou dooooo?" She couldn't believe how cowlike her voice had become. It felt much easier to make a mooing sound instead of words.
<P>"I've made you into the monster you think you're supposed to be," Samantha said with a grave inflection to her voice. Something about it told Tricia that she wasn't completely satisfied with what she had done to Tricia.
<P>Slowly, very slowly, Tricia stood up. Her hind legs had morphed completely into those of a cow. The red horse-like feathering that was there had become comically exaggerated. Now it was so long and thick it completely covered her hooves and rested on the floor. The same had happened to the feathering on her forearms. The red tufts of soft fur had grown so long that if she held her arms to the sides, they would easily cover her entire hands from view. Hands which now had become less flexible. The two fingers now resembled two separate freely-moving halves of a real hoof. She guessed she'd have a hard time picking anything up with them now. The fully-hooved digitigrade legs she now possessed gave her a taller stance. She guessed she was over six feet now. Sam was clearly shorter than her when, before, they were about the same height.
<P>"If you can make it, come on upstairs. I've got a full-length mirror in my room." Samantha lead the way as Tricia slowly plodded across the floor. The weight of her full breasts made things a little difficult, not to mention her dragging tail and unfamiliarity with walking on hooves. She almost fell over twice before reaching the stairs, and made generous use of the railing as they ascended. The bell she knew was attached to her neck clattered obnoxiously. When they were finally in Sam's bedroom, Tricia couldn't believe how much she had changed...or, rather, to what extent Samantha had decided to change her.
<P>She was taller and slightly more muscular all right. Her frame represented a cow's just a bit better while retaining a pleasing human woman shape. But her features were insane. Not only were her breasts much bigger, there were FOUR of them. Two rows of two. That explained why her chest felt so weird. Her top had fallen off before, but now she saw that she was without clothes altogether. Her breasts each had a red fleshy teat that stuck out three inches.
<P>On her neck was a red leather collar with a golden cowbell which rested on her ample cleavage. She noticed her name was inscribed on it, and there was no buckle or any kind of fastener to the collar. It was removable only via remote.
<P>Her face was changed. She now had a half-human/half-cow muzzle, with flattened nose and protruding jaw. A gold nose ring was embedded in her nostrils. She had grown a new pair of red horns. These were more centered on her forehead while her old ones remained off to the side.
<P>Her hair had grown much longer. Or, rather, she had grown more of it. New follicles had grown all down her backside, creating a horse-like mane of fiery red hair that cascaded down her entire back and almost touched the floor. Red hair also had invaded her face a bit. It was growing from her temples down to her cheeks. Her shoulders and collarbone were encircled with a slightly shorter--but no less red--mane.
<P>Finally, her tail was literally doubled in size. It was so thick she couldn't hold it and touch her fingers to her thumb, and it trailed behind her by about four feet. Its end cuff was as thick and furry as ever. She couldn't do much with it except twitch it very slightly. Otherwise it was dead weight.
<P>She was a little upset that she wasn't clothed. Sam could easily have given her fitting garments, even though now a decent portion of red hair had grown to cover her privates. Her nipples--or teats--were exposed. She felt very strange about this development. Her breasts were sending painful signals to her brain now, telling her she was in need of some kind of relief.
<P>"What hafff...hafff...what hafffff yoooou dooonnne?" she struggled to ask. "Whoooooy naaaked? Whoooy bellll?" Trish decided it was more efficient to say the important words if it was going to take this long to talk out loud.
<P>"I took your changes to their extremes," Sam replied. She approached Trish and took a furry arm in her own. "I've made you a bona-fide cow demon. Clothes are just another way of hiding yourself. As for the bell...well, I felt like having a little fun. While you were changing, I made one for myself. See?" She flicked her own small round bell on her black collar and it jingled softly. "You may or may not like this new body of yours, but that's the point. Now you can see yourself in somewhat the same way you want others to see you. Deformed. Abnormal. But what was acceptable to you might have looked as ridiculous to them as you do to yourself now. Understand?"
<P>Tricia was beginning to realize what Sam was getting at. She saw the monster in the mirror and understood that this was the reaction she wanted from the public. Fur and horns and a tail hadn't bothered her before, but this was beyond the kind of strange that she herself found acceptable. Four breasts? Nearly useless fingers? A tail that was more a hindrance than a stylish accessory? All these ridiculous amounts of red hair?
<P>"Chaaange baaoook."
<P>"I will, I promise," Samantha said. "But you need more time to sort out what you like and don't like about this body. I might know where to start..." Her paw slowly and purposefully slid to Tricia's closest breast as Tricia began to realize what was about to happen.</p>
