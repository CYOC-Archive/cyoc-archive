<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">October made her way back to her house, walking along the empty streets. She finally arrives home, she carefully opens the door. She doesn’t sense anyone so she makes her way in, quietly closing the door behind her, she makes her away across the room and to the stairs. She takes one final look around before heading upstairs. She climbed the stairs, cautious not to make enough noise to alert her parents. She made it into her room, whereupon she grabbed the book off of her desk. She made her way back downstairs. As she got to the bottom, she sensed someone there. She was apprehensive to go any further, then she heard a voice,<br />
<br />
“October, I know you’re there,” a familiar voice said. October let out a sigh of relief, then suddenly a small panic set in, “you’re still in big trouble, I can’t live like this,” revealed was her father. Stirring a cup of tea with a magical mist. He was still huge. He was wearing an large button up shirt, it was straining against his body as he stood there. His belly was bloated, even his butt was big. His muscles though, they were large. Covered by a layer of fat, they were still clearly there. October didn’t much care for genitalia most of the time, but she could see her father’s manhood through the unbuttoned jeans he was wearing. She only saw it through her peripheral vision. <br />
“Father, I am working on fixing you,” she said,<br />
“I know you are, but what you’ve done to me and your mother is awful,” he said, “though, it is nice to have some muscles for a change,” he said. He waved his hand, causing the mist to carry the cup of tea to the counter and set it down nicely, “watch this,” he said. He walked over to the couch, he leant down, his knee pushing into his belly, and with one hand he grabbed the sofa and easily pulled it up. He picked it up like it weighed little to nothing, then he placed it back down in the same manor.<br />
“Maybe you should start doing more exercise when I fix you,”<br />
“Yeah, maybe I will. I’ll let you get on with whatever you’re doing, and don’t stay up too long. Of course I want you to fix me and your mother, but don’t wear yourself out,”<br />
“Yes, of course,”<br />
“I’m heading off to bed, call if you need me,” he said. He waved his hand towards him, the mist carried the tea back to him, following him as he made his way up the stairs.<br />
<br />
October walked over to the bookshelf, taking one hand off the book, she tapped the bookcase with her finger. A noise of unlocking was heard and October made her way down the stairs.<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------<br />
<br />
She sat herself down at one of the desks in the room, she had the book open on the right of her. She started grabbing ingredient after ingredient, mixing them as the book instructed. Hoping to get this perfect, not to mess anything up. She was finished. She took the powdery substance she had created and put it into a little drawstring bag, she placed the bag in her pocket and proceeded to the next step.<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------<br />
<br />
“October?” A sleepy eyed girl said, opening her door, yawning as she did, she had long brown hair, blue eyes and looked to be the same age as October,<br />
“Don’t question it, she didn’t say anything to me either,” another girl said from behind October, “she didn’t even let me get changed,”<br />
“Chelsea, you need to help me. I need your help with a spell I’m casting,”<br />
“Can we do this another time, October. I’ve kinda got... a friend over...”<br />
“Chelsea!” The girl behind October yelled in a excited kind of way,<br />
“Yuri!” Chelsea said, punching her in the arm,<br />
“Oww...” She whined,<br />
“Now you’ve...” Chelsea quickly moved her door and looked into the room next to her, she moved head down in a frustrated way, “woken him up,”<br />
“Chel, What’s going on?” A male voice said, he poked his head around the door. He had short ginger hair, a very teenager looking beard, the same colour as his hair, and he had green eyes.,<br />
“Nothing, this is... I mean...”<br />
“I’m October, this is Yuri,” October said, “I need to borrow your girl... friend, for help with a spell,”<br />
“A spell?” He asked,<br />
“October. He doesn’t know anything about magic,”<br />
“Magic?” He stated, “what do you mean magic? Is this some weird joke because I’m not gullible enough to fall for this,”<br />
October looked him in the eyes and snapped her fingers. All of a sudden a bright light appeared in her hand, she held it up. He looked at it. It wasn’t connected to anything, it was just... floating.<br />
<br />
“Chelsea, grab a coat, you’re coming with us. It will only take a few minutes when we’re back at my house,” October said. She began walking down the steps that lead to Chelsea’s house and onto the street, Yuri following her.<br />
Chelsea let out a long sigh. She grabbed a coat from her coat rack and looked at the red haired boy, “Kelvin, stay here. I’ll be back in a little bit, just don’t break anything, my parents will kill me,” she said, making her way out to the house.<br />
“Um, no.” Kelvin said, “no no no, you’re not making me suddenly know magic is real then just walk off, I want to see this,”<br />
“No. You’re not coming. I have no idea what’s going to happen, October is useless when it comes to explain what’s going on, so it could be dangerous,”<br />
“What’s makes you so good at dealing with, are you a witch,” Kelvin asked, semi-sarcastically,<br />
“Maybe I am,” Chelsea responded in a sarcastic tone,<br />
“I’m coming whether you like it or not.” Kelvin said. He stepped out to the house and closed the door,<br />
“Wait, I don’t have keys on me,”<br />
“What,” Kelvin said, he looked at the door, then back at Chelsea, “looks like I am stuck with you,”<br />
Chelsea sighed before walking off. Kelvin quickly tried to keep up with her.<br />
<br />
Chelsea and Kelvin made their way back to Yuri and October, who were walking together, talking.<br />
“So what exactly are we doing, October,” Chelsea asked,<br />
“Yeah, please explain it to us this time,” Yuri added,<br />
“Okay, well. My made a potion that was supposed to increase height but I got it slightly wrong and my parents drank it and now they look... well they look... they don’t look too good,”<br />
“You poisoned them!?” Yuri said in shock,<br />
“No, I didn’t poison them. They have just been physically changed, and I’m hoping they aren’t mentally changed by the time I manage to fix them. It’s much harder to fix a mental change over a physical one,”<br />
“So why did they drink the potion,” Kelvin asked,<br />
“Well, my basement has a...” October stopped, she looked up, “okay, we’re here.” October pointed to her house.<br />
<br />
The four of them made their way to the front door, October closed her eyes and stayed silent, she then opened them, “it’s clear. I’m pretty sure both my parents are asleep,” she said, she unlocked the door and made her way inside, motioning for the other three to follow her.<br />
<br />
As they entered, they were greeted to a very open floor, a spiral staircase in the middle of the room, on the left of the front door were two couches and one armchair. In the centre of that was a wooden coffee table that appeared to have been carved. A few spaces in front of the, was a dining table, it was round and fairly large. It had a total of 8 chairs surrounding it. On the left of that was the kitchen, the flooring around the place was wooden and fairly dark, but the kitchen was distinctly a different shade and appeared to be stone.<br />
<br />
“We’re not staying inside, we’ll do it outside,” October said. She made her way past the dining table and to the back wall where there was a sliding glass door. October opened it and stepped outside, she looked around and found a perfect spot. In the stone patio, she stood. The other three followed her down the small set of steps, Kelvin was in awe, as he made his way to where she was standing, he noticed a large cauldron by the side of the steps.<br />
<br />
October took out the small drawstring bag and started pouring out the contents slowly. She made a large triangle before she stopped. She still had some powder left in the bag, enough to do another circle at least.<br />
“Stay here, I’ll be a few moments,” October said, going back inside the house.<br />
<br />
“This is crazy, right? Am I going crazy?” Kelvin asked,<br />
“No, you’re not. October is always like this. She drags us on a random adventure or something magical. It’s cool and all, but it gets old rather quickly,”<br />
“I still enjoy it,” Yuri said with a frown,<br />
“Yeah, but you like this kind of thing. I like reading, and board games, and...” Chelsea stopped speaking, “damn this cursed house, always making me be overly honest,”<br />
“Where have you been with October before?” Kelvin asked,<br />
“We went to a big floating town in the middle of nowhere... like... actually nowhere. It looked like space but with more colours, October was buying herself some candles or something,” Yuri replied,<br />
“I don’t know why she couldn’t have just gone to the mall,”<br />
“Because they were magical candle, Chelsea,” Yuri said,<br />
“Sure,” she responded sarcastically,<br />
<br />
“Okay, I’m back,” October said, sliding the door back open. In her hands were three candles. One red, one blue, and one yellow.<br />
“Were those by any chance the candles she bought?” Kelvin asked Chelsea,<br />
“Yep, I doubt they’re actually-”<br />
“Hey, October? Are those candles magical,” Kelvin said over Chelsea,<br />
“Yes. I can’t remember exactly which is which, but one of them is made of troll wax,”<br />
“Huh,” Kelvin said in response, looking at Chelsea with a smirk, she rolled her eyes at him,<br />
“October, what do you want us to do?” Chelsea asked, “and how long will it take?”<br />
“It should only take a few minutes,” she responded,<br />
“You didn’t... I give up,” Chelsea said, crossing her arms.<br />
<br />
October gave Yuri the Blue Candle candle, Chelsea the Yellow Candle, and held the Red one on her own. She instructed the two not to step onto or into the triangle, only around it.<br />
<br />
October stood at one point, Yuri at another, and Chelsea at the remaining. <br />
<br />
“Now, I’ve checked both of your for your magical heritage, right?” October asked<br />
“Only about a hundred times,” Chelsea responded,<br />
“We’re both mortal, October,” Yuri answered,<br />
“Good. Okay. As the castor, only the blood of my great grandmother is required, and thus only I will gain the power of my great grandmother. If you were to step into the circle, as she is not a part of your heritage, you would gain the power of the last magical person in your family history. But as you are both fully mortal, you do not need to worry about anything going wrong. Just don’t burn yourself on the candles. Are you both ready?”<br />
“Yes,” Yuri said, firmly,<br />
“I can’t really say no,” Chelsea responded sarcastically. October looked her dead in the eyes, “Sorry, I’ll be professional about this. Yes, I am ready,”<br />
“Okay,” October said. She took a small vial of red liquid out of her pocket. She took a drop of it out using magic, then another drop, then one more. She closed the bottle, three droplets still floating in the air. She placed the vial in her pocket again and waved her hand to move the drops. One was above Chelsea’s candle, the other above her own, and the last one above Yuri’s.<br />
<br />
“Okay. You two, down on your knees.” They girls did as they were instructed, October did the same as them. Kelvin watched in awe as this happened, he was confused and was enjoying it all.<br />
<br />
“Place your candles on the corner, not on the inside, on the outside, just touching the corners, when I say so.”<br />
“Got it,” Chelsea said, full focus,<br />
“Okay,” October took one hand off her candle. She closed her eyes. In her head she counted.<br />
<br />
One.<br />
Two.<br />
Three.<br />
<br />
October snapped her fingers, “now,” she said. All three girls placed the candles on the corner of the triangle. The candles lit up, their wicks lighting a small red flame. The girls took their hands off the candles.<br />
October stood up, stepping away from the candles. The other two watched her and did the same.<br />
<br />
“Did it work?” Yuri asked,<br />
“There’s only one way to find out,” October said.</p>
