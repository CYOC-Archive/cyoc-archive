<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You wake up feeling you had a good time and stretch and let out a yawn-like moan as you returned to your fatigued position realizing it was an awesome dream. You then rub your eyes and squeaks... Squeaks? You stopped rubbing your eyes realizing what happened and moved your hands further away from your face about a few inches away and look at your hands, now mittens since they don&#39;t have any fingers and turn them over. They barely look like human hands anymore alright and it is opaque. You then sit up straight and look down to your rubber sock-like feet and wiggled them. You wondered what happened to you and then you remembered the rubber underwear from the package and wore it. It then fuse along with you and then you wanted to be covered in full rubber, and now it happened! (My underwear did this to me! Awesome!) <br />
<br />
He then remembers a letter when he first started wearing the rubber undergarment and went to the opened package next to the letter and try to read it. However, picking it up with translucent mittens were bothering and it&#39;s giving you arousal. Having rubber skin had increased your sensitivity and you moan in frustration and a mix of arousal since you&#39;re having a hard time picking the letter up. Finally, you&#39;ve managed to pick it up after minutes of moving it around and not hard enough to cut yourself (You&#39;re not really thin enough to be poked to lose your air.) You then place it on your table with the letter (conveniently) unfolded the letter and says it,<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello user of this rubber underwear, I would have warn you that it can grant your wish, but you must have already granted your simple wish, become one with your rubber underwear. And if you wish to fully encased and/or turned into your rubber underwear, it is irreversible. But you probably wouldn&#39;t care anyways. As a bonus, I gave you two special abilities. One is to shapeshift your human rubber shape and into any shape whenever you want and back. Two, is to turn others into and permanently, rubber objects. Be warned however, once you turn that person by touch, and what you think of the object that person will become and you can never turn into something else. But other than that, you should like what you have become. Have fun with your new life.&quot;<br />
<br />
It ends there. You then try it out, as you made your way to the living room, your friend should be coming home any minute. When you reached the living room, you then think of a rubber couch as your body expands in width and your legs and feet stretch as you groan/moan in pleasure as the sound of rubber squeaking when your body changing to a shape of a rubber couch. Your legs merge along with your arms as they become the arm rests and your torso becomes the back rest and your fused thighs become the seat and form the rubbery cushions and your head sinks in the middle of your couch form and a bulge of your smooth face emerges as you wait for your friend. <br />
You then hear the key door unlocking the front door and then open. You hear a voice in the other room, &quot;Kayne! Where are you?&quot; You didn&#39;t respond to Mike as you wait to surprise him with your gift as he walks into the living room wondering where you went. He could&#39;ve thought of going upstairs to see if you are there, but knowing you&#39;d be watching random crap on TV in the living room just to pass the time was the reasonable answer. He thinks you&#39;re not there and then noticed (you) a strange rubber couch. &quot;That&#39;s weird, I never knew Kayne would be into this kind of thing.&quot; Mike says as he puts his stuff down. He called to you again, &quot;Kayne, we were supposed to go hang out at Josh&#39;s place, remember?&quot; You didn&#39;t reply again, you remind yourself to convert Josh later as you think of what you want to turn Mike into as he then sits on your rubber cushion. &quot;Ooh! Squishy!&quot;<br />
You then thought of one, a rubber mattress for your messed up one. You then feel his hand touch your armrest and then you immediately revert back to your human shape as Mike is startled, &quot;What the hell?!&quot; You immediately wrapped around him and then strip him down as you then start to rub your mittens all over his body as you thought of him as your rubber mattress for your room. He then groans as the skin where you rubbed becomes rubber and then you reach his crotch area and you let out a muffled moan in pleasure, again, your rubbery skin has heighten sensitivity. Mike then notices your voice, &quot;K-Kayne?! Is that you?! OOohhhh~!!&quot; he moans as the changes continues as his legs merge together and you let him go as he fell on his fused rubber knees and hands. &quot;W-Why are you doing this?&quot; He asks you as you see his member shrinking into a bulge. His fingers then becomes fused together and are now mittens (but not for long). You then make him lay on his back with your rubber foot on his bare chest and lightly twist it as he moans increasing his change on his torso progresses more. &quot;Oooh man~ You could stop~ I&#39;ll submit my fate. Heh heh... I-I guess I&#39;ll be whatever you want meeee~ to be...&quot; he moans again. You know he secretly likes this but you shook your head. He groans in pleasure and squirms underneath your foot. (I knew you like it.) you mentally say and make an inward smile. You then moan in pleasure with him too as he still squirms as his torso is already rubber and is expanding and absorbs his arms and mittens. &quot;Well, I won&#39;t be using those for these days to come! Oooh~&quot; he says as his legs swells and weirdly, leave his sock like feet at the foot of his rubber mattress body and his neck is swallowed hole by his swelling body and then around his head as his face is the only thing is human. Then his face becomes red and his mouth seals up and lets out a pleasure muffled moan and his nose sinks into his face and his eyes sealed up and lastly, his face is smoothed over, now just a mound where his head and face is at as the last of his human skin is turned into red and transparent rubber.<br />
<br />
You let out a muffled chuckle as you just grab him by the rubber feet as Mike moans in pleasure as the rubber to rubber contact made it squeak and drag his mattress body to your room. It was hard to bring him up to your room but you managed to do it and put him on top of your mattress and rest on top of him. You feel him wriggle and both of you let out a muffled moan as you rub your body on his making tons of squeaking sounds as you both enjoy it.<br />
<br />
An hour later...</p>
