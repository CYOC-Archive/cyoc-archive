<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Thanks to Moon for contributing</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rusty nodded politely at the Dwarf and turned to take another glance at the empty enclosure. The chance to join the team was strangely appealing to him, and he couldn&#39;t wait to tell Troy and RK once he found them again. He turned to leave just as Trammel let out another billow of smoke, which hit him full on in the face, sending him into a coughing fit despite the intriguing scent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa, sorry &#39;bout that...,&quot; the dwarf held out a placating hand, an evil twinkle in his eye.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s...fine,&quot; Rusty could barely manage to choke out as he doubled over, hacking. His lungs began to tingle and burn, and he felt lightheaded from the lack of oxygen.<br />
<br />
Trammel looked around and gestured to a nearby gate, &quot;Here, come on back and I&#39;ll get you some water. Free of charge. Shit costs 8 dollars a bottle form a vendor.&quot; He patted Rusty&#39;s back roughly, causing him to stumble forward.<br />
<br />
Rusty nodded, swaying. The light-headedness was making him dizzy as his coughing became more haggard and deep, with a strange reverberation from deep in his vocal cords. He lumbered forward, blindly trusting the dwarf to lead him backstage as he struggled to catch his breath. He had to duck under a door and turn himself sideways to get through. Was he taller?<br />
<br />
The dizziness was getting worse as the dwarf sat him on a rock at the back of an empty enclosure. Trees and bushes screened the view of the service door from the gated viewing area.<br />
<br />
&quot;There you go. Some privacy here. You just wait right here while I fetch that water.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rusty nodded, but that was a mistake. He leaned forward and rubbed his paws over his head. He tried to calm himself for a moment and was able to finally catch his breath. Through the spinning, it took him much too long to realize that the thick muscles on his head had grown bulkier, his natural doberman features growing much more exaggerated and beastly. Drool spilled from his mouth, and he blinked as he struggled to concentrate.<br />
<br />
The man shut the door behind him, and Rusty heard the latch lock into place. He looked up through blurry eyes. Were...were the trees taller before?<br />
<br />
He stood to knock on the door and his spine popped, sending Rusty to the ground on thick, growing paws. His fingers plumped into rugged pads as his thumbs were yanked up toward his wrists, quickly becoming useless dewclaws. He began to panic as he felt his foot paws balloon in size to match. His body engorged with corded muscle as he panted roughly at the strain.<br />
<br />
&quot;Help...Trrraam...&quot; He shook his head, fruitlessly trying to shake the horror of what was happening to him. Was the Dwarf the book owner? He felt his heart pounding in his chest and his head. And his dick.<br />
<br />
A sudden heat burned through his cock as it began to engorge, and the dizziness was replaced with a thick lust. He closed his eyes again and tried to breathe, but his sheath had grown in tandem with the rest of his massive body, and his shaft snaked out before pulsing in time with the hammering of his heart.<br />
<br />
Rusty whimpered and sat on his new haunches, staring down at the monster between his legs. The lust was overpowering. How had he let this happen to himself? How could he have been so stupid? How hard could his cock get before it killed him?<br />
<br />
He couldn&#39;t stand it any longer and finally leaned forward, his thick tongue lapping slowly across the length. The pleasure was blinding. Wait, no. His head suddenly began to throb, a piercing headache forced an otherworldly yelp from the beast.<br />
<br />
Pain. There was so much pain, and he was sure his head would burst. He whined and laid on the ground, his thick paws scratching at the earsplitting pain. This was it. He was surely about to die.<br />
<br />
Suddenly the pain was replaced by an overwhelming sense of Too Much: his vision fragmented; smells were overpowering. His thoughts were a jumble, and he didn&#39;t have enough processing power to handle the overload. Panic returned in force and then--<br />
<br />
Rusty panted heavily in relief as the pain and dizziness disappeared. His thoughts felt thicker, slower. But he&#39;d take it over the agony he&#39;d just experienced. His eyes burned as his throbbing cock reasserted itself. Hard. Horny. He leaned forward to resume licking himself but quickly bumped into another dog on his right. This was HIS bone. He growled and an identical face snarled back. He recoiled and bumped into another dog, which snapped at him. He couldn&#39;t get away. The heads were attached to him at the neck!<br />
<br />
What the fuck was happening? He couldn&#39;t concentrate. Pre-cum pooled from his cock. He was so horny. Other heads be damned, he leaned forward once more. The head to his right growled softly but seemed to agree that there were more pressing matters at hand, and they took turns lapping at the throbbing mast between their shared legs. The head to his left panted contentedly as it enjoyed the careful ministrations. Steam wafted from its mouth and its red eyes glimmered in the hot evening.<br />
<br />
A sudden discomfort came from between his legs, and it felt like something was being peeled from behind his balls. Rusty shifted and continued to lick, hoping the disturbance would subside. It wasn&#39;t enough to distract him from his goal. The weight lifted as a thick book hit the enclosure ground with a thud. He paid it no mind.<br />
<br />
So close. So horny. So fucking horny.<br />
<br />
Rusty&#39;s three heads howled in unison as the dam burst and steaming ropes of cum shot through the air before landing on the dusty ground.<br />
<br />
The door opened and a dwarf walked out, puffing blasts of smoke at the Cerberus, calming him. Rusty was too distracted by his come down and the pleasant smelling smoke to do much more than watch as he scooped up the book and left the way he&#39;d come in.<br />
<br />
The heads panted contentedly and his long tail swished behind him. There were some lingering thoughts, but most of them were too fragmented to make sense. Something about a Tex, and a Troy, and a Book. Left Rusty came too close to Center Rusty and he snarled, the thoughts quickly cooling like the cum on the enclosure floor.<br />
<br />
-=-=--==-<br />
<br />
The Elf led RK back into the end of his stall. There was a door there, and RK scoffed. The room beyond could only be five foot by five foot, given the dimensions of the tent. The Elf smirked at his expression and opened the door.<br />
<br />
The inside of the room defied space/time conventions. It was a two story affair, with a little kitchenette and styling room on the bottom and a Master bedroom overlooking it on the second floor. <br />
<br />
“Bigger on the inside.” The Elf gestured at a measuring stand. “Hop up.”<br />
<br />
RK jumped onto the stool eagerly. “Getting all my measurements?”<br />
<br />
“Mmm hmm.” The Elf mused. “Strip.”<br />
<br />
RK did. The Elf circled him.<br />
<br />
“Do you like being a skunk?”<br />
<br />
“I’m not particularly partial to it.” RK shrugged.<br />
<br />
“There’s definitely some magic there.” The Elf sniffed. “But you aren’t really my type of bottom.”<br />
<br />
The Elf sorted through his outfits and came back. Golden arm bands and puffy purple silk pants with gold-trimmed silk slippers. He held them up to RK.<br />
<br />
“Put those on and come to bed.” The Elf smiled and walked up the stairs, shedding his clothes as he went.<br />
<br />
“Are they cursed?” RK asked.<br />
<br />
“From a certain point of view. But you’ll enjoy the result, I promise.”<br />
<br />
RK licked his lips, ogling the Elf’s perfect body. The things he did for his friends. He paused. Were they really his friends?<br />
<br />
The arm bands went on, but they were very loose, The pants had elastic to them but looked like parachute pants on him. There were no holes for his tail, so he kept it outside. The slippers were easier to use, but sized way too large. RK figured they’d resize to fit him.<br />
<br />
RK stretched, bracers dangling, and shuffled carefully up the stairs. Unbeknownst to him, his tail began to recede, shrinking and loosing fur, until it left him without any tail at all. His fur shed away halfway up the stairs, leaving a rather naked and chilly Mephit.<br />
<br />
His stance cracked and shifted, heels lowering, transforming into rather large humanoid feet. The stairs became much more comfortable. The Mephit stretched again, loosening his suddenly sore muscles as the grew larger and his shoulders widened. His spine cracked and popped and he was taller, could finally view his soon-to-be lover waiting at the foot of the bed, naked.<br />
<br />
“Coming along nicely.” The Elf smirked.<br />
<br />
The Elf had…a substantial cock. RK had expected something dainty. This was a thick beercan. <br />
<br />
The Mephit sniffed, nose and muzzle cracking and shrinking into something vaguely porcine. Brows jutted, chin widening, features becoming more masculine. His rounded ears reshaped, becoming pointed. Two thick muttonchops of wiry black hair grew down the sides of his face, and his hair reshaped into a Mohawk. His skin darkened to green. All the while, his muscles pulsed and grew. <br />
<br />
Soon, the armbands that fit so poorly now fit perfectly on arms thickly roped with muscle. RK’s jaw ached as two tusks poked through his lips, which now had a severe underbite. The Orc’s eye’s yellowed.<br />
<br />
“Like what ya see?” RK’s voice was like gravel.<br />
<br />
“Oh yes, big boy.” The Elf licked his lips. “Bed. Spread’em.”<br />
<br />
The newly minted orc crawled onto the bed, ass up. His two large green hands spread his cheeks apart. The Elf leaned over and brought out some lube. He poured a dollop on his hands and began to massage it in the Orc’s ass<br />
<br />
“Oh, like that.” RK squeezed his yellow piggy eyes shut.<br />
<br />
“Let me stretch you out so you can take me.” <br />
<br />
The Elf leaned over and adjusted something on the arm bands.<br />
<br />
RK groaned as he felt a stretching sensation all over his body. It made his mind spin and he was glad he was already on the bed because he would have fallen over. He barely noticed the Elf slip his slender, lube coated finger into his ass. He moaned as the Elf found his g-spot and rubbed it, green cock drooling precum onto the sheets.<br />
<br />
“You good?” The Orc mumbled. Even his brain felt heavier.<br />
<br />
“Mmmm….” The Elf murmured and stuck more fingers in. <br />
<br />
The Orc whined. “Ah! Little slower there!”<br />
<br />
“That won’t do.” The Elf sighed. “What was your name again? Rok?”<br />
<br />
“R-R-Kaaaay!” The orc finished with a yelp as the Elf fiddled with the arm bands again.<br />
<br />
More stretching sensations, to the point that it almost hurt. The orc’s frame widened and his spine stretched, muscles following in equal measure. His muscular ass now filled the formerly puffy pants perfectly, leaving little room to the imagination.<br />
<br />
The orc collapsed onto his broad back on the bed, legs spread wide, blinking in confusion. The room was spinning and it was harder to think, like someone was pressing down on his head and smooshing it.<br />
<br />
“Me-er, no, I, am feelin’ weird, Mr. Elf.” Arkay groaned, meaty hand on the side of his head. “Head squeezed.”<br />
<br />
The elf ignored him, forming his hand into a fist and easily sliding into the Orc’s loose hole. <br />
<br />
The Orc moaned as the fist bumped his pros-his prostert-er, the nice spot. “So good.”<br />
<br />
The Elf splayed his hand wide inside of him and the Orc grunted in discomfort.<br />
<br />
“Close. Ready, Rok?” The Elf leaned over to the bracers again.<br />
<br />
“Wait, me-I not-am not read~eergh! Argh!” The orc moaned, eyes rolling up into his head as the stretching happened again.<br />
<br />
It was a good pain, like stretching a sore muscle. His pecs and nipples grew mightier, meatier, his ass stretching the pants to the point of near-rippage, seams groaning. Ark-arky-Rok grunted as the pressure on his skull increased, something in his brain giving and the dome of skull sloping into an even more simian appearance.<br />
<br />
“Grr…Rok….erm, Mister…” The Orc mumbled confusedly. “Mind hurt.”<br />
<br />
“It’s Master.” The Elf stuck his fist in and splayed his hands wide.<br />
<br />
The Orc moaned happily, the pleasure like a relief to the strange brain fog. Precum spurted across his taut cobblestone abs. “Mmm…mathtur tho good…” The Orc slurred.<br />
<br />
The Elf smiled. Then he noticed something on the Orc’s taint.<br />
<br />
“Mmm, what’s this?” The Elf spoke a few words that were beautiful gibberish and the Book plopped onto the bed. “Well, looks like you helped me with my contract after all.”<br />
<br />
“Mmm-Marturr…” The orc muttered, drool dripping past his enormous tusks. “Head painful…”<br />
<br />
“Oh, that’s because of all the unnecessary stuff in it.” The Elf cooed. “Let’s get it out, shall we?”<br />
<br />
The Elf lined up his huge, turgid cock and slid easily in to the Orc’s loose hole. The Orc grunted happily. The Elf smirked and picked up speed. His cock grew, spreading the ruined hole to its maximum width.<br />
<br />
Master leaned up and spoke a few sweet nonsensical words in the huge Orc’s ears. Suddenly, the Orc felt his brain lighten-but his balls began to grow, swelling with seed and all those unnecessary thoughts. What use did a guard have for reading and writing and school?<br />
<br />
Rok’s thoughts grew lighter and lighter as the pressure decreased in his skull, leaving only blissful pleasure and an almost painful fullness in his balls as the Elf fucked him hard, hitting his prostate with every pump.<br />
<br />
Halfway through draining his brains into his balls, the Orc felt a tinge of fear. But happy thoughts beckoned to him, playful ones, replacing all the bad memories and fear of failure with making love to his master.<br />
<br />
 The orc’s hole tightened as he began to buck back. Empty was better. Balls so full.<br />
<br />
“There you go Rok, let it all out.” The Elf smiled cruelly. “Empty head, empty balls.”<br />
<br />
“Empty,” Rok nodded dazedly, tongue not accustomed to ‘s’s’ with his huge tusks. “No brain thingth. Love Mathtur.”<br />
<br />
“Of course you do.” Master smiled. “Cum.”<br />
<br />
The Orc happily came at Master’s command. <br />
<br />
His mind blanked with pleasure, tears of joy trailing down his cheeks. Each spurt of his cock was another memory gone. Spurt Spurt Spurt. He relaxed, hole quivering, balls slightly deflated. He moaned brainlessly, tongue lazing out of his mouth as his mind was filled with blissful silence.<br />
<br />
The Elf smiled and pulled out with a squelch. “Clean that up, slave. Use your tongue. Then Mind the shop for me while I drop this Book off. You’ll be accompanying me back to Faerie. “<br />
<br />
“Yeth Mathter.” The Orc began to lick the sheets clean.<br />
<br />
The Elf picked up the Book, shook some Orc cum off it, and left the room.<br />
<br />
-=-=-==-=<br />
<br />
Troy looked around for his friends, bag full of collars in his hands. He nodded at a Dwarf who was eyeing him strangely as he walked past, moving something to his side. An Elf he passed was closing up his clothes shop. He slid something into his shirt when he noticed Troy and just tipped a rather fashionable hat at him.<br />
<br />
Troy blew a kiss at the dwarf (who slapped his ass as he walked past) winked at the Elf (who smirked) and kept walking. Where the hell were his friends?<br />
<br />
He met a surprised looking Asterion at the tent to the Magic show. The Minotaur was leaning against the wall of the tent, lazily eating popcorn. He jerked to attention when Troy arrived.<br />
<br />
“Are they already inside?” Troy asked.<br />
<br />
“Erm, sure, yeah.” The Minotaur nodded.<br />
<br />
Tory rubbed the bridge of his nose. “The Elf and Dwarf got them, didn’t they?”<br />
<br />
“No, no!” The Minotaur stepped towards him. “They’re inside, really!”<br />
<br />
“Shape” Troy pointed at the Minotaur.<br />
<br />
Nothing happened. <br />
<br />
“Summoned. Not a real person.” The Minotaur grinned. <br />
<br />
“Oh no.” Troy rolled his eyes. “Let me guess, I go in there and a magician pulls me out of his hat or transforms me into a tiger with magic hoops or something?”<br />
<br />
“...Um, good guesses.” Asterion blinked.<br />
<br />
“I think I’ll skip the magic show, thanks.” Troy glared. “So my friends are a lost cause for now, then? Until I manage to become CEO and cancel my contract?” Troy carefully avoided saying ‘murder Sebastian’.<br />
<br />
“Yes.”  Asterion cleared his throat. “Indeed.”<br />
<br />
“I paid 500 grand on these collars. I want my furking dragon sent to me, thanks, and not actually be me.” Troy snarled. <br />
<br />
“If you listened to the disclaimer….”<br />
<br />
“What was that? Why not go put that collar on the Kobold, you say?” Troy said. “What a lovely suggestion, Asterion! Or perhaps, and this is some big brain shit right here, prepare yourself, you would like to volunteer? I have five collars, after all. Magical Collars. I can’t be held liable for using the product, right?”<br />
<br />
Asterion cleared his throat again. “Your riding dragon will be sent to you tonight.”<br />
<br />
“It better not be Tex.” Troy growled.<br />
<br />
“It could be Mark.” Asterion shrugged.<br />
<br />
“Who?” Troy shook his head. “Oh, right. Mark who played DND.”<br />
<br />
“Erm, yes, him. Sure.” Asterion shrugged. “Could be anyone, really.”<br />
<br />
“Take me to the airbnb.” Troy ground his teeth. “Now.”<br />
<br />
They left. Troy’s cellphone rang. He answered it and listened, growing angry.</p>
