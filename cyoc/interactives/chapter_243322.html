<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After settling in, Jeff and Amy had decided to go on a hike around the inn as Jeff had picked out a lovely scenic place for the two of them to spend their time together.  They walked down a trail that lead them to someplace romantic, as Amy worse and white sleeveless tank top that showed off her huge assets, huggable mom jeans, and hiking boots while Jeff wore a red polo shirt, cargo pants, and hiking boots of his own.  Amy walked closely beside Jeff as she leaned her head on his arm and gave a sigh enjoying the peace and tranquility of it all.  Jeff was trying to put aside his romantic urges, although it was hard when he could smell her hair and it smelled like lavender.  A new memory popped up in his head when the two were first dating and on their first date at the movies, Jeff complimented her beautiful luscious hair.  It was also where they had their first kiss in the back of the theater.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, Lavender, just like our first date.&quot; Jeff said as Amy looked up at him and her face beamed with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Jeff, you remembered!  I thought you had forgotten.&quot; Amy said as she kissed Jeff on the lips and the two continued their walk.<br />
<br />
The memories of Amy being his sister were beginning to seem unreal to him now after the hours they had spent together.  At one point, Amy stopped to feel the wind and Jeff watched as the wind blew her hair back and Jeff thought that he had never seen such a beautiful sight before.  It was obvious that the husband side of Jeff was becoming more dominant the longer he was this age and felt this way.<br />
<br />
As they were walking, Amy ask, &quot;So...  Where are you taking me on our first walk?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff looked ahead and chuckled, &quot;Oh...  It&#39;s someplace special.  I&#39;m sure you will like it.&quot;<br />
<br />
As they reached the end, Amy watched on in astonishment.  They were both at the edge of the cliff where they see the mountains in the distance, a huge lake below, and the sight of the sun starting to set.  Amy watched on and was amazed by this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Jeff...&quot; she stuttered, &quot;It&#39;s...beautiful...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff smiled warmly and said, &quot;I know...  Which is why this will be our one spot we will spend together when the day dies down for the week.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy turned to Jeff with surprise and said, &quot;Really?  That&#39;s wonderful.  Oh, Jeff, you know how to treat a lady.&quot;  She soon wrapped her arms around his neck and starred at him with lovely eyes.<br />
<br />
Jeff looked at her and saw how lovely she looked in the sunlight.  Those gleaming eyes, and radiant face, the lucious hair, she was the antifices of pure beauty.  But his eyes immediately glued to her chest as her cleavage was spilling out of her tank top, pressing on his chest.  Jeff&#39;s heart was racing and he could feel his privates stiffing up.  Jeff knew the urges were getting stronger and her teen side was fighting it off.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you...&quot; Amy said, knowing deep down she is trying to bring him into a false sense of security.<br />
<br />
Jeff was starring on and didn&#39;t know what to do.<br />
<br />
&#39;Give in...&#39;<br />
<br />
The strange thought came into his head.  It was no doubt that it&#39;s the husband side telling him to accept this.<br />
<br />
&#39;Go on...  You know you want to...  Kiss her...  Love her...  Cherish her...  It&#39;s who you are...  It&#39;s who she is...&#39;<br />
<br />
Jeff could feel the husband side overtake him and was trying his best to fight it off.  But the more he stares at her eyes and breasts, the harder it is to contain it.  Suddenly, the husband end took over as he said, &quot;I love you too...&quot; before bending down and kiss her in the lips.  Amy knew that mission was accomplished as she gave in to temptation.  As they dove deeper into the kiss, Jeff pushed her down with his strength as Amy lift on leg in the air while keeping her other foot firmly on the ground.  It was an incredible moment for the two of them.<br />
<br />
The teenage Jeff watched helplessly as the husband side was taking control.  He knew it&#39;s wrong.  He knew he is kissing Amy, a former young and innocent sister.  But he could feel his teen sense slowly fading.  He need to take control of it and fast.  Otherwise, the husband would have full control and would go too far in their relationship.<br />
<br />
As they delve deeper in their kiss, Jeff was pushing back to take control.  Finally, he was able to make a breach and let go of the kiss.  Looking at Amy with clearer eyes, he told her, &quot;Perhaps its best that we return to the Inn for dinner.  I don&#39;t want to stay here for too long before it gets dark.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy heard that and turned her head to realized that the sun was in midway set.  &quot;Perhaps you&#39;re right...  The last thing I want is some creep spying on us at night.  Besides, I am a little hungry anyways.  Found a bar in the inn to get a quick bite.  Let&#39;s go!&quot;<br />
<br />
Getting up, Amy and Jeff dusted themselves off and returned to the ranch to get a good meal.  But deep down, the two have different experiences.  For Amy, it was satisfaction.  But for Jeff, it was worry.  He was able to get into control of these urges so far.  But how long will it take before he gives in during the week.<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Meanwhile, after a long and grueling school day, Jamie now has to partake in cheerleading practice with her friends.  They were in the locker room changing into their traditional cheerleading uniforms to begin their training for not only Homecoming, but the rematch with Lola and her group.<br />
<br />
&quot;Man...  I cannot believe you and Antonio toasted those brats!  I don&#39;t know about you girls, but they had it coming.&quot;<br />
Chloe said as she put on her cheerleading top and brushed her braids away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Agreed...  Those three are nothing more but trouble.  Who do that think they are begging for a rematch.  We beat them before to get that halftime spot and now they wish to try again.  Talk about delusional.&quot; Mei state as she slid her cheerleading skirt up her legs.<br />
<br />
Jamie heard the two as she was tying her trainers and nodded.  Hearing their concerns, Jamie&#39;s new memories continue to grow as she remembered last week when the three pushed themselves to get the spot.  She remembered weeks of training and early morning practice, the time Chloe and Mei were in her house for late practice in the backyard, the fitness training at the gym.  All three sacrificed so much to get to where they are and now they had to go through with another match again to keep their spot.  It boiled Jamie over the fact that Lola would want to take them on once more.  But after that dodgeball match, it gave her the confidence they need to win it.<br />
<br />
finishing tying her shoes, and got up and looked to the two to say, &quot;Relax, you two.  We got this in the bag.  All we have to do is push a little more to keep our spot.  From there, we will show those overgrown hoes who runs the cheer team!&quot;<br />
<br />
Chloe and Mei finished changing and was surprised by their friends attitude.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn, girl.  You got some fire in ya.&quot; Chloe said with surprise.<br />
<br />
Mei on the other hand knew why and gave a smirk.  &quot;Isn&#39;t it obvious Chloe?  She like this because she finally got a chance speaking to Antonio.  You saw it yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamie heard that and was blushing, trying to explain to them what happened.  &quot;What?  No!  That&#39;s not what you think.  We were just congratulating ourselves in that dodgeball match.  And I...was a little flustered in speaking to him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chloe approached her and slapped her on the back.  &quot;You kidding?  You took your first step in that relationship.  You deserve to have that moment.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mei soon joined in and wrapped her arm around the back of Jamie&#39;s neck.  &quot;That and them some.  How many girls would try to talk to him without freezing up.  You, Jamie, are a miracle worker.  Who knows, maybe he will ask you out on the Homecoming Dance this weekend after the game.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamie turned to her friend and was now tomato red.  &quot;R-really!?  You think!?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chloe could tell that Jamie was looking embarrassed and told Mei, &quot;Easy, Mei.  Let&#39;s not jump the gun yet.  Jamie needs to focus on the rematch with those sluts before she would consider the idea in going out with Antonio.  Speaking of, we better get out in the courts to train.  Don&#39;t want that coach yelling at my ear like last time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mei listened to Chloe and decided to leave it, &quot;Sure...  Let&#39;s.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two then left Jamie and headed off to the basketball court for practice.  Chloe soon turned to her and said, &quot;You coming, girl?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamie was still red in the face before shaking it off.  Rubbing the back of her head, she told them.  &quot;Yeah.  In a moment.  Need to fix my hair.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chloe smiled and waved her off.  &quot;Don&#39;t take too long.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two soon left while Jamie approached the sink mirror, trying to forget what Mei said.  As she twist her hair into a ponytail, the thought of Antonio asking her out to the dance seems a bit much.  But then she recalled in her previous teen years that her former husband Mike asked her out in homecoming.  He was quite the stud in the football team and the way that gel and danced was memorable.  It even made them homecoming king and queen that time.  But then, she felt that memory slowly fleeting as new teen memories were overtaking the old ones.<br />
<br />
But then, the vision of Mike was slowly blurring away as Antonio was coming to her mind as well.  Ever since they first talk, she can&#39;t stop thinking about how he looked.  His toned tanned arms, his gorgeous face, his unique physic.  She even envisioned what he would look like naked and could imagine what his dick and balls are like.  She closed her eyes and bite her lip as she placed her hand on her toned stomach, guiding down to the band of her skirt to go in.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, realization struck and she snapped her eyes opened and draw her hand away.  Hitting her forehead, she said, &quot;Focus, Jamie...  Focus...  You are a mother for crying out loud.  You have to stop thinking like that for a week before things return to normal.  Besides, that&#39;s Jeff&#39;s friend!  I can&#39;t smit over him.  What will he say about that.  I might be a mother, but the last thing I want is for Jeff to ground me, now that he&#39;s the father.&quot;<br />
<br />
Placing her hands on the sink, she lowered her head and gave a deep groan.  &quot;Oh god...  This is going to be a trying week.  I just hope these new feelings don&#39;t cause me so much trouble.&quot;<br />
<br />
As she was trying to gain some composure...<br />
<br />
&#39;What are you doing...?&#39;<br />
<br />
Hearing that, she looked up at the mirror and saw something quite surprising.  She was looking right at herself, but it was different as is looked on with a serious look while the real Jamie was shocked by this.  &quot;Huh?&quot; was all she said.<br />
<br />
&#39;You heard me.  What are you doing?  You have a second chance to find love and you are just brushing it off.  You know you can&#39;t fight it.  Give in to this new life.  And go be with Antonio.  You know you want to.&#39; the mirrored self said as she licked her lips and have lust in her eyes.<br />
<br />
The real Jamie backed away and rubbed her eyes, trying to gather what she seen and heard.  Looking back, she could see that the mirrored self wasn&#39;t there anymore, just herself.  Blinking, she muttered, &quot;What...the...fuck...&quot;  It&#39;s no doubt she is experiencing the same type of delusions Jeff is dealing with just now and didn&#39;t know how to avoid it.  Rubbing her face and hitting her cheeks, she was trying to wake herself up.  &quot;Okay...  Calm down Jamie...  You&#39;re just having a long day...  Yeah...  That&#39;s right...  A long day...&quot;<br />
<br />
Trying to regain her composure, she realized that her friends are waiting for her at the basketball courts and had to join them for practice.  Turning, she ran off to leave the locker room, trying to forget what she just witnessed.  But what she and Jeff didn&#39;t know, it was only the beginning as the Chronivac was affecting them in more ways then one.</p>
