<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Uh, yeah&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
The big hairy guy was just my type; he was beefy and bearish.  His thick black and silver moustache was surrounded by dense stubble.<br />
<br />
He helped me retrieve the stuff I'd bought and load it into the trunk of my car.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, thanks, uh... my name's Adam.&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
The stranger smiled, giving me a weak feeling in the knees that supported my chubby frame.  It's why I was buying all that damned fruit and other healthy stuff, I was determined that I was going on a diet and building up some muscle too.<br />
<br />
&quot;You wouldn't happen to be Adam Ryan?&quot;  The bear asked, removing his mirrored glasses revealing the grey eyes that went so well with his salt and pepper black hair and moustache.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, do we know each other?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I suppose you probably wouldn't recognize me.  It's been years since high school and I'm a lot different, I've been through some changes and I think you'll agree, they're for the better.  I'm 'Spud'.&quot;  The six-foot plus bear said.<br />
<br />
I completely forgot that we were in the supermarket parking lot, completely ignored any sort of public decorum and caught the huge man in the biggest hug I could manage.  For his part, 'Spud' grunted happily and chuckled softly as he squeezed the stuffing out of me.<br />
<br />
We pulled away from each other and looked one another in the eyes.  Those gorgeous grey eyes, how could I forget those eyes!<br />
<br />
&quot;You know Adam, you aren't supposed to forget the guy you lost your virginity to.&quot;  Spud said with a chuckle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but look at you... Robert Spudowski!&quot;  I said, &quot;How could I be blamed for not recognizing you?  Last I saw you were this fireplug of a guy.  Short, stocky and a little thick around the waist and you didn't have a single hair on your body even as a senior and couldn't grow a beard if your life depended on it.  Hell, I had more hair on my chest and face than you did.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, well, I've changed.  Looks like you have too!  You were the big hairy linebacker I fell in love with and now you've put on some nice natural football padding.  Nothin' wrong with a little padding on your partner, know what I mean?&quot;  He said a little lustfully.<br />
<br />
I laughed.  The thought of hooking back up with this big grizzly was starting to give me a nice case of wood.  I'd broken up with Greg at least a year ago and had started becoming a bit desperate.  Auto-erotica is fine, but I wanted sex with a big bear again and Spud was a lot bigger than Greg was.  &quot;Looks like I wouldn't need to go poking around on the net to find a date now.&quot;  I thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I want to loose some of that padding, I know I'll never get back to my senior playing weight, but perhaps I can loose some of this and build a little more muscle.&quot;  I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Adam, if you're game I can help you out with that.  You can become the big grizzly you were in high school, most likely bigger,” Spud said, &quot;but it's something that's gonna change you a bit more than just helping you drop pounds.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?  How?&quot;  I said.  The thought of loosing the four extra tires I'd gained since graduating from college was quite appealing to me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell you what, let's go out to Hank's Steak House, my treat, buddy.  We can discuss weight loss after dinner.  Spud said, rubbing his hands together vigorously, no doubt thinking about the good food and the good fucking he was going to get and give after dinner.  <br />
<br />
All he had to do at this point was say, &quot;You're place or mine&quot; and I was his for life if he wanted.  I'd gone on a diet, but there was no way I was going to throw the opportunity to indulge my two favorite passions tonight.<br />
<br />
I hopped into my little red Accura and turned the key.  We both knew the way to Hank's.  Spud drew up to me on his Harley and made the 'roll down your window' gesture.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've been away for awhile; is Ol' Hank still alive?&quot;  He said, &quot;I owe him big for those beers he slipped us back in high school.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, Hank's in his late sixties, but he's still running the place.  Says he's gonna give it to his son when he gets tired of running the place; you remember Billy?&quot;  I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep, Billy was quite a wrestler, too bad he's straight.  I loved to get up close and personal with him on the mat.&quot;  Spud said with a grin.<br />
<br />
With that, he pulled away and I followed.<br />
<br />
We'd been to Hank's Steak House on dates with each other all through high school; though no one but us knew it was a date or to celebrate the football or wrestling team winning.  Ol' Hank Grimmson still ran the place.  When we'd go there' as kids, he'd give us half a beer each in a coffee mug to go with our meal.  Not enough to get us drunk and he swore us to secrecy or we'd never get any more.  Hank was an old fashioned guy with a father right from Germany and believed that we were old enough to have some beer with our beef.  Hell, we were both seventeen and getting ready to graduate the next year.<br />
<br />
After a wonderful meal and a good time catching up with Hank and Billy, Spud did ask the magic question.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're place or mine?&quot;  He growled, seductively.<br />
<br />
&quot;How about your place?&quot;  I said, in a low growl to match his and at that he grinned beautifully.<br />
<br />
We left Hank's.  Spud left a tip equivalent to the price of the meal and we headed back to his place.<br />
<br />
His place was a brand new home that looked like it cost at least a million.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn Spud!  You've done well for yourself!&quot;  I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep, invested heavily in the dot coms and sold before they crashed.  I figured I'd buy a home in my hometown.  Thought I might settle down, get married, raise a couple of kids, get a dog and cat, you know; domestic bliss.&quot;  He said and there was that beautiful sarcastic smile he used to get when he was joking.<br />
<br />
We made it to his porch and he grabbed me in a rough embrace, penned me against the wall by the door and deep kissed me.  His stubble scratched my clean- face and his moustache tickled; I was in heaven!  <br />
<br />
When he broke the kiss he sighed happily and said, &quot;I've wanted to do that since I saw your ample butt bent over picking up those oranges.  Of course, seeing your ample butt bent over as you picked up oranges made me want to do the rest of it too, but you can get arrested for stuff like that in public” He grinned again.<br />
<br />
He opened the door and we went inside.  He grabbed my ass and said, &quot;Come on in and sit down.  I'll grab us a couple of beers and we can talk.&quot;<br />
<br />
I moved to the couch and shouted down the hall as he was going to the kitchen, &quot;I'm not interested in talk, Spud.&quot;<br />
<br />
I heard him laugh.  In a few minutes he returned with the beers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, we have to talk before we fuck, because you have a choice to make.&quot;  Spud said and he'd become serious and was scratching at his salt and pepper stubble.  He'd taken off his leather jacket again and I got another look at the beautiful bear tattoo on his upper left shoulder.  He was wearing a black Harley Davidson muscle T-shirt that showed it off nicely.<br />
<br />
&quot;Choice?&quot;  I asked, sipping my beer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.  See, those changes I mentioned are pretty drastic and very permanent.  I'll lay it out for you, Adam, I'm a werebear.&quot;  Spud said evenly.<br />
<br />
I almost spewed beer all over his carpet and began laughing after I swallowed hard.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not kiddin' around Adam, I'm a werebear.&quot;  Spud repeated and sipped at his beer.  &quot;If you have unprotected sex with me tonight, you'll become a werebear too.  So the question is this: Do you want to be a werebear and look like I do, change into a bear whenever you wish and just generally enjoy a much more powerful body that ages very slowly?  Or do you want to remain as you are and worry about counting calories for the rest of your life?&quot;  <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, you're gonna need a little proof.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Spud unzipped his oil stained blue jeans revealing his beautiful cock.  Spud never was a fan of underwear and then began to change.  I watched as he stretched his clothes to their limits with his change.  I saw fur growing on his arms and face, his salt and pepper beard filled in and grew full to a medium length before my eyes.  His ears grew furry and rounded and moved slightly up on his head.  Then the changes stopped.  I could hear his clothing protesting as he moved.  His huge cock had grown to resemble something I'd never seen before, but guessed was the natural shape for a bear's cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is about a quarter way to my half form.&quot;  Spud said.  I can changed to full grizzly, but I think this is enough proof, don't you?&quot;  Spud said in a deeper voice than his normal baritone.<br />
<br />
I was amazed.  A little frightened at first because of seeing something so paranormal, but I was over that now and just simply in awe.<br />
<br />
Spud changed back into his human shape, but left the fly open and I noticed that his cock, though now completely human again, was stiff.  He scratched at his fully-grown beard and smoothed out his longer moustache, clearing the whiskers from his mouth before he took another swig of his beer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, buddy, I saw you this evening and I just knew I had to offer it to you.  You and I could live together happily for the rest of our lives having great sex.  I still love you and want to be with you, but I wanted you to know just what you were getting into.  I wanted you to have a choice, because it doesn't mean we can't have sex or a relationship; it just means that I'll be taking care of you when you're eighty, seeing to your medications and other health needs and I'll still look like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
He played with his moustache, twisting it into a short handlebar, and took another pull on his beer.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's your choice Adam, you can see what I've chosen.  So, before we go upstairs; do we need condoms or not?&quot;  Spud asked, gripping his shaft and pumping on it a couple of time as he downed the rest of his beer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Spud, I think I'd like to...&quot;</p>
