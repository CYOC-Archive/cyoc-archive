<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There was an odd sense of uncertainty and listlessness come that morning for the she-<br />
wolves in general after the inspection was done. Some just wandered back to the den  and <br />
laid down and didn't get back up catching some extra sleep. Some found a pack of playing <br />
cards they had stowed away and organized a quick game. Other simply lounged about and <br />
stared out the windows thinking about clouds, how lucky they were to be part of the pack, <br />
or having Master inside them. All in all, everyone felt bored, lazy, tired, of one combination <br />
or another. They had put SO MUCH energy into remaking the household fit for their kind <br />
after their transformation yesterday, they hadn't even stopped to consider what they were <br />
going to do next. There was always Lawrence, Roger, Nick, and now of course Zackery, but <br />
most of the she wolves were too burned out from yesterday to even consider it. <br />
<br />
'What is that side of beef doing with my, I mean that pervert Nick?' Nicole wondered seeing <br />
Zackery with a paw on the shoulder of Nick, who look slightly uncomfortable but paying <br />
attentively to everything that Zackery said to him. <br />
<br />
Zackery stepped into what was now the shared bedroom/den of the pack's lesser females <br />
pulling along Nicolas. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello.&quot; Zack said to no one in particular.  <br />
<br />
&quot;How is everyone?&quot; He said in a perfectly polite, cool and calm voice. <br />
<br />
All the females in the room had their eyes on the second biggest and baddest wolf in their <br />
pack. <br />
<br />
Nicole picked up Zack's scene that seemed to overshadow Nick's and something about it <br />
made Nicole ever so slightly excited. The rest of the female members of the pack present <br />
also felt their weariness phase out slightly at the idea of Zackery's company. Zack saw the <br />
look in their eyes as his scent slowly began to take effect. <br />
<br />
 Nicole however shook her head clearing it and rolled off the couch she had claimed and <br />
walked over to Nick. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Miss, and what would your name be? Jensen didn't think to tell me and my friends <br />
all your names.&quot; Zack said. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm Nicole.&quot; She said simply, for like all the pack,  her last name was a meaningless sound <br />
now, there was only the pack. <br />
<br />
All the female members in the pack sounded off in a heart beat, &quot;I'm Ashley!&quot; &quot;Megan!&quot; <br />
&quot;I'm Maxine! This is Robyn and Millie!&quot; &quot;Howdy!&quot; &quot;Hi!&quot; &quot;Margot!&quot; &quot;My name is Pearl!&quot; <br />
&quot;Jasmine!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;There were a lot more of you when I and my friends came in and during the inspection <br />
where are the rest?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh they're around.&quot; Said Maxine leaning back and putting her arms behind her head and <br />
stretching her back. &quot;Alexandra and Caroline are off spot checking everything for good <br />
measure. Anne wanted to see something and Beatrice went along for the ride. Don't ask <br />
me where Sarah, Terri, Sandi and June are.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;So where's Roger and Lawrence, and Ulysses?&quot; The gray she wolf asked the charcoal gray <br />
one, a different shade from hers, Nick and Alexandra's. <br />
<br />
&quot;Back in the male den last I saw them.&quot; Zackery said off handedly, &quot;They didn't seem that <br />
interested. But I'm interested.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nicole took hold of Nick's arm and pulled him away from Zack's gentle if firm grasp. &quot;I'm <br />
interested in another wolf, sorry.&quot; <br />
<br />
Zackery growled every so slightly  but kept it low enough so none heard, he turned his <br />
attention to the rest of the she wolves whom he had the undivided attention of.  This was <br />
derailed when Beatrice came storming into the room and bumped right into a wall of <br />
Zackery but was too excited to pick up his scent. The plain green she wolf declared to the <br />
group, &quot;Everybody! Master's Great-Grandpa is here already!!&quot; <br />
<br />
The she wolves all took looks at one another and were all quickly pushing past Zackery, <br />
Nicole pulling Nick along for good measure. <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey.&quot; Lawrence, Roger and Ulysses turned to see a lavender she wolf, Sarah, leaning on <br />
the increased door frame, now large enough that their six foot plus height seemed normal <br />
almost, &quot;You guys seem bored. Mind if I cut in?&quot; <br />
<br />
Roger opened his mouth when they heard &quot;Everybody! Master's Great-Grandpa is here <br />
already!!&quot; A short while away. <br />
<br />
The males and she-wolf present didn't say anything more as they hurried to the front <br />
entrance. <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
Patrick Hounds Sr. a man who fought and lived through two wars, and had made <br />
cooperate enforcers run away scared once in his life, and had bought a small failing <br />
business for a song and made thrive had seen the unbelievable, the illogical, and the just <br />
plain impossible, and like anyone who had lived long enough had come to one of two <br />
conclusion, either he had seen it all or realized he never would see it all (he was the <br />
former). And so when faced with the impossible, nay, beyond the scope of all his long <br />
life's experiences (a bunch of savage beast creatures going about like people), he had done <br />
the only thing his brain could manage and blacked out. <br />
<br />
When he began to come to, his hope that he had just been dreaming were instantly <br />
dashed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gramps always was one for surprises.&quot; He heard a little girl's voice say.<br />
<br />
&quot;He's not a mundane wolf now, I guess that runs down the idea of someone's Transform or <br />
Dare triggering if they enter Glendale.&quot;  He heard a boy above the age of the girl say in a <br />
calm collect and somewhat disappointed tone. <br />
<br />
&quot;Let's turn him into a she wolf! I have this acrylic bright red color I saw on an anime poster <br />
that would be perfect for fur and I wanna see how a she wolf would look like with a G <br />
cub!&quot; He heard a woman's voice say with a tone and attitude that said she was in charge <br />
and knew it and had no problem in reminding everyone she was. <br />
<br />
&quot;Not now Kaylee.&quot; He heard a gruff voice says in a firm and no sense tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Master.&quot; Replied the female voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I say we go with what we were gonna go with before.&quot; Said the little girl's voice. <br />
<br />
&quot;I want to add some improvements to that idea.&quot; Said a younger girl's voice but sounding <br />
more semantically precise than the older one. &quot;What if he was like Martha?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not watching something grow another head again Alice.&quot; Said the woman's voice, <br />
apparently Kaylee.<br />
<br />
&quot;I did not mean like that Alpha Female.&quot; Replied apparently Alice politely. &quot;But if he is to be <br />
a pet for us, should he not be an interesting one?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you -really- tested the ability of the game to make people into objects yet?&quot; Said a <br />
adult male voice less rough than the first, &quot;I think the fountain outside has always needed <br />
a statue.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Be quite Zackery, the alphas are discussing.&quot; Said Kaylee.<br />
<br />
&quot;And we DO know that,&quot; The little boy's voice said, &quot;There was an incident with a tea pot <br />
apparently in our family some years back. But doing that would leave that turn lost forever <br />
and since we're not expanding the pack as much after yesterday we can't afford to lose any <br />
turns.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I still think-&quot; Zackery began but was cut off by a teenage voice that reserved, calm, but <br />
sounding deadly serious.<br />
<br />
&quot;Master Bart has spoken Master Zack, now be quite.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... I offer my deepest apologies. I am sorry if I overstepped my bounds, forgive me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Patrick felt there was just something not right about the apology, but he was apparently <br />
the only one who picked up on it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Forgiven.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Kaylee.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As I was going to say and am now going to say,&quot; Began Alice, &quot;Why not make him an <br />
interesting wolf? If more than one head is too much, how about making him bigger to help <br />
Martha protect us? And some extra tails would be rather interesting don't you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How about he has a loco on his side like Bolt does?&quot; A younger little boy's voice asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;That would be very interesting indeed.&quot; Said Alice in a curious voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey I think he's awake.&quot; Said the big rough male voice. &quot;Come on  great grandpa, I can tell <br />
you're faking being asleep again, I remember that much about you. Everyone else thought <br />
you were a tired old man but I know you better than that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Reluctantly Patrick did open his eyes. Found them facing the biggest and most fearsome <br />
wolf he had seen in his life. Patrick realized his arms were tied up, but not his legs. He did <br />
a upward kick chipping a tooth off of the big beast and did a backflip off the coach he was <br />
apparently on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Father!&quot; &quot;Papa!&quot; &quot;Papa!&quot; &quot;Master!&quot; &quot;Lord-Dad!&quot; <br />
<br />
Five little wolf monster kids tried to tackle him at once but were all caught by the tails by a <br />
four armed she wolf thingie. The fifth one had his tail stepped on to  keep him in place.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh!&quot; The black one asked exasperated, &quot;I thought you said he was shot when crawling <br />
out of his fox hole!&quot; <br />
<br />
One of the small red ones returned also exasperated, &quot;He was shot crawling out of his fox <br />
hole, and kept on going!&quot; <br />
<br />
Partrick was suddenly tackled on all sides by women with wolf heads with fur every color <br />
of the rainbow it seemed and was pushed down onto the floor, it was like he was buried in <br />
bricks. <br />
<br />
&quot;I TOLD YOU to have us inspect how you tied him up!&quot; Said one of two identical looking <br />
dirty blond ones. <br />
<br />
&quot;I see you're still a real life super hero great grampa.&quot; Said the biggest one.<br />
<br />
The large red brown one next to him looked very surprised at the big black one not <br />
ripping Patrick's head off.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're early...&quot; Said the big black one.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where is my family.&quot; Patrick said right to the point as always.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ta-da!&quot; Said the big black one gesturing at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;... Bart?&quot; Patrick asked using the boy version of the name as he always did for Jennifer's <br />
husband. <br />
<br />
The big one face faulted. <br />
<br />
&quot;HEY!&quot; Said one of the small red ones sounding very annoyed.</p>
