<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Max got on the treadmill, setting it at an easy walking pace to start. Gradually he increased the level of incline, giving him more of a workout without increasing the speed. Finally he increased that as well, trotting along as the band moved faster beneath him. His pecs, pumped from all the chest exercises that he and Neil had just finished, rose and fell as he ran. He couldn&#39;t believe how good it felt, having heavy slabs of muscle on his chest instead of moobs. He looked down at his own cleavage and grinned as he saw the chasm between his pecs. He was tempted to grope himself, but he resisted; there would always be time for that later, back in his own room. <br />
<br />
When Max looked up again, he saw that Neil was talking to Brock and Lucas. That was a bit surprising; he didn&#39;t remember Neil getting along with either of them. Max wasn&#39;t sure what that was about, and almost got off the treadmill to go over and find out. But then, out of the corner of his eye, he realized that there was a cute brunette on the treadmill next to his. Her body was long and lithe, clearly an athlete, probably track and field or something. At that point Max forgot about Neil and quickly decided that he would need to spend a bit more time on the treadmill first. <br />
<br />
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br />
Neil looked over at Brock Medina and Lucas Peyton. He wasn&#39;t sure which of the two would be more receptive to talking with him, so he just approached both of them while they were together. They were bigger than they had been a week ago, when everything began to change. As long as Neil had been aware of him, Lucas&#39; muscles had been beautifully sculpted. Now they were bigger, harder, and their beauty seemed enhanced--their increased size made their shape more dramatic and aesthetic, the slightly darker skin tone making the separations between muscles more visible. <br />
<br />
Brock, on the other hand, had been a big bruiser before. Now, he was clearly a mass freak, a bodybuilder who cared little for aesthetics, focusing instead on raw size. He had certainly been adding plenty of that in the last week, every bit of him bloated with muscle. Despite his size he was still quite lean, making every vein and muscle separation visible under his thin skin. His gut was a bit rounded out from &#39;roids, the separations between his abs visible under his tight tank top.<br />
<br />
Lucas was spotting Brock on an incline bench, standing behind the huge man, helping him get up a barbell that was loaded down with weight. Brock&#39;s face was red, sweat dripping off his temples as he grunted his way through his reps. Lucas noticed as Neil approached, but waited until Brock finished his set and reracked the bar before he tapped on of the big man&#39;s hulking traps. <br />
<br />
Brock looked around, his weathered face splitting into a big grin. &quot;Neil, right?&quot; he said, standing up from the bench. &quot;Man, your progress here has been incredible! I think you might even be bigger than my bro Lucas here!&quot; He gave his friend a hearty slap on the back. <br />
<br />
Lucas grinned and winced at the same time. &quot;Neil here got his hands on something good. I heard it was DBol. That&#39;s what people are saying.&quot; He chuckled as he added in, &quot;Got any extra DBol for your buds?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa, whoa,&quot; Neil said, putting his hands up to stop the line of thought, &quot;No Dianabol for me. But that was kind of why I wanted to talk to you guys. Have you noticed anything, well, you know, odd?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Brock asked, looking confused. Lucas had a similarly uncomprehending expression. <br />
<br />
Neil couldn&#39;t believe it. Could they actually be oblivious? &quot;You know,&quot; he tried to explain, &quot;Changes. People here at the gym getting so much bigger. Some people getting smaller. Everybody getting a bit more, I don&#39;t know... adventurous with one another.&quot; Neil hated how he sounded. He was beating around the bush instead of just saying what he wanted to. <br />
<br />
Brock beat him to it. &quot;You mean all the fucking?&quot; He flashed a toothy grin. <br />
<br />
Neil was taken aback by the man&#39;s bluntness. Of course, that bluntness had hit at least one nail on the head: the one about the increasingly sexually-charged environment among the gym&#39;s younger men. &quot;Uh, I guess so, yeah.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Look, Neil, a bunch of young muscleheads, half of them amped up on half a pharmacy full of performance enhancers... well, why wouldn&#39;t they be going at it like rabbits? Fuck man, I&#39;m jerking off half a dozen times a day, and that&#39;s separate from actual sex!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Besides, from what I&#39;ve heard, we&#39;re not the only horny ones around here,&quot; Lucas added, giving Neil a sly look. &quot;Sandra was telling us earlier about how &#39;gifted&#39; you are. Made you sound like quite the stallion!&quot; <br />
<br />
Neil blushed at that. Sandra had really said that? He tried to redirect the conversation. &quot;Yeah, well, uh, you got me there. We hooked up last night. But what about other changes? People suddenly having these crazy gains?&quot; <br />
<br />
Brock looked thoughtful, then his eyes widened as if he&#39;d suddenly remembered something. &quot;Didn&#39;t Matt say he was going to get with Sandra last night?&quot; he asked Lucas. The smaller man nodded, and then both of them looked over at Neil. &quot;Did Matt join you guys or something? The way Sandra talked about it, you two went on a date and then basically had sex all night.&quot; Brock scratched his chin thoughtfully, his giant arm bunching up, muscle mashing against muscle. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, something like that,&quot; Neil admitted, his voice rapid. &quot;But that&#39;s not what I wanted to talk to you guys about. I just wanted to know if you&#39;ve noticed changes in people recently.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Lucas responded, &quot;I&#39;ve noticed you&#39;re looking surprisingly hot these days, Neil. I don&#39;t know why I never noticed it before.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm, yeah...&quot; Brock added, his voice becoming a low, seductive growl, &quot;Neil here is looking downright fuckable. Although from what Sandra said, he&#39;s a first class fuck-machine too!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Guys, that&#39;s not what I-&quot; Neil began. But Lucas and Brock stepped closer to him, their faces intent, bearing lascivious smirks. <br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s hit the steam room,&quot; Brock purred, putting a big, rough hand on one of Neil&#39;s shoulders, &quot;We can see if your dick is as amazing as Sandra was saying...&quot; Beside him, Lucas grinned and nodded in agreement.</p>
