<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mike and Sarah talked while they cuddled, Mike’s using her chest as a pillow and her arm cradling him in close, giving Mike some keen insight into some of the bigger-picture changes. Sarah, as expected, had no awareness that anything was any different from just a little while ago. She was a construction worker, which made sense given her massive musculature. It also seemed like she talked with the other women at the site like he would normally expect men at a construction site to be, though he noted that she seemed to generally get along with her coworkers more than expected. A few things seemed to stay the same - she preferred wine coolers over beer, still expressed interest in going to the club as they normally did on weekends, still cared a great deal about her hair (though this now extended to her facial, body, and pubic hair) with weekly hair appointments and insisted on spending time that evening grooming her chest and stomach hair to perfection, and she still had the same ticklish spot right at the small of her back (which had become harder to reach due to her increased weight and size). <br />
Some phrases seemed to change too. The phrase “grow a pair” became “use your hole”, since women were typically the tougher gender. The term used for a weak person, formally ‘pussy’, had become ‘shaft’, and terms like ‘himbo’ and ‘bimbo’ seemed to have flipped their meanings, so a himbo would be a man who is a ditzy slut, and a bimbo is a muscular kind dumb and horny woman. Apparently Sarah did not think she was muscular enough to be a bimbo, citing women that were far taller and more muscular. She also called him “Mikey” or “Little Mikey” to her gal friends, which he surprisingly didn’t mind. <br />
After a long talk though, Sarah began to doze off. Mike hadn’t noticed until he heard her start snoring, which encouraged him to quietly slip away, not feeling tired himself. He got dressed, though this time finding new clothes, a massively oversized grey T-shirt that he suspected once belonged to Sarah. He sniffed it, and confirmed it definitely had the stench of her sweat on it, which he loved. <br />
He made his way back to the living room, passing by the bathroom to grab the book. He sat on the couch and opened the book to the same page he was on before.<br />
He was surprised that not only was the text change made there in permanent printed ink, but the descriptions that were listed had become more detailed. He read through the new details of secondary sex characteristics:<br />
<br />
<i>Testosterone affects the development of males after puberty and includes:<br />
-Breast Development: Growth of breasts, with the development of mammary glands.<br />
-Hip Widening: Widening of the hips.<br />
-Body Fat Distribution: Increase in body fat, particularly around the hips, thighs, and buttocks.<br />
-Menstrual Cycle: Onset of menstruation, indicating the beginning of reproductive capability. A male will menstruate approximately every 28-34 days, lasting for 1-4 days. During this time, their penis will remain fully erect and ejaculate sperm-concentrated semen frequently, which has a high chance to cause a pregnancy if ejaculated into a female. This can be controlled with masturbation and sex, or will occur when needed automatically. They will experience rapid mood swings, heightened arousal, and may experience other effects on a person-by-person basis. The ehaculation can sometimes be incredibly painful as well. Semen ejaculated when a male is not menstruating will not contain sperm and therefore cannot cause pregnancy.<br />
-Skin Changes: Smoother skin with changes in skin texture and elasticity.<br />
-Voice Changes: Slight deepening of the voice, but not as pronounced.<br />
<br />
Note about males: the sperm in a male’s testicles is limited in quantity, Once it runs out, when the male turns around 50-60, they will begin menopause, during which they will experience effects such as hot flashes, sagging of breasts, inability to ejaculate, or even inability to become hard.<br />
<br />
Estrogen affects the development of females after puberty and includes:<br />
-Increased Height: It is uncommon to see a female shorter than 6’<br />
-Facial and Body Hair: Increased growth of hair on the face, chest, and other parts of the body.<br />
-Voice Changes: The voice becomes deeper due to the enlargement of the larynx and lengthening of the vocal cords. Most females exhibit voices within the bass range.<br />
-Muscle Mass: Increase in muscle mass and strength, with a more pronounced muscular build. Most females find it incredibly easy to build and maintain muscle.<br />
-Bone Structure: Broader shoulders and a more angular jawline. Bones are denser to accommodate muscular growth.<br />
-Body Odor and Sweat: Increased production of sweat and changes in body odor. This odor is known to be considered pleasant to males who are attracted to the female.<br />
-Adam&#39;s Apple: More prominent due to the growth of the laryngeal prominence.<br />
<br />
Note about females: Due to the need to always produce eggs to make pregnancy possible, females are able to produce a virtually infinite number of eggs, and will create enough to fill their womb daily unless pregnant. This constant creation of eggs also requires the female to ejaculate via orgasm at least once per day, or they will begin to experience extreme discomfort from the large quantity of eggs held in the womb. The constant production of eggs also causes an exponentially higher amount of estrogen in females compared to testosterone in males, leading to an extremely exaggerated appearance of secondary sex characteristics. This also causes near constant arousal in females, though most are able to keep it under control when necessary. Lastly, this causes the female metabolism to be incredibly fast, requiring a female to consume a minimum of 5,000 calories per day. This also causes females to burn body fat incredibly fast, even able to notice differences after a single workout, and makes it difficult for a female to gain body fat.</i><br />
<br />
“Holy shit…” Mike said loudly, forgetting his girlfriend napping in the other room momentarily until he once again heard her snore. <br />
“With all these extra details… I don’t think I can change it back at this point…” He frowned, but after looking down at his slim and slender body, and the cleavage he showed through the neck hole of the oversized shirt, his frown turned into a smile. “Not that I mind… really…” He giggled to himself. He was enjoying this more and more with each passing moment. Like this, he could have the perfect curvy, busty body without it being ruined by pregnancy. He didn’t have to take charge, Sarah would. He could play with his body at any time, and he loved being topped by the massive muscle machine that was sleeping in his bed.<br />
But that got him thinking: How have social norms changed? He thought about the topic and flipped the page, seeing ‘Social Norms by Gender’ at the top of the page:<br />
<br />
<i><br />
Males:<br />
Males are seen as the predominantly weaker gender in all regards. They are weaker, more easily injured, and have too many of what is widely referred to as ‘weak spots’: the breasts, the penis and the testicles. As a result, they are socially restricted from any kind of labor intensive jobs. They are also considered mentally weaker, as they are unable to prevent ejaculation during menstruation, and as such are kept from working more than 25 hours/week and are prohibited from working during menstruation in most countries. Males are kept from most positions of power, and few males are given the opportunity to participate in highly skilled work such as doctors, nurses, teachers, scientists, or engineers. While males are permitted rights such as voting, the male vote in most countries only count as a half vote, which most people, including males, agree is fair. Males are often competitive with one another, treating the desires of females as a prize, though male-to-male friendships can happen. It is not common, but some males are treated as only being good for getting a female pregnant and are ignored once pregnancy is achieved.<br />
Males are expected to be fully clothed in public at all times, though presentation of cleavage or a bulge between the legs can often be found on display in an attempt to attract a mate.<br />
<br />
Females: <br />
Females are the dominant gender in every way. They are physically larger, carry a significantly less risk of injury, and their bodies are developed solidly and are much more durable than those of males. As such, they hold 95%+ of positions of power in both the workforce and government. It is widely treated as though females are the superior gender. Despite their near constant state of arousal, females are considered much more mentally sound than males. A growing belief is that females are meant to be protectors of the weaker males, and as such some females have become incredibly protective, perhaps even possessive of a male they may be in a partnership with. Females generally have a mutual respect for one another, and it is easy for females to get along with one another.<br />
Females are typically required to be fully clothed in indoor public spaces, and it is generally accepted for a female to be shirtless in outdoor public spaces. Some local governments have laws that allows females to wear only vaginal and anal coverings in all public spaces, so only an undergarment such as a bikini bottom would be required.</i><br />
