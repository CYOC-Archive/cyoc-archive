<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">An explosion occurred the next Morning at the Police Department when the new missing person report now had a new name on it. Officer Kenneth E. Crosby had disappeared from his assigned post while guarding the evidence box at the Fuller residence.<br />
<br />
Detective Ambrose Martin stood at his desk steamed and ready to charge out to the residence and have another look around. Now he had a true mystery on his hands.<br />
<br />
Just about out of the Police Department parking lot and on his way to the Fuller residence he was stopped by Merl Hopkins. Merl worked in Evidence Storage, he had been in early that morning cataloging the Fuller evidence. <br />
<br />
&quot;Detective!&quot; he called running out to Ambrose' car.<br />
<br />
Running down his driver side window Ambrose said, &quot; Not now I'm heading for the Fuller residence!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's about the Fuller case, Sir! The evidence has been tampered, one red velvet jewelry box is missing!&quot; said the upset little man.<br />
<br />
Ambrose sat there for a moment thinking, then he ran up the window, squealed his tires and in a flurry of dust headed for the Fuller's home.<br />
<br />
Detective Martin kept exact and exceedingly complete records of every event he investigated. The Lab Techs who returned to the scene mentioned in their report of a Professor Schneller and his ugly big mutt dog were inside the home when they arrived. It was his statement about Officer Cosby walking off to get something to eat that bothered him. The Fuller residence was a good mile from the nearest Gas station, let alone any place to get food. That statement was sounding factual and Ambrose wanted to interview the Professor for sure now.<br />
<br />
Arriving at the Fuller residence it took Ambrose less than half an hour to find the missing Officers coat, bullet proof jacket, shirt, tie, pants, shoes, socks, hat, gun and gun's belt tossed in the bottom of the front hall closet. &quot;If the officer went out he did it naked and would have been reported by now,&quot; thought Amborse with a chuckle. <br />
<br />
Calling on his radio he ordered the Lab Techs to come out for a extreme sweep of the foyer and study at the scene. Now seemed a good time to question Professor Schneller.<br />
<br />
2121 Mocking Bird Lane, the condo home of the Professor Schneller was an impressive place, but what caught the Detective's eye was a sign at the entrance to the complex which stated no pets allowed. This was a condo association rule and Schneller had not a pure bred dog but a huge and ugly mutt as reported.<br />
<br />
Standing at the front door to the condo apartment the Detective noticed a new shovel and a bucket filling of what looked so as dog poop. This suggested that the dog was a very recent purchase.<br />
<br />
A ring of the doorbell brought an ugly man to the front door, Ugly was Schneller in attitude and not facial. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm Police Detective Martin, I have some serious question for your Sir!&quot; said the Detective as he walked into the apartment. Scheller without a word followed Ambrose into the living room where the big dog was sitting not on the floor but on a dinning room chair. A plate and soup bowl of breakfast food was being devoured by the animal. A bowl made to hold salad was to it's right filled with water. The dog gave a calm look to the Detective and returned to licking up the dry  Frosted Flakes.<br />
<br />
Turning to face the Professor Ambrose began to ask, &quot; You were inside the Fuller home last night when the assigned Officer left to walk out to eat as you stated to the Lab Techs?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, just for that moment I stayed after the man walked out!&quot; replied Schneller as the dog still munching looked their direction.<br />
<br />
&quot;Big dog, well trained for a Mutt!&quot; stated Ambrose as he looked to the silly scene at the table.<br />
<br />
Schneller said nothing but the big dog turned to look at the Detective while munching his flakes and growled.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have a problem, you were in the residence for some time without an Officer present and my Evidence Room Manager tells me a red velvet jewelry box is missing from the evidence gathered at the scene, do you have that box Sir?&quot; asked a staunt looking Detective.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woof!&quot; came from the big dog sitting at the table.<br />
<br />
&quot;Say what Ken!&quot; replied Ambrose as the big dog jumped from the chair and pranced over to stand next to Ambrose. &quot;I see we have a strange situation here!&quot; said Ambrose as he petted the big dog's head. The Professor looked first to the big Mutt, then to the Detective, and then to the dog.<br />
<br />
Suddenly the dog began showing it's teeth and growled at the Professor.  The Detective stepped away from the dog as then the dog stopped his growling and moved over to again sit by Ambrose.<br />
<br />
The Professor excused himself saying he need to use the bathroom. Ambrose sat down on a chair as the big dog came again over and panting happily it looked at the Detective.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ken?&quot; asked Ambrose questioningly.<br />
<br />
At the name the big dog seemed happier yet as his pink and circumcised cock popped out the huge hairy sheath. Ambrose stared at the cock not being perverted but seeing the shape of the cock head. He knew that the dog and the list of people's names on the Professor Fuller's list were connected.<br />
<br />
Again Ambrose said, &quot;Ken, would you like to go with me to the Police station?&quot;<br />
<br />
With that the big dog's cock came out a good twelve inches erect. He jumped up with his front feet into the Detective lap and began to lick his face.<br />
<br />
Pushing the dog away the Detective feeling somewhat foolish asked, &quot;Ken, does the missing jewelry have anything to do with you being a dog?&quot; To which the big dog stood up on it's tall hind legs, placing it's front legs over the Detective's shoulders. The dog stood there with his cock now out fully erect and reaching his big head close he barked softly into Ambrose' ear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright Officer Cosby go out and stand by my vehicle till I come out!&quot; ordered the Detective.<br />
<br />
Dropping down the big dog pranced to the front door and sat down to wait for Ambrose to open the door. Then the door open he pranced down the sidewalk and came to sit near the passenger side door of the vehicle. Ambrose closed the front door and awaited Schneller's return.</p>
