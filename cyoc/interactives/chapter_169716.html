<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Joey stretched as the sun now shone into Melissa&#39;s apartment. It was morning now. Slowly Joey now got out if bed, not wanting to wake Melissa as he looked himself over.<br />
<br />
He realized now that he would have nothing to change into after taking a shower. While he could probably just conjure new clothes into existence, it would be a bit of a pain.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joey turned to see Colleen exit the bedroom. The middle aged gamer was still dressed in her clothing from last night and nursing a pretty good hangover. Colleen paused as she now glanced at Joey and Melissa.<br />
<br />
&quot;How drunk was I,&quot; she asked. &quot;Did we have a toga party something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Something like that,&quot; Joey smirked. &quot;How you feeling?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Need coffee badly,&quot; she groaned. &quot;By the way, what time is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A little after 8,&quot; Joey said as he checked his phone. Colleen smirked as she made herself a cup of coffee before rushing over to the bed. &quot;Out of the nude girl its Saturday morning you know what that means?&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa stirred, slowly getting up as she now watched Colleen flip thru channels. &quot;Ugh seriously Colleen,&quot; she groaned. &quot;Cmon you know the cartoons suck now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know that,&quot; Colleen stated. &quot;Everyone knows cartoons reached perfection in 2004, it&#39;s a scientifically proven fact. Still, old habits die hard.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa simply groaned, gathering the sheets around her as she made her way towards the kitchen. &quot;Are you taller,&quot; Colleen asked as she curiously gazed at her friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Long story,&quot; Melissa smirked as she now made herself some coffee. &quot;So find anything good?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Colleen groaned as she continued to flip thru channels. &quot;Ugh this is annoying. Man I just wish cartoons were as good as they were when I was a kid.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa raised an eyebrow, looking between Colleen and Joey. Apparently Colleen had forgotten about Joey. Looking at Joey she could see an impish smile spread across his face. Joey was about to grant that wish and twist it just enough to have some fun with Colleen. Melissa could only grin, giving Joey a slight shoulder shrug of approval.<br />
<br />
Colleen squealed with joy as she finally found something, unaware of the fact Joey had begun making her younger. Melissa could see that Colleens body seemed a bit slimmer while her face appeared fresher. Now 25 again the woman happily began pointing towards the t.v.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pokemon,&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;Oh my god Missy! I havent seen this since I was 6. I cant believe I was able to find an original episode.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Must be your lucky day,&quot; Melissa said sheepishly. &quot;By the way, did you say 6?&quot;<br />
<br />
Colleen nodded excitedly, taking a sip of coffee. Melissa could only grimace, realizing Joey had just decided on how old to make Colleen again. Hopefully when this was done she wouldnt be forced to babysit.<br />
<br />
Melissa simplybwatched now in fascination as Colleen continued agreeing backwards. Once more back in college, Melissa could see the womans face was a bit fresher than before while her body appeared toned.<br />
<br />
As Colleen journeyed backwards through college and reentered high school, Melissa saw the &#39;freshman 15&#39; melt off her body. Now only 18, Colleen looked every bit the fresh faced high school senior with a lean teenage body and firm teenage breasts. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow this coffee really took care of my hangover,&quot; the now 18 year old said in awe. &quot;Missy is this a different brand?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No same as usual,&quot; Melissa said quietly. &quot;You feeling alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
Colleen happily replied yes, still absorbed in her show and unaware of her continuing regression. Melissa watched as her now teenage friend absentmindedly adjusted her baggy clothing.<br />
<br />
As Colleen continued her backwards trip, Melissa just simply watched. Colleen was becoming skinnier by the second. Now 16 and rapidly approaching 15, the teen took a sip of coffee, grimacing at the taste.<br />
<br />
&quot;Missy can you grab some sugar for me please,&quot; a now 15 year old Colleen whined.<br />
<br />
Melissa did as she was told, stunned to see her friend transformed into anwaifosh young teen once more. As she approached she had to stifle a gasp.<br />
<br />
Colleen didnt look old enough to be in high school anymore. The coltish teen looked like a middle school student, her. Breasts barely B cups with barely flared hips. The girl was now reliv9ng her last growth spurt in reverse, her cuff of her shirt now slowly beginning to slide over her hands. As Melissa handed Colleen the sugar she looked up at Melissa before taking stock of herself. &quot;Hey are you shrinking me again?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um sort of,&quot; Melissa replied meekly.<br />
<br />
Colleen gave her friend an odd look as she became 13 and headed for 12. As she studied her body she now noticed her small breasts and barely flared curves. Slowly a look of realization crossed her face as she became 12.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit I&#39;m a kid!&quot;<br />
<br />
Joey and Melissa stifled a laugh as the now grumpy pre teen glared at them with all the sternness her childish features could muster. &quot;What the fuck Missy,&quot; she chirped, grabbing onto her pants as they threatened to slide off her boyish hips. &quot;Why am I turning into a kid?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you did kind of wish for it Colleen,&quot; Melissa replied, rubbing her neck. &quot;You did say you wish you had cartoons like when you were a kid.&quot;<br />
<br />
Colleen opened and closed her mouth before sitting down on the couch. She was only 10 now, puberty having completely abandoned her. The girls clothing hing on her like a sack, her bra hanging uselessly on her flat body, while she felt like she was literally swimming in her pants.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh I dont have anything to wear Missy,&quot; Colleen whined. &quot;And I&#39;m getting real short now. Can you fond me something to wear?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably,&quot; Colleen said. &quot;And if not I&#39;m sure wish boy can make your clothes fit.&quot;<br />
<br />
Colleen frowned as she entered single digits. The grumpy child crossing her arms across her chest, her cheeks blushing in embarrassment as they flapped. &quot;You know I have no intention of being an easy child,&quot; she grumbled.<br />
<br />
Melissa smirked ruffling the young girls hair as she dropped from 8 to 7. &quot;Aww you too cute to be grumpy kiddo,&quot; she chuckled. &quot;Turn that frown upside down.&quot;<br />
<br />
Colleen simply stuck out her tongue, settling down as she now once again began watching cartoons. &quot;So am I going to be little for awhile,&quot; she asked as she shrank down to 6.<br />
<br />
&quot;At least until the cartoons are over,&quot; Joey said. &quot;Just enjoy for now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Colleen simply sighed, trying to get comfortable in her oversized clothing. Joey simply chuckled as he thought of what to do next.</p>
