<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was a Saturday morning in Seattle and Jack Crawford was busy making phone calls to various brokers in Seattle and New York. While there is no trading done on Wall Street during the weekend; Jack knew that after hours trading was risky, knowing that Knight Industries stock went down forty points since their failed takeover of Tachibana Enterprises was the sign he was waiting for. Jack knew that the share holders would be jittery and soon be demanding answers; this made him grin. Benton would be forced to go on the defensive for a change.<br />
<br />
Jack instructs each trader to begin on Monday buying up blocks of stock as the price continues to drop. Instructing each trader to keep the transactions small; limiting each one to ten thousand dollars so as not to attract too much attention. Instructing them to use specific accounts under the name of Ashford to further hide his identity. Jack knew that Benton will undoubtedly realize some one was buying up stock to try and force him out. Jack knew he didn&#39;t have enough capital to do that; but if he could get back what Benton stole form his father, Jack would be satisfied.<br />
<br />
Jack never liked having to use the Ashford pseudonym; but when Benton engaged in a nasty proxy fight to force his father out of the company he helped to found, Jack knew it was best to remain under the radar. He crafts an email to his father; also a were living a quiet life so as not to draw too much suspicion regarding his age. The email states; ‘soon we will no longer need to hide in the shadows. Our legacy will once again be in our hands (paws). Benton will know that the Crawford&#39;s will be back in his life, whether he wants it or not.’<br />
<br />
Jack hits send; knowing that his father will call up in a few hours. He already rehearsed what he was going to say. Jack was even going to surprise his father by letting him know that he was engaged to be married. While Jack’s proposal to Kenya was awkward and tense; Jack was hoping that her business back in Moon Lake regarding Nate Anderson would come to a conclusion in a few days’ time.<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
Kenya Adaeze was camped out in the forest behind the Anderson house hold; after being hauled to jail along with Jack and his chauffer, Kenya was not deterred in confronting Nate. Still upset that he chose to dump her via text after not getting answer from her; she had every intention of giving him a piece of her mind.<br />
<br />
Where she was lurking; Kenya knew that no one could see her. While she did have a great view of the back portion of the house, she didn’t see Mike Lawson’s car pull up as Nate and Liv get out. Nate being made to get a change of clothes for his younger brother Eric. His punishment for playing hooky on Friday. Using her binoculars, Kenya scans the windows; despite the blinds being pulled, Kenya was hoping for movement. Someone to open blinds or step out; she wanted to see if anyone was home. Kenya was determined to sit out all weekend if needed; but would try to risk a confrontation at Nate&#39;s school on Monday if her weekend camp out bore no results.<br />

Tachibana No Akane was back at her estate after attending and early morning council session. Sitting in her Zen garden, she was chatting with the two representatives of the White Tiger Clan. Knowing that they wanted Frieda emancipated and running Knight Industries; Tachibana fingering the USB device they gave her will make the difference in enacting their plans. Yet she was hesitant to use it.<br />
<br />
After last night though finding out that young Eric Anderson was attacked by Benton himself, despite warning him of the consequences; Tachibana knew she had no choice. She sent a message for her grandson Daisuke to join her and the tigers; it was time to fill him in on the Skulk’s life debt to the White Tiger clan and their request to discharge said debt. Tachibana was going to fulfill her promise of war to Benton.<br />

John Shafer an fourteen year old six foot werewolf was enjoying the first time he could sleep in on a weekend. Living with his aunt; the only family he has left. After what his mom did; getting drunk and stealing a car that the Talbot’s intended to restore as a wedding present for a friend; John knew his mother was in the county lockup in Seattle. Yet after talking with Sheriff Cooper; John found out that his father did not leave him as he was told. John sr. was killed why serving a warrant during the vicious gangs wars going on in Seattle.<br />
<br />
Finding out his father ensured that his pension and life insurance would go to him; John knew he was set for life. After Friday he told his boss at the catering company he worked at that he was handing in his two week notice. Telling his boss of his inevitable windfall in four years’ time; John felt like a large weight was lifted. While his boss was sad that he was losing a capable albeit untrained pastry chef; he assure John that he could come back at any time. After all, who else could make Profiteroles and Croquembouche as well as John?<br />
<br />
While John did plan to enlist in the military to take advantage of the G.I bill to help fund his education as a professional chef afterwards, he now wasn’t sure if that would be necessary. Having more money then he knew what to do with did give him plenty of choices; expensive choices for culinary school. Still John wanted to keep his options open and did decide after talking with his aunt to find Spencer Lawson’s father and talk to him regarding military service.</p>
