<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Time seemed to slow to a crawl and unable to do anything but watch in horror as the doorknob turned and then door started to open, Mark stood frozen before the bathroom vanity and sink. His mind leaping back to how he had felt upon finding that he had walked into the wrong bathroom, he knew he should call out, announce his presence, do something, but, before he could, he found himself face-to-face with his mother. And then what he thought was the oddest thing happened.<br />
<br />
Instead of saying anything about seeing her son dressed in girl&#39;s clothing, Mark&#39;s mother stopped and simply commented, &quot;Oh, Abby, I didn&#39;t know you were already up,&quot; and as Mark tried to grapple with what was happening, he listened as his mum said, &quot;I thought it was your father. You haven&#39;t seen him have you? He said he might stay over the night.&quot;<br />
<br />
Things suddenly felt disjointed and as he remembered that, though not divorced, his dad, whose name was also Mark, and his mom had decided to take a short break in their marriage. Recalling that his dad was currently living with a friend, though did stay over every so often, Mark, who didn&#39;t have the same middle name as his dad, which he was thankful as it saved him from the title of junior, slowly shook his and told his mum, &quot;No, sorry. Haven&#39;t seen him in a while.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; his mom replied and as she backed, she told him, &quot;Sorry to barge in on you like that. I&#39;ll have something prepared breakfast, if you&#39;d like,&quot; to which he told, &quot;Okay,&quot; and, &quot;Thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alone once more in the bathroom, suddenly aware of how he was dressed, how the skirt forced him to hold his legs together, thus keeping his man junk tucked back between his legs, he heaved a sigh of both relief that his mum hadn&#39;t said anything about the way he was dressed and in agitation as to how weird and confusing everything suddenly seemed to be. Wondering if maybe he should skip breakfast and head home to get changed, he took one final look at his reflection before turning off the light and slipping out of the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Back down the hall to the guest bedroom, he noted as he went that, despite how the skirt ballooned out at the point his legs started, it still managed to restrict his movements him. Kept from spreading his legs, he mentally observed that in the process it was keeping his cock tucked firmly, but comfortably, betwixt his legs, whilst, at the same time, forcing his steps to be short but purposeful. Stepping inside the room, he stopped and tearing his attention away from the skirt he was wearing, he peered at the room, looking for clues that could possibly help him put together what happened between meeting Sara and waking up back at his mom&#39;s place.<br />
<br />
The sandals, which he noted had thin black bands that would partially cover the top of his feet whilst the bottoms were brown and had a slight heel to them, were the first to catch his eye. Not giving it a second thought he squatted down and picked them up. As he did so, he noticed the pair of underwear and clutching the shoes in one hand, he scooped up the underwear, which was the similar style to what he had touched the necklace to, but not the same colour. Standing, staring at the lacy, pastel purple panties, somehow knowing it was called a thong, Mark tried to figure out why had taken them off, but not the rest of what he was wearing.<br />
<br />
At a loss, certain that he must have been wearing them, he sat down on the bed and after staring at the underwear a moment longer, he dropped the sandals back onto the carpeted floor. Having never been one to go in for freebuffing, unaware that his word choice was for girls, he pulled the panties on until they were up to his knees. Shifting in place he slipped his feet first in one sandal, then the other. Standing, he pulled the thong the rest of the way up, disturbed that he was wearing such a garment, but deciding it would have to do until he could find something decent to wear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like what I am supposed to wear, what a guy wears,&quot; he groused as he was forced to push his skirt up until it was bunched up around his waist. Wrestling with the undergarment, finding himself disturbed that he liked how soft it felt, how cute it looked in, how low it rode in the front, he arranged it so it get his man junk was tucked comfortably back. Satisfied with how it hugged him, and that the underwear did not ride to far up his butt crack, he then to his attention to tugging the skirt back down.<br />
<br />
Panties feeling so comfortable that it almost felt like he was wearing nothing at all, his skirt pulled back down, Mark took a moment to arrange the garment so it sat and looked proper. In the process of doing this, he discovered three, small black buttons that were almost invisible against the garment. Undoing the top one, Mark found that it allowed the skirt to be taken off, as it appeared to unfold the fabric enough so that it was no longer wrapped so tight. Buttoning it back up, he took one last swipe at the skirt in an effort to smooth the front before turning his attention back to the room. Eyes roving over the empty room to finally settle on the dresser, he saw that there was a purse sitting on top of the chest of drawers. At first hesitant about picking it up, let along looking in it, he soon resigned himself to that he probably should as he walked over to the dresser and opened the purse.<br />
<br />
Inside he found a small bottle of perfume, a tube of lipstick, some eye shadow and a couple of bits of make up. Pulling it all out and arranging it on the top of the dresser, he then pulled out a set of keys, which he could immediately tell would get him back in his apartment, as well as allow him access to his mom&#39;s house, and then, lastly, his driver&#39;s licence and a couple receipts and two folded up pieces of paper. Ignoring the paper for the moment, he looked at his id, searching, and hoping, nothing had changed.<br />
<br />
To his dismay he instantly found that instead of capital M, his licence showed a capital F. In addition to this, his name was listed as being Abygaill, which reminded him that his mum had called him Abby. Stuffing the id back in the purse, after taking a hasty look at his picture, which still showed his male self, Mark wondered aloud, &quot;Is that my name? Abby? And is this how the amulet works? That it somehow alters the world around you, and how people perceive you, but leaves you looking like who you were before you touched it?&quot; and reaching for the bits of paper, he began to unfolding the two pieces, finding the first was Sara&#39;s address and phone number, whilst the second was a phone number from a guy named Thomas.<br />
<br />
Not in the mood to deal with the fact that he not only had likely been hit on by a guy, and that he had gotten the dude&#39;s phone number, Mark folded the pieces of paper back up and put them back in his purse. Unaware that he had started to think of the purse, and the clothes, as his, he gazed at the receipts, all from a store in the mall that catered to teens and young adults, before huffing, &quot;Deal with this later,&quot; and starting to put every back in the purse, he again experience one of those slips.<br />
<br />
Suddenly finding himself standing in the bathroom again, his make up set on the sink, he gazed at his reflection, which now had a hint of make up applied to it. Sniffing, realising what he was smelling was the perfume, which he was certain he had spritzed himself with, Mark groaned. Tempted to remove what he had put on, he didn&#39;t as he found that not only did he think he looked cute, but that he also liked wearing the stuff. Switching coarse, he put the make up and perfume back in his purse and hoping his mind wouldn&#39;t have any more slips, he absently brushed a lock of brown hair back and exited the bathroom again. Starting downstairs, thinking over what he needed to do, and what he should do, he decided that, as soon as he got home, and he changed his clothes, he was going to find Edgar and find out more of what exactly the Amulet of Zulo did and why it seemed to have changed so much, yet left him looking like a dude in drag, even if nobody could see him that way.<br />
<br />
&quot;Breakfast is ready,&quot; his mum called and distracted from his thoughts, Mark changed course and decided that first, he was going to have breakfast, then get home for answers and change of clothes.</p>
