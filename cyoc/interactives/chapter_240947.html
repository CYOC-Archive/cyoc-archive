<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Sylvia. You think it&#39;s a good idea? What if the baby isn&#39;t born this week but she is overdue?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer heard man&#39;s voice from downstairs. Jennifer used her energy to lift herself up from the bed and quietly opened the door to hear the conversation that her mother seemed to have with a man who she couldn&#39;t recognize by voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Paul. Calm down. We&#39;ve gone over this multiple times. I notified the school that Jennifer’s sick and I&#39;ve called my mom to be ready when the water breaks.&quot; Sylvia&#39;s voice echoed in the hallway.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s not the issue here. What if someone finds out what really happened? My life and career would be ruined.&quot; The man whined.<br />
<br />
&quot;Paul, I repeat. Calm down. I’m not going to throw you under the bus. You know that I love you despite what happened that night. I&#39;m thinking about your and Jennifer&#39;s best here. I don&#39;t know how our family is cursed but we&#39;ve gotten used to by now and this is the best we can do. I knew that one day she would be pregnant at that age, just like I was, and I don&#39;t blame you. I should have made sure that the condoms were disposed when we used them.&quot; Jennifer’s mother replied back with a calm tone. “Back when I was little I heard stories from my mother how my great-grandmother and her mother used to have it more rough. My grandmother changed all this and came up with this system, which she named a generational skip, this let’s Jennifer to live a normal and healthy life without worry. Also before you ask, I don’t make the rules, I just follow them.”<br />
<br />
Jennifer’s brain was updated with more memories. She was able to now vividly remember that night when she got pregnant. Jennifer was listening to her favorite music track with her headphones until she found herself sneaking into the master bedroom. She didn’t remember how she ended up in there. Jennifer could remember that she felt too restless and excited to go to sleep that night. <br />
<br />
Jennifer wanted to hear her mother’s moans more closer to calm herself down. Jennifer had taken an opportunity to go inside when Paul and Sylvia were in the showers. Jennifer had slide herself under the bed with the tape recorder in her hand. During that night Paul’s used condom had slipped next to the bed where Jennifer was lying. Jennifer had grabbed the used condom and pressed it’s contents inside her with her finger. Jennifer imagined that she would have loved to have a husband like Paul to take care of her baby. Jennifer felt envious that she couldn’t have Paul to herself as Jennifer was too young to get married with him. Jennifer remembers herself smiling as she had gotten something. The recording of the night’s noises.<br />
<br />
Jennifer hold her head. She was able to remember clearly what she had done in the past. Another unplugged memory had surfaced in her mind as it was blocked by something. Jennifer had a strange feeling in her head. She felt dizzy all of a sudden and had to sit down.<br />
<br />
Jennifer wondered was the curse able to modify her memories. To her it felt weird living inside a retroactive past where every action she made had bigger consequences in the future, but then again. She wasn’t able remember all the details that were life changing events for her. Jennifer was smart but even for her mind that kind of task felt something that she couldn’t do. It was like she was asking from her brain how many breads she had eaten in her life time. The missing gaps in her memory felt off-putting. Jennifer could only hope that her mind kept her up-to-date with the most important changes. Jennifer didn&#39;t know how many memories she had in her brain that felt unimportant but were crucial for her survival.<br />
<br />
Jennifer walked back in front of the full-body mirror and looked at her figure. Did she really come up with the idea to become a mother or did the curse force her legs to choose that path. Jennifer was able to control her urges but sounds of moans triggered her to masturbate like a light switch. It was like her body was reacting to them like those Pavlovian dogs for treats. Jennifer remembers losing control of the body the moment she heard the moans coming from those headphones.<br />
<br />
Jennifer winced as she started to realize what was going on. The curse had made her weak to moans and other sexual sounds and she was only be able to act normal if there was no such sounds present. She could only describe her feeling being more submissive and agreeable whenever she heard moans which made her legs tremble. Jennifer looked at her normal looking room as all the trash and the stains had been cleaned. This made the implication even more clear as everything looked good on the surface but under the hood she was a total mess. Did Jennifer’s mother Sylvia know this. <br />
<br />
Based on her mother’s past actions and cryptic speeches Jennifer had witnessed. It would sound reasonable that her mother acted a bit strange, even to her own daughter, as nothing else made sense. Why would her mother talk and act like that. Jennifer went once more through the conversation Sylvia had with the man. There was a small light bulb moment in Jennifer’s brain as she gasped in front of the mirror. How did her mother know about the curse in the first place. Was Jennifer’s mother causing Jennifer to become younger. Was she the one messing with Jennifer’s memories and if so, how did her mother do all this.</p>
