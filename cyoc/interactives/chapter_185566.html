<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was a tropical paradise and Jack had time yet to play around a decide what he wanted to do with himself. But one thing called him and that was the beach. He stayed in his room only long enough to toss on his trunks and flip flops and sling a towel over his shoulder. He exited out the far end of the wing, past the water park and out into the sunny stretch of white sand. Each of the three branches of the hotel had it&#39;s own stretch of beach, and even those stretches were divided into smaller sections.<br />
<br />
There was a family beach, a kiddie cove, a surf beach, and then there was a part sectioned off by a tall fence, but there was music and laughter coming from that beach as well. He creeped closer and read the sign by the entrance, though he really didn&#39;t need to.  A couple in their thirties gave him a smile as they passed him and went through the gate, stripping off their clothing once they were past it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nude Beach 18+ Only&quot; Read the sign. At sixteen Jack was still tall, and sports had filled him out over the last year. As long as he acted like he belonged he could pass for eighteen he thought. Probably. He eyed a beautiful blonde as she strode past him and into the beach area, pulling off her top a few steps in. With her back to him he couldn&#39;t see anything. She was followed by a muscular young man and Jack could see what hung between his legs after he took off his trunks, flashing between his thighs as he strode further into the forbidden beach.<br />
<br />
Jack chewed his lower lip, his hormone riddled teen mind wanted nothing more than to go in there and ogle all the good looking people without a stitch of clothing on. He straightened his back and strode past the gate. He paused a few steps in to remove his own trunks and fling them over his shoulder with his towel. He tried not to blush as he felt his, thick, semi-hard cock flopping free in front of him. He wasn&#39;t the most well hung guy back at his school, but he knew he was above average. Certainly that&#39;s why he felt eyes on him. He just kept his back straight and walked like he had every right to be here. He didn&#39;t even feel the couple of inches his body grew as he did.<br />
<br />
The beach looked much like the family beach, except everyone was stark naked, and not a child was in sight. People lounged on towels and chairs down by the water, retable cabanas with filmy curtains took up prominent spots, there was even a small restaurant and bar with the staff as naked as the patrons except for an apron around their waists with their nametags clipped on.<br />
<br />
His shoulders broadened and his muscles swelled and hardened as he watched the bar curiously. He wondered if he could finagle a drink out of them. He knew adults could drink on the resort, and since everyone on this beach was supposed to be an adult. He scratched at his jaw, fingers rasping through his light stubble. Would it be worth getting caught? Maybe he should have aged himself a little back in the room before coming down. Would that even count?<br />
<br />
His stomach tightened into a six pack and his pectorals swelled a bit more as he looked back over his shoulder to the entrance. A quick jaunt back to the hotel room, four years added to his age, and all would be solved. But if it was that easy, why did they bother restricting alcohol to adults in the first place? He ran his fingers through the curly hairs covering his chest as he turned back to the bar and strode confidently in that direction.<br />
<br />
Every step seemed to land heavier than the last, not that Jack&#39;s mind was on that as his body became fit and muscular, the dark hair on his head shortening to something a little longer than a buzz. One woman passed him and gave him an appreciative and more than warm glance. He returned her smile with one of his own, white teeth flashing through his short but thick beard.<br />
<br />
He stepped up to the bar, well-furred, muscular forearms crossing as he rested them on the bar top. He took a stool, finding sitting on it with no clothing on to be an odd experience, his muscular rear and even his balls coming to rest on the sun-warmed plastic. One of the bartenders turned to him, a smooth and well muscled man in his mid-twenties, his somewhat long blond hair and rich tan gave him a beach bum or surfer vibe. &quot;What can I get for you?&quot; The tag clipped to his apron read &quot;Myles.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jack opened his mouth and closed it again. He didn&#39;t know what to order but then he just fixed the bartender with a confident smile. &quot;Surprise me.&quot; He was worried he would have squeaked the order from nervousness, but his voice sounded deep and baritone, even in his own ears.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing.&quot; Myles responded with a smile, starting to mix something in a blender. Soon a white slush in a glass was set down in front of him. &quot;Pina colada, extra rum.&quot; The bartender said with a smile. &quot;Room number?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A52.&quot; He answered without thinking, then glanced at the bartender who was tapping it into his computer console. What information did that thing have? His age? Would it even allow alcohol to be charged to his room. He thought he&#39;d go grey from the stress. After a moment Myles grinned at him. &quot;Enjoy, Mr. Folders. Let me know if you want a refill.&quot; And like that he was off to the next patron.<br />
<br />
But someone was quickly taking the seat next to Jack, already with a drink in hand, clear with mint leaves floating in it. Jack looked over to the new arrival. He was handsome ruggedly, with well-tanned skin and blond hair much like the bartender. A little slimmer with a swimmers build, but also with an obvious coating of thick blond hair across his chest and down his stomach and a blond beard. An otter he thought the guy would be called. Jack had learned some things since he figured out he was bi. He was maybe in his early thirties and grinned lasciviously in Jack&#39;s direction. &quot;You caught my attention.&quot; The man said at Jack&#39;s questioning look. &quot;Are you here alone?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jack sipped at his drink, still eying the guy next to him, curiously. Then nodded. &quot;Yeah.&quot;<br />
<br />
That seemed to make the man smile more. &quot;I&#39;m here with some friends but they wandered off elsewhere.&quot; He slid a hand over to Jack&#39;s thigh, caressing the heavy muscles under the light dusting of hair on his upper leg. Jack&#39;s cock jumped at the touch. Was he really being hit on? This guy must be twice his age! &quot;I gotta say, even in this wing not many have the confidence to wear older ages, but then, I doubt many look as good as you do. Name&#39;s Hunter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Older?&quot; Jack felt himself asking quizzically.<br />
<br />
Hunter just grinned and laughed. &quot;What, get hit with something?&quot; He nodded to the mirror behind the bottles displayed in the center of the bar. Jack&#39;s eyes widened. The man staring back at him was almost unrecognizable. In his late forties or maybe even fifty, he had strong, square features, darkly handsome with rough features that accentuated rather than making him look old. He still had a full head of hair cut short, salt and peppered, a little more pepper than salt, though his beard was a little more salt than pepper. He could just make out wide shoulders and a powerful chest in the reflection and instead looked down.<br />
<br />
How had he not noticed changing. He was built like a brick wall. Powerfully muscled despite his age, even still managing to sport a solid set of abs. His biceps bulged as he ran his hands over the greying hair on his chest. He must have look dumbfounded because Hunter laughed softly and clapped him on the shoulder. &quot;So I guess you&#39;re not normally an older, sexy, muscle bear?&quot; Jack just shook his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I guess you learned something about yourself today. I won&#39;t ask your real age, it&#39;s considered a bit rude around here to do so, but...&quot; Hunter eyed Jack up and down again. &quot;If you want to explore your new body with a bit of privacy my friends and I rented one of the cabanas. It&#39;s all mine at the moment, I could use some company.&quot; Hunter&#39;s hand slid up Jack&#39;s thigh, perilously close to his cock.<br />
<br />
Jack gulped softly and looked around. A few people were looking their way but it was with interest rather than disapproval. There were quite a few.. displays going on in full view he finally noticed. Nude beach? This was a straight up sex beach. Jack looked back to Hunter..</p>
