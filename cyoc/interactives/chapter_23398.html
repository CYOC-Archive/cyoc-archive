<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tiff let go of her new little penis. It wasn't too bad, nothing that she couldn't hide if she dressed right, but that didn't mean that she was happy about it being there. The sensation of having that little extra something between her legs was terribly distracting, giving her all the more reason to make sense of the strange fruits and finding a way to reverse what they had done to her and Katie.<br />
<br />
She was just starting to towel off when her little brother pounded in the door, &quot;Did you fall in?&quot;<br />
<br />
Luke could be such a brat sometimes and he brought out the sarcastic side of her, &quot;I was taking a shower, you know, with soap.&quot;<br />
<br />
On the other side of the door she heard soft laughter. Wrapping the towel around herself she opened the door to tell him to take his friends back outside to play.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen you little-&quot;<br />
<br />
Her voice failed her in mid-sentence and her brother burst out laughing, &quot;I just wanted to tell you that Jared is here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jared, her boyfriend was standing right behind her little brother, looking quite amused at the sight of her dripping wet and clad in nothing but a towel that was beginning to slide down slightly on one side, threatening to expose her breasts. The only further sound she could manage was an embarrassed little squeak as she ran to her room to get some clothes on. From there it was a race to make herself presentable. During the excitement of the day she had forgotten that Jared was coming over for a little study session.<br />
<br />
Throwing the towel to the floor she began to get dressed. Dressing was relatively hassle free, though she couldn't help but let out a small gasp at the way it felt when she put her panties on, the feeling of the smooth fabric against her new penis was something that was going to take a lot of getting used to until she could find a way to reverse the process. The jeans she put on also felt a bit tight over her new anatomy, not uncomfortably so, just enough to press against it and fill her crotch with odd sensations the likes of which she had never experienced before. On the bright side, she realized that if it got hard, as penises tended to get, the tough fabric would hide it.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can come in now Jared, I'm just combing my hair,&quot; she called out, knowing that he was standing just outside the door.<br />
<br />
He stepped in and closed the door behind him, &quot;You look like you had a rough day.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tiff threw the comb down on her bed and sighed, &quot;You don't know the half of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sitting down on her bed, Jared motioned for her to do likewise. She gladly complied, leaning up against him. He responded by putting his arm around her shoulders and she immediately began to feel better. Having done the best she could so far today she decided that she would have a normal night and get back to work on the problem tomorrow. Working herself up into a panic wouldn't do her or Katie any good.<br />
<br />
It was obvious that Jared was waiting for her to tell him all about it so he could go through the motions required to make her feel better, even though his just being there was almost enough. Sighing she explained as much as she was willing to, &quot;I'm having a bit of a problem with something I think has to do with biochemistry, but I'm not sure. It's been giving me a real hard time and I'm done with it for the day. That hour long shower I just got out of was my attempt to wash it all away.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry,&quot; Jared hugged her closer as he spoke, &quot;I finished my homework while waiting for you and there's nothing I want to go over. We can just relax for a bit.&quot;<br />
<br />
That was what made Jared so great, he was willing to accept that there were times when she just needed him to be there, no talking and a minimum of romance.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can tell you about my day. Hearing about what happened in chemistry class might make you feel better.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tiff laughed, &quot;I heard the explosion all the way from the band room, what did Lizz blow up this time?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In short, the teacher needs a new desk and the emergency shower had to be taken apart to stop the flood. The long version of the story is even harder to believe.&quot;<br />
<br />
Laying down along side Jared, Tiff closed her eyes and listened to him talk, simply enjoying the sound of his voice and the way he ran his fingers through her hair as he spoke. Pleasant little shivers ran down her spine and she felt her penis start to get hard, reminding her that all was not as it should be. She tried to ignore it, but it didn't go away, the feelings in her crotch increasing to a throbbing tension. More than anything she wanted it to stop, or to try and make it stop, but she didn't want to squirm or rub at it. Then she would run the risk of ruining the moment, even more than the feelings from her crotch already had. Like many guys, even when he was being sweet, Jared had the uncanny ability to pick up on when she was feeling in the mood for slightly more physical romance. In a situation like this such a thing would be disastrous, creating the risk that he would discover what had happened to her.<br />
<br />
His story about Lizz and the destruction of the chem room was a helpful distraction, and when he got to the end, where Lizz slipped on a chemical spill that she had been responsible for, slid across the room and caught herself on the handle of the emergency shower pulling hard enough to break it and start a flood, Tiff couldn't help but laugh.<br />
<br />
After that she was able to excuse herself for a moment, saying that she had to go to the bathroom.<br />
<br />
It was a little awkward, walking with an intense, though not painful, throbbing in her crotch, but she was able to manage. Locking the door behind her when she got in, she pulled down her pants and saw the bulge of her penis through her panties. Pulling those down she noticed how much bigger it looked erect, but that was the nature of penises, to get big and hard when their owners felt so much as slightly turned on.<br />
<br />
Aware that it wouldn't stop on its own Tiff gently stroked herself and shuddered. It felt good. She took it in her hands and squeezed slightly, feeling it throb in her grip. Her pussy started to get wet, adding a new aspect to the intense need welling up in her crotch. Rubbing and squeezing she brought her self toward climax, disgusted and fascinated by the feelings coming from her penis. She brought her other hand to her pussy, imagining Jared having sex with her, plunging into her, that it was his hands on her penis. The juices from her pussy were beginning to flow, getting on her hands and making everything slick. She imagined that Jared was licking her penis, running his tongue up and down its length, taking it into his mouth and sucking, teasing it with his tongue.<br />
<br />
When she orgasmed it felt like an explosion, everything in her crotch tightened and then she felt even more liquid on her hands. Her penis rapidly softened, returning to its previous size, no larger than her thumb. Looking at her hands she saw that all the fluid was clear, like that which flowed from her pussy. It made sense since she had no balls with which to produce sperm. What amazed and worried her the most was that the orgasm had been focused almost entirely in her penis.<br />
<br />
The sooner she got rid of it the better.</p>
