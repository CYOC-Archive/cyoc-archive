<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The mimic stared them both in the eyes, it was almost as if he was looking at them both directly at the same time. Sophie and Dale gulped, frozen in shock and fear as they watched the mimic think about his next moves. They were completely under his control. They couldn&#39;t do anything about it, and the mimic chattered happily knowing this. He also knew he had the power to change the physical forms of those caught in his spell, and that&#39;s exactly what he was going to do. <br />
<br />
Sophie and Dale could only stare in fascinated horror as the mimic slowly brought his balled fists to under his armpits, bending at the elbow. He subtly bent his knees and lent forwards ever so slightly. Both humans followed his every move. They could only watch as their fingers slowly turned inwards, clenching into fists. Despite every possible internal fight against it, their arms slowly moved to their sides, and they stuffed their balled up hands into their armpits. Then, they bent their knees, and slightly lent forwards. The mimics eyes shone with joy and pleasure, and he decided to focus on Sophie first. Then Dale can watch his magic before succumbing to its effects himself. <br />
<br />
The mimic started to &#39;flap&#39; his arms up and down, while staring directly at Sophie. She followed suit without any physical protest. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dale...&quot; She started, flapping her arms slowly. &quot;I feel... funny...&quot;. Dale may as well have been glued to the floor. He couldn&#39;t move his feet, fingers, arms stuck in his armpits; anything. All he could do was helplessly watch as Sophie seemed to move like a chicken. The mimic started to bop his head back and forth, Sophie following his every move perfectly. The mimic sped up. <br />
<br />
Soon, Sophie was bopping her head and flapping her arms vigorously, but never ran out of breath. She realised she was shaking, almost, vibrating with her every move. <br />
<br />
&quot;Bu.. bu... what&#39;s going...&quot; Sophie half breathed, half clucked. She felt the strangest tingle in the pit of her stomach. It felt wrong, but so right... and so nice. The mimic screeched with monkey-joy. <br />
<br />
Sophie&#39;s balled up fists melted into her armpits, fusing her folded arms in place. Suddenly, her skin began to tingle. Sophie gasped and moaned, feeling scared but also feeling incredible. She had never felt such a warm and magical sensation, like sparkling pins and needles all over her skin. She glanced down and realised; feathers were starting to grow on her skin. <br />
<br />
&quot;BUUU-&quot; She cawed in shock. Dale bit his lip, frightened by what he saw but also somewhat excited. He was watching Sophie change right in front of his very eyes in such a strange and magical way. <br />
<br />
Sophie could only watch helpless as feathers spread around her body, making her folded arms grow and stretch steadily into a large pair of wings. She felt the magical tickle climb from her arms, and spread over her chest and down to her stomach. She noticed the tingling in her stomach was even more intense, she had never felt such a pleasurable sensation. The mimic decided to enchant Dale to help make the transformation faster and more intense for Sophie.<br />
<br />
Dale felt a strange release and relaxed momentarily, his folded arms dropping to his sides. He gasped breathlessly, upon realising he was still somehow being controlled by this little creature. His fingers started to twitch and move around by themselves, moving vigorously. Moving so much faster than should be possible. Moving towards Sophie. <br />
<br />
&quot;Buk... Dale? What are you...&quot; Sophie questioned, watching Dale move up behind her with fingers scribbling the air with lightning speed. Dale couldn&#39;t stop himself. He was completely under control by this mimic. He stopped directly behind her for a second, never looking away from the mimic&#39;s magnetic gaze. The mimic smiled and slightly nodded his head. Dale pounced. <br />
<br />
&quot;BUUUUUU!!!&quot; Sophie screamed as Dale&#39;s fingers met her ass, vigorously tickling the soft flesh. He scribbled and tickled with every ounce of possible energy. Sophie was in tortured bliss, it was so ticklish but soo so good. Her nerves felt like they were on blissful fire, sparks of energy emanating from his every stroke. Feathers sprouted at a much faster rate, completely covering her ass in a matter of seconds. Dale moved down to her thighs, scribbling and squeezing the soft flesh. Sophie trembled in silent laughter, really enjoying these amazing sensations. Dale planted his fingers deep in the pits behind her knees, torturing the sensitive flesh there. Sophie thew her head back, panting from the pleasure and pure excitement. Dale moved and started massaging her legs, that became thinner and thinner with every bit of pressure. Every movement he made moulded Sophie&#39;s legs into the scaly thin legs of a chicken. The mimic walked over to the pair, and compelled them to sit down on their butts, legs straight out in front of them. They followed suit, firmly plonking themselves on the ground. Sophie&#39;s new tail feathers spread out beautifully behind her. The mimic chattered and never stopped gazing into Sophie&#39;s eyes as he gently pulled off her shoes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Buk.. buk... stop this...&quot; She pleaded in vain, as the mimic himself started to scribble his fingers across her soles. Sophie screamed in sheer delight, overcome with the feeling. She never stopped moaning as the mimic tickled between her toes, and she felt her feet stretch and grow, her toes becoming longer. The mimic tickled, massaged and moulded her toes into three stems, pulling them into perfect form. The mimic continued to scratch and brush his nails over her poor unprotected soles until they had changed into perfect chicken feet. She shook, an intense pleasure washing over her as the tingle in her stomach became almost too strong to handle. <br />
<br />
Suddenly, she felt something almost drop inside her, and send fireworks of pleasure to her pussy. The tingles increased further, and she started to buck her hips and rub her crotch on the ground. Her pussy contracted and convulsed, twitching and vibrating. Suddenly, she hopped to her feet and squatted down, moaning as a large mass rubbed against her from the inside. She pushed and pushed, and suddenly she laid a perfect egg.</p>
