<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Having spent another week waiting for word to spread around about her opportunities, Selicia set about another round of catch and release. The house staff had long since relocated the former interviewer to another room to be dealt with in the future. Spending so long just giving without getting much other than the basic reward for the service left her yawning of boredom by the end of the day. So many wishes would&#39;ve been too easy to turn over or they just failed to pique her imagination. Not that she normally mind easy fixes... <br />
<br />
So it was with today as well, the woman before her was rather... portly... Flashbacks of that pig woman from before sparked in her mind. At least this one had a mind to keep her hands to herself. The woman wore a yellow checkered dress suit paired with a flowery red pillbox hat. Her brown hair was graying but, those hazel eyes told Selicia that something was on her mind. &quot;What can I do for you, Miss...&quot; Selicia trailed off hoping to prompt a response from the woman. Reaching into her oversized bag, the woman gently pat her face with a handkerchief.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bordeau, Madam. Miss Bordeau.&quot; She spoke as primly as she&#39;d managed to sit on the right hand couch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Miss Bordeau, then. What could I do for you then?&quot; Selicia repeated her request eyeing her while she again searched her bag.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, it&#39;s not what you could do for me... Its what I can do for you.&quot; Miss Bordeau proceeded to pull out a box from her bag about a hand spawn around and half as much deep. Opening the box, revealed several small vials of a faint yellow liquid. She handed one to Selicia before continuing her statement. &quot;This is our most recent product in our beauty line of essential oils. Guaranteed to make your skin smoother and perk you up in the right ways.&quot; She accentuated the line with a conspiratorial wink.<br />
<br />
Selicia eyed the fluid in the vial flatly before turning the same flat gaze toward the woman. This was not actually happening was it...? &quot;I see, well... That is lovely, Miss Bordeau but, what of your de...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No no, Sweetie. We&#39;re talking about your and keeping your beauty now.&quot; Miss Bordeau cut off Selicia mid-statement as she reached to take the vial back. &quot;Certainly you don&#39;t want age to spoil your looks do you?&quot; She giggled in a practiced sort of way as she stowed the vial back in its box. &quot;When I saw you on the television the other night, I just knew you&#39;d be the right match for this product. So I hurried over to consult with you as soon as possible.&quot;<br />
<br />
Annoyance prickled on the back of Selicia&#39;s neck as Miss Bordeau pressed forward in her verbal offensive. Hearing her terminology, Selicia gathered how she might&#39;ve gotten here to perform this grand scheme of hers... She&#39;d have to talk with her staff later on about some screening measures that may need to be put in place. &quot;Thank you for your concern but, I can manage my appearance quite well on...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dearie, no! I can assure you that this oil of ours is far easier than whatever regimen you use.&quot; Once more, Miss Bordeau spoke before Selicia had finished.  Waving her hand dismissively, she reached into her bag pulling out a pamphlet to hand over to Selicia. &quot;In here, you&#39;ll find our payment plans as well as other products we sell.&quot;<br />
<br />
Taking the pamphlet curtly, Selicia&#39;s gaze upon the woman hardened. Maybe she could be a bit softer about the situation, hmm? Now that sounded like a plan of action. With a subtle flick of the pamphlet, Selicia started a process to soften not her but, Miss Bordeau. Having felt mercy flee the room quickly before her actions, she sped up the process. Within a moment, Miss Bordeau had another pamphlet in hand fanning herself. &quot;Is something the matter, Miss Bordeau? You&#39;re looking a bit flushed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, well... It is a tad hot in here suddenly isn&#39;t it?&quot; Miss Bordeau divested her hat and jacket onto the couch next to her. Already sweat had started showing through her white dress shirt. &quot;A little heat has never stopped me before though.&quot; She laughed softly as she fanned harder with the pamphlet she held. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, yes... I see you&#39;ve got quite the selection here...&quot; Selicia feigned to be reading the pamphlet as she converted the woman&#39;s shoes into a shallow basin. &quot;What do you say we take this outside?&quot; Selicia stood and stretched languidly seeing Miss Bordeau becoming increasingly soaked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-Yes, maybe some fresh air would help...&quot; Miss Bordeau stood and attempted to take a step forward, only to find that she could not. Staring down at her feet, she found them stuck to the basin they now resided in. Perhaps more unsettling was a similar faint yellow fluid slowly pooling within. &quot;What, what&#39;s going on here?&quot; She trying to pull her feet loose only to find the basin getting closer and the fluid deeper.<br />
<br />
Selicia watched as the woman quickly melted into the basin, she was melting rather than sweating as she might&#39;ve thought. Though her stockings were steeping into the pool at her feet, Selicia stepped over to grab hold of the clothing she could. &quot;I suppose you&#39;re right Miss Bordeau, this really is good for me. So therapeutic after so long of not getting my way.&quot; She watched the woman&#39;s face sink into the collar of the shirt. Another few minutes and the change finished with a few minor bubbles. Not that she was fond of the method or the speed of it, she felt the end justified the means however.<br />
<br />
Taking the former woman&#39;s hat in hand, she pressed her finger in the center to create a funnel. Next, the rest of the attire was converted into portly bottles in the approximate shape of Miss Bordeau&#39;s physique. Manual labor truly was rewarding in the right circumstances as she slowly poured the fluid into the bottles. The cork was in the rough shape of her head and placed back into each finished vial. Selicia dumped the original vials into the leftover bag and filled the box with a more... &quot;effective&quot; alternative. &quot;Marina, Darling!&quot; Moment&#39;s later the young woman was at the door taking in the strange vials. &quot;See to it these are delivered to the address shown here.&quot; She placed the pamphlet on the box of vials and turned back to her removal of the other personal effects.<br />
<br />
A week later, the box of returned vials showed at the head office of the beauty company. There was a kind note was attached proclaiming that this new batch would have remarkable effects. Of the tests that followed, they truly did. One woman found her ass had toned itself quite wonderfully while another who had been flat stepped out of the room boasted large D cupped breasts. Each of the board members in turn sported drastic changes to their bodies. One by one, the number of vials dwindled as a massage here, a drop there, and even a sip or two consumed the precious oil. The women reveled in their new found assets eventually finding that the vial on the table to be the very last one. Buxom beauties and Sultry Seductresses eyed each other each in turn, as one they leapt for the vial to alter themselves further.<br />
<br />
The local coverage of the ensuing brawl had been an unexpected delight as Selicia regarded one last vial in her hand. &quot;You certainly did as you claimed.&quot; She sat the vial on the table and reclined back with a grin.</p>
