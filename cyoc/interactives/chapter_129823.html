<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dan walked hand-in-hand with Peter, gossiping about what their latest trip to the salon would entail and slowly started shifting his thoughts to what was on the inside rather than the outside. More specifically, he started wondering about what was inside Peter&#39;s pants. The newly fambloyant twink hadn&#39;t had much experience with sex aside from the occasional gay porn video, but Sean&#39;s newest command into the Chronivac made think about it more and more. Peter, responding to the changes in Dan&#39;s psyche, released his grasp of Dan&#39;s hand and cupped Dan&#39;s ass. The foreign feeling was not unwelcome by Dan, who looked at Peter with increasingly slutty smirk. Maybe they&#39;d take a detour on the way to the salon see just how much Peter was packing underneath, Dan thought as his cock began to lengthen.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Luke, Ryan and Mike were rushing to their classroom on begin another practice the Math competition next week. They only had so much more time to prepare, so it was time for them to pedal to the metal. They had no time to waste; so much so that they hadn&#39;t even looked up from their books long enough to notice the newly minted sexy twinks in their way and crashed straight into them, spilling their books all over the floor.<br />
<br />
Luke, captain of the Mathletes, was the first to look up and notice the couple they ran into, much to his displeasure. He was raised a good Christian, and certainly did not approve the couple&#39;s &quot;lifestyle&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Watch where you&#39;re going faggots!&quot; he yelled, sealing his fate.<br />
&quot;Yea, no one wants to see that gross shit,&quot; Ryan said in response. He might&#39;ve been a nerd, but that was better than being gay, he thought.<br />
&quot;Go back into the closet where you belong!&quot; added Mike, not wanting to be outdone. He might not have had a problem with their sexuality, but he was not going to be left out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry babes, we&#39;ll be more careful next time. Although, I can&#39;t say I&#39;m disappointed by bumping into you boys,&quot; said Peter, licking his lips in response.<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ll get out of your way and let you have your alone time&quot; Dan said with a wink, and with that they walked off, butts cupped in each other&#39;s hands. The sluttiness command was really starting to take hold and they were really just trying to get into the empty hallway right by to get some alone time.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s so disgusting&quot; Luke spat, brushing a lock of his lengthening blonde hair aside. Weird, he thought, he usually kept it close cropped. It wasn&#39;t like he was trying to impress anyone. He was saving himself for a girl until marriage.<br />
&quot;Yeah, that&#39;s why I can&#39;t handle this school sometimes,&quot; Ryan explained, picking up some papers. The school started getting more liberal in that regard and he hated it. &quot;It so shouldn&#39;t be allowed. They should be focusing on, like, Calculus and physics and stuff, not they&#39;re &#39;hot bods&#39;,&quot; he continued, using finger quotations on the last words, even though he increasingly started thinking about those skinny jeans and hot tops.<br />
&quot;Come on boys, let&#39;s just, like, forget about them. We&#39;ve got a hella important competition coming up and we shouldn&#39;t be focusing on their -- I mean those dicks&quot; Mike responded. He needed to work on his new technique for the competition. If he squeezed his dick right as he buzzed in, he found he was much more likely to answer those integration questions he so often struggled with. He needed to practice timing it just right to show to the judges just sexy-- no smart, he could be.<br />
<br />
The boys continued picking up books and papers, not realizing that more than a few times they lingered too long against each other&#39;s shrinking and increasingly slutty clothing. The plain, dark blue polo tee Ryan was wearing was shrinking more and more into a sky blue tank top to match the new highlights in his brown hair. Meanwhile, Mike&#39;s glasses were disappearing into earrings and numerous bracelets. He had gotten one for each guy he&#39;d kissed. He was now firmly bi, not that he&#39;d tell the other boys.<br />
Luke&#39;s change was becoming the most dramatic. Apparently, the more heterosexual you were beforehand, the more twinky you became. His khakis quickly shrunk to a pink Daisy Dukes and his black &quot;God is great&quot; t-shirt starting morphing into a pink &quot;Gay is great&quot; shirt. You know, to match the pink highlights in his hair. He didn&#39;t know why he wore that shirt, he was mostly straight, wasn&#39;t he? Then again, he remembered that always being good favorite shirt cause it showed off his taut midriff.<br />
<br />
&quot;Boys, like, why are we doing this competition?&quot; Mike asked. He liked math and all but sex was so much more fun. He had bracelets full of beads (for every guy who fucked him) to prove it. He didn&#39;t want to be doing math all the time, he wanted sex all the time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cause the guys are totally cute and, like, so much fun to fuck. Who wouldn&#39;t love having a competition for that,&quot;  Ryan, now preferring Ry-Ry, explained. Getting fucked in front of crowd was so much fun, he thought with a laugh, as his AP calculus class, drained out of him. He only took the basics needed to pass until he could work full time at the strip club he joined the moment he turned 18.<br />
&quot;Wait, was that the competition?&quot; Luke asked. He thought it was for something else but he couldn&#39;t remember what. He remembered sucking off the principal twice just so he could approve it though. Wait, that didn&#39;t make sense, he was straight, right? He was feeling very confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, of course it was for that. That&#39;s why we brought these toys,&quot; Mikey said with a smirk. The books they previously had were now dildos, butt plugs, nipple clamps-- anything they wanted after they had a gangbang with the budget committee. Mikey was fond of that memory because that was the first day he took two guys in his boypussy at once. It was definitely not the last.<br />
&quot;That doesn&#39;t make sense!&quot; Luke shouted. Why would he do all this? Wasn&#39;t he a good, religious boy? Wasn&#39;t he saving himself? Why did he want to get fucked so bad? He stratched his ass and remembered the cute tattoo he got there. &quot;Slutty cumdump&quot; all in cursive letters. He wanted to impress the judges at the competition, didn&#39;t he? That&#39;s why he got it. But he was waiting for the right girl, he thought. No, that couldn&#39;t be right, he&#39;d taken too much dick for that. Images of cocks and ass and his incredible fuck sessions with Ry-Ry and Mikey and whoever was willing swirled in his mind as his cross turned into a gay pride flag. The only thing he was religious to was dick, he thought with a slutty smile. There wasn&#39;t a person in the world who worshipped it more than him. He looked over at his besties who had clearly been unable to wait until they got into the room and laughed. They were, like, totally slutty twinks, he thought. He heard moaning down the hall. Could it be those two cute boys from before, he wondered. He smacked Mikey&#39;s half exposed bubble butt. They should find out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Boys! Let&#39;s, like, totally find us some cute studs to fuck&quot; Luke said. He was the slut of the school so of course he had to find them. He had a reputation now to uphold.</p>
