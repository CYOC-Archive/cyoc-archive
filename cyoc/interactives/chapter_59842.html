<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br>"Brandon... I have to be completely honest with you, I really have no idea. Even though I have been on this cruise several times now, this is 
the first time I have been on this deck." Ben said in all earnest.</br>
<br>"Really? Can I ask where you stayed before?" You ask with increasing curiosity.</br>
<br>"Yeah, nothing wrong with that I suppose. Let's see... well for the first time aboard, being the first time I ever got a transformation, I took 
the fantasy deck." Ben said smiling.</br>
<br>"What do you mean, the <em>fantasy</em> deck?" You ask as your eyebrow furled.</br>
<br>"Well, that deck was created to allow your greatest fantasy to come true, the only thing was they said that there were limits to that deck. 
Like, a few guys had wondered what it would be like to be a werewolf or other were creature, but that was not possible on that deck. All that 
deck was capable of was making men how they wanted to be physically and allowed them to play out some of their deepest role-playing 
fantasies."</br>
<br>"Oh... ok... I think I understand..." You say, unsure of yourself. "What was your fantasy if I may ask?"</br>
<br>"Well..." Ben said while pausing and grabbing the back of his head with his massive palm cupping it. "I wanted to be a beefy, furry 
construction worker with a thick cock who was arrested and forced by a cop to engage in gay sexual activities. I also pretended that I was 
straight and didn't want it, but slowly working up to accepting it and enjoying every moment of it. Of course, I enjoyed the whole 
experience."</br>
<br>"Wow, I bet you did! So why is this the first time that you are up on this deck?" I asked.</br>
<br>"Up until this trip, the deck had been closed off for remodeling. It really was intriguing because the cruise line wouldn't let a single 
person up here, but it also sucked because it meant that all of the usual outdoor activities were either cancelled or scheduled at one of our 
ports of call. The thing is... who would do boat activities on shore when we were  stuck on board for a day or two, depending on where the next 
destination took us. People were free to do what they wanted, to experience a new place and explore. Although, I am sure there were some that 
would enjoy it... I know that wasn't something I wanted during my trip." Ben said plainly.</br>
<br>"Wow... that really would suck to be honest. Although, I suppose having a surprise like this must be pretty awesome too!" You say 
with an innocence in your voice.</br>
<br>"Yeah, this really is a nice surprise Brandon... and I am glad that I get to share it with a guy like you." Ben said with a tender smile, his face 
glowing and his eyes glistening.</br>
<br>You look into his eyes, seeing how beautiful they really were. His eyes had the most brilliant shade of blue you had ever seen, with what 
looked like specks in them that looked like the stars themselves were captured permanently in them. As you gaze into his eyes, you feel 
yourself being drawn to him, your noses almost touching tip to tip, your lips growing closer till they touched. As your skin met with his, you felt 
like electricity flowed through your bodies, coursing as a single and unified current. Slowly, you and Ben broke off the very plain kiss, only to 
go back for another, this time being more into it, lips overlapping, tongues swimming and exploring the confines of the other's orifice. 
Tongues were wrestling for dominion over the other's mouth. It was long, sensual and felt that as long as the two of you were swapping saliva.. 
time 
itself stood still.</br>
<br>As the two of you broke off from the sensual kiss, each of you gazed into the other's eyes, peering into the very depths of the others' 
soul. It felt so good, so amazing, you both felt that it was heavenly to say the very least. Wanting to make things a bit more special and 
romantic, you put up a finger for Ben to wait for a second as you walked over to the bed, pulling off the comforter in a big heap, then putting it 
on the ground for the two of you to have something soft to lay on while gazing up at the stars as the night faded in, slowly revealing the 
bright and luminous stars in the heavens. You and Ben held hands laying there, enjoying the moment. Slowly, as the light from the sun 
diminished, a star popped into visibility, one by one until millions of stars could be seen as well as the light from the full moon as it made its 
way across the night sky as if it were dangling by a string, being manipulated to be in perfect position by an invisible puppet master. It was so 
awesome to lay by someone who made you feel like the whole world stood still, allowing the two of you to enjoy one another completely, 
gazing up at the sky and holding one another's hand in a loving embrace.</br>
<br>Suddenly, you feel a slight jolt of energy run from the very top of your head to the tips of your toes, eliciting a low and soft moan from 
you both. Not expecting to hear the other, you look at each other and smile, ecstatic to be experiencing things together like this. 
It felt magical, as if you two were soul mates, feeling exactly what the other felt. Smiling, you roll onto your right side as he rolled onto his left, 
lovingly looking upon the other, enjoying the moment in its fullest. Ben places his free hand on your exposed, upturned cheek, feeling your 
sandpapery face.</br>
<br>"God I love a man with sexy, thick and dark stubble like you have!"</br>
<br>You sigh consolingly. "I like just being next to you!" You finish saying romantically.</br>
<br>Ben's whole face lit up like the fourth of July, his eyes twinkling like the stars above you, taken aback by your loving words. As you study 
his face, you notice that it had sprouted thick stubble coating the entire thing like normal. Thinking it was just you imagining things, you rub 
your eyes and see that you weren't seeing things... he really did have thick stubble where he had been shaved, except for his already neatly 
trimmed goatee... which was also thicker than before. Chucking it up to the transformative abilities of this cruise, you just enjoy what was being 
given to you. Ben was gift enough and you really didn't need anything else. Before getting on this boat, you knew it was a possibility to meet 
great guys like Ben, but you couldn't have imagined in your wildest dreams that you would have met your soulmate on board. As Ben softly 
rubbed your face with his thumb in a partially explorative nature, he caught sight of something that he thought was a bit 
odd. Looking closer, Ben noticed that your ears came to a slight point, but didn't pay too much mind to it. He just wanted to lay there the rest 
of the night with you and whether or not you both experienced what this deck had to offer in the transformative nature, was of no consequence 
to either of you... as long as you got to stay together.</br>
<br>"Man..." Ben started to say, but quickly stopped... not expecting his voice to be deeper than what he was used to. He wanted to say what 
was on his heart and mind, so he continued. "I... I think I am in love with you Brandon!"</br>
<br>Hearing those words, you felt your heart soar, making you feel lighter than air, as if you could float right off the boat. Wanting to 
reciprocate the feeling, you dive in for another passionate kiss, but you both notice something odd. Upon individual inspection, you each 
notice that your top and bottom I-teeth were slightly longer and sharper than normal, as if they had shaped into fangs. You and Ben light 
up like Christmas trees on Christmas morning, realizing what the guy at the check-in counter was really saying when he made his pun. You 
two, as well as every other guy on that deck would literally be having a <em>howling good time</em> during your stay. Not really caring 
though, wanting to experience what the cruise had in store for you both, neither of you took another thought on it,returning to what felt 
good. At that very moment, kissing and fondling each other's flaccid cocks was what felt right, which neither of you were willing to fight.</br></p>
