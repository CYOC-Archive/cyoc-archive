<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Felix could feel his ugly 671 pound jackass body changing but the pace of his return to being a 171 pound 16 year old boy was agonizingly slow, it seemed to him. <br />
<br />
As he felt his tail shrink away to nothing and his giant donkey rump steadily diminishing back of him, he looked up past his foot long muzzle at his sister in the window of his bedroom. She was smiling with such delight that it made him nervous. Why is she enjoying this so much?<br />
<br />
From her older brother's desk, Tina watched and smiled. Oh, Felix wasn't that bad in her estimation, but the prospect of playing the best joke ever on her brother was too delicious to resist. As she continued to watch, jackass Felix's oversized ears became human sized and his muzzle retracted as his face returned to human shape. His neck shortened and his body continued to lose mass. His big jackass belly shrank away to nothing and the ugly hair that covered his body disappeared like wisps of smoke in a breeze.<br />
<br />
&quot;Almost there&quot; said Tina to herself &quot;hope I got the recognition stuff right&quot;<br />
<br />
Down below in the dark of the back yard, Felix felt his body still changing. He was almost back to normal now. His feet and toes emerged from his rear hooves and his front hooves cracked and split and he had hands and fingers again. Felix looked himself up and down and saw that his bones and muscles were back to normal. Finally, his ridiculously long and thick equine penis shrank back to his still impressive human dimensions. He let out a long sigh of relief.<br />
<br />
But . . something was wrong. He still felt a sort of vibration inside his body after all the outwardly visible changes had stopped.<br />
&quot;What the . .?&quot; Felix mumbled and gasped and covered his mouth with one hand. It hadn't been his voice but the high pitched voice of a girl. Tentatively, he tried again as he felt the vibrations within him increase, if anything.<br />
&quot;What did you do to me?&quot; Felix said slowly but heard the words come out as if spoken by a ditzy girl with a slightly bubble gummy voice. He went to cover his mouth again but stopped with his hand in front of his face. That's not my hand! <br />
<br />
Felix inspected the dainty looking hand with shorter fingers and watched in shock as his fingernails lengthened to an inch long and turned painted pink.<br />
&quot;No!&quot; said Felix in anger, suspecting what was happening but before he'd even finished that single syllable, he felt himself shortening a couple inches and then grabbed at his waist with both of his new feminine hands. It was as though Felix's waist was in a vice. It had always been very narrow, at the base of a V shaped torso. Now, that torso was losing pounds of muscle each second, shoulders narrowing each moment and that waist squeezed to about 2/3 the width of 2 minutes before.<br />
&quot;Nooooooooo&quot; Felix felt like crying but stifled the impulse as he felt his narrow, muscular butt widen and become a luscious, full woman's ass. Even more humiliating were the two full, mango sized breasts that suddenly grew on his emaciated chest like two balloons attached to faucets. The disappointment of that was topped, though, by the sight of his proud penis shrinking to a tiny fraction of its size and becoming a clitoris that quickly disappeared inside the vagina that formed out of his scrotum disappearing inside him. <br />
&quot; . . . . . oh . . . . . . . &quot; Felix let out only a tiny sound to express the tidal wave of emotions washing over her. As she tried desperately to gather her thoughts, she felt the last parts of her transformation. Her strawberry blond hair cascaded in lovely curls and waves down to her shoulders. Her jaw narrowed, her mouth became smaller and her lips fuller. <br />
<br />
Felix ran to the back window of the darkened garage and stared angrily at the reflection. In the glass was a 15 year old, 5'10&quot; tall 117 pound knockout, a smoking hot babe with a slender hourglass shape who could be a fashion model and who was Tina's fraternal, non-identical twin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Goddam it, Tina! This isn't funny! I'm your big brother!&quot; Felix called up to the window in a high, sultry voice.<br />
<br />
Tina thought otherwise and laughed hysterically at the sound of Felix's voice.<br />
&quot;Tina!&quot; Felix was enraged now and went to the base of the brick wall of the house below the window. She'd easily climbed it a couple times as a 6'1&quot; 171 pound boy, using exposed edges of slightly oversized bricks to pull himself up. She started climbing but it was so different, so much harder. <br />
This body had so much useless mass, thought Felix disgustedly, feeling her widened buns almost pulling her down and the nipples of her pendulous breasts rubbing against the bricks and mortar. But worse than that was the loss of strength. Felix glanced across her shoulder as she grunted to continue progressing up the wall and noticed the complete lack of muscle mass or definition. <br />
<br />
Felix grunted some more. It seemed hopeless, but the laughing voice of Tina above her &quot;Woooo nice tits Felix! And how's the big new ass working for you?&quot; drove Felix onward. At last, Felix got her soft skinned, hairless forearms into the window. To her surprise, she felt Tina help pull her inside. With a tumble, a gasping Felix careened over the desk and onto her back. For a few moments, Felix's emotions swirled. Humiliation at the climb being so difficult. Anger at Tina. And yet, shockingly to Felix, somewhere in there, as she looked down the length of herself was a tiny bit of pride at her new knockout body. But anger was predominant. Felix got to her feet and nearly ran at Tina.<br />
&quot;Give me my body back!&quot; Felix snarled in her soprano as she grabbed Tina's wrists. She looked around the room but didn't see the chronivac. They struggled, pushing back and forth. Tina saw Felix's fantastic tits swinging back and forth and smirked. <br />
&quot;What great yabos!&quot;<br />
Felix looked down from Tina's smile to her beautiful new breasts.<br />
&quot;Ohhhhhhhhhhhh youuuuuuuuuuuu!&quot; <br />
<br />
And then, with no warning, Felix stopped pushing against Tina. Felix blinked repeatedly. Tina looked at her expectantly. Did the initial recognition I programmed finally wear off?<br />
&quot;Felicia?&quot;<br />
Tina watched her new sister blink and as she did, the contents of the room changed. Felix's intellectual boy decor became pink and powder blue, an Einstein poster changing to a poster of ballet dancer Peter Martins flanked by one of Justin Timberlake and one featuring a half dozen Calvin Klein underwear models. Below it, Felix's spartan twin bed become a queen sized four poster with a canopy. Tina looked around her laughing at all the changes to Felix's room. She was snapped out of it by Felicia answering.<br />
&quot;Yeah? Hey, how about a little privacy, huh, sis?&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh sure&quot; Tina laughed and she gave a pat to Felicia's widened rump before starting to leave.<br />
&quot;Hey sis I don't swing that way&quot; laughed Felicia and she stepped over and touched one pink nailed finger to Peter Martins' package on his poster. &quot;I want him&quot;<br />
Tina smiled and nodded and left the room.<br />
<br />
Felicia licked her pouty lips looking some more at the beautiful dancer with his leonine head of hair and long, athletic body. Her fingers made their way naturally to her outer lips at her bush. The mere touch started a tingle. She licked one finger and ran it along them for a minute like running a finger along the top of a full wine glass, setting up a resonant vibration. She reached inside and stroked the little tuning fork that made the tingle much deeper all the while imagining being in the arms of Peter Martins. Felicia pleasured herself with the expert skill of experience. She knew what she was doing.<br />
<br />
The same thing was obvious to Tina the next day. When Felicia came downstairs for breakfast in a pair of jeans and a white lacy blouse, her clothes fit perfectly. She had on just a bit of makeup and it, too was perfect. Tina almost feared for how boys would react to the sight of this stunning girl. But as they walked to school, Tina saw her artfully deflecting the attention of this boy and that, letting them gawk and ogle and never seeming arrogant but never quite making continued eye contact or doing anything to cause them to walk up to her and ask her out. It was brilliant, because the head of every single boy they passed turned and followed her.<br />
&quot;They all want to fuck you&quot; whispered Tina enjoying the irony that all this attention was directed toward her former brother, Felix.<br />
Felicia just rolled her eyes. What can I do?<br />
Felicia had all the same classes as Tina did and they walked side by side in the halls to them, male teachers also saw Felicia and momentarily entertained thoughts of wrapping an arm around that little waist and kissing those bee stung lips, tearing off that delicate blouse, pulling down those pants and filling that . . <br />
<br />
One teacher walked right into a closed door. Another tripped down a stairwell.<br />
<br />
But at precisely 11 am, 12 hours into being the most beautiful girl in school, Felicia suddenly recovered her identity as Felix. She was listening to her pre-calculus teacher describe a derivative and wondered why he was belaboring such an easy topic. And then Felicia glanced at the front of her blouse. What the . . ?! She stared in surprise at the curves of her tiny waist where it widened out into her full, round ass and then, in shock, at the flat front of the crotch of her jeans.<br />
&quot;Oh my god. I'm a chick&quot; Felicia muttered to nothing more than raised eyebrows from nearby kids who hadn't quite heard. Felicia sat up straight. At first, Felicia almost hyperventilated. It all came back to her, her true identity as Felix Fairfax and being turned into a beautiful girl by her sister. She even remembered pleasuring herself to the sight of Peter Martins. <br />
<br />
Oh my god. How do I get out of this? Felicia looked around the room and saw every boy looking hungrily at her. Those behind her fixed on her round ass. She followed the eyes of those in front and beside her. All went to her breasts.<br />
<br />
The Felix part of her mind fumed at being treated like an object like this. Implicit in every hard edged stare, every leer, was the intention to fuck her. &quot;God! I can't let that happen, no matter how beautiful I am!&quot; Felix thought to herself and was struck by her own phrasing. She consider her own judgement, wanted to contradict it, didn't want to think of her own beauty but ultimately couldn't disagree. And as the lecture continued, hesitantly, oh so slowly brought the fingertip of her dainty right hand to her blouse at the nipple of her left breast. She slowly rubbed the soft cloth across the increasingly swelling nipple, enjoying the electric tingle that it sent through her. <br />
<br />
Abruptly, the Felix part of her mind made her stop. The Felix part of her mind saw taking pleasure in this beautiful body as a surrender to the reality of it. Even just a little tingle from a tiny massage of her breast.<br />
<br />
Felix ran out o the class room as soon as the lesson ended, with his books clutched to his chest to hide his breats as much as possiblem and tried to seek out tina as soon as he could.</p>
