<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">They'd left a note on the picnic table for Paul and Katie. They'd almost waited too long, and while Jack had theorized his friend had gotten eaten by a bear Shanna realized what was probably the reason for their delay. Best to let them have their privacy.<br />
<br />
The line wasn't too long. They'd delayed enough that most folks had already gotten their tickets and started on the trail in staggered groups. Each group was delayed a number of minutes so as not to spoil the experience.<br />
<br />
Jack had elected to be the one to hold the money and their place in line. Shanna had raised an eyebrow at his offer, but as she saw him chatting up a girl in line it made more sense. Out to find a girl who was less work than Emily, no doubt. He didn't seem to be having much luck though, which was to be expected. After about fifteen minutes and a helpless look to Shanna, he seemed resigned to his fate and waited sullenly.<br />
<br />
Shanna meanwhile sat on a large log on the sidelines, occasionally glancing in the direction of the campsites in hopes of seeing Katie and Paul. Really, anyone she recognized would be good at this point, given how restless and bored she felt.<br />
<br />
She looked at the moon, and squirmed a bit at the sight. It was a clear night, and it shone there, bright and full. Just looking at it made her feel tense, as evidenced by the tremor that had passed through her as she had looked up. She again scratched at her thigh, arching her back with a slight blush as she scrupulously avoided the space between her legs.<br />
<br />
Blessed distraction finally arrived with the sound of footsteps heading down a trail towards the main grounds. Her gaze snapped back down as she was puzzled by a feeling almost like a twitch in her ears. It wasn't Paul and Katie, but it was almost as good. Emily and Anna walked out from the trees, and Shanna's breath caught a bit as she saw Anna illuminated by the moon.<br />
<br />
&quot;H-hey,&quot; she said as they approached, finding her voice quickly. &quot;Jack's already in line,&quot; She said as she forced herself to look at Emily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alone?&quot; Emily said with a grin. &quot;Then I'd better keep him company.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shanna bit her lip, deciding not to mention Jack's earlier flirtation. &quot;I think he'd like that. He's pretty bored.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds like a plan then,&quot; Emily said with a chuckle.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll wait here,&quot; Anna said with a look that showed she was still on the watch for any shenanigans.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; Shanna replied as Emily made her way over to Jack. &quot;I was getting bored too.<br />
<br />
Anna sat down on the log with a sigh that trilled into a snarl at the end. She seemed about as ill at ease as Shanna, her hand straying to her own thigh as she got comfortable.<br />
<br />
&quot;He's pretty harmless, you know.&quot; Shanna offered as consolation.<br />
<br />
&quot;They all are at first.&quot; Anna said simply. <br />
<br />
Emily and Jack already seemed to be engaged in conversation, their friends back at the log forgotten. Shanna looked the dark-haired girl over, eyeing Anna's curled lip as she watched the line.<br />
<br />
&quot;So ah... outdoor life not agreeing with you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; Anna said, her concentration broken.<br />
<br />
&quot;You look a little uncomfortable.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, that? Hell if I know. I've had a wild hair up my ass ever since this morning.&quot; She seemed a little dismayed as she caught her own choice of words.<br />
<br />
&quot;A wild hair, eh?&quot; Shanna let out a nervous chuckle, the blush brought to her cheeks mostly hidden by the cold. Her hand once again strayed to itching at her thigh. Anna caught the movement and raised an eyebrow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy Hell, you've got it too don't you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... got what?&quot; Shanna said, backpedaling.<br />
<br />
&quot;This.&quot; Anna replied, lifting the front of her sweater and shirt to bare her midriff. Shanna's eyes widened as she saw the scattered black hairs that wound their way haphazardly towards Anna's navel. They bristled in the cold, and the dark-haired girl quickly hid them again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yeah. Had that since this morning too,&quot; Shanna admitted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Feels damned weird. Must be something in the water.&quot; <br />
<br />
Anna was avoiding eye contact with Shanna for the moment, her gaze straying skyward. Shanna looked up as well, thankful for something to diffuse the awkwardness. She felt a long-nailed hand fumble for hers, and clasped it like a lifeline.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's pretty tonight,&quot; she said softly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, couldn't have asked for better weather,&quot; Anna replied, her voice similarly hushed. There was a slight quiver in it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just sort of makes you feel... free.&quot; Shanna trailed off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like anything can happen,&quot; Anna mused, releasing the blonde's hand and reaching about to clasp Shanna's side, her nails resting on the girl's ribs.<br />
<br />
Shanna's breath caught in her throat, and she brought her gaze down, meeting the dark-haired girl's eyes. They looked at each other for a beat before Anna darted in for a kiss. Shanna found herself welcoming the contact as their lips met, returning the kiss and deepening it. Her nostrils flared as she took in the musky scent that was coming from Anna, her eyes fluttering shut. It was an odd moment of wild abandon, the first kiss ending only to be met with another, their lips  parting and tongues darting in furtively. Shanna's tongue traced something arching and sharp, one of Anna's prominent canines.<br />
<br />
Reluctantly, they both drew back, flushed and embarrassed as each scooted away from the other.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wh-what was that?&quot; Shanna stammered, looking at the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was... curious.&quot; Anna said with some trepidation. &quot;Seems like you were too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Guess anything really can happen...&quot; Shanna replied, trying to clear her thoughts in the presence of that maddening scent.<br />
<br />
A twig snapped, and both of them looked trailward in an almost synchronized movement. Eyes narrowed, looking at the approaching pair.<br />
<br />
It was Paul and Katie finally, sheepishly making their way towards their friends. Katie had a grin on her face like the cat who ate the canary. There was something a little wild about her, brown hair streaming about haphazardly in the moonlight and a strange almost predatory sway in her walk.<br />
<br />
For his part, Paul looked a bit stunned. There was a lingering bit of shock on his face, and Shanna couldn't help but smirk as she thought of what a surprise Katie must have given him. She looked over her shoulder to see Jack and Emily returning as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Got the tickets,&quot; Jack said. &quot;We ready to go?&quot;</p>
