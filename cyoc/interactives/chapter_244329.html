<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Last one for me on this one folks. Hope you enjoyed the ride. <br />
—-<br />
One day, while picking Jeff up from campus, David saw her.<br />
<br />
Jeff’s mother.<br />
<br />
She was standing across the street, laughing at something one of her coworkers said, the sunlight catching in her hair. She looked good. Strong. Like someone who had finally let go of a life she didn’t miss.<br />
<br />
She looked right past David.<br />
<br />
To her, he was just some twink in a tight hoodie waiting outside the admin building. Maybe cute. Maybe forgettable.<br />
<br />
But David… he couldn’t move. His breath caught. His heart thudded in his chest and not from pain, not from regret—but from desire. Raw, unexpected desire.<br />
<br />
She didn’t recognize him. Didn’t see the years they’d shared. The child they’d raised. The arguments, the makeups, the quiet evenings in bed. None of that lived in her eyes now.<br />
<br />
She saw a stranger.<br />
<br />
And somehow, that got him so wet he was happy he wore black pants. <br />
<br />
The heat started low in his core. A soft wet pulse between his legs. An ache, a spark, a swell of arousal that surprised even him. He pressed his thighs together and let out a slow, shaky breath. His body was responding on instinct, slick and pulsing with want—without embarrassment, without shame.<br />
<br />
He hadn’t expected this: that seeing her, knowing she didn’t recognize him, would make him feel this… turned on.<br />
<br />
He got back in the car and fumbled for his phone.<br />
<br />
“Hurry.”<br />
<br />
Jeff was still five minutes away. By the time he slid into the passenger seat, David’s cheeks were flushed and his legs were pressed tightly together, breath catching in the back of his throat.<br />
<br />
“You okay?” Jeff asked with a smirk, eyes flicking over his father’s flushed face.<br />
<br />
David stared ahead and then turned slowly toward him. “I saw your mother.”<br />
<br />
Jeff blinked.<br />
<br />
“She didn’t recognize me. And I don’t know what’s wrong with me, but…” David’s voice dropped. “It got me so wet I had to sit still or I was going to soak the seat.”<br />
<br />
Jeff’s grin widened, hunger in his eyes. “Oh, you are a mess.”<br />
<br />
By the time they got home, David was squirming. His shorts clung damply between his legs, and every motion made him shiver. They barely made it inside—Jeff backed him up against the door, lips hot on his neck, hands sliding under the hem of his clothes. David whimpered as Jeff’s fingers found the slick heat between his thighs.<br />
<br />
“You’ve been like this the whole drive?” Jeff whispered.<br />
<br />
David nodded breathlessly.<br />
<br />
“Good,” Jeff growled.<br />
<br />
They didn’t even make it to the bedroom—just the hallway floor, pressed against the cool wall, mouths crashing together, David’s legs wrapped tight around Jeff’s hips. Every kiss, every breath, carried the unspoken truth: that the past was gone, but the future was entirely theirs to define.<br />
<br />
Later, they collapsed together on the rug, sticky and breathless and laughing. David curled into Jeff’s side and kissed his cheek.<br />
<br />
“I didn’t think I’d ever feel this alive again.”<br />
<br />
“You’re not just alive,” Jeff murmured, kissing the top of his head. “You’re you.”<br />
<br />
—<br />
Jeff’s mom had called that morning, cheerful and oblivious.<br />
<br />
“I’d love to meet your boyfriend,” she said brightly. “Properly, I mean.”<br />
<br />
David had heard her voice through the phone. He didn’t speak. He didn’t breathe. He simply looked at Jeff with a raised eyebrow as Jeff blinked in disbelief.<br />
<br />
“…Sure,” Jeff said slowly. “Dinner tonight. Our place.”<br />
<br />
By six o’clock, the table was set.<br />
<br />
David wore a soft off-the-shoulder sweater that clung just enough, paired with high-waisted jeans that hugged his hips and framed the delicate curve of his crotch — subtly, deliberately. Just enough for Jeff to notice. Enough for him to burn.<br />
<br />
Jeff, trying to keep his cool, had spent half the afternoon walking around with half a hard-on, biting his cheek to stay composed.<br />
<br />
Then she arrived.<br />
<br />
Jeff’s mom breezed in with wine and a compliment about the décor. She didn’t bat an eye at David. Just smiled and said, “You must be the boyfriend.”<br />
<br />
David smiled sweetly and extended a hand. “David,” he said. “Nice to meet you.”<br />
<br />
She shook his hand, utterly unaware.<br />
<br />
Dinner was… surreal. She chatted with David about Jeff’s childhood. Told stories. Laughed. Teased. David responded with just the right balance of bashful and flirty. His voice was soft, his posture relaxed, and he never once gave her a clue. If anything, she seemed to think he was shy. New to this. A little bit delicate.<br />
<br />
But Jeff knew better.<br />
<br />
Jeff saw the way David’s top rode up just slightly when he reached for a dish, exposing the pale curve of his waist. The way he sat with his legs ever-so-slightly apart, drawing attention to the visible cleft where something was missing. He wasn’t overt about it — not in front of her — but he knew exactly what he was doing. <br />
<br />
Jeff spent the whole meal hard.<br />
<br />
And David never broke.<br />
<br />
Not until the door closed.<br />
<br />
The moment she was gone, Jeff turned, eyes blazing. “You are evil,” he hissed, already closing the gap between them.<br />
<br />
David grinned. “She didn’t suspect a thing.”<br />
<br />
“You sat across from your ex-wife, with no pants bulge, looking like a walking sex fantasy—”<br />
<br />
“Correction: your boyfriend.”<br />
<br />
Jeff grabbed him by the waist and lifted him onto the table, scattering empty plates. David’s laugh caught halfway in his throat as Jeff pressed between his legs, pulling both their pants off, and kissing him hard enough to bruise.<br />
<br />
“You’ve been teasing me all night,” Jeff growled.<br />
<br />
David wrapped his legs around him. “And you love it.”<br />
<br />
They didn’t make it to the bedroom. They barely made it past grace. David gasping on the table, hands in Jeff’s hair, sweater pushed halfway up his chest — the same table where they’d just played happy family. Now it was shaking under them as Jeff ate him out like he was starving. Later, Jeff and David rutted like animals, both charged by the absurdity of the situation.<br />
<br />
Afterward, breathless and still tangled, David murmured against Jeff’s chest, “You realize she’s going to want to see me again.”<br />
<br />
Jeff kissed his forehead. “Fine. Just don’t sit like that next time.”<br />
<br />
“No promises.”</p>
