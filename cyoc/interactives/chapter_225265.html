<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">One of the less obvious things to watch out for when in a herm-herm relationship is that both partners can get pregnant. While this can sometimes be desired, some couples only want to have one partner pregnant at a time. There could be a few reasons. For thing, they may not be financially ready to have so many children at once, though that&#39;s less of a problem in Animalia. More often, some herms still partially identify themselves at mostly male or female and prefer to keep those roles. Sometimes it&#39;s just down to personal preference.<br />
<br />
For Frankie, shi wanted to become a mother before becoming a father. Mostly it was to show hir ex-wife that shi could be a better mother than she could ever be. And Frankie was lucky to have met such an understanding partner in Reese. And Frankie knew Reese was lucky to have hir too. From what Reese had described hir old self, shi had been given a pretty lousy roll when it came to sexuality. Which was why shi wanted to become a herm Animalian in the first place.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
A good word to describe human Reese was &#39;unremarkable&#39;. Oh, she was pretty intelligent and she wasn&#39;t dull, but didn&#39;t have much else going for her. She wasn&#39;t exactly homely, but she had no figure to speak of and a sexual appetite to match. About 200 years ago, this wouldn&#39;t have mattered so long as she was capable of bearing a child. But in this day and age, passion is a very important part of relationships. Poor Reese couldn&#39;t stoke enough of a passion within herself or others to really produce anything more than friendship. Admittedly, Reese was more interested in love than sex, but she was just a cold metal pole in more ways than one. That was why she decided to become a herm Animalian.<br />
<br />
Reese chose a Belgian Blue in particular because she was tired of being small next to everyone. Of course, she didn&#39;t want to get too big. A beef bull seemed like the right size for her. As soon as Reese drank the milk, she felt a surge through her body like nothing she ever felt before. It was just as well that she had taken her clothes off as she quickly swelled well beyond her former stature, her muscles becoming much thicker and defined. That wasn&#39;t all as her previously nondescript curves were filling in with interest. Soon after the muscles in her chest thickened, her breasts truly blossomed for the first time, quickly dominating a lot of her front.<br />
<br />
Reese&#39;s bovine features started becoming pronounced as the blue-grey fur that is typical for the Belgian Blue sprouted over her body. A nub formed at the base of her spine before growing out into a tail. Her feet clenched before they became hooves, her fingers only getting hoof-like tips. Her previously plain face pushed out into a muzzle as a pair of horns grew from her head. Though the most intense change was the last one. Her clit had been buzzing with growing pleasure before it started growing itself. It grew longer and thicker, the end getting a distinct flattened shape. Pressure soon separated her clit from her vagina as a fleshy sac grew out of her, which soon rounded out as two testicles formed. Reese grasped hir new cock and pumped it as it approached its final size and shape. Awash with real sexual drive for the first time in hir life, it didn&#39;t take long for Reese to bellow and start shooting out hir new seed.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Of course, that was only the beginning for Reese. After hir conversion, shi applied hirself to Animalia&#39;s dating service. Shi got a match almost immediately. Frankie had converted not too recently and the two of them quickly hit it off. It was quite a whirlwind romance, sped up by both of them having both sexes&#39; hormones. Reese was quite eager to be the sire of Frankie&#39;s calf. Some might question what the product of such a union would be, but they weren&#39;t the first milk/beef herm cow couple in Animalia. That would be Andrea and Alita. Frankie and Reese certainly had plenty of opportunities to knock up Frankie, though their latest night of passion turned out to be more fruitful than they planned.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Reese thrust hir dick in a few more times before shi let out a loud moo as shi blasted another load into Frankie. Frankie mooed as well as shi eagerly accepted hir mate&#39;s seed. The two of them panted before Reese pulled hirself out. Before long, Frankie was rubbing hir shaft and asking, &quot;One more round?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know...I&#39;d like to switch things up,&quot; said Reese.<br />
<br />
&quot;How so?&quot; asked Frankie.<br />
<br />
&quot;As much fun as it is to plow you over and over again, I think I want a turn now,&quot; said Reese.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure? We didn&#39;t bring any condoms or birth control pills,&quot; said Frankie.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m just wanting one lay. Considering how many times it&#39;s taking to get you pregnant, what are the odds I&#39;d get knocked up from just one?&quot; asked Reese.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, ok, I guess this is what herm bond-mates do,&quot; said Frankie before kissing hir. Shi subtly rolled Reese over so that Frankie was the one on top. Shi lifted hir mate&#39;s ballsack so shi had an unobscured shot at hir pussy. Shi put hir dick&#39;s head at its opening before pushing in. Both of them groaned over the pressure they felt. &quot;You&#39;re pretty tight,&quot; commented Frankie.<br />
<br />
&quot;I haven&#39;t had sex before I converted,&quot; said Reese.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you&#39;re still a virgin?&quot; asked Frankie.<br />
<br />
Reese winced as shi felt a barrier being broken, &quot;Not anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess we&#39;ve paying more attention to my own vagina than yours,&quot; said Frankie, &quot;I shouldn&#39;t have been so selfish.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s ok. I know how much you want to be a mother,&quot; said Reese.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I should treat my mate like shi treats me,&quot; said Frankie before latching hir mouth onto one of Reese&#39;s nipples. While hir udders weren&#39;t as big and productive as Frankie&#39;s own, there was a steady flow of milk into hir mouth. Reese moaned with approval as Frankie suckled. Soon Frankie started thrusting in, being gentle at first as Reese adjusted to hir presence in hir tunnel. But soon, shi started picking up speed. The way Reese was moaning, shi was really enjoying it. Frankie admitted shi missed doing this. Shi had only had sex with Lori a few times before she learned about hir XYY syndrome and cut hir off.<br />
<br />
After fucking Frankie so many times, Reese was really liking being fucked for once. It was so different from the female perspective. Shi could see why Frankie liked being plowed so much. And Frankie was really good at it, making sure shi was enjoying it before shi really went at it. Reese felt that shi was getting ready to explode. Frankie moved to pull out, but Reese wrapped hir strong legs around hir and pulled hir in. Frankie&#39;s brief struggle only sped things up and soon it was hir turn to erupt. Reese could feel hir seed pump deep into hir.<br />
<br />
The two herm bovines panted before Reese said, &quot;I can see why you&#39;ve become so addicted to being the cow in this relationship.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I came inside you,&quot; said Frankie with concern.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, unlike your ex, I have no problem with containing your seed. You&#39;ll make a great parent, whether you&#39;re the mother or the father,&quot; said Reese. Shi kissed hir mate deeply to show shi meant it. When shi broke off, shi added, &quot;Besides, what are the odds that knocked me up compared to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, can we increase the odds in my favor again?&quot; asked Frankie before pulling out and turning around to present hir ass.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, if you&#39;re that determined to be bred...&quot; said Reese before grasping hir mate&#39;s hips and pulling hir in.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Of course, the sheer irony was that they both ended up impregnated after that night. There wasn&#39;t a whole lot of regret. They both wanted calves, Frankie had just wanted to bear hirs first. But since they succeeded, they were going to be a lot more even in their relationship from now on. Though they&#39;ll need to speed up their wedding plans before their bellies get too round.</p>
