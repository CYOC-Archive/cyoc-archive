<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I have been tasked with sending you out of this place for no less than at least a month. Someone has a very important reason for you not being here in the coming weeks, and I cannot disobey this request. So I want you to go make a few rounds in the capital, and spread out beliefs in anyway you see fit; well, as long as it doesn&#39;t run our name through the mud&quot; explained Mother Attilade.<br />
<br />
You nodded and quickly agreed, but there was one part you were curious about. &quot;Excuse me, but when you say you couldn&#39;t refuse this person&#39;s request, who is it that made this request? I am just curious is all.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I guess it is fine letting you know now that you are old enough. Your mother made the request.&quot;<br />
&quot;My mother? But I don&#39;t have a mother I thought? I was always told that I was found outside on the doorstep.&quot;<br />
&quot;You were, but no one left you there. You appeared there, right before my eyes. Sister Alyssia, your real mother is the Goddess herself. And she has asked for me to send you out of this place. She never said to a where specifically, just that you had to leave the premises and see the world, because she did not want you to waste this life just cooped up in this place for your entire life. She told me that while you are welcome here at any time, you must be made to reside here forever either, because if she didn&#39;t make this request, she feared that you would never leave home. Honestly she sounds exactly like any normally worried mother to me. So I couldn&#39;t refuse this request, as I too have been thinking it is time for you to go out and see the rest of the world.&quot;<br />
<br />
You don&#39;t know what to say. There were too many bombs in what Mother Attilade just told you. Your real mother is the very Goddess whom you have devoted your life to serving? &quot;If I may, why would the Goddess only speak to you, and not to me, if she is my mother and all? I am the only one here who has yet to hear her voice even once afterall.&quot; <br />
<br />
Mother Attilade just smiles at your question. &quot;That question will definitely be answered on your 18th birthday, child. So if you can just wait for 3 more days, I am certain you will have every single one of your questions answered. Now then, go and grab your equipment dear, and say your goodbyes, as you will not be back here for at least a month. I will prepair you a map and a letter of introduction for when you reach the Town of Briar. I have a few of my personal connections there who will definitely help you out.&quot; <br />
<br />
Mother Attilade stands up and dismisses you. You rush to your room and change out of your current outfit and switch it out for the single outfit you have never worn yet, your traveling outfit. It is of a similar design, but your heels are sturdier built and the heel is a bit thicker and much more durable than the typical stilettos you normally wear, as it has a special metal plating reinforcing it. They also are thigh high boots which you spend a good few minutes putting on and lacing up. Your panties are replaced with a sexy black lace thong, and your bra is now of a similar design as well. <br />
<br />
For the main dress, you are wearing a minidress, with the fabric from your waist up is hugging tightly to your every curve, yet allowing you to have a full, unrestricted range of movement.  The bottom of it is loose, like a miniskirt, and several small, thin throwing knives have been stored into special holders on the underside of it. There are about 40 of them in total. The dress is long sleeved, and each sleeve ends in a fairly loose sleeve once it passes your elbow, inside of which is several more throwing knives in the left sleeve, and a hidden blade on your right. The dress itself is reinforced with a very special thread that makes it stab proof. Even the transparent mesh that runs down the front of it, showing off your full cleavage, inner side boob, all of your underboob, and your navel, as it is in the four pointed star pattern, is reinforced. The upper inner corners of the non-mesh fabric just barely cover your nipples. Your usual habit is now the hood of a hooded cape which has your cover&#39;s emblem spread across the back of. <br />
<br />
Next, you put on your belt, which has a bunch of small pockets for various medical aids, a small canister on the back for water, and a few survival tools. And lastly your gloves, thin but durable, and strong enough to catch even a sword swing without breaking or even getting any sign of wearing. <br />
<br />
Everything was sexy, and you starting to feel excited, a bit. But you also felt a bit sad that you would be leaving this place for a while. You go around saying your goodbyes, but were unable to find Sister Maria. You return back to Mother Attilade&#39;s office only to find Sister Maria, dressed in a matching outfit to your own. Mother Attilade is here as well and begins to speak. &quot;Sister Maria will be accompanying you on your travels. She has some knowledge of the area as she only has arrived here a few years ago. You have no idea about how the outside world works, unlike her, so do your best to learn quickly.&quot; She says while handing you a small letter with her wax seal. You place it inside one of your belt pouches. <br />
<br />
&quot;Remember, just because you must be gone for at least 1 month doesn&#39;t mean you have to be back by that time either. If you are enjoying yourself, you can stay out for longer. Just remember to always uphold our teachings and your love and trust in our Goddess.&quot; Says Mother Attilade, while giving both you and Maria a hug and a kiss each. <br />
<br />
You never have been kissed by here before, so you were extremely horny, but didn&#39;t want to show it and ruin the mood. So you just did your best to remember every single detail of it for later. You and Sister Maria are shown out and after saying goodbye, and invoking a blessing enchantment upon yourselves to strengthen your movement speed and stanama, you both begin running in the direction towards of the Town of Briar, the first stop on your journey to the capital.</p>
