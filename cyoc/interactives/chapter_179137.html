<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">To the salt mines, to the coal mines, to the market, the circus, to plow, to carry food, to carry wood... there were many uses for a donkey and the Coachwoman knew it. Her family had discovered the Pleasure Island&#39;s curse many years ago and they used it to their advantage. At first, it was always boys who took the island to be transformed into donkeys, but after several generations they realized that it was more convenient to bring only girls to the island for various reasons:<br />
1. They act more like asses than the boys, therefore its transformation is faster and purer.<br />
2. The people prefer female donkeys because they are more docile and loyal than the male, even live more.<br />
3. The female donkeys sell more because they can breed mules.<br />
4. The females have practically the same strength and dexterity as males.<br />
5. The boom in the business of donkey milk. The donkey milk is expensive and very appreciated.<br />
6. Their skin is softer than that of males.<br />
<br />
It was a good business for the Coachwoman. Letters came from various places asking for &quot;her products.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I had to get rid of several old donkeys that can no longer give birth,&quot; a farmer who was dedicated to raising mules wrote in a letter to the Coachwoman. &quot;I need you to sell me some young female asses, but not young enough as they must be fertile.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Coachwoman knew that she had to send the farmer only the donkeys that had recently been teenage girls, no child.... and Giana was already one of them. As a human, Giana had been taking her first steps into womanhood, she had already left childhood. Although, despite not being able to fit in a wooden crate, Giana was somewhat small. <br />
<br />
Giana and other eleven young jennies were sold by the Coachwoman. And after a heavy ship trip and then a long walk where they trained their new hooves, the former girls came to the farm. <br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to your new home!&quot;, said the farmer Enrico as he led the group of young female donkeys that the Coachwoman had sent him to the stables.<br />
<br />
Giana didn’t protest, and followed Enrico cautiously into the jennies’ enclosure. She walked past the open gate and stood awkwardly in front of eight adult female donkeys, wondering if they were once human children or had always been donkeys.<br />
<br />
It was never known, if they were ever human, there was no trace of it. The adult jennies merely walked up to the new members and gave them a few sniffs and some nudges with their noses, and they were satisfied with their introduction.<br />
<br />
“I’ll be back to check on you later,” the farmer Enrico said as he locked the gate and walked back toward his home.<br />
<br />
After a week, Giana had gradually stopped waking up wondering why she was naked in a field, and she had stopped imagining eating human food as she chomped on her usual breakfast of dry oats.<br />
<br />
On that day, while Giana was flicking a fly away from her ass with her tail, looking around her enclosure in absolute boredom and without fully realizing it, her eyes followed a set of sturdy hooves clomping hard against the grass, leading up to strong legs rippling in the soft morning sunlight, and a firm--<br />
<br />
“What the fuck?”, Giana shook her head as she realized she was ogling a young male horse’s ass, trying to catch a peek at his manhood as he trotted around his enclosure. <br />
<br />
“Eww, no way”, she thought.<br />
<br />
Giana turned and walked back toward the trough to get a gulp of water, trying desperately to clear the images from her head.<br />
<br />
Giana turned back to catch a guilty glimpse. The male horse, that had in proportion her same age, was standing close to the fence, staring right at her. Her eyes drifted across his strong features, feeling excitement building up in her gut as she realized the attraction was mutual.<br />
<br />
“Goddamnit”, Giana shouted internally, looking away abruptly. She was extremely aware of a growing tingling sensation in her crotch, a pressure that made it impossible for her to think of anything but the young stallion.<br />
<br />
Giana breathed heavily, trying to calm herself down. She thought about human boys and how she used to feel about any of the crushes she had back at school, but that only frustrated her, and her mind quickly raced back to thoughts of a warm body pressed firmly against her back, forearms tightly gripping her sides as her mate entered her aching pussy.<br />
<br />
One day later, Giana had gained some control over her libido, although she half-hoped the horse would jump the fence just so she could end her curiosity…. her lusty gawking at the male horse.<br />
<br />
“Well…What’s the harm in looking?” Giana thought. <br />
<br />
She stepped forward, toward the fence, and sniffed at her male companion. <br />
<br />
“Ugh, he even smells amazing.”<br />
<br />
Giana imagined his seed firing deep into her burning pussy, filling her up and dribbling down her inner thigh. She fantasized about his hot breath on the back of her neck, his heaving chest pressed against her, her body quivering beneath him.<br />
<br />
The other young jennies brayed with frustration; they also wanted him just as badly. Her companions acted more like asses than Giana, no one would had believed that they ever were human girls.<br />
<br />
However, Giana’s animalistic urges were strong at that moment, so she gave them a tremendous bray to &quot;mark her territory.&quot;<br />
<br />
“HAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!” The braying of Giana was so loud that it caused the former-girls to get scared and leave the place.<br />
<br />
Then, Giana stood as close to the male horse’s enclosure as she could get. He had definitely taken an interest in her, a fact she wished she could rub in the other jennies’ faces, and he stood within feet of her, pressed against his side of the fence.<br />
<br />
Giana spun around and pressed her ass against the fence. There was no way he’d be able to mount her from there, but he certainly had a full view of her beckoning vagina as she lifted her tail for him.<br />
<br />
“HAAAWWWWWWW-HEEEE!” Giana groaned as a feeling of tender pleasure rushed through her sex. She turned her head and could see the young stallion straining to force his head through the fence as he softly licked her vagina.<br />
<br />
Cautiously, Giana leaned back, making it easier for him to have full access to her pussy. He clumsily lapped at her asinine labia and around her clitoris, sending shivers up her spine.<br />
<br />
“Why does this fucking fence have to be here?” she thought as she pressed her sex against the fence as hard as she could. Her juices dripped down her quivering legs and onto the ground as she yearned to escalate the intimacy between the male horse and her.<br />
<br />
While that was happening, Giana saw two figures round the corner.<br />
<br />
The figures walked slowly toward the fence and eventually approached Giana. They were Enrico and his wife, Simona.<br />
<br />
“Oh, look. This donkey is presenting herself. I thought this would take more time to happen”, Enrico said.<br />
<br />
“And she’s just gorgeous, isn’t she?” Simona smiled as she patted Giana on the neck. “She’ll make such cute little mules.”<br />
<br />
Then, Enrico and Simona decided to put Giana inside the young horse’s enclosure. <br />
<br />
Enrico walked over to the gate and let out a loud whistle. Giana’s eyes narrowed on the gate hinge as it swung open, sending a rush of excitement through her gut. Without much protest, Giana was moved to the other side of the metal fence.<br />
<br />
Giana gleefully stomped into his enclosure and sniffed in his direction as Enrico and Simona left them to their business. When the young stallion approached, she timidly backed away, unable to take her eyes off his growing erection.<br />
<br />
“No way. There’s no way that would even fit inside me.”<br />
<br />
Giana slipped by him and ran over by the open gate to his enclosure, looking back at him as he followed her closely. Her legs quivered as she slowed down, enjoying the sensation of his nose nudging her flesh. <br />
<br />
She shivered as he pressed his nose against her crotch and breathed in deeply, not even noticing that she had raised her tail for him.<br />
<br />
“Oh, never mind! Just a little”, Giana thought.<br />
<br />
A familiar jolt of pleasure filled her sex as her mate licked her most intimate place. Her muscles relaxed as waves of warmth flowed through her. Her breathing quickened and she looked back in a daze as he briefly pulled away.<br />
<br />
With a hop, the young horse was on her back. Giana could feel his bulging penis awkwardly poking around her back end, trying to find its mark, and she gasped as the tip of his cock finally found her wet opening.<br />
<br />
Her eyes fluttered as he slowly worked the head inside her, stretching her burning virgin folds. <br />
<br />
“Just for a minute, then I’ll pull away. Just for a... Oooh!”<br />
<br />
He pushed forward, tearing her hymen as he entered her completely and slowly began to work his penis into a rhythm, pistoning in and out of her, and she couldn’t deny the satisfaction in scratching such a primal itch: the intimacy, the sense of fulfillment and completion, the imperative to procreate. As her vagina tightly gripped the length of his member, she felt connected to him. She could feel his heartbeat, his warmth, his power as he thrust into her as far as he could go.<br />
<br />
“Oh! Fuck! Uh!”, Giana screamed in her mind. The sensation gradually intensified as minutes passed. She knew she should stop. As much as she desperately wanted his seed inside her womb, she couldn’t allow it. Just a little longer.<br />
<br />
His cock slipped out of her and rubbed clumsily against her belly. With a little disappointment, Giana realized this was as good a moment as any. She took several steps forward, and her lover dropped down and began nuzzling her throbbing hole with his lips.<br />
<br />
“Sorry”, she thought. “I want to keep going, but… We gotta… OOHHHHH!”<br />
<br />
Giana gasped as her pussy clenched and her entire body spasmed in waves of electricity. The most intense orgasm she had her experienced had its clutches on her as she thrust her crotch into the stallion’s face with each pulse. Giana felt as though every cell in her body was participating in this singular moment.<br />
<br />
The young horse took the hint and had hopped back on top of his jenny while her brain was still swimming in ecstasy. He slid inside of her effortlessly and resumed his vigorous thrusts. Giana didn’t want him to stop. She needed to envelope him. She had to feel him empty himself inside her and make her his.<br />
<br />
His pace became quick and frantic as they both became lost in the desperate and savage need to climax. His thrusts became shorter and harder until his entire body lurched forward into her.<br />
<br />
She couldn’t deny her absolute satisfaction as the first jet of hot semen shot into her throbbing vagina. The horse grunted and gripped Giana’s sides tightly as bursts of his seed filled her fertile womb until she could no longer carry it all, and she could feel the warm mess as it dribbled down her inner thigh.<br />
<br />
After he pulled out of her and sauntered away to revel in his conquest, Giana slumped forward and tried to catch her breath. She shivered with a sense of fulfillment, but the gravity of what she had just done was beginning to dawn on her.<br />
<br />
“I fucked him.” Her pussy stopped quivering and she shook her head, trying to clear her thoughts. “Oww, I gave my virginity to a horse….But, never mind!”<br />
<br />
Giana tried to convince herself that she didn’t have a choice, that the farmers had forced it on her, or that it was impossible to resist, but she knew full well that she had not only let it happen -- she wanted it to happen. <br />
<br />
&quot;If only my misfortune might serve as a lesson to disobedient children who refuse to study! But never mind! Never mind! Hee Haw! Hee Haw! Hee Haw!&quot; Giana threw her head back and brayed. She knew this was her life now.<br />
<br />
Giana was moved to another part of the facility the following morning, and the days began to blur together as she found herself in a routine. Wake up, eat, socialize with the other jennies, get a little exercise, eat, get taken back to the stable for bed. <br />
<br />
As weeks turned into months, Giana came to know with certainty that the horse’s attention had taken the intended effect: She was pregnant.<br />
<br />
The farmers Enrico and Simona were careful with her diet and her belly started to grow as she could feel her first child begin to wiggle within her. Giana didn’t know why she cared, but she wanted to know what the sex of her baby was going to be, though she was sure she wouldn’t be allowed to stay with it for long.<br />
<br />
Her teats swelled with milk, and she imagined nursing her offspring, which filled her with feelings of both warmth and disgust.<br />
<br />
Several days later, Giana knew it was time. Her belly spasmed in pain as her “son” signalled he was ready to come out. She paced around her enclosure for an hour as Simona assembled. Eventually, she could no longer ignore her instincts and laid down, breathing heavily as nature took control.<br />
<br />
“HEEEEE HAAAAAAWW! HEEEEE HAAAAAAWW!”, she brayed as she felt her child pass into her birth canal and slowly poke its hooves out of her swollen vagina.<br />
<br />
Giana pushed. Pain rippled through her as her opening stretched to reveal a small head. She rolled her eyes back and pushed again as Simona started to assist her.<br />
<br />
“Ohh, this isn’t happening.” Giana grunted as she pushed her child further into the world, and he began to slide the rest of the way out with Simona’s help. Exhausted, she looked behind her. In a pool of goo laid a gasping infant mule. Her eyes followed his umbilical cord to her own crotch.<br />
<br />
Her mind raced with the finality of the situation; she had given birth. She was now a mother, and this was her first of many children, if her owners had their way.<br />
<br />
Enrico and Simona looked at her expectantly, muttering to themselves about why she was just staring at her foal and not cleaning it. “No way”, she thought. “Fuck you.” They eventually gave up and just took care of it themselves, washing the birthing fluids off of the baby mule and helping him to his feet when he seemed ready.<br />
<br />
With a little difficulty, Giana stood, looking down at her offspring as he stared up at her with tired eyes. “You’re a cute little thing, I’ll give you that. I wonder if you have any idea you’re really part human.”<br />
<br />
He nuzzled up to her and started to nurse, relieving some of the pressure in her teats as he enjoyed his first meal.<br />
<br />
Although Giana couldn’t deny she felt a certain amount of pride watching her first child slowly mature over the coming weeks.<br />
<br />
Late in the morning, a male donkey was introduced to the pen that had been cleaned the previous afternoon.<br />
<br />
After her son was taken for his bathing, Giana turned her attention to her new neighbor. He had strong features and appeared to be very lovingly groomed for a jackass. It seemed that the owners now wanted donkey foals.<br />
<br />
Her legs felt weak at the thought of the gate between her pen and the jackass swinging open as he rushed forward to claim her.<br />
<br />
Giana didn’t try to avoid the jack. When he approached her and gave her rear a sniff, she instinctively moved her tail aside and adjusted her stance to accommodate his weight as he mounted her.<br />
<br />
With each labored thrust, Giana felt the inevitability of her fate taking shape. Her purpose was to be bred, and to provide high-quality offspring for her master.<br />
<br />
The male donkey’s pace quickened. Enjoying the intimacy of the moment, Giana pressed back against him as his body tensed and began spurting his seed into her.</p>
