<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“So what do we do now?” inquired Oscar as he looked at Lindsay, he looked her straight in those green eyes he loved, her fur had taken on a red tint which wasn’t natural for a cheetah but seamed like an off shoot of her own red hair. He loved that hair when he was human and now she had even more of it, he loved it more. That frame was wonderful on her, her tits where small true, but he was always more of an ass man and she had a prefect one, it looked even better now that it had a tail. It wasn’t just animal lust, he loved her laugh and her joking nature when they had brief moments together in class. He remembered how he had planned to run into James just to come visit her since he knew James was dating her roommate. He was glad he did, he didn’t want anyone else to claim this beautiful cat goddess before him but he wasn’t going to force himself on her, even though her nipples where brushing against his chest and his manhood was at almost painful levels of attention.<br />
<br />
Lindsay was breathing slowly and deeply as she looked up into Oscar’s new face, his feline features would have freaked her out only an hour or so ago but now they where the most beautiful thing she had seen. His spots made him look handsome and he smelled so good to her new cheetah like body. She could tell he was a young strong and fit male, if they had cubs, they would be well off combining her traits with his. Still there was more then just animalist nature here, she had a crush on him before they became these creatures…cat people? Feline People? Who knows and who cares? His eyes, those green eyes a darker shade then her own seamed so deep to her and them where deeper now, he was so funny in class and so kind whenever they where together but she was just too shy to ask him. It meant so much that he had come to her and judging by the smell he hadn’t visited anyone else, he wanted her and she wanted him. That made the choose so easy for her.<br />
<br />
She made the first move, using her arms which where still around his neck to pull his face toward her while at the same time sliding her legs under him. She didn’t force him and he could have pulled out at any time but he knew what was going on. He helped her down onto the coach. He didn’t kiss her and she didn’t kiss him but she was now on her back while he used his hands to keep himself up. Both their tails where flicking happily behind/to the side as they looked at each other.<br />
<br />
“Are you…” started Oscar wanting to make sure this was ok. A nod from her and her pulling him into a kiss was all the answer he needed. He returned the kiss quickly as one hand supported his weight while the other began to travel down her body. He didn’t kiss her for long, since he started to plant kisses on her neck. She responded with a deep purr which sounded better then a moan to him as she moved her head to offer her neck to him. <br />
<br />
Something deep within him told him that move of the neck was important, a sign of deep trust for in the wild an open neck was an invite to death, and he had teeth which could kill her. She trust him fully and he paid that back. He bite down softly on her neck just enough to draw blood, something told him to do this and he knew he was claiming her for him. Lindsay moaned/purred at the bite and noticed Oscar was showing his neck, she bit down as well, their bites leaving scents which claimed the other as theirs. He returned to kissing her both of them having small amounts of blood at their neckline, then it was time. <br />
<br />
He entered her and she let out a wince of pain and some tears, but the tears where soon replaced by moans and purrs as he filled her and she tightened around him. Her feet wrapped themselves around him as he drove deeper and deeper in. After moments they would never forget and pleasure, they had never experienced they both roared each other names as they reached their peak as his hot seed entered her. <br />
<br />
For a moment they basked in that afterglow then Lindsay pulled away and for a moment Oscar was hurt then she spun around and stuck her ass in the air her tail raised and her scent driving him crazy. <br />
<br />
“Round two.” She announced as Oscar took her from behind, it was wilder this time both of them no longer afraid and wanting to try out things. At one point Lindsay sat up on her knees while he was within her and all but turned to face him, her flexibility was amazing and they kissed, while he played with her breasts all the while driving inside her. For round 3 she was on top riding him like a cow girl, or a cat girl to be correct while he held on to her hips and she drove herself into him He loved looking up at her and seeing the pleasure on her face. <br />
<br />
After three rounds they stopped and rested for a moment, Lindsay resting on his chest while they lied on the coach. Both breathing heavily.<br />
<br />
“I love you.” Said Oscar as he purred deeply<br />
<br />
“I love you.” Lindsay purred back, then suddenly she turned and looked away. He was confused until her heard it to. Someone was coming…lost in their mating pleasure they hadn’t heard it but someone was coming.</p>
