<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You guys wanna go to the park?&quot; Drake asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Park?!&quot; Alan&#39;s ears perked up as he heard the word. His tail wagged even faster. &quot;Alan wants to go to the park! Alan wants to go to the park!&quot; he chanted over and over as he gripped Drake&#39;s arm. The 6&#39;4&quot; 250 pound bodybuilder sized wolf man kissed the side of Drake&#39;s body over and over to try to convince his master to let him go.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think that&#39;s a yes,&quot; Zack smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d say so,&quot; Drake did the same. He grabbed the leash and a lot of the excitement in Alan&#39;s body disappeared. &quot;Alan. It&#39;s only for a little while. Okay? There are still leash laws after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay...&quot; Alan&#39;s ears lowered as Drake attached the leash around Alan&#39;s red collar.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good boy,&quot; Drake petted Alan&#39;s muscular arm. Any hint of his solemn demeanor went out the window as a huge grin appeared on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;YES! Alan is a good boy!&quot; Alan bragged to Zack.<br />
<br />
Zack nodded and smiled. It was almost sarcastic in a while. &quot;Yep. Alan&#39;s a good boy.&quot; <br />
<br />
Alan didn&#39;t seem to care as the three walked off campus to the park. His tail was already wagging again as he stayed a couple of paces ahead of Zack and Drake. However, at no point did the leash ever grow taut. He made sure to leave enough slack and not pull Drake over. As they made it to the park, Drake let go of the leash and pulled a football out of his bag.<br />
<br />
Drake held it up to Zack. &quot;Would you mind? I&#39;m not exactly great at throwing this. He still loves it, but I wonder if you could make friends a bit easier if you tossed it to him.&quot;<br />
<br />
A deep chuckle resonated out of Zack. &quot;Sure thing bud,&quot; he took the football from Drake. Alan had made his way not too far out into the field, knowing full well that Drake couldn&#39;t throw it that far. Zack pulled his arm back and the ball went sailing across the open field. Well over four times further than Drake&#39;s best throw. Alan went sprinting after the ball.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks...&quot; Drake stared in a bit of disbelief. He expected the ball to go far, but not the length of a football field.<br />
<br />
&quot;You want me to throw it further?&quot; Zack smirked. <br />
<br />
Alan was still running after the ball. &quot;Probably not... I don&#39;t know if we would have enough room. I don&#39;t want to get in anyone else&#39;s way.&quot; He took a few steps back towards a bench along the sidewalk. He sat down and waited for Alan to come back.<br />
<br />
&quot;So...&quot; Zack sat next to him. &quot;You only got two wishes off before Alan took this from you?&quot; He held up the lamp.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? Oh. Yeah. I guess so,&quot; Drake felt like he should have cared more about the lamp, yet he knew he could trust Zack completely. &quot;You&#39;ve been talking to Beldazarr?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have... So the only things you wanted was not to be named Bob and make Alan more muscular?&quot; Zack probed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well he was such a weak looking beagle. I just wanted to what he&#39;d be like if he was stronger,&quot; Drake&#39;s face blushed a little as he thought about just how much had changed when he&#39;d changed Alan. &quot;I just didn&#39;t realize how much would change.&quot; Alan had returned with the ball and made sure to place it in Drake&#39;s lap. Drake handed it to Zack. The moment it touched Zack&#39;s hand, Alan was already sprinting off. His muscular arms pumped hard as his legs ran as fast as they could. Alan&#39;s tight ass looked as though it was going to fall out of the underwear he was required to wear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahhh... That makes sense,&quot; Zack nodded. &quot;But it sounds like Alan changed a lot aren&#39;t you worried about that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm? I guess a little,&quot; Drake said. Alan had returned the football too him, which he handed to Zack again. The ball went soaring across the open field again. &quot;But I don&#39;t know what&#39;s different. I don&#39;t even know what to be upset about. Are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Zack really took a moment to think about it. Drake didn&#39;t know how much Beldazarr had told him or just how many wishes Alan had made. &quot;I guess not. But if I said...&quot; his voice cut out.<br />
<br />
For a second, Drake felt something very peculiar about his body. It was like a shock hit his whole body at once. His blond hair had turned a bright red. The tips of his ears grew to points and then shifted towards the top of his head. He shook it as more bright red fur started sprouting out of his skin. It covered his face. All the way up to his little black nose that was pushing further out than it had been before. A short muzzle quickly formed and sharp fox teeth filled his mouth.<br />
<br />
The red fur continued down his body. Small accents of white filled out some of the tips and gave his small lean frame a bit of something to stand out. But it was the brown fur along his hands and feet that really made the difference. His paws always looked muddy, despite him never rolling around in it. Claws erupted out of his fingers and toes and little paw pads formed at the end of each one. He didn&#39;t notice as his 5&#39;8&quot; body began shrinking in on itself. The normal sized human was dwindling down into a 4&#39;1&quot; fox. <br />
<br />
Zack&#39;s face burned bright red. &quot;W-what?&quot; Drake asked. His feet no longer reached the ground as they sat on the bench.<br />
<br />
&quot;So cute...&quot; Zack swooned. He uttered it without even thinking.<br />
<br />
The small anthropomorphic fox nuzzled his head against Zack&#39;s strong arm. &quot;You&#39;re so sweet...&quot; Drake cooed as he stroked Zack&#39;s beefy belly. His hand dipped a bit lower and gently cupped where Zack&#39;s dick was. Even though the massive man was hard it was near impossible to tell with the miniscule unit he was working with. &quot;I&#39;ll make sure to reward you later...&quot;<br />
<br />
Zack nearly finished right there as dozens of thoughts rushed through his head of the big dicked little fox man ran through his mind. &quot;You mean you&#39;re not mad?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mad?&quot; Drake asked. Alan had returned with the ball, dropping it in front of Drake, who promptly handed it back to Zack, who threw it across the field again.<br />
<br />
&quot;EERRR! About Alan making some wishes and then not knowing what changed,&quot; Zack said. &quot;Beldazarr says he&#39;s the only reason we&#39;re dating.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Drake smiled. &quot;Is that really a bad thing though?&quot; He stood up onto the bench and leaned against Zack&#39;s boy. His small hands dipped into the part lion&#39;s shirt and gently stroked the tuft of hair covering Zack&#39;s bulky chest. &quot;Hmm?&quot; he taunted, nuzzling his nose against the nape of Zack&#39;s neck. &quot;Is that so bad?&quot;<br />
<br />
Zack was having trouble breathing, let alone thinking. His mind had gone abuzz as his tiny dick throbbed in his shorts. &quot;N-n-n-no...&quot; he stammered out as his strong body felt like mush under the fox&#39;s soft touch. <br />
<br />
Drake kissed his boyfriend. &quot;Good,&quot; he stopped his little onslaught.<br />
<br />
&quot;But...&quot; Zack was slowly getting his wits back as Drake plopped back down onto the bench. &quot;You could have wished to be human?&quot; It came out as almost a question.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm?&quot; Drake looked at Zack a bit suspiciously. The lion man&#39;s face turned bright red, but he didn&#39;t comment on it. &quot;I guess I didn&#39;t think about it,&quot; he shrugged. Alan brought the ball back to Drake and dropped it. Drake pet him on the head, then snapped the leash back around his neck. &quot;Alright. I think we&#39;d better get going. I need to go and meet up with Ethan.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I go?&quot; Zack asked.<br />
<br />
For a second Drake thought he&#39;d said that it probably wasn&#39;t a good idea, but that didn&#39;t make sense because he happily said. &quot;Of course!&quot;</p>
