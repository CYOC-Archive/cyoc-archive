<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff was silent while Dean&#39;s playlist blared from his speakers. After registering his new Skoda Superb Sport, Dean had synched his phone  via bluetooth to Jeff&#39;s audio system, and was playing his tunes as he drove. Jeff just listened, and struggled to remember things. Something had happened at the Department of Motor Vehicles. Jeff knew for a fact that his home was 130 Oak Street, Atlanta GA 30345. But that was Dean&#39;s one story house. It was on a big lot, it had plenty of parking, but it had no garage. No, that was Dean&#39;s home. Jeff lived with his parents in a yellow two.story house. It wasn&#39;t on Oak either. Jeff knew he lived a few blocks from Dean, on a different street.  It was an odd street name. Latina? No, Latonia! My parents have a house on Latonia, but he couldn&#39;t remember the street number. He told himself that he had known the address as well his own name because he had lived there since he was a toddler.  It was then that he realized he no longer knew his own name.  Had Dean done this to him? Maybe the chronivac malfunctioned? Or maybe when he became Dean&#39;s car it affected his memory? Jeff didn&#39;t know his own name or address, and he was afraid to let Dean know that his memory was failing.  So Jeff was silently listening to Dean&#39;s annoying Euro-techno-dance  music. He preferred Country Western music, and had already preset his radio buttons to all the local country stations.  If only Dean&#39;s phone battery would rundown or Dean would switch to radio mode.<br />
<br />
Dean seemed to know where he was driving. He drove across Latonia, Jeff longer to drive by his parent&#39;s yellow two story, but Dean turned the other direction, then he turned a couple more times, drove across Oak St, and out toward the highway.  The NAV system map that was integrated into Jeff&#39;s mind. As Dean pulled off the highway into a commercial auto mechanic&#39;s shop, the GPS id&#39;d the place as The Chop Shop. Wait! A chop.shop is where they cut up cars for new parts of customize cars. Jeff had customized Dean&#39;s car, himself to Dean&#39;s specs exactly. Why was he at a place called the Chop Shop.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Yo, Dean, sweet set of wheels,&quot; said a guy in grease stained coveralls. &quot;So what is she a Renault or something European, I&#39;d guess?&quot;<br />
<br />
 &quot; Hi, Ray. Yeah, it&#39;s a Skoda Superb from The Czech Republic. &quot;<br />
<br />
 &quot;Oh, yeah, I heard of those. Thought they might start selling them in the US when Melania was first lady, but it didn&#39;t happen. Fact, I read just last week that Sold a had delayed plans to sell its cars here in the US because its parent company Volkswagen wanted Skoda to focus on the East Indian market. So, how did you manage to score one?  Is it even legal to.drive here? It looks like it should be, but since they don&#39;t make cars for the US yet, I don&#39;t see how it could be?&quot;<br />
<br />
 &quot; Got it from Canada, so it&#39;s American nearly, &quot; Dean lied.  &quot;In fact, I was told it was a prototype for the US market of their British Superb. May have even been made custom here in Atlanta.&quot;<br />
<br />
 I was born in Atlanta, wasn&#39;t I? Manufactured in Czech Republic but born.in Atlanta?  Jeff&#39;s data and memories seemed to be in conflict.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Really?&quot; Ray asked.<br />
<br />
 &quot; Well, honestly, I just know what the guy who sold it to me told me. I brought it in for you to make sure it meets US emissions standards, and run a diagnostics on the systems. &quot;<br />
<br />
 &quot;Hm, sure, but we&#39;ll need it for a few days. I don&#39;t have any diagnostic software designed for a Skoda car. Will have to track some down. Do you want any detailing or maybe a NOX added? How about lowrider pneumatic jacks and shocks?&quot;<br />
<br />
 &quot; Oh. If you don&#39;t have the software, I can come back after you get it, &quot; Dean said.<br />
<br />
 &quot;No! You have to leave it. I will hook it to my master diagnostic computer making your car computer a slave, then it will connect to the internet to find the software needed to reprogram and test it. That can take an hour or two, as the system tries out different programs until it gets the right one. Then.It downloads it,&quot; Ray licked. his lips. He couldn&#39;t wait to strip the chassis down to see how Jeff was.designed. He knew a.couple collectors who might pay big bucks for a U.S. legal Skoda car. He could implant a tracker in Dean &#39;s car so that he could find it when a collector wanted Ray to boost it. Dean was a nice kid. He&#39;s make sure Dean was.well insured before he stole the car to order.<br />
<br />
Dean wasn&#39;t sure he wanted to leave Jeff here.<br />
<br />
Jeff was unable to complain, the playlist kept playing. Wait it wasn&#39;t just playing through him, it was downloading into him. What the heck? How did Dean get a.copy of my Chronivac on his phone? Jeff wondered as it started to download.<br />
<br />
Day reached in through the driver&#39;s door, and released the hood. Then he walked over to the red four foot tall portable diagnostic computer, and picked up a long thick black cable with a bunch of odd shaped computer interfaces. He brought it over to Dean&#39;s car and reached under the hood. Jeff felt like his skull was ripped open, as a plastic panel was uncovered, and Ray tried fitting the pins on the interfaces into the black holes in Jeff&#39;s interface. Jeff couldn&#39;t interact with the speakers while in download mode.He could only watch in terror, as he lost all control as Ray connected the right interface to him. Jeff was a slave computer now.<br />
<br />
 &quot;I knew one of the VW interfaces would connect, if we&#39;re really lucky the VW software will work too, but since Skoda is a subsidiary, it probably has its own software. Hey, would you like lightning bolts painted on the sides. Silver metallic or neon yellow would really look good on this blue paint job,&quot; Ray said.</p>
