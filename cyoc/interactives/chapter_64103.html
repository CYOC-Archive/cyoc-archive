<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The end of the school year came quietly for the Columbia Falls School system, and of course every school had its graduation ceremony. And as Officer Barnes and I were serving as replacement DARE officers, since the officer who normally did that work was killed, we were expected to provide security for each school's graduation. It was why we had stopped by the elementary school to talk with Mrs. Fitzpatrick on how the ceremony would go. <br />
<br />
Both Officer Barnes and I figured a lighter touch would be best for the elementary school. We planned to take seats in the last row of chairs that were set up for the ceremony. That way people would know the gym was safe and secure, or at least that was our plan.<br />
<br />
&quot;You really don't like the heat, do you?&quot; Officer Barnes commented as drank from a water bottle I had taken to carrying with me as the warm summer months approached.<br />
<br />
Releasing the straw I was drinking the water through, I only sighed, &quot;I don't mind it... but I can definitely FEEL the heat as I am. Molly and Megan are probably in the same boat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Megan's too full of energy to be bothered by it,&quot; Officer Barnes commented, &quot;at least for now...&quot;<br />
<br />
I nodded and then glanced out at the gym. The platform for the faculty and staff members were in place and a series of chairs were arranged in neat rows in front of them. They all looked rather sturdy, for mostly plastic chairs, though I wondered if I would have to stand because of my muscle mass. A couple of parents had already arrived and had taken seats.<br />
<br />
&quot;Won't Danielle be here?&quot; I asked after a moment, &quot;it is her daughter's graduation?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's Kindergarten to First Grade,&quot; Officer Barnes shrugged, &quot;and besides, she's still busy with the station.&quot;<br />
<br />
Officer Barnes then held up a small camera that he had clipped to his belt. It didn't resemble anything the station used for photographic evidence taking.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm here for her and for our assignment... and am to take good pictures of Megan,&quot; Officer Barnes smirked as more parents came in and moved to where they could sit down. They largely ignored us.<br />
<br />
As more and more came in, various members of the staff and School Board then arrived. Wayne Hireman glared at me as he walked toward the platform. I ignored him as I heard footsteps approaching from a different hallway. I turned to see Mrs. Fitzpatrick approaching.<br />
<br />
&quot;Things are looking good, and we should be able to start on schedule,&quot; Mrs. Fitzpatrick told us, &quot;the teachers should begin bringing the students in soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You shouldn't have any problems, ma'am,&quot; Officer Barnes told her politely.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good to hear, good to hear,&quot; Mrs. Fitzpatrick replied.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
And the students did arrive shortly after. The first class was actually Megan's. She approached Officer Barnes and I as her class walked by.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, daddy,&quot; she said to Officer Barnes.<br />
<br />
&quot;He there, little one,&quot; Officer Barnes replied with a smile, &quot;been good?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Always, daddy,&quot; Megan answered and nuzzled Officer Barnes' hand before retaking her place in line.<br />
<br />
&quot;I envy you,&quot; I said to Officer Barnes.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Megan,&quot; I answered, &quot;you've been friends with Officer Jenkins for so long... she sees you as her father.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Despite the species difference,&quot; Officer Barnes replied, his eyes following the white dots on the back of Megan's furry ears as she went to where she was to sit. His remark was more of a statement then a question.<br />
<br />
I nodded, &quot;and Molly and I...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The two of you want kids?&quot; Officer Barnes asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; I nodded, &quot;though we'll have to wait until winter, between Christmas and New Years, when Molly comes into heat again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And how long will that last?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;About a week,&quot; I answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;It'll be here before you know it,&quot; Officer Barnes replied, &quot;and I'm sure the two of you will make great parents.&quot;<br />
<br />
He was trying to be encouraging, but I did get the sense that Officer Barnes was still learning the ropes when it came to parenthood. I did not have much of a chance to reply as a familiar voice cut in...<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Officer Barnes,&quot; came Molly's voice from behind me, &quot;we're both hopeful that we will be good parents ourselves.&quot;<br />
<br />
I turned to see Molly bringing her class in. Timothy and Patrick were the first in line. Both of them looked much better and had recovered from their wounds. Vanessa was also close to the front of the line.<br />
<br />
&quot;You want to have parents?&quot; Vanessa asked as the class stayed in line, but did stop.<br />
<br />
&quot;George and I want to become parents,&quot; Molly said slowly, &quot;to have our own cubs...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're going to have babies?&quot; Timothy gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not at present,&quot; Molly answered, &quot;George and I have to wait...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; Patrick wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Biology,&quot; I quipped.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's that mean?&quot; Vanessa wondered as the other students looked on, wonder and curiosity all over their faces.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rules we can't break,&quot; Molly answered, trying to simplify it so that they could understand, &quot;let us leave it at that.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a small chorus of &quot;awws&quot;. Molly then moved to try and get her class moving again so that they weren't blocking the entryway. I gave her a small hug and nuzzled her before the did get going. That raised a chorus &quot;ewww&quot; rising up from the same students as they did appearantly recognize how Molly and I showed our affection for each other... or as kids call it, &quot;mushy stuff&quot;. It was probably why Molly didn't give a detailed explanation on what biology was. To a kid who was too young to have any romantic interest, explaining that Molly and I would both be needed to &quot;make&quot; baby tigers... cubs... wouldn't exactly work well.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The graduation ceremony went quickly and it went well. And when the school day ended, Officer Barnes and I were released from duty for the day. And in doing this, I found myself meeting Molly on the sidewalk on my way home.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everything looked good, Molly,&quot; I told her as we walked along, &quot;I'm so happy you could succeed here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The kids all seemed depressed that they are moving on and I won't be teaching their class next year,&quot; Molly said with a chuckle, &quot;but thank you, George. It is what I wanted to do... hopefully I did a good job.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How could you do a bad job?&quot; I quipped and then nuzzled Molly's head. Molly returned the nuzzle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, George,&quot; Molly gave a soft smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;And your class from last year will always have recess,&quot; I continued, which made her laugh a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what's your schedule coming up?&quot; Molly wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Officer Barnes and I will still have DARE work until the High School and Middle School end,&quot; I answered, &quot;the high school seniors had their ceremony last Sunday, with no problems. All that's really left is the Middle School's graduation ceremony, which will probably be a bit more formal then what the Elementary School did today.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When is that?&quot; Molly asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Wednesday,&quot; I replied, &quot;then Officer Barnes and I will return to patrol duty.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Summer's nearly here,&quot; Molly nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; I answered, &quot;do you have any ideas for it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...&quot; Molly said slowly, &quot;I've been assigned to work with the Summer Sun program, and Leona's... now Leon's wedding took a lot of your vacation time... I don't think there is much that we can do. Seeing places like Yellowstone, Mount Rushmore, and Glacier would be nice... but we may not have the time for that this year...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Especially since we'd need to get your Uncle to drive us,&quot; I sighed in agreement, &quot;Maybe next summer then. Let you take your mind off the heat getting to you while you're pregnant...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe,&quot; Molly said with a sigh and laid her head on my shoulder. I guessed she was daydreaming about our future as parents.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you talk with Patten at all?&quot; Molly asked after a few moments.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, he seemed to want to keep as much distance between us as possible,&quot; I sighed, &quot;I doubt he's going to like me anytime soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Tuesday and Wednesday came and went quietly. The Summer Sun Program didn't actually start until after all of the students were out for the summer, so she had a couple of days off. Our last day of DARE work went quietly as there were no problems at the Middle School ceremony, either. And with that done, Officer Barnes and I made our way into the station on Thursday morning. By now, much of the outer portions of the station's walls had been rebuilt, but a lot of roofing work was still ongoing and there was still some wiring work that had to be done inside. It would still be a couple of weeks before the station was fully repaired.<br />
<br />
But that wasn't on my mind as Officer Barnes and I went in through the back door. With the school year over, we would return to full time patrol duty. I tended to get the impression that Officer Barnes preferred this to the DARE work. To a certain extent, I did too, but I tried my best to make sure not look it. I wasn't going to give anyone in the station who either had something against me personally, or felt my &quot;style&quot; was too aggressive, as Patten had put it.<br />
<br />
We clocked in and then checked with Officer Howard before heading out.<br />
<br />
&quot;We're heading out, sir,&quot; Officer Barnes reported in.<br />
<br />
&quot;How'd the school year finish out?&quot; Officer Howard asked from his desk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, sir,&quot; Officer Barnes replied, &quot;no problems from anyone.&quot;<br />
<br />
Officer Howard slowly nodded, &quot;How'd your wife, make out, George? The school think she did a good enough job on her own?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think so,&quot; I nodded, &quot;she's been picked to work with the Summer Sun program... which starts in a few days. So I guess they're pleased with her work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good to hear,&quot; Officer Howard nodded, &quot;the two of you are free to resume your normal patrol schedules... until the school year starts again in the fall.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;DARE again...?&quot; Officer Barnes groaned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Afraid so,&quot; Officer Howard reminded us, &quot;remember the city won't set its budget for the year until January. It's then that I'll be able to send out application notices for a DARE and dispatch officer... provided they don't slash Police budgets state-wide...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll do our best, sir,&quot; Officer Barnes sighed with some heavy resignation in his voice.<br />
<br />
Officer Howard nodded, &quot;I know. Anyway, things have been quiet here on the patrol end of things. You may not come across much.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Best thing to hear,&quot; I commented.</p>
