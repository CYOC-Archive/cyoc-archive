<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ed woke up to the sun shining in on his pillow.  He opened an eye, groaned, and held up a hand to block the light.  He realized he must have fallen asleep and slept through the night.  As he continued waking up, he became aware of signals his body was sending him.  He could hear birds chirping outside his bedroom window, his mouth was dry and he could use some water, but it was the feeling that he had to pee which finally got him to sit up.  As he did, his hair fell into his face and he was reminded of the changes from the previous day.<br />
<br />
He reached up and touched his hair and tried to tuck it behind his ear, but there was no ear...at least not where he was used to it being.  He felt the side of his head and it was flat and covered in hair.  Reaching up to the top of his head, he found his pointed feline ears once again.  They twitched at his touch.  Next, he felt his face where there was a small nose above a puffy lip which had sprouted stiff whiskers.  Sticking a finger into his mouth, he raised half of his top lip and felt a sharp fang.  He stuck his tongue out and looked down and could see a flat little tongue poking out.  It was so weird that he couldn&#39;t help but smile.<br />
<br />
He hopped off his bed, walked to the bathroom, and started warming up the shower.  Taking his T-shirt off, he realized he probably didn&#39;t have any other clothes that would currently fit him.  The Chronivac conveniently had transformed his previous clothes into these, but the rest of his wardrobe was still sized to an adult male.  He&#39;d have to wear these clothes again until he could get more, but that would mean he&#39;d either have to wait until some could be ordered and shipped to his house or he&#39;d actually have to go outside in his current state.  He didn&#39;t want to wait days without going outside, so wearing the same clothes and covering up his feline parts would likely be his best option.<br />
<br />
Ed removed his skirt and panties and sat on the toilet.  He had to make sure his tail was sticking off to the side and brought it around and held it in his lap with his left arm.  When he would sit on the toilet, he would usually use his right hand to point his penis into the toilet bowl, but without that anatomy, he was unsure of what to do with his right hand.  He placed it on his right knee and waited for the pee to come out.  He had never really had to think about what muscles to relax to make the pee come out, it would just happen naturally.  Except now, those were different muscles.  He tried to relax in general and figured that might work.  A moment later, a stream started flowing into the toilet.  He looked down, fascinated by the new sensation, but also relieved.  Using his right hand, he unrolled some toilet paper, folded it, and wiped himself.  He was used to giving his penis a quick shake to get any drops off before standing up, so it felt like he skipped a step when he stood up and flushed without being able to do that.<br />
<br />
He stepped into the shower, stood under the shower-head, closed his eyes, and let the warm water run down his naked body.  He slowly turned and let the water rinse off his body.  He stuck his head into the stream to get his hair wet, but quickly pulled back when water went into his ears and leaned over to shake it out.  &quot;Okay, I&#39;ll need to be more careful about that,&quot; he thought.<br />
<br />
Reaching down, he grabbed his shampoo and squeezed some out in his hand and then rubbed it into his hair.  He scrubbed with his fingers to get the roots and continued downward to where his ears used to be but was now featureless with only hair.  Even though his hair would be considered short for a woman, the bob cut was a lot longer than he was used to.  After he finished sudsing up his hair, he noticed his dripping wet tail and wondered if he should shampoo the fur there too.  &quot;Might as well,&quot; he decided as he lathered up his tail in his hands.<br />
<br />
He rinsed the shampoo out of his hair and tail then reached for a bar of soap.  Scrubbing his arms, he worked up a thick lather.  He lifted a leg and felt the soap glide across his smooth, hairless legs.  Ed hadn&#39;t had bare legs since before he hit puberty a long time ago, so he had forgotten how smooth it felt.  He wondered if he&#39;d need to shave them in a few days or if the Chronivac had made it so he wouldn&#39;t even grow hair on his legs.  Next, he scrubbed his stomach before moving up to his breasts.  He enjoyed the feeling of the water on his body while he moved his hands over his new chest.  The smooth skin, the round curves, the new sensations -- it was such a wonderful new experience for him.<br />
<br />
After rinsing off his arms, chest, and legs, he lathered up his hands and put the soap back in the soap dish and began to lather up his crotch.  He ran his fingers through his pubic hair and down over his vagina.  Turning around, he rubbed soap across his increased rear end and had forgotten about his tail until he accidentally bumped its base.  He rinsed the soap off and gently rubbed his butt and became a little more familiar with its new dimensions.<br />
<br />
Finally, he lathered up his hands one last time and rubbed soap across his face.  His skin felt smoother than he was used to with no trace of stubble, but his stiff whiskers stood out.  Moving his hands to the sides of his face, he normally would have encountered his ears, but instead he found smooth skin leading to a lower hairline where his ears used to be.  After scrubbing the back of his neck under his hair, he rinsed off all the soap and turned off the water.<br />
<br />
He grabbed a towel and dried his face off and then toweled his hair dry as best he could.  He was used to being able to adequately towel dry his shorter hair, but it seemed like this wasn&#39;t going to cut it anymore.  He&#39;d have to figure out a better solution after drying off.  Running the towel down his arms, body, and legs, he then pulled his tail around front and attempted to dry the fur on his tail as best he could.  At least it wasn&#39;t dripping wet anymore.<br />
<br />
Ed looked up across from the shower and saw the bathroom mirror above the sink, but it was steamed up.  He ran his towel across the surface to wipe off the moisture and got his first real look at his naked body.  If he still had a penis, it would be getting aroused by his own reflection.  &quot;Wow,&quot; he whispered to himself.  He leaned closer and looked at himself in the mirror.  He checked out the side of his head where his ears used to be and looked up at his new ears.  He lifted his upper lip and looked at his feline teeth before sticking out his cute little cat tongue.  Wrapping the towel around his waist, he cupped his breasts and gave them a slight jiggle and a little squeeze as if he was trying to guess the weight and freshness of fruit.<br />
<br />
He wondered aloud, &quot;How much control do I actually have over my tail?&quot;  In response, his tail swung out from under the towel and over to his right side just as he intended.  &quot;That&#39;s so cool!&quot;<br />
<br />
He grabbed his clothes, went back to his bedroom, and tossed the clothes on his bed.  &quot;I guess I don&#39;t have a bra.&quot;  He felt his left breast.  &quot;Luckily, these are cute little boobies, so I can probably get by without one for a little while, but I&#39;ll have to figure out what size I am and get one.&quot;  He picked up the white panties and looked for a label.  &quot;What size are these?&quot;  He wasn&#39;t able to find any tag and there was no printing anywhere on the garment.  &quot;I guess the Chronivac transformed my clothes, but didn&#39;t make a brand or size label.  I&#39;ll have to guess.  That could be tough.&quot;  He looked at the T-shirt and skirt, but those also lacked any labels.  &quot;No sizes here either.  Well, at least I&#39;ll be able to use a changing room to try on clothes, but the bra and panties will be total guesswork.&quot;  He looked down at the brown leather ankle boots on the floor.  &quot;And those boots will be fine, but maybe I can try on some cheap sneakers or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ed went into his office and grabbed his phone.  He started putting items into his shopping list.  &quot;Bra, panties, pants, shirt, sneakers, socks... What else?&quot; he asked himself.  He looked down at his body still wrapped in a towel.  &quot;I hope I don&#39;t need feminine products.  I don&#39;t even know what to do with them.  Do I need makeup?&quot;  He thought for a moment.  &quot;If I&#39;m hiding my face, I guess not.&quot;<br />
<br />
He got dressed in the clothes he wore yesterday and walked into the bathroom.  His hair was an absolute mess and the furry tail sticking out from under his skirt wasn&#39;t very fluffy.  He ran a hand up into his hair and could feel it was still wet, but that triggered an idea.  He opened the cabinet under his sink and pulled out a hair dryer.  Although his hair was usually too short to need one, he got one a few years back when his then-girlfriend was staying over.  She had taken a shower and given him grief that he didn&#39;t own a hair dryer...so he went out and bought one that day.  It had probably been used only two or three times since then...and one of those times was to melt excess stringy plastic off of something he had 3D printed.<br />
<br />
Ed plugged in the hair dryer and started drying his tail.  He used a hairbrush to fluff it up and help it dry faster.  When he had finished the fur was very fluffy and sticking out.  Next, he pulled the cat fur out of the hairbrush and started drying the hair on his head.  He used the hairbrush to style it as it dried because he didn&#39;t want it to end up sticking out like the fur on his tail.  That &quot;big hair&quot; style may have worked in the 1980s, but it wasn&#39;t going to pass today.  After a few minutes, he was satisfied with how his hair looked.  It was a nice symmetrical bob cut, but there were still two obvious triangular pointed ears sticking out from the top of his head.  &quot;Yeah, I definitely need a hat.&quot;<br />
<br />
His stomach growled and Ed decided he should probably get something to eat.  In the kitchen, he opened the fridge and considered his options.  He took out a half gallon of milk and poured himself a glass.  Standing on his toes, he reached up into a cabinet and pulled out a can of tuna.  He was about to open a drawer and get some bread to make himself a sandwich, but changed his mind.  He opened the can of tuna, grabbed a fork, and sat at the table.  After scarfing down half the can, he took a drink of milk and then paused.  &quot;Wait,&quot; he thought as he looked at the half-empty can of tuna and the glass of milk.  &quot;Am I subconsciously eating tuna and drinking milk because I&#39;m part cat?&quot;  He shrugged it off.  &quot;Maybe it&#39;s a coincidence.  It does taste good though.  I&#39;ll have a burger later to make sure I&#39;m not giving in to my feline features.&quot;<br />
<br />
After finishing his meal, he walked back to his bedroom, went to his closet, and pulled out a blue baseball hat and stuck it on his head.  He took it off immediately and adjusted the size to be smaller and put it back on.  The fit was much better now, but his ears were smooshed.  That seemed unavoidable.  He walked to his dresser and found a pair of sunglasses.  When he went to put them on, he realized he had a problem.  He no longer had ears on the sides of his head to hold up the sunglasses.  &quot;Shit.&quot;  He tried sticking the ends which would normally go over his ears under the baseball cap, but they wouldn&#39;t stay put.  He exhaled with disappointment.  &quot;I guess I&#39;ll just have to tell anyone that notices my eyes that I have contacts in.&quot;<br />
<br />
He took a KN-95 mask from a small bag on the top of his dresser, but quickly realized this would be an issue too since he had no human ears to loop the mask&#39;s straps around.  He reached back into the bag and found a white N95 mask on the bottom.  The straps on these kinds of masks wrap around the entire head, not just the ears.  He put on the mask, wrapped the straps around the back of his head, pulled his hair out to cover part of the straps, and then tucked his whiskers inside the mask.  Looking into his bedroom mirror, he figured this would be passable...until he looked down at himself and saw his tail curving out to the side.  &quot;How can I hide that?&quot; he wondered.<br />
<br />
He turned and looked around his bedroom.  Ed knew any pants he had would be far too large for his current body, but he needed to hide his tail somehow.  &quot;Sweatpants?&quot; he thought.  &quot;They&#39;d be baggy, but that might be passable until I can get something that fits better.&quot;  He walked to his closet and looked at options.  Coiled up on a shelf, he spotted a belt and grabbed it.  &quot;Oh, maybe I can tie it down between my legs.&quot;<br />
<br />
Walking over to his bed, he took hold of his fluffy cat tail.  He tried coiling it up by hand as tightly as possible without hurting himself.  When he finished, he had about an 8 inch circle of fuzz.  Standing up, he placed it between his legs and strapped it to his left leg with his belt.  He had to wrap the belt around his leg twice in order to get it to fit, but when he fastened the buckle, it seemed like it would hold his tail in place on his inner left thigh.  He looked at himself in the mirror.  Other than a small bump under the skirt where the tail connected to his body, there was no way anyone could know there was a long fluffy tail under his skirt.  &quot;Okay, this will do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ed grabbed his phone and then retrieved his car keys and wallet from where he left them in the kitchen.  Opening his wallet, he saw his driver&#39;s license with a photo of his old face.  &quot;I&#39;m going to have to drive carefully so I don&#39;t get pulled over.  I don&#39;t want to get caught without a license.  No cop would ever believe this is actually my license.&quot;  He looked at how much cash he had.  &quot;Only $34.  I&#39;m going to need to stop by the ATM.  I don&#39;t want to risk using my credit card or some store clerk might question why there&#39;s a guy&#39;s name on the card.&quot;<br />
<br />
He went to put his wallet in his pocket only to realize he had none.  &quot;Oh, right.  Women don&#39;t have pockets.  I guess I need to start by buying a purse.  Wonderful.&quot;  He withdrew the cash and ATM card from his wallet and left the rest on his kitchen table before heading out the door to his car.<br />
<br />
Sitting in the driver&#39;s seat, he realized he was sitting on his tail.  Since he had it strapped to his leg, there wasn&#39;t much he could do about it at the moment other than leaning to the side slightly so he wasn&#39;t putting his full weight on it.  He closed the door, put his hands on the steering wheel, and realized he was sitting pretty far back and a lot lower than normal.  Ed reached down on the side of the seat and adjusted the seat height and moved it forward so he could properly reach the pedals.  After adjusting the mirrors, he started the car and drove to his bank.  He pulled up to the drive-up ATM and withdrew $200.  He hoped he wouldn&#39;t have to spend it all, but figured it would be more than enough and hopefully save a trip later.  With cash acquired, he headed to the mall hoping that he&#39;d be able to get everything he needed in one trip.</p>
