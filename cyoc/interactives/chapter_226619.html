<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;God, there has to be something someone can do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I fucking told you man, the only hope I have is a fleshweaver or an NBM specialist - like I can afford one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is your aunt still sleeping?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, don&#39;t talk so loud.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How the fuck do you deal with her . . . new degree of . . . loving?  Do you - uh, hate her now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t get me wrong buddy.  My aunt is cool.  She took me in after my parents died and practically raised me as her own kid.  She was always there for me, to defend me, to cheer me on, to help me study, to make delicious meals for us, to make sure I had fun, to comfort me when I was lonely or scared or sad.  She tucked me in every night no matter what.  She loves me, and I love her too.<br />
But quite frankly, I don&#39;t love her to this extent.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No shit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Our current fucking - haha, get it? - situation stems from two factors:&quot;<br />
&quot;1. My aunt&#39;s extreme apprehension at my leaving from home - she was overprotective, but had been worryingly manic about my impending departure.  I felt terrible, but I knew I had to leave the nest at some point.&quot;<br />
&quot;2. Stupid Tim D.&#39;s obsession with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you know exactly how I got here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sort-of.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Allright then - I tried my best to be humble, my friends always tried to get me to embrace my apparent &quot;gorgeousness&quot;.  I didn&#39;t believe that I was as pretty as many other girls in school, but I just didn&#39;t want to draw attention - the single life attracted me.&quot;<br />
&quot;The jock Tim D., however, had keen eyes and even keener ears, and took to trying to serenade me into being his slut 2 months into school.<br />
At first, resisting his advances was a trivial, hilarious matter - until it became clear he was obsessed.&quot;<br />
&quot;Spreading rumors about me to my classmates, to my friends, and to the school, bringing me gifts every day, singing outside my bedroom window on weekends, and elaborately declaring his love for me during school, the creep became progressively frustrated as I put up a strong face and calmly refused each and every time.  I was terrified though - and confused.  Was he so obsessed with me because I, the &quot;latest girlfriend&quot; of his, was the only one who he ever had trouble with wooing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy crap - Sounds like a total psycho.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;EXACTLY.  But his FUCKING dad was the FUCKING principal of the FUCKING SCHOOL!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shooooot.  Wait, he fused with some chick he was screwing right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hehe, yeah.  Her body all the way down to her hips replaced his head on his fatass frame - it got feminized and its stuck to a tail coming out the top of his former ass - he&#39;s got no control over anywhere on the rest of the body.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah-ho-ho - a bit excessive of karma, don&#39;t you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;. . .&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So I guess you&#39;re wondering what exactly happened, right?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, my senior year at my high school had a week left to go.  I was packing for my upcoming trip to Des Moines with my aunt&#39;s help.  She was . . . clearly distraught, and it took everything I had not to give in to her gentle, watery-eyed pleading and just reassure her at every hypothetical she brought up.&quot;<br />
&quot;And then Tim D. broke into our house by wiggling himself through the open bathroom window.  He was probably incredibly pissed after I had run away again after he got up onto the lunchroom table I was sitting at and sang &quot;How Deep Is Your Love&quot; to me earlier in the day.<br />
Bawling, eyes bloodshot and surrounded by purple-black bags, the pathetic creep stumbled into my room.  Screaming that he knew that I loved him, but that &quot;insidious fucks&quot; like my friends and my aunt were pulling me back, he proceeded to unveil a pocket knife - and strip himself of all his clothes.  He was covered, chest to toe, in bleeding claw marks that his brother later told me he had been apparently giving himself.&quot;<br />
&quot;Stepping between me and the crazed idiot&#39;s impressive boner, my aunt told him to &quot;Fuck the hell off, leave my darling Sarah alone, and Get The Fuck Out Of Our House!&quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He didn&#39;t listen, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll never freaking know because the Fusion Wave hit right after.  It fucking caused the dipshit to levitate and slam dick-first into my aunt, before moaning and turning into a giant cock, and -&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;YOUR AUNT&#39;S HUGE-ASS MEAT THAT HAS TO ALWAYS BE IMPLANTED IN YOU USED TO BE YOUR OBSESSED STALKER?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;[Sighs] - Yup, goddammit.&quot;<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
- Squirming slightly to get comfortable, Sarah gently caresses her aunt&#39;s cheek - she forgives her for what she has done, and is doing. Even with her testosterone boost, and lithe new body, she looks as old as she did before - her brow is furrowed in anguish, worry, self-resentment, and shame not from a dream, but her waking life.<br />
- Tim D. morphed into a 5-foot long, 5-inch thick monster penis that, after affixing itself to Sarah&#39;s aunt&#39;s groin, began to flare up and throb uncontrollably, painfully.  As it began to sting, Sarah&#39;s aunt began to scream in anguish, worrying the young woman, who knelt down to ask her what was wrong.  <br />
- Later MRI scans proved the suspicion that Tim D&#39;s brain had fused sporadically with Sarah&#39;s aunt&#39;s, giving her, at random times, characteristics of Tim&#39;s demeanor, personality, sexuality, and obsession with her niece - leading to many a horrid confrontation or conversation between the aunt and her niece at unpredictable moments.<br />
- Though it is maintained that Tim D. took control of Sarah&#39;s aunt&#39;s mind in the following moment, Sarah&#39;s aunt has secretly, tearfully told authorities that she was fully conscious at the time.  Driven in part by the extreme pain of her new member and in part by the overpowering lust that had turned her sweating red, Sarah&#39;s aunt then pounced from her fetal position, overpowering her niece.<br />
- Pinning her to the ground, the aunt licked his lips and snarled as she tore off the girl&#39;s skirt and undergarments, screaming in bliss as her daughter screamed in horror, as she plunged her member far up into the girl&#39;s body.  She thrusted as her niece frantically screamed and kicked in protest before she ejaculated, causing both of them an unspecified level of sexual &quot;pleasure&quot;<br />
- Transformative semen still being studied by the WTEA somehow painlessly enlarged Sarah&#39;s reproductional organs to being 6 feet tall and 6 inches wide, rearranging her organs as it created a third, wide connection to her esophageal tract and gave her vagina elastic properties.<br />
- Once her aunt came to the realization of what she had just committed, she immediately pulled herself out of her niece, who was paralyzed with fear.  She didn&#39;t have time to apologize before the stinging of her new organ returned, all the more painful.  Having tried water to no effect, Sarah&#39;s aunt re-inserted herself into a cowering, terrified Sarah, beginning to cry as she tried to stop her shrieking.<br />
- WTEA tests confirm that no known lubricant, lotion, condom, or moisturizer currently has properties to stop Sarah&#39;s aunt&#39;s perpetually erect penis from rapidly drying in an extremely painful manner safe for the lubricating fluids of Sarah&#39;s vagina.  Due to this, the two must always be in a state of &quot;intercourse&quot; for the sake of Sarah&#39;s aunt&#39;s safety.<br />
- A proposal to remove Sarah&#39;s aunt&#39;s penis has yet to be approved, as an abnormal amount of femoral arteries supply blood to said penis.<br />
- Sarah and her aunt live currently in the safe-wing of a WTEA testing and care facility in Ohio, along with other low-threat transformees with severe transformations, where they are continually studied in hopes of a cure.<br />
- Sarah is currently working on studies to pursue her originally-planned career of being a veterinarian, while Sarah&#39;s aunt has been learning foreign languages and conversing greatly with other transformees.<br />
- The takeover of Sarah&#39;s aunt&#39;s mind by the &quot;likeness&quot; of Tim D. is characterized by sultry behavior, vulgar, sexually suggestive speech, vulgar behavior, outbursts of anger at Sarah&#39;s &quot;rejections&quot;, and sudden sexual acts - this ranges from breast groping to the thrusting of the penis, which often ends in orgasm, as Sarah&#39;s aunt&#39;s consciousness returns.<br />
- Mental takeovers have been occurring far less since the aunt and niece have begun a controlled, weekly schedule of sexual intercourse, which is thought to &quot;satiate&quot; the lust and desire of Tim D.&#39;s residual consciousness.  Such intercourse also serves the added benefit of decreasing Sarah&#39;s aunt&#39;s high libido, and decreasing pressure in her testicles.  Though initially, and understandably, hesitant and angrily reluctant at this act, after understanding the act&#39;s necessity after a particularly frightening mental takeover incident, the individuals have gradually gotten used to the intercourse.  No longer seeking to rush actions, the two, in a bizarrely familial way, seek to prolong the pleasure that takes their mind off of their current state of life. Playing board and video games together, reading books, or performing limited yoga routines as they gently thrust, the aunt and niece keep the sensation of bliss continuing for hours on end before becoming bored.<br />
- Great effort is made to keep both individuals&#39; morales high.<br />
- Great effort is also taken to not expose both individuals to the media, as with every other mutant in the facility seeking privacy.<br />
- Sarah regularly communicated with a supposed trusted &quot;pen pal&quot; in the world to alleviate her feelings of anguish before she wished to talk verbally.  She now communicates with me, Dr. Gril, on a nightly basis.<br />
<br />
I&#39;ve been placing extra attention on Sarah and her aunt&#39;s case. Seeing them awkwardly, embarrassedly shuffle around, in their WTEA attire, legs and knees slapping against each other as they gingerly try to avoid accidentally thrusting, knowing that every move they make is under surveillance, that they&#39;re supposed &quot;freaks&quot;, and possibly believing that they might be nothing more than &quot;an experiment&quot;, I can&#39;t help but scream in the soundproof observation room after I finish my calls with Sarah each night.<br />
<br />
Every day that passes, I&#39;m failing her.  I need to do better.  I need to help her.<br />
<br />
Just a lubricant or a lotion is all that we need.</p>
