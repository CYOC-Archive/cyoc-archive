<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In sector Z-85-B the last remnants of the resistance licked their wounds from their last battle. Over 20 dead and 13 captured, they  were losing against NormCorp and every day the world went closer the edge. But they continued to fight because of not them then who?<br />
That stupid saying was the only thing that kept them fighting, Jessie didn’t know for how long though. <br />
She had been the leader of the resistance ever since her predecessor was killed, leaving her to to pick up the pieces. <br />
Jessie was a cyborg bunny girl, with long rabbit ears and a fluffy tail, she had white hair with half dyed pink and cut into a shaggy wolf cut that covered her human ears. Her cybernetic arms and legs had white plating and her robot feet could transform into cybernetic rabbit legs. She had lost her limbs when she was 13 to a spinal injury that she suffered during an earthquake. Her rabbit features were the result of illegal experiments the Noki-Conrad Pharmaceutical Corporation (a subsidiary of N-Health (a NormCorp controlled corporation) were doing on runaways and anyone else they could get their hands on. They had bought her from the orphanage when she was 16, two years later when NormCorp had heard about the animal-human experiments they covertly slipped this information to the resistance and sat back as their enemy took out the “freak factory” without having to lift a finger. During this attack she was rescued by Micc, the former resistance leader and her mentor. He’s the one who had given her cybernetic implants and a purpose.<br />
After his death a few months ago she was a wreak, she was left to lead the last resistance but they were losing badly: almost four months ago their main base was raided and most of her people killed and they were forced to retreat to sector Z, two months ago they lost communication with their hacker after she attempted to break into LunSat-1, and last month their undercover operative, Jon, betrayed them for a cushy executive job at NormCorp. If those weren’t bad enough just today her mission to sabotage a NormCorp rocket launch was a disaster. 20 resistance fighters were killed and 13, including her girlfriend Kaya, were captured and were no doubt being sent to some re-education camp. <br />
Jessie wanted to mount a rescue effort but there were only eight people left in the last resistance, the bunny girl looked through their files:<br />
<br />
Herself, Gage, H00D, Rain, Hona, Noriko, John, and Kooby<br />
<br />
Gage Cambells: a 15 year old goth girl with anger issues and a thing for explosives, she was the former son of Reinc Cambells; the head of NormCorp’s security. She had run away from home when her father refused to accept her as a girl and not a boy, so he forced her into N-Health’s sexual rehabilitation program to brainwash her into conforming. Instead she improvised an explosive and blew up the transport vehicle, allowing her to escape. She had gloves that allowed her to emit explosions from her hands and was an expert pyrotechnics.<br />
<br />
H00D: real name unknown, he was an older man who wore a pink and black checkered hoodie with a high tech plague doctor mask with a digital visor instead of the goggles lenses. He was the best hacker, and had even trained P-Pow, who was lost when she went to LunSat-1. He claimed to have created most of the code used by NormCorp, he had defected when they discovered and killed his Catgirl daughter, Annabelle.<br />
<br />
Rain: real name Jin Okamura, a non binary swordsperson who wore a black and purple skin tight stealth suit and a bowl cut. Jessie had initially found it odd that someone in this day and age would use a sword but Rain could slice up a room of soldiers like it was nothing.<br />
<br />
Hona Laokinawa: a buff Hawaiian woman who wielded two heavy machine guns. She wore her hair in a tight long braid and had tribal tattoos covering her body. She used to be a soldier but went AWOL when she was ordered to kill innocent protesters. <br />
<br />
Noriko Kagaowa: probably the last Kitsune left on earth, she’s always in her human form but with seven white, red tipped fox tails. She wore her hair in a traditional hime haircut and wore a very short kimono with long sleeves that covered her hands.<br />
<br />
John Masters: an average salary man who went on the run joined after he was found out to be gay.<br />
He was taken to a re-education center and only managed to get out by completing treatment.<br />
While he had no special abilities or skills he was able to seamlessly blend in as a normal person and move freely, providing intel.<br />
<br />
Kooby: a creature with the body and head of a dog but the back legs of a cat, feathers instead of fur with wings. He was a good dog…thing? And was discovered when Jessie was rescued.<br />
<br />
Jessie shut off her holo computer and went to her makeshift command center made out of spare components and a large holo projector. On it she brought up the targets that would make the most impact: <br />
-Hannah Miller, director of NormCorp and leader of The Normal. Despite being over a hundred she was still dangerous.<br />
-Reinc Cambells, head of NormCorp security and estranged father of Gage.<br />
-Dr. Hector Gonzal, a new guy and newly appointed head of robotics. What little intel they had suggested that he was working on a new line of droids.<br />
-Jon, now Jonathan, Reen. The resistance traitor and new head of Normflix: the entertainment company that controlled the entire entertainment industry.<br />
-Hinata Asaya, NormCorp’s mysterious assassin and enforcer, she was a powerful magic user and is Miller’s right hand. She led a team of dangerous and powerful individuals. The resistance is definitely not strong enough to take her on.<br />
<br />
Jessie had no idea where to start but they had to make a move and soon.</p>
