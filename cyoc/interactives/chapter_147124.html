<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kellie rubbed her temple as she now drove towards Jacks house. Merlin had received a phone call of Baba Yaga, a call Kellie suspected wasn’t good. Considering Kellie was still in the doghouse for stealing his liquor (as well as being a 16 year old girl who was caught drinking) Merlin told her to head to the home as soon as possible. While she wasn’t thrilled about it, she was thankful to have a couple of friends along for the ride. Katie and Samantha had stopped by the check an Kellie and were only to happy to accompany her on her trip. <br />
<br />
“Thanks for coming with me,” Kellie smiled. “No problem Kel,” Samantha said. “I mean with all the craziness yesterday we wanted to talk anyway.” Kellie nodded as she pulled into the driveway. “Yeah yesterday was not fun,” she grumbled. “Which reminds me, how is everyone?”<br />
<br />
“Well everyone is back to normal if that helps,” Katie said. “It was like Circe said, when we left we became human. Still their are some sore feelings between those of us that became animals and those that didn’t.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah that’s probably my fault,” Kellie sighed. “When this is over we should probably all sit down and clear the air.” Agreeing that that would be the best possible idea the three teens now knocked on Jacks door. As the door slowly opened the teens gaped at Baba Yaga. “Thank goodness your here,” she said. “Please come in.”<br />
<br />
“Baba what happened,” Kellie gasped. The teens now stared in awe at the woman in front of them. Baba Yaga appeared to be a woman in her mid 30s now. The old crones hair was now dark, long, and healthy descending to the middle of her back while her face was unlined and beautiful. Even Babas body looked better, her hourglass figure having returned while she was now able to stand up straight. The woman though appeared exhausted, looking like a young and frazzled mother. “Oh yeah this,” she said. “Well, tried a spell to try and get Circe and Lilith to apologize to one another. Unfortunately it had some side effects. Now we’re all getting younger, which is why I’m going to need your help.”<br />
<br />
“So where are Circe and Lilith,” Samantha asked. Baba now gestured behind her, as the teens looked past Baba they noticed two young girls around 7 argueing with one another. “You got to be kidding me,” Kellie whispered.<br />
<br />
“Nope that’s them,” Baba sighed. “Thankfully I don’t think they’ll get much younger perhaps just another year but it’s starting to affect them mentally. The two of them are really starting to act like a couple of bratty kids.”<br />
<br />
“Is that going to happen to you,” Katie exclaimed. Baba shook her head before turning back towards the girls. “Well I’m not going to get that young,” she said. “I’ll probably end up closer to 10. Unfortunately though until we can reverse this we’re going to need someone to watch us.”<br />
<br />
“Baba is it even safe to enter the house then,” Kellie asked. “I mean, we’re not going to start growing younger to are we?” <br />
<br />
“No you should be fine,” she said. “But considering we’re not only growing younger but thinking younger I’d feel safer having a babysitter around.” As Kellie and her friends thought things over they noticed a 7 year old Circe race to the front door, her dress dragging behind her like a wedding train. “Baba Liliths being mean,” she whined. “She said she was going beat me up and my hurt my animals.”<br />
<br />
“No I didn’t,” Lilith yelled. The sandy haired girl had hoisted the bottom of her dress up as she ran to the front door. “And besides you kept calling me a dummy. I am not dumb Circe.” Lilith paused as she gazed up at the three teenagers in front of her. “What are they doing here,” she exclaimed.<br />
<br />
“We need their help Lilith,” Baba sighed. Lilith pouted as she gazed up at the group. “No she can’t come in,” she huffed. “I am Lilith, queen of demons. I will not have this child entering my home.”<br />
<br />
Kellie glared down at the child, her head was still throbbing from last night and she was in no mood for the child sized version of Liliths temper tantrum. “I don’t think you have much of a choice kid,” she grumbled. “Who do you think you are,” Lilith growled. “I am the all powerful demon queen. I will not be treated like some child who..,,HEY PUT ME DOWN!!!”<br />
<br />
Kellie had had enough of this, hoisting the small child onto her shoulders she now carried Lilith towards the couch, the child flailing the entire time. Dropping her onto the couch Lilith looked up at her in shock and anger. “Now you listen here little girl,” she said. “Right now the only thing I see is a bratty kid that needs to stop. Until we can fix this I’m in charge, you understand.”<br />
<br />
Lilith turned red with anger. Leaping off the couch the child sized Lilith now glared up at Kellie, waving her finger at the teen girl, the sleeve of her dress flapping as she pointed at her. “How dare you,” she growled. “I am no child. I am all powerful. I am to be respected. Show me disrespect and I will destroy you AND your whole retched family you whore.”<br />
<br />
WHACK<br />
<br />
Kellie had never spanked a child, not even when she was the mother of Katie in her original timeline. Lilith though had pushed the teen to act. Lilith was acting like a spoiled brat going so far as to not only curse at her but threaten the lives of her entire family. One swift smack on her rear had stunned the sandy haired girl into silence. Liliths eyes went wide as she instinctively placed one of her small hands on her butt.<br />
<br />
“Don’t you ever threaten my family you understand me,” Kellie bellowed. Lilith said nothing as she stared slack jawed at Kellie. That one smack was causing her more pain than she anticipated, her rear seemed to burn now as if it were on fire. “Sit down on the couch Lilith your in timeout.”<br />
<br />
The small girl could only nod as she now quietly sat down on the couch, her small feet dangling off the couch. Lilith was shocked, angry, and for the first time fearful. For the first time in eons, she wasn’t in charge. Although stone faced Kellie could see the girls bottom lip begin to quiver as her eyes began to dampen.<br />
<br />
“Look Little Lilith is going to cry,” Circe teased.<br />
<br />
“No I’m not,” Lilith grumbled. Despite her statements Kellie could see the girl was lying, the child sized witch looked to be on the verge of sobbing. “Ugh crap,” Kellie groaned as she rubbed her eyes. The last thing she wanted was for Lilith to start balling her eyes out and give Circe a reason to tease her. “Lilith why don’t you head to your room,” she sighed, “When your time out is over I’ll come get you.”<br />
<br />
“Okay,” she pouted. Kellie and her friends watched as the 7 year old slid off the couch and began to trudge towards the stairs, Circe singing crybaby the entire time behind her. “Circe stop that,” Kellie said. “Or you’ll catch a spanking too.” Circe immediately stopped, her hands instinctively covering her butt. As Kellie turned she could see Lilith walk slowly into the room, closing her door before the sounds of a little girl crying echoed through the house.<br />
<br />
“Wow,” a now 32 year old Baba exclaimed. “Remind me not to piss you off when I become a kid.”<br />
<br />
Kellie groaned as she now gazed at everyone in the room. Until she could fix this she was going to be stuck babysitting a group of grown down witches. “And I thought I had a bad day yesterday.”</p>
