<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Caleb stumbled back into his dorm and turned on the shower. His hands gingerly touched his nipples, which were sore and achy. They felt a little swollen, like some glands had been irritated when he’d rubbed and pinched them. He turned back and forth in the mirror, trying to see if they looked as prominent as they felt, but couldn’t tell a difference. He tested the water, found it perfect, and stepped in.<br />
<br />
The shower felt great. He hadn’t realized how tense he’d been, that class had done a number on him. He ran his fingers through his hair and undid the rubber-band. A cascade of long, black hair spilled over his shoulders and down his back. Caleb really needed a haircut, the Fabio look was so 90’s. He paused. Or maybe he kept it BECAUSE the Fabio look was so 90’s.<br />
<br />
He went back to soaping himself up, groin feeling strangely moist, like his scrotum was sweating heavily or something. Definitely needs a good scrub down, Caleb thought. As he scrubbed his oddly sensitive ballsack, he let his mind wander…<br />
<br />
Caleb imagined himself pulling up to a group of hot girls in a convertible, wind blowing his Fabio-esque hair behind him. He’d raise his sunglasses, flex his pecs, and ask if any of them wanted a ride. They’d get into his car and start going down on him. He’d thrust and lick their pussies-<br />
<br />
Caleb moaned, nipples hard, muscles in his thighs flexing strangely, and came. Fluid splattered along the tiles in front of him. He let the orgasm wash through him, panting. Goddamn that was hot!<br />
<br />
He finished up and turned off the shower, toweling off, and went to change his clothes. As he dug through his old pants to fish out his wallet and keys, the slip of paper Beau had given him fell out. He picked up and bit his plump lower lip.<br />
<br />
Should he call him? There were any number of women he could be spending time with. But Beau-his heart did an odd flutter-he was a cool guy. Yes. Very cool, and a wrestler, so they’d have tons of things to talk about.<br />
<br />
Plus if he were sucking a guy’s dick, he’d better get to know him, a voice in the back of his head whispered<br />
<br />
Caleb shook his head. No, that never happened, it hadn’t meant a damn thing. It was just class stuff. He’d been very firm about not thinking about the class outside the class. But he couldn’t deny his mouth was watering, thinking about Beau’s big fat co-<br />
<br />
He slapped himself across the face, hard.<br />
<br />
No more thinking like that. Caleb would call the guy and hang out and he bet Beau was just another dude, like him. He texted the number, said it was the guy from Pompinos class, and asked him when he wanted to get a drink. There, sent, done. He sighed happily.<br />
<br />
The door to his dorm swung open and Cameron McCall walked in. He eyed Caleb up and down, a smile playing on hi slips.<br />
<br />
“What?” Caleb snapped.<br />
<br />
“Oh, I just thought you hated long hair.” Cameron smirked. “Always going on about how girly my luscious locks are.”<br />
<br />
“You seem to be popular with the girls, so I decided to grow it out.” Caleb shrugged.<br />
<br />
“So you’re admitting you were wrong?”<br />
<br />
“No, I’m experimenting. This is college, right?”<br />
<br />
“Ah, the old ‘college try’,” Cameron nodded sagely, dumping his backpack and spritzing himself with something that was both floral and masculine. “Just like that fellatio class you attended?”<br />
<br />
Caleb’s heart leapt into his chest. “What?”<br />
<br />
“Christie and Jessica and Blanche were talking to me about it while I was helping them with their, uh, homework.” Cameron winked. “If you know what I mean.”<br />
<br />
“Ah.”<br />
<br />
“So?” Cameron asked. “Was it…good? Do you like your partner?”<br />
<br />
“He..”<br />
<br />
“He?” Cameron sat forward. “Really?”<br />
<br />
“I meant she.” Caleb corrected.<br />
<br />
“That’s not what I was told.” Cameron chuckled and checked out his teeth in the mirror, adjusting his hair. “I was told you and a hulking country boy were paired up and you two got the best time on the cunnilingus exercise. Good job bro!”<br />
<br />
“Uh, thanks.” Caleb rubbed the back of his neck, wondering why Cameron was complimenting him on sucking off a dude, when he realized that Cameron had made a mistake. He thought Caleb and Beau had performed cunnilingus on someone else. Like, as a team. “I gotta show the other guys how it’s done.”<br />
<br />
“You know, you’ve never struck me as the kind of guy who’d go down on a chick. I’m proud of you bud, branching out.” Cameron smiled at himself in the mirror.<br />
<br />
Caleb’s phone buzzed.<br />
<br />
“Got a hot date?”<br />
<br />
“Um, kinda.” Caleb checked the text and smirked. “Meeting with my partner to talk about class today. Guess he wants to meet now, before he heads back to his campus.”<br />
<br />
“Good luck, bro.” Cameron smiled.<br />
<br />
“Uh, with what?”<br />
<br />
“Your date.”<br />
<br />
“Dates don’t take place at 3 in the afternoon, dummy.” Caleb tossed his dirty shirt at Cameron, who batted it away.<br />
<br />
“What’s his name, anyways?”<br />
<br />
“Beau.” Caleb said. “He seems cool.”<br />
<br />
“Well, bring him around some time. I’d love to meet him.” Cameron picked up his wallet and keys. “But I’ve got work. Campus has a bar, if you can believe it, and I’m working as the bartender.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, good luck with that.” Caleb pulled on his own shoes and grabbed his wallet.<br />
<br />
“Hey, um, do my nipples stick out?” Caleb flattened his shirt and turned.<br />
<br />
“Uh, I mean, it looks like your cold, but nipples kinda always, you know, exist as slight lumps.” Cameron shook his head. “It’s not weird, if that’s what your asking.”<br />
<br />
“Ah, cool.”<br />
<br />
“Hey, body dysmorphia is something that happens to us all.” Cameron tapped his head. “It’s all in here man, you’re imaging things.”<br />
<br />
Caleb nodded and let out a breath.<br />
<br />
They left at about the same time.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==--=<br />
<br />
The place Beau wanted to meet was at this cheesy 70’s style diner at the edge of campus. It was decked out in neon, checkered floors, red and white tables. Even had a juke box. Caleb had heard they made great burgers and fries and the shakes were to die for. At least, that’s what all the chicks said, anyways.<br />
<br />
Beau sat at the far booth, sipping a Coke. The big, bearded guy was wearing his Letterman&#39;s jacket and some jeans. He smiled at Caleb, emerald eyes twinkling, and waved. Caleb smiled back, heart a-flutter.<br />
<br />
Caleb slid into the booth across from him and looked around.<br />
<br />
“Pretty cool huh?” Beau said.<br />
<br />
“Yeah.” Caleb picked up a menu and read it. There were tons of options. Chicken, Burgers, cheesecurds, fries. Pies. He wasn’t sure what he’d order.<br />
<br />
“Hey there boys.” A cute waitress with a southern accent, dressed in a collared uniform and a miniskirt, roller-bladed up to them, doing a little twirl as she came to a stop. “Ready to order?”<br />
<br />
Caleb stared at the menu before Beau gently removed it from his grasp. He blinked and looked up at bow. The jock winked and turned his attention to the waitress.<br />
<br />
“We’ll have two bacon cheeseburgers and fries.” Beau said, handing their menus to the waitress. “And a glass of Dr. Pepper for him and a refill of Coke for me.”<br />
<br />
“Dessert?” The waitress pulled out a notepad and scribbled their orders down.<br />
<br />
“Malted milk shake. Chocolate, with a cherry on top.” Beau winked at Caleb.<br />
<br />
Caleb went red.<br />
<br />
“Separate or together?”<br />
<br />
“Together.” Beau smiled sweetly at Caleb. “It’s on me.”<br />
<br />
Caleb squirmed in his seat, his cock hardening. He hadn’t the faintest idea why his dick had chosen this moment to pop a boner.<br />
<br />
“Well, alrighty then!” The waitress chirped happily. “Should be out in fifteen minutes. You two lovebirds have fun!”<br />
<br />
Caleb opened his mouth to protest but the waitress had already skated off. Beau reached across the table and grabbed his hand, stroking it gently. Caleb stared down at it, like it was a poisonous snake or a spider.<br />
<br />
“Hey.” Beau said softly.<br />
<br />
Caleb glanced up into Beau bright green eyes. He licked his lips. Beau’s hand grasped his.<br />
<br />
“Did I guess right?”<br />
<br />
“Huh?” Caleb asked, checking to see if anyone else noticed Beau holding his hand.<br />
<br />
“About Dr. Pepper. You seem like a Dr. Pepper guy.” Beau smiled. “I like your hair.”<br />
<br />
Caleb blushed, “Uh..thanks. I just decided to go full Fabio, you know?”<br />
<br />
“I think it’s great. It frames your face, make your eyes stand out.” Beau said. “I think your eyes are pretty, too.”<br />
<br />
“P-pretty?” Caleb sputtered.<br />
<br />
He tried to pull his hand away from Beau’s, but the country boy reached out and gripped it in both hands.<br />
<br />
“I like you a lot, Caleb.” Beau stared into Caleb’s face, searching for something.<br />
<br />
“I…” Caleb was flustered. He’d never had a guy come on to him before! How did he even respond to that? “I think I’d like to get to know you better.”<br />
<br />
“I’m glad you feel that way. Wanna walk with me in the Park tonight? It’s supposed to be pretty at night, with all the lights and the stars. There’s this path that goes around the lake-”<br />
<br />
The waitress came back with their order, forcing Beau to let go of Caleb&#39;s hand and lean back. Caleb was gratefully for the interruption. Not because he was flustered, which he was, but because he would have said yes. And that was kinda scary. The burgers were good, and Caleb took advantage of the food to avoid talking too much And yet, despite himself, he still found himself shooting glances at the handsome guy across from him when he thought Beau wasn’t looking.<br />
<br />
Then, his respite was finished. The waitress cleared the table and set their milkshake, gracing it with two straws.<br />
<br />
“See ya lovebirds!” The waitress giggled.<br />
<br />
Caleb had expected the comment, and even though his ears heated, he didn’t react. Beau took up a straw. Caleb leaned forward and took up his own. Together, they made short work of the shake.<br />
<br />
“Want the cherry?” Beau asked, holding it up.<br />
<br />
“Sure.” Caleb grinned and closed his eyes and opened his mouth.<br />
<br />
Instead of tossing it in, as Caleb thought he would, he found the cherry being placed on his tongue. Caleb tried to close his mouth but Beau had left one of his fingers in and he ended up sucking on it, enjoying the mix of cherry juice and finger.<br />
<br />
“You’re too cute.” Beau smiled, pulling his finger back.<br />
<br />
Caleb blushed and licked his lips, tasting the cherry juice. His cock was hard again. Beau tossed some bills on the table and got up. He took Caleb’s hand and pulled him to his feet.<br />
<br />
Caleb turned to leave, but Beau hadn’t let go of his hand. He turned back to ask him to let go and found himself caught up in a kiss. He tried to pull away, but Beau’s other hand squeezed Caleb’s firm ass. Caleb moaned, enjoying the scratch of Beau’s beard on his own smooth face. He stopped struggling and leaned into the bigger man’s embrace.<br />
<br />
“Let’s take that walk.” Beau said.</p>
