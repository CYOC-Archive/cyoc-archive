<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff wasn&#39;t proud of it, but he was still pissed at his ex-girlfriend Melanie for cheating on him last year. Although he could have done a million things with this program, the only thing that came to mind was getting revenge on her.<br />
<br />
He texted her and said he needed to talk. Melanie was clearly suspicious of his intentions but agreed to come over. While he waited, his mind raced. What kind of change would she hate the most?<br />
<br />
His first thought was to turn her into an old, ugly man. She&#39;d have to abandon her friends and family and hide forever. For a social butterfly that would be torture. Hmm, how about an actual butterfly? He imagined her stuck in a mason jar on his shelf, being force to watch as he lived his life and ignored her. Or he could turn her into a frog or a mouse. Those seemed too fairy-tale-ish, though, so he rejected them. Give her horse hooves? He chuckled at that one, but also decided it wasn&#39;t quite right.<br />
<br />
Jeff was still thinking it over when Melanie rang the doorbell. He went to it and invited her upstairs. Once they got back to his room he shut the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what the hell did you bring me all the way over here for?&quot; she asked while glaring at him. &quot;I&#39;m pretty sure you still hate me, so what on Earth could we have to talk about?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff idly tapped at the keyboard. &quot;Yes, Melanie, I do still feel bad. You&#39;re right.&quot; He slowly moved the cursor around on the computer&#39;s screen. &quot;I thought I might be able to do something that would make me feel better. Something that would make you feel as angry as I did when you slept with Pete. Something like... this!&quot;<br />
<br />
He clicked the mouse and the computer hummed and vibrated. After a second, it stopped. Melanie stared him. &quot;What the fuck is wrong with you? Do you think I care about some stupid compu...&quot; she stopped talking as she noticed huge clumps of her hair falling in front of her face. She reached up to grab at them and nearly all of the hair on her head slid right off, as if it were a wig. She turned to Jeff&#39;s mirror and started at the completely bald woman she had become.<br />
<br />
Melanie screamed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, calm down,&quot; said Jeff. &quot;It&#39;s completely reversible. But I&#39;m glad to see you don&#39;t like it&quot; he grinned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fix it NOW!&quot; she snarled. &quot;If you think for one minute that you can...&quot;<br />
<br />
Her sentence was cut short again as Jeff clicked a new option on the screen and she felt her body vibrate. &quot;What are you...?&quot; She couldn&#39;t even finish her question. She looked down as she realized her breasts were growing. From her normal B cup they were already up to a C, and still inflating. She groaned at the painful sensation and quickly reached back to un-snap her bra. It practically exploded off of her as her bust grew well past C and then DD.<br />
<br />
She hated to do it, but realized she needed to lose her shirt or risk ripping right through it. She pulled it off just in time to see each breast pass the size of a basketball. And yet they kept growing. She sat down on the bed as their weight increased. She had to rest them on her lap. They must be 75 pounds each!<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff!&quot; she shrieked. &quot;Stop this!&quot; He shrugged and clicked the screen again. Melanie&#39;s chest was so large it looked like she had a bean bag on her stomach. She was certain she wouldn&#39;t be able to stand up without help. She felt the cool air on her head and tried to put the pieces of the puzzle together. &quot;What are you turning me into?&quot; she pleaded.<br />
<br />
Jeff chuckled. &quot;Oh, there&#39;s no plan here. This is all random.&quot; He clicked again and Melanie watched in terror as her hands turned into fish fins. He laughed and randomly hit his keyboard without looking. Melanie&#39;s ears immediately stretched out into floppy, 4 foot long rabbit ears. They draped themselves nicely around her enormous breasts.<br />
<br />
Her eyes narrowed and she began to yell. &quot;You pathetic asshole! Even with this powerful machine you&#39;re still squandering it. What is this bullshit? Rabbit ears? Anyone with half a brain would be making millions of dollars with this thing somehow. And yet this is the best you can come up with. It&#39;s no wonder I cheated on you. Even when we dated I knew you were a loser. Plus, Pete&#39;s dick was WAY bigger than yours. And that&#39;s why I traded you in for him. I feel sorry for Sally now. She doesn&#39;t know what she&#39;s missing when she lets you fuck her. Maybe you should let ME fuck your new girlfriend &#39;cause I bet even I could fill her dumb cunt up better than you ever will!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s rage had been slowly building over the course of the rant. More than just these words, he was remembering every mean thing Melanie had said to him over the past 3 years. As she reached her crescendo and insulted Sally, Jeff slammed his fist into the keyboard. &quot;Enough!&quot; he yelled.<br />
<br />
The machine buzzed again and began to smoke a little. Jeff hadn&#39;t looked at what he&#39;d chosen, but the machine seemed to have a way of guessing. It knew what his emotions told it, which mattered more than the buttons he&#39;d pressed.<br />
<br />
Jeff stood up and walked towards Melanie. &quot;Don&#39;t you ever talk about Sally like that again.&quot; With each step, Jeff seemed more and more intimidating. Melanie&#39;s eyes opened wide as he approached. He&#39;d never stood up to her before and as he got closer and closer, she wondered if he&#39;d somehow changed his own body to be larger.<br />
<br />
&quot;I will do whatever I want to you now that I...&quot; Jeff&#39;s lecture ended mid sentence as he watched his ex-girlfriend&#39;s body. He hadn&#39;t noticed it at first, but she was definitely... &quot;Shrinking!&quot; Jeff exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;What!?&quot; shrieked Melanie, who was now realizing it too. Jeff wasn&#39;t getting bigger. He only looked scary because she was getting smaller! She looked around in a panic as she finally noticed that she was less than half her size. &quot;Jeff!&quot; she yelled in an increasingly quieter voice. The room was growing around her and even the bed now felt like a football field to her. She looked up at the man she&#39;d once thought of as scrawny and realized he could probably hold her in a single hand now. She trembled in fear, wondering just how small she was going to get.<br />
<br />
Jeff laughed. &quot;Oh, this is perfect. I&#39;ll keep you in a shoebox under my bed.&quot; He leaned in closer to look at the now-14-inch woman sitting on his bed. She was starting to get lost in her own pants so he pulled them off and tossed them aside. &quot;But what are you turning into?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean you don&#39;t know?&quot; shouted Melanie. She looked down at her body and realized that all of the previous changes were being washed away. In fact, all of her features were being washed away. She was becoming smoother and rounder and... clear? Her monster breasts were nearly gone as were her hips and butt and arms. She was becoming cylindrical and featureless. She began to whine as she watched her nipples fade away and her legs fuse together, bringing her closer and closer to a perfect tube shape.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can almost see through you!&quot; shouted Jeff. His brow furrowed as he watched Melanie sink from 1 foot down to 6 inches and then 4. She was now very plastic-looking and started to expand outwards like a tiny balloon. He laughed as he figured it out. He explained just as Melanie was curling up into a little round circle, collapsing on herself. &quot;You&#39;re turning into a condom, my dear!&quot; He laughed as he watched her face stretch out and fade away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeeeeeeffffff!!&quot; she shouted until her mouth and eyes and nose all vanished and nothing was left on the bed but a plain, regular condom sitting in the middle of a pair of underwear. Jeff would have never believed this used to be a woman if he hadn&#39;t watched it with his own eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is perfect&quot; said Jeff. He plucked the condom up from the center of the former woman&#39;s panties and turned it over in his hand. &quot;Now I&#39;ll...&quot;</p>
