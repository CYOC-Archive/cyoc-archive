<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">BEFORE WE BEGIN, FOR THOSE INTERESTED, CHRONOLOGY...<br />
The Moon Lake of Earth-1 stories are currently at Friday, October 23, 2015; with the Harper-Jenkins wedding scheduled for Halloween.<br />
The Moon Lake of Earth-2 story is currently at the Saturday after Thanksgiving, November 28, 2015.<br />
The &quot;current&quot; date for the Moon Lake of Earth-3 story is uncertain but personally, I believe we are somewhere in the beginning of 2016 since the Anderson family would of needed time to grieve after the untimely passing of William, and Eric still needed clearance from therapist Doctor Frances Twist before he could become a werewolf. The only known facts for sure are it&#39;s the Monday after Eric entered were society, and that Cassie O&#39;Sullivan, the she-wolf who turned and fell in love with Eric, will be having her 15th birthday that Saturday at the end of the current week.<br />
NOW THEN, ON WITH OUR STORY....<br />
________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />
Eric Anderson&#39;s first day back at school as the newest werewolf of Moon Lake was mixed.<br />
As both his older brother Nate and their friendly next door neighbor Ben Twist had told him, Eric received a LOT of congratulations throughout the morning, and was surprised that there were more weres (wolf and otherwise) amongst the students of Moon Lake High School than he originally suspected, even among his fellow Freshmen.<br />
Yet, even with all the congratulations on becoming a werewolf, he could not stop those who knew from also mentioning Julie Stovall. He tried explaining as time permitted that they were just friends and that what happened to her wasn&#39;t his fault, but the looks from some of the students clearly said they felt otherwise, even if they didn&#39;t actually say anything.<br />
As the Freshman lunch period began, Eric took his customary seat at the table where he and Julie usually sat and ate together by pure instinct. When he saw his new girlfriend and she-wolf Cassie O&#39;Sullivan approaching, that was when Eric realized that maybe he should start thinking about finding somewhere else to have lunch everyday, especially if he was going to start eating with Cassie from now on.<br />
But as he started thinking about offering Cassie the chance to pick a new spot for them, Eric was surprised that she stopped in mid-step on her way toward him.<br />
Then he heard a male voice behind him.<br />
&quot;Eric Anderson, I&#39;d like to talk to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric turned in his seat and saw a blond boy with sea green eyes staring at him. The fact that the other kid&#39;s hands were balled into fists at his hips didn&#39;t do much for Eric&#39;s mood.<br />
&quot;And you are?&quot; asked Eric, not recognizing the other boy.<br />
&quot;Arthur Curtis, and I&#39;d like to know what your intentions are toward Julie Stovall,&quot; he demanded to know.<br />
Eric could feel both his human and lupine anger boiling. All morning long, questions about him and Julie, and now this...<br />
The fact that he could smell this Curtis kid was a were-mer too didn&#39;t help as Eric slowly rose from his chair.<br />
&quot;OKAY PEOPLE! LISTEN UP!&quot; shouted Eric, doing his best to get everyone&#39;s attention. &quot;For those few who don&#39;t know, my name is Eric Anderson, and last fall I lost my father at the paws of a rogue werevixen!&quot;<br />
The lunchroom grew still, and a couple of teachers slowly approached the two boys as Eric continued. &quot;Julie Stovall was about my only friend in this school before then, and her kindness did a lot to help me get through that rough situation. But we were only friends. If there should of been or would have been any more between us, I honestly don&#39;t know, but it doesn&#39;t matter any more anyhow. When I announced my intentions of becoming a werewolf so I could eventually join the police department in hopes of keeping other kids from losing their parents before their time, Julie freaked, saying I was throwing away our future. Until then, I didn&#39;t even know there was one, at least in her mind.<br />
&quot;Last Friday night was a tragedy in many ways,&quot; continued Eric, not caring whether or not he would get in trouble for making a scene. &quot;If not for my older brother and his friends, Julie would have violated Statute 1A and turned me into a were other than the one I wanted to be. Her mental breakdown because of the brain aneurysm she suffered is NOT my fault!&quot;<br />
Then Eric faced Arthur Curtis directly before saying, &quot;I sincerely hope Julie gets better. If she is ever willing to do so after her recovery, despite the fact that I&#39;m now a werewolf instead of a weremer like you and her, I even hope we can still be friends. But regardless of whatever Julie&#39;s feelings toward me were or might still be, I never fell in love with her. In fact, I&#39;m truly in love with someone else now,&quot; he added, surprised to find Cassie O&#39;Sullivan now standing next to him.<br />
&quot;Now, if you will excuse us,&quot; said Eric, before he put his arm around Cassie and they walked away, leaving Arthur Curtis still standing where he was with his fists curled up against his hips, while the rest of the Freshman class was abuzz over this new development.<br />
_______________________________________________________________________<br />
AUTHOR&#39;S NOTE:<br />
It has already been established that if not for the trauma resulting from the death of his father breaking the fledgling bonds between them, it would have been discovered and confirmed that Eric Anderson and Julie Stovall WERE destined soul mates, with Eric eventually becoming a were-merman like his Moon Lake of Earth-1 counterpart recently did.<br />
However, many events have severely deviated from Earth-1 history because of William Anderson dying at the paws of the rogue werevixen Yvette Smith when she tried to claim &quot;her fox&quot;. <br />
So whatever happens to Eric and Cassie, Nate and his boyfriend Alex Ramsey, Samantha and Frances Twist, and everyone else remains to be seen as our saga continues....</p>
