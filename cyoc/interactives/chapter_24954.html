<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lara always considered herself to be an average person, if there was such a thing. She had shoulder length red hair, green eyes and wore glasses  (she was a little far sighted).<br />
<br />
She was 26 years old and wearing jeans and a tee shirt. She had her hair in a pony tail.<br />
<br />
On a Friday afternoon, she was shopping in an antique store.<br />
<br />
She walked through the aisles until she came to a section with various statues and sculptures.<br />
<br />
One seemed to stand out to her. It was a statue of a what seemed to be a ferret or weasel. It stood on its hind legs and was made out of marble. It was about as long as Lara's forearm.<br />
<br />
Lara picked it up, feeling its impressive weight. As she held it, she felt as though someone were watching her. She looked to her left and right and saw that she was alone in the aisle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Weird,&quot; she said to herself.<br />
<br />
Looking back at the statue, Lara swore that its eyes were gazing into her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me out Lara,&quot; a voice said. It seemed to come from within her mind.<br />
<br />
Startled, Lara accidently dropped the statue. Before she'd finished cursing at her clumsiness, the state was on the floor and had shattered into several dozen pieces.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn it,&quot; Lara said.<br />
<br />
From between the shattered pieces of the statue, Lara saw something both terrifying and fascinating. Red energy was emerging from the pieces. Before she could react, it flew up at her, circling her body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for freeing me Lara. Now, please join me,&quot; a voice, the same from before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Join you? What are you? What's going on?&quot; Lara asked.<br />
<br />
Before she could further react, the red energy was making her skin tingle. Lara lifted her right arm and saw red hair sprouting at an alarming rate all over it!<br />
<br />
Her left arm tingled now, she saw the same red hair coating it. Then she noticed that said hair appeared to turn beige on her hands. When she touched it, she felt a prick! Looking at her fingernails, she saw that they'd become sharp claws!<br />
<br />
&quot;No! I, help!&quot; Lara yelled.<br />
<br />
She knew there were other people in the store and doubted they'd ignore her cries.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry Lara, you're fine,&quot; the voice said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you? Why isn't anyone answering me?&quot; Lara cried.<br />
<br />
By now, the skin on her arms was cloaked by what she now knew was fur. It had spread so far that she could only feel (rather then see) it itching its way under her shirt and onto her chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop, please stop,&quot; Lara said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here, this will help,&quot; The voice said.<br />
<br />
Images began to enter Lara's mind. They were from the point of view of someone much smaller then she. There was a scent in the air, it attracted her, driving forth a desire to capture it! She ran toward it only for the image to fade away.<br />
<br />
When Lara recovered her composure, she noticed that her clothes were baggy and that the shelves seemed higher. She also felt warmer.<br />
<br />
&quot;What was that? Where is everyone?&quot; Lara asked. Her voice was higher pitched, almost squeaky.<br />
<br />
&quot;They can't hear you,&quot; the voice said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What ... what are you d...doing to me?&quot; Lara asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I will show you,&quot; the voice said.<br />
<br />
Much to Lara's embarrassment, all of her clothes vanished. She saw that beige fur had now covered her chest with red fur having covered the rest of her torso.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit, what are you, some kind of pervert?&quot; Lara asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No Lara, that's a human term. Embrace something else,&quot; the voice said.<br />
<br />
More images filled Lara's mind. She was in the grass and naked in the sense that she had no clothes on. She however, didn't need to wear clothes for she was covered head to toe in fur! A sense of freedom filled her. A form as beautiful as hers shouldn't be hidden with clothing.<br />
<br />
As she again returned to the here and now, Lara found that she now half her human size. Her proportions were changing with her torso becoming longer and her arms and legs stubby.<br />
<br />
She felt a pulling at the back of her spine. Looking back she saw a tail begin to snake its way from between her legs.<br />
<br />
Then, she lost her balance. A million things seem to happen at once. Her neck realigned. She felt her hair brush again the back of her neck and upper back.  Her arms, legs and hips ached. She fell onto all fours and squeaked in protest. Lara attempted to say something but her voice had changed. Her head itched as the sensation of her hair against her body faded until she knew she was bald.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry, you'll soon be one of us,&quot; the voice said.<br />
<br />
Lara's skull began to ache. She felt as though someone were pulling on her face. She squeaked in protest and panic as she developed a muzzle while her ears moved up to the top of her head and became rounded. She closed her eyes to ride out the sensations. Itching and warmth enveloped her head. Lara knew that fur was sprouting on her head.<br />
<br />
When they abated, Lara opened her eyes to a seemingly new world. Her vision was different. She was seeing more around her. Everything was massive and seemed different.<br />
<br />
The shards of marble before her glowed as the red energy flew back into them. Lara watched with fascination as they too turned into energy and formed into a shape similar to hers.<br />
<br />
When the energy cooled, a male weasel was standing before Lara.<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome Lara. I again thank you for releasing me,&quot; he said telepathically.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I'm, you turned me into a w...weasel?&quot; Lara said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; the male said.</p>
