<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
Kate smiled as Bobbi handed out another handful of cough drops to some kids.  Her plan was working perfectly.  At worst, she wouldn&#39;t be the only freak on the streets tonight. But that was only part of the plan.<br />
<br />
Because she knew &#39;candy&#39; like this could only cause trouble.  And when the trouble started, Carol and Mike would be busy trying to take down the threat, leaving just Bobbi to prevent her from stealing the wand.<br />
<br />
Of course she also had a backup plan.  While the others weren&#39;t looking she had palmed one of the cough drops.  If worst came to worst she could just slip on another costume and use the candy to change.  Then the next morning she would wake up safely in her bed, returned to her old normal body and thinking this whole horrible experience had just been a bad dream.<br />
<br />
Kate&#39;s smile was wiped off her face by an urgent need.  A need she had been trying to ignore, but now found it impossible to deny.  She had to use the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Kate ran to her bathroom and shut the door.  As she sat on the toilet she examined her new anatomy.  After she had transformed, Kate had ripped out of her clothes and was left in the nude.  Although she was covered in fur, she was still practically naked.  She could have worn clothes, but it felt strangely wrong.  She was loathe to admit it, but it felt good to walk around just in her fur.  It was almost ..... liberating. And it just felt more natural.<br />
<br />
So far she had avoided the bathroom because, as embarrassing as it was to admit, she wasn&#39;t sure where her vagina was located. Or even if she had one.  The costume didn&#39;t have one, after all.  And as she looked down at her groin all she saw was white fur.<br />
<br />
But as the need to void reached a fevered pitch, she prayed that a vagina was hidden in there somewhere.  She couldn&#39;t stand being blocked up like this all night. She began to dig through the fur covering her groin with her clawed fingers.  Thankfully she found it, hidden in a tuft of white fur.  After splitting her vaginal lips, Kate released the torrent of urine that had been painfully storing in her bladder.  <br />
<br />
As she held her vaginal lips open, she felt a strange tingling in her groin.  It almost felt .... arousing.  Could it be that her vagina was now more sensitive?  She gently teased it wider, careful not to cut anything with her sharp claws.  She softly massaged her clitoris and gasped in shock.  She had masturbated before - quite often, in fact - but it had never felt this good.  It was like her old normal excitement magnified a thousand-fold.  She closed her eyes and continued to stimulate her clitoris, rubbing two fingers against the sides of her sensitive labia, teasing them into her wet vaginal orifice.  The pleasure was overwhelming.<br />
<br />
Kate was brought back from her bliss by a gentle tapping of her foot ... against her head. She slowly opened her eyes and stared at her long furry leg in shock.  It was full extended, stretching past her head with her stubby clawed toes curled.  And yet she felt no pain.  She moved her leg back and forth, easily bringing her foot in front of her face.<br />
<br />
My God, she thought.  I am so flexible.  I wonder....<br />
<br />
She brought both legs up and curled her back, bending her head down to her groin.  Again she felt no pain.  It was just like stretching a muscle.  Eyeing her engorged clit, she started to lick it with her thin wide strong cat tongue. <br />
<br />
God, am I really going to do this? she thought as she hesitated, her tongue still sticking out of her mouth just inches away.  Her groin still tingled, begging to be touched, for her to finish what she started.  She remembered how good her fingers felt, and she just had to know what her tongue would feel like.  She ran her tongue slowly along her clit, gingerly licking it. <br />
<br />
Unimaginable joy flooded her brain, blocking out all coherent thought.  Her previous apprehension forgotten, she began to work her clit with her tongue eagerly, wrapping around it, licking it hard and fast.  Her fingers worked nimbly inside her wet vagina.  Soon she exploded in a massive orgasm, the best she had ever felt in her life.  She couldn&#39;t help but roar in ecstasy.<br />
<br />
Whoa, she thought as she began to recover.  I guess there are some good things about this body.  I could get used to that.<br />
<br />
As she slowly recovered, she looked over the damage.  In her passionate thrusts she had destroyed her bathroom, tearing apart the toilet paper dispenser and carving deep gashes in the sink and wall. Still, it had been worth it.<br />
<br />
She stood up and walked to the sink, still a little weak in the knees.  She examined herself in the mirror as she tried to clean herself up. She held up a furry clawed hand in front of her face, still wet with her vaginal juices.  It smelled ... interesting, and she couldn&#39;t help but try a taste. It tasted even better than she imagined and soon her cat tongue was licking the juice off her hand, savoring every delectable drop.<br />
<br />
You know, this body isn&#39;t so bad, she thought as she continued to lick, glancing in the mirror at her athletic body with wide hips and generous curves.  Strong, quick with enhanced senses. And sensitive.  Oh yes, very sensitive.  If only I weren&#39;t such a furry freak.<br />
<br />
She looked closely at her face in the mirror. <br />
<br />
Then again, I do look pretty good for a cheetah.  Quite sexy, actually, she thought with a smile.  Maybe .....<br />
<br />
Her thoughts were interrupted by a knock on the door. &quot;You okay in there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m fine, &quot; said Kate softly.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure?  We thought we heard something...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I said I was fine!&quot; snapped Kate.  &quot;Can you give me a minute!&quot;<br />
<br />
Her enhanced hearing detected footsteps trailing away from the bathroom. <br />
<br />
Kate silently cursed to herself.  What had she been thinking?  Did she really want to stay a freak?  Just because she could masturbate better?  No way!  I mean, look what it was doing to her already.  She had lost control of herself while she was peeing in a bathroom at a party.  What would happen if she went into heat?  Did cheetahs go into heat?  She didn&#39;t want to know.<br />
<br />
She looked at the cough drop she had palmed and hidden earlier.  <br />
<br />
No, she was going to get back to normal.  But not before she taught Bobbi a lesson for treating her body like a toy.  She washed her hands in the sink, wiping off the rest of her vaginal juices with disgust, and left the room.<br />
<br />
The others were quietly talking, smiling as they watched her return to the living room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everything come out all right?&quot; asked Mike.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it looked like... I mean, sounded like you had some fun,&quot; said Carol with a sly grin.<br />
<br />
Kate looked at her, carefully examining her face.  She was giving her a strange look. Kate looked closer and noticed that Carol&#39;s eyes were faintly glowing red.<br />
<br />
That bitch, she thought.  She used her x-ray vision to watch me masturbate.  What a pervert! And now she has the gall to act superior to me.  Well, you just made my shit list.  Yes, not just Bobbi, but all of you will pay.  You will all be sorry tonight, I promise you that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yes, &quot; Kate said with a Cheshire grin.  &quot;I&#39;m having fun.  But the night is young and I think the fun is just beginning.&quot;</p>
