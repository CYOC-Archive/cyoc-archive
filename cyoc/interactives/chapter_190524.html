<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Although Gloria and the othersbwere making progress in eliminating vampire nests, they still (according to Jacob and Caleb) had alot of work to do.<br />
<br />
With summer ending and school beginning, Gloria now happily returned for her final year of High School. <br />
<br />
&quot;So are you excited,&quot; Jackie asked as the duo pulled into Wests parking lot. &quot;I think so,&quot; Gloria shrugged. &quot;I just can&#39;t believe we&#39;re almost done.&quot; Jackie simply nodded, taking a sip of coffee as the two teens pulled into a parking spot. It seemed hard to fathom that it had been four years of high school already. By this time next year, chances were everyone would be going their separate ways.<br />
<br />
As Jackie and Gloria exited the car they glanced at the numerous students busily making their way inside. Already she could see Felicia and Adam heading in while Naomi and Diane chatted with one another as they drank coffee. Jackie now smirked as she gently elbowed Gloria. &quot;Check it out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gloria turned, a smile spreading across her face. It appeared Caleb would be going to school with them. Thevteenage demon hunter now pulled up in his vintage jeep, flashing a smile as he tipped his cowboy hat. &quot;Do you think he ever takes that hat off,&quot; Jackie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Only when he&#39;s in bed,&quot; Gloria replied, before gasping and throwing her hand over her mouth. Jackie now quickly glanced at her friend, noticing her cheeks flush crimson. &quot;Gloria did you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;NO,&quot; Gloria exclaimed quickly. It was true, she hadn&#39;t slept with Caleb. Still the two had grown quite close over the summer. &quot;I just know okay,&quot; she stammered. &quot;I&#39;ve um hung around when he takes a nap. He um uh takes the hat of then.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jackie simply gave Gloria curious look. If something like that had happened Gloria would have told her. Still, Jackie had been somewhat shy about sharing her experiences with Ann. For now though she would give her the benefit of the doubt. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh look here comes Sasha and Duke,&quot; Gloria said quickly trying to change the subject. Jackie glanced to where Gloria was pointing, noticing the raven haired teen and her damphir boyfriend pull up in Sashas restored Harley Davidson. The two teens now quickly walked towards the couple as Sasha parked her bike.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow Sasha you did it,&quot; Gloria stated in awe. &quot;It actually works.&quot; Sasha beamed with pride as she patted her restored motorcycle. &quot;Told you I&#39;d have it ready by the start of school.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just wish you let me drive,&quot; Duke sighed. &quot;I&#39;m trying to make a cool first impression Sasha. Kinda hard when your riding on the back of your girlfriends motorcycle.&quot;<br />
<br />
The girls giggled as Sasha now smirked at her boyfriend. &quot;Duke I love you but no one touches my girl but me.&quot;<br />
<br />
As the day started, Gloria and her friends quickly reunited with teachers and friends they hadn&#39;t seen since the end of the school year. Of interest was the recent engagement of Derrick Harris and Morgan Dean. The young teachers (after having moved in together last year) had finally taken the big step. From what they could tell Derrick had proposed when the couple went camping in Vermont. Ms. Dean now happily showed off her engagement ring, hoping that the two could be married this summer.<br />
<br />
As Jackie and Gloria made their way to science class they now talked amongst themselves. They were curious if they would get an invite to Derrick and Morgans wedding? As they entered the class they were happy to see Caleb, Sasha, and Duke waiting for them. Caleb smirked, tipping his hat as he gave Gloria a peck on the cheek.<br />
<br />
&quot;Howdy darlin,&quot; he grinned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Howdy yourself,&quot; Gloria smirked. &quot;Was wondering if we were going to have any classes together.&quot;<br />
<br />
The group now began to make small talk, until a familiar voice called for their attention. Gloria turned, a warm smile spreading across her face as she stared at Mary Elise.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good Morning class,&quot; Mary Elise stated. &quot;My name is Ms. McKinnon. I&#39;ll be your science teacher this year.&quot; Mary Elise now pushed herself forward, her classroom purposely arranged to allow her to maneuver her wheelchair. <br />
<br />
&quot;I know this class is seniors,&quot; she stated. &quot;And trust me, I remember all too well how many students have a tendency to slack off senior year. That being said, this won&#39;t be a cake walk. I expect your best effort throughout the year. Trust me when I say this. I won&#39;t just pass you because you&#39;re graduating.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gloria and her friends exchanged a look of concern. They had hoped that since they knew Mary Elise that the class would be easy. It appeared though that the young auburn haired woman was determined to educate her students throughout the school year.<br />
<br />
&quot;You think she&#39;s being a bit harsh,&quot; Jackie whispered. <br />
<br />
&quot;Is there a problem Jackie?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jackie slun around quickly, noticing Mary Elise narrowing her eyes at her. &quot;Um no Mar.., um Ms. McKinnon.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary Elise studied the girl carefully before turning to Caleb. &quot;Please take the hat off when your in my class Caleb,&quot; she stated. <br />
<br />
&quot;Um sorry ma&#39;am,&quot; Caleb replied sheepishly.<br />
<br />
Gloria was dumbfounded, staring slack jawed at Mary Elise. She certainly wasn&#39;t expecting her to be a strict teacher.<br />
<br />
As Mary Elise now began her lesson Gloria and her friends began taking notes. Mary Elise obviously knew what she was talking about. Gloria also realized that not only would the class be informative it would probably be the hardest class she had in her entire time at West High. Unfortunately, it appeared some of Gloria&#39;s classmates weren&#39;t exactly thrilled with the idea.<br />
<br />
Gloria glanced towards the rear of the class, noting a pair of seniors who appeared disgruntled at the idea of having to put in extra effort during their last year of school. Gloria knew these two quite well, a pair of troublemakers named Josh and Pete. The two were smart but notorious for pranks. It appeared that neither one were thrilled with the idea of the new teacher trying to make a name for herself at their expense.<br />
<br />
Gloria&#39;s eyes went wide as the two now snickered, fashioning a makeshift slingshot which they then loaded with a rather nasty looking and large spitball. Mary Elise back was turned as she now went of the atomic structure of certain chemicals. She was completely unaware that the two teens were attempting to humiliate her. Then the unexpected happened.<br />
<br />
As Josh let his massive spit ball loose, Gloria watched as it initially sped towards Mary Elise, it paused in midair before reversing course and hitting both Josh and Pete in the face. The two teenage boys sputtered before falling out of their chairs and crashing to the floor. The classroom erupted in laughter as Mary Elise spun around in her chair giving her class a critical look. The auburn haired teacher furrowing her brow as she looked at the teenage boys.<br />
<br />
&quot;Josh? Peter? Is their something wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
The two teens were flabbergasted, unsure of how to explain what had happened. Shaking their heads no the two now sat back down as they tried to wrap their minds around what happened.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gloria.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gloria gasped, jumping in her seat as she nervously glanced around. Who said that?<br />
<br />
&quot;Relax Gloria its me Mary.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mary,&quot; Gloria whispered in confusion. How had Mary Elise done that?<br />
<br />
&quot;Quiet,&quot; Marys voice chuckled. &quot;You look crazy talking to yourself.&quot; Gloria blushed, still unsure of what was happening.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guess Katie never told you,&quot; Mary Elise stated, her voice seeming to echo in Gloria&#39;s head. &quot;I&#39;ve spent the last year learning telepathy and telekinesis.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gloria gaped, shocked at Mary Elise abilities. Obviously she would need to talk with Mary later.<br />
<br />
Unseen by either Mary Elise or thw others a teenage girl had watched what had transpired with interest. Cassie was the only one outside of the wizards that had noticed what had happened. An actual wizard working as a teacher at this school! When she finally got out she would have to tell Miro what she had discovered.</p>
