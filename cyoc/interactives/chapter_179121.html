<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Once Jen finally swallowed Olivia&#39;s cum, she began to come out of her &quot;cock lust&quot; state. Olivia was laying back on her bed, panting heavily with her eyes closed. She felt Jen finally release her cock and move to leave the room. In her mind, she suddenly had one last urge to dominate Jen before she left. &quot;Jen wait. If you ever want me to agree to feeding you again, you right now will use your tongue and clean up your own pussy, the floor, and your heels of all of your pussy juice. I want my floor and you to be cleaned up before you leave this room.&quot; With that said, Olivia got up out of her bed, and using one of her toes, she smeared  a little bit of Jen&#39;s own cum that had spilled out onto the floor onto it and held it out in front of Jen. &quot;Now get started.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jen&#39;s mouth sucked in Olivia&#39;s toe and cleaned it fully. The she moved on to start sucking up her cum off of the floor. And finally finished with licking her own pussy, essentially using her tongue to snake it out like a pipe before carrying the contents up into her mouth to swallow it. She never hated eating her own cum, even before the curse. She would often lick her fingers clean after masturbating, and could even fold herself nearly in half which had allowed her to eat her own pussy. This was her standard method for masturbating even. She never needed a dildo because her own tongue had been more than enough. <br />
<br />
Now though, her tongue was almost too good. It felt even better than any masturbating she had done before getting cursed. She felt ashamed that for a breif moment, she thought that if masturbating would always ceel this good, that maybe this was more of a blessing in disguise than a curse. But only for a moment, before she corrected her thinking. <br />
<br />
10 minutes was all the tine it took to clean up the mess she had made. When Olivia was satisfied, she let Jen leave her room with a smile, as she no longer felt the need to assert her dominance over her sister and had returned to her usual cheery self. Jen just bailed out of there as quick as her hands and feet could carry her, almost stumbling down their stairs, but instantly regained her balance. When she landed on the first floor, Olivia was right behind her and made her way to the sliding back door inside the kitchen. &quot;Alright Jen, out you go. Don&#39;t come back to this door until you have finished this time. I do not want to risk you peeing all over the floors again.&quot; She said as she opened the door. <br />
<br />
Jen ashamedly walked outside. &quot;What does she mean by again? Oh god! Is is now normal for me to pee outside? I&#39;m not some kind of pet. I know how to use a toilet... oh... right. I can&#39;t actually use one now, can I.&quot; Thought Jen to herself before she remembered that she no longer could use chairs or anuly kind of seat besides the floor or a low stool/mat. She didn&#39;t realize it at the time, but now that she thought about it, she remembered seeing that her bed was now just a mattress laying directly on the floor with nothing beneath it. She couldn&#39;t use the toilets in her own home due to her head height limitation, so her family now let her outside to do it in the back yard like she was their pet dog.<br />
<br />
But as bad as she felt, she really had to pee. So she made her way to the tree in the corner of the yard and went behind it. She contemplated how best to approach this, but ultimately decided on the raised leg approach as she didn&#39;t want to risk peeing onto her own feet, ruining her heels by just simply squatting. Even after lifting up her left leg, Jen had to work up her courage to actually do it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright Jen, just let it out. No one is around anyways. Plus, how bad can it be? It is just doing something natural. Yeah.&quot; She whispered to herself before she managed to finally let it out. To her surprise, it actually was fairly easy to do once she started, and unlike how she initially thought, it was pretty clean too as none of it got on her either. <br />
<br />
It was then a thought entered her head. &quot;Why do I seem to be such a natural expert at this? I for sure do jot have any like, instincts related to this right? Well, if it is like everything else seems to be... perhaps this is not ky first time ever doing this, and more like this is how I have always done it? If I think about it in terms of this is only new to me, then it makes sense I guess as to why this feels so normal to do. Wait a sec, how am I going to wipe?&quot;<br />
<br />
It was a valid question as Jen didn&#39;t have anything with her to do so with. And looking around, there was nothing for her to use either. It then occured to her than dogs tend to lick themselves, and that she may have to do the same. Well, it wouldn&#39;t be her first time drinking her own pee, but she didn&#39;t like to do it. It would just happen sometimes when she masturbated. She really was not a fan of it, but she may as well try it out once more to see if this too feels normal or not. <br />
<br />
Her result: No, it did not feel &quot;normal&quot; at all. In fact, it felt anything but &quot;normal&quot;. Her pee tasted way too good to be considered &quot;normal&quot;. It tasted almost like watered down cum, which actually may be what it really is since her diet is now exclusively cum based. If it was just this much then there was no issue here whatsoever. Jen felt that she could easily do this every single time and not be put off by it in the slightest. She was so glad that she was just worried about nothing in the end.<br />
<br />
After giving herself a few more licks for her own enjoyment, she felt she was clean enough and made her way back over to the kitchen sliding door. Standing there was Olivia who had watched her this entire time. Her face was noticeably redder and she seemed a bit shyer than usual since she was avoiding making direct eye contact with Jen. &quot;Um, is everything ok Olivia?&quot; Asked Jen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? Oh, yeah. I guess so... uh, do you usually do um... that?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You will need to explain what &#39;that&#39; is first&quot; responded Jen, who shifted her stance into a squatting position, not unlike how a dog normally sits. Her ballooned out ass was providing a nice and bouncy cushion underneath her too. <br />
<br />
&quot;You know... do you always drink your own pee?&quot; Bashfully asked Olivia.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... right, uh. No, but maybe, from now on I may start to, as I just learned that I kind of, no, reallly like how it tastes. It tastes like cum in case you were wondering, and since I can swallow it, it means that it is actually made up of cum to some extent&quot; Jen says excitedly. Olivia didn&#39;t know how to process this. Usually jen would just use a leaf or the grass, or even just let it dry on its own accord. But today she intentionally uses her tongue to clean the pee off of herself. And she said that she likes it and intends to do it this way from now on too. &quot;How can she just say stuff like that so casually?&quot; Olivia thought in her head. &quot;Sure... you do you I guess. Anyways, seeing as how you are apparently choosing not to go to school today, which is fine and all. Don&#39;t get me wrong. But I was wondering if maybe you wanted to go out and see a movie or I could take you out on a walk or something? Just to get out of the house for a bit. You can choose where we go and what we do if you want and I do not mind paying for us if its needed.&quot; Offered Olivia.</p>
