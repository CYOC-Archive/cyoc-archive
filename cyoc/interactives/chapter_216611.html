<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When the bell chimes, signaling the end of the school day, Sayaka wastes no time and gets up from her desk. She turns to “Carl”, “hey, I got to run,” she says, “I promised Jess to go to the Mall with her. She has to buy a new phone and clothes”.<br />
<br />
“Carl” looks up at Sayaka, “c-can’t I come with you?”<br />
<br />
Sayaka shakes her head, “sorry, Carl,” she says, “but, you still look like a girl. If you’d start hitting on Jess, she’ll most certainly not want to go out with you, since you look nothing like a boy. You have tits, a girly face, long hair and nothing between your legs!”<br />
<br />
Carl hangs his head, “b-but…,” he says.<br />
<br />
Sayaka smirks inwardly, ‘this is so much fun, messing with Cornelia, hehe,’ she thinks to herself, before saying, “look, you want Jess to go out with you and even fall in love with you, right? You want her as a girlfriend and mother of your kids, right?”<br />
<br />
Carl nods, “yes,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Well, I suggest, you wait until your body has fully developed itself and once you are your true self, THEN you can start to move in on your price,” Sayaka says with a wink, “until then stay back. Don’t worry, I’ll make sure no other boy gets her, I promise,” she adds with a smile.<br />
<br />
Carl lets out a sigh, “okay fine,” he says, “I trust you Sayaka, you really are a true friend. I hope I will be a boy soon, or at least look more like my true self soon”.<br />
<br />
Sayaka smiles, “you will, I believe tomorrow, you’ll already look more manly,” she says, “you should let your mother give you a cool boy haircut, those long hairs don’t suit you”.<br />
<br />
Carl nods, “I was planning on doing that when I get home,” he says.<br />
<br />
Sayaka smiles, “good, well, I’d better run,” she says, “I’ll see you tomorrow. I wonder how you will look like and if I’ll recognize you”.<br />
<br />
Carl grins, “probably not, but we’ll see,” he says, “also, I’d need to buy myself new clothes… but I’ll do that tomorrow, I think I have a jeans somewhere I can wear tomorrow, this skirt feels so wrong”.<br />
<br />
Sayaka grins, “you do that,” she says, then they both part ways and Sayaka heads to the main gates to meet up with “Jess”.<br />
<br />
As Sayaka walks towards the gates, she decides to have “Jess” shrink to “her” “natural height” now, since they’ll be doing clothes shopping and they would need to fit Jeff’s new height. So, she pulls out her phone and opens the App, she then opens Jeff’s file and changes the last change to instantly.<br />
<br />
Jeff is already “waiting” at the gates for Sayaka to arrive, ‘I don’t want to be here,’ he thinks to himself, ‘but… thanks to her fucking command, I have no other choice’. The boy then suddenly feels weird, he notices that his clothes seem to feel much loser on his body, ‘wh-what the hell? Have I shrunken,’ he asks himself, ‘fuck you Sayaka!’<br />
<br />
When Sayaka finally arrives, the girl is grinning when she realizes Jeff has shrunken, “hehe… I think your new height suits you much better,” she says.<br />
<br />
Jeff gives her a hatred look, “f…,” he starts but is cut off by Sayaka.<br />
<br />
“Ahahah, JESS,” the girl says, “if I were you, I’d be careful what I say. Now, what did you want to say?”<br />
<br />
Jeff lets out a growl, “th-thank you, Miss S-Sato,” he says through gritted teeth.<br />
<br />
“Aaaw… come on,” the girl says, “be a bit more cheerful. Smile”.<br />
<br />
Jeff feels his mouth curl into a smile and he also feels his hatred towards the girl fade as he repeats in a happy and cheerful sounding voice, “thank you, Miss Sato, for helping me become my true self”.<br />
<br />
Sayaka smiles, “my pleasure,” she says, “now, let’s get going, you need a new phone and clothes, and you are paying for everything”.<br />
<br />
Jeff gulps, “b-but… Miss Sato…,” he says, “I… I won’t have enough money to afford a new phone and a full new wardrobe!”<br />
<br />
Sayaka grins, “oh, don’t worry,” she says, “nothing the App can’t fix,” she pulls out her phone, she notices Jeff’s confused look and grins, “oh, I transferred the App onto my own phone. Your phone no longer has the App… hehe… once you bought your new phone, you’ll put your SIM-card in it, so that you keep all your contacts and original phone number, then your old phone will be thrown into the nearest trash can”.<br />
<br />
“I… I can’t believe you,” Jeff says, “this is my life you are messing with”.<br />
<br />
Sayaka smirks, “no, Jess,” she says, “I am making your life better! Now, let me give you a gift, after all, I only hang around wealthy people… and… there… that should do it. You now have 500.000 Dollars instead of 10 dollars on your account!”<br />
<br />
Jeff’s eyes widen, “SAY WHAT?!”<br />
<br />
Sayaka grins, “hehe… that should be more than enough to buy the new phone and wardrobe,” she says. Jeff is unable to say a word, Sayaka grins, “now, let’s get going,” she says and both head towards the town center.<br />
<br />
While following Sayaka towards the center of town, Jeff tries and tries to get control over his body, but it is no use, the command Sayaka placed on him is far to powerful. Soon, Jeff just gives up, the boy feels defeated and miserable, ‘I can’t believe what is happening,’ he thinks to himself, ‘this is hell! I should have never messed with Sayaka’.<br />
<br />
They soon reach the mall and Jeff follows Sayaka into a phone store, “okay, Jess,” Sayaka says, grinning, “I want you to pick out your new phone, then you will choose a nice case, make sure that it is girly, so it should have at least pink glitter on it”.<br />
<br />
After Sayaka commands him this, Jeff feels his body start to walk down the aisle. The boy grabs a Samsung Galaxy A52 and picks a nice case covered in pink glitter. He then returns to Sayaka, “Miss Sato,” he says, “w-would these do?”<br />
<br />
Sayaka looks at the phone and case, she then smiles, “yes,” she says, “perfect, now, time to do some clothes shopping. Go ahead and pay for the two items, then hand both to me so that I can set it up for you”.<br />
<br />
“Yes, Miss Sato,” Jeff says, he then walks straight for the counter and pays for the phone and cover, blushing hard when the cashier gives him a strange look. After paying for his new phone and case, Jeff and Sayaka leave the store.<br />
<br />
“Now, hand me your new phone,” Sayaka orders, Jeff of course obeys. He watches miserably as Sayaka takes out his old phone and opens the back, she then takes out the SIM-Card and inserts it into Jeff’s new phone. Sayaka then continues setting up Jeff’s new phone and adds her contacts to Jeff’s contact list, then adds Jeff’s number to her own contacts, she then hands the phone back to Jeff after placing it in the case. “There, all set and ready to go,” she says, “isn’t this a much cooler phone than your old one,” she asks.<br />
<br />
“It… yes, Miss Sato,” Jeff says, “it is so much nicer than my old one”.<br />
<br />
Sayaka smiles, “glad to hear that,” she says, she then walks over to a trash can and throws Jeff’s old phone into it. Sayaka grins as she turns around to face Jeff, “now, off to the clothes store. Time you learn something about fashion”.</p>
