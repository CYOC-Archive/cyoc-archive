<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I had to break free. At first, I tried to just physically pull away, but the kobold wouldn’t budge. Was he stronger than me? I guess after 73 levels, even a spellcaster would have more strength. His concentration didn’t break, chant didn’t slow, he was continuing as is and more energy was pouring from the chain to me. It felt good, I was getting stronger, altering to be exactly what this summoner needs. My class changing from Adventurer to Protector, the options to leave the party greyed out, along with half the commands in the menu. I navigated to status to check what really was happening to me. My strength was increasing by the second, as was my romantic appeal. Level catching up with the kobold, and intelligence starting to diminish.<br />
<br />
In line with the changes, my thoughts began to slow. For a moment I forgot why I was here and what I was doing. There’s a kobold, a chain, and me. The chains making me feel good, but chains are bad, and I want to be free. It was my last attempt at resistance, I was strong, so I could beat up the kobold. My hand formed a fist just as scales began to take over the skin. Arm rolled back, then punching forward. Slamming into the kobolds face as he’s thrown to the back of the room. The binding causing me to tumble with him, the two of us hitting the ground, and the injured reptile lets out a quiet laugh.<br />
<br />
“Thank you for making it feel authentic. I forgot they’ll try to fight back when we do the real thing.”<br />
<br />
I tried to process his words, some inbuilt understanding reaching me. I’m the first of many, he still needs a striker, debilitater, and supporter. There are more humans out there, waiting to become a part of something better, like me. I’m part of something better. My body grows, gear shredding and breaking, weapons falling to the side. Now even my inventory is greyed out, red prompts letting me know that my items are all being discarded and destroyed. The scales forming on my arm spreading out to my shoulder and chest. Colourless initially, then gaining the same greenish hue as my kobold.<br />
<br />
My cock throbs while I go over those words. ‘My’ kobold, that’s right, he’s mine. I’m his protector, and I’m the fine beast that he also needs to get on his knees for. I waste no time getting to my feet, hefty body now a mass of muscles covering my nine-foot self. I had grown considerable in that short time when the spell was being cast, and now the last stages of the enchantment were working throughout my being.<br />
<br />
“Suck” I said in a simple and brutish tone. A command that caused the small kobold to look up, then smile. Shuffling towards me as his maw opens and tongue wraps around my still human member. He was serving a soon to be dragon, and he was proud of it. <br />
<br />
‘Strength Increased’ ‘Intelligence Decreased’<br />
<br />
The scales had overtaken my chest as Vix finally stuffed my entire dick into his reptilian maw. Kobolds were always designed for dragon cock, but he was familiar enough with my still-human member. His short claws pressing against my hefty balls. Teasing the full sacs as he started to suck on my cockhead. It was everything I wanted, everything I needed. My now green chest puffing out with my shorter breaths. The stimulation caused by this needy kobold helping to redefine what was left of me. My pecs large, nipples completely gone. No six packs of abs underneath, but just a solid slab of scales which were tougher than a castles wall. Vix eyeballing me, looking over my draconic chest and right hand. <br />
<br />
‘Charisma Increased’ ‘Wisdom Decreased’<br />
<br />
I knew what this kobold needed, and how to get him working even harder. My new claw forming a fist, then tensing. Scales hiding most of my muscle definition, but biceps still bulging with the single action. I could break a building with a single punch, and felt that same might be transferred to my other arm. The scales finally claiming it as another piece of my new draconic majesty. My previously strong form even stronger, arm even larger as it is hidden by the new wave of green. Hairs all falling out or vanishing, as I flex all parts of me for my kobolds enjoyment. His licks, laps, and sucks speeding up as a result of my show. <br />
<br />
‘Constitution Increased’ ‘Humanity Removed’<br />
<br />
My cock unloads itself into the kobold’s maw, emptying my human seed as I continue to give my summoner his show. Kix backing away, my own cock finally back in view as its alien compared to before. Red and slowly descending into a slit which opens near my crotch. The sensation different than I expect, I feel parts of my cock rubbing against me as it retreats. One of my fingers curiously descending to my opening and giving it a rub, coaxing my dick back out as that rubbing feeling repeats. There are layers to the new red member, lines of increased thickness before the mushroom-like head. Of course, it’s my dragon’s pride, perfect for the long and wide mouth of my horny kobold.<br />
<br />
“C-can I suck you again?” Vix asks with clear need, a grunt escaping my throat. It’s getting hard to speak, not that I need to. A behemoth like me fights, fucks, and makes sure his kobold is safe. The smaller lizard taking my cock into his mouth again. It’s even better than before, a tighter fit with his tongue rubbing against each layer of my cock. <br />
<br />
A roar escapes my throat, two nubs appearing on my back, and one above my ass. Spreading out to mighty wings and a thick tail. Spikes pressing out on the edge of each new body part. The bones a dim white colour, contrasting with my otherwise green scales. Those green plates now also consuming my lower half. Thighs wide and protected as they too are overtaken by the changes. Vix grabbing onto my staunch legs, using them for support as he continues to keep my cock right where it belongs. My hefty tail starting to sway as my toenails become claws and feet strong enough to support my form.<br />
<br />
‘Race changed, Green Draconid. Skills Adjusted.’<br />
<br />
I look to the waves of light above. The last parts of my pesky human status finally being worked out of the system. My face widening then stretching forward, imposing dragonlike visage starting to form as my mouth becomes an intimidating snout filled with teeth. Nose becoming two small slits above my maw, eyes reptilian and irises dark green. Hair replaced by rows of spikes, horns jutting out of the sides of my skull. An acidic mist being produced with my breath as I test my new powers. I was complete, finally, a might draconic. Stronger than a dragonborn, truer to the dragons we come from. <br />
<br />
‘Personality finalised’ ‘Name changed: Jer’karthurmy’<br />
<br />
My confidence in what I am solidified. I am the strongest thing around. I am a dragon that needed a kobold to service him. And I have that little reptile currently locked around my cock. My right claw moving to rest underneath his muzzle, digging against his scales and having his eyes meet mine. <br />
<br />
“Good. You drink.”<br />
<br />
My voice is slow, but the command is given. My draconic cock giving Vix his favourite treat. The kobold drinking down his second dose of cum without a complaint, just keeping himself locked in place for the gift he is receiving. Licking his maw and cleaning up the last drops as he finally breaks away from my dick, and wraps his arms around my legs and lower half.<br />
<br />
“I… I love how you look. You’re really cool, and I finally have someone to be around so that’s good too and…” I bend down, bringing my kobold into a full hug. Sealing him between firm arms and slab-like chest.<br />
<br />
“Love you too. But, get more. More friends.”<br />
<br />
“Y-yes. More friends, will you help me make more humans into summons?”<br />
<br />
“Always.”<br />
<br />
My essence starts to be drawn into the chain. Hefty self converting to pure energy to be stored for my summoners use. My being disappearing and my consciousness dimming even further as I enter my kobolds aether, and reform on him. Two green wings sprouting from his back, and containing me until it is time for me to be summoned. I continue to be partially aware of my surroundings through Vix, and I was comfortable always being by my kobolds side.<br />
<br />
It was only a few more days until the worlds fully combined. I had quite the task for me, to protect Vix from the humans who were the final wave of resistance. Beating and throwing aside anyone who would dare hurt my kobold, and leaving them as offering for Vix’s new friends with the other races. Some humans proved their worth in our fights, and joined me as summons bound to our kobold. The group of us staying together, and enjoying the rare nights where we might all be summoned to relieve ourselves of any pent up load.</p>
