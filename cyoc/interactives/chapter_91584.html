<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“How exactly does this work?” I asked as I looked suspiciously at the object in Allan’s hands.<br />
<br />
“We call this ‘The Mind Revealer.’  It scans all parts of your brain and from that scan it creates your alter-ego,” he explained.  “I can’t say anymore because that’s all I know about it.  I’ve studied it for years to figure out how exactly it works, but it remains a mystery.”<br />
<br />
“Couldn’t you just wish for the ring to tell you how it works?” I asked.<br />
<br />
Allan nodded.  “Yes, and in fact I have,” he said.  “What I learned was exactly what I just told you.  I feel that there is something that prevents me from learning more, even with the ring’s help.  I suspect The Mysterious One is responsible.”<br />
<br />
Bradley groaned loudly.  “Oh, can we just move it along, please?” he complained.<br />
<br />
“Fine,” said Allan.  “Joe, I am going to put this around your head.  Yes, it is too big for your head.  Don’t be concerned about that.  It will remain in place just fine.  In a few minutes’ time, it will take the scan of your brain and it will then beam that information to your ring.  We’ll take up the process once we’re there.”  Allan walked over to my seat with “The Mind Revealer” in his hands.  “I would recommend you remain seated, but please lean forward so I can put this on you.”  I did as he asked.  I felt an odd sensation surround my head as he put it around me.  He backed away and I instinctively reached up to touch it and make sure it would not move.  “Don’t touch it!” he warned.  “The process has already started.  You should feel it”<br />
<br />
I quickly pulled my hands down.  “I feel like a…magnetic sensation between my head and it,” I said.<br />
<br />
“Oh,” he said.  “Well, um…you’re going to feel more than that.”<br />
<br />
I didn’t have to ask him to explain further, because I immediately began to feel a much stronger sensation.  It was like a concentrated vibrating or pulsating of some kind.  After a few seconds that ended and I felt something much different and much worse.  I began to feel as if The Mind Revealer was shooting small, sharp pins into my head.  Each time it happened, it caused me to jump a little in my seat.  I heard Bradley laugh a little when this happened.  Fortunately the feeling of being attacked by unseen forces only lasted for a brief time.  After it stopped, the vibrating sensation returned.  Then that, too, ceased and I felt nothing again.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, however, my hand which bore the ring lifted itself into the air without me doing it.  I glanced upward to see a small, dull green beam of light shoot itself into the ring.  This was just as Allan said it would happen.  A few seconds later that was done and my hand fell to a resting position.<br />
<br />
“Now comes the moment of revelation,” said Allan.  “Listen to me, because this is very important as to the wording.”<br />
<br />
“Aren’t you forgetting something?” asked Julie.<br />
<br />
“Oh, of course,” said Allan.  “Joe, this may be embarrassing, but you really ought to remove your clothes before you do anything else.”<br />
<br />
I didn’t like the sound of that, to be honest.  I looked to Victoria and asked, “Do I have to?”<br />
<br />
She nodded.  “Trust me when I say it is the smart thing to do.  None of us know for sure what will happen to you,” she said.  Then she added, “Besides, I have already seen you naked, Allan and Bradley have the same parts, and Julie…well…”<br />
<br />
“I’m a sex addict, remember?” Julie interrupted.  “I’ve lost count as to how many different cocks I’ve seen,” she said without embarrassment.  Victoria looked stunned at her.  “What?  Ever since you came along you’ve always said don’t be embarrassed by the past.”<br />
<br />
Victoria conceded the point.  “You are right,” she said.  She turned back to me.  “Come on, Joe, get those clothes off.”<br />
<br />
Reluctantly and slowly I took off my clothes.  I tried my best to not get aroused.  I also tried not to look at Julie at all.  I tried to steal a quick glance just to see if she had any reaction to my prowess, but I could not tell.  Based upon what she’d just said, I probably had nothing she hadn’t already seen.<br />
<br />
Allan instructed me on what to say.  I had to wish not only to now become the alter-ego that had been created, but I had to make all wishes that would allow me and the alter-ego to properly function as a member of P.H.A.N.T.O.M.  I listened carefully to what he said and took a deep breath.  Before I could make the wish, Allan said, “Oh, just one more thing.  In all likelihood, your first transformation is going to be painful.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, gee, thanks,” I said.  Oh, well, I thought.  There was no turning back now.  I took another deep breath.  “I wish that I will turn into the alter-ego that has been created for me and stored within my ring.  I wish that, from this time forward, I will be able to turn into my alter-ego without needing to make a wish to do so.  I wish that I will turn into my alter-ego whenever I am summoned to do so.  I wish that my alter-ego will know how to turn back into my normal self whenever necessary.”<br />
<br />
The first thing that happened was I realized Allan was not lying.  I felt an immense wave of pain hit my entire body.  I doubled over and clutched at my stomach while groaning loudly.  I had never felt pain like this at any time in my life.  I unwillingly fell to my knees.  I leaned back and placed my hands on the floor to brace myself.  That is when I saw the changes begin.  I felt an enormous amount of pressure in my cock.  I watched in stunned horror as my cock slowly and steadily began to shrink.  My eyes were as wide as they could be as I watched my precious manhood pull itself into my body.  All I could do was continue to groan painfully.<br />
<br />
I crawled back over to the table and pulled myself up.  When I placed my hands on the table, I watched my fingernails grow longer.  My hands and fingers, meanwhile, became smaller and thinner.  I pulled myself up as best I could.  Once I was fully standing again I was able to focus on my cock.  It was no larger than that of a small boy and still growing smaller.  I felt something almost like a tear and then saw my testicles deflate and the skin that held them pull up to my body.  My cock shrank even more, lost its recognizable shape and then disappeared.  I instinctively reached down and found that I now had a pussy.<br />
<br />
Well, I thought to myself, I knew I was becoming a woman.  But why, I tried to wonder.  The painful sensations kept me from further exploring that question.  I looked down and saw that my feet were several sizes smaller and had a dainty appearance, much like my hands.  I felt pain in my legs and arms next.  Once again I doubled over in pain and I braced myself against the top of the table this time.  Both my arms and legs grew thinner and smaller.  <br />
<br />
Then I felt intense pressure build up in my hips.  I felt a great deal of pain as my hips grew wider.  The pain continued as I felt my ass grow larger and rounder.  In a way it felt like I had several balloons inside me that were all blowing up at once.  I tried to place my hands on my ass and was shocked to find that my hands only covered a small portion of my ass.  What the hell was I becoming?<br />
<br />
If the pain from my hips and ass had been bad, the pain that came next from my waist was worse.  I felt my waist growing narrower and my stomach growing smaller and flatter.  It affected my breathing as I had to take several quick, sharp breaths just to prevent myself from passing out.  As this happened I felt something tickle my shoulders and my neck.  I glanced quickly to my side and had a bunch of long hair hit me in the face.  I wasn’t really surprised to suddenly have long hair, but I was shocked to see that my hair was suddenly blonde.  Actually, it wasn’t even blonde so much as it was a fairly obviously dyed blonde.  <br />
<br />
Now I felt an enormous pressure build up in my chest.  I knew exactly what was coming next.  I actually fell backward into one of the chairs as the pain hit me.  I watched in a combination of bewilderment and amazement as my nipples enlarged and then pushed out from my chest.  They formed little cones and then pushed out into firm, perfectly round globes.  But they just kept growing and growing.  As they continued to grow larger, I kept moaning louder and louder.  As I continued to moan my voice rose steadily higher in pitch.  My voice just kept changing as my breasts grew until it looked like I had two basketballs on my chest.  I couldn’t tell exactly what my body looked like, but with how large my breasts, hips and ass had grown, combined with how small my waist felt, I was afraid I looked like an over-exaggerated Barbie doll.<br />
<br />
My hair continued to grow and eventually it had grown down to my gigantic breasts.  I thought that that looked kind of neat.  Then I suddenly tried to figure out why I thought that.  I felt my face beginning to change.  I could feel my cheekbones lift and my chin grow rounder.  I also felt my lips plump and my eyelashes lengthen.<br />
<br />
All of a sudden I felt my mind go into a haze.  I found it much harder to concentrate on what was happening to me.  The painful sensations in my body seemed to go away.  I clutched at my head as things continued to feel weird in my mind.  I had trouble remembering where I was.  Then I had trouble remembering who I was.  That was the last thing I could remember before my eyes rolled into my head and my head hit the table.</p>
