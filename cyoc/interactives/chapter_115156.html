<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A mobster’s son languishes in jail. Awaiting his day in court for shooting Peter Talbot just for his car; a were-lion and prince of the were-lion pride. The mobster in town planning who knows what. Two incidences that caused a were-alert to be in effect.<br />
<br />
Zylina Nash could care less about the current issues going on in town. All she cared was claiming Nate Anderson as her mate. A fellow werewolf and in her same grade; the seventeen year old red head, who’s fursona is akin to that of the red wolf. Her fur more auburn than the traditional grey and white; she sat on her bed and sulked.<br />
“Tonight was going to be the night I joined Nate’s werewolf pack,” Zylina fumed; “but this damed were-alert killed that.”<br />
<br />
Zylina was smitten with Nate all last year during school; unable to bring up the nerve to talk to him; Zylina resorted to slipping love notes into his locker. Finding out he was seeing someone; a were-lioness no less, drove the young girl to tears as she spent a good portion of a school day hiding in the girls washroom. It was only after Christmas break that she finally got the nerve to confront Nate. Unfortunately he was on a date at the time and his girlfriend Jean Talbot made it clear that Nate was spoken for.<br />
‘We lions don’t mewl and hiss to a threat. WE ROAR! So do you really want to challenge me pup?’<br />
<br />
Those words still fresh in Zylina’s head despite it being almost six months since that incident happened. Finding out that Jean Talbot was the daughter of Leon Talbot; the king of Moon Lake’s were-lion pride and were-lion rep on the elder council, the were-lioness was high up on the social scene and a few years older than Zylina.<br />
<br />
This pale in comparison to the surprise the red furred werewolf will soon get. Not knowing that Nate and Jean had a were-wedding; making the two married in the eyes of nature. Nor did Zylina know that because of this, Jean would have been made an honorary member of the pack. Issues that Zylina will soon have to deal with, once the were-alert is lifted.<br />
<br />
Getting off of her bed, Zylina grabs her robe and throws it on. Despite being in her fursona and not having any qualms walking around the house naked. Her father insisted that some modesty be maintained while company was present. Heading downstairs to the kitchen to grab a drink; Zylina spies her father’s guests. The same men that came by Friday morning; men from Romania, headquarters for the mother chapter of the Luna Brotherhood.<br />
<br />
Zylina’s father, Dave Nash was made the new alpha of the Seattle chapter. A task the man was having difficulty in fulfilling. After witnessing the brutal death of Alyssa Cooper when he was a Beta; Dave was able to use the recording of the event he secretly made to bring down the chapter. Rumored to be the one chapter that delved into hunting not just animals, but fellow were’s; Dave was tasked to root out those that allowed such cruel acts. Dave was floored that his brother in-law; the chapter alpha at the time, not only condoned the act but outright encouraged it. He lost his Twin sister the day he turned on the pack by send such information to Tachibana and to the other chapters.<br />
<br />
Zylina looked at her father; has he escorted the men out the door. Turning around to see her looking at him, Dave sighed as headed to the kitchen to grab a drink.<br />
“Zylina,” Dave looking in the fridge; “I thought I told you to wear your robe when company is over.”<br />
“I’m wearing it,” Zylina answering.<br />
“Yet it isn’t cinched up,” Dave answering; “I can see your womanly assets, even if they are covered in fur.”<br />
“So what did those three want again,” Zlynia rolling her eyes as she tied up her robe.<br />
“The same as before,” Dave grabbing a bottle of water; “an update as to the new members for the Seattle chapter.”<br />
“I take it,” Zylina speaking; “the Romanians are unfamiliar with a were-alert and all that?”<br />
“No,” Dave looking at his daughter; “they are aware of it and understand why it is currently in place. They want me to begin the recruitment drive tomorrow,” Dave sighed; “during the Labor Day picnic.”<br />
“Yet every single werewolf in town refuses to join,” Zylina looking at her father; “they branded you a pack betrayer.”<br />
“I’m not approaching the werewolves,” Dave knowing all about what he did; “I’m asking other were’s to join the organization.”<br />
<br />
Zylina choked on her drink as she looked stunned at her father.<br />
“The Romanian’s want the Luna Brotherhood to go back to its roots,” Dave sipping his water; “back when they first formed to protect the peasantry from the constant fighting going on in Wallachia between Prince Vlad and the Turks. No were was denied joining,” Dave speaking; brothers and sisters under the fur. That was the Luna Brotherhood’s original motto and mandate.”<br />
“So who you going to ask,” Zylina looking at her father.<br />
“All those who show up for the picnic tomorrow,” Dave speaking; “speaking of which, I want your help for this tomorrow, so I want you to head to bed soon.”<br />
“Does this mean I’m joining the Luna Brotherhood,” Zylina looking surprised.<br />
“We’ll see,” Dave placing a hand on his daughter’s furry head; “first you have school starting on Tuesday.”<br />
“And the pack I want to join,” Zylina adding; “they were going to meet tonight…”<br />
“Yet the were-alert,” Dave finishing; “prevented that from happening. Just be patient,” Dave stating; “they’ll call to let you know when they will gather.”<br />
<br />
Dave gives his daughter a kiss and watches as she bounds back upstairs; her reddish tail preventing the hem of her robe from hiding her furry form as it was up high and wagging happily.<br />
“No matter how old you get Zylina,” Dave sighing; “you’ll always be my little cub.”<br />
Shedding his clothes, Dave assumes his werewolf fursona; a typical grey wolf, but with sight auburn markings on his fur. Dave is a natural red head in his human from. He heads downstairs to the basement were his wife Janet lay waiting for him.</p>
