<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Smutty one indeed. </div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As soon as the sun peaks over the horizon, bathing the prehistoric world with its blessings of light and warmth that Jahff stirs awake. He was an early bird, evident when the part of him that was Jeff slept in.<br />
<br />
Well, it would benefit them both. Hunting when most herbivores come out to eat was the optimal moment after all. The red flower... the <i>fire</i>, as his brain helpfully tells him had gone out. The heat kept them both warm for the night and deterred most other predators. Of course, the sapients didn&#39;t really call the burning flower its human-given name, as most sapients didn&#39;t actually have many words to speak with yet.<br />
<br />
Jahff&#39;s vocabulary includes growls, hisses, and other primal utterances, but his memories revealed something interesting. The mutagenic dust that had upgraded half of the world&#39;s dinosaurs into sapients gave them a sort of psychic speech. He knew of the &quot;red flower&quot; because his previous mates depicted said fire. It was only then that he realizes he had been naturally growling, and hissing before, but it was heard to him as his own words. Sapient maws were still unable to speak, but the words he intends to speak to another sapient are heard as he wants to. With him simply growling &quot;We breed&quot; to his previous sapient mate, she obliged.<br />
<br />
The speech with ferals is still the same, utilizing body language and all the natural sounds he could make. It was why he could not understand the female feral. That would have meant that she hears him randomly uttering growls and hisses.<br />
<br />
<i>Stay Away</i>, or <i>Food</i>. It was easier for all creatures to communicate with intent, making communication between sapients and ferals possible. It had only been a hundred years, after all. <br />
<br />
Of course, all of this higher thinking was basically Jahff subconsciously using most of the advanced brain matter he shares with Jeff. Or rather, he <i>is</i> Jeff, but a version of him that had lived for 20 years in this world. <br />
<br />
Jahff stands up, gathers the ashes and charcoal in the pit, and lays it in the basket. The hot embers did nothing to his thick leathery palms as he put them above the ashes and cold carbon. He was hungry, but first, he had to finish what Jeff was too tired, and hesitant, to do so.<br />
<br />
He walks to the back of his mate, looking for her cloaca, with her still asleep from last night&#39;s ordeal. He didn&#39;t bother asking, she was his already. He bends down and releases his long tongue to lick at her entrance, lubing it and stirring her awake. When she stirs, he took the chance and stabs it into her womb. She growls but doesn&#39;t make any moves.<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>Good mate</i>&quot; he growls out, the intention clear despite her being unable to understand him, but the growls vibrated her entrance. Time to fully fertilize all of the eggs in her womb. It was common knowledge that sapient males couldn&#39;t really fertilize all the eggs in a feral mate from their smaller size if done quickly, while the opposite couldn&#39;t really be said. He once watched a feral male overfill a sapient female that most of her clutch came out feral.<br />
<br />
Jahff could taste his seed, unable to truly reach the deepest parts of her canal. His saliva coats her insides, and it was time. Rock hard, the muscular and virile alpha male tyrannosaurus sapient pulls out with a slurp, eliciting a whimper from his mate. <br />
<br />
There was no gentleness in his instincts, he needed to be far rougher to make sure he got fully stimulated and send his seed deeper into his mate. Pointed tip at first, a sort of gentleness from Jeff, he spears her lightly and slides in easily from the stimulation and lube. <br />
<br />
But the gentleness was immediately gone as his instinct flares and he was reduced to a beast of sex. <br />
<br />
Sexual Tyrannosaurus, his mind supplies him helpfully and he growls in agreement. Pistoning in and out, making sure he could fully enjoy it before he would have to finish was a habit he adopted over his life. Sapient males had been changed that their sperm factories needed stimulation to begin overproducing. Not to say they didn&#39;t cum a lot, but a short amount of stimulation could completely close the gap to even the amount produced by feral males.<br />
<br />
Jahff pants and growls and roars in short bursts as he felt his testicles bloat up with seed, slapping his growing balls to her taint with each thrust, pure apex predator cum that he would unload into his mate. Feeling his balls completely full that he felt it spurt out with each thrust was a signal that he should release, as with all sapient males. His feral mate was taking it all and groaning, growling in pleasure.<br />
<br />
Jahff feels his body jerk, roaring together in a symphony with his mate that he pistons in much harder than what Jeff did with hesitation, making sure his knot lodges into her cloaca that he became temporarily stuck, his cock plug making sure his seed doesn&#39;t escape. He bucks and pulls his mate with him as he cums, multiple times that his hungry and starved brain shut down and became feral for a moment. Jahff could feel his member pulse with his warm seed, pooling and tightening around his pulsing rod but unable to escape with the knot. <br />
<br />
Jahff pants and growls, feeling the last spurts of his seed empty out of his testicles that he stops to rest for a minute or two, feeling his knot quickly recede. He pulls out with a bit of his seed following, but he didn&#39;t mind. But for the next thing in the plan, he needs to make sure the prey couldn&#39;t smell them. She had closed her eyes and laid still, feeling the warm seed sloshing in her.<br />
<br />
He reaches down to her cloaca and cleans her. Licking and making sure that no more escapes, as the entrance tightens. As soon as he was done, he bends down past his muscular chest and abs and let his tongue reach down to stroke and clean his rapidly receding member. As soon as it was soft, he let the tip slip into his urethra to fully clean it. His mast bulges with the intrusion, but since it had to be done by every sapient, it was loose and manageable.<br />
<br />
As soon as he finishes scraping out what could have been dripping while he was hunting, Jahff starts to prepare. Part of him realizes the importance of the device and took it gently with him, climbing the tree he slept by and finding the highest point with sunlight and places it there. He climbs back down to see his mate watching at him with a sort of awe. Most ferals couldn&#39;t climb trees and had to bash them down.<br />
<br />
The first thing he does was craft a spear. The wooden stick his other half brought with him was thankfully workable, and soon he is holding a weapon fit for a hunter. He remembers the idea of a bow, but the thin and small arrows will never pierce the hide of the strong leather of the dinosaurs here. <br />
<br />
Jahff throws the spear after a second of calculating its trajectory, hitting the center of a tree a fair distance away. With his pure brute strength coupled with his intelligence, he could fully visualize the arc of the spear. His mate watches with interest, sitting beside him. He could no longer smell her fluids or his. Good.<br />
<br />
Taking the embers, he places the dangerous fruits over it and sees it melt into goo, the fruit that would have put even his feral kind to sleep. It was perfect. Dipping the spear fully into the goo, he lets it dry by smoking it over the embers instead of directly touching it.<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>Follow</i>&quot; he hisses. The body language of inviting with his hands and its intent was spoken to his mate, and she understands as she stands up. He growls at her &quot;<i>Hunt</i>&quot;<br />
<br />
Jahff walks to the tree with the device in its branches and pulls out his cock and began pissing. It was easier to track his scent than to memorize the specifics of every landmark. It smells musky, but it also warns him of thirst.<br />
<br />
He takes a fast jog at first, watching his mate keep up with him. It doesn&#39;t take long before he found a prey herbivore, stopping. <br />
<br />
As usual, he knows nothing based on names, but Jeff&#39;s memories tag it to be an edmontosaurus. It does not matter at all as he stops his mate from charging in or roaring, took aim, and throws with his full force. <br />
<br />
The squelching sound of spear piercing flesh and the roar of shock and pain was music to his ears, the thrill of the hunt has begun. Jahff roars and sprints towards the rapidly pacifying prey, his mate following not a moment later.<br />
<br />
The prey runs fast, but Jahff doesn&#39;t bother wasting energy trying to outrun it. He keeps pace at a distance to prevent possible revenge but knows that he needs to nab it first before other predators steal his prey from him.<br />
<br />
It doesn&#39;t take long for the edmontosaurus to slow down, and Jahff and his mate rush it down and bites its jugular into pieces.<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>Feed, lay claim!</i>&quot; he roars to all who wish to try and challenge them both. His mate growls, impressed by her mate, and was inwardly pleased having such a strong mate to breed with her every moment going forwards. The clutch she would lay in a few months would not be the last, and it was something she will make sure of. Jahff knew that any who hears him would flee in fear.<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
It doesn&#39;t take long for Jahff to suddenly yawn, feeling Jeff awaken. Jeff slots himself into Jahff as he swallows meat, and memories surge into his brain. Jahff had been too hungry to bother cooking the meat, and the prey has at least a fifth of the whole missing. He hopes it had been his mate- <br />
<br />
Jeff shakes his head. He hopes it had been the feral tyrannosaurus mate of Jahff that ate most of the portion. Jeff could feel the blood in his maw, the bloodlust and adrenaline making him feel pumped and bestial.<br />
<br />
&quot;I really hope there were no parasitesss in the meat...&quot; Jeff stands up to see her look at him in confusion, apparently not understanding what he said. <i>&quot;Oh, apparently I have a lissssp... in my mind too?!&quot;</i><br />
<br />
Jeff conks his head to try to fix it. No dice.<br />
<br />
His stomach growls in hunger. He was still hungry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright then, I&#39;m cooking this dinosssaur meat, and bassed on my camping experience and Jahff&#39;ss, I sshould be able to cook it...&quot; He doesn&#39;t notice his lisp gradually disappearing at all. He was getting used to it.<br />
<br />
Searching around procures him enough materials to start another campfire, and it was a matter of half an hour before he cooks the food. Cutting the meat into smaller pieces to cook was hard without a knife, which is something he would rectify soon, but he makes do by biting into the flesh and tearing out cookable pieces. What&#39;s the use of his greatest weapon if he doesn&#39;t use it in everyday life?<br />
<br />
Cooking it was a challenge, but the aroma and smell wafts. Jeff and the female drools, instincts awakening in them. Jeff wants nothing more than to lunge at the delicacy and eat it whole. But she couldn&#39;t help herself. Jahff took over as Jeff finds himself thinking as Jahff, wrestling down his mate and growling at her. <br />
<br />
She relents. Soon the meat cooks as Jahff ate a big piece and his mate ate another. The confusion in her eyes told him that she likes it, but could not decide to wait for the red flower to make meat hot or eat it raw.<br />
<br />
Jahff enjoys the meal until Jeff returns. <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Jeff was almost lost when Jahff lends a helping hand. He searches for his campsite by sight but soon learns to search it by smell. Instinct guides him to follow his musky scent until he finds the tree he rested under. Memory takes him to the top of the tree to gather the device and he hops down, tree trunk legs taking the impact.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, fully charged for a big change. I should make something to progress with the restoration, or I can make myself a shelter with water. Maybe I can have her become sapient like me...? It would be nice to have someone to speak to..&quot; He ponders what to do now with the device. &quot;But I changed myself into a raptor to live the animal life, and it got me into this trouble, it was worth it though. Mating with her was rough and crazy that I love being Jahff.&quot;</p>
