<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>I know the first chapter was in first person, from Christina&#39;s POV, but since that chapter was authored by our &quot;main character,&quot; I feel like it makes sense here that a different author would use a different POV.  </div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Christina posted her chapter, then switched over to a different tab.  She knew it would take a while for a reply to show up, if anyone added something at all, so she&#39;d find something else to do in the meantime.  And cat videos on youtube always made for a fun time.<br />
<br />
After watching a couple clips of cats with surprisingly deep meows, Christina saw something a little unusual in her recommended video feed: the thumbnail had the words &quot;Get Catty&quot; in bold white letters over a blue spiral background.  The title read &quot;Hypnotize yourself to be a cat furry - REALLY WORKS!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Christina&#39;s first thought was to just ignore the obvious clickbait and move on to the &quot;cutest derpcats&quot; video below it.  But she paused.  This video seemed kinda appealing to her newly-awakened TF fetish (even if she wasn&#39;t sure she was into furries specifically, yet).  Maybe it&#39;d contain a detailed description of what it would feel like to be turned into a cat? Plus, she had some time to kill, anyway.  She clicked the video.<br />
<br />
An image of a spinning navy blue spiral appeared in front of her, and a male voice played over her speakers.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Start by taking a slow, deep breath in.  Hold it for a few seconds.  Then slowly let it out again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Christina followed the instructions, feeling a little more relaxed, her eyes drawn toward the center of the spiral.  It seemed calming.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just keep breathing slowly and deeply, to relax as you listen.  Hypnosis is such a simple thing.  Many people think it&#39;s more complex than it really is; that you must go so deep that you can&#39;t consciously recall a thing when it&#39;s done, that it&#39;ll feel like a different state from normal.  The truth is, it&#39;s as simple as sleep.  All you need to do is relax, and listen to my words.<br />
<br />
&quot;That being said, even if it doesn&#39;t &#39;feel&#39; like you&#39;re &#39;really&#39; being hypnotized, acting and imagining like you&#39;re under control, like you&#39;re being relaxed, like you&#39;re being changed, and going so deep, can help make it so.  Everything in life is practiced by pretending, at first, after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Christina nodded along, continuing to take deep breaths.  It seemed pretty sensible to her.  If she wanted to find out what it was like to change, it couldn&#39;t hurt to imagine it, in as much detail as possible, right?<br />
<br />
&quot;You can never be made to do something you don&#39;t want to do while in trance.  You clicked on this video knowing what it would do to you, meaning that either you wanted to become a cat anthro, wanted to experience some kind of change or you were curious if hypnosis worked at all, and wanted to test it with the most ridiculous claim you could try.  By listening to my words and relaxing, you&#39;re helping yourself get what you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
Christina nodded.  She did want to experience a change, after all.<br />
<br />
 For the next several minutes, the voice gently suggested various relaxation techniques, which Christina followed diligently.  The voice then proceeded to a countdown, before it finally got to the real show.<br />
<br />
&quot;And now that you&#39;re nice and deep and relaxed, you can find the place where your subconscious reigns, free to do what you wouldn&#39;t consciously admit you desire.  Imagine the feeling of soft fur slowly growing out of your back, and feel it become real.&quot;<br />
<br />
Christina blankly nodded, feeling fur poking through her skin in thick, soft patches on her back, growing larger and spreading out to cover it completely.<br />
<br />
&quot;Feel that fur spread around, covering your whole torso, feeling so warm, and comfortable, just like you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
The fur continued to sprout around her body, with a slight itch as it rose, then a tingling sensation as she slowly got used to it, then a smooth, comfortable feeling.<br />
<br />
&quot;As the fur travels down your arms and legs, feel them not only grow warmer and softer, but feel the muscle underneath become more lithe and flexible.  Feel your hands and feet swelling up on the palms and soles to grow little pads, and the bones in your fingers poking out as retractable claws.&quot;<br />
<br />
Christina stretched, her claws pointing out of her fingers and toes, as a puffy feeling piled up in her palms, and toe- and finger-tips, not letting her eyes off the spiral for a second.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now all that fur can&#39;t be comfortable with all those clothes, can it?&quot;  The voice continued.  &quot;It chafes and gets caught. it makes you too hot.  And have you ever seen a cat wearing clothes?  No.  You deserve to feel comfortable.  You want to feel comfortable, you need to feel comfortable.&quot;<br />
<br />
Christina wanted to feel comfortable.  She deserved it.  The fur got caught in her clothes.<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s no need to feel ashamed of your body.  There&#39;s no need to cover up.  Your fur is beautiful.  This is how you were intended to live in nature.  There&#39;s nothing wrong with it.  It just makes sense to get up, and take off every piece of clothing, right now, then sit back down, and keep watching.&quot;<br />
<br />
Christina wondered why she&#39;d even bothered to put on clothes at all.  They were so uncomfortable.  Her fur was beautiful.  She was born naked, it was natural, and there was nothing wrong with it.  As the video went quiet for a few moments, she got up, hastily pulled off each piece of clothing she had, tossed them aside without even paying attention to where they landed, and quickly got back into her chair to keep listening to that powerful, relaxing voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;That feels much better, doesn&#39;t it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Christina nodded.  It felt much better.<br />
<br />
&quot;When you&#39;re like this, you wouldn&#39;t want to wear clothes unless you really had to, would you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Christina shook her head.  Why would she want to wear clothes over fur unless it was for safety, or some kind of requirement?  She couldn&#39;t imagine why she&#39;d put them on while she was locked down in her own house.  She was so glad this voice had pointed out how silly that was.  She felt naturally comfortable like this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now that your clothing is no longer holding it back, feel your tail stretching out behind you, raised up straight in contentment as a cat&#39;s tail does.  Feel your spine growing and stretching, what&#39;s already there becoming more nimble and flexible.&quot;<br />
<br />
She stretched again, her back bending more easily, while new flesh and bone, already covered in a layer of soft, grey fur grew steadily ube hind her, swaying slightly as her body slowly adjusted to the new appendage, before straightening out calm and steady.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now feel the fur spreading over your face as your head changes, your senses of hearing and smell becoming more acute as your ears and nose become those of a cat.  Feel your teeth sharpen, and your tongue grow rougher, and picture your eyes becoming the cunning green eyes of a cat.&quot;<br />
<br />
The sounds of her computer&#39;s fan grew louder, as did the sounds of the AC, and the birdsong outside, as Christina&#39;s ears grew longer and larger, taking a triangular shape as they moved up her head.  Her face twitched as her jaws stretched forward slightly, teeth aching for a second as they grew sharper.  Her nose shrank, and took a triangular shape at the end of her snout, a little up-side-down pink triangle in the center of a grey face.  Her hair turned the same grey color as her fur, but kept its length.  Finally her blue eyes shifted to a bright green, while her pupils narrowed in the bright daylight.<br />
<br />
&quot;There you go, good kitty.&quot;<br />
<br />
Christina smiled.  She was a good kitty.<br />
<br />
&quot;It feels nice to finally be the cat you wanted to be, doesn&#39;t it?&quot;<br />
<br />
It felt nice to be a cat.  She&#39;d wanted to be one.<br />
<br />
&quot;In a few moments, I&#39;m going to wake you.  But first, I have a few special instructions for you, that I think you&#39;re going to love...  Listen closely...&quot;<br />
<br />
Christina listened closely.  <br />
<br />
Then her mind went utterly blank.<br />
<br />
A few moments later she became vaguely conscious again.  The voice was in the middle of talking.<br />
<br />
&quot;...And while you will have no conscious memory of that command, your subconscious will remember it perfectly.  And when you follow that instruction, even without knowing you&#39;re doing it, you&#39;ll just feel so wonderful; better than you can ever remember feeling before.  And after I wake you, remember to like, subscribe if you haven&#39;t already, and leave a comment telling me you are a good kitty.  Now wake up slowly on the count of five...  One... two... three... four... five!&quot;  There was a sound of snapping fingers.  &quot;Wake up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Christina stretched, blinked, and shook her head, amazed anything could make her feel so comfortable and relaxed.  With barely even a thought, she&#39;d clicked the like and subscribe buttons, and quickly scrolled down to the comments section.  The hypnosis hadn&#39;t REALLY gotten to her, she thought, but she still wanted to play along.  She smiled as she typed in &quot;I&#39;m a good kitty!&quot; AThere were already a dozen other comments with similar messages.<br />
<br />
Her ears perked up once she&#39;d posted, hearing the AC switching off automatically.  It drew her eyes away from the screen, toward the clothes she&#39;d tossed to the floor.  Ugh, she hated the idea of putting those back on.  While she was in the house, they could just stay in the drawers.<br />
<br />
She looked down, and suddenly realized, she could see a bit of her snout in front of her!  Quickly looking down over her body, she saw she was covered in grew fur!  Her feet looked more like paws!  Her tail swished tensely, reminding her she suddenly had one!  She hadn&#39;t been imagining it all!  Or was she still imagining it?<br />
<br />
Then she paused.  She&#39;d posted on CYOC because she&#39;d wanted to be changed, hadn&#39;t she?  She&#39;d watched the video for the same reason.  She&#39;d gotten what she wanted.  And her new form was naturally beautiful.  There was no need to panic.  This was natural.  This was comfortable.  This was what she wanted.<br />
<br />
She felt her body vibrating as she purred.<br />
<br />
Yes, she saw no reason not to stay like this.<br />
<br />
...Or maybe not completely &#39;like this.&#39;  The animal form was nice, but she realized she wouldn&#39;t mind maybe adding another change or two to the package.  She turned back to the computer, and clicked on the &quot;TF-notist&#39;s&quot; channel.<br />
<br />
She was greeted with a bunch of playlists.  One for dozens of animals, another for other types of anthros (Though she was VERY comfortable with her current species, so those were off the table for now), some for various body modifications, some for mental alterations, some to turn the viewer into various inanimate objects, robots, living toys, or more.<br />
<br />
She felt a powerful urge to click one of them, and submit to that calming, powerful, relaxing, all-deciding voice once more.</p>
