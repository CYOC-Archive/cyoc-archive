<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Computer class was in the seemingly forgotten corner of the school.  It was dim do only having one window that let in very little sun.  Good for working at a screen free of reflections but poor for a student's eye sight.  Right now, with huge basketballs hanging off her chest, Jennifer was happy to have any help in hiding.<br />
<br />
The room was set up in rows of computer desks facing an overhead projecting screen at one end.  Each desk contained five computer terminals that normally would have a student in front of, squinting at low resolutions and awkwardly typing at a keyboard.  Today, Jennifer was relieved to find that most of the seat were vacant.  Mrs. Stein had not been exaggerating about the number of students skipping today.<br />
<br />
Jennifer strode quickly to a seat at the back close to a wall and as far from the door and anyone else as she could.  If she made herself unnoticeable in the back she might be alright.  A few eyes from the few guys in the room followed her as walked but they all seemed to go back to their work.  Jennifer was doing her best to hide her bare breasts and she hoped the porn they were looking at on the internet while the teacher took his time to get to class was more interesting than the local school hottie.  For the first time in her life Jennifer found herself wishing she was not quite so hot.<br />
<br />
In her seat, she logged on to the computer system and then onto the internet.  Perhaps she could find something that would help her out with this curse.  She thought about finding the little bastard that had done this to her but thought better of it.  That would be exactly what he wanted, she thought.  Further more, while she held possession of the curse's power she was safe from being stuck, unable to stop the changes to her body.  What she needed was either a loop hole or someone in whom she could trust not to take advantage of her.  That would be difficult she mused, looking down at her exposed breasts; they hung there so unnaturally firm orange.<br />
<br />
But perhaps not as difficult as trying to type around them.  The shear size and inflexibility of her new breasts took some getting used to.  She thought about turning to the side and typing with only one hand but in the narrow row this was far to cumbersome.  They were too big to reach around to the keyboard so she had to come at it from underneath.  That resulted in her having to either let her breasts rest on her fore-arms while she typed or arch her back and shoulders enough to lift them above.  The later was uncomfortable and the former left her breasts to be dribbled a little by her bouncing wrists.<br />
<br />
The teacher arrived late as usual.  He counted the number of heads in the room and took attendance.  He made some comment about just woking on projects that they had been doing for the past week and then left to get some coffee.  The class was behaved enough to get by for a few minutes without him.  Or for most of the period as it would turn out.<br />
<br />
Around her, Jennifer could hear the general hum of cooling fans and low voices and the students went about their ways of avoiding school work on the useless Friday.  She searched for information about the Town Curse but found little.  There were a few sites that seemed to document some of the effects that the curse had done but much of it seemed fake to her.  Even knowing that the curse was real she could not trust that what she read was genuine.  As she sat and thought and read, the minutes ticked by and the room became a little warmer.  The stuffiness of the air was starting to put Jennifer into a bit of daze.  She thought about taking a nap.  That would turn her back to normal as per Kyle's transformation.  That would be nice she thought but then how would she get her sweater back on if she was asleep?  She had better stay awake she concluded.<br />
<br />
Gosh, it's hot in here, she thought.<br />
<br />
The room's fan had come on and it was blowing air through the vents making a loud noise.  One of the boys in the front of the room pulled a hoodie over his head and shouted a little too loudly, &quot;Why, do they keep it so friggin' cold in this room?&quot;<br />
<br />
That's right, Jennifer thought.  This room is always ten degrees colder than the rest of the school.  She normally had to bring a jacket along to class, even in the heat of late spring.  She usually left this room shivering from the cold.  She had complained to the teacher many times about being unable to type her fingers were so cold.  He had just said it was better for the computers.  So why was she so warm right now?<br />
<br />
She was sweating.  Looking herself over she could feel little beads of moisture forming on her arms and down her back.  Her breasts were even starting to look slick and flush from the heat.  Jennifer soon noted the rubbery orange texture of her basketballs was fading and her normal skin tone returning slowly.  What's going on, she thought, pinching herself to make sure she had not nodded off and was just dreaming.  She wasn't asleep so why was she changing?<br />
<br />
It hit her all of a sudden: the teacher was out of the room.  Internet porn.  In a classroom full of sex starved boys with free access to fast internet and no adult supervision there was only one thing that they were doing right now.  Jennifer had walked right into the perfect storm of sexual imagery.  The magic of the curse was drawing from several unfocused minds at once causing her to become a heat sink for their fantasies.  And there was little she could do to stop it.<br />
<br />
Jennifer was about to run out of the room when her whole body sudden flushed with heat.  The curse had built up enough to take effect at this moment and she found her body weak and unresponsive.  She could not run right now she would have to wait out the class.  Then the changes started.</p>
