<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">'Marriage contract?' Lord Jeremy and Lady Leticia looked at each other in blank confusion <br />
before they remembered that little known fact about human culture. During all this time, <br />
among all the drama, and the abstract fear of one day leaving the park after Lady Leticia's <br />
fawn was born, the 'practical aspect' of marriage had never once even crossed their deer <br />
brains. Such formalities such as written agreements just didn't exist in the park, and they <br />
didn't exist among their unevolved non-sentient cousins either! <br />
<br />
But at the same time, the human culture part of Jeremy's brain, knew that it was needed. <br />
Had to be needed. When his offspring had to leave this tiny place and face the infinite <br />
world of humanity beyond, Jeremy wouldn't have any fawn of his declared an illegitimate <br />
child. Lord Jeremy did wonder, was it because of his bringing up human culture that made <br />
him able to care for wanting this for his children to come, or was it that deer were social <br />
creatures that enable him to still care about it. The predators like Jackie and Keith, would <br />
they care when their kittens were born? <br />
<br />
Still, Jeremy realized he wanted to be acknowledged, he had been acknowledged by his <br />
father, he had been acknowledged by his frat brothers, and his union with Leticia would be <br />
acknowledged by the monkeys. Just a position among fellow guests at a vacation park or <br />
not, something the park could take away from him in a moment's notice or not, he -was- <br />
Lord of the herd here, and he would have the ties to his wife respected. <br />
<br />
&quot;Drake.&quot; Jeremy said calmly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Boss-Man?&quot; His loyal shadow replied. <br />
<br />
 &quot;You're in charge until I get back, make sure all the fights are in good sportsmanship, and <br />
no one gangs up on Marth.&quot; No matter what his opinion on Marth, Marth was now part of <br />
the herd, and under Jeremy's protection the same as any other member. <br />
<br />
&quot;Er, actually,&quot; The other husky, who looked just like the other one, &quot;Your bride's maid and <br />
Best Man are required as witnesses Lord Jeremy.&quot; The husky said politely. <br />
<br />
Lord Jeremy moaned, of all the complications he could face, why these? Would the rest of <br />
the herd look down or even dismiss Jeremy as well as Drake if they didn't defend their <br />
positions from Mark? Assuming Mark made it that far up the ladder of course, but there <br />
was always that possibility. <br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot; Jeremy said calmly. <br />
<br />
The twins looked at each other distraught. Before being employed by the part, the their <br />
friends and family had often commented on how different the two were in spite of their <br />
status as twins. One like sunrises, the other liked sunsets, one liked rainy days, the other <br />
sunny, one liked country music, the other classic, one like platform games, the other <br />
strategy. <br />
<br />
Since coming to the park however, they had grown increasingly in sync with each other, <br />
even more so then their fellow pack mates. They had also by default always been paired <br />
together by Naomi when given assignments and didn't have the nerve to argue with her. <br />
Originally they detested it when people mistook them for each other, but recently they had <br />
found amusement or even calm acceptance in it. Sometimes never bothering to correct <br />
mistakes when people identified them, after all, the other was often right there besides <br />
them and got the information anyway, and in general, they were mostly regularly referred <br />
to only as 'the twins.' <br />
<br />
This was actually due to their behavior becoming increasingly parallel as time had gone <br />
on, and thus their pack members wanting to be polite referred to the two identical huskies <br />
as 'the twins' to prevent accidently getting their names wrong. By this time, speaking for <br />
each other and finishing each other's statements had become first nature to them. The <br />
running gag had become the twins were really one husky that happened to have two <br />
bodies. <br />
<br />
The clincher had been when one of the twins the other day had sign some paper work <br />
using -both- their names without a second thought and without protest from the other. <br />
<br />
Now, just -looking- at each other, the twins spokes volumes between themselves. And <br />
they knew, that if they failed to bring the Lord and Lady of the herd to their pack leader <br />
when Naomi had commanded them to, Naomi would be certain to make them never forget <br />
that failure! Naomi was never happy when a pack member didn't live up to her <br />
expectations. The Management might have held the power, but Naomi was the face that <br />
inspired both love and fear among the huskies. <br />
<br />
&quot;Please!&quot; They implored together.<br />
<br />
&quot;I said no.&quot; Jeremy repeatedly calmly and the horned buck started to turn away from them. <br />
<br />
The twins looked at each other again, silently discussing the vices and virtues of being <br />
more insistent. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dearie,&quot; Lady Leticia interrupted reminding everyone she was there, &quot;It's all right. We can <br />
go right now. I'm not worried.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Honey,&quot; Jeremy said, &quot;What if Marth makes it all the way to the top and I'm not here to <br />
defend my position? What if Drake isn't? It would... it would be -wrong!-&quot; <br />
<br />
Drake, felt a pang of happiness to know Jeremy cared for Drake's position in the herd. <br />
Ironically perhaps the first person who cared about a position the corporate shark had and <br />
didn't want to topple him from it. <br />
<br />
Lady Leticia smiled at her husband, &quot;Then we had better make sure that doesn't happen <br />
right? Shouldn't Marth have a short rest between each fight so it's not really the last buck <br />
who fought him who defeats him but it's the next one who trounces him?&quot; <br />
<br />
Lord Jeremy stared at his wife in amazement. Perhaps, there was time to make all parties <br />
happy, Lord Jeremy didn't really care what the huskies wanted as long as the herd was safe <br />
and happy, but apparently Lady Leticia wanted everyone involved to have what they <br />
needed. If it -was- just a marriage contract, they should have no trouble with it. And if it <br />
was more, then Jeremy's original action would stand. <br />
<br />
&quot;Lateisha!&quot; Lord Jeremy called out in a powerful voice that echoed across the reception <br />
party. Lateisha came running before she even realized what she was doing. She quickly <br />
stood at attention in front of him and bowed, &quot;Yes Mi'lord?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;The huskies say they've prepared a 'marriage contract' for myself and your Lady, you and <br />
Drake as Maid of Honor and Best Man, are to act as witnesses.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about Marth's placement in the herd Mi'lord?&quot; Lateisha heard herself asking. <br />
<br />
&quot;We will be back in time for it.&quot; Lord Jeremy said, and it was so.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Mi'lord.&quot; Lateisha bowed again. This would, in all likelihood and possibilities be the <br />
last thing she ever did for her Herd Leaders or the herd itself as a doe or a deer. <br />
<br />
Lateisha looked back at John, and gave him an appraising smirk, &quot;Don't go losing to the <br />
new guy kiddo.&quot; She said smiling. <br />
<br />
John dumbly nodded. <br />
<br />
Leticia surprised everyone again by calling out in a authoritative voice no one remembered <br />
her having before. &quot;Hannah! Come!&quot; <br />
<br />
Reluctant, but no less quickly than Lateisha, Hannah came running, bowing quickly, &quot;Yes <br />
Mi'Lady?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;It's time for Marth to find his place in the herd for the remainder of his stay in the park. <br />
Move the battles to the Arena. There, as a doe, you will act as judge, as all is tradition.&quot; <br />
<br />
Hannah's mind reeled a bit at Leticia's tone and words. 'Tradition? Heh. Yes. Tradition. <br />
We've been creating patterns for ourselves all this time. And now the time has come to <br />
follow them. And it is as my herd leader command.' <br />
<br />
&quot;As you command Mi'Lady.&quot; Hannah bowed. <br />
<br />
Leticia looked satisfied as Hannah conveyed the herd leader's commands to the bucks, <br />
who also realized that indeed, it was tradition, and more fitting. <br />
<br />
After quickly explaining things to their families, Lady Jeremy and Lady Leticia were <br />
following the twin huskies. The remainder staying near and around the bucks, determined <br />
to make sure the near disaster with Spike did not happen again. <br />
<br />
The bucks herded to the clearing that had been formally declared the Arena during the <br />
tournament, Marth staying at the center with no chance to escape even if he had wanted <br />
to. Hannah following behind. <br />
<br />
Marth felt odd around the bucks, not excited or alarmed as Maria would have been, and he <br />
didn't feel the disgust or revulsion when surrounded several naked members of the same <br />
gender as before. All he felt, was the single mighty desire to see each and every one of <br />
them eating dirt. <br />
<br />
The mass of bucks formed their circle with Marth at the center. And Hannah, looked at the <br />
rock throne that both she had Leticia had sat in during the tournament. So much had <br />
changed since this, it was mind boggling trying to keep track of it all. <br />
<br />
Beauty Queen Hannah calmly sat down in the throne, looking at the circle of bucks and <br />
Marth himself. <br />
<br />
&quot;Just give us your word Beauty Queen Hannah.&quot; One of the bucks said respectfully. <br />
<br />
Beauty Queen Hannah nodded calmly. Ironically, if she hadn't fled this throne when she did <br />
during the tournament, would she be herd leader now along with Jeremy? Or would the <br />
gang rape that Lateisha had warned her of come to pass? Didn't matter anymore. <br />
<br />
Beauty Queen Hannah spoke, &quot;Begin.&quot; And so it did.  <br />
<br />
+++++<br />
<br />
With more courage then Keith thought he had, he approached the new male bear in the <br />
park, who was staying near Predator Hill because his son was, and many of the evolved <br />
bears were mostly wanders anyway and no true territory to return to.  <br />
<br />
&quot;You're Chris' father?&quot; Keith asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;I am.&quot; The large burly bear said innocently, &quot;Is something wrong him? Has he start picking <br />
flowers and can't stop talking?&quot; <br />
<br />
Keith kept his self control, &quot;Myself and my mate are not Chris' parents, we have no right to <br />
say how he's raised, but like it or not, you -are- his father, and you're the person he's <br />
supposed to look up to during the hard times.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hard times are meant to be toughened up alone, builds character.&quot; The burly bear said <br />
misquoting someone famous he couldn't remember the name of. <br />
<br />
Keith unsheathed his claws but pulled them back in. &quot;I'm only going to say this part once, <br />
so pay attention- get your act together!!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Wha-?&quot; The much larger bear stared clueless. Keith had to look up to him to talk to him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Chris has suffered repeatedly because you've told him being female is a CURSE! That it <br />
somehow makes you automatically unable to defend yourself! It's men like you that made <br />
me detest this gender!&quot; Keith head swam... it had been.... forever since he had thought <br />
about his life as that fifty year old woman. And he couldn't remember the last time he had <br />
thought about her negative attitude towards men. <br />
<br />
&quot;What are you saying?&quot; The bear asked confused. <br />
<br />
&quot;I used to be a woman, and I spent most of my life being given the lower end of the stick <br />
by men. I chose this gender for the sake of power when I changed, it was because of all <br />
my friends that I realized that this gender didn't automatically make me evil. It was <br />
because of Jackie I realized I could never go back to being that woman, I loved her too <br />
much, it would feel like death.&quot; <br />
<br />
The bear shook his head to get his thoughts straight, &quot;Well, congratulations on <br />
upgrading.&quot; The bear said unwittingly using exactly the same terminology that Naomi used <br />
for men who became women. &quot;But what does this have to do with my son?&quot; <br />
<br />
Keith glared, &quot;The point IS: that you need to be there for him. Myself and Jackie are the <br />
ones who are being there for him though! He almost accidently KILLED someone this <br />
afternoon because of how scared he is of losing himself to his new body!&quot; The bear <br />
stiffened at this.  &quot;And you didn't even know that! You're too busy getting rejected by <br />
every female bear in the park!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I... I just want to find... a new mother for him... someone who can be the mother for him I <br />
can't be.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Which is NEVER going to happen you selfish middle aged man, as long as you continue to <br />
treat women like they're duel baby factories and live in nanny maids! They don't exist just <br />
to lift you, US men up on their shoulders. We're supposed to be partners in this life. I'm <br />
NOT better because I lost my chest and gained something between my legs! I'm better <br />
because I now have someone to walk this life with me!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Chris... nearly killed someone?&quot; The bear stammered. <br />
<br />
&quot;YES! He did! And he's a good kid, I don't know if that was his mother's doing or <br />
something you somehow managed to do right, but that would have destroyed him, utterly. <br />
And you would have been oblivious to it all. You don't care what happens to him, as long <br />
as he act macho and can beat anyone he comes across in hand to hand combat! Preening <br />
him up to be your little karate star! Well you need to realize he needs more than just a <br />
karate instructor for traits from his father!&quot; <br />
<br />
The bear was dead silent for over a minute... standing straight up, staring straight ahead, <br />
an almost glassy look in his eyes, &quot;I think... I need to go somewhere... good-bye.&quot; Like a <br />
robot, the giant bear turned on paw heel, and trotted away. <br />
<br />
Keith only stood there, wondering exactly what he had just set into motion, and where it <br />
was all going to arrive at. <br />
<br />
++++<br />
<br />
The only husky still at Predator Hill, with Harry apparently using his own judgment and <br />
stayed near the deer mini-tournament, Zack observed Chris the panther's father wander <br />
off with the glazed look in the bear's eyes. <br />
<br />
Barking to HQ, he flagged the bear as a possible problem, though what kind Zack couldn't <br />
even begin to guess at, but he feared something self destructive. Being told to stay at his <br />
post, the hidden husky settled to observe events playing with Chris herself and their <br />
priority one panther woman carrying her ultra important cargo. <br />
<br />
The Blue Vixen Chris reluctantly woke up from her nap, her video games dreams having <br />
run their course for the time being. She stretched out her fantasy like figure that she'd <br />
lose rather quickly with access to modern day junk and fast food. Of course the vixen <br />
Chris didn't think of any of these common sense realities, she had herself molded into an <br />
ideal, and in her mind, nothing could spoil that ideal. <br />
<br />
Chris saw that during her power nap, a good deal of the fox tribe had already beaten it <br />
back to their burrows. <br />
<br />
Chris walked over to the new panther girl who shared her name, who was being comforted <br />
by the new best friend of Hannah. Chris remembered her own time with Hannah, realizing <br />
some of the more sublime points of being female, and how not to walking without silently <br />
screaming 'I'm all yours' to anyone who saw her. <br />
<br />
Chris noticed that the panther girl was crying. Chris felt concern. After all, the panther girl <br />
had been the first person to seriously talk to her outside of her video fanatics group (who <br />
cursed themselves for not thinking of her idea involving hedgehogs and bandicoots when <br />
they had the chance). True, Chris didn't understand the panther girl's fixation with <br />
breaking concrete blocks with your head, but the panther didn't understand Chris' fixation <br />
of manipulating pixels on a screen to experience a story, so maybe they were even. Chris <br />
and Chris, Chris knew she just HAD to have her name legally changed to that of her <br />
character, it was going to get confusing otherwise. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, you okay?&quot; Chris asked.<br />
<br />
The pregnant panther woman, Jackie, looked at the blue vixen, &quot;I just finished explaining <br />
to Chris what happens to ladies every month.&quot;  Jackie shuddered as she recalled her own <br />
panicked filled and confused first period. <br />
<br />
Chris Vixen was throw off kilter by that bit of information, thankfully, she had already <br />
experienced the blind panic and terror stricken confusion of her monthly cycle before this. <br />
So Jackie didn't have two TGed anthros on her hands that were going to be crying their <br />
eyes out. <br />
<br />
Chris' video game side then took over, &quot;If it's that awful, maybe you can force the park to <br />
make you a brown furry fox sage instead.&quot; She grinned. Her friend who had originally <br />
wanted to assume that rule had been unable to enter the park.<br />
<br />
Chris panther said cooly and matter of fact, her tear drying slightly, &quot;Go, to Hell.&quot; <br />
<br />
The vixen took a couple steps back and raised her arms defensively, &quot;Okay okay! I was <br />
only joking! Sheesh!&quot; A lie. But one for the greater peace. <br />
<br />
Jackie looked at the blue vixen, if this was an anime, she'd peg the blue vixen for the <br />
obnoxious red head or American who'd get broken or killed before the final episode. As it <br />
was though, she just said, &quot;Chris, could you give Chris a little room?&quot; Ugh. They were <br />
going to have to verbally separate these two somehow. <br />
<br />
Vixen Chris took another step back but said, &quot;I was only trying to help.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You need to try differently.&quot; Jackie explained. <br />
<br />
The blue vixen sat down on the grass of Predator Hill. While many predators were <br />
nocturnal, most of the hyper evolved animals had a human day/night sleep cycle. The blue <br />
vixen idly wondered why that was, one of the few bits of wondering she had actually done <br />
about the park. The park existed, she existed, as did her fellow game fanatics and the <br />
other guests, and the world of humanity lay outside those closed in fences. That was <br />
enough for Chris. She believed in enjoying things not questioning them. But in a moment <br />
of idle curiosity, she figured the only real reason would be if they were to properly <br />
function in human society better. Implying that the part -wanted- people to keep their <br />
forms after leaving the park. Meh, worked out better for Chris anyway that way anyway. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don't you have to get back to your group's territory?&quot; Jackie asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Naw, I can wait.&quot; Vixen Chris said. &quot;If there's one thing you get a lot of in this park, it's <br />
time.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I don't see how you all stand it.&quot; Said the younger panther girl distantly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry about it,&quot; Said the vixen, &quot;It'll kick in sooner than later. Then you''ll realize <br />
this place is anything but boring.&quot; <br />
<br />
The panther Chris sighed, &quot;I'm starting to wonder which I can trust less, the girl, or the <br />
panther.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jackie said, &quot;I know this might sound strange coming from me Chris, but you're still you. <br />
And that only changes if you let it.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I... I need to go for a walk... I'll be back in a bit.&quot; The panther girl Chris said tears still on <br />
her face as she walk away from the her fellow ex-males. <br />
<br />
The female panther looked at the other Chris, &quot;If you're really his friend you'd better follow <br />
him.&quot; It didn't sound like a request. <br />
<br />
The vixen gulped and nodded and followed at what she could assume was a safe distance. <br />
<br />
+++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for your time Father,&quot; Su Yin bowed respectfully. Though a small part of her <br />
wanted to flee before her perfectly scientific view of the universe imploded on itself with <br />
only a few more kind words from the short raccoon. The worst part was, Father Tyminski <br />
wasn't the least bit adversarial about anything they discussed, he respected Su Yin's point <br />
of view, and calmly presented his own! Which was more than Su Yin could say about some <br />
of her colleagues in some of her scientific debates (she having adopted the unpopular <br />
position that Pluto indeed did not deserve to be called a full fledged planet).  <br />
<br />
&quot;You're welcome child, it was a pleasure to speak with you.&quot; The raccoon priest replied <br />
kindly. &quot;Today was perhaps the most interesting wedding I've ever proceeded over.&quot;<br />
<br />
The raccoon and doe nodded, and went their separate ways, Father Tyminski to fish, Prof. <br />
Su Yin to observe the battles about to begin in the arena (she could smell them about to <br />
begin). <br />
<br />
+++++<br />
<br />
&quot;So how was the newbie Naomi dumped on you?&quot; Harry asked, settling next to Katie to <br />
observe the battles to come, taking polite note of Su Yin's arrival. <br />
<br />
Katie said, &quot;She's almost like a -cat- with that curiosity.&quot;  Both huskies shuddered as if that <br />
was incredibly bad thing. &quot;But she's eager to please, that's for sure, and she sure gave it all <br />
her all today. I think she just wanted to show me AND Naomi that she was competent and <br />
not a burden to everyone.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Think she's going to be a good addition to the pack then?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Without a doubt.&quot; Katie said firmly, &quot;I just wonder if she's going to get her own room, or <br />
bunking with one of us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like you if the latter, after all, Naomi gave her -you- to look after, after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, yeah, I figured. Guess I'll be visiting your room from now on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You have no idea how long I've waited to hear those words. So what do you think of this <br />
after wedding show?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Inevitable I guess. Though given past experience we're going to be facing a few surprises <br />
in one shape or another.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;And there's one now,&quot; Harry pointed, &quot;The wolf pack had apparently shown up to observe <br />
the show, enjoying the idea of seeing a couple more bucks bang heads into each other <br />
again. The wolves had wits enough to stay out of the direct line of sight and smell range <br />
from the deer to prevent a distraction or being asked to leave. The wolves were an <br />
interesting lot, they had been the most stable group in the part since the very beginning, <br />
assimilation of new guests into the pack handled so easily that the huskies didn't even <br />
observe them personally anymore. <br />
<br />
The only true bit of abrasion they really had with anyone was the fox tribe. Like Pepsi and <br />
Coke, Cats and Dogs, Captain Kirk and Jean-Luc Picard, Sonic and Mario, the desire to <br />
prove which species of wild dog was the better was a never ending struggle with no true <br />
ending that could ever be achieved. Thankfully it had never resulted in blood shed in the <br />
park, so the huskies again let the wolves and foxes happily insult each other and generally <br />
compete with the other. Thankfully with the majority of the foxes have returned to their <br />
burrows for the night, that was one less problem the huskies had to worry about. <br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
Leading the Lord and Lady of the herd through the park to the designated spot with little <br />
or no chatter along with their subordinates, the huskies said nothing when they came to <br />
the empty spot. Huskies didn't sweat except on their noses, so Lord Jeremy and Lady <br />
Leticia noticed nothing looking at the twins' backsides. <br />
<br />
The twins looked at each other. Naomi was not here. The pens and practice paper were <br />
still here, miracle beyond all miracles not stolen by guests who'd see such items as mana <br />
from heaven! This wasn't good! Not good at all! Naomi had the contact! Shuddering <br />
slightly the huskies turned on their heels at the same time, and said together at the park <br />
Lord and Lady, &quot;Please practice your signature with your new hands while one of us fetches <br />
the contracts for the two of you.&quot; <br />
<br />
Shuddering more, and seemingly indecisively, one of the twins, the one on deer's right, <br />
haltingly took some steps away from her sister, then began to run like the wind before <br />
vanishing from their sight. <br />
<br />
It had felt like they were in molasses when they moved apart from each other, like a piece <br />
of their own body was being pulled away from them. For the first time in many months, <br />
the twins, were not together. It was disorienting. <br />
<br />
Both twins as one remained with the deer and the other ran for the entrance building <br />
where she hoped Naomi was by default, felt like a part of themselves was now missing, <br />
something that had never felt during their time as human beings. It make them feel naked <br />
(the irony), and vulnerable. The struggle that left their heads swimming most however, <br />
was trying to remember which one of them was which! They had shared so many of their <br />
secrets and experiences with each other since coming to the park, and the experiences <br />
within the park ran parallel to each other. Both shook their heads, unwittingly at the same <br />
time in spite of their distance, they had their duty to the park, the pack, and the guests, <br />
the rest they could push aside, and did so, for the sake of that duty and rediscovered their <br />
focus. Becoming calm again, they both returned to the task each had at hand. <br />
<br />
Collecting herself the husky with the deer said politely, &quot;Now while you wait why don't you <br />
practice?&quot; She gestured to the pens and paper at the stumps, looking rather alien in this <br />
'all natural' park.<br />
<br />
'What are those?' Jeremy thought, concentrating for a moment, 'Ah right, pen and... <br />
paper... to... write with: to convey ideas and information via visual non-pictographic <br />
symbols!'<br />
<br />
The husky calmly watched, feeling a ping of amusement as Lord Jeremy, then Lady Leticia <br />
fumbled with the pens with their clumsier armored fingers. The twin was struck with <br />
entertaining stories of illiterate nobility as the deer finally got their fingers around the <br />
pens and managing not to break them in half. <br />
<br />
'Now let's see here, I'll show this husky, I don't need practice, I can just... uh... ' Jeremy, <br />
and Leticia, stared at the sheets as blank as the paper. Drake and Lateisha said nothing, <br />
having no intention of correcting their Lord and Lady unless absolutely necessary.  <br />
<br />
Jeremy showed self control when he resisted the urge to bang his hoof against the stump. <br />
'This is stupid! I've read and wrote for most of my life! I can do this easy!' <br />
<br />
Jeremy wrote out an illegible scribble across the paper sheet. Leticia was taking things one <br />
letter at the time, digging deep past the layers of deer and woman that now laid on top of <br />
her human experiences. 'L... yes, 'L', 'e', 't'- how do I spell my name? Hannah and I never <br />
discussed it. Oh well, this'll be how I spell my name from now on! L-e-t-i-, yes that's <br />
right, c-i-a! Yes! Leticia! My name is Leticia, and it's spelled L-e-t-i-c-i-a!' Truth was, <br />
Leticia felt like she was a fawn back in grade school.  Her writing was sloppy with her new <br />
fingers, but at least she could make out the letters. <br />
<br />
She looked at Jeremy, and saw the frustration in his eyes, his writing looking like chicken <br />
scratch. Without saying a word, she calmly placed her hoof over his his, and gently guided <br />
his hoof as he slowly wrote out his name. Lord Jeremy looked at Lady Leticia, and she saw <br />
the look of gratitude in his eyes. <br />
<br />
Lateisha and Drake looked proudly at their herd leaders, while the twin felt satisfied, <br />
things were working out well on this end. She just hoped the rest of her got back with <br />
pack leader Naomi soon with the wedding contract! It wouldn't do to keep the two deer <br />
waiting long, not with Marth in the arena. <br />
<br />
+++++<br />
<br />
'Bury it all.' Naomi cursed. 'Can't anything ever be simple?' While deep down, Naomi felt a <br />
thrill at the idea of her pack leader maintaining her current species, realistically, Naomi <br />
knew this was a disaster. <br />
<br />
In order to avoid accidents and avoid being sued for all they were worth, the park <br />
maintained a back-up file of park guests' human template after their transformation in <br />
case the main system failed. However, Juanita had been VERY thorough on her erasure, <br />
TOO thorough it seemed. She had been certain to erase all records and files related to that <br />
time during the equipment, then -overwrite- them with new dummy data! And unlike the <br />
sentient brain, computers couldn't recall something once it was overwritten. Ironically, if <br />
Juanita wasn't just so good at what she had done, she could have found a copy of her <br />
human template in the cache, or simply undone the erasure command to restore the lost <br />
information. But Juanita had wanted to make sure people like Mr. M didn't mindlessly <br />
stumble on some information she had accidently missed and use it as proof she had <br />
broken the sacred pact among the Management not to assume her desired form until their <br />
stalking deer had spear headed the way for them in society. <br />
<br />
Naomi could only watch in fear for her pack leader at the dismay on Juanita's canine <br />
features she had sought for so long now twisted into deeper and deeper worry, then fear, <br />
and what might soon become panic! Naomi knew if that happened, the Management would <br />
find this out for sure, and that could very well BE the end of her pack leader. <br />
<br />
Both dogs jumped when they heard someone coming, but calmed down once they smelled <br />
it was another husky. One of the twins busted into the transformation chamber, huffing <br />
and puffing, which for a husky was a very rare sight indeed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh thank dog you're here!&quot; The twin huffed, she quickly stood at attention, ignoring <br />
Juanita. And why not? She was just another husky. The twin didn't dare berate Naomi for <br />
not being there, not contracting them, or anything of the sort, even if she could work up <br />
the nerve to say such things to her pack leader, there wasn't time, &quot;Madam Naomi! The <br />
married deer are at the designated coordinates, and merely await the wedding contract to <br />
sign to make their marriage legal Madam Naomi!&quot; <br />
<br />
Naomi groaned, she couldn't believe this! She had kept the folder containing the marriage <br />
contract with -herself- just because she didn't trust any other member of the pack with <br />
such an important job! Now it had nearly resulted in -another- disaster on top of the one <br />
they were already facing! <br />
<br />
'The guests come first. Without them, this park is meaningless, think about the guests.' <br />
Naomi remembered the pack's mantra. Naomi sighed, like it or not, Juanita was part of the <br />
pack, and she had to know that she'd have to put the guests above herself. Putting on her <br />
serious face, and like gurgling acid, she spoke to her pack leader in a authoritative tone. <br />
&quot;J-Jessica! You will remain here unless you finnish debugging the transformation chamber <br />
software before I return, understood newbie?&quot; <br />
<br />
Juanita started, completely not used to Naomi ever using that tone when speaking to her, <br />
all the same, she played along, &quot;Y-yes madam!&quot; <br />
<br />
Naomi looked at the twin, &quot;Now let's go.... &quot; She knew it was humiliating to ask this <br />
question, but after this debacle, Naomi knew Naomi deserved it. &quot;Er, which one are you?&quot; <br />
<br />
The husky looked at Naomi for a few moments before saying, &quot;I'm one of the twins, both <br />
and the same, that is all.&quot; <br />
<br />
Naomi stared, which HAD been the last time anyone had spoken to one of the twins when <br />
they had been separted? Right after they first arrived? While the power of authority and <br />
suggestion had proven powerful, Naomi seriously doubted it could create telepathy <br />
between twins, let alone turning two separate people into a single personality. But Naomi <br />
also realized she didn't have to time to deal with this. If the twins functioned better this <br />
way, as part of the pack, and part of the park staff, then Naomi grimly thought that for <br />
now she wasn't about to stop them. <br />
<br />
Jaunita merely looked on amazement. <br />
<br />
&quot;All right then,&quot; Naomi breathed out, &quot;Let's go then to the deer, and your other half.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The rest of me.&quot; The twin nodded and raced the way she came, Naomi easily keeping up <br />
with her, and ultimately surpassing her. Leaving Jaunita alone in the transformation <br />
chamber, to consider her very limited options. <br />
<br />
The twin was fast, and she seemed to grow faster the closer she got to the other half of <br />
herself. But Naomi wasn't winded from the racing TO the entrance building, and Naomi <br />
was ultimately the best husky the pack had, and that included running speed and sprinting <br />
distance. <br />
<br />
The sun setting, the day becoming night, Naomi arrived at the 'Legal Office' of the park's <br />
interior, which was really just a spot chosen for this to happen. Breathing deeply through <br />
her nose, the other twin yelped at her superior's presence and stood at attention. To the <br />
deer it looked like she was standing at attention to thin air, until Naomi had enough <br />
composure slip out of her camouflage position and standing at attention herself arms <br />
behind her back at the two 'royal deer.' She moved her arms to the front, holding the <br />
envelope that held the wedding contract. <br />
<br />
&quot;Lord Jeremy, Lady Leticia, it's an honor to see you,&quot; As the first pregnant couple in the <br />
park, they, along with the panthers, were given Special priority by the Management and by <br />
Naomi herself. &quot;I have the wedding contracts with me, are you ready to sign?&quot; <br />
<br />
Still wearing his 'marriage pattern' of body paint, and standing tall, and looking every bit <br />
the park title 'lord of the deer,' his wife beside him, the Lord of the Deer spoke, &quot;We are <br />
Madam.&quot; <br />
<br />
Leticia smirked, she was glade that having to relearn to write his name hadn't shaken her <br />
younger husband's confidence. <br />
<br />
The other twin finally caught up with Naomi, panting for breath her tongue hanging out. <br />
The twins saw each other and were hit by stunningly powerful shock waves of seeing each <br />
other. Without even thinking they nearly ran into each, hugging each other. It was like a <br />
missing body part had come back into being! The deer blinked at the twin they saw <br />
hugging thin air, but could guess at what was going on. <br />
<br />
Naomi barked, and the other twin became visible, they stood at attention like two sides of <br />
a mirror and bowed together saying in sync, &quot;Forgive us Madam Naomi.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;It's all right.&quot; Leticia said before Naomi could bark her berate, &quot;Everything has worked out, <br />
everything is fine, there's no need to fret over anything.&quot; <br />
<br />
Naomi thought of Jaunita, 'if only that were true,' all the same, she relented. <br />
<br />
The twins breathed a sign of relief at having at least for now being spared their pack <br />
leader's wrath. <br />
<br />
Naomi calmly opened the folder, and removed the contracts, &quot;There's the marriage <br />
contract, and the legal contract for officially changing Lady Leticia's name. Feel free to <br />
read over both as much as you'd like, our legal monkey team did their best to make it as <br />
straight foreword as possible.&quot;<br />
<br />
The herd leaders looked at each other, then looked at the contracts as Naomi set them <br />
down, using a pair of small rocks as paper weights. <br />
<br />
It took a few minutes, a bit longer for Jeremy than Leticia, but the deer haltingly, then <br />
carefully read out the contracts. There was truly nothing extra ordinary about them, both <br />
of them really being standard in the legal part of their union and the changing of Leticia's <br />
name. <br />
<br />
Drake, knowing legal mumbo jumbo when he saw it, and knowing how to create it, looked <br />
over the contracts for his herd leaders without even being asked, and confirmed that both <br />
were on the level. <br />
<br />
Just to be safe, Leticia signed the name changing contract first, first with the name of her <br />
former self, and with the name she would now use for the rest of her life. <br />
<br />
Then came the moment of truth, without hesitation on anyone's part, Jeremy and Leticia <br />
signed the contracts, with Drake and Lateisha having practiced also wrote in the witnesses' <br />
slot. <br />
<br />
Naomi calmly took the contract and placed them back in the folder, and smiled, SMILED, <br />
Naomi the queen bitch (that's what she was, so it wasn't a slur), had just smiled, well, as <br />
close as a muzzle could actually COME to smiling, the facial muscles did their best, Naomi <br />
bowed her head slightly to make it not seem like she was just showing off her fangs.  <br />
&quot;Congratulations, to the both of you, both on your union, the place you've managed to <br />
create for yourselves within the park, and for the future you've made for each other and <br />
for all our kinds in general.&quot; <br />
<br />
After giving the twins orders to keep an eye on the Lord and Lady of the deer until the <br />
Special Guests, their families, left the park, Naomi left the deer to their own devices and <br />
fate. She had to return to her pack leaders, to Madam J. <br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Ladies and gentlemen,&quot; Monty announced his fellow conspiracy enthusiasts standing <br />
above and in front of all of them, &quot;I have decided upon the perfect way to dig to the heart <br />
of the truth that has obviously been kept from the guests of this park and from the people <br />
at large.&quot; <br />
<br />
A couple of the motley crew turned from looking at the sunset to hear Monty's latest <br />
scheme, most did not, figuring Monty was back to normal. <br />
<br />
&quot;I have chosen to discover the truth from within, and any of you who wish to join me in <br />
this endeavor would be greatly appreciated for it shall aid it greatly.&quot; Everyone looked at <br />
each other wondering what he meant. <br />
<br />
&quot;I have chosen to sacrifice my current species, and seek employment in the park as a <br />
husky!&quot; Plus there was the good chance as one he'd be able to spend more time with <br />
Jessica, she had proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that she wasn't part of this <br />
mysterious conspiracy, and she'd be a much needed ally. <br />
<br />
Everyone laughed. &quot;Monty!&quot; The badger said between gasps, &quot;You really think they'd hire <br />
you?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;And didn't someone else try discovering the truth about Rosewell from the inside?&quot; Said a <br />
sow who had joined a short while ago herself, &quot;It didn't work, the military didn't let him <br />
near the place!&quot; <br />
<br />
Monty maintained a straight face, rather than screaming at them to be quiet as they were <br />
sure he was going to do. Some actually began to wonder, if MONTY HIMSELF had been <br />
replaced by a clone or reprogrammed. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'll have you know I am very well educated, I think with all of you I have proven my people <br />
skills,&quot; Some giggled but realistically, Monty's weird charisma had enticed a good deal of <br />
them from not walking out on Monty and his wild theories, &quot;If they refuse to accept me, <br />
they'd only be letting on that they were hiding something. And I have learned that while <br />
the huskies are part of The System, I am beginning to suspect they are in fact as much <br />
prisoners of it as we are. I am certain there are those among them that also wish to see <br />
the truth.&quot; <br />
<br />
There were some murmurs among the conspiracy club, and they began to wonder if, <br />
maybe, just maybe, Monty might have actually been on to something. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Said one of the two tortises, (it was simply fantastic how much their patience had <br />
increased by leaps and bounds since their change), &quot;I guess we'll have to wait and see until <br />
your vacation expires to see if they'll take you if you manage to convince them you're not <br />
going to blow up the building.&quot; <br />
<br />
This time Monty himself laughed at the joke at his expense. Now he was scaring them. <br />
&quot;Maybe! Maybe NOT! Our vacation contracts all state that we have to stick with the species <br />
and genders we've chosen for the remainder of our stay, and that the minimum time that <br />
each of us was given to stay in the park can't be shortened. -However-! The huskies never <br />
leave the park! So that's one factor solved. And if I manage, as you said, to prove to them <br />
I'm not going to 'blow up the building' and might actually be useful to them, they'll accept <br />
me into their pack and might even be willing to turn a blind eye to a second species <br />
change. And the same with any of you who might be interested in joining me in this daring <br />
venture.&quot; <br />
<br />
Some actually were, either because they figured this crazy idea of Monty's might actually <br />
work, it might be an amusing distraction because it would never get off the ground, or just <br />
moved by Monty's weird charisma. <br />
<br />
&quot;And!&quot; The mongoose raised a tiny claw, &quot;While they might be under contract, the huskies <br />
are ultimately like any social group, and I believe will be eager to see additions to their <br />
numbers and their influence. After all, if there are more of them, the System will direct <br />
them to more diverse tasks. As long as we can convince them that we aren't a collect of <br />
paranoid idiots with nothing better to do with our time, things are certain to work out!&quot; <br />
And Monty laughed again, at himself! It was like he was making up for lost time! <br />
<br />
And in that laugh, a good deal of the motley looked at each other, and began to consider <br />
the virtues of Monty's scheme, and weather sacrificing the species' that some of them had <br />
grown quite accustom to, was indeed a sacrifice worthy of  finding The Truth.  <br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
Her wonderful new body feeling heavy, Juanita went over the files again, and again, and <br />
again. Nothing. There was no trace of it, she was just too good for her own good. And of <br />
course, there was no standard human genetic template, one was recorded for each guest... <br />
since the Management had never seen a reason to create one given their ultimate goal. <br />
Each genetic template had taken at least a year to create, making sure organs would <br />
properly function and bones would not collapse on themselves. True, humans were a tried <br />
and true design, Juanita had to begrudging admit to that. Making one would take a <br />
fraction of the time. But there was the simple matter that even if one could be made, <br />
Juanita would not be able to get her old face back, and her secret would be out. After all <br />
the years she had spent trying to get ride of her human form, she now wanted it back! <br />
<br />
Juanita knew precisely what would happen to her, the Management had all voted on, and <br />
agreed to, to the divine punishment for betraying the vow of not assuming their true form <br />
until anthros had been accepted, or rather (more realistically), found a place in society.<br />
<br />
Juanita, not trusting some of her fellows to keep their word, had actually included some of <br />
more nasty ones! As per the agreement on the violation of the vow, Juanita would lose her <br />
position within the management. She would be stripped of all authority and control related <br />
to the park. Worse, all her stocks invested in the park would be confiscated, and be given <br />
out equally to the remaining board members! And her companies to be bought out as <br />
good old fashioned revenge (that one had been Juanita's idea!!!). The worst part of course, <br />
was that she was be thrown out like a lamb to the wolves. She would be -tossed- into the <br />
outside world. Made into a public spectacle for the tabloids and gossip rags to dance <br />
about! While Hannah would be given much support from the various positions  the <br />
Management held, Juanita would receive none, the media would eat her alive! She also <br />
knew, her family would never forgive her for keeping this part of her life secret for so <br />
long! <br />
<br />
Juanita had not been lying to Hannah when she had told the doe that not everyone had her <br />
courage, or her resolve to face a world that was not ready to accept them, and that person <br />
would have to make their own place. <br />
<br />
The idea of being sent out defenseless, likely tonight if she was discovered, terrified <br />
Juanita to her core. It was like seeing the grim reaper itself was marching towards her <br />
calmly and without pity. <br />
<br />
' 'It was just going to be for a day!' Yeah right, like anyone will believe that. And the vow <br />
doesn't make such exceptions.' <br />
<br />
Juanita had actually had fantasies about some of the more selfish members of the board <br />
cheating and becoming their true form before stage two was in effect, and Juanita <br />
watching on TV with satisfaction as they were turned into a media made carnival freak. It <br />
seemed, that karma didn't appreciate you wishing bad things on other people... <br />
<br />
One option she could have was to some how make all the park guests be exposed to the <br />
world tonight and be lost in the shuffle and... now she was just creating escapist fiction for <br />
herself. <br />
<br />
Juanita sat down in front of the computer console, looking at her reflection. She thought <br />
about this day, she had been so happy, so innocent, so free. It had just been a fantasy of <br />
course, but wasn't that what she had been perusing her whole life? A way to make her <br />
fantasies real? She considered her options, her REAL options. The one she chose wasn't the <br />
one she had to do, it was the one that she wanted to do. Selfish choice she supposed, but <br />
wasn't it... heh... human... to be selfish once in a while? <br />
<br />
Calmly getting up from the machine, Juanita found her human clothes that had been so <br />
carefully hidden, and threw them into an incineration. Feeling no regrets as she watched <br />
them ever so quickly turn to ashes. Leaving them behind without looking back, she went <br />
to a computer terminal and began to type in some blind transactions along with some <br />
personal information she had to enter into the system's main computer. She also had to <br />
enter several personal messages, and records that would need some revising. She <br />
shivered, and had a sicking feeling in the pit of her stomach. She honestly felt like she was <br />
signing her own death warrant, maybe she was. <br />
<br />
The same talent for thoroughness that had gotten her into this mess now helped her <br />
again, or maybe was just helping her dig herself in deeper. She also arranged some other <br />
details that would be needed both long term and short term. Just to be on the same side <br />
she sent an encrypted message to her family just in case. She also mailed some sealed <br />
letter, along with instructions to the postal office on when and to who they were to be <br />
delivered. All of them while Naomi was still out. 'No lose ends.' Juanita thought. <br />
<br />
The most important parts were already done, and there was no turning back. If she was <br />
caught now she'd be deader than dead. The part with herself and Naomi however, was <br />
going to be very tricky. <br />
<br />
&quot;See you in a year or two Hannah.&quot; Juanita said breathlessly. She was sacred inside so <br />
badly, but her other choice, sacred her even worse. Going to her office, she found a <br />
candle, and used the mirror in the bathroom. She looked at the husky looking back.<br />
<br />
'Naomi is Jessica's pack leader, but I am Naomi's pack leader, but I am also Jessica, so <br />
Naomi is my pack leader also.' Indeed, this part was going to be tricky. <br />
<br />

<br />
Harrison news hound had stayed at Predator Hill to observe things there, keeping a safe <br />
distance, Chris the panther of fear had become a bit of a public icon in her short stay, like <br />
people like to know the path of a hurricane, people liked to know Chris the panther's <br />
movements. <br />
<br />
Rex on the other hand, was staying close to his sister, least she do something impulsive <br />
again. He wondered, would she gain back her adult personality when she was re-aged? If <br />
so, that would be a nasty bug that people needed to discuss. Ironically, if Monty had been <br />
trying to hard to connect conspiracies in the park to every other conspiracy in existence, <br />
the news hounds would have trusted him with information a lot more readily. <br />
<br />
For right now, like the wolves, the lynxes merely observed the battles that had begun, <br />
memorizing every detail with the photographic and EVENTgraphic memory that each every <br />
member of the news hound core had been trained in. Would they keep these talents when <br />
they became human again, Rex thought, well, like Lexy having an adult personality again, <br />
there was only one way to find out. <br />
<br />
Jenny having been silently elected the el facto nanny for the fawns watching this new <br />
tournament. Jenny questioned if it was wise to let children seen such things, considering <br />
how the last tournament turned out. She was also keep an eye on Spike, who while curious <br />
about this tournament, kept looking away from it. The two guest fawns were looking <br />
excited at these fights, actually jumping up and down and cheering!  The third older guest <br />
fawn stood looking fully entranced. She seemed to have completely forgotten about her <br />
nudity after the dance, or that it had even mattered to her, she looked at the bucks like a <br />
moth does flame. Jenny knew that humans just didn't age and die of being elderly as fast <br />
as deer did, and this meant this girl between fawn and doe was going to be in that flux a <br />
lot longer than any fawn in nature would be. She also knew where she had LAST seen that <br />
entranced look, and make a VERY important point to keep a very firm grip on the lass' <br />
shoulder least she do anything -stupid.- <br />
<br />
Jenny cheered for Rob when he entered the arena against Marth, and did so for John in <br />
Lateisha's place. Jenny also cringed and placed her muzzle in one hoof when Rob was sent <br />
flying from the arena. John proceeded to be skidded out! Still in the locked horned <br />
position and pushing for all he was worth as Marth proved stronger than the ground's <br />
surface tension and forced him clean out of the circle, locking eyes with both and gaining <br />
their submission. <br />
<br />
&quot;I can't BELIEVE IT! We lost to a guy who used to be a chick! AGAIN!&quot; Robbie moaned in <br />
total defeat and humiliation. &quot;Like a pin loses to a bowling ball!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe we're just the wrong gender after all.&quot; John lamented. <br />
<br />
&quot;Let us never bring that up again.&quot; Robbie mumbled. &quot;Maybe we're just not cut out to be <br />
deer.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I think you make a positively wonderful buck.&quot; Jenny said having been right behind <br />
Robbie's landing site from Marth's throw. <br />
<br />
Of course, Jenny ended up comforting Rob, and Spike offered his own simple word of <br />
sympathy. <br />
<br />
John... found himself ashamed he had lost. Thinking of ... Lateisha's disappointment? Was <br />
that just a buck having been degraded for being able to mate with a female... or was he <br />
really sorry about not being able to impress Lateisha? Well, she'd be human soon enough, <br />
he'd have his answer then. <br />
<br />
But what started EVERYONE there, from the bucks to the does, to the hounds to the <br />
wolves, was that Marth didn't stay the only contender in this small seed tournament for <br />
long! <br />
<br />
Leticia's sister, mother, and the other female special guests, after having been swept up in <br />
the song, had clustered together to stay silent, observe, and behold the outcome of the <br />
small tournament. Bettina actually found herself sizing up the bucks as they fought, won <br />
and lost! She knew she was supposed to leave first thing tomorrow morning and would <br />
never see these men in these form likely ever again. But it just seemed the proper thing to <br />
be doing. 'It's the doe's duty for the herd to properly appraise the male stock- Okay. <br />
Where did that thought come from? Maybe it's a GOOD thing we're all outta here tomorrow <br />
morning... except for Larry... and her new hubby... hope they know what they're doing.' <br />
<br />
Beauty Queen Hannah sat on her 'throne' feeling worried each time Marth staggered but <br />
smiled each time he got back up. While the bucks now obeyed Sam degree without <br />
question to be more polite to the doe, she couldn't but think this was the completion of <br />
the tournament that had started originally just for the sake of winning her approval. <br />
<br />
What she didn't expect though was, was three bucks, Marcus, another buck, and an elderly <br />
one (deer in nature often didn't last long for old age to finnish them off), who had been <br />
part of the circle of bucks from the very beginning, enter the arena circle as well. <br />
<br />
Marcus had felt odd, and different ever since that dance his herd leader, ugh, his son, had <br />
led in, he hadn't given it a second thought when he moved with all the other bucks to what <br />
was apparently a fighting ground. Leticia's father also followed along without question, <br />
and not once did his wife ask what he was doing nor try to stop him, merely standing <br />
along side calmly and reserved. It was like breathing, it was just something that needed to <br />
be done. <br />
<br />
And Leticia's grandfather... he had felt the same as both the younger bucks, mother nature <br />
hadn't ever counted on bucks living to old age. <br />
<br />
Proving that the sentient mind could override instincts, Rob quickly declined the idea of <br />
stepping back into the arena, having had his full of humiliation. Besides, the doe he <br />
wanted was already at his side. <br />
<br />
John on the other hand... had found himself suffering defeat -again-... at least he got the <br />
pleasure of seeing Lance get his tail handed to him no less than four times... before John <br />
got beaten and dominated twice more, and was left with the very dubious honor of being <br />
the one who had successfully dominated Leticia's grandfather... but dang... did that old <br />
man have some nasty throws... John was just lucky he had more stamina! <br />
<br />
He didn't so much as DARE look at the old buck's doe! This was a victory he had no <br />
intention of telling Lateisha about! <br />
<br />
After having put the majority of the frat boys in their place, the two fathers looked at each <br />
other grimly. Truth of the matter was, that many of the bucks were very reluctant to even <br />
raise a hoof against the fathers of their herd leaders, it felt like violating sacred ground! <br />
They fear insulting them even more and gave them their all though. Not that it mattered in <br />
the end, they all eventually fell. Experience was a very deadly weapon. <br />
<br />
&quot;If the fighting had happened -before- the dance, the fathers wouldn't have swept house <br />
like this. The dance completely synchronized their human minds with their new evolved <br />
buck brains. Before the frat boys would have had the advantage of having more time used <br />
to their bodies than these men. But after the dance rewired their psychology, that <br />
advantage was gone.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Eeep!&quot; Jenny started as the doe commented right next to her. &quot;Su Yin are you half husky? <br />
Don't come out of the blue like that!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; The doe said, &quot;I actually stayed away as long as I could, but since-&quot; Su Yin stopped <br />
herself before she said he was planning on ending her book's main body on the day of the <br />
wedding day, &quot;-today has been such a fantastic day. I simply had to observe how this <br />
went.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Four bucks for the price of one, who'd have thought it.&quot; Jenny said. <br />
<br />
&quot;I doubt they did.&quot; Su Yin observed as the two middle aged bucks did battle. <br />
<br />
Marcus was years younger than Leticia's father, while Leticia's father didn't want to leave <br />
with the impression he had somehow raised a girly girl boy in spite of Leticia's choices. <br />
The two bucks had clashed so hard their antlers gained micro-fractures. They then <br />
actually began -throwing- each other around using each other's locked horns as leverage, <br />
leaving a many impression in the dirt. In terms of fighting skill the bucks were just about <br />
evenly matched. Ultimately it came down to a test of endurance, in which a tired Marcus <br />
emerged the victor. Leticia's father being looked into the eyes, and submitting to the <br />
superior buck and inching away from him respectfully and loyally where his doe waited for <br />
him. <br />
<br />
With Drake, and Lord Jeremy having yet to return. That left only one other buck to fight. <br />
Hannah narrowed her eyes, but knew she couldn't stop this anymore than she could stop <br />
the tides. <br />
<br />
&quot;Marcus, Father of Lord Jeremy our herd leader,&quot; Hannah said, truly sounding like a queen, <br />
a voice of authority and control in her every word. She stood up proudly, still having some <br />
of the flowers from the wedding on her, adding to her regal appearance. &quot;Marth, My <br />
Chosen Buck and friend to Lady Leticia, our Herd Mother!&quot; Hannah realized what she had <br />
said only after she had spoken it. 'No regrets.' <br />
<br />
This caused a wave through the bucks but none said anything. <br />
<br />
&quot;Begin!&quot; She thundered. <br />
<br />
Feeling the authority from the judge Marcus charged, and hearing the words of his doe, <br />
Marth (that what She called him, so that's what his name was) did the same. They didn't <br />
lock antlers however, Marth dived high, Marcus dived low. <br />
<br />
The two began circling each other, resorting to good old fashioned melee attacks, which <br />
got the huskies all on medical stand-by alert on the double! They didn't want another <br />
Spike incident. <br />
<br />
During all of this, unseen by all, Lord Jeremy and Lady Leticia with their seconds returned. <br />
<br />
&quot;What is the meaning of all this.&quot; Jeremy declared, but he couldn't be heard over the noise <br />
of the bucks and the battle, Lance however did hear, and instantly fell to his knees and <br />
explained everything to his herd leader. <br />
<br />
Drake meanwhile... merely got into position, knowing it was his duty, to face whoever <br />
became the champion of this battle. <br />
<br />
Soon the bucks were -wrestling- with each other, creating a storm of dirt in the twilight, <br />
the stars beginning to appear. This was no normal boxing match, or olympic judo match, <br />
there were no rules. Marcus managed to knee Marth on the inside of one of his thighs, and <br />
Marth much like Keith in that moment realized just how vulnerable that part of himself <br />
was. It might have been in a protective layer right now, but that realization threw him off <br />
his game for about three seconds, and those three seconds were all it took for Marcus to <br />
pin him, and look into his eyes, and Marth in that instant knew he had lost. He had lost to <br />
the father of the buck who had claimed Leticia from him. <br />
<br />
&quot;The winner, is Marcus.&quot; Hannah said calmly and without emotion, though her eyes were <br />
on Marth. <br />
<br />
Without even announcing himself, Drake entered the arena. <br />
<br />
Marth dared climb over to Hannah's side, as without even the slightest fanfare, the battle <br />
began, and very quickly ended. Of all of them, Drake found his heart wasn't in this fight. <br />
Like he was an after thought to a very important event. <br />
<br />
The corporate shark turned buck, found himself staring at the darkening sky, and the eyes <br />
of the father of his herd leader, and quickly huddled away. <br />
<br />
The bucks parted like a sea before Moses as Lord Jeremy ended the arena, looking at his <br />
father, the two stared each other down intensely. The logic of the bucks dictated they fight <br />
now. However, after everything, after all that had happened, something about it, not felt, <br />
they felt like they had to fight, but they thought, that it just seemed pointless. <br />
<br />
It was like an all out war was going on inside the two bucks, until, like seeing the elderly <br />
as important rather than baggage, the two bucks came to a resolution. <br />
<br />
&quot;You're an excellent herd leader Jeremy, just as I was,&quot; Marcus said, thinking of his family. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you father.&quot; Jeremy breathed. <br />
<br />
And that, was that. The tournament was over. The slightly anti-climax, leaving everyone <br />
there very very happy and relieved. Leticia looked on, never feeling so proud of her <br />
husband. <br />
<br />
'Perhaps,' Thought Su Yin, 'that, is the perfect place to end it.' <br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
Chris' father wandered the park as only a giant bear can, his mind still in a daze. He would <br />
never recall how precisely he had ended up at the entrance building, nor where his <br />
demented scheme had formulated inside his brain or what made him even think it could <br />
work, but maybe deep down, after hearing of Chris nearly becoming a man slaughterer, <br />
maybe, the bear felt this was the only way he could regain his honor. <br />
<br />
&quot;THEY SAY YOU CAN HEAR US WHEREVER WE ARE AND CAN SEE US NO MATTER WHERE WE <br />
ARE!&quot; The bear's bellow echoed for a mile and a half (still a rather small percent of the <br />
part). &quot;You sound like a deity or an evil government syndicate! I don't care which! I have a <br />
deal I want to make!!&quot; <br />
<br />
Having been marked as a trouble maker, the huskies as a whole saw no reason not to hear <br />
him out. Naomi, hoping for an excuse to beat this male with no respect towards the <br />
obviously superior gender to a pulp, of course was the one to hear him out. <br />
<br />
&quot;You have something to say?&quot; Naomi's face was all business, and held the slightest trace of <br />
bitterness and large lumps of coldness. The big bear didn't even react when Naomi <br />
seemed to pop out of thin air. He felt her disturbed the air pressure as she had moved <br />
unseen. <br />
<br />
&quot;I do. I have a bargain I'd like to offer you.&quot; The bear said to the husky woman. <br />
<br />
Naomi knew that the bear was easily larger and stronger than her, but she was still more <br />
than fast enough to make him a eunuch in the flash of an eye.  &quot;And what could you <br />
possibly have to offer for that deal?&quot; Her tone remained the same. She also made sure in <br />
advance to tell the huskies she wanted to deal with this possible trouble maker in private. <br />
She needed this. <br />
<br />
What the big bear was about to ask for, went against just every principle he had, both real <br />
and imaginary. But this wouldn't be the first time he had made a deal with the preverbal <br />
devil for the sake of  the greater cause (both real and his slanted view of it). And this dog, <br />
with a face colder than wintered, and looking like some living ice sculpture in the light of <br />
the rising moon and pre-night, certain gave off the vibe of that devil. <br />
<br />
His preconceptions preparing him for once, the broken clock that was right twice a day, <br />
the martial artist who often believed any woman who acted this business like had <br />
something against men. This was usually due to actually women who didn't have time to <br />
let him down gently. As it was, the papa bear knew he had to offer this brand of woman <br />
the one thing he knew she'd want more than anything. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'll give you what you want more me. The only thing a woman like you would want more <br />
me.&quot; <br />
<br />
Naomi got ready to cut him to pieces thinking this male thought she wanted some. But <br />
when she heard his offer, his grinned, giggled, then cackled like a witch! This was too <br />
beautiful! When she heard what he wanted in return, she sobered slightly, but yes, this <br />
would do, this would do very much indeed. Her only regret was that he wasn't a husky or <br />
she could try to screw with his tiny mind too! <br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
Three hours later, Naomi returned to the transformation chamber Juanita had been left in <br />
feeling rather pleased with herself, happy, calm, relaxed, and peaceful. She knew things <br />
would turn out for the best, and if those monkeys wanted to punish her pack leader for <br />
wanting to simply upgrade herself, well, she and her entire pack would show them just <br />
how dangerous their prize creations really were. <br />
<br />
When she found the chamber empty, she was certain Juanita had found a file she had <br />
skipped over, or hot wired the machine to customize another human template to a <br />
reasonable facsimile of her old form. But she did notice a note written on the controls, <br />
obviously in Juanita's hand writing. <br />
<br />
'Naomi Husky, report to my office as soon as you find this message. Tell no one. This is a <br />
direct order from your pack leader, you shall obey it. Destroy this note. Erase all records of <br />
it. This is a direct order from your pack leader, you shall obey it.' <br />
<br />
While confused, Naomi as a husky knew it was better to obey first and ask questions later. <br />
Tossing the note into the local incinerator, and going over the video record, she erased <br />
and placed dummy images of the note having ever been there. She noticed that the time <br />
she knew Juanita had been inside the transformation chamber had already been replaced <br />
by dummy images as well.<br />
<br />
Not encountering so much as one member of the staff or of her pack, Naomi went to her <br />
pack leader's office, the moment she got close it electronically unlocked. Worried about <br />
one of the monkeys having betrayed them, Naomi sniffed the air, but only picked up her <br />
own scent, and that of the husky form of her pack leader, which was so fantastically <br />
different from that of her human self. <br />
<br />
Opening and closing the door the door behind her, Naomi found a darkened room. The <br />
only light being the stars and moon outside, and the just lit candle on top of a fireproof <br />
mat on the center of the floor. <br />
<br />
Behind it, Naomi saw and smelled Juanita still a husky sitting cross legged opposite her <br />
with the candle between them. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come and sit down Naomi, just across from me is good,&quot; Juanita said calmly and politely. <br />
<br />
Naomi without a second thought did as she was told, figuring it was best to humor her <br />
pack leader at a time like this. <br />
<br />
&quot;Naomi,&quot; Juanita said, &quot;You have been loyal beyond measure to me, you have served me <br />
without question, you have sought the goals of the cause without hesitation, you have <br />
been a husky longer than anyone, and most importantly, you have been my friend in a way <br />
that was more than just your job or instinct.&quot; <br />
<br />
Naomi bowed, now cross legged like her, &quot;You do me too much honor, I done my duty <br />
Madam J and nothing more.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A duty many would have ditched, shorted out on, or simply or abused the wording of. <br />
You've done none of these things Naomi, you've stuck with me thick and thin, like a true <br />
husky should.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Madam J.&quot; Naomi bowed again. <br />
<br />
&quot;Naomi, do you trust me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Naomi hesitated for just a moment, &quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I said do you trust me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; This time without delay. <br />
<br />
&quot;I have some orders that I need to give you, but I want your to say you'll obey them before <br />
I tell you what they are.&quot; <br />
<br />
Once upon a time, a human being named Naomi would have thought such a request <br />
absurd. But for the husky sitting across from the newest addition to that pack in that <br />
moment, to respond any other way was alien. And the event earlier that night, had left her <br />
in a rather relaxed and unarmed mood. &quot;Say so and I'll obey.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm going to have to go to sleep for a little while Naomi, just in case I don't wake up later, <br />
I want you to wake me up yourself, but I'm going to have to make sure you let me sleep in <br />
the mean time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Naomi was confused, &quot;Madam J, I don't really understand this order.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You will when you need to, that's what count. Now don't worry, I've taken care of all the <br />
details already, I just need to go over them with you. Now let's look into the flame together <br />
Husky, just the flame, just see the flame, your eyes don't need to see anything else, you <br />
just need to see the flame. Now.&quot; Juanita's tone became very serious, intense, rather <br />
identical to the tone Naomi used when addressing her subordinates. &quot;You will repeat after <br />
me Husky! You will not change the POV, you will repeat them word for word! You will not <br />
question them, you will not hesitate to repeat them! These are by far the most important <br />
orders you have ever been given in your life! Don't think anything else! Don't hear anything <br />
else! Don't see anything else! Just hear what I say! And say what you hear! Do you <br />
understand Husky?&quot;   <br />
<br />
Naomi was startled by the tone she had never heard her pack leader use before. But if <br />
these really were the most important orders of her life, then she wouldn't hesitate to obey <br />
them, hesitation lead to disasters. &quot;I repeat everything you say word for word. These are <br />
the most important orders of my life. I will not question or hesitate, I only hear you, I only <br />
speak what you say, I am not thinking anything else! Speak and command me.&quot; <br />
<br />
Juanita knew there only about a thousand things that could go wrong beyond this day, but <br />
she had already burned her bridges. She cleared her mind, and repeated the script she had <br />
rehearsed countlessly in her mirror, letting it go on autopilot. <br />
<br />
&quot;Your name is Jessica Husky.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;'Your name is Jessica Husky.'&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The person in front of me is Jessica Husky.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;'The person front of is Jessica Husky.' &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You are NOT Juanita, am not, was not, can not, and shall not be three hundred and sixty <br />
five days exactly.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;'You are NOT Juanita, am not, was not, can not, and shall not be three hundred and sixty <br />
five days exactly.'&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;We remember Juanita leaving the park together.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;We remember Juanita leaving the park together.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;We remember her leaving us a message to give to the Managers about needing to go into <br />
seclusion.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;We remember her leaving us a message to give to the Managers about needing to go into <br />
seclusion.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;We remember her telling us she had also transfered the majority of her wealth into a <br />
secure fund to act as support to allow anthros BORN in the park to remain within the park <br />
until their parents existed the park as well. We remember this is the agreement she left for <br />
the Management to agree to if they wished to continue to use her funding, we remember <br />
being given the pin numbers just in case.&quot; The newest husky said the number codes. &quot;We <br />
remember meeting months ago, we remember being trained separately. We remember it <br />
all. It is a natural memory. There is nothing odd or alien about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Naomi repeated, a glazed look in her eyes now. &quot;We remember the fund she had set up for <br />
natural born anthros, we remember the ultimatum she gave the monkeys, we remember <br />
meeting months ago, we remember being trained separately, I remember it all as clear as <br />
day.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;The person before me is Jessica Husky. It isn't Juanita, it could not possibly be Juanita.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The person before me is Jessica Husky. It isn't Juanita, it could not possibly be Juanita.&quot;<br />

day, then if she wants, she can go back to sleep.&quot;<br />

&quot;Until then, Juanita is away, we know how to contact her only if the lives of all the guests <br />
are in danger, and only she could somehow save them or the cause is doomed, we don't <br />
know how to reach her if the Management asks.&quot;<br />

<br />
&quot;We may stop repeating each other word for word now.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Tell me precisely who I am.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You are Jessica, could only be Jessica, you could never be Juanita, won't be for one year. <br />
You are the newest addition to our pack.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ask me who I am.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Jessica Husky, your student, but ultimately, just another member of your <br />
pack, my best friend is Katie, I started today on the wedding detail, I love how I can live <br />
out my childhood fantasy after finding and accepting this job. This is who I am. We have <br />
not just spent the last ten minutes speaking in the dark, we have been discussing Miss J's <br />
departure, and how I barely knew her compared to you. Tell me what we've been doing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We have been discussing Miss J's departure, it saddens me greatly, but I know she'll <br />
ultimately return, until then, I have to keep your tail out of trouble like she asked newbie. <br />
You are Jessica newbie, you are ONLY Jessica, you never met Miss J, you do not know her, <br />
she is a stranger. You are only a member of this pack and nothing more, that is your truth <br />
and that is your life.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;I am Jessica, a new husky, I am ONLY Jessica, I never met Miss J, I could not have known <br />
her, she is a stranger, I wish I could have met. My duty is the pack, the park, and the <br />
guests and nothing else, this is my life and my truth.&quot; Miss J clapped her paws, and the <br />
clapper switched on. <br />
<br />
Jessica and Naomi blinked at each other, and slowly got off the floor, the hypnotized look <br />
in their eyes fading as they stood. Finally, Jessica turned around and looked at the rising <br />
moon. &quot;I can't believe she's gone.&quot; Jessica said innocently. &quot;You say she really cared for the <br />
guests?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot; Naomi nodded, &quot;Stick with us for a year, you'll meet her.&quot; Naomi remembered the <br />
hug she had given her pack leader before her sudden departure, promising to return in a <br />
year's time or sooner if worst came to worst.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;YES MAM!&quot; Jessica stood at attention grinning and gave a solute like she was in the army. <br />
&quot;The year can't go by fast enough then MAM!&quot; Jessica wondered if Miss J was really as good <br />
as Naomi said, heroes had a habit of being much more live size than people gave them <br />
credit for. All the same, she couldn't be all bad if her pack leader had said so. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come on,&quot; Naomi said putting a paw on her shoulder, &quot;Let's finnish putting her stuff into <br />
storage, I'm not letting those bastard get their filthy fingers on anything of hers. Then let's <br />
get you settled in, you can't keep sleeping on my floor forever.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Mam!&quot; Jessica replied at once, while Naomi was a good teacher and very patient with <br />
her student. Jessica felt Katie was more fitting to have 'girl talk' with than the pack leader. <br />
It was funny, it felt like some giant weight she didn't know was there had been lifted off <br />
her shoulders. 'Sorry I didn't get to meet you Miss J. But I'm sure we'll get a chance.' <br />
<br />
Putting stuff away with her pack leader, Jessica found a note addressed to her, from Miss J! <br />
Whao. Why'd she have a message for her? She was just another noob for the pack. The <br />
message was short, three words. 'Jessica, Live life.' <br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
Sunset had just started, and Chris the panther girl walked around the forest, breathing in <br />
the serenity, doing her best to forget her temporary gender if only for a time. The whole <br />
animal thing was supposed to be cool, something to help her learn how to be a better <br />
fighter with some new perspective. Well, this was one perspective she wasn't going to <br />
forget any time soon! Maybe she had learned some things, but maybe she was just <br />
moaning about something she couldn't change, and it wasn't her right to demand things <br />
beyond her control change just because she wanted them too. <br />
<br />
She felt a ghost of a whisper against her fur, someone was behind her, she unsheathed her <br />
claws on reaction and turned on her claw, and felt the powerful blow on her nerve cluster <br />
at the base of her neck that caused her to fall into blackness. <br />
<br />
The blue vixen Chris gasped in alarm, it looked like Chris had just fainted! She should help <br />
her! After all, maybe if she looked like a hero she should act like. She took two steps to <br />
walk towards her and felt a nasty blow on her neck, and could have sworn she heard a <br />
woman's voice say harshly and coldly, &quot;Tramp.&quot; Before she lost consciousness. <br />
<br />
The vixen dreamed. The vixen dreamed that left the park in her new form. The moment <br />
she stepped out side the park, like Alice in the looking glass, all the weight she had as a <br />
male came back with a vengeance, years of pizza pockets and skipping gym to play <br />
Dungeons and Dragons became thick layers of fat underneath her fur. She dreamed that <br />
Nintendo sued her for all she was worth for mocking their product. She dreamed that her <br />
friends beat her to a pulp for shaming their ideal. She dreamed none of her baggy pants fit <br />
anymore because of her tail. She dreamed of a heart attack. <br />
<br />
She woke up screaming, her heart going a mile a minute, threatening to rip through her <br />
rip cage. She looked herself over. Not overweight. Not ugly. Not slow. Not male. Still blue. <br />
Still a virgin. Still the ideal. Chris hugged herself, what had that been all about? In all the <br />
months Chris had been her ideal, she hadn't cried once. Now like Chris too, she also cried. <br />
'Just a nightmare. Just a nightmare.' <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! Chris! You okay?&quot; <br />
<br />
Why did no one ever call her by her ideal's name? Was it that shallow after all? Still, she <br />
decided she decided to look and see who noticed her being pathetic. <br />
<br />
&quot;Eh? Who are you?&quot; Chris asked a bit rudely. <br />
<br />
The young male panther said looking almost as confused as she felt, &quot;Chris, you're not <br />
going to believe this.&quot; <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
The young panther dreamed. She dreamed she was fighting a tournament, wearing a <br />
dress. Then she was was fighting undressed in a bikini. Then, she was fighting in a <br />
wedding dress. Then she was trapped inside a TV fighting a bunch of girls who all looked <br />
exactly like her except for different hair styles. Then he was sitting in a class room with a <br />
bear headed monkey debating with a rabbit headed turtle on the location of the toll booth <br />
to Never Never Land. <br />
<br />
Finally, she opened her eyes, groaning. She turned over, propping her arms up, not <br />
wanting to squash her chest. There seemed to be a weight missing. Huh? She blinked. <br />
Something was wrong. Where was she? She looked around, she was in the park still, or at <br />
least a forest, she felt her chest... oh no! Those mad scientist had turned her now into a <br />
LITTLE girl! This was worse! That was when she felt an strong breeze, and she knew <br />
suddenly something was VERY wrong. She reached down between her legs and gasped! <br />
What was THAT doing there? Chris was now wide awake! <br />
<br />
She looked at herself, okay, this was just a really weird dream. She pinched herself, with <br />
her claws, and drew blood. Okay. Check this was no dream. She, HE was male. He was <br />
male again. He was male again! After all the freak outs, fears, panic attacks, mental break <br />
downs, and climb out of a hole of phobias, he was male again! He had no idea how this <br />
happened but that was okay with him! He wasn't about to look a gift horse in the mouth! <br />
Chris kicked his feet together and did a little dance. Okay, he admitted, maybe he wasn't <br />
as lithe as before and not quite as graceful... SO WHAT! The gender he had spent two <br />
decades getting used to and working out the details of was his again! And the upper body <br />
strength wasn't such a bad thing either! <br />
<br />
It took him a few minutes to realize he heard someone crying. Following the noise of the <br />
water works, he spotted Chris... had the mad scientists made her male again too? Must <br />
have been a blow to her vanity... nope... she sure looked female to him, and this park <br />
where everyone was naked, it was pretty hard to hide such things. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! Chris! You okay?&quot; He asked her. <br />
<br />
She stopped crying slightly and looked up at him like she would a stranger, &quot;Eh? Who are <br />
you?&quot; <br />
<br />
Okay, how was he going to explain this? &quot;Chris, you're not going to believe this.&quot; <br />
<br />
+++++++++<br />
<br />
Dusk had fallen, it was night, the wedding day had run it's course and the stars had now <br />
begun to come out. After having gotten their bearings, the Chris' made their way back to <br />
Predator Hill, where they found a worried and distraught pair of panthers. The moment <br />
they saw the two shapes Jackie began speaking. <br />
<br />
&quot;Where have you two been?! That had to be the longest walk in the history of the park! I <br />
swear I was going to call the huskies if you two were out much longer!&quot; <br />
<br />
The two looked at each other, both having flash backs to their first (and vixen Chris' case, <br />
only), date as human beings.<br />
<br />
The moment Chris got within night vision range of Jackie and Keith however. &quot;You! Who <br />
are you! You smell like Chris-but! What is this?! Chris is that-how is-! This has never <br />
happened before in the history of the park!!!&quot; <br />
<br />
Chris spoke before Jackie though he was an imposter or something, &quot;Jackie! Keith! It's me! <br />
I promise! I always miss that twig on my left hind paw whenever I'm stalking! My dad's a <br />
total loser! And I think video game suck!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot; Vixen Chris shrilled. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well I do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Keith said, &quot;The park's never done anything like this... I think we're gonna have more fuel <br />
to the fire for the forest spirit rumors. Chris... how'd this happen?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't have a clue... I got KO'ed, and when I woke up, I was me again....&quot; Everyone looked <br />
at him strangely, &quot;okay.... I was male again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Chris!&quot; Jackie said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The OTHER Chris!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I keep telling you it would be easy if you just called me-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As I was saying. You were supposed to be keeping an eye on Chris so what happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait you were spying on me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We didn't tell her to keep out of sight young woman, er, young man! Ugh! I'm sorry! I've <br />
only SEEN you as a girl before now! I feel like NOW you've changed! Now Chris what did <br />
you see?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know... he, she fainted on the spot a while away from the hill and a minute later so <br />
did I... nothing happened to me though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? You were crying when I found you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That was... that was personal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, okay, but you want to talk about it, don't hesitate okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
The vixen, stared open mouthed at Chris for several seconds. When was the last time <br />
anyone but her parents had offered her an open ear? <br />
<br />
&quot;You know,&quot; Said the blue vixen Chris, &quot;If you were a fox, I'd call you a hunk!&quot; The fact <br />
she'd be attracted to men in this form, she realized, was just the price she had to pay for <br />
her ideal (any girl he talked to had called him a fat geek anyway). It also confused the <br />
vixen, when she realized she now, for the first time since becoming her ideal, annoyed <br />
that guests couldn't feel attraction to different species. <br />
<br />
Chris the panther, while unable to feel anything for the vixen, was still not used to <br />
compliments from girls (even mutated ex-male girl) and stuttered, &quot;T-Thanks.&quot; <br />
<br />
Keith sighed, &quot;You know, no to sound harsh to you Chris, but it might have served your <br />
dad right for you to stay a girl during your vacation just to teach him a lesson about what <br />
women can and can't do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Honey,&quot; Said Jackie, &quot;I'm the girl now, that's MY line!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry dear.&quot; Keith apologized. <br />
<br />
&quot;Chris my boy is that you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris felt his stomach drop out from under him. It was impossible. It was impossible! She <br />
was dead! <br />
<br />
The panthers turned around, and saw a female bear hulking towards them. Chris had no <br />
clue why his mentors were reacting so violently to her presence, having never met Maggie. <br />
<br />
&quot;M-mom?&quot; Chris managed to croak out. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry honey, it's only me.&quot; Said the female bear. No one there had a clue who she was. <br />
None of them had seen her before in their lives. But there was something infuriatingly <br />
familiar about her to Chris. But who could this possibly be? <br />
<br />
Keith suspected, but he didn't believe it. Jackie could smell it, but also couldn't believe it. <br />
Chris the vixen was totally clueless. Chris the panther smelled it, and could two and two <br />
together... and dang... his head felt like it was about to implode. <br />
<br />
&quot;DAD?!&quot; <br />
<br />
The panthers stared in shock, Chris the vixen just stared stupidity. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello son. I'm glade to see you look more happy.&quot; The mama bear didn't seem the least <br />
bit surprised at seeing her son like this. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dad.. how did... when did... HOW DID YOU DO THIS?&quot; <br />
<br />
The large female bear sighed, her large breasts heaving up and down as she did so, &quot;Let's <br />
just say I made a deal with the devil and leave it at that.&quot; <br />
<br />
Zack had a good idea which devil the big bear was talking about. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dad.... why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's my fault you were a girl... I've never had any luck finding you a mother... I was told <br />
what you almost ended up doing... please... consider this my way of making a tiny bit of <br />
amends.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Dad..... mom?&quot; Chris said confused and scared. That was when the big bear did the last <br />
thing Chris would have expected in a million years... she hugged him. The emotional <br />
overload of being hugged by a female parent, though his rational mind -knew- this parent <br />
was really his father, addled his brain, and fainted. But... it felt good... nice even... the part <br />
of his brain that couldn't make that logical distinction, to be hugged by mom again. <br />
<br />
Chris the vixen left the panthers, and the new mama bear to themselves, slipping away <br />
like a ghost. Then again, hadn't she been trying to turn herself into something that wasn't <br />
real? She found the TG Gathering rather large hill of stones that had a very good view of <br />
nearly the entire park. She remembered to take the semi-steps that were on one side of <br />
the stone pile rather than climbing up the nasty rock face on the other side.  Her <br />
completely random guess paid off fittingly enough, she found Beauty Queen Hannah and <br />
Marth star gazing. <br />
<br />
&quot;Er, Miss Beauty Queen Hannah.&quot; Chris said in a meek voice, something else new for this <br />
body. &quot;I was wondering if you could, well, teach me to be more-lady like? I'm REALLY <br />
REALLY SORRY FOR BOTHERING YOU TONIGHT ABOUT IT!&quot;<br />
<br />
Hannah moaned as Marth looked at his partner funny, &quot;Chris, I already explained you don't <br />
get magical ESP just from-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, I meant, I mean for real.&quot; The vixen bowed to the Official, Unofficial TG support <br />
consoler of TF Park USA. &quot;I want you to teach me how to act like a -real- lady.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Hannah stared, was this really Chris? The one person who Hannah was sure had no clue <br />
what being female meant even after having gone through a monthly cycle? &quot;Chris? Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I just want... to better myself.&quot; <br />
<br />
Hannah again wondered if this was truly Chris, but finally relented, &quot;Okay, sit down here, <br />
we're going to star gaze until you fall asleep, and you are not going to mention video <br />
games OR science fiction -once- for the rest of the night.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris opened her mouth. <br />
<br />
&quot;Or fantasy.&quot; Hannah amended.<br />
<br />
Chris shut her mouth and gulped, this -was- going to be harder than she thought. But <br />
she'd manage it somehow, she had to, she didn't want to be where she was anymore.<br />
<br />
Chris was with his father, or was that mother now? Sleeping near her for the first time <br />
since entering the park. It was funny, Keith and Jackie had gotten used to her presence <br />
after this sort time every time they slept. It was once again just Keith, Jackie, and her tiny <br />
bundles of life inside her. It was crazy. So much had happened. To her and to so many <br />
others, since that day she gotten that free vacation package in the mail...</p>
