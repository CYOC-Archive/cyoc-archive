<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Eric stood at the pearly gates of Heaven. He looked on in wonder as he stepped through. Wisps of clouds floated by and the sun was shining around him as he was surrounded by beautiful naked people. Humans. He looked down to see his human form, also naked, before he began to look for a map or some sort of directions. He couldn’t wait to see Clyde again.<br />
<br />
After wandering for what felt like days, he found an official looking person, with gleaming white wings. He flagged them down. “I’m so sorry, but could you help me? I’m looking for my husband, Clyde. I thought he would be waiting for me.”<br />
<br />
The woman frowned and took his hand in hers. “Eric Laine. I’m sorry, but this Heaven is for <I>Human Souls</I> only.”<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
Eric woke in a panic as he tried to calm his ragged breathing. His lung capacity wasn’t what it once was, and it took him several minutes to recover, his heart pounding in his chest all the while.<br />
<br />
He’d been having the same recurring nightmare for years, though it seemed to be getting more and more common in the last month. He reached over to Clyde for comfort, but his hoof only found an empty space on the bed. He sighed as he recovered and rubbed his forehead before sitting up.<br />
<br />
<I>Soul.</I> <br />
<br />
That word had weighed heavily on his mind of late. He closed his eyes and focused, trying to calm himself from the rude awakening. He took his cane into his hands and traced his fingers across the intricately carved head—Clyde had made it for him when walking started to become a struggle. He&#39;d been using it for at least 30 years now.<br />
<br />
Finally, he got to his feet and walked out of his room, his cane making a light thudding sound. He took the stairs slowly and made his way to the living room. The house was quiet as he sat on the couch and leaned forward to pull the leather-bound book that sat on the table towards him.<br />
<br />
The book was beautiful, its cover stamped and patterned with leather and stitching. It featured a metal ring in the center, which was held in leather braided binding. He tapped the ring three times and held his fingers still.<br />
<br />
“I had that same dream again, Clyde.” He whispered to the ring, “You know the one… I hate it.” He sighed and sat for a moment as his eyes began to water. “I miss you, love. I miss you so, so much.”<br />
<br />
There was no response, but that was to be expected, of course.<br />
<br />
At the ripe old age of 156, Eric was the oldest reindeer on record. Whether it was being human-born, his connection to Santa, or just good genes, no one knew for sure. Clyde passed away 15 years ago now, at a respectable age of 144. He held on for at least 5 years longer than anyone had expected, despite his declining health, and Eric knew his reindeer had held on just for him. It made him feel guilty, but he couldn’t help but appreciate it. It had nearly killed him when Clyde passed, and he wouldn’t have made it if not for his expansive support system. Santa was a key confidant during that dark time.<br />
<br />
He wiped the tears from his eyes as he sighed and opened the book to look at the collection of pictures. In his old age he was getting very nostalgic, and he found himself poring over his album frequently. It had been a gift from his daughter, whose mate specialized in leatherworking.<br />
<br />
A beautiful exhibition of his life lay before him as he traced each one, remembering them vividly. A kaleidoscope of joy and sorrow: weddings he presided over as elder of the tribe, funerals of his loved ones attended by their many descendants, children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren, pictures from around the world in their many travels. Testaments to a life lived to its fullest.<br />
<br />
He laughed, remembering a particular trip to California in which Tag had met his eventual mate, Krista on the beach. She had played him like a fiddle as he tripped over himself in his efforts to woo her. It had taken a full year to convince her to finally move with him to the North Pole, but they were so happy.<br />
<br />
Another picture showed Tom, looking exhausted as seven small werefox cubs yanked at his tail and ears. He and Lars had made fantastic parents, all the while making great strides in expanding the resort, their efforts bearing fruit even to this day.<br />
<br />
He continued, pausing on the occasional picture as he relived the memory:<br />
<br />
The Mating Ceremony of Rudy and Clara’s firstborn, Mabel, who had been born the first year after Eric and Clyde were mated.<br />
<br />
Michael, heavily pregnant, sat surrounded by production equipment as Otso grinned at the camera. They had certainly filled out their small pack. And Reindeer Games had been quite the success, leading to expansive growth in the Tribes.<br />
<br />
The Mating Ceremony of his mother and his isä. After years of commuting, Bix had finally convinced her to join him as she made the transition. Eric had been the one to vouch for her in the Acceptance Ceremony.<br />
<br />
Pictures of him and Clyde in their many travels around the world, seeing everything they could. They had visited each of the sanctuaries across the globe and had been welcomed by their various Guardians. Evidently he’d made quite the impression on that fateful night.<br />
<br />
The picture the team took after his first successful Christmas Eve Flight… He touched the exhausted but smiling faces of him, Tag, Bix, and Clyde as he sighed wistfully. It had been so long since he had flown. Inspired, he set the album down and struggled to his hooves.<br />
<br />
He took a deep breath and willed himself into the air, jumping inches off the ground with great effort. He hovered briefly for a moment, sparks drifting from his hooves before he came crashing down, falling back into the couch with a loud thud and a laugh.<br />
<br />
“Isä?! Are you alright?” Rudolph the Fourth, Clyde and Eric’s firstborn, came rushing down the stairs looking concerned, the red glow of his nose preceding him. Rudy’s disappointment at not passing his gift had been potent but short-lived, as Marjatta reminded him how long he had waited to have foals. He made a wonderful uncle and mentor.<br />
<br />
“I’m fine. You don’t need to worry, son. I’m just being a silly old fool.” He called back in perfect Finnish as Rudolph came to sit beside him, still unsure. In the end, Eric had decided to bear their first two children, Rudolph and Hanna. Clyde bore their third, Nikolas, named after his godfather, Santa.<br />
<br />
He put an arm around his son, who had stayed the night. His kids were on a rotation, insisting to make sure at least one of them slept over each night so Eric wouldn’t be alone in case something happened to him in his old age. Rudolph didn’t look convinced, so Eric reached forward to pull the album towards him once again. “Did I ever tell you about the trip your father and I took to celebrate my graduation from CVU?”<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
Eric rested in bed after a long day filled with family and friends. He didn’t have the energy he once had, and he was exhausted. Great-grandchildren sure took it out of him. He turned to look at the door as he heard clomping approach before Hanna’s face peeked in. “Isä, you have a visitor. Are you feeling up to it?”<br />
<br />
He groaned and pushed himself up on the pillow into a reclining position. “Yes, my dear. Please send them up.”<br />
<br />
Soon after, Santa ducked into his room with a bright smile. “Hello, Eric. How are you feeling, Old Friend?” He crossed to sit on the bed as Eric smiled.<br />
<br />
“Tired,” Eric admitted, “But grateful.” They spoke in English, and Eric had developed an accent over the years. “To what do I owe the pleasure of your visit, Kris? You must be very busy with preparations.”<br />
<br />
Santa nodded. “I was in the area, and wanted to check in on you.” Eric simply smiled and patted his hoof on Santa’s hand. <I>Santa was always in the area, only living half-a-mile away.</I> He didn&#39;t press it further.<br />
<br />
They sat in silence for a bit before Eric spoke what was on his mind. &quot;Kris, what lies in the beyond?&quot; He asked finally as Santa gave him a look that said he&#39;d been expecting something like this. <i>Santa always knew.</i><br />
<br />
&quot;You had the dream again.&quot; It wasn&#39;t a question. &quot;I&#39;m not sure, to be honest. But I can assure you that whatever it is, your Clyde is there waiting for you. And he can&#39;t wait to see you again.&quot; This wasn&#39;t the first time they&#39;d had this conversation.<br />
<br />
&quot;But what if he&#39;s not where I&#39;m going? What if I can&#39;t be with him because of...&quot; <i>It hurt too much to verbalize.</i><br />
<br />
Santa leaned forward to take Eric&#39;s cheek into his hand. &quot;Eric, my boy. In the vast expanse of the Cosmos, I know very little. But I know enough to say with a <i>certainty</i> that you are as much of a <i>reindeer</i> as I have ever seen, despite what you came into the world as. And a hell of a good reindeer at that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric nodded, his eyes watering. &quot;I miss him, Kris. Every. Single. Day. My soul aches without him.&quot; Santa simply leaned forward to pull Eric into a tender hug. He knew no words would be enough so he simply ran his fingers through the old reindeer&#39;s fur as Eric sobbed into his chest for a time. Eventually, Eric sniffed and pulled back to wipe his tears. &quot;I&#39;m sorry. I just...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, Old Friend. You <i>never</i> have to apologize to me.&quot; Santa smiled and thought for a moment before looking up at the antlers which were mounted above the bed. He stood up to gently take the multicolored rope from where it was displayed before folding it and returning to give it to Eric.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Eric choked out. <i>Santa always knew.</i><br />
<br />
&quot;No. Thank <i>you</i>. For everything.&quot; He pulled Eric forward and gave him a kiss on his forehead. &quot;I should be getting back to the Workshop. Get some rest, Eric. Adieu, Old Friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
After Santa left, Eric sighed and laid back into the bed as he traced his hooves along the fabric of the ceremonial rope. Santa always had a way of making him feel better. He felt at peace, and he was so tired.<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
Eric woke in a field of glittering snow. He snorted and got to his hooves as he looked around. The impossibly green trees stretched into the deep cerulean sky. It took him longer than it should have to realize how easily he had stood up, his body spry and full of energy. He jumped and kicked for a moment before stopping suddenly. He wasn&#39;t alone.<br />
<br />
A reindeer stood not far off, watching him. Its ear twitched as its eyes sparkled in obvious amusement. It pawed at the ground.<br />
<br />
<i>Clyde.</i> <br />
<br />
Eric would have recognized him anywhere.<br />
<br />
They sprinted towards each other before snorting and nipping at each other&#39;s muzzles and flanks, spinning in the snow as they brushed up against each other blissfully. Eric&#39;s heart sang as they rested their heads together, eyes closed. <i>Soul Mates. Reunited at long last.</i><br />
<br />
Suddenly Clyde snorted and tore off. He stopped at the edge of the clearing, looking back to Eric as though beckoning him to follow, which he did immediately. They ran through the bright forest, kicking up snow and grunting gleefully as they saw other reindeer in the distance. They passed a pair of wolves as they ran, and a small group of white foxes.<br />
<br />
Trees whipped past as they continued to sprint, the wind rushing through their antlers. Up, up the mountainside as the other animals looked on. Eric leapt over rock and boulder, branch and fallen tree as he kept pace, relishing the rush of wind and his energy restored. He felt like he could run forever.<br />
<br />
They neared the zenith and instead of slowing, they sped up. Finally at the top, Clyde leapt into the air as Eric followed without a second thought and they were airborne, soaring above the trees. His reindeer looked back to him with a familiar glint in his eye as Eric bellowed.<br />
<br />
The two reindeer chased each other into Eternity.</p>
