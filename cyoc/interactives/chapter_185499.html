<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>I got some feedback from StrangeDisparity so we&#39;ll see what happens with the next few sections.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Oh my god! Fuck yes, give it to me!” Haylee squealed as the bed rocked underneath her, loudly creaking with each pistoning motion of her boyfriend.<br />
<br />
“Haylee!” Ethan whispered with a harsh edge as he lobbed a pillow at her head without interrupting his stride. “You got to keep it down. You’re going to wake up my parents.”<br />
<br />
“Mmm!” She moaned into the pillow before looking up at him with a slutty smile on her face. “I can’t help myself, Ethan. Is it my fault that my boyfriend is packing something impressive and knows how to use it?” <br />
<br />
He slyly smirked as his pace built up, pistoning faster and faster into her pussy. “Easy with saying things like that, Haylee. You’re going to give me a big head.” <br />
<br />
“Too late, Big Guy,” she swooned as she sagged back onto the bed and luxuriated on it. She could feel her pussy getting stretched in length and width by that eight-inch dick. She glanced down at her crotch, watching with rapt attention as he plowed her hole, his impressive dick sticking out from the fly of his red and black jockstrap. She reached forward, pulling on the straps before letting them go to make a satisfying snap against his taut thighs. “Aww, I’m getting close, Ethan, fuck me into next Tuesday!”<br />
<br />
He whispered in a husky voice, “your wish is my command.” He grinned into his words as he rolled with his hips before bringing his big hands on her waist. Then, he started jerking her bottom back and forth in tandem with his thrusting movements. <br />
<br />
“Oh fuck, yes! I’m going to….” Haylee trailed off into nonsense babbling as her pussy began to make a squelching sound as Ethan’s dick continued pounding in and out. The look of total contentment on her face made Ethan groan in mutual pleasure. <br />
<br />
------------<br />
<br />
“Phew, man, that was amazing,” she sighed, and Ethan, being completely breathless, merely nodded his head in agreement as he tried to catch his breath. “Well, let’s make sure you’re taken care of, stud,” she crooned as she scooted back, causing the hard-on to slowly slip out from her pussy. When its whole length slipped out, the head made an audible pop before bobbing in the dim morning, its surface shimmering with lube and her fluids. <br />
<br />
“Oh, you don’t have to worry about that, Haylee. I’m all good,” Ethan blushed as his voice cracked, entering its adolescent register. He rubbed the back of his neck self-consciously.<br />
<br />
She raised an eyebrow and bent down to inspect his package. She reached for the shaft, and with a sharp twist, it popped off. She fished it out from the jockstrap, revealing its latex balls, which shifted in her grasp. She threw the dildo over her back, put her fingers to the hem of the underwear, and pulled down. Doing so revealed a few things: the jockstrap had previously rested over the harness he used to support the impressive dildo. But more importantly, she noted that the little nub throbbing under the harness oozed with cum, which connected to the bottom of the underwear, which was now a darker shade and even producing a few drops of off-white cum. <br />
<br />
“Well, look at that,” she marveled at the little guy before poking at it with curious fingers and giving a gentle tweak, which caused Ethan to shudder with pleasure and make an additional spurt of cum. “I do believe this is the first time you’ve cum hands-free. What brought that on?”<br />
<br />
Ethan smirked as he rubbed his little foreskin back and forth, getting it to sit just right on his little guy’s swollen head. “Well, you just looked so turned on, I couldn’t help getting turned on too. And with the underwear rubbing me as I was working you over, I was getting plenty of stimulation. Did it feel good for you, too?” Ethan asked as he cocked his head to the side.<br />
<br />
Haylee beamed as she explained, “while it’s nice to get a decent stretch in once in a while, the reality is, this…” she effortlessly cupped one of her dainty hands over his tiny package; before giving it a loving pat, “is what satisfies me.” Her smile flat-lined as she asked him seriously, “do you miss it?” She emphasized the question by picking up the dildo, flopping it a bit, and considering its jiggling length.<br />
<br />
He shrugged his shoulders with a casual aloofness. “I mean, the idea of it was nice. But,” he started listing his reasons off with his fingers. “I’m a swimmer; having an eight-inch dick wasn’t conducive for that. It’s a distraction. And besides, I wasn’t rocking with big dick energy. I mean, can you imagine me flaunting the goods, even if I had them?”<br />
<br />
Haylee’s eyes went wide as she unconsciously started laughing before she caught herself, “sorry, I’m not laughing at you, Eth. I’m laughing at the idea of you flaunting the goods. I can’t even imagine it.”<br />
<br />
He spread his arms wide as if to say, ‘exactly.’ “That’s my point. This,” he gestured to his tiny pecker, which throbbed with contentment, “is a part of me, and I like myself this way.”<br />
<br />
“For sure,” her smile deepened as she asked, “and how about Eric, does he have any regrets over this?”<br />
<br />
“Hah!” He rolled his eyes, “there’s a kid with big dick energy by the bucket loads. He acts like he was born with it. And hey, if it makes him happy, I’m not going to complain.”<br />
<br />
She frowned as she crossed her arms, “have you guys talked about this recently?”<br />
<br />
Ethan frowned in kind and raised an eyebrow, “not since the ring stopped working. Why?”<br />
<br />
“It’s just that you’re going away to college, all the way on the other side of the country.”<br />
<br />
Ethan rolled his eyes and laughed, “so are you. You’re coming with me. Unless you’re getting cold feet?<br />
<br />
“No, no, it’s just, we’re going to be gone a long while, maybe even until next May. You might want to check in with Eric and make sure he’s still good with all this. Otherwise, he’ll be stuck this way until we come back.”<br />
<br />
“Oh…” Ethan said with a hint of dread, “I mean, I guess I’ll ask.”<br />
<br />
“Perfect, and Ethan,” Haylee blinked her eyes sweetly.<br />
<br />
“Yes?” He looked slightly alarmed.<br />
<br />
“Do you need to use the bathroom?”<br />
<br />
“Not especially so.”<br />
<br />
“Good,” she sighed as she slipped out of bed, grabbed her cap and gown, and sashayed into the bathroom, closing the door with her butt before locking it. “Because I’m going to need some time to put myself together, we’re graduating in a few hours.&quot;<br />
<br />
“Fuck!” His eyes went wide as he hopped out of bed and went to the door, rapping it with his knuckles. “Hey, let me in! I still got to take a shower, can’t we share?”<br />
<br />
Her laughter echoed behind the wood, “a girl’s got to have her privacy, don’t worry, I’ll be sure to come out and leave you just enough time to get ready if you work for it.”</p>
