<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Well...&quot; said Willis, after carefully thinking for several minutes, &quot;TOGETHER, we might be <br />
able to escape from the trailer. I mean, we are both pretty damn strong, aren't we?&quot;<br />
<br />
Zack had moved up to Willis, his large, firm chest pressing against Willis' back, his huge <br />
arms wrapping lovingly around Willis' waist as his bovine-head had come to rest on Willis' <br />
muscular right shoulder. &quot;I'm afraid.&quot; Zack whispered softly, his tail swishing behind, and <br />
Willis' understood why. The minotaur pressed warmly against him use to be a young man, <br />
and still was in heart and spirit; worse yet, it was Zack's own crazy father that was driving <br />
the truck towing their trailer, taking them to god-knows-what freak-show.<br />
<br />
Willis could feel more than just Zack's huge chest pressed against his back, the large, <br />
impressive, hairy sheath of the other bull-creature was forcefully parting his butt-cheeks <br />
due to its great width, and was resting snuggly between them, pleasurably  warming his <br />
sphincter.<br />
<br />
Zack didn't shown any sign of arousal, but it was difficult for Willis to concentrate with <br />
Zack's entire front-half pressed so tightly against his own back-half; and, sweat had <br />
begun to hotly wet the contact surfaces between them, including Zack's sheath and Willis' <br />
butt-hole.<br />
<br />
Willis reached a large hand up and idly stoked a tuft of hair between Zack's horns on top <br />
of his head, causing the young bull-man to &quot;mmmmm,&quot; calming him...and inducing other, <br />
unexpected effects as well.<br />
<br />
Outside, Willis could hear the trailer beginning to slow, just as he felt Zack suddenly grind, <br />
gently his full sheath between his butt-cheeks against his sphincter, causing him to moan <br />
loudly in pleasure. Also, something extremely large was beginning to slither up the small <br />
of his back, Willis could feel it, the forearm-thick object widening and extending between <br />
their tightly pressed bodies. This quickly caused his own bull-hood to start to awaken as <br />
well.<br />
<br />
Pushing his back as firm as he could against Zack's, Zack moaning, his extending cock <br />
trapped between their taut flesh. Willis whispered, &quot;Ugh...control yourself Zack. We're <br />
going to miss our opportunity.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...&quot; said Zack, his muzzle giving Willis' face a sloppy kiss, &quot;Just...I didn't get to cum, <br />
like you, back at the barn. My balls feel really, really full.&quot;<br />
<br />
Willis smirked best he could with his bullish face, and reaching around, giving Zack a <br />
playful slap on his rock-hard, muscular ass, he broke free from Zack's embrace.<br />
<br />
Turning around, Willis gripped the nearly erect organ protruding up from Zack's sheath, its <br />
length and girth freakishly impressive in its own right due to Zack's former human <br />
proportions. And, giving it a few, teasing strokes, Willis shook his head. &quot;Gotta wait, kid.&quot; <br />
he told Zack, even as Zack's bull-man's dick spewed a thick, gooey wad of precum onto <br />
Willis' fingers as he let out a needful groan.<br />
<br />
The trailer abruptly came to a jerking halt, sending Willis right into Zack, Zack's swollen <br />
bull-hood once more pleasurably squeezed between them. Outside, they both could hear <br />
farmer O'Grady getting out of his truck, and then several mutters from him...<br />
<br />
&quot;Lousy tail...&quot; Willis heard him say, &quot;Good thing this overall hides just 'bout anythin'...and <br />
ma' straw hat should hide these damn horns too. Don't wanna show 'em off before tha' <br />
show.&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly, a loud, painful bang echoed through the horse trailer's metal wall. &quot;You be good <br />
in there, you two.&quot; Zack and Willis heard farmer O'Grady say with a mean, half-chuckle,&quot;No <br />
tom-foolery. And no MESSIN' around. Don't want that trailer lookin' like ma' barn! Keep <br />
your hands off your privates, Zack! I saw what you use to do to your bedsheets. Don't need <br />
that magnified five-fold.&quot;<br />
<br />
If Zack could have blushed, he would have, his gaze lowering to the enormous organ <br />
pressed between his body and Willis', and his huge, pendulous balls full to the exploding <br />
point with his desperately wishing to be released seed. &quot;God, I'd probably coat the whole <br />
trailer, if you'd just let me cum.&quot; he whispered in Willis' ear. Causing the other minotaur to <br />
snort, and laugh softly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shhhh.&quot; Willis cooed, composing himself and listening intently for framer O'Grady.<br />
<br />
Just barely, Willis managed to hear him enter the gas station's diner that they must be <br />
stopped at, O'Grady's faint voice shouting for someone to bring him a &quot;cup of joe&quot; and <br />
some &quot;steak and eggs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, now's our chance.&quot; Willis insistently boomed, turning his back to Zack and pushing <br />
against the horse trailer's massive, locked doors. &quot;Come on!&quot; he shouted to his minotaur <br />
lover behind him.<br />
<br />
There was a brief pause, and Willis could feel Zack's massive cockhead, that must have <br />
been lowered, brush longingly against his sphincter, smearing sticky, warm precum all <br />
over it, before there was a frustrated sigh from Zack behind him.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK.&quot; said Zack hoarsely, &quot;But, I gotta blow the moment we get out. It won't go down <br />
otherwise this time, I think.&quot;<br />
<br />
Together, they pushed with all their might against the trailer's doors, the metal groaning <br />
beneath their huge weight and bulging, inhuman muscles. Finally, with a loud, <br />
clanging&quot;POP&quot; the door gave way, causing Willis and Zack and tumble onto the ground.<br />
<br />
Standing up, Willis looked around to determine where they were. The sun shown bright <br />
overhead, intermixed with clouds that lazily passed over it. All around them there were <br />
huge, freight trucks. Clearly farmer O'Grady had stopped at some popular truck-stop <br />
along the way to wherever they were going to get gas and some food.<br />
<br />
No one could be seen, so Willis grabbed Zack's arm, which was being used to busily stroke <br />
himself, and begin to drag them through the trucks.<br />
<br />
Finally, they broke free from the densely parked trucks, and fell into a tall, lengthy field of <br />
wheat.<br />
<br />
Sitting down, resting there, covered for the moment by the wheat, Willis looked over at <br />
Zack.<br />
<br />
Zack was positioning his cock against his lips, ready to try something that he had <br />
wondered just a day ago whether Willis ever did, his balls were churning heavily in their <br />
smooth, brown sack, begging for release.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go ahead.&quot; said Willis, smiling somewhat and beginning to feel aroused himself again, <br />
&quot;But hurry up, we got to get movin'. I don't know where we are, or where we'll go for <br />
shelter...but I don't think the forest is anywhere close by anymore. We need to get our <br />
bearings and start making our way back home.&quot;</p>
