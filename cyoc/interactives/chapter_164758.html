<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Andy could not really bring himself to explain how all this was happening or why, and what could&#39;ve shortened his hair, broadened his build, or made him so talented with the sword, but he knew he was going to have to get to the bottom of it eventually. And he also started to realize that Morgan seemed to have some hand in him realizing this. She&#39;d...done something. He rubbed his eyes a bit and looked at Holland, &quot;Have you...noticed anything awry as of late?&quot;<br />
<br />
Holland looked around and nodded, but did seem quite impatient, &quot;Why are you worrying this much about it? Sure I&#39;ve noticed these things around the ship, and I have noticed your newly muscled physique, but can you say it&#39;s really a negative? Come on man, let&#39;s have some fun tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andy didn&#39;t know how wise that was, and he looked aside, &quot;Holland, I don&#39;t know about this. We&#39;re...different from how we were when we came in here. And I don&#39;t know how much more---&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t be such a wet blanket!&quot; Holland said with a chuckle as he lightly jabbed Andy&#39;s shoulder, &quot;Come on. Didn&#39;t you say earlier you wanted to relax and have a good time? Well, maybe something&#39;s happening. Maybe it&#39;s not. But stressing over it&#39;s just gonna make you miserable. Let&#39;s go back to the room and have a good time tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I dunno man...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Andy, Andy.&quot; Holland put a hand on Andy&#39;s shoulder and guided him aside, saying to him, &quot;You&#39;re on vacation, remember? It&#39;s all for fun. Even if we end up a...bit different, I don&#39;t think anything&#39;s gonna be that bad. You&#39;re out here to have fun, remember?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Andy replied, remembering all the shit that he left behind on the mainland, Lucy and her nagging and the job that he barely enjoyed any more, &quot;Yeah you&#39;re right. Let&#39;s just...go enjoy ourselves. I&#39;ll try and keep watch, but I&#39;m done being miserable.&quot;<br />
<br />
----------<br />
<br />
As the day turned into evening, Andy went out to go bring some drinks and food back into the room for the evening, a whole pack of beer and a pair of wine bottles for the obligatory drinks. He was still feeling odd about the whole thing, but he decided he was just going to go full on into the &quot;party&quot; tonight and try and enjoy himself. Put it all out of his mind until he could really get work done on it. Besides, everything that happened was fun and it wasn&#39;t like he minded being this ripped and masculine looking.<br />
<br />
As Andy returned to the room, he heard a telltale sound and smirked a little bit. He looked around at the bed area and found Holland cock deep in a blond, buxom young woman who had probably seen him and taken interest. &quot;Brought some drinks, Holl!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oof....ahh, great, great Andy! Ooh, you wanna jump in?&quot; Andy walked over after dropping off the drinks and it seemed the woman Holland was fucking wasn&#39;t exactly all that displeased by the audience or the sudden entrance. She was entirely too into the sheer enthusiasm and skill Holland was employing during sex.<br />
<br />
Andy replied, &quot;Nah, no thanks, I&#39;ll keep out for now. Looks like you two are having fun though.&quot; He walked over and observed a bit, fistbumping Holland mid-thrust.<br />
<br />
The woman moaned and said, &quot;Ohh, come on...he&#39;s so amazing...!&quot;<br />
<br />
Andy chuckled, &quot;Yeah, I can tell. Go get &#39;er, champ!&quot; Andy said and outright slapped Holland&#39;s ass, pushing him deeper into her and making the woman let out a moan in response again. Holland himself gasped and seemed to stare for a moment and then kept going, thinking nothing of it. Andy himself just looked at his hand and chuckled, figuring he was just getting with the picture of their little party.<br />
<br />
Andy swore as he started to head out to go get some food that it looked like Holland was somehow smoother, was his back slightly less broad? It was slight, but with how built Holland was, it was noticeable. Andy shook his head and headed out.<br />
<br />
-------------<br />
<br />
By the time Andy got back with a few bags of food for the night, he heard a different set of moans and groans. He checked in and saw that Holland was kissing and making out at present with no less than Allan, and the woman from earlier remained around, eagerly observing the make out session proceeding into sex going on. Allan had his shirt off already, and Holland was eagerly feeling him up and groping his ass. Andy dropped off the food and sat next to the woman.<br />
<br />
She remarked, &quot;Guy on guy is so hot, am I right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Andy couldn&#39;t bring himself to say anything in response, he just gawked and let his mouth hang open, looking at her, clad in just her panties, and then over at the stirring scene of all out sexuality occurring just on the opposite bed. Andy swore the weird scale-like things on Allan&#39;s body seemed to be coming out across his body. They didn&#39;t cover him totally...<br />
<br />
Then Andy was made aware of the woman as she brought him into a kiss, &quot;You agree, right?&quot; And then Andy was left kissing her, hungrily moving in to indulge his own sexual needs. You know what, he decided, fuck observing for the night. I&#39;m gonna get laid, drink, and make merry!<br />
<br />
Andy moved in more aggressively, taking off his shirt and throwing it to the side. He started kicking off his pants as well as he heard the woman in front of him giggling and gasping as he felt up her breasts with eager but practiced hands. Lucy never vocalized or enjoyed it this much! Fuck her! Andy grinned and slid down his boxers, revealing a thicker, stronger tool than what he remembered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohh, you&#39;re so big and so...so vital!&quot; She guided him into her snatch, and Andy started thrusting slowly, easing her into taking him into herself, groaning as he felt himself sliding in. His tool was naturally being lubricated due to the sex she had earlier with Holland. She was still aroused even from that!<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re...so wet, fuck you&#39;re great!&quot; He growled, pistoning his hips stronger and longer into her, feeling his strong, powerfully muscled body giving this his all. Andy couldn&#39;t let himself cum before Holland did. He had to show which of them was...was the man here. But as Andy watched Holland now filling Allan&#39;s ass, thrusting away, Andy couldn&#39;t help himself but enjoy the show.<br />
<br />
&quot;They are so hot...you&#39;re so hot...&quot; The woman beneath Andy commented, and he felt his thrusts get deeper and more desperate.<br />
<br />
Andy gripped the sheets and felt his body letting off sweat as he kept thrusting his cock, eagerly anticipating her putting her legs around him, keeping him in there. He couldn&#39;t help himself. He loved this, and he loved how strong and powerful he felt. He was relieved to hear Holland shout outloud, &quot;I&#39;m...I&#39;m cumming, Allan!&quot; And thus that gave Andy the validation he wanted. He was gonna cum after Holland did. Show him that Andy was...was skilled at this!<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohh fuck, fuck! I&#39;m cumming now too!&quot; Andy was dimly aware of the moans and almost screams of pleasure from the woman beneath him as he finished, her legs untangling from him as he became aware that she had cum herself several times during his pursuit of pleasure. He pulled himself up and out, wiping off his forehead. &quot;Fuck...&quot; Andy swore to himself as he looked down at her, &quot;You want a drink?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m...I&#39;m heading out. You&#39;re incredible...&quot; The woman got up and shakily got herself dressed again. She headed out, clothes stained by sweat.<br />
<br />
As Andy started getting a drink for himself, pouring up some beer to enjoy, he heard a knock at the door. Pulling on his boxers and finishing his drink, Andy checked the door to see another young woman - apparently Holland had made this a publicly known party on the ship. Andy welcomed her in, this one being a more tanned, dark brown haired woman with an athletic, capable trim body who looked pretty at home with this kind of party. He quickly gathered her name was Beth from Holland shouting his thanks for her coming by.<br />
<br />
And she as well didn&#39;t seem all that affected to see Holland and Allan bathing in the afterglow.<br />
<br />
Andy returned in after closing the door, looking to see Beth getting a drink for herself and looking at Holland and Andy. She asked, &quot;Would you boys be up for three or more?&quot;<br />
<br />
Allan crossed his arms and pulled himself up, sitting on the bed beside Holland, &quot;Doesn&#39;t seem disagreeable. Potentially getting to fuck Holland AND a hot young woman like you? Sign me up. You in, Andy?&quot;<br />
<br />
Andy contemplated for a moment. It looked like there was something about Allan and Holland he could sort of notice... but he decided not to stress too much about it.</p>
