<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Cradling his belly with one arm Ken walked to the nearest restroom. Without hesitation he went into the woman&#39;s restroom and was relieved to find that one of the stalls was empty. He&#39;d always been a bit effeminate and since beginning the hormone treatments necessary to allow him to become pregnant with his husband&#39;s child he&#39;d felt even more so. Going into the woman&#39;s restroom felt like the most natural thing for him to do.<br />
<br />
It had been strange at first, but at the same time liberating. Ever since he&#39;d been young he&#39;d enjoyed acting girlish, enjoying playing with dolls as opposed to action figures, letting his hair grow long and even dressing in girl&#39;s clothing and wearing makeup from time to time. Being pregnant gave him the excuse to truly explore his feminine side and James had been supportive of it the whole way through. In fact when they&#39;d first started dating James had mentioned that he&#39;d never been interested in a guy before and that being with him was like being with a woman, something that Ken had found flattering. When they&#39;d finally stopped hiding their relationship and made plans to get married James had agreed that Ken could wear a dress instead of a suit at the wedding. Respecting Ken&#39;s desire to be his wife James had been supportive of his going through the experimental treatment to become pregnant with their child. And that brought him to where he was now, eight months pregnant and feeling better than he ever had.<br />
<br />
He pulled down his pants, regretting wearing such a tight pair, even though he thought they looked cute and added to his look of &#39;mommy-to-be&#39; and then his panties, letting out a sigh of relief as his cock and balls flopped free. Since beginning the treatment, in an effort to fully embrace the experience of being a mother, he&#39;d taken to wearing panties. It had been exciting at first, one more visible sign of his desire to be a mother, but over time it had become a comfortable routine, except when things shifted and slid into uncomfortable positions. He&#39;d never before considered how well endowed he was, though he knew he was considerably larger than his husband, but the effort it took to tuck his cock and balls comfortably into his panties made it clear he was a lucky man for so very many reasons.<br />
<br />
He looked down at himself, unable to see his cock and balls over the swell of his belly. As much as he liked the feeling of well being that came with being pregnant, not to mention how wonderfully feminine it made him feel, he was looking forward to it being over. Just one more month he reminded herself as he felt a kick. Smiling, he rested a hand on his stomach, feeling the movement of his unborn baby girl. A particularly strong kick caused him to wince, that was one thing they hadn&#39;t warned him about being pregnant. Sighing to himself he pulled his panties back down and sat on the toilet. His aim had gotten worse as his belly grew and made things hard to see, until he&#39;d  accepted the fact that sitting down to pee was far easier. It also felt right, just like wearing women&#39;s clothing and thinking of himself as a mother.<br />
<br />
Once he was done he stood up, once again tucked his cock and balls into his panties, pausing for a moment to massage his belly, marveling at the life he was carrying inside him.<br />
<br />
Pulling his pants back up took considerably more effort than it would have eight months ago, but he managed just fine, having adjusted quite well to the state he was in. Satisfied that everything was back in place he adjusted his blouse, smoothing it down over his swollen breasts, yet another of the joys of hormones and pregnancy. He&#39;d always had a rather soft looking chest and slightly puffy nipples, but shortly after he&#39;d become pregnant they&#39;d begun to blossom into full fledged breasts, much to his delight. He&#39;d worn bras in the past, just to see what it would feel like and having to go bra shopping had been a delight, as had the way James had taken to playing with his breasts, massaging them as they grew from a scant handful to proper, full breasts, weighty and round. Recently James had needed to ease up on playing with them though, for they&#39;d grown increasingly sensitive to the point of tenderness and in the past few days too much stimulation caused small drops of milk to flow from his nipples, yet another sign that he was well on his way to being a mother.<br />
<br />
That was part of the reason he and James were going shopping today. He wanted to get a breast pump and some extra padded bras just in case. Once the baby was born he didn&#39;t want to risk there being any accidents.<br />
<br />
Satisfied that all was as it should be, he left the restroom and rejoined his husband. James greeted him with a quick kiss on the cheek and smiled, &quot;Feeling better?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ken nodded, &quot;Yes dear.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s good,&quot; James gave him a little hug, &quot;I still can&#39;t believe I&#39;m going to be a father.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s what you wanted,&quot; Ken smiled as James once again gave his belly a gentle rub, feeling their daughter kick, &quot;Just like I always wanted to be a mother. We&#39;re just so lucky that technology has come far enough in the past few years to make it possible.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hand in hand they entered the maternity store together. The woman at the counter blinked in surprise when she saw them, then recovered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, is there anything I can do to help you two?&quot; she asked, clearly trying not to stare at the unlikely pair.<br />
<br />
James frowned, but Ken quickly spoke up, as before doing his best to keep his voice soft and feminine, &quot;I think I need some padded bras and I was wondering if you could recommend a breast pump? She&#39;s going to be our first.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ken rubbed his stomach for good measure as the woman&#39;s expression went from confused to relaxed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course!&quot; she said eagerly, &quot;We&#39;re seeing more and more couples like you all the time and I think it&#39;s just wonderful.&quot;</p>
