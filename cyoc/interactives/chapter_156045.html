<br/>
Fair warning, long chapter. I just got on a roll. </div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Now, before you see your family, I just want to let you know I took some time to prepare them as best I could for the shock of it all.” Jeremy solemnly said to me. “That said, I suppose you can never really prepare anyone for a change as big as this – I imagine you are still having issues coming to terms with it, after all.” I nodded in agreement. “All right then, if you are ready, I’ll take you to the meeting room I set them up in – and just like I told them, if you need the assistance of any of our staff, to include our mental health counselors, we are at your disposal.” I nodded again. <br />
<br />
Jeremy then smiled, “OK! Well, that out of the way let me take you to them now.” I returned his smile. <br />
<br />
A short walk down the hall toward a small meeting room, he paused at the door while I took a deep breath. I have to admit, I was nervous as Hell. A thousand thoughts ran through my head, and I could picture a thousand outcomes of how they would take this – and most of them not well. But maybe that was just the pessimist in me, I needed to think more positively. After all, I was still alive – just in a different shell. <br />
<br />
Jeremy held the door open and ushered me in, a firm solid hand on my shoulder. The shock in Trisha’s eyes at seeing my new appearance was blatantly obvious. And to her left, sitting with a thick hoodie (that thankfully hid is physique) was my son Michael. Trevor wasn’t present, but I imagine him being two states away, getting here would take some time before I’d get to see him. <br />
<br />
Tears formed in her eyes as she stood and covered her mouth in utter shock, “Paul? Is that… is that really you?” she asked, with her voice shaking. <br />
<br />
“Yeah, Trish, it’s me…” Damn, I sounded so young. I moved toward her, and she stood as still as a statue, clearly unable to process this monumental change to her husband’s appearance (wait until she learns the rest of the story – I thought, disheartened). I actually had to look up to her, something I never had to do before in our entire marriage. I moved closer again with my arms out ready for her soft embrace, yet she continued to stand as still as a statue, her eyes wide in disbelief and… repulsion? No, the teenager in me was reading too much into her reaction, she was just trying to come to terms with this, and as Jeremy said, even I hadn’t fully come to accept it. <br />
<br />
“Please Trish…” I said, looking up at her, about to break down into tears myself. “It’s me, this is me now… All of this. I didn’t have a choice, but at least I’m still alive. I still love you. I’m still your husband.”<br />
<br />
At that, she fell into my muscular arms, heaving heavy sobs, and speaking so softly that I was barely able to hear her. “Thank God… Thank God… You’re alive… It’s just, just so much…”<br />
<br />
I softly stroked her hair, smelling the scent of jasmine and lavender in her thick auburn curls. That scent took me back, and in that moment, I wasn’t an 18 year old gay White jock. I was her 42 year old hubby of two decades of love and loyalty. “Yeah, I am Trish. And I’m not going anywhere babe.” I lifted her head from my thick built chest and looked deep into her green eyes, then she moved in for a kiss. The Paul in me was looking forward to this since I broke my coma, but the Thomas in me was repulsed – But there was no way in the world I could let her know that, that would just devastate her right now. <br />
<br />
So I returned her kiss the best I can, recalling the memory of the first kiss I gave her when we were dating in college, or the first kiss we shared as man and wife, or the first kiss I gave her as she held our first son for the first time. All of those memories seemed like another life – and I guess in a way, they really were. Paul didn’t exist anymore – at least not the Paul Trisha knew. I wasn’t really Thomas either, but now I was somewhere in between. I had all the memories of my Paul self, but I had the urges of my Thomas self. Eventually I would need to come to terms with that, and so would my family – But not now, this was the time for reunions.  <br />
<br />
We broke off our kiss, Trisha holding my body a little extra long, feeling the firm teen muscles under my tight polo shirt. If it wasn’t me in this body, I might actually be a little jealous. Though if I am being honest, I actually was jealous – even though I no longer had any sexual attraction to her, I was actually starting to get upset that she was being intimate with someone else, or at least another person’s body. But I did my best to push those thoughts out of my mind. I looked up at her again as she stood to her full height and smiled. She finally gave me a smile back, as beautiful as ever, even with the tears still streaking down her cheeks. <br />
<br />
I then looked over at Michael, who was silent through all of this, but I could tell by looking at him he had a thousand questions and wasn’t sure how to go about asking them. I looked into his gorgeous green eyes and saw him clench and unclench his firm manly jaw, as I saw his thick neck muscles twitch the whole time, trying his best not to cry. Either it was because he still thinks of me as his father and doesn’t want to show weakness, or he sees me as another boy just a little older than him and didn’t want to embarrass himself by crying in front of what he sees as a peer. <br />
<br />
“Dad?” He asked, in total disbelief. “Is that really you? Shit, you’re jacked!” He said, and started to crack up to cover the fact he started to cry. <br />
<br />
I looked down at my body and looked him in the eyes again, “Yeah, I guess I am now, huh?” then I started cracking up just to cover my tears. Trisha started to softly cry again, tears of joy judging by the big warm smile on her face. “C’mere Mikey, give your Dad a hug!” I said to him, and I’m ashamed to say, I had ulterior motives. The way Trisha was feeling up my new teen body, I wanted to do the same with Michael. He leapt up and practically jumped me. I held him tightly, caressing his back and reaching up to his firm wide shoulders as I nestled my head on the side of his neck – wanting so hard to just start kissing that sexy thick neck. FUCK! My dick was starting to get hard now, so I thought it best to break off the embrace and not make, well, all of this far more awkward than it already was. <br />
<br />
He looked at me with the sexiest smile ever, his thick lips framed nicely by his dark brown, almost black teen facial hair, tears wet on his handsome face. “Dad! I am so glad you are ok!” He then looked at Jeremy standing by the door, “Shit, can you get me a body like that?” He said and chuckled, “Right Dad? I’d kill it at State with a body like yours for sure!”<br />
<br />
Jeremy laughed, “Your Dad was a very special case. This isn’t something we can do regularly yet.” <br />
<br />
“I know, I know, I’m just playing. But DAMN, you lucked out Dad!” <br />
<br />
Ugh, the father in me should just take that as kindhearted praise and compliments, but the Thomas in me was having trouble taking this as anything other than Michael hitting on me, wanting me as much as I wanted him… I really need to get a handle on this! But try as I might, I flirted right the fuck back, “Michael, you look amazing! I think you are even bigger than the last time I saw you!” and I couldn’t stop myself, “Let me see those arms!”<br />
<br />
He whipped off his hoodie, wearing only a tight tank top under, clearly showing every bump and curve of his muscular Latino teen body. I watched every dark muscle tense and relax as he removed the hoodie and set it on the table in the room – I even caught a whiff of his masculine body odor as he lifted the hoodie over his head and saw the tufts of dark brown hair in his sexy pits. I swear I was so weak in the knees and I could have shot right then and there. God Paul… How far are you going to take this? Jeremy and Trisha are standing right there! Get a grip! But in the end, Thomas won out, or at least I let him win, I don’t really know, even to this day.<br />
<br />
“I’m definitely not as big as you are now Dad, but yeah, I’ve been training extra hard to get ready for State later this month!” He said as he triumphantly flexed his biceps. I couldn’t help myself, and I reached out and caressed them, gripped them tightly as he flexed even harder. My breathing was so shallow and rapid now I worried I might pass out. I tried to slow my breathing down and calm myself.<br />
<br />
“Wow, that’s impressive Mikey! Good work! You’re definitely going to win State!” I said, trying my best to reassert my proud father persona and trying to subvert the horny gay teen persona…<br />
<br />
But then Mikey took the next step and said, ”Your turn Dad, show me what you got now!” Well as tight as this polo was, it wasn’t going to come off anytime soon, so I just flexed with it on, ended up stretching the cuffs of the sleeves and I could actually feel it tear slightly. I had no idea how big my arms were then (I later found out they were a solid 18”, which was massive for someone only 5’4”). Michael reached out and felt them up, in much the same way I felt his before – which I’m sad to say was enough to make me shoot a load in my pants. <br />
<br />
Thankfully the CK underwear was fairly thick and the jeans were dark enough that nothing could be seen, but I got weak in the knees and I’m sure I visibly orgasmed much as I tried to hide it by not loudly moaning his name in sexual ecstasy as I wanted to do. “You OK Dad?” He asked, concerned. Likewise Trisha and Jeremy looked my way as well. <br />
<br />
“Uh, yeah… Just got a little faint is all, I need to sit down I think. Jeremy, can you get me some water please?” I asked, really just to get him to leave the room, embarrassed he might guess exactly what had happened after our previous conversation. <br />
<br />
“Oh sure! Does anyone else need anything?” He asked the room. <br />
<br />
Trisha politely nodded no, but Michael asked, “Can you get me a water too, please doc?”<br />
<br />
“Sure thing bud, be right back.” And then he left us alone. <br />
<br />
I reached down to my jeans under the cover of the tabletop, hoping to God my crotch wasn’t damp. And thankfully, it wasn’t. It probably helped I shot a massive load just a few minutes ago in the shower, otherwise, I am sure I’d be showing a huge cum stain all down my legs. <br />
<br />
Trisha spoke after a minute of silence, “I have so many questions, and I doubt you have answers to them since this is just as new to you as it is to us. But I’ll just ask this for now – Are you ok? Are you ok with this?”<br />
<br />
I hesitated a few seconds, trying to collect my thoughts. I looked to Michael who gave me a smile (Goddammit kid, stop that shit!) then I tried to focus on the question and looked back to Trisha. There was the woman I married, the love of my life – and now, try as I might to the alternative, I could only see her as a woman, a woman more than twice my age – the mother of the handsome stud sitting to my right. Focus… FOCUS! <br />
<br />
“I mean…” I started off, trying to figure out the right way to put this. “I didn’t really have a choice in this. I mean, I like this body – it’s definitely not horrible.” I said, and half-heartedly laughed to attempt to diffuse the tension. “But, there’s stuff…” I started to say, wanting to tell her everything, but I just couldn’t, at least not right now.<br />
<br />
“What stuff?” She asked, concerned. <br />
<br />
I could only look at her, I couldn’t even think of what to say then. Unfortunately, Michael chimed in with his teen smarminess – something I didn’t really need now at this moment, but it helped me avoid having to reveal everything.<br />
<br />
“Look at him, Mom – He’s my age, you’re gonna be a cougar!” He said, then cracked himself up. Well his Mom… my wife… And I were not laughing. He was right, after all, but that wasn’t the problem – if only Michael knew his Dad had the hots for him and not his mother… My WIFE… It was getting harder and harder to think of her as anything but this perfect Hispanic teen wrestling stud’s mother. <br />
<br />
She looked at him in shock he would even consider us having a sexual relationship – And yeah, if I was still heterosexual, that would be a concern that I am sure we would eventually work through in time. But this White teen jock wasn’t going to be fucking his mother anytime soon, especially since she no longer turned me on sexually. But even so, I still loved her, she gave me two sons, and stuck by me through thick and thin for the last two decades. She was a rare woman… And I had to admit, she deserved someone who would treat her as amazing as she was…<br />
<br />
It was apparent that wouldn’t be me anymore. I started to tear up at that thought. Our marriage was over and she didn’t even know it, and she didn’t know why. And I was too much of a wimp to tell her the reason. “Hey Trish, hon, I want our son to fuck me, I want him to pound me every night, I want to fall asleep in his sexy muscular arms and suck his hung teen dick until he fills all of my holes with his hot jock cum. Would you be OK with that?” Yeah, that conversation would go over like a lead balloon. Least of all how Michael would take that; to be honest, he’s never had a girlfriend that I am aware of, but he spent all of his free time practicing his sports or working out at the school gym or the local rec center on weekends and breaks. Sports, and training for sports seemed to be his sole and complete focus. <br />
<br />
… And yet the Thomas part of me whispered in my ear “He’s probably gay too, or at least curious and open to it. Remember the way he felt up your hard muscles, how he flirted with you, and the way he looked at you, eyes dripping with lust for your sexy teen body?”<br />
<br />
The Paul part of me vainly tried to justify it away as he was happy to see me alive and just curious about my new body. And unfortunately, Paul was getting more and more drowned out by Thomas. It didn’t help I could still smell Michael’s teen musk clearly as he had been sweating slightly in that heavy hoodie and now I could smell the scent of his sweat mixed with deodorant and body spray. Fuck, it was turning me the fuck on again. <br />
<br />
I shook my head, and said grimly, “No Michael, it’s not that.” I said, keeping my eyes locked on his mother’s eyes, “It’s just, well how different I am now. Not just the age, but I’m a White muscular teen,” leaving out ‘gay’ from the equation, “Which is about as opposite of what I was before as I can get while still being a male.” I sighed, “It’s just going to be a lot to adapt to… For all of us.” I said, finally looking down at my thick hands, clenched as they were tightly with one another.<br />
<br />
“Paul, it’s ok. We’ll take it a day at a time. We’re just so happy you’re still alive! Trevor is too. He’ll be here this weekend after his finals, and he’ll be staying through his winter break.”<br />
<br />
In all of this, I’d forgotten about Trevor, My first son, as proud as he made me getting his academic scholarship to the prestigious Cornindell University. I could no longer see myself as his father; He was just an older geeky kid who happened to be the brother of… Well, you get the idea. <br />
<br />
My mind was unraveling, my memories were still there, sure, but I no longer felt connected to them – like they were just images from some movie I saw once a long time ago. I still loved my family… Or maybe I was just fooling myself into thinking I did – As part of me no longer saw them as my family. I decided then and there I was going to need to talk to Jeremy about this, and probably their counselor too. I wasn’t exactly sure how I was going to discuss this with my family – but it was something I would need to tell them at some point, or I would just end up living in a loveless marriage and deluding myself that I cared about any of them deeply beyond my sexual desires for my own son. <br />
<br />
I looked at Trisha and smiled, as Jeremy returned with the waters for Michael and myself, then excused himself again, saying to come see him in his office when I was done meeting with my family. Meanwhile, we continued talking for another hour or more. I answered what questions I could, but otherwise, we just tried our best to catch up on what I missed during my coma. <br />
<br />
I couldn’t help but direct my focus to Michael most of the time, asking him about school, how training was going, what his competition looks like this year, and eventually, if he was dating anyone. By this point, his mother excused herself, saying she was going to try to find us some food as they were missing their usual dinnertime – And probably not wanting to hear about her son’s dating habits. He demurred and tried to deflect the question, “No, I don’t really have time to date, and besides, the girls at my school are all kinda, well, skanky.” <br />
<br />
“What do you mean?” I asked, genuinely curious. <br />
<br />
“They’re just, you know, skanks. They just want sex, no substance. I’m not really into that.” He saw the look on my face, “Yeah, I know, guys my age should be all about just sex, but I want it to be someone special, someone who gets me, someone who appreciates me for me. Ya know?” He said, with a quirky smile. <br />
<br />
I reached out and grabbed his hand, and held it tightly – Fuck, what was I doing? “Yeah, Michael, I know how that goes.” I looked him firmly in his amazing green eyes, “I won’t lie, this new body, it’s got me pretty horned up, I really really REALLY want sex…” I hesitated, trying to figure out where I was going with this, still holding his hand tightly, as I could feel him grip it back, “I just, well, it’s going to be awkward is all… now… because of this change.” <br />
<br />
I was sure he thought I meant the change of my body, rather than my sexuality. But despite him being a typical jock, he was smart enough to pick up on some things others miss. Maybe because he was also the silent type of kid that pays attention to what goes on around him. <br />
<br />
“Dad, I know…” Wait, what? How could he… “I get it… I really do…” He said, firmly gripping my hand back so tightly, even as stronger as my hands were, I could feel the tension all through my right hand. Then his fingers intertwined with mine. Was this really happening? I’m still having some sort of fantasy, right? “Is this… OK? Dad…?” He asked, gently pulling me towards him. I could only weakly nod, still not entirely sure what has about to happen or even if this was really happening… <br />
<br />
And then… He kissed me. My son kissed me. Michael kissed me with such a deep sensual passion that I felt like I was floating on a cloud – like no matter what I was going to be safe and protected. This young man, this teen who was created from my own seed almost 18 years ago, was going to take care of me from now on… <br />
<br />
My lips parted and welcomed in his tongue as he explored my mouth deeply, I returned the action and reached up to feel his firm muscular biceps and ran my hands over his tank top, feeling his sizable pecs and abdominal muscles as well. He did the same with me as best he could with my thicker polo shirt still on. I wanted to badly to strip us both naked and… Well, his mother might come back soon, so we could only go so far. <br />
<br />
We broke off our kiss, “Michael, you’re…”<br />
<br />
“Gay? Yeah, I’ve known it for a while now. I was afraid to tell you because I wasn’t sure how you’d take it. But when I saw how you were looking at me and how you were looking at Mom, I knew you were in the same boat.” I looked away, ashamed. <br />
<br />
“Were you always bi Dad?” He asked, curious. <br />
<br />
“No, it’s this new body. For some reason, I started having these thoughts about Jeremy… And then about you…”<br />
<br />
“The doc is pretty damn hot, no doubt – But he’s also clearly straight.” He said, with a laugh. <br />
<br />
“How do you know that?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“Dude, I know. When you are the quiet kid, you see stuff, you pick up on stuff.” He paused and gave me a goofy smile, “I have AMAZING gaydar!”<br />
<br />
“Gay what?”<br />
<br />
“Gaydar… It means I can tell when someone is gay or not just by how they act. That’s how I could tell you were gay right away. That and the way you were looking at me pretty much confirmed it…” He paused, “That and the fact you fucking shot a load as I was feeling you up!”<br />
<br />
“Oh my God! You knew?!”<br />
<br />
“Dude, I’m a teen, like you are now. You know how many times I’ve done the same shit during my meets? Thank God I wear a cup! But I’ve seen some of my opponents do the same while I have them in a tight hold too!”<br />
<br />
OK, I was starting to get turned on again, my mind was starting to cloud with lust, and his mom might be back at any moment. He realized that too. <br />
<br />
“Dad, it’s OK. It’s actually more than OK – Because I actually had one of the biggest crushes on Thomas Lancaster,” apparently the boy whose body I now possessed, “He was a legend in high school and was well on his way to being in the Olympics, if not for the accident he had. I was devastated when I heard he was in a coma, we met in passing once as their gymnastics meet was just finishing up as we were getting ready for our wrestling meet back in my sophomore year. I had no idea he was gay though! Even then in his junior year he was massive, and I had many many jack off sessions thinking about him…” Then he looked my way, “And now, my own fucking DAD has his body! His perfect sexy body.”<br />
<br />
His smile dissolved, then he got serious, “But, only if YOU are ok with this. I won’t lie, I want this SO bad, I’ve wanted this for years! But you ARE my Dad, somewhere inside that amazing body, you’re my father, so if you are not OK with this, just tell me, and I’ll leave it alone. But if nothing else, I hope you can be honest with Mom before too long that you’re not going to be able to love her like you used to. We both know she deserves that level of honesty. I know you don’t want to hurt her, but keeping this from her will hurt her just as much if not more than hiding it from her.” He heaved a heavy sigh. “Just think about it, ok? You don’t have to answer right now. But we’re still family no matter what, OK?”<br />
<br />
I nodded firmly, tears starting to well up in my eyes again. <br />
<br />
“Good! Now come here.” He said, pulling me into a big hug, giving me a quick kiss on the side of my neck, “Sorry, I couldn’t help myself. Damn, it’s so weird that you’re actually shorter than me now!” <br />
<br />
I pushed him away playfully, “Fuck you, only by a few inches!” <br />
<br />
“Still makes me taller, little guy!” He said, standing on his tip toes to exaggerate the effect. <br />
<br />
“Yeah, well I’m way bigger than you!” I said, flexing my massive teen muscles. <br />
<br />
He smiled, licked his lips, and started to feel me up again, “Yeah, that you are. But I swear I will get even bigger than you!” He said, as he pushed me away again, quickly flipping me around, pulling me to the ground, and then putting me in a full nelson, barely missing the table in the small space of the room. “Damn! If I can take you down, I’m definitely ready for State!”<br />
<br />
“No fair, you caught me off guard!”<br />
<br />
I could feel his hard cock through his gym shorts pressing into the middle of my back. He humped my back a few times just to get me riled up – And damn if it didn’t work! I was about to shoot another load when his mother came back in the room, looking down at the sight of her son and this teen boy entangled on the floor. <br />
<br />
“What the Hell is going on here?” She said with a smirk.<br />
<br />
“Nothing Mom, I just wanted to show Dad how ready I was for State!” He said, as he twitched his hard cock into my taut back muscles. I wanted so badly to cum right then and there, but I was too embarrassed and my hard on quickly dissipated, especially with his mom standing right there.  <br />
<br />
“Yeah, Michael is definitely ready.” I said, probably a little more lustfully than I intended, “Uh, for State. I can’t wait to see him in action.” I said, pushing my back against his throbbing boner emphasizing the last two words, making him grip me tighter in the hold until I could actually feel the precum through the fabric of his shorts, or maybe it was his own cum? Either way, I figured it best to cover for him, so when he released me, I blocked his mom’s view of him so he could take some time to adjust himself without alarming her. Michael quickly grabbed his hoodie, putting it back on (much to my teenage disappointment) but effectively covering his crotch area as large as the hoodie was on him. <br />
<br />
“Well, I couldn’t find anything open. Apparently they shut the cafeteria down after 7pm, so our only option is food from the vending machines. So I think Michael and I will go and hunt some food somewhere nearby instead. Do you want us to bring you back something?” Trisha asked. <br />
<br />
“Actually, I should be good, I haven’t been hungry yet today, maybe I’m still recouping from everything. I should be fine.” I replied. <br />
<br />
She nodded, “Well ok then. We’re going to head out, but I promise I will stop by tomorrow and bring Mikey with me tomorrow night. We’ll try to be here by 6pm so we can have a proper family dinner down in the cafeteria if that’s OK with your doctor. He said they will probably release you by Friday, so you can be home by this weekend and we’ll all go out with Trevor to celebrate your recovery!” She said with a smile. <br />
<br />
“Actually Mom, if it’s ok, can I borrow the sedan and I’ll meet you up here at 6? I just want to see Dad for a bit on my own after practice if that’s ok?” He said, looking at me with a devious smile that his mother didn’t pick up on.<br />
<br />
“Oh? Yeah, that should be fine. Unfortunately, parent teacher conferences tomorrow night, so I can’t get here sooner than that, but yeah, that should be fine.” Then she looked my way, “Do you want Mikey to bring you anything from home?”<br />
<br />
His sexy body and sweet lips? No, I didn’t say that, but honestly, nothing of my old stuff would fit this new body, and I no longer had any real sentimental connection to anything in that house… Other than Michael that is. Speaking of, he was about my size now, “Well, if Michael has any clothes like gym clothes he can spot me, that would be good. I think I only have this outfit or the hospital attire, so not a lot of options.” I was really hoping he might bring me something sweaty and well worn, or even one of his old singlets, even if it might not fit me – it would still be incredibly sexy to wear it around in private, or maybe with Michael one on one. “I wear size 7.5 shoes if you have some old ones?”<br />
<br />
He looked my way, thought about it, “Maybe my old wrestling shoes from freshman year? I think those might fit your new feet.” I was hard at the thought of wearing this sexy young man’s clothes and shoes, feeling the fabric and material on my skin like it was on his fucking sexy body, smelling his scent on my own perfect body...<br />
<br />
“Dad… Is that ok?”<br />
<br />
“Huh? Oh yeah, I’d be fine with that, they looked like they would be pretty comfortable to wear around here for now.”<br />
<br />
“All right, well I’m really happy you are ok and I can’t wait to have you back home Paul… I missed you so much these last few weeks.” She said, with a clear tone of sadness mixed with relief. <br />
<br />
“I missed you too Trisha, and I can’t wait to get back home too!” I said, trying to sound sincere, but knowing Michael picked up on my fakeness. She hugged me tightly and kissed me one more time. Michael looked away – jealousy or the awkwardness of it? <br />
<br />
Then he came up to me and gave me a tight hug as well, I could still feel his sizable cock press against my body, even soft. “Bye Dad, I’ll see you tomorrow after practice!”<br />
<br />
“Sounds good Michael, I look forward to it!” <br />
<br />
They started to leave, then Michael turned toward his mom, “Oh I forgot, I need to talk to Dad about something man to man I didn’t get to say before, can I meet you down at the car?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, yeah, sure honey. Don’t be too long, Mama’s starving!” Then she gave me a warm wave goodbye and left Michael and I alone in the room. <br />
<br />
He wasted no time pulling me tight into his body and kissing me deeply one more time, “I’m sorry Dad, I couldn’t resist. You’re just so fucking hot now!”<br />
<br />
“Michael, I’d be lying if I said I didn’t feel the same way about you.” I said, sliding my hands underneath his hoodie and into his gym shorts – He went commando! And his sticky teen wetness was present everywhere! I rubbed his soft cock as it started to harden in my hand (no it wasn’t as big as in my fantasy, but it was definitely bigger than the cock I had now), then pulled my hand out and brought my hand to my lips, licking and sucking every drop of cum from my fingers. It was his turn to get weak in the knees and he moaned, “Fuuuuuckk! That is so fucking hot Dad!” then he kissed me deeply once more, sharing his cum between us. <br />
<br />
When we broke off the kiss I looked up at him and said, “You know Michael, when it’s just us, it would probably be less weird to just call me Thomas. Calling me Dad, well, I’m less than a year older than you now, and while you look amazing, let’s face it, you didn’t come from this boy’s sperm after all.” I said with a laugh. <br />
<br />
“Yeah, you’re right, but I will definitely cum for that boy’s sperm!” He said, laughing at his own cheesy pun. I couldn’t help put join in. “OK, Thomas, I better go, my mom is waiting for me. But I can’t wait to see you again tomorrow!” He said, reaching into my tight jeans to squeeze my still once again hard teen cock. “And I will bring you some outfits I bet would look so fucking sexy on you.” He said, making his way to leave, “Oh, and I’ll come tomorrow in my singlet, straight from practice… I’m sure you’ll enjoy that, won’t you Thomas?”<br />
<br />
“I sure fucking will Michael!”<br />
<br />
“Good!” he gave me another quick kiss, “I’ll see you tomorrow, sweet dreams babe!”<br />
<br />
Babe? Holy shit! Am I really going to date my own son now? Well why not, I know him better than anyone else could, and I love him, even moreso now than I did as just his Father. <br />
<br />
“All my dreams will be about you, my sexy wrestler stud!” I said, giving him another kiss back. <br />
<br />
“Damn Thomas! I don’t want to leave, but ugh, I better go – Cuz if I don’t go now, I’m gonna want to do some bad stuff!”<br />
<br />
“Well save it for tomorrow, we’ll have way more time then.” I replied with a wink. <br />
<br />
“OK, until tomorrow. See ya Thomas!”<br />
<br />
“Bye Michael!”<br />
<br />
And then he left, leaving me to all the mixed up confusing thoughts. How the Hell was I going to unravel this all. Well for now, I needed to go find Jeremy’s office, and I can’t put it off, I was going to need to talk to their shrink, I just have to figure out how I’m going to broach the subject of wanting to have a sexual relationship with my own son… Even though I guess he’s not really my son anymore – Or was that just me deluding myself again?</p>
