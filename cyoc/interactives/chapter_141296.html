<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Aaron stared in awe at the mess his runty little brother had made with his big, 9” cock. Emphasis on ‘his.’ The older teen had to admit, he’d never seen himself get that excited to blow  a load, Kyle literally exploded all over the place! Aaron found it oddly arousing, seeing his little brother using his cock like that, but try as he might, the small dicklet growing out of his own crotch barely reacted.<br />
<br />
“I think… I&#39;m gonna do that again,” Kyle whooped. The younger brother flashed Aaron a toothy grin as he his small hands wrapped around his huge tool. Kyle’s whole body shuddered, his flesh extra sensitive post-orgasm. “Oh jeez, yowch!” Kyle whimpered. Aaron just chuckled and shook his head.<br />
<br />
“Just make sure you clean up afterwards or else Dad’ll kill you,” Aaron sighed, knowing all too well what leaving a cum-stained mess would entail.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, sure, after I…” Kyle moans, a stream of pre-jism oozing out of the tip of his girthy length.<br />
<br />
Aaron shakes his head and closes the door to his brother’s room, his little brother’s squeaky voice groaning inside, lost in the throes of self-pleasure.<br />
<br />
The next morning, Aaron awoke and automatically reached down to play with his…<br />
<br />
“Goddammit,” Aaron moaned, feeling the tiny, flaccid prick that greeted him down there. He was so used to waking up with a raging 9” morning wood that it had become habit to rub one out before school. Sighing, he sat up and to his shock, used the time to get some extra schoolwork done. Without the lusty thoughts and feelings in his loins, he was able to power through his studies in the small time before he got ready for school.<br />
<br />
When he went to the washroom to piss, Kyle was in there already taking a leak, wads of tissue paper dumped into the wastebasket. The brothers just gave each other knowing looks.<br />
<br />
“This big thing is awesome,” Kyle remarked.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, and it’s mine,” Aaron replied.<br />
<br />
“Hmmph, well, unlike you, I’m going to use it to its fullest!” Kyle huffed, shaking the head between his fingers to get all the piss out and struggled to get his new, hefty basket into the crotch of his jeans.<br />
<br />
Aaron just rolled his eyes and took a piss himself, considerably easier than before, now that he didn’t have to deal with the post-sex spray as he aimed into the bowl.<br />
<br />
Their parents had already left for work, but they had left a packed lunch for each of them on the counter. Aaron walked into the kitchen to see Kyle wolfing down four pieces of toast, loaded with peanut butter and jam.<br />
<br />
“Hey, that’ll make you fat, shorty.”<br />
<br />
“I’m real hungry,” Kyle snorted between bites, his big dick twitching his crotch. The small fry even began to load an extra couple of sandwiches into his lunch bag before heading out to catch the bus to middle school. Aaron shook his head wondering what kind of trouble that kid was going to get into with that big dick of his.<br />
<br />
For his part, Aaron found school a little easier than before. Without certain ‘distractions’ he was able to concentrate in class and you know… actually take notes, rather than fantasize about shacking up with a hot cheerleader. He didn’t think it was too bad, not until he got back home.<br />
<br />
“Hey, Kyle, you home?” he yelled as he entered the house. He didn’t get a response, but he did hear the audible clank of metal on metal coming from the basement. He descended the stairs and saw his little brother on their dad’s old weight set. Being so scrawny and short, Aaron had never had the urge to use it himself.<br />
<br />
“Sup, bro,” Kyle said cockily, muscling through a set of bench presses with just the bar. “We did weights today in PE and I gotta say, with this big cock of mine, it just felt good to use my body! Even popped a boner in class and Coach said it ‘uh, sometimes happens,’” the boy snickered.<br />
<br />
“Jeez, Kyle, you’re gonna have to learn to control that thing,” Aaron remarked. He just huffed and went back upstairs, leaving his little brother to push the small weights around.<br />
<br />
At dinner, Aaron had made a frozen pizza for the two of them, it was usually enough, considering they were both so small. But, Kyle ate ravenously, devouring three-quarters of the pie before demanding Aaron pop in another into the oven.<br />
<br />
That night, Aaron laid awake, staring at the ceiling as his little brother with a not-so-little package, lewdly and loudly fapped in the room next door. The older brother tried to get off himself, even managing to get his own tiny erection up after coaxing it, but he couldn’t get off, not with his marble-sized balls.<br />
<br />
The next morning, Aaron swore his little brother looked a little bigger. “What the heck is that on your face, little bro…” Aaron said as he prepared himself some breakfast. Small wisps of facial fuzz were growing out of Kyle’s chin and lip area. Kyle just shrugged and stole half of Aaron’s food before making a big meal of his own.<br />
<br />
Aaron’s day went much like the last, without his big dick and balls, his thoughts had become rather tame, and he focused more on his schoolwork than anything else. When he got home, his brother was already in the basement working out, grunting, snorting and roaring like a madman.<br />
<br />
At dinner, Kyle was looking noticeably swollen, his arms and chest seemed to fill his small shirt. “Man, you should’ve worked out while you had the chance, big bro,” Kyle remarked as he wolfed down over half a tray of pre-made lasagna. “This big dick and huge balls are getting me so jacked! Urrgh, can feel myself becoming a beast!” The small fry brought up his arms, the biceps bunching into small mounds. But more astonishing to Aaron was the small tufts of hair in his brother’s armpits. It seemed as if puberty was hitting his little brother hard now that his testosterone factories had practically grown 10x the size! And to drive the point home even more, as Kyle stood, Aaron noticed the gap between his underwear band and his shirt, a light dusting of body hair dotting the young man’s stomach. Aaron gulps as he realized he might not be the taller brother for much longer.<br />
<br />
The nightly routine only seemed to get even worse for Aaron. His brother’s grunts and moans were definitely getting lower. ‘Oh man… is this thing getting even bigger?’ he heard his brother posit to himself past midnight, the squelching of wet skin on skin audible through the walls. There was no way Kyle’s junk was getting bigger… Not unless… not unless his own puberty was compounding on top of Aaron’s already fully-grown cock and balls!<br />
<br />
The next morning, he got his answer. He walked in on his brother brushing his teeth. Kyle’s musculature had definitely grown, now looking like he played soccer or baseball, sinewy and strong. But the most obvious change was the huge dick bobbing at attention and leaking pre, distending the young teen’s briefs to the breaking point, seams already beginning to fray. There was no doubt about it, Kyle had definitely grown down there, his nuts even more obscene than before. Even semi-soft, Kyle’s cock was leaking pre through the strained fabric of his underwear. The younger brother smirked as he caught his brother staring, lifted his basket to let his heavy nuts and balls jiggle as gravity did its work.<br />
<br />
A sense of dread washed over Aaron for the rest of the day, wondering if his little brother was still growing.<br />
<br />
He went straight home after his last class and shuttered himself in his room. He tried to ignore the even lower and even deeper grunts coming from the basement. He kept to himself, skulking around the house when he knew the coast was clear. He avoided seeing his brother at all costs. He went to school late, just to avoid his brother.<br />
<br />
Over the week, Aaron noticed small changes to his own body. His body hair had stopped growing in, what facial hair he had had stopped as well, stuck in the patchy 5-o’clock shadow he had worn to the Madame Illusia show. The 18-year-old boy was just glad he wasn’t de-aging or anything like that. Though, without his normal production of testosterone, he was feeling slightly sluggish.<br />
<br />
But, try as he might to avoid his little brother, the weekend came up and he could no longer use school as a sanctuary to avoid his baby bro any longer. Wearily, he descended the stairs and what met him there shocked him.<br />
<br />
A veritable beast of a man was hunched over the kitchen table, scarfing down sausages, bacon and eggs like there was no tomorrow. He had to be at least 5’10” and while he wasn’t particularly tall, to Aaron’s short stature, he looked like a giant. The man smirked when he saw Aaron, his face masculine and sharp. Aaron could tell he looked young, despite the bushy beard growing out of his square jaw.<br />
<br />
“Oh my God, Kyle?!” Aaron whimpered. The guy smiled wide, giving the 18-year-old a wolfish grin.<br />
<br />
“’Sup, ‘big’ bro,” the guy chuckled, his baritone timbre shaking Aaron to his core. Broad shoulders and pecs filled Kyle’s shirt, hell even his abs were visible through the shirt, dark hairs even protruding through the fabric. The guy looked like he belonged on a college baseball team, easily 180-190 pounds of lean, sculpted muscle.<br />
<br />
“Jesus, I can barely recognize you!” the older, much less masculine, brother blurted.<br />
<br />
“Heh, guess I’m really putting your junk to good use,” Kyle chuckled back deeply. He grasped at his huge length, and Aaron gasped, looking at how obscenely large it had gotten. “Ah, it feels good to be big, bro,” he said dangerously, looking over his tiny brother, his loins stirring. “Say, the only drawback with all these hormones I got is I dunno how to shave, think you can show me, ‘big’ bro?”<br />
<br />
Aaron nodded dumbly and followed Kyle up the stairs, nervously checking out his baby brother’s sculpted asscheeks through his jeans. If Aaron could, he’d be sporting an erection right now. Aaron’s nerves only seemed to build as his 14-year-old god of a brother corralled him into the washroom and the locked the door behind them.<br />
<br />
He reached for the razor, but paused when Kyle’s strong hands wrapped around him. He stared into the mirror and saw the lustful look on his younger brother’s face, and the growing steel-pipe pressing into his back.<br />
<br />
“Uh, K-Kyle, what are you doing?” Aaron whined, freezing in place as he felt Kyle’s beard and lips brush against his neck hungrily.<br />
<br />
“What’s it look like, little guy?” Kyle snarled, spinning his brother around to be face to face. He leans down, and presses his lips to his brother’s.<br />
<br />
“Augh! Sick!” Aaron yelped, pulling away. “C’mon, Kyle, this isn’t you! Think back to when you first got a boner over those pretty women.”<br />
<br />
“Rrgh, maybe. But the other boys at school started calling me a &#39;faggot.&#39; Apparently, all the guys that go to Madame Illusia’s are. And I gotta say, ‘big’ bro, the more I stare at my hot body, the more I believe it.” The younger brother brought up an arm and gave it a huge flex, the sleeve blowing out as his massive bicep and triceps explode in size. “I’m not angry they called me names, after all, it may be true, and Madame Illusia did help me become the biggest 8th grader the school’s ever seen! And I made sure those dumbasses learned that the &#39;hard&#39; way,” Kyle snickered. The big man in a 14-year-old’s body pushed his brother to the wall, pinning him easily. Aaron yelped as Kyle pulled down the band of his underwear, unleashing a gargantuan 11” member that slapped Aaron in the ribs, spreading a large smear of pre-seed all over the older brother.<br />
<br />
“See how big I’m getting? And this is just the first week of growth, ‘big’ bro!” Kyle chuckled lewdly, pushing his brother’s head down and onto his hungry cock. “Oh, YEAH!” he roared as he forced his older brother to service him.<br />
<br />
This was going to be an awesome month for one of the brothers…</p>
