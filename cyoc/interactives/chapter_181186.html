<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brad had talked a big game, but now that he was in the final stretch he really didn&#39;t know if he actually could follow through. Terry being right there was a really big motivator considering their history, all the things that happened, and their rivalry - plus all those rumors - but Brad just couldn&#39;t find it in himself to make it those extra inches to the top of the bar. He grunted and groaned, neck straining and veins showing in full. Brad was determined, bound and determined, to show that he could do this without a spot...but there was only so much that his determination could do.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, if you need a spot just---&quot;<br />
<br />
That was Terry, the eternal worry wort just being himself. Too nice for his own good. One day Brad told himself he was gonna show up Terry. Show that he was the top player on the football team. Brad was about to cave, to finally admit he needed assistance however in the face of reality when something curious happened. Brad felt a strange tingling sensation race down his arms, through his shoulders and chest, and he grunted - feeling his strength suddenly redouble. His body was feeling just a little bit stronger outta nowhere. It was like he had just had one last bit of reserve strength left.<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t look the gift horse in the mouth, even as he failed to notice his quads and lower stomach growing slightly hairier. He pushed the weight all the way up to the top, and racked it, letting out a triumphant shout as he stood there, muscles burning. He had never felt so good before. Brad could almost feel his lower quarters surging to life from how nice it felt to achieve something like that. And honestly, Brad didn&#39;t mind.<br />
<br />
Because in that instant, he had won. Terry had assumed he needed a spot - and Terry was wrong.<br />
<br />
Terry himself just crossed his arms and chuckled, &quot;Wow, looking pretty good there. I&#39;m...surprised. Didn&#39;t think you&#39;d pull through.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you doubted me!&quot; Brad chuckled, stretching a bit as he got ready for his next exercise. He looked over at Terry. The dude was unquestionably handsome in a rather manpretty way. The gelled back ginger hair seemed slightly longer today than usual, maybe he was just letting it grow a little.<br />
<br />
Terry nodded, &quot;And I was wrong to. Lemme try that out.&quot; Terry started stretching for the exercise, figuring he could trust Brad from hereon to lift as he saw fit. Terry himself was feeling pretty oddly hyped up for a good workout. He&#39;d thought he was just about halfway done, feeling the lactic acid build up and he could feel his shoulders burning with the effort he put into working them out today. But somehow, his body was now proving more receptive to the idea of a further workout.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Brad looked over at him, &quot;I see my success is pretty inspiring.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see someone who&#39;s getting a little too excited.&quot; Terry chuckled, gesturing at Brad&#39;s manhood. It seemed to be poking up and out, obvious in his shorts. Terry did admit, Brad had a pretty decently sized lady pleaser on him. There was, privately, some truth to the rumor that Terry did some paid stuff, but he didn&#39;t really enjoy doing it very much. To the extent that it reflected on his sexuality, Terry by and large greatly preferred women, and only did what he did more or less out of desperation - having just enough attraction to register when a man looked good.<br />
<br />
And Brad was looking pretty damn good today for how stocky he was.<br />
<br />
As Terry took his seat and started getting ready, he turned his head to see Brad getting ready for the next compound movement he was doing - squats. Terry shook his head as he saw that it seemed Brad&#39;s ass and quads looked slightly oh so slightly larger, fitting his clothes a bit better and more tightly. He swore he needed to stop looking at a dude like that. Terry shook his head and figured he just needed some time to enjoy himself so to speak. His own manhood was starting to chub up a little despite himself.<br />
<br />
The ginger quarterback shrugged and started doing the same weight Brad had been doing. And he found himself struggling, but not nearly as much as he thought he&#39;d be struggling. Huh. Maybe they were both just putting in more effort and progress than what they thought they had recently. Terry didn&#39;t think twice of it, nor did he think much about the itch he started feeling on his stomach, or the way his face seemed to twitch and develop slightly older, slightly more mature contours - more angular and handsome still than before.<br />
<br />
As Terry pumped iron, he found the insurgent feeling of arousal did not go down. Even as he lifted he contemplated jerking off in the showers afterwards, knowing full well that Brad likely would go for such a &quot;cool down&quot; method as well. And Terry didn&#39;t really mind the idea of the two of them just...taking care of their issues like that even right next to each other. They just needed to keep their hands to themselves, and things&#39;d go fine.</p>
