<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Uh-oh, I thought.  This didn't appear to be such a good idea anymore.  Fortunately she stopped screaming and just stood there, trying her best to hide her nudity.  &quot;Why did you do this?&quot; she demanded as it appeared that tears welled in her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I'm dumb,&quot; I blurted out.  I wasn't really thinking about what I was saying, but I knew I was trying to say it quickly.  &quot;I know that it's been time for us to go past being friends for a long time, but I was too nervous to ask.  And besides,&quot; I added, &quot;you wouldn't agree with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Once again,&quot; she snapped slightly, &quot;you have jumped to the wrong conclusion.&quot;<br />
<br />
I was taken aback.  &quot;What do you mean?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
Her stance became less rigid.  She stood up straight, though she kept one hand over her pussy while her other arm covered her breasts.  &quot;Why don't you wish the clothes I was just wearing to reappear on the bed next to you?&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't see how that's--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just do it!&quot; she cut me off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine,&quot; I said, taking a heavy breath.  &quot;I wish that the clothes you were just wearing would appear next to me on the bed.&quot;  <br />
<br />
They appeared instantly.  I could see the exact same shirt and pants, both intact, and her shoes.  &quot;Look through them,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
I merely glanced at them.  &quot;They're the same,&quot; I said, not understanding what was her point.<br />
<br />
&quot;I said look through them,&quot; she clarified, &quot;not at them.  And take my shoes off the bed.&quot;  I chuckled.  That was typical for her, to make sure no shoes were on a bed, even if if wasn't hers.  I stood up in order to neatly place the shoes on the floor.  I picked up her clothes, looking through them and at them some more.  &quot;Notice anything?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; I started, still unsure of what she meant.  &quot;Well, I don't see a bra yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you won't,&quot; she said.  &quot;I wasn't wearing one.  I wasn't wearing any underwear at all.&quot;<br />
<br />
I turned around to look at her.  &quot;So what does that mean?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, come on, Joe,&quot; she said with a bit of impatience.  &quot;When have you ever known me to dress like a slut?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...never,&quot; I said sheepishly.  And that was true.  Becky never dressed in any way that could be considered slutty, or overly revealing, or any other word you could use to describe that kind of dress.  And it wasn't as if she was some kind of prude, either, because she certainly didn't dress overly conservative.<br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly,&quot; she said.  &quot;Joe, you might have thought I wasn't willing to sleep with you yet, but...&quot;  Her voice trailed off for a minute before she finished her sentence.  &quot;But I was.  And I was ready to tell you today.  In fact, I was on my way here for just that reason.&quot;<br />
<br />
My first thought was utter disbelief in that, but considering the damage I might have already done, I decided it better to keep that thought to myself.  &quot;Really?&quot; I asked, still sounding like a confused toddler.<br />
<br />
Becky slowly removed her arm and her hand from covering herself and said, &quot;Yes, Joe, really.  I love you, Joe.  I have no doubt about us anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
I felt relieved.  It appeared as if she was going to let me off the hook.  But much more importantly, it seemed that I was finally getting what I wanted with her:  everything.  I had known we were right for each other, or at least thought I had, but was still just so hesitant to push the issue.  It didn't look like I'd need to now.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you, too, Becky,&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
She smiled at me sweetly.  &quot;I know,&quot; she said, quoting a line from one of my favorite movies.<br />
<br />
We just stood there staring at each other for a moment.  If the scene that had just played out between us had been in a movie, I'm pretty sure most people would be horrified.  She was naked, which wasn't a bad thing, except for the fact that her clothes had simply vanished, and I had a set of DD breasts, but was otherwise male.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what now?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We do what we both want,&quot; she said, walking over to me.  &quot;But first, this has to be normal.&quot;  She walked right up to me and squeezed my breasts with her hands.  I moaned instantly since they were in such an aroused state.  &quot;As nice as these are, Joe, they have got to go.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; I moaned.  I moaned because she was still squeezing and caressing them, and because I had gotten to like having them.  I looked at her, but she had that stern look on her face that told me she wasn't going to waver.  &quot;Oh, well,&quot; I said and wished to have my normal chest again.  <br />
<br />
The feeling of the breasts deflating was just as weird as them growing, but there was no sense of pleasure this time.  &quot;Pity,&quot; I said, &quot;They were so nice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, they were,&quot; Becky agreed.<br />
<br />
&quot;A-ha!&quot; I exclaimed.  &quot;I knew you were a little jealous of them.&quot;<br />
<br />
She sighed.  &quot;Yea, just a little.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know,&quot; I said, &quot;we could ch--&quot;<br />
<br />
She cut me off again.  &quot;Absolutely not!&quot;  I looked at her slightly dismayed.  &quot;Joe, let me be serious for a minute.  I don't want you to change me with that ring again.&quot;  I could tell from her tone that she couldn't have been more serious.  She continued, &quot;You have to promise me that, Joe.  Do not change me.&quot;<br />
<br />
I decided she was right.  I never wanted to do anything to her with the ring in the first place.  &quot;I can do you one better,&quot; I said.  I wanted to show her I was serious, too, and that there could be absolute trust between us.  &quot;I can use the ring to prevent me from changing you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, wait,&quot; she interrupted.  &quot;I didn't mean it that way.  I meant I don't want you to change me without me knowing or consenting.&quot;<br />
<br />
I smiled at her.  &quot;So you're just as curious as I am after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I am,&quot; she smiled back.  &quot;When have you known me to not be adventurous.  It's just that I don't want you to pull the wool over my eyes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OK,&quot; I said.  &quot;I wish that I won't be able to change you in anyway unless I know you have agreed to it first.&quot;  <br />
<br />
It seemed like the lights in the room flickered for a minute.  &quot;Did you notice that too?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yea,&quot; I said.  &quot;I guess that was our way of knowing the wish was made.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Prove it,&quot; she dared.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, I wish your breasts were DD-sized,&quot; I said with a grin.<br />
<br />
She looked slightly shocked, but immediately stared at her breasts.  They didn't change at all.  &quot;I can't believe you said that,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; I shrugged.  &quot;I knew it wasn't going to work.  By the way, what size are they anyway?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They're just regular D-cups,&quot; she said.  &quot;So, yes, the ones you had were definitely bigger, as if you couldn't tell.&quot;  She used the past tense because by this time I was back to having my normal flat chest.  &quot;Turn around,&quot; she commanded.<br />
<br />
I did and immediately felt her press herself against me tightly.  It was an exhilarating feeling to have her breasts pressed against me.  She ran her hands up and down my chest, then slid her hands underneath my jeans and searched for my cock.  She found it and I heard her gasp.  &quot;What?&quot; I asked, thinking something was wrong.<br />
<br />
She giggled.  That didn't make me feel any better.  But her words did.  &quot;You are obviously very aroused, but I wouldn't have known that by looking at you,&quot; she laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; I said.  &quot;I did that when your clothes were disappearing so you wouldn't notice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean 'were disappearing?'&quot; she asked.  Rather than explain the whole story to her, I made a double wish in that she would know how her clothes disappeared and that my erect cock would be visible again.  I was taken aback myself by the sight of the bulge in my jeans.  &quot;I'm still waiting for an explanation,&quot; she said as she still ran her delicate fingers on my shaft.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, that wish really worked,&quot; I said.  &quot;I wished that you would know what I did, but I guess that was considered changing you.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Guess so,&quot; she said as she pressed herself into me tighter before releasing.  She bent down and started to untie my shoes.  While she did that, I explained to her the wish that I had made.  By the time she had my shoes and socks removed, I had finished the recounting of her clothes disappearing.  &quot;Ooh, that's kind of hot,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; I agreed.  &quot;That's why I did it that way.&quot;<br />
<br />
She stood back up and pressed herself close to me again.  &quot;I'm glad I turn you on so much,&quot; she said.  &quot;Otherwise this would be very boring.&quot;  With that she undid my belt buckle and unbuttoned my jeans.  She practically tore the jeans off me, ripping them down to my ankles rapidly.  I eagerly stepped out of them.<br />
<br />
Becky then ran her hands up the back of my legs until she got to my boxer-clad ass.  She felt up my ass, running her hands inside the boxers as well, and then slid them off me as well.  After I stepped out of them, I turned around so that she finally got a view of my naked, erect member.<br />
<br />
I wanted to say something, but before I could she shoved me back onto the bed.  &quot;Wow,&quot; I said.  &quot;I've never seen you like this before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course you haven't,&quot; she said as she ran her hands over her own incredibly sexy body.  &quot;We haven't done this before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Becky, you know that I have...you know,&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You think I haven't?&quot; she said.  &quot;And I don't mean high school, either,&quot; she said as her face turned serious again for a second.  There was that bad memory again.  How I wished I could remove it from her mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know I know that,&quot; I said, hoping to recreate the mood.<br />
<br />
She smiled at me again and continued to run her hands over her breasts.  &quot;And I know that you know that I know,&quot; she said, making both of us laugh.  &quot;Just testing you again.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that she climbed on the bed and started to crawl on top of me.  When she got to my face we shared a series of extremely passionate kisses.  We had both had sex before, but I think we had never felt passion like this.  I know that I certainly had not.  That was because I was never in love before now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, wait,&quot; I said, interrupting our embrace.  &quot;What about protection?&quot;<br />
<br />
She paused for a moment and then said, &quot;Well, can't you just wish that it won't be a problem?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably not!&quot; I said.  &quot;It might think it's a change to you if that were to happen,&quot; I said.  I didn't need to explain myself to her that I meant getting her pregnant.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're right,&quot; she said.  &quot;Oh, well,&quot; she sighed.  &quot;We'll deal with that as it comes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
She laughed again.  &quot;Joe, you have this ring.  I'm sure we could handle it in some way.  And it's hardly the worst thing that could happen,&quot; she added.  <br />
<br />
I smiled back at her.  I really couldn't believe that she would say that, but at the same time, she couldn't have said anything better.  With that statement she had pretty much said that she wanted to be with me for a very long time, and that she wanted to have children with me.  I couldn't think of being complimented any better than that.  &quot;If it's OK with you,&quot; I said, &quot;then it's OK with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
We resumed our passionate kissing.  It wasn't long before our kissing took a backseat to other forms of physical love, however.  I was squeezing and caressing her breasts, sucking at her nipples all the while.  She moaned in approval.  She teased my already erect cock more with her hands.  I quickly made a wish that I wouldn't climax until she was ready to as well.  She also sucked my cock eagerly.  This caused me to squirm around on the bed and moan in approval. <br />
<br />
After several minutes of bliss, she lifted her head up kissed her way up my chest back to my mouth.  It was a little weird to taste her kisses now, being what she had just been kissing, but I didn't care.  She then positioned herself on top of me, straddled me with her legs and guided my cock into her moist and awaiting slit.  We both moaned in loud ecstasy as she rode my cock for all it was worth.  I gathered myself enough to continue caressing her breasts.  She smiled as she screamed in sexual pleasure, and with her hands guided mine on her warm globes of flesh.  Within what was only a few minutes, but seemed like hours, we came simultaneously with loud screams of delight.<br />
<br />
We remained in those positions for a few minutes before she collapsed down on top of me.  I groaned a little as she temporarily knocked the wind out of me, but she just laughed at my brief discomfort.  She wrapped her hands around my shoulders and held me close to her.  I returned the feeling by embracing her waist with my arms.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Now what?&quot; I asked.</p>
