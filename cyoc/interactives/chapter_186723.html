<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Monica found a lot that she had never seen in her life, everything so old that if it weren&#39;t for the terrible state of conservation, they would be worth a lot of money. This was nothing strange to her as the house had belonged to the family for centuries and as far as she knew practically nothing that went into the attic of that house ever came out. There were things there that belonged to her grandparents and great-grandparents, maybe even her great-great-grandparents or her older ancestors. After so much searching she found a box that was so hidden in the bottom of the antiques that she wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it was one of the oldest things in the house and it was so decayed that it would fall apart as soon as she picked it up.<br />
<br />
With some effort Monica reached the box, which had a thick layer of dust on it, which had to be cleaned before it was moved. The box itself wasn&#39;t very big, it was just a little long, and when it was lifted, the floor underneath was very clean, which meant that the box was one of the first things to get there.<br />
<br />
Monica looked for a way to open the box, but it was locked with two padlocks, both very old models of which she sure as hell didn&#39;t have the keys. She thought the material would wear out and break easily, but it was still pretty tight, as was the wood the box was made of that had resisted the time pretty well and she couldn&#39;t break it. She went to the garage to get an ax, which she used to break open the box.<br />
<br />
She placed the box on a table and carefully aimed the ax trying to hit one of the locks, but she missed her hit and the ax stuck in the wood of the box, causing her to turn and the lid to break. It was all too fast and when Monica realized she had a sword coming out of the broken box, which fell on her foot, cutting off part of her left foot.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, that hurts too much.&quot; Monica said when the sword fell on her foot, but then she realized that even though part of her foot was cut off she didn&#39;t feel any pain. She then looked at the foot cut in the middle of her and was surprised there was no blood coming from the wound, which on closer inspection she saw did not exist.<br />
<br />
Monica saw that smooth skin closed the cut area not only on what was left of her left foot, but on the severed piece as well. She then picked up the severed piece of her foot from the ground, thus realizing that she could feel the touch on it, to which she soon confirmed that she could also move the toes of that foot. She was curious and put the parts of her foot together and in doing so the cut disappeared as if it had never been there, leaving her foot whole again.<br />
<br />
&quot;How strange, what&#39;s in this sword?&quot; Monica said and took the sword that had come out of the broken box.<br />
<br />
The sword was strange in that it appeared to be made almost entirely of silver, with gold accents and some precious stones on the hilt. There was some writing embedded in the blade, but it was in some language she couldn&#39;t understand.<br />
<br />
Monica then picked up the broken box to see if there was anything left inside it, finding a diary and a piece of paper with a short sentence written on it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Here is your new master.&quot; Monica read aloud not understanding why this paper was in the box, but soon afterward she felt the sword warming in her hand and the hilt change slightly so that it fit perfectly in her hand. <br />
<br />
Monica found all this strange, but from what had happened she began to understand that that sword had some kind of magical power, but she still wasn&#39;t ready to go all out, so she just pressed the blade to her thigh with a little pressure, which was enough to make the blade penetrate her. <br />
<br />
Just as when her foot was cut there was no pain and no blood, and so she cut off her leg like the ease with which you cut butter. Sitting up, she held her leg in her hand and moved it normally even without being physically connected to her body, before snapping back into place as if it had never been cut.<br />
<br />
&quot;How interesting this sword, I liked it. I even want to try something.&quot; Monica said and ran to her room, where she used the sword and cut her body at the waist, splitting her own body in half. She tried so hard to keep her top standing on the bed while her bottom stood facing her. She found it interesting to be able to see her lower parts from this angle.</p>
