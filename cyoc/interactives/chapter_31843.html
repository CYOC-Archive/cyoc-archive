<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dace stood under the gushing shower heads and let his fur get heavy with warm water, he ran his huge hands up and down his chest and over the lump that was his belly. He lifted his muzzle towards the ceiling and thanked the ego of executives everywhere for providing a washroom with such solid marbel floors and oversized showers....well over sized for a Human for a nine foot tall Kodiak Bearman like him it was ‘about right’ after some jury rigging by him and Hawkins to get the heads pointing right. Hawkins had gone back upstairs to send another bear down; as big as this shower was it was going to be one at a time given their size. Brown and Gora might have to wash kneeling. <br />
<br />
He sighed and tried to relax. Everything about this mission was going wrong, he knew he should never have trusted the Company when he got such a weak mission brief as ‘lock down the valley and stop anything leaving’ but the damage was done and here he was. Changed. Mutated. Inhuman. Not that he would have preferred another animal.....well maybe Wolf... if you had to be an animal-man then at least Bear came with far more advantages than say rabbit but....but.... he was now an outcast, unable to return home, cut off from Human society with only his brothers to rely on. <br />
<br />
Dace grinned a many fanged grin....his brothers. All of them where good men. He trusted two of them with his life, the others would prove themselves he knew it- the Company might employ traitorous types like Blocker but they did not employ idiots. Ah.... Blocker....Dace smiled... he was personally going to hunt and kill that bastard for robbing him of his Humanity; he was going to enjoy letting the badgerman see what he was like when he unleashed the beast he could feel in the back of his mind. It was not going to be pretty, it was not going to be nice, but it was all Blockers fault. <br />
<br />
Grabbing the soap dispensers Dace ripped off a top and poured the whole bottle into his thick chest fur and lathered himself up. The smell was heady on his enhanced senses – no wonder hunters could not catch animals if the prey could smell this sickly, chemical miasma coming for them! He pushed the later around himself, despite the smell he was not ready to give up Human comforts like being clean just because his nose twitched. He washed down his torso and onto his thick legs...each as round as his Human torso had been Dace figured. He lifted his left foot to rub water and soap between his clawed feet, getting rid of the last of the dried cum. He smiled as he thought of the orgy had had accompanied their change to Bearmen.... and he felt a twitch from his thick cock trapped between his belly and his thigh. Dace straightened and looked down at his organ but between his thick chest and belly he could not see his growing member, but he could feel it and he rubbed it, making the shaft pop from the partial sheath housing it. Did playing with himself like this somehow count as bestiality he wondered as he grew erect. <br />
<br />
Feeling a need Dace stretched throwing his long thick arms out and flexing every muscle feeling his seer power and strength. He knew he would easily lift a car now, but he wondered if he could throw it too? His erection throbbed and bounced as he leaned back and did some basic limbering exercises under the flowing water which was washing the soap away. He squatted down enjoying his thick cock slapping against his gut. Straightening he raised his left leg in a karate attack form moving through the motions slowly - Dace noted he could not reach as high as before, his muscle was simply too thick now. He did the same with his other leg and then sprang into squatting attack stance. Slower, he was defiantly slower and less limber. Though his new strength would compensate he would have work out some new attack forms to take into account his new size and weaponry. Dace also made a mental note to teach his Bear Clan how to fight in these bodies. If they where to be Bearmen they would be taking advantage of everything they had. <br />
<br />
Dace stepped back and rubbed his back against the pipe from one of the shower heads, careful to get his back rubbed but not crush the pipe. Damm it was not enough, he needed a tree. Still the water felt good on his cock. Dace inspected his member, now poking up from under his gut. No Human could have an organ like this it was too thick and too long for the Human heart to supply with blood. He wrapped a huge paw around the throbbing shaft – it felt odd, wrong somehow, but with his left hand caressing his heavy balls he began to get reacquainted with his tool. <br />
<br />
Dace shook himself out of his post orgasmic bliss and chortled at the white puddle on the opposite wall which was being washing away by the flowing water. He had enjoyed that, the raw primal feeling of orgasm was much more intense than as a Human, he could barely pull himself from the wall he was leaning on. Dace wounded if true Bears ever masturbated….how much Bear was he then? He greatly resembled one but was he an animal now?<br />
<br />
Dace shook his wet furry head, he had work to do, the bigger questions could wait until the position was secure. He reached out a long muscled arm and turned off the showers one by one, adding increased reach to the list of things he could need to add to his hand to hand techniques. He gave it thirty seconds before dropping to all fours; he was taken aback by how comfortable a position he found it. He knew this would be odd, feel wrong but Hawkins claimed he’d seen real Bears do it and it had worked for him so Dace shook. Arching his back the water flew from his fur surprising effectually. He grinned one up for Hawkins. He reared up and stepped back into the washroom surprisingly dry. They had mutilated the hand dryers and ‘Scottyied up’ a system for blowing hot air from all sides. It was crude but it worked. Dace set it off and stood in the middle as he was blasted dry. It felt wonderful like thousands of hands all over! Dace growled in appreciation....this was almost worth his Humanity.<br />
<br />
Suddenly he was aware of the door in the outer washroom had opened. He tried to smell who the incomer was over the blowers but it was not clear apart from it being a Bearman. Dace hit the off switch and stepped round the circle of blowers. He ran his claws through his fur as he did finding it amazing how dry he was and how soft his fur really felt. He could feel his erection returning but he banished the thought from his head- there was work to do he told himself as he stepped into the locker area. Brown was waiting for him. <br />
<br />
Henry Brown simply dominated the room. He was slightly over twelve foot tall and about five foot wide at the shoulders- simply immense. His fur was matted and tangled with dried cum and Dace could smell how bad it was so much better than any Human could. Still at the same time it was sexy as all hell and he felt his cock stir.<br />
“You look much cleaner” Brown rumbled in a deep voice Dace found very hot. <br />
“Thanks” Dace said his own deep voice. He was aware something was passing between them, he was sniffing the air without meaning too, and reading the scent his friend was giving off. He felt himself grow totally hard and resisted throwing himself towards the giant bearman.<br />
“See that’s why I said we should cover up” Brown said and playfully swiped Dace’s boner with a paw. Dace snorted in pleasure as his thick cock bounced up and down- bigger than any Human porn star with a slightly taper at the end he took a step towards Brown with his lust rising.<br />
“We made contact with Summers and got power back to him. Plus we got hold of Checkpoint Delta. Dr Harman has had an interesting time” Brown said. Dace blinked a few time and seemed to come out of his lust. He smiled up at Brown, the big man had always known how to make him focus.<br />
<br />
“That’s good. Did you find any food?” Brown noted that Dace was fondling himself still but was not likely to jump him now. <br />
“Yes sir. I got some supplies. The kitchen and stores are stocked for the entire base. I figure we have some months based on the frozen stuff alone. I took some meats and drinks to the men, but we’ll need to deal with cooking properly soon” <br />
“Yes. I’ll go and get them organized. I have been thinking it might be worth letting Rothman and Summers see us like this, we might be able to help them with the project” <br />
“Well Rothman has seen us, though is keeping his opinion to himself. Summers might be interested in us as specimens but little else. I would rather remain Bear than get poked about by him. You read the file you know what happened in Columbia”<br />
“True.” Dace said “true. <br />
“Plus the men are freaked out enough s it is. Hawkins is taking it well as is Blankan, but Talon is ready to slit his wrists or bolt for the forest- he keeps looking a the picture of him and his wife in his wallet. While Gora keeps going on about ceilings and open spaces……” Brown sighed “exposing them to Summers team, as competent as they are would be a bad move sir”<br />
“Ok” Dace said “bad idea” he paused as if he wanted to say something more and then said <br />
“Right- you get cleaned up old friend.” Brown nodded. <br />
“There is a loincloth on the bench for you. I managed to use our uniforms in such a way as to have some pockets too”. <br />
Dace snickered “That will be handy. I was wondering where to keep my ammo“. He grinned. Brown began to untie the ragged cloth he had covering his well packed groin but Dace made no move to leave so Brown coughed and nodded towards the door. Dace smiled and patted the giant on his chest.<br />
“Damm you give good pheromones” he said and as Brown dropped his loincloth and walked past him into the washroom.  <br />
“Go work boss” Brown said over his shoulder.</p>
