<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">What Phil didn’t know is that his wish was actually becoming a reality. The powers that be began to alter both Dawn and her baby to make the perimeters of the wish come true. As the couple swept, the changes took hold. Dawn turned over in her sleep as she subconsciously began to feel the changes of the wish. A tingling sensation swept her body—nothing strong enough to wake her up. It started with her nipples. The dark engorged nipples began to change hue, returning to their original pink that she had prior to the pregnancy. Their size shrank to her original as the ducts in her breast ceased the production of milk. They tightened up sealing off the potential of any more milk escaping. With that, the milk in her breast began to take a new form. It curdled and harder becoming squishy. Her ducts returned to pre-pregnancy size as the milk continued to harden a bit and conjoin with her breast tissue. Her breast remained the same size as when she was pregnant—a heft F-cup to prepare for the feeding of another being. Her breast began to sag but in a different way. The milk in her breast was becoming fat. After a few minutes the changes to her chest stopped and what was left were two breast filled with fat instead of milk. She rolled over again in her sleep, not noticing that her breast no longer sloshes with each movement or that their consistency was much less firm than in had been minutes ago. As she continued to dream, a similar process began to take place in her abdomen. Inside, the baby’s cells were beginning to morph. Her child and the reproductive organs that had grown during her pregnancy cycle began to take on a similar consistency as her breasts. First, the umbilical cord and placenta began to harden slightly and curdle as it yellowed inside of her. It pressed against the child who itself began to grow soft as its insides became more fat. The cord and placenta attached itself to the mother as it began to conjoin adding fat the her pregnant stomach. The fetus, or what was left of it, deformed into a ball of fat that also attached itself to the mother becoming more fat cells that her body recognized as her own. Her uterus shrunk to pre-pregnancy size as the rest of what was left of the pregnancy in her stomach turned to fat and became a part of her. The skin on her stomach began to feel less taught as it sagged and squished against the bed due to gravity. With an audible “pop” her belly button became an innie. It resembled her old belly button but this one was much deeper due to all the fat that enveloped the sides of it. To the naked eye, Dawn looked to still be pregnant, but a closer look and feel would say otherwise. She continued to sleep and woke around 7am to use the restroom. She opened her eyes, excited to feel the baby kick, but she felt nothing. Oddly enough, she felt a bit heavier than usual but chalked it up to some morning sickness. She rose and scratched her belly, it oddly felt squishy but she thought nothing big of it. Her breast didn’t feel sore like they usually do and felt oddly empty and less firm. She rose and began to walk to the bathroom. Her belly swayed back and forth and breast bounced with more tenacity than usual. She began to panic. Her stomach did not feel like to normally did, it moved to much. She ran to the bathroom as her stomach bounced like crazy. She looked in the mirror and for a moment thought nothing of it. She looked the same as she did yesterday. 9 months pregnant with her heavy breast but still something made her do a double take. She screamed when she saw that her belly button no longer pointed out like it did yesterday. She cupped her pregnant looking belly and nearly fainted as it felt more like jello than the dome it was yesterday. She took off her shirt to see that her breast looked the same size as yesterday but no milk came out. They looked like fatter forms of the breast she had before conception. She stared in the mirror as she terrifying looked at the version of herself that looked very much like it did yesterday but now realized that what was left of the pregnancy had become fat. She was left with big breast of fat and 9 months pregnant stomach of lard that would look no different to the naked eye if she wore her normal maternity clothes. Besides, of course, the fact that it dropped over her waist band much more than it had just hours before. She screamed for her husband as her eyes filled with tears. Her baby was reduced to nothing more than fat that was a part of her body now. No one would believe that she wasn’t pregnant looking at the body she still had but she knew that all she was was a fat woman who still appeared to be carrying her most special gift and no one would think otherwise based on the changes the wish made to her.</p>
