<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Solomon was sitting across from Kai, pretending to read, while at the same time checking him out.  He had been a bit of a loner since starting college.  He saw Kai when they were recruiting in the commons.  Kai had been very nice to him and shepherded him through the initiation at the frat.  He had since developed a crush on Kai but never did anything about it.  Even though he had a decent but wiry body, it was nothing compared to Kai.<br />
<br />
Solomon suddenly felt a burst of energy go through his body.  It was a weird feeling to be sure.  He felt like he needed to stretch and his shoes seemed too tight.  He then grew from 5&#39;10 to 6&#39;2.  While he hadn&#39;t realized it , the khakis he was wearing rose to mid-calf.  Then his feet burst through his shoes as they grew from a 9 to a 13.  He then felt like his body was cramping.  He watched in disbelief as his calves and thighs doubled in size, shredding his khakis up the side and ripping the front.  He felt turned on suddenly,as freaked out as all this was, it was also hot.  He started rubbing is cock through his pants.  As his cock hardened it lengthened to 10 inches and his balls grew.  His waist grew from a size 30 to a size 32.  Thanks to his growth spurt he now had a middrift and he saw his 4 pack grow to a well developed 6 pack.  As his pecs developed and became more muscular, his shirt became tighter and tighter, buttons slowly began to pop off.  At the same time, his glasses melted into a oily like substance and dripped down his over his now massive pecs, past his 6 pac and into his belly button which then absorbed it.  As this was happening his hands grew , followed by his forearms and biceps.  As each muscle grew they had muscle memory of a swimmer, diver, surfer and skater.  They grew until they shredded the shirt.  As his chest expanded he took a deep breath, rather than feeling the tightness from years of asthma, his lungs were now those of a champion swimmer.  Then he felt his face changing.  His cheekbones became more defined.  His face started to get tan, not like someone who tanned at the beach, but like a skin tone.  Solomon felt warmth spread through his body.  Kai noticed Solomon&#39;s eyes become more round and glowed with an emerald green color.  His hair became chestnut brown and grew to his shoulders.  Solomon couldn&#39;t believe his eyes.  Then an intense pain wracked his brain, torso and arms.  As his memories overwrote memories, more changes were taking place on his body.  Starting at his belly button, a tattoo of a dragon snaked its way around his abs up to his right pec with the mouth opening  on his right nipple.  At the same time a number of tribal designs and japanese designs completed a sleeve up his right arm.  On his left shoulder blade, a gothic cross appeared.<br />
<br />
Solomn couldn&#39;t believe what was happening to his body.  As his mind rewrote itself, he corrected himself -  What&#39;s not to believe?  He had worked his ass off to get where he was.  He was the son of immigrants from Panema.  His parents sacrificed so much for him and his sibling.  No he was Solomon Chang, the son of 3rd generation Chinese.  No his name was Solomon Guitierrez.  He was a star swimmer.  He began swimming at a young age when papa taught him.  He was accepted to the university on a sports scholarship.  He didnt want the athletics to define him so he enrolled in their aerospace engineering program.  No he was Solomon Chang...he didn&#39;t have tattoos, his parents would kill him.  Solomon Guitierrez didnt care what people thought, people called him a rebel because of all his tattoos and his refusal to cut his hair.  It was one of the things Kai loved about him,  They met the first week of Freshmen year.  During the first swim practice he had thought he was amazing.  He had thought his tattos , which were fewer in number, were amazing.  They started dating almost right away.  The last remnant of Solomon Chang disappeared when his jade necklace changed from a Buddha to a jade cross that he remembered Kai giving him on their anniversary.<br />
<br />
His clothes began to reshape, his shredded button down became a indigo lycra under armor.  The khakis became a pair of sweatpants and the shoes became a pair of leather and suede flipflop because he hated wearing any kind of shoe.  He also wasnt wearing underwear.  Kai&#39;s memories shifted, only slightly adjusting.  He remembered changing Solomon but that memory would fade with time.  The fact that it made Solomon his bf was just a perk.  <br />
&quot;<br />
Solomon looked up as though he was seeing the world for the first time.  He looked over and saw Kai sitting across from him.  &quot;Hey sexy, you look like you are hard at work&quot; he said with only the slightest hint of an accent.  He then inched toward Kai, &quot;You know I missed you today while you were home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know...I missed you too.  Maybe next time I&#39;ll take you with me.  I think you and my little brother would really get along.  He is an amazing soccer player, excellent swimmer and surfer...oh and I found out he&#39;s gay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?  So it runs in the family...that&#39;s cool...but right now the only person I&#39;m interested in is you, mi amor.&quot;  Solomon reached over and gently closed the laptp.  He then got up and slowly lowered himself , straddling Kai.  As he kissed Kai, lightly biting his lower lip, he said &quot;Why don&#39;t I show you how much I missed you&quot;<br />
<br />
There was something about those eyes, that voice and that charm that Kai couldn&#39;t resist.  Solomon stood up and grabbed Kai&#39;s hand, pulling him up and into his arms.  He kissed Kai again.  Kai grabbed his laptop and led Solomon into the house, up the stairs and into his room...closing the door behind him.</p>
