<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><Br>"You are going to turn me into a werewolf?!" Brian asked after taking his first sip of the water in that glass.</Br>
<Br>"Yeah... Brian... I am. Do you have a problem with it?" I asked with a semi stern voice, wondering if he really did or if he was going to say 
anything at all.</Br>
<Br>"You know... I was, but now that I have had a few moments to think about it, I kind of like the idea of being a werewolf!" Brian said with an 
evil smile.</Br>
<Br>"Oh... so you like the idea?" I asked with a raised right eyebrow and my head cocked slightly to the right.</Br>
<Br>Brian nodded and grinned, his face looking slightly darker with stubble, his top and bottom bicuspids looking slightly longer and sharper. "I 
really do love the idea. The sound of changing from a man into the animal that lives within all humanity, being able to become free of the bonds 
humanity inherently has upon it and so much more is so very appealing!"</Br>
<Br>Hearing the words that Brian spoke with such certainty and vigor made me grin from ear to ear, grateful that the choice I made for him was a 
good one. However, what I hadn't counted on was how well he liked the idea, as if his alignment was toward a chaotic evil and the wolf that was 
now unleashed in him was feeding off of it. Wondering if there was anything else he would like changed about himself, I smiled deviously and 
threw out a question to him. "Hey Brian... is there anything you would like to specify about the new you?"</Br>
<Br>Immediately as the words entered his ears, I could see him begin to ponder as the gears and cogs in his mind were beginning to turn. "You 
know... my good friend... there are a few minor tweaks that I would love for you to implement!" Brian said as that same look formed on his face.
</Br>
<Br>"Really... and what would they be?" I asked Brian coyly.</Br>
<Br>"There are a couple of things. First, I would like the transformation to be somewhat slow. I would love it if you could make it so that I would 
change throughout the duration of drinking this glass of water. The second is that I would love it if I could control my changes between my human 
and werewolf forms. The third is I would love all of my human features to be permanently enhanced. Do you think you could do those things for 
me?" He finally asked with a playfully devious tone.</Br>
<Br>I looked at him and nodded my head slowly, but then asked, “Do you want any thing else specific?”</Br>
<Br>Brian looked at me for a second, nodded and said “Yeah… if you could make me immortal so that I can never ever be killed no matter by 
what or how.”</Br>
<Br>I stood there for a moment, thinking about his request, wondering why he would want to be completely immortal. I knew that things could 
get really complicated, but the thought of having werewolves become the master race above humanity was invigorating.  I didn’t know what Brian 
was up to all of a sudden, but I decided that I would let him run with it, but there was one condition on his immortality. “Yeah, I can do that on one 
condition Brian.”</Br>
<Br>“… And what would that be?” Brian asked me with a coy look on his face, intrigued by my condition.</Br>
<Br>I could tell he was thinking that it was something along the lines of him turning me into one in return, but that wasn’t what I had in mind. 
“Well… it is on the condition that if things get out of hand with you, I could put a stop to it.” I said with a smile.</Br>
<Br>Brian looked at me and I could see that he was mulling over the idea, then smiled deviously and nodded in silent agreement. Then Brian 
spoke up and said, “Yeah… I think I can handle that!” with the same wolfish smile, showing his sharper teeth and running his plump red tongue 
over the tips of his teeth and his lips.</Br>
<Br>Glad that Brian was ok with my request, knowing that he didn’t have all that much choice, I smiled and made the appropriate wishes. “Alright 
my friend, you have everything that you specified… now drink up and enjoy!”</Br>
<Br>Brian grinned and nodded, then took a second sip of the water and I watched as his body immediately started changing right before my eyes. 
It was interesting and extremely fascinating to watch Brian’s ears elongate slightly as pointed tips formed on the top of his ears while a dark five 
o’clock shadow sprouted on his face. As I watched on with rapt fascination, Brian grinned and I could tell that he wanted to ask me something.
</Br>
<Br>“So… what do you think of the newer me? I know it isn’t much, but it sure is cool… don’t you think?” Brian asked with a sly tone in his voice.
</Br>
<Br>I did have to admit that it was cool to watch, but I wasn’t sure what he was getting at. “Yeah… it is pretty cool, but why do you ask?”</Br>
<Br>Brian smiled showing off his teeth, which were more fang-like. “Well… you know since you made me a full blooded, tried and true werewolf… 
I could make you one as well.”</Br>
<Br>Hearing those words, I knew that was his goal and while it was an intriguing offer, I knew I had to decline. I knew that I had to resist simply 
for the fact that if I became a werewolf like him, there wouldn’t be anyone to keep Brian in check. “Honestly, that sounds awesome, but I have to 
decline. I just don’t think being a werewolf is for me.” I said, fearful of telling him the truth and not knowing what he would end up doing. 
Something told me that this was not the last time I would be asked this question.</Br>
<Br>Brian just nodded his head and grinned, as if he knew something that I didn’t. Of course, I couldn’t be sure what was in his head at the 
moment, but I was sure it had something to do with what he was becoming and what I made him. “Alright buddy, but I have to tell you that you 
are missing out. This feels amazing! Right now my whole body feels tingly and euphoric. Even though this was only the second time I took a sip, 
the tingly sensation has only increased… hell it has doubled and I can’t wait for the next sip just to see how I would feel!” Brian said with quite a 
bit of enthusiasm.</Br>
<Br>Hearing him, I just chuckled. “I am sure it is quite amazing, but I still have to decline.” I said.</Br>
<Br>Brian again smiled as he nodded indiscriminately and then took another, but longer sip, taking in about a quarter of the now transformative 
water. Slowly I could see his body inflate underneath the clothing as his muscles grew in size. His chest barreling out while his stomach followed 
suit while he kept his belly making it a muscle gut. Simultaneously Brian’s arms bulked out from a once meager seventeen inches in diameter to 
twenty-six inches as his forearms bulked and tapered. Slowly, I even watched, as his shoulders grew rounded, bulkier and capped in muscle while 
his neck muscles thickened. I couldn’t really believe what I was seeing, even though I made it happen. Then suddenly his legs and rump started to 
thicken, pressing the fabric of his jean shorts to the limit as I heard the ends rip and tear slightly while his calves bulked up and became far more 
defined than I had ever seen on him. As I looked at his face, I could see that his teeth were even longer than before, but not by much while his 
ears had become more of a hybrid state of human and wolf ears. Impressed by what has happened thus far, I couldn’t help but wonder how he felt 
now that he was further along than before.</Br>
<Br>“So… how are you feeling now Brian?” I asked plainly even though he could tell that there was more emotion behind my words than I let on. I 
was curious to know how all of that strength and power felt, but that was where it all ended for me.</Br>
<Br>Brian looked at me and grinned, showing off his longer fangs. “You know dude… it is the craziest feeling in the whole world to be completely 
honest! It is like all my senses have all lit up at once! I can hear, see and smell things that you wouldn’t believe. I can even smell the scents you are 
giving off!” He finished saying with a sly smile.</Br>
<Br>Wondering what he meant and what he smelled, I had to ask him. “Oh really?! What do you smell coming off of me?”</Br>
<Br> “Well… what I mainly smell is not only intrigue, but excitement. I know you have always had a fascination with what I am becoming and I 
know how exhilarating it is for you to see it happen before your very eyes. I can even smell a bit of fear coming from you since you are unaware of 
what I might do once I have taken my full bi-pedal werewolf form.” Brian said as he adjusted himself on the sofa, trying to get in a more 
comfortable position.</Br>
<Br>I grinned knowing that he was right and everything that he said was true. “Yeah… what is happening to you is pretty cool and I have always 
wondered what it would be like, which is why I decided to make you one to see a transformation truly happen. Honestly, I am a bit jealous that you 
are going through it and not me.”</Br>
<Br>Brian just kept grinning, “Yeah… I could smell the jealousy on you as well, but I didn’t want to say anything.” He said as he took another 
large sip, having consumed half of the glass now.</Br>
<Br>Slowly, Brian’s body started changing again as the hair on his exposed arms and legs grew thicker, darker and denser while not being quite 
like fur. Just like on his arms and legs, his facial hair grew longer and thicker, becoming quite the beard. Simultaneously, Brian’s hands thickened 
while his fingernails grew longer, darker and curled like sharp and deadly talons.</Br>
<Br>Feeling the wolf coming out of him more, Brian growled as his eyes shifted from his beautiful blue to his new amber colored eyes. “Fuck 
man… this is seriously intense! Are… are you sure you wouldn’t want to try it for yourself?”</Br>
<Br>“Yeah… I am pretty sure Brian…” I said with a disparaging tone, really wanting to experience it first hand, but knowing that I couldn’t.</Br>
<Br>Brian groaned and shook his head in dismay as his feet thickened and lengthened while claws grew from the tips of his toes. Wanting more, 
Brian took another drink, leaving only a quarter of the glass and groaned immediately. Quickly as if water was cascading over his body, his hair 
grew thicker into fur, pushing his shirt to the limit and splitting apart while it fell to the ground in tatters. Brian groaned even more as his ears 
lengthened while his brow slipped forward as his face pushed outward. Slowly his entire skull reconfigured to a more lupine snout as his face 
continued to push outward, forcing his nose to flatten while it darkened and became moist. All while his face pushed outward, his ears became 
more triangular and full wolf as they migrated to the top of his skull while his fangs grew longer and were still visible beyond his blackened lips. 
Snapping and popping was heard next as his legs broke, reforming into three joints for a digitigrade stance. As I looked upon him more, 
engrossed in what I saw, Brian grasped the glass and threw back the rest of the water. Immediately Brian began groaning as his body bulked out 
in more muscle tearing the already straining jean shorts, dark brown and feral looking fur replaced the smooth and regal fur he previously had, 
while a long and fluffy wolven tail burst free from his pants and wagged in contentment with what he had become. </Br>
<Br>Now that the transformation ended and Brian had a moment, he looked his body over and smiled, curling his lips over his fangs, exposing 
them for me to see. I knew he was strong, powerful and could easily overtake me, but he also knew I could make a wish so quick that I could 
easily undo what I made him. Slowly, Brian turned his paws over, closely examining his claws that were as dark as obsidian and as sharp as a 
scalpel, noticing and experimenting with the dark black pads of flesh on the palms of his paws, which he knew was there for added comfort if he 
decided to take a more feral approach to his movements. Grinning from ear to ear, Brian knew that this was his chance since he sniffed the air 
while his eyes went wide.</Br>
<Br>“So… are you sure you don’t want to become like me?” Brian asked slyly, and then continued, “I can smell the jealousy and the desire coming 
off of you like a sweet smelling cologne. I know you want to be like me… I just don’t know why you don’t admit it!” He said as he padded over to 
me in a non-threatening way.</Br>
<Br>I looked at him sternly, letting him know that I was not to be toyed with, and that if he tried anything funny he would regret it. Immediately 
Brian nodded his head, but still moved closer to me. Since he and I were on clear terms, I stood my ground and let him come closer.</Br>
<Br>“Yeah… I am sure Brian. I really am jealous and I really would love to become what you are, but I just can’t.” I said with a little bit of dismay.
</Br>
<Br>Brian looked at me while he cocked his head to the right a bit. “You don’t sound so sure of yourself! I know you want to be like me… you 
have said it yourself, but I don’t get what could be holding you back…”</Br>
<Br>I lowered my head in sadness, desperately wanting to give in, but I couldn’t. I couldn’t unleash an immortal beast like Brian into the world 
without some sort of reassurance that things wouldn’t go horribly wrong. “I… I just can’t Brian.”</Br>
<Br>Brian padded closer, now he was standing close enough to touch me and yet I still didn’t move. “What if I made it worth your while? What if 
you were Alpha and I was your Beta… your second in command? You would still have power and control over me. I know that is why you don’t 
want to give in and become what you have always desired. You are fearful that if you become what I am, there would be nothing stopping me from 
having my way. You cannot tell me otherwise because I can smell it on you.”</Br>
<Br>Hearing Brian’s words, I lowered my head in a bit of shame, unhappy that my true feelings were that easy to be read. I knew he was now a 
different kind of creature, unlike any before him and I knew that he desired above all else to form a pack, a close-knit family of those like himself. 
The idea of being Alpha, still having control, was very tempting and I couldn’t help but consider the idea.</Br>
<Br>Looking back up at his radiant amber eyes, I felt myself melt and I was ready to give in. “You would make me Alpha?”</Br>
<Br>Brian smiled deviously, “Of course I would. You did make me after all! You are my creator, you are the one who made this all possible… so of 
course the honor of being Alpha would be yours if you took it!”</Br>
<Br>Seriously considering it, for only a moment since it was what I truly desired… I nodded my head apprehensively. “I would love that 
Brian!”</Br>
<Br>Immediately a look of excitement came over his lupine muzzle. “Excellent! You will make a fine Alpha. There is only one condition that I have 
though.”</Br>
<Br>Not knowing what he had in mind, I looked at Brian apprehensively. “… And what would that be?” I asked.</Br>
<Br>“I would like to be the one to turn you and make you even more perfect than I am. I want to be the one to unleash your full potential as a 
werewolf!” Brian said in his guttural voice that had a slight evil undertone to it.</Br>
<Br>I continued to look at him the same way, curious to hear what he was up to. “How would you go about that?”</Br>
<Br>Brian chuckled hearing my apprehension return. “Well… I would bite you and let my infectious saliva fill your blood stream while making a 
few personal tweaks for my liking.” He finished saying with an evil grin.</Br>
<Br>I nodded, but quickly reminded him just who was boss. “I swear to you that if you try anything funny, I will undo what I have made you and 
turn you into something you would regret.”</Br>
<Br>Brian again chuckled heartily. “Not a problem Alpha. I know who is boss and I wouldn’t dare do anything to lose such a gift that you have 
bestowed upon me.”</Br>
<Br>“Alright then, sink your teeth into me and make your tweaks. Make me like you Brian!” I said, slightly fearful of what he had in store, knowing 
he could cross me and make this all go wrong.</Br>
<Br>Hearing the go ahead, Brian quickly grasped my shoulders, baring his teeth and sinking them deep into the somewhat muscular flesh of my 
neck. Immediately I winced in pain, which quickly subsided as he held his fangs deep in me, making his personal alterations to me which I agreed 
to give him the power to do… the only thing that I feared was him double-crossing me.</Br></p>
