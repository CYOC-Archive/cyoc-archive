<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Matheo could not wait to show his new living dolls to some of his friends. Sure he preferred Steve because he has a more muscular body. Sure, David was disappointed not to be the favourite, but he has lots of difficulty not being aroused by all the touching, even more seeing Steve being played with a lot.<br />
<br />
Matheo invited Alexander, 9 years old, Stephen, 10 years old, and Martin, 11 years old. They all arrived at the same time. David and Steve were very anxious to know what kind of game they’d do with them. <br />
<br />
Alexander, the 9 years old boy, brought his own dolly which was his own dad. The kid was kind of cute wearing a red dungaree, his dad inside the front pocket. <br />
<br />
Stephen, the 10 years old one, was carrying a black briefcase that contained accessories intended for kids with living dolls.<br />
<br />
Finally,  Martin, the 11 years old kid, was holding a teen boy around 16-17 years old boy, wearing a blue singlet, in his fist.<br />
<br />
Steve asked: “Oh what do I see there, there are more guys our size? Gee, I thought only your family has a house that shrinks people!”<br />
<br />
Thomas replied (I correct his odd way of speaking): “Well not many have those and the way they use it can be a little different from one family to another. <br />
<br />
Dennis added: “Don’t worry, it’s okay, those are Matheo’s best friends and their families play with tiny guys since many generations ago too. <br />
<br />
Then Alexander took his dad out of his front pocket. Unlike David and Steve who were 11 inches tall, the tiny dad was nearly 12-1/2 inches tall. His body was pretty smooth, with very shortcut hair and 3 days beard. His muscles were impressive, he was a colossus compared to them. Steve was in awe seeing such a virile man who only wore compression white jogging shorts.<br />
<br />
Matheo said: “Oh cool so your dad finally accepted to be a doll size man”<br />
<br />
Alexander replied: “Yes he did it for the first time yesterday because it was my birthday.”<br />
<br />
Matheo said: “Oh yeah, it was your birthday, so I wish you a delayed happy birthday!<br />
<br />
Alexander laid his shrunken dad near the tiny house, right between David and Steve who looked like a midget compared to him. Then,  Martin put the tiny teen at the left. In his case, he was only 10 inches tall but quite athletic. Steve, as he was right beside him, was not able to resist having a quick look at the teen’s singlet bulge which was quite huge.  Dennis Joined them and stood beside Steve.<br />
<br />
Dennis said: “Oh guys, looks like they want to compare us closer, so let&#39;s spread our legs large”<br />
<br />
Steve was a little nervous, suspecting some more invasive touches and probings. He saw Stephen’s finger closing toward him. He was right about his apprehension when he felt that 10 years old curious fingertip stroking his pectorals, then his abs. Then he caressed his quadriceps saying: You sure have a good body, you are a very interesting dolly to play with. Steve shuddered when, without any warning, he felt his penis held between the boy’s thumb and index finger. He rolled it, squeezed it, and moved his shaft’s skin back and forward several times.  Suddenly he got a boner and blushed.<br />
<br />
Stephen said: “You are very fun to play with!”<br />
<br />
David was extremely aroused to see his friend’s penis being played with, so his erection was so hard, it was painful. Suddenly, Martin grabbed him in his left fist, held him close to his face, and made his tiny dick bounce with his fingertip while giggling. The boy said: “Oh your penis still has its foreskin just like Dad’s one. <br />
<br />
David said with a very concerned tone: “What, is your dad letting you play with his genitals?”<br />
<br />
Alexander’s dad said with a very upset tone: “Hey, you American, the boy only wants to learn anatomy!  It’s our tradition to let our sons make their discovers.”<br />
<br />
Matheo said: “Alexander, would you mind if I’d play with your dad for a while?” Alexander simply nodded.<br />
<br />
The muscled tiny dad smiled up at the boy and rose his arms up right away. David, as he was held in a way he was able to observe the scene, envied Matheo who has such a totally manly specimen to play with. Matheo found him even more interesting than Steve. He was staring at the tiny dad’s compression white jogging shorts growing tent. The muscled tiny dad, noticing the boy was curious, simply said: “It’s OK, boy, I’m a doll, you can play any way you want.<br />
<br />
David and Steve were shocked about what the man has just said. Those people pretended it was not a sexualized thing, but things appeared to be all the opposite. They noticed how the tiny dad seem to enjoy being held in a giant boy’s hand, his bulge touched and played. At a moment, Matheo pulled down the man’s underwear and exclaimed: “Oh that is the bigger tiny penis I saw before, sorry Dad, Uncle Dennis, David, and Steve.”<br />
<br />
The tiny teen boy grabbed his bulge to reposition his dick underneath his singlet. Alexander picked him up in his left fist to then gently rub the tiny bulge with his free fingertip. The teen was saying something like: “Yeah you do that for as long you want, Alexander.” So he did a lot, making the tiny teen moan, but felt quite relaxed. Then the teen was breathing very fast and louder, arched and there was a wet goo spot... Oh, he has ejaculated. <br />
<br />
The boys were randomly playing with all the tiny guys who all ended up naked. David and Steve were disgusted about all of it, and wished something may happen to save them both from that pervert nightmare. It went way too far!<br />
<br />
So...</p>
