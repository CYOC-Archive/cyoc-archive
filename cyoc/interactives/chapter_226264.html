<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“It was close, Charlotte but you managed to make it before the clock struck midnight,” Nancy said as she wiped the cum off of her computer. “Hoo-ray,” Charlotte gasped as her penis died down from all the cumming that she did. Charlotte could’ve sworn that she did came before midnight but was glad that she didn’t.<br />
“Now, to honor our agreement a month ago, I will give you the ability to control the nanomachines and maybe make them permanent. Do you have something in mind or do you want to wait till morning?” Charlotte snored as her answer. After releasing gallons of spunk for nearly an hour, Charlotte was dead to the world.<br />
<br />
12 hours later<br />
<br />
“Honestly, it’s a good look on you.” “You think?” “Swear on my mother’s potential grave.” That resulted in a couple of laughs between the two ladies. After successfully making it through Naughty Nano November, Charlotte had the opportunity to do anything she wanted with the nanomachines. <br />
While she could’ve deactivated them since they had caused problems and suffering, she instead decided to utilize them for her benefit. So with the help of Nancy, she had picked out half of the best transformation she had gone through and kept the good part.<br />
<br />
There were some transformations that Charlotte had to reduce down to a feature and others that were kept in check so that she wouldn’t be overwhelmed. Like when she was covered with hair or turned into a doll. Instead of being a posable hairball, Charlotte made it so that she naturally had long, thick hair and porcelain-like smooth skin with no body hair below the neck. To further emphasize the fact that she has improved herself, Charlotte got her Calico-cat ears and tail that she got from the very beginning. Throw in a couple of muscles from when she was an Amazonian woman and the ability to breathe fire from her time as an anthro Flareon, she could easily fight back on her own terms.<br />
<br />
But Charlotte didn’t limit it to just a few cosmetics and superpowers, she went to town on her body to look good too. While she did pick the age regression and the height lost from the short stack to make her look younger than she is, Charlotte had also picked out a lot of other changes to make her anything but a little kid. <br />
By selecting the overtly sexual option, that being the breasts, the butt, both of the lips (mouth and pussy), and a bit of the hourglass, she can have anyone she wants. Granted, Charlotte limited the emphasis of her womanly curves by going so far as she could reach and take care of them. With her breasts grown bigger than her head and a butt to match, Charlotte looks like a stacked collage girl with a thin waist and plump lips at both ends.<br />
<br />
To counter all of the added weight that she had put on herself, Charlotte also picked out the body inflation that had once stuck her to the ceiling. So while she may look like she may weigh over 300 pounds, she only weighs a third of that amount. With all of the physical changes that Charlotte had picked out, there were a few mental changes that she wanted to include. By having the “devil-may-care” attitude from being a big tiddy goth girl and the gentry-ness that came from being a MILF, Charlotte feels like she can do anything.<br />
<br />
It was initially awkward for Nancy to see Charlotte like this. Seeing her friend turned from being a simple woman whom she had known for almost her whole life to someone who looked like they were from an anime. An anime where an overtly stacked Neko girl, who is currently studying in college, goes off to fight crimes with her great strength and fire powers. But, if this is what Charlotte wants to do with the ability that the nanomachines can do, Nancy isn’t going to argue with her.<br />
There is one thing that Nancy had a say to her more youthful-looking friend, how is she going to explain her transformations to her workplace and family? “Charlotte. As of right now, your workplace still thinks that you are coming back.” Nancy is finalizing the final change to Charlotte as she is going through her wardrobe to see if any of the clothes that they got would still fit. “And don’t forget your family. While your mother knew about this, how about the other members of your family? How are you going to explain to everyone that you’re still you?<br />
<br />
Charlotte swayed out to where Nancy was with her door-busting hips, dressed in a dress that covered the goods but still left enough skin to leave a little to the imagination. “Simple, Nancy. I just quit my old job.” The added bonus of having a little bit of the MILF transformation is that Charlotte’s voice sound experienced instead of sounding too young. “With my looks and personality, I can be a streamer and make content online. People will pay top dollars to see me. Maybe more if they want to see me in person.”<br />
Nancy shook her head at the thought of her friend streaming, including after-hours sessions with adult viewers. “And your family?” “I will break it to them when the time is right. Until then, radio silence to all family members. And that includes my mother as well.” Charlotte made her way to sit next to Nancy, to which she had almost sat on her due to how wide she got. “You know what, Nancy?” “Yes, Charlotte?” Nancy responds while she is still typing away. “How do you feel about another wager with your nanobots?”<br />
<br />
Nancy stopped typing when she heard what the short stack told her. She turned to see if Charlotte was pulling her leg on making another bet. “But you won, Charlotte. Why do we need to do this again?” The bountiful beauty shook her head as her vibrant hair danced around them. “This challenge isn’t for me silly. It’s for you.” Now that she knows that she is going through the wringer and not Charlotte, Nancy likes the idea. “Go on.”<br />
Hearing the go-ahead, Charlotte laid out the rules for this new wager. “There are 24 days till Christmas. So there are 24 transformations that you have to go through. But unlike my challenge, where I can’t get any release for the whole month, you will be in a constant state of arousal until the final day. Without the ability to release it, I might add. If you manage to keep your sanity throughout the whole endeavor, you will have your full control back over your nanomachines. If not, then I will have fun with your machines to control you however I want. What do you say to that?”<br />
<br />
Nancy pondered on the question that Charlotte proposed. While she doesn’t have to do the challenge of getting injected with the nanomachines, the idea of doing it under the pretense that she is doing the challenge just for the nanomachines is amusing to her. And why not, she can write it off as more testing with the nanomachines before it hits the market.<br />
“Sure, I’m willing to take up this bet. Just give me a moment to calibrate it for me instead of you and we will get underway.” Hearing the consent given by her friend, Charlotte was overjoyed to have Nancy be with her and to undergo various transformations like what she did. A couple of hours later, Nancy got another batch of nanomachines injected into her system. Complete with their own unique coding than what Charlotte received a month ago. And before the two women knew it, Nancy was changing right before their eyes. “Here’s to the first day of December, Nancy,” Charlotte said as she watched her friend morph in front of her. “One down, twenty-four to go.”</p>
