<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I-I just...”<br />
“You just...” you say, “seriously, I promise you, from this moment until... well forever, I will not judge you at all. Your secret is safe with me, I promise you on my life. Do whatever you want, whatever you desire, anything <br />
Skylar looks at you, as if a weight has been lifted off her shoulder. She gives you a look of relief, excitement, and also a devilish grin.<br />
<br />
“Okay...” she starts, “okay!” She says again, this time louder and confident, “I wish... hmm... I wish that everyone, except me and you will start to bloat around their whole body until they become like balloons. Their hands and feet ont be able to touch the ground and they won’t be able to move them and they’ll only be able to roll around or bounce,”<br />
<br />
You hear her finish, you can tell just by the way she’s speaking that she’s been holding this in for a long time.<br />
<br />
Before you can think any further, behind Skylar you see your friends, Emily and Niko, begin to bloat. Their frozen bellies begin to push against their shirts, their jeans begin to get a little tighter too. You also notice their cheeks slowly but surely begin to fill with air.<br />
<br />
“Oh yeah, I wish they’re all unfrozen,” Skylar says, “oh and I wish they all have no memory of who they are or where they are, only that we are their masters,” she adds. You’re a little surprised, but honestly it could make it more fun.<br />
<br />
Everyone around you begins to move again, they all look confused and a little disoriented. Skylar smiles ear to ear.<br />
You look at Skylar’s mother and father, their bellies had stretched far and wide in both directions, their thighs were beginning to tear the fabric of their leg-wear. Skylar’s mother’s breasts were also increasing in size, not by a lot, but as someone who had observed them quite a lot over last few hours, you could definitely tell a difference in size. And just like Emily and Niko, their mouths were filled with air.<br />
<br />
You look back at Skylar, she’s getting really excited watching this all unfold, you can also see hints of arousal in her stare as she watches them grow,<br />
“You’re definitely enjoying this, aren’t you,” you say,<br />
“Oh absolutely!” She says with joy, “you have no idea. This is my dream, this was the first thing I thought when I figured out this ring thing,”<br />
“Yeah I guessed, I mean you kinda proved that,”<br />
“Yeah I guess I did. But I was holding back, that was really arousing... but this... and so many other things which I’m gonna try out.”<br />
“Heh... I was just thinking,” you start, you also notice she hasn’t taken her eyes off the growing individuals, “is this the limit to the fetish... just the inflating part?”<br />
“Huh?” She takes her eyes off them for a moment to look at you, getting a little lost in your eyes, “Uhh... oh, no it is not. It’s not just this kind of growing, I guess I’m into change of all types, I mean I’m into... well... I guess I don’t wanna spoil it for it,” she winks at you. You get a little nervous, but also a little turned on by it.<br />
<br />
You look back, immediately you see Mia, Skylar’s sister. She’s her belly has morphed with the other parts of her body, like her thighs, she was slowly becoming more ball-like. You look around, this is apparent for pretty much everyone. Everyone’s shirt or anything has lifted completely, revealing their belly buttons. And to prove your not the only one who noticed this, Skylar says,<br />
<br />
“I wish everyone’s belly buttons would pop like they were pregnant,”<br />
<br />
You watch as simultaneously, each and every person’s belly buttons pop outward. You also feel your belly go weird too, you lift up your shirt and see your own belly button has popped in the same fashion. You look at Skylar, she’s clearly too distracted to notice it herself, but you can see her belly button has tented her tank top lightly. You poke your own, it feels weird.<br />
<br />
Emily, Niko, Skylar’s mother, father, and sister Mia, have inflated to the point where their whole bodies were almost perfect spheres, excluding the little bumps where their hands and feet connect. Their clothing has pretty much all ripped, excluding any underwear, you can see Skylar’s fathers’ boxers holding in very tightly. Her mother’s panties are spread over the entirely of her waist, still covering her pretty well. Though her tank top was still holding in, very tight over her form, holding on just over her nipples.<br />
Emily’s t-shirt is torn at the bottom but still intact, her jacket was still holding over the top, stretched absolutely to its limits, but it wasn’t even torn at the back. Niko was the same, his jeans had torn off, however, revealing his very elastic white underwear. His bulge hadn’t changed at all, other than looking even smaller on his inflated body. Emily’s boxers had done the same as Skylar’s father, with the lack of a bulge due to her lack of a bulge.<br />
Skylar’s sister’s clothing was thankfully fully intact, it hadn’t even broken a seam.<br />
<br />
You wondered why that was, surely every piece of clothing would have snapped in some way,<br />
“Sky...” you ask,<br />
“Yeah?” She says, still watching the last parts of the inflation, you decide to watch it too,<br />
“Why hasn’t their clothing fully broken yet?”<br />
“Huh? Oh yeah, I made a wish to say that their clothing was much much more durable and stretchable. I mean some of its broken, but I like the clothing showing their form and stuff... I guess it’s just really hot to me,”<br />
“Hmm... okay, I guess that makes sense,”<br />
“You said no judgment,” she remarks to you,<br />
“And no judgement is present,” you respond. She cracks a cute little smirk.<br />
<br />
You watch the everyone else, their growth slowing down to a halt.<br />
Everything she wished happened, they bloated until they became balloon-like, and they definitely couldn’t walk even if they tried. All they could do was roll and bounce.<br />
<br />
“Okay. Now, I wish their memories were back, and they don’t remember growing into these balls, they remember back from when I froze them.<br />
<br />
All of a sudden, a look of shock and horror is seen across the room. Everyone attempting to move their heads to look at each other, none able to do so. They wiggled their hands and feet as it was the only movement they were able to actually make.<br />
“I hope you’re all having fun. Now, me and my boyfriend are going to get out of your way. I hope you all have fun trying to figure yourself out around here, have fun!” She yells with a devilish grin. She grabs your arm and leads you towards the stairs, you stop her as she puts her first foot on the step. She looks back at you, you point to her inflated mother,<br />
<br />
“Ssssssssky...” her mother lets out,<br />
“Oh man. That’s gonna be annoying, I wish you can all speak,” Skylar says, she cocks her hip while leaning on the wall. She’s very confident with this power, “what do you want?” She says very sassily,<br />
“Skylar, I swear to god you better change us back or so help me I will ground you until you reach 100 years old,”<br />
“Hahaha!” Skylar bursts out laughing, fake laughter, mockery laughter. Her mother blushes, she clearly isn’t used to being pushed back on like this. Skylar walks up to her, looks her dead in the eyes with the sternest look you’ve ever seen her give, “I wish you lack any gravity,”<br />
<br />
You watch as Skylar’s mom lifts the tiniest bit of the ground, her face turns even more red. Skylar smirks, looks back at you, the back at her mother. She pushes her as hard as she possibly can, her mother flies across the room, hitting the ceiling, bouncing to the back wall, then back on the ground, then flies all across the room in various directions, hitting various surfaces.<br />
<br />
“I hope you all have fun, we’ll be upstairs if you need us... just hope you can fit through the door,” Skylar laughs again, she drags you with her.<br />
Emily is looking at you in the eyes, she’s not only scared, but a little betrayed. You mouthe “trust me”. From her expression, you can tell she understood you.<br />
<br />
You’re now upstairs with Skylar.</p>
