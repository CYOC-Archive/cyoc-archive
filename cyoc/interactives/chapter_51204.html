<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I want to be an amphibious dragon!&quot; you answer.<br />
&quot;Alright then,&quot; says Dr. Llewell, &quot;Let's begin. Now I'm going to cast the spell. It will <br />
work over the course of two weeks, so I want you to stay in your dorm while the <br />
changes are happening. Ready?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
~Draconius Amphibious!~ the doctor says, casting the spell on you. &quot;Now, do you have <br />
a roomate who can help you with tasks while you get used to your new body?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; you respond, &quot;I do.&quot;<br />
&quot;Good! Then I will come to your dorm in one week to check your progress.&quot;<br />
<br />
Leaving the office, you are excited about the transformation you would soon be <br />
experiencing. You had always loved dragons and had fantasized about being one. <br />
Now your dreams were about to come true! You reenter your dorm and find Julius <br />
waiting there. <br />
&quot;So how did it go?&quot; he asked. <br />
&quot;Dr. Llewell said I was perfect for qualification, so we settled on a course. I'm going to <br />
become a dragon!&quot;<br />
&quot;A dragon?! That's great! I mean, you love dragons, right?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot;<br />
&quot;But wait, don't dragon spells take a long time to work?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, about two weeks. I have to stay here until my transformation completes. Which <br />
reminds me, you wouldn't mind helping me get used to my new body, would you?&quot;<br />
&quot;Not at all!&quot; Julius responds, &quot;It's no problem!&quot;<br />
&quot;Thanks! You're a real pal!&quot;<br />
<br />
Over the next week, your transformation starts to take effect. You lose weight and hair, <br />
becoming lithe and hairless. You grow crystal blue scales all over your body, becoming <br />
a protective plating over your body. However, the scales at your heart are independant <br />
and movable so that you can access your Dragon's Heart* if you need to. You gain <br />
raw muscles and your limbs stengthen. Your face has become reptilian with a snout <br />
and blue slitted eyes. You grow a fin along your back, a tail with spikes, and don't <br />
breathe fire, but ice. However, you still retain a basically human form by the time Dr. <br />
Llewell checks up on you. The spell is working perfectly. Over the next few days, your <br />
hands and feet become claws and your body lengthens and becomes more <br />
serpentine. You find it hard to do certain tasks and you can no longer dress, leaving <br />
you embarassed and helpless around Julius. But the white-haired teen doesn't seem <br />
to mind and he has helped you regain coordination with your new features. But one <br />
new feature that you are uncomfortable with him seeing is your new dragon cock. It <br />
has turned red in coloration in sharp contrast to your scales. It has also grown in size <br />
to two feet in length and 3 inches around. It came with a matching pair of softball-<br />
sized balls. As your body grows to its full size, so does your equipment.<br />
<br />
One day, while Julius is at class, you decide to test your new package. You reach <br />
down with your new claw, being careful not to cut yourself, and begin to jerk off on <br />
your bed. The pleasure you feel is indescribable, you've never felt this good before. It <br />
feels like a cool energy is flowing through your dick with every stroke of the long, hard, <br />
reptilian member. Just as you are getting close, Julius walks in and looks right at you. <br />
&quot;Oh, god, Julius! I can explain!&quot;<br />
But then you notice that Julius is just standing there, looking at your cock dripping <br />
precum with a blank look on his face. <br />
&quot;Julius?&quot; you say, worried and confused. But he just keeps staring.<br />
Finally, he says, &quot;Master, you smell so good!&quot;<br />
&quot;Wait, what do you mean by 'Ma-ah!...&quot; you gasp in pleasure, for as you were <br />
speaking, Julius had come over to you, gotten on his knees beside the bed, and <br />
started to suck on your cock. <br />
&quot;Julius!...What are...you...doing?&quot; you manage in between waves of pure pleasure. <br />
&quot;I am pleasing the Master. Your cock is so good. Please feed me your seed, Master! <br />
You smell so good!&quot;<br />
You felt helpless. Of course you could have forced him to stop, but the immense <br />
pleasure you felt was leaving you unable to think straight.<br />
Julius was trying his best to get your entire 4 foot cock in his mouth, but found it <br />
impossible. So he got into the bed beside you and wrapped his whole body around the <br />
now 6 inch shaft, humping up and down while sucking on the tip. You moan in ecstasy <br />
at the feeling. You felt your balls draw up, ready to fill Julius with your dragon spunk. <br />
As you near your climax, you roar with pleasure and shoot your load into Julius's <br />
waiting mouth. He drinks it all down greedily even though you are cumming like a <br />
garden hose. You cum for almost five minutes! As the flow trickles to a stop, Julius <br />
releases your member from his mouth, gasping for air. You lay back on the bed in a <br />
state of euphoria. You turn your dragon head to look at Julius who, even though he <br />
had just nearly choked on your cum, was quickly stripping down. You had never seen <br />
Julius naked before, he had always had the courtesy to go in the bathroom. But now <br />
you could see his lithe swimmer's build. He was muscular, but not excessively. He <br />
was also completely smooth and hairless. Even around his large dick. It was big for a <br />
human, about 10 inches hard. And boy was it hard. Julius was already leaking pre. <br />
You got up on your elbows and looked at him. He had lust in his eyes, but he <br />
appeared to be controlling it somewhat. <br />
In a small voice, he asked, &quot;Master, please fuck me. I want to feel you inside me <br />
Master. Please fuck me.&quot;<br />
Suddenly you said, &quot;Yes, slave, I will fuck you,&quot; in a voice that was not your own. It <br />
was deeper, yet colder, and it definitely wasn't saying anything you normally would <br />
have said. But you soon found yourself almost automatically getting up and walking <br />
over to Julius who was now bent over his bed. Getting behind him, you stuck a finger <br />
in his ass to loosen him up, making sure to retract your claw. Once he seemed open <br />
enough, you took your finger out and spread your pre over your cock as lube. Then, <br />
your pulled your lower body back...and thrust your dick into Julius's waiting ass. At <br />
first, he yelps in pain and there's no room for you to move, but soon he starts to moan <br />
in pleasure and twist against your shaft. In no time he's loose enough that you can pull <br />
back enough to start thrusting again. While you hump him, Julius grinds his rump <br />
against your dick, creating a wonderful feeling in your nether regions. Soon you draw <br />
up and shoot your load into his ass, filling him up until his stomach enlarges. You <br />
finally soften and remove your shaft from Julius. Your &quot;slave&quot; is exhausted and just lies <br />
on the floor to sleep. With the sexual heat over, you stumble back to your bed and <br />
think. Why had Julius done that? More importantly why had YOU done that? You had <br />
always been straight, but now you were suddenly turned on by Julius's nude, sleeping <br />
form. Quickly, you grab a Playboy from under your bed. But the pictures still made you <br />
hard. &lt;Okay&gt; you think &lt;so dragons are bisexual&gt;. There was obviously a lot you <br />
didn't know about what you were going to become. So you Got on your laptop and <br />
looked up the kind of dragon you were. <br />
<br />
Norwegian Bluewater Dragon (Amphibious)<br />
Anatomy - Like its aquatic cousin, the amphibious Norwegian Bluewater is a serpentine <br />
dragon usu. 15 to 20 ft. in length. They have blue-green to saphire colored scales and <br />
no wings (though it is common knowledge that all dragons can fly). They have two <br />
pairs of legs, the front ones doubling as arms when it stands on its hind legs. They are <br />
also equiped with retractable claws and tail spikes which can be pulled in to make the <br />
dragon more hydrodynamic in the water. It also has a back fin which can be folded <br />
down for land use.<br />
Special Features - Unlike land and air dragons, sea dragons breathe an ice vapor <br />
instead of fire. This breathe can range from 0 deg. C (for common use) to absolute <br />
zero for hunting (so cold that everything in the affected area--except time--is instantly <br />
frozen still). Norwegian Bluewaters also have an extremely long lifespan, even for <br />
dragons, about 25,000 years. This makes them the longest living dragons alive. Most <br />
species only live 7,500 to 10,000 years (however, one dragon aging year is equivelant <br />
to about 100 human aging years). Another aspect of the amphibious Norwegian <br />
Bluewater is the feremone it gives off during sexual pleasure. This aroma makes any <br />
living creature that smells it the slave (mainly sexual) of the producer. The excrement <br />
also has the backfiring affect of making the producing dragon want nothing but sex for <br />
the duration of the feremone. Once a creature has been subjected to the feremone, <br />
they cannot be cured; they will serve that dragon forever. Aquatic Norwegian <br />
Bluewaters also have this feremone, but it's effects are negated in water, making it <br />
useless. Most Norwegian Bluewaters are bisexual and will mate with almost anything. <br />
Once they have chosen a partner, they usu. mate for life.  In addition to all this, all <br />
dragons have the ability to genitally or anally consume their meals. Meaning that they <br />
can digest their prey through their genitals by dissolving them into sex fluids <br />
(females=&quot;pussy juice&quot;, males=semen) or through their butts by absorbing them into <br />
their intestines. <br />
<br />
Now that you knew a bit more about what you were, you knew why this had happened. <br />
&lt;So, Julius is my slave&gt; you realize. But just as you were thinking how to fix this, you <br />
felt hungry. You checked the fridge and saw nothing, your stash of chips was dry, and <br />
your instincts were telling you to do something you knew you shouldn't; eat Julius. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
*A Dragon's Heart is an organ attached to the main heart which can be removed and <br />
placed inside another living creature to keep it alive as long as the dragon is alive. This <br />
means that the recipient can take any physical damage, besides beheadment, and still <br />
live. The only other way to kill the posessor of a Dragon's Heart is to kill the dragon. <br />
As a result, dragons rarely use this ability.</p>
