<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As soon as he put a foot outside their room, Riley realized that everything was different, at least, in his new perspective. Ceilings were closer to his head, doorframes were almost too narrow for his new physique and each step he made felt clumsy, like if he was walking on snow. Additionally, his thighs were so thick now that they constantly rubbed each other, and he even worried he could crush his enlarged testicles. Despite he didn&#39;t like the idea, he hadn&#39;t another choice but to start strut walking.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes, that seemed longer to him, Riley finally was in front of an elevator. He pushed the button and waited. While he was standing there, he took another look at his new body. Starting with his arms, they were massive, a mix of fat and muscle that made him felt strong and awkward at the same time. He touched them, feeling both his newly grown arm hair and the callouses on his hands. It felt so foreign that he can&#39;t still believe it was him. He kept telling himself he was dreaming.<br />
<br />
Then, he touched his gut, the biggest and more notorious part of his new body. It was full of dark brown curly hairs that moved from below his navel to his wide chest... and shoulders. Having a belly as big as a beach ball wasn&#39;t in his plan for this vacation, especially when it was pale, hairy and sweaty. He tried to ignore it in a attempt to reduce his shame, but it looks a lot of his sight when he looked down.<br />
<br />
However, if he talks about looking down there were several worse stuff in there. To begin, he now had the legs of a cetacean, figuratively. Also covered with a thick layer of hair and, judging by the touch, muscle and fat. They matched perfectly his new fat feet, probably a size 15, at last. He was kinda glad the hotel had put those huge flip flops in his bedroom, because there&#39;s no way he could find a pair of shoes that could fit the boats that his feet had become. He wiggled his fat hairy toes which he can still see despite his big gut and... his obscene bulge.<br />
<br />
&quot;At least they&#39;re no girls around.&quot; He told himself while he glance at the blue bulge that was still visible despite his big beach ball of a stomach. He looked side to side in case someone was nearby and then he held his dick a little ashamed that he liked the feeling. &quot;It&#39;s too big, even for this big body.&quot; He squeezed his balls and little and can&#39;t avoid let out a little moan. &quot;It&#39;s like holding two oranges and a banana between my legs.&quot; It felt so good, that he kept toying with his enlarged genitals despite someone could see him. The feeling was like nothing he can feel before as a kid.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, sir?&quot; Riley heard and suddenly remembered where he was and what he was doing. He immediately stopped what he was doing and in total shame he looked back to notice that a young man was smiling at him. He was pink pale with blue dyed hair and shaven body. He was only wearing a hot pink swimming trunk and black sandals, on a hand he was holding a bag from a store in the hotel. His green eyes were like emeralds looking directly into Riley&#39;s eyes. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I didn&#39;t want to interrupt you. My name is Kit, is my first day here and I&#39;m a little bit lost. I wanted to ask you for some help but I didn&#39;t notice you were, ehem, busy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, no no no. Don&#39;t worry.&quot; Riley replied very quickly. Despite he had a trimmed beard, it was noticeable the red in his cheeks. He can&#39;t avoid thinking this guy looks awesome like a celebrity or so. He was sure he had seen him before. &quot;Have I seen you somewhere before?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Only if you&#39;re a fan of gaming streamers.&quot; Kit smiled confidently before he look at his phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god!! You are O.K.Kit!!! I can&#39;t believe it!!&quot; Riley said super excited. &quot;Me and my friend are really huge fans of your work!! I didn&#39;t recognize you because in your last video your hair was silver.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I dyed it this morning.&quot; Kit smiled. &quot;I&#39;m glad I have some fans of your age, I was starting to think that only kids liked my content. What do you think if we take a selfie together?&quot; Without giving Riley enough time to think about, Kit took his phone and took a picture of them. &quot;I love taking pictures, but only the best ones goes to my social accounts. You know.&quot; Riley forgot about his recent embarrassment and acted like an very excited kid just nodding at whatever thing Kit said. &quot;So, would you help me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, sure.&quot; Riley smiled back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, I tried to ask for help at the lobby but they just gave me this bag and told me it would be helpful.&quot; Kit opened the bag. &quot;There&#39;s only a speedo and a pair of flip flops like yours, but they&#39;re too big. I don&#39;t think I can fit in them, maybe it was a hint that I&#39;ll meet a big guy like you.&quot; Riley blushed a little bit ashamed after hearing that, but then he realized what&#39;s for that stuff.</p>
<hr/><h3>
Would he tell Kit about it?</h3>
