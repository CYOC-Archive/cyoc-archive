<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Note: Hey iWTBAT. Glad to see you&#39;re back. And I also enjoyed &quot;Spellcasting&quot;. Here are a few chapters I written myself mostly last night. I think I stayed up all night... Anyways, I have written my own chapters during my three day absence before &quot;Spellcasting&quot; was posted. But now that I read, &quot;Spellcasting&quot;, I plan on writing alternate versions of these chapters to take &quot;Spellcasting&quot; into account. But for the sake of reference, I&#39;d thought I post the original chapters anyways. They are not perfect, But hopefully, I can polish things out in the alternate versions.<br />
<br />
This chapter acknowledges the events of &quot;Ilvir gets to talk to a Big League Monster the Lenuarian Hydra&quot; by an anonymous writer. I really like the idea of The Lenuarian Hydra. In fact, I really like the character ideas from that anoymous writer. Keep up the good work. I hope it&#39;s okay if I borrow some ideas. But I need to build up the villains first. <br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
<br />
There was one particular soul that simply didn&#39;t belong. It was a foreign soul that didn&#39;t get here by usual means. It has simply been watching from the shadows. Waiting for it&#39;s time to make it&#39;s move. And right now, the powerful soul has it&#39;s eyes on Ilivir. It couldn&#39;t care less about Ilivir&#39;s desperate offer. It can easily tell that Ilivir doesn&#39;t has as much control over the body as he claims he has. But the time to make it&#39;s appearance isn&#39;t right. Ilivir hasn&#39;t proven his worth yet...  It will have to wait for now... The right time will be coming soon enough...<br />
<br />
...<br />
 <br />
Ilivir was about to pick the soul he wishes to lend control to, when he had a evil thought.<br />
<br />
He remembered when Isaac made him his spawn, and how Ilivir basically became a gay slut for him. Ilivir is not going to deny the he enjoyed it, but he wants to be on the dominate end of the stick. That was when Ilivir realized who&#39;s body he is controlling right now: Isaac&#39;s. And that means he has all of Isaac&#39;s powers!<br />
<br />
&#39;On second thought, I changed my mind.&quot; Ilivir announced.<br />
<br />
Ilivir could hear the captured souls booing his name and cursing his name to the netherworld.<br />
<br />
&#39;Don&#39;t worry. I thought of a better solution. How would you like to ALL have bodies of your own?&#39;<br />
<br />
The souls went from booing to cheering and praising Ilivir&#39;s name. Some of the smarter souls were silent. They were suspicious of what Ilivir meant by giving all of them bodies.<br />
<br />
&#39;Alright! Give me a moment. I need to gather material.&#39; Ilivir anoucend. <br />
<br />
He then focused on the battle at hand.<br />
<br />
The party was slowly backing up the steps as the herd of dust bunnies were slowly gaining ground. That&#39;s not to say the two kids weren&#39;t making any progress while Ilivir was talking to the souls.<br />
<br />
The five possessed dust bunnies has merged back together to form a adult hybrid of a air dragon and a dust bunny. The former baby air dragon was doing a lot of damage by knocking dust bunnies off the stairway and into the fire. Nat was riding the adult sized Dust Bunny/Air Dragon hybrid as she figured out how to save magic energy by projecting fiery air sword slashes at the enemies. Shooting fire sword slashes are less costly then regular fire balls. And they seem to be cutting down the opposition very well.<br />
<br />
The situation was nowhere near as dire as it was a few seconds ago. Already, Ilivir can see about fifty dust creatures remaining. Ilivir can&#39;t help be feel new found respect for the kids.<br />
<br />
But if Ilivir is going to execute his plan, his allies need to leave some dust bunnies for him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop! I will handle the rest! Go on ahead to escape to the next floor! I will meet you there once I make sure these riff raft doesn&#39;t become a problem later!&quot; Ilivir commanded.<br />
<br />
Nat and the Dust dragon bunny turned towards Ilivir&#39;s direction. They nodded in understanding.<br />
<br />
Nat and the baby dragnny retreated up the stairs.<br />
<br />
But before, they could enter the door on the top of the pillar, they needed to reduce the baby dragon&#39;s size. So the baby took a deep breath and breathed corrupted air at thin air. The excess air left the baby&#39;s body and reduced it to a more manageable size.<br />
<br />
Ilivir did his best to defend himself until he heard Nan and the dragnny enter the door at the top of of the pillar.<br />
<br />
Once Ilivir was sure they were gone, he let out a wolfish grin. He&#39;s finally alone on this hellish floor.  Now to start the plan.<br />
<br />
Ilivir grabbed hold of two of the closest dust bunnies at once. As soon as he did, he commanded his metal crotch pouch to open up. Once it did, Ilivir released his twin reptilian cocks from their reptilian hiding place.<br />
<br />
Two huge, glowing purple cocks emerged from their reptilian slit.<br />
<br />
Ilivir wasted no time plunging his possessed cocks into both dust bunnies. One cock for each bunny. He started slowly, but he soon started picking up rhythm and speed until he was riding the rabbits in rapid fire. He was worthy of bunny sex.<br />
<br />
He used the two dust bunnies as shields as he fucked the essence out of them. Just like Dark Isaac before him, he felt the dust bunnies&#39;s corruption/essence go into Ilivir&#39;s body, and Azaviel&#39;s corrupt aurora going into the dust bunnies. As Ilivir thrust his cocks in and out, the two dust bunnies changed into bunny-shaped golems made of purple crystals.<br />
<br />
To make make maters better, as the other dust bunnies bit into the crystal golems, their essence were transferred through the purple crystals, into Ilivir. In other words, as the bunnies attack the bunny-shaped crystal golems, they are slowly becoming golems themselves the more they attack. All Ilivir has to do is to fuck the two golems in front of him, he will asorb the essence from all the remaining dust bunnies.<br />
<br />
Within a few mind-shattering moments, Ilivir has absorbed the corruption of the remaining fifty bunnies.<br />
<br />
Already, his reptilian form has changed to match all that dust bunny corruption Ilivir has assimilated.<br />
<br />
His reptilian feet became five feet long rabbit feet. His wolfish snout turned into a twitchy rabbit&#39;s nose. His snake fangs transformed into razor sharp rabbit fangs. His reptilian ear holes transformed into long rabbit ears. His enchanted sword dropped to the ground as his reptilian hands became paws fit for a rabbit. They are no longer suitable for holding a sword. Not that it matter. He doesn&#39;t necessary need hands for sex. His scales fallen off as flaky dust started covering every inch of his body. Soon, he was standing on his two feet a a anthropomorphic dust bunny. Complete with four arms, or rather six legs. His exterior may be completely made of dust but he still has the mummy straps, granite, fire, scales, fur, ice, vines, and all kinds of other types of corruption hidden inside his body. Right now, Ilivir&#39;s exterior resembles that of a living dust rabbit due to the corruption of about fifty dust bunnies he just absorbed..  Ilivir chose to change his body to resemble a dust bunny because he wanted to feel what it&#39;s like to be a dust bunny. Ilivir has always wondered what it&#39;s like to be in different bodies. Granted, he&#39;s still standing upright like a human.<br />
<br />
He no longer needs the captured souls&#39;s help. He has created a army of golems with the remaining dust bunnies. But he told the captured souls the he&#39;s going to give them bodies and he plans on sticking to his word. Right now, the purple crystal golems are just lifeless husks who are fueled by Azaviel&#39;s aura. They will follow Ilivir&#39;s every command but they have no soul...<br />
<br />
Ilivir is going to change that.<br />
<br />
Ilivir started thrusting the bunny shaped golems harder and faster. He was going into a furry frenzy. And soon, he started shooting corrupt demon cum at full blast like a waterfall. And in that cum was the soul of about fifty of his captured souls. Thanks to the lust golems touching each other, the souls were able to transfer to each golems just by touching each other. The golem spawns started taking the forms the souls who possessed him. Some reminded looking like dust bunnies, but others stated looking like the many creatures Isaac absorbed. The two newly created spawns Ilivir was currently fucking reformed to look like Sabrina the scubas and Sera the witch.<br />
<br />
Once Ilivir was done transferring the souls, his twin cocks calmed down. As he slid them out of the living purple crystal, the newly created army of spawns looked awards Ilivir for commands. The two spawns standing infant of him, Sabrina and Sera were the first to speak.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for giving us bodies master. How may we served you?&quot; Sabrina asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ilivir gave a wolfish grin the bast he could through his new dust bunny muzzle;e. &quot;You will be my personal sex slave my succubus. Now show what you know my slut!&quot; <br />
<br />
And so started fucking the succubus spawn like it was no tomorrow. The other spawns waited patiently as he fucked the scubas turned sex slave.</p>
