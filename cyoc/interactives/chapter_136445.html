<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brett stared in shock, his gay friend turned into a straight hunk right before his eyes...wait? Was it his friend or just one of those youth ministry jocks that pick on him?<br />
<br />
As the new reality kicks in...or at least temporary, Brett was a single gay man who was always picked on by the jocks at his school-specially the Christian ones.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, like his twin from an alternate reality, he loved being dominated. As he watched that swaggering gait of the olive tanned asian male, he couldn’t resist drooling over that firm bubble butt. It really is a turn on.<br />
<br />
As his tent began to rise, in a tease, the curse gave his eyes full focus. Watching the new Joel’s butt protruding out of his gym shorts and accentuated his back muscles as he lifted up his arms perpendicularly before FLEXING their strong muscular biceps. Dick just loving it as the curse kicks in with an arrogant-<br />
<br />
‘Heh! I can top dat!’<br />
<br />
“Huh? Whose there?” Brett turned around, being made away of that accentuated-cocky sounding voice, turning away from the direction of the gym jock he was admiring, wide open for ANOTHER jock to come in and-<br />
<br />
SLAP!<br />
<br />
Brett got slapped in the butt, feeling the strong male palm being pressed against his behind was enough to send him tenting even longer and GIRTHIER than before-reaching a prized ten inches erect, an incredible crusty caramel brown tan took hold as masculinity soared through his balls and groin, which too grew bigger and hairier as the size of his pelvis increases-THRUSTING into an accelerated transformation as the het bro that slapped him spoke.<br />
<br />
“Eh Gay! Found any hot chicks?” <br />
<br />
Gong chimed in, like the het-dar has been set off inside of Brett’s mind. Disgusted by the word Gay almost instantly, as his buttocks squared against the tight wetsuit domineeringly as a slap worthy bubble butt seeking for attention.<br />
<br />
“Hell No Bruh! Only Bros dude!” <br />
<br />
Almost instantly, he bit into his thumb and gave it a tight BLOW. Causing his arms to inflate with tight strong muscle, one of those of a man who got serious. Those rippling, bodybuilder biceps barely cared as they grew close to the size of a volleyball which obviously RIPPED apart those wetsuit sleeves, revealing a completely Malaysian dark tan, those veiny forearms clenching those fists which swelled to the size of a Gorilla. <br />
<br />
Rough calloused, accustomed to lifting weights and farm work back at the kampong, two black cotton sweatbands wrapped around both of his wrists, as he flexed his newfound masculinity and flexed in front of his fellow Malaysian Bro.<br />
<br />
“And Who ya callin’ gay? Gay!”<br />
<br />
Simultaneously, he bounced his growing pectorals which surfaced from the remains of his wetsuit. The upper part being ripped from the bottom and stretched far, the rubbery material pressing neatly against those rock hard nipples and emerging abdominals as the rubber shifted to black cotton. <br />
<br />
As he continued to flex his humongous arms, his IQ and lust for men degraded rapidly as it gets overwhelmed by the testosterone surging from below. His traps became swollen while his shoulders had spread far apart, coupled with intense muscle memory, his shoulder blades solidified alongside his entire back as his neck grew wide like his shoulders, supported by those natural jock trapezoids was a deep boom bass, with tons of a hammy and doofus exterior as he was not the brightest kid around.<br />
<br />
“Brightest?! Fuck who cares bout that when youse got MUSCLES LIKE DEEZ!” Bellowed in his shameless exterior, the hyper-masculine man overshadowed his former stalker-nobody gay self. <br />
<br />
It was like he is BEGGING to be found.<br />
<br />
He channeled his newfound cockiness to his pecs, fully emerged as complete basketballs, as he began bouncing them back and forth effortlessly like some choreographed photoshoot. Sweat glistening those eight cobblestone glazed abs as they laugh at the beta faggots getting aroused by his bod before he launched his hate speech at the end of those indecent shoots. Sure he needed money and that bodybuilding and simply modelling as a Malaysian in America was not sufficient, but he also knew tons of fags are lonely *********** that drool at the sight of em. <br />
<br />
SO WHY NOT SET EM STRAIGHT?!<br />
<br />
Almost instantly with that thought, as a plain black XL tank top rests firmly over his proud raised tanned chest with minute signs of hair due to needing to be shaved cause of modelling, the inflation bursted through his thighs, all the way to his knees with a Bam...BAM!BAM! <br />
<br />
His body devoid of white as now his face was covered in those dark tan genes which consists of multiple races except those originating from China or that screams caucasian. He gave his bro a dopey smile as Ma Ting’s mind was affected by the curse to register everything being fine-only stopping when his bro is complete.<br />
<br />
As those trunks of his legs stood up tall and strong as an incredible 6ft 5, his boner could not help but throb over and over. Partly because of the old Brett and mostly due to memories of how women would would just massage those-<br />
<br />
FEET! Toes bursting out as they wiggled in that dark brown partially asian tone, itching for ladies-while not as strong as men for massaging-was perfect for a different kind of massage. To trace down and feel every bit of him, tease and play with him before trailing down his legs...up to his-<br />
<br />
“MAN I NEED SOME PUSSY! STAT!”<br />
<br />
Pretty restless, as the remaining bit of clothes came swarming over those muscular thighs of his. The old fabric wrapped them with dark blue stretchable cotton with two strings attached to it, as he moved around a bit-his incredible 10 inches instantly tented at the sight of the babes around the corner.<br />
<br />
“FUCKING HOT!”<br />
<br />
The remaining fabric below confined his masculinity of his feet into a pair of dark socks and black sports shoes with a swoosh to them. XL and large, much larger than that fucker-<br />
<br />
“JOEL YOU FUCKING COCK SUCKER!”<br />
<br />
The asian jock heard that statement and responded back in rivalry.<br />
<br />
“WHO YOU CALLING COCKSUCKER YOU FUCK?!”<br />
<br />
The negative chemistry between the two heterosexuals hit off, with every insult towards gays or anyone that demonstrated fag behavior, their rivalry tightened even further. As tons of dialogue of their native language fly by one another, the extreme vulgar and excessive desperation for ladies affected his final outlook.<br />
<br />
Clenching his fists, he recalled all those long hours of training at the gym with his bro Gong, even longer as well as he had to be in perfect shape for every competition. His jaw widened at the thought of whooping Joel, as an array of hair perfectly lined up along the edges of his face-connecting at the end of his lantern jaw was a perfect chinstrap beard, with stubble of after shave appearing over his upper and lower lip.<br />
<br />
His nose and lips plumped out, as his eyebrows became much hairier before they get perfectly trimmed away into stylish-manly men brows. Confidence and cockiness arising as his hair gets swept up into a simple medium length jock cut, sides shaved into a stylish fade as his eyes burned a burning desire for women and-<br />
<br />
 “Eh Bro, got your back!”<br />
<br />
Brad Kushani’s caramel brown eyes flickered widely into existence. Arm hugging his best bud as his eyebrows arched, his pearly whites smiled a devious smirk.<br />
<br />
Both of them sneered at the youth ministry, the muscle clique needed bros like em. Shame those American-residential Christian fuckers Joel, Ryan and Lucas could flaunt their muscles without immigration laws stopping em’<br />
<br />
Brad growled, especially at Joel. HE THINKS HE TOUGHER THAN ME?! Remarking, he wasn’t really the brightest of the bunch-and only getting a visa due to his extreme talent in bodybuilding whereby he was scouted by a modelling career. <br />
<br />
The perfect skin complexion, hair, and height. Something Gong could never manage but hey-Ma Ting had intelligence for uni. Pussies like Joel are not man enough to MAN UP the modelling industry, stupid sheltered faggot by his asian parents. Hope Gong shows that fucker Joel out with the noble prize.<br />
<br />
Brad-or at least that was what his friends and babes called him-was his name. The Malaysia  originated hunk gave a tight punch onto his shorter bud on the shoulder as they both smirked. In a different universe, they’d probably be bearers of the heterophobe curse and actually be gay for each other. But in this one, no homo bruh.<br />
<br />
“Eh bro-back me up, gonna show these fuckers who the real men are N score us some BABES!”</p>
