<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Awakening to the first morning of what would become a different world to Anna, she and her added spiritual guide Circe, together, alive and mutually alert.<br />
<br />
Young and easily impressionable, Anna began this new day in the same manner she had for most of her short lived lifetime. A morning shower to bathe away the sleep from out her eyes, a hair wash to remove the oiliness and leave then her a head of silky soft long and flowing blonde hair. <br />
<br />
The young age did nothing to give her that coming shapely womanly form, if not for the soft voice and her long hair, Anna could easily fake being a boy. Girl that she was in reality, Anna had in her manners and delights many things that to her elder brother labeled her as a Tom-boy.<br />
<br />
On this cool morning, Anna donned on a long sleeve blouse with a pair of wear washed jeans, some thick white cotton socks and her playtime tennis shoes, they looking as dirty as would Anna by the end of that fun filled day. Teeth brushed, hair combed, she then bounded down the stairs to join the family already getting ready the morning breakfast and making plans for the day.<br />
<br />
Brothers are always acting brash, bold, and ruthless to anyone their younger, and brother Ken to Anna was no exception. He found great humor in doing things to and or saying suggestive ideas about what his younger and often quite gullible sister would say she had plans to do for and on any day.<br />
<br />
All of what for brother Ken would seem the same that morning as had it for many a morning before, but this day dawned with a sullen change in the general plan as to who and whom was the joker and the fool.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning Miss Anna Hanna Banana, and what girlishly plans do you have for today?&quot; Ken asked his sister, his tone and words already trying her patience and making fun of his sister and her usual morning breakfast of eating cereal with a sliced banana soaking in a bowl of milk. <br />
<br />
Even before the girlish Anna in her youthful manner might respond to the leading and terse question of her brother, the wit present of Circe made a reply. &quot;Good morning brother Ken, my but you are looking rather acting and looking rather beastly today; not having shaved any of that peach-fuzz using Dad's shaver, and with a head of uncombed hair, you are acting like an ignorant and brutish animal plodding to pasture for his morning mouthful of dew soaked grass.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ken stood there a bit astonished at the vivid remark made to him, he being about everything as what Anna had described, with the present exception of his looking then yet like a male animal going from the barn to a pasture wet in morning dew.<br />
<br />
&quot;My, my but we are full of vocabulary and wise ideas today little sister, it would seem the becoming of twelve years old has aged and matured you greatly.&quot; Ken making sport of his sister, he using his sneering half smile grin as if he had something in mind to make for Anna some situation as a virtual bit of Hell.<br />
<br />
Angered by her brother, and with Circe adding her two cents to the brother/sister general battle of words, it began with Anna slapping her ringed finger and hand, giving her bigger brother an enchanting smack at his unwashed and oily maleness tucked loosely, commando style in his pair of blue jeans.<br />
<br />
The slap might have felt to Ken as a slight bang to his male pride, but having used and touched the clothed male organ with the Circean finger ring, a jolt of special jacking juice did spark a new beginning of growth to an already morning ejaculated jock.<br />
<br />
A weary gaze down at a usually well mannered sister and the feeling he felt from the ring and slap to his maleness, Ken did not know quite what to make of what the slap made for him to feel.<br />
<br />
Walking past her brother, Anna stepped by him walking as with a sense of new-fond pride. &quot;Out of my way brother bull, so much you are beginning to look the part of becoming a black bull, vile minded, and devoid of any manners and or using little common sense!&quot; Anna giving her brother a few added words of enchanting guidance; Circe knowing of what soon her dear brother Ken would feel, see, and begin to realize a coming experience.<br />
<br />
That morning meal seemed overly quiet, whether from the mom of dad not having the arbitrate between the drastically varied attitudes of a sister and her brother, the eating went forward as if all wished for to head off in differing directions, and soon! <br />
<br />
Breakfast done and after a some words of prayer and thanksgiving offered by a father to his God and family, bother brother and sister parted their ways, Anna giving her big brother a still sharper slap at his groin by her using bother backhand and her birthday ring. Anna forged ahead, she running though the kitchen and out the back-door to begin a new day of play.<br />
<br />
Ken felt an odd sense of needing to go back upstairs and to the bathroom, as if his bladder required added emptying, he having that morning already soaked, fouled, and peed all over the toilet seat.<br />
<br />
His entering the bathroom beget into action the enchantment desired by Circe and begun with the slap, picking of her ring at his maleness. As Ken unzipped his jeans, his fingers searched for what he expected would be there and readily feeling the need for release of a building flood.<br />
<br />
Oddly, searching fingers failed to find what they had found only  an hour or so before, as in his groin he had two rather huge big furry testicles, and from them surged upward, a fur covered inset tube, it knobby and pressing up and under his jean pants belt buckle. The jerking up of a T-shirt from unbuttoned blue jeans helped allow the falling out of what to Ken, he standing there stupefied and surprised. He saw not his big prick, but a furry black, tubular shaft, a coarse haired furry sheath and from it stuck out a warm, very pink, and completely uncircumcised head of a male organ not his, and fervently similar to that what hangs off the belly of a mature bull. <br />
<br />
Shaking and nervous fingers held gingerly at the soft and highly sensual feeling beastly shaped prick. Ken feeling an urge requiring relief, he tried pointing the male organ downward, it kinking sharply as he forced it to spew forth the load inside the bathroom toilet.<br />
<br />
So very much more sensual was this his suddenly all new and very different prick, Ken felt the urge and then a need to begin his stroking of it. As his hands smoothed and gripped at the taunt but wrinkled skin covering that elongated mighty shaft; Ken felt this happened due to what Anna did and had said.<br />
<br />
Insurgent stroking to the elongated hot and very pink colored male organ did excite and arouse from in the groin of Ken, a wanton need to spew forth a building load. Seven base to end strokes of his very different male organ and what surged forth, spewing a splattering of juices and chunky semen upon the bathroom mirror, Ken stood there, he eying the mess, and finding his nose rather found enjoyment from the smell his juices put into the air.<br />
<br />
Relief from certain new arousal sensations had Ken not speak forth a few words of self- admiration, but he stood there eying the bathroom mirror and with a deeply inhaled breath, Ken moaned forth a throaty sounding bellowed moo like a cry coming out of a horny big bull.</p>
