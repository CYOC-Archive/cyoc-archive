<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jim took the cool glass of water that Andrew handed him, sipping it and trying to make sense of things. As much as he tried to tell himself that he wasn’t in college and that he didn’t have a twin brother, the reality that those were both the truth was staring him in the face. He did his best to remember the truth, but even the events of a few moments ago were becoming harder and harder to recall.<br />
<br />
“Hey, bro… was there some kind of weird program on my computer...?” Jim mumbled as he drank the water, hoping for some kind of confirmation that he wasn’t going nuts.<br />
<br />
“Huh?” Andrew turned around and looked at him oddly. “No, it was on Luke’s computer, right? It showed a picture of yourself that you could mess around with or something?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah! That’s it!” Jim said, then he frowned. “…Who’s Luke?”<br />
<br />
The two young men looked at each other, both of them wrestling with their new and conflicting memories. With both of them having changed themselves using the Chronivac in a short time, reality was having a hard time readjusting to the new changes in a way that made complete sense. Andrew could remember being Amanda, but also growing up with Jim as her twin brother. Jim, on the other hand, could vaguely recall both being Andrew’s father and brother. But at the center of things was Luke, who despite not having a ‘place’ in this new reality was still in the back of their heads.<br />
<br />
“Dude, something weird is going on here,” Andrew said, scratching his head. “We need to check out that program or something. It… It did something to you, right?”<br />
<br />
“I think so. It’s hard to remember, bro,” Jim said, finding it easier by the second to just accept Andrew as his brother instead of his son.<br />
<br />
“Come on, let’s check it out,” Andrew said, pulling Jim to his feet and heading back to Jim’s bedroom, which had shifted slightly in the short time since he had left it. The room was smaller than before, the size of a cheap single bedroom in a two-bedroom apartment. It was strewn with clothes, with a pile of sweaty workout clothes in the corner giving the room a masculine, musky smell. Jim could remember working out with his twin brother that morning in the shared living room, where they stored all their weights and other equipment. Nothing motivated Jim to work out and get stronger more than having his twin bro around to compete against… No, that was just these weird new memories! He shook his head and turned on his computer again, double clicking the icon and pulling up the program for the second time.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, that’s what it did for me too,” Andrew said, watching as a detailed, nude image of Jim was created on the screen, not even being a least bit bothered seeing his bro’s naked body. He’d seen it a hundred times before. Hell, they’d worked out in the buff together just the day before. As twins, being offended by one another&#39;s bodies just seemed ridiculous.<br />
<br />
After the image had been generated, Jim hand slipped and he clicked an option without realizing it. Red words flashed on the screen. “Twin link in effect. Do you wish to continue?” Jim read, unsure of what was going on. “It didn’t do that last time, right?” He impatiently clicked the screen, and suddenly a perfect recreation of Andrew was standing next to the image of Jim.<br />
<br />
The differences between the two twins were on full display, with Andrew being a little shorter and stockier, while Jim was a bit taller and leaner. While they both had matching blond beards, Andrew’s hair was trimmed shorter and he was coated in a fine layer of body hair across his whole body, while Jim had grown his hair out a bit longer and his body hair was mostly focused around his chest and pubic area.<br />
<br />
“Twin link recalibrating. New changes applied to both subjects,” a voice from the computer said. The twins watches as the images on the screen began to shift subtly, blurring and blending until a single image was all that remained, taking elements from both young men to make a single person.<br />
<br />
The new image had Jim’s height and Andrew’s broad shoulders, a fine dusting of hair across the whole body but with a particularly impressive bush around its heavy cock and ball, and finally a handsome medium-length haircut. The image’s face was a mix of the two men’s features, taking Andrew’s gentle cheeks and brow and adding elements of Jim’s strong jaw, with the computer creating the most handsome and attractive mix of features it could manage.<br />
<br />
“Whoa, that’s… Is that us?” Jim muttered to himself, clicking absentmindedly on the image and accidentally hitting the ‘accept’ button once again, and a surge of energy shot out from the computer and slammed into both young men.<br />
<br />
Andrew groaned as he felt himself stretching out, growing taller until his height matched his twin brothers, while Jim felt his physique grow more broad and bulky to match Andrew. Both men felt their skulls shifting around, their features morphing until they were mirror images of one another, and they felt an itch around their body as hair grew and moved around across their bodies.<br />
<br />
Within moments, the two young men were no longer simply twins, but identical twins, so identical that even their parents and best friends could never tell them apart. Memories of playing pranks as children filled their memories, doing things like going to each other’s classes and using their identical appearances to confuse strangers. They were closer than any brothers could hope to be, seeing one another as extensions of themselves. Sharing everything, from shirts to underwear to lovers.<br />
<br />
Andrew and Jim panted as they grappled with these new memories, beginning to see themselves as true twins in every sense of the world. “Bro… What the hell was that?” they both said in unison, then laughing when they realized what they’d done. They straightened up and got a good look at each other, memories settling in and making it harder to remember what they had looked like only minutes earlier…</p>
