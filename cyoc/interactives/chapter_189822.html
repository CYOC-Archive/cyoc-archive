<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Richard felt fairly relieved by how quiet things had gone over dinner, particularly as how rushed and rapid things had changed within the family dynamic considering that the night before he&#39;d become a werelion and then Rose had essentially pushed the right buttons that in turn lead to her becoming a werelioness as well. There were some things that could have been done better, he didn&#39;t deny that, but those things were what they were and couldn&#39;t be changed, and that ultimately also applied to what had happened with regard to what happened with Rose having to strip off her clothes to then safely transform as well. He remembered tearing his clothes apart at the seams in his transformation and the same thing largely happened with Rose in her first transformation. Their fursonas were too big for their human clothes and particularly the clothes they wore as normal humans, which were a bit on the small side. Now, it could be possible that things could be they&#39;d be uneasy with things now, and Richard could even agree with that, but then, there could also be the point that with the fact that they would likely be in Moon Lake for a long time now, it would be quite likely that Frank, Rachel, and Rob would probably see a fairly large number of naked weres at some point in the future and given Rachel&#39;s best friend had become a were and had apparently had a werefox bond to her, she&#39;d likely end up having sex with a werefox at some point.<br />
<br />
But for the moment some of those things with Rachel could still be something for the future and the rest regarding Rose was so new that it was understandable all of the Van Direstag children could be uneasy. Particularly as Richard and Rose had often did their best to make sure that none of their children saw them naked. Becoming werelions had changed that and changed some of the requirements for that. That in turn left dinner rather quiet and neither Richard nor Rose could fully find a way to get some things to turn to either other subjects or anything that would be different from the two werelions eating dinner at the table with them. After a little while, Frank finished and slowly stood up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dinner was great, mom, thanks,&quot; Frank said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re welcome, dear,&quot; Rose answered doing her best to keep her voice low and finding that in her present form it was rather easy to increase the volume, even if that wasn&#39;t intended or expected.<br />
<br />
&quot;In the meantime... I still have some things and notes to copy down onto paper since I have to turn the computer in tomorrow morning,&quot; Frank then spoke and looked to Richard, &quot;you remember that, right, dad?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Richard nodded, &quot;and Rose and I will have an alarm set to both be ready to drop you off... but to also begin scouting out things for our store.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that Frank departed, though Rachel was soon to join him.<br />
<br />
&quot;And the internet seems to be working here,&quot; Rachel commented, &quot;and with my homework done, I&#39;d think I&#39;ll give the fans a bit of an update on things.&quot;<br />
<br />
That was something in relation to Rachel&#39;s channel on YouTube. Richard and Rose knew that was mostly a diary sort of entry, at least based on what they&#39;d seen of it. It hinted at some of Rachel&#39;s talent for play acting and drama, but she had managed to keep things tactful. Though while Richard had his issues with the Mandatory Were Law, and in fact STILL had them, given what had happened, he thought it wise not to try anything directly related to Moon Lake. If Moon Lake could have or would have forced the whole family to become weres for trying to flee, he wouldn&#39;t want to know what the penalty would be for exposing weres. At the same time, there were other fears in the back of his mind that made him fear what most people might do while not knowing about weres.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just remember not to say anything explicitly were related,&quot; Richard advised, &quot;we&#39;ve already skirted dangerously close to what the city would tolerate thanks to me. I&#39;d doubt they&#39;d take kindly to exposing weres to all humanity.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Rachel nodded and then followed Frank out, which left Richard and Rose only with Rob.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;d best clear the dishes,&quot; Rose said to Richard, &quot;as we&#39;ll also then have some business related to our pride and settling your coalition.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Coalition?&quot; Rob asked silently from his seat at the table making Richard and Rose both turn. Their youngest was still there, standing next to his chair, but he hadn&#39;t left.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Richard said slowly, &quot;werelions seem to have the instincts and &quot;social structure&quot; like that of mundane lions. A pride with multiple females and one male, often with a ratio of male for every six females. Prides that have more females will often have at least a second male and that partnership between males is called a &quot;coalition.&quot; And as I and Rose explained earlier... while we&#39;re learning some of the specific &quot;rules&quot; that go along with werelion society... I&#39;m to be placed in coalition with an Elijah Hunter to learn the male werelion&#39;s role.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I the werelioness&#39;s role,&quot; Rose added, &quot;once that&#39;s done... Richard and I will have our own small pride. For now there won&#39;t be many to it... and we&#39;ve agreed to balance leadership in that pride between both of us. We&#39;d work together.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Rob said slowly and looked down for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, lets get to cleaning up,&quot; Richard than spoke, &quot;I&#39;ll see to seeing what possible leftovers we have...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can help,&quot; Rob volunteered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well,&quot; Rose gave a smile, &quot;you can help me rise the dishes.&quot;<br />
<br />
They then set about those tasks and they went fairly quickly, particularly with Richard finding that most of the beef stew had been eaten. There were some leftovers, but not as much as they often had. Though Richard figured that had more to do with his appetite growing larger. He took one of the larger soup bowls out and moved what remained of the beef stew into it. It ultimately filled much of the bowl, but there was some space. From there, Richard placed the now empty pot in which the stew had been cooked by the sink, placed some cling wrap over the bowl and put it in the fridge. He heard the sink run as Rob brought plates, knives, forks, and glasses to Rose at the sink, though at the end, there came a knock at the front door.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll get it,&quot; Richard spoke as he walked out of the kitchen.<br />
<br />
Things were calm as he crossed the living room to the front door, though he opened it to a surprise. Standing there was a woman, but not just any woman. She carried a werelion&#39;s scent and one that Richard recognized, Shelia Wiggleston, the werelion he&#39;d stumbled onto and became a werelion as a result. She was fairly beautiful in human form with straight hair, dark eyes, and mocha colored skin and was dressed fairly comfortably in a pair of jeans and a tee-shirt. Though she was wearing sandals. She gave a bit of a smile as she looked to Richard answering the door in his were form.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shelia...&quot; Richard said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, Richard,&quot; Shelia said calmly and with a smile, &quot;adjusting well, I see...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am,&quot; Richard answered nervously, &quot;though... this had more to do with some other adventures that went on today... Let&#39;s just say I needed to track someone down and this form was better for it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope no one was hurt,&quot; Shelia answered, remembering what happened the night before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thankfully, no one was,&quot; Richard nodded, &quot;would you like to come in?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Shelia answered, &quot;though I didn&#39;t plan on staying long... I just wanted to see on how your wife was doing? I would assume she&#39;s been released from the hospital.&quot;<br />
<br />
Richard didn&#39;t get the time to answer as Rose&#39;s voice was soon heard coming from behind him, making him turn around to see Rose approaching with Rod following slightly to her right side.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was this morning,&quot; Rose spoke as she came into the room and noted some surprise on Shelia&#39;s eyes when she saw Rose, &quot;though... I must also apologize for getting upset last night. I mean... Richard&#39;s transformation was a surprise and a part of me expected that a good portion his mind wouldn&#39;t change even after his becoming a werelion. So in seeing him show interest in you and knowing I couldn&#39;t compete... while battling a few other surprises... I panicked thinking that in trying to get my husband to calm down about Moon Lake that I&#39;d lost him... or was losing him. It&#39;s only when I woke up in the hospital and learned hat Richard had killed the Mountain Lion that attacked me that I got some sense that I over-reacted.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s no problem,&quot; Shelia said slowly and in awe of the new werelion before her. She hadn&#39;t thought Rose would be in a position to safely change after being attacked by a mundane Mountain Lion, but either A) the doctors found that the wounds looked worse than they in fact were or B) the two Van Direstags had gotten a bit too intimate. &quot;That sort of thing can happen a lot with new residents to Moon Lake, particularly those that are unused to the fact that werelion society is effectively a big &quot;swinger&#39;s club.&quot; Though...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Swingers?&quot; Rob asked glancing between his mother and the newly arrived woman.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rob, this is Shelia Wiggleston,&quot; Richard said, &quot;she is the were that transformed me... and one that your mother and I need to talk to. So it would be best you went on upstairs, and make sure that Rachel, at least, gets to bed at a decent hour as Shelia, your mother, and I have some pride matters to discuss.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rob slowly nodded and began to make his way around the corner to move toward the stairs that weren&#39;t too far from the short door. Sheila paid him little mind and looked over to Rose who approached at first to stand beside Richard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not to say that I&#39;m not thrilled to be invited into a pride,&quot; Shelia said slowly, &quot;but... how...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It came shortly after I was released from the hospital,&quot; Rose answered softly, hoping that Rob wouldn&#39;t hear, &quot;Richard drove me home... and looked very good in his old clothes that they practically clung to his very muscular form in his human form. And that... well... it got me very curious, and well...&quot; Rose paused to give a small smile, &quot;I got &quot;it&quot; and from there... I was soon changing, feeling the burning need for Richard, and well, things went on from there. It was by surprise and it happened fast, but in some ways I couldn&#39;t help myself, and I loved it. And thankfully... I survived the transformation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can see that,&quot; Shelia smiled as she looked Rose over and felt herself growing a bit wet at noting how Rose&#39;s now ample bust  better balanced her hips and matched her muscle, &quot;though...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It happened fast and I never expected something like this... so, getting the specialized birth control pills wasn&#39;t done,&quot; Richard said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I did go into heat with my transformation... so I probably am pregnant, or will be,&quot; Rose commented, &quot;but sure were pregnancy is no different from the other three pregnancies I&#39;ve had. Though... would the baby be born in its fursona if I&#39;m transformed when in labor... or?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, baby weres will always be born in human form, regardless of what form the mother gives birth in,&quot; Shelia answered, &quot;and won&#39;t have their first transformation until on or after their fourteenth birthday.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that&#39;ll be alright,&quot; Rose answered as she approached, &quot;and I will also admit that one of the things that surprised me was that you offered to help me turn last night... as I&#39;d never thought of anyone ask that of me. I mean, I dabbled a bit in college, but never went all the way and once I fell in love with Richard...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re bi... like me?&quot; Shelia asked growing a bit warmer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Which is why Richard and I agreed to invite you into our pride,&quot; Rose answered, &quot;something of a reward for the proverbial wake up calls  you gave us. Richard with regard to weres... and me in well... making an offer I hadn&#39;t felt the need for until now and after becoming a werelion myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I humbly accept the invitation,&quot; Shelia smiled and stepped out of her sandals, &quot;I&#39;ve never really been attached to a pride before. I&#39;ve hung out with Elijah&#39;s pride from time to time, but he&#39;s never had a coalition partner, so there are some times when I&#39;m the odd girl out and his girls aren&#39;t bi, so they may be friendly and conversational, but girl on girl action would make them uncomfortable. So other times, I&#39;ve flirted with some of the werecats in the area from time to time or any other bi were that might be looking for some fun. There&#39;s a weretigress who teaches at the Middle School who is very fun... it&#39;d be nice to be in a pride.&quot;<br />
<br />
Richard gave a slow smile as Shelia began to lift up her shirt and lay it down on the back of the couch revealing the pink E cup bra she was wearing. He caught some scent of arousal coming from Shelia, but also some growing from Rose. The scent was enough to get some beginning of a rise out of him Especially as Shelia undid her bra and then laid it on top of her shirt, letting her breasts bounce free for a moment and with her nipples growing slightly erect.<br />
<br />
&quot;And it would be nice to have you,&quot; Rose smiled as she reached forward and softly caressed Shelia&#39;s left breast. It was soft yet firm and Rose could feel that through the fur and the pads on her paw-like hands. It was lovely, and in a way better than just feeling her own breasts and Shelia gave a low moan and a smile in response.<br />
<br />
&quot;And if you&#39;ve never gone all the way with a woman,&quot; Shelia answered, &quot;I&#39;d be happy to be your first and give you some pointers... particularly in adapting to being a were now, yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And both of us can have turns with Richard,&quot; Rose smiled again as she backed up and Shelia began undoing the button to her pants.<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds like fun,&quot; Richard said slowly, &quot;but while inviting you into our pride was one of the things that has been on our &quot;to do&quot; list for the day after Rose&#39;s transformation, there is also the entrance into coalition with Elijah Hunter that I have to do. As Rose and I did meet with Leon Talbot, told him weren&#39;t out to challenge his &quot;throne&quot; or authority among Moon Lake&#39;s werelions... and it did go reasonably well... but I have been assigned to work in coalition for a while with Elijah Hunter... learn the ropes as it were. When it&#39;d be okay to be &quot;aggressive&quot; when it&#39;s not and all that sort of thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shelia nodded as she tossed her pants on top her shirt and bra on the couch and then removed her panties and did the same. It wasn&#39;t long after that she began to shift as was. Richard and Rose looked on as golden-tan colored fur began to grow across her body with the fur on her breasts and belly being more of a creamish color. Shelia raised her hand to marvel as her fingernails lengthened and curved a bit as they shifted into claws and she smiled, revealing enlarging teeth, and mentally enjoying the growing scent of arousal she could pick up. As her feet began to lengthen, she felt herself rising up into a digitigrade stance while her tail began to grow out behind her. It wasn&#39;t long before she could stand up and look into Rose&#39;s presently bronze/gold colored eyes. She could feel herself growing more aroused as well, picking up more on those scents, particularly as her hips and breasts grew out a bit more to match her enlarged size. Proportionately they were still an E cup on her, though glancing to Rose&#39;s new form, Shelia had the sense that Rose might be slightly bigger than Shelia was now that Rose had become a werelion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then we&#39;d best be going,&quot; Shelia spoke, &quot;if you were assigned for that... Elijah is probably waiting for you both. For tonight it will probably just be little more than a simple introduction and he&#39;ll let you know when his pride meets. Your lessons will really take place during those meetings.&quot;<br />
<br />
Richard and Rose both nodded as Shelia then turned and walked toward the front door again. The two of them followed, having the sense that while they may have had a lot of things running at a rather hectic pace, they did seem to get everything done and without too much difficulty. They went out the door with Richard shutting it. They came out onto the street and their ears could pick up some of the sounds that had gone on in Moon Lake that were something that seemed to hum with that primal and natural energy, with often sexual overtones to it After shutting the door, Richard then turned to Rose and offered her his arm as he began to walk toward the sidewalk and then up toward the corner. Once there they turned west onto Wild Street Rose gladly accepted his arm, though Shelia soon took the other one and the three walked together.<br />
<br />
The lower light wasn&#39;t a problem, and in some ways, Rose and Richard didn&#39;t feely any real concern about being out in their transformed form. Of course with the size they had gained going from human to were form, even the clothes that Richard and Rose had bought for their human forms wouldn&#39;t fit them now. Richard noted the subtle differences in their fur color between the three of them, the well developed muscles, even for females that Rose and Shelia had. He also noticed how at ease things seemed and how occasionally Shelia and Rose would look to him and then to each other. It gave him some idea that the shared pride that he and Rose had discussed earlier would work. Though it wasn&#39;t long before they came up on Elijah Hunter&#39;s home at 567 Wild Street.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... here goes nothing,&quot; Richard began and approached the door and pressed the doorbell that was to the right of the door.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t long after that the door opened and Elijah came out. Unlike the night before when Richard had met him, Elijah was transformed this time, standing on par with Richard in terms of height and sporting a thick dark mane that easily circled his head and the back of his neck as well as the front of it. He had more of a brownish-tan coloration to his fear and the main part of his fur on the chest and inner legs was a slightly lighter shade, though the mane was all very dark in color. Unlike Richard, Elijah&#39;s abdominal muscles were more easily visible and were well developed, meaning that Elijah&#39;s fursona was based more on the African Lion, Panthera Leo Melanochaita, than the Asiatic Lion, Panthera Leo Leo.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, sir,&quot; Richard spoke, &quot;I come with my wife... to ask for coalition status... at least until I can learn more the ins outs on appropriate werelion behavior.&quot;<br />
<br />
Elijah slowly nodded, &quot;Yes... Leon did give me call to say that you were in need of that sort of thing. Though, good to see that you&#39;re doing well and that your wife is looking better.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;m feeling better too,&quot; Rose spoke, &quot;I&#39;d thank you, Mr. Hunter for helping get the ambulance to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In terms of saving your life, that would go more to your husband,&quot; Elijah answered, &quot;I only arrived to find the aftermath.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rose nodded.</p>
