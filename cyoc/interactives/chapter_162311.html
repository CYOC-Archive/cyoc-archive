<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Well, there doesn&#39;t seem to be a time limit built into the spell.&quot; Sheila said looking back at her large horse half noticing her tail flicking back and forth as well as noting that everyone else seemed to find having horse halves pretty normal for this world. &quot;And it&#39;s not like having a horse body is very bad at all, in fact I would like to see more from this world before we pretty much destroy it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahh, thanks Sheila. I knew you also liked Centaur World as well.&quot; She chuckled. &quot;I&#39;m feeling pretty hungry, maybe we can see what type of food us centaurs eat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I might stay here at the library and do more digging into this world. I&#39;m not to hungry, maybe get me something while you&#39;re at it. I&#39;ll pay you back when we get back to normal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t need to pay me for anything. I&#39;m sure you could magically make money appear with a snap of your fingers with that book of yours. I&#39;ll get you something just for taking us here, or whatever.&quot; Mel waved her friend goodbye and walked out the library.<br />
<br />
Sheila went back to finding out more information of this centaur society. Just like before she found absolutely nothing else on any changes from their own world. Every single event that happened in her world happened exactly the same in this world. Not a single new accomplishment and not a single line out of place. The only thing that changed was the people. She looked at art and depending if the their horse part was in frame at all no new changes.<br />
<br />
One thing she seemed curious about was how could centaurs exist in this world and not in theirs? She first looked up centaur to check if this was what they were called and pretty much yep. The image results showed some anatomy pictures of the centaur body which was fascinating on some fronts, but she continued onto her research. She continued to look up other mythical beings and all of them came up as mythical. That was until she looked at unicorns which was slightly different from what she expected. The first picture depicted a unicorn all dressed up in clothes much like how Sheila was dressed right now. Not surprising though was that the description called it mythical as well. She then looked up human which shocked her out more. The images that were on the direct result box was not what she called humans at all. In fact all they were was horses. She double checked that what she typed was correct and even typed human in again and came up the same. She went to Wikipedia where it pretty much gave the same description of if she typed up horse. Though one of the links from the directory box had a link that said: Evolutionary Theory<br />
<br />
Sheila took a hard breath and clicked it. It took her to a part of the page that read the line from above. It told that though most evolutionary evidence has shown a structure between most animals on Earth can be connected back to an origin. Though the case of centaurs it&#39;s mostly theory that horses and humans must&#39;ve developed in some similar fashion. The theory is that horses (which depicted a naked human) and humans (depicted a regular horse) lived in exactly the same habitat and conditions to evolve similarly to each other. While horses could have come from apes, horses must&#39;ve survived next to us.<br />
<br />
She then looked up horses that turned up with naked people. What was interesting is that while all of them were naked. Though the word that tore her up came up which was &#39;myth&#39;. She found this equation to seem pretty simple. While centaurs never existed in her world, humans switched rolls with centaurs in this one. Most of these new discoveries didn&#39;t make any sense to Sheila. Like they were descended from horses. One weird factor was that when she typed in Adam and Eve. Eve was a human, and Adam was a horse. Which I guess in this world the creationist vs evolutionist she could see would argue about the same things. But why were the horses and humans switched by classification.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey bought you something.&quot; Melissa said from behind Sheila who jumped from her chair that was made just for her horse butt.<br />
<br />
&quot;You startled me!&quot; Sheila exclaimed to which Melissa giggled with delight.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, I didn&#39;t know you were so absorbed with that computer. I was thinking why you would rather search up things on a library computer than on your phone.&quot; Melissa pulled out her phone which was inside on of her horse jean pockets. <br />
<br />
&quot;I dunno why, libraries just help me relax.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s weird because you&#39;re the only person I know would actually do that instead of the more simple way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess I&#39;m different from most people especially now&quot; she looked down at herself reflecting on how oddly comfortable this body was, but how it looked so foreign. &quot;Anyway what did you get me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I just went to McDonald&#39;s and it turns out I found somethings out myself. Centaurs are completely vegetarian. I got you a hamburger, but instead of meat it&#39;s straw cooked in grease.&quot; She handed Sheila a wrapped burger with the M mark of McDonald&#39;s.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh, I&#39;ll try it.&quot; She said. She didn&#39;t feel up to for a burger in the first place, but this was a new venture for both of them, she felt the need to try it out. Unwrapping it she saw the typical condiments you would find even cheese, so she assumed they weren&#39;t vegan. The straw was all packed into a patty like a regular hamburger would be. She took a small bite not wanting to take in a chunk that she might hate herself for later when she spit it out. She first felt the taste was very much like a hamburger until she really got a taste of the straw. She sort of knew how it tasted from her life before, and it had pretty much the same taste. She knew she couldn&#39;t swallow it so she flicked the half chewed straw burger onto the wrapper of the burger from her mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow you really didn&#39;t like it? I know it&#39;s not the same we get from home, but I guess I liked it a bit. Could I finish yours?&quot; Melissa begged which Sheila complied and handed her the burger back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ech I couldn&#39;t even swallow it. It&#39;s inedible to me.&quot; Sheila rubbed her tongue on her shirt to get the taste of straw out of her mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Weird, I actually like it for some reason. So, did you find out any more stuff from here?&quot; She said chewing with some straw burger in her mouth which Sheila had some disgust.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I found out that humans don&#39;t exist here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait they don&#39;t? Like at all?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it seems like we&#39;ve swapped rolls in existing here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, so like if I wished right now to turn myself human, I would be treated more like a centaur if one came to our world?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess so.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah, that sounds weird.&quot; Melissa chewed. They were interrupted by a middle aged woman trotting towards them with a stern growl to her voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;The library is not a place to eat and lounge around. It&#39;s not a hangout spot for people like you&quot; She frowned at the two.<br />
<br />
&quot;No I was just on the computer when my-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re sorry ma&#39;am we were just leaving. We don&#39;t like this place anyway.&quot; Melissa replied back. The librarian centaur that was spotted white and light brown gave a harrumph and watched as both of them walked out the centaur sized front doors. Sheila gave her friend a look of anger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry I just wanted to get out without to much of a fuss. That librarian is always on teenagers like us I don&#39;t think arguing would do us any good.&quot; Sheila&#39;s contentment faded and gave a long sigh. &quot;Oh, were you not done researching?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I feel kind of tired of this place. It&#39;s just getting more and more bizarre by the more I find out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wanna fill me in?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
As they walked back to Mel&#39;s house Sheila filled her in about all of her findings and how the names of horses and humans were switched.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, I kind of want to see a unicorn in a business suit. That sounds adorable! What else did you find about them?&quot; Melissa exclaimed. <br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t really look into that, that&#39;s just what I saw. What about the other stuff I told you?&quot; Sheila questioned her friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;That other part is weird as well. Like I&#39;m really a horse to these centaur people?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s weird isn&#39;t it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. I mean I kind of asked to be a horse in the first place. Then we got turned into centaur people. It&#39;s like the best of both world. Being a horse and a human at the same time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re taking this more better than I am. I kind of want to go back to normal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I guess you&#39;re right.&quot; Melissa sighed. &quot;Perhaps we could come visit this place again sometime?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but if we&#39;re able to get back to our reality.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you saying if for? It can&#39;t be that different than-&quot; Melissa fell silent for a few seconds before yelling &quot;HOLY SHIT!&quot; <br />
<br />
Sheila tried to understand why she yelled like that when she noticed she was dead locked on looking at something. She turned her bulky body to face what her friend could see. Which she wasn&#39;t sure she quite got what she was looking at. &quot;What is it, Mel? Why did you scream?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t you see.&quot; She pointed toward a field. &quot;They do have humans here. They&#39;ve got them put in pens.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now Sheila was completely confused. All she could see was horses running in the field. Without warning Melissa pushed her hooves forward and started to sprint toward the field of horses. Sheila still couldn&#39;t see any humans and it was day. Than began to think that since this world still had horses and what she was told from many sources that they don&#39;t exist here that she must be talking about the horses. Then it came to her that this was sort of the world that her friend created. Her stomach or stomach began to harden as she began to perhaps realize how messed up this situation was.<br />
<br />
She dashed toward her friend, clopping her hooves on the road which her rubber shoes seemed to muffle the sound a bit more than without them. She eventually caught up to Melissa who was petting one of the horse&#39;s muzzle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm Mel, I&#39;ve been wondering why some things don&#39;t make sense in this world. I want to ask you a few questions? These may sound simple questions that you and me probably know the answer to. These may also sound pretty silly on how easy these are but I&#39;ll ask them anyway. Are you okay with that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re just regular animals here.&quot; Melissa seemed to not respond to Sheila&#39;s questions.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you listening Mel?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I heard you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright bear with me here, these are stupid questions, but please answer them anyway.&quot; Sheila nodded solemnly still petting the horse. &quot;Mel, what is that you&#39;re petting?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mel looked back at Sheila with a stupefied look. &quot;This is a dumb question, but if you want me to answer, it&#39;s a human.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, now what were we before we became centaurs?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we were human&#39;s of course.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What did horses look like?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on Sheila what&#39;s going on?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please answer the question.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They had no fur, pink skin except a few places. They had things called hands and feet except for hooves&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, now what did horses do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well they were pets.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For whom?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Humans?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because, even though we&#39;re not able to do a lot of stuff with hooves, horses can act out our needs. They can&#39;t do anything except obey. Their only thoughts is to obey us. They don&#39;t speak or say anything they just do whatever we want them to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
This was not what Sheila wanted to hear. It seemed that her friend somehow made her think that this world she that was real even though it wasn&#39;t real. Or perhaps the life Sheila knew was the lie. Could a spell really change one&#39;s perspective. Why did it change her friend&#39;s perception and not hers. How could she believe such a place existed, then maybe she could say the same to herself. Both totally convinced that their version of reality was real, even if Melissa didn&#39;t know Sheila&#39;s version yet. This was her world she accidentally created after all. It seemed to make more sense that Melissa had the real reality and Sheila&#39;s was fake. She wanted to tell Mel her side of the situation and hopefully they would come to a conclusion, or may not. The only thing Sheila wanted was to get back to her right reality.</p>
