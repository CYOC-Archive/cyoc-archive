<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">( variation of Robin Hood )<br />
<br />
     Now King John wasn't too thrilled to have the Dragon caught,namely because while Danny<br />
of the Sigil would have been happy to rob from the rich to give to the poor,King John,years<br />
earlier,had hatched a plot that was yielding handsome dividends these days.<br />
<br />
       Basically whilst he'd been Prince John and good King Richard had been off fighting the <br />
Crusades,Danny of the Sigil had been a major pain in the behind,and he and his Merry Men had often<br />
waylaid Prince John's plots.<br />
<br />
   The last one had seen Prince John hire a bunch of moors to waylay the Army Payroll<br />
Wagon,blame the theft on Danny and the Merry Men and send the stolen Payroll to Prince John.<br />
<br />
Alas the moors had proven to be Danny and his Merry Men in disguise,so after he'd paid <br />
in in gold coins,greedy Prince John had opened the Payroll Chest,to find it full of worthless<br />
rocks.Meanwhile the despairing ( and grumbling ) Army General Arthurius had been awakened from a <br />
sleepless night when a &quot; swisssh THUNK&quot; of a Merry Men arrow plunked into a tent post <br />
two feet away from his head.There was a note attached,telling him to look under Sherwood Bridge<br />
for something to please him.<br />
<br />
     And so General Arthurious owed his neck to Danny of the Sigil.<br />
<br />
     However he also owed allegiance to the King,and kind hearted Richard never could<br />
see anything wrong in Prince John.<br />
<br />
    Fuming Prince John schemed and plotted revenge in his sleep,and became aware of the <br />
Dragons Eye,reputedly the eye from the slain Dragon Fafnir,which was supposed to bring out the <br />
good or evil in a human,in the form of a dragon.<br />
<br />
     So Prince John sent out his spy Sir Guy,who learned from someone<br />
that Danny Sigil hadn't been always goody two shoes.<br />
<br />
     Whilst a boy,he'd had a dislike for his stepbrother,resulting in a <br />
accidental fall of young Clarence off Sherwood Bridge,and his death.<br />
<br />
    So it was that soon Prince John had the Dragons Eye safely encased in a wooden chest <br />
that looked like a Army Payroll chest,and a latenight dig by Sir Guy soon had Clarence Sigil's<br />
grinning dirtstained skull sitting in the chest beside the Dragons Eye.<br />
<br />
       Prince John himself placed the fake Army Payroll in a enclosed alcove-pillared<br />
area under Sherwood Bridge,and had it set up that when Danny snuck in and openned the lid,<br />
a hidden iron gate hanging above would swing down,trapping Danny within the enclosed space.<br />
<br />
   Word was let out to Danny that a item of great value lay hidden under Sherwood Bridge,and<br />
only General Arthurious and Prince John were present on top of the bridge,a coil of climbing rope<br />
already fastened to the railing.<br />
<br />
   So they watched Danny of the Sigil sneak in from the wood,the furtive steps as the thief<br />
entered the alcove,then the scratching as his dagger popped open the padlock,then the creak as the lid <br />
swung up,and Danny's shout of shock and pain as it revealled his stepbrothers skull,the Dragons Eye<br />
glowering at him from a bulging ridgy eye socket.<br />
<br />
    Then there was the &quot;clack&quot; of the trip lever being thrown and the &quot;Baang&quot; as the iron<br />
trapdoor locked Danny in.<br />
<br />
      Now the two witness's had expected Danny to shout for help,and perhaps a mist nearby to form into <br />
a evil dragon,or at best Prince John thought the dragon spirit would materialize in the same cage as <br />
Danny,and gobble up its human alter ego.<br />
<br />
   Instead what he heard was Danny's panting grunts,a sound of tearing cloth,but no beastial roars <br />
of a dragon.<br />
<br />
     Curious,he and the General slid down the rope and stood outside the iron gate,and stared at<br />
a Danny growing in size,becoming more muscular,his clothing splitting and tearing<br />
around his enlarging frame.<br />
<br />
     The wave of growth stopped,and Prince John thought for a second Danny was turning<br />
into a small giant.<br />
<br />
     Then the grunts of pain began again and Danny hunched over in the<br />
increasingly smaller prison.<br />
<br />
    Prince John was staring at one of Danny's meaty blunt fingers resting on the ground<br />
when the finger cracked and lengthened ,its bloody fingernail pushed away as a blood red dragons<br />
talon pushed its way out of the changing digit.<br />
<br />
     Prince John then had his &lt;Eureka &gt; moment,as he realized that Danny was turning<br />
into the Dragon,.<br />
<br />
    He watched fascinated as the giant hand's thumb suddenly cracked and swivelled<br />
behind the hand,sprouting a talon as it did so.As the fascinated prince watched.the remaining <br />
unchanged 2 fingers began to fuse into one grarled lengthening digit,and <br />
soon<br />
what once looked like a giant human hand looked more like a dragons taloned<br />
forepaw.<br />
<br />
      Danny by this point knew what was happening to him,but was not going to give Prince John<br />
the satisfaction of watching him beg for mercy.<br />
<br />
    The thief had felt his insides changing,and could feel the pressure under his human face of new muscles<br />
skin,scales and teeth.<br />
<br />
    So in defiance he seized his face with those powerful arms and forepaws of his and tore off<br />
the stretching piece of human skin and nose,which revealed the slit eyed green scaled,demon mouthed<br />
sharp toothed flat nosed short snouted dragon forming below.<br />
<br />
    That seemed to set off a reaction in his skull,and he screamed a human<br />
cry of pain as his nose and jaws began to stretch out,and new sharp teeth pushed out of his<br />
gums and separated further from each another as his snout lengthened.<br />
<br />
     The next change wave struck his tailbone and spine,and Dannisigilnation arched his<br />
back as his back lengthened,his neck stretched out and a spiky scaly green tail began to stretch out,thicken <br />
and coil about the prison.<br />
<br />
In all his writhings,Danny ended up on his backside,and screamed in pain as the ground jarred two<br />
emerging bumps wobbling and growing out of his back.<br />
<br />
     A new wave of growth and change and lengthening struck the emerging monster,and <br />
it flopped back on its belly as its ribs began to deepen,the new wings tore free and red<br />
belly scutes raced along its underside.<br />
<br />
   Danny tried to make one last taunt at Prince John,but all that came out of that<br />
lengthening neck was a low growl,which shocked the once human.<br />
<br />
     As the former human felt the pressure on his skull as it flattened out and<br />
sprouted horns,Danny realized in a few moments he would be just another <br />
evil greedy dragon.<br />
<br />
      If he wished to stop the transformation's final outcome,he would need to <br />
slay himself with those bulky powerful dragon limbs.<br />
<br />
     As his mind and brain began to shrink and alter,a stray thought<br />
&quot; stab drive horns heart&quot; briefly flashed in the nearly dragons brain.<br />
<br />
However his two foot long human &lt; hairless ant ape &gt; sword lay nearbt and Dannisigilnation <br />
seized the object,placed it over his still altering scaled chest and with a mighty roar,began pushing it in <br />
towards its dragon heart.<br />
<br />
     Alas,at that moment the Dragon began its final changes and growth spurt,and the <br />
iron gate and stone pillars began to creak and bulge as the mighty Dannisigilnatious grew in size and might fearsomeness.<br />
<br />
   As the sword plunged toward the growing beating heart,the chest grew outwards,the rib cage deepened<br />
and what would have been a deadly 2 foot long sword in a 3 foot deep ribcage was a tiny painful<br />
pin in the eight foot deep chest that the Dragon now sported.<br />
<br />
    The prison burst apart and Sherwood Bridge collapsed around the enraged dragon,which<br />
roared its rage at the tiny human pinprick that lay embedded in the beast.<br />
<br />
     At this point General Arthurious fled,intent on protecting his daughter <br />
the Princess from this new evil on the land.<br />
<br />
     However Prince John stood his ground,and realized the former Danny of the Sigil's forepaws<br />
were far too huge and clumsy now to remove the annoying sword that lay buried in his <br />
chest.<br />
<br />
     Taking a gamble,he rushed into the rubble,ducked in whilst a long taloned digit twitched<br />
ineffectively around the pesky object,grasped the sword<br />
handle and pulled out the sword.<br />
<br />
    There was a brief shower of black hissing dragons blood that bubbled on the fallen<br />
limestone pillars.However the wound quickly sealed over and Prince John watched<br />
fascinated as red scutes flowed over the wound and healed it.<br />
<br />
   So the Prince hadn't noticed the giant reptillian dragons head quietly<br />
snaking over as the Dragon looked with smouldering eyes at the hair ape ant thing that<br />
had done him a favour.<br />
<br />
     Of his past as Danny of the Sigil the Dragon had no recollection.He did however<br />
sense a greedy evil kindred spirit in this hairless ape ant.<br />
<br />
       And so the Dragon and Prince John got to become partners in evil.And Prince<br />
John became King John,who now had two pesky outsider dragons interfering in his plans...</p>
