<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As I went upstairs to get dressed and perhaps be away from prying eyes, I wished to be cleaned as the faint smell of sex still lingered on my skin and probably was not the best way to persuade my Girlfriend to join my pack. Getting dressed my clothes seemed to fit better, mom usually bought clothes on the bigger side so they’ll last and honestly the layers helped to hide my body, not saying my body was bad it was just skinny for someone my age…well, it was. As I got dressed I noticed my arms and legs had gained some toned muscle and my chest was a little wider and more defined, I was already an impressive 6’2 but now with my muscles I looked athletic, thinking back to pre-werewolf mom she was a pretty woman for her age but still age and stress affects everyone, seeing her recently her body like most of the women downstairs looked that of an athlete in their mid to late twenties, strong muscles, smooth skin, ample bosom to butt ratio, thinking about them got me a little hard, as I saw my eyes yellow and nails begin to change, biting my lip I was able to control it and eventually stop it. <br />
<br />
“Honey, Clarrisa will be here in about twenty minutes” mom called up<br />
<br />
“Ok, I’m just leaving” I call back down as I rush down the stairs and out the door, Sara’s was just down the road and walking rather than wishing was probably best as it gave me time to think of what I want to say.<br />
<br />
Ten minutes later, I was outside her house, her parents were not home, but a bike was parked on the drive that I recognise, forgetting today she had her tutoring session she ran for extra credits. As I made my way down her drive, the wind changed I smelt something like sweat but dirtier, not totally unpleasant but strange. Knocking on the door it squeaked open <br />
<br />
“Hello?” I said confused as the smell intensified, looking round I saw the mass of textbooks laid out in her sitting room but so was a bra and pair of panties.<br />
<br />
I could feel my heartbeat faster as the adrenaline pumping around my body, no this couldn’t be, Sara and I were happy maybe they were her sisters or laundry that got misplaced. My hope died when I heard it <br />
<br />
“OHYEAHBABY” Sara moaned from upstairs, I let out a bestial growl as I slowly made my way upstairs and there, she was half-naked riding my friend Andy. Up and down she bounced as Andy grabbed her hips tight helping her thrust down on his cock.<br />
<br />
Anger clouded my vision I saw red wanted to kill instead I said “Stop” accidentally wishing time to stop around me. It took me a second to realise what was going on. I looked at them as though they were a horny piece of art <br />
“How could you do this?” I question my frozen girlf…ex. I breathed out slowly, I will not think rash or lash out, like some of my pack’s exes, sitting on the edge of the bed I grabbed her phone and looked through it that when I found the texts, innuendo, sexting, videos at least three solid months of an affair.<br />
<br />
I felt the tears running down my cheek, we had been dating two years but now that was all done for. Throwing my head back and roaring in anger I stand up and decide that Sara wasn’t good enough to be part of my pack. Pulling my phone out I stood back so I was at the door frame and took multiple photos of those two, before finding Sara’s phone and screenshotting all the text and sending all of them in an email to me before deleting the email from her sent folder.  I said I would not lash out; I didn’t say anything about getting even. <br />
<br />
The next ten minutes were weird as I walked home, the world around me was still frozen, birds mid-flight, traffic froze nothing new to be honest, an eeriness to it all as I walked home eyes red from crying I walk into a frozen discussion about something, I go up to my room and for the next hour or so I find all of Sara’s clothes or Knick-knacks she left round mine a few gifts or even photos and began boxing them up in different boxes.<br />
<br />
The next hour locked in my room felt weird as I placed all her stuff in a box and taped it up. Wishing I was at her door I placed the box of her belongings on her porch and sent the text<br />
<br />
‘I’m breaking up with you. We are done’<br />
<br />
The front door was left open because the world was frozen, no one would steal anything right? Wishing the world unfrozen I grab the door handle and slammed it shut as hard as I could, not realising my werewolf strength as I nearly tore the door of its hinges as I walked away I could hear her scream, I didn’t need to be a werewolf or have a magic ring to know how loud Sara can be, walking home it felt later than it was closer to 5 pm than in reality the 2 pm it was, was this part of the wish did I get over a devastating emotional breakup, in like a fraction of the time. My phone was buzzing with texts<br />
‘nice joke, baby’<br />
“Joe what’s going on’<br />
‘why?’<br />
‘talk to me’ the messages buzzed one after another I simply smiled and sent one of the photos of her and Andy, with a text saying <br />
‘your stuff is on the porch’.<br />
<br />
Putting the phone in my pocket I could feel it buzz and vibrate as I knew she was trying to call me to apologise or even blame me. One thing I learnt from my mother and her women’s club is to always take the moral high ground…ok, I have a magic ring which messes with reality as I see fit but to everyone else, I took the moral high ground. It. does make you think was this happening even before the ring. Closing the door behind me, Mom rounded the corner and saw my face<br />
<br />
“Joe what’s wrong you’ve barley been gone,” she says walking over <br />
<br />
Playing down the situation “I broke up with Sara”<br />
<br />
“Oh honey, I’m sorry did you show her or” my mom began to ask, the others quieting down to listen in<br />
<br />
“no, no, no I didn’t even tell her…I found her sleeping with someone” I say embarrassed<br />
<br />
“where is the hussy, I’ll rip her heart out” Mrs. Gabrielli commented standing up <br />
<br />
“it’s ok Mrs. Gabrielli, really? I sorted it” I say a little more confident <br />
<br />
Mom looked at me and then down to my ring, you could see her do the math and mouth to me what I did, to which I just smiled.<br />
“well, I’m sorry to hear what happened Joe, I can ask Clarrisa to cancel and we can rearrange for another time perhaps,” Karen said <br />
<br />
“oh no it&#39;s fine really, please let Clarrisa come it would be great to see her,” I say with a smile.</p>
