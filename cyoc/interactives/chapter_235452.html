<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>The content alert is more for the mention of things, not that they&#39;re actually revealed in the chapter.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You were still a bit lost as you stood there with your thoughts and looking between your father and stepmother on one side and then your stepmother&#39;s daughter on the other. There were so many things that were strange and different and couldn&#39;t be denied. You had known about your father, Angelo Marconi, dating Christian Monique for about a year on Earth. It hadn&#39;t been as long as when your father dated your biological mother, but it had been for a time. There had been some minor things that might seem odd on the outside, but Christian had never done anything cruel, and you had approved of her and your father marrying, after all, she had made your father happy. Though... the marriage was more recent.<br />
<br />
The big thing was that Christian Monique was really Queen Chrysanthemum of the Fairy Queendom of Moniqueer. Her courtship of your father was genuine as she missed the sort of romantic companionship after her partner queen had died as a result of the mining done by dwarves elsewhere in the magical/mythical world where you figured you presently were, judging by the large &quot;gossamer flower&quot; that was not too far from where Christian was standing. Some of that was understandable, as you knew your father had also mourned your biological mother&#39;s death, but much of it was still surprising that things like magic and fairies were all just stories to you, before this night, anyway. There was also the surprise that Christian wanted you to become a fairy as well, likely as a possible match for her daughter, Princess Wellowyn, who had arrived just after you&#39;d found out on who and what Christian really was.<br />
<br />
And a part of you was attracted to Wellowyn. She was about your age, either seventeen or eighteen, maybe even nineteen depending on how fairies aged, though given what you had been told, it could be possible that Christian and Wellowyn were well older than they appeared. That was, however, something to be figured out later, you did know and see that Wellowyn was attractive and was almost as curvy as her mother. The garments that were pretty much see-through on her also didn&#39;t do much to hide the size of her bust and the clips that were there to cover her nipples and the underwear that covered everything else. Like any teenage male, it was something that would be arousing but given that this was your stepsister and that your stepmother was also present, you wanted to be respectful to her. It wasn&#39;t just that she was a princess, it was about the things your father had taught you growing up on how to be a good person. And some of her attraction to you also seemed genuine, which left you open to the idea of dating and getting to know her better and thinking things over before taking that next step.<br />
<br />
For Christian had also mentioned on what that next step was. Something that was a requirement with regard to moving into the Fae realm that she ruled over. To become a fairy through the gossamer flower. It was large, almost as big as you were and from the way Christian had first motioned to it, it did seem like she was leaning in that direction. That you would be placed inside the flower and would become a fairy. That would in turn create its own consequences, given that Christian had said that ALL fairies were female, or at least female so far as humans defined gender. Their natural reproduction was more flower like, which was partially why Christian had always &quot;smelled of nature&quot; when you&#39;d met her on Earth before she and your father married. All of that was a major step and would represent major change, as you were most decidedly male and not transgender. <br />
<br />
But there was the other fact that your lifespan was shorter than what Wellowyn&#39;s would be, and Wellowyn had said she&#39;d be heartbroken if you died. While you really didn&#39;t know her, the part of you that was interested in her, or at least curious, saw that she was cute and honest. You also really didn&#39;t want to see her cry or be sad and that only added a bigger conundrum for you on things going forward. Make a decision that would change your gender, in addition to species, and make a cute girl happy or not and, and know that she would potentially be very sad in the future due to things that would be beyond Wellowyn&#39;s control and technically would be within your realm of control. It was likely a similar decision your father had had to make and one where you knew his decision, judging by the fact that your father had likely been placed in a gossamer flower a couple of years ago, becoming a Fairy Queen, like Christian... Queen Hydrangea of Moniqueer, or &quot;Angie&quot; as she seemed to prefer in her new female form.<br />
<br />
Your father&#39;s changes left you with a lot of questions on that, as it was likely that he, now she, had been moving between Earth and the mythical/magical world for the past two years, likely with Christian. Some of the reasoning likely related to you, as the move to this house near the edge of the woods wasn&#39;t something that happened until after the wedding. Thus, while your father had really been Angie for about two years, because you hadn&#39;t moved to this house, yet Angie was likely also having to wrestle with his job, work, being your father, and other things in the human world while likely also learning magic in the fay realm that Christian ruled. You also guessed that Angie had also learned of Wellowyn there, though, you didn&#39;t meet her until recently and for the moment, the conversation between you and her with both your respective parents on your future was overriding your other questions.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well, Mother. I will do as you say. But what am I to do, in the meantime? I expected to return to Moniqueer with my new love by tomorrow. Am I to go back and forth while we do this dating thing?&quot; Wellowyn asked to her mother.<br />
<br />
Your &quot;father&quot; and Wellowyn&#39;s mother looked to each other for a moment, and you noted Angie&#39;s wings beat a bit nervously behind her. It was ultimately Angie who actually answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;That may be up to the two of you to settle on,&quot; Angie spoke, &quot;since I&#39;ve postponed some things for today...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Postponed some things?&quot; you asked, curious on the line.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Angie answered, &quot;for you see... the magical world and the human world are still separate and Christian can&#39;t remain absent from her Queendom for too terribly long. She&#39;s had the freedom and power to go between the two realms to check on Wellowyn and making sure that she&#39;s following the regency council while Christian was courting me on Earth. But at some point, especially after I became Angie... or Queen Hydrangea, if we&#39;re to be formal... I would at least have to move to the magical world full time. I&#39;d need to learn how to be a queen and look after the people of Moniqueer... and I&#39;m sure Christian will be a wonderful teacher, but it also means that I CAN&#39;T stay on Earth. I HAVE to go to Moniqueer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s part of the rules that were set up as the magical realm was set up,&quot; Christian added, reminding you of the long history that she&#39;d mentioned earlier, &quot;at times in the past, these portals were set at random and people brought into the magical world didn&#39;t have much of a choice. But over time... there came some recognition that was wrong and making us into the very &quot;monsters&quot; that persecuted the magical races. Thus, why the... recruitment, as you put it, has been revised to romantic courtship. We go to the human realm and find one that would be for us... and earn their love. Which is what I found in Angelo Marconi. I didn&#39;t know about you when we first met... but when we met... I just had this feeling that you would be perfect to Wellowyn, but she wasn&#39;t eighteen at that time, and our rules forbade me from taking her to the human realm.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thus, why I had to stay here and act as regent while my seed mother was courting your now nectar mother,&quot; Wellowyn added, reminding you on the &quot;sex-ed&quot; basics that Christian had explained a few moments before, &quot;and in meeting you... I must agree with my mother&#39;s judgement. You have a strong spirit and many of the qualities anyone would love. We would be a wonderful couple and hopefully have many daughters in the future. Which would require you to become a fairy and move to Moniqueer... and we&#39;d be together for a LONG time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But what about friends and family?&quot; you asked, &quot;some of this sounds like we&#39;d just be running away... dad... I mean... mom... I&#39;m never going to get used to that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You will,&quot; Christian spoke, &quot;your father is not the first man to have become a fairy. The first in my Queendom to become a partner queen, maybe, but not the first to become a fairy. All get used to that in time...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It took me about a month to fully adjust to things and accept them,&quot; Angie nodded and took Christian&#39;s hand, &quot;the biggest thing for me NOW is actually remembering that as far as humans are concerned, I&#39;m male. It was quite an adjustment... but I loved Christian more than anything else. Particularly how good she made me feel after your mother died. She&#39;s warmed my heart tremendously. Becoming female... becoming a fairy... that became trivial compared to the romantic love Christian offered.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is good to see you happy again,&quot; you said to her with a small smile, &quot;but... still... what about friends and family? I mean, I have friends back home. I still have high school to finish and it&#39;s my senior year. You have friends at work as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
Angie bit her lip, &quot;I do. And a part of me will miss them, but it&#39;s also something that can&#39;t truly be avoided. Vinnie... I&#39;ve been Angie for long enough now that I no longer see myself as male. And there have been a few times where I&#39;ve had to reedit forms because I&#39;ve been marking my gender as female. My friends at work may not have noticed, or if they did, I could just write it off as being head over heals in love with Christian or dealing with something else. Which means that a lot of things on Earth are no longer as they were for me before I became what I am now. So... were we to stay in the human realm, you would never meet Wellowyn and I&#39;d be having to lie to friends all the time... and potentially even lie to you if there was a fear that you&#39;d attack me for being a fairy. And I can&#39;t do that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And this is something that relates to a lot of the rules that come with crossing the boundary between realms,&quot; Christian added, &quot;your father... your nectar mother... loves you very much and didn&#39;t want to abandon you. It is... in part why we&#39;ve waited this long to bring you here at the portal boundaries between the two realms. To give you the chance to grow and for both of us to be certain that you wouldn&#39;t be an enemy... By rule, once Angelo became Angie, as your parents, we could have brought you here sooner and changed you by force as within our rights as parents, and there are some magical beings that DO take that choice in these cases. It&#39;s a technicality, but an immoral rule in my opinion. Which has meant taking time... but once that time and acceptance comes, the rules do stand firm. The other fairy queens don&#39;t want knowledge of our realm to leak out and for any old descendants of the hunters who fought our ancestors long ago to come into the magical realm.&quot;<br />
<br />
You only looked down with a heavy frown. You rubbed the tip of your shoe against the grass beneath you. It created a bit of a rustling noise as there was also some old leaves and things in the grass as well, but the sound wasn&#39;t the important part. The important part was likely more that you were telegraphing your own worries for all to see. Worries that went beyond the questions that related to your father&#39;s transition from Angelo to Angie, or the questions you wanted to ask to get to know Wellowyn more.<br />
<br />
&quot;And this transition wouldn&#39;t be a complete abandonment of old friends and compatriots,&quot; Christian offered, &quot;for once you become a fairy and Wellowyn&#39;s wife, and she yours, some basic communication wouldn&#39;t be impossible. The portals we use can allow for mail to go through. If you write letters, you would be able to correspond with those you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I will try to be doing some of that,&quot; Angie added, &quot;I&#39;ll have to be vague on the details and so on, but the only part that would be a lie would be the name I put on the envelope and on the letter. But Christian and I have tested the system... We can&#39;t abuse the portals for constant visits, but the sending of mail wouldn&#39;t tax the portals. We could drop them through postage box in the area here, and it would go to a post office in our hometown.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Great... so we go back a century in terms of communication,&quot; you grumbled.<br />
<br />
Angie frowned but then continued, &quot;but that&#39;s not the entirety of the present situation. And that is where the present situation for you and Wellowyn to date can be up to the two of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is?&quot; you looked up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wellowyn turned eighteen a month ago,&quot; Christian explained, &quot;and your eighteenth birthday is in a couple of weeks. By rule... Wellowyn, while she wasn&#39;t old enough to go with me to the human realm when I courted your father... she IS old enough now to go with you and court you, if that were to be a choice to make.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And a lot of the work in the human realm that I&#39;ve had right now is more setting up that transition,&quot; Angie spoke, &quot;the retirements and statement on going off on a grand adventure and so on. In pure theory it would also include you to transfer you from your high school to the equivalent in Moniqueer. But I&#39;ve had the sense that you&#39;ve been worried on things... particularly when Christian and I have made our trips from the house here to Moniqueer... mostly as part of my opening lessons on being a Fairy Queen, now...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And with that, I felt you ready and mature enough to learn the truth... of my lineage and your father&#39;s ascension,&quot; Christian added, &quot;and offering you the choice to join us. The ideal hope would be that you would jump at the chance. But... I suppose that was some arrogance on my part, and I apologize for rushing you.&quot;<br />
<br />
This only added questions in your mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;But aren&#39;t we on Earth or...&quot; you began.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re actually in the magical realm,&quot; Christian answered, &quot;it&#39;s at a spot where the barrier between the two dimensions is at its weakest and thus allows for the crossing, and thus where stable portals can open. Any magical being can open them with ease to travel between the realms... though, moving people or crossing frequently can be taxing. Which is in part why the rule is set that once you transition and become a fairy to be with Wellowyn... or remain human and stay with Wellowyn that you wouldn&#39;t be able to go back to the human realm on Earth. And which sets up the correspondence and other actions that your nectar mother has had to work on, along with her other work responsibilities that... I also thought were important.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And because you were nervous... that was where I got the sense that the time might be right, and with the paperwork for the transition from the human realm to the magical realm... I put that off for today so that I could be here and be here for you,&quot; Angie then picked up, &quot;and that gives you and Wellowyn a choice. You could agree to finish high school in Moniqueer...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And we wouldn&#39;t have to disguise you,&quot; Christian spoke, &quot;as Queen Hydrangea would be able to introduce you to the Queendom as her son and consort to my daughter... and potentially as the future Princess Vinea. You would be accepted, even while as a male and as human. For while we may still have fears of old hunters, your father&#39;s marrying me and your present reactions... and confusion... are proof that you are an ally and worthy of being with us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Or you and Wellowyn could return to Earth and our old apartment,&quot; Angie spoke, &quot;the furniture and leases would all be in order... thanks to magic... and by law, you could both be recognized as emancipated adults. You wouldn&#39;t have any trouble living together and would be free to date and learn about each other in the process. It may also give you the chance to accept all the things that will come when it comes time for you to enter the gossamer flower and become a fairy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I would expect that the wedding would still be in Moniqueer?&quot; Wellowyn asked, though looking to you.<br />
<br />
&quot;The formal fey wedding would,&quot; Christian nodded, &quot;though that would be more for me and your step-nectar-mother. The first wedding... the one for Vinnie&#39;s friends and associates on Earth would be done there. It would be more informal, though just as legal and binding...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And with love between you, having it twice wouldn&#39;t be bad,&quot; Angie said to Wellowyn, &quot;just as you were a guest and the formal wedding between Christian and I in Moniqueer.&quot;<br />
<br />
That raised some of your spirits a bit, as it raised the possibility of at least finishing out high school with your friends. A part of you was also thinking being able to introduce Wellowyn to them. Of course, you then remembered the things your father had taught you and you looked to Wellowyn.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... Wellowyn... what would you say on being with me in the human realm for a while,&quot; you asked to her, &quot;we could get to know each other. I could introduce you to my friends. We could go to school... or at least finish out the school year. Having fun in a way that can let us be on our own. Its own sort of adventure. What do you think?&quot;</p>
