<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Fine, I&#39;ll do it, just give it to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Transform or dare?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Both.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;First, for your transformation, all of my body parts that you stole from me will leave your body and reattach to mine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle saw his - Jen&#39;s - tits start to feel heavier. He almost regretted that they would soon be gone, wishing that he would have spent more time feeling her boobs while he had them. He gave them a good squeeze, trying to memorize the sensation on both ends, his hands and his breasts. &quot;Who knows when I&#39;ll have another opportunity like this,&quot; he thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;And for your dare, you&#39;re going to come to my house to personally and honestly apologize to me for what you did and then hand your penis over to me so you will never, ever have it again.&quot;<br />
<br />
His heart froze. One of Jen&#39;s boobs fell off of his chest, plopping to the floor. The other joined it a second later, then he felt Jen&#39;s pussy slide off, down the leg of his pants and on to the floor. Her ass then popped out the waist of his pants to join the others. As soon as they were all together, they levitated and flew right through the glass of his window. Kyle heard Jen shout in pain, &quot;Fuck!&quot; If his brain was capable of focusing, he might have thought there was some justice in that, but all he could think about was the fact that he was going to be dickless for the rest of his life. His body was on autopilot, reaching for his detached dick in his backpack.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck,&quot; Kyle said. He became acutely aware of the texture of his flaccid cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll see you in about 15 minutes? Be careful on your way over here, I want my dick to arrive safe and sound.&quot;<br />
<br />
Before Kyle could respond, he heard the click of Jen hanging up. He never imagined that Jen would be able to out-maneuver him like this, let alone within mere hours of him cursing her. And yet, he really did feel genuinely sorry for what he had done. He couldn&#39;t tell whether it was a result of Jen&#39;s dare making him honestly sorry or not, but it didn&#39;t really matter now. His body was forcing him to walk out the front door. Even when his mom called out to him, he couldn&#39;t stop himself. He couldn&#39;t even think of an excuse to give her anyway. &quot;Sorry, mom, I&#39;ve got to go surrender my penis because of a dare. Too bad you&#39;re never going to get those grandkids you always wanted,&quot; isn&#39;t the type of thing a son normally tells his mother.<br />
<br />
It was an agonizing walk. After a few minutes, he completely gave up on trying to fight it, resigning himself to his fate. He became more and more sure that he deserved whatever punishment Jen wanted to give him, even if it meant he would be a Ken doll in the crotch. He really wanted to tell her how sorry he was for what he put her through and giving up his dick was the least he could do to make it up to her. He had been an absolute jerk and was going to change his ways. Starting today, Kyle Perkins would work to be the best man he could be, even if he didn&#39;t have a manhood.<br />
<br />
Finally, he approached the door to the Smith residence. Without hesitation, he knocked on the door. It didn&#39;t take long for Jen to answer the door. By the way she filled out her clothes, Kyle could tell that her body was back to normal, which gave him a small bit of relief. He presented his penis to Jen like some kind of bizarre bouquet and her smile made him feel so much better, like a weight had been lifted from his shoulders.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jennifer, I want you to know that I&#39;m so sorry. From the bottom of my heart, if I realized the emotional pain I was doing to you, really understood what an asshole I was being, I would have never did what I did to you. It was awful and I&#39;m glad that there was some way for me to make it up to you. If there&#39;s anything else I can do for you, no matter how big or small, just let me know.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen smiled even wider and took Kyle&#39;s dick. &quot;Well, you certainly did something small for me.&quot; She waved the floppy cock around and couldn&#39;t help but laugh. &quot;But I am glad you brought up doing something else for me because I just thought of something.&quot; Jen pulled her pants down, right there at the front door. While she pulled down her thong, she said, &quot;I remembered you said my parts attached to you and it gave me a great idea.&quot; She pressed Kyle&#39;s dick against her crotch, right above her pussy, and within seconds it was like it had always been there. Jen gave it a couple tugs to make sure and then lifted her new balls to make sure her pussy was still there. She did still want to get fucked there, not to mention to ability to have kids. It would be tough to explain to her boyfriend why she suddenly had both, but if he had a problem with it, there were plenty of other guys out there. Maybe even some girls.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, cowboy. Drop your trousers, I&#39;m about to give this bad boy a test drive.&quot;</p>
