<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The research boat that Horizon ran out of Mieni slowly made its way into the areas around the atoll and the piers that had been set up for the cruise industry to visit the atoll. However, with it being late October, a lot of the summer tourism from the northern hemisphere was largely done and the number that come from the southern hemisphere seemed rarer. It left Mieni with a lower population than most of the other Animalian colonies and had also allowed for efforts on the part of Horizon to continue its look into both the study of how Animalia Virus would effect ocean life and gain more information on the study of the ocean floor. Uplifting Ghost was one of the latest of these actions, and it left the newly uplifted hermaphrodite Animalian looking out over the bow as the ship came in.<br />
<br />
&quot;You were right about there not being a lot of activity,&quot; Ghost commented as she watched the ship come in and all that she could see near the pier that the research ship, with the minisub held up on a crane at the ship&#39;s stern, was approaching there was only a limited welcoming committee.  <br />
<br />
It looked like two adult female Animalians that looked reasonably similar, with one sharing the black and silver bands that Harold had and the other was also banded but more in a different set of colors, more brown and black than anything else. Between them were a few young Animalians that were Sea Krait Animalians, though they seemed to stay the closest to the silver and white banded female, which left Ghost to figure that they were the children of that specific Animalian and might even be related to Harold as well. But beyond that welcoming committee, there really wasn&#39;t anyone there or there being other ships present. This was something that really puzzled Ghost a little, as Allura had said that Mieni had a reputation for getting a lot of visitors.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;ve been told a lot that the tourist season dies down after August,&quot; Allura answered, &quot;which means smaller holiday parties on the atoll, but there are some that are here... though I doubt the tourists are following the Horizon&#39;s research projects.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose that makes sense,&quot; Ghost commented, &quot;though... your mate isn&#39;t here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Our little ones are much younger than Harold and Kirana&#39;s hatchlings,&quot; Allura answered, &quot;so shi&#39;s hopefully looking after them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ghost nodded, &quot;and I may visit?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Allura nodded.<br />
<br />
By this point the ship had come into dock and the ships crew had hopped over to then tie the boat to the pier, while Harold came out on deck. They finished by lifting up a ramp to the ship. It is from there that Harold slithered down the ramp and was quick to hug Kirana and then each of his hatchlings which gave happy cries of &quot;daddy.&quot; Ghost followed Allura down after them. As they got closer, Ghost could overhear some of the conversation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Things in the lab on the island have remained fairly calm,&quot; Kirana reported, &quot;though I suppose the new Animalian will help with all that research?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Harold answered and then held out a hand to gesture to Ghost, Kirana, Teela, children, is is Ghost. She&#39;s a Deep Sea Lizardfish Animalian and one that will help Horizon with both Project Hermaphroditus and the study of the deep sea.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ghost waved for a moment while the group of hatchlings looked up to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your name is Ghost?&quot; one asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Ghost answered, &quot;I was told the name would be fitting given the time of year.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Halloween!&quot; the four Sea Krait Animalians cheered, &quot;we get costumes and the everyone tells stories to be scary. It&#39;s fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ghost looked over to Harold who shrugged and then to the other Animalian that was on the other side of him from Kirana. Ghost figured this other Animalian was Teela.<br />
<br />
&quot;She could pull off the spooky bit,&quot; one of the male hatchlings commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shi,&quot; Ghost corrected, &quot;I am both male and female at the same time. And I do not wish to truly scare anyone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Halloween isn&#39;t so much about truly frightening people,&quot; Kirana commented, &quot;at least not in any way that would be truly serious. And in many ways it can be fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But that&#39;ll still be for a few days to come,&quot; Harold commented, &quot;for the moment... you&#39;ll have some time to adapt and get used to Mieni. Even our testing schedule will be light.&quot;<br />
<br />
Allura smiled and then patted Ghost&#39;s shoulder, &quot;come along, Beacon will love to meet you. We&#39;re sure of that.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Over the next few days Ghost got to see more of Mieni and meet more of the others that were there. She found that there were other Animalians that also came from the ocean&#39;s depths or had some unique adaptations that other animals didn&#39;t have. Meeting Bubblehead was interesting, particularly as the local Halloween party went on there were some of the few Human guests that were present asked some questions while in costume as part of the party. Ghost had some fun with it and did hir best to answer them as best she could. In some ways shi liked the holiday given how people actually were intrigued by her appearance.<br />
<br />
Though one thing that had Ghost the most curious was with a young woman named Circe. She was presently Human from what she could tell, and Ghost had met a few Humans by this time. Though there were a few things about Circe that stuck out. First was that while she seemed very reserved about some things, she was also highly curious. The second thing was that she had a rack that would make some Animalian&#39;s jealous, which she made no effort to hide as part of her costume as a &quot;shark attack victim/zombie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you said you were new to the Atoll?&quot; Ghost asked while glancing over to Bubblehead, who stood by while Circe had asked both of them questions.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah me and my family,&quot; Circe answered, &quot;my mom, Angelyn, brought us all here from Kentucky. The idea was a &quot;bread and breakfast,&quot; but apparently the atoll&#39;s islands aren&#39;t big enough to build such an above ground structure without sacrificing things that are already there. However, we did get one of the smaller islands in the atoll where they&#39;ve had an underground hotel and tour service to a sunken ship. So we&#39;re working there and sprucing it up so that it can provide more a homely feel to it. Complete with very nice staff.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ghost noted as Circe shook her chest from side to side. Shi also noted that Bubblehead&#39;s eyes were also following the two bikini clad orbs.<br />
<br />
&quot;And all Humans are built like that?&quot; Ghost wondered, &quot;all Human women?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Circe gave a laugh, &quot;It&#39;s only Animalians that seem to have a uniform body type of big and muscular for males and curvy for females. Humans can have a pretty wide size range. But Ma always said good living and good genes made for a good body. In that me and my sisters got lucky.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So... what do you think of Mieni?&quot; Ghost wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s fun,&quot; Circe answered, &quot;it may be interesting on where all the Animalian kids will go to school here... or will they sail off to a boarding school on one of the other atolls that makes up the country that Mieni is a part of out here... but a lot of that may be more for the future. Otherwise, it&#39;s still fun. And right now... it&#39;s making for a good Halloween Party!&quot;</p>
