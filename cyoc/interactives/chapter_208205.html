<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;So...what now?&quot; And...no, Annie asked Lauren.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean &#39;now&#39;?&quot; Lauren looked back at her half-naked daughter indignantly. Annie began welling up with tears. &quot;I mean, you&#39;ve ruined my life! I love Jenny, and now she thinks I&#39;m some weirdo lesbian!&quot; She was not a pretty crier--neither was Lauren.<br />
<br />
Lauren&#39;s heart first sank as she wanted to console her daughter. But then she remembered all the running around behind Jenny&#39;s back that Andy thought he had been getting away with. She reaffirmed her resolve. &quot;Oh? Then prove it!&quot;<br />
<br />
Annie sobbed, &quot;WhadoyouMEEN&quot; she was in full-blown hysterics. Jenny must have meant more to him than Lauren thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Calm down, water works won&#39;t work. You might think you&#39;re sneaky, but I know just how many &quot;sidepieces&quot; you think you managed to successfully sneak around with behind poor Jenny&#39;s back.&quot; Annie gasped, and instead of sobbing began stuttering out excuses. &quot;I don&#39;t care! I know, and I&#39;m sticking up for Jenny! She&#39;s such a nice girl and she deserves better than some sleezebag.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, for your punishment, you have to spend a week as a girl. And because you seem to be such a deviant, let&#39;s help you learn to fully &quot;respect&quot; a woman and how special our bodies are. Each day you will wake up to a new &quot;condition&quot; -- including today&#39;s transformation -- and you will have to play the part. If you get overwhelmed and quit out, you have to break up with Jenny.&quot;<br />
<br />
Annie--still somewhat in disbelief--mustered an objection, &quot;But...my reputation and friends!-&quot; Lauren cut her off, &quot;After the end of the week, I will use the Chronivac to set it so that everyone thinks you&#39;ve been out of town for the past week. They&#39;ll also think that your behavior or appearances are normal. And should you ultimately learn your lesson and decide to go steady with Jenny once and for all, I&#39;ll let you do whatever you want. Out in the guest house in the back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Annie clutched her hands in front of her in pseudo prayer. &quot;Yes. Now, go get cleaned up in the shower before you make more of a mess on the carpet.&quot; Lauren gestured to Annie&#39;s still-dripping crotch. Annie turned beet-red and covered herself with her hand. &quot;What about Jenny?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll make sure she&#39;s ok while you&#39;re in the shower and get started cooking a meal.&quot; Lauren left Annie&#39;s room. Jenny--bless her innocent heart--looked lost and still a little scared. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, everything&#39;s fine. Do you want to stay for dinner?&quot; Jenny tried to refuse but Lauren and Jenny had always gotten on well. She truly was hoping her son was worth more than the scum she took him for at the moment. She brought Jenny downstairs and left her in front of the TV while she got started on dinner.<br />
<br />
While Jenny was distracted, she re-opened Annie&#39;s profile from the Chronivac app. Her hair condition was still &quot;Dry&quot; so Lauren knew Annie wasn&#39;t in the shower yet. But she wasn&#39;t any more aroused than she had been previously, so Lauren knew she wasn&#39;t just frigging herself in the bedroom.<br />
<br />
Lauren set some conditional changes. Once Annie crossed the threshold into the bathroom, the following psychological changes will take place. Lauren would be immune to the reality changes.<br />
- She will subconsciously remember female hygiene habits as if they are second-nature. (Awareness: OFF)<br />
- Will not wear underwear (Awareness: OFF, Reality: Adjust to meet Parameters)<br />
- She will begin to think of herself as a female and use female pronouns (Awareness: ON)<br />
- She will feel the urge to jill off when she thinks that nobody will catch her<br />
-- The thrill of almost getting caught will push her over the edge.<br />
- Closeted bisexual<br />
The following physical changes will be made:<br />
- Virginity: OFF<br />
- Annie can no longer get pregnant (that way if anything did happen she wouldn&#39;t have to deal with any weird consequences outside of this week, Lauren breathed a sigh of relief)<br />
- Once she has climaxed by jilling off, her breast cup size will increase by one size. (Awareness: OFF, Reality: Adjust to meet parameters, Exclusion: Current Chronivac User: LAUREN)<br />
<br />
Lauren tried to think of anything else she could do today without just completely destroying her son. She had made a backup of the original profile but she didn&#39;t think her first day of womanhood should be all that traumatic. She hit &quot;Apply&quot; and a minute or two later Annie&#39;s hair changed status to &quot;Damp&quot;. In a few minutes, she&#39;d send Jenny upstairs to check on her friend and let her know dinner was almost ready.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Andy had been contemplating his current predicament. His mom was very creative with her punishments, especially since she got her hands on the Chronivac app. Unfortunately it had a biometric lock and only one license per household, so he&#39;d have to wait until he got his revenge on the old hag.<br />
<br />
Drying the last of the tears from his eyes and a bit of snot dripping down his (now) smooth upper lip, he decided to take stock of everything. His room still looked...mostly the same. Except where he had Bikini posters before were now beach dudes with ridiculously toned abs. He felt a bit of a stir between his legs as he noticed the posters, but quickly turned away. His mom had warned him about making more of a mess of his room. Who knows what other punishments she might come up with if he crossed her twice. He decided to get cleaned up like his mom suggested, took off his socks, and made his way to the bathroom.<br />
<br />
It was just his Mom, Jenny, and Andy. Mom had said she was going to take Jenny downstairs so he didn&#39;t think much about trotting across the hall half-naked. Especially since his Mom had done this to him.<br />
<br />
Andy nudged open the half-closed bathroom door, and walked across the threshold. She felt a shiver run down her spine as her bare foot made contact with the cold floor. Annie felt her nipples stiffen up at the sensation, and decided to draw herself a nice hot shower. She made sure to close the door behind her first, she didn&#39;t want Jenny or Mom to accidentally see her like this...<br />
<br />
While she was waiting for the shower to warm up, she took off her tank-top and examined herself in the mirror. At least if Mom had turned her into a daughter, she gave Annie curves in all the right places. Annie cupped each boob in her hand and weighed them back and forth. Then gave one of her nipples a little pinch which elicited a reflexive moan from Annie. She blushed. She didn&#39;t do that! What if someone heard? She bit her bottom lip, and put her ear to the door. She didn&#39;t hear anyone outside. She went back in front of the mirror and took another look. Although she&#39;d had sex as a guy a few times before; it was always a dark room. She&#39;d never gotten a good look, and the girls had always seemed desperate to shove her dick inside.<br />
<br />
The thought of having a dick seemed a little foreign to Annie, but she still had clear memories of her life as a guy. She dug a little at her snatch, splitting it open to see in the mirror. Her cheeks flushed as began to feel more aroused. In shame, she got into the shower.<br />
<br />
She thought the feeling of water cascading down her skin would calm her down. Instead, it merely found different ways to tickle and excite her new body. She tried with all her might to resist, but she started rubbing her pussy while caressing her left tit with her free hand. As she was about to let out another moan, she dropped her boob and brought her hand to her mouth to stifle it. &#39;What if Jenny is outside?&#39; she thought. Before she could get another stroke in, she heard a quick knock at the door and became paralyzed; like a deer in the headlights. Her heart nearly stopped, then began racing. Her stomach quivered in overtime. She mustered out a weak &quot;Y-yes? What is it?&quot; before she heard Jenny reply &quot;Your Mom says dinner will be ready in about 15 minutes, and don&#39;t dawdle. &quot;Or else&quot; Jenny made a spooky voice and chuckled. It was clear that Lauren had already put her mind at ease. Annie gulped at the &quot;Or else&quot; part--hand still slid between her thighs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, I&#39;ll be out in a few! Thanks!&quot; She mustered, as she counted the minute or two after she heard Jenny&#39;s steps leave the door.<br />
<br />
Instinctually, she laid down in the shower with her back to the wall, and spread her legs as wide as she could and her hands went into overtime. By the time she was done, she was a quivering, steamy, clean mess.<br />
<br />
Still feeling some fluids dripping down from inside, she made sure she was thorough washing herself out. Being careful not to trigger more weird feelings she still didn&#39;t know how to process. Annie toweled off then began preparing to leave the room. She grabbed her tank top from the bathroom counter, then realized she forgot her skirt or any type of pants for that matter. She blushed a bright scarlet again, feeling more stirring between her legs which she quickly shut out of her mind. She opened the door, and quickly peeked her head out. Once she confirmed the coast was clear she snuck out, while stretching her tank-top down in front. She made a mad dash for her room, where she put on a knee-length skirt and the socks she was wearing earlier. Annie felt like something *might* be missing, but she couldn&#39;t quite put her fingers on it.</p>
