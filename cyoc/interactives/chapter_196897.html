<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Darren found himself waking early that Saturday. Between Fukushu&#39;s information, them temporarily living with Yuriko, Yuna and her husband arriving, and reconnecting Yuriko&#39;s family with magic he found sleep to be quite difficult. Showering and dressing, Darren now decided to go for a walk as the clock struck  7 a.m.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow you&#39;re up early.&quot;<br />
<br />
Darren turned, watching Stephanie approach. The gynoid having just finished her recharge session. &quot;Yeah needed to take a walk Steph,&quot; he sighed. &quot;Care to join me?&quot; Steph nodded, reminding Darren to take a jacket as the two exited his home.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you look like you got alot on your mind,&quot; Steph said as they turned a corner. Darren simply chuckled, glancing up at his gynoid companion. &quot;That obvious.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Care to talk about it Darren?&quot;<br />
<br />
Darren sighed, unloading his worries on Steph. From the truce with Fukushu, to the Normals Soul Drive program. Everything the 14 year old had gone through over the past couple of months. Being the Catalyst was a monumental effort and one that made him feel very, very alone. Steph simply nodded, the Soul Drive giving the teen a warm smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you always have your friends like me and Hannah,&quot; she said. &quot;And don&#39;t forget Misaki. I mean she is your girlfriend after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Darren sighed.  &quot;But Misaki has her own problems right now. Losing Ren really messed her up. She&#39;s been spending alot of time with Crystal lately. They&#39;re becoming really good friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh your old crush and new crush are bffs. Who would of thunk it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Darren laughed, playfully pushing Steph as he continued to walk. &quot;I don&#39;t know Steph,&quot; he said softly. &quot;I&#39;ve just been feeling....really old lately.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably doesn&#39;t help that your older than your teachers,&quot; Steph smirked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah thats not helping either,&quot; Darren chuckled. &quot;Ewart is the oldest of the group and he doesn&#39;t turn 14 til next month.&quot;<br />
<br />
Darren paused, taking a deep breath as he gazed off into the horizon. &quot;The Normal are trying to come up with all different ways to kill me,&quot; he said. &quot;They&#39;re even going so far as to make Soul Drives. Soul Drives Steph! Soul Drives loyal to them and them alone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That one unnerved me to,&quot; Steph said softly. &quot;I can&#39;t imagine a Soul Drive being evil.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thats not all though,&quot; Darren added softly. &quot;What if they&#39;re not just make Soul Drives but reprogramming them? What if, what if they turn the Soul Drives against me? What if they turn....you against me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Steph glanced down at Darren, noting the worry on the young teens face. This was something that was tearing at him. He could face down hired soldiers, monsters of legend, even maniacal dictators bent on world conquest but, the idea of Steph turning on him truely frightened him. Steph now squeezed Darren in a tight hug, clinging to him in a sisterly embrace.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thats never gonna happen,&quot; she promised. &quot;No matter what I&#39;ll always love you like a brother.&quot;<br />
<br />
Darren looked at Steph, noting the kind expression on the wolf gynoids face.  He believed her. It didn&#39;t matter what happened, Steph would always be there. &quot;Thanks Steph.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your welcome,&quot; she smiled. &quot;And besides, my lessons with Mr. Akira are really going well. Who knows, at the rate things are going I&#39;ll probably end up the greatest fighter in the world.&quot;<br />
<br />
Darren stifled a chuckle. He had heard how the lessons were going. Steph maybe able to learn how to fight but, she would never be a great fighter. It just wasn&#39;t in her to be violent. To that end Darren decided something. Steph, and the other Soul Drives, needed protection.<br />
<br />
As the duo now entered the park Darren began to survey the area. He had been turning an idea over in his head since Rens funeral, he just needed to find the right subjects. Looking over at a park bench he now thought he found just that.<br />
<br />
Sleeping on the bench, Darren noticed three homeless people huddled together. The two men and one woman had been seen all over town, usually looking for food or work. Dressed in old, moth eaten clothes, they were always seen together holding their signs. The kids at school simply referring to them as &quot;The triplets.&quot;<br />
<br />
The triplets themselves were nothing spectacular. Three average sized, average looking people who appeared to be in their early 50s. Darren could see most of their hair was grey, hiding its previous color. The men all sporting rather tangled beards, while the womans hair hung over her face concealing its weathered visage.<br />
<br />
Darren now reached out with his mind. Yuriko had been trying to teach him psionics yet he had no real aptitude for it. The best he could do was gain a general feeling of what a person was like. The impression he now got from the triplets was tired. They wanted more in life, they wanted fulfillment, they wanted something better. Darren would give them that.<br />
<br />
The triplets now stood, their bodies deathly still as the changes commenced. Darren could see their skin begin to take on a plastic sheen, their bodies becoming larger, bulkier, more masculine in appearance. The two men&#39;s weathered faces smoothed, their beards falling away while their hair turned various shades of blue. <br />
<br />
For the woman the changes were more dramatic. Her breasts lost their sag before melting away into her chest, her face smoothing while her chest broadened becoming more masculine. The womans hair also began to change, shortening as it too turned a radiant shade of blue <br />
<br />
The triplets clothing now vanished, Darren noticing the plastic sheet of their skin as well as an absence of a belly button. Their faces began to morph, their ears becoming artificial as they moved to the top of their heads. Their faces pushing out, becoming canine in proportion. To be exact, looking like that of a German Shephard.<br />
<br />
A final change now took place on the German Shephard gynoids. Darren watched as three police badges began to form on their chests. Badges that were magnetically held in place. As the changes concluded, Darren beheld his work with a smile.<br />
<br />
Police Soul Drives. Appearing to look like anthro German Shephard, the gynoids possessed blue fur of varying shades, positioned on their bodies so that they appeared to be wearing a bike police officers uniform. They were the latest in the Soul Drive line. Units designed to serve and protect the public.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey look,&quot; Steph exclaimed, pointing to the three patrolling Soul Drives. &quot;Its Blue, Bravo, and Charlie. Hey guys!&quot;<br />
<br />
Blue, Bravo, and Charlie turned, excitedly waving at Steph as they now ran towards her. &quot;Hey Steph staying out of trouble?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Was going to ask you three the same,&quot; Steph chuckled. &quot;Everything okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just a routine patrol,&quot; Bravo stated. The gynoid now turning to Darren. &quot;We heard about what happened to Ren. Sorry we couldn&#39;t help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey you were still in the academy,&quot; Steph stated. &quot;We all know you would have helped if you could.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Charlie sighed. &quot;But we still feel bad about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Steph smiled, drawing the three gynoids into a sisterly hug. &quot;I know you do,&quot; she said softly. &quot;And that&#39;s why you three are going to make the best cops this town has ever seen. Just please, stay safe out there. For me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure mom,&quot; Bravo chuckled, causing Steph to playfully muss his fur.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thats big sister thank you very much,&quot; Steph smirked. &quot;But I&#39;m serious. You three take care of eachother. I worry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dont worry Steph I&#39;ll keep them safe,&quot; Blue smirked. &quot;Cmon guys we need to finish our patrol and report back to the station.&quot; Waving goodbye the three gunoid police officers now made their way towards the other end of the park, Steph nervously watching as they went.<br />
<br />
&quot;You okay Steph,&quot; Darren asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; she sighed. &quot;Its just...I worry about those three.  They&#39;re like my kid brothers.  I know they felt guilty about not being able to help Ren but they were still being programmed at the time. I mean by Soul Drive standards they&#39;re kids, just off the assembly line.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll do great Steph,&quot; Darren smiled. &quot;They&#39;re good at what they do and they have you looking out for them. I&#39;m sure they&#39;re going to make you proud.&quot;</p>
