<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The team was less than a day away from the big game. The Woman&#39;s basketball tournement which allowed for 5 women per team. Andrea and her 4 friends had been playing the sport since they were little kids. Her and her friends, Kelly, Jenny, Maggie, and Jane grew up on the same street and would play basketball on the street almost every day after school. Years later, as adults they still loved the sport and were now on a professional team. They had entered a tournament that consisted of 20 different teams, and tomorrow was the big day. Best of all their daughters had come to cheer them on! <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, while the five women were on their way to a practice gym to prepare themselves, they were in a car wreck. No one had been severely hurt, but after the doctor did some x-rays, he declared that it was too dangerous for the woman to play Basket ball for at least two weeks for it could risk severe injury. Naturally the five women were devastated, they had practiced for months for this moment,and now, this. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well shit!&quot; said Maggie banging her hand on the bar. They had gone to a local tavern to drink away there sorrows. &quot;I second that!&quot; replied Kelly. &quot;What the hell are we supposed to do now?&quot; asked Jane.<br />
&quot;Well what do you mean? Its over, its done, we pack up and go home! Doctors orders!&quot; Said Jenny. &quot;Besides, I&#39;m not sticking around to watch the other teams compete, it would be too painful to watch.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well ladies, there might be another way for us to get the golden trophy.&quot; said Andrea. Andrea pulled out a duffel bag from under the table, she unzipped it revealing what looked like an ordinary Basket Ball.<br />
&quot;How the hell is a dirty old ball supposed to help us?!&quot; asked Maggie some what annoyed.<br />
&quot;Allow me to explain, first of all being that we all have young kids I assume that we&#39;ve  all seen the movie Space Jam correct?&quot;<br />
The other four woman nodded in confusion. <br />
<br />
Andrea told them about a mysterious old lady that she had met in a little shop downtown. The Old Lady told Andrea that she was magic, as were all the items in this shop. Andrea snorted it off at first but then the Lady gave a few examples, shooting of a few magic spells here and there, one that involved giving Andrea a pair of bunny ears. Once Andrea was convinced, the Old Lady pulled out this dusty old basket ball, she told Andrea that all she had to was have her and her teammates<br />
place their hands on the ball and their Basket ball talents would be sucked out of them and absorbed into the ball. Then the had to get five other people to touch the ball and their talents would go into those people, giving them the ability to play Basket Ball like a pro.<br />
<br />
Andrea could see that her friends we still not convinced, so she placed her had on the ball. Suddenly the ball faintly glowed as a beam of light shot out of the ball, up Andrea&#39;s arm, and then back into the ball again, a small glowing orb formed into the ball and could be seen floating inside. The four other women looked at the ball with surprised looks on there faces. &quot;Jesus, what the hell was that?! asked Jenny. &quot;Like I said, that is my talent, if I tried to play Basket ball right now without it, I would suck miserably.&quot; Answered Andrea. <br />
&quot;Wow! This is unreal!&quot; Said Maggie. &quot;So what your saying is we need to take our talents out of us and give them to someone else to compete in the tourney for us? Do I have that right?&quot; asked Jane.<br />
&quot;Yeah thats about right!&quot; said Andrea. <br />
&quot;So who are we supposed to entrust with our talents?&quot; asked Kelly. <br />
&quot;Well, we need five players, and we each have a Daughter thats here to cheer us on so...why not them?&quot; said Andrea. &quot;If they want to of course&quot;. Said Jane. &quot;Of course!&quot; said Andrea smiling. <br />
<br />
<br />
Diana (10), Candace (9), Lauren (10), Lisa (12), and Skylar (8) Were all up in Andrea and Diana&#39;s Hotel room playing board games, watching a movie on TV, and Talking about how sad they were that there moms weren&#39;t going to be able to compete in the Tourney tomorrow.<br />
&quot;Man, I really sucks we won&quot;t get to see our Moms compete in the game tomorrow.&quot; said Diana. <br />
&quot;They would of been the best team out there!&quot; said Candace. <br />
&quot;They would of crushed them!&quot; said Lauren. <br />
&quot;I would stare at that gold trophy all day!&quot; said Lisa.<br />
&quot; I would of cheered for my Mom the whole time!&quot; said Skylar. <br />
Suddenly there Moms all came back from there dinner. &quot;Hey girls, could you all please sit down, there&quot;s something that we need to talk to you five about.&quot; Said Kelly. <br />
Andrea and the other moms proceeded to explain to their daughters the plan they had formed, and afterwards Jane pulled out the glowing basket ball with all their talents in it. <br />
&quot;All you girls have to do is to touch this ball and you will turn into professional basketball players. <br />
Being little girls, they still believed in magic in the world and were easily convinced.<br />
&quot;So all of your talents are in there?&quot; asked Diana. <br />
&quot;yep! everything will go just fine, Trust us!&quot; Said Andrea. <br />
The five little girls had no reason not to trust there moms, plus they thought it would be cool to play a game of basket ball and have all those people cheering them on. With that, The five girls got off the bed and one by one they all put there hands on the ball together.<br />
<br />
As soon as the girls put their hands on the ball it glowed brightly. Their moms talents shot out of the ball and up their arms into their bodies. The girls gasped as a wind blew their hair back.<br />
The could feel the energy surging through them. <br />
<br />
Diana was the first to notice changes to her body. She looked at her hands as her arms grew longer as muscles developed there. Her hands grew bigger and her fingers longer and slimmer, while this was happening she was growing taller, the magic inside her caused her clothes to dissolve of while the rest of her overall physique improved gaining muscle tone all over her body. Her hips widened and her butt grew larger and firmer. Her collar bone popped outwards and so did her spine, her breast began to develop as they grew to small C cups.Finally her head changed her cheekbones rose and her round head became oval, her chin became more dainty, her light brown hair grew longer down her back. Finally her body continued to gain more muscle mask as the body changes died down. <br />

<br />
Once her body was done changing a white jersey appeared on her followed by a pair of basket ball shorts and a pair of tennis shoes. <br />
<br />
Candace watched as her best friend transformed in front of her when suddenly she felt a tingling in her feet. She looked down to see her bare feet shaking wildly in the carpet, when her left foot suddenly grew several sizes larger followed quickly by her right foot, a pair of adult basket ball shoes then appeared on her now larger feet fitting perfectly. A shot of energy flooded Candace&#39;s body. She hunched over for a brief second while her hair exploded longer, her body quickly shot upwards in just a few seconds changing from a small girls to a grown woman&#39;s. Muscle developed all over her body as her breast quickly developed into medium sized C cups. Her face had already matured when she shot up but it slimmed out just a little bit more while her hips cracked outwards and her butt inflated as a yellow basketball jersey and shorts appeared on her. <br />
<br />

<br />
Lauren couldn&#39;t concentrate on her friends turning into professional basketball players as she was in the process of turning into one herself. She had her back turned to the other girls and the moms.<br />
She hunched over as her clothing disintegrated off of her, muscle began to develop on her 10 year old body as she was about to leave that age behind. Suddenly she arched her back as she began to quickly grow taller and taller. As she grew her muscles grew bigger each inch, her backside filled out while her hips widened. Lauren groaned as she suddenly hunched over clutching her stomach, her height stopped but her muscles continued to grow slightly more while her spine popped out ward down her back and her blond hair flowed downwards. <br />

<br />
As a green basketball uniform began to appear on her body she turned around to face the other girls just in time to watch Lisa and Skylar finish their transformations up as they began changing while she was in the middle of hers. <br />
<br />
Once Lisa stopped growing it was clear that she would be the tallest out of the five of them, Lauren watched as face finished contorting which also made it clear that she was also the oldest of the five, a yellow uniform appeared on her well developed body and her hair grew to the bottom of her neck. <br />
<br />

<br />
Skylar&#39;s left arm suddenly grew longer and more muscular with a slim womanly hand on the end, her right arm followed, then her left leg did the same filling out nice and slender followed by her right leg doing the same shreeding her pants off but quickly being replaced by a pair of yellow basketball shorts. Her torso quickly grew larger exploding her top of her now bigger body. Her breast quickly grew to be the biggest out of the group while she gained a nice hourglass figure with well toned abs. A Yellow jersey quickly appeared while her face began to change. It smoothed out while her cheekbones rose and her face became more oval giving her to look of a young woman. Finally her dark hair lengthened down her back and a few more parts of her body gained some more muscle mass.<br />

<br />
Finaly all 5 little girls had been turned into 5 Experienced Woman basketball players. <br />
<br />
There Moms were also impressed with the end result. Andrea was happy to see what kind of woman her daughter could become one day. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow I feel so much more powerful!&quot;Said Candace as she felt her body all over under her uniform. <br />
&quot;Time to play a little basket ball!&quot; Said Lauren. <br />
&quot;I&#39;d like to spend some time checking out my body first.&quot; Said Skylar. <br />
&quot;There will be time for that later! First things first. Who is going to be the leader of our team?&quot;Asked Lisa. <br />
&quot;Well since my Mom was the leader of there team, I guess it only makes sense for it to be me.&quot;Said Diana. <br />
&quot;Yeah that seems fair to me.&quot; Said Candace. The other girls agreed as well. <br />
<br />
&quot;Its settled then, Diana will lead the team, I have great faith that with my talent you will be able to lead them to victory!&quot; Said Andrea. <br />
&quot;Thanks Mom! Alright Ladies, lets head down to the gym and get some practice in!&quot;Instructed Diana. <br />
And she lead the other girls out of the room and down to the Gym. <br />
<br />
The Moms watched as their now grown daughters walked down the hotel hallway. <br />
&quot;I just know they will make us proud!&quot; Said Jenny. <br />
Andrea turned to her friend and smiled. &quot;I think I&#39;m already proud of them!&quot;<br />
<br />
