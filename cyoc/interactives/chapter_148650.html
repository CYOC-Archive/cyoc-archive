<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Stepping Into Dad’s Shoes Chapter 3<br />
Aaron still hadn’t gotten used to being so big. He had never been in a car before where he could sit up and see everything. It was a lot neater this way. He was sitting in the passenger seat while Jimmy was going over what had happened. Aaron caught a glimpse of himself in the rear view mirror. It was so weird, looking at your reflection and it not being you, instead having your dad there. He touched his tie, which was now his, not his dad’s. His suit, on his big frame. He found he kept on having to touch it, and his face with the fine stubble on it to make sure it was all real. His hair was black now. And his muscles just felt…it felt so much better. The slightest move was enough so that he could feel how much heavier it was now, and the sensation was better than anything he’d ever experienced. He’d been trying to pay attention to everything, but it was so hard. He was enjoying being bigger for the first time ever.<br />
<br />
“So that’s the story, they basically want us to smooth things over. MorphCorp thinks that the new development could be a bad move because of Lou taking the job with GNC as one of their department heads. He couldn’t have picked a worse time to bail. But hey, that just leaves more room for you and me to make an impression. You’re looking at a promotion any day now as long as you put your vacation on hold, Jake.” Jimmy finished, and smoothed over his own head, which was shaved. Aaron wondered if he’d look good with a shaved head, then decided his dad would get really mad if he did something like that with the body he was in. He smiled. Maybe he should get a Mohawk instead, or tattoos on his shoulders and arms, like he always had wanted to. That probably wouldn’t go over very much better.<br />
<br />
Before he knew it he was walking inside the building and following Jimmy into the elevator. He smoothed his suit. Maybe if I just pretend to be dad, everything will be okay, he thought. <br />
<br />
As it turned out, the adults at the meeting, who for the most part weren’t as tall as him, were seated at a long table going over reports. They greeted him as Jake and for a second he wondered why, before remembering he was Jake. <br />
<br />
‘Okay,” he thought. ‘Jake is my new name now. Jake is my name.”<br />
<br />
The meeting was mostly boring. The adults there were worried that they weren’t going to sell a bunch of gym equipment to a bunch of guys. And something about going into high schools to sell equipment across the nation. It was either their company that would get the contract or someone else’s company. They all had to think of ways to make it be them. He furrowed his brows and started reading the report. Dad always made it seem so difficult, like his job was really hard, but Aaron had no trouble understanding it. It was a simple matter of socio economics. The demographics weren’t hard to understand…more Americans were in need of exercise than ever before. The market was definitely there to take advantage of, they just had to find the right approach.<br />
<br />
Before he knew it, Aaron found he had suggestions. He concentrated very hard and looked inside, and just found there was a fountain of knowledge he didn’t have before. He found himself referencing accounts, people, and events that he previously had no understanding of. But it was so simple! Everyone at the table seemed to think his suggestions were really neat.<br />
<br />
After work, which he was very proud of, it really being his first day, Jimmy offered to drive him home, but asked if they could stop at the bar first.<br />
<br />
“Oh I’m not allowed to go to bars. I’m not old enough.”<br />
<br />
Jimmy laughed. “Yeah, me neither! Hey maybe they’ll card us, hey champ! C’mon, let’s get a brewskie.”<br />
<br />
Jimmy was nervous all the way to the bar. His father wouldn’t mind, right? It was his dad’s body and it was okay for dad to drink beer. His hands shook as he opened the door. Some kids rode their skateboards by him, a little bit too close.<br />
<br />
“Hey you kids, be careful!” Aaron shouted, adjusting his tie.<br />
<br />
“Huh? Oh, sorry mister.”<br />
<br />
“Oh. Uh…it’s okay.”<br />
<br />
That was weird, he thought. I’m acting just like dad!<br />
<br />
Inside the bar, it was all guys. A lot of them were smoking cigarettes or cigars. Jimmy ordered two dark drafts of Guiness. He knew he was doing something he wasn’t supposed to, but maybe it would be okay as long as he didn’t tell dad. When his beer arrived, Aaron nervously sipped. It wasn’t bad, he thought. It tasted rich and thick. He licked it off his stubble, like he’d seen his dad do so many times. Before he knew it, he was on his second. He and Jimmy were talking shit. Jimmy was really cool, he’d decided. He had always been slightly intimidated by him but now that they were both adults, it just seemed to change. Like, he didn’t have to try that hard to be adult sounding. They talked about baseball, and then work. It was funny, he kept remembering stuff he hadn’t known about before. He didn’t have his dad’s memories at all, but he could just know stuff suddenly. Ledger reports, accounting work, buyers, gym reps, all of it just seemed totally familiar. <br />
<br />
By the time he got home, he entered without warning dad. His father, and as far as Jimmy was concerned, his son, was lying on the couch dazing at TV. His father rose and rubbed his eyes.<br />
<br />
“Oh, hey tiger!”<br />
<br />
“Huh? Oh, hi Jimmy. Uh…I mean, Mr. Bentley.”<br />
<br />
“Well, I guess I’ll let you get some shut eye. You two have a good night. I’ll see you bright and early tomorrow morning. I wish you didn’t have to put your vacation off, but with all that’s going on, you’re just gonna have to stay put. At least you don’t have to deal with anything else this week, right? Night, buddy!”<br />
<br />
Aaron closed the door behind Jimmy and turned to face his diminuitive father. <br />
<br />
“Okay, tell me everything! Did anyone suspect anything was wrong?”<br />
<br />
“No dad, it was totally great! I’m really good at going to work!”<br />
<br />
“Champ, listen. Maybe we can invent some ploy out of this. We can’t have you getting me fired. No offense, but if we don’t play our cards right…I mean you are just a kid and you can’t do an adult man’s job.”<br />
<br />
Aaron looked briefly hurt.<br />
<br />
“It looks like one just did. Yeah. I totally was an adult today! It’s like…like I just knew stuff. Like the Peterson account. I just knew all about it. I mean maybe I’m just good at reading the reports and stuff. But it’s like I knew everyone’s names and stuff. Did that happen to you too, dad?”<br />
<br />
“What, you mean when I switched with my father? I can’t remember. That was over twenty years ago!”<br />
<br />
“Well, I can totally do this. It’s easy! I’m meeting with a few people tomorrow.”<br />
<br />
“Who??”<br />
<br />
“Dave Darling, Kate Underhill, Dave Linneaus. You know, Dave and Dave. We’re going to go over stock options.”<br />
<br />
“This is totally freaking me out. How do you know about all this? How could you?”<br />
<br />
“I dunno, dad. Just let me be an adult this week. I can do it! Pleeeeease?”<br />
<br />
“Okay. But give me all the paperwork. I intend to make SURE that nothing goes wrong tomorrow. Is my job really on the line? What’s happening?”<br />
<br />
“MorphCorp is threatening to pull out and go with another company.”<br />
<br />
“Those bastards! They can’t! What about the high school gym project?”<br />
<br />
“They’re saying they might put it on hold. Not enough money in it.”<br />
<br />
<br />
“My shrunken ass. All right. Thanks, just let me read through these…is that beer on your breath?!”<br />
<br />
Aaron started getting upset and breathing fast and nearly crying. “Dad, don’t get upset!” the grown man wailed. “I just had a few beers and I was you so I thought it was okay!”<br />
<br />
“Settle down. Just…it’s okay this once. But you have to be careful. You can’t go to work hung over! That’s all. And don’t get too used to it, I’m not letting you drink once you go back into your body, mister.”<br />
<br />
“Okay, dad. I know. Sheesh.” Aaron yawned and outstretched his arms and felt his suit over his big muscles. “I’m gonna take a shower.” He trudged off to the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Reading over the reports, Jake marveled at Aaron’s notes. It was so similar to things he would write he was taken aback. What the hell was going on here? He chalked it up to the magic. After completing the necessary corrections, he found himself dozing on the couch. It was only 10:00 PM but he was so overwhelmingly tired.<br />
<br />
* * *<br />
<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Aaron found himself in the shower marveling at how his new body felt. The water rushed over his hairy chest, his hand skimmed down and touched his penis. It was standing up by itself! He was having an erection in his dad’s body. Instinctively, gingerly, he touched it. It didn’t feel like he thought one would feel. He could feel…uh UUUUUHHHHHHHHH!<br />
<br />
Aaron had never had an adult orgasm before. He couldn’t believe how big and hard his new dick was or how it seemed to have a mind of its own. He thought of guys…all sorts of guys. Hot muscle guys, football studs, teachers of his, suit wearing men at work, hot actors in movies but he’d never thought of them in that way before…just wanting to see them naked and oh oh ohOHOHOHOH<br />
<br />
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH<br />
<br />
The jet of cum was so fierce and strong Aaron could hardly believe it. It coated his hands and legs and the floor. It went up and up. It was erupting like a geyser! <br />
<br />
He had screamed out loud while he jerked himself off. He didn’t even care if his dad heard. He just kept thinking of Jimmy, taking his shirt off and all of these images of guys that came unbidden into his mind.<br />
<br />
“OH fuck yeah,” he said and smiled in an ecstatic state. “That was AMAZING!” <br />
<br />
He wound up getting to bed and set the alarm before collapsing.</p>
