<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Marcus was lying on the floor as a regular set of dick and balls. He can&#39;t move, speak or hear anything. However he was still conscious and can feel with his super sensitive skin, also he was able to see in a very odd way through his pee hole. Furthermore, he&#39;s so aroused that he was rock hard and can&#39;t think anything but cumming.<br />
After several minutes as a dick, he felt that someone grabbed him. He spurted a lot of precum at that moment, so his sight got blur, but he can feel he was moving fast.<br />
When he managed to control his horniness a little, he saw a intense light covering everything around him for a second before he felt he was dropped on a cold metallic surface. It was too cold that his erection receded into a semi hard state and his balls shrank a little.<br />
After a moment lying there, he felt a painful sting that he assumed was a needle because a hot liquid was inserted into his dick body. That injection made him hard again but it wasn&#39;t arousal but something completely different.<br />
His balls elongated until they looked like tiny human legs, his shaft changed into a torso and tiny arms grew on it. Finally, his dick head got eyes, ears, hair, a nose and a mouth as it turned into his former human head. Marcus was a tiny version of himself except for one thing, he didn&#39;t have genitals. He was like a doll version of himself.<br />
After being sure that he was human again, albeit his smaller size, he saw that his friends were lying around him and returning to their human shapes too.<br />
&quot;What happened?&quot; Mason, Marcus&#39; best friend asked when his transformation was done.<br />
&quot;Shit, that felt good.&quot; James, a ginger bully, said as he stood up.<br />
&quot;Are you ok guys? Where are we?&quot; Sam, the black and youngest member of them, said. &quot;Where are our clothes?!&quot;<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know where we are.&quot; Marcus said. &quot;But we&#39;re naked because we used to ne our dicks.&quot;<br />
&quot;Our dicks?!! Hahaha!!&quot; James laughed. &quot;Are you kidding, right?&quot;<br />
&quot;No, it&#39;s true.&quot; Marcus said. &quot;I saw how a green beam shot you and turned you into your genitals, then I saw you turn back to normal a moment ago.&quot;<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t believe it.&quot; Sam said.<br />
&quot;I do.&quot; Mason said. &quot;Look at yourself, our dicks are gone.&quot;<br />
&quot;It&#39;s because our whole bodies are our dicks now.&quot; Marcus told them. &quot;I felt a needle, maybe that change us back to our human shapes but we&#39;re still our dicks&#39; skins!&quot;<br />
&quot;Ok, I trust you.&quot; James said and Sam nodded. &quot;But, do you know where we are?&quot;<br />
&quot;I think it&#39;s a spaceship.&quot; Sam interfered. &quot;Look around.&quot;<br />
It was a dark place except for the light above them, so it was difficult to see anything but the metallic floor under their feet. However, it was possible to see a few red lights blinking in the darkness. But, most importantly, a small circle window let them see the outer space and planet earth at the distance.<br />
&quot;Holy shit! We&#39;re abducted!!&quot; James panicked. Mason was gasping but Marcus and Sam stayed calm.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s pointless to panic.&quot; Marcus said. &quot;We need to find a way to go back to ear...&quot;  But before he could finish a light emerged from the darkness and a huge silhouette approached to them.<br />
It&#39;s difficult to define its shape but it looked similar to a giant octopus to Marcus and his friends. When it was so close to them, it extended a huge tentacle that grabbed them before they can&#39;t run away and dropped them into a cage similar to the ones in a zoo.<br />
It was difficult to say how big that cage was but for their actual size it was huge, with a few levels, tunnels and other stuff that you could find in a hamster cage.<br />
&quot;Where are you taking us?!!&quot; James yelled at the creature but it didn&#39;t flinch. Instead, it shot a green laser to James, who fell to the floor in pain.<br />
&quot;James!!&quot; Sam ran to his aid but he was shot by the laser too. &quot;Aaargh!!&quot;<br />
When Sam felt to the floor, Mason was the next shot followed closely by Marcus. After a moment, they all recovered exhaustively gasping.<br />
&quot;What the fuck was that?!&quot; James shouted and realized that they were apparently alone again. &quot;What&#39;s that thing?!&quot;<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; Marcus said as he held his stomach. &quot;But that hurt a lot!&quot;<br />
&quot;Are you alright?&quot; Sam asked and James and Marcus nodded but Mason don&#39;t.<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t feel good.&quot; Mason said before he belched. All the other boys looked terrified how Mason was suddenly pumping like a balloon and his skin was turning gray. Mason tried to speak but he belched once again showing how big his mouth had turned.<br />
&quot;He is changing.&quot; Sam said as he watched how Mason hands and feet looked bigger and animalistic. &quot;He looks like a-&quot; <br />
&quot;Like a hippo.&quot; Marcus interrupted. &quot;He&#39;s turning into a hippo.&quot;<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t say stupid things.&quot; James told Marcus without realizing that he was changing too, he was gaining weight like Mason and his skin was turning grey too but his ears were growing huge and flat.<br />
&quot;You&#39;re changing too!&quot; Marcus told him. &quot;You look like an elephant!&quot;<br />
James saw his hands and realized that Marcus was right, he screamed but his human sound quickly turned into elephant noise as his nose changed into a trunk.<br />
&quot;It looks like Mason transformation is done.&quot; Sam said. &quot;He&#39;s turned into a hippopotamus.&quot; He looked at his hands and noticed that he was changing too. &quot;It&#39;s my turn.&quot; He softly said but tears were coming out from him. &quot;Marcus, I don&#39;t want to be an animal.&quot; A horn grew up in his nose and he quickly transformed into a rhino. Marcus was the last boy left as James had turned into an elephant.<br />
&quot;Sam!&quot; He shouted as he saw his friend&#39;s tears moving through his rhino cheeks. He  didn&#39;t know what to do, he knew that eventually he will be an animal too.<br />
&quot;Aaahh!!&quot; Marcus screamed in pain when he felt his body changing. His neck elongated a lot as well as his arms and legs. &quot;Please, help!&quot; He begged with his last words before he turned into a giraffe.<br />
The alien creature entered again and took the four animals with his tentacles and put them into what it looks like a giant dissection table. The boys, still conscious of themselves were panicked screaming all the time but it was useless as one by one were dissected.<br />
<br />
&quot;Surprise!!&quot; Jeanie laughed as she wake Marcus up.<br />
&quot;Holy fuck!!&quot; Marcus screamed followed by his friends.<br />
&quot;What the fuck happened?!!&quot; James shouted.<br />
&quot;We&#39;re back in the cabin...&quot; Sam muttered. &quot;It was a dream?&quot;<br />
&quot;If you&#39;re talking about what I think you are.&quot; Mason said. &quot;I don&#39;t think it was a dream, because then I had the same dream.&quot;<br />
&quot;That wasn&#39;t a dream, silly boys!&quot; Jeanie said. &quot;It was me!&quot;<br />
&quot;Who the fuck are you?!&quot; James yelled at her.<br />
&quot;Hey, don&#39;t be so rude!&quot; Jeanie replied. &quot;That&#39;s not a language for a young fellow.&quot; She snapped her fingers and James turned into a middle age man. &quot;Much better.&quot;<br />
&quot;What the-?!!&quot; James yelled in a deeper voice.<br />
&quot;Jeanie!! Turn him back!!&quot; Marcus ordered. &quot;Sorry guys, this is Jeanie. She&#39;s a genie.&quot;<br />
&quot;A genie?!!&quot; Mason said so surprised. &quot;Do you have your own genie, Marcus, and you don&#39;t tell us?&quot;<br />
&quot;Hey, I&#39;m not his genie.&quot; Jeanie complained as she returned James to normal. &quot;He is my human.&quot;<br />
&quot;Your human?&quot; James said as he went through his twenties. &quot;Are you some kind of pet, Marcus? Pff, that&#39;s pathetic.&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not her pet!&quot; Marcus upset replied. &quot;I&#39;m her... ehm... friend&quot;<br />
&quot;Friend with benefits?&quot; James smirked.<br />
&quot;Benefits? What kind of benefits?&quot; Jeanie asked to Marcus but his face turned red and didn&#39;t reply. &quot;Don&#39;t you want to tell me, huh? What if you show me what you have in mind.&quot;<br />
&quot;No, wait!&quot; Marcus tried to stop her but her magic had already taken effect on him. He grew at least ten years older and a lot of muscles, but was more impressive was the huge bulge that grew between his legs. &quot;Oh, Jeanie!&quot; He complained in a deep rich voice.<br />
&quot;I still don&#39;t get it.&quot; Jeanie snapped her fingers and turned Marcus back to normal.<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t have too.&quot; Marcus shyly said as he saw his package turning smaller.<br />
&quot;So, you did the alien abduction?&quot; Sam interrupted. &quot;That wasn&#39;t funny! I was scared as hell!&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; Jeanie apologized. &quot;My plan was to make a joke to Marcus but you did it first. So I decided to do it to all of you!&quot; <br />
&quot;And you can make anything with your magic.&quot; Mason asked her.<br />
&quot;Can you turn me older again?&quot; James interrupted. &quot;Not too old, just a few years to hook up some chicks.&quot;<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; Jeanie said confused. &quot;Are you saying like this?&quot; She snapped her fingers and James grew up into a hunky 25 years old guy.<br />
&quot;Oh yeah!&quot; He said as he admired his new muscles. &quot;Look at my biceps!&quot; He flexed his arms exposing his bulging muscles. &quot;I will fuck tonight!!&quot;<br />
&quot;Hey you&#39;re still with kids,don&#39;t you know?&quot; Marcus told him.<br />
&quot;Huh? Can you make them older too?&quot; James asked Jeanie.<br />
&quot;Mmm... Why not.&quot; She snapped her fingers again and Marcus, Mason and Sam turned into hunky young men too. &quot;Hoo! That&#39;s enough magic for a day.&quot; She gasped. &quot;I see you tomorrow. Bye, Marcus!&quot;<br />
&quot;Wait, Jeanie! You can&#39;t leave us like this!&quot; Marcus shout at her but it was useless because she vanished in the air. &quot;Great, we&#39;re stuck like this!&quot;<br />
&quot;Hey, don&#39;t complain, pussy.&quot; James said. &quot;We&#39;re grown ups tonight! Let&#39;s find some fun!&quot;<br />
&quot;We&#39;re in a camp in the middle of nowhere.&quot; Mason said as he rubbed his new beard. &quot;There&#39;s no place we can go.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh jeez!&quot; James complained. &quot;Guys, you&#39;re thinking with your heads when you should start to think with that thing between your legs.&quot; That&#39;s when they realized that they&#39;re naked and their new manhoods were getting hard. &quot;Much better.&quot; James grinned. &quot;So, who does want to compare dick sizes?&quot;</p>
