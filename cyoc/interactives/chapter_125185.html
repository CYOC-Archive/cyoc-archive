Dear reader, yes they are of age but in my book a year is longer for them and their kind age a bit differently hence how they are described.<br />

<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom I am fine!&quot; you said grabbing your satchel. You never got to explore but now that you are at the age of 13 you can leave just as the rules of your homeland state, The land of Caverns and Quartz. You run outside grabbing a jacket as it was constantly cold in the crystalline land you called home but you everything would change once you slid down the caverns for your first exploration. People were always sent young due to 2 things, number 1 was population growth and the odd fear of moving underground and the other was the transformations that came of all who traveled deep for their home. Your home planet was named Cicero and the people who lived on this large crystal and ice planet often had skin no lighter than olive and a deep roasted chestnut being the most prominent skin color. Everyone&#39;s hair was different of course all the way from straight to Afro and frost blonde to jet black. Your planet was in the middle of a very old solar system in one of the oldest galaxies but oddly enough, cosmic energy always kept your part of the universe alive even though it was enigmatic for you. &quot;Well, I&#39;m here!&quot; you said as you examined the area which was seemingly made of a blue quartz or diamond of some sort. You never understood how plants grew here but you decided often it was better to not question it. You look above the cavern entrance and see the words, &quot;Mutare Venturus Est!&quot; &quot;Huh, Maybe some people on Terra knows what that means as you think out loud.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
After 3 hours walking down the slick cavern you come across a camp site and you find your feet planted on the tent by the drop faster than you could think. &quot;People abandon these places all the time!&quot; you thought to yourself as you scooted towards an Amethyst and Nephrite fueled. &quot;Enjoyin&#39; my campsite?&quot; You whipped around to see another boy who couldn&#39;t be older than 16. &quot;I, uh... I mean um did a thing and then fire so I was sleepy and I uh umm...&quot; you were freaking out inside. &quot;Calm down shorty!&quot; &quot;I have an extra tent in my trunk, no need to pass out on me!&quot; You can feel your face turn crimson as he sets his make shift tent up for you which is actually pretty large! &quot;What&#39;s your name?&quot; you ask, trying not to sound all innocent. &quot;My name is Derek, I kinda got a late start on exploring as I had to get my siblings ready.&quot; &quot;Now, what is your name?&quot;  &quot;A-A-Aaron!&quot; You say flustered and red at the face you are covering with your hands. &quot;Calm down, I ain&#39;t out to get ya.&quot; &quot;Maybe we could work together for these next few years to a decade or so.&quot; Your heart jumped out of it&#39;s chest when you heard that, sometimes you wish you didn&#39;t have such a dirty mind. You pull out some cooked shock lizard meat that you hunted down weeks before and then preserved for a nice meal on the trek. &quot;Here have some ambrosia juice.&quot; Derek said handing you a wooden cup. &quot;Thanks!&quot; you said as you were eating rather violently. You tried to focus but you couldn&#39;t stop thinking of him. 6 feet tall with slightly curled black hair to match his copper skin and light brown amber eyes. His toned frame and bright white smile gave off a kindness you had never been met with before. he did nothing but flood your mind. That night you slept by lantern light in a leather tent wrapped up in cave buffalo&#39;s leather and wool. Ultimately you looked like a sexually confused bean curd puff. &quot;Hey, Aaron, we better get a move on or we will never even make it past the underwater city!&quot; &quot;Derek!&quot; &quot;Did you say underwater?!?!?!?!&quot; you said almost crying. &quot;What&#39;s wrong dude?&quot; He asked full of worry like an older brother. &quot;I&#39;m afraid of water...&quot; you said knowing that you were weak. &quot;I can help you through it.&quot; &quot;Just let me carry you on my back.&quot; You ran to &quot;Pack up your things&quot; when he said that. &quot;Alright, Everything is inside my phantom quartz crystal so I think we are ready to go as you shoved the crystal in your satchel before locking and zipping it up. &quot;Hop on!&quot; he said filled with energy while you buried yourself into his back. He smelled like musky pine needles, smoke and honey. It was comforting to him as he dozed off. Derek shook his head a little bit and smirked as he continued downwards with Aaron on his back through the glowing caves. Hell he was worried about Aaron because he knew that he could not have weighed more than 75 pounds. Aaron felt a slight tapping on his shoulder and heard Derek whisper &quot;We&#39;re here.&quot; as to not scare him as soon as he woke up. Aaron gazed into the water and to his amazement every building was enchanted to keep air in while it contained flora and fauna. &quot;Hold on.&quot; Derek said as they took a deep breath and headed towards a large skyscraper like building. They both fell through one of the impossible to shatter &quot;Air windows&quot; and took a deep breath. &quot;Thank you!&quot; Aaron smiled from behind him, wrapping his legs and arms around him to give him a hug. Derek could only smile to a response like that. After putting Aaron down they explored the well kept ruins. &quot;It&#39;s been some time since I have seen a couple come together and 2 young boys none the less!&quot; They were bewildered until they saw a Geisha speaking in front of 6 mirrors with handles on them. &quot;Pick your weapon lovers!&quot; They both went crimson at that. &quot;You may need one later...&quot; Many small floating plates rose from the ground each holding a different symbolic item. &quot;You may now choose&quot; They looked at each other nervously. Aaron was being drawn to a green glowing plate with what seemed to be lightning coming from it. On that plate stood a jet black rose covered in thorns. Derek walked until something caught him from the corner of his eye. He walked forwards to a purple levitating plate that held a large white pick-ax as smooth as glass. &quot;Odd.&quot; The Geisha said resting her head in one of her hands while she watched. &quot;WHAT IS IT?!?!&quot; &quot;Most go for something more powerful like a sword or club, are you sure this is what you want?&quot; The boys nodded and she said &quot;Alright take them.&quot; As Aaron picked up his fragrant black rose it turned into a retractable dual side scythe and as Derek picked up his pick-ax it turned into chained kunai blades. The boys jaws dropped and the Geisha simply said &quot;Be true&quot; Before walking into nowhere and disappearing while all the plates fell back into their proper place. &quot;Middle door?&quot; Aaron asked meekly. &quot;Middle door.&quot; Derek said with a smile. they held hands as they opened the door together and were greeted by a safe tunnel down the cavern with oddly suggestive smells in the air. &quot;So... Derek, I got pretty scared today and was wondering if I could sleep with you.&quot; &quot;To fend off the nightmares I mean.&quot; &quot;Sure!&quot; he said with a smile holding Aaron&#39;s hand a bit tighter. they found a nice platform to put their tent and supplies and setup everything.<br />
<br />
Aaron pretended to lash around in his sleep and Derek knew that so he said, &quot;Maybe we should share a sleeping bag?&quot; before he could scoot over Aaron was buried inside the bag digging his head into Derek&#39;s chest. Neither of the boys had even a hint of facial hair so they decided to talk about what they wanted theirs to look like. &quot;Y&#39;know, I have hair other places...&quot; Derek said seductively causing Aaron to bite his bottom lip. They were both in boxers anyways so what did it matter? Derek unzipped his sleeping bag into a nice mat on the floor while Aaron decided to head south a bit. &quot;Ughhh...&quot; Derek moaned as Aaron inhaled the scent of his pubes. they pulled their boxers off and Aaron saw his throbbing cock leaking pre-cum just begging to be licked off. &quot;How long?&quot; &quot;10 inches.&quot; Derek said proudly as Aaron began to put the head in his mouth and move his tounge. After a couple tries and bobbing his head Aaron got 5 inches in as he moaned meanwhile Derek grabbed Aaron&#39;s jet black curly hair.<br />
Bobbing his head Aaron pulled off to say &quot;Derek you taste so good!&quot; Derek smiled before his face twisted into bliss as Aaron began sucking again. Aaron was being full out face fucked at this point with black pubes and saliva sticking to his cheeks. &quot;Oh god i&#39;m gonna cu-!&quot; Derek shot load after load of sweet and salty warm semen into Aaron&#39;s mouth giving him at least a gallon to swallow. &quot;S-Sorry that&#39;s a family trait.&quot; Derek said between shallow pants. &quot;A good one!&quot; Aaron added when he swallowed it all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aaron leaned down showing his ass to the sky. &quot;Wait a sec!&quot; Derek said as he lubed up Aaron&#39;s asshole with the semen left in his foreskin. &quot;Ok Aaron relax...&quot; Derek slowly slid his head in when he heard a small whimper from the boy below him. &quot;Do you want me to stop?&quot; he said worried. &quot;No keep going, I just need to let my body adjust.&quot; Derek slid in 3 more inches and heard another whimper. &quot;It&#39;s ok Aaron just relax.&quot;Aaron nodded as Derek slid the rest in over the course of 15 minutes. &quot;Fuck my brains out.&quot; Aaron said weakly. Derek pulled out and slammed back in crashing into his prostate. Aaron moaned in pure ecstasy. Derek picked Aaron up and sat him in his lap bouncing him up and down. &quot;Derek!&quot; Aaron both moaned and screamed his name as he felt the cock warming his insides. He slumped onto Derek as he came 3 hot loads on Derek&#39;s chest. Aaron felt another gallon of cum go straight into his stomach as he was attached to his cock. Both tired Derek wrapped them up and they spent the night attached and covered in cum.</p>
