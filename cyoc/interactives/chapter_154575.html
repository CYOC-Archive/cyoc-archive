<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Diego and Ryan agreed to meet up after school. Diego promised to show Ryan his weight room, built in one corner of his parents&#39; basement. He intended to show his new buddy much more than that, of course. He was sure that Ryan would be the key to finally leaving his five-foot-four height behind!<br />
<br />
The hours ticked by slowly, it seemed; Diego was a mix of excitement over what he planned to do and frustration with the wait. Even a session with the increasingly-hunky Mr. Dearborn could only take the edge off for a few minutes. <br />
<br />
When the final period of the day was over, Diego forced himself to stroll casually to the parking lot where he&#39;d agreed to meet Ryan, suppressing the urge to run. As he arrived, he greeted his new friend, then led him over to his car. As they drove back to Diego&#39;s house, he noticed Ryan kept watching him, staring at his huge body. Diego&#39;s car was old, and a manual to boot, so his big arm was constantly at work, gripping the gearshift, the cords of his thick forearm bulging as he shifted. <br />
<br />
With his parents still at work, Diego could let them into the house and then lead Ryan down to the basement where his little gym was. He preferred the school&#39;s gym, or the commercial one a mile away, but he had a respectable collection of his own weights as well. His mother had forbidden him from using any of it, on Dr. Andrews&#39; advice, but she wouldn&#39;t be home for hours still. <br />
<br />
&quot;One of the advantages of a home gym,&quot; Diego explained, as he began to strip down to his boxers, &quot;is the lack of a dress code! I really love working out with my shirt off. I feel like I can focus on my muscles better when I can see them.&quot; He bounced his massive pecs for emphasis, the thick slabs of beef rising at his command, then falling ponderously when he released them. He watched with satisfaction as the bulge in Ryan&#39;s shorts shifted. <br />
<br />
&quot;You ever worked out before?&quot; Diego asked, as he lay back on his bench press. He gripped the bar, which only had a few plates on for warmups, and began to crank out perfect reps. <br />
<br />
&quot;Not really,&quot; Ryan responded, &quot;Just whatever we do in P.E., which is never weights.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we&#39;re going to change that, if you want,&quot; Diego offered, as he stood to slide more plates onto the bar, loading it down with more weight. As Ryan nodded affirmatively, Diego grinned. &quot;Then watch carefully. Pay attention to where my arms are, how I&#39;m gripping the weight, the speed at which I raise and lower it, the arc of the bar.&quot; <br />
<br />
For the next hour, Diego led Ryan through a series of exercises, demonstrating each one, then guiding Ryan through it as well. Slowly Ryan&#39;s clothes began to come off, as his shyness was overcome by his desire not to have his clothes soaked with sweat. His thin body had some small bit of muscle definition, but that had more to do with his low bodyfat, rather than much in the way of muscle mass. As the workout ended, he and Diego were both slick with sweat, and both quite hard in their respective boxers, Diego&#39;s endowment particularly prominent. <br />
<br />
Diego returned to the bench press, lay back on it, and grabbed a pair of heavy dumbbells. He&#39;d already shown Ryan how to do flys, but wanted to move on to the next stage in his plan. &quot;Get over here, Ryan,&quot; he said, &quot;And straddle my waist. I want you to feel my pecs as I do the exercise. Feel how they mound up as I bring the weight up.&quot; He began to move the weights, his huge pecs bunching up and crashing together. <br />
<br />
Ryan hesitated for a second. But the opportunity to get up close and personal with Diego&#39;s huge chest was too tempting to pass up. He carefully straddled the larger man&#39;s muscular stomach and gingerly put his hands on Diego&#39;s thick pecs. Diego began to explain the anatomy of the pectoral muscles, but Ryan could barely hear it. Feeling all that beef move under his fingers was mesmerizing. He only noticed a change when Diego finished a set and put the weights down. <br />
<br />
Then Ryan&#39;s memory caught up with him. Something Diego had said. &quot;Wait, you want me to do WHAT with your pecs?&quot; Ryan spluttered. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, man. You&#39;ve been boning up since I first pulled my shirt off. You must be going crazy. Shove that dick between my pecs,&quot; Diego explained. At Ryan&#39;s uncomprehending stare, Diego reached forward, and pulled Ryan&#39;s hard, six-inch tool out of his boxers. &quot;Fuck my pecs,&quot; Diego said firmly. &quot;You clearly love my huge chest, and I&#39;ve never done it. But I&#39;ve read about it and it sounds hot as fuck! So let&#39;s try it!&quot; <br />
<br />
Ryan was in a daze but he slid forward, spreading his legs wider as he struggled to get his legs around Diego&#39;s freakishly-thick lats. He gently laid his hard tool between Diego&#39;s huge pecs. Smirking, Diego flexed them, surrounding Ryan&#39;s dick, crushing it between them. The smaller man cried out in surprise and pleasure, feeling his dick get mashed between two mammoth slabs of muscle. He panted and groaned as Diego worked him over, just using those huge pecs, flexing them together or separately, jacking off Ryan&#39;s cock with big slabs of muscle, while Ryan leaked pre like mad. The smaller man began to pant heavily, his boner throbbing eagerly. &quot;I- I&#39;m gonna shoot!&quot; he moaned. <br />
<br />
Diego reached forward and grabbed Ryan&#39;s cute little ass. He roughly pulled the smaller man forward, onto his giant chest. He opened his mouth wide and swallowed Ryan&#39;s throbbing dick, not wanting to miss the virus-laden load. It came just as he wrapped his lips around the base of Ryan&#39;s tool, spewing warm cream into his mouth. Diego sucked it down greedily, draining every drop Ryan had in him, and still sucking a bit after that, just to make sure. <br />
<br />
When Diego finally let go of Ryan&#39;s body, the smaller man slid back and stood to the side. &quot;That... that was like nothing I&#39;ve ever done before...&quot; he stammered. <br />
<br />
&quot;Me neither,&quot; Diego added, as he ran his finger up and down the deep cleft down the middle of his muscular chest, collecting what pre he could and licking it off his fingers. &quot;Now let&#39;s shower and get cleaned up.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Um, don&#39;t you want me to, you know, return the favor or something?&quot; Ryan asked, pointing to the huge erection that tented Diego&#39;s sweat-soaked boxers. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, nobody can handle this thing,&quot; Diego demurred, pulling down the waistband of his underwear enough so that Ryan could see just how freakishly thick he was. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d be willing to try,&quot; Ryan asked hopefully, staring in awe at Diego&#39;s tremendous endowment. <br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe another day,&quot; Diego laughed. But he wasn&#39;t planning on letting Ryan try. He was going to save it all for himself, hoping that by consuming his own seed, he could keep the virus going inside him. <br />
<br />
--*--<br />
<br />
The following morning, Diego eagerly stood next to the mark on the wall that showed his height. He was clearly an inch taller. His grin stretched ear to ear, and his cock rose to rock hardness, beyond his usual morning wood. He stood on the scale, and was gratified to see it read 310--ten pounds heavier than the day before! Yet his muscles didn&#39;t look quite as ridiculously massive as before, likely because of his height gain. He strutted into the bathroom and locked the door, then began to slowly pump his huge tool, eager for a morning dose of his own seed. He was finally getting taller! And that meant he&#39;d have more room to add muscle. He jizzed all over the mirror at the thought of it, shooting great gobs of thick cum. As the initial explosion quieted, leaving him gushing a river of cum, he began to scoop it up to his lips, sucking it off of his hands. When that went dry he lapped it off of the mirror, making sure to get every bit. Then he showered, dressed, and went down to breakfast. He was already planning how to get more growth. Sucking off Ryan and Mr. Dearborn were obvious steps for the day. But he also wondered if a visit to Dr. Andrews could be profitable--the man had grown considerably, after all, and Diego knew exactly where the good doctor lived...</p>
