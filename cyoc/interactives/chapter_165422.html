<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">„We will now observe the process after conception. This usually takes months, but thanks to our technical equipment, we will be able to speed up the process.“<br />
Mei was getting scared now. She had no idea what Ty did to her this time. The constant replay of being cummed into had already taken it’s toll. Now she was meant to get pregnant? The teacher did not pay much attention to Mei. She was set on mute anyway, none of her questions could be heard.<br />
„We have already witnessed how the fertilized egg had moved to the lining of the uterus. This usually takes up to three or four days. Once the embryo is implanted, the cells will start to grow. They will eventually become the fetus and the placenta. Let me show you …“<br />
Once again the teacher pressed a button and all that he had described was visible on screen. The transmission from the electronic microscope showed how the cells were multiplying.<br />
„The tissue of the placenta transports oxygen, nutrients and hormones from the mother’s blood to the developing fetus.“ The teacher explained. „Up to this point the pregnant woman will not feel much different. Changes and symptoms of pregnancy will occur during the first trimester as the woman adjusts to hormonal changes. After time hormonal changes will lead to symptoms like, rising levels of estrogen. These might result in waves of nausea and vomiting, commonly known as morning sickness that is often felt during the first few months of pregnancy.“ As he was explaining this, the teacher was using the fast forward button to present the single stages of pregnancy to her students.<br />
Mei was already feeling weird. She was tired and felt sick. She felt an increasing pressure on her bladder and felt like she really had to go to the loo.<br />
„The woman might also need to urinate more frequently as her uterus grows and presses on her bladder. Mei, you can urinate now if you need to.“<br />
Mei did not want to, but for some reason she let go as soon as she got permission and a stream of thick urine shot down to the floor.<br />
The teacher fumbled on her remote again and now Mei’s already large bimbo-breast were increasing in size. Mei touched them, failing to believe they could go any further and immediately gasped. They had gotten even more sensitive. Her areolas were darkening and seemed to be increasing in size. Mei also felt her head glow. Her heart was beating faster and her emotions were in turmoil.<br />
Miss Carlsen now stopped the remote again and pointed to the screen showing Mei’s insides.<br />
„As you can clearly see, the embryo more and more resembles a human being. At this stage heart and lungs begin to develop, and arms, legs, brain, spinal cord and nerves begin to form.“ She pushed fast forward again and the picture of the electron microscope had changed again.<br />
„The embryo starts about the size of a pea around one month into pregnancy, and will have grown into the size of a kidney bean around the second month.“ Once again Miss Carlsen used fast forward and Mei felt the different stages pregnancy and all the symptoms happening to her in short succession.<br />
„Please observe the swollen breasts and her swollen nipples. They are all tender and sensitive now.“<br />
As Miss Carlsen was explaining, she grabbed Mei’s breast and fumbled at her nipple for demonstration. Mei was squirming under her touch. Never before had she felt the touch as strongly as when she was pregnant.<br />
„Between week 13 to 28 the embryo is growing in Mei’s body. You will observe how her belly is stretching to accommodate the fetus. This might be accompanied by pain in her back, abdomen, groin and tights. We have also heard reports of itching on the abdomen, palms and soles of the feet, sometimes numb or tingling hands might occur.“<br />
Mei felt sick now. Her whole body was hurting. She showed all the symptoms, for demonstration apparently and she felt like having to pee constantly but was constipated at the same time. Sitting on the desk became more and more uncomfortable. As the teacher carried on with her explanations and sped up the speed of pregnancy, Mei was getting short of breath, felt heartburn and her ankles, fingers and face were swelling. It was then when she felt her baby move inside her belly and her breasts were starting to leak a white substance.<br />
„Oh, this is wonderful!“ the teacher exclaimed. „Do you see the substance leaking from her breasts? This is colostrum. This appears between week 29 and 40.“<br />
Miss Carlsen was getting excited. There was so much she wanted to show to her students, but as the bell rang, biology class had been brought to an end, right before Mei was about to deliver.<br />
„All right, please read the chapter about pregnancy and birth in your text-books. Nest week we will pick up where we left today.“<br />
The students were leaving the class-room, many of them in deep conversation. The lesson had been a success.<br />
„Mei?“ Miss Carlsen turned towards the pregnant bimbo-slut. „I expect you to join us next week when we are going to study the process of birth.“ The teacher then turned around, picked up her books and bags and left the classroom. Mei was still on the front desk, spread out like a chicken that had been plucked and made ready for the butcher. Mei was trying to catch her breath. Her own body-weight made it difficult for her to move. She was weeping due to pain and disappointment. She had lost two hours and had achieved next to nothing.</p>
