<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">James got off the bus already wearing the glove and anticipating what he wanted to do with it. Brad Mitchell was a very popular senior who was on the football team and apparently good at it. James didn&#39;t care much for sports and didn&#39;t understand the fanaticism it drew but he did understand that Brad&#39;s physique and masculinity exuded capability, and that was something James wanted.<br />
<br />
Yes, there were a few times it felt like James was picked on by Brad. Like the time in Bio when James accidentally read ahead and helped move the class along by answering the question the teacher asked but hadn&#39;t covered. Brad *coughed* calling him a nerd, making the entire class laugh at him. The subsequent gym classes where they were playing dodgeball and Brad made sure the &quot;weak links&quot; were picked off first so the &quot;real men&quot; can have a game. However, James didn&#39;t make this decision for those reasons, more so for the fact that Brad was gifted in the expression of his secondary sexual characteristics, meaning he at 18, could probably pass for 21, and he was extroverted. There have been hushed whispers of him getting the booze for countless parties, none of which James heard of beforehand.<br />
<br />
Last semester, before winter break, Brad would hang out with his friends and teammates before classes began, in front of the library. James assumed they would still dominate the benches there. James was right. Most of the football team if not all, James wouldn&#39;t know, was there along with some really attractive senior girls, probably cheerleaders. Brad was in the center of the crowd, no surprise, and they were all talking about the new phones, computers, tablets, and in some cases, vehicles or vehicle accessories they got. <br />
<br />
James was able to wiggle his way through the crowd, being mostly invisible to these people as he is just a freshmen. He could feel the adrenaline pumping through him as he got next to Brad. Once there James froze, he had to think of what he wanted Brad to become and what specific aspects he wanted to take. With the adrenaline going he could barely breathe, let alone concentrate enough to remember his well thought out plan. He wanted so much from Brad but wanted to make sure he didn&#39;t take certain less wholesome aspects of his personality. Build, that was one obvious thing. Umm, popularity? No, that was something other people gave him for a reason, but what was that reason? James admired his ability to grow a beard, that was totally cool, though his dad&#39;s was cooler. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Kid. What-er ya doin&#39; here?&quot;, James was interrupted mid thought. He looked up to see that Brad noticed his presence. James was suddenly on the spot and the rest of the group was stopping their conversations to look at them. In that moment all James could think about was how intimidating Brad is. He was a foot or so taller and was built like an adult, as he essentially was one. James in his panic, retreated to thoughts he was comfortable with, and questioned how much it must take to feed Brad, and reasoned that he must snack constantly.<br />
<br />
James felt the glove activate and he swung his arm out and patted Brad on the shoulder, &quot;We had bio together, I hope you had a good Christm...&quot; There was a blinding flash from the glove and the world seemed to retch for a second.<br />
<br />
Before James knew it Brad was gone and the conversations around him continued as though they never stopped. James excused himself out of the crowd catching a few awkward glances and went to the bathroom, confused and nearly sick to his stomach. James put his hands on his knees and bent over breathing heavily only to realize he was holding a colorful box in his gloved hand.<br />
<br />
James looked at the box, suddenly feeling its ample weight. &quot;Bradley Mitchell Protein Bites&quot;, complete with his face all over the package and a slogan &quot;Let the real men play!&quot; James had set the inanimated people to still be conscious, but to feel immense pleasure and euphoria when consumed, and their new life goal would be to help James become better. Over break it seemed like poetic justice and a twisted kindness to make this the case. As James realized Brad was probably silently screaming to be devoured by James, or anyone for that matter, he ran into a stall and threw up. He had just destroyed a life. All this person&#39;s potential, suddenly squeezed into a few food bites to be digested. Somehow he knew this would be the result, but it didn&#39;t seem real until this moment of moral clarity. After several minutes of staring at his breakfast in the toilet and feeling a deep sense of emptiness, the bell rang and he needed to head to class. James decided to try to return Brad to his old self tonight. His empty stomach turned as he shoved Brad into his backpack.<br />
<br />
Several classes later, James was famished and still several hours from lunch. He may not be the hulking beast of power and masculinity that Brad was, but he was still a teen male and essentially didn&#39;t get food since last nights dinner. He eyed the Brad Bites hungrily, &quot;It wouldn&#39;t really hurt if I ate some of Brad. The chronivac can make him whole even if I don&#39;t have all the pieces.&quot; he reasoned pulling one of the 10 individually wrapped packages from the box.<br />
<br />
The first thing James thought of was how heavy Brad still was. Glancing at the box, the net weight was 5 lbs although the box was the size of a box of granola bars. James had no fear of eating all of Brad as he couldn&#39;t consume that much food without getting sick. Each bag was half a pound and one would replace the breakfast he lost. He opened the pouch and realized that he wasn&#39;t all that sure what the effects of using Brad would be. He was very stressed when the glove activated and had a number of thoughts racing through his head but he was famished.<br />
<br />
James sniffed the contents of the pouch and it smelled chocolatey and something else. If James had been into bodybuilding he would recognize the smell as protein powder, but he wasn&#39;t, so he cautiously pulled out a ball shaped glob and put it in his mouth, tasting it before biting. As his tongue began dissolving the candy coating Brad&#39;s voice was suddenly in his head, &quot;Oh wow, Finally! This is the best feeling ever!&quot; James froze having forgotten about the telepathic link they would share while he was using his victims in their intended capacity. &quot;Oh no, please don&#39;t stop! This is amazing, its like a massage! I can feel myself loosening up, its great!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Brad, you aren&#39;t getting a massage, you are being eaten.&quot; Was all James could think to say. In hindsight James realized that it isn&#39;t smart to panic your food as you consume it, but much to his surprise, Brad replied,<br />
&quot;You should totally try it man, its sooo relaxing!&quot; <br />
James moved the morsel with his tongue and Brad interrupted excitedly, &quot;There, right there!&quot;<br />
&quot;What?&quot;, James asked.<br />
&quot;Please, apply pressure right where you are, squeeze.&quot;<br />
James, without thinking of what he was actually doing, complied. He squished the ball with his tongue against the roof of his mouth and was greeted with a chocolate peanut butter core that was amazing in how delicious it could taste.<br />
&quot;Ohhhmmmyy god&quot; Brad&#39;s voice reacted.<br />
James instinctively continued chewing.<br />
&quot;Oh man, I can literally feel all my stress fading away, do it again, please. That was the best I ever felt.&quot; Brad begged.</p>
