<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Carla was very wary about going to Sunrise Research for any therapeutic testing, considering of what she had heard about the company’s reputation. They entered through two rollback pocket all glass doors that suggested to Carla as to the wealth of the company. Inside the front lobby a woman sat behind a high set desk, to where she had to lean forward to talk to anyone entering. <br />
<br />
“Hello, we are here to see Jerry in the laboratory, I’m a friend of Jerry and my friend here came in for having some medical tests.” Jen said, and sounded as overly bold to a worried Carla.<br />
<br />
“Jerry you say, and you had an appointment you said, hmm, I don’t see any appointments on my daily ledger, are you sure it was today?” The snide acting secretary said to Jennifer.<br />
<br />
“Call Jerry, he is at extension 221 if you please!” Jen said, as it was easy to tell her disdain for being treated as though she was a fool.<br />
<br />
“Extension… 2-2-1,” the secretary repeated as she placed her phone call. “Gerald Beaker, yes this is Anna at the front office, I have here two young ladies wishing to see you about some medical tests, ah-ha, do they have proper authorization, did you check with Professor Haun, well okay, but this special tour of the facilities shall be reported; good day!” The snobby secretary said as she spoke to Jerry.<br />
<br />
“Here, these are two yellow guest tags, be sure to wear them where they can easily be recognized!” The secretary so said, as she flicked them off her high desk to have Jen grab one and Carla had to pick hers up off the lobby floor.<br />
<br />
A mechanically operated door slid open and the girls walked inside the facility. They walked along a long hallway, it had many doors, but all the doors were to the right side of the hall. As they walked the hall was quite quiet, just the sound of rushing air conditioned air pouring from ceiling vents. Jen seemed to know where she was leading Carla, as she seemed more interested with trying to window peek inside the many rooms they were walking past.<br />
<br />
As halfway along the hallway they heard someone yelling, a door was jolted as though something heavy was slammed into it from within one of the offices to the right side of the hall. “No you won’t not me, no, you keep away with that syringe, I never signed up for anything like your associate said would happen, no, no, please no…,” a man yelled, and as the last his cries faded to silence, this happened just as the girls heard a scurry of footsteps from behind the door tagged as “Orientation Room.”<br />
<br />
“What did I tell you about this place,” Carla said to Jen as she marched onward toward the laboratory.<br />
<br />
The girls were twenty feet past the orientation room door when it swung open and a man dressed in a white hospital jacket and black slacks stood in the doorway, and said, “Get him to a T cell, strap him securely, I want no chance of him getting loose you understand me? Oh and have a janitor clean up this mess, and you got a big mouth, as it will get you into trouble with upper management, so you beware from here and on!” The gruff sounding man said to someone else inside the room. As then the man walked out into the hallway he stopped, as turned around and looked at Jen with Carla.<br />
<br />
“Guests, guests, just what we needed was witnesses!” He said, as turning, he proceeded walking along the hall in the opposite direction as to where Jen and Carla were heading.<br />
<br />
“Let’s get out of here, as can’t you see this place is a devil’s dungeon?” Carla said as pleading to leave, as for Jen to take her home.<br />
<br />
“Oh don’t be a cry baby, the Lab entrance is just ahead.” Jen said, she acting as of what they had heard was none of her business.<br />
<br />
As the girls came to the door tagged as Laboratory, Jen knocked and then walked inside, while Carla followed, she acting as timid.<br />
<br />
“Jerry you botched the cervine tests, now then, I want you to go to barn seven and get new blood samples, while I wait here,” said another man, he too wearing a doctor’s outfit. He heard someone enter the Lab and when he saw the two girls, he smiled, as Jerry seeing, he knowing Jennifer, gave her a worried look, as if she should come back another time.<br />
<br />
“Guests, well greetings, ah where is your tour guide? Gerald, are these two girls here to see you, do they have proper authorization, yes I can see their guest tags, but that is not what I asked. Oh never mind them, I shall give them a quick tour, while you gather the blood samples.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, I am Doctor Byle, and you are,” the doctor said, as Jen replied, “I called Jerry, as my friend here was attacked and molested by a bull. She, ah she ingested several orgasmic loads of bull semen, and Jerry when asked, offered to do a blood testing to check if the semen had any ill effects.”<br />
<br />
“Bull semen, molested, ah…, she looks to be all neat and proper, when did the attack happen?” The doc asked of either girl.<br />
<br />
“Yesterday, and it was horrid, the damn bull was in his pasture, he charged and knocked me down, as lying thrown over a tree trunk log, where he mounted the log and first mated with me vaginally, as he or it, walked around the log and proceeded to mount, inserted his cock inside my mouth, as with me pinned down he shot in seven mighty loads, as it made me sick, but try as I did, I could not puke.” Carla said, as Jen stood there shaking her head, she had never heard such a pack of lies come from her friend.<br />
<br />
“Really, and where did this happen?” the Doctor asked, as he offered a concerned sort of smile.<br />
<br />
“The Killingsworth farm, I was there visiting a friend,” Carla lying did reply.<br />
<br />
“John Killingsworth’s farm, did you inform John or his son about the attack?” The inquisitive Doctor so asked of Carla, while totally ignoring as to Jen being there.<br />
<br />
“No, I didn’t, I was too embarrassed, why?” Carla asked, as she looked at Jen, seeing her as having turned her back at Carla, as Jen appeared to be laughing.<br />
<br />
“Excuse me, but are you laughing,” the Doctor asked of Jen.<br />
<br />
“Oh, but how she tells of her mishap is more than funny, as miss goody two-shoes here would not let Jerry have sex with her, but let a bull do her front and back.” Jen said, she with a smirk as she suggested her friend was an animal loving whore.</p>
