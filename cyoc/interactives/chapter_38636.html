<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><P>As you walk through the aisles, you have trouble deciding on what costume to pick out. Your first thought was to go with a Dracula costume, but you worry that it would turn you into a real vampire. Sucking people's blood wouldn't go over too well at the party.
<P>After a few minutes, you see the store clerk return, holding some kind of costume. It's folded in her arms, so you can't make out the shape or type. Whatever it is, there are a lot of jewels and glittery fabric involved.
<P>"I know you wanted a costume of the male persuasion, but I was kind of hoping you'd consider this one." You can tell she's blushing as she talks.
<P>"Yeah, I would like to stay a guy," you say. Still, you're curious as to what the woman is getting at. "What is that?"
<P>The woman lowers one arm to let the fabric fall, continuing to hold the hanger it's attached to with the other hand. Your eyes widen as they behold a very fancy and very skimpy exotic dancer costume. The bra is actually a pair of golden, jeweled cups on thin gold chains. Purple tassels dangle from their centers. A partly transparent purple sash hangs from the front of a jeweled waistband. A plastic bag hanging behind the costume holds other jewelry and items including sparkly gold slippers.
<P>"It's a bedlah. For belly dancing. I think you'd look great in it."
<P>You wonder if she's for real. She's giving you a strange look, as if she's swallowing a mouthful of embarrassment just asking you to wear this thing. You try to picture yourself in it. If any girl was wearing that, you know you'd be turned on in half a second. But this is your own female body you're considering.
<P>"It looks real nice," you say, trying to decline as gently as possible. "But I just don't have the money..."
<P>"We have a special this week; buy two get one free. If you go ahead and purchase another male costume for your party, you won't have to pay for this one."
<P>Now your interest is piqued. You'd like to see yourself in it, just for fun. And as long as it doesn't cost you anything, what's the downside?
<P>You take the costume from the woman. "I'd better try it first. Make sure I want it."
<P>"Feel free to open the package. I won't hold you to the purchase if you're still unsatisfied." Something about her voice hints that she doubts you would be.
<P>In the dressing room, you remove the items from the hanger and open the plastic pouch. As expected, there is no bra, but you do find a light purple g-string. It suddenly dawns on you just how exposed your body is going to be in this costume. You're about to consider forgetting all about it when you notice your clothes feel tight.
<P>You gasp. You completely forgot that removing the costume from the hanger would start the change. You see in the mirror that you're becoming a little bigger. Your breasts are putting a strain on your bra, and your waist is threatening to bust out of your skirt. You quickly, and with great effort, unzip your skirt and shimmy out of it. You unbutton the tight buttons of the blouse and throw it off. The bra is much harder, as the clasp is digging into your back. You finally get it off, bringing immense relief to your larger bosom.
<P>As you step out of your skirt and sit down on the bench to remove your shoes, you realize the changes are still taking place. As you work on undoing the buckles, hair starts to dip into your peripheral vision. You kick off your shoes and pull off your stockings and panties.
<P>Standing once more, you feel your full breasts jiggle against your chest. Your image has matured into a twenty-something woman with a hint of a tan, full hips, and smooth black waist-length hair. Your stomach and waistline sport a healthy bit of fat which is sure to come in handy in a dance session.
<P>If you looked cute in your schoolgirl form, you're a knockout now. For a moment, you think about putting the school uniform back on its hangar and taking it off again, to get back to where you were, but you can't take your eyes off the beautiful woman in the mirror.
<P>You reach for the thong and slip it on. Then you take the gold cups and string the chains around to your back. They barely cover a third of your breasts, but that's all the support they seem to need while still being free to bounce. You remember that you have a body that was intentionally built for this outfit. The tassels at the cups' "nipples" shake with even the slightest jiggle of your breasts.
<P>The next thing to put on is the belt. It's thick, V-shaped down the front, with gold and silver metalwork. Red and purple jewels are encrusted all over it. It hugs you tightly, making your waist and stomach puff out attractively. Hanging from the front and the back are the purple semi-transparent bands of fabric, hanging all the way down to your ankles. On top of these, three-to-five-inch strings of red beads dangle from the belt.
<P>Your outer hips are still bare, as are your legs. This is obviously the kind of outfit designed to tease onlookers, offering only the bare essentials of concealment. You're glad you're wearing a thong under it, even if it's only a g-string.
<P>You put on the slippers. They're very comfortable and made of a shiny gold material with slightly pointed toes. You examine yourself in the mirror and feel a wave of pleasure. It's not exactly arousal. It feels more like a sense of satisfaction, and expectation. You think about others seeing you in this, and you feel somewhat excited. You know that you should be feeling extremely exposed. Ten minutes ago you'd only consider wearing this among friends who know you, but now for some reason the thought of walking through the mall like this with strangers ogling you doesn't seem half bad. It must be the magic. It made you walk and act girlish before, and now it's adjusting your mind to feel comfortable in this outfit. You're a little disturbed that it's messing with you like that, but at the same time you're relieved not to feel the intense nervousness that this level of exposure would have brought on.
<P>You're still in the privacy of the changing room, however, with your original clothes to change back into. At the moment you don't need to feel too concerned about the public. You turn your attention back to the accessories from the bag.
<P>The remaining items are optional jewelry, but you figure it's best to try everything as long as you've come this far. In the back of your mind, you hope you'll look even better with all of them on.
<P>There are a pair of silver arm bands that you slip onto your forearms. They're tight enough to stay where they are. Next you find several gold and silver bracelets. You put four on your left wrist and six on your right. Some are sculpted in a twist, but most are plain traditional metal bracelets. In the pouch are also three rings. You put a gold ring with a ruby on your right ring finger, a plain silver ring on your right index finger, and a gold ring with a sapphire on your left ring finder. You also notice that your fingernails have light purple nail polish, though they haven't grown longer.
<P>You put on a beautiful gold necklace. It consists of two thin bands that hang around your neck, connected to each other by short chains every two inches. A big red ruby is held by the center chain between the top and bottom bands. The bottom band also has chains with little red beads hanging from it at intervals, matching those on the belt. The entire thing rests coolly on your chest, the middle three beaded chains gently slipping into your cleavage.
<P>You then see another small necklace that you realize is a forehead ornament, like a tiara. You wrap the gold chain across your head. Little beads dangle from it, with a large purple jewel shaped like a teardrop in the center. You also have a pair of matching purple jeweled earrings that you then poke into your magically-pierced ears.
<P>Next, you pick up a face veil. It's made of the same thin purple fabric as the drapes barely covering the space between your legs. You place it just over your nose and tie it behind your head, underneath your long hair. The veil hangs seductively, partly masking your cheeks and mouth. It hangs down several inches from your chin.
<P>The only things left are four tiny brass cymbals. These have little red ties to attach to your fingers. You almost decide not to bother with them, but a teasing voice in your head forces you to reconsider. You carefully put them on your thumbs and middle fingers.
<P>The lovely image of a belly dancer greets you in the mirror. Her beautiful body and skimpy but ornate bedlah radiates a mysterious aura of allure. You feel sexy. Really sexy. You almost chuckle at the thought. Sex appeal was never something you were often concerned about. As a guy, the rules were different. Now, standing in this room with this body and barely concealing costume, you feel a need to be the center of attention and adoration.
<P>This kind of confidence is like nothing you've experienced before. You barely think twice before opening the door and stepping back out into the main store area. Your body feels loose and limber. You keep your arms to your sides as you walk, fingers spread open. You wiggle your hips and torso seductively, exerting surprising dexterity. The purple fabric, all the beaded strings hanging from you, and your black hair sway in rhythm with your movements. It's a strut that's sure to turn any guy's head...and maybe even some women.
<P>You scan the aisles for the woman, eager to show her the results of the costume she picked out.</p>
