<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Melissa was afraid, afraid of what her friend was going to do to her, knowing that she had unleashed a rabid dog. She ran, like a mice fleeing a swooping hawk. There bodies were changing muscles started to grow, both soon had rock hard abs as small black hairs began curling out of every pore of their skin skin. Pushing and twisting outwards, they made a strange noise as they rubbed together. The hairs on Erika grew longer and<br />
longer covering her arms from her wrist all the way up to under the sleaves of her shirt which were already starting to tear from the<br />
<br />
Her teeth were now almost a half inch long and still growing. Melissa tried to turn &quot;NO!&quot; she shirked but Erika bit her on the tongue. A flash of defiance became a flicker of hope. <br />
<br />
&quot;No...I...no&quot; Melissa begged.<br />
<br />
She tried to deflect Erika by sucking her off, she&#39;d swallow to if it was necessary to stop her mutant friend. Erika was reading Melissa&#39;s mind, she turned her friend, bitch now, around being her friend over. Melissa screamed for help but parents with prams walked past the door without a second glance, the Salve was creating a cone of silence around them. <br />
<br />
The tail was starting to grow on Melissa, as were her extra nipples but Erika looked more like a Beast, Creature the Werewolf. <br />
<br />
 In seconds she had the thick black bush of a 15 year old woman, but the hairs kept growing, meeting up with the hair that had flowed down her sides and stomach, covering her entire torso with deep thick hair. Erika <br />
watched as her legs grew heavy with muscles and hair. The hair pushed out, flowing down the front of her legs and her muscles bulked up, easily making her look like a body builder. With some effort Erika could see that her feet were also changing, her toenails were cracking as claws pushed out, long and sharp just like her fingernails. Her feet started to shift, making her have to lean onto the counter to stay balanced. In seconds, her feet had grown a foot longer than normal and the bottom of her toes had thickened into tough leathery padding, so that she was only able to stand on her tiptoes. It was such an odd feeling for Erika who watched in total amazement, drooling from the incredible ecstasy the transformation was giving her.<br />
<br />
A great feeling of pressure suddenly arose in Erika&#39;s back, and she had to lean forward over the sink. Though she couldn&#39;t really see so well in the mirror, she felt her back push up and out, muscles forming under her skin and then bulking up as the wave of pressure moved down her back. She could feel her spine pushing up and she heard the creaks and cracks as her bones moved the strain of which finally ripped the remains of her t-shirt off of her, falling in tatters to the floor. She felt the pressure reach her ass and could hear a ripping sound, a tail was forming at the base of her spine. Erika moaned and could only stare as a long bush of hair grew out almost touching the floor. The hair curled out of her back and covered the tail with even more fur giving it a long bushy appearance. Within seconds she felt the pressure on her back subside and a new pressure start in her head.<br />
<br />
Erika quickly looked into the mirror and watched as her jawline moved on it&#39;s own. She could see and feel the bones in her face moving forward, starting to stretch the skin of her face. She watched as her nose darkened and widened, her teeth grew even longer and became sharper as her entire face pushed forward with the sound of cracking bones filling her new large wolf ears. Erika watched in both horror and amazement as her nose pushed out, her jawline growing longer and longer. Her skin stretched and pulsated, her muscles<br />
shifted and her bones cracked as her face continued to push forward. In seconds, she had a long wolf&#39;s muzzle and the last of the<br />
<br />
black hair spread quickly around her cheeks and a short fine pelt of fur ran down her nose, covering her completely with fur from head to toe. Erika watched as her normally green eyes hazed over turning into a rich golden yellow, like those of a wolf. At first this scared her, as usually in the movies the eye color change meant the wolf took over, but Erika didn&#39;t feel any different emotionally or mentally, at least not yet.<br />
<br />
She pinned Melissa to the ground with one talon hand, forcing her head down she presented her Melissa&#39;s ass to her. With a foot long dick she guided herself into Melissa&#39;s vagina. She cried out in pain as 12 inches of furry wolf&#39;s dick found her hymen. Melissa felt pain but caught in her own transformation, into a German Shepard Bitch, she lost her own pain. As Erika ejaculated the cum flowing straight into Melissa&#39;s unprotected womb was hot and thick with enough pressure to send Melissa flying off her like a deflating balloon. <br />
<br />
Keeping her pinned Melissa had to endure the knowledge that she was pregnant and she was Erika&#39;s bitch.</p>
