<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Fido raced through the streets to the edge of town as quickly as he could. He had hoped to avoid further detection by people and a recapture by the dreaded dog catcher. Fortunately, he managed to find a way of avoiding both and got out of town in what seemed like no time at all. Although night had fallen during his run and there weren’t many lights in this part of the neighborhood by the time he arrived, Fido managed to use his strong sense of smell and hearing to track down the old, abandoned house. <br />
<br />
When he reached the block where the old house stood, the dog stood quietly and looked up at it. Taking a sniff of the air with his nose, Fido determined that the stray bitch had been correct and that there was, in fact, a rotting corpse somewhere inside the house. Freddy thought it was weird that he hadn&#39;t noticed it the last time he was here. He thought to tell someone about it, but then decided against it. The police would question how he knew there was a body buried in there and would suspect him of being responsible for murder, if that is how that person ended up dying. Deciding against saying anything later, Fido slowly trotted up to the house and approached it cautiously. When he got there, Fido carefully listened out for any signs of noise coming from inside the house.<br />
<br />
“It sounds totally deserted in there” Freddy thought to himself, as he whimpered quietly.<br />
<br />
Fido proceeded to trot into the back of house, where Michael had masturbated him into human form on Friday night. The place still gave Freddy the creeps and Fido shuddered and began to shake. Cautiously, he made his way to the overgrown backyard. Continuing to look around for any signs of his boyfriend, Sofya and the wizard, Fido peered into a back window that looked into the kitchen. He saw an old, worn out room with lots of dust on the counter tops. A broken chair was placed next to an old table with a plaid table cloth placed upon it. <br />
<br />
“This place seems like it’s straight out of the 50’s” Freddy thought to himself. “The 1950’s.”<br />
<br />
While this was unlikely, Freddy determined that he might want to go inside to see if the wizard was hiding in there. Making his way to the back door, Fido jumped up, took his paws and placed them on the doorknob. He turned it, but unfortunately for him, the knob came off the door when he struggled to move it. Whimpering loudly, Fido hopped back down and looked at the now fallen door knob on the grass below.<br />
<br />
“Great” Freddy thought to himself. “Now I have no way in. Or do I?”<br />
<br />
Fido trotted back to the front of the house, looking around carefully to be sure there weren’t neighbors around to watch him. When he thought the coast was clear, Fido made his way to the front door, hopped up and attempted to turn it. <br />
<br />
“It’s locked” Freddy determined, as Fido whimpered again and hopped back down to the ground.<br />
<br />
Making his way back to the backyard, Fido laid in the grass and Freddy thought for a moment. <br />
<br />
“I can’t get in this stupid old house, even though Michael might be in there. The front door is locked, which indicates that the wizard might be in there, though I don’t hear or smell anyone around.”<br />
<br />
Before he could think of anything else, Fido heard a voice call to him in his thoughts. <br />
<br />
“Freddy” the voice said. <br />
<br />
“Who said that?” Freddy thought to himself, as Fido barked loudly. “Oops, probably should be quieter. Don’t want to get spotted by any of the neighbors here.”<br />
<br />
“Freddy” the voice called to him again. “Close your eyes.”<br />
<br />
Thinking this request was strange, Fido reluctantly closed his eyes and began to see an image appear in his mind. In a room filled with wooded walls, he could see the image of two teenagers tied up to chairs.<br />
<br />
“That must be Michael and Sofya” Freddy thought to himself. <br />
<br />
Freddy could see a cauldron bubbling up behind them. When he tried to take a look at the man standing next to it, he freaked out. The image of the wizard appeared menacingly in his head and a chuckle could be heard in his ears. Fido barked loudly, as he woke up from his vision. When he closed his eyes again, the images were gone.<br />
<br />
“Shit” Freddy thought to himself. “Come back. I want to see where they were.”<br />
<br />
Despite his best efforts, Fido was not able to get the images to return to him. Seeing this as a clue, though, Freddy made some determinations. <br />
<br />
“I don’t how I got those images into my head, but they definitely narrow down where Michael and Sofya might be. I know for a fact that this old house here doesn’t have any rooms that look like that. Michael showed me pictures of the interior once and no room had that kind of aesthetic. Plus, I would have smelled the smoke coming from the house if they were actually here. That means….”<br />
<br />
Fido looked to the woods, as a thought popped into Freddy’s head. <br />
<br />
“That must mean they are hiding in the woods somewhere. Maybe they are in one of those cabins by the lake.”<br />
<br />
Hurriedly, Fido got up, with some effort, and proceeded to run from the backyard back onto the street. From there, he turned a corner and began to make his way to the woods. Though the path was perilous, with reports of mountain lions and bears, Fido had to chance it. It was the only way to rescue his boyfriend and Sofya. <br />
<br />
Passing through the wooded areas, Fido began to pick up a scent. When he sniffed at it more, he could tell it was the pheromones coming off of Sofya. Seeing his penis begin to emerge again from his sheath, Fido whimpered and Freddy began to panic. <br />
<br />
“Oh man” he thought to himself. “That’s definitely Sofya, but now I have to run with this thing dangling between my legs. Hopefully, I can ignore it for now so I can get to wherever they are without any distraction.”<br />
<br />
Fido continued to run, as his penis dangled in the air, making him extremely uncomfortable. Finally, as the woods became darker and more eery than before, Fido could smell strong scents hit his nose. He could smell a lot of animal manure. <br />
<br />
“Yuck” Freddy thought to himself. <br />
<br />
He could smell the dew coming off of the large sycamore trees. <br />
<br />
“Pleasant smell” Freddy thought to himself.<br />
<br />
Finally, after what seemed like ages, the cool scents from the lake began to waft onto his nose. Sofya’s scent became stronger too, as Fido began to approach the area where the cabins were built. Despite feeling tired, Fido kept going, knowing that time was of the essence.<br />
<br />
After passing by a few cabins and not getting a sense that they were in there, Freddy began to think that he had gone the wrong way. Suddenly, his senses immediately began to tingle around one cabin in particular. <br />
<br />
“That must be them” Freddy thought to himself. <br />
<br />
When Fido approached the cabin, he could smell the smoke coming out of the chimney. <br />
<br />
“This has to be the place” Freddy thought to himself. <br />
<br />
Fido trotted up to the cabin to get a closer look.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile…..</p>
