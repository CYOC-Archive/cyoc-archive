<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">John then heard a knock on the door so he scooted back up to his desk so his massive cock was hidden under his desk.<br />
“Come in” he said curious who was on the other side of the door.  George the football coach opened the door gingerly and came in.<br />
“Hey John, I just came in to check with you about the schedule for the field for football practice.  The soccer players have been running over their practice time and its really eating into my guys time to run plays.  I tried to talk to the coach but she just looked at me and rolled her eye.  I know you are in charge of the …”<br />
George just kept going on and on as John had a great idea.  He looked George up and down.  George was in his mid forties around 6’2”.  It was apparent that at some point George had played football which is why he was the coach but he had let himself go.  He looked around 240 lbs but most of it was in his ass and in his gut.  John also took stock of what the coach was wearing.  He had on coach polo on with loose fitting dress pants, the perfect solution to John’s problem.<br />
John pulled out the laptop as George continued to whine about his problem and loaded up the Chronivac.  “Hey are you even listening,” George interrupted as John looked through the options on the program.  <br />
“Yah, yah, I’m just um checking the schedule on my computer to see if I can move things around.  Now what days were the ones you were worried about?”  John replied flippantly as the Chronivac finished initiating.<br />
George continued to babble on as John started to type into his computer, ‘I have the ability to swap any body part of my desire with any person I shake hands with and nobody except me will notice the change’.  John pressed accept and looked up to a very stern look on George’s face.<br />
“Now I’ve looked at the schedule and I will contact the George and I will contact Irene and make sure that she gets her players off the field at the right time.  Is there anything else you needed?” John stated succinctly as he looked at George.”<br />
“Um, I guess not, Thanks John,” George Replied.<br />
“No, thank you, and have a nice practice,” John smiled and reached out his hand from his desk.  George politely reached out and shook hands with John.  John thought of swapping his massive dick with George while they shook hands and a slight spark between them caused <br />
“That was weird, I guess I’ll see you later,” George said as he walked back out the door.  John looked down and his massive bulge was gone.  He stood up and pulled down his shorts and looked down, his cock was only about 3” soft.  Looking at it relief struck him, but with relief came blood flow to his cock.  John felt as though he was gonna get an erection, but his cock didn’t get hard.<br />
Instead John felt his prostate pulse.  Damn, with Georges cock, John must have also gotten all of George’s downstairs parts.  The more John explored his new cock and balls and prostate the hornier he got.  He slowly reached down and his hand instinctively went passed his cock and balls and to his prostate.  ‘Is this what George liked?’  he thought as he spread his legs further apart to finger his prostate harder.  After a few minutes his new cock started to get hard and it was only 5” long.  John then sat back in his chair and put his legs up.  He picked up the flashlight off his desk and started to stroke his cock.  He pressed the button and his flesh light became normal sized again.  He spit on his cock and moved the flesh light toward his cock.  He hesitated as he moved the flesh light over his cock and as his head hit the lips of the flesh light he could feel his cockhead on his hole.<br />
The more his brushed his cock against his hole the harder his cock got and finally gave in to what his body.  John pushed his cock into the flesh light and moaned as he started to fuck his own hole.  The further his cock pushed in the better it felt.  The further in John fucked himself the more he moaned and groaned and the faster he went.  The cock inside him felt so good that he started to buck his hips.  <br />
Finally John couldn’t hold back and his new cock burst inside him.  He huffed and caught his breath; a double orgasm really took its toll.  He pulled his new cock out of the flesh light and pushed the button shrunk it down realizing that he needed to get to class.  He stood up and felt a cold drip of liquid down his leg.  He looked down and realized that his cum was running down his own leg.<br />
He took his jockstrap and used the pouch to clean up his legs and his hole then pulled it over his new more manageable cock.  Then he slipped on his shorts, sock shoes and put on his whistle.  As he grabbed his clipboard and headed back out to the gym he thought to himself, ‘wow does George really get fucked like that, by guys?, by girls?’ so many things went through his head.  ‘that felt like that with only 5 inches how did the principle feel with my massive cock in him earlier?’<br />
John closed the Chronivac and put it away.  Then went out to the gym and to the kids that were all ready and waiting.  ‘What should I do next?’ John thought about the Chronivac as he started to call roll…</p>
