<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alice doesn&#39;t feel anything anymore. No thoughts, no feelings, no emotions, no personality. She is just a game console with a touch display on her surface. The game console can&#39;t even feel its own body. It can only experience pleasure when Jake operates it. But even this is not something it can think about or process in any way. It&#39;s just pure pleasure. And it can&#39;t even experience this pleasure until Jake operates it.<br />
Jake looks at Alice and what she has become and smiles. He can&#39;t wait to play with this game console. He picks it up and looks at its touch display. He sees a puzzle on it, a picture of a naked woman. He looks more closely at the randomly arranged pieces and realizes that the puzzle is a picture of Alice. He likes that. He knows that he has to solve this puzzle in time to make the console orgasm. He starts to move the pieces around, trying to form the picture again. As he moves the pieces, he can see that the display shows a timer that started at three minutes and is now counting down the seconds. And every time he moves a part, he hears a kind of whimpering from the speaker, because in the console, moving the parts causes a gentle, pleasant feeling.<br />
Jake smiles as he hears the whimpering. He knows that the console is feeling pleasure when he moves the pieces. He continues to move the pieces around, trying to solve the puzzle. As he moves the pieces, the whimpering gets louder and more intense. Jake can see that the timer is still counting down, but he&#39;s making good progress on the puzzle. He&#39;s determined to solve it in time and make the console orgasm. He moves the pieces faster and faster, his fingers flying across the display. The whimpering gets louder and more intense, and Jake can feel his excitement growing. He&#39;s almost there, he can see the picture starting to form. With one final move, he solves the puzzle, and the display shows a complete picture of Alice. The timer stops at 1:45, and Jake hears a loud, intense moan from the speaker. He knows that the console has orgasmed. This was not bad, but he can do better. And he has to do better three times in a row otherwise he would have to wait before he can transform this game console back into Alice.<br />
Jake takes a deep breath and starts to solve the next puzzle. From the console’s perspective, nothing has changed. It is still just pure pleasure. Jake moves the pieces around, trying to solve the puzzle again. As he moves the pieces, the whimpering starts again, and Jake can see the timer counting down. He&#39;s determined to solve the puzzle faster this time. Like the first time, with one final move, he solves the puzzle, and the display shows a complete picture of Alice. The timer stops at 1:20 and Jake hears a horny moan from the speaker. But this time it is not as loud and intense as the first time. Sure, he was slower. A little frustrated but full of confidence, he sets about solving the next puzzle.<br />
Jake moves the pieces of the next around, trying to solve it faster than the last time. As he moves the pieces, the whimpering starts again, and Jake can see the timer counting down. He&#39;s determined to solve the puzzle in less than a minute. He moves the pieces faster and faster. This puzzle seems easier than the one&#39;s before and finally the display shows a complete picture of Alice. The timer stops at 2:03, and Jake hears an extremely loud, intense moan from the speaker. He knows that he has solved the puzzle fast enough the first time. &quot;Two more times and I&#39;ll have unlocked the Alice feature,&quot; laughs Jake, meaning that he can then transform the console back into his partner. But he doesn&#39;t have to do that right away. He could still play with it for a bit and then transform it into Alice when he&#39;s tired of the puzzle game. Or keep on playing until the set time limit is over - what he would do anyway if he can&#39;t solve the puzzle fast enough three times in a row.<br />
Very self-confident starts Jake to solve the next puzzle. He moves the pieces around, trying to solve it faster than the last time. The whimpering starts again as he moves the pieces, and Jake can see the timer counting down. He&#39;s determined to solve it as fast as possible. But somehow he has problems. The seconds tick away and he cannot get this one piece to the right place. Meanwhile, the first minute is long over and the second minute is almost over. Then he realizes the problem: he should have started completely differently. He quickly tries to get the pieces back to how they were at the beginning, the whimpering from the loudspeaker is the accompanying melody, and then the time has run out before he has solved the puzzle. The console just makes a pleased sound, similar to a pleasant hum. Jake looks at the display and that shows just a jumbled mess of pieces. &quot;Damn, now I&#39;m back to square one!&quot; He has to smile at himself. The game really does trigger his ambition. He hopes that the console, which is actually Alice, will also benefit from it.<br />
&quot;OK, don&#39;t give up!&quot; Jake says to himself and wants to solve the upcoming puzzle faster than the last time. This time he takes a different approach that seems to work. The whimpering gets louder and more intense, and Jake can feel his excitement growing. He&#39;s almost there, he can see the picture starting to form. And then the display shows a complete picture of Alice. The timer stops at 2:18, and Jake hears a loud, intense moan from the speaker.<br />
He manages it quickly enough the next time and hears the console experiencing another intense climax. He faces the next task with great excitement. His hands are a little sweaty and he can feel his heart beating. But this time too he manages it quickly enough. Even faster than the other two times. The console screams with pleasure. Yes, now he has done it and he has unlocked the possibility of transforming Alice back.<br />
Jake puts the console down on the bed and takes a deep breath. He&#39;s excited and relieved that he was able to solve the puzzle three times in a row. He looks at the console and smiles, knowing that he can now transform it back into Alice. He picks up the laptop and starts the retransformation process. As the beam scans the console, Jake can see the pieces on the display starting to fade away. The console starts to glow, and Jake can see Alice&#39;s body starting to form. The beam continues to work and finally, the transformation is complete, and Alice lies on the bed.<br />
She looks up at Jake and smiles, still catching her breath. &quot;Now, that was a really interesting experience,&quot; she says, her voice husky from the intense pleasure. &quot;I had a lot of fun being your game console.&quot; Jake smiles back at her. &quot;I&#39;m glad you had fun. And I had a lot of fun too. I loved playing with the console that was you and trying to solve the puzzle.&quot; He leans in and gives her a kiss. &quot;And I&#39;m glad I was able to solve it fast enough three times in a row.&quot; Alice returns the kiss, still smiling. &quot;Yes, I&#39;m glad you were able to solve it too. I have to admit, I&#39;m curious about what it was like for you. What was it like, playing with me as a game console?&quot; Jake thinks for a moment. &quot;It was actually a lot of fun. I loved the challenge of solving the puzzle and making the console orgasm. And I have to admit, it was a bit frustrating when I couldn&#39;t solve it fast enough.&quot; He smiles. &quot;But it was also very exciting. I felt like I was on a mission to induce orgasms, and it was a great feeling when I finally succeeded.&quot; Alice laughs. &quot;I can imagine. I&#39;m glad you enjoyed it. And I have to say, I&#39;m a bit surprised. I didn&#39;t expect it to be so much fun. But it was. It was a really unique experience.&quot; He takes her in his arms. &quot;You say it was fun. Please, tell me everything. I can&#39;t imagine how it was for you. We&#39;ve practically deactivated your mind completely and left only the part that is responsible for feeling pleasure and orgasms. If everything was implemented by the Transform-O-Matic as we intended, then you didn&#39;t notice anything about the games and such. Except maybe a feeling of pleasure when I moved the pieces.&quot; Alice tries to put her experience into words. &quot;It was... incredible. I felt my body transforming, my skin becoming a hard, smooth surface, my limbs merging together. And my mind... it was like it just disappeared. I didn&#39;t think about anything, I didn&#39;t think at all, I just felt. But these are inadequate words. I didn&#39;t actually feel any different feelings because there wasn&#39;t enough of me to be able to have multiple feelings or thoughts. There was only pleasure, you know? And it was so intense, so overwhelming. I felt like I was drowning in pleasure, but in a good way. I didn&#39;t want it to stop. I&#39;m not even sure if I can speak of an &#39;I&#39;. There was no &#39;I&#39;. I have no idea what I can call what I was...&quot; She pauses, trying to collect her thoughts. &quot;I remember feeling pleasure, lots of pleasure, that just happened. And then, sometimes, it would peak and I would have an orgasm. It was like I was just responding to some unknown stimulus, and it was amazing.&quot; She thinks back to the different orgasms she had. &quot;Some of them were more intense than others, but they all felt incredible. Except for one, which was... shallow. It was like my circuits were expecting something, and it didn&#39;t happen. But even that was okay, because it was they way it was, I just felt.&quot; She looks at Jake, her eyes shining with excitement. &quot;I was just a vessel for pleasure, and it was incredible. Thank you for making this experience possible for me. I&#39;m fascinated by how precisely the Transform-O-Matic carries out the transformations.&quot; She pauses, thinking back to her experience. &quot;But, looking back, I think I reduced my experience too much. It was great to have experienced it, but somehow it was too one-dimensional. I&#39;m glad I got to experience it, but I don&#39;t think I would want to do it again.&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m glad you liked it, my dear,&quot; Jake says, smiling. &quot;And I&#39;m glad we could make it possible for you. I have to admit, I was aroused when I heard the sounds of an orgasm and I was proud of myself when I managed to make it happen. But it was also kind of strange, because we were in no contact otherwise than just physical contact and the sounds and the display on the console.&quot; He pauses, thinking about the experience. &quot;I think I understand what you mean by &#39;one-dimensional&#39;. It was a very unique experience, but it was also too much limited. I think it&#39;s good that we can switch between different experiences and try out new things.&quot; He hugs her tighter. &quot;The Transform-O-Matic did a very good job in carrying out our wishes. But I think we should also try to explore other options and see what else we can experience together than just this one-dimensional pleasure. I was surprised today that you have a submissive side. And now we also know that you have limits that you don&#39;t want to cross. And I&#39;m glad we found out about that together.&quot; Alice laughs. &quot;Yes, I think I&#39;m a little more complex than I thought. And I&#39;m glad I got you aroused too, even if it was just through the sounds and display. And I agree with you, it was a very unique experience, but also limited. I&#39;m so excited to try new things with the Transform-O-Matic and see what else we can experience together. And I&#39;m glad we can talk about our limits and boundaries. I think that&#39;s important for our relationship.&quot; She kisses him. &quot;I love you, Jake.&quot; Jake returns the kiss. &quot;I love you too, my darling. Yes, it so good, we can talk about our limits and boundaries. I think that&#39;s very important and somehow the Transform-O-Matic helps us also in this. That&#39;s really surprising for me!&quot; Alice smiles. &quot;Yes, I think it does. And I&#39;m glad we have it. It&#39;s opened up a whole new world of possibilities for us.&quot; She leans in and gives him another kiss, a very passionate kiss that leaves both of them breathless and excited. Alice notices his boner and starts to giggle. &quot;I think we&#39;re not done yet, aren&#39;t we? Have you noticed how often and how persistently we have something similar to sex today? So many orgasms and I don&#39;t feel drained at all. I think the Transform-O-Matic has some kind of refreshing side-effect.&quot; Jake grins. &quot;Yes, I noticed it too. I&#39;m not tired at all. And I think you&#39;re right, it&#39;s some kind of refreshing side-effect. Maybe it&#39;s because our mind and body are somehow reset with each transformation? Whatever it is, I&#39;m glad we&#39;re enjoying it.&quot; He leans in and gives her another kiss, his boner pressing against her leg. &quot;And I think you&#39;re right, we&#39;re not done yet. I&#39;m ready for more. What do you say? Do you want to try something else with the Transform-O-Matic?&quot; Alice smiles, her eyes shining with excitement. &quot;Yes, I do. Definitely. But I&#39;m hungry now and I think I need to go to the bathroom. And we have a few things on our list for today, like a bit of cleaning and grocery shopping. Can we postpone our next experiment until later tonight?&quot;</p>
