<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Chapter is longer than the previous one with a focus on exposition and lore. There&#39;s POV switch too.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">    The sound of claws clicking against hardwood floor echoes throughout the library as a small cloaked figure walks in through the ornate entrance. A lone woman sits at a large desk besides the entrance, having to peer over to get a view of the small shape as it entered. Her grey eyes as mischievous as they were, held intelligence.<br />
<br />
    “Ah, I see you&#39;re back, little one.” The woman&#39;s motherly voice causes the figure to flinch, its amber eyes lit up by the small candle on the desk. Sighing, yellow scaled hands peek out from the sleeves of its robe and rise to its, throwing back the oversized hood covering its face.<br />
<br />
    The desk lady sighs at the sight of the yellow kobold, adjusting her glasses. “I must admit, your kind <i>really</i> do fancy those oversized cloaks. Are you sure you can see from beneath that hood?” A nervous smile creeps onto the kobold&#39;s face, sweat already dripping down his brow.<br />
<br />
    The librarian merely laughs in response, patting his head gently. “Come now, Thorin. You know I&#39;m merely teasing you.” The yellow kobold known as Thorin sheepishly scratches the back of his head, his gaze falling to his clawed digitigrade feet. The librarian&#39;s own gaze falls to the shape of a book beneath the kobold&#39;s cloak.<br />
<br />
    Heels clacking against wood resonate throughout the library as the woman walks from around the desk. The small lizardboy glances up at her curiously before realization strikes his face. Hastily, digging his hands beneath his cloak, the yellow reptile&#39;s hand withdraws a rather large book, two criss-crossing eye symbols adorning it&#39;s cover. Holding out in front of him, a smile crosses the woman&#39;s face as she gently takes it from him. <br />
<br />
    Nodding to the kobold with a grin, she walks back behind the desk and sits down. Thorin&#39;s reptilian maw stretches into a grateful smile, his claws clicking against the wooden floor as he attempts to quietly walk into a nearby aisle. <br />
<br />
    The librarian&#39;s grey eyes examine the cover of the book curiously. One of the eyes was a light blue color, appearing to radiate a white light, while another eye was red, dripping with a black liquid appearing to represent darkness. She had little idea that the reptile was into such fairytales.<br />
<br />
    The young kobold sighs as he thinks of the librarian, known to the townsfolk as Cynthia. The woman was rather tall compared to most other human women he&#39;d seen, standing at a towering 6’3. Compared to his short height of 3’4, which was just below average for a kobold&#39;s height, he truly did feel like nothing more than a child beside her. <br />
<br />
    Slowing to a walk, Thorin begins to skim through a multitude of books from the countless shelves. There were a multitude of books he had the option of reading, but even then he probably had read them countless times. He had taken a fancy to quite a couple of stories though. A personal favorite was a story of a paladin who had lost every aspect of his humanity except in mind. But as of late mere stories weren&#39;t what the lizard was searching for.<br />
<br />
    As if by fate, his eyes drift to a large and worn brown book he didn&#39;t ever recall seeing. Picking it up, Thorin&#39;s reptilian eyes shine as he skims through the pages, some littered with beautiful illustrations while others were filled with texts and legends. A joyful smile crosses the kobold&#39;s face as he trots down the aisle, holding it safely in his claws, before eventually coming upon a desk and chair small enough for him to sit on.<br />
<br />
    Grunting with slight effort, the small lizardman sets the thick bundle of pages onto the desk, before quietly sitting in the desks equally as small chair. Removing his black oversized cloak, the kobold stretches as the fresh air of the library meets the bare scales on his arms, the lizard wearing a rather loose sleeveless green shirt. Scooting a nearby candle closer to light up the large book, Thorin&#39;s slit eyes glow in excitement as they read the cover.<br />
<br />
    “<i>The Eyes of Truth</i>.” The title was a bit odd to him, and if anything rather ridiculous, but it was a new find. And he thoroughly enjoyed finding and reading new books in such a homely library.<br />
<br />
    Slowing flipping through the cover and a few introductory pages, a wide smile crosses the reptile&#39;s face again as a table of contents appears. Just about every page of the book was filled to the brim with stories of the world, with the entire thing totalling to about 500 pages!<br />
<br />
    Unable to contain his excitement, Thorin happily turns the pages, the title of the first legend gracing his amber eyes. Reading it aloud, familiarity fills the kobold boy.<br />
<br />
    “<i>Death and Rebirth.</i>” He should&#39;ve known such a well-known, widespread legend would be present in this book. It had been drilled into his scaled head countless times, yet he didn&#39;t mind reading through it again.<br />
<br />
    “Light, Darkness, and Order.” Thorin read out loud, the three words having practically been branded onto his brain.<br />
<br />
    Puzzlement fills his eyes as he reads the next paragraph. “The concepts of light and darkness were once united, before a…” Squinting, Thorin brings his muzzle closer to the book. His brow furrows as part of the legend had faded with time. <br />
<br />
    Literally and <i>figuratively</i>. He didn&#39;t ever remember there being another sentence after. He&#39;d have to ask Cynthia. Sighing, the next verse of the legend graces his lips.<br />
<br />
    “As light and darkness split and faded with existence itself…” His reptilian eyes squint again, another word appearing to have vanished as well, although the sentence continued. “...faded along with the world of order, leaving nothingness.”<br />
<br />
    “From nothing, a new universe was born, stretching out and forming a new reality. The new reality was comprised of three realms, mirroring the concepts present in the unified world of old.” The glow returns to his slit eyes, this verse wasn&#39;t faded like the previous. <br />
<br />
    Puzzlement washes across his face just as quickly, the kobold putting his lower jaw on the desk. This version of the legend was noticeably different compared to the other versions he&#39;d heard. <br />
<br />
    <i>”Concepts and a unified world?”</i> <br />
<br />
    “With light and darkness separated, the old empty world became our world. Void of order, chaos ruptured our world.” Thorin&#39;s head tilts in a mix of joy and confusion. The concept of Chaos itself was known heavily to the world. <br />
If anything, “Chaos” was a fitting term to describe the world nowadays.<br />
<br />
    Reluctantly turning the page after being unable to come to a conclusion about the legend&#39;s credibility, excitement replaced the disappointment he&#39;d felt moments before.<br />
<br />
    “<i>The Two Clans</i>.” <br />
<br />
    Shaking with excitement, Thorin&#39;s eyes glide through the page to make sure no words were faded away, before a victorious grin spreads across his face. Clearing his throat and scooting the book closer to himself, the young reptile begins to read, his voice taking on a mystical tone.<br />
<br />
    “Before the world was split into three realms, there once existed two clans that acted as the overseers of history, maintaining the delicate balance between light and darkness.” <br />
<br />
    <i>”Clans!”</i><br />
<br />
    In all of his reading he&#39;d never heard of there being clans involved with the concepts and powers of old. It had been mentioned by countless other texts and his very own teachers that they were uncontrollable, that a modern mages attempt to have control of light or dark magic would have their body be torn apart by the raw power.<br />
<br />
    “To preserve the balance of light and dark, it was said that both concepts must never mix. A combination of the two would apparently bring the world to an end.” Thorin&#39;s voice cracks at the last sentence, the reptile&#39;s yellow scales tensing up.<br />
<br />
    <i>“The intersection of light and dark would destroy the world? Then how did it manage to exist before it was split apart?”</i><br />
<br />
    Thorin&#39;s mind swirls as he ponders the legend, unable to discern it&#39;s meaning. Did it mean a shift in <i>balance</i>?<br />
<br />
    “The clan of Interlopers who controlled the darkness were known as the Sorcerers of Shadow, while the clan who controlled the light were known as the Sages of Phosphorescence.” His eyes light up in interest. This meant that there truly <i>did</i> once exist a group that could control light and darkness.<br />
<br />
    <i>“...If they kept balance, then why were they called Interlopers?”</i> Thorin asks himself. Sorcerers and Sages, controllers of two concepts that are unable to be controlled. It poised all sorts of questions, questions he&#39;d never have answered knowing how vague legends tended to be.<br />
<br />
    “Despite their valiant efforts, this balance between light and darkness was broken one day. A war had broken out between the two clans, before both were practically driven to extinction.” His brow furrowing again, Thorin traces his claw against the text.<br />
<br />
    <i>“But why would both clans drive themselves to their deaths…?”</i> Thorin&#39;s thoughts are broken as his eyes drift to the next paragraph of the legend.<br />
<br />
    “With both sorcerers and sages gone, there was nothing to contain the primal beings of light and darkness. The ensuing chaos overtook order.”<br />
<br />
    “The world rumbled, and with a final breath, order was no more.”<br />
<br />
    “As reality broke and reformed, a new world was formed, only knowing chaos.”<br />
<br />
    <i>“So a shift in balance caused a war to break out between these clans, and they ended up killing themselves… With their deaths the spirits of light and darkness were free to do as they wished with the world...”</i> The kobold&#39;s mind ran wild with various musings. Why had he never found this book before? The legend wasn&#39;t even done yet!<br />
<br />
    “Yet, remains of both clans remained within the new world, merely offshoots of the original concepts.” The young lizardman&#39;s voice quivers as the words slip from his mouth, unable to think of anything but reading.<br />
<br />
    “These new clans cared little for the balance of the world, instead seeking chaos. They held no goals of restoring true balance.”<br />
<br />
    “They thrived in chaos.”<br />
<br />
    Thorin quietly leans back into the chair, realizing he&#39;d been standing on the chair from excitement. The legend itself was so short, but there so much to think about, to take apart. Clasping his face with his claws, Thorin sighs. <br />
<br />
    <i>”The mages and Interlopers of today are just offshoots of these two clans from a millennia ago? But…”</i> The yellow kobold sighs again, his gaze dropping to his lap. Reading over old myths and legends always tended to make him excited, but this was… <i>different</i>.<br />
<br />
    It was as if his own reality was breaking apart. <br />
<br />
    Closing his eyes, the small lizardboy attempts to clear his thoughts, although the attempt is foiled as he feels something rather large and warm on his head, the horns on his head driving into something soft, as if pillows had been placed on top of his head.<br />
<br />
    “It&#39;s getting quite late, young Thorin.” A motherly voice whispers, Thorin&#39;s scales freeze up as the reptile realizes <i>what</i> is on his head. A warm hand reaches over his shoulder and gently caresses his chest. The kobold gulps as a thick blush begins to form on his yellow scales.<br />
<br />
    “I-I think I&#39;m fine, M-Ms. Cynthia…” Trying not to look up, the kobold&#39;s amber eyes look to the candle and focus on it&#39;s gentle flame. His scales heat up as Cynthia&#39;s long and soft black hair cascade over the sides of his face and down his bare shoulders. <br />
<br />
    “You <i>think</i>, my scurrying little friend?” Cynthia&#39;s smooth, sultry voice and her bewitching tone were hypnotic to the small lizard. Nodding his head after a moment of struggle, Thorin points his clawed finger to the open book, the legend of the Two Clans still open. <br />
<br />
    Her calculating grey eyes drift to the pages of the book. “My, my! Another fairytale?” The yellow kobold nods his head again, before speaking up and explaining the legends.<br />
<br />
    “<i>Y-Y-Yes</i>! The legends talk a-about light, darkness and the concepts of b-balance!” Cynthia&#39;s eyes curiously skim through the text. “A-And it turns out, there used to be two clans that could <i>control</i> the powers of light and darkness!” <br />
<br />
    “You&#39;ve taken quite the interest in metaphysics, little one. What&#39;s caused all of this?” The kobold stutters at her simple question, unable to muster an answer. <br />
<br />
    “You always do like to play hard to get.” Cynthia dismisses. Patting the kobold&#39;s shoulder, Thorin feels a rush of emotions as Cynthia stands up, her breasts departing from the top of his head. Looking back over his shoulder, an almost dreamy sigh escapes his maw as the librarian&#39;s voluptuous and slender form walks away, the clacking of her heels getting distant.<br />
<br />
    Thorin tended to be a frequent visitor to the library, more or less being a social outcast due to being a kobold. As such, he had gotten to know Cynthia rather well, the human woman constantly teasing him. He held no doubts she cared for him though. <br />
<br />
    Encounters with her still were rather shaky to say the least. Being a mage and tuned with magic, the kobold couldn&#39;t help but feel the librarian radiated a type of magic he&#39;d never seen before.<br />
<br />
    Glancing outside a nearby window, a gasp slips from the small lizardboy&#39;s lips at the sight an orange sky, indicating the sun had began to set. Draping his cloak around his shoulders, Thorin lifts the large book of legends after a moment of effort. Hoping from the seat, his reptilian amber orbs scan the library as he searches for Cynthia.<br />
<br />
    Walking to the front desk at the library&#39;s entrance, the reptile&#39;s eyelids droop at the librarian being absent. Feeling a tap on his shoulder, Thorin spins around only to be at eye level with Cynthia&#39;s crotch. <br />
<br />
    “I believe my eyes are up here, Thorin.” The small reptilian&#39;s hands lose their grasp on the book as he stumbles away, yelping before repeatedly apologizing and covering his face. A pompous laugh from Cynthia only causes his face to flush.<br />
<br />
    “I-I just wanted t-to borrow t-t-this book!” Thorin stutters as he lifts the legend filled book. Cynthia drops to her knees, staring deep into his slit eyes. For a human, her alluring beauty was practically <i>hypnotizing</i>.<br />
<br />
    “My apologies Thorin, I just <i>adore</i> teasing you! We both know you&#39;re far too shy to ever speak up for yourself, yet here you are snapping at me!” A devious grin crosses her face as the kobold buries his face into his cloak, his eyes closing in embarrassment.<br />
<br />
    “Truly a naughty boy you are! I might just have to punish you by holding this <i>oh so heavy</i> book right above your head, just out of your tiny reach!” Thorin shakes his head wildly, not wishing to undergo such horrendously embarrassing torture.<br />
<br />
    Cynthia&#39;s further attempts at teasing are interrupted by the entry door swinging open. Sighing and rising from the floor, the librarian&#39;s grey eyes meet a pair of ocean blue eyes as she turns around. Peeking out from behind Cynthia&#39;s leg, Thorin grins at the sight of a familiar blonde haired human.<br />
<br />
    “Oh Kairos, you&#39;ve <i>saved</i> me!” Thorin cries out in joy as he runs over to the male human, his small arms wrapping around the red clothed warrior&#39;s legs, completely forgetting the book.<br />
<br />
    Kairos chuckles as he rubs the youthful kobold&#39;s head. Glancing back up his gaze meets Cynthia&#39;s own. Smiling she picks up the book and hands it to the confused human. “I believe your little friend there needs this.” Giving a wink, her heels clack against the wood floor as she walks away.<br />
<br />
    A tug on his tunic causes Kairos to look down again. “How did you know I was here?” Thorin quips, taking the book from the human&#39;s gloved hand. Kairos merely shrugs, tossing aside a stray bang.<br />
<br />
    “I didn&#39;t. I just got back from that hellish forest.” Thorin flinches at the human&#39;s flat remark, tilting his head curiously. His reptilian eyes take notice of the snake and wolf mask clipped onto his friend&#39;s belt.<br />
<br />
    “You went shopping too?” A slight chuckle from Kairos causes the kobold to glance up in confusion. It unnerved the reptile by how unusually broken the laughter sounded.<br />
<br />
    “Surely there&#39;s a place to sit around here? I have a lot to tell you, Thorin.” Their eyes locking, Thorin gulps at the seriousness present in the human&#39;s face. Nodding in slight reluctance, the kobold guides the red clothed human to a larger desk with two chairs on opposite ends. <br />
<br />
    Climbing onto a chair, Thorin hastily tosses the large book onto the table, before removing his cloak once again. Glancing across Kairos from the table, his scales stand up on end as the human pulls out a black tome, an eye symbol on its cover. Setting it on the desk, he unclips both masks from his belt and places them beside the tome. The masks and the tome gave off an unusual energy, causing the yellow kobold to shiver.<br />
<br />
    He prayed Cynthia wouldn&#39;t mind if they stayed a bit later than usual.</p>
