<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Erica did a mental double take, &quot;Did he just say 'his city?' &quot; <br />
<br />
The body of Tamthis', once again Tommy's after what seemed like eternity fell to the <br />
sandstone floor limp, severely bruising his muzzle in the process, he was going to feel <br />
that when he got back to his body. Tommy's spirit uploaded itself into the threads of <br />
magic that held the city and it's NPC like citizens together, becoming his own spreading <br />
drop of ink following after Tamthis' spreading drop of ink. <br />
<br />
Kyriel couldn't help but think it was odd looking at what was Tommy's body  now... still a <br />
tall humanoid fennec kitsune, still draped in an oversized version of Karther's cape and <br />
still showing off it's body for all the world to see, physically, not a single thing had <br />
changed. <br />
<br />
Erica repeated herself as if no one had heard her, &quot;Did he just call this 'his city?' &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, it seems he did.&quot; Jasmine responded at last in a totally calm voice, Tommy's 'residue' <br />
as his awareness spread through the Karthis looking his Tamthis persona appeared to be <br />
looking the throne room from imploding on them.  Jasmine wanted to make a few gestures <br />
however, &quot;If that kitsune hadn't chosen to flee, I wish at least that he had undone this <br />
curse upon my shell before doing so.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Is something wrong with being in the body of a female and a fox?&quot; Lisa asked in an even <br />
tone.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I gave no protest to this form purely for the sake of the performance of us being the <br />
kitsune's women during at stealthy entry into the city. Having my shell still being in a <br />
shape altered by a kitsune flusters me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Erica asked the obvious question, &quot;Why not just undo it yourself?&quot; <br />
<br />
Kyriel was the one to speak up, &quot;Because... mixing magics... can always lead to <br />
unpredictable side effects and unforeseen out comes... while Jasmine can remove the leaf <br />
curse on her own, doing so might backfire, in particular magic based so heavily on <br />
organized chaos like kitsune magic... Karther was engulfed in it, likely why he funneled all <br />
of his insanity into the castle walls to keep from losing all direction and lucidity.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good text book answer.&quot; Jasmine said to the cherub. Truth be told, Jasmine had little faith <br />
in the barely reconstructed Ego of Tommy being able to overwhelm, or subdue the <br />
remains of Karther's programming, but she had told him he had twenty minutes, and that <br />
was precisely what she intended to give him. 'Also, I never imagined that Tabris' offspring <br />
would actually succeed in digging out the remains of the lad's Ego to begin with... let us <br />
see if I am surprised twice in one day...' <br />
<br />
&quot;Do I have to keep asking this question? Did he just say 'his city?' His city? The city <br />
magically created out of nothing but sand? The city populated with nothing but people <br />
who were swindled into agreeing to become citizens here? And what did you mean 'shock <br />
of the new city' er.... Jasmine.&quot; Erica realized she didn't have a clue what to properly <br />
address Jasmine as! She had been given the fundamentals of her new race, including that <br />
unlike Angels in Christianity, Islamic Angels couldn't disobey or deviate from order even if <br />
they wanted to! With that in mind, Erica realized she should have been very very VERY <br />
grateful that Jasim's orders were to unleash the Dijinn on Karther IF Tabris' group failed... <br />
<br />
Jasmine looked at Erica like the incredibly younger Angel had asked a incredibly stupid <br />
question, then got a look of realization, &quot;Oh right, you and your sisters who chose to <br />
become Messengers were sculptured to specialize as soldiers so you wouldn't have sensed <br />
it... the illusion barriers are gone, the Veil has been removed... operation Return has <br />
begun.&quot; <br />
<br />
All three younger Messengers gasped at this. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dad/Mom, you have your wish.&quot; Kyriel whispered. &quot;For better or worse, the kingdom of <br />
illusions is no more.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Wouldn't it have made sense to wait until AFTER we had Tamthis dealt with?&quot; Erica asked <br />
exasperated. <br />
<br />
Jasmine shook her head, &quot;Tis not ours to reason why, only to do as commanded. I had no <br />
idea this would happen when it did until it had happened. Perhaps whoever has done so <br />
wished to make sure to get humanity's attention with a large enough incident.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa sighed, &quot;I guess what's done is done and what's done can't be changed so we had <br />
better deal with what's happening now. ... And Erica has a point though... Tommy did call <br />
this 'his city' and he did say he would not let us dismantle it anymore than Tamthis.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly,&quot; Erica groaned, &quot;How are we gonna keep from ending up having to fight kooky <br />
fox king number three?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tommy's not like that!&quot; Kyriel snapped startling everyone as she stamped her foot.  &quot;He's <br />
not evil! And he doesn't want to conquer the middle east!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kyriel, Erica didn't say he did.&quot; Lisa intervened, &quot;But what are we to do? Nearly everyone in <br />
this city is here because they were kidnapped or lied to. The whole REASON why T' came <br />
to help us was because Karther was filling up his castle with people he was plucking away <br />
from their lives at random. Well, most at least.&quot; Lisa thought of Alexandra, what the <br />
kitsune had said suggested that she just might have, just might have been given a choice, <br />
though knowing Karther it wasn't likely an informed one. <br />
<br />
Erica rubbed where her eyebrows would be if she still had them, &quot;Not to mention all the <br />
conflicting clans here are only not killing each other because Tamthis -programmed- <br />
them to get along. Like robots.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kryiel spoke with total confidence and faith, &quot;After Tommy beats Tamthis, he'll let everyone <br />
here go. There aren't many natural born fennec kitsune left, but Tommy knows he wont' <br />
need to create slaves to find volunteers.&quot; <br />
<br />
Erica leaned in close, &quot;You're saying that as if you believe Tommy's gonna go back to a <br />
nicer version of bastard Karther's plan.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... When Tommy assimilated Tammia and some of the other subparts, he effectively <br />
inherited Karther's position as prince of all desert foxes.. including the task of getting the <br />
fennec kitsune back on track.. I was a part of his mind for a short bit... he's... I think <br />
seeing this city and the fennec kitsune as his responsibility has become internalized.&quot; She <br />
looked at them sternly. &quot;But that DOESN'T mean he's going to turn into another Karther!&quot; <br />
<br />
ERica said, &quot;So HOW is your dad's/mom's best friend kicking his worst part's butt gonna <br />
keep Jasmine's hypothetical General Ripper from blowing up this place?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa spoke, &quot;With all due respect elder Jasmine, I feel that you're jumping to conclusions... <br />
you don't attack something just because it randomly appears in the middle of nowhere... <br />
and if Return has really begun, there are now more than a few cities now that have <br />
suddenly appeared on the maps. They'd only attack if they linked this place to the villages <br />
that had suddenly been de-populated in the last few days.. and right now they're two <br />
related and unknown phenomenon. -After- Tommy destroys or assimilates Tamthis,&quot; Lisa <br />
looked kindly at Kyriel, &quot;If he really has internalized the mantle of leader of the fennec <br />
kitsune, he'll have enough time to peacefully contact the leaders of the lands.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyriel looked at Jasmine, and fought against the part of her wanting to call the older angel <br />
'mommy.'  'My parents are gone. My mother and my father gives themselves so I could be <br />
born. Jasmine is not my mom.' Not that there was really a set president for such things, <br />
since Angels did not normally biologically reproduce. <br />
<br />
Erica still had a malcontent look on her face, &quot;But that still leaves the question, how do we <br />
keep the locals in the city from killing each other once they're no longer fox zombies?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We don't.&quot; Jasmine said plainly, &quot;If that is their choice, that is their choice. If they chose to <br />
remain here that is there choice. If they choice to kill each other, that is their choice. If they <br />
chose to go home and leave the fighting for another day, that'll be their choice too... we <br />
are here but to remove the threat that the current kitsune prince represents to the <br />
mundane and mythical worlds.&quot;<br />
<br />
While Erica and Lisa stood shocked, Kryiel spoke up smiling, &quot;Dad/mom would be <br />
surprised and impressed miss Jasmine... you respecting human's ability to make their own <br />
decisions.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;And what about you little cherub?&quot; Jasmine asked calmly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I do what my dad/mom would have done... remind them they have a choice not to kill, <br />
which many people in a blood feud forget.&quot;<br />
<br />
Erica and Lisa looked at the cherub, with a slight look of awe on their faces. 'I knew there <br />
was a reason I could still think of Kyriel as a leader in spite of her being so cute now.' Lisa <br />
thought. The fact that the two of them could even for a moment defer to Kyriel's point of <br />
view rather than that of the senior Angel, reminded that the sisters were no islamic <br />
messengers. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come on,&quot; Kyriel flew past the three older angels (flying was faster than walking for her <br />
now), let's get Tommy's body out of here in case this place starts to turn inside out before <br />
Tommy had put Tamthis in his place! <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
Alexandra entered the courtyard, the water was still flowing and the plants were still <br />
green but that was it. All the fountains and sculptures wavered as if they were made of <br />
jello during an earthquake. Still, they were away from any tall buildings as much as they <br />
could be without trying to rush through the entire city which Alexandra considered a fool's <br />
gamble. <br />
<br />
Catching her breath Alexandra laid down poor Jennifer and Kathy...  'Why I am I helping <br />
them at all?... I guess because we are all victims at this point of my prince's madness.' <br />
<br />
She saw sand object split in two right down the middle then seal back up together again... <br />
she saw faces of kitsune come out of the walls of sand just long enough to be noticed <br />
before fading back in. She shuddered. Was this city going to die too? How many times was <br />
her life going to be stolen from here? <br />
<br />
When she saw the shadow fall on her, she knew Kathy had apparently woken up. <br />
Alexandra was no warrior, never was, had no desire to be, but she was a hard worker! <br />
Kathy had been made not to do any intense action outside of the bedroom. Kathy knew <br />
how to comment, please, gossip, laugh, joke, and make love, Alexandra knew how to kill <br />
live stock to prepare for dinner. In short, Alexandra was just stronger than her. <br />
<br />
&quot;KATHY! There is no point to this! PLEASE! I beg you! Just open your eyes!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm wide awake traitor!&quot; She hissed.<br />
<br />
&quot;No you're not!... Kathy...&quot; Alexandra realized... this woman was exactly the same as her... <br />
both of them had their lives stolen and had been custom built to fit someone else's <br />
fantasy. &quot;Do you really think I'd betray our kind? Our people? Our kingdom?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You have! You want to see our king dead!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;.... Lisa, the Angel told me and you...  our king is ill, they just want to cure him of his <br />
sickness...&quot; She didn't say how the sickness was Tamthis' personality, but for Alexandra, it <br />
was close enough for the truth. She still hadn't forgiven Tamthis for erasing Karther from <br />
existence... Alexandra had loved him, created or not, they were her emotions, and her <br />
prince had been stolen from her, forever. Now the being who he had been used as raw <br />
material for was trying to kill her.<br />
<br />
&quot;LIES!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;LOOK AROUND YOU! This city is him and he is this city... can you say this city looks well?&quot;<br />
<br />
Finally, somehow, Kathy DID take in her surroundings. &quot;This... this is nothing but a trick!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;It's no stage performance... !! Kathy look out behind you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You insult my-&quot; Alexandra dove down and tackled Kathy just as six scimitars smacks into <br />
the sand stone.<br />
<br />
Like a snake in the grass the insanity had looked for a host, a medium, anything to create <br />
another outlet from the insanity that was growing greater and greater within Tamthis as <br />
he spread his mind over this city and suddenly found new awareness within it as well that <br />
were not welcome breaking his center even more.<br />
<br />
It had found Jennifer, still unconscious, still lacking arms after having lost four. The <br />
dismembered shiva vixen had the sand plunge into her as the two vixens had fought one <br />
another. In a matter of seconds Jennifer had become seven feet tall, had grown SIX arms, <br />
and now had a scimitar in each, the sloppy programming not being nearly complex <br />
enough to deal with diverse weapons. While Tamthis would never ever consciously harm <br />
Kathy even to save his own life, Jennifer was under the control of Tamthis', formerly <br />
Karther's insanity, the broken weapon mindlessly seeing anything alive and bled red as a <br />
target. <br />
<br />
'Kill.. kill...kill...&quot; The Shiva vixen's mouth spoke. <br />
<br />
&quot;What?...&quot; Kathy looked completely shattered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you! Your master is sick! It's spreading to everything!&quot; Alexandra snarled. Alexandra <br />
was being reminded far too much of her own state a short short while ago at the news of <br />
her prince gone, bu Alexandra had the adrenaline rush to keep thinking straight look <br />
along to pull Kathy away from the mad shiva vixen. <br />
<br />
Alexandra didn't know where she could run... or where she could lead Kathy if the harem <br />
vixen had a nervous break down.. an Alexandra didn't like the taste of just leaving the <br />
kitsune to her fate. <br />
<br />
The mad shiva vixen rose her six swords into a splash pattern around herself and prepared <br />
another series of mad slashes. Five seconds and four blurs later the shiva vixen was <br />
disarmed, on the ground, restrained, and was being unhexed for the second time that <br />
day, this time with safety measures thrown in prevent such a thing again, it being much <br />
simpler this time since the brainwashing was the incredibly sloppy 'zap and go' variety. <br />
<br />
Alexandra and Kathy huddled together forgetting their previous fight and stared in awe at <br />
what they saw.<br />
<br />
&quot;You... you saved me?... Natalie... Lucy? What are you doing with them?&quot; At this point, the <br />
minor possibility that Alexandra might have been telling the truth had finally dawned on <br />
Kathy's made from scratch mind. <br />
<br />
Natalie merely whimpered and rubbed against Kathy, not what she had come to expect <br />
from the alpha female of her king's giant muscle bound killing machines. Lucy, sighed and <br />
closed her solid black eyes. &quot;I've... finally woken up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So... are you one of them now?&quot; Kathy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Vicki said putting a hand on Lucy's still sandy shoulders, &quot;She's no angel.&quot; Lucy <br />
might have had the appearance of one, but Vicki now knew that meant the same as <br />
wearing a police officer's uniform.  Luna and Vicki in a united effort obliterated the cheap <br />
programming inside Jennifer, snapping her back to reality... she groaned and looked at <br />
herself... &quot;Dangit... still not male or wrinkly... looks like I got that return with interest <br />
though huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you can joke then you'll be fine.&quot; Luna said. <br />
<br />
Lucy dismissed the sand bound holding down Jennifer, Vicki this time had been careful to <br />
leave some defenses in place to make sure Lucy didn't snap back into insanity or under <br />
the city (meaning Tamthis' ) control. <br />
<br />
&quot;Lot of stuff happen to you?&quot; Luna asked Vicki.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Same. Natalie okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was able to repair her soul, but her mind is gonna take a lot longer to fix, yours?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;'Hers' is ...&quot; Lucy said not liking to be talked of in third person, &quot;Is... is whatever 'me' <br />
means anymore! Before at least I was still a living being! Now I'm just sand in the shape of <br />
the a anthro vixen! I'm not anything!&quot; <br />
 <br />
Luna broken into Lucy's lament, &quot;LUCY! I love you! You're my sister! You're a part of our <br />
family! Same as Keiko, Erica, Kyriel, Charlene and all the rest! But we really don't have time <br />
for you to have a break down right now! Let's hurry to the throne room and just maybe we <br />
can catch a glimpse of the finale before everything ends...&quot;<br />
<br />
Vicki, &quot;Luna, you should know now, as what we are, you should know, most endings, turn <br />
out to be just new beginning.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luna, &quot;Nice big sis but not that relevant! Let's move it!&quot; <br />
<br />
'What am I feeling?' Kathy thought, 'Within the wall of city I feel my king, who is yet not my <br />
king, and one who is not my king, and yet is my king... am I going mad?' Kathy asked <br />
herself becoming more sane than she had been in her entire existence. <br />
<br />
+++++++++<br />
<br />
To call kitsune immortal was a misnomer, they were positively hard to kill, due to their <br />
unpredictability, and were made of magically sterner stuff than mundane foxes... But they <br />
could still become spirits and nothing but spirits of worst came to worst. Like if the fennec <br />
kitesune who due to the madness of the city was now running around laughing with <br />
butcher knife much larger than he was slice random things in two. He saw the two <br />
currently unoccupied bodies of the two japanese kitsune, laughed and charged at them <br />
with the giant butcher knife... which was suddenly a giant daisy... the made fennec <br />
kitsune didn't really seem to notice or care as he hit the two kitsune with it, and moves on <br />
repeatedly hitting a wall with the giant flower laughing all the while. On the room a group <br />
of kits sunk waste high into the stone ceiling of the roof they were on, and pulled <br />
themselves now being foxtaurs and leaped from roof to roof singing 'Tonight, tonight.' <br />
Two girls who were on each other's shoulders followed suit when one became the taur <br />
body while the other become the torso. A quick soul hack kept the spirits from being <br />
hopelessly fused by the chaos and enabling them at a later time to be separated into <br />
independent beings again.  Julio groaned, why did that power surge have to wake him up? <br />
He was having the most wonderful dream... well, if he had to keep his camouflage from <br />
Jasim being turned into cutlets or a two headed donkey, then that was just what he had to  <br />
do. He just hoped that whoever he was sensing inside the city's threads of magic on top of <br />
Tamthis and the two kitsune finished  things before the reserves he had gotten from the <br />
power surge ran out...  it felt like Tamthis, yet had a different configuration from <br />
Tamthis... this was disorienting... 'Ugh! Have to stay focused! My soul is hacker proof on <br />
top of hacker proof but ...' Julio hacked gravity to deflect a tower that had twisted and <br />
wrapped so badly it had fallen sideways and had threatened to crush the bodies of the two <br />
kitsune. 'I just rather not see Keiko and her brother, sister, whatever killed.' <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
The current location of Tommy and Tamthis at that very moment was very simply to <br />
describe: Every single inch of the city. <br />
<br />
'You made a mistake by following me. Here I am stronger than ever, I shall finally absorb <br />
you here, the last remnant of my former self. And Karther's dream of a middle east <br />
populated only the fennec kitsune shall be a reality and he, as Kathy, shall experience <br />
nothing but happiness and pleasure for eternity as my queen.' <br />
<br />
'Are you saying that because you believe that, or because you want to scare me off?'<br />
 <br />
The location of the spirits of Keiko and Akane was equally easy to describe: they were <br />
everywhere -else!- <br />
<br />
'Who are you-!?' Tommy asked.<br />
<br />
'Us? We're your sisters, true you weren't part of the harem for very long before T' jumped <br />
to ruin bastard Karther's perfect little fantasy, but you're still part of the family as far we're <br />
concern.'<br />
<br />
'This'll make thanks giving very interesting.'<br />
<br />
'Akane!'<br />
<br />
'It's true.'<br />
<br />
'No I meant, the japanese don't have thanks giving.'<br />
<br />
'Oh, right.' <br />
<br />
'Are you two crazy?' <br />
<br />
&quot;&quot; Yes.&quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
'Look,' Akane said, 'I know you two likely wanted to have a whole big one on one fight of <br />
the souls, spirits and minds against each other decide who'll come out on top... but there's <br />
way too much on the table for this to be considered personal!'<br />
<br />
Akane's form became that of a japanese school girl with five fox tails and fox years and <br />
holding a 500 Mega-watt shoulder mounted laser cannon. Rather odd since all of them <br />
were just formless masses of will and awareness within the massive threads of magic that <br />
ran through the  city and it's people.<br />
<br />
The mental image of the magic web first became a copy of Karther's castle, then it became <br />
a baseball stadium from Tommy's home town... then it became a hot-springs house made <br />
to look painted like an anime. <br />
<br />
'AKANE! Cut it out!' Keiko shouted the place then became woods that spread out infinitely <br />
in all directions. 'Basically, we offer our imagination at your disposal for deleting what's <br />
left of bastard Karther's brainwashing and insanity.' The web of magic from their <br />
perspective became shapeless again and they were all once again formless masses of will <br />
and awareness. 'Besides, we figure you need help with the kitsune magic thing.'<br />
<br />
'Don't worry, I can handle it, thanks for the help though, I'm sure it'll make things easier.'<br />
<br />
'Hold on! Was that Kyriel just now?'<br />
<br />
'Just the part of her that's now a part of me, don't worry about.'<br />
<br />
'While you three had been blabbing... I've been absorbing more of my city's magic back to <br />
myself...'<br />
<br />
'What?' Akane said surprised, 'Dang! The meta-magic plane should be like in games where <br />
speaking is a free action!' <br />
<br />
'Don't worry... without the part of Kyriel that became a part of me he can't control or <br />
regulate it anymore nearly as good as he wants to think... he created this web when he was <br />
still whole... now he's just parts... Once again Tamthis.. you have nowhere to run now... <br />
either became a part of me, or vanish into oblivion.'<br />
<br />
'Enough... it'll be you who'll becomes a part of me.'<br />
<br />
'Ohh! Me Akane love trash talk before final final confrontation taking place in final final <br />
area of really really final dungeon!'<br />
<br />
Tamthis had lost Tammy's pleasure seeking and the rage and power of the wolf beasts. <br />
But he still had the devotion to Karther's cause and his own hubris after absorbing Queen <br />
and Lady Tammia. <br />
 'Prepare yourself then for game over with your save data erased! I am the king of all <br />
desert Kitsune! And two japanese kitsune and my left over raw material won't erase me...' <br />
<br />
'Then why did you retreat?'<br />
<br />
'Did I retreat? Or did I lure you here-?!'<br />
<br />
'Head games.' Keiko said, 'You're FINALLY getting into the act of what it means to be <br />
kitsune... might be hope for you yet.'<br />
<br />
'I CARE NOTHING FOR YOUR PRAISE OR INSULTS! You are the dust on a apple that needs to <br />
be cleaned off before it is devoured!' <br />
<br />
'Oooh, nice insult,' Keiko said, 'But I can do better,' She then thought a combination of <br />
twelve words at Tamthis' awareness. <br />
<br />
'.... YOU DIE NOW!'<br />
<br />
With two less than a week old chronologically five tailed japanese kitsune and Tommy on <br />
one side, and the complication of Karther's brainwashing and insanity on the other... the <br />
final battle for the fate of so many people finally began.</p>
