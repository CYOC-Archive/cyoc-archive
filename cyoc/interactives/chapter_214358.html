<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Eileen now cooked breakfast, Ty was able to learn more about Jill. After being reduced to childhood, the 40 year old woman hadn&#39;t gotten a chance to talk with Ty. As they now chatted, he began to learn a bit more about Jill and Eileen&#39;s history.<br />
<br />
The pair had met as Freshman, quickly becoming best friends. Throughout high school, Jill had been the quieter of the pair often times finding herself as a counter balance to the energetic Eileen. After high school the pair attended college together before graduating and moving in different directions. While Eileen found herself in an ugly marriage that ended in divorce, Jill&#39;s marriage was much sadder.<br />
<br />
Jill ended up marrying a man she had known for awhile when she was 26. The marriage was lovely, Jill gushing about what a wonderful man he was. Unfortunately, when Jill was 30, he had died in a car accident leaving her a widow. Since then Jill had remained single, rarely going on dates and having no children of her own. Ty watched as the blond woman sighed, tucking her legs underneath her as she drank her coffee. Even after a decade she still carried a torch for her husband, feeling guilty whenever she did go on a date. The woman had resigned herself to the single life, which she had few regrets about. &quot;It would have been nice to have kids but I&#39;m a bit old now,&quot; she sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey none of that this weekend,&quot; Eileen called. &quot;We&#39;re here to have fun so no moping.&quot; Jill chuckled, nodding in agreement as Eileen presented the pair their breakfast of pancakes and eggs. As they now ate, Ty began to ponder what to do.<br />
<br />
So far when he had used his powers he had only affected them physically. Over the course of the last few months he had wondered if he could change someone mentally as well. Glancing at both Jill and Eileen, he grew curious about what they were like when they were younger, especially after hearing Jill&#39;s stories. &quot;Only one way to find out,&quot; he thought.<br />
<br />
Ty now focused on Jill, watching as the woman grew younger. Jill&#39;s face seemed to smooth, the fine lines vanishing around her eyes as her skin seemed to tighten. Glancing at the womans body, he smiled as it appeared to tone, her skin looking softer as her blond hair regained some of its luster. Now instead of a middle aged woman, Ty beheld a beautiful blond of 25.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m still shocked you&#39;re finally getting married Jill,&quot; Eileen called. Ty glanced towards the kitchen, watching as a now 25 year old Eileen poked her head out. Ty could see that Eileen&#39;s appearance had changed as well, the womans body thinner, her breasts firmer, with a mature and flawless face. &quot;Well he&#39;s such a sweetheart,&quot; Jill smiled. &quot;And besides, it gives you a chance to be my maid of honor. &quot;<br />
<br />
Ty listened as the two young women continued to talk. They both seemed unaware that they were both 15 years younger, their minds easily slipping back into that time of their lives. Pleased with the results, Ty was curious if he could go even further.<br />
<br />
Ty watched as Jill began to grow younger once more. The womans face rounding as she became skinnier. Jill&#39;s face began to lose some of its maturity, her breasts rising slightly as her hair glowed with youth and vitality. The now 21 year old girl seemed more energized as she sipped her coffee. &quot;I can&#39;t believe your folks asked you to watch Becca this weekend,&quot; Jill said. &quot;I mean she&#39;s 17! What? Do they not trust her?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re old fashioned what can I say,&quot; Eileen called. This was certainly different, Ty noting that reality had altered. Instead of Becca being Eileen&#39;s daughter, she was now her kid sister. &quot;But jokes on them. She&#39;s camping with friends this weekend meaning we have the place to ourselves.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty gawked as Eileen now poked her head out of the kitchen. The Brazilian college girl was gorgeous with a youthful face, luxurious ebony hair, and generous curves. &quot;Is that why you invited Ty over,&quot; Jill asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um yeah,&quot; Eileen exclaimed. &quot;I mean how often do you meet a magical kid? Besides, he gives awesome foot massages.&quot; Jill now gave Eileen a wide smile before placing her feet in Ty&#39;s lap. Glancing at her feet, Ty had to admit they were flawless. Small toes and smooth to the touch, Ty had to admit she had cute feet, especially with the French tips that appeared to be quite recent. &quot;Okay kid show me what you can do,&quot; she grinned.<br />
<br />
As Ty now massaged the girls feet, he thought of how things had changed. Both women believed themselves to be in college, reality altering to make them believe Becca was Eileen&#39;s sister while still remembering Ty and his abilities. &quot;Hey don&#39;t forget about me,&quot; Eileen called. Ty watched as the energetic Brazilian girl now bounded over to him, throwing her feet in his lap. Ty smirked, now massaging both girls feet as they lounged on the couch. So far they both appeared quite open, not showing any shyness when dealing with him. This light flirting, Ty suspected, was because of the age difference. Both girls felt comfortable believing that they were in control with them being in college and Ty just starting high school. &quot;Wonder if that will change if they get a bit younger,&quot; Ty thought.<br />
<br />
Ty now watched as Jill and Eileen crossed the threshold back into their teens. Their adult clothing, which had already been a bit loose, began to truely bag around them. Ty could see the waist of Jill&#39;s sleep pants bag around her waist as her waist narrowed, her tshirt becoming baggies as her breasts lost their fullness. Eileen&#39;s legs now began to become skinnier, the robe she wore a bit larger on her teenage frame. Ty glanced at the teens faces as he stopped them at 18.<br />
<br />
&quot;So Ty,&quot; Eileen asked. &quot;How does it feel to be hanging out with two Seniors on a Saturday morning?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think he&#39;s enjoying himself,&quot; Jill grinned. &quot;But Eileen, aren&#39;t your parents gonna freak out? You know they didn&#39;t want any boys over.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cmon Jill we&#39;re 18,&quot; Eileen reassured. &quot;I mean we&#39;re graduating from high school in a few months. We&#39;re practically adults at this point.&quot; Jill nodded, still unsure as she leaned back at let Ty continue to give her a foot massage. As the two teens reclined, Ty pondered what had happened.<br />
<br />
Reality had altered further, changing both Eileen and Jill. The two teens were confident when dealing with Ty, but Jill was growing a bit more unsure as she lost years. The blond teen worried about getting in trouble, while her wilder friend tried to reassure her. Eileen, though, appeared to have returned to her wilder days. Sneaking boys into an adult free house and trying to convince the more timid Jill that everything would be okay. It was an interesting dynamic but, Ty wondered how things would change if they were all the same age.<br />
<br />
The changes were more pronounced as Jill and Eileen descended further jnto their teens. The girls lost a significant amount of curve, their waists narrowing, their breasts shrinking down a cup size, as their faces continued to round. Ty watched the two teens lose an inch or two in height leaving then a pair of waifish 15 year olds.<br />
<br />
Now Ty began to notice a significant change in the girls attitudes. Jill seemed nervous, the girl fidgeting as she stared at her feet. Obviously she was enjoying herself but her shyness was increasing. Jill shifted her legs nervously, Ty watching as the hems of her sleep pants crept over her heel. Eileen too was not spared of the shift in attitude. While still flirty, Ty noticed the girl now tighten her large robe, covering herself in an attempt to maintain her modesty. Still, Ty had a decent view if the Brazilian teens waifish legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eileen,&quot; Jill said nervously. &quot;If your parents come home we are going to be in so much trouble! What are they going to say if they found out we had a boy over?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They won&#39;t be home til Sunday night,&quot; Eileen stated. &quot;And they think Becca is watching us. They didn&#39;t know she was going camping this weekend. So if anyone gets in trouble it&#39;ll be her.&quot; Jill took this in, nodding as she shyly glanced at Ty. Still the young blond teen was nervous. She had never been around a boy in just her pj&#39;s.<br />
<br />
Ty smirked as he gazed at the pair. They appeared to be on equal footing now, a trio of Freshman hanging out. While Jill appeared quite nervous, Eileen was doing her best to put on a confident front. The dynamic shift was interesting, Ty now pondering what to do next.</p>
