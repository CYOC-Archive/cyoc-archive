<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the evening was giving way to night in Havana, Ekyss was enjoying herself in her bathhouse. As she lounged in the steaming pool the size of half a basketball court in her naked body three members of her harem trended to her treatment, each a former miserable human until Ekyss founded them and gave them new purpose. Trimming her feet sat a female satyr with light brown colored furred goat legs and shaggy Bob cut hair, small feminine figure with large size DD breasts and a round cute face, a former trans woman who was looking for true femininity, a gift Ekyss was more than willingly to give in return for her submission. Scrubbing her wings a blonde furred Minotaur with muscles of a bodybuilder, a two foot wide horn span and a dick the size of a policeman’s baton, a shrimp of a man before meeting Ekyss who desired strength beyond any other man which was granted in return for eternal servitude. Final treating her hands a naga of extraordinary beauty, a ten foot long slim black scale viper like tail making her lower body, a slender upper frame holding C cup breasts and almost needle like fingernails, her head had long silky smooth black hair that reached the bottom of her waist, sharp angular facial features, green slit eyes and a long forked tongue that could do wonderful things for Ekyss, a sexually repressed daughter of a catholic family, Ekyss gave her the chance to live out every fantasy she ever had and all she asked in return was to experience those fantasy with her. As Ekyss bathed in her luxury bath being pampered by three of her lovers she thought how much she deserved this the stress of the the last couple of weeks had been taking a toll on her and although she loved playing the game it could be so tiring sometimes. Just than the naga completed her tasked with her mistress’ hand and gently float a foot away while patiently awaiting her award as Ekyss examined her handiwork. Perfect like all things her naga does Ekyss thought soon returning the hand to it caretaker so it may bring her closer to her master. As they closed distance their lips meet in a passion filled kiss the naga’s tongue doing circles in Ekyss’ mouth when apart that magnificent tongue would delicately caress Ekyss’ horns, neck and breast the tips of the forked tongue just ever so tickling the nipple before returning to another kiss. The great tails of both participants entwining each other that go on to massage each other bodies until the tips of the tails began to climb into one another’s vaginal cavities switching as each one just reach the moment of release. The Satyr and the Minotaur looked jealously at the sexual activity than quickly redoubled their efforts at their pampering tasks so that they may join in the festivities. This was truly paradise Ekyss thought three beautiful creature at her beck and call willing to do anything to please her and her naga was now rubbing her G-spot with her tail tip building the release she so desire that will lift weeks of stress, frustration and disappointment. Just as the moment came for that wonderful orgasm to commence, an aide from her governmental staff barged into the room foiling the moment and drawing the attention of all of her pets. “Your majesty, urgent....” the young aide froze in his spot as he started to struggle to breath. “If I remembered correctly I said I was not to be disturbed no matter what until I returned” Ekyss said menacingly as she slowly rose from the pool the steam slowly turned into a thin lining bathrobe only her harem were worthy to the pleasures of her body not this bureaucratic imbecile, as she turned to face the aide violet light was clearly seen pulsing through her veins and eyes “you have ten seconds to explain why you have ruined my leisure time or I’ll squeeze you so hard that they’ll have to only use a mop to clean up the mess.” The young panicking aide soon found himself able to breath once more then as fast as possible respond to his empress “The UN representative has returned from New York to bring news of your application please forgive me for my intrusion most divine empress” Ekyss mood sudden shifted from anger to possibility as the violet light subsided releasing the aide from her magic “this is wonderful news my child, now leave before I change my mind” she sweetly responded causing the aide to flee with most haste. Ekyss then turned back to the pool where her harem awaits ever sad eyed she then kneeled down to them and in a melancholy voice “I am so sorry my darlings but the world calls me away from you once again but if things go as well as I think we maybe celebrating in the bedchamber instead I may even summon the Harpy and the Troll to join us. So wait for me in the bedchamber will you” she then gently kissed each of them on the head as they all replied with “yes Mistress” then quickly leaving the bath. Ekyss then left soon after moving to a private changing room to appear more formally before her guest. There she retrieve Harbinger and used her magic to change her simple bathrobe into an elegant long black fade into silver at the bottom gown with platinum shoulder pieces, bracers, horn decoration and necklaces. Upon entering her throne room she saw several of her ministers waiting before her next to the throne in a large arched chamber where in front of the throne a middle aged man in a three piece suits stands. Ekyss goes to sit on the throne, a large metal structure with the back board decorated with multiple dragon head sculptures and lush cushions for the user, she then stares down the man in front of her they have met multiple times over the course of her UN application they tend to look down upon conquerors but considering she has taken over all of the Caribbean, Mexico and Central America along with a good portion of the Southern US they are started to rethink that notion. She may have beauty, power, respect, an army, a nation and a harem of the most exotic creatures of the world she desires you more thing, recognition. “So upon your terms you represented to the United Nations you requested full membership, a permanent position on the security council and Economic and Social Council for the Empire of Dracon, if am correct, have been discuss” the man sweated profusely as he spoke “it has come to by the assembly that the decision by delayed for another month to deal with more pressing matters”. “What” Ekyss laid dumbstruck she had over the last 20 years overthrown nations, reestablish governments and armies and brought a level of stability to a region that it hasn’t seen in centuries and now when she asks to be recognized by the world of her accomplishments they say there going to ignore her “what do you mean delay the decision I have waited and proposed the matter for three months and they think there are more important matters. I have wiped tens of nations off the map, the most powerful nation in the world surrendered to me, I brought magic out of hiding what could be more important than this” she then stood up from her throne and walked toward the representative as she did so the shadows in the room started to crawl toward the man as if they were alive, her eyes burning with violet energy she then angrily spoke up “who is it that’s delaying this, is it the Americans for their bruised pride 5 years ago, is the governments in exile whose claim to power is their now forgotten nations, the magic authority for revealing magic while they hoard it to themselves, you will tell me or you will never be seen again you hear me”. The UN representative was shaking before the mighty empress as he knew she will deliver on her threats as always “South America more prospectively Columbia, Brazil and Argentina they fear if you grow more influential you will invade them like the other Latin American countries” Ekyss soon dismissed the man and turned to her ministers “call the whole harem to my chambers immediately” at this time they knew something serious was happening she only ever calls the whole harem when she celebrated her greatest successes like the conquest of Mexico or moments of greatest frustration such when the US attacked. As she strode through the vast halls of her palace she kept her composure the entire way so no aide, servant or guard could see their empress lose control as soon as the door to her chamber was in view she saw the menagerie of creatures her harem was made of about two dozen different and unique specimens all lovingly devoted to her. As the door closed behind Ekyss threw herself into a rage destroying half of the furniture before tossing herself on the massive central circular bed whereupon her harem came to calm her showing her their love and loyalty. She quickly spot her naga grabbing and her brought close “we have something to finish you and I” she said softly then kissed her deeply while violently tearing off the gown she was wearing. Tonight she was going to fuck every last one of her harem and then more just so today wasn’t for nothing. And to ensure privacy this time she placed a spell on the door to her chamber that will kill anyone who enters without her permission. The problems of the UN can wait until tomorrow where she will decide what to do, for now she will only surround herself in blissful love.</p>
