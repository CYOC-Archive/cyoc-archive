<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A minute or two passed before George looked up at them again. “Rip of his clothes, he will need them in an altered form later. But don´t let go of him.”<br />
Eric´s eyes widened in even more fear, but he could do nothing as Johnny used his free hand, the one not holding his arms up, to rip of his shirt first. But while that was simple, Eric´s jeans were not. At least, to a normal human. Johnny´s body could just as easily rip the jeans apart, as he did with the shirt. The only difference was the pain Eric felt from it, as the cloth of the jeans pulled tighter before ripping. As Johnny wasn´t gentle, he nearly broke Eric´s feet when he removed his shoes.<br />
Now naked, with his clothes on the ground next to them, Eric shivered. It wasn´t too warm out here, and his fear added to everything as well. “A fit body at least. That is a good base for your new form. Spray him. And make sure some of the liquid is on the ground as well.” George said, commanding Johnny to petrify Eric.<br />
But it wasn´t only Johnny. While Johnny spit a good amount of the liquid onto Eric´s body, little Ryan started to drool onto his head, and Eric learned quickly the drool was the same liquid as what Johnny spit on him. It didn´t take long for the brothers to petrify Eric, who looked horrified and disgusted from the process. <br />
Still grinning, George ordered: “Now, gargoyles, release the statue carefully and retake your positions. Statue, stand at attention after being released.” It had something demeaning that he wouldn´t order the former humans by name, but simply called them as what they are right now. And a petrified human was a statue, after all.<br />
Johnny sat Eric down before unwinding his tail, and then let go of his arms. Ryan easily grabbed onto Johnny´s arms and let himself be pulled back, and let himself get carried over to their pedestal, before going down to his original spot. Mentally, Ryan was embarrassed that he let himself be carried by his younger brother like he was a baby. Johnny had no problem with Ryan´s weight, easily retaking his position. But he was still crying inside for Eric´s fate.<br />
Eric had no chance to flee, because he had no control of his body. He easily followed the command of the stranger that captured them, standing at attention before the man. Begging to wake up from this nightmare.<br />
“Lucky for me, I don´t need anything from you, my body is good as it is. I won´t need to get a stone-coating to transfer anything from you. So, either we repurpose a bit, or it will go away without need. Let´s see.” George said as he walked around the statue of Eric, knowing what he would become. He could let him grow bigger from the other two morons after he had them here. Small amounts of stone he could take from the ground, or let go there, if not needed.<br />
Like he had for Ryan, George pushed Eric´s head down a bit, so Eric could see his dick and balls, now perfectly curved out of stone, fully erect. He would be blushing, if he still could. Why had he become erect right before turning into stone? He had no idea that was part of the petrification, as it needed these parts in full size.<br />
“We will make it a bit smaller, after all, we need some material on the other end., And it´s not like we will see much of it when we are finished, anyway.” George said grinning. He touched the very tip of Eric´s stone member with his thumb and started to push. Much to Eric´s horror, his cock gave way, becoming shorter until his tormentor was satisfied. Around a third of his cock-length went away, followed by a bit of its volume when George squeezed it. He did the same squeezing with Eric´s balls, making them about a third smaller as well.<br />
At the same time, unseen by Eric, something had pushed out on his ass, and while his manhood was shrunken smaller, a cord-like tail grew out, and when his balls were squeezed smaller, a tuft of stony fur grew out of the tip.<br />
“There, that wasn´t so bad, right?” Geroge laughed at Eric, patting him on his ass before slowly moving his finger down the new tail. Eric felt weird from that. It was a part he never had before, but it felt like the stranger was touching his cock all the same.<br />
Without saying anything, George willed the water on the ground to raise and change Eric´s body like he had for the others. The clothes that had been ripped on the ground had become stone in the liquid, now looked like a stone board. But it would only be needed after Eric was changed.<br />
The water slowly creeped up on Eric, and where it had been, his body had changed. His feet, the first to be submerged by the water, had deformed. His toes had merged into one solid mass, with a small rift in the middle, forming into cloven-like hooves. That had his body raising, as he now stood on said hooves, his former toes, while the rest of his feet had become part of his legs. His legs had become slightly bulgier, forming powerful calves in the stone.<br />
His already shrunken cock and balls had simply been swapped over, lightly remolded to look like a bull, but not changed in size anymore. The newly grown tail had twitched as it´s tuft had become a bit bigger, hanging down behind him. His stomach and chest, already looking strong, had like his legs gained more profile, each little bit bulging with muscles carved into the stone.<br />
The hands had deformed, with his pinky and ring finger merging inside the stone, as well as the pointer finger and thumb, while his middle finger swelled bigger, leaving him with three thick fingers on each hand. His arms had also bulged up, putting any body-builder to shame.<br />
As the water reached Eric´s head, it was reformed as well. A short muzzle formed, quite like the one both Ryan and Johnny had gained, only with a wider nose, and thicker, blunt teeth slightly showing between his lips. His eyes had become wider, while his ears become smaller but longer, while moving slightly up his head. As a final addition, two bulky and deadly pointed horns grew on his forehead, between the ears and above his eyes. They had formed from his hair, which had completely vanished under the light fur carving covering his body. All the remaining water than flowed into Eric´s mouth, and seconds later, there was no indication there had been any water at all.<br />
Where Eric had stood now stood a naked minotaur nearly the same size Eric had been before, still looking horrified and disgusted by everything that had happened to him.<br />
“Looking good there, if a little small for such a bull. Well, maybe you will gain a bit from your missing friends. I think they will be on the smaller side in the end. But let´s give you something fitting, bull.” George said, slapping lightly at the bulky shoulders of Eric.<br />
As if summoned, the board that had been his clothes sprung onto him, quickly surrounding his waist in a ring of stone. Down in the front, hiding his small cock and balls away, the stone flowed done, forming a loincloth. Ironically, just in front of his hidden genitals, the loincloth swung forward, as if to hide a way bigger gear than what was really there.<br />
George grinned at the minotaur, before it turned into a grimace, needing to finalize Eric´s new form with his new position. “Bull, fix that dumb disgusted face and take your position on the pedestal opposite the gargoyles. You need to look threatening, not like you just got a whiff on someone’s dirty ass.”<br />
Eric had no chance as his body moved, climbing onto the pedestal before facing the gargoyle that was Johnny. Just in the corner of his view he also saw Ryan´s little form standing before his once little brother, growling, and showing his teeth. Johnny wasn´t better, also snarling with a pose that showed a brutality the little boy never had. Eric himself felt his face moving, as if he wanted to bellow angrily, but no sound left him. His left arm in front of him, while his right was behind, as if swinging something. His hooves stood firm, the right one a bit before the left one.<br />
“Much better, bull. We will need a weapon for you. If your group had another little twerp, I would have made that kid your weapon, but as there isn´t, I will find something else. On the other side, if there had been a second twerp, it would be far more likely he had become the big bull, and you would be his weapon, bull. Your other friends already have their fate planned, and neither is material for a weapon, anyway. Now, I will go looking for them, don´t run away on me.” George said laughing at his joke, already walking back towards the manor. <br />
Johnny cried over Eric´s fate, but felt ease that none of his friends were with them. At least they wouldn´t end up as Eric´s weapon, some inanimate object with no remaining “living” part to them. What if that would erase them from being? Not that he felt much like a living being, trapped as a gargoyle, anyway.<br />
Ryan, standing in the shadow of his once little brother, had to look at Eric´s imposing form. He felt so little and helpless, something he never felt since he was a little kid. But right now, he was nothing else to the world. Trapped as a little, kid-sized gargoyle. In a way, he would have been happy to switch with Eric for that. <br />
Eric himself had gotten an image of how he looked from the former gargoyle, and felt like shit. Yes, he had always wanted such muscles, but not the way they were now, trapped in stone. He hoped that Mike and Sei got away, but he knew they would soon join them. And from the way it had said, they both would end up small and unimportant. Maybe they would become kobolds or something else small. Who knows but the stranger.</p>
