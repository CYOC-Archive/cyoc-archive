<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">John managed to make it through one episode before he heard the key in the lock. He was nervous, but his newly enlarged member gave him confidence that he had fixed his current predicament. If not, the lewd anime he was watching was likely to cause a much bigger fight than they had earlier that day...<br />
<br />
As the door swung open, he glanced up with a quick &quot;Hi honey!&quot; before focusing back on his show. Out of the corner of his eye, he noted the subtle changes in the way that Sharon appeared. What would have been pristine and neat was now slightly less sterile. Her shirt showed a few wrinkles when it didn&#39;t before she left. He knew that should be driving Sharon nuts, but she didn&#39;t even seem to notice. She also had a very slight slouch, like she&#39;d gotten the stick out of her ass that was driving a wedge in their relationship. John idly wondered if he&#39;d be able to put a cold drink on the coffee table without a coaster and avoid her wrath. Baby steps...<br />
<br />
John observed a mixture of emotions on his partner&#39;s face as she took off her jacket and set her belongings in the other room. She still hadn&#39;t told him &#39;hi&#39; from walking in the door. -*Then again, if I wanted her to worship me on sight, I would have just added it to her profile*-<br />
<br />
As she walked back into the room, she looked a little more comfortable, but still not the whip-cracker that she had been before. She still hadn&#39;t noticed the hugely-endowed heroines that John was watching jiggle across the screen--or the fact that it was an anime. &quot;Hey...John?&quot; she started. John looked at her, and saw the ice princess thawing. She had a look of genuine regret on her face. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah Share?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry I was so upset at you earlier. I did a lot of thinking while I was out, and it was unfair to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure I understand, what&#39;s unfair?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I always get super pissy at you when your eyes wander. I mean, don&#39;t I satisfy you? Doesn&#39;t my body please you enough? So why would you look at other girls?&quot; Her fists clenched at her side and he watched her bristle up. Before he could respond. &quot;But the truth is...I&#39;m just getting angry to hide my real feelings. I&#39;ve been so wound up since we moved in together...I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m just afraid you&#39;re going to get sick of me or my plain body...&quot; John was shocked. Even though he tried his hardest to stress just how sexy he found her during sex (in spite of reality-changing opportunities in the other room), apparently it had never quite gotten through to her vulnerabilities yet.<br />
<br />
&quot;I could never! I&#39;m sorry, my eyes just wander! I seriously can&#39;t help myself.&quot; He found himself apologizing again. It was the truth that he had given her before, and she hadn&#39;t been having any of it.<br />
<br />
&quot;No. Don&#39;t apologize. I want to apologize. I know you can&#39;t help yourself. Umm.....&quot; she shifted in place, visibly uncomfortable, &quot;I...I decided to tell you a secret, but I&#39;m scared of how you&#39;ll react.&quot; -*Here it comes*- He thought, grinning internally.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go on, I promise it will only make me love you more.&quot; Sharon blushed, scarlet staining her normally lightly-tanned cheeks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;m kind of jealous of girls with big...you know. Breasts. But like...I also kinda...feel a little...flustered? by them. But I feel unfaithful to you when I get those feelings, so I project that weird morality onto you I guess?&quot; -*Jackpot*- John let the warmth of his internal smile glimpse through.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hon, there&#39;s no need to be jealous. I&#39;m not kidding when I say I don&#39;t think anyone can ever compete with your bedroom performance if that&#39;s what you&#39;re concerned about.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sharon turned redder. &quot;That&#39;s...not quite it. You see, when I was a little girl--before I hit puberty--I really dreamed of having big breasts like Angelina Jolie, and some beautiful models I saw in my brother&#39;s magazines.&quot; -*What kind of magazines did her brother have that she thought were normal???*- &quot;But when I grew up, I got stuck with these mosquito bites.&quot; Sharon grabbed her B-cup chest with both hands and gave a squeeze. &quot;But since I didn&#39;t get them, I always dreamed of what it would have been like to have bigger breasts, or to just wake up with bigger breasts one day. It&#39;s become something of a private time fantasy you could say.&quot; She looked down and slowly rung her hands together. The Chronivac had rewritten her reality nicely, taking into account every factor John had entered.<br />
<br />
Just then, a sensual moan echoed over the speakers of the TV. John and Sharon both turned to look at the source. The main heroine was getting her clothing ripped off by the female villain, who was flaunting her massive melons while monologing about the heroine&#39;s failure--typical anime bs. This was the real test, as Sharon was watching Anime for the first time.<br />
<br />
&quot;What...is this? Is this what you watch when I&#39;m not around?&quot; Sharon asked, a tone of shock in her voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Only sometimes. Why, they&#39;re not real girls, so no harm right?&quot; He grinned.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I can see why you&#39;re into this stuff. The artwork is beautiful and the characters seem appealing.&quot; That was much faster than John had anticipated. He watched Sharon&#39;s eyes follow every jiggle of the main character&#39;s bare breasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why don&#39;t you come sit next to me and we can watch the next few episodes together?&quot; he gestured to the space around him. &quot;Go ahead and settle in. Get the next episode started, I&#39;ve seen the next one before. I&#39;m going to the kitchen to get a drink. You want something?&quot; He was going to make a few small changes. He could go nuts, or he could play it safe. He always looked forward to the day he could share an anime with his girlfriend, but his girthy meat monster was looking to be liberated from his pants--and soon. He was ready to take the extra length for a test-drive.</p>
