<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">That night as Tim - and the loitering, still intrigued Nathan - started to head off back to their roll-up beds for some shut eye, both couldn&#39;t help but think of things they&#39;d seen and done that night. Tim was worried as he walked back to his tent he might very well have imbibed a slow acting poison during his thirsty episode. He didn&#39;t want to end up going home early and losing credit for this - as well as any chance at getting laid with a hot Greek babe, let alone losing some of or even all his gains. Nathan on the other hand was more preoccupied with the effects of the water, the strange lights he saw, and then the distracting sensations still racing across his body...<br />
<br />
Indeed, Nathan watched the shirtless Tim preparing for bed - occasionally ruminating on the foolishness of the oafish son of his boss, but more frequently thinking about just how alarmingly sexy that oafish son really was. Nathan lightly bit his lip as he lingered in the dark, observing through a tiny opening in the flap of the tent as Tim walked around his tent - shirtless as could be. That tight, mostly hairless muscled torso almost shimmering. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck, I---I know I&#39;m not gay,&quot; Nathan murmured to himself, &quot;But fuck, I&#39;d love to just---&quot; He blushed a little bit as he quivered on his feet. The sensations had not yet fully abated, the tightness of his shirt against his chest outright making Nathan hump into his hand when he reached down to try and rearrange his groin. The erection just becoming so insistent and engorged that he thought he could feel a bead of precum when he touched it.<br />
<br />
Leaving Tim to his designs, Nathan went ahead toward his own tent. He didn&#39;t want to chance being discovered - but more than that, he wanted the privacy to enjoy some good old fashioned masturbation. While he&#39;d had his fair share of sex, tonight he knew he needed his own company - to explore and engage with these thrumming sensations.<br />
<br />
By the time Nathan got back to his tent, about five tents down from Tim&#39;s, he promptly stripped naked not even a moment after climbing inside. Barely even checking as he prioritized nudity above even fully closing up his tent flap. But once he was good and looking down at his hard cock, Nathan turned, shivering, and closed the flap up. He wanted no distractions - except, maybe, if the distraction was Tim swaggering inside to suck him off or do some frottage.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Tim himself was dealing with the heavy sensations of arousal that had seemed to have followed him since his walk out to that pool. <br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t want to just pump out a load by himself, and he didn&#39;t know if Sarah might be down for a little action...but without one of the ladies from the port town, and without any other option to relieve the tension, it was looking increasingly like this was something Tim was gonna have to take care of himself. Before long, his boxers landed over by his suitcase full of his clothes, and Tim fell on to the bed, wrapping a hand around his generously sized cock and calling up memories of his best porn from back home.<br />
<br />
Thus did Tim end up wiling away his night tussling with his manhood. However it seemed like even though he brought himself to the edge of orgasm, he couldn&#39;t quite push himself over the edge yet. He was so hard, so aroused, it was maddening, but the night dragged on - and Tim was getting tired. His body coated in sweat and hot already, he kicked off the sheet and fell asleep before long - manhood still sticking up.<br />
<br />
<i>Tim dreamed of something almost but not quite like the camaraderie of his sports team. A warriors&#39; gathering. People assembled and joking and cavorting - but when he looked around, Tim saw them as almost completely androgynous - it was just as easy to see them as women as it was to see them as men. They were confusing, and what was more, they teased arousal up in him. Somehow he knew he still needed to get off. There was something so intrinsically fulfilling about this sort of gathering...</i><br />
<br />
<i>Tim joined in a wrestling event, and found himself taking part in an increasingly sweaty medley of his fellow athletes, laughing and moaning even as they rolled around on the hard floor of some ancient looking colosseum. Tim felt himself sinking into the mass of muscled, powerful people on the floor. At some point, the wrestling became lewd, even erotic - Tim felt his cock plunge into a pussy, felt wet lips smack against his own, felt strong hands grip his...pecs? Breasts? And then gasped as he felt his own pussy being---!! &quot;But I&#39;m---I&#39;m a man!&quot; He feebly protested, but he felt so damned good---</i><br />
<br />
The shock of his orgasm shook Tim awake in the early hours of the morning, gasping and gripping the sides of his bed as his straining cock pumped over and over again. His load falling through the air on to his abs and dripping down, catching in his small trail of hair near his groin. Tim looked up, shook, and tried to get back to bed.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, earlier, Nathan fell into a fitful sleep, frustrated by his own conflicted opinion on Tim and what he really wanted. It would be so much easier to just take a day off once they had some time and fuck his way through the women in that port town. The wantons in the tavern had not been subtle during his last visit. But he just as well felt a yearning for Tim, for a different kind of sexual fulfillment than what he had ever known.<br />
<br />
As Nathan slept, he too would find himself dreaming.<br />
<br />
<i>Nathan dreamed of Timothy, the two of them in the gym at the college campus. He could see every inch of beautiful, tanned jock boy flesh. For some reason they were both naked - and nobody minded. At first, their date was a chaste one. The two of them spending their time working out, but every exercise seemed to contain at least a little bit of a double entendre. Squats, hip thrusts, donkey calf raises, so on - all of them enticing Nathan forward. &quot;You...want me,&quot; Timothy teased him, &quot;You wanna fuck me! Don&#39;t you? You&#39;ve been staring this whole set!&quot;</i><br />
<br />
<i>&quot;I do...fuck, I do!&quot;</i> <br />
<br />
And that was the end of the prelude. Their lips crashed together, and Nathan&#39;s hands found the brilliantly muscled form of Timothy&#39;s body. Felt every inch of tight, powerfully built muscle. The two of them pressed up against the mirror, and when Nathan licked and sucked at Tim&#39;s nipple, the jock let out a sharp exhale. &quot;Now...&quot; Tim loomed a bit, and Nathan felt excited. Anticipating something amazing. But what he got was something he couldn&#39;t have been prepared for. &quot;I&#39;m gonna fuck you good, Nathan.&quot;</i><br />
<br />
<i>When Nathan felt that hard, generously sized cock ram into him, he thought he was being fucked in the ass. But then he saw it. Felt somewhat different. And then he screamed, &quot;You----Ohh! You&#39;re fucking me in the---!!&quot; He didn&#39;t even need to say it. His wet pussy dripped with anticipation as Tim plunged in, over---and---over!!</i><br />
<br />
And so Nathan surged awake, almost too conveniently at the same time as Tim awoke from his own sexually confused dreams. Not knowing what to make of those dreams and their notions...but even as they settled into waking, the dreams faded - as dreams were wont to do. Before long, as the two got ready for some breakfast and early morning activity, they only remembered one thing of their dreams...<br />
<br />
<i>Fuck, that was hot, whatever it was.</i></p>
