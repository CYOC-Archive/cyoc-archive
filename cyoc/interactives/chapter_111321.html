<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">For the first couple days, Mike consistently visited the medicine cabinet to rub Jeff into his armpits again. Mike&#39;s body odor was strong every single time. Jeff tried to fall into a routine ad get used to it, but it wasn&#39;t possible. Everytime Jeff was used, he was forced face first into Mike&#39;s unbelievably smelly armpit ad rubbed up and down through Mike&#39;s huge thick bush of armpit hair. Inevitably, Jeff&#39;s applicator face was always left with some beads of stinky sweat and some long thick armpit hairs stuck to him. He was capped up, trapping the smell in until the next time he was opened. Jeff would then be unceremoniously put into the cabinet where it was shut. Jeff would be plunged into darkness until he was used again; He could do nothing but sit in the dark, trapped with the musky underarm bo and several of his brother&#39;s thick armpit hairs sticking to and tickling his face. It seemed like Mike didn&#39;t like to take showers, either. He seemed content with just using deodorant to cover up his musky smell. It didn&#39;t work at all, and it meant Mike&#39;s pits always reeked for Jeff. It was awful, degrading, and embarassing! Why did he chose a full week of this change!<br />
<br />
On the third day, Mike pulled Jeff out, uncapped him, and rubbed him through his smelly armpit bushes. Jeff was capped up, but he wasnt placed back in the cabinet. Mike threw him into a dirty gym bag and left with the bag. Jeff was in darkness in the gym bag. All he knew was that he was being jostled around and taken somewhere. It stunk pretty bad in here as well. God, Couldn&#39;t Mike learn some basic hygeine rules!<br />
<br />
Finally after a while, Mike opened the bag and light blinded Jeff. as his eyes adjusted he saw he was in the locker room at school. Mike was getting ready for practice; Mike was shirtless and Jeff could clearly see his hairy chest and hairy underarms. Jeff shuddered, knowing he would soon he rubbed through his armpit. Mike grabbed Jeff, uncaped him, and applied his deodorant again. Jeff rubbed the stinky armpit face first. He was screaming internally. He would never get used to this.<br />
<br />
After Jeff was capped he was set on the locker room bench. He heard a voice behind him; &quot;Hey, Mike, how are you buddy!&quot;. Jeff recognized the voice. It was Cody! He was a huge linebacker on the football team with Mike. &quot;Hey, Cody, Whats up dude!&quot;, Mike exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I have a favor to ask. I forgot my deodorant at home. Mind if I use yours?&quot;, Cody asked. He lifted up an arm and theatrically sniffed one of his pits. If Jeff had eyes, they would have bulged out; Cody had the hairiest pits he had ever seen. Mike grabbed Jeff and tossed him through the air; &quot;Sure thing, big guy. I have more at home. Why don&#39;t you just have that&quot;. Cody smiled and said &quot;Thanks dude&quot;.<br />
<br />
Cody uncapped Jeff and lifted up an arm. &quot;Oh no! Mike was bad enough, but at least I was getting kind of used to it!&quot;. Jeff&#39;s face was unceremoniusly shoved into the Cody&#39;s hairy pit and rubbed roughly up and down. He felt the thick hairs dragging across his face. Cody smelled even worse than Mike! Uggh! Jeff only had a second of relief before he was plunged into the other armpit. Cody capped up Jeff.<br />
<br />
Cody looked at the deodorant applicator in his hand. &quot;Eh, I have deodorant at home. Might as well let someone who needs it now use it. Cosy sauntered over to a counter and set him down. Jeff gulped when he was the sign over the counter; &quot;communal toiletries&quot;.<br />
<br />
A few minutes after Cody walked away, he was another football player walk over to him. He was halfway between taking off his sweaty gear. &quot;Oh sweet! I forgot my deo!&quot;, he said. He grabbed Jeff and rubbed him into his armpits over and over.<br />
<br />
Jeff was used repeatedly, all day, every day in the locker room. Jeff found out the hard way that not only were the football players a very hairy and stinky bunch, but also very forgetful. He was used by so many people so many times he lost count. Jeff was in hell. Each person&#39;s body odor mingled with the previous, making it smell even worse. He had many different people&#39;s pit hairs stuck to his face as well! It was beyond disgusting. Being forced to smell and taste a whole football team worth of armpits was not at all what Jeff would consider a nice day!<br />
<br />
On the seventh day, Jeff just wanted to die. He was in hell! Just then, he heard a noise in his head. &quot;Transformation Duration complete: Restoring subject &#39;Jeff&#39;&quot;. &quot;Yes! I am turning back! And now I know not to make a stupid transformation like this again!&quot;. <br />
<br />
Then, Jeff&#39;s heart sank as he heard &quot;ERROR ERROR. Subject is not able to be restored. Subject &#39;Jeff&#39; is not 100% complete. Subject&#39;s current state is now permanent. Thank you for using the Chronivac 4.0&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;NOOOO!&quot; Jeffs screamed mentally! &quot;Im trapped as a stick of deodorant forever! Please no!&quot;. Jeff thoughts were racing; not 100% complete? Why not. He suddenly realized. Every time he is used, a bit of his deodorant body is transferred to the armpit of his user!<br />
<br />
Jeff felt utter despair. He coud never be human again. Just then he was rougly picked up and was shoved into yet another smelly pit. Jeff was filled with utter despair as he now resigned himself to his fate...</p>
