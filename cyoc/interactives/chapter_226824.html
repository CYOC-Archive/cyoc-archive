<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Several years have passed since the fury flu that turned humanity into furies. The few that survived soon fell to a second wave thanks to coming down with the newer versions of the common cold and flu. Those that still stubbornly held onto their hatred at being replaced as the dominate species felt the quickest way out was to eat a bullet. The half billion or so humans who managed to eke out a life after the first pandemic soon fell closer to the brink of extinction. The four billion plus furies were clearly in charge and the remnants of humanity were finally starting to realize it.<br />
<br />
It was around 2026 when the largest human enclave in the United States endured an insurrection from within. A power struggle between two factions, one who still believes that a cure to reverse the fury flu could be found and reestablish humanity at the top of the food chain. The other faction was willing to work with the fury government; knowing full well that it was only a matter of time before they themselves become furies or worse. This form of unrest did not go unnoticed by the new fury national guard who was instructed to leave the enclave be, so long as they didn’t try to hunt furies as they did during the early days of national unrest. Being given orders to enter the compound and stop the blood bath, resulted in the militant humans to turn their guns on the furies and try to gun them down. While the first dozen or so were killed; the remaining furies were quick to counter the assault with their magic runes, rendering the guns useless as several furies allowed their inhibitions to come through and started rutting and turning humans into furies.<br />
<br />
When the fighting was over, the dead humans and furies were soon laid to rest while those human’s who surrendered or were captured/arrested were processed and sent to a prison. Their fate was being held by a frustrated anthro otter fury who managed to get re-elected to the white house. She wanted to offer them amnesty if they agreed to convert while a few senators and the governor of Wyoming wanted them to spend time in prison thinking about their actions. The militant ringleader of the anti-fury faction opted to eat a bullet prior to capture; hoping to become a martyr to other human survivors the world over as they try to fight back the inevitable. in the end the president compromised; offering clemency to those that didn’t try to fight back while those who were arrested for assault/murder were sent to prison after their trials were concluded. Those incarcerated soon found out that the concrete walls and bars would not protect them from the new cold and flu viruses. One by one those incarcerated soon became furies.<br />
<br />
Henry Knotlock, a Doberman fury who was once a rebellious teenager that kept skipping school had to grow up quickly. After losing his mother to the fury virus; her being morbidly obese put in such poor health that the fury virus could not uplift her, left him without a parental figure. His father he assumed ran out on him and his mother, only to find out that he was arrested for drug trafficking and charged for the attempted murder of a police officer; despite not shooting the officer, he was charged regardless as an accessory. When Henry found out, he was incensed that the deputy that has been dogging him throughout his childhood was the one who was involved in sending his father to prison. The Doberman fury eventually tried to contact FDC SeaTac in Seattle Washington only to find out that his father was killed in a prison riot during the fury flu outbreak. Now without a mother or a father, the Doberman Fury had to go it alone in life. While he had a mate; a green feathered parakeet fury by the name of Elly. She was two years younger than him but he did love her and helped to thaw his cold heart to those he had little patience for. Her older sister Penny; a mute swan fury was living with Rudolph, Henry’s only friend and a cardinal fury. Henry’s other friends; Slag a copperhead fury and Lankey a koala fury were killed by a couple of human’s who wanted to try and assassinate the head of the CDC, Denise Proudhoof. Now Henry had to struggle as he did his best to be the best father he could be; his mate Elly recently gave birth to their son, a Doberman fury who takes after his father. Rudolph and Penny likewise also became parents with a daughter who took after Penny, a mute swan fury.<br />
<br />
The Heartpaw, Soulfang and Proudhoof families had new additions to their respective families. Edward and his mate Julian welcomed into the world a son. An anthro cougar fury who took after Jullian, also a cougar fury.  Lucas and Rachael Soulfang were not to be outdone as they announced the birth of twin boys who while wolf furies like their father, both had white fur with a touch of tawny brown at the ears and tails. Meanwhile Denise and Michael also welcomed their own cub. A tiny anthro tigress cub that looked like her mother save for her belly and chest having the same color fur as her father instead of the traditional white fur with black stripes that tigers typically have. These new cubs made for a more festive family gathering as everyone couldn’t help but dote and spoil the four additions. Even their older siblings had a soft spot for the cubs despite having their own to look after.<br />
<br />
For Brittany Soulfang-Proudhoof and her mate Jake Proudhoof; Dusk and Dawn were a pawful for the couple. The rambunctious male charcoal fur wolf fury named Dusk running around causing mayhem while Dawn; a doe-deer fury was apt to playing subtle pranks on everyone she could get a rise out of. Fortunately for Brittany and Jake, their twin cubs have yet to be able to cast magic; the revelation that that ability won’t happen until puberty gave the two time to reign in the six year old imps as they have been aptly nick named.<br />
<br />
For Allison Heartpaw-Proudhoof and Jimmy Proudhoof, their son was more reserved then Dusk and Dawn. The anthro cougar fury preferring to spend time reading or taking walks in the woods. Jimmy J.R recently came home with a Siamese seal point cat with chocolate paws and blue eyes that he picked up at the local animal shelter. Finding the cat’s personality very outgoing, he was eventually named Dickens due to that fact that the cat was being very mischievous and outgoing. Constantly jumping on laps and climbing up to high spots only to squawk loudly at needing rescuing. The two became inseparable all the while Dickens kept finding was to wake up both Allison and Jimmy Sr in the morning while they tried to sleep. Neither could lash out at the cat as its meows and purrs kept melting their hearts when its tiny paws kept pressing on them.<br />
<br />
Allison eventually finished her college education getting a degree in nursing; while Brittany’s career path turned to being a teacher. Finding she was good at inspiring the youth at the local high school, she soon got her teaching certificate and was slowly working her way from being a substitute teacher for the school district to a more permanent position. A position that would afford her more time to be with her family and a chance to teach history as well as continue on as a gym coach.<br />
<br />
Alex Voltsnout a spotted hyena fury and his mate Darlene, an artic fox fury eventually left town. First heading to West Virginia to visit Alex’s family, before eventually settling down near Bracebridge Ontario. Alex’s visit home was heartwarming, he reconnected with a few cousins he lost track when he was attending college in Washington. He was saddened when the fury virus took his father from him. The man working as a coal miner to support his family was on medical disability after coming down with black lung. The fury virus eventually struck him and caused his heart to give out as his body could not handle the stresses from within. Leaving Alex’s mother who became a voluptuous pink flamingo fury, while his sister became a hyena fury like him. Both eventually found love thanks to the fury virus and were enjoying a new lease on life. Life was still tough in West Virginia, but thanks to a deposit of rare earth minerals being discovered, jobs came back to the state as the Lanthanum and Neodymium were needed for the electronic components in electric cars. Alex hoped that the new mining techniques used to extract these minerals would have health and safety in the fore front unlike the various fly by night coal mines that once dotted the state.<br />
<br />
Both Alex and Darlene eventually left after saying their good byes for the time being and headed north to be in what is referred to cottage country in Ontario Canada. Darlene inheriting a fortune from a grandmother she never knew she had gave her a new lease on life. It allowed her to finally tell off her father and his trophy wife, a woman who always found a way to belittle her at every opportunity. Letting the two know that her grandmother that her father may have successfully kept out of her life left her with a fortune that would have done to her mother if it wasn’t for father’s ruinous divorce that drove the woman to an early grave. Money, property and a financial portfolio to ensure that Darlene no longer needed to beg for scraps from her father. She promptly cut them out of her life and contemplated ways to financially ruin the two. Alex however reminded her that going down that path would make her no better than her father, so Darlene decided to not do it. Instead she chose to focus on her art; using the scenery of lake Joseph to create scenic backdrops of various fantasy characters she ended up reworking to suit furies and their disdain for clothing. Darlene noticing her fury form was similar to a character she was originally drawing; and artic wolf who wore loose fitting blue pants and a tight matching crop top. Now that character sported blue flames streaking up her arms and legs. A small patch of blue fur made to look like a burning bush situated at the crotch. Darlene had the blue flames on her fur, however the burning blue bush on her crotch was something she couldn’t use her runes for despite Alex encouraging her to express herself more. Instead she opted to have her vulpine ears pierced and several ear rings could be seen weighing the triangular membranes of pink skin and white fur down slightly. Finding having more than three rings per ear was too much to keep her ears from collapsing; Darlene opted to have two gold hoops on one ear and a few studs on another. Alex meanwhile chose to have a few simple paw prints sporadically placed on his light cream fur body in lieu of the dark spots that originally featured prominently. The couple despite their constant rutting still have yet to produce a cub; however both were confident that Darlene would soon go into heat and that would soon result in her womb expanding with life growing within.</p>
