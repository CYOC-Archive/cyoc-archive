<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">This was the third fight this month. John wasn&#39;t even that angry at the fight itself, more sad that Sharon had ended up being such a bitch once they moved in together. They had been dating for nearly two months, and they had decided to take the relationship &quot;to the next level&quot; by moving in together. Unfortunately, upon moving in, Sharon pulled a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, becoming a control freak that micromanaged every inch of -*her*- apartment (even though John was paying half). Even a hair out of place, and John was in for an earful. The only reason he hadn&#39;t full-on bailed out was the sex. It was out of this world, and John was afraid he&#39;d never find sex that good. Even when they were angry and fighting; that just made it more passionate and wild. Though lately the frequency of the angry and fighting had been more than the passionate and wild lovemaking that followed early on.<br />
<br />
This time, John had gotten caught with his eyes wandering to another mall-goer that had a massive rack. Not just &#39;kinda&#39; big; massive melons that could turn a gay man straight, contained in a top struggling to do its job. His gaze didn&#39;t escape Sharon&#39;s eagle eyes, as she huffily raced them through the mall back out to the car and they spent the rest of the ride home arguing. This wasn&#39;t the first time his wandering eyes had gotten him in trouble. The bigger the rack, the angrier Sharon seemed to get. John couldn&#39;t figure it out. It was not like his attraction was anywhere away from Sharon--the quality of sex was more than enough to make up for any shortcomings in her figure. Obviously Sharon didn&#39;t see things the same way.<br />
<br />
So Sharon had left in a tizzy, to go hang out with her friends and complain about what an insensitive asshole John was. Meanwhile, John had a little bit of breathing room at home to relax and play some games. A past-time of his that had to be put on the back-burner while pursuing the relationship with Sharon. He learned a while ago; you don&#39;t get laid talking about video games or anime. Unfortunately these happened to be two of John&#39;s primary sources of entertainment, which was maybe why he had been more on-edge around Sharon lately. He didn&#39;t appreciate having to delegate his hobbies to secretive, sporadic sessions like a kid afraid his mom was going to walk in on him spanking his monkey to a smut mag. He always had to make sure he hid any trace of pixels or animation before Sharon returned.<br />
<br />
As John was setting up, he heard the doorbell ring and his heart sank. Was Sharon home already? He quickly stashed his gaming peripherals in the space under the couch and went for the door. He reached the door as he realized that was impossible, as she wouldn&#39;t bother ringing the bell, and she&#39;d taken her car so she had her house key.<br />
<br />
Opening up the door, he found the package he had drunkenly ordered a few weeks ago, in the aftermath of a particularly nasty fight with Sharon. The first night where they hadn&#39;t had anger sex afterwards, instead she had spent the night out at her friends house while John raided the local liquor store. He had seen a late-night infomercial for something called a &quot;Chronivac.&quot; A device that promised &#39;Amazing life changes!&#39; &#39;at the push of a button!&#39;<br />
<br />
He drunkenly agreed while punching in Sharon&#39;s credit card information. He figured she&#39;d cancel the transaction before it processed through, and he could just blame a virus on her computer or something.<br />
<br />
So here he was, with a miracle machine that promised unbelievable changes to anyone using it. John was sure it was junk meant to be bought by any sucker drunk out of their mind at 2am like he had been. <br />
<br />
A little voice whispered in the back of his mind: -*but what if it&#39;s real?*-<br />
<br />
So John got to work hooking it up. He was surprised; it was its own computer system. He hadn&#39;t seen a computer dedicated to a single use for quite some time. -*It&#39;s probably just gonna load up and be some MSDOS junk*- John thought briefly, connecting the monitor to the chassis and hooking up all the accessories. The only table with enough space was the first thing that could be seen from the front door, so if Sharon got home he&#39;d be in trouble.<br />
<br />
As he booted it up, he was greeted by a clean interface with a brief introduction, informing him of the functionality of the software, and warning that changes made could become irreversible if the device were to be used haphazardly. For a piece of As Seen on TV junk, John found it curious just how heavy they were leaning into their advertised gimmick. Surely nothing could change life as the advertisement had claimed, could it?<br />
<br />
As he clicked &#39;accept&#39; to the warning, a visual readout appeared, showing a perfect recreation of John&#39;s body, minus the clothes! John was a little weirded out, as it even had tiny details like moles and other blemishes that not many people knew about. It was fully detailed; far better graphics than the chassis or the monitor he had received implied.<br />
<br />
Next to the model were a set of parameters. The first being a toggle between &quot;Primary User&quot; and &quot;External Subject.&quot; Judging by the rest of the interface, he could use that to change things about other people? ...that is, if it worked in the first place. So John decided to try it on himself, to see if it was junk as he suspected. He decided to change something small. Something that very few people other than himself would notice otherwise.<br />
<br />
John always had an average sized dick. It wasn&#39;t amazing, but it wasn&#39;t laughable either. He was always a little worried because it appeared a little smaller when he wasn&#39;t stiff, but it measured out about right when he was hard. Thankfully that was what the ladies cared about. Unfortunately, when Sharon saw him one cold morning in the bathroom, she had started making fun of his penis. But god forbid he say anything about her mosquito bites in retort. That had been the first time they had fought this month--thinking back on events.<br />
<br />
Not anymore--at least, if the Chronivac wasn&#39;t junk. And he hoped it wasn&#39;t junk; he wanted to enhance his junk. Looking at the parameters on the Chronivac, it clocked in at exactly 6.02&quot; He adjusted that to a clean 8.00&quot;. Looking over the toggles, he toggled on &quot;similar size flaccid as when aroused&quot;, he could adjust girth, &#39;reality alteration&#39; and &#39;subject awareness&#39; with a subset option of &#39;current user precluded.&#39; He increased the girth ever-so-slightly--he didn&#39;t want a fat cock, just a thic one--and hovered over Reality Alteration. A tooltip appeared by his cursor, reading: The subject&#39;s surroundings and world will alter to accompany this change. This will affect wardrobe, as well as subject&#39;s associates memories relating to changes made. -*Do I want to surprise Sharon with a wang that just became massive out of nowhere, or do I want to erase her memory of ever seeing and making fun of my normal dick?*-<br />
<br />
He decided to toggle the reality changes &#39;On&#39;. He was interested in how it would affect other things--if the Chronivac wasn&#39;t a waste of money. Next, he hovered over &#39;subject awareness.&#39; The tooltip read: Will this subject be aware of their pre-modified state when changes are made? WARNING: MAY PERMANENTLY AFFECT USER&#39;S ABILITY TO REVERT CHANGES. USE WITH CAUTION. It is HIGHLY recommended that this is used in tandem with the &#39;Current User Preclusion&#39; option, and as such has been set as default when Subject Awareness is toggled &#39;On&#39;.<br />
<br />
With large red exclamation marks before and after the Warning. John made note to be especially careful when using this option. He hovered over the &#39;Current User Preclusion&#39; option. It read: This will allow the user to be aware of the changes being made, while also adapting to the new memories formed in this modified reality. Use caution when disabling this option.<br />
<br />
John toggled the options on, leaving User Preclusion on. He wanted to know how his dick had aided him through life, but he wanted to keep track of what he had done to himself.<br />
<br />
Reviewing the changes, he hit &#39;apply.&#39; And didn&#39;t feel anything. He knew it; the Chronivac was junk. He unzipped his pants just to make sure, but his dick didn&#39;t look any bigger. He rummaged around for a ruler, and found one. It measured 8&quot;, just like usual.<br />
<br />
-*Just like usual?*- John immediately realized. The Chronivac was legitimate. He was about to change his world.</p>
