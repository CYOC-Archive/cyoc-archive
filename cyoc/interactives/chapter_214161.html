<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>I don&#39;t know where rawr7 is planning on going with this story, but it&#39;s been fun to read. I don&#39;t know if this is necessarily in character or within the rules of the world, but I felt compelled to give these two a moment. I just wish I&#39;d had the time or energy to actually write one of those solutions (or failed solutions). Obviously, I&#39;m more interested in whatever rawr7 has planned, so just consider this a non-canon piece if it&#39;s too far off track.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Geoffrey was worried. About more bandits showing up, sure. But looking around, it appears many of the other merchants of the caravan also had a guard positioned for their groups here in the middle of the night. Even if they wouldn’t lift a finger to help, it’s too many eyes for most bandits. Being a non-spellcaster, there wasn’t anything for him to lose by taking the middle shift on the night watch. And being a natural protector, it’s a role he was well suited to handle alone. <br />
<br />
Bandits were not the first thing he was worried about. Nor were the other caravans, who each seemed to practice odd magic not unlike that of the hag or Glitz or… His paw rested on his pocket, feeling the soul jar there. The power within it. It tempted him so, he could down it right now, walk into the Prince’s tent and turn him into a mewling horny twink, all for him to plow-<br />
<br />
Geoffrey shook his head. No, it didn’t tempt him, it tempted the other one. The person whose body he took over to return to this world, the one who’s been fighting him every step of the way. At first he was quiet, letting Geoffrey attend to his tasks and to his prince. Only popping up for a moment just to say something, usually to Charlie. When that would happen, Geoffrey would become trapped in his own body, a howling wind of the frozen north wailing through his mind, preventing him from hearing or understanding what his own lips were saying. And when they were over, he seemed to slip into the moment, as if nothing happened, retaining only enough of the conversation to proceed naturally. But just when these moments were getting further and further apart, it seemed like this inner entity had quickly grown irritable. And when he sipped from the skunk’s soul jar, that voice became desperate to take control, more capable of doing so. And those howling winds came more frequently.<br />
<br />
Geoffrey looked around, nothing unusual moving about. The Madam’s tent was nearby, but he spotted a few others as well. A jaguar with a selection of vaguely face-shaped baked goods, a group of goblins selling various toys and gadgets, a koala-dwarven blacksmith with vibrantly colored armor and weapons. Each of them probably dabbled in the same magic that Veles had spent the day studying. The magic Geoffrey feared was going to destroy him.<br />
<br />
Fortunately for Geoffrey, things were boring. Jeff, that other person, was often quiet when things were boring. It gave Geoffrey some time to think, alone. To give himself a quiet eulogy for himself over what was possibly going to happen: Jeff grasping control of his body, leaving him at the whim of his thoughts and wants. He thought of his history, the time with his old clan, his exile, meeting Prince Gregory and all the wonderful times they had. The coup, and the subsequent bloodshed. How they ran, hiding away with the help of the Order, and with Charlie’s help. And how that led to here, now, stuck in the body of a man shaped like himself, but who very much wanted him gone. Jeff seemed to hate him so much that he was almost willing to let that skunk take them both over just so he wouldn’t have to be...<br />
<br />
Geoffrey looked at his claws. He was strong, but not strong enough for this. He could run, but he could never abandon his prince. He was trapped waiting for his own demise in the form of a “helpful” spell their companion was planning on casting. It seemed like everyone was aware of this other entity, and was on his side. And for Geoffrey, that was heartbreaking. His very existence felt like a burden the others were eager to shed. There was no way for him to speak for himself either, Jeff would simply step in and take over before he could say anything. But he couldn’t stay silent all night, to be obliterated without a word of his own. And so he slipped over to the carriage where everyone was sleeping, and gently shook the prince awake.<br />
<br />
“My liege,” he spoke softly, hoping his words wouldn’t wake the others. Though when Gregory awoke with a jolt he became worried, but the mink soon calmed down, and wore his usual annoyed expression.<br />
<br />
“What is it, Geoffrey? You know I require my rest,” He spoke, subconsciously keeping the same hushed tone, though definitely still upset at having been woken up when he expected a full eight hours.<br />
<br />
“I know, my liege. I just... I need to speak with you privately,” Geoffrey said, as he walked away toward the fire pit. Gregory let out a quiet huff of annoyance before putting himself together to meet him there.<br />
<br />
“Well, what is it? It doesn’t seem like there’s any danger about, so what could possibly be going on in that head of yours that you needed to speak with me in the middle of the night,” Gregory stood about halfway between the fire and the carriage, ready to go back to sleep as soon as possible.<br />
<br />
Geoffrey sat by the fire, looking down at his feet, claws drawing circles in the dirt. He knew if he was direct about his worries, Jeff would likely step in and overtake the conversation. His only lifeline was how much Jeff seemed to hate dealing with Gregory. He’d pretty much always left him alone when he was with the mink, so maybe he wouldn’t be so eager to take over a boring one on one conversation with the prince.<br />
<br />
“I wanted to say, I love you, my liege,” Geoffrey began honestly, unsure of where he was going. Gregory sighed and moved to sit next to the big polar bear.<br />
<br />
“I’m well aware of that, you big oaf,” Gregory rolled his eyes, but something was nagging at him. He knew the bear was a more than capable guard, it’s not like him to require company in his duties. “What has got you so beside yourself that you needed to tell me that immediately?”<br />
<br />
“I,” The bear paused, unsure how direct he could be, “Don’t know if I’m going to be able to say it again, my liege.”<br />
<br />
The mink raised an eyebrow, “What, are you planning on leaving?” His tone sharper, accusatory, but still hushed.<br />
<br />
Geoffrey shook his head, “No sir, I just worry about these magics Veles plans to use on me,” he shuffles his feet nervously. “They are dangerous, and despite his studies, he’s inexperienced. Like giving an adolescent a spear for fishing, I fear something will go wrong.”<br />
<br />
Gregory sighed, rubbing the back of the bear’s back, “It will be fine, Veles is a very capable mage. Nothing will go wrong, we’ll fix you up and-”<br />
<br />
“I’m not broken,” Geoffrey shot back, before turning his head away. Neither of them could remember the last time the bodyguard interrupted the prince. “I’m sorry, my liege,” he said, hanging his head in shame.<br />
<br />
Gregory’s instinct was to berate the bear, but he was beginning to be aware that things were more wrong than he realized. Hand still on the bear’s back, he continued from where he left off, “His spell will make you smarter. You’ll be able to read and write, better for you to handle yourself in my courts when we retake my throne.” He put his hand over the bear’s claw, catching a slight blush appear through the bear’s fur. “And I want you there with me.”<br />
<br />
Geoffrey let the moment hang, before continuing, “I’m afraid I’ll be different.”<br />
<br />
“Of course you will be,” The mink scoffed, “You’ll be smarter, better. It will be a good change for you.”<br />
<br />
“It’s not for me,” the bear blurted out, natural emphasis landing on the word me. Gregory looked at him confused.<br />
<br />
“What do you mean?” the mink leaned in, “Who is it for?” The bear dared not answer, worried that he would lose control if he said more. The gears clicked and turned in the prince’s mind, first thinking that this was just a spell for the party’s benefit before a revelation hit him. “Oh,” he said, before continuing.<br />
<br />
“Geoffrey, you are cruel to me,” the bear’s head turned to him as he spoke, frightened and dismayed, as Gregory recounted, “When we sleep. You whisper terrible things in my ear as you hold me. You say I am pompous and puffed up, and then things get worse. You often describe how you’d murder me, strangling me, slitting my throat, bounding me in rags and throwing me over a bridge. All said when I am tightly nestled in your arms, unable to escape.” Gregory looked away from the bear’s horrified expression before continuing. “If I ever hold a shorter temper with you, it is because of these moments. I used to think these were your true thoughts bubbling up, but I understand better now.” The mink turned back to the bear, “You never were this way before we came back. Glitz’s magic saw me take over a weakened lion, desperate for change. It was easy to overpower him, though I suspect you were given a much tougher clay to work with.”<br />
<br />
The mink stood up, the bear spying a rare resolve in his eyes but unable to speak on it. “Wait here,” the prince said, his regality shining through even in the dark. He walked back to the carriage, Geoffrey unsure what was going on, before the prince walked back out, fully armored. “M-My liege! What are you doing?” The bear was flabbergasted and confused, “I think you should return to your rest. I’m sorry to worry you, sir!”<br />
<br />
“No no,” the prince spoke with purpose in his voice. “It’s settled, what’s best for the group is not best for us. You sip that skunk’s soul essence not because you want to, but because whatever is left of that slovenly bear inside you demands it. The solution that’s been offered is not for us, it’s for him. I do not wish to be belittled at every turn by my bodyguard,” Gregory walked over towards the bear, and planted a kiss on his muzzle, before whispering in his ear, “And my love.” Stepping away, Gregory does one last check of his equipment, stealthily pocketing the soul essence jar he picked from the bear’s pocket, before seeming satisfied. “Stay here,” he commanded, “Keep watch over the others. I will walk among the other caravan groups, seeking our own path.”<br />
<br />
“M-my liege! Alone!? I could never leave you-,” The bear’s protests halted merely by the mink’s raised hand.<br />
<br />
“It is decided, Geoffrey,” The prince had an air of confidence around him the bear had not seen since his days in the castle. He was not simply acting as a noble here. “Tonight, I will be your protector. I ask you to trust me in this. I do not know if I will succeed, but I will not sit idly by as you wallow in your despair.” He turned to leave, before looking back at the bear. “Wish me luck, Geoffrey.”<br />
<br />
“I-I do, my love,” The word stumbled out accidentally. Before the bear could correct himself, he watched his prince smirk as he headed off towards the collection of miscreants and monsters in search of an alternate solution, no matter the danger.</p>
