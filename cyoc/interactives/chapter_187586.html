<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Max was upset by the loss of his penis. For one, he felt it was completely unfair that his dad could just do this to him for no reason. He knew the 10 rules, and this was not on the list. One could argue that it would be considered being rude, but it wasn&#39;t like he did it intentionally or anything. <br />
<br />
From the start though, this whole punishment thing felt a lot like them abusing the power of the device to him. It wasn&#39;t even theirs in the first place. Plus, il it is pretty rude to hold someone to a standard but not yourself. And he is certain that them stealing the device from their kids is definitely breaking the rules. Meaning it was only right to enact punishment on the both of them. <br />
<br />
Max waited for his parents to be distracted by something and snuck into their room. His activated the device and first returned his penis. Then he undid his siblings gender swap too. Now that that was taken care of, he removed his Dad&#39;s hands because of him stealing the device, and his Mom&#39;s voice since she was verbally encouraging him to do so. He then set the timer for the full 24 hours. Finally he password locked the device and paired his phone to it so that he could use it remotely. He quickly left the room just as his dad stood up from the couch and began running toward the room. <br />
<br />
Max just managed to quietly close the door to his own bedroom by the time his Dad made it to his. But max had closed the door, and with no hands, his dad was stuck and couldn&#39;t even open it. His Mom was right behind him though, silently panicking. She opened the door and they both entered. <br />
<br />
When they saw no one was inside, they checked the device, but couldn&#39;t access it due to a password lock. Geoffrey shouted loud enough for the entire house to hear. He yeld that everyone is to go to the livingroom and then left the bedroom after Lauren again opened the door for him.<br />
<br />
The children walked into the livingroom, mostly confused. Especially Alissa and Kyle who were back to normal. Max did his best to also appear the part, feigning innocence. When all 6 were present, Geoffrey began his search for the culprit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who did it? Who touched the device? I already have an idea as to who, but I am asking just in case. No one? Max, something tells me this was you.&quot; Geoffrey said motioning to his stump arms. &quot;Wanna know why? Because only you and me, know about your punishment, and I bet that it no longer is in effect anymore, correct?&quot; <br />
<br />
Max knew he was caught. He had overlooked this detail. But he was not about to go down without a fight first. &quot;Yeah I did it. You and Mom both needed punishment, so I gave you it.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;That is not how this works. We are the parents, you are the child. You don&#39;t get to punish us-&quot; Said Geoffrey angrily. However, he wasn&#39;t prepared for his oldest to speak up and interrupt him. <br />
&quot;Max, why did you punish them for?&quot; Asked Rachel curiously, which was only encouraged further by Andy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me and Ricky had bought the device with out own money and they just walked into our room and took it from us. That is stealing. Plus then they create hypocritical rules which involve a rule about not srealing and not being rude. This seems pretty rude to me. Dad also said that me and Ricky are not able to handle the power of the device, yet the first thing they do with it is harass their own children by physically altering their bodies as a punishment. And I got punished just for making a mess of the toilet seat. That isn&#39;t even one of the rules.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it is kind of rude.&quot; Pointed out Rachel.<br />
<br />
&quot;But it isn&#39;t like I did it to be rude. I just didn&#39;t think about it. And Dad was already posted up outside the bathroom waiting for me to leave, just so he could punish me. That is a pretty disturbing interest in a child&#39;s bathroom useage if you ask me. Plus for a punishment, he just gave me a pussy. He didn&#39;t turn me into a girl like he did with Kyle, he just gave me a pussy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now even Lauren was staring at her husband. She did not hear about this part when he said he punished Max. And while she didn&#39;t ask for the details, hearing about them definitely sent up some red flags.<br />
<br />
Geoffrey&#39;s face was red, not with guilt or embarrassment, but with anger. However everyone took it to be his embarrassed guilt. &quot;Now let me set this straight. I do not have any interest like that. I just had to use the toilet and was waiting my turn. Secondly, giving you a vagina fixes the problem, and doubles for a punishment.&quot;<br />
That earned him a smack from his wife. If she could speak she would be tearing into him about how being turned into a girl isn&#39;t suppose to be punishment unless it is specifically relevant to the issue at hand. Which this clearly wasn&#39;t the case.<br />
<br />
Andy spoke next. &quot;Well, Mom and dad sure seem guilty to me, and I would say they definitely are not fit to handle the device since they are clearly unable to accept being held to the same standards. If Max and Ricky bought it, it belongs to them. Speaking of which, why did you two buy it anyways?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me and Max hate being mistaken for eachother so we were planning on making ourselves look different&quot; says Ricky.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, they clearly are incapable of handling such power&quot; sarcastically said Andy. &quot;And stop hanging around outside bathrooms Dad. It&#39;s creepy.&quot; Andy got up and left, followed by everyone else but Max, Rachel, and their parents.<br />
<br />
Rachel first spoke to Max. &quot;Max, grow up and stop pissing on the seat already. Its super gross. You still deserve a punishment for being rude like that. And yes, not being considerate of the other people you live with is infact being rude. But not worthy of being physically altered against your will. Just no dessert tonight. Ok?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What? But...&quot; said Max, only to reluctantly accept it after his older sister insisted again that this was fair. <br />
<br />
&quot;And as for you, Mom and Dad. Well, you got what you deserve honestly. Stealing from your own son? Really? And then going as far as using it against him? You both should be ashamed. And Andy is right, you better knock it off with that bathroom line of 1, habit Dad before someone calls you out on it by contacting someone about it. And for the love of God Mom, stop being such an enabler for Dad. He may be smart on paper, but he isn&#39;t always right. And both of you, this is not how you discipline your kids. Siblings fight all the time. And neither of you would know this with you being both only childs.&quot; <br />
<br />
Rachel turned back to Max. &quot;Now, Max. After you and Ricky settle your issue with your appearances, just be very careful please. This is not a toy. It can have life changing consequences if used incorrectly. So please promise me never to use it for revenge or to get back at someone, even if only temporarily.&quot;<br />
<br />
Max promised since he had no reason no to and ran off to get the Chronivac from his parent&#39;s bed room. He also undid their punishment too after his Sister suggested that he do it. He and Ricky ended up using it to simply make Ricky&#39;s hair darker and Max&#39;s lighter. Max, who had spent a bit of time with a pussy, also convinced Ricky that having one was interesting, and gave each of themselves a fully functioning pussy,  just behind their balls too. They thought about trying out having boobs, but felt they would be way to hard to keep hidden, and tossed the idea out.</p>
