<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I exit the bathroom wrapping myself in the pink bathrobe, the soft woolen robe felt weird against my penis, entering my room I look about and realize everything is still women’s clothes, looking through my underwear drawer and comparing it to my penis, not wanting to suffocate my testicles I decide to go commando and look for pants, deciding between sweats or risking the skirt. I grab a pair of sweats and put them on, my ankles are showing and the sweats are still baggy enough that it doesn’t promote my penis but it doesn’t hide it either, now to find a top. However, I don’t have breasts anymore, I can just walk out like this now, only problem is, I don’t have shoes that will fit although I could sneak into my parents room and steal my dad’s shoes or sandals.<br />
I take a glance out of my room, no one is there, I rush over to the master bedroom and started searching for shoes, I found some sandals then a shirt, and rush back to my room. I finish dressing and think about my next step, I go through my room again compartmentizing all my stuff into whether or not I’ll fit into it, pictures, and overtly girly decore, figuring out what to keep and what might have to go due to giving me a boner. Now to just wait for everyone to go to bed.<br />
I hear the last of the family close their room doors and I sneak downstairs to the front door, I very carefully leave and lock the door behind me. I should head to Rachel’s house, her brother may be my new size, and if worse comes to it, the two of them can pretend I’m a friend of Tom’s and hang the night before shopping with Rachel tomorrow.<br />
A few minutes later I arrive at Rachel’s house, climb the tree leading to her window and knock the start to “Respect” (by Aretha Franklin), lights turn on and Rachel opens the window, a pink bathrobe covering herself as she pulls it tighter, “Who the hell are you and how do you know that knock?”<br />
“It’s me Heather, I got an ad on the TV that asked if you ever wondered what the opposite sex was like and I thought it would be a gag ad, well it wasn’t.”<br />
“Nah I need more then that.”<br />
“Okay, last week you told me that your boyfriend found a picture that we took and never ment to send to anyone and he’s been ‘using it since’.”<br />
“Oh Heather, come in, I can’t believe it’s you!” Rachel said helping me through the window, “well I’m curious, so drop ‘em, and then we can start making a plan for tomorrow, because obviously you need to go shopping… I assume your parents don’t know yet?”<br />
“No they don’t and thank you for this, also, slut alert,” I say pulling my sweatpants down, dick having been pushed as the elastic passed it goes flopping up, hitting my belly button and rocks back to place. A small moan escapes my lips as I’m still getting used to this new sensitivity.<br />
Rachel looks over with lust at my flaccid penis, looks at me then as she starts towards the door, “I see someone is sensitive, also circumsized, mazel tof.” Rachel heads over to her door and makes sure it’s locked before taking her robe off, Rachel now stands there completely nude, back to me, as she does sleep naked often, “Hey perv, I bet you love this.” Rachel peers back and we both look down and see my erection start to grow, “Uhm, I’m uh… sorry Rachel… I guess I uh…” I stammer out feeling red in the face look away.<br />
“Heather please, this isn’t new, we have seen each other naked when you were a girl, the porn material was already there, the only think new really is that elephant trunk and I’d assume you now like women instead of men?” Rachel says nonchallantly looking through her underwear drawer grabbing a red bikini piece then grabbing Sweat pants a with a short see through crop top on, “See? Nothing new.”<br />
Rachel then pulls my sweats up as I still have just been standing there stuttering like an idiot.<br />
“Now let’s put him away ey Heather? and hurry up to bed, we need to wake up to make sure we don’t look guilty of anything when my parents wake up,” Rachel says lightly kissing my penis before covering it. I then get dragged over to Rachels bed and I start to come back to my senses and hop in, all I’m thinking is that’s just like any other sleepover with Rachel, just get in bed and morning will be here soon. Both of us got to sleep rather quickly.<br />
My dreams started off innocent enough, waking up next to Rachel like usual, both of us naked as we would have normally done (not really) then heading out to breakfast where Rachel’s mom was also in the nude as usual (not) and we’d chat about mindlessly, then all of the sudden Rachel turned to me and started stroking near my groin, she started picking up the pace, I look down and my breasts and vagina are gone, I’m a man getting a handjob by my bestfriend while her nude mother watched… both women getting noticably wet as Rachel started to look to sit on my lap…<br />
The alarm blares as Rachel sharts to shove me awake, “wake up Mr. Heather, we need a plan fast, and then you can tell me all about that dream,”<br />
I get up, groggily noticing my best friends bouncing breasts under the crop top, and I exit the bed. “Okay, I’m going to go get Tom, fill him in, then plan the next move,” Rachel says throwing a robe on and leaving closing the door behind her. A minute later both Rachel and Tom arrive, throwing clothes at me Tom starts with, “Damn, I figured I’d go along with it for a laugh but wow, Heather you’re cute now.” I start to strip and change while both of them stared at me, making it all the weirder, “Okay so what’s the plan? As much as you two don’t seem to mind watching me change I can focus on more than one thing.”<br />
“Yea, sorry babe, so you’ll head down the tree to the front door, and we’ll introduce you as Tom’s friend who just moved to town, that’ll invite you for breakfast and then we’ll go shopping, figure out how to approach your parents and all that other fun stuff,” Rachel says pulling together all the discarded clothes, “now we need to know what name you’ll want to go by, at least in public, because we can’t introduce you as Heather.”<br />
“I’ll just use John, I can’t deal with that part right now, it’s generic enough to not be a bother,” I respond pulling the t-shirt on finishing changing, “so how do I look?”<br />
“Like a really hot guy stole my clothes, kidding about the ‘stole’ part though.”<br />
I headed out back down the tree to the front door, took a deep breath and knocked, the door opened and I asked, “Hello, I’m John, a friend of Tom, and he said he’d show me around town, I just moved here so I’m sorry if it’s early, used to different time zones and all.”<br />
“Hi, I’m Mrs. Ambers and don’t worry, come on in for some breakfast and I’ll show you up to Tom’s room.” She led me in and, as if I were knew, let her lead me up to the second floor and brought me to Tom’s room where she knocked. Unexpectidly Rachel opened her door and leaned out, breasts under gravity’s influence showing off her right tit, “Oh that wasn’t meant for me, well hello anyway,” Rachel said feigning embarrasement while Mrs. Ambers went proper flushed in the face after seeing her daughter’s perversion in front of a “stranger” when another knock on Tom’s door was made and it opened this time, “Oh hey John! Glad you weren’t lost on the way over, come in; hey mom? When’s breakfast so we know when to head out, there’s this new movie and so timing for showings is important.”<br />
Mrs. Ambers says it won’t be too long and feel free to hang out in the room or downstairs, “Alright thanks mom,” Tom said ushering me in. “Huh, so this is what your room is like, I mean I know it wouldn’t be too outragious like a steriotypical way, but still, didn’t expect this much fandom decorations,” I say marveling while looking around, the door opened and Rachel rushes in still half naked, “So ‘John’ like what you see? Also you still need to tell me about that morning wood dream.”<br />
“Rachel! I can’t believe you aren’t dressed! What would happen if your parents walked in,” I shout while whispering.<br />
“Haven’t you ever visited before? As soon as it’s time to be out of the rooms my parents rarely come upstairs, I could fuck both of you, scream that I’m cumming and they wouldn’t bother.”<br />
“I know your parents didn’t do much upstairs but I guess I wasn’t in a position where I would be murdered for being caught with a naked woman!”<br />
“Fine, spoilsport, but when we get back from shopping we’re all hanging out in my room 100% naked, no takesy backsy,” Rachel huffs and leaves. “Fuck I’m down if you are John, besides, you know Rachel the most, she get’s her way,” Tom says pushing me out the door and heading down towards breakfast,</p>
