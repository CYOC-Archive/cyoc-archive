<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It had been a little over a month since Matthew became Matt, but while Matthew could remember everything about when Matt was in control, Matt never remember being Matthew. The only memories of being Matthew were like dreams that Matt thought he had had. <br />
	<br />
The sun had set a little over half and hour ago and Matthew was laying on his bed looking at Matt’s room. Even though Matthew was back in control, his body and the world around him had remained the same. This meant that not only did he have the body of a jock, but everyone who saw him, even at night, knew him at Matt, the football team’s captain. His room remain just as messy and his parents did not remember their son that had been into math and drama. <br />
	<br />
What made this even worse was the fact that in the mornings when he tried to fight the mental change or if he cleaned up the bedroom or did anything out of character for Matt, his body would change even more. When he was first changed into Matt, football star, he had been a little over six feet and about 180 lbs. Now he was close to 6’5 and almost 210. Nobody else seemed to notice. Matthew had not noticed the changes at first either, but when his head started to almost touch the top of door frames, he started to try and figure out why he was still changing.<br />
	<br />
The problem with trying to figure this out was the limited amount of time Matt was not in control. When Grandfather Jackson had said Matthew would have control at night only when Matt would not be expected, he had no idea how much a football player was expected to be out at night. From night games and bus rides home from away games to all the different parties that the football team attended, Matthew would sometimes two days without gaining control. <br />
	<br />
Laying on the bed in Matt’s room looking at the ceiling, Matthew thought over everything that Matt had been doing over the last month. Clothes were covering the floor, much to Matthew’s chagrin, and in one corner a weight set sat waiting. Getting up off the bed, Matthew walked over to the weight set. As much as he hated to admit, his body just would not relax, because it was aching for some exertion. Picking up some dumbbells, Matthew began to work his muscles.<br />
	<br />
Looking at the clock sitting on the side table next to his bed, Matthew suddenly realized that over an hour had past. Having gone through an entire regiment, Matthew stood and walked over to his bathroom. Having not been wearing a shirt, he stood in front of the mirror taking in his impressive physique. Freshly pumped from the workout, veins moved down his arms, eight brick like abs were on display with a treasure trail moving up from his crotch to his naval, and the bulge that was in his shorts would be the envy of some grown men. Pulling his shorts of and then his boxers, he let his cock hang between his beefy thighs. Watching his member grow and become stiff, Matthew smiled thinking that it deserved its own zip code.<br />
	<br />
The moment this last thought crossed his mind, Matthew froze in terror. Realizing what he was thinking caused Matthew to grab his shorts and throw them in the hamper, taking a quit shower, put some boxers and exercise shorts on and get in bed. Curling up, Matthew desperately tried to forget what had just happened, fearing he was turning into his jock half.<br />
	<br />
The next morning, Matthew woke up to his alarm blaring. Winter was coming and the days were getting shorter. Since Daylight Savings was over, it was still dark out when he opened his eyes. Matthew would have stayed in bed but because Coach was having them come in early for practice, if he did not get up early, Matthew would have no time as himself. <br />
	<br />
Thinking of the previous night, Matthew shuddered. When Grandfather Jackson had first changed him, Matthew never thought that he would start to enjoy his time as Matt, but after what had happened the previous night, Matthew could no longer deny that he was enjoying it. Hating this realization, Matthew set his mind to find ways to enjoy the things he had always liked when he was in control. Seeing it was almost time, Matthew readied himself for the change.<br />
	<br />
As he began to transition into Matt, Matthew again felt the severe headache that began the process. With a pounding in his head, Matthew faded and Matt came forward, but because of how Matthew had reacted the prior evening, the muscles of his body again became bigger with the pounding. Gaining height, Matt moved past the 6’6 mark and hit 6’7. His muscles also grew placing his new weight at 230 lbs. and making his shoe size a 17. With a final throb, Matt shook his head and laid down on the bed to check a few extra minuets of sleep before he had to leave for practice.</p>
