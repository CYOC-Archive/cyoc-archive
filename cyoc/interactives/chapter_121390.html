<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Feeling bored, you decide to go to the horse stables considering that they might have some fans in there, as the heat and humidity was worse on the second floor.<br />
<br />
You step once again outside into the blazing, stick summer weather, and walk to the side of the barn where you see horses. The barn was huge, and inside you see nine beautiful horses. Two were black, one was palomino, two were chestnut, three were bay, and one was white. You weren’t good with breed names, but each one was so beautiful its breed didn’t matter to you, although if you had to guess you’d assume that some were Arabian, Morgans, Thoroughbreds, or American Quarters.<br />
<br />
You could hear some pounding and sniffling further down in a shadowed part of the barn. It sounded like another horse, making up your mind you decide to go see it. <br />
&quot;Eeeeasy, fella,&quot; you soothed not wanting to upset the hidden horse further. Why was your uncle keeping this horse out here by himself? Did he have a disease of some kind? You cautiously walk further forward As your eyes adjusted you nearly jumped out of your skin--staring back at you from the stall was an extremely tall, shirtless man! Why was your Uncle keeping a human being locked up?! <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, are you okay in there? Oh god, here, let me get you out of that stall---&quot;<br />
<br />
As you approached the stall though, you slowed--something was odd. The hoof-noises you heard earlier were definitely coming from the same stall the man was standing in, but there was no evidence of a horse inside with him. Which meant...? No, it couldn&#39;t be...<br />
<br />
But it was! Glancing over the half-door revealed that the &#39;man&#39;s&#39; waist ended right about the horse&#39;s withers, and beyond that was a sleek chestnut body with four white socks and a long tail. He was a centaur!<br />
<br />
Zeus had been locked inside the barn for who knows how long, his body ached for the touch of a person, but the foolish farmer had locked him in so for many weeks, months even! He had to live off of any food or animal he could find, the things he had to do to survive! However it was on the one day when he was truly lusting for the lingering touch of any person that a curious boy walked in, he heard the boy call out to him. He smirked and looked at the boy, the mere sight of him made his member harden, but the boy started in surprise, he decided to let the boy discover what he is, it did not take long for the boy to discover what he was, he laughed, &quot;Yes human, I am a centaur. I am known as Zeus and I see you have wandered into my prison.&quot; he said with his deep barritone voice, he began advancing upon the unfortunate lad, his eyes showing his lust along with his longing to touch flesh, he grabbed the boy&#39;s arm before he could react and pulled him close, &quot;Tell me boy, what is your name?&quot; he asked huskily, gazing into the boy&#39;s eyes, &quot;And be quick of it, I lust for your body.&quot;<br />
<br />
You were so startled that you couldn&#39;t even react as the giant horse-man grabbed your arm and dragged you close--the centaur was so much stronger than any human you&#39;d ever met before! <br />
<br />
&quot;J-Jason, my name is Jason,&quot; you stammered out while trying your best to pull away, &quot;I-I- I don&#39;t know why my uncle has you locked up in here, b-but I&#39;d be happy to let you out! Just let me go and I can undo the latch on this door here, see? It&#39;s too far over for you to reach, b-but I can! Just let me go, and you can run off and no one will ever know differently!&quot; You stammered out<br />
<br />
Then when Zeus rumbled out that he lusted for your supple young body, and cold horror shot through the you, making you redouble your efforts to get away. <br />
<br />
&quot;LET GO OF ME!!! HELP! SOMEBODY PLEASE!!! UNCLE BRIAN!!!! HELP!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Zeus simply laughed, &quot;He will not enter this part of the barn, my sweet,&quot; he said <br />
That only increased your panic further, you were now trying to escape woth all your might.<br />
<br />
&quot;My, my, are you are so desperate to be bred?&quot; Zeus asked as he tore off Jason&#39;s clothes. He smirked at Jason &quot;You look even more beautiful without clothes than I imagined.&quot; he whispered as he forced Jason into all fours.<br />
<br />
You screamed in horror as Zeus forcibly stripped you and forced you onto all fours--it was true indeed though that your lithe, rosy young body made an alluring sight, especially as the fear pheromones rolled off of you.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Please, PLEASE just let me go! I&#39;ll leave you alone and never tell anyone, I promise!&quot;<br />
<br />
You were trapped between old haybales and Zeus&#39;s weight so you couldn&#39;t move. He smelled both fertile and terrified. Just what the centaur liked in his mares! Zeus didn&#39;t wait long before forcing himself onto Jason, his gigantic cock finally coming into contact with the poor boy&#39;s skin. <br />
 <br />
You tried pleading with the centaur once more but it was no good. &quot;Do you take me for a fool?!&quot; Zeus said with a growl, &quot;I will not lose my only opportunity to mate.&quot; he said as you shuddered when you felt the tip of the cock against your skin, without warning he rammed his thick large cock into your poor small hole without any form of preparation. <br />
<br />
You howled in pain as a thick, horse-sized cock slammed deep into your ass. It felt like you were being torn apart inside. It hurt so much, and you felt so thoroughly-used and worthless, and utterly ashamed. What a slut you must look like, taking a horse-man&#39;s cock all the way to the root in yout virgin asshole! Your belly bulged out, deformed by the head of Zeus&#39;s cock. Almost as as though you were pregnant.<br />
<br />
&quot;OWWW!!! PLEASE, STOP! PLEASE!&quot; You managed to yell out. It was for naught though as Zeus just laughed evilly and continued pounding into you. &quot;Do shut up dear, you wouldn&#39;t want a punishment now would you?&quot; he asked as he began to slide in and out of you at an even faster rate, enough to make you howl from pain. Zeus did not stop pounding you for anything.  You wailed in agony when the centaur started pounding in and out of you even faster---it was like being punched in the guts by a jackhammer, and to top it off it was starting to make you nauseous. To add to your humiliation, all the rubbing of your prostate was getting you hard and making you stay hard, your erection scratching against the loose straw. This was pure torture, and it seemed like it was going on for days instead of hours.<br />
<br />
Even though Zeus hadnt cum yet you had already cum several times, hating yourself thoroughly for it all the while, and eventually you finally became accepting of your fate to being reduced to a whimpering, bleeding piece of sex-meat for your equine rapist.<br />
<br />
It was only a quarter to three when Zeus&#39;s member finally thickened, he gripped your hips and rammed his cock even deeper into you, further than you thought it could possibly go. Before with a low moan releasing gallons upon gallons of his seed deep into you. Feeling irked all the while as he heard the pitiful moans of his new mate.<br />
<br />
You could only groan as your tormentor unloaded inside of you. The seed was hot and thick, and instantly made your gut round out with the flow. The urge to puke was stronger than ever as torrents of cum dribbled into your stomach and through your intestines and before splashing and gurgling around, thoroughly upsetting your stomach even more. <br />
<br />
&quot;Please,&quot; you barely whispered, your voice raw from screaming, &quot;Please, just let me go...&quot;<br />
<br />
Zeus only grunted as he continued to expel his seed into you, your stomach had become impossibly large. He knew it wouldn&#39;t be that way for too long though as the changes would start soon. Once he was finished, you felt him slide out of you before smirking, &quot;As if I&#39;d let my mate go.&quot; He said before laughing mercilessly.<br />
<br />
You just moaned--you felt so sick and bloated; your stomach was the size of an overinflated beach ball and you could barely move for the bruises. You shuddered before burping sickly as the centaur pronounced you his &#39;mate&#39;. Somehow you managed to crawl away, hoping to get some of your clothes that wasn&#39;t too ruined back on and head back up to the house to face your Uncle---but as it happened, Uncle Brian found you first. He had gotten concerned when you didn&#39;t come in for lunch, and intuition led him to Zeus&#39;s barn.<br />
<br />
&quot;There you are, boy. And dammit, Z, what&#39;d I tell you about fucking the help? There&#39;s a REASON I keep you cooped up in here!&quot;<br />
<br />
You hiccuped and burped up a mouthful of cum. <br />
<br />
&quot;H-help me...&quot;<br />
<br />
Your uncle tutted and shook his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;I warned ya ya be careful, didn&#39;t I boy? He bred with you; you&#39;re his mare now. You&#39;ll feel a bit off &#39;till you&#39;re body has changed and you&#39;ve gotten pregnant and finally had your first foal but that probably won&#39;t be for months yet. I&#39;ll bring your things in here; you can sleep in one of the empty stalls. Your body should change soon enough, I&#39;d offer ya some dinner, but from the looks of things, you got a bellyfull already!&quot; <br />
<br />
You moaned and sat down hard, wincing at the pain in your raw, abused ass. You couldn&#39;t stay here! There was no way---and what had your Uncle meant by feeling better once your body changed and you had your first foal?!?<br />
<br />
Shortly after those thoughts went through your mind you felt all the gallons of cum start sloshing around inside you as you felt something changing and shifting within you. You moaned from both pain and pleasure before finally it stopped. Looking down you could see that your stomach was practically all gone and you no longer felt nauseous. However you did feel heated and something slick running down the back of your thighs, you also smelled something appealing; a strong stallion to mate with and give you plenty of beautiful foals. Strangely enough you didn&#39;t find those thoughts weird. <br />
<br />
Breaking out of your thoughts you heard your Uncle talking with Zeus who laughed, &quot;Forgive me Brian but I must admit your new helper makes quite the impressive mare, he&#39;s so fertile and beautiful.&quot; he said grinning, his cruel demeanor entirely disappearing upon the sight of Jason&#39;s uncle. <br />
<br />
Brian laughed &quot;Well if ya say so.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed I do, I have a request to make of you,&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Shoot.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d like my new mare to sleep with me. Especially now while he&#39;s having his first heat. It&#39;s extremely important that he be near me to ensure that all the changes happen smoothly.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brian just shrugged &quot;Sure, Ain&#39;t no skin off my back. You&#39;ll have to move to a larger though as this one&#39;s a bit too small.&quot; <br />
<br />
Zeus gruffly nodded, &quot;Very well, But I can&#39;t promise not to kill him with pleasure.&quot; he said chuckling, &quot;It&#39;s your genes&#39; fault for giving him such a young and beautiful body.&quot; he said in a low, husky manner.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason&#39;s uncle booted with laughter &quot;Hey, once you&#39;ve gotten the mare pregnant and the foal is born be my guest. Just know his parents are expecting him back by fall. C&#39;mon, mare-slut.&quot;</p>
