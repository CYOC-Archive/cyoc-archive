<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Matt walked down to the cafeteria. He was still getting used to his big jockey body. Girls and guys would check him out as he walked by. At first he felt a little embarrassed but then he started to own it, showing off just a little bit more. He loved the way his shirt clung to his biceps and the nice outline of his pecs. Not to mention how his jeans wrapped nicely around each curve of his leg, showing off each defined muscle. He grabbed his tray and started to grab some food. His hands naturally reached for some of the &#39;healthier&#39; choices the school was offering.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like there&#39;s anything healthy on the menu,&quot; he snidely remarked. There was a part of him that still found this thought to be weird. Before the change he&#39;d never thought about healthy foods at all. Just as long as it looked good he&#39;d eat it. But now he had this godlike body. He had to make sure it was getting the fuel for his system. &quot;Whatever,&quot; he grinned as he picked up the chicken wrap.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you see David?&quot; Matt could overhear a conversation between two other guys. &quot;Really packing on the weight. Already got the freshman 15 and it&#39;s not even winter break yet.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Josh... C&#39;mon man... David&#39;s under a lot of stress right now. Don&#39;t be an ass,&quot; the other guy said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Lighten the fuck up Hank,&quot; Josh shot back. &quot;All I&#39;m saying is if I was was gaining weight like him I&#39;d be worried. It&#39;s just once you&#39;ve got the weight it&#39;s so hard to get rid of.&quot; He wasn&#39;t big guy. Probably about 5&#39;9&quot; and 130 pounds. His thin arms and waist was the product of his genetics, not some good diet.<br />
<br />
Hank had rolled his eyes at Josh&#39;s comment. &quot;Maybe he&#39;ll start working out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like you?&quot; Josh laughed at the other small guy. &quot;How&#39;s that working out for you.&quot; He squeezed the other guy&#39;s arm to emphasize how weak he was. They were about the same size but Josh seemed a lot more abrasive than Hank. Hank was obviously trying. A few memories of seeing him struggle with the weights filled Matt&#39;s mind.<br />
<br />
&#39;That&#39;s right I go to the gym now,&#39; he smiled at the thought. Just looking down was enough of a reminder of how many hours his new body had spent in the gym. The large muscles never left his sight. Matt turned his attention back to the Chronivac. &#39;Each time Josh finishes his meal another one will appear on his plate. He&#39;ll neither be full nor hungry. Each time Josh eats the meal he&#39;ll gain 15 pounds of fat while Hank will gain 10 pounds of muscle.&#39; A prompt popped up, &#39;would you like the subjects to be aware?&#39; Matt hit the no button.<br />
<br />
&quot;All I&#39;m saying is that if you were in the same spot as him you wouldn&#39;t like people making fun of you behind your back,&quot; Hank said between bites. <br />
<br />
&quot;Pfftt...&quot; Josh dismissed. &quot;Whatever... If I ever start gaining weight like him then I&#39;ll be worried. But until then...&quot; he finished his meal as he said it. The weight was already adding to his belly. A small pouch pushed at the bottom of his shirt. It wasn&#39;t very noticeable but when he moved around it was definitely there. His hands gripped the new hamburger and he started eating again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why are you so slow at eating?&quot; Hank called him out. His body had adapted as well. His 130 pound frame bumped up to 140. The medium sized shirt fit around his shoulders better. Instead of draping down his sides it looked like it fit him pretty well. Any fat that had gathered around his frame almost seemed to disappear. <br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; Josh hadn&#39;t even realized that he had almost an entire burger still in his hands. &quot;Cause your distracting me,&quot; he accused, shoving most of the burger into his mouth. It went down with a hard gulp. Another 15 pounds added to his 145 pound frame. His shoulders widened in his shirt while there was a clear belly poking the front of his shirt out. The pants he wore were straining against his growing butt. Two large round globes pushed against the fabric.<br />
<br />
Hank looked down at the tray and saw the full meal still. &quot;I just think you should watch what you&#39;re eating...&quot; He said. &quot;Most of this food isn&#39;t the best for you.&quot; <br />
<br />
Josh stared at his friend. &quot;Of course you&#39;d say that. Start working out and think you&#39;re better than me? Why don&#39;t you start wearing shirts that actually fit you?&quot; Hank&#39;s medium size shirt stretched nicely across his body. He could have easily worn a large but it didn&#39;t show off his body as well. Wearing mediums allowed his 150 pound muscular frame to turn more heads. Josh turned back to his food and shoved the hamburger in his mouth. He quickly finished it. <br />
<br />
His weight pushed up to 175. A bit of fat is starting to hang over his entire body. The smooth almost featureless body now has rounded out in several places. His chest pushes his shirt forward while his belly pushes it even further. His face rounds out around the sharp corners he had. Meanwhile Hank weighs 160 pounds. He keeps his thin waist but his shoulders start to get broader. Pecs push softly out of his now large shirt. Mediums were getting too small for him to wear and he didn&#39;t want another situation where he ripped a hole in his shirt in public.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m just saying...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course you&#39;re just saying,&quot; Josh shoveled another plate of food in his mouth. The next plate appeared full again. &quot;You&#39;re always just saying. That&#39;s all it is. I&#39;m not fat, alright?&quot; In his anger he finished another one of the plates. 30 more pounds was added to his widening frame. At 205 he could feel some of the weight rolling around the chair. His entire body had gone soft. Any angle left on his body had smoothed around his round frame.<br />
<br />
Hank had gone up to 180 pounds. He looked like one of the college athletes. Big muscles surrounded his 5&#39;8&quot; frame. &quot;Alright. Just saying if you ever want to go to the gym sometime, call me.&quot; He got up from the table and pushed his chair in. There was a certain amount of confidence in his walk as he left the cafeteria. <br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever,&quot; Josh scoffed to himself. He finished another one of his plates by himself. Looking down at his expanding belly and even flabbier arms he thought about his muscular friend. Girls flocked to Hank&#39;s dense toned body while usually passing him up without second though. Hank had tried a few times to get the girls to pay attention to him but Josh would end up screwing it up before the end of the night. He looked down at the burger again and threw it in the trash.</p>
