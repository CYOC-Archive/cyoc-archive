<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The trial of the three teens ended like that, and mostly without so much as a whimper. The DARE officer lead them out and took them back to school while Officer Barnes and I returned to what was the bulk of our work.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good job in getting the bullying aspect of all this brought forward,&quot; Officer Barnes commented as we made our way back to our car.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would have thought it fairly obvious,&quot; I shrugged, &quot;I only reminded him... and part of that maybe more being somewhat confrontational on my part. I never liked the fact that most of the people when they first met Molly treated her like a zoo or circus animal, and expected her to do tricks... or thought she was a mindless wild animal and would attack them...&quot;<br />
<br />
I paused for a moment and then sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;...and now, I don't like the fact that they are largely giving me the same treatment,&quot; I sighed, &quot;it probably means that I'll be restraining myself for the rest of my life.&quot;<br />
<br />
We had then returned to our vehicle and entered it. Officer Barnes climbed behind the wheel, while I took my place in the back seat of the car.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure,&quot; Officer Barnes replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;What makes it worse is that R.A.M. has actually planned all this out,&quot; I grumbled.<br />
<br />
&quot;R.A.M.?&quot; Officer Barnes asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ranchers Against Molly,&quot; I gave a low growl, &quot;Beauregard formed it before I was transformed for the purposes of making her leave.&quot;<br />
<br />
Officer Barnes only shook his head, &quot;disgusting behavior. Especially since neither of you have caused problems, and so far, you've done a very good job... It's what one does that should be judged. Not one's appearance. By my book, you've done no damage, attacked no person, and have proved to be just as smart as any human...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Some would say the danger outweighs intelligence,&quot; I sighed, &quot;wolves in nature are smart animals, but they are still predators, and thus people don't like them because their intelligence and instincts brings them into conflict with people. Beauregard and his people are likely saying the same thing about Molly and I. We are too dangerous to be trusted in case we go nuts and maul someone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Some could say the same about any human,&quot; Officer Barnes commented, &quot;the difference between them and you and Molly is that they would need some weapon whereas you have the teeth and claws.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No one fears being shot or stabbed,&quot; I commented, &quot;for the most part. They have some trust that human society would not allow for it. But nearly everyone fears being eaten by an animal. Shoot, if Molly and I came across an angry grizzly, I'd probably be afraid.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you're pretty big yourself, what did you say you weighed five hundred fifty pounds?&quot; Officer Barnes asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Five hundred fifty five,&quot; I answered, &quot;still smaller then a grizzly, which can average at eight hundred pounds and can max out at about one thousand pounds... and Molly and I are Bengal Tigers, not even the largest tiger subspecies. That would be the Siberian... or Amur Tiger.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't they prey on Brown Bears though?&quot; Officer Barnes asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;On occasion, and the Bengal will occasionally prey on the Asiatic Black Bear and the Sloth Bear which both range into India,&quot; I nodded, &quot;but nature isn't a clear better or superior predator then others. Many Siberian Tigers have been killed by Eurasian Brown Bears defending themselves from the tiger, and there are a couple of instances when the Bear has actually fed on the tiger. And Sloth Bears have been known to drive younger tigers off of kills. Nothing in nature is certain.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess that's why it's &quot;wild&quot;, isn't it?&quot; Officer Barnes chuckled, &quot;where'd you learn all this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mostly research after Molly was first transformed,&quot; I told him, &quot;trying to help her adapt and trying to figure out where would be a good place for her to live.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hopefully we can prove you picked a good place then,&quot; Officer Barnes answered and we resumed our patrol for the day.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The rest of our day went by quietly, with the biggest thing we answered being a couple of traffic violations. And one was from person going to visit family in Idaho and wasn't familiar with the roads around Columbia Falls. After several apologies, Officer Barnes and I gave him a warning and directions to the road he was looking for.<br />
<br />
I found Bandhavgarh Cabin to be fairly quiet when I returned that evening. I could see no lights on and couldn't hear anything as I made my way to the door. Molly was probably still on her &quot;adventure&quot; to Kalispell to get the drugs Molly and I needed, so I wasn't in any real worry at finding our cabin quiet. To my curiosity, however, I found a large brown package on the front porch by the door.<br />
<br />
Close inspection of it revealed that it was from Peoria. The tailor had to have gotten a few of the standard items of clothing for me to wear finished. I collected the box and made my way in and proceeded upstairs with it. My curiosity was at its highest, as I wondered what they would look like, and knew that it would be clothing I could wear that didn't irritate my fur as much. Which would be a relief. The makeshift cloths that Molly and my mother had put together did okay, but they did itch a little, and the uniform itched even more. And while I couldn't escape that fact while on duty, it would be a relief to have clothing that would fit and didn't irritate my fur.<br />
<br />
Opening the box, I found that my guess was correct. It was a supply of silk clothing, along with a letter and a series of order forms. I looked at the letter first.<br />
<br />
It read: &quot;Dear George and Molly, The tailor that did Molly's dresses was surprised to learn that you had become a tiger as well, son, but she also seemed enthusiastic about getting another &quot;big&quot; client. In this package, are five pairs of shorts, one pair of pants, and six pairs of shirts. Also included are an extra two dresses and a feminine pair of shorts and a shirt for Molly. She also provided us with some order forms should you wish or need additional clothing. Not much is going on here, our love to the both of you. Mom and Dad.&quot;<br />
<br />
I double checked the date on the letter. It had been written a few days before I had called them about the order for an outfit that mirrored our stripe patterns, so either they were psychic or it was just a very good coincidence.<br />
<br />
The next thing I moved on to were the order forms. They were fairly standard, with the size measurements and a description of what was wanted. They would then allow for Molly and I to order the &quot;hunting outfits&quot; directly rather then going through my parents. Of course that would still need to wait until we had figured out a way to censor the photos properly. I set the order forms on our desk and then proceeded to change. It would feel good to get out of the itchy uniform.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
I had just started dinner when I heard Molly return. It was actually the car engine that I heard first, but that wasn't too big of an issue. With things only just started, I moved to show her the new clothes I was wearing. She entered with two large bags, I could hear the boxes and pills rattling inside them as she entered with them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ta-da!&quot; I announced, hoping to draw attention to myself.<br />
<br />
&quot;George!&quot; Molly replied excitedly and moved forward to pull me into a hug, the bags bouncing off my back, &quot;you look good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And it's all new,&quot; I told her, &quot;the stuff from the tailor arrived today.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you look marvelous in it,&quot; Molly answered and nuzzled me, &quot;absolutely marvelous.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They also sent you two more dresses and a pair of shorts and a shirt for you to wear as well,&quot; I told her, &quot;I didn't try them on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I'd hope not,&quot; Molly chuckled and nuzzled me again, &quot;Your parents are too good to us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure,&quot; I nodded, &quot;How did you make out with the pharmacy mission?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty good,&quot; Molly answered, &quot;we have all the pills we need for awhile, Veronica loved the car ride with me, the pharmacist made a pass at me, and we actually got a discount on the pills.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A discount is good,&quot; I nodded as Molly began to present me with the pills that we would need to protect us from fleas, ticks, and worms.<br />
<br />
I then began looking through the instructions to one of the medications as we made our way back to the kitchen where we had one cabinet set aside for medical supplies, most of which we didn't need anymore because it wasn't thought that our now felid bodies wouldn't respond to in the same way. I could hear Molly half giggling as we went. As I finished reading the instructions to one of the sets of pills I then turned to her again.<br />
<br />
&quot;The pharmacist made a pass at you?&quot; I questioned in a voice that sounded more possessive then I intended.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry, I let him know I was married,&quot; Molly barely kept herself from laughing, &quot;but it's a step in the right direction, right? I mean... we've gone so long with people either treating me like an animal that is to be feared or to be driven out... this is almost normal right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He made a pass at you?&quot; I repeated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, don't be such a worry wart,&quot; Molly teased and whacked me with her tail.<br />
<br />
I returned the favor by tickling her neck.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who's worrying?&quot; I teased back and tickled her some more.<br />
<br />
&quot;G... Guh... Georrr...guh... stuh...aa...puh...&quot; Molly laughed as my hands drifted down her shoulders and arms, feeling the muscle underneath her fur and then down waist and pulling her into a hug again, &quot;you know I will always and only be yours... to have and to hold.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The priest isn't here,&quot; I told her and nuzzled her.<br />
<br />
Molly only nuzzled me back and returned the hug.</p>
