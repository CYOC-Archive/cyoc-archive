<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brook having taken off the ring waited a few moments to experience... something? A change or sensation perhaps? <br />
<br />
But instead of seeing you return to your normal self, nothing.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s going on sweetie? Did you remove your ring?&quot; You ask, after sensing her confusion. &quot;Well.. yeah, but nothing is happening.&quot; Brook responded as she examined the ring. Did she do something wrong? Was there a step we missed in this? <br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe this takes time to change, after all my transformation happened while we slept right?&quot; you reply reassuringly, although slightly unnerved by this circumstance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.. yeah I suppose so.&quot; Brook said with a slightly uncertain tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay well maybe we can go to the store after the weekend and have this fixed if you’re still not back to normal?” She finally replied, slightly absent-mindedly, &quot;Plus that guy we invited is still here..”<br />
<br />
You were slightly taken aback, &quot;Wait you were going to have me return while that other guy was still in your bedroom?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean I was just letting him sleep in a bit before he left, I thought that would have given you more than enough time to return again right?&quot; Saying it almost gingerly now, you weren&#39;t sure why she thought it was a good idea but as you were dwelling on that thought you could feel Brook perk up in alertness. A knock at the door? You couldn&#39;t quite put a finger on it. All you knew is that you had suddenly felt warmer again, what was going on? Did something happen?<br />
<br />
You felt some movement, being fully nude you also caught the warm air. Seems Brook thought to turn on the heater a bit to make it comfortable. Another sound, a door opening? You supposed you were both still in the bathroom so perhaps she needed to get something to wear. More murmurs, voices. It was harder to grasp what your girlfriend was saying, like it all became more distant, was she talking to her guest? What&#39;s happening? You were feeling tantalisingly warmer now.<br />
<br />
Sensations... kissing perhaps? Hard to tell... hard to think... you focused all your energy on what Brook was doing. There was definitely movement, you found yourself angled in odd ways, was she laying down? More sensations, by now you were losing concentration, it was hard to resist.<br />
<br />
”Okay…” You finally heard Brook say amidst the soft murmurs, but now you were drooling. Was she talking to you? You were so warm so... excited? Yes, yes excited. But for what?<br />
<br />
Almost in an instant you feel lips grazing your own and a tongue... protruding into your petals. Ohhh god… the electricity of pleasure striking out across your whole being all at once. Such intimate sensations. More kissing now, those lips gently sucking along your labia. Shivering as you feel your core heating up.<br />
<br />
&quot;I.. need... I..&quot; You sputter in your thoughts as finally those beautiful lips encapsulate your clit, the sensation of it&#39;s tongue swirling over it, over you gently and expertly.<br />
<br />
It didn’t take long before you felt your own existence bubble up and explode in a shuttering orgasm. Every drop of your drool and essence lapped up lovingly by this foreign lover, your core on fire, the need.<br />
<br />
Another orgasm.<br />
<br />
Gah.. It was so hard to think now! All that seemed to matter was feeling this rollercoaster of sensation, growing to its peak and shattering in orgasmic bliss before rock back and building up again. God this felt so good. Yes, you longed for it again, that urge. ”Cock!” you cried out, you could feel her bucking her hips. <br />
<br />
More murmurs, before you knew it your lover slowly departed but not before giving you another long kiss. Your core shivering, you want him… you need him!<br />
<br />
”Cock!” you cried out again, ”pussy wants cock!” It was only natural for you to crave this. All these familiar sensations flooding into your consciousness again, more and more, drinking it up while you drowned in it.<br />
<br />
You sense more movement, only now your lips seem to be resting on either side of something familiar… ”Cock! Cock cock cock cock!” You sputter, your anticipation palpable. Your encouragements must have egged your owner to respond, as it did not take long to glide up and down this magnificent meat only to finally feel its full throbbing head slipping effortlessly into your entrance once more.<br />
<br />
Feeling your lover again, oh my god, every inch as you slid down this perfect cock. Encapsulating your lover as you sank down to its base, your pubic hair once again entangled in his. Eagerly hugging this immense member before it began its retreat again.<br />
<br />
Your thoughts start to fragment as each thrust fills you up so supremely only to withdraw again. Your core sucking at this member, this cock craving all it has to offer, another thrust as if to reward this hot desire. You are so full of bliss again.<br />
<br />
Another mind-shattering orgasm. A stronger one, your owner must have loved the sensation as much as you did and exploded on this cock. Coating it, claiming it.<br />
<br />
Sensations can only describe your consciousness now, whether anything felt right or not was irrelevant, all that mattered was this beautiful, gorgeous, manly cock. Time felt like an eternity of bliss, warmth, wetness, the rough pounding of this lover. Everything is perfect.<br />
<br />
You could start to feel this member grow ever so slightly as the thrusts became quicker and harder in succession. Yes… YES! Your core eagerly squeezed around that cock, you want it, you want that hot baby batter. Almost as if on cue the sensation of that cock head expanded just a bit more and spewed forth hot globs of cum, the thick throbs of the cock pumping out more and more, the familiar warm sensation filling up your entire core, bathing you in it. <br />
<br />
This had pushed everything over the edge, you lost all comprehension as your body was wracked by another powerful shaking orgasm, stronger than any of the others you had. Juices and intense warmth, glowing sensations that you can feel mutually from your owner. You simply were, no thoughts no words to describe this experience, it was beyond bliss.<br />
<br />
It felt like a small eternity later when you heard Brook speaking, ”Xhat zx hook iop later?” you were entirely uncertain what your owner was doing, but the sensation of her hand gently massaging you, almost as if to help keep in your warm prize helped dash any returning thoughts you had.<br />
<br />
More murmurs and what felt like kissing? Brook? That name. Your owner was kissing someone? Did we have sex again?<br />
<br />
Time was hard to process, your mind was so vague and distant, you could feel Brook walking, could it be the bathroom again? You were feeling some kind of warm liquid splashing down your body and dripping off you.<br />
<br />
”How xz iye pqzhi baby?” Brook finally said, as she gently rubbed you, ”Poxo vxe tze fun?”<br />
<br />
She continued unabated as if you were still able to fully understand her, your consciousness still swimming in a sea of euphoric sensations. ”I yxishiz him xix iozyi over sneu zipz weekend ysl awen neet iozy zxcy fun, iuz you tyz poau with ztu vui qa ui poau vio co zyu store later, isoy that bi quizodh?”<br />
<br />
Summoning all of your collective energy left you simply responded, ”Cock?”<br />
<br />
You could hear what sounds like giggling as your owner rubs you gently once more. ”Tyxoe iao vu plenty zx cocks poi aosi poi vnoiu soon bcay.”</p>
