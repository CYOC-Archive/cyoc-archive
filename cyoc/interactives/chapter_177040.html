<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The day went on full of fun camp activities. Rick was so busy, that he didn&#39;t get a chance to really think about Janet and Marianne. Well, not since that time Marianne showed up at the lake. Instead, Rick noticed something about their situation.<br />
<br />
Rick started remebering a life he simontanously doesn&#39;t remember having, and yet remember vividly. He remembers a world full of critters. Where humans don&#39;t exist. His dad was a ostrich and his mom was a racoon. And yet, dispite having a hard time remembering everything from it, he is certain that he still have all his memories from his human life. It’s as if he has two different lives from two seperate worlds. He wasn&#39;t sure what that implies, but he does know it&#39;s giving him a headache.<br />
<br />
As he, Jack and Sean aproached the boys cabin, the councilor standing in front of the cabin stopped them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hold it.&quot; The owl councilor glanced down at his clip board. &quot;Rick. Sorry bud. I know you want to sleep with the boys, but all our beds are in use. You have to sleep in the girls cabin again until we get another bed and a place to put it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Comon, can&#39;t he just sleep with me or Sean?&quot; Jack asked.<br />
<br />
The owl shook his head. &quot;Sharing beds are against the rules regardless of gender and age. Sorry, but that&#39;s just how it is.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick felt very unconfortable. &quot;But I don&#39;t want to be with those icky girls.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your lucky kid. You get to stay in the repurposed storage room seperate from the girl bunker beds. Not everyone gets a room to themselves, but we don&#39;t really have the choice at the moment.&quot; Owl reminded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay...&quot; Rick relented. <br />
<br />
Jack tried to cheer up Rick. &quot;Hey, just get out of there and join us as soon as you wake up.&quot;<br />
<br />
That cheered Rick a little. &quot;Yeah, see you tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick let the older boys enter the boy&#39;s cabin and then made his way to the girl’s cabin.<br />
<br />
..............<br />
<br />
After dinner with the girls, Rick entered his room and locked the door. Time to go to bed.<br />
<br />
Rick stepped in front of his full body mirror and started changing into his pajamas. As he saw his body up close, he couldn&#39;t help but feel weird. He knew something was wrong. He remeber being human before. But he can&#39;t figure out how could this happen. Was it magic? A shift in dimensions? It’s just so hard to think in a kid&#39;s body. If only he was himself agai-<br />
<br />
*POOF!*<br />
<br />
Rick stumbled and coughed as he tries to clear the smoke and regain his balance.<br />
<br />
As the smoke disipated, Rick was shocked to see his human self in the mirror. And it wasn’t a illusion either! Rick patted himself and everything from yesterday including his adult age and human clothes was intact. He can think a lot more clearly now that his human memories started resurfacing. He remembers it all clearly now! It&#39;s as if his time as a racoon boy was a dream. He can still remeber his time as a recoon boy clearly, but now they feel more distant.<br />
<br />
In his excitment, he left his room and went for his freinds room. But before he can shout their names, he saw a room full of sleeping critter girls. His freinds where still little girls. Before any of them woke up, Rick quietly went back to his room and locked the door.<br />
<br />
Okay, so reality didn&#39;t go back to normal. Only he changed. And since humans don&#39;t exist in the critter world, it&#39;s probably not a good idea to show himself to anyone yet.<br />
<br />
But how did he became human again? All he did was was thought about being human again. Maybe it has something to do with him being a racoon-<br />
<br />
*POOF*<br />
<br />
-boy. He&#39;s a racoon boy again. <br />
<br />
So he just needs to think about what he wants to be and he&#39;ll become it? This is so cool! Is this the power of any recoon? He can be anything he want! He can be a older kid, any species like a wolf or otter, and he can even be... a icky girl... ew. Maybe he can be a inanimate object too...<br />
<br />
Rick thought back to when Jack said that if he hangs with the girls long enough, he&#39;ll become a icky girl too. He&#39;s not exactly sure that&#39;s how the reality shifts works, but he doesn&#39;t want to risk it.<br />
<br />
But.... If he can bypass the reality shifts with his shape shifting powers.... Then why not have a little fun? He can just turn back into a racoon boy whenever he want.<br />
<br />
*POOF*<br />
<br />
Standing in front of the mirror was a tomboy-looking racoon girl. Rick is admitily a tad disappointed his girl form doesn&#39;t look that different from his boy form. He doubt anyone could tell the difference at first glance. Ragardless, he danced around in his new form to test out the slightly different sense of balance a mung other things.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow. I don&#39;t sound that different either.&quot; Rick observed. <br />
<br />
Hmm... maybe he should try a different species....<br />
<br />
*POOF*<br />
<br />
&quot;This is so cool!&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick&#39;s new form is that of a otter boy. Ever since seeing Martin&#39;s otter girl form, he kinda wondered what it was like to be a otter.<br />
<br />
The difference is a lot more noticeable then being a racoon girl. First off, he doesn&#39;t have as much fur has his recoon form. Yet strangly enough, he doesn&#39;t feel cold. He also feels more stronger in some places. It makes him wonder what it&#39;s like to swim in this new form...<br />
<br />
*KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK*<br />
<br />
&quot;Rick? You still awake?&quot; Marianne called out.<br />
<br />
*POOF*<br />
<br />
After the transformation smoke disipated, Rick the racoon boy opened the door and tried his best to pretend that nothing happened.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you want Marianne?&quot; Rick asked in the most anoyed time he could muster.<br />
<br />
&quot;I had a strange dream last night. I saw you back as a human.&quot; Marianne said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s just a dream. I haven’t been able to change back yet.&quot; Rick lied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm... do you think we will ever change back?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
Rick was a tad surprised that he wasn&#39;t the only one thinking about that.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... don&#39;t know. There&#39;s a lot we don&#39;t know. We don&#39;t even know how this happened. I wanted to ask around to see if anyone knows anything but... it&#39;s just... hard, you know?&quot;<br />
<br />
Marianne nodded to that. &quot;Yeah... Hey, maybe we can meet up tomorrow and try to investigate this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick nodded back. &quot;I wanted to do the same. Let&#39;s get everyone together and-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think having the others will just make things harder. It&#39;ll be easier to focus if it&#39;s just the two of us.&quot; Marianne interjected.<br />
<br />
After what happened this morning, Rick couldn’t deny her point.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot; Rick said.<br />
<br />
&quot;See you tomorrow then.&quot; Marianne said.<br />
<br />
She then went back to bed. After locking his door, Rick did the same.<br />
<br />
Rick the recoon boy let out a hearty yawn.<br />
<br />
He wanted play around with his shape shifting powers more, but that can wait till tomorrow. He can&#39;t go past his bed time!<br />
<br />
After a few restless minutes of brainstorming ways to use his powers, Rick fell to sleep on his bed eager for the second day of summer camp.</p>
