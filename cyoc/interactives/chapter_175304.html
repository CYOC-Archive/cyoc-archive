<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sam was not the type for hugs, he was a 16-year-old man who wanted to show his strength and hugging wasn’t part of that and neither was crying but he held on as long as he could now and tears where flowing out of his eyes as the wave passed over them all. He wasn’t the strongest man he knew, he was a second string varsity linebacker so he wasn’t weak but not even a world champion body builder could have prevented him from being forced apart from his family. He stumbled over the raised step which separated the living room and the hallway. He fell flat on his back and slammed his head back against the floor, it hurt a lot more then normal because the wooden floor had become stone. <br />
<br />
He rolled over getting on all fours his whole body hurting as somehow mass began to be added to his body, he would have felt his cloths ripping apart but instead his cloths began to turn to dust. He would have tried to cover himself, but he figured now no one really cared. He began to cough and cough hard as he gripped his chest as he felt like his lungs where going to explode due to the coughing. He felt like his teeth where being pulled and in a sense they were. He watched wide eyed as his teeth all his teeth began to fall out of his mouth before turning into dust. For a second after the last one fell, he felt nothing and he ran his tongue over his gums, his tongue felt weird longer and it should as he stuck it out and noticed it was forked. <br />
<br />
“Am I becoming a snake?” said Sam as suddenly his jaw pushed outward into a short, rounded muzzle as rows of sharp teeth burst from his gums. From his view he could now see watch as the skin around his mouth became flesh-colored scales before climbing up over the rest of his face. <br />
<br />
He was breathing heavily and then he fell to the ground in pain as he gripped his ass. It felt like something was being pulled out of his ass and in a way it was. His tail bone was growing outward as new bones, muscles and tendons grew outward along with scaly skin. He rolled over and pushed himself against the wall. His eyes where locked on his body and he saw he had grown wider and taller, his chest muscles looked like they belonged on a body builder and his legs and one of his arms looked just as jacked. His right arm however remained human. Coming out between his legs was a wide and thick tale which came to a point just past his legs. <br />
<br />
He was still a man, he had worried about that but his dick was now in a stealth like an animal and all his hair was gone. Scales where growing over his body at a rapidly rate, his feet changed as well, his toes merging into three large toes tipped with dark purple claws, a fourth toe was up near where his ankle was but it had a larger curved toe like a raptor from Jurassic park. His left hand still had five fingers but each one was tipped with short purple claws, still his right hand remained totally human and unchanged.<br />
<br />
“Am I becoming a dinosaur man?” inquired Sam as he noticed his voice was much deeper. <br />
<br />
He couldn’t see it but all the hair on the top of his head had disappeared and was replaced with rows of medium to small horns all of which were a deep purple began just above his eyes and moved down to the back of his neck and his eyes had changed to a purple color with a scale around his lips where purple as well. Then in a rush, the scales changed from a pink color becoming a grey and then a silver color. Cloths began to appear on his lower body, a pair of black paints with a hole in the back for his tail but his feet remained uncovered. He had never heard of a silver snake or a lizard man, but his answer came with another cough as a small amount of silver color flame shot out of his mouth. <br />
<br />
“I am a dragon man?” inquired Sam as he looked at his one still normal human hand. <br />
<br />
Sam had to fight back a scream again as his hand began to disappear, as it disappeared large pieces of metal took its place, but the pieces where not connected together inside a purplish energy connected the silver pieces of metal. Metal fingers as attached to a metal hand, which was attached to a metal forearm which was five different pieces of metal and so on up to his shoulder where it was attached to his scale covered flesh. <br />
<br />
He didn’t know what to say, he could feel his hand but his hand was now a robotic hand contained in some kind of purple energy. <br />
<br />
“What the fuck.” Said Sam as he felt more cloths appear on his chest. It was a dark purple shirt with black senders which went down to a large belt. The belt had three pouches and for some reason he knew that each of the pouches contained different chemicals and mixtures and he event knew what they did and he had sucked at Chemistry. A large black trench coat appeared on his lap ready for him to put on. Finally with a slight thump a large item landed on top of the coat, it looked like a rifle but instead of a metal barrel it was a large tube which had electrical energy dancing within it and at the end the barrel instead of hole there was a point where a small amount of energy was already gathered. <br />
<br />
“Mommy…Daddy?” cried his younger brother as Sam looked around, his eyes moved toward the front door to see an African American women who seamed maybe 10 years his senior standing by the door. She was God damn hot and was dressed to kill with leather straps over her breasts, her legs where black fur covered, and she had antlers coming out of the top of her head. She was looking toward the window.<br />
<br />
“Jane?” she said in a southern voice as Sam’s eyes widened as he looked toward the window to see a tall but breathtaking beautiful woman dressed in shinny armor with a sword on her hip and a pair of silver wings coming out of her back. She was maybe slightly older then the antler women but both women where beautiful and hot in every way possible.<br />
<br />
“Mike?” inquired the Angel as Sam realized that the two women he where looking at where his parents. He suddenly lost all attractiveness to them and felt somewhat sick at the idea. <br />
<br />
“Mom? Dad?” inquired Sam as both of their eyes shot to him for a moment, for a moment all three just looked at each other. “It’s me Sam.”<br />
<br />
“MOMMY….DADDY!” cried his little brother Luke again as Sam turned to see where his sister and little brother where.</p>
