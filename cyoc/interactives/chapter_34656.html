<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Cray, still the immobile monstrous behemoth of muscle breathing deeply on the floor of his living room was more than Guy could take.  He started to feel warm and his shirt began to feel a bit snug.  Snapping out of it he looked down to see his already substantial pecs pushing against the cotton of his t-shirt.  &quot;Oh shit!&quot; Guy said aloud, remembering the properties of the ointment, and how it was controlled by his subconcious.  Guy realized that by seeing Cray blow up into a mammoth, immobile muscle freak must have triggered his own inner desire to be the same way.<br />
<br />
Guy quickly began concentrating hard, 'I want to be 260 pounds, I want to be 260 pounds...'  After a few moments, the tightening of his shirt stopped.  He was about 10 pounds heavier than he had been, but still felt fine.  &quot;Thank god.&quot; Guy murmured.  He turned to see Cray still lying there, immobile, staring up at him from behind the stove-sized chest.  &quot;What the hell is going on, Guy?&quot; Cray said, sounding a bit angry and upset.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...&quot; And Guy went on to tell the immensely muscle-bound Cray what had happened.  How he had given Cray the ointment that made the taker's body into whatever he most deeply desired.  He also explained that it's effects were virtually irreversable and that he would probably be stuck with the ability to have the body he had always desired most in his inner most self.<br />
&quot;So...Your saying that I'm stuck...like THIS?!&quot; Cray asked Guy motioning with his eyes , virtually the only part of his body he still was able to move on his own, towards his enormous body.  &quot;Not necessarily!&quot; Guy said, &quot;If you can learn to control your sub conscience, you can let yourself have any kind of body you want!  That's why I'm no longer in your position, and am now able to move and find clothes big enough for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cray considered this, and in his own mind he realized that this may not be such a bad thing.  At first he had been furious at Guy for deceiving him, and making him into this unmovable monster, but then he realized that it HAD been what he had always wanted, to see what it would be like to grow so much muscle that he wouldn't be able to move.<br />
&quot;So what your saying is...&quot; Cray began, thinking carefully, &quot;If I can control my subconcious, I can have any kind of body I want?&quot;<br />
&quot;Exactly!&quot;  Guy said, &quot;Isn't it great!?&quot;<br />
&quot;We'll see about that,&quot; Cray said, and then he began concentrating hard on the bodies that were possessed by such men as Branch Warren, and Eddie Moyzan, and Jay Cutler.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Cray realized he was able to move his elbows slightly, and he could even turn his neck a little more.  He felt his whole body slowly becoming lighter.<br />
&quot;It's working!&quot; Guy said from somewhere behind him.<br />
&quot;I know, I can't believe it!&quot; Cray said, trying not to break his concentration.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, on the TV to the right of the fireplace, where Cray was facing, Cray just barely saw over his right pec that the football game had finished and the next program, a special on sumo-wrestling was in full swing.  Deep in his subconcious, Cray thought, 'I wonder what it would be like to be so fat and huge...'  No sooner had he thought that than his body began changing even more rapidly.<br />
&quot;Whoa, you must concentrating pretty hard!&quot; Guy laughed, but then he noticed something a little different in the changes.  Cray wasn't keeping his rock-hard, developed muscles, instead they were becoming more and more faint, and the crevices were slowly beginning to fill in.<br />
<br />
By this point, Cray was able to move enough to pull himself up into a sitting position, leaning against the couch.  Unaware of the odd changes taking place, he looked up at Guy.  Seeing the bewildered look on his face, he said, &quot;Whats wrong, Guy?  Didn't work this fast for you?&quot;  Smiling, Cray looked down at his body.  He still had his huge, but dwindling pecs, his arms were still bigger than what he had seen on any bodybuilder, but then he looked further down, his stomach, which had been a cobbled, rock-hard road not minutes earlier, was not bowing out even further than his muscle-gut had.  He reached up to touch it, and felt it was still fairly hard, but with a squishy layer of fat on top of it.  He looked down to his quads and saw that they were loosing all their definition and becoming great pillows and rolls of fat.  &quot;What the...!&quot; Cray started, looking up at Guy, who was equally amazed, it was then that Cray noticed the Sumo special on the TV. &quot;OH SHIT!&quot; Cray cried, &quot;I must have seen those sumo guys on TV and wanted to see what it would be like to be fat!&quot;<br />
<br />
Guy looked over at the television, and saw that it must have been what triggered Cray's abnormal growth.  &quot;How fat do you think you'll get?&quot; Guy asked looking back at Cray's swelling form.  &quot;How should I know, I only just realized that this is the body I want!&quot; Cray said sounding exasperated.  &quot;Although, it is kind of nice...really warm...&quot; he added.<br />
<br />
By now Cray's stomach was pushing out in a bulbous fashion over his spreading thighs, which were now billowing outwards, upwards and in between.  He had lost all definition all over his body, his pecs had become man-boobs, and drooped slightly over his enormous belly.  His arms folded down on themselves in layers of fat, as several chins appeared beneath his first one.  Soon his arms, legs, and chest gradually stopped swelling, but his great, globe of a belly continued to blow up in all directions.  &quot;You're getting so huge, man!&quot; Guy said amazed at what he was witnessing.  &quot;Augh! I know, when is this going to stop!&quot; Cray said.  Cray then tried to get his arms around the gargantuan gut, the tips of his fingers barely made it half way.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Guy and Cray heard a loud 'SNAP!'  &quot;Aw, shit!  My boxers!&quot; Cray said.  The stretchy material, that had been able to hold up for Cray's muscle growth, was not able to withstand the enormous belly, and had snapped at the sides.  Luckily, his great, round belly hid his family jewels from view.  Guy noticed also that Cray's belly wasn't exactly like those of the Sumo wrestlers being shown on TV.  It was firmer, and held its shape better.  It looked more like a gigantic beer belly bursting from Cray's now shrunken-looking frame, instead of a great, shapeless mass, like those of the wrestlers.  Most of the weight was being added to the front, with only a little going to Cray's love-handles.<br />
<br />
Finally, when it looked as though Cray had swallowed a horse, the growth stopped, and he let out a sigh of relief, still breathing heavily, &quot;Wow.&quot; was all he could muster.<br />
&quot;You're not kidding!&quot; Guy said, gazing at the humongous, fat man sitting before him.  &quot;Can you stand at least?&quot; he asked.<br />
&quot;I dunno,&quot; Cray answered, &quot;lets find out!&quot; <br />
<br />
Cray could not lean forward whatsoever with his enormous belly inhibiting his movement, so he rocked from side to side, until he finally rolled over onto his side and then quickly to his stomach, his head came no where NEAR the floor as his tremendous belly lifted him several feet from the ground.  His pudgy feet just barely brushed the ground, and his hands still could not reach more than half way around his stomach.  &quot;A little help, here?&quot; Cray said to Guy, who was now standing in front of him.  &quot;What do you want me to do??&quot; Guy answered, &quot;There's no way in hell I can lift you!&quot;  &quot;Dude, just push on my shoulders and rock me so that I can get my feet planted!&quot; Cray said, a little annoyed.<br />
&quot;Jeeze, alright, keep your shirt on!&quot; Guy said, &quot;or...not I guess!&quot; he joked.  Guy walked up to Cray and gave a great push on his shoulders, slowly rocking him back and forth on his bulbous belly, until after a few moments of rocking, Cray was able to plant his feet, and heave the great mass of his belly up from the floor, successfully standing on his own.<br />
<br />
Now Cray looked more amazing than ever, he seemed to defy gravity.  His massive belly did hang a bit, down to just above his knees, bowing out severely, his squishy legs, were not-so squishy-looking anymore, they were powerful, and thick, in order to support the tremendous weight of his stomach, but still had a few layers of fat folding on top of them.  His pillowy man boobs rested comfortably on the titanic stomach while his multiple chins rested on them.  His arms were thick and doughy and his fingers looked like plump sausages.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now that,&quot; Guy said, &quot;is FAT.&quot;</p>
