<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I had an idea to test the ring's abilities. Getting out my birth certificate I said, &quot;I wish I was born on July fourth nineteen seventy-three.&quot; The date listed did change. Getting out the clipping of my birth announcement I saw that had changed too as did my driver's license. That didn't mean anything though. The ring could have just changed the date on the documentation and not really change my birthday. How could I get proof of it? Then it came to me. I'd call my mom to see. If my birthday was changed she would know. But how would I ask her so I wouldn't seem crazy? Another idea occurred to me and I said, &quot;I wish that when I want I can make my voice sound like a woman's voice.&quot; To test it I said, &quot;I'm Rick,&quot; and it was in my regular male voice. Then trying for the woman's voice I said, &quot;I'm Kim.&quot; I smiled because it was a woman's voice.<br />
<br />
I picked up the phone and almost dialed when I thought about something. Not trying to make my voice sound like anything I said, &quot;This is a test.&quot; I was relieved that it was my normal voice. I dialed my mom's number and waited for her to pick up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello,&quot; my mom said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Mom,&quot; I said smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;How are you Rick?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I'm good. I've met someone but she doesn't believe me when I tell her what my birth date is. Could you tell her?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I will. Put her on.&quot;<br />
<br />
I moved the phone away from me and said, &quot;Here you go Kim. My mom will tell you what my birth date is.&quot; I transfered the phone to my left hand then said in my woman's voice, &quot;Hello Mrs. Johnson.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello dear,&quot; my mom said seeming to be oblivious to the fact she was still talking to me. &quot;Rick told me that you don't believe him when he said he was born on July fourth nineteen seventy-three.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So he was born on the fourth of July? Are you sure?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I should be sure as I gave birth to him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I just didn't think I'd meet anybody that was born on the fourth of July. I'll give you back to Rick now.&quot; The same switching tactic and I said in my regular voice, &quot;Thanks Mom.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's no problem. She sounds like a nice girl. You need to bring her with you the next time you come.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will,&quot; I said as I tried to figure out a way to do that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh did you hear the news?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What news?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Carol made quite a scene just a short while ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What did she do?&quot; I asked feigning ignorance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well according to your brother she was walking down the street and her clothes suddenly disappeared.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh that's impossible,&quot; I said trying to wave it off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well your brother happened to come on the crowd after her clothes reappeared on her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She proceeded to yell at you brother. The crowd all said the same thing. That her clothes had disappeared and then reappeared.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But that's not possible,&quot; I said trying to sound shocked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well apparently it is possible somehow. Has anything strange happened to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well take care and we'll see you and Kim soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bye Mom.&quot;<br />
<br />
I hung up the phone and began to think things over. It seemed that the ring could change the past but how much? Looking at a scar on my hand I said, &quot;I wish I never got this scar.&quot; It faded away. I still remembered the accident in which I received it but the scar wasn't there now. This wasn't getting me anywhere testing the ring like this. I needed to know what it's limitations were. Thinking carefully I made my next wish, &quot;I wish that I have something that tells me what this ring's limitations are.&quot; A piece of paper appeared and I picked it up reading what was on it.<br />
<br />
Wishing Ring of Al Bornaque<br />
<br />
This ring has the following limitations added by each master/mistress of the ring.<br />
<br />
1. The ring can not create life but can create a semblance of life which is indistinguishable from real life.<br />
<br />
2. The ring can not send someone back in time but it can change the past.<br />
<br />
3. The ring does not make any mental changes to it's master/mistress.<br />
<br />
4. The ring can not make any direct mental changes to a living being.<br />
<br />
5. The ring can not be removed from it's master/mistress' finger.<br />
<br />
6. The ring can not grant a wish that isn't at least whispered unless it's master/mistress is unable to say the wish.<br />
<br />
7. The ring can not grant a wish that will result in the death of a living being.<br />
<br />
The name of the ring sounded like it was Arabian. The list of limitations made sense and I recognized the last two as the ones I made. It stood to reason that the rest of the limitations must have been made by previous master/mistresses of the ring. I thought of another wish and said, &quot;I wish that I have memories consistent with the changes done to the past while keeping my present memories intact.&quot; Now to test that part. &quot;I wish that I was born on July fourth nineteen ninety-seven.&quot;<br />
<br />
My transformation started with me losing the belly I had gained since high school. And then I started shrinking. I went from my five foot eight height to an even five foot. I lost just a little muscle during this but not much since I never really had that much muscle. My clothes remained pretty much the same but shrunk to fit me. As soon as my transformation was done I felt like something was forcing me to sit down as my apartment vanished. What appeared was a classroom and I was sitting in a desk. The memories I was aware of now said this was Social Studies with Mr. Smith. It was next to last period. Next period was P.E.<br />
<br />
As Mr. Smith continued the lesson I thought that this was pretty good but there was something else I wanted to see. Ms. Billings, or as I knew her Carol, was the girl's P.E. teacher. From what I had heard I thought that she was doing stuff with a few of the girls in last period P.E. I had the opportunity to see if that was true. I took a quick glance around. I was in the back and it looked like everyone was paying attention to Mr. Smith so I should be ok to whisper my wish. I had to word it carefully though as I knew I had gotten lucky to stay in the same city when I regressed. Finally deciding on the wording I whispered, &quot;I wish that I was born a girl with the name Kimberly Lynn Johnson. I attend this same school and I'm in Ms. Billings' last period P.E. class.&quot;<br />
<br />
With my wish finished I felt my penis stirring. I knew that it was shrinking down to form my clit while my balls formed my ovaries. I grew a quarter inch which was mostly from my legs. My hair grew longer until it was down to my mid back. I felt a tightness in my chest as I grew breasts which ended up being an A cup. I watched my arms slim some and my hands become more feminine. I knew that my legs and feet had done the same thing. My hips widened just a little bit but my waist stayed the same. My shoulders narrowed and my face became more feminine. I felt a pinch in my ears as they became pierced and earrings appeared in them.<br />
<br />
My clothes shifted to become more feminine. My shirt changed color to a soft pink. My pants shortened until they were just above the knee and then the legs flared out and joined together giving me a skirt. My briefs shrank and reformed into panties. A bra appeared around my chest as my socks disappeared. The top of my shoes opened up forming straps over the top of my feet and the sole changed leaving me with a pair of sandals. A locket appeared around my neck while baby pink nail polish appeared on my toe and finger nails which were well taken care of. Finally a pink Alice Band appeared on my head and a purse appeared next to my backpack.<br />
<br />
I smiled as I took stock of my new life as Mr. Smith continued to teach. It didn't look like anyone noticed my transformation but then again I had said that I was born a girl so even if they had witnessed it they wouldn't have. The bell rang and with a smile on my face I went to girl's P.E.</p>
