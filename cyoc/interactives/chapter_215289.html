<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Shawna swayed into the crowd, drinking in the stares of the women around him. She moved in time with the music as she looked around, seeing her two friends already having fun. Danae and Jalisa were already on the prowl for someone else to join in them bed, all the while getting some good drinks to go with the hunt. It was time for her to maybe get hunting too. <br />
<br />
She had her pick of girls already. A few had rubbed against her while on the dance floor, another gave her a wink and flashed her bra. A little red head, deep in her cups, licked her lips and beckoned her over. But Shawna wanted to scope the place out before enjoying her night.<br />
<br />
Deep into the crowd, something drew her eye. A woman sitting at the end of the bar, and one she should have recognized. She was 50 years old, thin, 5’0’’ feet tall, with short dark blond hair, and blue eyes. A middle aged woman, married, to, she was out here getting wild out in her sexy golden dress that pushed up her boobs more than needed. She felt quite familiar to Shawna, and this one fact made her come over to see just what this woman was to her. Closer she moved until her mind, or rather, her old mind, put together who she was. <br />
<br />
&quot;MOM???? What the hell are you doing here?&quot; Shawna blurted out, without even realizing it. She clasped her mouth close hoping no one had heard her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me, what do you.. hic, mean?&quot; said Shawna (Sean)’s mother, gazing at the black Amazon before her as if she said the Earth was flat.<br />
<br />
Shawna was about to reply when she realized that no one could ever recognize him in a woman’s body. That and his..., her mother, had been here awhile and was in her cups pretty bad. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well… ok… I know you won’t believe me, but I’m Sean, your son!&quot; Shawna hissed, trying to keep her voice down from the other patrons. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, yeah, ok… now, I understand if you want to do something with me, but couldn’t you invent something far more believable? Something about making me call you &#39;mommy&#39; or something?&quot; slurred the older woman.<br />
<br />
&quot;But it’s true! Come with me, I’ll tell you everything!&quot; she said, pulling at the woman&#39;s arm. <br />
<br />
So, Sean’s mother, Diana, followed Shawna to a little sofa off in a corner; she was sure that she wouldn’t be convinced at all by what that woman would say, but man! The Amazon was totally gorgeous! It was an opportunity absolutely not to miss. Maybe she could spin this weird pick up line into a one night stand. So she passed the next minutes listening to Shawna…<br />
<br />
Later...<br />
<br />
&quot;And that&#39;s the story. Believe me now?&quot; Shawna finished before taking a drink. <br />
<br />
&quot;So you get this computer program..., and you make yourself into a thick toned black Amazon lesbian, and hit a butch bar, only to bump into your mom..., who you decide to just blurt this whole thing out to?&quot; Diana asked, playing out the idea in her head again, &quot;No I don&#39;t believe you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You don’t? Ok! Follow me, I’ll prove you! And if I&#39;m wrong..., well you can have your way with me!&quot; Shawna declared. <br />
<br />
She wasn&#39;t sure why she&#39;d go THAT far, after all this person was her mother..., well not currently. And she was pretty good looking, even at her age, but ... wait what was Sean thinking? What was was Shawna thinking? When did one stop and the other actually begin? The mind inside the body was starting to process before the woman spoke. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ok now there&#39;s a bet, but don&#39;t you complain when your tight ass is mine.&quot; the woman responded as she got up and followed Shawna. <br />
<br />
She quickly poked in on her friends, each one having a lovely red head on their thighs as more drinks were brought in. Seems they were al set to party. Shawna headed to her car, &#39;mother&#39; in tow then they went to the Campus and walked up to Shawna&#39;s place. Diana&#39;s eyes gazed over the place, wondering if she&#39;d be tossed to the couch, or just brought to the bedroom. Turns out it was the latter. Bedroom wasn&#39;t might to speak of, but fit for a collage aged girl. Diana stood off to the side while Shawna moved around. <br />
<br />
“I wonder what do you have for me, baby…” thought Diana. She noticed a few toys on the floor of the closet. <br />
<br />
Shawna turned the computer on, then opened the Chronivarc, opening up the program and getting ready to revert some changes. She turned and had to snap her fingers a few times to get attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you can stop staring at my ass for a moment, you can see me telling you the truth.&quot; she told Diana and pushed the enter button. <br />
<br />
Her muscles faded and skin lightened up. Those full lips gone as a more masculine pair replaced it. A have shaved chin replaced the checkes, and those abs, gone in liu of someone who does push ups but not much else. A few seconds after the transformation, Sean was standing before his mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god...&quot;  said her, with the eyes open wide as she sat on the bed, &quot;It works... what the..&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I told you.&quot; he answered smiling as he moved to the side, to let his mother get a better look at the program. <br />
<br />
&quot;This is Unbelievable… amazing… so what you told me is true! You can change reality!&quot; Diana exclaimed as she looked over the settings. <br />
<br />
All that power at his fingertips and he went to have fun on a night out. As a black lesbian; well, he had good taste. Better taste than his father at least. He went for some young intern with just legs...., did explain a few things. But Sean had inheirted her own taste in women; big, ethnic, and strong. Thoughts and desires rain through her mind as she started to type out commands. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I can… but… can you explain me why were you in that lesbian club???&quot; He finally notice his mother was starting to input commands, &quot;Hey what...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shhh, let momma work, &quot; whispered his mother, as she finished her work, &quot;I&#39;ll show you soon dear.&quot;  Did her voice sound… deeper? Sensual?<br />
<br />
She spun on he heels and walked away, and Sean realized what she had done. While she walked she moaned with pleasure, her shape changing as the machine worked on her. Her clothes ripped as flesh grew and bones lengthened, growing in height to 7 feet tall. Her Face became younger and sexier every second, her breasts firming up and ballooning to basketball size before surging forward. Butt and hips expanding to huge measures, tearing her clothes to shreds. Her body growing fit and firm, but maintaining a very feminine knockout hourglass shape. With one last moan, her skin darkened to a chocolate brown, and her hair changed to a wavy black to blonde Ombre style. Her ruined dress reformed around her body, turning into a slutty looking cocktail dress with a short hem and plenty of cleavage <br />
<br />
Sean was so surprised from his mother’s transformation that he didn’t notice that he was in Shawna’s body again. And not just the the way she had been before. She was much taller now, stronger, and bigger; it was as if Diana took the Shawna profile, augmented it, and copied it to both of them. The two looked like twins now, only with different dresses and hair styles. <br />
<br />
And she was the hottest woman Shanwa had ever seen. <br />
<br />
Once the transformation finished, Diana walked slowly to Shawna, purposely putting a sway in her step to show off all her new curves. She cupped Shawn&#39;s chin and pulled her in, giving her a deep, sensual kiss. <br />
<br />
&quot;David cheated. I wanted a fling with someone that would never get back to him, nor leave me with problems. So I to a place no one would know me, for an itch I hadn&#39;t scratched in years. Now now, you give me this.&quot; She said breaking off the kiss and leaving Shawna reeling, &quot;But now I get to have the ultimate night out. Or in, if you wanna swing that way &#39;sis&#39;. But with or without you, I wanna have some fun.&quot;</p>
