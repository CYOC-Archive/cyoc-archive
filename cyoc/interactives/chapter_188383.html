<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mark wasn&#39;t excited to hear that, but turning to look at Amanda, she was indeed an inch taller than her now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why did I shrink so much? Girls can be taller too!&quot; Mark said, slightly worried.<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know... I guess if you had been born a girl, you wouldn&#39;t have been as tall as me?&quot; Amanda responded.<br />
&quot;Anyway, that&#39;s beside the point. The hourglass... you got it, right??&quot; Mark asked with a worried expression.<br />
&quot;Yeah, yeah. calm down. It was actually not as expensive as you&#39;d think.&quot; Amanda said, pulling on gloves.<br />
&quot;What are the gloves for?&quot; Mark asked.<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t want to be cursed by the hourglass too! I talked to the shop owner about the hourglass. As long as I don&#39;t touch it with my bare skin, I won&#39;t be affected.&quot; She said, proceeding to pull the hourglass out of the bag. Mark could see that about 90% of the sand had already passed to the bottom half.<br />
&quot;Ok quick! turn it over already!&quot; Mark said impatiently. <br />
&quot;Yes... if we turn it over, you should turn back into a boy. But..... what&#39;s the rush? Don&#39;t you want to see how cute you look when the transformation is complete?&quot; Amanda said with a smirk.<br />
&quot;Wait, what??&quot; Mark said in a shocked voice. However, deep inside, she had to admit that she was curious. &quot;Ok fine. But we&#39;re flipping it over as soon as we see.&quot;<br />
As they had been talking, a third of the remaining sand had fallen. Amanda started walking around Mark, examining her naked body. After a moment, she stopped, obviously looking directly at mark&#39;s boobs.<br />
Suddenly, Mark felt an insecurity she had never felt before. &quot;What, is something wrong??&quot; she asked.<br />
Amanda, didn&#39;t say anything, but suddenly started stripping down.<br />
&quot;What are you doing?? I&#39;m right here!&quot; Mark said, surprised. Amanda wasn&#39;t usually this bold.<br />
&quot;Oh, it just felt so natural, seeing as your... a girl just like me&quot; Amanda replied. <br />
Mark looked at Amanda. Wow, she had a nice body. While her boobs weren&#39;t that big, they looked big enough on her slender body. Mark had imagined the first moment of seeing her girlfriend naked a thousand times. Now that Mark was a girl though, she wasn&#39;t sure what she&#39;d feel now... but was happy to discover that she still got very horny as she looked over her girlfriend&#39;s sexy body. It was a little strange though without the sensation of an erection coming on.<br />
Mark then looked down as her own body. <br />
&quot;Oh, that&#39;s what you were looking at...&quot; Mark said, reaching for her boobs.<br />
Grasping her boobs and squeezing them gently, Mark gasped... a girlish and lustful gasp. They were now larger than Amanda&#39;s.<br />
Looking up, she meant Amanda&#39;s glare. &quot;Don&#39;t. Say. Anything.&quot; Was all Amanda said about it.<br />
It was then that Mark realized how tall Amanda looked. She had to be at least 3 inches taller than herself now!<br />
Looking back at the hourglass, there was still a little bit of sand in the top half. <br />
Amanda, with her right hand still gloved, started tapping on the glass. The sand fell in short bursts with each tap.<br />
&quot;What are you...?&quot; But Mark was too distracted to finish her sentence. With each tap, her height was shortened in bursts of about a centimeter, and her breasts where practically flailing around with their rapid growth bursts.<br />
Then, it all stopped. The sand had all fallen. Amanda turned to Mark. <br />
Mark suddenly felt very vulnerable with Amanda practically towering over her. There was probably 6 inches of difference... putting Mark at.... 5 feet flat?! &quot;Wow, I&#39;m a *short* girl.&quot; She thought to herself. <br />
Meanwhile, Amanda was giving Mark a strange look.<br />
&quot;What, is something wrong?&quot; She tried asking in a panicked voice... but her voice was way too dainty and feminine to instill any real levels of panic.<br />
Silently, Amanda pulled out a hand mirror. Mark stared at her own reflection, and instantly understood. Her face was fairly feminine when she had looked earlier... but now, it was the cutest face she had ever seen. Mark then noticed her own hair. She had perfect bangs and long, straight hair. Given the impact of the other changes happening at the same time, she hadn&#39;t noticed.<br />
Suddenly excited to see the full results, she raced up stairs, with Amanda behind her. While she had experienced her boobs bouncing on the stairs before, this time was almost nothing like before. Her boobs were bouncing to an uncomfortable degree! She paused briefly, held her two large breasts with her hands, and raced the rest of the way up the stairs, feeling her boobs push against her hands with each step.<br />
<br />
Standing in front of the full body mirror again, she was shocked. In the mirror was the most perfect girl she had ever seen. Dazzling blue eyes with long eyelashes, a cute petite nose, a slender neck, and a dainty frame with generous curves. Hefting her boobs up, they had to be almost twice the size of Amanda&#39;s! It was surreal to look down into those perfectly round breasts. Still looking down, in-between those perfect curves she could see a slender stomach, and slightly wider waist. And below that, two perfectly soft thighs with a seemingly obvious void between them. Then down to slender legs and dainty feet.<br />
&quot;Wow.&quot; It was the first time Amanda spoke since the transformation had completed.<br />
&quot;Yeah... I make an amazing girl! ... But I guess it&#39;s time to turn me back now.&quot; Mark replied.<br />
Amanda hesitated, not sure how to respond at first. In the shop, the owner had informed her that no one is born 100% male or 100% female. The hourglass had the power to take a person to their &quot;perfect&quot; male or female form.<br />
&quot;Maybe it&#39;s fate though.... You have to admit, you look way better as a girl. It would be a shame to turn you back so soon.<br />
&quot;Yeah.... you&#39;re right!&quot; Mark admitted... a little too quickly. She was still busy looking at the mirror, looking down, squeezing her boobs together, and obviously enjoying the experience very much.<br />
It was so surreal to Mark. She had seen boobs online countless times... but looking straight down into a pair of D-cup perfectly round and soft boobs was a whole different experience. Not to mention the sensations that came with it. Pushing them together made the perfect cleavage, and sent spasms of pleasure through her boobs. Maybe it was because the sensations were new... but they felt so strong it was nearly unbearable.<br />
&quot;Come on... I&#39;ll help you explore&quot; Amanda said in a strangely lustful voice, gesturing towards the bed.<br />
&quot;You wait here. I&#39;ll be right back.&quot; Amanda said.<br />
Mark didn&#39;t mind waiting, with her hands caressing her entire body, fondling the curves around her slender stomach and butt, and feeling the space between her legs, which gave her a new, burning lust that went deep into her like it never did when she was a boy.<br />
A moment later, Amanda returned. &quot;Let&#39;s get started!&quot; She said, and, as if unable to resist, started pushing her boobs against Mark&#39;s larger boobs.<br />
Mark had always imagined what having boobs pushed against her felt.... but the sensation she was experiencing now was likely far different then what it would have felt normally. The soft boobs pushed into each other, nipples colliding and sending sparks of pleasure through Mark. She let out a groan, and Amanda took an opportunity and pushed her down into bed.</p>
