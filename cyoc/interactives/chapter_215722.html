<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">*BEEP BEEP BEEP*<br />
<br />
The girl&#39;s sudden return to consciousness was followed by a low grunt and an arm shooting out from beneath the heavy comforter, which clumsily flailed in the air before finding the source of the horribly intrusive noise and whacking the small button on top. Silence filled the cozy, warm room again as the arm slithered back into the protective nest of soft fabrics and cushions, nestling against her breasts as she once more returned to dreamland. For fifteen minutes, at least.<br />
<br />
*BEEPBEEPBEEP*<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohmigawd fuckin&#39; FINE&quot; The girl cursed as she once again silenced the alarm after a shockingly brief fifteen minutes had passed. This time the girl lifted herself out of the soft, comfortable and warm large bed and rubbed her bleary eyes with a tiny hand, her frizzy, curly red locks hanging off her head at random angles. She let out a large yawn, her strong, toned arms stretching upwards, feeling the two substantial twins on her chest shift and jiggle as she continued to wake from her slumber, her nipples tingling against the fabric of the overly large shirt she had worn to bed the previous night.<br />
<br />
From her point of view it still WAS night. The next day didn&#39;t start until the sky was blue and the sun was cresting the horizon. But as usual the universe refused to listen to her. 5am was too fucking early and she swore to never get used to it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh&quot; She grunted again, and almost petulantly swung the comforter away from her bare, slender legs and naked feet. And she sat there on the bed for another minute or so as the rest of her brain booted up, the passive information needed for consciousness pouring in. Or more like dripping sometimes, if she had to be honest with herself. But eventually she pulled herself out of bed and treaded across the carpet and opened the door to her bedroom, cursing under her breath as her eyes were temporarily blinded by the hallway light. She took a step forward, and another, and before she knew it she was opening the linen closet and taking out a towel with the practiced ease of muscle memory. She slid into the door next to the closet and quickly shut it behind her, pressing the small door lock and counting to ten.<br />
<br />
*BANG BANG BANG*<br />
<br />
&quot;You turd muffin! It&#39;s MY turn to take a shower first Jocelyn!&quot; Came a high pitched screech from the other side of the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, go write a paper about it, LILLIAN!&quot; The girl yelled back, sticking her tongue out even though the figure on the other side of the door couldn&#39;t see. And then she ignored the follow-up insult, shedding her sleeping shirt and briefs and strutting naked over to the bath-tub, pausing only for a second to look at herself in the mirror.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, stranger&quot; She said with a sad smile. The tawny-hazel goddess in the mirror returned the smile, her hazel-flecked green eyes wandering over her busty, athletic form, from her double-ds, her red-brown curls, her curvy hips and lingering for just a moment on the immaculate void that she&#39;d been forced to become accustomed to. And the brief ritual over, the girl slid into the shower and welcomed the feel of hot water against her skin for just a moment before she began lathering herself up.<br />
<br />
After all, the water temperature was known to fluctuate wildly if she took too long.<br />
<br />
&#39;Plus it is sort of my fault. Dumbass should have put the phone down instead of staying up until 1am&#39; Jocelyn thought to herself. But it had been a habit that had followed her, plus she couldn&#39;t turn down any potential avenue for escape from this charmed life. It was her secret obsession that she shared with no one. Not Lily or Russel or her dad. Especially not her mom.<br />
<br />
Jocelyn finished her shower as quickly as she could and wrapped her towels around her curved form and the dripping nest of her hair as she tried, in vain, to make the typical morning ritual move as fast as it could. Drying her hair was the worst, but she couldn&#39;t cut it to be more manageable. Her mom wouldn&#39;t let her, and she had to follow what mom said. Another part of the universe taking it&#39;s eternal dump on her. But makeup had become a simple thing, luckily so long as she wore SOME, mom didn&#39;t really care about Jocelyn&#39;s appearance otherwise. Not like she really needed all that much to begin with.<br />
<br />
The genetic apple, after all, hadn&#39;t fallen too far from the tree.<br />
<br />
Her routine finished, Jocelyn opened the door and gave a little bit of a flourish to the scowling face in front of her. The girl was slightly older than Jocelyn, her dreadlocked hair a deeper red, contrasting harshly with her amber skin and brown eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was MY turn, Josie&quot; Lily pouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know I just-You can have it tomorrow okay?&quot; Jocelyn said apologetically.<br />
<br />
&quot;...Fine but if you don&#39;t I&#39;m going to start flushing every toilet in this house every time you take a shower&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well maybe I&#39;ll start riding a bike to school then. ONE of us has to care about the environment&quot;<br />
<br />
The two sisters glared at each other for a moment before their lips split into a mirror of perfectly pearly white smiles accompanied by some soft giggling before Lily reached out and gave her little sister a soft shoulder squeeze before moving into the bathroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re still a turd muffin! And maybe I WILL write that paper!&quot; She said, sticking out her tongue as the door swung closed.<br />
<br />
&quot;At least people would read it if it&#39;s about me!&quot; Jocelyn said with another giggle before she returned to her room to finish getting ready for the day. She crossed the darkened threshold and flicked on the light, illuminating the once dark cavern and frowning at the overly girly display. There was always so much...pink. And white. She would have loved to decorate her room as she wanted, but mother loved pink and white. Especially pink. But at least she was allowed to put up &#39;appropriate&#39; posters to block out some of it. And other than her huge bed, the makeup table that she hadn&#39;t used in years and the desk that was littered with her advanced placement homework, the bedroom was a spartan affair. As if she was hesitant to truly make it hers. At least Jocelyn was allowed more freedom for her wardrobe now. The mixed-race goddess removed the towel from her torso and threw it into the nearby clothes hamper before moving into the enormous closet that housed all of her many, many outfits and shoes. And the big modelling mirror.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s see...&quot; She muttered to herself after tossing on a bra and panties, turning to browse the racks of expensive clothing. Eventually she decided she was feeling a bit more &#39;classic&#39; today, and opted for throwing on one of the tiny novelty shirts she typically had to beg her mother to let her buy. Jocelyn gave her reflection a grin as the Starfleet logo was stretched across her bust in such a way that distorted the iconic symbol, but it felt right. She threw on a red flannel over shirt and a pair of slightly grunge jeans and jut a basic pair of Converse sneakers. And selected the brown leather purse to take with her today. It was small and out of the way. But she picked out a secondary outfit choice. Just in case.<br />
<br />
Casting a look at the clock, she couldn&#39;t help but smile. 6am, October 20th, 2020. Her &#39;birthday&#39;. Her new one, at least.<br />
<br />
Grabbing her backpack and shoveling the schoolwork into it Jocelyn departed her bedroom and made her way through the large home&#39;s second floor, taking the stairs downward two at a time and regretting it as her boobs bounced painfully against her. And from the first floor foyer, she made a left and moved through the picture-book dining room and it&#39;s massive oak table and chandelier and into the huge kitchen, where the smells of breakfast wafted from.<br />
<br />
It was bigger than any house she&#39;d been in before, that was for sure.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh gross!&quot; Jocelyn groaned as she entered the kitchen, averting her eyes as her parents embraced near the sizzling bacon.<br />
<br />
&quot;A man&#39;s gotta eat&quot; Came the rumbling chuckle of Roland Davis as he gave his wife another deep kiss, this time squeezing her sizable ass, earning him a pleasurable squeal from the radiant redhead in his arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bleh, I just lost my appetite!&quot; Jocelyn groaned again, sticking a finger in her mouth and scrunching her face up in disgust.<br />
<br />
&quot;Josie, behave&quot; Her mother said, finally uncoupling from the towering ebony skinned giant that had ensconced her in his embrace. She watched her daughter&#39;s improper behavior cease immediately and her curly redhead turn towards the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry mom&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mere and get a whiff of this bacon Josie! Bet it&#39;s the best you&#39;ve ever smelled!&quot; Roland said, letting of his wife go and reaching out with an arm that had no business being that long or that muscled for a man his age and pulled his youngest daughter into the small family group.<br />
<br />
&quot;You say that every morning, dad&quot; Jocelyn groaned with a roll of her eyes, but she couldn&#39;t deny it was true as she felt her mouth water. She reached out to grab a slice of bacon from her father&#39;s already prepared plate, but her mother placed a soft white hand over hers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Josie, I have your special bacon cooking. It&#39;ll be ready soon. You don&#39;t want this to ruin your figure, after all&quot; Her mother said sternly, and Jocelyn retracted her hand immediately.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry mom. It just, uh, it smells so good! One slice won&#39;t hurt anything!&quot; She pleaded, but the immaculate face of the gorgeous redhead didn&#39;t budge.<br />
<br />
&quot;All it takes is one slip to mess up your diet, honey. How about you go wait in the living room and I&#39;ll text you when your breakfast is ready?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay mom. Sorry.&quot; Jocelyn said, almost on command. She gave her dad a squeeze and shuffled out of the kitchen, knowing the two pairs of eyes were watching her. But she had to listen to her mom. That was just life now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eve, you gotta let up on her. A slice of bacon on her 18th birthday isn&#39;t gonna ruin anything&quot; Roland said quietly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m her mother. I told her I&#39;d always take care of her and so long as she&#39;d listen to me, she&#39;d be safe&quot; Evelyn Davis-Kazinski said with a shrug.</p>
