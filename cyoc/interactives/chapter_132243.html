<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Your mother went and dropped you off at the kindergarten a little before class started and said &quot;Bye Sam, have a good day!&quot; <br />
You smiled and said back &quot;Sure! I&#39;ll be off now!&quot; You skipped your way inside the building to find there was a few other kids about your age in the class already with a lot of different races. There were humans, dwarves, a few orcs, and even a tiefling. You were a little nervous and wasn&#39;t sure what to do as a lot of the kids were already chatting with each other.<br />
An older voice said &quot;Ah hello there little one, mind if I asked your name?&quot; You looked and saw a woman who seemed to be in her  mid twenties, although looking closer she seemed to have some elvish features. Probably a half elf actually in her  fifties but she seemed friendly as she said &quot;I&#39;ll be your teacher for the year, Ms. Sleigh&quot; <br />
You looked to her and said &quot;I&#39;m Sam... What should I do?&quot; <br />
Ms. Sleigh chuckled and said &quot;Go put your bag in one of the cubbies, and take a seat anywhere.&quot; You did as she instructed and took a seat that wasn&#39;t next to anyone yet in a corner. <br />
A few minutes past and a girl sat next to you and said &quot;Hi! I&#39;m Daria! May I ask your name?&quot; You looked at her for a second and saw the human had long chestnut hair in pigtails, and was wearing a plain blue dress. <br />
You said &quot;My name&#39;s Sam...&quot; <br />
Daria smiled and said &quot;Well then Sam nice to meet you!.. Class seems to be starting.&quot; <br />
<br />
Ms. Sleigh was in front of the classroom and said &quot;Welcome everyone, I&#39;m Ms. Sleigh your teacher for kindergarten. It&#39;s great to be teaching you all. Through the year we&#39;ll be learning some basic math, and how to read! However for today i&#39;ll go ahead and start us off with a story. Anyone ever heard of a Genie before?&quot; <br />
You raised your hand and getting called on you said &quot;A Genie is some all powerful spirit usually sealed away.&quot; <br />
Ms. Sleigh said &quot;Indeed, and for my story it&#39;ll be about a foolish man who finds a genie. So, Once upon a time in a far off land a man was running away from some guards for stealing a little food. While running he hid himself in a dungeon where it was very dark. In the dark he found a lamp that was really dusty. He took it to light so he could see in the dungeon and dusted it off. While rubbing the lamp a genie inside it was partially freed, the genie begged the man to be let out. The man forced the genie to grant him a wish for freeing him. The man fully broke the seal and the genie came out and asked the man what he wanted. The man wished for a ton of treasure. The genie being a bit irritated gave him what he wanted, and a pile of treasure appeared over the man crushing him... Anyone want to guess what the moral of the story is?... Anyone?...&quot; Ms. Sleigh waited a minute and sighed then said &quot;Moral is that using magic as a short cut and short sighted wishes tend to backfire heavily.&quot; <br />
Daria whispered in a joking fashion next to you &quot;Well I wish that class was over.&quot; At which point you went into an odd trance with Daria asking &quot;Sam are you ok? what&#39;s with the face?&quot; <br />
You in your trance thought &quot;Class ending... How to do that? I can&#39;t fast forward time... Oh a fire, that would be simple. They&#39;d have to evacuate and... That&#39;s simple&quot; at which time some of your immense magical power leaked and a large fire caught on one of the curtains. <br />
Sleigh noticed immediately  and said &quot;Alright class, let&#39;s all go outside.... Hurry now.&quot; She managed to get everyone out of the building safely before it spread too far and pulled the fire alarm. You and Daria were next to each other with Daria crying Sleigh making her way and checking with the kids made it to the two of you and asked &quot;Daria what&#39;s the matter? Was there a toy you brought with you?&quot; <br />
Daria shook her head and bawling said &quot;You were right... wishes do backfire...&quot; <br />
Sleigh said &quot;What on Serra do you mean?&quot; <br />
Daria responded still crying &quot;I I I... I had wished class was over... And it came true!&quot; and started crying even more. <br />
Sleigh responded with &quot;I don&#39;t think this could be at all your fault.&quot; but unable to really calm her down went to try to calm down everyone else. <br />
<br />
You said a bit teary as well &quot;Daria... I think i&#39;m a bit more responsible than you.&quot; <br />
Daria asked &quot;Huh, why?&quot; <br />
You said &quot;All you did was make the wish... You couldn&#39;t have known what would have happened. Can you keep a secret?&quot; Daria nodded and then you whispered in her ear &quot;I&#39;m actually half-genie... I may have accidentally started the fire...&quot; You felt guilty about it and tried to explain &quot;Whenever I hear someone wish something... I just feel like I have to give them their wish. Like if I don&#39;t I&#39;d die or something. It just so happened that this time the easiest way was to... It&#39;s not like I can really control it or anything.&quot; <br />
Daria stared at you and then said &quot;Well... Wait you can&#39;t control who you  grant wishes to?&quot; <br />
You nodded and said more in whispers &quot;No, I can&#39;t which is why my mother worried about bringing me to kindergarten.&quot; <br />
Daria then said &quot;Well then... I wish you would grant wishes to a person who just rubbed your head.&quot; you went into your trance for a second as Daria said &quot;Ah, that&#39;s the face!&quot; <br />
You then snapped out of your trance and said &quot;my head hurts a little...&quot;<br />
Daria said jokingly &quot;I wish you were a boy.&quot; then seeing you look confused said &quot;it worked... now then.&quot; she rubbed the front of your head and said &quot;I wish the fire was out...&quot; and you went into your trance. Then the clouds in the sky started to group together and become dark as rain started to come down. The fire was dissipating as the fire truck came in, and everyone in the field hadn&#39;t brought an umbrella and a lot of the kids were screaming. <br />
<br />
Your mother came to get you before Daria&#39;s parents could, and around that time Sleigh came by and said &quot;Daria, your mother can&#39;t come right now. Mind if I ask you come with us to the office?&quot; <br />
Daria pouted and said &quot;Aw... I wish I could still play with Sam for now...&quot; <br />
Your mother said &quot;You have her number? They seem like having fun, I could call and ask if I could bring her home for a little play date. I don&#39;t live that far away.&quot; A phone call later and the two of you were driving home. <br />
<br />
In the care you said &quot;Sorry mom... It was me and a bad wish...&quot; <br />
Daria said &quot;On the bright side she has a little more control of her genie thing now!&quot; <br />
your mother said &quot;Wait, Sam you told her about that?&quot; <br />
You said &quot;She was scared... It felt like the right thing to do.&quot; <br />
Daria said &quot;I did come up with a clever wish though! I wished she would only grant a wish to someone who rubbed her head!&quot; <br />
it was at a stop light and your mother groaned a bit and you asked &quot;Mommy, are you ok?!?&quot; <br />
she said &quot;yes i&#39;m fine... Just very irritated with myself for not thinking of something like that sooner.&quot; <br />
You said &quot;Well daddy came from a box and not a lamp right?&quot; <br />
<br />
At home you and Daria had fun, and tried to wish the kindergarten back... Although during your trance it ended early with you saying monotonely &quot;can&#39;t do it...&quot; With the school burned down you and Daria needed to go to a new school... Which also happened to be different schools. You tried to get your mom to wish you two in the same schools but it ended with you saying &quot;can&#39;t do it...&quot; probably as it would require either mind control, shifting the earth to get one of the schools closer to one of you, or changing the economic system to allow affordable transport. it was just not going to happen. You were happy you could go out in public now and figured out that if you wore a hat and someone rubbed your head you wouldn&#39;t grant a wish, but you were sad your friend was gone and couldn&#39;t quite muster the courage to get another friend or to really trust anyone with the knowledge of your heritage.</p>
