<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next day she awoke to the innkeeper demanding she vacate the room or pay for another night.  She&#39;d slept late, it seemed.  She left the inn and headed for the town square to check out the quest board after buying herself a decent looking set of women&#39;s clothing.  Maybe there was a simple errand she could perform to get yourself to level 3.  Or maybe she should just buy a skill potion to get fireball to level 3, since leveling skills seemed to be more effective than leveling your character, at least at the early levels.  She couldn&#39;t hunt rab-bats anymore, after all, but maybe after leveling herself and her fireball to level 3 she could hunt grimshrooms or venom beetles, or even join a party.<br />
<br />
As she looked at the board, she became aware of a pair of eyes on her.  She turned to look, and saw a boy her age blush and look away.  Cute.  He was cute, and seemed innocent.  She wasn&#39;t sure when she&#39;d become ok with checking out guys, but she knew she definitely preferred to be checking out that guy than to be drooling over some evil bandit or naked rab-bat man in her succubus form.  He looked back, and before she even knew what she was doing she&#39;d given him a wink and a smile.  She must be crazy.  The boy&#39;s face brightened up and a dreamy look came over it.  He was crushing on her hard.  So cute.<br />
<br />
He walked over to her.  &quot;Hi!&quot;  He said cheerfully.  &quot;I&#39;m Luke.&quot;  He had a sort of mild cockiness that came from realizing that she was into him and trying to act masculine and tough for her, but he was clearly more innocence and light than anything.  It was adorable.  He tried to chat her up for a bit, got her name, and as she listened she found her eyes roaming up and down his frame.  He was lean, but in a strong way.  He had a good frame that would probably develop into that of a very powerful man once he was grown.  As her eyes drifted briefly to the rather large bulge in his pants she found herself hoping that she wasn&#39;t blushing.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, you from around here?  You look like a local, but I&#39;ve never seen you before?&quot;<br />
<br />
Uhg.  He probably hadn&#39;t seen her before because he didn&#39;t frequent the horrible part of town that she was from.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, I&#39;m from Allyville.&quot; she said, searching her new memories for the name of the next town over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah?  Well welcome to Broadberg!&quot; he said, beaming.   &quot;Can I show you around?&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly two exclamation marks appeared above his head, one pink and one red.  She focused first on the pink one.<br />
<br />
:::<br />
Quest Available!<br />
<br />
Relationship Quest: Loverboy Luke<br />
Information: Luke has a strong good alignment, and forming a romantic relationship with him will grant you good alignment points periodically.  Additionally, the higher your relationship points with him are the more often he will give you gifts. At 40 points he can be added to your party.  At 100 points you may marry him. Additionally, a maxed-out good alignment and a marriage to Luke will allow a race change from half-succubus to half-angel starting at level 10.<br />
<br />
:::<br />
<br />
Wow, really?  She didn&#39;t have to be a succubus forever?  Now that was the kind of miracle she needed!  but, she&#39;d have to *marry* Luke?  Suddenly the image of herself walking down the isle in a bridal gown came to mind.  Blushing she banished the thought.  Well, at bare minimum it wouldn&#39;t hurt to get to know him better...<br />
<br />
Then she looked at the red exclamation mark.<br />
<br />
:::<br />
Quest Available!<br />
<br />
Dark Quest: Corrupting the Innocent<br />
Information: Turn Luke&#39;s love to lust, corrupt him, and either devour his soul or turn him into your permanent sex thrall.<br />
Rewards: 1000 XP, 80 points evil alignment, possible gaining of a permanent thrall, Embracing of the Dark passive skill: By staining your soul with darkness you attune it to your succubus side.  You will no longer risk losing yourself to succubus transformations, but you will gain massive evil points and be forever banned from becoming a half-angel.  <br />
:::<br />
<br />
Good lord!  That was horrible!  The benefit of a permanent thrall and apparently unlimited use of her succubus transformation was immense, not to mention the whopping 1000 XP, but it wasn&#39;t worth it! Maybe if it was a regular video game she&#39;d entertain the thought of &quot;going darkside&quot;, but this world&#39;s people were real to her!  She could never do a thing like that.  Though as she pondered it, she was troubled to admit that maybe if she spent too much time transformed, she eventually COULD do it.  Transformed Lillian certainly had had less qualms about devouring the souls of those bandits than regular Lillian would.  The prospect of what kind of monster she could potentially become frightened her.<br />
<br />
Well, she didn&#39;t have a lot of spare resources, but she decided that this half-angel thing was worth giving Luke a little of her time.  Yeah, that was why.  The half-angel thing.  She definitely wasn&#39;t following him around for the better part of an hour because of his charming smile that showed off one cute little dimple in his cheek, for his adorably dorky sense of humor that had her giggling every minute, or for the way his ass fit into those trousers.  ...dammit.  Alright so maybe she had a crush.  A pretty big one at that.  God, she&#39;d become such a girly girl...but he just, made her feel so desirable, so pretty!  and she decided it was really really nice, feeling pretty, feeling girly, being soft and vulnerable and sweet.  She had to admit that this was who she was now, and in truth she really didn&#39;t mind.  There was so much less pressure without male ego.   She suddenly regretted having chosen a practical set of women&#39;s pants and shirt for adventuring, wishing that she had a pretty dress to show off for him.  Suddenly she was glad for all those charisma points, and her growing beauty.  She caught him stealing a glance and her chest once and she only pressed it out with pride.<br />
<br />
A second hour passed before she&#39;d even known it.  She hid most of her past, but she told him she wanted to be an adventurer and a sorceress, and that she was trying to get to level up before joining a party.  She learned that he was the son of the finest weaponsmith in town, and then an information window told her that he&#39;d give rare weapons if she gained enough relationship points with him.  She&#39;d already gained 9 points in 2 hours just by chatting with him.  As they prepared to part ways she promised to meet him in the town square again tomorrow, and she watched the tenth relationship point pop.  As it did, he blushed, and suddenly said &quot;wait here.&quot;  He ran off to a vendor and soon returned with a potion in hand.  &quot;For the lady adventurer, to start her journey with a good luck gift from a friend.&quot; he said as he handed it to her.  <br />
<br />
It was an XP potion! A strong one!  She&#39;d be not only level 3, but nearly level 4 with this!  Luke&#39;s money was well spent though, as it earned him a kiss on the cheek that turned his cheeks red.<br />
<br />
Lillian spent the rest of the day practically skipping through the streets, but not before going to the market and buying herself a pretty yellow dress.  It was foolish, probably, wasting her money that way, but then again the dress probably didn&#39;t cost as much as the potion Luke had given her, and when he saw her in it tomorrow it might gain her even more relationship points, so it could pay for itself.  And if it sent flutters through her heart to see Luke&#39;s eyes widen at the sight of her wearing it tomorrow, well, that was just a bonus.<br />
<br />
But she put it away in her inventory for now and leveled up with the potion(putting the points into Wisdom again.).  This time she smiled as she scored the charisma boost from Unworldly Beauty again, and giggled as she felt her tits grow.  A smile came to her face as she wondered if Luke would notice.<br />
<br />
She went to the forest and killed a few venom beetles and grimshrooms to get her fireball spell to level 3. She spent the rest of the day getting her Illusion spell to level 2 just to see if it could do anything useful. At level 2 she could basically create believable shadows at best, so not super useful, but she thought it might be useful at higher levels.<br />
<br />
After buying tonight&#39;s stay at the inn, she&#39;d be just about broke, but she could sell some monster loot like rab-bat pelts to get her through maybe another day.  She was ready though.  She&#39;d join a party first thing tomorrow.  Well, first  thing after meeting Luke, anyway...<br />
<br />
She returned to the inn and went to sleep.<br />
