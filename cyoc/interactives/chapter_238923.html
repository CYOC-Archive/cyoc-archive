<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the newly gay man continued sucking him off, Jake struggled, remembering all the countless disgusting, perverted things he had done during his time as a slob. The messes he had made, the lives he had ruined, his own and so many other men. He wrestled with the thoughts as hormones coursed through his body, edging closer to orgasm. How could he heal from what he had done? And the man said he wasn&#39;t even gay? He felt the Slobifier slip from his fingers, but he was too aroused to be concerned.<br />
<br />
Even when he was a slob, Jake remembered the times when he wasn&#39;t a slob. He thought he had become one naturally, even though recent events made it seem otherwise. Yet, he&#39;d always been gay. He couldn&#39;t really believe that his natural state wasn&#39;t gay. And now, in a desperate attempt to escape from his captor, he&#39;d ruined the life of another man. What if he had a wife he could barely stomach to be around, preferring the company of another man instead? Jake was in a whirlwind of emotion, and the man sucking dick like a seasoned expert despite only becoming gay minutes earlier did not help.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the door burst open. This must be Harry. Jake instinctually, from years as a slob, tried to point the Slobifier at him. Remembering in his lust-addled mind that it had fallen, he reached over slightly to pick it up off the floor. As Harry sprinted off the room, shouting expletives, asking &quot;what you monster had done to my friend&quot;, and other things he couldn&#39;t exactly comprehend, he fired the gun. He just wanted to turn him into another horny gay man who couldn&#39;t attack him, but what Jake saw instead horrified him.<br />
<br />
Harry began expanding. As, on years of instinct, Jake cupped his captor&#39;s head with one hand, fucking his face, while he glanced at the Slobifier in horror. Somehow, it had gotten flipped back to the full slob setting. It must&#39;ve been when he dropped it.<br />
<br />
Fat was rushing onto Harry&#39;s frame. His clothes quickly burst open, and the first thing besides his enormous belly to plop over was his new new moobs. His thighs, arms, and face all grew plump, before getting a coating of hair, and his hair appeared to get very greasy. Gradually, he could smell the unwashed, slobby stench of someone who had languished in their filth for years and years, except now it was from far away, yet getting closer. He could feel the void of arousal that he thought he should&#39;ve felt. It was pain, and tears began leaking from Jake, who was now being milked for his third load.<br />
<br />
Yet, as the man got closer, he saw that dumb, slobby grin, and realized what he was about to do. He watched as the newly 500 pound Harry bent down, began eating out his friend&#39;s ass, and after a few moments, turned around, heaved his belly onto the man&#39;s back, the shockwave echoing through Jake&#39;s body, and began fucking him. With each thrust, the man suckling on the fruit of his penis began growing, expanding outward from his ass. He and his captor were pushed away from Harry as the man&#39;s asscheeks expanded, as the growth continued on, giving him thighs wider than Jake&#39;s torso, to support his new enormously flabby belly.<br />
<br />
Jake resigned himself to his face. He watched as the slobbification wave reached his captor-turned-victim&#39;s head, wrapped around his head like a hood, turning the man into a twisted version of himself. He felt the disgusting, caked bristles of his unshaven beard against his crotch, and Jake waited for the transformation to begin. Two more people had fallen victim to him, and he wasn&#39;t even aroused by it anymore. It wasn&#39;t fair. Yet, after the third, fourth, and fifth loads, he finally realized that he wasn&#39;t transforming. Maybe it was because he wasn&#39;t taking a slob&#39;s cock, only receiving a blowjob, but as clarity returned, he grew even more nauseated as he viewed the memories with a clear mind.<br />
<br />
He stumbled away as the two slobs&#39; sex grew even more intense and passionate. He didn&#39;t know what to do, he didn&#39;t know how he could live with the consequences of his actions, deal with the fact that he ruined his closest friend&#39;s life so intensely that he gave the man the ability to slobbify people with his sheer arousal. And yet, if he became a slob again, it wouldn&#39;t be punishment. He&#39;d be right back to enjoying himself. Jake began tinkering with the settings of the Slobifier, watching the two slobs fuck like rabbits, and feeling the absence of emotion in his crotch. He raised the Slobifier to his temple, and fired.</p>
