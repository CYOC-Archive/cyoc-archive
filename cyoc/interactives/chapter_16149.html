<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I've got no choice. I can't handle this. This body is just gagging for it from you. I shall have to keep going back until I can get Enrique fucked. Perhaps someone could use a dildo and that would do.&quot; I shuddered at the prospect. It was all that was left though.<br />
<br />
Again, once Mark had made the preparations we hugged each other close, and I felt the same feelings as last time before things blacked out.<br />
<br />
When I came too, the body felt the same at last time. Relieved, I was quietly pleased that that part of the transformation had worked ok so far. As I tried to roll over I felt a tug on my right arm and leg. Then I groaned internally as my eyes cleared and I realised I was still tied to the damn kitchen table. Not long can have passed at all, but as I glanced out of the corners of my eyes I realised that Mrs Coleman's clothes had gone. Looking down over my body I could see and feel drying cum. She must have made me come and left me here. What a joke that would be. How on earth would I sort my body out being male again when I was tied up like this?<br />
<br />
Then I heard the back door close.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Mum.&quot; <br />
<br />
Shit. My heart dropped deeper than ever before. That sounded just like Jamie. What was he doing back? Enrique's heart started beating much faster. At least he knew well enough that this was serious trouble. I struggled futilely against the bonds but was seriously stuck. Worst of all I began to get hard again at the prospects of it all!<br />
<br />
&quot;Mum&quot;, 17 year old Jamie shouted again. Then I just heard a cry.<br />
<br />
There was silence for a minute as my erection bounced in the air.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck is this?&quot; he exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I, erm, am the pool boy. Your mum left me here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My God. The slag. She's always doing this. Why the affairs? Why the hell make it so disgusting. I mean, that's our dinner table! Geez. What is wrong with my folks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry, buddy,&quot; I tried to soothe him. &quot;This isn't pleasant for me either. Think of how embarrassing it is! Just let me off here and we can both get on and deal with this our own ways. I am so sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
He mumbled something and came over to my left hand and began to untie it. &quot;If that's so why are you sporting a hard-on then, Enrique? You're the fucking pool boy. You don't tell me what to do. Why are you so hard?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, Jamie. Make it easy. Please&quot; I was starting to get worried.<br />
<br />
&quot;No man. You must be excited if you're so rock hard. You must like being helpless. So why shouldn't I do what I like if you are, on my kitchen table?&quot;<br />
<br />
I was in it up to my neck. The tragedy was that my body did indeed love this, but my mind was in terrible turmoil. This was my nursery school buddy for god's sake.<br />
<br />
Then Jamie dropped the bombshell, and myriad opportunities appealing and terribly unappealing opened up to me.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't know I'm bisexual do you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Erm..no.&quot; I replied, genuinely shocked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, well I am, and I've always been jealous of this great body. I've seen you in the back yard around the pool, with those tiny shorts on, showing off your curvy legs and your pecs, and those gorgeous muscles in your back. I'm going to finally take advantage of you...since you like it so much.&quot;<br />
<br />
My, so I may get someone penetrating me, but I sure as hell knew this body didn't want it but loved the lack of control. What a mess was I in, as my cock raged harder and harder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look at that&quot; Jamie moaned as he lay on the table between my spread legs. Ever so slowly he reached down to grab my throbbing member. When he did close his youthful soft hands on it I thought I would come straight away. Then, as if in slow motion, he lowered his head down to it, slowly opened his mouth, licked his lips for my benefit, and lowered his boyish mouth over my cock. Man, did that feel sweet. I tried to raise my hips to meet it, despite knowing it was wrong - I'd never been gay - I just knew this was a feeling any man would adore. He went down over my full length until I felt the back of his wet throat. Then he pulled it all the way out, running his tongue down the front. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now, time for my fun, Enrique&quot; he said, as I made a mental note never to leave myself so helpless again.<br />
<br />
I seemed to like the idea that my body was touching another human. As Jamie positioned himself between my strong thighs I tried to relax as I knew what was coming next. He had stripped out of his school uniform, taken off his grey cotton boxers and revealed his six and a half inch cock. I thought I could take that. His body was well pumped for the short guy he was, and I could admire, man to man, the definition of his pecs and shoulders, and even felt slightly attracted to the glint of his blond hairs, spread over his body in the light. As he knelt forward, Jamie went to work on my nipples. I felt the boy's crotch rub against mine and clenched, before deciding to relaxe was best. Then, due to my spread, wide legs, he slowly and almost gently sank his rock hard cock into my arsehole to it's fullest extent. I felt all his wait on my own cock and pelvic bone then as he leaned on me, exciting me in many ways and pushed his girth further in. My ring burnt like it was on fire, but there wasn't the tearing sensation I'd half-expected. Maybe Enrique had done this before? I certainly felt my hips rising upwards to meet the thrust of Jamie's manhood, and somehow felt very satisfied at the whole plugged feeling I know had in my arse. Almost as if Jamie taking me as making me whole. Truth told, I liked the feel of that live hard cock up my hole. From what Jamie said, he was really enjoying himself too. He told me I was the first guy he had ever fucked, and mine was the first asshole either male or female that he had ever plowed. He liked the tight smooth fit. He liked the way my muscles clamped down on his cock. Of course I was a little embarrassed on my back, my legs spread open, being used like a woman. It sent me to new heights of excitement.<br />
<br />
I said I was being used like a woman, but I had to change my mind. I thought that if Enrique or even Mark had been fucking me I sure would have been used like a woman. He would have rammed up my hole, plowed in deep for a few quick hard thrusts, shot, and pulled out, leaving me with a lot more pain than pleasure. Jamie was completely different and seemed to be trying to give me pleasure. After a while I felt as if Jamie was going to wear out my hole, he changed tempo and rythmn, he changed direction and he went harder and softer. All the time though I could feel my bonds straining and relaxing as he humped me hard and filled me more and more and deeper and deeper as he got more excited. He must have fucked me for a good hour solid. I began to worry about whether he'd ever come and if I would ever get the chance to become a man again. I felt so physically good for doing something so different though. He was treating me to a real show, as he was kissing and rubbing my pecs and using his hands on them too, to bring my nipples to become erect. He sucked on them, and toyed on them with his tongue until I begged for more.<br />
<br />
Then he stopped. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you enjoying this Enrique?&quot; he asked, with is manhood buried to the hilt within me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just finish it, Jamie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, not until you ask me too. Go on, plead.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, man. Isn't this humiliating enough?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok.&quot; And he stopped. He said nothing more but stayed buried deep within me. My cock was raging. I was now terrified of running out of time.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK,OK, Jamie. Please, go on. Please carry on fucking me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you enjoying it?&quot; <br />
<br />
At that I lost control. Enrique's body just seemed to cross that point from pleasure to lust and need.<br />
<br />
&quot;YES. I love it. I can't help it. Please, just give it to me hard. Please.&quot;<br />
<br />
I began and the words seemed to keep coming. They gave Jamie new life. He just wasn't fucking me, he was making love to me, he was worshiping my body as he rammed hard into my hole, plugging it totally. What a mind trip! <br />
<br />
I reached up and licked at his own pecs, toying with his own raging hard nipples and tried to do what he had done to me. I got a very positive response in his eyes and perhaps more important, in his cock, he was motivated to push in higher, his cock felt like it got even harder, and he was smiling between his grunts. Jamie seemed to go for broke now.<br />
<br />
As he was fingering my pecs, squeezing my tits and as I could feel his own firm, defined pecs against my body sporadically, and his abs hard against my own erection getting their workout both in helping pump air into his gasping lungs and helping ram home his hard prod up my hole, well, he came down close to me with his mouth, put his mouth on my mouth and we kissed. We kissed long and hard, and I loved his deep eyes as our tongues entwined in a passionate snog. He went on for a long time and I was really enjoying it. He started kissing me again and I was kissing back. We both put tongue and lips to work on the other guy's chest and mid section and arms and shoulders and neck. After stroking my moaning Adam's apple he clamped his lips on mouth and plunged in with his tongue. Here he was pushing into both my holes at the same time.<br />
<br />
<br />
That mouth to mouth connection seemed to provide a spark of electricity for his final plunge and my final anal ring contraction and I could feel his load blast inside my body. Wow! Now I knew what those babes felt when I was shooting into them. Again and again he pumped his spunk deep within me, the warmth making me excited, as my own anal ring contracted with complete pleasure with my prostrate having been so expertly massaged. Jamie slumped forward onto me, still roaming his hands all over my body.<br />
<br />
I thought that was it, that I could now get untied and cleaned up as<br />
he pulled out of my ass hole but without asking Jamie then just pushed his cock into my mouth, straddling my chest, and tickling my nipples with the light hairs on his thighs. The sight of him above me, and the feeling on my chest made me spurt my own load prematurely all over my stomach, and from the look on his face up his back. As he shoved it deep into my mouth it didn't feel good at first. After I got over the negative feelings of being turned into a cocksucker, well, it was OK. I didn't get the same good direct pleasure I had with him up my hole, but especially when I felt that velvet tip moving around on the roof of my mouth and then plunging down my throat, well, it was a nice feeling too. As I ran my tongue over his glans, I could feel Jamie engorge and just as yet more sperm, to add to that leaking from my arsehole, came firing out, I was saved the dilemma of coping with swallowing it as I slowly faded from consciousness.</p>
