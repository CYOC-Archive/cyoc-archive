<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Colin eyed his brother Michael nervously. Beads of sweat were forming on his forehead, and his face looked a little pale. The silence in the bathroom was broken by what sounded like a Speedo Man orgy throughout the apartment beyond the locked door. The excitement of the moaning began to grow, but the remaining men tried to ignore the sounds and attempted to talk over it. One person seemed to be unable to block it out though: Michael.<br />
<br />
Colin watched in shock as his brother absent mindedly began to rub his growing hard on through his jeans. His biceps were bulging against his shirt. It was painfully obvious that Michael's transformation was getting the better of him.<br />
&quot;Michael, I am so sorry about this,&quot; Colin whispered.<br />
Michael's face screwed up, clearly trying to fight his growing interest and need to join the throbbing feast of sex just through the door.<br />
&quot;N---n--n-n-no,&quot; he stammered, &quot;You can't-t-t-t-t do this t-t-t-t-o m-m----me!&quot;<br />
Colin turned to the other guys and cleared his throat.<br />
&quot;Guys, Michael has been bit. Michael,you've got to go. Look, I don't want to do this, but we don't have a choice.&quot;<br />
Michael began to panic. He started begging the other guys to let him stay. The other guys looked scared though.<br />
&quot;Michael, you have got to get the hell away from us!&quot; one piped up.<br />
&quot;C'mon man, the same would go for anyone else,&quot; another spoke up.<br />
&quot;Look man, you can probably go for help or something!&quot; another said, a little unconvincingly. The others began to assure Michael he'd be fine. Perhaps if the Speedo Men were far too engrossed in the orgy. ...And presuming Michael wouldn't join in.<br />
<br />
Michael's ass began to round out into a perfect bubble butt in his jeans. His shirt was bulging out, threatening to tear. It was time. It was obvious Michael was rapidly losing control as his bite was taking effect. He was still in the corner opposite the door. The remaining guys and Colin surrounded Michael.<br />
&quot;Time to go,&quot; they said, approaching cautiously. Suddenly, they pounced onto Michael. There was a great amount of thrashing. Michael's jeans burst open at the rear, his red Speedo and bubble butt forcing their way through. Michael moaned in pleasure. He fought back, but there were too many even with his growing strength. Quickly, the guys dragged Michael to the door.<br />
&quot;Alright, 3...2....1!&quot; Colin shouted. He opened the door, and Michael was shoved out into the hall. They went to close the door, but Michael rammed it with his muscular shoulder, forcing it back open. His shirt was torn wide open now, his muscular chest bulging out. The guys and Colin quickly threw their weight against the door. Everything wasn't going according to plan.<br />
<br />
Colin's friend Max was closest to the door opening, struggling with the door. It was almost closed. Max's palms were outstretched against the door handle, trying to push it closed. Colin saw Michael through the door for one second, felt him bide his strength for one second, and then forcibly tear through. His jeans were in tatters, red Speedo bursting through at all angles. He was nearly totally transformed. Michael licked his lips, looking at Max and grabbed him. Michael grabbed Max into his arms and began to kiss him deeply. Max struggled desperately, but Michael's grip was far too strong. The other guys made a snap decision, forcing the pair out of the room. After all, Max had been kissed; he was as good as gone anyway. Once Michael bit him, as he was bound to do at any second, he was as good as gone.<br />
<br />
The door slammed behind Max. Max fumbled with the handle, but it was plain that the guys had locked him out.<br />
&quot;FUCK!&quot; he shouted, &quot;FUCK YOU ALL. YOU FUCKING ASSHOLES!&quot;<br />
There was no response in the bathroom. <br />
The air reeked of sweat and cum and sex. The Speedo orgy must be in the main room down the hall. Michael jumped on Max again, tearing open his shirt and licking Max's nipples.<br />
&quot;Oh man,&quot; Max moaned against his will. <br />
Michael began to kiss him again, his tongue darting into Max's mouth and forcibly wrestling with Max's tongue, but Max kept trying to shove the muscular Michael off of him. With a big shove, Michael stumbled back. He stared at Max angrily, then grunting, tore off the tatters of his clothes and lunged onto Max. Max moaned in terror as Michael began to kiss him again. Michael's hands forced Max's head into position, gripping his hair tightly. The kissing was getting aggressive. Max looked to the hall and decided he'd have to sprint. And as he gave one big push, he gave a small yelp in pain. Michael had bit his lip amidst the kissing.<br />
<br />
Michael let go in surprise and shock. He was bit. He was a goner. No, no, he had to fight it off. Max groggily ran down the hallway. The smell was getting intoxicating; was he running to the front door to escape, or was something pulling him in? He could almost taste the cum... He burst into the living room. There were like half a dozen guys in Speedos in the process of fucking or being fucked. Speedos were shucked down thighs. One or two of the guys were having their cocks sucked through their Speedos. They were all moaning in excitement. Max's cock gave an almighty leap against his will. Michael came barreling from behind and shoved Max to the floor, rolling around as Max fought to regain control. This got the other Speedo Men's attention. Another man; they could smell his pent up sexual frustration. The pack could only think about helping Max with this.<br />
<br />
They jumped onto Max. Two held down his arms. Another had his arms wrapped around Max's chest, his throbbing cock drooling with precum down Max's back. Two of them grabbed Max's jeans and pulled until they split right off. Max looked down, seeing his blue boxer briefs were getting tighter, redder and smoother. There was a drawstring hanging out the front. Max's cock was throbbing against the Speedo-ish material, stretching it out. He was turning into one of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;NO! NO! NOOOOO!&quot; Max moaned as Michael began to kiss him deeply. He felt a hand wedge into his tight underwear, probing his asshole. Max's eyes widened in shock. One of the other Speedo Men came onto Max's chest. The smell was rich...he needed to taste it. The one who came seemed to sense this, licked the cum from his chest and began to fight Michael to kiss Max. Max felt the cum slide down his throat. It tasted...amazing. He felt power coursing through his arms as his biceps and pecs began to bulge out. Muscles pushed out of his legs as the legs on his boxer briefs tightened into the same skimpy Speedo shape the other guys were outfitted in. He was powerful now. But he could barely make enough sense to even think about throwing these guys off of him. He was outfitted in a perfect red Speedo now. <br />
<br />
Someone in the chaos removed his shoes and socks. His Speedos were pulled down to his upper thighs, revealing his cock. It was throbbing, cum oozing from the tip. His body was drenched in sweat, loving every second.<br />
&quot;Oh fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck,&quot; Max moaned. Michael swallowed his huge cock down to the root, maintaining eye contact with Max the whole time. From behind, Max felt the finger leave his asshole, and in its place, a tongue enter and begin to rim him. Max grunted with pleasure. He couldn't even think of why the fuck he hadn't let this happen in the first place. He'd never felt this amazing before. The tongue continued to slide in and out of his ass. His thoughts grew even more clouded, more animal. He came with an almighty explosion, cum shooting into Michael's mouth. Max was panting, his brain getting even fuzzier. He was already feeling horny again. He was just wanted to fuck more guys...and to bite the rest of 'em.</p>
