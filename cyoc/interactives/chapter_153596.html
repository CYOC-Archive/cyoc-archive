<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ken grunted as he came inside Jack&#39;s tight hole for the fifth time in as many hours. Jack relaxed against the bedspread, smiling, but rubbing his sore ass a little. <br />
<br />
&quot;Daddy, this is great, but do you think we could take a longer break so I can recover a little?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ken smiled and laughed. &quot;Jackie boy, you know I don&#39;t mind spreading the love, but I&#39;m only going to sleep with my frat brothers. Nobody else would be respectable enough for this dick. And seeing as you&#39;re the only bottom in the frat, the honor goes to you. Consider yourself lucky not to have to share me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jack grimaced a little. &quot;All the same, I wish you could recruit some more bottom bros.&quot;<br />
<br />
Finally! Another wish! It had been hours, I was beginning to wonder if I&#39;d make Jack too stupid to want to change anything about his life. Here we go... Since it had been so long, I decided to make a bold move.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish you could recruit some more bottom bros WITH YOUR TONGUE.&quot;<br />
<br />
I snapped my fingers and a glint appeared in Ken&#39;s eyes. I knew from experience that his tongue must have been tingling like it was stuck in a light socket. He grinned wolfishly and patted Jack on the ass. &quot;You know what, that&#39;s a good idea, kid. Who knew you had it in you? Stay here and keep that body looking good for daddy.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, he left the dorm room in a flash, leaving Jack alone. &quot;Thank you, daddy!&quot; called Jack (Way too late for Ken to hear. Dumbass.) and began one of his favorite routines with the dumbbells that were scattered among the old pizza boxes and empty beer bottles on the floor. I was stuck in the room watching my master burp and flex in the mirror, but I couldn&#39;t help wondering what mischief Ken was about to get up to.<br />
------<br />
Ken wandered the campus looking for fresh meat to claim as his own. The sun was setting and the quad was bathed in a golden light that made every man and woman look almost heavenly, but one in particular caught his eye. Chester Griswold III was walking into the library, eyes glued to his phone. He nearly walked into a couple holding hands and sneered at them with disdain as if he wasn&#39;t the one who caused the problem in the first place. <br />
<br />
Chester was an entitled dick who deserved to be knocked down a few pegs. He strutted around like he was the king of campus just because his dad had gifted the university a shiny new Griswold Student Commons. He was a business major because what else would he be? But while he had a string of swanky internships to make him feel like a real businessman, Ken had graded his papers in the Econ class he T.A.&#39;d. The dude was going nowhere fast, unless it was on his daddy&#39;s coattails.<br />
<br />
Ken smiled. Chester was perfect. He already had an allegiance to one daddy, why not two? And while he might have been lazy with his homework, he was certainly attentive to maintaining his appearance. He was a thin boy, only slightly toned, but his cheekbones could cut glass and his platinum blonde hair was always immaculately cropped, a perfect fit for the impeccable pressed suits he wore to school every day to flaunt his wealth and status. <br />
<br />
And perfect, would you look at that? With a furtive glance around him, Chester slipped into one of the private study rooms on the ground floor. Ken slipped in behind him as he finished adjusting his red tie in the mirror and took a sip from his black Starbucks coffee.<br />
<br />
Chester heard the door close and without turning around said, &quot;Vanessa, you&#39;re early. If we&#39;re going to do this you&#39;re going to need to be a little more subtle.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ken grinned. &quot;I&#39;m not Vanessa.&quot; Chester turned around with a start. &quot;Oh! Ken? What are you doing here? Am I late on an assignment or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no, nothing like that,&quot; growled Ken, &quot;but you do have a new assignment I&#39;m here to tell you about.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chester gave Ken a petulant look. &quot;Can&#39;t you just email me? I&#39;m... expecting someone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no, Chester. This can&#39;t wait. And I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll want it over with as soon as possible.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, man. This isn&#39;t class time. You have no authority over- what are you doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ken had picked up the Starbucks cup and was staring at it with interest. <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s mine, Ken. Give it back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ken grinned devilishly. &quot;I know it&#39;s yours. Otherwise I wouldn&#39;t be able to do this.&quot; He licked the top of the cup and its surface started to bubble and elongate, stretching into a tall cylinder as the entire cup turned clear, hardening into glass. The coffee inside faded from brown to amber, then the color became muted as the glass turned green and a label affixed itself to the bottle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ken, give my Heineken back, I&#39;m serious.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;As you wish.&quot; Ken held out the bottle, but as Chester reached for it Ken locked his wrist in a vice grip, giving it a short, sharp lick.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bro, what the fuck was that for?&quot; Chester&#39;s face wrinkled in confusion at his sudden vulgarity. He was used to conducting himself with the utmost respectability, at least when he was dealing with the public. But he was distracted by a dull, throbbing pain in the spot where Ken had licked. He watched in horror as a black blob formed on his creamy white skin, slowly forming into a tattoo of the Greek letters &quot;Delta Theta Pi.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Duuuuude, what the shit is happening? I don&#39;t want to be in your frat, fuck off!&quot; <br />
<br />
Ken smiled again. &quot;Oh, but you already are. This tattoo means we&#39;re brothers for life. You don&#39;t quite look the part yet, but I can take care of that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ken licked one arm of Chester&#39;s suit jacket, and then the other. The fabric immediately split open and withered away into nothing, leaving him sleeveless as his pale arms slowly inflated with muscle. What were once toothpicks were now rock-hard and bulging. Chester flexed a quick bicep pose and couldn&#39;t resist a smile. &quot;OK, that&#39;s pretty cool, but I think it&#39;s time I head out-&quot;<br />
<br />
As he was speaking, Ken unbuckled his trousers and pulled them down, licking up one of Chester&#39;s legs and down the other. His quads quadrupled in size, becoming thick hams as his calves bulged out obscenely. Chester couldn&#39;t help but let out a giggle. &quot;Dude, that tickles.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ken loosened the red tie and unbuttoned the top three buttons of Chester&#39;s crisp white shirt, revealing a thick carpet of coarse blonde chest hair. He smiled. Well, that&#39;s ONE thing he wouldn&#39;t have to change. He pulled back the fabric slightly, licking one nipple and then the other, groping his chest as it heaved forward into two juicy pecs and Chester&#39;s slight tummy receded into a cobblestone ab pathway beneath them.<br />
<br />
The remaining tatters of Chester&#39;s suit softened into cheap cotton, becoming a tank top with a plunging neckline and just the barest strip of fabric connecting the front and back, revealing the sides of his muscular torso. <br />
<br />
Chester stared goggle-eyed at his own reflection. &quot;Honestly dude, I can&#39;t thank you enough for this body, but I think we&#39;re quite done here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no we&#39;re not.&quot; Ken lifted Chester&#39;s arm, revealing a smooth, hairless pit. &quot;You shave?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, of course. I don&#39;t want to smell, bro.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ken rolled his eyes. &quot;Where we&#39;re going, you&#39;re not going to be taken seriously unless you smell at least a little.&quot; He licked a circle around his left pit and then the right, watching as the first blonde hairs wriggled out of their follicles, almost invisible at first, but then rapidly multiplying into a scraggly blonde bush that stuck out in all directions, visible even when Chester clamped his arm to his side. A slight musk started to fill the room, an unavoidable consequence of his out-of-control pit hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK dude, I really need to go, you&#39;re starting to freak me out and-&quot;<br />
<br />
The rest of Chester&#39;s sentence was muffled by Ken shooting his tongue down his throat. He stepped back and watch with pride as his Adam&#39;s apple plumped up and bulged from his neck, which thickened in the process. <br />
<br />
&quot;Duuuuude...&quot; Chester let out a low baritone chuckle. &quot;What are you doing to me, bro?&quot; His voiced now boomed in the small cubicle. <br />
<br />
Ken felt his tongue tingle with more fury than ever before, and knew the time to strike was now. He gave Chester one long lick from the chin to the forehead and stepped back to watch. Dots of blonde stubble began to appear on his clean-shaven chin, extending into a scraggly flesh-colored beard. His nose widened, no longer elfin and delicate. He blinked and his clear blue eyes were no more, now a muddy brown. His close-cropped hair began to slide in greasy strands down his face before it swooped into the air, becoming a golden coif. A small patch of golden tan skin appeared in the center of his forehead, the color cascading down his face, around the back of his neck, and down his body on both sides.<br />
<br />
The wave of golden tan color overtook his furry chest, making the blonde pelt and treasure trail stand out even further. It moved down past his crotch, which plumped up in his boxers, which now seemed ratty and stained, and all the way down his legs and feet. <br />
<br />
&quot;Daddy, what&#39;s happening to me? Wait - Ken. No, daddy. Daddy. Daddy.&quot; As he repeated the word, the light slowly dimmed from his eyes. He wasn&#39;t the brightest bulb to begin with, but even those small scraps of intelligence that he used to fake his way through college were fading fast. He let out a dull giggle and rubbed his ample chest. &quot;Dude, this is fuckin&#39; SWEET!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ken grinned. &quot;Turn around for daddy, boy.&quot; Chet, for that was now the only name he was ever known by, gladly complied. He turned around and leaned over on the study table. Ken watched, drooling as his ass plumped up until it looked like two bowling balls smuggled in his boxers. He couldn&#39;t wait any longer. He spit in his hand, whipped out his dick and slathered it up, then ripped Chet&#39;s boxers in two, plunging into him with an animalistic need.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, daddy! Right there, daddy! Fuck yeah, bro! Delta Theta Pi for life!&quot;<br />
<br />
The frat bros were too lost in heat to notice the door open behind them, as a pretty brunette stepped in saying &quot;Chester, I&#39;m here- oh my, I seem to have the wrong room.&quot; She shut the door as quick as humanly possible and left the men to fill the room with grunts, squeals, and fratty, beer-soaked musk.</p>
