<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle found someone he decided would be a pretty appealing option to affect with the watch - a teenager boy arguing with his parents. He can&#39;t hear exactly what they&#39;re saying but at the end the parents left the boy alone and he began to sunbathe face down on a blanket. Holding up the watch and taking the guy&#39;s age, Kyle saw the guy was about fifteen, and was probably a mean rich kid who&#39;s never happy with anything. Kyle didn&#39;t like that kind of teens, so he decided to do something about that.<br />
<br />
He started to activate the watch, targeting the guy, intending to decide if it was better to turn him into a man or a baby. Fiddling with the watch, Kyle finally decided to progress the young lad into a grown man, wondering if he could mature a little with that. When Kyle looked at himself, he was yet again astonished by how he went from being a scrawny kid to a muscular, masculine man in his thirties. The more Kyle thought about it, the more he hoped to really get to make use of his new body with one of the hotties out here on the beach. He now was a man after all, and this boy is going to be one too very soon.<br />
<br />
Martin Green was the teenager&#39;s name, and he was now fast asleep, dreaming of the day when he will finally be free from his parents and their rules - he dreamed of himself as a muscular, powerfully built stud, with a handsome face, a thick manly beard, a hairy chest, and his skin was perfectly tanned. But now? Now he could just sleep and dream of it. Or so he thought.<br />
<br />
Kyle gasped as he watched several years of life starting to accumulate in him, the watch&#39;s first effects being the quick spreading of tan on his skin. It seemed that the effects of the watch felt pretty good, because before long the young man was stirring in his slumber. He seemed to stretch several inches as his height reached its peak. Kyle was wondering how much more he should push this but he kept going.<br />
<br />
The thirty two year old watched as the muscles on the slowly progressing boy&#39;s body started to fill in as the young weakness he had slowly faded. Shoulders suddenly broadening, face strengthening and jawline showing stronger and more capable. Hair seemed to be growing coarser in his limbs.<br />
<br />
Kyle realized his target seemed to be waking sooner and sooner, but he didn&#39;t know how long it&#39;d be until this got done. He looked down at the watch then over at the guy he was changing. Kyle wanted to teach him a lesson, but he needed to finish before the guy wakes up.<br />
<br />
Martin&#39;s arms tightened and strengthened as it went on, gripping and releasing in his sleep, and Kyle watched the soft skin along the arms start to get rough and the muscles beginning to be considerably noticeable.<br />
<br />
As Martin kept progressing, Kyle grew more and more astonished at how hunky the young man was getting. The young man&#39;s arms now have a wonderfully buff condition. Shoulders broadened until they almost went off the towel. His pecs were inflating with muscle and might have been bigger than Kyle&#39;s pecs. The last of  babyfat melted off of Martin&#39;s body, revealing a shredded six-pack that made Kyle jealous. Maybe he should get younger again to reclaim his lost abs; at the very least, he should stop slacking at the gym. He missed having abs.<br />
<br />
Even Martin&#39;s legs grew until they threatened to rip the swimshorts he was wearing. However, the thing that surprised Kyle the most was the huge pair of feet he had gotten, probably size 15 with long toes a long arch and wide soles. Who knew that this boy Kyle choose randomly would become into a hot gym rat and beach bum? Not to mention he was still younger than Kyle was now. Who knows how much more muscular and attractive he would get as he gets older? In fact, Kyle felt his shorts getting tighter as he watched the guy slowly growing manlier and hotter. He wondered how this guy will react when he wakes up.<br />
<br />
Speaking of which, when Martin reached late twenties was when he finally awoke to the changes that were happening to him. Once that happened, Kyle quickly stopped the stopwatch, which had stopped at age 30, to then watched the now man&#39;s reaction.<br />
<br />
Martin woke up from the feeling that something was off with his body. He had been tossing and turning in his sleep, trying to get comfortable. However, whenever Martin found a comfortable position the next minute, it suddenly wasn&#39;t. When the formally teenager opened his eyes, he was shocked to find two giant pecs blocking his view. Seeing this caused the man to sit up with a jolt and proceed to examine his body.<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t recognize his body but it seemed quite familiar even so. His arms were so strong like he had worked so hard at the gym to build up. His pecs were as big as his head and so juicy that he could squeeze them. His abs were so defined that they still seemed unreal to him. His legs were now as thick as tree trunks and he had to spread them necessarily now. Martin had to touch his face to confirm his suspicions, and feeling a thick but trimmed beard proved it. He was the man of his dreams!<br />
<br />
&quot;Am I still dreaming?&quot; Martin asked himself while flexed his muscles. He watched in awe as they bulged to new peaks. &quot;Well, if this is a dream. I might as well enjoy this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle grimaced as he watched his target become so happy at becoming a grown up. Though, he did notice that Martin&#39;s swimshorts didn&#39;t change along with the rest of his body and now awkwardly fitted Martin&#39;s new shape. It was unlike Kyle&#39;s clothes which morphed to fit his new age and form better. The thirty-two-year-old was beginning to understand how the stopwatch works a bit better. The button with the globe must have changed reality if pressed. That&#39;ll be useful to keep in mind but for now he won&#39;t use it. Martin&#39;s parents were coming back and they&#39;re expecting to find their teenage son not a burly man. Kyle smiled, this is going to be fun!</p>
