<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Suddenly, you saw a massage on your phone from your close friend Amanda, inviting you over. Wanting to see how she was in the new reality, you agreed and asked your new mom to drive you over to your friend’s home, which she agreed to do. “Just please don’t stay until too late”<br />
On the short trip to Amanda’s home, you thought about how strange it was to be too young to drive by yourself, relying on others for that, but you decided that it wasn’t too bad.<br />
<br />
Reaching your friends home and saying goodbye to your mother, you knocked on the door in Amanda’s house, to be greeted by her, and she appeared a lot younger than she was originally.<br />
Judging by her looks, she appeared to be at their late teens, presumably at the same grade as you.<br />
Her older age and developed body suddenly made you feel underdeveloped.<br />
<br />
Even as an adult, you were small bodied with little curves on it, and that was after puberty had a bit of mercy on yourself at age 15.<br />
At your current state, you must have been well bellow 5 feet tall (if your memory served you right, 4’9“) with zero curves to speak off.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, your friend was a different story.<br />
Amanda was also extremely short, but she had an extreme hourglass figure, with exceptionally large breasts. At 17, she only stood as tall as you and wasn’t as curvy as she used to be as an adult, but she still had a lot to brag about on the front.<br />
<br />
“Hello? Are you here?“ Your train of thought was interrupted by by Amanda. “Are you going in or are you just going to stand here doing nothing?”<br />
Trying to not appear too strange, you went inside.<br />
<br />
As you two went on casually talking about school and friends, Amanda mentioned how she got new bras due to her old ones not fitting. She was always a bit teasing about her body to her friend, and it looked like that was unchanged.<br />
Hearing that, your jealousy of for your friend’s bust started to take some hold (a lot more than the playful Amanda, who didn’t intend to actually insult, meant), and then you got the idea to use the phone to change it.<br />
You were still extremely close friends with Amanda, and you didn’t want to change her for the worse because of that, but that didn’t mean anything about improving yourself.<br />
<br />
You asked her if you could try on the bras, only for your friend to ask why.<br />
Trying to find an excuse, you said it was to see how they would look on you do get the deal of how big they actually were.<br />
Your friend was still a bit confused, but she agreed.<br />
<br />
You both went into your friend’s room, and she opened her closet to reveal a large bra.<br />
“An F cup” Amanda said with some pride on her face. After putting the bra on her bed, she removed her shirt to reveal a similar one that she was wearing. “That’s how they look in action”.<br />
“Can I have a bit of privacy while I change?” You asked. Your friend agreed, but she was still confused about your behavior.<br />
<br />
With Amanda leaving the room, you removed your shirt to see a training bra, and after removing them, an underdeveloped chest as flat as a board.<br />
You then went to put on the bra your friend left in the bed. It was clearly too big for you, though the band size seemed to be fine.<br />
Then, you opened the app, and after a few scans and resets, you got a sentence that fit your plan:<br />
“A 14 year old girl trying on her older friend’s bra, but due to the size difference of their breasts, the F cup bra is empty for her”<br />
<br />
That was a long and extremely precise sentence, but the specifics are exactly what you needed. The mentioning of “14” and “older” assured that neither her nor her friend’s age would change, the mentioning of the bra size assured her friend’s breasts won’t shrink in the process.<br />
You opened the app, and changed a word.<br />
<br />
“A 14 year old girl trying on her older friend’s bra, but due to the size difference of their breasts, the F cup bra is undersized for her”<br />
<br />
Suddenly, you felt a jolt of pain the empty bra suddenly became too tight on your chest and you got off balance as your center of gravity changed. After recovering your balance, you were greeted by the sight of a huge pair of breasts, with flesh sticking out of the struggling bra.<br />
<br />
Ignoring the pain, you went to the door, slightly struggling too keep balance, and after opening it, you were greeted by your gasping at the sight.<br />
“I know you grew recently, but I didn’t think you became that big!” Amanda yelled. “Please get the bra off so it won’t get ruined”.<br />
With pride on your face, you said “Agreed”, closed back the door and removed the bra, feeling relief as the two mounds of flesh hung out. Looking down, you saw how big they were. They were gigantic on your tiny body. Grabbing one of them up, they certainly felt heavy.<br />
Suddenly, you felt your back hurt.<br />
Opening the app again, the following sentence appeared:<br />
“A young teen whose G cup breasts cause notable back pain”.<br />
‘G cups! That’s one cup bigger than Amanda!’ You thought to yourself with extreme joy, but then the realization that the back pain would probably continue hit you, so you changed the sentence.<br />
“A young teen whose G cup breasts cause no back pain”.<br />
The pain on your back suddenly disappeared, putting a smile on your face.<br />
<br />
Looking at your friend’s bed, the training bra you left there has changed into a very large, real bra. Putting it on was a bit of a challenge, but you made it through.<br />
<br />
After putting it on, you went back out of the room to meet your friend.<br />
“Well, looks like I can’t tease you anymore about your chest, girl” your friend joked. “I should have expected it when you became an E cup.”<br />
“It was only a matter of time, flatty” you said back, making you both laugh.<br />
<br />
After that, you both continued chatting and joking, until it became late and your mom called you.<br />
“Looks like I got to go...” You said. “Bye!”<br />
<br />
After returning back home, the rest of your day became underwhelming, with the exceptions of getting used to your new center of gravity (the constant jiggling made it hard), seeing yourself in the mirror (spoiler alert, big boobs), and feeling the water going down your body in the shower.<br />
At the end, you got to your bed to sleep and found yourself incapable of sleeping on your stomach. Changing position and saying “Worth it” to yourself, you went to sleep.</p>
