<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Bruno drove Chad home, Chad slumped in the passenger seat, and stared out the window.  After his week in hell, he was all cried out and ached all over.  At least it was over, wasn&#39;t it?   Chad sat up as they neared his house.  He wasn&#39;t alarmed when Bruno drove slowly passed Chad&#39;s house because Bruno lived next door.  He figured Bruno would park at home, and they would walk back to his house.  But Bruno drove passed his own house.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, Bruno, if you have to go somewhere, you can drop me here, I&#39;m really tired,&quot; Chad offered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chad, you don&#39;t want to be Rico and Snake&#39;s pet mattress boy forever do you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, of course not!&quot; Chad protested way too much in Bruno&#39;s opinion.  Mattress Boy did like being every guy&#39;s fuck toy, at least on some level.  Bruno smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, sit back and enjoy the ride.  I&#39;m going to make sure that doesn&#39;t happen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Where are we going?&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll see.&quot;<br />
<br />
He pulled into a driveway two blocks up the street.  They were nice middle class homes in Chad&#39;s neighborhood, but the next tract up was ritzier.  Suddenly, Bruno turned.  Chad panicked as he recognized the gate posts as Bruno drove up the private road.<br />
<br />
Chad&#39;s elementary school bully lived here.  The guy was 2 years older than Chad, but had been held back 2 years.  He was expelled for beating Chad into a bloody pulp.  Chad had only seen him a few times since then, even though they lived a couple blocks apart, they lived in totally different worlds.  The last time he saw the brute was on the football field.  The Brute had tackled Chad and whispered as he crushed the smaller quarterback with his mass, &quot;You just love having a man on top of you.&quot;  Chad had never been happier than when he led his team to victory over Ainsley-Jarvis Preparatory Academy that day and put the Brute in his place.<br />
<br />
Wait Ainsley Jarvis&#39; team had been patrons of Rico and Snake&#39;s Happy Ending Mattress business.  Chad was so out of it after the first hundred guys, he really hadn&#39;t paid attention until Bruno rescued him.  But one of the guys had said, &quot;I was right you do love having a real man on top of you, mattress boy,&quot; then he grabbed Chad&#39;s boner, and twisted it until it shrank back into the mattress formerly known as Chad.<br />
<br />
Bruno lowered the window.  The Brute stuck his head in Bruno&#39;s driver side Window.<br />
<br />
The Brute snorted, &quot;So Mattress Boy is human again?  For the moment at least.&quot; He snickered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get it, Bruce,&quot; Bruno said, &quot;Please.  You owe Chad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I owe Chad all right.&quot;  He opened the car door behind Bruno and climbed in.  He set his back pack on the seat behind Chad. Then he leaned forward and pressed his stubble covered cheek against Chad&#39;s smooth cheek.  Yikes Chad realized that Snake and Rico had used depilatory cream on their happy ending mattress to make cleaning easier.  How long before his facial hair and pubes grow back, Chad wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I owe you, Mattress Boy,&quot; Bruce whispered malevolently.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bruce, you owe me, too.  Remember?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, Mattress Boy is lucky he&#39;s got a friend in you, Bruno,&quot; Bruce said leaning back, as Bruno drove the car back down the private drive.  He turned the car back the way they had come.<br />
<br />
Chad was nervous, and silent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chad, I really do owe you.  Being expelled gave me the opportunity to go to Ainsley-Jarvis Prep, and that was the best thing that could have happened to me. And damn, you&#39;re about the best damn Happy Ending Mattress I&#39;ve ever fucked.  Bruno texted me how you molded back into a human while he was fucking you.  Damn, that was hot.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad swallowed, and scrunched down further in his seat.  He was an eight year old kid again with Bruce the Brute looming over his shoulder. He remained silent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, Chad did make a hell of a Happy Ending Mattress, but we don&#39;t want him to end up a permanent fixture in the back of Rico&#39;s and Snake&#39;s van, do we?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you don&#39;t. As for me, I could care less what happens to Mattress Boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s Chad, not Mattress Boy,&quot; Bruno griped, &quot;Call him Chad, Bruce.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad shrank a bit more.  Bruno called him &quot;It&quot; not &quot;He.&quot;   What was he now?  He felt like a little kid being bullied by Brute and rescued by Bruno.  He tried to remind himself that he was the MVP, the football hero, the BMOC.  But the other acronyms that Rico, Snake and others had called Mattress Boy haunted him with each thought.  MVP: Most Valuable Pussy.  Football Hero: Footballer&#39;s Hole. BMOC: Big Mouth On Cock. He felt ruined.  He didn&#39;t know why Bruno thought Bruce could help or what Bruno had in mind, aw he pulled into his driveway.<br />
<br />
Bruce leaned forward, and again placed his head cheek to cheek with Chad&#39;s.  He said softly, &quot;Now, m-Chad, I do owe Bruno.  So I&#39;m going to help.  You may not perceive it as help now, but believe me this is the lesser of two evils.&quot; Chad felt a needle jab his thigh, and the hot liquid from the syringe spreading through his body.  He let out a yelp, and began breathing hard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, Bruno, let&#39;s get your boyfriend Chad up to your bedroom, and naked before he mattresses out.  Carrying a mattress up winding stairs is a real bitch.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad glared aghast at Bruno, as Bruce got out and went around to open Chad&#39;s door.<br />
<br />
Bruno leaned in, &quot;Hey, Bruce is right, Chad, this is the only way to keep you from being owned by Rico and Snake. amd spending the rest of your life as a happy ending mattress.  I just wanted to explain it all to you before injecting you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hurry up, Bruno, it&#39;s starting to change already.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, I&#39;ll explain after we get you upstairs.&quot;<br />
<br />
With Bruno under one arm, and Brute under the other Chad was carried limply into Bruno&#39;s house.  He hadn&#39;t realized how brutalized he had been as happy ending mattress.  He wondered what Bruno had over Brute that would make the guy help Chad.  How was changing Chad into a mattress helping him anyway.  Oh, he was Bruno&#39;s mattress, and Bruno wasn&#39;t going to rent him out?  But he was still a mattress. So this was better?  Maybe?<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, damn, he&#39;s widening. Let&#39;s get his clothes off now,&quot; Bruno said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Way ahead of you, Brun.&quot;  Bruce pulled off Chad&#39;s jeans and jockstrap with one hand, as they climbed Bruno and Chad climbed the winding staircase. <br />
<br />
Bruce had stepped on Chad&#39;s heels, removing his shoes as they walked through Bruno&#39;s kitchen. Then had pulled Chad&#39;s shirt and jacket off over Chad&#39;s head.  Bare chested Chad with Bruno under one arm had begun to climb the narrow staircase.  His jeans were painfully tight as the drug coursing through his body made him so horny.<br />
<br />
Now naked, Chad&#39;s freed cock sprang up full length straining to cum. Chad stumbled as his thighs fused together.  Bruce moved under his other arm.  With Bruno in the lead they carried Chad sideways up the stairs.  Bruce grabbed Chad&#39;s erect penis with one had to help steet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t even think about it,&quot; hissed Bruno, as he strained under Chad&#39;s weight. Chad was pretty much dead weight at this point even if he looked sort of like a merman out of water.</p>
