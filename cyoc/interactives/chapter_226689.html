<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With the first human assailant captured, the local police force along with the state troopers were able to shift their focus on capturing the second human who has been killing furies since coming to town. With the assumption that Denise Proudhoof was the main target, a dozen state troopers were now waiting near her house while the police sergeant was inside the house along with Denise and her mate Michael.<br />
<br />
“How long before this nut job shows up,” Denise sitting on the sofa; sipping on the wine she was drinking during dinner. Her thoughts on finishing said meal; a meal consisting of duck breast wrapped in a phyllo pastry with pistachios and an Iranian salad that was made with finely diced cucumbers and tomatoes were now replaced with wanting to stalk her would be assassin and ripping out his throat. Denise wondered if these thoughts were typical for a fury feeling threatened or if it was a more primal urge. Being a fury based off of an apex predator, a tiger; Denise wondered if she had new thoughts and urges that have yet to be discovered.<br />
“The human has been careful in evading the troopers so far,” the sergeant responding as he gingerly peaks out the kitchen windows. Ensuring the lights are off so as not to create glare or an optimal target for the human if he is already staked out in a possible sniper’s nest.<br />
“But we know he is masking his scent with deer musk,” the komodo fury turning from the kitchen window and returning to the living room; “so its only a matter of time before the more capable trackers sniff out and catch him.”<br />
<br />
“You sure I can’t offer you something to eat,” Michael putting the leftovers of dinner away for a possible late night snack or lunch for the next day; “its no trouble to warm this up on a plate for you.”<br />
“Thanks but no,” the Sergeant refusing the offered food; “I’m on duty and I don’t want to spoil my appetite. My mate would be rather miffed if I came home full.”<br />
“So I take it no late evening romp to help pass the time,” Denise spreading her legs to show off her fury feline entrance to the police sergeant; watching as his reptilian rod starts peeking out of his vent.<br />
“Come now love,” Michael rolling his eyes; “stop seducing the officer and let him do his job.”<br />
“If my mate were here,” the komodo fury chuckling; “I might be inclined for a little rough and tumble. So long as she gets to join in,” the sergeant smiling as he flicks out his forked tongue.<br />
“I know you can’t say no to coffee,” Michael getting up; his cervine member peeking out of his sheath thanks to his mate’s arousal flooding his nostrils as they flare thanks to inhaling her scent; “would you like it with sugar, cream, honey?”<br />
“Just black,” the sergeant nodding at the offered cup of java; “makes sure you keep the lights off while in the kitchen.”<br />
<br />
*********<br />
<br />
Outside of the Proudhoof house was a mean looking honey badger fury. The white fur on top of his head and running down his back to the base of his tail, while the rest of his fur was a dirty looking shade of black. Flexing the clawed finger of his hand paws as he crouched on the roof of the house. He already got a few worrying looks from the neighbors, some wanting to investigate by knocking on the Proudhoof door. Those curious furies were intercepted by several state troopers and then instructed to go home where it is safe. He had a brand on both of his arms signifying that he is a state trooper so those who noticed but opted to stay away noted that this was a police matter.<br />
<br />
He scanned the back woods that bordered the home as he and many other police officers believed that it would be the most optimal spot for the human to take up position. He was on the roof in case the human decided to try and break into the house to kill Denise and anyone else. The honey badger fury would jump down and subdue the man before he would make it halfway to the backdoor. There were other fury police officers in the woods and hiding in the backyards of the neighboring houses.<br />
“Gods willing, this bastard won’t get off a shot,” the fury muttering to himself as he made another scan of the tree line hoping to spot movement and signal his fellow officers to move in.<br />
<br />
Then he tensed as the state trooper spotted movement from a few trees. Noting that the wind was too light to cause them to sway, the honey badger fury summoned his radio and informed those to stand ready.<br />
“Movement in the trees,” he gruffly speaks low; “standby.”<br />
The rustling continues as he notices several fury police officers move in closer. Like him, they were invisible to human eyes so as to quickly catch the would be assassin by surprise. However the fury swears as the rustling was the result of a mundane raccoon slinking to the compost bin that a neighbor has installed for their garden.<br />
“False alarm,” the trooper muttering on the radio; “just a raccoon.”<br />
“Keep alert,” the sergeant responding on the radio; “the human should be here any moment.”<br />
<br />
The badger nodded as he placed the radio down. Watching as the trash bandit made a meal out of the recently discarded vegetable scraps and egg shells.<br />
“I guess its true,” the trooper chuckling to himself; “you rodents will eat just about anything.”<br />
“Check check,” the radio squawking; “movement spotted twenty yards out.”<br />
The roof mounted spotter turns his gaze back to the tree line and notices movement and the glint of a rifle barrel poking out of the brush.<br />
“Gun,” the badger fury shouts on the radio; at once every fury officer in the area jumps towards the movement and a struggle could be heard but barely seen. He breathes a sigh of relief as the human is dragged towards the backyard where the rear porch light is turned on. Stepping outside was the komodo fury sergeant sipping on a cup of hot coffee as several furies frog march the now restrained human as another walks behind holding the bolt action Remington with a silencer mod attached to it.<br />
<br />
“Looks like your theory was spot on,” Michael Proudhoof stepping behind the sergeant as the troopers walk the perp through the side yard and towards a police cruiser waiting out front.<br />
“And tomorrow there will be a press conference,” the sergeant nodding as he chugs back the last of his coffee; “until then, the two will be sitting in the local jail before being transferred to federal lock up.”<br />
“Why federal custody,” Denise adding as the two return inside.<br />
“One of them killed a state trooper,” the sergeant answering; “on top of the ten they already shot and killed. One of their victims was a defenseless infant cub,” the komodo fury growling; the image of said baby tossed the way it was in the basement of a house still fresh in his mind. “those two are going to find out who is truly the animal,” the sergeant adding.<br />
“And the press conference is to remind any other humans the folly of this course of action?” Michael asking as he escorts the sergeant to the front door.<br />
“That and the rule of law still applies even to them,” the police sergeant answering; “despite that we furies now control and run the world.”</p>
