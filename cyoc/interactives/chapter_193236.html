<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff settled down on a bench not far from the administration building taking out his phone which still had the newly loaded Stella on the screen. He eyed a girl standing under a nearby tree focused on her own phone. <br />
<br />
&quot;Stella, who&#39;s that girl over there?&quot; He instinctually motioned with a nod of his head as if it would help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, I have no idea who you&#39;re referring to.&quot; The small naked girl on the screen seemed confused with a sorry smile.<br />
<br />
So it looks like having Stella wasn&#39;t going to replace having to scan people with the app after all. That kinda sucks... It just means she&#39;ll be useless after a while... He shrugged it off just considering how many of his toys were just the same anyways. It wasn&#39;t like he&#39;d need even need a dildo or those anal beads for himself. He just used them to torment his Jannice doll or more recently his toy ex. Those feelings were still sore even after so long and his thoughts strayed to how he&#39;d left the toy this morning. The crusty thing was laying in the tub with the beads crammed completely inside and cranked to max. <br />
<br />
He huffed with that horny feeling building inside trying to keep from getting a boner right then and there. So instead he focused on what he was already doing, he tapped Kiri from where she sat behind Stella. The two of them switched places with Stella settled in the background rather dejectedly. With Kiri pulled forward, he lifted his phone and scanned the girl across from him. <br />
<br />
Name: Lucy Sloan<br />
Race: Human<br />
Gender: Female<br />
Age: 23<br />
Hair: Black<br />
Eyes: Teal<br />
Height: 5&#39;8&quot;<br />
Weight: 123 lbs<br />
Bust: C<br />
Waist: 30 inches<br />
Gluteus: 34 inches<br />
<br />
Again Jeff switched the girls around and he asked Stella one more time. &quot;Who is that girl?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s Lucy Sloan, age twenty three, birthday August twenty first. What else would you like to know about her?&quot; This time Stella smiled contentedly waiting for further questioning.<br />
<br />
&quot;What does she do on campus?&quot;<br />
<br />
This time, Stella gave a fairly detailed schedule for the girl to a level one might call a stalker. Must&#39;ve happened when she&#39;d become an app by the Chronivac or maybe she was one of -those-... Whatever either way, Jeff was just using the girl in question to test the app really so, it wasn&#39;t like he was going to-<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatcha got there?&quot; Said an unfamiliar female voice. <br />
<br />
Jeff nearly jumped out of his skin as he looked up to see the girl staring down at his phone. Thoughts started racing through his head as all the ways this could go horribly wrong piled into his head. He&#39;d have to get rid of her quickly before she figured out wh-<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... So you&#39;re one of those are ya? Playing your little pervy games and in broad daylight too~&quot; Her eyes had lit up with an amused expression on her face. &quot;Does it move and all that if you poke it and all that?&quot; Just as she made to tap the screen, Jeff pulled it away from her. She made a sly face with her failure to tap the screen. &quot;Oh~ Defending your little plaything are we? Ok Ok, I get it I get it.&quot;<br />
<br />
The thought struck Jeff as he made to close the app then and there. &quot;Hold on, let me just adjust a few things and I&#39;ll show you what it does.&quot; He glanced up at Lucy and saw her mischevious smile as he hastily pressed the autofill command and hoped for the best... He turned to show her with his ring finger hovering &quot;harmlessly&quot; over the start button.<br />
<br />
As Lucy leaned forward to see the screen better. &quot;Lucy Sloan... That&#39;s... That&#39;s my name... That&#39;s a little creepy not going to lie... What&#39;s it say under that? On-&quot; She didn&#39;t get to finish her words before in a split second, she was gone. Her clothes falling to a heap on the ground in front of Jeff. Disappointed he had to be so quick about it, Jeff made to collect whatever it was she&#39;d become from her clothes before a figure stepped around him first. As the figure bent over, her skirt had lifted giving Jeff a full showing of her black lace panties pulling tightly into her ass. As Jeff came back around from the very pleasant distraction, he made to lift phone to scan the girl before him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Error... Scan function experiencing blockage...&quot; Kiri alerted Jeff to something being wrong only moments after he tried. Before he could inspect the &#39;blockage&#39;, the girl spoke first.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t do that if I were you, Sir~ You should hear me out before you waste an opporunity after all~&quot; The girl turned giving Jeff time to see who it was. Her long black fell down her back, knowing icy eyes staring into his, and damn what a rack to compliment the firm ass he&#39;d seen. In her hand she held the former Lucy Sloan gripped firmly around the waste. The toy seemed just as surprised as Jeff before the girl started talking again. &quot;Good work getting rid of that girl, she was most certainly going to sell out your little &#39;secret&#39;~&quot; With the emphasis of the word, she quickly squeezed the toy in her hand with a white knuckled grip. Fluid poured out of the toy like a wrung out sponge drenching the clothes on the ground. She didn&#39;t release her grip as she closed in on Jeff. Stealing a glance at his phone attempting to scan her again, he&#39;d seen what had led to his problem.<br />
<br />
<br />
Name: Lucy Sloan<br />
Inanimate Form: Self Styled Onahole<br />
Gender: Female<br />
Age: 23<br />
Hair: Black<br />
Eyes: Teal<br />

Bust: C<br />
Waist: 4 inches<br />
Gluteus: 5 inches<br />

Inanimate Duration: Permanent<br />
Existence: Aware<br />
<br />
&quot;Existence: Aware&quot;, that one line glared into Jeff&#39;s eyes as he swallowed nervously. So that was what went wrong... Just how was this going to work? Now he was wondering just how the former girl&#39;s existence was going to be seen by her friends or family.As he was trying to get his head wrapped around the issue, breasts were leveled in front of his face. His focus shifted fully to those breasts as a deft hand undid a few buttons giving him a nice view of the pair.<br />
<br />
That same hand found its way to his pants giving his dick a teasing run of a finger. &quot;Now that I have your fullest attention~ I propose a deal, you do something for me and I&#39;ll give you -all- the support you could ever ask for~&quot; She stroked his dick with that finger again and it throbbed under her touch. Her breasts closed in on his face as she leaned even closer. &quot;You seem like such a lonely man~ I&#39;m certain toys like her just aren&#39;t enough for you are they?&quot; <br />
<br />
His fingers felt the warm fluid drip on them before the toy was lowered on them fully. The toy&#39;s lips were parted already from being squeezed so the slick inner lips glided along his finger tips with ease. Soon the lips quivered as the fluids started coating his fingers even more. He&#39;d let his phone get pushed out of his now free hand that was then led by hers. Down into dampened pair of panties with his fingers pressed inside the hot lips within. His hand was guided until it took the motions on its own.<br />
<br />
&quot;See? Isn&#39;t that so much better than a little toy?~ It&#39;s all yours and more if you just. help. me~&quot; Her voice carrying huskily into his ears. &quot;What do you say?~&quot; She leaned further pressing her breasts into his face. The feminine smell, the large soft breasts, and the hot and slick lips was overtaking Jeff. He muffled an agreeement more out of horniness than actual thought. She pulled away from him sliding his fingers out of her panties while freeing his face from her breasts. It took Jeff a bit to see that she&#39;d kept the toy in her grip as well as taking his phone from him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s see what we have here~&quot; She played with the phone for a bit before making one final affirmative tap. Jeff braces himself for the worst but, nothing happens as she hands the phone back to him. He quickly looked to see what she&#39;d done only to see one line had been changed...<br />
<br />
Existence: Seen as normal toy of current possessor.<br />
<br />
He shook his head in disbelief as the girl smiled cruelly at the toy in her hand. She walked over to another girl would paused nearby seeing the pile of clothing. The girl that had taken the toy made a show of displaying it to the new girl. Even the dribbling mess it was making, the new girl just giggled and waved at the toy before moving on. Now she came back to Jeff, gesturing to the toy in her hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope you don&#39;t mind if I take Lucy here as part of the deal. You see, she owes me a debt of sorts and as is, well... She can only repay me with the amusement of her body~ You&#39;ve got such a wonderful plaything there, I -really- look forward to working with you~&quot; She strut confidently away from Jeff leaving the clothes soaked and abandoned on the sidewalk where they lay.<br />
<br />
&quot;Error: Scanner blockage detected.&quot; Kiri called out again as he tried to secretly scan her again. <br />
<br />
Checking the phone&#39;s physical camera, he saw what had caused the &#39;blockage&#39;... There was an old school elementary styled sticker with the words &quot;Nice Try&quot; stylized on it. Just who was that girl and how was this going to play out for him? He could only wait to see at this point... Damn... He was going to need a new pair of underwear...</p>
