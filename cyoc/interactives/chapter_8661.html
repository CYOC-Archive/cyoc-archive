<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty’s Power – Dustin’s experiment – by scriptboy<br />
<br />
Ty didn’t want to leave Peter as a little ten year-old boy, so he decided to grow him back into a fifteen year-old. So Ty made Peter stand up, while he was in his room. Then Ty made Peter’s clothes come off, for he was about to outgrow them. Then Ty concentrated on his powerless cousin, and he began to age and to grow.<br />
<br />
Peter’s legs grew longer and thicker, as his quads came back again. He calves appeared on the back of his legs, and his abdominal muscles popped out of his torso. The pectorals expanded rapidly, as Peter matured back into his old self. Ty thought it was funny that he was the one changing Peter back, because normally he was capable of doing that on his own! But Ty thought that Peter had been too generous by giving Dustin his powers for three days, and Ty started to feel sorry for him.<br />
<br />
“Thanks Ty, I guess it was meant to be that you were the one to help me out this time!” Peter said. Ty looked at his cousin, and wondered how he could stand it, not having his powers anymore. “Don’t you feel weird, being powerless like this? I would never give Dustin my powers, no matter what! You’re being way too nice to him!” Ty said, feeling a little upset with Peter.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry about it. I’ve almost gotten used to being normal!” Peter said. Ty and Peter went back downstairs.<br />
<br />
“Ahh there’s Peter! Come here! I want to try something!” Dustin said to them. Immediately Peter obeyed him, but Ty protested. “Come on, Dustin! Be nice to him, will you? Besides, you’re using HIS powers, you know! I would NEVER give you my powers, the way he did!”<br />
<br />
“I realize that, Ty! I’m not going to hurt him! I just want to play with him and get an idea what it feels like to have his power, that’s all!” Dustin reassured Ty. “Yes, but if you do something stupid, then I am the one who has to fix it!” Ty complained. “Don’t worry, okay?”<br />
<br />
Then Dustin turned towards Peter, who was feeling completely helpless, for Dustin had taken complete control of his body.<br />
<br />
Dustin wondered what he could do to the teenage boy. He wanted to play with him, because he realized that he would lose these powers in another two days and he knew it would be a long time before he would have this opportunity again! <br />
<br />
Dustin closed his eyes and concentrated, and Peter could feel a warm wave go through his entire body. Suddenly Peter was standing on his toes! Then he lowered back on his heels again. Then he hopped a few inches straight into the air three times, as though something had taken over every muscle in his legs. Dustin looked at him and grinned. “You respond very well, Peter! Your body is easy to control!” Dustin said. <br />
<br />
Then Peter ran upstairs and put on his running shoes. He came down and started jogging on the sidewalk. As he came to an intersection, he heard Dustin’s voice in his head. “You’re going to turn right at this street” and Peter’s body obeyed. “A little faster, boy!” a voice said, and suddenly Peter found himself going faster and faster! Then Peter came to another intersection at a busy street, he heard Dustin say “Now turn right and go to the Circle K on your right!” Peter’s legs obeyed him, and he found himself running onto the parking lot of the convenient store. <br />
<br />
Dustin made Peter walk into the store through the glass door. As Dustin looked through Peter’s eyes, he saw today’s newspaper. He made Peter grab one copy, and then he had him walk up to the counter to pay for it. Peter grabbed his wallet and realized that he had no money in it! When Dustin saw that through Peter’s eyes, he got his own wallet out of his pocket and grabbed a ten dollar bill. He made the bill disappear from his wallet, and it suddenly reappeared in Peter’s hand! Peter stood in line and thought to himself “Dustin, may I get something to drink?” Then Dustin made Peter turn around and walk towards the big, glass doors in the back of the little Circle K store. He walked up to the Coca Cola sectioned, opened the door, and grabbed a one-liter-bottle of coke. <br />
<br />
Then Dustin made Peter pay for the drink and the newspaper, and he directed Peter to walk home. Dustin decided to help Peter along, so he made Peter’s legs become stretchy! With every step he took, Peter’s legs were now almost ten feet long, and Peter was able to walk the entire distance of the city block in a minute, taking just a few steps with his stretchy legs!<br />
<br />
A few minutes later, Dustin said to Ty: “He’s walking up to the door right now!” And immediately the door opened and Peter walked in with the newspaper and the soda. As Peter stood in front of Dustin, Ty walked up to him. “Hey Peter, you’re still stretchy!” he said, as he grabbed Peter under his armpits and lifted him up. Peter’s legs stretched out underneath him, and Ty realized that Dustin had left him that way. <br />
<br />
“Don’t you feel silly? Dustin is making you go to the store to buy a newspaper, and you’re not even complaining! And now you’re stretchy, too!” Ty said to Peter. Peter just shrugged and said ‘I’ll have my powers back in two days, so it doesn’t matter to me!”<br />
<br />
Then Dustin had an idea, as he was looking at Peter and Ty, discussing the matter in front of them. He wanted to try something different, as both of them were standing in front of him.<br />
<br />
Suddenly Ty looked up and was looking at himself, while Peter realized he was no longer in his own body. Dustin had made Ty and Peter swap bodies! Peter looked down at himself and said “Hey, I’m in Peter’s body!” while Ty said “Cool! I’m using Ty’s body now!” Peter thought it was cool being in Ty’s body, but Ty wasn’t too happy about it because Dustin was the one who was doing it! “Oh come on Dustin! Put me back inside my own body, will you?” he shouted at Dustin, who was screaming of laughter.<br />
<br />
“It’s NOT funny!” Ty shouted, not enjoying the fact at all that Dustin had the same powers as he did, and in fact, being more powerful than him! Peter was stronger than Ty, but at least he was responsible. And of course Peter was so mellow and laid back, he really didn’t seem to care what Dustin did to his body!<br />
<br />
“Look what you did, Peter! Why did you give him your powers?” Peter said to Ty. Then Peter turned back to Dustin. “Put me back into my body! Swap us back!” he shouted.<br />
<br />
“Alright, alright” Dustin said, as he concentrated. <br />
<br />
“Actually, I really don’t mind it at all…” Ty began to say.<br />
<br />
Then Dustin swapped Peter and Ty back into their own bodies.<br />
<br />
“To be in your body for a day!” Peter finished, realizing that Dustin swapped him back as he was talking.<br />
<br />
Ty grabbed Peter by the arm. “Follow me to my room. We need to talk!” Ty said, feeling a bit frustrated,<br />
<br />
Ty ran into his room, let Peter in, and closed the door. “How could you be so stupid? Why did you give Dustin your powers? Are you crazy?” Ty said to Peter, feeling frustrated.<br />
<br />
Peter realized that Ty wasn’t happy about it at all, and he decided to stay quiet. <br />
<br />
“We got another day-and-a-half to go, before you get your powers back, and he loses your powers. Please, don’t ever do it again, okay? It’s annoying, seeing him mess around with you, using your own powers! I know you guys are best friends, but it’s driving me nuts!” Ty said to him.<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry, Ty. I didn’t realize this would bother you.” Peter whispered. <br />
<br />
“I wish you had your powers back, Peter!” Ty said.<br />
<br />
Then Prince appeared before them. “I cannot grant you that wish. Peter will remain without his powers for another 36 hours. But exactly a day-and-half from now, he’ll get them back, and Dustin will lose them.” Prince said. He then disappeared from his bedroom.<br />
<br />
“I know! We’ll play a trick on him!” Ty shouted excitedly.<br />
<br />
Peter looked at him with a confusing look on his face. “Say what?” he said.<br />
<br />
Ty smiled and concentrated on Peter. Peter shrunk by an inch, the brown hair turned blond. The blue eyes turned green, and the muscles shrunk back a bit. He became a little skinnier and less muscular. Ty grinned, for he had turned Peter into an exact copy of himself! Peter looked just like Ty, and could easily have passed as Ty’s twin brother! Peter walked up to the mirror and gasped. “Oh my goodness! I’m a copy of Ty!”<br />
<br />
Ty chuckled, as he looked at Peter, who was now just like himself.<br />
<br />
“Now, it’s OUR turn to have some fun, right Ty?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, Ty!” Peter answered, in the same voice as Ty himself.<br />
<br />
“I’m beginning to like the idea of having a twin brother!” the real Ty said, looking at Peter, who now looked and sounded just like him.<br />
<br />
