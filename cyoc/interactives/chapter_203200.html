<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ken just stood then looking back at those seated along the bar. He was wondering of what may happen to the lady? He stood for a long moment contemplating the idea of his opening the steel security door himself, and learn maybe of what he saw of the woman was factually real.<br />
<br />
Reaching for the door handle,  and Ken was about to open it, when the door was pushed open. The same Security Guard came back to reenter the bar room; the man being alone, no woman with him. As the guard walked out the door, Ken had a chance look at a dark hallway; as received a nasty look from the guard. The gruff look was if what was inside were not the business of any customer, and as such that Ken return back to and enjoy his drink at the bar.<br />
<br />
A rightful notion gruffly suggested had Ken to consider returning to a bar chair seat. Although, Ken stood there watching the door close slowly as the Guard walked away without even his looking back at Ken.<br />
<br />
A quick move by Ken as he reached his left hand and fingers to grab hold the edge of the door before it closed. As Ken opened the door wide, he stepped through it with a casual look back to those there seated at the bar. No, not one of those seated there looked his way or maybe even gave a care if he should daring then enter.<br />
<br />
As the weighty steel door closed and latched behind Ken entering the dark hallway, the gloomy darkness smelled both of dampness and a musty smell. While the door was open, Ken had felt a slight breeze, but once closed the hall air again felt dank, and again very humidly musty. Walking slowly along the hallway, Ken took note as it tended to drop in elevation, as if he were walking into a cellar. Maybe he might enter a wine cellar, thought Ken; but why would the Guard take that drunken lady into a place like that, it didn&#39;t reason?<br />
<br />
Ken strolled slowly, using caution before he stopped at the junction to a second hallway which turned off to the right. It seemed a breeze was drafting from ahead of him, and he turned to then follow the hallway to the right. He was looking back while wondering still of which hall to follow, until he definitely heard a crude scream come from somewhere straight ahead.<br />
<br />
As throwing all caution to the passing breeze, Ken began to jog forward at a fast walk. He had real suspicions that urged him to move faster, and a devote hope of finding what happened to the lady; as he&#39;d either help her or get the heck away from in there!<br />
<br />
The hallway began to show more illumination coming from ahead of where Ken was walking. As he was getting closer to the light source, as far better lighted, he proceeded cautiously forward. The air movement too was fresher, less dank and musty. The hallway there was lighted by L.E.D. florescent style tube overhead lights, as so bright they made Ken&#39;s eyes need to squint.<br />
<br />
A scream, one of such a horrid sound, sent a chill up Ken&#39;s spine. <br />
<br />
Then another scream and one long scream which seemed to echo out and along the concrete walls of the hallway.<br />
<br />
Voices, Ken heard, of two or three men talking even as the painful moans of someone else mixed in occasionally. Ken came to a hallway corner and carefully he again peered around it with obvious caution. He saw a room, and three men standing around a table, all talking as they would look off to one side as if they were taking note of something just out of Ken&#39;s view.<br />
<br />
What to do, Ken considered to walk forward, past the doorway, expecting the men to then take notice of him when he passed by their open door. Maybe, as brash he could just step inside the room, and boldly ask what he heard or what happened to the lady he had seen taken there by the Bar room guard. Readily, Ken began turning to maybe walk away from the door and forget his impetuous gallant feelings, but Ken stopped. <br />
As with a moaning sound coming from far inside the room, his passion to be of help returned and taking a deep breath he walked into the room. Ken casually greeting the men as if he was part of their company; and he looked to their immediate left. His eyes went wide at the sight, maybe just a glance caused some notice of his English what gave him away as one of the men slapped a hand on Ken&#39;s shoulder.<br />
<br />
Yet the sight there was something right out of medieval history books. Hanging by her shackled wrists, was the lady from the bar which the Guard had cuffed and taken away. She then was stripped naked, a very womanly fashionable body hung there covered from shoulders to toes by dense, as shaggy grayish fur. Ken gawked down at her feet, they different, with toes as then cloven hooves, they just brushed the floor. She wiggled when seeing Ken there, as shivered her breasts, did moan of sounds what melted Ken&#39;s heart.<br />
<br />
Now it was quite plain to see what she was, being tortured and very different from what she came into the Casino being as all a lovely birthing type person. Then she was a lovely woman, well dressed, but when Ken saw her first she was very drunk! <br />
<br />
It seemed that she was paying some sort of price for her angered words back in the Casino. She&#39;d won a booby prize true enough and it was hung even then about her grayed hairy neck. She began kicking her feet slowly as she moaned, her head hung down almost to it touching her chest. Arms stretched down, looking more like forelegs of some animal. Her fingers like toes were gone and replaced by the same black onyx color cloven hooves. Yet she was strung up like a beast about to be skinned and slaughtered. Every part of her naked self was in some sort of intermediate state of change, passing from human to her becoming akin to some large breed of goat.<br />
<br />
Ken&#39;s stance and stare might have alerted the men, or at least one of them that he was not part of the company; and might just be some jerk wandering down from the Bar. As with the asking Ken if he was upset by how the female changeling needed being treated, Ken turned and mustering his best dull look then smiled. It made the man take his hand away and the others to come forward as if ready for hearing of new orders.<br />
<br />
A quick searching look around the room and Ken saw a clipboard setting on the table, it beside several syringes filled with different, or varied colored serums. As Ken asked to see the clipboard and he then flipping from one page to another, felt bold to ask when the subject would be ready to be moved?<br />
<br />
One of the men turned and looked at the poor woman her body having changed to such an extent, that she might hardly have been recognized as ever being wholly human. As Ken walked up to her, he reaching both arms and hands to begin his turning her as she hung there, while making note of the increased thigh muscle growth; then smiled when seeing her up curved goat&#39;s tail.<br />
<br />
Indeed, as if might a manager check the scientific wonders as felt satisfied, what ever happened to cause this change of the lady to a animal form, was well beyond and likely point of her physical return. Likely nobody had any way to stop what was happening, least of all for Ken as able to order the men and have her change somehow back to being a total woman.<br />
<br />
The clipboard told of others who&#39;d come before her, and there cell numbers noted as once they finalized a point of disposition to what was ordered. Ken looked at the clipboard reading as he pondered his next move and what to say or ask. In front of him the pages each had the human names, dates of birth, gender, height, weight, and color of eyes. Then Ken realized that the basic information had come from the person&#39;s drivers licenses. It gave even the home address and if married or single.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pricilla Anne Compton, she was a young woman to 20 years her age, assigned to rapid transition, she a goat?<br />
<br />
Allen Van Handle, 20 years old, as assigned to be a Percheron draft horse, to pull the carriage rides.<br />
<br />
Sally Maye Johnson, Fred W. Barnes, Timothy Viceroy, Kevin Boone, assigned to Donkey duties. All then were by some scientific means changed from being human, would become as animals to service the amusement park.<br />
<br />
Ken paged down the list until his eyes stopped at the sight of reading then of three brothers, David, Jeff, Ben, their names noted together. Their specified final disposition for transport to a Mule stud, and kept there as young virile male donkeys used for stud. The one man noted how Ken saw a name of someone he knew!<br />
<br />
It stopped Ken&#39;s reading and turned him to ask of the three donkeys. Wondering if the three were prepped enough to where they might member what they were, like if they might know what they had become?<br />
<br />
One man looked to the other as they started to laugh. <br />
<br />
Ken felt as if he&#39;d asked a foolish question and maybe given away his real identity. Told then that the young men made donkeys would for the first few days or maybe a week remember their real selves. Yet with the sensation of animal brutal sex and mating, their instinctive drives would wipe clean their thought process leaving them as common sex minded male Jackasses!<br />
<br />
Ken shuddered at the thought of his new found friends ending their young lives as dumb beasts; they used only for the sexual wants of mares and the lusty corporate profits.</p>
