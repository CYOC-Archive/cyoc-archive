<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The Highland Games were still more of cultural exchange type of program for Animalia and thus wasn&#39;t quite the same as many other IAC events was. Most of this came from the fact that there were fewer Animalians living in the UK than in the US, and that the only colony site that was being worked on was on Lord Chumlee&#39;s estate, which was further south and closer to where the border between Roman Britain and the Ancient Scotland was. The Medieval boundaries were a bit different, but the highland games were still north of that line. However that didn&#39;t mean that there weren&#39;t some who took some interest in some of the events, if only to either see them or try them out. Some of that game from Nessa&#39;s performance in the track and field events for the Dinotopians at Dino City, but there were a few that came on their own.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lots of people comin&#39; ta see all the fun,&quot; Nellie commented as the Cryptoclidus Dinotopian looked over a decent sized field that wasn&#39;t too far from Castle MacDuff with sets of stands set along one side of the field that would give contestants a good view events. They weren&#39;t super full, but there were plenty of people there and some were Animalians as well. It lead to a bit of intermixing as some people brought flags which then had Scotland&#39;s white and blue intermixed with America&#39;s red, white, and blue.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d like ta think that was all me,&quot; Nessa commented, &quot;people seemed to be surprised by my attire in Dino City.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That was different,&quot; Nellie agreed, &quot;Did it itch?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really... but then, I&#39;ll also admit that it wasn&#39;t wool,&quot; Nessa told her friend which earned a bit of a laugh, &quot;so what do you think has attracted people?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d think some of it is that Loch Ness now has an actual &quot;monster,&quot; as it were,&quot; Nellie commented, &quot;It&#39;s made for some people comin&#39; to Castle MacDuff as tourists and for some interestin&#39; swims with the tour boats.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What have you got so far?&quot; Nessa wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;A few dozen photographs and a marriage proposal,&quot; Nellie answered with a laugh, &quot;but I had ta tell him that I don&#39;t marry strangers.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nessa laughed at that as the two slowly made their way across to stand by the side of the stands that had been set up for the contest. They&#39;d been set up and designed to be strong and portable, and both Plesiosaur Dinotopians had found that the stands could support their weight when set up, but Nessa and Nellie had learned that their long necks proved to be a better door than a window. Even if the stands could support their weight, if someone had to look through their necks, they wouldn&#39;t get a good sight of the competition going on before them. And the competition was a sight to behold. All of the elements to the traditional highland games were there and were set up to test Animalians and Humans alike.<br />
<br />
There were rows of cabers that lay along a few back areas with a few competitors that were performing stretches near them. Some of the other weighted items that were also to be thrown as part of the contest ware also in set areas essentially behind the main throwing area. Nessa and Nellie had a good view of all of this and watched with some amusement as a few of the Animalians that had come to compete looked on in amusement and even amazement as the Human competitors participated in the same events. The scoring and measuring was a bit simpler than many of the other events in the IAC, as bringing out digital display screens wasn&#39;t a big thing for these games. Though that did lead to some added business for sign makers to put together signs on which names, scores, and distances could be presented for all to see. Though, the thing that made Nessa chuckle was still the interest many Animalians had in the Humans that competed in the Highland games, even if the IAC matches were more for show than anything else because the available competitors, which then further lead to curiosity by some Animalians at those participating in the caber toss.<br />
<br />
Some of the curiosity made sense, as just about every Animalian knew that they held a fair number of physical advantages over Humans, and often strength was one of them. It wasn&#39;t that they weren&#39;t aware of the potential that Humans could reach, as they had noted being an Animalian didn&#39;t mean all Animalians were equally muscular, which could also well mean that they could be aware that there were Humans that with training could compete with some Animalians in certain sports. But the cabers used were large and while the various Human competitors that had come to compete against each other and even coach those Animalians that were interested looked fairly fit, it was more of natural fitness. The people who came didn&#39;t look as though they spent several hours a day in a gym.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re not competing here?&quot; Nellie asked to Nessa as they reached the side of the stands and looked toward the throwing area.<br />
<br />
&quot;I did my throwin&#39; at Dino City to draw up support,&quot; Nessa answered, &quot;see if I could draw up support.&quot;<br />
<br />
She watched as a couple deer Animalians helped one Human get his caber up. She was amused on how amazed the two Animalians looked at the Human holding up the caber and balancing the narrow end in his hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Besides, a part of me is just amused at how amazed some are at how well Humans can perform at these games,&quot; Nessa commented.<br />
<br />
Nellie watched as the Human carrying the caber moved forward and eventually made the throw. It didn&#39;t go very far, and in fact from what she&#39;d seen the Animalian competitors had managed to get greater distance on their throws, though distance wasn&#39;t part of the scoring. But she could agree that the amazement was amusing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I suppose there aren&#39;t many tossin&#39; cabers in Lyre or at Skull Island,&quot; Nellie gave a chuckle.<br />
<br />
Nessa nodded, &quot;which makes this a learning experience for the Animalians that have come to see and compete. Which would also work with what I did for the Highland Games here.&quot;<br />
<br />
They watched as one of the Deer Animalians talked with the Human who&#39;d just thrown the caber while the present judges went over the scoreboard and put their rulings with the scoreboard for the Human athlete&#39;s bracket. The one who&#39;d just thrown was also giving some coaching type advice to the Deer Animalian to help him in the Animalian Bracket with the event.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... it would at least seem to be working,&quot; Nellie commented, &quot;and I&#39;m sure the lessons learned will the IAC version of the Games expand when they&#39;re next held.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s probably a big part of the idea,&quot; Nessa nodded in agreement.</p>
