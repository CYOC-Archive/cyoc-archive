<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Colin morphed into Ced, Rob began to change as well.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
His torso expanded as he shot up past 6' to end up towering over his two friends. Being lanky already, he looked like a pole until mass <br />
began pouring into his frame.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Unlike Ced, who changed part by part, Rob was growing all over at once. His mind couldn't keep up with the changes, as they were <br />
happening so fast. It was as if he were being blown up like a balloon - except this wasn't air, it was pure muscle.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
When he was finished inflating, Rob had 24&quot; guns, a chest so large and round he couldn't see over it, lats that pushed his arms to a 45 <br />
degree angle from his carved 8-pack, and legs that were bowed due to the sheer size of his thighs. His traps had completely obscured <br />
his neck, and his jaw had widened considerably, giving him the look of someone who had abused growth hormone for years.<br />
<br />
Beneath the pecs, so large the nipples pointed downward, almost disappearing in the cleft below the muscle, a bulging 8-pack extended <br />
from his body, another sign of years of hormone abuse.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Rob looked down at himself. His muscles were so big, he found it hard to move, which excited and aroused him. He really didn't want to <br />
be so big. This was just too much. He wanted to go back to his old self. He began feeling his gut with his large, calloused hand, tracing <br />
the distended bricks of his abs, when the next wave of changes began.<br />
<br />
Like B and Ced, Rob was destined to be bald. The back of his skull remained straighter than his African brothers, giving him a few skin <br />
rolls at the back of his neck, adding to his tough look. His lips puffed out much further than the other two, actually entering the bottom <br />
of his field of vision. As his nose got impossibly wide and flat to match his wide jaw, a thin, stylish black gotee began to grow in. His <br />
forehead became more pronounced as his eyes became deep and hooded. He had the face of a real tough thug, but it looked odd with <br />
his pink skin.<br />
<br />
That remedied itself as the last two physical changes took place. At once, his skin turned midnight black. Way beyond his two friends, <br />
Rob was so dark he almost shimmered like polished ebony. Immediately, his member grew and thickened to match his Herculean body. <br />
As his balls grew, he knew he'd give Ced a run for his money for the title of porn king. &nbsp;Rob reached down to grab his new shaft when, <br />
like the others a dark green posing suit formed around his junk, altered to encase his large endowment. Just like Ced, the sensation <br />
almost brought him to climax on the spot.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
As Rob was moving around awkwardly, not able to get used to his new impossible size, and thinking how disgusting these big muscles <br />
were, the mental changes kicked in. Roderick, as he now would be known, was a powerlifter that dabbled in bodybuilding when his <br />
brothers Ced and B could convince him to. Knowledge of both sports poured into his head, displacing his old interests. Like Ced, he <br />
knew he used to be a skinny white kid, but now all he could think about was attacking the weights to build himself up bigger and bigger. <br />
He was obsessed with size, and nothing was going to get in his way of being the biggest motherfucker on the planet. &nbsp;The part of Rod <br />
that was Rob was a little scared at his new aggression, but he found it a bit erotic too, and he had no more choice than the others <br />
about it. &nbsp;His final change hit, as he was inducted into the African Brotherhood and suddenly felt the familial connection with the other <br />
two huge black bodybuilders next to him.<br />
<br />
The man that had been Rob was a muscle bull. A bodybuilder obsessed with size and strength that pushed him beyond aesthetics into <br />
the world of the freakish. He was a year or two older than the others, and the change had dropped his IQ a bit. He wasn't dumb, but he <br />
wouldn't be doing science projects in his spare time anymore. He turned around and saw his two workout partners in a posedown, and <br />
ran as well as his bulk would allow to join them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yo,&quot; an impossibly deep voice rumbled from deep inside Rod, &quot;you two ain't nuttin' but shrimps compared ta me! That ain't muscle, dis <br />
is!&quot; he said as he hit a double-bi, grinning wide, loving how big and thick his muscles were.<br />
<br />
With that, the three huge black bodybuilders that not long ago were skinny white high school boys, looked at each other and flexed a <br />
most muscular, growling at each other. The three then laughed and briefly embraced.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ya know,&quot; B said breaking the silence, &quot;we need ta go workout, and I think I'll take the portable emitter wit us. Never know who we'll <br />
run into at da gym that'll need 'inducting'!&quot;<br />
<br />
All three laughed and ran to get their gym bags. Where there had been three bookbags stashed in the corner, there were now three <br />
gym bags, fully loaded for their bodybuilder owners. &nbsp;The men grabbed them up and headed for the gym, ready to pound the weights.</p>
