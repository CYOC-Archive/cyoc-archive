<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The initial response to the transformation was utter silence. No one believed that this was even possible, but the results were on stage. Most of them knew Sammy, and they definitely knew that he would not be letting Luke ride him while he worked a dildo up his ass unless something horrible happened. To Nick, this was one of the most horrible things he&#39;d ever witnessed. Nick hated everything gay, to the point where he often joined homophobic rallies simply to express his anger. He was not going to let this country go to hell just cause some people chose this disgusting lifestyle. It wasn&#39;t even that he was religious or anything like that. His father just raised him right while the brown haired duo tended to their farm. His mother had passed away long ago, but that just meant he spent a lot more time building muscle and getting a sweet tan on his dad&#39;s field that he one day hoped to inherit. He certainly wasn&#39;t about to be turned into this shit, he thought. He immediately got out of his seat and ran towards the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fucking faggots,&quot; he spat while running. The words immediately removed all his body hair. &quot;Assholes think they can push their homo choices on to me. I&#39;d kick their asses if they weren&#39;t spreading that shit.&quot; He rapidly shrunk from a nice 5&#39;11&quot; to a cute 5&#39;5&quot; while his former impressive 8&quot; dick that the ladies loved turned to 3&quot; inches that would never be used by anyone again.<br />
<br />
He ran straight to one of the doors, while others started getting up and following his lead. There were three doors in the auditorium, perfect for Drew, Ry-Ry and Mikey to close and &quot;guard&quot; with their pheromoned, infection producing boypussys. Really, guarding meant exposing themselves, playing with their toys and letting their boypussys do the work.<br />
<br />
Nick got to the door and was shocked to find Mikey kneeling by the door, sucking off one dildo stuck to the wall while shoving another up his wet hole downstairs. There were other dildos alongside that one lined up adjacent to Mikey&#39;s, as if they expecting others to follow his lead.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like, what the hell? Get out of here with that totes homo shit!&quot; Nick yelled, slapping Mikey&#39;s ass, causing the former nerd to moan even louder than he already was. Nick effeminately gasped in response while covering his mouth with his hands in the most effeminate way possible. He had meant to punch the faggot, he thought. Why did slap his cute butt instead? Why did he think it was so cute? And why was he starting to sound totally like them too? He hadn&#39;t noticed his increasingly twinky mannerisms coming out-- he started leaning on one side, shoving his growing cheeks into the air for anyone to see while his wrist bent to make him seem stereotypically gay. A lip ring starting forming as his plain t-shirt and baggy jeans started becoming a lot more fashionable. Nick constantly kept up with the latest trends, preferring skinny jeans and stylish plaid shirts that he now felt very comfortable in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like, why am I getting so turned on by this? This shouldn&#39;t be so totes hot,&quot; Nick explained as he stopped rubbing the front of jeans, opting to rub his new bubble butt instead. It were perfect for his daddy, he thought. Every since he found the hot man running the farm nearby and begged to be used by him, the farm owner loved fucking his boypussy while yelling about what a hot slut Nicky was. With his practically nonexistent muscles and swishy, posh lifestyle, Nicky originally had trouble fitting in. Soon, however, he&#39;d settled into the groove of things. When he wasn&#39;t being used as his daddy&#39;s personal cumbucket, as new tattoo claimed he was, he was either partying or running his webcam show, where his thousands of followers paid good money to see him take on bigger and bigger animal dicks until he got to riding about 2 horses in a completely different way than intended. He had gotten pretty used to the size, which was odd as his daddy often told him that his hole was just as tight as the day they met.<br />
<br />
Some of the last vestiges of Nicky&#39;s former self had started rewriting themselves. Didn&#39;t he want to inherit the farm when he grew up? Of course, and when he did he&#39;d find a hot new set of muscles to take care of the farm and fuck him senseless everyday. But didn&#39;t he constantly go to homophobic rallies? Yes, but only as a part of a group of twinks called the Seduction Squad, a group comprised of many of the first boys that were turned twink by Ry-Ry and Drew&#39;s doors. The Seduction Squad&#39;s job was simple: end homophobia, three cocks at a time. Nicky smiled as he started shedding his clothes, thinking about the great times he and his squad had. Being their leader, he had to be the most skilled slut on the team to get the job done. And, girl, was he good, he thought. Homophobia in the city had gone way down since he formed the squad, and he loved it. The new slender, posh farmer twink knelt right next to Mikey as started taking two dildos on his own. He slipped a finger in his boypussy and licked the nectar off it, clouding his mind. Yeah, he was a hot, slutty farmer twink, he thought, as he sunk his mouth onto the 12&quot; dildo, careful not to mess up his pompadour with gold highlights. He wanted it perfect for the rally he was attending later. More men needed to know the pleasure of cock and boypussys, he thought with a moan.<br />
<br />
All around the auditorium it was becoming chaotic. Sean had programmed the students and staff to not be able to go past the twinks guarding the auditorium until they were turned and it was having its intended effect. Instead of pushing past the twinks and opening the door, the students just started yelling at them, telling them to move away with the most foul language they could muster. True to the programming, the crowd started thinning out pretty quickly as more and more men became twinks and started grouping up. Kyle, the star of the basketball team, was now a figure skating, purple-haired, lisping twink. The tall man had shrunk to a short skinny twink as he 69-ed with Ricky, the wrestling captain turned bookish twink who could only really think if he had a tongue or a cock in one of his holes, as both boys licked each other&#39;s boypussys with profound vigor. The transformation gave all twinks tremendous flexibility, allowing both boys to become giggly sluts as they licked each other out to their hearts content. <br />
<br />
All around, screams of hatred turned to screams of pleasure as more boys were turned. The soccer team, one of the few real sports teams that would be left after everyone&#39;s transformation was complete, had quickly started focusing their attentions on each other rather than the door. Once their teammate Tobias, turned Tobi, yelled a series of slurs that culminated in him sticking a finger in Barry, the loner turned porn star slut, and licking it, he smashed his DSLs onto Garett, and then Frank and then Chad and so on. By the end of it, the soccer team had new ways of winning on the field. They&#39;d simply fuck the opposing team before the match started and, if anyone resisted, all the team had to do was walk out in their uniforms-- pink speedos with the word &quot;Slut&quot; on each massive butt cheek-- and the opposite team would be so distracted that they&#39;d be forced to lose. It wasn&#39;t like many of them were gay beforehand, but by the end of the game, all the opposing players were questioning themselves, if not doing more.<br />
<br />
As the twinky soccer team made their way over to the remaining football team, now the twink filled nudist cheerleading squad (their cocks acted as a third pompom), some very interesting things were happening in the center of the auditorium...</p>
