<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After the group of now 15 year-olds finished their bathing and began to make their way to their discarded packs to get changes of clothes, all the while trying to cover themselves as best they could.<br />
Each grabbing their pack and darting behind a Bush or shrub to get dressed. Sara, now alone, took the opportunity to examine her body more. Her tail had thickened much more at its base as it grew, but she found she had much more control over it as she swung it experimentally, feeling her horns, Sara realized that her hood was not going to work anymore in covering them up.  Looking closer at her phallus, Sara noted that at the base of the glands some small nubs had begun to grow surrounding it. The organ was stiff and throbbing, radiating heat. Sara moved her hand slowly towards it and hesitantly gripped it, letting out a gasp at the feeling of intense pleasure. They had all had some teaching in what sex and puberty was, but at the time it was disgusting to them, now however.....  Sara, knowing what she needed to do as there was no way she could get dressed with its constant throbbing, and began to move her hand up and down its shaft, moaning with the motions. Sara&#39;s hips began to buck of their own accord as she closed her eyes and moaned, her tail swaying back and fourth rapidly slapping her legs with its motions. Picking up speed, Sara&#39;s balls swinging back and fourth as her hips moved faster, until she felt a tightening in her genitals and let out her first orgasms, as her vaginal lips spasmed and her seed was launched from her dick, the combined sensations causing her to drop to her knees, panting.<br />
<br />
 Sighing, Sara dug out a set of undergarments and after looking at them and then at her body, automatically knew it wasn&#39;t happening and replaced them. Grabbing her largest pair of pants, Sara pulled them up running into issues once she reached just below her rear. The pants couldn&#39;t get over her inflated rear. Sara yanked upwards but only succeeded in making her butt jiggle from the force, &quot;Come on damn you,&quot; sara grunted and pulled harder and heard a tearing sound. Looking back, Sara had managed to tear the seat of her pants in her struggle. Exasperated, Sara pulled them back down and sat on the ground and pulled the sewing kit from her pack. She was thankful that the thieves school had a course on sewing to make disguises and using material from her other clothes made her choices fit better, and had added a hole for her tail, as it&#39;s longer size made tucking it in her pants painful as she found out on her first attempt. She noted her crotch of her pants were kinda tight from her growth and the legs only stopped at mid calf length instead of the former ankle length. Her white button up shirt fit for the most part, except that she felt her breasts squished in her shirt slightly and the buttons were stretching from the tit-flesh. She was happy that her leather vest could still be worn, even if it couldn&#39;t be fastened closed without causing further discomfort. <br />
<br />
Leaving her hideaway, Sara saw Vect emerge from his own, clothes in a similar state like her. His shirt revealing a flat midriff from his increased height and pants showing a slight bulge in his crotch despite the clear stitching alterations he had made to make some room and carrying his shoes in one hand, &quot;they won&#39;t fit me anymore,&quot; Vect offered as an explanation when he saw Sara look at his bare feet. Soon Jack and Lelu also emerged dressed in some form or another. Jack&#39;s white shirt simply could not be buttoned up as he had gained some noticeable muscle mass. Lelu still had on a blue mages robe, but it was now hugging her body and was only long enough to go just past her knees as opposed to the nearly ground length it used to have. As they all looked at each other, Sara somehow knew that they had also pleasured themselves, she didn&#39;t know how, but she just felt it the lust radiating from them slightly. &#39;Must be my succubus instincts getting stronger,&#39; thought Sara with a twinge of disgust.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we&#39;re dressed, sorta. Now what,&quot; asked Jack a little self conscious of his exposed chest. &quot;How about some food, and I mean real food. Not weird aging fruit,&quot; said Vect as he left and returned with some dry branches he had found behind his bush. &quot;I&#39;ll get the meat we packed, Lelu will you please get some water,&quot; asked Sara as she dug into her pack for her provisions.<br />
<br />
After the 4 had started a fire and had dinner, they all tried to continue their routine of studying their survival books, but they couldn&#39;t get over the changes that had happened to them. Jack and Lelu had fallen asleep next to each other and Sara was looking at her hands seriously. &quot;Hey what&#39;s wrong with your hands,&quot; asked Vect as he slid over next to her. &quot;Did you hurt them,&quot; concern creeping into his voice.<br />
&quot;No, but the tips have been aching since we had aged suddenly,&quot; replied Sara, her tail twitching back and forth behind her. &quot;What&#39;s happening to me Vect?&quot;<br />
&quot;Maturity,&quot; offered Vect as he shrugged his shoulders slightly, &quot;I don&#39;t know the process of succubi maturity.&quot;<br />
Sara began to lean on Vect&#39;s shoulder in dismay, &quot;I can&#39;t deny it, I&#39;m becoming a monster.&quot;<br />
&quot;Hey, hey,&quot; Vect said softly as he turned toward Sara and grabbed both of her arms, looking deep into her eyes. &quot;You are not a monster, and no matter what changes you go through, you will always be Sara, the scrawny little girl i saved from that giant rat year one.&quot;<br />
&quot;Why do you always bring that up,&quot; asked Sara, her tone getting a little more cheerful as she remembered how she had fallen down a sewer and cornered by a giant rat and Vect came leaping out of the shadows and saved her. As she gazed into his vibrant green eyes, she couldn&#39;t help but become lost in them as they reflected the firefight.<br />
&quot;Um, well we should probably get some sleep, we still have nearly 2 weeks of travel to go,&quot; said Vect suddenly as he had realized he was staring into Sara&#39;s brown eyes and the two began to bundle up for the night.</p>
