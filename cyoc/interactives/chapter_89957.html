<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sunday dragged by for Patrick, several times he was about to go over to Brian’s but he did not want to seem too clingy or desperate. Finally Monday morning arrived and he jumped out of bed his heart beating at the thought of seeing Brian again. At school Patrick finally saw Brian and his appearance shocked him. He had gained weight not fat just bigger. His once normal sleek hair was now curly and a rats nest. And to top it off he was wearing gray sweat pants pulled up high and glasses with thick black frames. He sees Patrick and his face lights up and moves towards him. Everyone in the hallway is looking at Brian to his dramatic transformation from star soccer player to this.<br />
“Hey Patrick”<br />
“Brian when did you get glasses.”<br />
“Yesterday I woke up and my vision was horrible so they took me to the ophthalmologist and they had to give me glasses. These were the only pair they could give me on short notice. I kind of like them anyway.” Brian let out a laugh that ended in a snort. All the kids around him started to back away like he was radioactive. Patrick looked up at him and felt a stirring and quickly put his hand in his pocket.<br />
“They look great.”<br />
“The team kicked me off for my bad performance and attitude, good thing because my parents can’t afford sports goggles.” Brian says with a shrug.<br />
At that moment Mary comes storming up “Brian what the fucked happened to you. You look like a stupid nerd and someone said you got kicked off the team.”<br />
“Yea, and?” Brian just looked at her with disinterest<br />
“WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU? WE’RE OVER.” Mary turned and stalked off. All the kids staring and laughing at the drama.<br />
 A former teammate walks up and slaps him on the back “Great job bud.”  And turns and leaves and everyone behind Brian starts to laugh. Brian glances back and just shrugs again. The first bell rings and Brian starts to go off to class but stops and asks. <br />
“Want to come over this afternoon and play some video games?”<br />
“Yes, see you at your house.” As Brian turns and walks off Patrick sees a “Kick Me” sign on his back and runs and rips it off. Brian turns and looks down at it and hugs Patrick.<br />
“Thanks” Patrick can’t believe how turned on he is for Brian and his new appearance, he was looking sillier and sexier by the day. Brian joined him at lunch, everyone avoided their table, and they talked about sci-fi movies and games all lunch as Brian rubbed his foot against his. After school they rode the bus to Brian’s house. As soon as they walked through the door Brian’s mom started yelling. The coach had called about him being kicked off the team and his mom laid into him about his attitude and throwing away a bright future. Brian yelled back and the fight escalated. Finally as Patrick made it to the door to leave Brian shouted that he didn’t want to be part of this family anymore and turned and dragged Patrick out of the house. They walked into the park Patrick and Brian held hands and Patrick didn’t know what to say to a crying friend.  <br />
“My stupid parents, all they have ever cared about is my soccer. They want me to get a good contract and spend all my money.” Patrick stopped and pulled Brian into a hug. After a while Brian pulled back and looked at Patrick.<br />
“Thanks, you’re the best.” He leaned in and kissed Patrick his hands finding his butt and squeezing.<br />
“Come on” Brian said as he broke the kiss and led Patrick into a small clearing in the wooded park. They laid down arms around each other. Brian kissed him and ran his hands up his shirt. Patrick copied him and soon both of them were shirtless.<br />
“I wish we could just run away, be who I wanted to be and be with you.” Brian whispered into Patrick’s ear.<br />
“You can.”  Brian and Patrick jumped apart at the sound of a high pitched voice. Turning around Patrick saw Jac sitting at the edge of the clearing.<br />
“Cool a clown!” Brian jumped up excited and ran over to Jac. Patrick lay there in stunned silence feeling a little guilty at being caught by Jac kissing another boy.<br />
“I’m Jac.”<br />
“I’m Brian and this is my boyfriend Patrick. You look familiar.” Patrick’s heart soared at being called a boyfriend and he got up and walked over to Jac.<br />
“I am a friend of Patrick’s.” Brian spun around “Cool, you’re friends with a clown. I love clowns.” Brian lets out a loud laugh and snorted.<br />
“That’s good.” Jac says “You can run away with us and be silly and free and be who you want to be. You can be a clown.”<br />
“A clown, cool. I can paint my face as dress like one and be funny?”<br />
“No, you can become a real clown and come live in Clown City.” Brian looked a little confused. Jac turned to Patrick “Show him.” Patrick stood there thinking before pulling out the clown nose and placing it on his nose with a suction feeling. He felt the familiar tingles start to race over his body and he moaned in pleasure as his skin flashed white. He giggled as a red muzzle formed over his mouth and his eyebrows vanished and blue diamonds formed over his eyes. His hair curled up and turned into a rainbow afro. His feet shot out and were enclosed in red size 24 shoes as his body expanded to a ball. White gloves encased his four fingered hands. A blue button up shirt and yellow pants appeared on his body along with rainbow suspenders and a purple bowtie. He smiled at Brian and felt his lips expand and grow into a permanent smile.<br />
Brian stood there with an envious shocked look on his face, Patrick’s eyes found his crotch and smiled. He walked over and kissed Brian with his red lips, his four fingers rubbed his crotch.<br />
“Awesome. I can be a clown?”<br />
“Yup, and we can have a new life together.” Patrick said “Do you want to be with me?”<br />
Brian looked at Patrick in the eyes and said “More than anything.” and kissed him. Patrick’s free hand found his nipples and started to play with them as Jac kissed his neck from behind.<br />
Brian felt shocks of pleasure shoot through him as they continued to touch him but a new feeling was developing. His lips tingled in addition to the soft touch of Patrick’s lips and he stopped and looked at Patrick and smiled and never wanted to stop. His lips grew bigger and turned red as his smile grew. The tingles grew stronger as the moved over his body. Looking down at his bare chest he saw it start to lighten as the tingles race over his nipples. Under Patrick’s fingers his nipples grew hard and green before exploding into tiny green balls. Patrick squeezed them and they squeaked as Brian rolled his eyes in delight. His curly afro grew larger and turned blue, exploding around his ears which doubled in size, a sweat band appeared and held it his afro at bay. Under his glasses his eyebrows disappeared and thin black arches appeared over them. Two lines of blue freckles appeared on his cheeks. Brian fell into a fit of laughter which turned to yucks as his two front teeth grew larger. His feet grew longer and fit into a pair of red bubble toed shoes. Purple pants appeared around his legs that were too short and showed two inches of white socks. The pants were held up by a pair of green suspenders over a red and purple polka dotted shirt with a yellow bowtie at the neck.  Bumbo groaned as he felt a pressure build in his nose and kissed Patrick hard as he held him in a tight hug. Patrick and Jac felt him shudder as he moaned and with a pop his nose exploded into a green ball. His eyes crossed and glazed over as new memories inserted themselves taking over old ones. Patrick embraced his lover as suddenly his eyes crossed too and his mind clouded over. New memories, ideas and skills rushed into his head.<br />
“Thith wath a thery fun trip but I think we thound go home.” Bumbo said wrapping his arms around his friend and lover.<br />
“Great idea.” Jac said as he reached into his pocket and unfolded a door before opening it to a swirl of color. Brian gave his love a kiss before they step into the swirl.</p>
