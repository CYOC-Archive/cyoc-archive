<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Karen gives you another kiss to lips in the schoolyard and you feel her pulling and pushing you towards the backseat of her small car. She is looming over you as you lie on the seat. Karen looks like a big mama bear ready to eat it’s meal. A mature treat for your eyes as her voluptuous and curvy motherly body makes you feel funny things inside you.<br />
<br />
“Penny told me what happened at the school. You naughty naughty boy.” Karen states while she continues kissing you.<br />
<br />
“She did? But it was an accident! I didn’t mean to. You are my wife and I shouldn’t-” You panic a little but you suddenly feel more calm. You feel like you never said those things to her but instead said something different to make things more heated. You can sense that you mind deeply immersed in the role of being her husband. Like you are believing the memories you just got and almost, as if not completely, forgetting the previous life you had prior the notebook. Your mind takes more of a backseat as you feel that your body is once again taken by someone else.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was a bit peckish, so to speak. I think your daughter was a good snack before the main course.&quot; Your tell to her. You feel dazed as you can&#39;t tell if you are still in control or are you inhabiting someone else&#39;s body. All these new memories and expenriences are making your mind dizzy as if you are slowly adapting to the new changes. The invisible world order is making you more masculine and charming as if you&#39;ve always been. Karen looks like a girl you&#39;ve always dreamt about and you don&#39;t mind that she&#39;s a bit older than you are. You have always been more wine guy as you have more refined taste in women. You let your lips and eyebrows do the talking as your body is moving forward on it&#39;s own and knows what it&#39;s doing. <br />
<br />
“Is that so? Darling. Remember how you promised me that if you ever came into my daughter’s mouth, I would finally be able to do this without a condom.” Karen laughs and takes off your shirt and lowers your pants and underwear.<br />
<br />
Karen throws her jeans and thong on to the car’s dirty floor and sits bottom half naked on top your cock. Ready to insert it inside her.<br />
<br />
“Yeah honey. Make me hot and hard like you always do.” You exclaim as Karen starts to dry-hump your crotch with the force of a horny cow. You feel how this middle aged woman is ready to take the contents of your balls inside her. You getting way too horny not to stop her as she feels warm and your balls are aching for some more action.<br />
<br />
“Penny always wished for a sibling when she was a little and how I’ve yearned to make pregnant content to my channel. So let’s do this quickly while she’s with Sparky.” Karen exults as she starts to take her top off and is now completely naked fucking you in the school parking lot.<br />
<br />
You huff at very rapid pace as the perverted woman makes you hard. She knows what strings to pull. Compared to Penny the difference is between night and day. Penny is good but her mother is godsend and gives out a slight glimpse what a goddess of fertility should be like. You feel your metal cogs inside your brain start to turn, your mind starting to race with lewd fantasies and you realize how you&#39;ve been waiting for this moment. You want to impregnate Karen. Even though Karen is a single parent and Penny&#39;s mother, you feel like she&#39;s your girlfriend. No. Your lover. No. Your wife. She’s the precious soft muffin who always thinks about you. A goddess who protects you with those massive mammaries.<br />
<br />
Penny is just a priestess who knows how to cleanse your sinful horny soul while Karen is the big god who Penny worships. Karen must have shown her daughter at early age how to treat people right as Karen spins her tongue inside your mouth like a king cobra playing with it’s pray. The smell of Karen&#39;s sweat, the leathery smells of the seats in the backseat of the car, the slight hint of cigarette in the air makes you horny when she&#39;s naked on top of you and kissing you. She whispers in your ear how much she loves you and makes authentic sounding moans. <br />
<br />
Karen smothers you with her two big melons which makes you go crazy as her pussy lips are swallowing your cock inside them. She lets you breath here and there but keeps your face warm most of the time. Every kiss she gives you is heavenly. You can see why you wanted to date her. You can feel the wetness spreading from her inner vagina like a ketchup on your wiener as it is gracefully inserted inside her hot dog bun. Pumping up and down like a well oiled spring. It is like you are lying on top of a nimbus cloud.<br />
<br />
You feel how strangely perverted this all is and you forget how you&#39;re only a couple of feet away from the school. You guardian angel named Karen starts to pick up the pace, making the car sway. You feel how you finally get your diamond-hard penis to squeeze into you and start to push it inside Karen and how the burst of ecstasy inside you makes you feel like this is the right decision.<br />
<br />
*thud, thud, thud, thud*<br />
<br />
The car makes loud noises as you are in full ecstasy mode ready to come inside her. In your dazed state you can’t concentrate on anything else as your eyes spin around the car as the eyes finally land on the car’s window. You spot Penny on the other side, eyes and mouth open, looking in. From her expression, you can tell she wasn&#39;t expecting you to have sex so early.<br />
<br />
&quot;MOM! WHAT THE FUCK! I remember you said you wanted to exchange &#39;a few words&#39; and not &#39;a few fucks&#39;.&quot; You hear Penny exclaim as she opens the back door behind your head. Sparky jumps next to you and starts licking your face. Very quickly you feel very uncomfortable and your steel rod becomes soft like freshly cooked angel hair pasta.<br />
<br />
“PENNY! We were so close! Look what you did! God! Now listen here missy before we-” Karen yells red-headedly at Penny, then she exits the car butt naked and then slams the car door shut. You can hear Karen continue her rant outside of the car but it’s too muffled to make out what she’s saying.<br />
<br />
You turn your head and see Karen putting her thong and jeans back on her on the school’s parking lot while shouting to her daughter. Penny shouts back at her topless mom for a while as Karen’s nipples bounce up and down. Penny doesn’t seem to care that her mother is half naked in front of her and Karen doesn’t seem to care if someone sees her like that. You think that it’s a bit weird but that’s normal for them. You hear them having a small argument but at some point during the conversation they calm down and hug each other.<br />
<br />
You don’t know what to think about the situation when the friendly dog &#8203;&#8203;pants next to you. You pet Sparky on the head as you see and hear the mother and daughter jump into the front seats of the car. <br />
<br />
“Okay. So. Let’s go to the supermarket then. Sorry that we couldn’t finish. Forgot how little time we had left today.” Karen apologizes to you as she starts the car engine. Karen still topless as she lights a cigarette and offers the same light to her daughter’s cigarette. It takes a small reminder from her daughter that her mother has no shirt on to Karen to put something to cover her chest. Karen pulls her top back on from the backseat and put it back on her. You notice that Karen looks a bit annoyed when she does it as if she found clothing uncomfortable to wear.<br />
<br />
Then as Karen reverses the car and turns the wheel. You try to put on your seat belt but you quickly realize before you can do it that no one else is wearing one. Maybe Karen and Penny don&#39;t care about driving safety or maybe they&#39;re just used to driving like this. Both of them huffing their cigarettes as if it was normal day for them. You look out the window and realize to your horror that your backpack with your notebook in it is left in the school parking lot. Panicking, you watch as the car drives away from the school yard and ask Karen if she can drive back to the parking lot to get your backpack.<br />
<br />
“We have a bit tight schedule ahead of ourselves. Sorry honey. You&#39;ll get your backpack tomorrow. That school isn&#39;t going anywhere as it’s been there when I went there. Ha ha ha. I’m sure someone will notice it and pick it up.&quot; Karen laughs and downplays the importance of your backpack.<br />
<br />
You think to yourself that one day without a notebook shouldn&#39;t be a big deal. You&#39;re the only one who knows its true power, and no student would be so stupid as to suddenly start doing exactly what you did with the notebook. Right? You feel very vulnerable when Karen parks her car in the parking lot of a large supermarket and treats you like you&#39;re a couple as she exits the driver’s seat. Karen’s holding your hand like a lover while Penny walks Sparky on a leash as all four of you enter the department store. You feel a little scared when you&#39;re completely adrift in the middle of an unknown ocean and you don&#39;t know if that&#39;s a good thing or a bad thing. But as people say. When in Rome...</p>
