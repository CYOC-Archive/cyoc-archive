<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty enjoyed his day. As he had started Dustin&#39;s twenty-four hour timer around twelve midday, and so far Dustin kept his diaper dry and clean. But Ty was sure he would mess it soon. He noticed Dustin didn´t eat or drink anything in hours, so he figured a way to not lose to much. „Well, let´s make it a bit harder for you, Dustin.“ Ty thought and willed Dustin to both get hungry and thirsty, and made a bottle ready to give to his baby brother.<br />
Dustin didn´t want to, but his now burning stomach got him to drink from his bottle while laying in Ty&#39;s arms, and unbeknownst to him Ty willed that Dustin would always empty his whole bottle, so he drunk it dry in no time before Ty returned him to his playpen.<br />
Not twenty minutes later Dustin couldn´t stop himself as he soaked his diaper, pissing away around four years of memories. Only to Ty placing some basic memories in Dustin&#39;s mind he still remembered Ty afterwards as his big brother. But he forgot about this game to keep his memories, as well as that Ty was responsible for his regression, which he now didn´t understood anymore. But he remembered how old he was before, as well as what his things had been.<br />
After a short wait Ty checked on him, and discovered the soaked diaper, quickly changing Dustin into a new one, much to Dustin&#39;s protest for his comics. <br />
Ty smiled when half an hour later Dustin made a new mess, taking some knowledge with it. He could relearn it when he was old enough again. So Ty changed Dustin&#39;s diaper yet again. Dustin lost his knowledge of geography and chemistry in this go, along with his bullying attitude.<br />
Dustin played with some oft he blocks, trying to distract himself, but it was still boring to his older mind. Yawning in boredom he decided to sleep a bit, so he crawled tot he small blanket and a big teddy, cuddling with it before falling asleep. He already couldn´t remember that the teddy used to be his old school bag, not that it mattered right know.<br />
An hour later Ty bought a new bottle, softly waking Dustin to drink it. Dustin drunk it while sitting on Ty&#39;s lap, and after it was dry quickly drifted off to sleep again. He soaked his diaper in his sleep without waking up, even when Ty changed him afterwards. This time it had been five years of memories, so already half of them were gone by now. He also lost his badmouthing attitude with it.<br />
Dustin woke up hours later, and finding his diaper still dry and clean he relaxed a bit, not noticing it was changed while he slept. But relaxing soon triggered his bowels again, and he again lost some of his learned knowledge. BY the time he stopped messing his diaper he could barely do any math and didn´t understand biology anymore.<br />
As it was a weekend Ty had to look after Dustin, but that was also part of his wish. At least while the old Dustin was still existing he wanted to watch after him. So he played with Dustin for two hours, ignoring it was nearing midnight and also Dustin&#39;s half-time point.<br />
Dustin was split between enjoying time with his big brother and trying to keep his old self as it was. Ty was mean, because he got a new bottle for Dustin. He would make sure that the old Dustin wasn´t in there anymore when the time was up.<br />
Dustin happily drunk his bottle dry, only realizing it afterwards as a bad thing. He feared losing more of himself, but couldn´t stop it now.<br />
This time it was fewer fluids he pissed out, but it was still worth three years of memories and his laziness. And before Ty had a chance to change Dustin&#39;s diaper he also started to mess it, giggling at the tickling in his head. Now his knowledge of math was completely gone and had no concept of history or physics anymore. Beside that it also took the knowledge of his comics, so in addition he didn´t thought about his diapers as anything valuable anymore.<br />
Soon he was back to sleep, and Ty decided to put the sleeping baby into his crib before heading to bed himself. Ty willed Dustin to sleep through the night before he was out like a light, too.<br />
The next morning at eight Ty made a new bottle for Dustin and woke him for it. Soon after Dustin messed and soaked his diaper again, and as Ty probed he was happy to find no memories in Dustin&#39;s mind beside the ones placed there by him and the first couple of days in young Dustin&#39;s life. Also his character was now that of an innocent, little angel that would work hard later. So Ty was satisfied as he lifted the game wish as well as the not crying one. He would make sure Dustin would grow up better than before. Life would be better from now on, even when he had to watch after his baby brother Dustin often. But he wouldn´t complain about it, after all he wished it to be like this.</p>
