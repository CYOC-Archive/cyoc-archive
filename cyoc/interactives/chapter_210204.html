<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was the beginning of school holidays (the party at Simon’s being to celebrate end of term). On Monday morning Paul met up with Dave and Simon for an unofficial basketball practice. Paul was embarrassed that he could not shoot nearly so well as has mother had on Friday night when she had occupied his body. It didn’t help his confidence when Dave pointed out how “Unco” he seemed to be.<br />
<br />
It also didn’t help that Dave began boasting that he had shared a kiss with Tracy at the party. Dave was clearly angling to find out how far Paul had got with Melissa. They had a standing bet about who would make it to 1st base first. 1st base defined as getting to feel a girls boobs. The loser would be buying the victor the video game of the victor’s choice. Clearly Dave had made progress at the party but wasn&#39;t quite there yet. <br />
<br />
Technically Paul had felt a female&#39;s breasts and had already won the bet. Unfortunately he didn&#39;t think he could claim victory. They were his mothers breasts and he had felt them when he had possessed her body. He did not want Dave or Simon to find out about the medallion and certainly didn&#39;t want them to find out he had been female for over 24 hours. He couldn&#39;t even claim that he had kissed Melissa, Paul’s mum had made it clear that she had not given Melissa a kiss, so Paul couldn’t lie to say that he had. <br />
<br />
So Paul was in a bind. Dave had a big grin on his face when he reminded Paul of their bet. Dave was now confident of victory. Paul vowed to himself that he will push Melissa to get there on when they have their date.<br />
<br />
........<br />
<br />
Mandy decided she would spend the morning updating her wardrobe, as she had to run some ballet lessons in the afternoon. She went to the local shopping mall and had just exited the lingerie store with two new bras when she spotted Melissa entering a boutique. Mandy could not acknowledge that she knew Melissa and Melissa did not recognise Mandy in her own body. <br />
<br />
Curiosity got the better of Mandy and she entered the boutique and pretended to look through some clothing racks close to where Melissa was talking to a shop assistant. She overheard Melissa tell the shop assistant &#39;I&#39;m looking for something to wear on a first date&#39;. <br />
<br />
Mandy couldn’t help but sticky beak and caught glimpses of Melissa as the teenager tried on several different outfits. Even now that she was female once more, Mandy recognised what a good-looking girl Melissa was. Mandy approved of the rust coloured dress that Melissa finally settled on. Mandy herself decided that since she had been hanging around in the boutique for so long herself, that she needed to buy something as well. She ended up purchasing two tops to fit her new bust.<br />
<br />
During the afternoon Mandy learnt the downside of having bigger breasts. The extra cup size seemed to double the wobble as she demonstrated ballet poses to her classes. She would need to by some new sports bras as well if she decided to keep these breasts.<br />
 <br />
That evening Mandy received a phone call from Dave&#39;s mother Naomi. She invited Mandy and Madeline over for a play date.  Without thinking too much Mandy accepted. They settled on Thursday morning as Mandy didn&#39;t have to work until the afternoon. She thought Paul had seemed to enjoy his previous experience of being Madeline. He made such a gorgeous little girl. <br />
<br />
Paul was aghast when Mandy told her what she had arranged. He refused point blank. ‘No way Mum! That was an accident that I don’t ever want to be reminded about it. I hated been a little girl’<br />
<br />
Mandy was puzzled by that statement. She recalled Madeline squealing with delight as she played with the slightly older Kimberly both at the basketball stadium and the morning after when Kimberly and Naomi had dropped in to donate some clothes to Madeline. She recalled Madeline’s smiling face as she gave a fashion parade of the dresses Kimberly had given her. Either Paul was a very good actor or he was lying. Perhaps his masculinity was threatened?<br />
<br />
&#39;Oh come on Paul, it looked such fun being a little girl. Surely it&#39;s not that hard. You could change the night before and that way you become yourself again as soon as we are back home. I have to be at work by 2 so it would be only until lunchtime at the latest&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;If it is so easy and so much fun being a little kid then why don&#39;t you do it? I can take you there and would be only too happy to hang around at the Scott&#39;s for the morning&#39; Paul was imagining a mix of backyard basketball and video games with Dave.<br />
<br />
&#39;Really?&#39; answered Mandy in surprise. She pictured Paul once more wearing her body and having coffee and cake with Naomi &#39;If you are happy to do that, I&#39;m in. I&#39;m sure it will be fun&#39;</p>
