<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lawrence whispered to Marie-Eliza, &quot;Karthrine found out? But how? Marie lied to her. You <br />
are NOT going to tell me Linus told her, there would be no way that she'd trust him if he <br />
did that!&quot; <br />
<br />
Marie-Eliza whispered back, &quot;Kathrine had learned how to read opponents from her boot <br />
camp with the lupmans, and she proved even when burned and recovering she could be a <br />
dauntless and stubborn as ever... finally Marie told Linus to tell her, Marie not able to bear <br />
to tell Kathrine the story herself, sure Kathrine would hate her afterwards.&quot; <br />
<br />
Lawrence nodded still whispering, &quot;But she didn't.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No she didn't. Their bound of friendship was as strong as iron.&quot;<br />

1689<br />
<br />
When Mahershalal Bialyk's Prime Mate returned she asked where their poor daughter <br />
Aimiliona was, if she had wandered off again, and worried knowing she had be watched <br />
constantly since coming down with the wandering demons. <br />
<br />
&quot;She's gone to be made better.&quot; Mahershalal Bialyk replied simply. She implored and slowly <br />
pulled facts from her entranced mate. She was in an uproar when she found out he had <br />
side stepped her duty as a mother to decide what was best for the cubs, but he remained <br />
as stalwart as stone (the geass made sure of that) and after much screaming and sobbing <br />
(to which Mal'akh covered her ears and hide leaving her first kill outside) she finally <br />
conceded if the three witches could somehow heal her... maybe... maybe it was for the <br />
best. She still cried. <br />
<br />
Mal'akh also wondered what madness this was, sending away her sister to be with those <br />
witches that had driven her mad in the first placce... Not that anyone actually listened <br />
Mal'akh when she said this, most just looked at her with glassy eyes telling her to not make <br />
up stories.  Mal'akh promised she'd get her sister back, some day. <br />
<br />
At the witch's orphanage/estate. <br />
<br />
&quot;Everyone!&quot; Gaal called out as she entered the expanding witch's house with Golgotha <br />
leading Aimiliona inside by the paw, Aimiliona looking at everything with a semi-half <br />
interest still chewing on the gold deer bone like a little cave woman. <br />
<br />
The Thirty six human children (instead of thirty seven with Meranda dead), fourteen <br />
children who had been cursed, and twenty who had been part of the gang that had <br />
attacked the witches plus Samantha and Alissa), and the two leomans and two lupmans <br />
(the two pups former part of the mobs). <br />
<br />
&quot;This is your new sister Aimiliona.&quot; She gesture to her, she looked almost dimly at the <br />
others, but a few days of the witches magic flowing through her would bring order to her <br />
mind. <br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to your new home Aimiliona.&quot; Joella said first hugging her. the leoman cub didn't <br />
return the hug. The two Witch Pride cubs also hugged Aimiliona. This was followed by the <br />
pups. (Samantha and Alissa's parents were in the market picking up supplies, where the <br />
witches got their money was best left not thought about or questioned and thankfully most <br />
was 'donated' for the good cause of the afflicted children.). <br />
<br />
Lark, Canary, and the rest of the former mob then hugged her. This was followed by the <br />
afflicted children. And finally the Witch Pride leomans. <br />
<br />
As Joella took Aimiliona paw and led her on an excited tour of the house's playroom, bed <br />
rooms, garden, kitchen, foyer, living room, out houses, and yes, graveyard, Gaal looked at <br />
the Witch Pride. <br />
<br />
Joella had no idea that one day this entire estate would be hers as it's sole legal heir or she <br />
would continue her foster mother's work, or rather, would continue what she thought was <br />
their work: helping the innocent. <br />
<br />
&quot;As soon as you are finished with the bedrooms, I want this house made so it can without <br />
an attack by a platoon of soldiers. No one shall harm a member of our family ever again!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. Of course. As soon as possible. We'll work, work, work as hard possible.&quot; Said <br />
Mondain Renard. The other male leoman now left in the Pride now that Frank was gone. <br />
The witches would debate on weather a replacement was needed later. <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
With the mind of the game gone, only the mind of the person making the Transform or <br />
Dare remained to interpret his own words. The punk when he made his Transform or Dare <br />
had precisely said that the leoman love doll would be only for him, and there should have <br />
been no way a Transform or Dare to his victim should have changed him. <br />
<br />
But this had apparently twisted with the 'cascade' effect inside all Leoman except Mary. <br />
And deep down, perhaps the Punk, now a 'male' love doll named Leon, had wanted to be <br />
free of the weight of life, and had in the black muck of his soul wanted to be just loved.  <br />
And the Transform or Dare, twisting with the cascade effect had granted him the simple <br />
existence he had subconsciously wanted. <br />
<br />
 The phrasing of his Transform Or Dare however, had insured the threads of fate would <br />
make sure the 'female' love doll Leona, and the 'male' love doll Leon would never be <br />
separated. And Leon was the same as Leona, 'top quality and would never need repairs.' <br />
<br />
And of course the fact that the punk had never ever said anything about his victim being <br />
erased from the timeline, showed again, this was due to the Transform or Dare twisting the <br />
cascade effect within the love doll. <br />
<br />
Of course how the game would now interpret Leona being 'just for Leon' with Leon's mind <br />
being what it was was anyone's guess. <br />
<br />
'What the Hell! I'm Leon! Huh? No! I'm Leon! I'm human! I'm a leoman! I'm a love doll! A love <br />
doll! I really love Leona! I hope we're together forever!' <br />
<br />
'I really love you too Leon-tiger.' The other love doll mentally giggled back at her own joke <br />
calling the plastic/rubber imitation of a leoman a tiger. <br />
<br />
 The two leoman love dolls were in the default position the two closet furries left the two <br />
dolls in when they were away in the seedy apartment they kept in them in so their co-<br />
workers and family wouldn't know and pass judgement on them.  <br />
<br />
Leon's rubber/plastic permanent excited member inside Leona, the two smiling at each <br />
other. <br />
<br />
As afternoon turned to evening a male and female human opened several locks on the <br />
seedy apartment door and opened it revealing just the bed, and the two Leoman love dolls <br />
as they had left them. <br />
<br />
The two closed the door behind them. <br />
<br />
&quot;Aren't they sweet.&quot; Said the woman closet furry. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes dear.&quot; Said the man hugging his partner. &quot;Let's join them.&quot; They laughed at the <br />
fantasy of the two love dolls making out and the two of them then joining them for a <br />
foursome.  The couple stripped off their clothes and climbed onto the bed. <br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
The game would not, could not, dared not, even with only instinct, to touch, harm or <br />
interfere with Marie-Eliza, for it saw her as it's creator, it's master, it's MOTHER, for Marie-<br />
Eliza was after all, the idealized version of how the delusional Kurse had seen herself. <br />
<br />
And she felt every turn of the game used, and she knew a use of the cascade effect... which <br />
should have been impossible since the cascade effect and the game existed separately and <br />
independently from each other. She knew what Transform was gone, but figured Penny <br />
would sooner than later find out by fate and undo the change with her power... but then <br />
she felt the change happen to the punk. <br />
<br />
'This is not good at all.' Marie-Eliza thought. 'Best to make sure this doesn't result in a <br />
planet full of latex love dolls...' While she accepted the possibility the leoman cascade <br />
could result in a planet full of lion people being humane to each other, she knew no sane <br />
person would concede a world full of still love dolls would be a good thing! <br />
<br />
Creating an avatar of herself, transparent, only with a fraction of her real power, she <br />
continued to tell the tale without missing a beat of how Marie and her friends recovered <br />
while the witches created their fortress to protect their one remaining truly loved one and <br />
their small army of familiars. <br />
<br />
Her avatar left the world within mirrors, and became a mass of living solid glass. She <br />
looked at her naked body, now devoid of the black and red dress and blond fur, and now <br />
only indestructible transparent glass remained.  She let her senses guide her to the bug <br />
within the game that HAD to be fixed before it resulted in another disaster. 'Not this time. <br />
No snowflake is going to cause an avalanche THIS time!' <br />
<br />
Madam Serenity sensed a turn of the game had been used. 'It never ends.' She sighed, <br />
there would always be someone. Which made the need to fix this mess of a game even <br />
more so!  Just because she had been cursed to be never be effected by ANY transformation <br />
EVER didn't mean she was going to sit on her rear ever to let this curse run around like <br />
mad. <br />
<br />
And her sense was silently different now, it was like a veil was gone. He could sense a turn <br />
had been used. And she could almost -feel- where the game was... she couldn't pin down <br />
a street address, but she could swear she could almost feel where it was and almost who <br />
and what, -almost-. 'Is it because the mind of the game is gone? And it now can't shield <br />
itself from me? Maybe.' <br />
<br />
She excused herself from the now mutated half-ape men brothers along with Judas the <br />
descendant of a witch's familiar and took a few samplings of the cure along with her just to <br />
be on the safe side (and made sure to memorize the prayer to destroy the curse). <br />
<br />
It would be in the most rundown part of town. Thankfully she was a legal and registered <br />
gun owner and had two life times worth of experience in self defense. <br />
<br />
She found a naked humanoid glass wolf pup waiting outside a door leading to a one room <br />
apartment. <br />
<br />
&quot;You're not any of Julie and Frank's children.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No I'm not. Your safe because your curse precisely says you CAN'T be changed by even the <br />
gods themselves. I'm safe because of how this is mixed with the game... and you could say <br />
I'm the last piece of sanity that existed within the mind of Kurse.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm too tired of all this to be paranoid... and you look like that because?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When Samantha was made Kurse's daughter, and was freed, she needed a replacement, I <br />
was handy nearby... when Kurse was destroyed I was given my mind back... but we both <br />
have something we need to take care of because it becomes a plague.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The leoman cascade?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's benign. And it's no longer truly connected to the curse anyway so the curse <br />
wouldn't effect it. But since THIS is mixed in with the game, so perhaps the cure will work. <br />
You  have some with you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good. I'm Marie-Eliza by the way.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Madam Serenity. Alchemist. PI. Fortune teller. And former cop.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Nice to meet you.&quot; Marie-Eliza gestured at the locks on the door and they became undone <br />
and with another gesture opened the door.</p>
