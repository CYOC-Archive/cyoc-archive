<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The memory of your frightful flight from the fairy queen was fresh in your mind. You thought that the fairy queen was being genuine when you first met her and look where that got you. From fairy tales and other fiction, you knew of their impish sense of humor. You should know better, you have no way to know of his credibility save for one instance, which he had revealed to be one of political spite. You try to remember any details about fairies that might help your situation. As you focus, you remember a commonality that most magical beings shared: a strong penchant for games. Perhaps you could offer a game, one that you could excel in, but still give the illusion of being at disadvantage. But could you really con a century-old being? There&#39;s only one way to find out...<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps I could offer something more interesting than a simple acceptance.&quot; you suggest, hoping that Nym will take the bait.<br />
This earned an eyebrow raise from Nym. &quot;You have my interest. Nothing unreasonable, I hope?&quot; he stated.<br />
You shook your head, &quot;Nothing of the sort. I was wondering if you&#39;d be willing to wager on a game of sorts.&quot;<br />
Nym folded his arms again, his mouth frowning slightly. &quot;And what exactly do I have to gain from a game. After all, you are in my house right now.<br />
You felt a wave of fear run through you; he called your bluff and you have nothing to retort with. He has no concern with human ways; he has been around for many years. You have no information he could want. The only thing you have to offer is... yourself.<br />
<br />
&quot;I assume all your maids are simply constructs, beings come to life with magic?&quot; you venture, hoping that your hunch is correct.<br />
Nym smiled and dismissed your conjecture with a wave of his hand. &quot;Of course, what need have I of actual servants?  They don&#39;t disagree and cannot directly disobey me.&quot; He ran a hand through his hair. &quot;I happen to take pride on the realness that my maids offer. No one would be able to tell them apart from a real human.&quot;<br />
<br />
You grin as you see your opening. &quot;And this is where I come in. What I can offer to you is not to simply be another servant among your many maid dolls. Rather, I would be an obedient follower that is still able to provide opinions, and a break from the monotony.&quot; In a softer tone, you continued. &quot;It must be hard being a top political leader. There must not be many people to trusted.&quot; You take a moment to give a warm smile to Nym, despite the apprehension you  felt towards him. &quot;I&#39;m only a human, no magic to wield to threaten you.&quot; You gestured around at the grand hall. &quot;This world is so much more exciting than my own. I get to have experiences I would never have dreamed of. You could be like a mentor for me, and in turn, I could be someone you can trust and depend on, another person to bounce ideas off of.&quot;<br />
<br />
As you looked back at Nym, he seemed oddly moved by your speech. You decided to lay the game out. &quot;My proposed game is a hide-and-seek game. You give me a half hour head start to situate myself. Your mansion must be large so let&#39;s say I hide for a total of 3 days. If I remain hidden all 3 days, you allow me to leave and be free from all fairy business. If you catch me, I will become your loyal servant until you deem fit to remove me from my post. Does this sound fair?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nym clasped his hands together before snapping his fingers. You felt a surge of magic in the air before a large parchment was summoned before you and Nym onto a table. The terms that you set were written upon at the top of the paper and a series of bullet points were placed underneath. &quot;Fairies, while whimsical and prone to carry out their desires, we are also a people of order.&quot; Nym sneaked in a serious, if not reverent tone. &quot;A Pact represents an unbreakable contract between two people that is only enforced if both parties willingly agree free to the terms, while being free from all magical influence. If someone breaks the Pact, the very essence of magic is unleashed upon them.&quot; He turned to face you and offered a smile. &quot;This way we can ensure that no foul play occurs.&quot; He gestured to the bullet points underneath your rules. &quot;These allow for additional clauses to be set. Traditionally, each person gets an equal amount to add, provided both parties agree. We&#39;ll do it in a 1-2-2-1 fashion. Would you like to choose the first and last or the middle.&quot;<br />
<br />
You gulped. You hadn&#39;t anticipated this turn of events. Maybe this could be your chance to help swing things in your favor. &quot;I&#39;ll choose first. The first clause is that you will be restricted from preforming any fairy magic during the duration of this event. I&#39;d like to keep things on an even playing field.&quot; Nym nodded solemnly, as if he had been expecting something like this. &quot;Fair enough. My first amendment will be to restore your body to that of a 16-year-old male. I did say that I would return you to male, did I not?&quot; You gritted your teeth in frustration. His supposed generosity was taking away your size advantage. You froze as he delivered is second. &quot;My mansion is a rather large place and even I am not familiar with all of the floors. At the height of every 8th hour, your location will be made known unto me. This will ensure that you and I will have to remain moving constantly.&quot; He smirked as his ploy had seem to catch me off guard, which it very much did. You struggled to think of any advantages you could press or any you needed to take away to stand a chance. Suddenly, you became very grateful that you remembered a crucial detail. <br />
&quot;All right, my final clause will be that you shall be disconnected from any help from your maids. They may still attend to their various duties, but they will be unable to communicate to you in anyways that could allude to my location.&quot; Nym gave another respectful nod, and you were unsure if that signified if he knew you would say that. You suddenly felt nervous that you played into his hands. <br />
To your astonishment, the words each of you spoke were printed upon the parchment. All that was left was to sign our names. As Nym eloquently signed his, you suddenly felt a pang of loneliness as you realized you couldn&#39;t remember yours. Nym seemed to notice your hesitation. &quot;Elen&quot; he spoke softly. You faced him as he continued, &quot;It means &#39;fire&#39; in our tongue. You seem to have a passion and a fire beneath you and I respect that.&quot; Elen. You liked the way it sounded inside your head and decided it was as good as any name. After you signed your new name, the parchment burst alight with many colors before hovering to float in the upper ceiling of the room. <br />
Nym glanced over at a clock on the walls, reading the faerie timepiece. &quot;We have been talking for quite awhile. How about we start in 15 minutes? This would signify 12 AM for a human and will allow for a steady measurement of how much time has elapsed. <br />
<br />
As the time neared the end, Nym called out to you, &quot;Would you be so kind to remove your maid outfit and doll skin? I have a spare mannequin in one of my rooms and I would much prefer to complete the set I paid for.&quot;<br />
A bit embarrassed, you undressed before him and anxiously awaited the time for when you would grow into a male again. When there were 30 seconds remaining for the start, you were given a pair of male underwear. &quot;At least have some decency. You think I would&#39;ve let you galavant through my house with your penis swinging about you?&quot; You chuckled and accepted the gift. Nym then looked at your face, &quot;Whatever the outcome, I must thank you for providing such a thrilling experience.<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
The timer had started and your raced through the great hall doorway, tearing through the hallway as your body began to change into a teenage male. As you neared a crossroads consisting of 4 hallways and a set of stairs leading up and down, you elected to choose...</p>
