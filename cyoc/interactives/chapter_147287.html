<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I am secretly wanting to be younger again. There is such magic, but it’s only temporary and you require to STAY in a daycare for the time being.<br />
<br />
With my world, I can be any age I want, and everyone would act like I’ve always been that young. I started off being 8, then slowly getting younger until I reached half a year old, where both of my parents never took their sights off me. <br />
<br />
If I want full care, I would just be less than a year old. When I want to have fun, I become between the ages of 1 1/2 and 5. Any older than that and it’s just boring. Who would want to go to school in another universe where time is different.<br />
<br />
If I’m the ages between a newborn and 5, I don’t have to worry about school that much. If I was 5 I’d have to worry about kindergarten but let’s stay that doesn’t exist anymore in my world. It is replaced along with pre-k with a daycare system that helps kids become potty trained.<br />
<br />
The spell also works when my stress is overwhelming. Let’s say my stress is in a glass cup, and my spell is a paper towel holding the cup. The second it overflows, my spell activates. It deactivated in this way when I am not stressed anymore.<br />
<br />
Now that I am done explaining my world and such, let’s begin with the actual story. <br />
<br />
It was 9 o’clock, both of my parents looked at me which was “goodnight” for me now. I turned off my room light and got in bed. The second I closed my eyes I activated the spell, and transported myself to the other world.<br />
<br />
I awoke in a bed with walls and ceiling. It was very hard to figure out what kind of design it was, since I was practically trapped in it with what ever blanket I was tucked in with. I struggled and struggled, but the blanket didn’t move one inch. <br />
<br />
Finally, one of my parents came in. It was this dude with a sad excuse for a beard walking in, calling me “bud” and such. He picks me up and moves me to the changing table. I turn towards my bed, and it’s a boat. <br />
<br />
I had my diaper changed, and was sat on the floor and had my hands held. “Come on buddy let’s try walking today!” He eagerly told me. I wasn’t sure how old I was, and these mixed signals of being old enough for a boat bed, but not old enough to walk is confusing me. <br />
<br />
I went along with it, walking as my father held my hands. Surprisingly enough, this was very difficult. My legs felt like I did over 500 squats a day for 7 days straight. <br />
<br />
After reaching the door, he let go of my hands and cheered. Not having a good balance on my feet, I fell, but I didn’t care. I was too busy making sure he knows I am happy I walked.<br />
<br />
“Alright bud, let’s hurry downstairs before breakfast is eaten up.” He carries me downstairs, where two women are sitting down drinking coffee. They both looked the same, so it was hard to figure out which one was my mom.<br />
<br />
My dad kissed both of them good morning, but only added honey to one of them. It was the better looking blond woman in a suit. They were both in a suit, but one of them looked like she spent time on her looks. <br />
<br />
I was put in a high chair and was given mashed up pancakes and bacon for breakfast. As I ate, I listened to their conversations. <br />
<br />
Based on what I’m seeing and what my family is saying, I am a 2 year old boy with leg problems that were fixed merely months ago. I have a mom and an aunt who both work in some top business office. My dad is a stay at home mom, and apparently my uncle became a porn star. It was an interesting world I came into.<br />
<br />
My mother and aunt kissed me goodbye, and my father cleaned me up from the syrup disaster I created on me. He got the basic parts off, but decided I needed a bath with syrup all over my body. <br />
<br />
My father ran a bubble bath and laid me in it. He hummed to some song while he scrubbed me clean. He also gathered up some bubbles and started shaping them on my head. When he was finished, he showed me a mirror that had me with just a pile of soap on my head. He probably expected me to laugh, so I tried my best and pretended to be interested. He washed me from any soap I had, and got me out of the tub. <br />
<br />
After drying me up, I got diapered and was left with just that. He didn’t want me to get too hot, or slip on the floor with socks on. I complained, since I wasn’t used to being shirtless just yet, and he still doesn’t give me a shirt. Instead, he takes off his shirt and insist I “be more like daddy” if this was going to make me feel better, it wasn’t by now. His body is the type of the lovable man who also has kids in some movie for 35 year old women. His 6 pack amazed me, even while having a kid to look after. I was going to keep the complaints going, but I was afraid of what he was packing underneath his pants.<br />
<br />
He picked me up and blew on my stomach, making me laugh. He set me down, and held my hands down the hall and back into the kitchen, where I was sat in the high chair facing him. “Daddy has to do dishes bud, so could you please be a good boy and wait for me?” I nodded my head and started playing with my fingers. <br />
<br />
To my surprise, it was very entertaining having my 10 fingers move around as if I was playing some kind of game with them. It was like they were battling, and the left hand barely one by a pinky.<br />
<br />
My dad got finished with the dishes and took me to the living room, where he turned on the tv to some channel about a child’s development. It had songs of everything. From learning ABCs to counting, I had to suffer from this. <br />
<br />
You may be wondering why I don’t choose to just not watch it. Why wouldn’t you started acting differently than what the family is used to, possibly risking a doctor’s visit. I don’t know if they actually stick a thermometer in your ass, and I don’t plan to know.<br />
<br />
After a ton of songs of me staring blankly at my father singing along, he decided to walk in the kitchen. As curious as I am, I started to move in there. I attempted to walk, but that led to me falling face first onto the tile floor. The main was mostly in my nose, but I felt fine. <br />
<br />
Apparently he was fixing lunch, and was surprised I managed to make it into the kitchen. <br />
<br />
The rest of the day went by like any other for a toddler. We ate, I got my diaper changed, we relaxed, mom got home, we had dinner, and I was changed into a fresh diaper and new pajamas.<br />
<br />
This life was nice, but not good enough for me. I was already ok involving stress and such, so I decided to go back to the real world.<br />
<br />
Waking up, I realized it was merely 8 minutes since I had fallen asleep. I laid back in my bed and drifted back to sleep, but this time I chose to just sleep<br />
<br />
In the morning...</p>
