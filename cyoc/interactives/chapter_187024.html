<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kade anxiously walked down the stairs, dreading what his mother would say once she saw him like this. What would the rest of his family think? That&#39;d he&#39;d just mutated? It certainly wasn&#39;t every day your son spontaneously transformed into a fat assed skunk boy with a big dick and balls. His junk still seemed to jiggle with each step as he hesitantly approached his family&#39;s kitchen. <br />
<br />
Biting his lip, he peeked around the corner, hiding out of sight, hoping they wouldn&#39;t see him. Only when he turned, he was shocked by what he saw. Another anthro skunk, taller and chubbier than he was, with a huge butt that seemed even bigger than his own, and an enormous cock, proudly on display. It bounced between their legs as they seemed to be making meals for breakfast. Their tail bounced behind them as they worked. And, perhaps most strangely, the only article of clothing they wore was his mother&#39;s pink apron. Soon they turned and saw him, and smiled, &quot;Oh there you are Kade, your lunch is ready!&quot; He couldn&#39;t believe it. &quot;M-Mom?!&quot; He yelped out as &#39;she&#39; giggled, &quot;Well of course silly. Who else would be making your food for you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;She&#39; spoke with a falsetto, with a slight gay, stereotypical lisp to &#39;her&#39; voice. It was like it was trying to do an impression of his mother despite still being obviously male. How did he ever mistake that voice for his mother&#39;s? But still, it was hard for him to grasp that this fat, apparently male skunk now WAS his mother. He stepped further into the kitchen, still weirded out, before he saw the rest of his family getting ready to start the day. At least, ge thought they were supposed to be his family, except now they were all skunk. All MALE skunks it seemed like.<br />
<br />
Where his father normally sat was a tall and massively fat anthro skunk, easily 600 lbs, wearing an ill-fitting version of father&#39;s shirt, tie, and glasses, but not his pants. His father&#39;s titanic dick and melon sized scrote dangled between his legs, which Kade almost mistook for a third leg. He didn&#39;t seem to mind it out, casually sipping his morning coffee as he read the newspaper. Kade had seen him do this many times when he was a smaller, merely dad-boded human man, not as a morbidly obese skunk with a pendulous cock. &quot;Morning son, how are ya?&quot; He said, nodding in Kade&#39;s direction as a sort of morning acknowledgement he&#39;d normally give him.<br />
<br />
On the opposite side across from his father was Kade older sister Lizzie, well ex-sister now. He remembered her as being gorgeous. Beautiful, busty, blond, always obsessed with her appearance. But now she apparently was a skunk only slightly thinner than his father currently seemed to be. While his sister was very attractive as a woman, he didn&#39;t think she was very pretty as a skunk. Slobber dripped down a bloated lower lip from his maw. His forehead jutted out, almost like a caveman&#39;s. He just looked ratty and filthy. &#39;She&#39; certainly still had a rack, but now they were enormous moobs. He seemed more modest than Kade&#39;s mother and father, wearing a tight, sweat-stained crop top that barely fit over his mantits and a pair of greasy short-shorts which squeezed their own massive cock, only a bit bigger than Kade&#39;s, still leaving little to the imagination, especially with their fly down. Kade wondered why they didn&#39;t just go nude at that point. His fur seemed the most matted of the family&#39;s, and was especially bushy around his pits and crotch. It seemed he was a hyper masculine stereotype to his sister&#39;s feminine one. Much like his sister normally did, he sat at the table, texting on his phone absentmindedly, not really paying attention, and occasionally stopping to take selfies. He wondered if he had a boyfriend like his sister did too.<br />
<br />
Sitting on the other side of his father were where the twins, Penny and Peter, used to sit. Now there were now two chubby skunks with big, fluffy tails, cheerfully giggling at each other. Both seemed dressed a bit younger than what they were. The one, he guessed, was Pete, wore a striped baby blue shirt that hugged his pudgy, furry body, with the words &quot;Lil&#39; Stinker&quot; emblazoned on it. His younger &#39;sister&#39; wore a pink one covered in glitter, and the words &quot;Cute Like Mommy, Smelly Like Daddy&quot; on his, along with a bow on his head, which his sister frequently wore. Both seemed to be boys. He was shocked upon noticing they didn&#39;t wear anything else underneath either, seeing their own flaccid puds over the edge of their seats, which seemed to be as big as his USED to be. Both 8-year-olds looked at him as he walked in. &quot;Good morning big bro.&quot; They cheerfully said in unison. Kade awkwardly waved towards them, trying not to seem weirded out by the sight. <br />
<br />
The worst thing was the smell. He hadn&#39;t noticed it before either somehow, but the entire kitchen stunk! It stunk like, like... well, a family of skunks. It was strange. It reeked and he knew he should be disgusted, yet there was something oddly familiar about the scent, even comforting. &quot;Oh, honey, your breakfast is on the table. The school bus will be in here in 30 minutes.&quot; His &#39;mother&#39; reminded him, as he returned to his cooking. Kade scratched his head in confusion, still unsure how his family became skunks overnight, or why they didn&#39;t seem to notice anything was out of the ordinary. He still was hungry though, and he guessed the smell wasn&#39;t so intolerable he couldn&#39;t eat around it. If he was still human though, he figured he would be pretty sick from the stench.<br />
<br />
He walked behind his father&#39;s chair, trying to be cool, when he heard a hissing sound as a blast of warm, noxious air and fluid hit his face. It was significantly more revolting than how the rest of the house smelled. It took him a few seconds to register what had happened, and when he did, he recoiled, &quot;Dad! Did you just skunk me?!&quot; His father stifled a chuckle, while he could hear his siblings cackle as Kade tried to wipe the skunk spray off of him, spluttering and gagging, &quot;That&#39;ll wake you up, eh?&quot; Kade glared at him as he got up to his feet, &quot;Aw come on son, you have to admit that was good. Normally you&#39;d be laughing! Get up on the wrong side of the bed today?&quot; Kade was pretty annoyed by it. He almost wanted to get back at him for his prank.</p>
