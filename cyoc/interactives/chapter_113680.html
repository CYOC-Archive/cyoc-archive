<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Jesse entered his neighborhood, things weren&#39;t right. There were cars stopped in the street. Sex sounds came from everywhere. People that weren&#39;t interested in anything but sex.<br />
<br />
Jesse came to a man jerking off. Jesse watched as the man busted a thick nut onto the street. The guy shook, wiped the cum from his dick, and started jerking again. This was bad.<br />
<br />
Jesse could smell Andy. It was Andy causing this. And Jesse was supposed to stop him but he didn&#39;t know how. Great.<br />
<br />
Jesse watched as a couple fucked on the hood of a Toyota. Jesse had never seen them before. The man was old, elderly. The girl was young. Probably in her early twenties. The old guy pumping away with his raging hard-on. His face red and veins sticking out. It was only a matter of time before the old guy stroked out.<br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t get any better as Jesse got closer to his house. Neighbors fucking in their yards but for some it wasn&#39;t even with their spouses. Others that weren&#39;t gay, were now engaged in gay sex. Gay neighbors were in the middle of straight sex. Everyone was desperate.<br />
<br />
Jesse made it to his house but it appeared empty. He went room to room but nothing. Than he went into Andy&#39;s room. Karen was still lying on the floor. She needed medical attention. No use in calling an ambulance, they wouldn&#39;t make it without fucking.<br />
<br />
Jesse now felt his cock rise up in his pants. Suddenly, his pants were too tight. He had to get them off. As he pulled off his underwear a huge monster came up to great him. His massive dick was harder and standing up firmer than a cock that big had a natural right to. This was really affecting him.<br />
<br />
He looked down at Karen. One quick fuck would be OK to relieve some pressure. Yes, that was it. Than Andy.<br />
<br />
No. If he started he wouldn&#39;t stop until he was like the others. Jesse willed himself to turn around and leave the house. He looked around and noticed that the heaviest concentration was coming from next door. He made his way over.<br />
<br />
He pushed the screen door open and stopped stunned by the site. Two guys were crashed on the floor. One&#39;s dick was in the others mouth. They were both dehydrated and unconscious. More people littered the room. Some were still fucking even after losing consciousness.<br />
<br />
Jesse spotted Andy. He was on the couch with three women. Two were passed out. The black mail lady was the only one awake. She was riding Andy&#39;s cock but slowly as she appeared to be about to faint. With effort Andy raised up his head and looked at his brother. Andy wasn&#39;t happy, evil, or alright. He was in pain.<br />
<br />
Jesse walked up and lifted the girl off his brothers dick. She protested but weakly. Sweat poured from Andy&#39;s head as he laid there unable to move. His muscles worn out from continuous sex.<br />
<br />
Jesse&#39;s dick swelled up more. It felt like it was going to pop. He had to get off and now. Was that it? Was that what he had to do? It was the only thing he could do, just as Stephan said.<br />
<br />
Jesse fought a strong urge to climb on Andy&#39;s still swollen member. That seemed like the wrong thing. Instead he grabbed his little brother&#39;s legs and pulled his ass upward. Jesse spit on his hand and lubbed up his cock. Slowly he slid it into Andy.<br />
<br />
Andy now reacted by trying to pull his ass away from Jesse. Andy&#39;s eyes were so wide. &quot;Ouch. You&#39;re huge. Bigger than me. Who are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Look me in the eye,&quot; Jesse grunted as he worked his cock in and out of Andy&#39;s tight ass.<br />
<br />
Andy looked closely at him. &quot;Jesse? How?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Madame Illusia. She&#39;s helping me fix this. Turns out you were being a dick thanks to your new cock. So, you got cursed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She never said that would happen.&quot; Andy clinched as Jesse went in deep.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s magic. You never know what its gonna do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jesse couldn&#39;t stand the pressure any more. He knew this would hurt Andy but he couldn&#39;t help it. Jesse started pounding Andy&#39;s ass like his cock was a jackhammer. Andy tensed and grunted. Andy&#39;s arm flailing for something to grab. Andy&#39;s huge cock bounce up and down. It made a fleshy smacking whenever it hit Jesse.<br />
<br />
Than Jesse felt a feeling of helpless, needful thrusting. Cum started to leak out of his cock. Then orgasm. Spurt after spurt of thick cum shot inside Andy. Jesse grabbed Andy&#39;s hips and rode the orgasm out. Jesse felt darkness creeping over his vision as he nearly passed out.<br />
<br />
Jesse pulled his cock from his brother&#39;s ass and cum dripped from the eye of his cock and from Andy&#39;s asshole. Jesse gripped his thumb and index finger at the base of his cock and slid them upward, milking all the sperm from his dick. The jizz dripped to the floor in a splat.<br />
<br />
Was it over?<br />
<br />
Jesse watched as Andy&#39;s cock shrank. Both from becoming flaccid and also from magic. The same with Andy&#39;s body. But Jesse noticed that while smaller he still had at least seven inches. Not bad for a thirteen year old. Andy&#39;s body was also larger and more toned than his original body had been.<br />
<br />
Everyone around them started getting up and walking out as though nothing had happened. They didn&#39;t speak or even acknowledge each other. Jesse grabbed Andy and they went home before anyone woke up from there stupor.<br />
<br />
As they crashed at home on there couch. Jesse only had one thought.<br />
<br />
I hate magic.</p>
