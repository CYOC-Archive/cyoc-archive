<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Andrew takes the 200$ from his father, grabs his keys, and walks out to his car. He gets in the car, noticing how much more the car sags from his weight. Andrew has to adjust his seat back to make room for his much larger body. He looks at himself in the mirror. He has a slight shadow all over his face, even though he had just shaved. It seemed that Andrew would always have a permanent shadow now. His shirt looked painted on, with a huge thatch of chest dark chest hair poking out of the collar. his biceps were pushing away the shirt immensely, likely stretching the threads permanently. His jeans, likewise, were very, very tight. You could see a thick snake shaped bulge down the his left leg, leaving very little to the imagination. It had to be at least 7 or 8 inches now, and it was totally soft. &quot;This is crazy&quot;, he says to himself, in his deep baritone voice. He puts the keys into the ignition and turns over his car. He pulls out of the drive way.<br />
<br />
Andrew was thinking about the new clothes he would buy at the mall, and what size his new body would be, when an idea popped into his head; he was driving right past his friend Eric&#39;s house on the way to the mall. Eric was 18 and had just graduated from his school, so Andrew knew Eric would be home. His parent&#39;s would be at work today, too. Andrew put on his blinker as he made the decision to show off his new body to his friend.<br />
<br />
Andrew pulled into the drive way and texted Eric. He didn&#39;t call as his voice was tremendously more deep than it was the day before. &quot;Hey, it&#39;s Andrew. I&#39;m in your driveway. Come let me in. Also, don&#39;t freak out about anything... different&quot;.<br />
<br />
A few seconds later, Eric opened the front door. Andrew stepped out of his car and Eric&#39;s eyes bulged out of his head; &quot;Andrew? Is that you?&quot;. &quot;Yeah Eric, it&#39;s a long story. Let&#39;s go up to your room and I can explain everything&quot;.<br />
<br />
Andrew sat on the floor in Eric&#39;s room as he told the whole story, about the ointment, about his dad, about waking up with this new body. &quot;That&#39;s insane, dude? I would think you were nuts if you were sitting in front of me with all those new muscles and hair!&quot;. &quot;Yeah, it&#39;s pretty wild&quot;, Andrew said. &quot;I had a big beard and everything this morning. My dad had to teach me how to shave. He sent me out to buy some new clothes. These ones were the biggest I had and they are way too small on me&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
Eric was still in shock and disbelief, but he was also very curious about what had happened to his friend. &quot;How much do you weigh now?&quot;, Eric asked. &quot;I am about 200 lbs, I think&quot;. Andrew looked at his shirt, and it seemed to have gotten even tighter since he left his house. His chest and shoulders seemed a little bit broader. &quot;Maybe a bit more&quot;, he added. &quot;Dude, look at all that muscle you now have!&quot;, Eric said, as he grabbed one of Andrew&#39;s biceps. &quot;Geez, your huge!&quot;, Eric continued. Eric&#39;s hand, gripping the bicep, felt some thick hairs. The very thick covering on Andrew&#39;s forearms continued a bit up his upper arms. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, Andrew, take off your shirt. I want to see the new you&quot;, Eric said. Andrew was a bit embarrassed, as he still didn&#39;t know what to think about his copious body hair, but he complied. It took some effort for Andrew to wiggle the incredibly tight shirt off of his massive torse, but it was soon crumpled on the floor. &quot;Holy shit, dude!&quot;, Eric said excitedly. &quot;You are one hairy dude, Andrew&quot;, he said, gesturing to the rug of chest hair he now sported. The hairs were thick and curled together, making quite a jungle. The chest hairs went all the way to the base of his neck and spread out almost to each armpit, where, likewise, a large bush of brown hair stuck out from. Andrew rubbed his chest hair; &quot;Yeah, I guess I am. It still feels weird and itchy&quot;. &quot;I&#39;ll bet. And look at your muscles! You look like a defensive lineman on the football team! How much do you think you can bench now?&quot;. &quot;Umm, I&#39;m not quite sure. I haven&#39;t really benched before&quot;.<br />
<br />
As Eric examined the changes, Andrew lifted up his arm and scratched his head. Doing so exposed the huge tuft of armpit hair he now sported. &quot;Whoa, man!&quot;, Eric began. &quot;You have got some pretty strong BO going on, dude. You stink!&quot;. Andrew went bright red. He leaned down and sniffed under his arm; yup, thats some bad BO. &quot;Oh man, sorry, I didn&#39;t even notice. I have never needed deodorant before. I don&#39;t even have any at my home. Looks like I need to pick some up for this body&quot;.<br />
<br />
Eric laughed it off. &quot;It&#39;s okay dude, just don&#39;t stink up my room too bad&quot;. Eric&#39;s eyes trailed down Andrew&#39;s sweaty, hairy torso and saw the huge snake down one of Andrew&#39;s pant legs. &quot;Wow! What is that like? Your huge now&quot;. Andrew went red again, and was at a loss for words. &quot;Umm, its, cool, I guess. A lot bigger than my old one&quot;. &quot;I bet!&quot;, Eric replied with a smirk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Andrew, I have a question for you. Do you have any more of that ointment. You know, in case I wanted to try it out?&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew thought for a moment, and then pulled out the tube of ointment from his pocket. He thought about it. Should he give it to Eric?</p>
