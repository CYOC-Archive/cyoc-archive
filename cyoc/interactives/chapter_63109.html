<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Now get over here, so I can see how big bro looks on you, Rick,&quot; Sarah ordered. She was already thinking <br />
about how she would improve Rick with the Chronivac when he got there.<br />
<br />
There was a knock at the door. &quot;Hey, Jeff, we're going out tonight.  Remember, you're in charge, make sure <br />
Sarah eats a proper meal, and doesn't go out with that awful Rick,&quot; said their father.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff's in the bathroom,&quot; Sarah answered, &quot;I promise I won't leave the house or at least the yard tonight, <br />
pops.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine, Sarah. And don't call me pops - it makes me sound so old,&quot; James said with a sigh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honey, we'll be late!&quot; shouted his wife from downstairs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, what time will you be home, pop-papa?&quot; Sarah asked opening the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Around midnight, if I am lucky. Dinner and one of those godawful 3 hour art movies followed by a lecture. Now <br />
don't wait up.  And don't have that Rick boy over here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not even with Jeff in the same room with us?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, alright, you can have that Rick over with Jeff in the same room.  But honey why don't you get a nice <br />
normal guy like that quarterback Steve Burns from across the street?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He's gay, papa,&quot; she said testily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really. Sorry, hon. It's just I'm sure you can do better than Rick.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe?&quot; she said noncommittally as she looked over at the Chronivac.<br />
<br />
She heard the door close downstairs and the car start up and drive off.<br />
<br />
Then she aimed the Chronivac transmitter out the front window. There was that stuck up Steve Burns shirtless <br />
in his garage lifting weights. Time to make her statement true. She adjusted the controls.<br />
<br />
&quot;SUBJECT TWO LOCKED&quot; chimed the machine.  &quot;Male, age 18, weight 187, height 6'3&quot;, sexual orientation: 85% <br />
Straight, Leadership: Dominant. Penis size..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;96% Gay, Leadership: Submissive, Penis size 3 inches erect,&quot; she typed wickedly.  She set the awareness so <br />
everyone would think it was normal and cursed herself for not selecting that setting for Jeff.<br />
<br />
She heard the putt putt of Rick's beater car coming down the street. She aimed the Chronivac down at him as he <br />
pulled into her driveway. <br />
<br />
Rick froze.  He couldn't move.  He felt his seat shifting beneath him. He was now sitting in a bucket seat in <br />
a 2011 BMW series 5 convertible. It had to be Sarah. He blinked, and then he noticed his clothing was fitting <br />
more tightly. He had muscles. The machine chimed, and Rick could move.<br />
<br />
He was happy and angry at the same time.  Sarah should have asked him before changing him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Rick, how's it hanging!&quot; said Steve Burns.  He had literally run across the street to greet Rick.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Steve.  It's hanging fine,&quot; he said looking down and conscious of how Jeff made his bulge stand out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool. You look like you've been working out, Rick.  If you'd like to come over and work out with me sometime, <br />
I've got my own hot tub out back and a sauna in the basement,&quot; Steve said staring at Rick's bulge and licking <br />
his lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, maybe sometime. Right now, Sarah is expecting me,&quot; Rick said pulling free from Steven's overly friendly <br />
grip.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, Sarah,&quot; Steve said in a disappointed tone, &quot;Say hi to her for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Sarah, what's with Steve Burns?  I swear he was checking me out,&quot; Rick said as he entered the house.  He <br />
was so freaked that he forgot to be mad at Sarah.  Then he saw his reflection in the mirror, and asked, &quot;Did <br />
you Chronivac me so that everybody is attracted to me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You wish!&quot; laughed Sarah, &quot;No, Steve's gay, he always has been.  At least that's what everyone in town is <br />
supposed to think except for me. So why didn't you think Steve Burns was gay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, maybe because you modified me?&quot; Rick said pointing at his buff physique.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, I did you after Steven.  This thing has limited range.  I know you're wearing Jeff, so you're part of <br />
Jeff's modification, so you remain aware. Cool.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you thinking?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Never you mind. My folks are going to be happy with you, and I think you will be too when I'm through with <br />
you,&quot; Sarah said as she started to type on the keyboard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wa-&quot; Rick started to say, but he was frozen again.  The Chronivac was locked on him and modifying him in ways <br />
he couldn't imagine. He winced as his cock grew bigger with a slight hook.  His piercings hurt. He moaned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yeah, got to adjust your piercings too, hon,&quot; Sarah muttered.  &quot;You need some new tats too.  I'm going to <br />
make you a platinum record selling artist...well, maybe not but on your way to being.  You're recordings will <br />
be totally viral.  Everyone in town will download them, and that should start a national - no international <br />
trend. And we mustn't forget Steven.  Look what the gays did for Lady Gaga.  Let's make your sexual preference <br />
a flexible range. Keep them guessing, but you can only cum in me.  And let's make your hair a bit more wavy, <br />
your legs less hairy and chest hairier, and...&quot;<br />
<br />
Then the phone rang.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hon, it's papa.  I need to talk to Jeff. Put him on the phone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, he's in the bathroom, papa,&quot; Sarah lied.<br />
<br />
&quot;He was in there when we left, is he sick?  Maybe we should come home early if he's not well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll get him,&quot; she said muting the phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Strip, Rick.  I need Jeff to talk to papa before he resumes his new life's work.&quot;<br />
<br />
She shrank Rick's manhood to kiddie size and the cock ring fell to the floor with a thud. Rick jumped as it <br />
hit his right toe. <br />
<br />
&quot;Damn, it's broken!&quot;<br />
<br />
A few keystrokes and his toe was no longer broken.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, Sarah.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sh. Okay, Jeff, behave.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick and Sarah stared as the silver heavy ring turned pinkish and started to grow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, oh, oh, oh,&quot; groaned Jeff as he became human again, &quot;I can't believe you made me his cock ring. I feel so <br />
dirty. You know it was like he fucked me up my ass and out my mouth.  I can still taste him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, forget about it. Talk to pops, and don't say anything out of line or Rick's going to have a new butt <br />
plug named Jeff, and you'll be going in head first,&quot; Sarah warned handing her naked trembling brother the <br />
cordless phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, pa, how's it going?  Movie any good?&quot; Jeff asked nervously.  Sarah's hand was poised over the enter key.  <br />
He was loathe to imagine what she had typed into the Chronivac, and what she would do to him if he made <br />
trouble.<br />
<br />
&quot;Son, are you okay?  You were in the bathroom when we left and when we called just now.  Are you sick?  Or <br />
constipated?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, papa. I feel completely empty now.  I guess I ate too much fiber, but it's all cleared out now. So why <br />
the call?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, your mother and I saw a poster for that Rick guy's new album, and we guess maybe we were a bit harsh in <br />
our judgment of him.  Tell Sarah that she can have Rick over, but I want you to keep an eye on them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yeah, I'll let Sarah know Rick is now welcome in the house, but I'll keep an eye so he doesn't get too <br />
fresh.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, then. Well, the bell's ringing. Time to go in for this horrendous film.  I don't know why I let your <br />
mother drag me to these things.&quot;<br />
<br />
CLICK.<br />
<br />
&quot;There I did what you wanted, so are you satisfied?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah simply hit the enter key. Jeff's body collapsed on itself and the vibrating dildo butt plug dropped to <br />
the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought you were going to turn him back into the cock ring?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but I wanted to see how he worked as a butt plug first.  Bend over, Rick and spread your cheeks.&quot;</p>
