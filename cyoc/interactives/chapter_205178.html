<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Yuriko sighed, taking a sip of tea as she gazed out the window. The past month had proven to be far more stressful than she would have anticipated.<br />
<br />
After the last attack on the kits, and the discovery that Morgan was alive, Yuriko and the others had found themselves on edge. The kits themselves were safe, whatever Fukushu had done after vanishing with Evan and Morgan, appeared to have worked. Since that time no outside threats to the kits had been noticed. While this should have been viewed as a victory, Yuriko was instead concerned.<br />
<br />
It started the following day when Kari, Aaron, Haley, and Tricia had dropped by. The meeting of old friends was not a joyous one as the Harris clan proceeded to lambast Kellie Pendragon for not informing them of Morgan&#39;s return. Kellie, for her part, had apologized. The guardian of light stating she had only learned recently of Morgan&#39;s return and was concerned that the group would attempt a rescue. Needless to say the group took the news poorly, each viewing Kellie with suspicion. Since that time none had been in contact with Kellie.<br />
<br />
Yuriko now found herself focusing on training Darren. The elderly wizard was still incensed by Kellies omission, yet her responsibilities remained. She would train the Catalyst. Today though she would try to relax.<br />
<br />
Fukushu, Akira, and their families had traveled to the kitsune home, leaving the elderly wizard with a rare quiet day. It was odd for Yuriko, her home had been chaotic since Fukushu&#39;s arrival. The kitsune and his family attempting to adjust to living with old rivals. Raiden it appeared had taken to the idea happily, his parents though were still adjusting. With the house to herself, Yuriko finally found herself surrounded by silence, and missing the noise her houseguests had brought. &quot;Never thought I would miss Fukushu or Abolith.&quot;<br />
<br />
An explosion now rocked Yurikos home, the elderly wizard thrown from her chair. Coughing, she now gazed at the gaping hole in her kitchen wall confused by what had happened. As the dust began to settle she could begin to make out the silhouette of a figure standing in her backyard. Before she could identify them though, she found herself jerked forward, tumbling into the yard to rest before a familiar foe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Evan?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Where is he Yuriko,&quot; Evan growled, the dark wizard now useing his magic to choke Yuriko as he suspended her in front of him. &quot;Where&#39;s Darren!&quot;<br />
<br />
Yuriko gagged, trying to free herself from Evans grasp. Evan was ready, not giving Yuriko a chance to cast a spell as he now slammed her prone body to the ground. He knew better than to give Yuriko a chance to recover. Throughout her lifetime she had developed a reputation of getting out of hopeless situations. If given the opportunity Evan had no doubt Yuriko would do the same here. Instead he now began to batter the woman, useing his magic to assault Yuriko before she could even answer. For Evan this was intentional, he didn&#39;t want answers. He wanted revenge.<br />
<br />
&quot;Evan wait,&quot; Yuriko groaned, her body wracked with pain as Evan once more slammed her into wall, the wizard coughing up blood. Yuriko was dazed, her head spinning. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait,&quot; Evan bellowed, the wizard once more slamming Yuriko to the ground. &quot;Wait for what! Your student put my aunt, YOUR FRIEND, in a coma! Where is he!&quot;<br />
<br />
Yuriko choked, her vision blurry as she tried to focus on the dark wizard. Evan was going to kill her unless she could mount a defense. &quot;Darren help,&quot; she thought.<br />
<br />
A blinding flash of light now illuminated Yuriko&#39;s lawn. Evan now shielded his eyes, releasing Yuriko as he now tried to focus. A malicious grin now began to form as he gazed at the person be had wanted to punish. &quot;There you are.&quot;<br />
<br />
Darren, Steph, and Hannah now stood between Yuriko and Evan, the young teens eyes narrowing as he glared at his teachers attacker. Darren had been hanging out with Stwph and Hannah when a feeling of dread washed over him. He wasn&#39;t sure what it was but he needed to act. Useing his magic he had telelpirted himself and his friends to Yuriko, shocked to find his teacher now bloodied and broken before him. &quot;Ms. Yuriko,&quot; he exclaimed. As he tried to rush to his teachers aid, he was shocked as Evan now launched a fireball, preventing him from moving towards her.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Evan growled. &quot;No kid you don&#39;t get to help her. You made this personal, now I&#39;m going to make you pay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Evan liaten to me,&quot; Darren exclaimed. &quot;I don&#39;t want to fight you. I didn&#39;t know about Morgan, I didn&#39;t want to hurt her. She jumped in front of you to protect you. I&#39;m sorry she&#39;s hurt, I am but I don&#39;t want to fight you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think I care,&quot; Evan scoffed. &quot;You&#39;ve taken everything from me! I was supposed to be the Catalyst! I was the one who was supposed to shape the world! You nearly killing my aunt? Thats just the icing on the cake. Whether you like it or not kid I&#39;m ending you right here and right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Darren sighed. The teen didn&#39;t want this, he had never wanted to fight Evan even after everything the dark wizard had done. When Darren had learned about Morgan Carlson, he had felt guilty. He felt awful about hurting Evan but staring at the dark wizard he understood that unless he stopped him, he would not stop until everyone Darren cared about was dead. Turning to Hannah and Steph, he now asked his friends for help. &quot;Are you guys ready?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know we&#39;re always her for you Darren,&quot; Steph said warmly, the wolf gynoid placing her paw on his shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looking forward to kicking this guys ass,&quot; Hannah smirked, the gynoid monkey teens tail twitching in anticipation. Darren smiled, admiring his friends confidence as he withdrew the Dragons tongue.<br />
<br />
&quot;Its gonna take more than a pair of robots and a magic sword to stop me,&quot; Evan snarled.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Darren said softly. &quot;But thats not what I have in mind.&quot; <br />
<br />
Evan paused, watching as a series of light orbs now began to swirl around Darren and his friends. Curiously he now watched, the orbs spinning around faster before a flash of brilliant light now blinded him. As his vision cleared, Evan gawked at what Darren had become.<br />
<br />
Instead of three individuals, Evan now beheld one. The figure itself looked like Darren but was also completely different. The teenager was now robotic in appearance, Darren&#39;s face completely metallic sporting a set of pointed wolf ears, very much like Stepb. As Evan looked the boy over, he could see his clothing had been transformed. Metal plates like armor and a faux greenish fur positioned where the boys previous clothing had been.<br />
<br />
Darren&#39;s hands were now metallic, more slender than his human hands and appearing very close to what Hannah&#39;s gynoid monkey paws look liked. Finally Even noticed a set of metallic wings now sprouting from Darren&#39;s back, the frames of the wings having a series of jets instead of feathers for propulsion. As Darren exhaled, he now readied the Dragons Tongue, the sword now glowing with a blue light.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell are you,&quot; Evan whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;A combination of us all,&quot; Darren stated, his voice a mixture of all three of them. &quot;I am Legion. I am many and I am one. I&#39;m sorry Evan, but I must stop you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay Legion,&quot; Evan grinned, the dark wizard now preparing a spell. &quot;Lets see what you got.&quot;</p>
