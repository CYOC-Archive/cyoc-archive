<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The night started pretty smoothly, meeting with the other girls in the back to apply makeup, listening to her bitch of a coworker Penny complain about physically every human being not within earshot, and the regular crap coworkers make you put up with. The profession was different but the people varied so little in terms of personality she may as well be yelled at by the senior cook at Phillips Fish Kitchen again.<br />
<br />
Stripping was basically the only freedom Izzy got from the humdrum of her coworkers, pulling her clothes off and spinning around the pole. She was the best one there without a doubt, she could arouse any man with just timing and effort alone. She made the most tips, or at she would have if it weren’t for the usual order. Everyone came to the club for one reason and though she could squeeze a sizeable amount of cash from them with her skills and effort she lacked the absolutely bombastic crowd drawing body that Penny had. With blonde hair, enormous knockers, and a giggle that made her sound like a brainless bimbo Penny always doubled the average pull of any girl in the club even though she had no poise, skill, or talent. She was hot and that was all she had going for her.<br />
<br />
So of course it wasn’t surprising when Izzy wasn’t booked for a private room that night. Even though she drew the attention of everyone there and could tell she turned them on a lot she also had the smallest breasts and thinnest frame. She didn’t have the voluminous curves guys killed for and though she was attractive next to girls like Penny she was plain.<br />
<br />
So she sat in the back room while thundering music filled the air no one bothering to pad out her tips, all she ever got were weird people into childish looks or couples who had to make sure the girl had larger breasts than she did. She was like the leftovers of the club and though she would walk away with second place in terms of tips that night no one ever bothered to book her so she could make more.<br />
<br />
When Kyle entered the back room she was certain he was going to fire her but instead she got called to his office. She walked down the hallway past private rooms and past a bouncer to get to a small lounge with a glass door separating the office behind it. The music was faint here but she could still hear it.<br />
<br />
Kyle pulled out some cash and ran dozens of bills through his fingers before dropping the cash on the table without a word and beginning to undo his tie. Izzy could say no and Kyle would just pull his tie back on, remove the cash from the table, and go find another girl. Judging by his slightly drunk look and the haze of cigarette smoke wafting in the air he’d just had another nasty breakup. He always did this, banging all the strippers in his club until he felt better. Izzy has no idea if she was his first choice, his last, or somewhere in between either way she just shrugged and with a quick unclasp had all her clothes fall to the floor. She’d done this before and after her first time she learned that Kyle was the kind of guy who wanted to get straight to the point. Despite owning a business that entirely depended on drawing the reveal out as long as possible he hated it and had shouted at her to get on with it already. He was nude by this point and slipped a condom on his cock. She waited patiently while he adjusted it and lit a smoke in his mouth before turning on her and with a strong arm pushing her down on the couch. He scratched his chin for a few seconds before inhaling deeply and blowing smoke from his mouth slowly trying to decide what position to take her in. He eventually decided on a classic missionary style and knelt on the couch penetrating her while she wrapped her legs around his torso locking him into place. She didn’t engage in any humping or movements of her own. Kyle liked to call the shots and his shots typically landed allowing Izzy to fall into a relaxed and passive erotic bliss while Kyle worked on her. His dick wasn’t huge by any means but it was sizeable enough to give a lot of pleasure, Kyle also had a lot of practice with sex so he drew the one bang out to a pleasantly long orgasm before they took a break.<br />
<br />
Izzy lay on the couch with a smile on her face, the haze of Kyle’s smoke entering her lungs and being exhaled by her own only for Kyle to inhale it again. It made her tongue piercing tingle while Kyle got a phone call and began to pace in front of her, his meat dancing before him semi-hard. Izzy shut her eyes blissfully unaware that Kyle began to change. His stubble retracted, his lips puckered up, and his voice became feminine while he argued with someone on the phone. His fingers holding his cigarette became daintier while his arms slimmed down to feminine proportions losing that masculine strength they had before. His shoulders caved in, his hair sprouted outwards becoming long and done up in a bun, and his pecks glooped outwards bouncing for a few seconds before forming into sizeable breasts. His waist caved in and his hips widened. His ass bubbled outwards while he swayed his hips back and forth. Thighs expanded, toes shrunk, and finally all his cock grew straps that wrapped around his pelvis while the dick itself stood to attention and became plastic while a vagina formed underneath it. All her body hair fell off and she yelled one last time on the phone before turning back to Izzy.<br />
<br />
“Where were we?” She asked before grabbing Izzy and turning her around so her ass was presented to the air. She lit another cigarette and immediately penetrated Izzy’s privates from the rear while she smoked. Izzy was in bliss and Kyle now felt a small nub teasing the lips of her own vagina rather than getting pleasure from the cock she was thrusting with. Instead she played with her titties and wobbled them back and forth while the haze of smoke set Izzy’s tongue piercing slight causing Kyle’s not so hidden fetish to emerge. She slowly became that fetish as her stomach began to gush outwards while fatty cells increased in numbers. Her teasing to the girls about gaining weight had actually been a hope because ever since she was a child she had been arroused by girls she referred to as “Chunkers” she moaned as her thighs expanded with cellulite, her vagina began to tingle as her arms got larger and lost definition to the lard, and she began to moan as fat collected around her face forming not one, not two, but three chins. It gushed over her gut, her ass and boobs expanding as the clocks trap snapped and Izzy fell forward while cuming.<br />
<br />
“Ahaha!” Kyle laughed as she rose to her feet with some strain, now an overweight woman with sweaty rolls of fat. She felt up her gooey and bouncy skin, it felt like a water balloon. She wanted more and it had all started with Izzy. She darted forward grabbing her employee who was in a blissful daze from the dildo still embedded in her vagina. Kyle locked her fat lips with the stripped and stuck her tongue in her mouth. A heat began to swell from Izzy and overcome Kyle. Kyle began to giggle and laugh but instead of feeling more fat emerge on her body she instead felt Izzy disappear and found herself falling on a bed. A pair of strong masculine arms reached around her and a hard dick pushed into her generals. She felt her tongue loll out while the man gripping her played with her fat rolls and humped her. She moaned as the thorough fucking continued and orgasms rocked her body finally the man cave and stood up revealing his absolutely ripped form. She felt her heart flutter and he leaned in close.<br />
<br />
“Oh no, you did some exercise, we better remedy that,” the man commented before walking over to a tray and lifting the lid revealing cakes, chocolates, and grains. He plucked up a dish of chocolates and began to feed her them one by one. She’d once been a skinny and gorgeous girl but this man’s fetish about fucking fat girls had turns her into a blob who now hoped she lost the ability o walk soon so she could gain even more weight. She bit into another chocolate and as weird as it all was it made Kyle’s dissolving mind extremely happy.</p>
