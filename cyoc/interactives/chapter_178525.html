<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You are incompetent, Mattia,&quot; Filippo grumbled. &quot;If it weren&#39;t for me, you wouldn&#39;t have remembered that today marks three months since we took our first group of girls to the island. And since I&#39;m smart, from the beginning I made a list of all the girls we&#39;ve brought and I keep track of their days of stay .... of so many that we have brought in these months, it is important to keep a record so as not to confuse those who are ready with those who need more time &quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;I did remember that it was exactly 3 months that a lazy and useless girl needs to start her transformation,&quot; said Mattia. &quot;And I didn&#39;t bother to make a list because the Lady keeps her own record and she had told us that she would let us know when and in which room we would start the capture.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but if you had kept your own record of each girl and each room, you would have known that these two girls began to sleep together for a month. It seems that one of them began to be afraid to sleep alone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, the Lady must have told me that,&quot; Mattia tried to defend himself. &quot;She is responsible for this girl almost running away.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t blame the Coachwoman for your clumsiness, Mattia. Besides, she pays us very well and if she gets angry she will do something terrible to us ... worse than these asses.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well ... errr ... then you should have told me that there were two girls in that room,&quot; Mattia started to blame Filippo for his mistake.<br />
<br />
&quot;And how would I know where you were going to go, stupid? I told you it was better that we capture them together, but you abandoned me because you did not hear any girl change from the corridor that we had to watch.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s that they were taking a long time to change and I got tired of waiting for them. So I thought it was better to check on another floor.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, they didn&#39;t take long. When you left I heard the first cry.&quot;<br />
<br />
*****************<br />
To Carina&#39;s surprise today she had woken up earlier than the previous days. Carina had had a odd dream that night: naked in a field and eating grass on all fours. A very odd dream. It was still dark, it was a few hours before dawn, so Carina lit the candle that was on the bedside table. Carina and her friends had done everything that came to their minds, without worrying about anything except playing and today would be no exception.<br />
<br />
Carina, like her friends, slept with her casual clothes on. She did not have to follow orders from her parents to put on pajamas, therefore she was ready to go out and have fun.<br />
<br />
However, after removing the blankets and sitting by the side of the bed to put her shoes on, Carina felt a strong dizziness that caused her to almost lie back on the pillow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oooohhhh .... I&#39;m woozy,&quot; Carina said touching her head with one hand and her belly with the other. But she tried to downplay it thinking that it would soon pass. Then Carina stood up ... or at least she tried.<br />
<br />
Carina began to feel vertigo, her body began to slowly lean forward.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-what is wrong with my body?&quot; Carina wondered when her back was arched enough that she was about to fall flat on her face.<br />
<br />
Distraught, Carina raised her upper body to regain her upright posture. For a few moments, Carina managed to stand straight but she did not last long in that position, her body leaned forward again. Using all of her strength, Carina tried to lift her torso back again but she couldn&#39;t.<br />
<br />
Rather Carina lost her balance and fell forward catching herself with her hands. Now her spine was long from the tailbone to the back of her head, her buttocks were raised toward the ceiling, her legs were completely straight, and her heels and soles were rooted toward the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhhh... I can&#39;t stand up. What&#39;s going on?&quot;<br />
<br />
Carina started to jump a few times, momentarily taking her hands off the floor but she always returned to the quadruped position.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell is wrong with me?!? I must be very sick.&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Carina began to feel a tingling in her ears. Then she felt a strange warmth in them. Unable to touch them, Carina decided to see what was happening to her in the large mirror in her room.<br />
<br />
Having no other choice, Carina began to walk slowly on all fours toward the mirror marching her opposite hand and foot off the floor at the same time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Owww... I&#39;ll only be able to walk on all fours like animals. Everyone will make fun of me. Boo-hoo-hoo-hoo !!&quot; Tears started rolling down Carina&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
When she reached the mirror, she saw in her reflection the ridiculous position she was in. But what she really scared her off was when she noticed her ears.<br />
<br />
&quot;AAAIIIIEEEEEEE!!! NOOOOOO!!! My ears! My ears! What happened to my ears?&quot; Carina screamed in horror at the sight of her pointed ears like an elf&#39;s. The worst thing is that she saw with her own eyes how these were still lengthening rapidly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! And they keep getting longer! I&#39;m going to look like a rabbit,&quot; Carina cried. Her long ears grew to a length of 10 inches and soon they sprouted soft reddish-brown fur on the outside and white fur on the inside.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s horrible! Horrible! First walking like this ... and now with these ears. I&#39;m a freak!&quot; Carina wailed as she saw in her reflection how her long ears could now flick backward and forward poking out from her red long hair.<br />
<br />
Then, a bulge behind the lace dress appeared. It was tugging her skirt and underpants forming a kind of tent behind her. When the bulge tore away at the fabric, a long reddish-brown tail with a black tassel sprung out. Carina heard the sound of a loud tear and felt as if someone had given her a slight wedgie, so she looked up at her reflection of her and saw in shock a donkey tail wagging behind her.<br />
<br />
&quot;AIEEEEEEEEEE! I-I have a tail! And ... and ... and I can move it!&quot;, Carina cried out in shame when she saw that she could raise and lower her tail with little effort. It was so humiliating. &quot;Owwwwww ... it must be a curse. I&#39;m turning into an animal.&quot;<br />
<br />
Carina tried to lift her right hand in hopes of pulling her tail off. Unfortunately she couldn&#39;t do it without losing her balance. Carina sat on the floor thinking that this way her hand could get closer to her tail but there she discovered that she could no longer move her arms back, her arms and hands were firmly forward.<br />
<br />
Seeing that it was useless to grab her tail, Carina went back to standing on all fours.<br />
<br />
&quot;I should seek help. Maybe they can take me to a hospital and a doctor caaaaaaaaa..... Heeeeeeee-hawwwww! Heeeeeeee-hawwwww! Heeeeeeee-hawwwww! Heeeeeeee-hawwwww!&quot;<br />
<br />
When she managed to stop, Carina had her eyes wide open, her ears flopped down in shame and her arms and legs were shaking in fear... she had brayed, even though they were brays in a mostly girl voice.<br />
<br />
Now Carina understood everything. She was turning into a donkey.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no! Oh no! Oh nooooooooo! No! No! No! No! No! Whatever except that.... anything except a donkey. <br />
<br />
Carina impulsively ran to the door, which was closed.<br />
<br />
&quot;HELP ME! HELP ME! Someone please help me!&quot; Carina didn&#39;t know what to do. She couldn&#39;t grasp the doorknob, all she could do was knock desperately on the door with one hand.<br />
<br />
Not receiving a prompt reply from someone, Carina hysterically and mindlessly lowered her head between her arms and raised her hips into the air while kicking out several times with her legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhh ... what have I done to deserve this? I can not be a donkey. I am a girl.&quot; Carina wondered while she was bucking as a true donkey. Her shoes and socks were thrown through the air. When her completely bare feet felt the cold floor, Carina realized that she was unconsciously lifting her legs towards the ceiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god, what was I doing? I was acting like.... like a real donkey!!&quot; Carina stopped bucking but she was still very nervous and panicked, with her face soaked in tears. <br />
<br />
At that moment, the palms of her hands started to tingle as her fingers seized up. Her eyes were wide in shock when Carina saw how her fingers started to merge together and forced to curl back into fists as they seemed to fuse into a thick black mass. <br />
<br />
She started to hyperventilate as she tried to move her fingers, but to no avail. Soon the mass shaped itself, forming her hands into proper fore-hooves.<br />
<br />
“HAAAAAAW!” Carina brayed in terror, ignoring the fact that she made that sound again even though she still sounded like a girl. After all, that hardly could compare to losing her hands! “Nooooo..... m-my hawwwwwnds!”<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Carina felt the same tickle but now on her feet, so she looked back and saw that the ends of her feet were merging together and darkening, quickly becoming black hooves too.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahhhhh! I have donkey feet! Ahhhhh… heeeeee hawwwwwww!&quot; Carina&#39;s bray sounded slightly more animalistic now. &quot;HELP! HELP! SOMEBODY HELP ME!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Carina started running around her room desperate because she couldn&#39;t get out and because no one was listening ... or at least that&#39;s what she believed.</p>

KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK! Someone knocked on the door of her room. Who could it be?</h3>
