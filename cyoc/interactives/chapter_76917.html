<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;So tell me Sam, what bar were you coming from when you saw me walk into this alleyway?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Meow&quot; said Sam, putting as much disdain into his animal voice as he could.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you&quot; deadpanned Tim, his demoness telepathy reaching inside Sam's now feline mind and scouring out the <br />
exact address of where he first stumbled out of. <br />
<br />
Tim and Sam then emerged from the alley and walked down the public sidewalk to &quot;Queequeg's Tavern&quot;. When Tim <br />
reached Queequeg's(it was a pretty short distance, at most seven minutes away), Tim rolled his hips sexily as <br />
he stepped inside, attempting to hopefully attract some new converts. Tim realized only fleetingly how he was <br />
slowly turning to the dark side and becoming an infernal demoness in mind as well as in body.<br />
<br />
Tim saw immediately that the bar was a dive. Empty peanut shells littered the floor, the tables were made of <br />
rotting wood, the shot glasses were mostly filthy, and the columns supporting the ceiling were filled with <br />
profane graffiti and numerous phone numbers where readers were invited to &quot;have a good time&quot;. While there were <br />
plenty of citizens in this part of town who were of drinking age, the bar scene was relatively crowded, <br />
running the gambit from high class establishments that were expensive but generally had the prettiest people <br />
inside of them, to more mundane but still respectable pubs where a guy or gal could relax after a hard day's <br />
work(like a Cheers bar, basically), to low class gin joints like this one. Queequeg's somehow missed the boat <br />
on being a hip place to drink, and it looked like it was in desperate need of repair. <br />
<br />
The bartender was a burly balding man(with some brown in the back) wearing a white chef's apron who was <br />
cooking some hamburgers on his grill. There were two guys in the back playing cards, and they both looked like <br />
they came out of a cowboy movie. The first one even looked like an older version of Wyatt Earp. The bartender <br />
looked up at Tim, who was holding Sam in his arms, and he began to speak up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I help you, Miss?&quot; he asked politely.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah&quot; began Tim. &quot;I'm looking for a certain man that I think was in your bar. He was around 6'0 even in <br />
height, around 24 or 25 in age, muscular, with blonde hair and some facial stubble.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam meowed to confirm that this was him, but since no one in the bar spoke cat but Tim, Sam's plea for help <br />
went ignored.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, that sounds like Sam Mersky. Why, did he knock you up or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; shouted Tim, having enough male pride in him still to be disgusted at the idea of being near that man in <br />
human form.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that's good&quot; answered the bartender in a deadpan manner. &quot;I keep telling him to stop going after teeny <br />
bopper looking broads or he'll make a mistake and end up in jail some day. Excuse me language. Why do you need <br />
to see him?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was in an alleyway, and he tried to grope me&quot; admitted Tim, building a set up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my&quot; said the bartender, actually sounding a bit concerned. &quot;Did you call the police?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I came here first. I noticed a book of matches he was carrying with this name on it, so I walked around <br />
until I saw this place.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I haven't seen him around since Wednesday&quot; answered the bartender seemingly obliviously. But what the <br />
bartender didn't know was that Tim's demoness telepathy knew full well that he was holding back for his <br />
friend. Tim was reading his mind right now.<br />
<br />
Transcript: Sam Mersky might have been a scumbag when he was drunk, but when he was sober, he was a good man <br />
who was just down on his luck. The bartender wanted to help him out, and if that meant lying to some teenage <br />
girl who'll probably get over being groped in a few days, so be it.<br />
<br />
&quot;So be it, then&quot; said Tim, right out of the blue.<br />
<br />
&quot;So be what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll be find out in a minute&quot; answered Tim.<br />
<br />
Under normal circumstances(well, under normal circumstances where Tim can read people's minds), he would be <br />
willing to cut the guy a break. After all, Tim himself made leering ears towards the pretty girls in school, <br />
and on average, some of them must have felt uncomfortable. But Tim's moral compass, and his mental facilities, <br />
were slowly mutating the longer he was in this heathen body. He now felt like spreading chaos, and hurting <br />
people just to watch them suffer. Tim tried his best to keeping those feelings under control, lest he lose <br />
sight of his mission...but in this one instance, he just...couldn't...resist...<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah!!&quot; screamed the bartender, reaching for his chest. He thought that he was having a heart attack, but he <br />
wasn't. He was growing breasts. And he was shrinking, and his bald head was spouting hair again, and that hair <br />
was turning a shade of raven black, just like the girl standing in front of him. Once it stopped growing, his <br />
silky tresses reached his armpits. Once he stopped shrinking, he was around 5'4(from his former height of 5'11 <br />
1/2), and at that moment he could really tell what was happening.<br />
<br />
Now his clothing was now morphing, changing shape. A low cut black tank top gave way to a generous amount of <br />
cleavage, and her red pants accentuated the sleekness and skinniness of her legs while giving prominence to <br />
her heart shaped buttocks. He didn't have a bra on, but he didn't need it. Pouty lips formed, as did a pair of <br />
black heels. All in all, he looked very much like a contemporary of Tim the demoness.<br />
<br />
Smiling, Tim looked towards the two guys in the back.<br />
<br />
What did Tim do?</p>
