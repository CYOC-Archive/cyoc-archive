<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next moring and just after breakfast I walked up first to the main farmhouse. Asking to talk to Frank I was told he was in barn seven and that he'd call me later.<br />
<br />
At first I walked out the main house and headed toward our condo like a good little tenant. Then the thought of checking out any of the other six barns and or the farm's produce store set near the roadside.<br />
<br />
A look either way had me walking toward barn one. Even as I got closer to it the size and height of its walls were maybe three stories tall. Inside were the tractors all clean and sparkly new. The other machines and cultivators were kept there too. I walked into the upper level there finding Frank's office and a cute secretary sitting at a desk. <br />
<br />
I again asked to talk with Frank as she checked some computer locator and noted he had moved from barn seven to number five. Thanking her I headed down stairs and out the big doors toward barn five.<br />
<br />
Each barn was of different size in length or height. I supected each had then a special purpose and noted how they were all built in a long row. <br />
<br />
Entering barn five I asked for Frank of a worker ther and was pointed down a long dark cobblestone isle. As I walked the isle there was a row of narrow stalls made for horses or maybe ponies. Then next came box stalls made for larger breeds of horses each having been made of heavy wood and ringed with black iron bars.<br />
<br />
As I walked along horses became alert to my presence and stuck their heads out to meet me. A petting of one large Percheron had me feeling a close relationship to him even though I never really cared much for horses before. <br />
<br />
Frank's heated voice amidst yet another arguement drew my attention away from Percheron Morgan.<br />
<br />
Turning a corner yet another long dark row of stalls lined the cobblestoned isle. The sound of Frank being mad with someone got louder the closer I got. Soon I could see him walking this way and that as if telling somebody just what he expected to have happen.<br />
<br />
The barn's echo did not help me understand what all the fuss was about so being maybe foolish I walked closer to Frank. As I came to within four stalls away he was talking about birthing of a foal and what might be expected.<br />
<br />
Suddenly Frank spotted me coming down the isle. His conversation halted and yelling at me to stand clear he seemed really upset I was there right then. I hearing him walked yet closer wondering out of simple mindedness what he was talking about.<br />
<br />
Frank met me at the doorway to the large box stall. His eyes and face glared at me with anger. He was really steamed and taking me by the arm led me down the row of stalls and out the barn. He pointed toward his office and called on the walkietalkie to expect me there pronto.<br />
<br />
I did as asked having seen enough to make me wonder as was Sid wondering. Inside the stall where Frank had stood telling someone about birthing a foal was not another soul, save a large dappled gray Percheron mare laying out on a thickly straw covered floor.<br />
<br />
Frank's secretary had a cup of coffee ready for me and asking me to sit down I agreed. She was nice but had deep probing questions as if this place had something to hide.   <br />
<br />
When Frank stormed in he walked past me and into his room. A wave of his hand to me like, calling in some bad child for a spanking his eyes told much. <br />
<br />
A leather chair set across from Frank and his large dark oak desk was the only place for me to sit. A small friendly grin on my face was met by Frank reminding me that a farm and its workings could be dangerous to an unsuspecting person.<br />
<br />
He was about to go on with his father son talk when I cut it off asking for to be assigned as a worker in the Beef Cattle section.<br />
<br />
Frank stopped mid sentence and asking for some forms from his secretary leaned back in his judges chair and smiled. As the young lady brought in the forms she too smiled and walking out closed the door as if what we would be talking of was quite private.<br />
<br />
Taking the forms Frank filled in some items and then asked for me to repeat my name and Mary's full legal names. Then some more scribbling and he handed me the two page form.<br />
<br />
&quot;Definition of Legal Dispensation &quot;<br />
<br />
Even as I read the form my mind was working about what Sid said and the scene in the barn an hour ago. The form was a legal form although scribbled out quickly by Frank and using blue ink which is not proper of legal forms. Yet as I finished reading the form it was a directive for our entire estate to be reassigned away from our children and placed into a trust for use by Sunrise Farm.<br />
<br />
Oddly it asked only for my signature and not Mary's but then needed only one witness as Frank's secretary had signed her name already to the form.<br />
<br />
&quot;You want me to sign this?&quot; I asked Frank his face now a smirking smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you wish to remain here, yes I do!' he stated just as hard and toughly as one might wanting ultimatly all our money.<br />
<br />
&quot;These forms should be signed and registered with the county clerks office in your state and mine for proper authorization!&quot; I reminded him yet knowing that my state would never agree being it was written in blue ink. <br />
<br />
Frank smiled yet and then told me that once signed I could begin to work around and become acquaited with the beef cattle side of the farm. He made mention that by the time the form was registered in my home state the knowledge I'd gained working with the cattle would make me a ture asset to the farm. He asked if mary was willing to work with me or was she just a fence setter? I said she liked farm animals but her small build made her generally unfit for heavy work. This for me and my situation seemed to be of some favor to Frank. He ignored Mary's not working directly with the animals and then turned his conversation over to my duties.</p>
