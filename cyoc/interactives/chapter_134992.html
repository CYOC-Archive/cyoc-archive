<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">New Zerzura had many of the same issues that the Dinotopians had found in the other colonies in that while there were some larger buildings, they were largely scaled to the modern mammalian megafauna that had joined Animalia. This meant that the larger Dinotopians, like Jen and Andrew, weren&#39;t quite as comfortable as they might like. However, as with many of the other colonies as well, there was plenty to see and do outside that was a comfort to all of them. Though some of that even had its own surprises.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish that were salt water,&quot; Darla commented as she looked at the water from the Nile River that was on the western edge of the colony, &quot;then maybe we could go in and help find these supposed tunnels that might be there...&quot;<br />
<br />
Maya nodded. The two uplifted Coelacanths had enjoyed much of the colony tour and even found the fact that Kenya and Egypt were so willing to accept refugees at Maelewano and New Zerzura and to help them survive many of the things that often made people flee their homes. But there was some of the issue that as saltwater fish, even with some lungfish DNA spliced in when they were uplifted, it was figured that in water they&#39;d need some measure of salinity in order to breathe underwater. Which had meant no swimming at Vilcabamba, Maelewano, or New Zerzura.<br />
<br />
&quot;Assuming its there,&quot; Molly commented from behind them, &quot;that&#39;s sort of the puzzling thing with archeology... and maybe paleontology too... is that they won&#39;t often know were to dig exactly.&quot;<br />
<br />
They turned to see the Dolichorhynchops Animalian approaching with Regina not too far behind. They curiously looked down the path that lead from the area where the town was for the colony toward the small river side harbor that was there on the river. There were a few small boats that powered their way up and down the river and there were a fair amount of river plants and reeds that grew along the banks as well. It was quite a contrast with the desert that they could easily see when their plane came in for a landing. Regina looked at the water and noted its rather brownish color, which made it pretty clear that there was a fair amount of sediment in it. This was something that had made the Nile valuable as a source of irrigation for farming in Egypt for centuries, but it&#39;d also mean that visibility would be rather limited.<br />
<br />
&quot;The bigger thing would be simply seeing if they are there,&quot; Regina commented, &quot;there&#39;s enough sediment in the water that while it can be filtered... and one of the bigger buildings that&#39;s behind us here probably IS for that purpose so the drinking water is clean... the water in the river is probably more easily navigated by touch than by sight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is true,&quot; came a male voice that alerted all of them and they looked over to another path.<br />
<br />
Standing there were two male Nile Crocodile Animalians, though it was soon shown that unlike many of the Animalians they&#39;d seen at New Zerzura, these two were converted humans. This was seen by their dark black hair that was seen on their heads and over their dark bronze colored scales. It was also seen that they also wore Egyptian military uniforms as well. They looked a little tight in that the Nile Crocodile was larger than a human and that the Egyptian government had had likely had to give these two the largest uniforms they had just to fit them after conversion, and they just barely fit over their firm muscles and broad shoulders.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re... soldiers...&quot; Molly gasped noticing the uniforms, &quot;but... Animalians...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We were in the Egyptian Army before we converted,&quot; the first spoke, &quot;mostly to help with security here and for our country. We would understand not wanting to wage offensive wars. And that we would not participate in... but protecting Egypt and protecting those weaker than us is another thing. For if some lunatic were to violently attack a friend or neighbor would you just stand by and let them be attacked, just because Animalia distances itself from militarism?&quot;<br />
<br />
Regina glanced to Molly and both soon nodded in agreement. They were privately amazed at how well these two knew English, but then, it was possible that as soldiers in the Egyptian Army they might have had some training and help with the US or with England and that sort of contact required some knowledge of English. For the moment though, they didn&#39;t really dwell on it.<br />
<br />
&quot;If a friend were attacked,&quot; Molly spoke, &quot;we would defend them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that&#39;s a big part of our job here,&quot; the second nodded, &quot;to protect people... and helping the archeologists explore the west bank of the river and see if there were any covered entrances that could go under ground as well... Though the amount of sediment in the water is a bit difficult to see through... even with a crocodile&#39;s eyes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve also been assigned to help with counts for fish and things,&quot; the first added, &quot;something the science/environment ministry would want to monitor... things like Nile Perch numbers and so on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably a food count, I&#39;d think,&quot; Molly commented. She licked her lips as she did so. Which the two crocodilian Animalians noticed as they looked to both Molly and Regina.<br />
<br />
&quot;They can be,&quot; the first agreed, &quot;glad to see fellow crocodilians with similar tastes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re actually not crocodilians,&quot; Regina commented as she looked down to Molly, &quot;I&#39;m a Spinosaurus, the world&#39;s largest Theropod dinosaur, and the first fossils of it were found in Egypt, I think.&quot; She then turned to a side to give the two a better view of her sail. &quot;It has a rather crocodile like head... but it wasn&#39;t a crocodile. It&#39;s greatest competition were actually Cretaceous Period crocodiles for fish in rivers and swamps in prehistoric Egypt.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;m a Dolichorhynchops,&quot; Molly answered, &quot;it was a species of plesiosaur that lived in the sea that covered what is now Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Weren&#39;t they related to crocodiles?&quot; the second wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not that I know of... crocodiles and plesiosaurs were both reptiles... but beyond that, I can&#39;t say they were actually that closely related,&quot; Molly answered, &quot;though the similar evolutionary designs... particularly in relation to the head design is likely something that suited the fish they all largely hunted.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Makes for many evolutionary coincidences,&quot; Regina added.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm,&quot; both Nile Crocodile Animalians spoke, sounding rather intrigued.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Sherry and Wanda, meanwhile, were looking over some of the ruins of old Zerzura that had been there as a historical site. The old site included many things that were similar to many of the other ancient sites in Egypt that related to their ancient kingdoms. Much of the painting that had been on the older structures that survived had dulled away under years of erosion, but that was probably to be expected. The big thing that they noticed was that even the security measures in the ruins area also served play to Egyptian history.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... the Guards of Anubis are pretty much New Zerzura &#39;s version of the Rhino Guard?&quot; Wanda asked, flicking her ears back and forth. She wore a light white cotton dress that covered everything appropriately, but as a Wooly Rhinoceros Animalian, she could still feel Egypt&#39;s heat. Thankfully it was a dryer heat here, but that didn&#39;t change all that much.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty much,&quot; the Jackal Animalian that Wanda and Sherry were talking to responded, &quot;we&#39;ve done a lot of work with the Egyptian Army with regard training in law enforcement and artifact protection. In that, once they feel confident in us, we&#39;ll be in charge of law and order here and handling many of the missions that will relate to the colony&#39;s security.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So... you&#39;re being trained like MPs then?&quot; Sherry wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;MPs?&quot; the Jackal Animalian asked, tilting one ear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Military Police,&quot; Sherry answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose that is the term that would apply,&quot; the Jackal Animalian answered, &quot;though we&#39;ve also gotten advice and help from Horizon and civilian Egyptian officials... both with regard to history and law enforcement.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That must explain the uniform,&quot; Wanda commented as she glanced the Jackal Animalian down.<br />
<br />
The Jackal Animalian was dressed in attire that looked more like the ancient artworks that depicted Ancient Egyptian soldiers, though the specific Kingdom wasn&#39;t known Sherry or Wanda, they did know it was very different from what modern police or armies wore in the field, even areas as hot as Egypt. In this, the Jackal Animalian played in quite well also with some of the ancient depictions of Anubis, which was likely a play in to Egyptian history and why the police force in New Zerzura was named for the Ancient Egyptian deity rather than as a branch of the Rhino Guard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Those of us on duty here in the historical site are required to dress like this,&quot; the Jackal Animalian gave a small chuckle, &quot;it helps us interact with tourists and be on the look out for any potential theft and that sort of thing. In fact the colonel in charge of our training has commented that a lot of Ancient sites have historically been robbed... as this goes back centuries. Even Ancient Egyptians would vandalize tombs, thus why there was often so many security measures.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Has anyone tried to steal anything here?&quot; Wanda asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;So far, no,&quot; the Jackal Animalian answered, &quot;but we&#39;ll be ready if they do. And when we&#39;re on duty in the city... we&#39;ll still be vigilant, but in a more modern uniform.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A little bit more than what we go through with the Rhino Guard, eh?&quot; Sherry asked to Wanda.<br />
<br />
Wanda nodded and looked to one of the signs that was posted for tourists to read. The sign read that it was for a temple for major religious ceremonies, and particularly in regard to the Ancient Egyptian God of the Sun, Ra. The sign also showed a map that showed that next to it was a smaller temple built to Anubis, the God of Death. In this there was a lot of history that had to be protected and understood and the local measures in New Zerzura had to balance to be good with both ancient history and with security measures. That was a lot to keep track of.</p>
