<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
Walking down the hallways Carl was incensed.  Kicked out of his own room?  How dare they!  He decided to go back to the reception desk and give the hotel staff a piece of his mind.<br />
<br />
None of the humans he passed seemed to pay him any mind.  But the female anthros gave him strange looks, ranging from anger to admiring smiles as they checked out his body.  He was happy to see the same blonde haired cat lady manning the reception desk.  But she was not pleased to see him.  <br />
<br />
&quot;What do you think you are doing?  You need to leave here right now!&quot; she hissed angrily.<br />
<br />
But Carl was now equally angry. He just wanted to go back to his hotel room and rest.  The hotel room he had paid quite a bit for.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen, I have had it up to here with you people.  I am a paying guest and I just got thrown out of my room by your snooty staff.  Now I demand an apology and maybe even some compensation for my trouble.  Understand?  So stop giving me lip and get to work typing or whatever you have to do.  Or do I need to talk to your manager?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A paying guest? And what room were you staying in, sir?&quot; she said sarcastically.<br />
<br />
Carl realized he didn&#39;t know.  He had written it down, but he had left it in his wallet.  The wallet he had left back in his room with the rest of his things.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Look, I don&#39;t know.  Can&#39;t you just look it up?  The name is Carl James,&quot; he said with a little less confidence.<br />
<br />
The cat lady smiled a Cheshire grin.  &quot;You know we can&#39;t give out guest information.  That is, unless you have some sort of identification.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I left it in my room,&quot; said Carl nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see.  How convenient,&quot; she said.  The cat lady sighed loudly.  &quot;Listen, what kind of fool do you take me for?  You are obviously a male anthro. Why don&#39;t you just go back to Boy Anthro Town and stop wasting my time.  I don&#39;t have time for these little fun and games.&quot;<br />
<br />
Carl was flabbergasted.  What could he do?  He decided he had to tell the truth, even if it did get the zebra girl in trouble.<br />
<br />
He leaned in close to the cat girl. <br />
<br />
&quot;Listen, I am not supposed to tell you this, but I guess I have no choice, &quot; said Carl conspiratorially.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, this will be good, &quot; she said with a smile. She leaned in close to Carl. &quot;I am all ears.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her pointed ears twitched.<br />
<br />
&quot;I ordered a zebra girl through room service.  And she gave an injection ... um, in my penis. ... that turned me into an anthro zebra like her so we  could have sex.  It&#39;s going to wear off soon and then you guys are going to feel pretty silly.  So can I go back to my room, please?&quot; said Carl desperately.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, that is a good one.  I have never heard that one before.  An injection in your penis?  And then you became a zebra?  Ridiculous!  You need to leave right now or I will call security, &quot; she said. Unseen by Carl she reached below the counter and pushed a panic button.<br />
<br />
&quot;But it&#39;s true!  I swear!&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;And just when are you supposed to become human exactly?&quot; she asked with disbelief.<br />
<br />
Carl was little confused.  He hadn&#39;t really thought about that.  How long had it been? Carl looked at the clock behind the reception desk.  He was shocked to see that over six hours had passed since he called the zebra girl.  That couldn&#39;t be!  He was supposed to change back in just a few hours.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Wait something isn&#39;t right....&quot; he began.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll say,&quot; said a husky voice behind him.<br />
<br />
Carl turned to see two large, beefy anthro rhino girls wearing tight fitting security uniforms looking down at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing here, sweety?  You need to go back to where you belong.  Are you going to leave quietly or do we need to get rough?&quot; asked one of the rhino girls.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I have to see the zebra lady! She can explain everything.  I have to see her!&quot; he pleaded with desperation.<br />
<br />
The cat girl receptionist rolled her eyes.  &quot;We have several zebra girls.  What was her name?&quot; <br />
<br />
Carl struggled to remember.  It started with an R, he was sure of that.  Or maybe it was a Z.  With rising desperation he realized he could not remember her name. In a panic he made a frenzied attempt to dash past the rhino women, frantically hoping he could spot the zebra girl or find where she and the other anthro girls were staying.  But the rhino girls grabbed him roughly by the arms and lifted him off the ground before he could get by.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rough it is then, &quot; said the rhino girl as she and her partner carried him away from the reception desk, struggling all the way.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no!  Stop!  You don&#39;t understand!  I need her!  She is the only one who can help me. Please let me go see her,&quot; said Carl.<br />
<br />
One of the rhino girls looked down at him as they continued to drag him away.  &quot;Fraid we can&#39;t let you that, stud.  But if you are really that desperate for some female company, I&#39;m game.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Gina! &quot; said the other rhino girl.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up, Tina,&quot; said Gina. &quot;It has been a long time since I had some fun.  And I don&#39;t come across studs like him very often.  Did you see his junk?  It would put a male rhino to shame.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You are such a slut!&quot; said Tina.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, stop acting like you are any different, &quot; said Gina. &quot;I saw you checking him out.  I know you want him, too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tina blushed.  &quot;But we have a job to do...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And we still can .... after a short little break,&quot; said Gina. <br />
<br />
The rhino girls stopped moving and looked down at Carl.  <br />
<br />
&quot;What do you say, stud?  Want to have a little fun with us before we take you back to the sausage party in Boy Anthro Town?  Might be a while before you get to make love to real women like us again,&quot; said Gina.<br />
<br />
Carl looked up at the rhino women.  They were large, full figured women.  But their curves were sexy, with their thick thighs and generous breasts.  He did find them somewhat arousing.  Not as attractive as the zebra girl, but he could manage.  And maybe he could use the delay as an opportunity to look around for the zebra girl.  Hell, maybe he could even sneak away from the rhino girls while they were distracted.  Then again, maybe he was better off just going to Boy Anthro Town.  He supposed that the situation there was the same as it was here.  Surely they had human female guests just like the human male guests in Girl Anthro Town.  Maybe he could find a nice female human guest who would believe his story and help him escape.  Or maybe the serum just needed a little longer to wear off.  Maybe he didn&#39;t need to make love to these women at all, he just needed to bide his time in Boy Anthro Town until he was human again.<br />
<br />
The rhino women looked down at him, Gina with an almost predatory lust and Tina with a shy but hopeful expression, waiting for his decision.</p>
