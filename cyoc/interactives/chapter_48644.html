<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Steve stood there waiting and nothing happened. &quot;Damn I was sure that would work,&quot; He said a bit dissatisfied. Then after he said that he felt something hugging his left leg and he looked down and he saw a long semi-thick flesh colored tail tapering to a point wrapping around his leg. He stared in amazement as it grew in length and size to be long enough to trail on the ground some. As it grew he felt it push his boxers back and away from his bottom. He then took off his boxers and pulled his tail out of them and looked at it.<br />
<br />
The tail was large and almost like a lizard's in shape but it was covered in Steve's skin. &quot;It worked! I cant believe it actually worked! Oh god what do I wish for next?&quot; He said dancing around happily for a moment till he fell down tripped by his boxers at his ankles. He sat back up and then laughed as he stood up and tried to pull his boxers back up. They came up fine in the front but wouldn't go up as far in the back due to his tail. <br />
<br />
Steve then grabbed the salve bottle and then thought about it he sat down on his bed and some of the salve onto his hands again then started rubbing both his feet and legs. <br />
<br />
&quot;I wish my legs would become digitigrade and feet turn into paws with claws...&quot; Steve said carefully. He stopped rubbing then watched as his legs and feet warped to grant his wish. Overjoyed he rubbed some on his hands and wished again, &quot;I wish my fingernails would turn into razor sharp claws...&quot; As soon as he stopped rubbing just that happened.<br />
<br />
Steve stood up again wobbling for a moment since he is unused to his new legs. He looked at his legs and hands and started jumping around and dancing badly wile trying to stay standing. &quot;Oh boy this is awesome what else should I do?&quot; He asked out loud as he grabbed the salve bottle. &quot;I know!&quot; he said suddenly as he pulled some more salve out and rubbed it on his abdomen and wished again. &quot;I wish i would turn into a human centaur...&quot; He wished with a big smile on his face. <br />
<br />
In moments Steve's abdomen extended massively and he then bent forward as new legs just like his newly transformed ones came sprouting out. He looked at his new legs and behind. His tail was far away now but it was still easily long enough to reach around to him. &quot;Oh wow this is insane I can't believe this is actually happening,&quot; he said as he picked up the salve again.<br />
<br />
Steve rubbed some on his abdomen yet again but this time he wished, &quot;I wish for an extra pair of arms just below my original arms.&quot; After he finished rubbing a new set of arms came shooting out of his sides along with his abdomen extending slightly. He looked at his now four clawed arms, four clawed digitigrade legs, and his long tail. He couldn't help but laugh his head off at what he had become. He grabbed the slave yet again and using all 4 of his arms he rubbed it over his top pair of shoulder blades as best he could. Wile doing so he wished...<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish I would grow wings...&quot;<br />
<br />
After that was said a few moments past and then wings similar to dragons in fantasy stories sprouted out of his back. They looked large and powerful like a dragon's but they were covered in Steve's skin. He looked in awe at them as he opened and closed them behind him. <br />
<br />
Then it dawned on Steve that his body had increased in size by now quite a bit. He turned around and looked down at his back legs as he pulled his boxers down with his tail. His penis was still the same size as it was before which looked ok but a little off. So with one of his hands he grabbed the salve again and this time used his tail to rub it over his penis and balls, which began to give him an erection. &quot;I wish my penis and balls would grow larger to fit my new body...&quot; he wished again. As soon as he did his penis and balls began to grow to a much better size mid erection which made it a good foot long and the thickness of a soda can. He continued masturbating with his tail and he fell to his knees and then on his side due to the pleasure. After a few moments he let out the largest ejaculation he had ever done before. It went all over the floor, his underside, and front legs. <br />
<br />
After a few moments Steve recollected himself and realized what he had just done. It felt so wonderful and he would have to do it again. Then an alarm started blaring. &quot;Crap! I completely forgot that Cindy was going to be coming over,&quot; He said looking at the clock. He then reached for the salve and looked inside and realized immanently there was barely any left. He had scraped the last of it out to increase his dick size. Steve started to freak for a moment then he saw a notice on the back of the bottle. <br />
<br />
&quot;Any and all wishes made true via this salve are permanent and affect the belief of the others in the world. So that others would come to accept a wish that affects them to a great deal unless other wise specified...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok so she wont freak out that I am a freak but she probably would freak that I am naked and covered in cum,&quot; Steve said as he stood up. He then sat the salve down on the table next to his bed and then he grabbed some clean boxers, shorts, and a shirt and headed to the bathroom. Steve took a shower to clean off the cum though it was not surprisingly awkward since he couldn't really turn around in the shower since he took up the entire thing. As he showered he took a closer look at his body and noticed that his muscles have grown a bit as well. It took some time but he cleaned himself off then dried himself quickly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ok now to figure out how to get dressed,&quot; Steve said as he grabbed the shirt he brought with him. Then looked at it and noticed that it had an extra set of sleeves which let him put it on easily. He put his boxers on over his hind legs with is tail and this pair had a hole in the back for his tail to fit through as did the pants he brought. He walked back to his room and then noticed a new set of pants in the closet with the buttons on the back instead of the front. He figured they were designed to fit on his front half. So he wrestled to put them on and they fit surprisingly snugly. He also noticed what looked like a few large flaps of denim with a zipper on each edge. He then made sense of what this was for, he wrapped it around his back between his legs with the zipper on the bottom and zipped it shut and then to both of his pants on the front and back. <br />
<br />
Steve then looked at himself and was rather amazed that it fit as well as it did a three piece pair of pants that fit him like a glove. While admiring his look in these new cloths the doorbell rang. &quot;That must be Cindy, I hope this date goes well,&quot; He said as he started running to door to stop at the stairs and carefully walk down. He had gotten quite used to his new legs quickly. All the while slowly forgetting the way he was before. He reached the door and opened it to see....</p>
