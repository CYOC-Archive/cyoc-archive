<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Roger walked out the back door and stood at the gate to his forty acre pasture. A few minutes of pondering what had occured had him walking to the barn and see the new donkeys.<br />
<br />
Looking into the first stall a simple minded Donkey stood oggling him back but not making a sound. Roger tried asking him questions but the best he did was bray once and then flop down to sleep.<br />
<br />
Roger looked toward the other Donkey and took a half step that way before shrugging his shoulders, ready then to walk away. Braying wildly the Donkey tried his best to get Roger's attention. As Roger was at the barn's wide door he turned and thought it better to try and see if perchance one of the Donkeys might be Brian.<br />
<br />
A braying Donkey soon saw to his delight Roger's face. Then pawing in the straw covered floor he tried Morse code, but Roger didn't remember it from his Navy days. He Brayed and tried his best to move the thick lips and make words or something close, just to let Roger know who he was, his Son!<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish I knew if you were my son before being this beast?&quot; asked Roger.<br />
<br />
The Donkey thought for a moment and then took his front right foreleg making one tap to the barn floor. Roger watched but made no connection till the Donkey being fustrated to no end screamed a loud Braying at his ole' Dad.<br />
<br />
&quot;Brian?&quot; asked Roger.<br />
<br />
The Donkey tapped his right forehoof once and gave a true Donkey style toothy grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;You were Brian, my Son?&quot; asked Roger beginning to shake a little.<br />
<br />
Again the Donkey taped once more the right forehoof to the barn floor and smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is this what you really wanted to be, a male Donkey?&quot; asked Roger his voice denoting his nervousness.<br />
<br />
Brian tapped this time with his left forehoof two times in hope of signaling Roger a , NO!<br />
<br />
Now Roger caught on and seemed to relax some as the questions poured out and the Donkey stood tapping with this hoof and that for hours. A tired Brian stood with tongue hanging out parched well past just being thirsty. Seeing the Donkey's condition, Roger filled two buckets with water and placed both with a Donkey. A split bale of hay and one small plastic bucket of mixed grain he let Brian and Elroy to eat and be taunted by instincts.<br />
<br />
As Roger entered the farm house his Wife sat at the kitchen table.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well what so interesting of two Donkeys it took you four hours?&quot; asked Mable.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know now what happened, the Donkey  in the house when we came home was Elroy! The note was left by Brian who experimented with some blue powder. He mixed it up making a blue drink and with swallowing it down soon changed into a very nice male Donkey. The two of them are out in the barn. Elroy for some reason is mostly an ignorant animal, but Brian's mind and memories are just fine. Oh he can't talk but with a right tap to the floor for yes, and a left tap twice for no I have figured it mostly out, Dear!&quot; explained Roger.<br />
<br />
Mable's eyes went wide and her stare was like a person eight angered beyond their limits or one scared to death.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's wrong Dear?&quot; asked a frightened Roger as he looked into his dear Wife's face. <br />
<br />
Slowly she picked up her coffee cup and reached over to Roger for him to look into. Her hand was noticably shaking as Roger looked into the cup. There staining the cup's bottom was a milky blue substance, she'd drank some of Brian's mixture which Roger not thinking had put in their fridge.<br />
<br />
Mable stood up and steppig forward grabbed Roger for a warm and loving hug. The two stood there for some time hugging each other till Mable whispered in Roger's ear.<br />
<br />
&quot;If it happens to me don't let either of the boys have me for a mate, promise me Roger!&quot; she begged.<br />
<br />
Roger stepped back and as he began to agree the beginning growth of donkey hair was sprouting on her forehead. Quickly he took her hand and the two rushed out to the barn. In the door and down the main isle to Brian's stall they went. <br />
<br />
&quot;Brian, your Mother drank some of the blue mixture, a cup full! Is, is that enough for her to change too?&quot; asked Roger in a panic.<br />
<br />
Looking up at his two scared parents he presented Mom with his true Donkey style grin and with a right hoof tapped just once.<br />
<br />
&quot;YES! A right tap once is his answer, yes! I, Oh my Dear Dear Mable!&quot; exclaimed Roger as his eyes went wide and Mable looked him in the face.<br />
<br />
Mable had maybe due to the run for their barn or with the obvious excitement had chaged ever faster. Her ears were much longer and standing striaght up they had stubble like fur growing thicker and thicker as Roger watched.<br />
<br />
A try to speak at Roger only issued forth a gravelled sounding bray. She clamped her hairy hands over the fast expanding lips and gave a really scared look to her Husband. Reaching to give Roger a hug he pushed her away. Then with her braying voice she burst into tears.<br />
<br />
The emotion of that moment, the tears, her desire to remain as a person and Roger's definate manners as he was suddenly repulsed by what she was becoming made the chage rush on ever more.<br />
<br />
Roger stood there as his Wife's body expanded tearing her clothes as the Donkey in her came out. Mable cried as bit by part of her body changed. It was when the tailbone began to grow out she clapsed to their barn floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;HeeHaw, HeeHaw, HeeeeeHaw, Heee, Heee!&quot; screamed Mable as words fell wanting but the voice was all Donkey.<br />
<br />
Minutes passed and then two hours as Roger's wife Mable became a large and mature Jenny. A nervous swinging tail and her soft snorting had both Brian and Elroy standing each with a enraged erection. Elroy pawwed at the floor and screamed his male bray wishing to get and capture Mable in a real foreleg hug.<br />
<br />
Roger watched the fear well up in his changed Wife. A friendly patting to her strong and hairy neck brought about a snapping bite of her large teeth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry Dear, I was only trying to offer you some comfort in this time!&quot; said Roger as he rubbed a hand over the injured side of his thigh.<br />
<br />
Turning he looked about and with a quick move grabbed from a hook one horse halter. Quick and nimble he pulled it over Mable's new face clipping it tight and fast before she could try and bite again.<br />
<br />
Mable was discusted with her Husband for treating her like some vicious beast. A rein clipped to her halter she was then led down to a stall of her own.<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll stay here while I go doctor my leg! Now be good and I'll see what could be arranged, Dear!&quot; said Roger as he walked away and Mable brayed her feelings.<br />
<br />
Soon Roger was back in the house and noted sitting in the sink was the pitched, drained dry. He turned and looked toward the barn, &quot;Hmm only a cup ful huh!&quot; he said thinking about Mable.<br />
<br />
he rinsed the pitcher several times pouring the lightly blue colored residue down the drain. A towel to dry it and then tossing the towel into the waste basket he was fairly sure that he's never drink any of the stuff himself.<br />
<br />
A chicken pot pie for his diner and Roger relaxed to watch the seven-o-clock news. His tummy full and the happenings of the day he soon fell sound asleep. <br />
<br />
About this time in the barn two verile male Donkeys were beside themselves. Brian and Elroy both stuck in closed box stalls had their nostrils pointed high up in the air. Each had their upper lip curled to gather in the heady scent of a female Donkey. Prancing about their extra big Donkey cocks swaying and swinging about hey were filled with lust.<br />
<br />
Mable was not dumb to all this noise and from her new body came simular urges. Urges to let the boys have their way and settle the wild desires she felt as this Donkey Jenny form. It was near midnight when Elroy being older than Brian and thus a larger and more mature Donkey finally jumped the side rail of his box stall.<br />
<br />
Brian brayed his dismay as Elroy his Donkey cock flared and looking wild of eyes moved closer and closer to his Mommy. Mable too watched with whites of her large eyes showing fear of what was to come. Stuck with her large round butt facing the isleway she was reined in and could not move more and a foot either way.<br />
<br />
Elroy reached his head out and sniffing Mable's rear he brayed with delight. <br />
<br />
Mable scared to death of what was maybe to happen while deep instinctive desires drove her to want his male attentions. The more she tried to swing her rear from Elroy's advaces the more the verile male Donkey went wild.<br />
<br />
&quot;What!&quot; Roger jumped up, he'd heard someone scream like they were being killed or something.<br />
<br />
His first thought was to check on Mable and see if some stray dog had gone into the barn. Quickly he ran to the barn and switched on the large ceiling light. There he stood, his mouth open and eyes wide as Mable looked back at him.<br />
<br />
Elroy was still buried deep and humped over mable's back as Roger walked over. Mable brayed softly as if her mind was being taunted by the raw animal sex buried in her black vagina. Roger looked at Elroy seeing only a verile male doing what came natural. A quick look toward Brian he then stepped back as Elroy started to hump and pump for yet another loving round.<br />
<br />
Mable began to push back making Elroy's cock go so deep his sheath parted the lips of that black skinned vagina. His grunting delights mix with Mable's moans of female enjoyments. Roger remembered his wife doing much the same when they made love and he felt betrayed.<br />
<br />
Roger turned around and walking toward the barn's door, Mable brayed for maybe some help. &quot;Enjoy it dear you've crossed the line, be a Donkey!&quot; said Roger as he stomped back to the house. As he stood on the back porch he noticed that due to the passioned noise in the barn even the Crickets lay silent. He opened the door and walking in grumbled, &quot;Tomorrow I'll plan out their three futures!&quot;</p>
