<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sarah went first to her desk and began her paperwork she'd started before being called upstairs per her Uncle's request. A quick look down the hall saw Boris walking out for his first lunchtime of the day.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh well I'll keep the necklace till he comes back, it makes me feel important somehow!&quot; Sarah said to herself as the blue stone in the Medallion warmed up.<br />
<br />
The Museum's newest exhibit was of the Amish Religion and the people who kept their faith and lifestyles alive into the twenty first century. It had been Sarah's job to manage the building of each part of the large exhibit. It had three parts, the Home front, the Farming, and the inside of their simple styled Churches.<br />
<br />
Having read dozens of books on the subject Sarah would walk through the exhibit looking of places to put things of interest. Items which by today's standards are true antiques, but to those of Amish life are still used today.<br />
<br />
At last she finished off the day's mail and many requests about the Museum. Now she had some time to think and plan so she went upstairs.<br />
The Home Front was well furnished and gave even her the idea she'd gone back in history.<br />
<br />
The Church too was easy to fit with it's rough plastered walls and benches made of rough sawed wood and the seating smoothed flat without any backs. The pulpit made of fine hand carved wood to remind the people below of the Kingly state standing before them. The windows a simple clear glass and the lighting from gas lamps as they still use today.<br />
<br />
On she walked into the Farm scene with the painter's still doing their art on the backdrops. A vast scene of pastures, and fields filled with grain ready for harvest. The barn was as other buildings made of stout cuts of heavy beams and rough cut boards. Sarah had wanted four stalls built but space became a problem. Therefore she had two made as stalls just for standing animals, while two were larger for mares or stallions to turn around and watch the happenings about the barn.<br />
<br />
A pen for the fake sheep she'd had made looked real enough from a distance. Peering out the side window the sty with it's sow sucking eight piglets made of latex looked also real. A row of walking dairy cows heading up the pasture toward the milking stalls made her smile with satisfaction.<br />
<br />
All was forming up and with the new fake horses shed have the barn scene complete. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sarah!&quot; called a voice from the far end of a pasture scene.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Jake!&quot; said Sarah seeing her part time helper and one excellent authority on the Amish.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I had an idea of adding a fire pit showing a horse being ready for shoeing. Many an Amish farmer might do his own or if the town was close would take the horses to a Blacksmith. I thought it might make the scene a little more busy!&quot; suggested Jake.<br />
<br />
Sarah looked about the already full barn scene and shook her pretty head. &quot;No, I think the barn is busy enough, but maybe if we had some different sizes of horseshoes we'd hang them from spikes on the rafter beams as if stored till needed.&quot; reasoned Sarah as Jake smiled and agreed.<br />
<br />
Jake turned to leave and go to find the horseshoes when he said, &quot;Nice necklace, kind'a big ain't it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah smiled as she held up the fair sized bobble. &quot;I think it's just another mill stone around my neck, it's for Boris to put in Plexiglas.&quot; said Sarah.<br />
<br />
&quot;That, no, your kidding, it's so nice looking on you!&quot; joked Jake as he headed out to fine the horseshoes.<br />
<br />
Sarah looked down at the heavy bobble. &quot;You do look nice, even the blue stone seems to roll in waves of color. I would wish to.....!&quot; she began to say as her Uncle called for her from the entrance doorway to this exhibit.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have a couple of people to go to lunch with....I told you to give that Medallion to Boris!&quot; shouted her uncle.<br />
<br />
Sarah told him of Boris leaving for Lunch and when he got back she'd give it to him. The answered made her Uncle's face clear of anger but when he told her to be careful of what she said while wearing the Medallion she began to wonder.<br />
<br />
In a flash she had a thought, her computer had over 6000 forms of language and if she took the Medallion and placed it on the scanner she might get the odd letters read. As her computer began to snort and spark the scanner made two passes over the Medallion's face.<br />
<br />
Sarah watched for several minutes as the lights flashed and her computer read countless numbers of language patterns. A snap and the printed began to print big and bold letters.<br />
<br />
&quot;ONE WISH TO BECOME - A DESIRE IS TO REALIZE YOUR JOY - BEWARE&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah looked at the Medallion and then she smiled, &quot;A wishing stone like a wishing well, everybody had these, so what?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dropping the thought she went back to work and began again looking the Amish barn over for what it might need. An hour passed and she sat on a barrel just studying the barn.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just can't think of what might be needed! Everything looks alright but there seem's to be something missing and I can't put my finger on it! What I need do is go and seen an Amish barn as the people work about inside doing what was needed.&quot; muttered Sarah to herself.<br />
<br />
Just then the banging of Boris coming back from his first lunchtime of the day. Sarah looked down at the Medallion and then with her pretty fingers wrapped around it, she said, &quot;One wish, to realize my desire and feel the joy! I would wish to stand incognito for one week inside an Amish barn, to be part of the scene while remembering all around me, as I stand looking, listening, sniffing, and doing what is natural!&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah took a deep breath and was about to walk into Boris' room when the electric shock from the Medallion stopped her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ouch, what in the world.......................................!&quot;</p>
