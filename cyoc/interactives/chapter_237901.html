<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Author’s Note: Changed the time of the story from the middle of the day to morning.<br />
<br />
You look around the locker room, scanning the entire area for a secluded spot where you could hide. Walking over to a far end of the locker room that’s mostly hidden from sight, you let out a huge sigh of relief. Luckily there’s not many people inside the locker room; even better, they’re far enough from you that you can’t form any connections with them. As long as nobody approached you before you could find a way to take off the suit, you should be good.<br />
<br />
“Braiden, are you sure you’re alright?”<br />
<br />
A large and firm hand is placed on your shoulder, and in a manner of seconds, you’re gone.<br />
<br />
Braiden turns his head to see Tim observing him with a concerned look, his hand tightly resting on Braiden’s shoulder.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, it’s just... I feel a bit off. I’m not sure why,” Braiden said, a feeling that he had forgotten something important coursing through his head.<br />
<br />
Tim’s expression quickly turns into one of amusement, and he removes his hand from Braiden’s shoulder.<br />
<br />
“Dude, I can’t believe you. I mean, I know you have a high libido and all, but it’s only 8 in the morning. Are you already horned up again?” Tim’s suggestion is quickly taken into effect as Braiden begins to sprout an erection.<br />
<br />
“What the fuck, man? Could you not call attention to it?” Braiden responded, a little annoyed, which was ironic considering how easily noticeable it was due to his large size and the elastic material of his black athletic shorts.<br />
<br />
Braiden knew that Tim knew full well that he had a high sex drive; this meant he got horny rather easily. Usually, Braiden dealt with this by masturbating in the morning. However, he had woken up late and had had to skip his morning jerk-off session to make it to the gym on time for his daily workout.<br />
<br />
“Chill out, there’s no one else in here,” Tim said with a laugh. True to his word, the entire locker room had cleared out, leaving only Braiden and Tim inside.<br />
<br />
“Dammit, if only I hadn’t overslept, then this wouldn’t have happened.” Braiden looked down at his boner. It was twitching from need and was already starting to stain the front of his shorts with pre.<br />
<br />
“Well, if it’ll help us get back to lifting faster, I’ll be glad to help.” Tim knelt down in front of Braiden and grabbed the band of Braiden’s shorts and underwear, and with one swift motion, he tugged them down, exposing Braiden&#39;s rock hard cock in the air.<br />
<br />
Braiden wanted to angrily shout at Tim for exposing him so easily, but within seconds Tim’s mouth was on his cock, sucking it in a skillful and experienced manner that made his anger instantly vanish, replaced by lust in its stead.<br />
<br />
Braiden’s eyes rolled back as he let out a moan, Tim’s blowjob giving him one of the most pleasurable sensations he had ever felt. Part of it was from the fact that Tim was able to fit his whole member in his mouth. This was no easy feat; Braiden’s cock stood at an erect length of 10 inches and had plenty of girth to it, yet Tim was somehow talented enough to deep throat his impressive cock without gagging once.<br />
<br />
After a bit, Tim pulled himself off Braiden’s cock and looked up at him. “Feeling close yet? Your balls are so huge and heavy that you always cum a ton, so I definitely need to prepare myself to swallow before you do.”<br />
<br />
Braiden felt his balls start to expand as they grew larger and heavier, the cum stored within them growing exponentially. As a side effect, his testosterone levels increased, giving Braiden a more masculine appearance as he gained more body hair and his muscle mass increased.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, man, I’m close. Just suck me a bit more, and I’ll be good,” Braiden responded in a deeper voice. Tim instantly got to work and continued to blow him, and in only a few minutes Braiden was ready to release.<br />
<br />
Braiden felt his heavy balls tensen before he came, letting out a low moan as copious amounts of cum exited his cock and filled up Tim’s mouth. Tim, meanwhile, had his eyes closed, only letting out a “mmmm” of satisfaction as he greedily ate all of Braiden’s cum.<br />
<br />
After Braiden had finished emptying his load, he pulled his cock out of Tim’s mouth and pulled his jockstrap and shorts back up.<br />
<br />
“Thanks, man. I feel so much better now,” Braiden said with a large grin on his face. Tim only gave him one in return.<br />
<br />
“Bro, seriously, if you needed me to do this THAT badly, we could’ve done it back at the apartment.”<br />
<br />
“It’s not my fault you left so early today. I swear, you’re always so eager to go out. Well, with the exception being when we have to go to work.”<br />
<br />
As an effect of the suit, new memories began to be created as Braiden’s and Tim’s connection strengthened.<br />
<br />
Braiden could now remember how he had first met Tim when he was asked to train a new hire at the office. Tim was only 26 at the time, 2 years younger than Braiden, so their close age allowed them to connect more easily. Upon conversing with Tim, the two found they had a lot in common, and they eventually began to hang out together in their free time outside the office. Eventually this transitioned to them working out together and becoming each other’s respective workout partner. Then, a few months ago, Braiden’s old roommate moved out, allowing Braiden to offer Tim a chance to move in with him since Tim was looking for a new place to rent. The two had been roommates ever since, and living together had allowed them to take their relationship to the next level, from friends to friends with benefits.<br />
<br />
At this point, the suit’s magic had been completed, allowing you to turn back into yourself if you stated the proper incantation. However, you were no longer yourself. You were now Braiden Bolton, a 30-year-old accountant, and that’s all you would be unless you remembered your original self.</p>
