<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jax was browsing the aisles of the Magic Shop absentmindedly. He had heard good things from his friends, despite the place being open for a week. He was especially excited when his friend Rob came into school with 5 times the muscles as he had the previous day. If this shop could turn him into a beast that The Hulk would bow down to, then surely Jax could find a good trinket or two to help him in... certain aspects.<br />
<br />
Truth be told, Jax had no idea what he could find here. He just knew that everything there was most likely the real deal. The shop had been helping and affecting people for the past week, and things had seemed pretty dang interesting, with giants and giantesses roaming the city, people changing their bodies in a split second, and a host of other strange oddities. Honestly, with all the odd things happening nowadays, his dirty little pleasure would probably fly straight under the radar.<br />
<br />
Jax turned down a strange aisle of random herbs and spices, most of them in some foreign language. None of them looked interesting, or useful for his purposes. However, one item was entirely too interesting to pass up: A glass bottle the size of a jar of peanut butter, full of little white tablets. A sticker with the words &quot;New Release&quot; sparked his interests. The label was in the same foreign language as everything else, but there was a nearby sign that said, &quot;Bring to counter for Translation&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me, sir?&quot; Jax said, carrying the jumbo tub of pills. An old, Asian man was manning the counter. &quot;Can I get a translation for this?&quot;<br />
<br />
The man took the tub and read the label. His face perked up, smiling. &quot;Oh, Wish Pills, these are.&quot; He replied. &quot;You place one in mouth, swallow, and you get a wish.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Jax asked. &quot;Do they really work?&quot;<br />
<br />
The man scoffed. &quot;Would I sell them if not work?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess so...&quot; Jax asked, reaching for his wallet. &quot;How much for a pill?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, no no. We sell whole jar,&quot; The man said. &quot;10 dollars.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That seems remarkably cheap for actual magic wishes.&quot; Jax remarked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you see, we have no use for these items anymore.&quot; The man informed. &quot;Sure, magic is cool and fantastical, but we don&#39;t need magic in this day and age. We need money, and fast.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.&quot; Jax replied. &quot;Well, I&#39;ll take the tub then.&quot; he pulled a $10 out of his pocket and paid for the pills.<br />
<br />
Ending up back at the safety of his home, Jax busted open the lid of the pills. Immediately, a cold breeze burst out, smelling vaguely of mint and cinnamon, or probably some ancient herb in the pills. It reminded him of something, but the memory was fuzzy and indistinct. The pills, about 300 in total, resembled tic-tacs in a way. Honestly, they might have actually been tic-tacs, what with the smell and price. That&#39;s be hilariously upsetting in a way. Still, Jax had a small faith in the pills. He plucked a cold, white pill out of the tub, and put it to his lips. The pill immediately went from cold to warm, and then to mildly hot as he swallowed.<br />
<br />
His mind felt like it was being pleasantly massaged by magic energy, and his vision went bright and colorful, as if he was seeing everything at 100 times the contrast. He knew the magic was working. So, in the short span of time he had to make the wish, he decided on one thing. His dick had never been particularly big. Three inches hard was surely not average. But today, that was gonna change. IN his magically-heightened state, he whispered, &quot;I wish my dick was 8 inches long when hard&quot;.<br />
<br />
The magic fled from him as fast as it had came, leaving him feel ever so cold inside. But that wasn&#39;t what he was focused on. He was more so focused on the new tightness in his pants. Looking down, his bulge had barely shifted, but of course, he was flaccid. If he was precise, he&#39;d be 4 inches soft, and a whopping 8 inches hard. Of course, Jax had to test this.<br />
<br />
Stripping off his jeans and boxers, Jax looked at his newly grown member. Surely, this would be interesting to see when fully erect. He merely had to use two fingers before. Now, if he really was 8 inches, he&#39;s have to use his full hand. For now, he grabbed his member, slowly stroking it with his right hand. The pleasure and excitement made this much more pleasurable than before. His member grew and became an erect, solid 8-inch cock, perfect for what he was planning on doing.<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t finish himself off, he didn&#39;t have time for that. Jax had bigger fish to fry. He pulled up his pants and moved on.<br />
<br />
Taking a new pill from the jar and swallowing instantly, Jax focused on his body. He was always shamefully skinny, and not even in a cute way. People had sometimes mistaken him for anorexic, which couldn&#39;t be farther from the truth. He didn&#39;t want to be skinny. In fact, he wanted to be the exact opposite. Jax wanted to be fat. Like, very fat. He wanted to be a gainer for so long, but his metabolism worked far too fast, and he couldn&#39;t eat as many calories as it burned. He was sick of it. He couldn&#39;t be fat before, but now, he could be as fat as he wanted to.<br />
<br />
He whispered softly, but with passion, &quot;I wish I was 500 pounds, and very fat.&quot;<br />
<br />
This wish was different. It wasn&#39;t a sudden cold snap and his body was fat. It was slow, and methodical, and incredibly erotic for the ex-twink. It started with his gut, of all places. It began to swell up with fat, at first like a round balloon, but soon started to sag over the waist of his now-tight jeans. His ass filled out like crazy, popping the first seam immediately. His chest expanded into moobs so big, they&#39;d make a busty girl jealous. His arms and legs pumped up like sausages, being weighed down and getting heavier. Even his face became rounded and chubby, a second chin forming rapidly. His cock, while not directly affected, was soon being swallowed by his growing fatpad, loosing inces by the minute.<br />
<br />
Jax was lost in ecstasy. The joy of living out his dearest desired was fueling his boner. He desperately reached for his cock, but at this point, his gut and flabby arms were barricading him from doing so. He couldn&#39;t do much more but desperately wiggle his legs to hopefully get himself off.<br />
<br />
His clothes started to bust off, tearing into ribbons. The button of his jeans had long since teared off, his zipper being forced open. The shirt he was wearing rode up his gut, past his belly button, and basically being a bra for his man tits at this point. It was only a matter of time before the first rip appeared across the chest, baring his new tits and cleavage. His jeans had nearly split down the center of each leg, and he was only seconds away from the rest of his clothes to completely rip off and leave him completely naked. And Jax didn&#39;t care at all. He was completely lost in the sensation.<br />
<br />
Finally, it happened. His shirt completely busted around his thick arms and juicy tits, and his jeans shredded off of his legs, leaving only his painfully tight boxers to hold out for a while longer, before inevitably succumbing to the size of his ass. And with that final note, the first of Jax&#39;s many transformations was complete.<br />
<br />
Jax stood up from his chair, assessing his new body. He was, of course, undeniably obese, but did he care? No, not one bit. He was ecstatic to finally be to fat, it was hard to stand. He loved his new, massive gut, and his giant, suckable tits, and his huge, fuckable ass. He was perfectly fine with being over 500 pounds. He didn&#39;t care about anything anyone would say about him. He was fat, and in pure ecstasy because of it.<br />
<br />
Now, he just needed to find some clothes so he could go out on the town... or better yet, wish up some clothes.</p>
