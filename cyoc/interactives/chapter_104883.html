<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Cody hears Simon and Devon talking outside, like they know somethings up. He rushes over to the door and clicks the lock into place.<br />
&quot;That should give me a chance to escape.&quot; He thinks. Looking around the room he sees two windows on the far wall, one of them has an automatic air dryer under it. <br />
&quot;If I could stand on that, I might be able to make it to the window!&quot;  He darts over to the dryer just before Simon and Devon start ramming their shoulders into the door. The deadbolt isn&#39;t going to hold long, it&#39;s already straining and cracking under their combined mass. &quot;BOOMCH&quot;<br />
Cody reaches up to the window and hoists himself up so that he is perched on the top of the dryer. &quot;BOOMCH&quot; He opens the window and sticks his head out, surprised to see the ground is level with the window, &quot;Oh yeah,&quot; he recalls &quot;the school is build into a hill, the back looks a lot shorter than the front, architecture can be so surprising sometimes&quot; &quot;CRASH!&quot; The two jocks burst into the bathroom and find tiny Cody with his head sticking out the window, trying to pull himself out. Simon dashes over and grabs his legs, pulling him back in. Cody struggles and kicks, he lands a very strong kick but suddenly falls against the window frame with a thud accompanied by a loud crash from inside the bathroom, he&#39;d accidentally kicked the dryer right off the wall! Simon wraps his arms around Cody&#39;s legs hugging them tightly together, there&#39;s no escaping now. He tries pulling himself up on his forearms but there&#39;s no way he can get out of Simon&#39;s python-like grasp. Taking a moment he rests and wonders why Simon isn&#39;t pulling him back in... &quot;Maybe he&#39;s afraid I&#39;ll scream, we&#39;ve already made too much noise someone is bound to have heard, a teacher or a coach, maybe they&#39;ll come rescue me!&quot; But Cody couldn&#39;t get caught destroying school property, he could get suspended, or expelled! He had to keep quiet... After getting some rest he decided his only option was to try to pull himself up, with all his strength he lifted himself up on his hands and extended his arms pushing his head up to the sky and into something... a hat? &quot;DUDE, BRO!&quot; came Devon&#39;s voice from above him, reaching out a helping hand. &quot;We gotta get outta here!&quot; Simon pushes Cody out through the window and onto the ground outside.<br />
&quot;Shit, Cody thought a little dazed, he&#39;s right, we gotta get outta here... and our Bud Simon is still inside&quot; He turned around grabbing Simon&#39;s hand and yanked him up onto the ground.<br />
&quot;Fuck,&quot; said Simon, &quot;Somebody&#39;s fucking coming, lets GO!&quot;<br />
Devon and Simon ran off toward the football field, Cody pause for a minute confused... His Bros turned back looking at him pleadingly... &quot;Come on Bro...&quot; They beckoned.<br />
Cody stood there dazed, he reached his hand up to his head feeling the sports hat on his scalp... &quot;what&#39;s going on?&quot; he wondered...  just then he heard someone rush into the bathroom, &quot;What the hell&quot; came the voice of a what sounded like one of the faculty. <br />
Suddenly a coy jockish grin spread over Cody&#39;s face, he truned around and pushed the window closed with his foot, then pulled his leg back and forced his foot right through the glass. Barely able to contain his excited laughter he slunk down the hill to his buds, and they ran off across the field, not stopping for the irate shouts that followed them. <br />
&quot;Wow,&quot; said Devon, &quot;That shit was hilarious! Did he see you?&quot; &quot;Naw man! Retard didn&#39;t see a thing&quot; Cody crowed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; said  Simon, &quot;if you still wanna toss around a football we can hang in the street in front of your house!<br />
&quot;Sounds fucking awesome! Of course I wanna play. I&#39;ve been waiting all day for that shit&quot; Said Cody.<br />
<br />
In the middle of Cody&#39;s street the three started tossing the ball back and forth between each other. Steadily increasing the distance between themselves. Cody loved the feeling of the soft breeze on his shirtless body, he loved the weak afternoon rays from the sun on his back. He was having a blast, &quot;I wanna do this every DAY,&quot; he thought.  After a few minutes of throwing the ball it became obvious that Cody wasn&#39;t able to throw as far as the other guys. In fact his throw was embarrassingly week. He&#39;d never even been able to throw a straight spiral before, the hat had taken care of that, but his arm just wasn&#39;t up to the task. &quot;What&#39;s the matter Code?&quot; Devon asked, &quot;Not feelin&#39; it today&quot; <br />
&quot;Naw man, it&#39;s not that I&#39;m havin&#39; a blast... It&#39;s my arm, feels week today&quot; Cody replied.<br />
&quot;Well maybe you just need a little warm up or somethin&#39;&quot; Simon offered.<br />
&quot;Yeah Code,&quot; Devon agreed &quot;lets take a second and warm up, lets see how many push ups we can do.&quot; <br />
They all got down in the street, Cody looked up to see when the others we&#39;re ready to start, the bill of his sports hat touched the nape of his neck. They all started together performing push up after push up, sweat started to build up on Cody&#39;s body, especially from his hairy pits. Moisture flowed from under his arms lubricating his manly bushy hair making each push up a slippery joy to do. He couldn&#39;t stop, his arms were feeling swollen and the smell from his pits was filling the street, it was like a tangible cloud around him... His pecs swelled as well and his legs stiffened, his whole body seemed to pudge up with muscle. Cody lost track of time, robotically repeating the exercise for minutes and minutes and minutes until Simon finally slapped him on the back &quot;BRO!&quot; That&#39;s enough you&#39;re gonna wear yourself out!&quot; &quot;No way Cody said, I feel great, that&#39;s just what I needed, a little warm up&quot; The sun had nearly set and Simon and Devon had to head home, but Cody had so much energy and he had to see if his warm up had loosened him up. Devon agreed to stick around a bit longer since he lived near by, they tossed the football around for another hour with Cody getting some real distance on his throws. It felt amazing, His arms were a little awkward, swollen feeling but they had so much power! His hairless body glistened in the glow of the street lights, accentuating his newly defined muscles. Devon went home after promising Cody they&#39;d be doing this again and MORE once he joined the teem. &quot;The team&quot; Cody though, &quot;Why aren&#39;t I on the teem? Football is all I ever think about, I can&#39;t believe I haven&#39;t joined up yet!&quot; &quot;I gotta make time by quitting some of those shitty geek clubs&quot; He realized. <br />
<br />
Cody turned and headed into his house. I&#39;m home Mom! He shouted, his mom peaked around the corner seeing her little boy shirtless and wearing a navy blue Seattle Seahawks hat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome home honey&quot; she said, &quot;What happened to your shirt?&quot; <br />
&quot;Aw I took it off to play some sports and when I went to put it back on the damn thing was missing!&quot; He lied, <br />
&quot;Well, be more careful next time, &quot; She said &quot;I suppose it was getting a little tight on you anyway, I don&#39;t like you wearing such tight clothing to school it shows too much, it just does.&quot; She chided, &quot;and take your hat off when you enter a building, you know that&quot; <br />
&quot;Yeah, yeah&quot; Cody sighed, ripping the hat from his head and wiping the sweat off his forehead. I&#39;ll see you tomorrow Ma&#39;. <br />
<br />
Cody was suddenly exhausted and fell face first onto his bead, spreading one leg so it hung off the side as though he were suddenly too big for the twin sized mattress, kicked his shoes off his feet one by one passed out.</p>
