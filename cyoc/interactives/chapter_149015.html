<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Hmph... Ugh...&quot; Thomas was the first to regain consciousness. He tried to speak, but his voice was all muffled. &quot;Wha... What happened?&quot; Thomas tried to regain his thought. &quot;That&#39;s right... I got that app that said I could have my wish granted... Then my body started to shake real bad... right.&quot; As he tried to get up, he touched his pants. They felt wet. &quot;That&#39;s right. I wet myself too. That&#39;s so three years old... Hmm? That&#39;s strange... Why does my pee-pee feel weird?&quot; He touched his privates again and they felt strange to be sure. They felt bigger. Not to mention his whole body felt heavy. &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; His eyesight still was blurry, so he felt around so he could get up. Eventually he touched something. &quot;Is this a bed? Where did this come from?&quot; Thomas tried to push this strange sensation from his mind as he righted himself up. He was finally able to stand up and rubbed his eyes. &quot;Ugh... My hands feel itchy.&quot; He was soon able to see a little more clearly, but that only made him more confused. &quot;Am I... in daddy&#39;s room?&quot; He heard a familiar voice. &quot;Daddy?!&quot; He whipped around, but his dad was nowhere to be seen. &quot;Daddy?! Is that you?!&quot; He could hear his father&#39;s voice though. It even kept repeating the very same words he was saying. He looked down. &quot;What?&quot; But he was hit with an even more confusing sight. &quot;Why are my hands huge?! My feet too?!&quot; He eyed his body, which looked much unlike his own. He wasn&#39;t even wearing his own clothes anymore. &quot;No way...&quot; Thomas didn&#39;t want to believe it. He slowly walked towards a mirror. In its reflection was his father. He touched the mirror and hid father&#39;s hand touched back. &quot;Dad...dy...&quot; Thomas spoke and likewise his father did too. It looked like the same exact words too. Unable to believe it, Thomas motioned towards his pants to pull them down. As he did, he was hit with a sight that all but confirmed what he was thinking. &quot;AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh... Groan...&quot; Frank had finally regained consciousness. &quot;Goddamn... That was something else...&quot; He had no idea what had happened, but he was alive and that was good enough for him. &quot;Got to get up... and get changed...&quot; Frank said as he tried to grab his bed for balance. He was still groggy enough that he didn&#39;t realize a much younger voice was coming out his mouth. Probing for somewhere to place his hand, he grabbed on to something with ease. &quot;Was... was my bed always this close to me?&quot; he thought as he stood up. His eyesight still wasn&#39;t back completely, so he wiped his eyes. &quot;Geez... I&#39;m more disoriented then I thought... My hands feel like they&#39;re tiny...&quot; As he slowly regained vision, he took stock of what happened. &quot;So let me think... I was just finishing a phone call with my co-worker when I got another message... But it was weird... right? Something about Thomas wanting to be an adult? Anyway, right after that I started to have a seizure of some kind. I even pissed myself... No feels like I shit myself too... Goddammit!&quot; Frank cursed out loud at his embarrassment. But that&#39;s when it hit him. &quot;Was that... was that my voice...?&quot; He blinked a few times so he could finally see more clearly as he held his throat. &quot;Ah... Ahh!&quot; He tried to right his voice, but it came out all high pitched. When he finally regained his full vision, he realized something was very wrong. &quot;Why am I in the living room?!&quot; Freaked out, Frank slowly looked down at his body. &quot;What the fuck?! I&#39;m tiny!&quot; Looking at his hands, &quot;Tiny!&quot; Looking at his feet, &quot;Tiny!&quot; Frank opened up his pants, careful not to let the shit fall out, &quot;It&#39;s fucking tiny!&quot; Frank slapped his pants tight. He grabbed the remote and turned the TV off, so he could get a better look. When he did, what was staring right back at him was a kid no younger than ten. &quot;No way... No fucking way!&quot; &quot;AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!&quot; All of the sudden, he heard a scream from upstairs. The voice was very familiar to him. &quot;No way... No way! Shit! Shit! There&#39;s no fucking way!!&quot; In a panic Frank ran upstairs, not caring what was dribbling out .<br />
<br />
&quot;AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!&quot; That was all Thomas could say to what he saw. His pee-pee was huge now. It must have been five times as big now. &quot;OMG! I&#39;m Daddy?!&quot; Thomas looked at the mirror once more. What was staring back at him was no doubt his father. Thomas was definitely the only one here, so it must mean he was his father now. &quot;My wish came true...&quot; Thomas stared in amazement. He was six feet tall and weighed over 150 pounds. &quot;Omigosh! Omigosh!&quot; Thomas jumped up and down in a mix of fear and excitement. &quot;My pee-pee&#39;s ginormous! My whole body&#39;s ginormous! Holy cow! My whole body is hairy! And my body is hot!&quot; Thomas flexed in the mirror. &quot;I can&#39;t believe this! My wish came true... Well, maybe not the way I wanted it, but my wish came true! Whose da man?! Whose da man?!&quot; Thomas tried all kinds of poses in the mirror. His penis stood up as he did. &quot;Omigosh! It&#39;s even bigger now! How does it do that?!&quot; He touched his penis. Every time he did so, he felt something indescribable. &quot;Ah... Ah... That feels so good! Ah!&quot; Unable to contain himself, his dick shook, shooting out streams of white liquid. &quot;Oh no! I&#39;m peeing!&quot; Thomas stopped what he was doing and rushed to the door. But before he could touch it, the door opened itself. &quot;Thomas, is that... Blegh! Gah! What the fuck?!&quot; Thomas couldn&#39;t react in time as he peed over the person at the door. &quot;Oh no! I&#39;m so sorry! I...&quot; But before he could apologize, he noticed who was at the door. It was a little kid, one he recognized quite well. His body was all wet as steady drops of poop dribbled down his legs. <br />
<br />
At the door, Frank looked up at the person who he knew all too well. He looked horrified as his dick pulsed up and down with leftover ejaculate dripping on the floor. &quot;Thom... Thomas...?&quot; He finally asked. &quot;Daddy... Is... is that really you?!&quot; the man asked back. &quot;Yeah...&quot;</p>
