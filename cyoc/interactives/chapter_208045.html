<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">This time, Dan felt hungry. Impossibly hungry. There was an obvious kitchen area in every break room, with bowls, spoons, cups, and what looked something like soda fountains or ice cream dispensers. Dan scrambled over and started filling a bowl with a strange thick black slurry. While he wolfed it down, half tempted to skip the bowl and just shove his open mouth under the nozzle, he couldn&#39;t help but notice it really didn&#39;t seem any different from what he&#39;d coughed up to shrink down in the first place. It did seem obvious that they&#39;d recycle all the mass, especially if it was mostly nanites... and it was most likely washed and recycled somehow.<br />
<br />
It was dense, too. He felt his center of mass shifting as the stuff hit his stomach, but he just kept eating, not sure where he even had room for it. His child sized was starting to feel bloated, and his clothes started to feel too tight. Eventually though he seemed to hit his target weight, completely losing that ravenous appetite and slumped in his chair. He thought for a moment he saw what few drops of slurry were left in the bowl slither out and down the drain on their own... but he had a lot more than just that to take in. His perspective was shifting upwards again, and his stomach was flattening back out. There was a weird and distressing sensation and perhaps a faint gurgling sound as if his internal organs were all liquifying and sloshing around. Distressing, but not painful. He felt his weight shift again too. He still felt a little bottom-heavy, but now something was pulling his chest forward. His hair was growing too, spilling across his eyes. His clothes felt more comfortable now at least, although still pretty tight.<br />
<br />
The cartoonish squirrel Dan had been talking to gave a really exaggerated wolf whistle as the changes finished, which confirmed the obvious. She stood up, brushing a stray bit of hair from her vibrant green eyes, and smoothed out her form fitting cocktail dress. She couldn&#39;t deal with this, she needed a drink.<br />
<br />
Making sure she had her handbag she sashayed out of the break room and down a few side streets, turning the heads of every man who saw her, naturally. Eventually though she reached her destination, the grandest casino in the whole resort. Once she reached the high rollers section she knew she&#39;d have a drink in hand from some admirer or other, and it gave her a chance to keep an eye out for anyone who might be poking his nose into her boss&#39; plans.<br />
<br />
She had a couple drinks, blew on a few sets of dice for luck, and brought the chips she &#39;earned&#39; to the blackjack tables to play a hand or two, and that&#39;s where she saw... him. Just the absolute perfect specimen of manhood. So virile, so confident, hitting on a 19. Their eyes met. She asked his name, she asked hers, and barely raised an eye when she told him, &quot;Ivana Ridette.&quot; She could hardly think, looking at this man! So suave! So mysterious! Not like any of the boring playboys usually found here. Was that suspicious? Was he here to look into her boss&#39; plans perhaps? She&#39;d just have to tail him and learn more. Stick to him everywhere he went... follow him to bed, even. She quickly lost herself in fantasy. While she wasn&#39;t shy about hooking up with the guests here from time to time, she couldn&#39;t remember ever being this horny. Eventually the mysterious alpha male her eyes were locked on was approached by security for simply winning too much. A fight broke out. She grabbed him by the arm to flee, bringing him to her private room by way of the staff elevator. Their hearts were both beating a mile a minute and they made the most intense passionate love right there on the spot.<br />
<br />
The next morning she started the shower, but secretly listened at the door. It was true, he WAS a spy. Quickly showering she stepped out in only a towel, lulled him into a false sense of security, and pulled the gun she always kept in her nightstand... but she just couldn&#39;t shoot him! Even faced with death, he had such cleverly seductive words about her body, and the night before he&#39;d given her absolutely the most intense orgasms of her life! She sighed. There was simply no choice but to defect and help him with his mission.<br />
<br />
They traveled to a number of exciting exotic locations over the next few days, and eventually put an end to her... former employer&#39;s plans with the moon laser. They made love one final time, her riding him as they both road the G-force test machine, ignoring his calls to report on his mission...<br />
<br />
... and then suddenly, with a final passionate kiss, he left her. &quot;That was fantastic... I&#39;d take you with me, but I&#39;m married. Give me another couple months though and we&#39;ll have to do this again. She was shocked and confused, chasing after him and begging to know what this life of his had to offer over her perfect body, right up until the moment he left the resort.<br />
<br />
Feeling a tad embarrassed, as she had ended up chasing him in a barely tied bathrobe after all, she ducked into a nearby door to find something else to put on. And as she got changed and took a seat, it once again dawned on her that her name was Dan, she&#39;d taken a job at this resort just a few days ago, and... she&#39;d really just... spent the past few days in the body of a woman having constant animalistic sex with some repugnant CEO who was too into spy movies. She ran to the nearest sink to empty her stomach, and it wasn&#39;t due to nanites wanting out this time.</p>
