<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Hey!&quot;<br />
<br />
You hear a gruff voice call out between the city crowd. The clanking of armour heard as two knights rush towards you. The first you immediately recognise, the bear knight, his heavy musclegut shown alongside his armour as he stands before you. By his side, a small rat beast. The rat taking a moments breath, before the bear wraps an arm around him. You think you recognise this man, the rat being the former prisoner that the bear claimed. The bear turns to the rat, a loving look in his eyes before his attention is set to you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nate, right? You were a real pain, you know that?&quot;<br />
<br />
The bear laughs, continuing. <br />
<br />
&quot;Just joking of course, glad you&#39;ve decided to join us. Riefclaw&#39;s already told us you&#39;re an upcoming general, so I thought I&#39;d show you around, if that&#39;s alright.&quot;<br />
<br />
You go to rebut his claim.<br />
<br />
&quot;N-&quot;<br />
<br />
The bear immediately interrupts you before you can even finish your first word. Your arm roughly grabbed as he begins to drag you forward, the rat following closely.<br />
<br />
&quot;GREAT! Names Drale by the way, this little rat here is my squire, Riste. Great little guy, perfect size for fucking, while also being flexible enough to reach whatever part I want him on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Drale scratches the back of Riste&#39;s ear, the rat smiling, in a moment of bliss as the two once again connect eyes. Though this rat was made due to a moment of pure lust, there seems to be genuine love between the two men now. Drale continues to talk about what he likes best about Riste, you being forcefully led around the city as you see building after building. Even catching glimpses of the back alley that started this all. Eventually the bears ramblings end, the man asking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Got any questions? We&#39;d be happy to answer them.&quot;<br />
<br />
You think, this is a good opportunity to ask about everything and anything. Your mind first goes to Riste, he was a human like you, how is he holding up? Is he okay with all of this? Does he like Drale? What&#39;s his plan now?<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, a few. Though they&#39;re mainly about Riste.&quot;<br />
<br />
Riste seems surprised, jumping for a second as Drale&#39;s hand finds itself home on his head. Riste relaxing before nodding, you asking your first question.<br />
<br />
&quot;So Riste, how do you feel? You&#39;re a beast now, so is it all... good?&quot;<br />
<br />
Riste nods.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, I&#39;ve never been happier in my life! I was a simple farmer when I was captured, and scared senseless of my captors. But... after my lips pressed against Drale&#39;s pits, I just felt myself overwhelmed. I took in his musky scent, I lapped at his fur and tried to take as much of him as I could. Obeying my commander and lover as best I could, stroking his dick as he demanded, before moving my lips to his pecs. I was so sad when we had to break our lovemaking, chasing after you so that you could experience the pleasure I did. After everything settled, I was overjoyed at what I became. A swift and sexy rat, in service and in love to my hunk of a bear.&quot;<br />
<br />
You&#39;re rather thankful that you were never caught by this pair, another question emerging.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... what now? Are you going to continue your duties as a knight?&quot;<br />
<br />
Riste thinks for a moment, before smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course. I am a squire now, and when my training is finished I will be a full knight. I&#39;m enjoying my new line of work, especially the scheduled expedition next month.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your head turns, expedition? What are they planning? Seeing your confusion, the bear clears his throat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, don&#39;t know yet? We&#39;ve decided to raid Riste&#39;s village for our next batch of converts. Riste&#39;s looking forward to seeing his old friends again, especially if that spell Jargus thought of ends up working?&quot;<br />
<br />
Your eye&#39;s go wide, trying to hide your shock as much as possible. Riefclaw doesn&#39;t care about ending this, he wants to spread as much as possible. He wants every village to be full of beasts, and Yuriv does now as well? You barely manage to ask your final question. The question only emerged after your recent information.<br />
<br />
&quot;What spell? I haven&#39;t heard of that either.&quot;<br />
<br />
Drale gives you a rough pat on the back, your surroundings now changing as you approach a district with far more knights. A stone building ahead as two men stand guard. The men briefly nodding towards Drale as he returns the nod and enters the building. The conversation continuing. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, remember the weakness of our curse? Can&#39;t change women. Jargus was thinking that might change if he can make a women into a man, get it? It&#39;s only a theory and might not even work, but it&#39;s real exciting! Plus, he even said he might be able to stop us from aging. Give us that stronger curse that the king has!&quot;<br />
<br />
At this point you&#39;ve heard far too much. You weakly try to step away, but Drale tightens his grasp. The bear once again having a jolly laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, come on Nate. We&#39;re almost where I wanna take you!&quot;<br />
<br />
Once again, you&#39;re dragged forward. Riste seeming a bit concerned as you&#39;re dragged around by the bear, but the concern quickly vanishing as you hear a group of cheers. Your eyes now taking in your surroundings, a room full of 15 knights, each fully naked and sitting. Stroking themselves as they share a drink and talk. Servants filling the mens drinks and cleaning whatever mess they make. Several tables already stained with seed. Drale lets go of you, the bear taking off his armour in a hurry as Riste begins to do the same. The two undressing themselves, before undressing you. Your naked form matching the other men in the room, though something else is missing... the pendant!<br />
<br />
You can see Riste holding it, smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll give it back after. This is something special after all!&quot;<br />
<br />
Something special? You look around the room, the knights strangely familiar to you. It takes a second to connect the dots, but these are the other prisoners, or at least some of them. The knights all begin to stare at you, one of them calling out something so quickly that you miss it. Servants disappearing from the room, before reappearing. In their grasp is a human, completely naked and shivering. You can see it in his eyes, he&#39;s lust crazed and desperate. A hand lands on your shoulder, it&#39;s Drale, the man grinning.<br />
<br />
&quot;We caught this one recently, Riefclaw said you should be the one to break him in. Go in, have your fun!&quot;<br />
<br />
You stare at the man. You can&#39;t convert him, you can&#39;t.... or can you? Ever since he entered the room you&#39;ve just felt so damn horny. You need to put your dick in something, in him. It&#39;s just natural right? proper? Beasts are meant to fuck men, so you should do just that. No wait, you don&#39;t want to make a man a beast, it&#39;s wrong, it&#39;s... is it wrong? He&#39;s already lust crazed, better you turn him then another man. No, you could help him escape you could fuck him all night long as he grows fur and-<br />
<br />
&quot;Nate, what&#39;s wrong? Come on, your dicks already throbbing. Just let the beast take over, it&#39;s real easy after that.&quot;</p>
