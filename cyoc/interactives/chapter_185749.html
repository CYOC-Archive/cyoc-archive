<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Your room pretty much looked as you left it before heading out to the Vaxer home. When you&#39;d left you hadn&#39;t said why you left, just that you were going to the Vaxer&#39;s and left things to your parents to assume that you were there to visit Luna. The bed was modest and simple with dark blue blankets. There was a small end table between your bed and the wall on which there was a lamp that was painted to look like a coral reef. There was a modest desk, where you remembered doing much of your homework. On the other side of your bed there was a mixed dresser and bookcase where you had some books on the shelves. Most were some fantasy novels that related to things like Dungeons and Dragons, or at least fit within that theme. As you collected a few things, you noted Roxie taking a look in some of the books.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know... I think we got Luna some of the same books,&quot; Roxie said off hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nicki and I have always liked the same sorts of adventures,&quot; Luna commented as the two of you looked into your closet and looking at the clothes that were there, &quot;knights slaying dragons and fighting evil wizards.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And often had everyone having fun,&quot; you agreed.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you wouldn&#39;t want to keep these?&quot; Roxie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;If Luna has the same books... we don&#39;t need extra copies,&quot; you replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;True,&quot; Roxie and Kellie both nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Though, I&#39;d think you could probably use some of these shirts,&quot; Luna said to you, &quot;they won&#39;t fit right now as we&#39;re transformed... but they&#39;ll probably cover you well enough in human form.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You think so?&quot; you asked to her as Luna took out a shirt that had your high school&#39;s mascot on it. It wasn&#39;t your favorite shirt, but every senior got one when they graduated and thus you got one the past May.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, you&#39;d look good in them,&quot; Luna smiled, &quot;and they&#39;d be great for days when we&#39;re just around the house.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll probably still need more formal wear, underwear, and things that you could &quot;work&quot; in without attracting too much attention,&quot; Kellie commented, &quot;including things like college... Though, Roxie and I can help with that.&quot;<br />
<br />
You nodded for a moment. You and Luna had both gone to the same high school and graduated, but it was about there where your academic similarities ended. You&#39;d done okay, but never good enough to earn a real scholarship to a major college. The town had a small community college where you could get the same sort of education that regular colleges would have, and for a cheaper price, and you were accepted there for the coming fall but that was due more to financial needs than anything else. Luna wasn&#39;t the smartest in high school, but she had done well and a part of you had expected her to have applications out to some of the bigger colleges in the state. It thus came as a great surprise to you when college discussions came up a week or so ago and she stated that she had chosen the same community college. A part of you now wondered if some of that was related to Luna being a born MILF-wolf.<br />
<br />
You took a few of the shirts and then placed them in the duffel bag, with them folded neatly. Your wallet, ID cards and drivers license were all in one of the front pockets as you hadn&#39;t carried them when you&#39;d gone out earlier. You figured you&#39;d also pack a few sets of socks, they might fit your human form, and your shoes were already at the Vaxer home. There were a few other things that the four of you sorted through a few other things. The only other thing that was thought to take was a PlayStation and some of the games. It&#39;d been something you&#39;d gotten for your fifteenth birthday and it was something that you and Luna had played on from time to time. A part of your mind even thought that yours and Luna&#39;s daughter might want to play with it. But there wasn&#39;t much else that was in the bedroom that you could want. You were about to say that you&#39;d gotten everything from the room when there came a soft tap on the door. It made you turn back to see your father in the doorway with a large fireproof box.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve taken the liberty of putting the identification forms you need in here...&quot; your father announced, &quot;and kept them here as you&#39;ve grown up. Your birth certificate, passports, the billing and paperwork for the college, your medical records and so on. Not to mention the selective service paperwork that you had to fill out... I assume that&#39;s the key things you wanted access to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In the long term, yes,&quot; you nodded, knowing now that you wanted to be with Luna for as long as you could. And with her being pregnant, a part of you now felt responsible.<br />
<br />
Your father nodded and then looked to Roxie, Kellie, and Luna for a few moments. You had brought them with you in case there was a more confrontational response from your father when you got to the door of what had been your home. However, your father had, once he was convinced that the MILF-wolf you had become was you, responded in a way you didn&#39;t expect. He didn&#39;t shout and he didn&#39;t rant, which you had on occasion heard him do about certain elements of politics he didn&#39;t like, at least until your stepmother got him to calm down. That was what you expected from your father, at least when confronted by the fact that you&#39;d felt you were supposed to be female and had Luna turn you into a MILF-wolf to be female. But he didn&#39;t. He was remarkably calm and even apologized for anything that he might have done that would make you uneasy. It was the last thing you expected.<br />
<br />
&quot;Could I have a few moments in private with my so... daughter?&quot; your father then asked as he looked to the others.<br />
<br />
Roxie looked to Kellie and the two then moved. Luna wanted to stay by your side, you could see that as Kellie took Luna by her other arm and escorted Luna out.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll be out in the living room should you need anything,&quot; Kellie said to you and lead them out. They ducked through the doorway and moved down the hall.<br />
<br />
After they left, your father slowly made his way in. He placed the box beside the duffel bag before turning to look at you. It was in an odd way for you now to look down to him. He was taller than you were in human form, but given how much you&#39;d grown, particularly in the final part of your transformation into a MILF-wolf, you now towered over him. You could look down to see where his hair was thinning. It also changed other perceptions, as your father had always been a fit man and one that you most saw as what was to be expected from a man. Broad shouldered, a deep chest, and a deeper voice, many of the things you weren&#39;t as a normal human. In fact it had been pretty clear that you had physically taken more after your mother than your father.<br />
<br />
&quot;I won&#39;t pretend I know everything about this...&quot; your father began, &quot;but... you&#39;re sure you want to leave?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure that I love Luna, dad,&quot; you said, &quot;it only took until tonight to actually get the courage to actually admit it and find out that she felt the same way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But... to leave the house...?&quot; your father asked, &quot;at eighteen?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It isn&#39;t like it&#39;ll be that far away,&quot; you answered, &quot;and the only other option would be for her to move in here. And I&#39;m sure the last thing you want is to hear two MILF-wolves make love at night.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your father didn&#39;t quite answer to that and the look he gave you gave an indication that he wasn&#39;t necessarily keen on the idea of you living a girl/girl relationship, even if you&#39;d gotten Luna pregnant to become a girl. You also hadn&#39;t explained what Roxie had explained that a MILF-wolf&#39;s mothering instincts could lead to you looking to be with male werewolves in the future. A lot of that was something that you didn&#39;t want to get into and your father didn&#39;t need to know. Partially as you were hesitant to think about what might happen in the future.<br />
<br />
&quot;And in the end... the key thing is love,&quot; you said, &quot;regardless of what you think of same sex couples or transgender issues... the love between me and Luna is real. She&#39;s been the only girl in school that ever gave me the time of day and whom I felt comfortable with.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve never had issues with same sex couples,&quot; your father insisted, &quot;if two women want to be together in private, that&#39;s THEIR business. The thing that I have issues with is gay marriage. Marriage is a part of all religious services and they&#39;ve been against homosexuality. And you&#39;re not going to change my mind on that.&quot;<br />
<br />
This was closer to what you&#39;d expected from your father earlier.<br />
<br />
&quot;But that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m out to stone people or anything like that,&quot; your father spoke, &quot;there are a lot of things that I will hold onto quite firmly.&quot;<br />
<br />
You looked to him as he moved the fireproof box and your duffel bag bag on the bed and then patted the bedspread before sitting down.<br />
<br />
&quot;And one of those things is you,&quot; your father spoke, &quot;I won&#39;t pretend I know everything or understand everything. And while I would disagree with the people who say there&#39;s more than two genders or anything like that... that doesn&#39;t mean that I don&#39;t love you and would want to lose you. Your mother always said you were fair... and maybe she meant something I didn&#39;t see... but regardless, we&#39;d both agreed that you were precious. And regardless of my politics, that doesn&#39;t change that I will love you as a good father should.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s nice, dad,&quot; you said to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;But it also means I don&#39;t want to lose you,&quot; your father replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you won&#39;t,&quot; you told him, &quot;yeah... I&#39;ll be going to live with the Vaxers... but that&#39;s to be with Luna. And for the next four years, at least, we won&#39;t be that far away. I&#39;m sure you and &quot;mom&quot; can come by and join us for dinner some nights. We&#39;ll be going to the community college here. You&#39;ll get to see your granddaughter when she&#39;s born. Luna and I wouldn&#39;t be moving into our own house until after we&#39;ve graduated from the college and start moving forward. So you won&#39;t be losing me. I&#39;ll still be around... Different than before, but still around.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It still seems early for me,&quot; your father commented, &quot;and becoming a father at your age... wouldn&#39;t that be irresponsible?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe,&quot; you admitted, &quot;but I knew I wanted to be a MILF-wolf... if only to put myself in the right gender. And Luna wanted a child that would be a combination of me and her. So... now was the time. As once I became a MILF-wolf... I wouldn&#39;t be able to father a child. And Luna&#39;s parents have offered their help. And we wouldn&#39;t be that far away if you and &quot;mom&quot; want to help as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
The reference to &quot;mom,&quot; was often rather odd for you. Abigail Druthers was a bright and kind woman whom your father had met a year after your biological mother had died of cancer. The story goes that she came into the bank where your father worked to get a business loan and they hit it off. Your father carried the paperwork and helped her through it which saw the loan approved. After that, he made some way to see her personally and they moved on from there. They got along and it grew into a loving relationship, and it was nice. You liked her, but you&#39;d never really figured out the right way to address her. &quot;Mom&quot; worked, but sometimes that felt like betraying your biological mother, but at the same time, you didn&#39;t know her well enough to go by her first name. You eventually settled on &quot;mom,&quot; but using a slightly different tone of voice to indicate the difference between Abigail and your biological mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can both still be there,&quot; you said to him, &quot;but I want to live my life with Luna... to be with my mate... the woman I&#39;ve loved... even before I knew I did love her.&quot;</p>
