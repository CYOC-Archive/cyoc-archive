<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chris’s whole body hurt; it was painful enough that he didn’t want to open his eyes. It wasn’t a sharp pain but a dull pain which seamed to come from every point of his body. The closest thing he could think of to this was back when he was in High School, the 1st morning after the 1st two-a-day practice in football. Those morning would always hurt, but he wasn’t in high school anymore…no he was almost 30 and had to get up for work. But everything just hurt, and the bed felt so big and so warm. <br />
<br />
He knew he had fallen asleep again, how come his alarm hadn’t gone off. He would be late for work for sure he knew and then he remembered. He had come down with the monster flu, he was becoming a fairy and had a good chance of becoming a female fairy on top of everything. Now he really didn’t want to open his eyes, he tried to figure out what was going on with his body just by how it felt but it only hurt. He was tempted to move his arms and legs, but he was too scared to do that. Finally, he opened his eyes. <br />
<br />
The room was still dark but when he moved his head slightly, he could see the light from a window. It seamed very far away. <br />
<br />
“I think he is awake.” Said a voice as the lights turned on and everything seamed far away. The room walls where so far away and the ceiling looked as high as the clouds. He felt the blanket which seamed heavier pulled away and then a second blanket get pulled away. Strange he had only a thin blanket on the bed when he went to bed.<br />
<br />
“It’s alright…you are going to be alright; I know it is strange.” said a second voice as Chris turned to see a woman’s face…but it wasn’t a woman per say. The face was clearly female but the ears where very long and pointed. Her short bubblegum blonde hair was tied back in a pony tale and her eyes where a deep impossible blue. Her wings, butterfly like wings where see through but a gave off a neon blue tint. She wore a deep green top with an open back because of her wings and a blue skirt. Her shoes where high heeled but didn’t seamed all that used. He looked at her for a moment.<br />
<br />
“Hello Chris, I am Kai I am here to help you along.” Said Kai as she looked toward the other side. Chris turned his head to see another fairy, this one with four dragon fly wings, her long curly hair a deep impossible rich brown, her wings also butterfly like but had gold and brown mixed in. Her ears where not visible behind that rich hair but she looked human enough. She wore a green almost flower dress but once again it was open back.<br />
<br />
“Hello, Chris I am Lisa, I am here to help you as well.” Announced Lisa “Now…I know it is hard but you need to look down at yourself.”<br />
Chris didn’t want to do it but summoning his courage he looked down. His eyes widened and his head snapped back up. He didn’t want to face it, he couldn’t face it. He felt a pair of tiny hands on his shoulders as he looked down. That second blanket had been his hospital gown, it was now a giant before him. That didn’t concern him as much as the other changes.<br />
<br />
He was a still a man, if one could call it that. His penis was tiny, a micro penis, his body had begun to shift his legs lengthening and slandering same with his arms. He looked at them for a moment, they where clearly not male and well on the way toward female. His weight was still there somewhat but he looked like he had dropped at least 30 pounds. He knew it had to be more, he was tiny after all but that is what he thought. There coming out of his chest where a pair of budding breasts. He was becoming a she, there was no question, he was becoming a female fairy.<br />
<br />
He was overwhelmed with emotions as tears began to form around his eyes. <br />
<br />
“It’s ok…we all did it…it is ok to cry.” Reassure Kai as both she and Lisa sat down on either side of Chris placing their hands on his shoulders as he began to cry.</p>
