<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“And I wish I had bigger boobs!” Ellie wished, James sighed,<br />
“I knew that was gonna be your first wish,” he said,<br />
“You know I’ve always wanted bigger boobs,” Ellie said, “OH I can feel them!” She said, “there’s a pressure…” she said. Looking down at her chest, it was rising. From her angle she was looking right down her top, “I can see my cleavage!!!” She said excitedly,<br />
“How big did you want them?” James asked,<br />
“Pretty big. Not like the size of my head or anything, but big,” she explained, feeling her bra tighten as they expanded,<br />
“I have no idea what I want to wish for…” James said, his focus elsewhere,<br />
“Hey!” Ellie yelled, catching James’ attention, “watch my boobs grow!!” She complained, wanting maximum attention. She pulled her shirt down to show off her slowly increasing cleavage. James’ eyes went wider,<br />
“Oh wow, they really are growing,” he said, almost unable to look away,<br />
“Don’t get too comfortable, sunshine!” Ellie said, pulling her shirt back up playfully.<br />
<br />
By the time they’d stopped growing, they were at the very least an E cup. Their shape didn’t seem to change shape, they just grew larger,<br />
“Maybe they could be a bit rounder… and fit into my bra better,” she examined,<br />
“You sure your bra isn’t a little tight?” James asked, looking at the very strained bra from underneath her shirt,<br />
“I guess so,” she said. She shrugged her shoulders and reached back, unhooking the bra and taking it off. After her new boobs fell, they pushed against her top, showing the actual change in size,<br />
“Man they looks way bigger,” James stated, casually glancing at her piercing nipple through the shirt, trying his best not to stare,<br />
“They’re a lot heavier, I’ll be honest,” she said, lifting them through the front of her shirt, “I kinda wanna make them bigger…”<br />
“Seriously?” James asked, “they’ll look weird on your body,”<br />
“Then I guess I’ll change my body!” Ellie said, “now c’mon! I’m waiting for your wish!!”<br />
<br />
“O-oh right… uhm,” James stuttered, “I have no idea what to wish for,”<br />
“You can literally have anything in the world, and you don’t know what to choose?”<br />
“It’s a big decision!!”<br />
“Well I wished for bigger boobs, so you wish for a bigger dick!”<br />
“WHAT!?” James shouted higher than he knew he could, “w-where did that come from!?”<br />
“What?” Ellie asked, “you watched my tits grow right in front of your eyes. It’s basically the same,”<br />
“You didn’t make your pussy grow!”<br />
“That’s not the same thing!!” Ellie snapped back,<br />
“Yeah it is!” James said, “no no no, I wish my body was back to how it was before… with a little more muscle than usual,” he wished.<br />
The two watched as James’ body reduced back to a more familiar size,<br />
“Bullshit,” Ellie said, “you really chose to go back from super muscular with a bigger dick, to just slightly ‘toned’,” she said with a look of disappointment, “that’s dumb,”<br />
“I didn’t like being that muscular,” James said, “and my dick is fine how it is. I’m good!”<br />
“Whatever,” Ellie said, genuinely quite disappointed.<br />
<br />
The two sat there in silence, James now back to a slimmer (but still somewhat toned) size. Ellie sitting with a pair of generously sized breasts. She finally broke the silence,<br />
“I wish your dick was 12 inches long,” she mumbled,<br />
“What did you say?” James said, “d-don’t tell me you—” he started, but didn’t need to finish. He could feel it in his underwear already, his cock was already getting longer, “w-what the hell is wrong with you!” James yelled, feeling his meat growing about half-an-inch per second,<br />
“Nothing!” Ellie said, “you weren’t gonna experiment, so I did it for you,” she said casually,<br />
“I really hate you sometimes,” he said, rolling his eyes, trying to avoid the pleasure he was feeling from the changes,<br />
“Oh come on!” Ellie said, “Show me!!” She asked, “you got to watch my tits grow,”<br />
“Through your shirt!” James snapped back.<br />
Ellie gave him a challenged look. She grabbed her top and pulled it over her head, allowing her bare breasts to be seen by the world. James sighed. This wasn’t the first time he’d seen her topless,<br />
“I’m not taking my pants off,” he said bluntly,<br />
“God you’re such a pussy!” She shouted at him,<br />
“Oh I’m such a pussy? I wish your pussy was at least three times bigger!”<br />
<br />
James didn’t realise what he’d said until after he’d said it. Both him and Ellie went red in the face, until Ellie let out a moan of pleasure as she grabbed at her crotch, “E-Ellie I didn’t mean to wish that…” he said. She wasn’t focussed on anything he was saying. He could feel his dick coming to a halt, a lot bigger than he was used to. He didn’t even want to touch it,<br />
“I-I wish…” Ellie tried to say, breathing heavily as her pleasure continued, “I wish your dick was so hard it burst out of your pants!”<br />
<br />
“Oh for fuck—” James started but suddenly moaning with pleasure. His cock pushed against his jeans immediately, without much effort it popped the button and broke the zipper. His underwear didn’t stand much chance as it ripped right through it, revealing his giant 12 inch monster of a cock, “h-holy… sh-shit,” he let out behind his shaky breaths,<br />
“T-that is what you get… bitch…” she said, panting but letting a devilish smirk through.<br />
James looked at Ellie. She had huge naked tits, a massive swollen pussy. There were a few things that could, and most likely would end up happening here. Despite his pleasure and lust, he knew better than to fuck his best friend.<br />
<br />
“I wish neither of us are attracted to each other!” He said, hoping it’ll avoid any unfortunate issues.<br />
<br />
—<br />
<br />
“W-what did you wish for?” Ellie asked. But before she could say anything more, she suddenly felt herself changing. She looked down and watched as her breasts started deflating like balloons. They continued to sag until they were almost pancake-like. Soon-after, her body started to age drastically. She went from 18 to 81 within the span of about 30 seconds. She was wrinkled and ugly, genuinely really unattractive in all senses of the word, “what did you do…” she said, letting out a shaky breath, “I feel ancient,” she said. But once her focus shifted to James, she realised where he went wrong.<br />
<br />
James was regressing, his cock shrinking rapidly and losing it’s hardness within seconds. Before long, he was suddenly aged about 13. Then 10. Then 8. He finally ended at age 6, looking exactly as he did at that age,<br />
“Oh no…” he said in his young voice, “I thought it would make us not like each other… but now we too old or too young to like each other,”<br />
<br />
“A-alright…” Ellie said, “I-I wish we were both back to the way we started. Both eighteen years old… back to normal,” she finished.</p>
