<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Yes, thank you.&quot;  I pocketed my keys and eased what was left of the bag on to the ground. &quot;Could you gather the oranges?  I think some rolled under the car.&quot; I focused on the other spilled items.  No kotex or panty liners peeking out of the heap of junk food I'd impulse-bought, thank god!<br />
<br />
&quot;Orange wrangler, check!&quot; <br />
<br />
He stepped next to me and bent way down to look under the car.  I couldn't help but check out his butt as he did.  Nice, very nice.<br />
<br />
&quot;They've all rolled into a pothole on the far side.&quot; He said. &quot;You've got something in the trunk to put them in?&quot;<br />
<br />
I felt a quiver in my belly each time he spoke, like his words were tapping out a rhythm inside me.  I remembered belatedly that I'd brought some Eco-friendly hemp bags intending to use them in the store.  I wiped my hands on the hem of my sweatshirt and stepped away, suddenly aware how close we'd been standing.<br />
<br />
&quot;I, yes, I'll get some.&quot; I hurried to the trunk and fumbled the keys out of the pocket of my jeans.  &quot;Some bags!  For the fruit!&quot;  I bit my lip and blushed furiously as I jammed the keys into the lock.  Oh god, I hope he didn't think I'd just called him a fruit!  My car began to honk as I popped the trunk and I realized I'd forgotten to turn off the alarm. <br />
<br />
My muscular Samaritan didn't even bat an eye as he followed me to the back of the car.  They were hazel I noted, with flecks of gold where the light hit them right.  His hair was sandy blond. long enough to brush his shoulders and worn loose under his crisp white stetson hat.  I blinked, realizing I'd been staring at him while my car alarm sounded.<br />
<br />
&quot;It'll shut off in a bit.&quot; He said. &quot;You found the bags in there?&quot;<br />
<br />
I became aware of the rough texture of the bags under my questing hand and sheepishly handed him one.  My car chirruped and the sudden silence felt more oppressive than the noise had.  I took the other bag and loaded the junk food into it, burying my tampons on the bottom where he wouldn't see them. <br />
<br />
He worked swiftly on the other side of the car.  Lucky thing the blacktop all sloped into the parking lot's one pothole, or the oranges might have gone everywhere!  We met back at the trunk and the breeze brought me a whiff of his aftershave and the warm leather of his jacket, mingled with bruised oranges.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, I feel so silly forgetting to take these in with me.&quot; I flipped my ponytail back over my shoulder, then mentally kicked myself for running to the store in my lazy Saturday clothes.  I hadn't expected to meet such a cute guy--I realized I was staring again, checking out his abs and tight pecs.  It dawned on me I was acting like some kind of love-struck teenager over a nice body and friendly manner.  No way was he more than being polite to the sloppy-dressed ditz who forgot her shopping bags.<br />
<br />
&quot;T'wern't no bother helping a pretty lady like you.&quot;  he looked me down to my sneakers and back up into my eyes. &quot;Pretty sexy too!&quot; He added.  He grinned at me under his mustache and I felt the quivering as he spoke spreading from my belly all the way up to my scalp, out to my fingertips, and down to the soles of my feet. I lowered my eyes, willing myself not to blush too much as I looked at him through my long eye lashes.  I pulled my shoulders back a bit too; the neckline of my silk blouse wasn't deep enough to show much cleavage, but at least he'd be able to see I had some decent curves. <br />
<br />
&quot;Still, you deserve some kind of reward.&quot; I said as I twirled a coppery curl of my long red hair around my finger. I shifted my weight to lean a little closer to him and tilted my head to the side to see how he'd respond.  <br />
<br />
Deep in the back of my mind I felt a different sort of quiver.  The kind that you feel when the monster's theme music starts up in the movie, but the camera is still panning through the scene and you're dreading the moment when it'll jump out at you.<br />
<br />
&quot;You've got the fixing's for a mighty fine meal here,&quot; he said gesturing at the bags of groceries and bottles of wine in my trunk. My belly continued to quiver as he spoke.  &quot;How about you take me home and fix lunch for us?&quot;<br />
<br />
I smiled widely and nodded, mentally inventorying the contents of the four bags in my trunk; artisan bread, olives, fancy cheese, a rotisserie chicken, fresh peppers, lots of wine...  It was a good thing he'd come along; I couldn't remember why I'd bought so much food for just myself.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Lets get going then,&quot; I said smiling up at him, &quot;I live nearby, and can't wait to get you home--for lunch!&quot;<br />
<br />
I marveled at myself as I turned and closed the trunk, giving him a nice view of my my ass in the tight skirt I was wearing.  Thank god I had on some high heels, though my derriere looked pretty good even without them.  Normally my attempts to banter with guys failed horribly, but today I was on fire! I peeked over my shoulder as I stood up, making sure to keep my shoulders back.  Yup, he was totally checking out my ass and titties, and seemed to like what he saw too!<br />
<br />
I rolled my hips as I walked up and unlocked the driver's door.  I bent way over again checking my makeup in the side mirror as I got in, giving him another look at my ass.  Mascara un-smeared, eyeshadow looking only a touch slutty, lips looking full and kissable, cheeks flushed without any need for blusher.  I wondered what his mustache would feel like if--when--we kissed?  I glanced down and saw my nipples were totally poking out against my blouse.  Who needs cleavage when you've got pokies?<br />
<br />
The unsettled feeling in the back of my mind was getting stronger.  I glanced at myself again as I popped the locks and wondered why I'd put on a sexy outfit and all this makeup to run to the store for oranges and snacks?  Hadn't I been wearing something different?<br />
<br />
I got distracted as he opened the passenger door and eased himself inside holding carefully onto his hat. He sat folded up in the passenger seat, knees jammed against the dashboard before moving the seat as far back as it'd go with a pained expression. &quot;It's roomier in here than you'd expect.&quot; He said.  <br />
<br />
This time the car shivered along with me as he spoke. &quot;Yeah,&quot; I said, watching the antenna and air freshener sway with the quivering.  &quot;It's full of surprises.&quot;  He stretched his legs out and moved the seat forward again. &quot;I'm glad you fit in here,&quot; I told him, &quot;I wasn't sure you would.&quot; The uneasy shiver was starting to pulse a warning down my spine, but I still couldn't put my finger on what was wrong.<br />
<br />
I twisted around and leaned over to look out the back window as I reversed out of the parking stall, giving him a look down my blouse for good measure. It occurred to me, hadn't I been wearing a sweatshirt when I was shopping? and maybe jeans? Had I changed in the store maybe? or borrowed those clothes while I was there?  The silk blouse was pretty thin after all, and the short skirt sure wasn't keeping my legs warm.  I flipped on a blinker and pulled out of the parking lot.<br />
<br />
&quot;I expect I'll fit nicely into all sorts of places you aren't sure I will.&quot; He said, and as I looked at him out of the corner of my eyes I felt the quivering settle itself between my legs and in my mouth and throat.  Forget about kissing, how was that mustache going to feel when he's going down on me!</p>
