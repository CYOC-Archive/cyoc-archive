<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff was making sandwiches when he heard the doorbell ring. Figuring it was one of the mothers come to pick up the kids, Jeff put down the knife, quick washed his hands and dried them on a dish towel before answering the door--his bare feet smacking against the hardwood. Jeff answered the door in his jeans and a t-shirt that he&#39;d thrown on after Mikey and Sharon had scurried up. Why had he been almost naked? Oh yeah... he&#39;d tried getting a quick fap in--and Sharon and Mikey had interrupted him.<br />
<br />
Jeff found Lisa Richards, Jimmy&#39;s mother (formerly wife), at the door. Lisa was a rather attractive forty-something brunette with a few streaks of gray hair framing her face. She gave a warm smile which showed her laugh lines on her face through her makeup.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Jeff, I hope Jimmy hasn&#39;t been causing too much trouble.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No problem at all. Come in and take a seat in the living room. Jimmy&#39;s upstairs with the rest of his buddies. I&#39;ll go get him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa took Jeff&#39;s offer and came in and walked over to the living room. Jeff meanwhile couldn&#39;t help but admire Lisa as she passed him. If only she were his age... well, she could be. Jeff hurried up the steps and quick took a detour into his bedroom. He had the Chronivac expand its scanning range and soon a profile with statistics for the 43 year old Lisa was available for him to edit.<br />
<br />
Jeff lowered her age to 17, like his, and hit enter--without thinking to edit her relationship with Jimmy. And once again the Chronivac had to interpret and reconcile making a teenager a mother to a four year old toddler. Jeff however didn&#39;t see the inevitable outcome of his game processing through the issues, and instead went over to fetch Jimmy.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile downstairs Lisa&#39;s gray streaks began to grow darker. The laugh lines and other signs of wear to her body slowly began to fade away, while Lisa felt unexpectedly aroused from the sensation of youthening.<br />
<br />
Jeff meanwhile had opened the door to Mikey&#39;s room to find the four preschoolers pushing cars into each other and making simulated crash sounds with their mouths.<br />
<br />
&quot;And then the explosion goes boom!&quot; exclaimed Jimmy excitedly as he rammed the toy sports car into Tony&#39;s toy truck.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jimmy, your Mom&#39;s here to pick you up,&quot; said Jeff<br />
<br />
&quot;Mommy!&quot; shouted Jimmy. He immediately dropped the toy sports car, got up and ran to the door. The moment he stepped out of the doorway the Chronivac&#39;s effect on him began to take shape, as weeks of age began to peel off of Jimmy. He was growing younger, but not so noticeably quick at the moment. It wasn&#39;t until Jimmy tripped and fell on his stomach and began to wail and cry that Jeff picked Jimmy up and noticed at first how much lighter he felt than he had expected--only for that expectation to disappear from his mind as his memories adjusted to thinking of Jimmy as Mikey&#39;s 3 year old friend, who was in the class beneath him and Tony and Sharon in preschool, but fun to play with on the playground.<br />
<br />
Jeff bounced Jimmy in his arms, and shushed him, trying to calm the screaming toddler who was kicking and banging his fists from having falling face first into the carpeted hallway. Eventually, about the time Jimmy&#39;s overalls disappeared and only a diaper appeared on his butt, Jeff was growing tired of trying to calm the terrible two year old and just decided to take him downstairs to his Mommy to calm him down. The toddler&#39;s kicking and punching grew less coordinated and weaker as Jeff took him down stairs and Jimmy left toddlerhood for babyhood.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what has my little man all upset?&quot; asked a voice once Jeff was back on the ground floor of the foyer. He turned his head to see a much younger Lisa, arguably only a few years older than him--perhaps in college? The young Lisa Richards seemed to have bigger breasts, which confused Jeff until he saw the now infant Jimmy paw at them and wail.<br />
<br />
&quot;No! No, Jimmy, now&#39;s not din din time!&quot; scolded the now definitely college co-ed to her tiny infant son who looked only a few months old.<br />
<br />
Jeff was about to offer to hold Jimmy for Lisa when suddenly he noticed something... odd about Lisa. Her belly was beginning to grow a bit bigger than it had been a few seconds--well of course Lisa hadn&#39;t yet lost the baby weight. She&#39;d only just gave birth a month ago, of course she wasn&#39;t back in top form for her senior year yet. Lisa then looked as though an odd sensation had passed over her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff, could you hold the baby? I feel... I feel weird all of a sudden,&quot; said Lisa as she handed the nearly newborn Jimmy over to Jeff.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; asked Jeff as he saw Lisa fumble with the belt of her pants before dropping them and her panties to expose her loins only for Jeff to be struck silent at the sight of what looked to be a tube poking out of Lisa&#39;s vagina--a tube that was only growing longer as more of it came out and dangled. It took Jeff a moment to realize that what that was was an umbilical chord. In a few moments, Lisa was going to be pregnant with Jimmy, who now definitely was a naked and messy newborn in Jeff&#39;s arms. The tube moved--unlike any sensible way a feeding tube should move. It seemed drawn to Jimmy&#39;s naval, and once it connected, Jeff knew there was nothing he could do but help Jimmy into his new home inside of Lisa.<br />
<br />
Curious, having been otherwise distracted through Andy&#39;s unbirthing and unknowingly missed the act, Jeff helped connect the tube to Jimmy, at which point the wailing from him ceased and Jeff felt the chord go taut as it now began pulling Jimmy closer to his Mommy. The first part of his body to make contact with Lisa was his feet, which eased into her pussy rather easily. Jeff was worried that Lisa would scream in pain--but to his surprise she was instead screaming as though she were having really great sex. Her orgasmic screams were really turning Jeff&#39;s own hormones up and on, causing his member to twitch to life, even if momentarily.<br />
<br />
Soon, Jimmy&#39;s head popped back into Lisa and her belly fully extended to a nine month&#39;s pregnant swelling. Jeff looked up at Lisa, his mind clouded with his horny hormonal teenage pheromones and turned on by the sight of his heavily pregnant girlfriend. Equally horny, Lisa leaned in and kissed Jeff, and the two began making out all the while Lisa&#39;s belly shrank and Jeff and Lisa tore at each other&#39;s clothes.<br />
<br />
It took Jeff and Lisa a little bit of time to navigate around her belly in order to get her clothes off. Jeff didn&#39;t want to even think what the hurdle that would be when the third trimester hit them. Soon they were naked and Lisa was riding Jeff&#39;s member while he laid back on the couch and thrust rhythmically. With each thrust Lisa&#39;s belly shrank until it was completely flat--all signs of stretch marks and fuller breasts having disappeared along with the belly. And then Jeff felt his penis quiver but instead of ejaculating he felt something sucked back into him which caused him to tremble and shiver for a few moments before squirting it back out, and the two teenagers went limp and panting from their elongated escapade.<br />
<br />
&quot;You should... babysit more often... Jeff, if it makes you... this frustrated...&quot; suggested Lisa.<br />
 <br />
&quot;I&#39;m just glad that none of the tots upstairs heard us,&quot; said Jeff.<br />
<br />
&quot;And why is that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Forget I said anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell me... you know you want to,&quot; urged Lisa.<br />
<br />
Jeff sighed as he sat up, &quot;Well, before you came, I was trying to... work out my frustration by myself when Mikey walked in on me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa began to snigger, to which Jeff responded by throwing a pillow at her, which caused her in turn to <br />
<br />
Unobserved by either, Sharon was up at the top of the steps, having come out when she&#39;d heard screaming. She looked down the stairs and into the living room to see Jeff and Lisa nakey and having what looked to her a pillow fight.</p>
