<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">(M/F sex because groping, and romance.)<br />
<br />
The man held up his hand to you and your body began tingling all over as you look up at being that can only be described as a large serpent with a humanoid upper body. He was 6&#39;7&quot; with his humanoid portion alone, and he had a tail that extended 17 feet behind him. His humanoid body was extremely muscular, but was covered with scales, and his head looked exactly like a snake&#39;s snout. His entire body was covered in pitch black scales, and his eyes were yellow with slitted pupils as he extended a hand with large five fingered claws towards you.<br />
<br />
The shackles holding your legs to the floor suddenly came opened up, but the snake quickly flicked his tail around and coiled it around your legs and waist. Soon your hands were freed and the snake using his tail alone lifted you upright, and you looked at him trying to pry the tail off of your body only to have your hands bound to your sides by his coils.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now now,&quot; The snake prince hissed,&quot;Why do you struggle? Why do you resist? Why do you cling to that horrid body of yours?&quot;<br />
<br />
You struggled against the tail as tan scales spread across your stomach and chest, growing darker as into a russet brown color. &quot;I...don’t want this!&quot; You growled at the snake and he paused then sighed looking disappointed.<br />
<br />
&quot;You poor poor creature, you may not think you want this, but your thought deceive you. That look in your eyes, those beautiful scales growing on your body, and soon your instincts will beg for the experience that I wish to give you.&quot; The snake said tightening his coils around your waist, and your legs suddenly felt numb and your feet almost like they were becoming one appendage.<br />
<br />
You continued to struggle as the scales started having an effect on your torso as they continued down your arms. Your body started losing its muscle, and your broad shoulders shrank into you as your waist grew wider to give you a prime set of feminine curves. &quot;You&#39;ll see my princess, I am nothing like the others here. In my arms you&#39;ll feel safe, passion, and irreplaceable in my kingdom. You&#39;ll be known by all, loved by all, cherished throughout all edges of my kingdom.&quot; The snake prince hissed then pulled you closer and whispered in your ear,&quot;Now, doesn’t that sound nice?&quot;<br />
<br />
You paused blushing a bit as you imagined all that, but then you looked down and noticed your nipples become erect, and flesh around them expanded out into mounds, or breasts. They weren’t very large, only A cups, but you felt them slowly filling up with milk by the second as your nipples turned pitch black, and you felt a strong tugging sensation on your balls and cock.<br />
<br />
You continued struggling and screamed,&quot;No! You can’t do this to me!&quot;<br />
<br />
The snake prince chuckled as you let out a soft moan feeling aroused by your shrinking masculinity, and you couldn’t quite feel or see the area which frustrated you. Your head then started slowly changing into the snout of a snake as your hair fell out onto the ground, your teeth all but disappeared from your mouth as the inside of your mouth felt smooth, except for two large fangs that sat hidden in the roof of your mouth. Your pupils changed into slits, and your sense of smell transferred to your tongue that became forked and flicked out every few seconds.<br />
<br />
The snake smiled as he stared into your new eyes as your ears shrank into nothing, and a large cobra hood stretched out and connected from the top of your head to the base of your neck. The hood extended past your shoulders measuring a width that would have probably matched the shoulder-to-shoulder width of your former broad shoulders. You still struggled as your body continued becoming more and more snakelike, and feminine by the second. Your breasts were now BB cups and still growing and you felt your legs now as a single appendage that poked out between the snake&#39;s coils as a tail. &quot;C&#39;mon c&#39;mon....!&quot; You hissed as you struggled, but you paused and suddenly blushed after hearing your voice. It had become shrill and feminine with a hint of sultry seduction to it, and the snake prince smiled as he saw you now.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve turned out more beautiful then I envisioned. Yes you are a wife that exceeds even my expectations.&quot; The snake hissed seductively as your tongue picked up a new scent from his body. It was a scent that grabbed your attention immediately, and it was one that displayed dominance, arousal, and it made him seem...attractive to you.<br />
<br />
You shook your head and hissed,&quot;Get out of my head you....you...!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You, what?&quot; The snake said teasingly then caressed your growing breasts that were easily approached D cups by now. You blushed as a foreign feeling of arousal appeared on your pelvis and the snake grinned and reached between his coils and gently felt along a large slit on your pelvis that made you feel horny.<br />
<br />
&quot;You....I....I can’t believe you.&quot; You replied to this blushing harder and the snake smiled and started to loosen his coils, freeing your hands. Immediately you pulled your hands up and examined their slender fingers, and long delicate nails.<br />
<br />
You then looked back to the snake and he opened his arms up and hugged you with his arms, and locked you into a passionate kiss. At first you refused this and tried to pull away, but something seemed to draw you into him and you accepted and embraced his love and returned his kiss with yours. There was ecstatic spark it seemed between you that lit a passionate fire in your heart for him at this moment.<br />
<br />
The two of you eventually stopped and looked into each other’s eyes now, him with confidence and passion, but you back with bewilderment and uncertainty. He then released you from his coils entirely and you examined your body for the first time and blushed. Your humanoid portion was 6&#39;2&quot; tall, and your tail extended back 15 feet more. Your breasts were now DD cups at least and were incredibly firm, but they jiggled with every move. Finally there was the large slit where your pelvis once was that just screamed femininity and your wide child bearing hips only added onto that.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is....weird...&quot; You commented looking to the tip of your tail and moving it around a bit.<br />
<br />
The snake then smiled and put an arm around your waist and took your hand and smiled. &quot;You&#39;ll get used to it more with time, as you will get used to being my queen.&quot; He exclaimed then in his other hand he produced a golden ring with a large amethyst on it, and he slipped it on your finger and smiled and said,&quot;My wife.&quot;<br />
<br />
You blushed at this then Janice slowly wandered up and hesitantly bowed to the snake, but remained silent. The snake turned to her and said,&quot;If a servant you are then a servant you shall be. I personally don’t have any use for a warm blooded mammal in my palace, however...&quot;<br />
<br />
The snake prince turned to you and smiled,&quot;I imagine you&#39;ll have much more use for her than me. I will make sure that you both receive the proper treatments as necessary. Now come, your new home awaits us. By all means to the fox, feel free to speak miss...Janice.&quot;<br />
<br />
Janice nodded to the snake and walked over to your side and smiled at you reassuringly and said,&quot;I&#39;m yours to command now, Lady...erm...&quot;<br />
<br />
The snake prince put his arm around your shoulder and looked to Janice,&quot;You may discuss a more fitting name along the way. But for now let’s get out to the carriages so that the other royal ruffians can have their fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
You paused and saw that the princes seemed to be indifferent towards this comment, although a couple looked at one another and talked secretively. The snake prince then started slithering forward and you watched him and slowly picked up on how to slither like he did, and you followed him out a large set of doors where he took you over to a couple of camel-drawn carriages.<br />
<br />
You paused and looked curiously at the camels, and Janice seemed equally confused until the snake prince turned around and said,&quot;Our desert oasis home is perfect for a serpent like yourself my dear. However, I will make sure that the guards provide your friend here with proper clothing, and plenty of water.&quot;<br />
<br />
You paused and thought to yourself,&quot;A desert huh?&quot; Then a single thought crossed your mind and you asked,&quot;Hey uh....&quot;<br />
<br />
The snake prince looked to you and a bit concerned and asked,&quot;Yes? Is something wrong my serpentine seductress?&quot;<br />
<br />
You blushed a bit and felt oddly flattered by his comment then you opened your mouth and said,&quot;Uh...may I know the name of my uh....husband?&quot; You blushed feeling awkward as the words escaped your from your mouth and the snake prince smiled and said,&quot;My name? Oh, how rude of me, apologies my dear wife. My name is Froid the third, prince of Umbrola. However to my dear wife has the humblest pleasure of referring to me as my simple name.&quot; He looked to Janice and said,&quot;You shall refer to me as royalty, his majesty, Prince Froid, however you wish, I don’t trust that royal fox&#39;s taste in titles. He was always a pompous and arrogant sort of ruler.&quot; <br />
<br />
Froid&#39;s tone was a sour as he referred to the kitsune prince, and you and Janice both seemed to take note of this. Froid then looked back to you and said,&quot;Please, give me but a minute to converse with my men, and we&#39;ll be off as soon as possible. Also, I apologize but as you may imagine with our lengthy bodies we must travel separately, it’s one disadvantage we have sadly. Janice shall travel with you, as her mistress respectively.&quot; You and Janice nodded to Froid and you watched him turn towards the two carriages and start conversing with drivers.<br />
<br />
You then looked down at your body again and blushed crossing your arms over your breasts feeling embarrassed. Janice watched this and put her hand on your shoulder then asked,&quot;Are you okay mistress?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mistre...Janice you don’t have to be formal with me.&quot; You hissed and Janice whined then looked over and Froid and said,&quot;Not...in private, but at least when he can hear us I must.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...okay then just please don’t call me that when we’re alone.&quot; You replied then Janice slowly nodded to you and sighed,&quot;I...I&#39;m so sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
Once you heard this you paused and noticed Janice looking distraught and saddened now, so you looked to her and asked,&quot;What’s wrong? Sorry for what exactly?&quot;<br />
<br />
Janice looked up at you and whimpered,&quot;I dragged you into this, I didn’t.....I didn&#39;t think about how this made you feel.&quot;<br />
<br />
You saw the distress in Janice’s expression and you sighed,&quot;Janice I.... it’s okay, I guess.... I mean at least you can make up for it right?&quot;<br />
<br />
She nodded to you and smiled a bit with her ears folded flat and said,&quot;Yeah...th-thank you, mistress.&quot;<br />
<br />
You sighed as you heard this again and groaned,&quot;Janice....call me....&quot; You paused trying to think of a new name for yourself and said,&quot;Tonya, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Janice smiled a bit more and bowed to you then she said,&quot;As you wish then, Lady Tonya.&quot;<br />
<br />
You sighed as she said this and replied,&quot;I guess I&#39;m okay with being called that.&quot; <br />
<br />
Froid then turned around and smiled at you then said,&quot;Preparations are complete, now allow me to assist you into the carriage.&quot; <br />
<br />
You paused then nodded to him and he guided you over to the carriage that would follow his and he opened the door then helped lift you up inside of the carriage by lifting your torso into the royal chassis. After you were inside you slowly pulled the rest of your body in as far as your tail was and managed to loosely coil yourself up next a window.<br />
<br />
The carriage was large but your tail seemed to take up most of the space, there weren’t seats as it was designed for snake-like creatures like you, and you watched Janice climb in herself and move to the opposite end, being weary as to not step on your tail.<br />
<br />
Soon there was a loud crack and the carriage started moving, and as it did you looked out the window and watched the building you were in move farther and farther away from you, and you felt comfort that you were at least far away from it. You then sighed and looked over to Janice and said,&quot;You don’t have to avoid me, I thought you were going to help me feel more comfortable as a woman.&quot;<br />
<br />
Janice paused and started crawling over your body, trying her best not to touch your tail until you patted an area next to your humanoid torso and said,&quot;You can sit down on my body, it’s okay by me if you’re casual with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Janice paused then breathed a sigh of relief and crawled up next to your torso and sat down on your tail. She then looked to your body and said,&quot;You look really good actually, heh...your breasts look bigger than mine.&quot;<br />
<br />
You looked down and blushed a bit then giggled nervously and said,&quot;They uh....certainly look that way. But...honestly what happened to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The same thing that happened to you, but....I&#39;m not a snake.&quot; Janice replied then you sighed and replied,&quot;No, I meant...ugh, what happened with you and that fox prince guy? He seems... you look like you were his slut.&quot;<br />
<br />
Janice blushed a deep red and smiled nervously before she replied,&quot;It....was a bit more complex than that...heh. But god he was a dream, until he uh...sold you, and well...me too.&quot;<br />
<br />
You raised your brow at this and asked,&quot;What do you mean by that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He took my virginity like this, and he fucked me about once or twice a month. I’m sure you already lost yours though, it’s been awhile since we last saw each other. So tell me...who’s the lucky gal?&quot; She asked<br />
<br />
All you could do was blush and sink down a bit into your coils and look outside as she said this. Janice&#39;s eyes then grew wide and whined,&quot;Oh...you poor soul, I&#39;m sorry, I shouldn’t have asked.&quot;<br />
<br />
You shook your head and sighed,&quot;No...I walked into erm....slithered into that one. It’s just, I&#39;m nervous more than anything, but....is it weird to be excited? Because uh....somehow the thought of...you know, just really turns me on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Janice giggled some then smiled and hugged you,&quot;Oh don’t worry, I felt like that too my first week, but after you find the courage to open up to your man you&#39;ll come out of your shell.&quot; She winked after she said this and you blushed then paused,&quot;Wait, you said you were fucked how often? Jake...err...Janice have you ever been...&quot; You we’re a bit embarrassed and hesitant to say what you were about to say,&quot;...pregnant?&quot;<br />
<br />
Janice shook her head and said,&quot;Nope, but now that I&#39;m not at the other palace, I probably could get knocked up by another fox.&quot;<br />
<br />
You gave her a puzzled look and just stared at her at this and she just added,&quot;Magic works in weird ways dear, you’re like this because of it after all!&quot;<br />
<br />
You looked down to your breasts and cupped one in your hand and sighed,&quot;Fair enough.&quot;<br />
<br />
The carriages eventually stopped and you looked outside to see the sandy desert ground and in the distance was a large sandstone palace. Froid opened the door and you made your way over to and he held out a hand to you and smiled,&quot;Shall we?&quot;<br />
<br />
You took his hand naturally and slithered down to him, and Janice followed shortly after. You then looked to Froid and asked,&quot;Uh...w-what do we do now?&quot;<br />
<br />
Froid paused for a moment to think then replied,&quot;........&quot;</p>
