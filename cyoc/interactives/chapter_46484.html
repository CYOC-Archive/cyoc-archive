<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Justin continued to look into the mirror, trying to wrap his mind around what was happening. After a bit, his thoughts returned to the wish and he thought to himself, &quot;This is because of the wish. I wanted it to be normal for me to wear girl's clothes and it has become normal. Only, in the process I am slowly turning into a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
Justin touched one of the hard nipples and then drew his hand away as a sensation rippled through his body and he realised that he liked having this nipples touched.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's sort of a turn on,&quot; Justin thought coyly.<br />
<br />
Pulling off the bra completely, Justin thought, &quot;This is not what I wanted. I didn't want to be a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
This thought in mind, he dumped the bra and then his shirt into a laundry hamper in the closet. Next he went to the dresser and withdrew from within a pair of Hollister sweat pants and a tight, white tee shirt.<br />
<br />
Stripping off his pants and then the thong, Justin dumped these two articles of clothing into the hamper as well and then returned to standing in front of the mirror.<br />
<br />
Reflected back, he saw something that looked both masculine and feminine. Yes he had breast, but at the same time he had a penis and testicles. And the longer he looked at the male genitals, the more Justin was convinced that they were smaller then what they where this morning when he left for school.<br />
<br />
Turning, Justin thought his hips and waist...plus his butt...looked a bit more developed and thought, &quot;It almost looks like a teenage girl's,&quot; as he remembered the sight of the girls from the swim meet earlier today.<br />
<br />
Facing forward again, he ran a hand through his hair, couldn't decided if it had changed and instead pulled on the sweats, liking for some reason the way the fabric felt against his skin. Next he pulled on the shirt, glad that his breasts weren't visible through the fabric, turned and left his room...wondering if his mother was home yet.<br />
------<br />
<br />
On the way downstairs, Justin stopped in the bathroom and what he did there nearly brought a scream to his lips as he, without giving it a second thought, sat down onto the toilet to pee.<br />
<br />
Bothered by this, wondering how best to reverse the situation, Justin finished, stood and went to wash his hands, not even realising that he had tucked his penis and testicles back and now looked even more like a girl.<br />
<br />
Turning to leave, Justin was immediately troubled by the reflection in the mirror on the back of the door. Mostly because he thought his face looked rounder and softer, while his lips appeared a little bit fuller. At the same time, Justin could have sworn that he had shrunk at some point.<br />
<br />
Trying to remember, he thought his height was something like five foot six, but now looking into the mirror, he figured that his height was something closer to five foot one.<br />
<br />
Confused, he opened the door and exited, not realising that he was walking in the same way a girl would.<br />
<br />
Down the stairs and into the kitchen he found the maid Emily preparing something for dinner. Upon looking over from what she was cooking and seeing Justin, the maid said, &quot;Good evening Ms Judy. I do believe your mother is in the living room, watching something on the TV. Dinner should be ready shortly.&quot; <br />
<br />
Nodding, Justin thanked Emily and exited, thinking that for some reason his voice sounded higher and more feminine. Walking toward the living room, Justin stopped halfway to the room when a strange sensation flooded his groin, abdomen and genitals. Thinking, &quot;What the...&quot; Justin clapped a hand between his legs and stumbled toward the downstairs bathroom.<br />
<br />
Inside, he immediately pulled his sweat pants down and nearly screamed out loud again at what he saw. Before his eyes, his genitals had turned a bright pink and were slowly shrinking. As this happened, a strange feeling, like something opening, could be felt inside his abdomen and groin area. Puzzled, Justin lifted his shirt, as if he could actually witness what was happening to him. Instead, all he saw was his stomach flatten completely, the pubic hair of his crotch vanishing...along with what little leg hair he had...and his genitals fold up and then get sucked into his body.<br />
<br />
As this occurred, the reproductive organs inside his body finished forming and began to pump out estrogen and other chemicals normal for a teenage girl...causing areas in Justin's brain to shift to something more feminine.<br />
<br />
But Justin failed to realise this as a slightly more pronounced vulva formed between his legs, giving him a slightly camel-toe look. As the vaginal opening and urethra formed last, Justin fully shifted started to think of himself as herself and that her name was actually Judy and not Justin. A pinching sensation and Judy immediately walked to the toilet, somewhat hampered by the sweats down around her ankles, and sat down.<br />
<br />
A spot of blood hit the water in the toilet and emotions began to well up. Instead Judy, reached behind her to the stand and hoping her mother remembered to by tampons, opened the cabinet just above the tank of the toilet.<br />
<br />
Tampon in place, Judy pulled her sweat pants back up and exited the bathroom, eager to talk to her mom about the swim meet and the event happening this weekend. As she left, she had one flitting moment and thought about the note, but decided that she was trying to remember something about Paul, the cute boy she had met after her swim meet. Thinking, &quot;He really is cute,&quot; Judy...sometimes called by her middle name, Jupiter, by her friends...floated down the hall and into the living room.</p>
