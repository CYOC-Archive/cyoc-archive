<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Thanks to Juan Tiller and Stormwolf for their contributions. Hope JLTF runs a real DND game here! </div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Man, that show was FANTASTIC!” Rusty said as they walked out of the auditorium. “Nothing like the magic shows I saw when I was a pup!”<br />
<br />
“I’ll admit, it was pretty impressive,” Rok said. “Some of the tricks were pretty damn cool.”<br />
<br />
“That kitsune magician, Akita, was amazing!” Todd said excitedly. “I can’t believe he made that illusion appear right in front of me! It was almost like I could reach out and touch it!”<br />
<br />
“As much as I’d like to keep discussing the magic show, we really need to start working out our plan,” Prime Xarxos said. He then turned to Todd and asked “So what are you going to do?”<br />
<br />
“I’d like to go check out that Maze, see if I can figure out a way to beat it.” Elf Mark said.<br />
<br />
“Yes.” Human Troy nodded. “We can totally assemble an adventuring party and run it.”<br />
<br />
“Sweet! This is gonna be fun!” Elf Mark cheered.<br />
<br />
Troy stared at them. No one was objecting to them being so foolhardy. Even his Xarxos was nodding happily. If Troy had been the one to suggest it, Xarxos would simply shoot the idea down or argue with him until Troy got tired.<br />
<br />
“Well, our Xarxos suggested that we go and scout out the casino first before gambling anything,” Todd explained. “He’s making sure that Mark and I are safe.”<br />
<br />
<i>Sounds like Xarxos,</I> Troy thought with a smirk.<br />
<br />
“I wouldn’t want anything bad to happen to my little foxes,” Fox Xarxos said, wrapping his arms around the two smaller foxes and kissing their heads. <br />
<br />
Troy stared at the foxes and fumed. Even <I>they</I> got more love from Xarxos than he did! Why wouldn’t his husband touch him? It wasn’t fair!<br />
<br />
“It seems like our plans are similar,” Prime Xarxos said. “How about we meet up later and discuss our findings? That way, we can all cover more ground and see how to beat these games.”<br />
<br />
“Sounds good to me,” Todd replied. “We’ll see you all later tonight then.” <br />
<br />
With that, the three groups broke up, going in different directions to cover more ground.<br />
<br />
Troy broke away from the group as everyone went about their business. With both Xarxos’ helping human him and Mark, buying as many spare chips as they could afford, they’d be safe. He walked around a bit, taking in the sights and sounds of the casino.<br />
<br />
Jealousy boiled in his chest as he watched other people cheering and having fun. Playing games, having a blast. He saw a couple holding hands and kissing and looked away, feeling rage welling up inside him.<br />
<br />
It all really did look fun. <br />
<br />
If only he was allowed to <I>have</I> fun. <br />
<br />
He had backup chips. Troy was probably safer than any patron in the building. Unfortunately, whenever he got close to a game or paused, considering joining one, he’d spot Xarxos hovering somewhere in the vicinity, trying to act discrete. The bull would duck or turn his head the moment their eyes met.<br />
<br />
Troy walked through the Body Floor and noticed Fox Xarxos arm wrestling against a dragonborn, muscles flexing under his crimson fur. Troy felt a bit flustered watching a younger version of his own minotaur sweeping the dragonborn easily, winning his chip. He spotted Fox Mark and Todd playing their own games, horse racing in VR.<br />
<br />
“Dude, my horse has a huge cock!” Mark said, wriggling his hips.<br />
<br />
“Mine too.” Todd groaned, groping air in front of him. “Man, I hope we get to fool around after the race is over!”<br />
<br />
Troy saw a space was open in the horse race. He made to put on the VR helmet when Xarxos beat him to it. Placing the helmet on his own head and shoving a chip into the slot, he turned and feigned surprise.<br />
<br />
“Oh, Troy, sorry!” Xarxos smiled guiltily. “Did you want to join?”<br />
<br />
Troy scowled. All the other VR headsets were already taken.<br />
<br />
“Oops, race is starting.” Xarxos turned away. “Whoa, I have a huge dick!”<br />
<br />
Troy clenched his fists and stormed away. He paused. Holy shit, the Minotaur would be stuck for a few minutes, he might actually be able to join a game!<br />
<br />
He took the stairs to the Floor of Mind two at a time. Troy spotted his human self with Elf Mark running a realistic DND game on a big screen next to footage of The Maze and The Battlefield. They were joined by people Mark had told them were part of his DND game from the office.<br />
<br />
The crowd observing them was small at first, but it grew larger as the party overcame their first obstacle and got into a fight with some cultists.<br />
<br />
The entrance to the game was a wooden Dungeon Door in a wall with DND written over the top. It cost a Mind chip to join. Troy tried to join them, but his chip kept getting rejected..<br />
<br />
“Sorry pal, that party is full.” A servant said. “You can wait for them to finish, but it usually takes a few hours.”<br />
<br />
Troy sighed and made his way over to a bench. The same bench he’d sat on when Dragon Dolan had met him last time. From here, he could see Fox Xarxos had made his way down to the Main floor and was playing Poker.<br />
<br />
“Gods, I wish ED was here.” Troy moaned.<br />
<br />
“You rang, my favorite caged bird?”<br />
<br />
Troy spun around.<br />
<br />
ED Dolan floated in the air next to him.<br />
<br />
“You were so distrusting last time, I’m surprised you wanted to see me again so soon.” ED smiled.<br />
<br />
“Why the fuck did you bring those two other versions of our group here to meet us?” Troy snapped his beak furiously. “It’s a huge disadvantage for you and a Reality Audit waiting to fucking happen.”<br />
<br />
“They are alternate versions of you. This is a Nexus.”<br />
<br />
“A Nexus?”<br />
<br />
“Haven’t you watched Dr. What?” ED Dolan rolled his eyes. “It’s a point in space and time where all realities converge. It keeps us safe from Auditors.”<br />
<br />
“And why let us meet them?”<br />
<br />
“Us?” ED smiled. “I intended for you to meet them. So you could see how twisted your Xarxos was in comparison. A real party pooper, am I right?”<br />
<br />
“More divide and conquer bullshit.” Troy shook his head. “He’s a planner. We need him. I’m not falling for this.”<br />
<br />
“That’s what you say.” ED smirked. “But your body language says otherwise. I saw the way you looked at Fox Xarxos. How he loved Todd and Fox Mark. So unlike your Xarxos.”<br />
<br />
Troy fell silent. <br />
<br />
“What changed? He’s completely different.” Troy asked.<br />
<br />
“Not completely different. Only a .02% difference in your timelines. Both of your Xarxos were exactly the same. One small change made all the difference.”<br />
<br />
Troy watched his human self and his Leonin party member embrace after their encounter and kiss. He clenched his talons in jealousy. Tears dripped down his beak. All he wanted was to be loved by his husband.<br />
<br />
“Why,” Troy swallowed thickly, “Why did you have me meet Human Troy and Elf Mark?”<br />
<br />
“Ah, him. Yes, he’s from a timeline where you never met RK or Xarxos. He’s just living his life, having fun, not worrying about life and death battles. Earned two Books all by himself. Somehow he got the Book of Myth before he got the Book of Body in this timeline.”<br />
<br />
“Different owner, right?”<br />
<br />
“Perhaps. But there’s no Rusty. They do have a dog named Lancer or something. Book of Divination isn’t even going to RK, he died in that timeline before ever receiving his Book. And…you beat Mark. No Xarxos or RK, just you all by yourself. And you and Mark became best friends afterwards.”<br />
<br />
“I mean…that’s reasonable. Different timeline, after all.”<br />
<br />
“The point still stands. You won without any help or ruining more lives. Xarxos doesn’t even exist in that universe.”<br />
<br />
“What?”<br />
<br />
“All we know is that, for whatever reason, Tex or Xarxos or the Book of Body has evaded us in all timelines. Except one timeline, where a streamer named Juanita asked MB Dolan to make her a woman permanently. No other timeline had that happen.”<br />
<br />
“Weird.”<br />
<br />
“Understatement of the year.” ED Dolan shrugged. “That’s why we sent you the invitation. Yes, it’s a challenge, but we’re trying to save you.”<br />
<br />
“From what?”<br />
<br />
“Recall our last conversation.” ED Dolan sighed. “All three Book of Myth owners are essentially dead. One’s a chew toy, another was literally sent to hell, and poor Mark literally got transformed into the foundation of Xarxos’ empire.”<br />
<br />
“So, okay, say I believe you, that Xarxos is a threat.” Troy raised a brow. “And all I have to do is transform him onto literally anything else and he’s no longer a threat?”<br />
<br />
“It seems that way, doesn’t it?” ED Dolan shrugged., “Xarxos was changed into a Fox and became the sweetest little ball of fluff. He came here with no Books at all, leaving them in Todd’s custody because he trusts Todd completely. Until he met you, of course, he was here to have fun with his boyfriends.”<br />
<br />
Troy swallowed. “Oh.”<br />
<br />
“And then there’s RK…you know him as Rok.” ED Dolan smiled. “Wouldn’t trust that guy either if I were you.”<br />
<br />
“Nope, had enough of that!” Troy stood up. “He helped me take down Transmutation.”<br />
<br />
“Ah, yes, the Book of Transmutation.” ED Dolan nodded. “The guy who somehow knew your exact location.”<br />
<br />
“What are you implying?” Troy sat back down, feathers ruffled.<br />
<br />
“You have been so lucky and you don’t even know it.” Dolan shook his head. “Do you know what  happened to you in every other timeline that you chose not to accept  RK’s proposal?”<br />
<br />
Troy sighed. “Let me guess, you’re going to show me?”<br />
<br />
“Absolutely. Oracle.” ED Dolan waved a hand over his orb and a scene played out before them<br />
<br />
Troy watched as a German Shepherd (Rusty, he guessed) was transformed into a taxidermy and himself (in human form) into a German Shepherd bitch. Not only was Rusty never changed back, but the dog breeder had her bred over and over again for the rest of her life.<br />
<br />
“Gods,” He whispered, eyes wide in horror. “That woman is evil!”<br />
<br />
“Book of Body user. They’re usually horrible people.” ED Dolan shrugged. “And RK let her, said nothing at all.”<br />
<br />
“That’s…just one future.” Troy gulped.<br />
<br />
“Okay!” ED Dolan smiled brightly. “Here’s another!”<br />
<br />
Troy watched as an anthropomorphic tiger was transformed into a pregnant woman and ran to Rusty. Rusty was immediately transformed into a limbless mockery of his former self, with literal assholes for eyes.<br />
<br />
Troy felt nauseous.<br />
<br />
“Oh, that’s the first time you denied him. Here’s the second.”<br />
<br />
The orb flash forwarded to him as some horrific chimera of tits and shit. In front of him stood a magnificent dragon, who cruelly toyed with her. She was led off to breeding pits, where-<br />
<br />
Troy vomited.<br />
<br />
“W-was-” Troy wiped his mouth. “Was that dragon Xarxos?”<br />
<br />
“No idea. All we know is that this outcome happens because you turned down RK.”<br />
<br />
Rok was rather distant, but he’d never betray him like that! Right? But something about all of this didn’t add up.<br />
<br />
“Why send us a challenge, if we’re so dangerous?” Troy asked. “You could just avoid us?”<br />
<br />
“Excellent question, boyo!” ED Dolan grinned. “The longer we idle, the more dangerous he becomes. No offense, but I’m not interested in suffering the horrible fates he has in store for us. I’d say only you and Rusty are free of corruption, but…Rusty has allowed most of this and even when he tried fixing things, he still fucks up.”<br />
<br />
“He’s a fuck up?”<br />
<br />
“Do you really want me to show you the timeline where you all turn into dumb anthro chickens because Rusty gave you a Book without any precautions when you were mentally compromised?”<br />
<br />
“And the challenge?”<br />
<br />
“Look, kid, obviously, we want the Books. But we aren’t going to kill you….well, maybe Mind might, he’s a lot like RK.” ED Dolan shrugged. “We don’t mind if you guys off him. It’ll likely be self-defense.”<br />
<br />
“What?”<br />
<br />
“You’ll see.” Ed Dolan waved a claw. “Be careful around Mind Dolan, is what I’m saying. Nuts. But I’m getting off track. Just a small change of personality in Xarxos is all you need to have fun with him, enjoy some love making! He’s your husband, right?”<br />
<br />
Troy nodded.<br />
<br />
“Then he should love you like one. Not this strange, toxic protectiveness.” ED Dolan pointed behind Troy. “See, Look!”<br />
<br />
Troy turned.<br />
<br />
Xarxos was staring at them, completely disoriented. He’d been hiding behind a pillar.<br />
<br />
“That’s just fucking weird.”<br />
<br />
“He followed you here.” ED said. “I zonked him before I came over. It’s weird, right?”<br />
<br />
“Yes!” Troy said. “That’s what I’ve been dealing with all day! And you know what, Dolan? He won’t even touch me!”<br />
<br />
“Won’t touch you?” ED Dolan raised a claw to his mouth in horror. “But you’re so <I>handsome</I>!”<br />
<br />
“I know!” Troy shook his head.<br />
<br />
Xarxos started blinking.<br />
<br />
“Uh-oh, the zonk is wearing off, gotta go!” Dolan started floating regally away.<br />
<br />
“Wait!” Troy called.<br />
<br />
Dolan paused.<br />
<br />
“What do we do about the challenge?”<br />
<br />
“You have 6 days left.” Ed Dolan shrugged. “Better have a challenge in mind or we force you into a game.”<br />
<br />
Troy nodded. <br />
<br />
Dolan floated away.<br />
<br />
Troy sat silently, eyes on Xarxos. The minotaur’s expression shifted from dazed to confused, before finally focusing on Troy. Troy walked over.<br />
<br />
“Hey Xarxos, I think I’m gonna head to bed. I’m feeling kinda tired.” Troy feigned a yawn and a stretch.<br />
<br />
“Bed?” Xarxos blinked and glanced down at his watch and did a double-take. “Whoa! You’re right, it is super late. I need to plan out tomorrow, I’ve found a few games we can beat. Real weak players, you should have all the games in a bag.”<br />
<br />
“They aren’t game if there’s no challenge.” Troy snorted.<br />
<br />
“We aren’t here to challenge or have fun!” Xarxos snarled and stamped his foot. “Gods Troy, stop acting like a godsdamned child! Wake up!”<br />
<br />
Troy swallowed back his words. “Fine. You want to, uh, try something later, then?”<br />
<br />
“I have a headache, sorry.” Xarxos said flatly. “Are we going to fight over that too?”<br />
<br />
<i>No, we’re getting a divorce. Well, you are.</I> Troy thought, but instead he smiled. “Nope! Oh, wanted to show you something on the Floor of Body. You might have missed it.”<br />
<br />
They wandered down the Floor of Body. Troy weaved his way through the crowds, intent on getting to the Sex Machine. Xarxos would shoot it down, but-<br />
<br />
Troy paused, staring at the Sex Machine. A familiar figure was surveying it.<br />
<br />
“Hey, Xarxos.” Troy pointed at a white-furred fox. “Isn’t that Mark?”<br />
<br />
“What?”<br />
<br />
“Mark,” Tory pointed at the figure as he stepped into the machine. “He’s going into the Sex Machine.”<br />
<br />
“Sex Machine?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I checked it out earlier. It reads minds or something, puts you into a sex scenario-Hey wait, where’re you going?” Troy blinked as Xarxos rushed over to the machine.<br />
<br />
He grinned., watching the minotaur sprint away. Just as planned.<br />
<br />
Well, not exactly. He was planning on being the victim himself. He wouldn’t actually look at the screen, he’d figured out how these things worked. That Mark had let his curiosity get the better of him first…well, that was just icing on the cake as far as Troy was concerned.<br />
<br />
He hustled over to the Sex Machine and schooled his face into a worried expression.<br />
<br />
“Xarxos? What are you doing?” Troy asked, trying to sound innocent.<br />
<br />
The minotaur turned around and poked his head out from the privacy curtains.<br />
<br />
“Mark…the fox, not the elf…wandered into the sex machine,” Xarxos explained.<br />
<br />
“Yes, I know, I told you he’d gone in there.” Troy said. “But it’s not a big deal. They have copies of his chips.”<br />
<br />
“It’s a big deal because of how that machine works!” Xarxos pointed at the screen. “It’s reading his mind. As in, anything we’ve discussed is being downloaded as we speak!”<br />
<br />
“Shit!” Troy looked around. “Well…what are we gonna do?”<br />
<br />
“I’m going in to get him out.” Xarxos said.&#8232;&#8232;<br />
<br />
“What?!” Troy squawked. “But you could get transformed in there!”<br />
<br />
“Not if I resist the machine’s temptations,” the bull-man replied. “Plus I have my Book. I’ll be perfectly fine, Troy. Trust me.”<br />
<br />
He turned around and slipped his chips of Mind, Body, and Soul into the coin slot before sitting down on the bench, about to pull the safety harness down over his shoulders, when Troy suddenly came in and grabbed his hand.<br />
<br />
“I think I saw another machine somewhere on the floor,” the phoenix said, holding Xarxos’ hand close to his chest. “I’ll get in that one and help you. We have a spare set of chips, so you can change me back if something happens.”&#8232;&#8232;<br />
<br />
“No, absolutely not.”<br />
<br />
“But-”<br />
<br />
“I said no, Troy!”<br />
<br />
“You-!” The phoenix opened his beak to say something, but just sighed in defeat. “Fine. Just…please be careful…”<br />
<br />
“I will be. I promise.” Xarxos pulled his hand away and pulled the safety harness down. He looked over to Mark and shook his head in frustration. “You owe me big time for this, you damn fox.”<br />
<br />
Then, he looked at the screen.<br />
<br />
As Xarxos entered the simulation, Troy stepped out of the machine and looked at the ring in his hand, a slight smirk on his beak.<br />
<br />
“Sorry Xarxos,” he said to himself. “You’re not getting out of here unchanged.”<br />
<br />
He pocketed the Book of Myth and watched the booth, listening to the moans coming from inside. Troy peeled back the curtain a bit and saw both Todd and Xarxos changing, making funny faces, muttering unintelligibly. He smirked and stepped away.<br />
<br />
Troy waited. And waited. The sounds inside were just as lewd as ever. Finally, the phoenixkin threw his arms in the air and walked away.<br />
<br />
That stupid minotaur was probably beating the damn thing, Book or no Book. He’d always been a fucking prude. Troy found a table at a wrestling tournament, one that gave him a good view of the Sex Machine, and sat down.<br />
<br />
His gaze drifted from the sexy beasts rolling around on the mats to the Sex Machine. Nothing, curtains still draw. Eventually, he stopped paying attention when a wrestler managed to pin his opponent and started humping him.<br />
<br />
Troy grinned. He fuckin’ loved this place!<br />
<br />
But soon, even the wrestling failed to keep him interested. No transformations, everyone seemed to have a spare chip or two to save themselves with. Boring.<br />
<br />
“Hey there good lookin’.” A smooth voice drawled from Troy’s elbow.<br />
<br />
Troy looked up from the game and noticed the deer next to him.<br />
<br />
He looked like a handsome and somewhat athletic redneck, though his twunky frame was marred by soft pecs and a small beer belly that stretched his dark green Biller-Lite shirt. There was a curve under his chin that suggested the beginnings of a second. His a nice, thick ass made the brown camo cargo shorts he was wearing, which Troy would never be caught dead in, vastly more appealing.<br />
<br />
All the flaws about him were fixable with the Book of Body, of course. Or maybe a month at the gym if his metabolism was fast, as was the case for most anthro deer Troy knew. A fixer-upper, one might say.<br />
<br />
Troy smiled at the deer, glancing towards the Sex Game. The privacy curtain had been pulled back, meaning that Xarxos and Mark had both left the machine. That meant that the deer in front of him was more than likely the former minotaur.<br />
<br />
“Xarxos?” he asked.<br />
<br />
“Close, but not quite,” the deer said, rubbing Troy’s arm. “It’s Xavier, remember?”<br />
<br />
“Right, silly me,” Troy said. “Just a slip of the tongue.”<br />
<br />
“Wanna grab a beer?” The deer licked his lips.<br />
<br />
“Sure.” Troy led the way to the bar.<br />
<br />
He wondered how he’d go about fixing his new playmate. No big changes, of course. If he wanted the deer to be skinnier and lose that weight, then he’d cast a spell, take him to the gym, watch him lose thirty pounds while working out. That was hotter and more satisfying than instant weight loss was.<br />
<br />
As Troy’s mind whirled with possibilities, he failed to note the deer behind him was smirking.</p>
