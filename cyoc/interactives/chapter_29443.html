<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;What&#39;s it, bro?&quot; Ty asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I would like to be a wrestling suit.&quot; Dustin said ashamed.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Ty asked confused. It was a very strange wish...<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes! I won my trophy today. But you deserved it too. I&#39;ll help you to win your own trophy and I&#39;d like to be with you when you do it. So if you turn me into a wrestling suit and you wear me, I&#39;ll be with you when you fight.&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool!&quot; Ty loved Dustin&#39;s idea, it could be also a way to spend more time together. &quot;I can do the changes now if you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, not yet... Let me enjoy this body a little bit more. Maybe when you change me into a wrestling suit I won&#39;t return to my human body anymore.&quot; Dustin said ashamed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why... Why do you say that?&quot; Ty asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because... Because I want to stay forever with you, you deserve it. When we were kids I was always bullying you. But all changed when you got your powers. And since that day you are always helping me and trying to make me feel good. I want to return all your favours, so let your big brother be your fighting mate. I&#39;ll be very happy if you understand me.&quot; Dustin said, he was almost crying.<br />
<br />
Tyler gave him a big hug. He wasn&#39;t sure if it was a good idea to have a wrestling suit brother forever. But he wanted the best for his big brother, so he couldn&#39;t do anything but make him happy making his dream come true.<br />
<br />
Both went to the car, it was starting to get dark and they wanted to have supper. While Dustin was driving he wished that his mom could not notice any changes on them. Ty granted his wish again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi!&quot; both said when they arrived home.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello!&quot; their mother said. She saw those muscular wrestlers as her children, thanks to Dustin&#39;s wish. &quot;Where have you been? You two are soaked in sweat. Go to the shower now!&quot; she said upset.<br />
<br />
&quot;Awww... Mom... I don&#39;t wanna have a shower now, I want to eat something, I&#39;m hungry!&quot; Ty said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tyler... You are not a kid anymore. You are an adult wrestler now, and you must be clean everyday or you will be stinking always!&quot; their mother said. &quot;Give me your suits, I&#39;ll wash them while you have a shower.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok mom!&quot; Dustin said. They gave her their suits and ran naked to the bathroom. They had the shower at the same time, enjoying being there as two muscular men together for the last time,.<br />
<br />
After having shower, they took again their cleant wrestling suits and wore them. They went to the dinning room, their father arrived from his work and had supper with him and their mother. They talked about the wrestling championship and laughed when Dustin explained how he won Tyler.<br />
<br />
After that, they went to bed. They were very tired, it was a long day, and next day would be very important for them. They definitively needed a rest. Dustin fell asleep quickly. Ty was waiting for it, when he saw his brother was sleeping he started to transform him.<br />
<br />
Dustin&#39;s body started to become black and to melt into a strange liquid. When he was completely melt, he started to change his form into a wrestling suit. Tyler left him sleeping, next day he would be awakening up as a wrestling suit. Then Ty, the only human remaining in that bedroom, fell asleep too.<br />
<br />
Next day Dustin awakened up feeling his body being burnt. The sun was entering through the window and attacking him. He tried to move, and then noticed he was unable to move!<br />
<br />
&quot;Ty! Ty! Help! I can&#39;t move!&quot; he screamed. Tyler awakened up and rubbed his eyes. Then he smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course! That&#39;s because you are now a wrestling suit!&quot; he said happily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Re... Really? I am a wrestling suit finally?&quot; Dustin said. &quot;Haha! It&#39;s true! What are you waiting for Tyler? Wear me!!! Wear me!!! You can&#39;t go naked forever, I must protect your dignity!&quot; he said excited.<br />
<br />
Ty took his brother and entered into the suit. None of them could explain that feeling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Awesome! Bro, this feels GREAT!!! You are very comfortable!&quot; Tyler said excited.<br />
<br />
Ty was feeling as if someone was tightening all his muscles. The suit was very comfortable for him. It was tight, like the one he had before. But this time, he knew Dustin was that suit. And that made him feel even more happy and protected too.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! You are not the only one enjoying this!&quot; Dustin said.<br />
<br />
Dustin was feeling very good too. Being that black fabric that covered that muscular body made him very happy, he was the one destined to protect that body. He could feel all his brother&#39;s hard muscles on his fabric.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice pecs you have here!&quot; Dustin said laughing when he felt his brother&#39;s hard pectorals.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Tyler&#39;s cock became erected, and its head began to push against the front part of his brother, the suit, forcing him to make Ty&#39;s bulge grow almost twice.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... Sorry bro... I didn&#39;t...&quot; Ty said ashamed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry! Remember that I&#39;m now part of you, and I protect all your body. I&#39;ll do my best making appear this bulge and covering all your muscles!&quot; Dustin said. &quot;Oh! And you can stay erected forever if you want! It makes me feel even better! Your package is hot, and I love feeling so warm!&quot; Both laughed.<br />
<br />
Ty ran to the mirror and looked to his body and his brother. Finally, Dustin was what he wanted to be. And Tyler also accepted their new lives. Some hours ago he wasn&#39;t sure if it was a good idea, but now he loved it and wanted to stay like that forever.</p>
