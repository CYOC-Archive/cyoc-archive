<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">5 minutes passed as Louis had come to simply accept that this was his body. He wasn’t used to it, he even doubted that he would ever get used to it. But this was his body.<br />
He had taken the time to walk through the hallway, just feeling his body moving differently than he was used to. The muscles in different places, working slightly different. He felt the jiggle of almost all of his assets, his breasts, his ass, his thighs, and even his arms seemed to jiggle upon every movement.<br />
He’d stared himself in the mirror several times, looking at himself. Of course it was his own face, heavily feminized with makeup and such, but he couldn’t truly deny that he looked pretty sexy. He was truly the definition of a MILF.<br />
<br />
As Louis stood in the corridor, looking himself in the grand mirror, with his hands cupping his breasts as he looked at his cleavage, he heard a voice.<br />
<br />
“Hey?” Maddy called out, looking around, “what just happened? I know I was frozen or something… but how long’s it been?” She asked again, but nothing.<br />
Louis was genuinely quite worried to reveal himself. He wanted Maddy to just turn the corner and see him, but she didn’t. Stubbornly, she mumbled to herself,<br />
“Whatever,” she said to herself, then yelled obnoxiously, “I’M PULLING MY NEXT CARD! BETTER HURRY YOUR ASS UP!”<br />
<br />
—<br />
<br />
Maddy sighed, frustrated with her brother. Being frozen solid was weird, but she really didn’t remember any of it. Only when she started to freeze, and when she was halfway through being unfrozen. She was a little pissed she missed out, but sort of relieved she didn’t have to feel herself being completely immobilised.<br />
She wanted to yell again, just to piss off her brother, but she didn’t bother. She looked herself down, seeing the red dress she was wearing. From what she could tell, it was cute. After her next turn she was half-tempted to check herself out in the mirror… if only she had some tits to fill out the top. She sighed again.<br />
<br />
Leaning down, she drew her two cards. She read out her Action Card to herself, “says ‘No Action Applies’. Great.” She said to herself, tossing the card over her shoulder nonchalantly. She turned over her change card, bracing for whatever it could be, “‘Eyes of Diamond… hm…”<br />
<br />
She then felt a strange pressure in her eye. It didn’t hurt, but it felt so strange, like some kind of invisible force touching her eye. She blinked several times, then rubbed her eyelids.<br />
“No better time to check the mirror.” She chuckled to herself.<br />
<br />
—<br />
<br />
“Shit.” Louis whispered to himself, his voice still significantly higher than he was used to. He started panicking, quickly glancing at himself in the mirror. He couldn’t have Maddy see him like this!<br />
<br />
“STOP!” He yelled.<br />
Maddy stopped in her tracks, taking a step back, “y-you are there. You asshole! Why didn’t you answer before.”<br />
“Just don’t look at me.”<br />
“Your voice is… higher. Holy shit, did it make you into a kid!?” She chuckled, almost wanting to relish in the idea of physically being the older sibling,<br />
“N-no…” he said.<br />
“You sound like a woman…” Maddy said, “did the game make you a girl?” She asked, then she realised, “shit! You totally wouldn’t have been to walk before, the game must’ve made you into some kind of supermodel bitch right?”<br />
“MADDY!” Louis yelled. She went quiet.<br />
<br />
A few moments passed. Louis tossed and turned trying to figure out how to hide himself. But he couldn’t. He had to.<br />
<br />
Louis stepped out of the hallway, revealing himself to Maddy.<br />
<br />
She blinked a few times, then her jaw fell to the floor.<br />
“Oh my god.” She said in complete stunned disbelief. She looked her ‘brother’ up and down. He looked like he could’ve rivalled ever their mom’s age. Not only that, but he was THICK.<br />
“Fuck.” She said.<br />
The shock wore off quickly as Maddy came to the realisation that her own brother. Her dorky stupid dumbass brother had a better figure than she did.<br />
Her expression dropped, and she just turned around and started walking to the game-area, “c-c’mon let’s not waste any more of this time. I wanna get back to normal.”<br />
<br />
Louis, feeling a little sick with nerves, simply followed her back. He dragged his feet, holding his arm over his chest awkwardly.<br />
<br />
—<br />
<br />
Maddy didn’t look at him. She looked away, which was good for Louis. He didn’t want her eyes on him.<br />
He made his way over to the card-set, then leaned over and grabbed his cards.<br />
<br />
However, in doing this he accidentally shoved his ass directly into Maddy’s face, revealing the sheer scope of his booty to her. She couldn’t help but look, and she got very uncomfortable. She didn’t know how to feel. It was like a teacher leaning over in front of her in class. She stayed silent as Louis turned around to face his sister, then set down on the edge of the table. His huge butt taking up the majority of the space.<br />
“F-first card is… um… ‘Card Applies to Both Players’.”<br />
“Great. You better not screw this up for the both of us.”<br />
“S-sure…” Louis said, his heart genuinely pounding. He shakily picked up the Change Card, and lifted it up to see what it said, “Round… Rear.”<br />
<br />
Maddy quickly jumped to her feet, feeling a pressure in her butt. She bent her head over her shoulder to look at her ass. And she felt it starting to swell. She saw it start to swell. It grew bigger, like a basketball being inflated. Thicker and fatter… and rounder. She could only watch as both her cheeks grew to around the size of her head. She groaned. Maybe she did get her wish to be curvier after all… but two beach-balls attached to her ass wasn’t exactly what she was hoping for.<br />
<br />
Then she looked up, staring ahead at the Cougar that was once her brother.<br />
His hips were already wide, and his ass was already pretty fat. But right now his ass was growing bigger and rounder, putting her own butt to shame as his reached certain basketball size. It grew and grew until each cheek looked like someone had stuffed a balloon down hia leggings.<br />
<br />
The two looked up at each other, quickly cringing and rapidly looked away. There was a tension between them. It wasn’t just sibling rivalry that they were used to, it was something more. A lot more.<br />
<br />
“I-I think your eyes look cool…” Louis muttered softly,<br />
“What?” Maddy replied,<br />
“They’re blue… really shiny.” He said.<br />
“Oh.” Maddy said. She shuddered, “right. Thanks.”<br />
<br />
She shuffled her way over to where the mirror was in the hallway. She stopped midway, feeling her new buttocks jiggle more than she was used to, “you don’t look ugly… as a woman.”<br />
“Thanks.” Louis said.</p>
