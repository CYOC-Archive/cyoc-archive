<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff had settled back in his computer chair and pulled the Chronivac program back up. He minimized his father&#39;s profile but it stayed up, he had to click minimize twice to make it go away and get back to his profile, he was just beginning to explore what he could do when his fathers voice cried, &quot;Who the hell are you and what are you doing in my room?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff had never heard his father use that tone and his brain suddenly switched into high gear. He knew there was an intruder, his dad was near his bedroom, the intruder was probably in the master bedroom (a thief would go there for jewelry), he needed to find his sister who he hasn&#39;t heard or maybe help dad with the intruder. The sudden rush of adrenaline made time seem to slow and he noticed the emergency freeze button on the right side of the screen. He clicked it and a red border circled the interface indicating it was active... <br />
<br />
No other sounds came... Jeff briefly considered bulking himself up to a bodybuilder and giving himself combat abilities and a weapon so he could take care of things while time is frozen by himself but decided to examine the situation first. He found his father standing in the door looking into his room addressing... his father, who appeared to be in the middle of changing clothes, wearing pants, an unbuttoned dress shirt, but no socks.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell?&quot; Jeff muttered, bewildered as to why he has two fathers.<br />
<br />
Deducing the culprit was his father&#39;s terrible computer skills mixed with the power of the Chronivac he returned to the device to try to figure out what&#39;s going on and who father number 2 should actually be. Looking through the profiles he quickly saw Melanie&#39;s profile was unable to be found and looking at his Dad&#39;s profiles they were identical save for current clothing. Jeff suspected the Dad who was changing clothes was probably his sister, but nothing in the Chronivac indicated this. There was no undo button, no package was applied copying his dad&#39;s stats... its as though the original profile was completely overwritten down to his.. uh, her?... their mental history.<br />
<br />
The reality struck him, his little sister was gone... He could do his best to restore some of her traits, like gender, age, and hair color, but the closest thing he could do would be to copy his profile to hers, change her gender, reduce her age, change her name back, and alter reality.<br />
<br />
She&#39;d be a younger female version of Jeff, which is better than a younger female version of their father, but not the Melanie they all knew and lo...put up with... Genetically one of their x chromosomes would be a perfect match which intro to bio taught him doesn&#39;t happen in sexual reproduction.<br />
<br />
Jeff searched the tool for something that would restore her as his real sister, preferably to her original profile but as time stood still and package after package was useless to his goals his hope diminished and he was growing tired and hungry.. to him it should be around 7pm though time was stuck at 11:30 am.<br />
<br />
Despite the goal of restoring his family, Jeff was frustrated. Melanie had technically hit all the life achievements he was supposed to hit, before him. Being able to grow a beard, graduating, having a decent job, reaching 180 lbs, drinking, having sex, getting married, having kids, owning a house. His little sister was more manly than him and could easily beat him up... and it was because his dad couldn&#39;t stay the fuck out of his room and mind his own God Damn business...<br />
<br />
Getting Melanie back to sister status, a correct age and mentality was something he knew he could do, perhaps imperfectly, but well enough for their lives to continue normally. However, his dad fucking around with his stuff could have just as easily wiped Jeff from existence, there would be a fight going on between him and his dad right now, and nobody focused on actually fixing things.<br />
<br />
Jeff had tried to repress these thoughts, but as he continued to try to fix his father&#39;s mess he got hangrier and hangrier, ultimately realizing that for the safety of the family he had to at least limit his dad&#39;s access to his computer, possibly even his room... and making his sister supersede him in all of his future life goals, even temporarily and accidentally, made Jeff want at least some of those things for himself now, to offset her having gotten them... even if it was just for a little while.</p>
