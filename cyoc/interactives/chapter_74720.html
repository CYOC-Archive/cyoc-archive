<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You should know that if you sign the contract, you're subject to my ultimate authority,&quot; Zoro said very <br />
matter of factly, glancing over his shoulder at you. &quot;I'm your judge, jury, and executioner, little boy..keep <br />
that in mind, no matter if you think you're safely in the arms of your lycan princess or not.&quot; He smiled a <br />
rather sinister and leering grin at you, indicating that he'd like nothing more than for you to give him the <br />
excuse to kill you. You didn't acknowledge him, instead simply focusing on not showing any fear at all. You <br />
didn't want to give him the satisfaction.<br />
<br />
He led you back up to the main floor, where the &quot;official&quot; business took place and back to the office you'd <br />
been in with Ms. Adair the previous night. She glanced up at the two of you. &quot;That will be all, Zoro,&quot; she <br />
said, sounding every bit annoyed as she had on the intercom. He inclined his head and left without saying a <br />
word.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sit,&quot; she commanded you, gesturing to a chair in front of her desk. You complied almost before it dawned on <br />
you that you had. She smiled. &quot;At least you listen well enough,&quot; she said, giving you a backhanded compliment <br />
of sorts. You cleared your throat nervously as she filled out some paperwork in front of her and acted as if <br />
you weren't there.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, you saw what Jenny was,&quot; she said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; you replied. &quot;I have to admit that I wasn't thinking THAT when you talked fetish photography.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ms. Adair smirked at you, though she seemed to be amused by your comment. &quot;Nobody does. Over half our <br />
clientele thinks that it's all done with photoshop or special effects. Every now and again, we do release a <br />
bodypaint or photoshopped set to maintain the illusion.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that makes money?&quot; you asked, rather incredulous.<br />
<br />
&quot;The adult entertainment industry is one of the few recession-proof industries in the world. Everyone will <br />
always love sex. We have a standard front company for the more mundane fetishes..softcore, artistic, blowjob, <br />
lesbian..those sites make solid money, day in and day out. However, people with more...fringe fetishes are <br />
willing to pay a higher premium for access to new material for their arousal. That's where the lower level <br />
brings in the top dollar income.&quot; She smiled. &quot;A normal one-month subscription to any of our standard sites is <br />
roughly ten dollars a month. Our supernatural sites start at twenty five.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Even so..they're fringe..I'd have to wonder at the viability of people who get off watching girls turn into <br />
werewolves,&quot; you said. &quot;It's not like there's this huge community of people who are into werewolf sex.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;LYCANS, Mr. Anderson. LYCANS,&quot; Ms. Adair snapped at you firmly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right..lycans,&quot; you replied. &quot;Jenny already corrected me on that one..sorry, it's a bit of a habit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;One you'd be wise to break. No lycan appreciates the term. It's degrading. And there are far more humans into <br />
the fetish than you'd expect, though as with any fetish, the majority are much quieter about it. Also..you <br />
realize that there are also lycans that enjoy pornography as well, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I hadn't really thought about it, but it does make sense,&quot; you agreed.<br />
<br />
&quot;We also don't have JUST lycans here..we have vampires,gamma beasts, zombies, and other species of animal <br />
shifter, including cats and foxes, in addition to some other, more nonthreatening animals, like horses or <br />
cows. We cater to EVERY supernatural fetish you can imagine,&quot; she informed you. &quot;In addition to still <br />
photography, we film each and every photoshoot and sell the videos..and to our most trusted premium customers, <br />
we offer more...intimate encounters with some of our girls.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You pimp them out??&quot; you ask, rather shocked.<br />
<br />
&quot;STOP IT, MR. ANDERSON,&quot; she said firmly, glaring at you. &quot;The girls are all free to choose if they wish to <br />
participate in such things. Well, aside from the zombies..they..don't have much free will, or the ability to <br />
express it. But any of our sentient supernaturals can choose whether or not to make themselves available. This <br />
isn't some immoral operation; my first concern is to protect the secret of the existence of all of the breeds, <br />
and then to make sure each and every employee is both safe and well provided for. You can feel free to ask any <br />
of the girls if they enjoy what they do; I guarantee you that each one will say yes. I empower them to feel <br />
sexually alive and comfortable, regardless of what shape they might take or what species they might be. <br />
Without me, every one of these girls would be living a life of a much lower standard. And if you sign on the <br />
line, I assure you that YOU will also live at a much higher standard.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How much are we talking about?&quot; You were highly curious.<br />
<br />
&quot;A thousand dollars per shoot, and you'll be expected to do at least two shoots a week, possibly more. You'll <br />
be making at least a hundred thousand dollars a year before taxes. Due to some legal ass-covering we do, <br />
you're going to be listed as a subcontractor, so you'll have to fill out a 10-99 form. We pay cash, and we <br />
don't take the taxes out for you. I'm fairly certain that's a higher standard than you've ever lived at as an <br />
adult.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your jaw was nearly on the floor. How much money was this place making that they could pay you so much? <br />
&quot;Uhh..shit..where do I sign?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ms. Adair smirked knowingly. &quot;I have everything right here.&quot; She handed you a stack of papers, each one of <br />
which had the standard &quot;Sign/initial/date&quot; line at the bottom. When you finished, she pulled out a large <br />
syringe. &quot;Just one last thing,&quot; she said as she got up and moved over to you, gripping your wrist firmly and <br />
inserting the needle into your vein rather expertly. You started to pull away, but she held you steady. &quot;Don't <br />
jerk away, you could blow a vein or worse.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell is that for?&quot; you asked her, trying to hide your panic.<br />
<br />
&quot;So if you ever try to screw us over,&quot; she said. &quot;Any of our hunter units can find you NO MATTER WHERE YOU <br />
HIDE with this. It's our security policy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But..I thought you said I'd be free to end employment whenever I wanted,&quot; you protested.<br />
<br />
&quot;You most certainly can. However, we will hold onto this in perpetuity. You gave us permission on page four. <br />
If for any reason we think you aren't holding to the terms of your NDA, or we think you're working against us, <br />
whether you're in our employ or not, we reserve the right to do what we can to protect ourselves.&quot; She smiled <br />
rather coldly. &quot;But you're going to be a good and happy employee..and an honorable former one, if it should <br />
come to that, aren't you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y..yeah,&quot; you said, letting her finish taking your blood. She labeled it and laid it aside for the moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good; I had a solid feeling about you, though not as good as Jenny did, apparently,&quot; she said, her voice <br />
going unreadable as she mentioned Jenny. &quot;You realize you're NOT her personal photographer, yes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well..yeah, I figured as much,&quot; you replied, doing what you could to try and ignore the veiled threat Ms. <br />
Adair had used on you moments earlier.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good. She's one of our most popular girls, so you'll often be the photographer, but if we overuse her, <br />
Jenny's value drops. We actually have fifteen different lycan girls, so you'll be photographing them as well, <br />
along with any other supernaturals we assign you to shoot. We also have a couple other photographers on <br />
staff..you can imagine things get very busy during the full moon around here. So sometimes while she might be <br />
doing a shoot, it will be with another person there.&quot; She watched you closely for a reaction. You did what you <br />
could to hide anything she might use against you. <br />
<br />
&quot;That's fine. This is about professionalism, not personal attachment,&quot; you said, hoping that was what she <br />
wanted to hear. Ms. Adair raised an eyebrow at you, but didn't call you a liar, much to your relief.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good. I was hoping to hear you say that. You wouldn't be the first employee to get attached to one of our <br />
girls, and not the first to get attached to Jenny either. A bit of friendly advice..most of our lycan girls <br />
are..more than happy to play around with their photographers after a shoot. We've noticed that most of the <br />
shifters in general seem to have a high level of sexual arousal after transformation or reversion. Don't read <br />
anything into a shifter's willingness to sleep with you,&quot; she was particularly emphatic on the point, and you <br />
wondered if she was giving you genuine advice, or if there was an ulterior motive.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll keep that in mind,&quot; you replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;We obviously..don't care if you have sex with any of the models, once the work is done. But under no <br />
circumstances should you be interfering with the shoot by trying to have sex with them in any way. Giving them <br />
instructions like &quot;Look at me,&quot; or &quot;Open your shirt more&quot; are fine, though the girls might not listen to <br />
you..but we can at least edit those out of the recording in post-production. I'll make sure you're clear on <br />
anything else before your shoot, as we often have specific things we're looking for you to get shots of.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright,&quot; you said. &quot;Anything else?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ms. Adair pulled a keycard out of her desk. &quot;This is your temporary card until we can get a new one made for <br />
you. It will give you full access to anywhere in the facility, though please use good judgement. If you choose <br />
to leave the complex, be back here at six pm for your first shoot. Otherwise, feel free to get to know some of <br />
the other girls, or other employees here.&quot;<br />
<br />
You took the card from her and then got up to leave.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, and Mr. Anderson?&quot; she said. You turned, not sure of what to expect from this rather enigmatic woman. <br />
&quot;Welcome to the team.&quot; She smiled rather warmly, though her eyes remained cold.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; you said as cheerily as you could muster.</p>
