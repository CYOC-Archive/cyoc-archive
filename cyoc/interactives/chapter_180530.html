<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the two best friends finished their torrid affair, Wes was starting to realize something might just be up. The more heavily muscled of the two realized as he stretched out after one last romp in the bed that the fine hairs on his arm looked distinctly different. More black than blond, and he went ahead and checked his hair in one of the windows. He still saw his usual blond hair, but something seemed different about it today. Almost like it was dyed in rather than his natural hair color.<br />
<br />
As he stretched and flexed lightly for his own newly developed sense of ego, he looked over at Bryan and realized that as much as his physique had improved... well, it really seemed Bryan was the standout when it came to improvement. Wes had been stocky but he had been strong. Bryan started out thin and not in the best shape. But now nobody could say that about him.<br />
<br />
And his skin. Wes tilted his head when he noticed it at first. Bryan seemed to be himself different, very much so, but somehow while they were having sex the notice of it just slipped right past Wes. Well, that might&#39;ve had something to do with the sheer pleasure of taking Bryan that hard. Wes looked at the half-dressed Bryan, who was darker than him by far - enough it no longer really looked like just a tan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Bryan...Hermano,&quot; Wes asked, &quot;That&#39;s...quite a tan you&#39;re rocking there. What&#39;s your family like again?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hah, I get what you&#39;re asking,&quot; Bryan seemed so far to not even realize that there was a racial component to the changes, &quot;Still me in here. Plain old white boy whitebread Bryan.&quot; However when he ran a hand through his hair, Bryan found himself pausing for a moment as he registered what had happened with his hair...and then just as quickly shrugged those large shoulders and went on with dressing himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;You sure, man?&quot; Wes asked, &quot;I&#39;m...beginning to have doubts big time about myself. I mean, the Spanish coming in, the way my hair looks...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re about as Latino as Rico Suave.&quot; Bryan responded with a chuckle, but it seemed he half didn&#39;t believe it himself. Bryan looked down at his arm and shook his head. He honestly thought he was just tanning up nicely, but now he really, truly started wondering. How far would these changes proceed?<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, man...sure.&quot; Wes decided out of an abundance of caution to make sure a few things were done in case the changes proceeded further than this. Below the surface. Toward their minds. It made sense that something that made them feel these sexual urges toward each other was also capable of altering more than that.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll be heading out now, see you at school tomorrow.&quot; Bryan made sure he had everything he brought with him and then headed out toward his car. He decided he may as well head over to the gym if he was feeling up for it. Best to try out this body and see what its upper limits were. He figured it was best to know these things before throwing himself into any sudden physical activity.<br />
<br />
Wes stood by and watched Bryan wave goodbye and then proceed out into his car. Wes gulped as he saw the car drive away from his spot near the window. Would the Bryan he saw the next day be the same Bryan he knew from today? Wes went ahead and, motivated by this, went back upstairs and started his computer up. He shucked off his shirt before long, looking at his muscular torso. He remembered when the changes were just aesthetic.<br />
<br />
Those were the simpler times during all of this.<br />
<br />
Wes opened up a word file and started typing out the changes that had occurred so far. Skin color changed. Spanish language fluidity noted. Muscular and cardiovascular fitness accentuated. Mental factors detected. Sexuality changed to bisexual. Honestly, some part of Wes almost wondered if he wasn&#39;t always bisexual and just in denial. That he had always had these feelings buried deep down... Wes shook his head. He would&#39;ve known that BEFORE the changes happened.<br />
<br />
He couldn&#39;t let the changes happening now influence his logging of what happened. If the changes impacted his mind, this document might well by the one way he had of knowing he hadn&#39;t always been the man he ended up changing into. He hoped he remembered it...and thus decided to take utterly no chances. He saved the file as a PDF into both his phone and on to the laptop. Such that logging on, he would always see &quot;URGENT - CHANGE LOG&quot;.<br />
<br />
Wes doubted that Bryan was logging these things as much as he was. He seemed to like how things were so far. And, to be honest, Wes didn&#39;t have many complaints. He was pretty much himself so far, just with a few additions and much, much more in shape. But he could not help but be cautious in the face of what it had done to him so far.<br />
<br />
The burgeoning young bisexual found himself wondering how many other people used the wish machine so far. And what other effects were playing out over the town. It couldn&#39;t just be him and Bryan. With something like that there had to be others.<br />
<br />
The athlete decided, before his mind could be changed much more than this, he was going to try and find anyone else who might be changing. So that he could try and convince them to log the changes or keep some semblance of who they had been before.<br />
<br />
---------------<br />
<br />
Alex fit on a tank top shirt and workout pants, wondering as he did if this was going to be as disastrously humiliating as his last time in the gym. He remembered distinctly well how the last time he was in there, he needed the help of some tanned, beach blond young man when he put a little too much on the weight rack for bench press. The young man&#39;s cocky sneer was almost too memorable. He could tell he was laughing internally at the out of shape professor coming in here like that and making a fool out of himself.<br />
<br />
Yet something felt different today. He couldn&#39;t really say what. His shirt - a gift from some of his friends - fit him distinctly better than he thought it would. It actually felt like he filled it out in a way better than he usually would. His gut felt a little tighter today, a little less ponderous. He felt it and looked at the mirror as he finished getting dressed.<br />
<br />
Professor Alex Clark was heading back into the gym, after his usually sleep-heavy night didn&#39;t exactly pan out. Whatever that jolt of energy had been, it had perhaps become a motivating enough factor to lead him into this. He knew he would probably experience it again if he tried to go asleep somehow. It just seemed like his luck. &quot;Well, genius, it&#39;s time to try your best to not fail immediately. Let&#39;s hope my gym performance is better than Randy Brycen&#39;s last paper at least.&quot;<br />
<br />
Low-hanging fruit, he knew it. Randy barely participated in class, and the only time he perked up was when anyone mentioned anything that vaguely reminded him of marijuana.<br />
<br />
Alex made sure he filled up a huge jug full of water, and started to head out. He got in his car, and breathed. &quot;Well, it&#39;s now or never, I suppose. I&#39;ll probably never again feel this motivated.&quot; Alex started the car up, and, one last check on his workout bag to make sure, he started off toward the local gym he still maintained a membership at - even though he never really went.<br />
<br />
20 Fitness gave him a huge discount for being a teacher and having a membership there, enough that he barely paid a thing to keep his membership. They appreciated the people who taught their more meatheaded people the skills of life, it seemed to him. Alex found himself looking around more alert as he drove. He would usually feel tired, just wiped out, by this time of the day. Perhaps it was poor energy levels due to his morose personality, or his poor fitness acting up at his age. But now?<br />
<br />
Now he noticed things he never would&#39;ve given much attention to. Including a trio of 20-something women proceeding down toward the shopping center. Well! Alex suddenly bit his lip lightly as he realized he was yet again feeling a stirring coming on. As he did so, he didn&#39;t notice his shoulders broadening, becoming larger and pushing out a bit more. His chest likewise becoming a little less moob and a little more actual pectoral.<br />
<br />
Still stocky, but not as unhealthy. Even his arms tightened and grew a little stronger. Alex winced as he felt this, wondering if he wasn&#39;t moving his arms enough. As he drove to the gym he started switching up his posture a bit.<br />
<br />
By the time he got there, he was actually feeling kind of hyped up to try the gym again. He hoisted his bag up on his slightly stronger, slightly wider back, and headed inside...only to immediately gulp. He saw the very same beach blond guy from his less than wonderful time in the gym - now wearing the outfit of a personal trainer here. He was evidently just finishing helping a young, perky woman. And wouldn&#39;t you know it? He looked even bigger than before. Though it looked like, now that Alex saw it, there were tell tale signs his ambitions outgrew what his body could naturally achieve.<br />
<br />
His trapezius muscles were frankly enormous, his chest pushed out with a vigor uncommon, and it looked like his abs pushed out in a definite roid gut. And despite it all, and knowing he wasn&#39;t natural, Alex somehow felt envious even still. He approached the front desk, manned by a muscular young Asian man with his hair gelled back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I&#39;ve uh, not been in here for some time.&quot; Alex started, &quot;I was wondering if I could get some personal training done to make sure I can workout by myself. Is anyone available.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Asian young man, whose name tag read &quot;Ben&quot;, looked around and his eyes followed the blond roid junkie for a moment. &quot;Well, right now...we have Chad Owens. He&#39;s the enormous blond currently heading over to the trainers&#39; area.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex gulped, realizing this would be his second experience with Chad. And of course his name was Chad. Why wouldn&#39;t it be? Alex knew he could well just go back home, put his stuff away and go about his night. But he was motivated tonight, dammit. And he wasn&#39;t about to let Captain Steroids back there intimidate him out of getting fit. Alex stepped forward, his quads slightly thickening as he did so, &quot;Alright, sign me on with Mr. Owens.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Will do.&quot; And with that, Ben went back there to go talk to Chad. The professor stood back and waited, stuffing his hands in his pockets. Thinking about what his workout tonight might look like. Hopefully he didn&#39;t make a fool of himself on bench again. He&#39;d hate to be implicitly laughed at again by this guy.<br />
<br />
The woman walked out, followed by Ben, who gestured, &quot;Chad&#39;s got free time. You up for a workout now? Get to know how fit you are?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, that was what I hoped to do tonight.&quot; Alex nodded, and walked along into the small open side room full of chairs and computers where the trainers here did their business. It seemed Chad was the only one in tonight. He was just sitting at his computer, looking satisfied, and then he noticed Alex walk in.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you&#39;re my new client eh? How&#39;re you feeling tonight, Mr Clark?&quot; Chad grinned a little. He remembered. He had to.<br />
<br />
Alex gulped initially, but worked up his bravery to respond, &quot;I feel motivated, and like I could really stand to actually make progress in the gym tonight. I used to be fit. Really, really fit. But I got lost in my job and personal issues. But I don&#39;t want to just...rot away. I want to be fit.&quot; He sounded determined and honestly pretty energetic. He wasn&#39;t going to let any doubts get in his way.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright,&quot; Chad started, looking Alex over again, &quot;Let&#39;s get some info down about what you want. And then we can see how fit you really are right now. What do you want outta lifting weights? And what kind of journey do you see yourself going on? Where&#39;s the end goal at?&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex found himself looking down a moment, realizing he didn&#39;t really have much of an end goal beyond just fitness. He hadn&#39;t thought it over very much. He just had felt so...young, rash and impulsive all of a sudden. But he hadn&#39;t given it the thought. He looked at Chad Owens, and shook his head. Oh to be young, buff and full of cockiness like this preening young man. He realized something and came up with an answer, &quot;I want...to build a good body. An aesthetically attractive body. I want to rejoin the dating scene. Help me build a handsome, good looking body.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m admittedly probably the best guy you could come to for help on that.&quot; Chad flexed a bicep, and Alex realized - that was probably about 20 fucking inches wide. You don&#39;t realize how big these guys are until you&#39;re seated across from one of these bodybuilder types. Fuck he wished his arms could be 20 inches. &quot;I&#39;m willing to make you a diet plan if you follow it. To the letter. You get me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I got you.&quot; Alex nodded quickly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I&#39;ll show you around the gym. We&#39;re starting with...with bench press.&quot; Chad got up and started over toward the bench press and free weights area, further back in the gym. Alex grit his teeth however and followed after the enormous man. Like hell he was gonna run away or get pushed. He&#39;d show Chad he came here to lift, not be babied.</p>
