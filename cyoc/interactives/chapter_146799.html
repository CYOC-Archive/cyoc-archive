<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The huge old male stood watch over the savannah, nostrils quivering to pick up any trace of predators.  Old scars on its hide was evidence of many close calls, just as the graying fur on its muzzle was proof of its unusually long life.  More than 16 seasons had come and gone for this male, though rather oddly, its body was a few seasons older than that.  The mismatch was insignificant, as time had little meaning for the animal.  It was aware of seasons, knew when to make the great migrations, and even vaguely understood many of the mature members of the herd had been sired by him.  Only sometimes did a different awareness surface, The awareness that brought more intelligence, the reason this buck had lived so long in the harsh environment.  That other self rose to the surface now.<br />
<br />
Derrick stared out over the open plains and then back at the massive herd.  They had done well with him as one of the leaders - his animal identify was still smarter than any born wildebeest, and he had guided them in times of famine, drought, and natural disasters.  It was probably strange to take satisfaction in simple survival, but Derrick had long ago come to understand and accept his role in life as a wildebeest.  To survive and make more wildebeests.  He had done both for a long time, longer than any other member of the herd.  As a result, he was one of the very few to reach what would be considered old age.  If he concentrated hard, he could work out the time - sixteen years.  Almost as long as he had lived as a human.  Sixteen years as a prey animal, quickly learning that he and his herd were food for the predators of these plains.  Lions, hyena, wild dogs - they all hunted and killed his kind.  The idea had horrified him at first, and he had nearly been killed many times as he desperately tried to find a way back to Circe&#39;s palace.  Yet no matter how far he had traveled, there was only the plains.  It had taken a near death experience with a pack of hyenas to force acceptance.  Now it seemed foolish to him to have ever expected more from life than what he had.  Even now, as he faced imminent death either by predators or his own failing body, Derrick simply accepted that he had lived a full life for a wildebeest. What had his parents done when he disappeared?  Had his friends mourned him?  Had there been a big funeral?  The truth of his demise was more likely the shock of pain as he was torn apart and devoured.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sounds drifted in the air, oddly familiar even thought he could not recognize them.  Moving further from the snorts and shuffling of the herd, he focused and picked up cleared patterns.  Voices?  He had not seen or heard humans since he became a wildebeest.  Hunters?  Even that did not really alarm him - death was to much a part of his existence.  But no, these were mixed.  Scents could be identified now, a male, and two females.  Humans.  Curiosity won out over caution, and he shuffled towards the sources, and spotted them as he crested a rise.  They were walking, laughing, and the younger female saw him and pointed excitedly.  The group watched him in awe, but did not approach.  Then they kept walking, changing direction to avoid him.  The male looked around, and then shouted out &quot;Derrick!  Where are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Recognition hit him suddenly, though it seemed impossible.  This was his human family!  His mother, his father, his sister, all looking just as they had all those years ago!  He gave a shout of response, though it came out as his usual bellow.  His family turned to look, and then pointed and gaped in obvious fascination.  Why were they suddenly interested?<br />
<br />
Derrick caught the scent only a moment before a massive weight slammed into him from the side.  He kicked and bellowed, but the lioness already had her jaws clamped on the back of his neck.  Another struck as he stumbled, and there was searing pain as a leg bone snapped.  He fell heavily, struggling feebly as another lioness joined the first two and all three tore at his body.  There was a flash of memory - a teenage boy watching a pride of lions devour a wildebeest - it was more than similarity - Derrick understood that he had watched himself being killed and eaten, with whatever twist of time and fate repeated for his parents and sister.  He flailed as his life drained, darkness closing in as chunks were torn from his body.  There was pain, there was violence, there was...  nothing.</p>
