<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jack Crawford was in one of his favorite positions, taking his wife Kenya Adaeze-Crawford from behind. His paws had a tight grip around her furry waist, pounding her mercilessly with his thick werepanther cock, not caring whether or not its barbs hurt his werepanthress as he continued to fuck her long past her latest orgasm.<br />
All Kenya did was just stay perched on her paws, growling in intense pleasure even as she urged her mate onward, hoping that he&#39;d go so deep that Jack would physically penetrate her womb for what she heard was supposed to be the orgasm to end all orgasms.<br />
Jack came as a massive load of panther semen flooded his wife&#39;s vagina, but as he collapsed on top of her the private line in their bedroom began to ring.<br />
Angry at being interrupted from such intense sexual pleasure, Jack grabbed the phone and yelled &quot;WHAT?&quot;<br />
&quot;You told me to call when there was new news, and I have some,&quot; began Arnold Steward Stevenson, former Moon Lake Council Man, paid lackey of Crawford&#39;s, and an all around jerk.<br />
&quot;And once again, how come you&#39;re calling me and not Riley?&quot; Crawford demanded to know.<br />
&quot;That&#39;s what I tried to tell you earlier but you never gave me the chance. Riley&#39;s missing,&quot; revealed Stevenson.<br />
&quot;What do you mean, missing?&quot;<br />
&quot;He didn&#39;t show for our strategy meeting at my place this morning to go over Kenya&#39;s political announcement Monday. He&#39;s not answering his cell. Nobody&#39;s seen him since at least yesterday evening...&quot;<br />
&quot;Hmm... that damn wererat&#39;s probably either found some new bitch to shack up with or a new garbage dumpster to explore,&quot; assumed Crawford, not caring how &quot;politically incorrect&quot; that last possibility was. &quot;Anyway, what&#39;s your news?&quot;<br />
&quot;The whole town&#39;s under CODE W*,&quot; revealed Stevenson.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Why?&quot; Crawford demanded to know, even as Kenya managed to disengage herself from him and turned around to start orally licking his penis while fingering herself.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s got to be those damn Parkers,&quot; answered the weredonkey, referring to the mobsters from California who were trying to spring one of their own from the Moon Lake jail. &quot;From what I&#39;ve been picking up on my police scanner, there&#39;s been arrests at both Moon Lake Hospital AND Talbot&#39;s personal residence earlier today, and now there&#39;s some kind of big to do going down that&#39;s demanding all available units respond to the Knight Estate immediately!**&quot;<br />
&quot;DAMN!&quot; exclaimed Crawford as he sat upright in bed, as much to think over the situation as to give his wife more access to the object she craved right now. &quot;Guess it&#39;d be too much to hope for that they killed Benton, his bitch and that whelp of theirs. Then that might give me a chance to take over Knight Industries without any real heirs other than his brother Lance to fight, but the Knights would be getting off too lightly as far as I&#39;m concerned,&quot; he said, which made Stevenson glad Crawford had no reason to be mad at him.<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; continued Crawford, &quot;CODE W, won&#39;t affect our plans for Monday. It just means we&#39;ll have to pack more clothes than we originally planned to. But these mobsters could put a crimp in things. You say they&#39;re only there to get their boss&#39; son out of jail?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, and it&#39;s beginning to look as if they&#39;ll do so by <i>any</i> means possible. But he&#39;s only being held till Tuesday when the Feds pick him up on some outstanding arrest warrants they have,&quot; confirmed Stevenson. &quot;From what I hear, he did plead not guilty to all the charges coming from the jerk shooting Talbot&#39;s kid while trying to steal his car, but the Moon Lake DA is putting that trial on hold to honor the Federal charges first.&quot;<br />
&quot;Any word whether or not they&#39;ve attempted anything against Tachibana yet?&quot; wondered Crawford.<br />
&quot;Not a peep.&quot;<br />
&quot;Okay. If you&#39;re not already there, go home and stay by the phone. Unless I think of something before then, I&#39;ll see you when Kenya and I get to Moon Lake tomorrow afternoon. If anything else happens or you hear from Riley between now and then, let me know.&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m calling you from home, so no problem,&quot; agreed the weredonkey, before hanging up.<br />
As Jack Crawford leaned back and started wondering whether or not he could secretly use these Parker mobsters to wreck havoc on the town, hurting his other enemies while making Mayor Samantha Twist look bad as long as his involvement was never discovered, he allowed Kenya to enjoy a muzzle full of fresh panther cum as her tail twitched happily at the tasty treat.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
&quot;Stovall!&quot; called out the guard, approaching the prison cell.<br />
&quot;Present!&quot; replied Julie Stovall, standing upright in case it was some kind of surprise inspection. When she knew male prison employees were around, Julie tried her best to look extra sexy within the strict regulations the jail maintained, but so far none of the men had taken her up on any... offers.<br />
<i>They must all be gay,</i> Julie thought with disappointment, wondering if she would start having to attempt seducing any of the females around to get more relief than just what her own fingers provided at night after lights out.<br />
Despite being in what was considered the &quot;general population&quot;, no other female prisoner wanted to share a cell with a convicted Statute 1A violator.***<br />
&quot;Got a message for you,&quot; said the guard, which surprised the prisoner. &quot;Your mother had twins. Everyone&#39;s doing well.&quot;<br />
&quot;That&#39;s it?&quot; asked Julie, hoping there would be more details, like genders and names.<br />
&quot;All I was told,&quot; said the guard, who started to turn and walk away. But then Julie was surprised when he stopped in mid-step, turned around, and came back.<br />
&quot;Almost forgot. You got mail,&quot; he said, tossing the envelope into her cell before turning around and walking away, not knowing or remembering what he just did.<br />
Julie was totally surprised at that, for she had absolutely no mail since being incarcerated. Her parents had even cancelled all her magazine subscriptions.<br />
Puzzled, Julie cautiously walked over and picked up the envelope, which made her even more confused.<br />
It was not only fine linen, but still sealed; with no postage, return address or any other sign that it had been through the postal system.<br />
From what she had seen of other prisoners getting mail, the prison opened everything first to make sure there was no contraband or news about escape attempts in the planning stages or word of other crimes.<br />
<br />
Not knowing what else to do, Julie sat on her bed and opened the envelope.<br />
Inside was a piece of linen that matched the quality of the envelope and a small photograph.<br />
Julie looked at the photo and saw it was an image of two bassinets sitting side by side. Each was occupied by a newborn infant. One had a blue card in the front that read STOVALL: BOY while the other had a pink card in the front that read STOVALL: GIRL.<br />
She stared at the image. Julie knew she was smiling and didn&#39;t care. It was the first genuine smile she had in...<br />
Truthfully, Julie couldn&#39;t remember the last time she did smile, but it was all she could do to keep herself from crying.<br />
Then she read the letter, written in a very fine but legible script.<br />
<i>Julie,</i> it began.<br />
<i>Hopefully someday you will get to meet your younger brother Joshua, named after your grandfather, and your new sister Dawn, named for the time she was born, in person. If or when this will happen I cannot say, for the future is as much out of my hands as it is within your own, but hopefully you will heed my advice and start making it a better one than it is currently destined to be.</i><br />
The letter was signed <i>The being you call The Mysterious Stranger, among less desirable names.</i><br />
Julie reread the letter again, took another look at the photograph, and then she broke down and cried.<br />
__________________________________________________________________________<br />
*To prevent their secrets from being exposed, no were can be out and about in their fursona, not even at night.<br />
**As seen in recent episodes, some of Freddie the Shark&#39;s men decided to help themselves to some personal property that wasn&#39;t theirs, thinking there was no one home at the time.<br />
***Julie Stovall is currently within her first year of a 150 year sentence on two counts of violating Statute 1A: attempting to turn a normal into a were against their will.—tmw.</p>
