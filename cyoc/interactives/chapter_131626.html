<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You managed  to spy Frederic&#39;s car, and tailed it for awhile. You had no real way to approach him so you decided to stay in the skies for awhile, perching here and there on occasion. Half an hour later Frederic parked his car and started going into a door of a somewhat large building. You managed to fly nearby and as he was going into the building he looked at a piece of paper and said to himself &quot;Floor 5, room 23...&quot; then got inside and closed the doors. Thinking you could get a different idea you decided to go up. A couple floors later you found yourself looking into room 511 that you could see by a placard. Moving across you managed to find room 523 easily enough, mother kept you isolated but she also at  least taught you how to read. Looking into the building you see about half a dozen people  in lab coats who were chatting about something inside a science lab.<br />
<br />
One of the guys with balding hair and glasses said to his fellow scientists &quot;Hm... We&#39;ve got a fine avian right outside the window.&quot;<br />
<br />
A second guy with skin as dark as night said &quot;We don&#39;t have Hawks in the city... You thinking the same thing I am?&quot; <br />
<br />
Glasses guy asked &quot;Frederic got the elf to come willingly and she flew ahead?&quot; <br />
<br />
the second guy said &quot;Nice hypothesis. Simple test, good thing we can open these windows... The wind may be a little strong, but it shouldn&#39;t be that big of a problem.&quot; and the guy went to the window and opened it and said &quot;Hey, your that elf with Frederic right? Come in we&#39;re not going to hurt you.&quot; You were very unsure considering how little you knew what was going on. Frederic had done something with Tony/Tina. You landed and hopped inside the room with the rest of the scientists and slowly morphed your form back into the elven form with some clothes on. <br />
<br />
Glasses guy said &quot;Looks like our Hypothesis was correct.&quot; the door to the room opened and Frederic came inside with the suitcase and the glasses guy continued &quot;Ah, Welcome Frederic. Your little elf friend got here before you did.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frederic was confused and said &quot;What do you mean Joe I have her...&quot; he looked inside and saw you looking a bit angry and then said &quot;Yes that&#39;s her but then... Wait Sar who is...?&quot; Frederic went to his large suitcase. <br />
<br />
Joe said &quot;With this again Frederic. This isn&#39;t exactly a secret lab, and we aren&#39;t planning on dissecting her.&quot; <br />
<br />
The black guy nodded and said &quot;I just got a magic detector and wanted to get a few readings. Besides that I&#39;ve also got that DNA analyzer... Although considering she can turn into a Hawk that gives me a few other ideas...&quot; <br />
<br />
The suitcase was unzipped and inside it was a small elf girl who had a resemblance to  You. You went over and said &quot;Tina are you ok?&quot; Her body was still limp. <br />
<br />
Frederic said &quot;She should be awake within the half hour... Just a little tranquilizer that was diluted. When you said Tina was that one of Tony&#39;s friends?&quot; <br />
<br />
You shook your head and said &quot;So um... funny story. My magic let me change into things I knew... and then something Tony said gave me an idea and it sort of expanded my magic. It doesn&#39;t last forever but I can somewhat change others into new forms.&quot; Looking over at the suitcase filled with cushions and  Tina the little elf girl&#39;s body started to grow as her ears became less pointed. You continued &quot;Looks like it&#39;s over already... I guess if there&#39;s the  potential for it already in the person the  changes can last a lot longer.&quot; Frederic sighed and got a sad look on his face. The old man was looking at a girl who looked a lot like his old wife and felt a bit of grief. <br />
<br />
The black guy clapped his hands and said &quot;So then. How about we try some of these machines out. Let&#39;s get the DNA Analyzer going and then try out the magic detector.&quot; After a sharp prick of the finger (everyone was getting their DNA analyzed) you started at the magic detector. You tried changing yourself but apparently there wasn&#39;t enough &quot;residual magic&#39; to detect. However when you tried to put your tendrils to the machine it started beeping like crazy as it took readings. Apparently you couldn&#39;t change inorganic materials. <br />
<br />
In the suitcase Tina opened her eyes and asked &quot;Pops... what&#39;s going on? Why&#39;s my finger sore?&quot; <br />
<br />
Frederic looked back to his Son... daughter and said &quot;Sorry about the mix up... I am...  bad at lying. Did something bad because i&#39;m bad at hiding secrets... Thought  Sar would be excited about the DNA tests and ... messed up bad. Speaking of how are the tests coming?&quot; <br />
<br />
Joe looking at some of the results said &quot;Well let&#39;s start with the Frederic bunch as they are probably the most interesting. That magic must have done wonders as his son... daughter&#39;s DNA has actually came up as two X chromosomes.&quot; Tina crossed her arms over where her womb may have been a  little embarrassed for some reason that she was really a girl. Joe continued &quot;The machine matches her as Frederic&#39;s offspring, and with the database has even matched her with her mother&#39;s DNA. Now onto Sar here...&quot;  A few clicks latter and he said &quot;Well then her mother isn&#39;t listed... I guess it makes sense since she just lives off in the middle of the woods and her father... &quot; Joe continued to type out a few things quickly and said &quot;Frederic you said she may have had a father city or nearby the woods?&quot; <br />
<br />
Frederic nodded and said &quot;Yes, probably more near the woods as no one inside the actual woods took ownership.&quot; <br />
<br />
Joe asked &quot;How good is your memory?&quot; <br />
<br />
Frederic pushed him aside and said &quot;Let me just take a look and... Wait that makes no sense... I would&#39;ve remembered something like that!&quot; <br />
<br />
Joe tilted his head and said &quot;Maybe there&#39;s some odd hormonal thing that provides an odd response to a mate?&quot; <br />
<br />
Frederic thought and said &quot;I do remember when her mother came to the town... she was overflowing with pheromones and I did write down a few things about their affects... However I don&#39;t remember doing that.&quot; <br />
<br />
Sar asked &quot;So who is my father?&quot; <br />
<br />
Frederic and Joe looked at each other and then Frederic said &quot;Well... I am. At least according to the DNA test to an error of... .0001% so you basically are without a reasonable doubt my daughter.&quot; <br />
<br />
Tina looked shocked and said &quot;but... You had mommy right?&quot; <br />
<br />
Frederic said &quot;Listen, I was not in a sound state of mind at the time. The pheromones had certain affects similar to the tranquilizer.&quot; <br />
<br />
Tina said &quot;Just leave me be for now...&quot; and then curled into the padded suitcase. It was a little awkward, but after a few more magic tests you, Tina and Frederic went back to their apartment where...</p>
