<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The Blue Boxer parked his Boxermobile in the spot hidden not far from the Central Police Department of Grit City. He quickly punched the hands-free cellphone built into his tactical suit and called his sidekick, The Khaki Karateka to see where he was at. After dialing once, twice, and thrice, the Blue Boxer figured that Ken would get here when he got here, and so the Blue Boxer hustled off for the dark city park across the street where the Blue Boxer and Detective O&#39;Reilly would meet when the Glove Signal would shine in the sky from atop the Central Police Department.<br />
<br />
The Blue Boxer didn&#39;t have to search hard to find the graying haired old man in a trench coat sitting on the park bench near the duck pond.<br />
<br />
&quot;The kid not joining us this evening?&quot; asked the Detective.<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;ll be here, he&#39;s just running a little late.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Teenagers, they&#39;re either too early or too late, but never on time,&quot; quipped the Detective as he lit a cigar.<br />
<br />
&quot;Want one?&quot; asked the Detective.<br />
<br />
&quot;If I&#39;m to keep in top physical condition, then the answer remains no.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you&#39;ll still take the second hand smoke, regardless.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not that I don&#39;t appreciate your company, Detective, but what is the threat you&#39;ve summoned me for?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A new Supervillain has joined the underworld, according to my sources on the inside. Goes by the name of The Harried Homemaker.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Detective handed over a manila envelope which, when opened, the Blue Boxer found a few candid shots of a sweet demure looking housewife who looked to be from the late 1950s or early 1960s, serving cupcakes to the underground villains he normally took out--the Mad Magician, Flatulent Fatso, Sheriff Yee Haw, Sorcerer Scientist, and more. And in the next photo she had a smile on as those other villains seemed to be choking on said cupcakes. And the last photo was of her smile being joined by a glare at the camera while piles of super villains&#39; clothes with innocent-looking childish faces staring out of them surrounded her.<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s risen to the top of the underground has she?&quot; asked The Boxer with a bit of suspicion.<br />
<br />
&quot;The dame may look like Laura Petri, but she&#39;s more Bewitched than Mayberry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And more Cousin Serena, than Samantha Stevens?&quot; added the Blue Boxer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Always knew you were a classic sitcom fan,&quot; said the Detective.<br />
<br />
&quot;And where was this Harried Homemaker last seen?&quot; asked the Blue Boxer after some silence.<br />
<br />
&quot;Last report we had was the Super Villains&#39; Annual Banquet of Villainy, of which you&#39;ve seen the pictures.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And the Police Department allows them to congregate for such a banquet?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You kidding? Besides that being a first amendment issue we can&#39;t arrest them for, it&#39;s also one of the few nights a year we are guaranteed to have the night off from Super Villains.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what made you call me tonight?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s some odd things happening in parks--people coming out not the same way they went in, and such. Last thing the City Council needs is to completely redo everyone&#39;s paperwork. For right now it&#39;s mostly confined to the fringe outer parks along the Northside, but this evening something happened right here in this very park, just before sunset. An old couple came into the park and vanished--a boy playing with his ball did the same. And yet, out of the park came a couple of kids with a father--who hadn&#39;t entered the park.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;About where did this exchange of people take place?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Across the duck pond, near the old boat house. It&#39;s why I had us sit here, to see...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;To see?&quot; asked the Blue Boxer.<br />
<br />
&quot;To see if there was any hint of anything out of the ordinary... but I&#39;ve sat here for well over an hour and nothing... at least nothing&#39;s visible from here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Care to join me, detective?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think that&#39;s wise. Besides, I best be getting home, before the wife starts wondering where I got to,&quot; said the detective as he twisted his cigar against the stone support of the bench and then pocketed it for later. He stood up and walked down the path towards the exit, leaving The Blue Boxer waiting on Ken to catch up. Luckily the sound of a moped speeding and then puttering as it came to a stop was not far behind the departure of the detective. The Blue Boxer soon came to the entrance that his protege had parked his moped by, and was currently locking it to a lamp post.<br />
<br />
&quot;Every kid wants to be a super hero, until they learn how much traffic and finding a parking spot takes a toll on getting to the scene on time,&quot; muttered the Khaki Karateka as The Blue Boxer approached.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did I say anything?&quot; asked the Blue Boxer.<br />
<br />
&quot;You didn&#39;t have to.&quot;<br />
<br />
After the moped was secured, the Blue Boxer pointed them in the direction of the long path around the duck pond and brought his sidekick up to speed.<br />
<br />
&quot;So we&#39;re looking for some sort of magical housewife? Should I call Paramount and say they have the potential for a classic sitcom revival on their hands?&quot; asked the Khaki Karateka as they approached the boat house.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just be careful, Khaki.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Khaki Karateka opened the door to the boathouse and gave it a quick examination.<br />
<br />
&quot;It seems like a perfectly normal and ordinary boathouse to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Blue Boxer, poked his head in to be sure, and the kid was right, besides a winterized old wooden rowboat that looked like it could use a good caulking, there was nothing out of the ordinary about the boathouse.<br />
<br />
&quot;Help! Blue Boxer! Help!&quot; cried a voice from across the duck pond. The boathouse door was closed and latched before Grit City&#39;s finest vigilante and his sidekick turned to try and see across the pond--only to see someone he couldn&#39;t quite make out over by the bench that the Blue Boxer had been at with the detective.<br />
<br />
The Blue Boxer headed back the way they came instead of trudging on the rest of the path around the duck pond, knowing that at least this way there wouldn&#39;t be some unexpected trap for him and Ken to trigger.<br />
<br />
But the Blue Boxer had perhaps thought too soon as nets flew over The Blue Boxer&#39;s and Khaki Karateka&#39;s heads. Blue and Khaki tried their best to duck out of the way, only to find his footing slip and the Blue Boxer fell into the shallow, muddy duck pond with weeds that tangled and wrapped their way about his feet. His captors had netted Ken, and had him captured moments later. His captors looking like two muscle-bound bodybuilders from the early 1950s.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well lookie here. It seems you boys have made some friends. Well don&#39;t just stand there, invite them over for a warm meal and a cool drink,&quot; said a voice from the shadows, and out stepped a seemingly ordinary woman, dressed in a trench coat with white gloves and a barely ornamental hat over her early 1960s attire and coiffed hair. A string of pearls was about her throat and a pair of matching pearl earrings adorned her ears. She looked as if she had stepped out of a time before the Beatles had played on Ed Sullivan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let us go!&quot; yelled Khaki Karateka while Blue Boxer tried and failed to escape his captors and bindings once ashore.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, don&#39;t you boys know it&#39;s rude to refuse a guest when they&#39;ve offered hospitality? It seems I&#39;m going to have to dig out my Emily Post books and teach you boys some manners when we get home, but until then... nighty night, boys.&quot;<br />
<br />
And with a simple touch of her gloved hand, the Blue Boxer found himself drowsing until he fell asleep, with Ken not far behind him.</p>
