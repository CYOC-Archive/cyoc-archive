<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sean were running through the little forest, the roots wasn't as easy in the darkness compared to Jeff when he flew like the wind through the green. Sean breathes heavily as he sees Jeff's house. He knew that this was something very special, his friend was a wolf morph, that didn't happen every day. Jeff was always told to cut the grass with the old lawn mower, which always never worked, so the grass was quite tall and unkempt. Sean sighs as he walks by the quite big paw markings on the ground, and looks at it with interest. He nod for himself and think about the possibilities and walks up to the house and looks at a rusty ladder going to the garage roof. With a sigh, he grabs the first step with his hand and feel how the surface of rust crush under his hand. The shadow climbs the ladder, and now with a very careful look around, especially after a angry, single mother with the bad habit to throw bottles at sight of a pretended robber. Sean have heard how the postman got a hit once in the head. He crouches and walk along the roof to the balcony, that he knows is out of reach, but he have thought about this before. If he walks up further on the roof, there's a ladder which he can climb up on, and then when above the balcony, he just simply jumps down. But as everybody knows, it can be a bit more complicated than that when you are standing on the third floor jumping down one. But now it had a important meaning, last time he tried it because that he needed to copy some off Jeff's papers before a test. But that's pretty normal. He looked nervously around the area and the road, and with a agile jump he reached the ladder and climbed further on to the higher roof. He was careful not to cause any sound that could wake his sister up, she could be a real pain in the ass, and he didn't have her as sister too. He walked down to the ledge of the roof and swallowed hard. Far...far away were the balcony compared to the little afraid creature. He turned around to take his hands on the rail on the roof and then release and hopefully, land safely without the balcony boards to crush...oh was he worried...<br />
Sean leaned backwards and slipped one leg of the ledge, felt it dangling in the emptiness underneath him. He slipped the other one down, and was now holding on to the rail hard. &quot;I can't do this!&quot;, he said to himself, and he looked down. His hands lost the grip because of numbness and slippery iron, and he saw how he fell. With a heavy thud he landed on the boards, and he groaned. He had managed to land on some pots that luckily didn't break. But his back were hurting like hell. He groaned once more as he raised with one hand on his back, taking his hand on the handle and open it slowly. &quot;Finally...&quot;, he thought. Everything was quiet inside, and he was excited. He took one step on the floor, the stairs creaked a little beside him, but no response of the habitants of the house. He hurried into Jeff's room, and opened the door. It actually smelled a little like dog, or wolf...but he did know that something smelled a bit more different there. He walked up to the computer, and saw the CD drive on the floor, didn't take much notice of it, but took the little device on the computer, and turned around quickly. He had his foot in front of the chairs leg as he took that step that made the whole chair fall. &quot;Jesus!&quot;, he made a hissing sound, and he step on the CD driver as he ran to the stairs, and while he ran, he heard how Jeff's mom woke up downstairs! But now or never, he couldn't jump out of the balcony, so he ran down the stairs quickly, heard steps from Jeff's mom, he grabbed the lock and opened quickly, and ran as fast as he could out on the street. Somewhere behind him, he heard how she screamed and something crashed beside him, &quot;probably a bottle...&quot;, and he smiled as he ran behind the road lights and into the forest. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Jeff was trying his body out. He was crouching on the floor and tried to stand on fours. It went pretty well, but he wasn't used to it yet. He swished his tail, looked in the mirror on his fangs and pointed with his paw and felt how it itched on his pads as blood came out from the fresh wound. &quot;Ouch, I guess new fangs are sharper...&quot;. He was actually feeling comfortable now in his body. He was more powerful than before, and he didn't flew his muscles, but he looked at him instead, the big body, the fur that covered all of him, his chest, the paws, the hind legs...and the face. The wolf face looked quite a lot like him...in some kind of way. Like it was him, but in another shape, but his face still looked like &quot;Jeff&quot; he knew. He couldn't really explain it...<br />
Jeff swished with his tail and listened for more sounds, and snapped up Sean's parents in some kind of argumentation. He couldn't explain the bliss to be in the shape. It stretched his world of 'reality'. People weren't supposed to be something else, that was almost just a bad thing, like being black, or at least it was like that before. But who wanted to be something else? It felt actually very interesting and exciting, and he couldn't stop knuckle his paw and try his new voice out with a low growl that actually sounded like a real growl. While trying to stand on all fours, he heard how something was coming at the door, and he raised quickly and waited for Sean to come in. But who came in?...</p>
