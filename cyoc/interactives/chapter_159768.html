<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next morning was downright beautiful: It greeted me with singing birds and warm sunshine. Apparently, I had woken up before Bruce, so I left the roomy tent as silently as I could and stretched myself. I was rather thirsty, so after taking a leak in the nearby bushes, I went to the stream to taste the water. It was wonderful; I never knew just water could taste so good. I must have spent several minutes, just sipping the cool water, when I heard Bruce leaving the tent and going to the bushes himself. <br />
He must have chosen a spot closer by, because I could clearly hear him unzipping his jeans and, shortly after, a splashing sound on the ground and leaves. I decided to just sit it out, because getting up now would have been really weird.<br />
The sound of him urinating against the foliage sounded oddly pleasing and steadily, reminding me that I was still thirsty. I took another sip or two from the stream, while I waited a fair bit for Bruce to finish his business.<br />
The morning was pretty uneventful. We ate, and after that, we did what we came here for: Nothing. That was not entirely correct, of course, since Bruce had some books with him, which he immediately indulged in, and I wanted to learn woodcarving.<br />
It must have been early afternoon, when I noticed the shadow of a beard in Bruce&#39;s face. I never thought he had much of facial hair growing, but apparently I had been wrong: The dude probably had to shave thoroughly every morning to maintain his business-y appearance. <br />
I briefly wondered what I looked like. In the washhouse, there had been a mirror, but it was nearly blind and I did not care enough to clean it. When I felt my own chin, it was only the usual stubble, so nothing special. <br />
While I was still musing about beards, Bruce got up and stretched, before leaving for the bushes again. Something seemed a bit off in his appearance, but I couldn&#39;t really put my fingers on it.<br />
I could hear the splashing sound of him urinating into the wild again clearly, while I absent-mindedly took a gulp from my water bottle. It was weird: the constant splashing was both mesmerizingly relaxing and somehow exciting. <br />
I must have spaced out there a bit, because the next thing I heard was Bruce concerned voice: &quot;Ryan, are you okay?&quot; When I nodded, he continued: &quot;Were you dreaming? You just sat there.&quot; After my reaction, his voice had become cheerful again. &quot;And obviously, you had some pleasant dreams, sorry for interrupting&quot;. <br />
He must have caught my confused look, as he nodded towards my lap. I followed his gaze and saw I had a raging erection, clearly visible through my sweatpants. God, was that embarrasing! I didn&#39;t even notice! I blushed, but thankfully, Bruce just chuckled and went back to his book, while I squirmed to make my rod less obvious. <br />
When I looked at Bruce after a while of mental struggle to will my cock down, once again I had the impression something was off about him. Besides the dense stubble on his face, he looked like he had some more hairs on his arms as well, but that was not everything. He somehow seemed to fill out his t-shirt a bit better, having a small gut and some chest definition hinted at under the fabric. I must have missed that yesterday, when we arrived; obviously, Bruce had decided to work out a bit. That did seem very unlike him though, but perhaps he was dating some girl and wanted to impress her. I was just about to ask him, when I remembered my recent situation and decided not to make the day any weirder than it already was. My dick had also not softened up completly, leaving me with a semi, so I just got back to my woodcarving.<br />
When we had dinner that evening, I couldn&#39;t help but notice that Bruce was eating a lot. The fresh air must have awoken his appetite, judging by the amount of instant mashed potatoes he was shoving into himself. I was not that hungry but drank a lot, feeling a bit parched. So far, this whole holiday was going quite well - I felt a lot more relaxed all in all, and the air and fresh water really lifted my spirits. <br />
Bruce and I chatted the entire evening. He had always been really easy to talk to and we had lots of common interests. It felt good to just be in a friendly and unstressed atmosphere for a change. It was late when we finally turned in, and I fell asleep almost immediately after getting in my sleeping bag.</p>
