<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Riley is sitting in maths class, this is one of the very few classes he attends which also Jeff attends, the 14 year-old looks over at Jeff, the 16 year-old has his nose in his math’s book, when Riley suddenly gets an idea, the boy grins to himself, ‘I always wanted a dog,’ he thinks to himself, ‘I think I know exactly what I’ll do: I’ll turn Jeff into my sweet little obedient puppy, which I’ll train to become an amazing companion’.<br />
<br />
So, while the teacher continues to brabble away, Riley secretly pulls out his phone and opens the App. Riley then opens Jeff’s file, which he previously transferred from Jeff App over to his, after downloading and installing the App on his phone.<br />

Riley grins, ‘this is going to be fun,’ he thinks to himself, he looks up at Jeff, ‘hmm… I think I’ll turn him into a Malinois, a short-haired shepherd from Belgium. They are one of the smartest dogs, and great guard dogs,’ with that Riley starts to edit Jeff’s file.<br />

Reality alteration: every one, except for Jeff and Riley, will think Jeff is a dog<br />
<br />
Riley grins to himself as he looks over the changes he made, ‘hehe… it’ll take a few days, maybe weeks for Jeff to fully transform,’ he thinks to himself, ‘he’ll transform a little more every day, first his hearing and sense of smell will increase, and will lose some of his smarts, but gain “dog smarts”… hehe! I can take away his ability to talk once he is halfway being a dog, or maybe sooner. I’ll know when the time is right,’ with that, Riley confirms the change. Riley puts his phone back in his pocket and looks up at Jeff, ‘having Jeff keep his human name, for now, but adding his “dog name” he’ll react to both names,’ the boy thinks to himself, he then hears Jeff groan and clutch his head. Seeing this causes Riley to grin more, ‘looks like his mind is already changing,’ he thinks to himself, ‘can’t wait to try it out later’.<br />
<br />
As soon as Riley confirmed the changes, Jeff feels a strange pins and needles sensation run through his whole body, causing him to shiver a little, ‘what the hell was that,’ he asks himself, then he notices that for some reason the room seems to become louder and much more annoying than before. Jeff groans and clutches his head as a strong headache suddenly starts up, causing his head to throb, the teen inhales deeply, while rubbing his temples, trying to clear his head and sooth the pain. As Jeff continues to breath in deeply through his nose, he can’t help but notice all the smells, the teen scrunches up his nose and stares at his table partner, who just grins at him, “dude, when was the last time you took a shower,” Jeff asks, “you stink!”<br />
<br />
Jeff’s friend blinks in surprise, “oh… um… two days ago,” he says, sounding almost sheepishly.<br />
<br />
Jeff widens his eyes, “say what,” he asks, “dude, you should take a shower every day, you really smell bad. Now I know why girls tend to take a huuuuge circle around you”.<br />
<br />
Riley is grinning as he listens, ‘looks like his sense of smell has increased, and apparently also his hearing,’ the boy thinks to himself, ‘the noise must be giving him a headache. Poor thing… hehe… don’t worry River, soon you will not have to endure this anymore’.<br />
<br />
Jeff turns back to his book, the headache slowly subsiding, when he looks down at his maths book, he lifts an eyebrow, ‘what the hell is this,’ he asks himself, ‘I feel as if I should KNOW what these symbols mean… but… it just doesn’t make any sense to me’. Jeff tries to put his finger on it, but he soon gives up and shrugs, ‘I guess it’s nothing important,’ he thinks to himself, ‘the only things I need to know is to follow commands and obey my master… wait… what am I thinking? What is happening to me? I feel so confused… I need some fresh air’. Jeff raises a hand, “Mr. Huff,” he says.<br />
<br />
Mr. Huff looks up from his desk and over at Jeff, ‘who brought a bloody dog into class? And WHY the HELL is it wearing clothes,’ the man asks himself, “what do you want,” he then asks.<br />
<br />
“I… I don’t feel well,” Jeff says, “could… could I go out and have some fresh air?”<br />
<br />
Mr. Huff hesitates, he tilts his head, ‘I really don’t want a dog running around on its own,’ he thinks to himself.<br />
<br />
As if reading the teacher’s thoughts, Riley suddenly speaks up, “if it’d be okay with you, sir,” he says, “I’ll go with him. I need the toilette anyway”.<br />
<br />
Mr. Huff looks over at the younger boy, “fine,” he says, “get out”.<br />
<br />
Jeff and Riley get up from their seats, Jeff turns to Riley, a confused expression on his face, “Riley, why do you have to accompany me,” he asks.<br />
<br />
Riley walks up to Jeff, the boy smiles, “to make sure nothing happens,” he says, “you really don’t look good, and you seem to be somewhat confused. So, it’s for the best if I tag along, just in case something should happen”.<br />
<br />
Jeff rolls his eyes, “fine… I’m not in the mood to start an argument,” he says, he then turns and heads out the door.<br />
<br />
When Riley passes the teacher’s desk, he feels a strong hand grab his arm, he turns to see Mr. Huff glaring down at him. “Next time, keep your dog at home,” he says, “he’s annoying and distracts everyone from their tasks. Understood?”<br />
<br />
Riley grins inwardly, ‘awesome! It really works,’ he thinks to himself, “y-yes, sir,” he then says.<br />
<br />
“Good,” Mr. Huff says and lets go of the boy.<br />
<br />
After Mr. Huff let Riley go, Riley walks out to find an impatient Jeff waiting for him, “what took you?”<br />
<br />
“Mr. Huff held me up,” Riley says, “you know how he is”.<br />
<br />
Jeff nods, “let’s go,” he then says, he turns and starts to head down the hall, Riley following behind.<br />
<br />
Riley grins, ‘good time to see if he follows a command,’ he thinks to himself, “River, heel, boy,” he then says.<br />
<br />
Jeff immediately lets himself fall back and starts to walk calmly beside Riley, matching the boy’s pace.<br />
<br />
Riley smiles, “good boy,” he says.<br />
<br />
Hearing this, Jeff feels a strange sense of pride rise up in him, “the fuck is wrong with me,” he mumbles, “w-why am I doing what you are saying?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know,” Riley lies, “maybe some kind of weird phase?”<br />
<br />
“I… I don’t know,” Jeff says, “I… I feel so confused and tense”.<br />
<br />
Riley is about to say something as they pass the men’s room, “sorry, but I need to use the toilette,” he says, “be a good boy, River, and stay! I’ll be right back”.<br />
<br />
Jeff feels his body freeze, “the fuck,” he says, “wh-why can’t I move? Why am I obeying some dumb ass dog commands? This is fucked up! What is happening to me, and why is everyone treating me like a dumb mutt?”<br />
<br />
Riley smirks inwardly, ‘works better than I thought,’ he thinks to himself, he then shrugs, “maybe you are a really a dog that got transformed into a human by something or someone?”<br />
<br />
“Impossible,” Jeff says, “there is no way… unless…,” he cuts himself off.<br />
<br />
“Unless, what,” Riley asks.<br />
<br />
“N-nothing,” Jeff says, ‘I doubt Riley has something to do with this, and I really don’t want him to know about the App,’ unaware that it is Riley’s doing, ‘who knows what he might do’.<br />
<br />
Riley smirks inwardly, ‘hehe… he looks so lost and confused,’ he thinks to himself, “hey, don’t worry, we’ll figure this out. But first: I REALLY need to go! I’ll be right back,” with that, Riley hurries into the men’s room, leaving a confused Jeff in the hallway.<br />
<br />
While Riley is on the toilette, Jeff tries once again to move, but it seems that his body is not obeying his commands. “This is so fucked up,” the teen mumbles to himself, “why am I thinking of Riley being my owner? Why do I suddenly smell and hear much better? Why do I have the urge to sniff at butts? Why do I feel uncomfortable wearing clothes? I have so many questions! What is happening!?”<br />
<br />
When Riley returns after five minutes, he finds Jeff just staring blankly in front of himself, “River, I’m back,” he says, causing Jeff to let out a yelp of surprise, “he… sorry, boy. Didn’t mean to surprise you”.<br />
<br />
“Sto-stop… stop treating me as if I were your Mutt! I am NOT your dog! I’m NOONE’S dog,” Jeff says, even letting out a growl, “what the fuck?! Did… did I just growl!? Seriously: what the FUCK is going on?!”.<br />
<br />
“Hey, hey,” Riley says, “calm down. We’ll figure it out, I promise, let’s get you outside,” Riley continues, “I believe this whole environment is really confusing and scaring you”. Riley turns and starts to walk down the hallway, towards the exit, “come, River,” he calls over his shoulder, “and heel”. Riley then places a hand on Jeff’s back, once he takes his spot at Riley’s side, and starts to stroke, rub and scritch it as they walk towards the exit.<br />
<br />
When Riley tells him to come and heel, Jeff finds himself once again obeying the commands, and when he feels Riley’s hand on his back and the younger boy starting to stroke, rub and scritch him, he tenses. Jeff turns to look at Riley and opens his mouth to yell at the smaller boy, asking what he is thinking and to quit it, but he must admit that it does kind of feel good and even finds it relaxing, so he just lets it happen.<br />
<br />
Noticing Jeff relaxing from the stroking, rubbing and scratching, causes Riley to smile, “feeling a little better,” he asks.<br />
<br />
“It… ye-yeah,” Jeff says, as they walk out the main entrance of the school and head towards a bench.<br />
<br />
When they reach the bench, Riley sits down on it, Jeff on the other hand just stands in front of it, a confused expression on his face. Riley grins inwardly, “what wrong, River,” he asks.<br />
<br />
Jeff stares at the boy, “that. Is. NOT. My. Name! Stop calling me that,” he says, “wh-why are you treating me as if I were your dog?”<br />
<br />
Riley, keeping on pretending to have no idea of what is happening, to prevent from Jeff becoming suspicious, shrugs, “I don’t know,” he says, “I… I just feel as though I have always been your owner and that you have always been my dog. Do you think… what ever is happening to you, is somehow affecting me too?”<br />
<br />
Jeff tilts his head thoughtfully, Riley has to bite his tongue to prevent himself from chuckling at the sight, “I… it seems that way,” Jeff says, ‘if that is the case, then Riley has nothing to do with my situation, he is just a victim to who ever is messing with me, just like me. I guess… I guess it couldn’t hurt to tell him about the App, maybe he’d even help me finding out who it is and have him or her revert everything back to normal,’ he then thinks to himself.<br />
<br />
“What are you thinking, River,” Riley asks.<br />
<br />
Jeff flinches, he then lets out a sigh, “I… I guess you are unable to call me by my real name,” he says.<br />
<br />
Riley acts surprised, “your real name,” he asks, “but… “River” IS your real name”.<br />
<br />
Jeff shakes his head, “no… no it’s “Jeff”, not “River”… it… it seems that, who ever is messing with me is also messing with you and probably he or she also altered the reality”.<br />
<br />
Riley smirks inwardly, ‘hehe… man, I never thought I am such a good actor,’ he thinks to himself, “what… what are you talking about,” he then asks.<br />
<br />
Jeff hesitates, “I… I dunno if I can trust you,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Listen, you can trust me,” he says, “I am just as confused as you are. So, why don’t you SIT and tell me what is going on”.<br />
<br />
The second Riley utters the word “sit”, Jeff lets out a yelp when he finds himself squatting down, his bum on the ground, his knees bent and his hands flat on the ground between his legs. Jeff looks up at Riley and even lets out a whimper, “th-this is so fucking humiliating!”<br />
<br />
Riley grins inwardly, “hey, at least you aren’t naked,” he says.<br />
<br />
Jeff blushes and turns his head away, remembering that he is wearing clothes, causes him yet again to find the restricting cloth uncomfortable, this causes Jeff to fidget a little.<br />
<br />
“River,” Riley asks, “you okay?”<br />
<br />
Jeff, still looking away, mumbles something.<br />
<br />
“What,” Riley asks, “I didn’t hear you”.<br />
<br />
Jeff lets out a grumble, he then turns to look at Riley, his face red like a tomato, “I… I said, that… that I… I feel uncomfortable wearing clothes,” he says.</p>
