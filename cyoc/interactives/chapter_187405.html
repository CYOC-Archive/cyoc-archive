<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Harper sat quietly in the waiting room at Dino City&#39;s Horizon office. It was one of the few places where there weren&#39;t specialized chairs that had seemed to pop up everywhere Animalians had been, and that made sense. While a fair number of Animalians were about the same size as people, there were others that were much larger. That then meant that the larger the Animalian got, the more support or greater size they needed. In places where large and small Animalians lived, things like chairs and furniture had to be rather adjustable, and that really applied in Dino City where there were some Dinotopians that looked to be as tall as he was now and some that would make the Giraffe Animalians look extremely short by comparison. It was something that showed how much of a size difference there was with regard to Dinotopians. But in an area where there would only be Humans, that issue wasn&#39;t as big of a thing.<br />
<br />
But that wasn&#39;t too much of an issue as he thought over his career as a park ranger, and how old age had started to catch up with him and his co-workers had been pushing him toward retirement. They&#39;d thrown him a party and congratulated him for all he&#39;d done and everything, but he didn&#39;t really see that as the end that he wanted, and at the same time there was Dakota to think off. He&#39;d ultimately gotten the permission to keep and raise Dakota on a sort of &quot;sanctuary status,&quot; given how he&#39;d found her. Her parents had nested not too far from where his station was, and that was ultimately part of how he found her after falling out of the nest. The parents had gone or didn&#39;t know where she was and her wings were beat up enough that putting her back in the nest would be a death sentence. Surgery had gotten all the bones back in the right place, but had also found that her muscles had seriously atrophied as part of the healing process. That then limited what Dakota could do, and thus Harper had held onto her and did his best to protect her.<br />
<br />
It then influenced his decision to uplift her into a Dinotopian. Not just because it was something he considered, if only to get his youth back, but also to assure that Dakota wouldn&#39;t be put in a situation where she might get harmed. And since the Dromaeosaurs like Dakotaraptor were more like birds than even most other larger Theropods were, Harper didn&#39;t think the conversion would be too much of a loss for her. The herm element, though, was a bit of a surprise. He didn&#39;t expect that Horizon would want to do that to her, though a part of him thought over it and figured it might help with some of his more bi-sexual leanings. He&#39;d never considered there being anything wrong with his gender, but if he was attracted both... a part of him rationalized things to accept why not be both. So he&#39;d sat alone with his thoughts until he&#39;d heard a pair of footsteps approaching.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. Hawkins?&quot; came Jeremy&#39;s voice, making him look up to see the imposing male Syntixisaurus Dinotopian standing there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is Dakota alright?&quot; Harper asked as he stood up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shi is doing quite well,&quot; Jeremy answered, &quot;and is actually looking to see you again and work through your conversion.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s not upset?&quot; Harper wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Jeremy nodded, &quot;SHI isn&#39;t.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shi?&quot; Harper wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;A specialized term the Animalian herms have come up with to define themselves as being both male and female,&quot; Jeremy answered, &quot;I think they mix &quot;she&quot; and &quot;him&quot; to get &quot;shi.&quot; Though that&#39;s a guess on my part, so don&#39;t quote me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harper nodded and followed Jeremy to the door that lead to the transformation room. Harper entered the room to find the lights were on, but relatively dim. In some ways, it was almost at a romantic setting and something that would allow Harper to miss somethings if he wasn&#39;t paying full attention. He could see the the specialized hood that he had used at times when needing to take Dakota in for veterinary visits laying on the floor. He thought he saw something that looked like semen also laying on the floor, but for the moment he couldn&#39;t see Dakota.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, Harper,&quot; a voice came from his right. It was higher than what one would expect from a man and lower than what would expect from a woman.<br />
<br />
That got him to turn to his right where he found Dakota sitting on a rather large bed and looking toward him. He could tell it was hir based on the fact that this new Dinotopian still had an Osprey&#39;s coloring to its feathers, something that he&#39;d read about in relation to how back-tracking bird evolution to convert them into Dinotopians. Unlike with Human to Animalian/Dinotopian conversions where the individual would take on the colorations and builds of the animals in question or what was seen as likely... thus why Dino City&#39;s major and his wife were both shades of blue, because birds were considered the &quot;dinosaurs that survived the KT-extinction event&quot; it seemed that the coloration in their feathers seemed to stay the same. He&#39;d read about to African Gray Parrots that had been uplifted into Microraptors which retained their gray coloration with red tails even though some fossil evidence indicated that Microraptor was actually an iridescent black color.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dakota?&quot; Harper said to hir, &quot;is that you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Dakota answered, &quot;I am to understand you wish to be like what I have become...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d wanted to be a Dinotopian, yes,&quot; Harper admitted, &quot;the hermaphrodite thing was a surprise but well... it was a way to get my conversion quicker and they assured me that you&#39;d be okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I am,&quot; Dakota answered, &quot;Different and it will take some adjustments... but I am fine. And I am looking forward to claiming my mate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re...&quot; Harper said slowly and feeling his penis stir at looking at Dakota&#39;s breasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Dakota answered, &quot;I wasn&#39;t too far from flying when I fell out of my nest... and I can&#39;t say on where my parents went. But you did see that I was cared for and protected, even if the injuries meant I wouldn&#39;t fly... regardless of your medicine. And I remember you saying you&#39;d seen beauty in me. I... I must admit that I liked that... and I still do. So I would love to be your mate. We&#39;ll be together and become our own nesting pair.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I... well... I&#39;d thought you&#39;d accept the conversion and then go your own way,&quot; Harper began.<br />
<br />
&quot;And why would I go off and leave someone I know and has been kind to me?&quot; Dakota answered as shi slid off the bed and approached him. Harper noted her now taller height as she approached and not subtly began to undress him. &quot;You&#39;ve loved me... and that makes me love you. So, I would be more than happy to convert you into a Herm Dinotopian like me... and we&#39;ll learn about things together.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harper returned the hug and noted that hir feathers felt the same as before, and thus did his best to make sure he didn&#39;t move them out of position or alignment. He also noted that the long tail feathers that she normally had now fanned out at the end of a long tail which was mostly covered in the shorter body feathers that ran down it.  Though the hug also put him closer to the impressive orbs on hir chest which only stirred more attention from member, which brought him a bit of shyness out of him. For while Dakota had been an adult by an Osprey&#39;s standards before her uplifting, she would still be young when compared to him and a part of him felt a bit embarrassed at feeling attracted to the young Herm Dinotopian before him.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t mind my age?&quot; Harper asked as Dakota lifted up his shirt and then began fiddling with his pants.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your age will come down once you&#39;ve gotten your two doses from me,&quot; Dakota answered which finally got Harper to actually help.<br />
<br />
He raised one foot to untie one shoe and let that slip off and then did the same with the other shoe and slipping that off. That then made it easier for his pants to slide down once Dakota managed to work the button and the zipper on his pants. They then fell down to reveal his underwear, which was struggling to hide his erection, which Dakota actually licked hir lips at.  Shi then moved to pull at the sides of Harper&#39;s underwear and then pull down, revealing his erect penis that stood out before him. It wasn&#39;t huge and to a degree it was tickled a bit against Dakota&#39;s feathers.  Though it wasn&#39;t long before Harper also felt something emerge from the slit between Dakota&#39;s legs. Birds, like reptiles traditionally only had a slit-like opening called a cloaca that then covered all of the male and female equipment and in many flying birds, the penis was ultimately lost completely to save on weight, while reptiles and flightless birds birds retained it. <br />
<br />
Some flying birds did retain it though, and from reports that came from Horizon, it appeared that all Bird Animalians regained the appendage and that a female&#39;s opening would look more like a Human woman&#39;s vagina in females and even males. Though a male Bird Animalian would then have that as a means to hold and conceal the the testes internally. That likely applied for Dinotopians as well. A male Dinotopian&#39;s equipment would be held internally in some way that would mirror a female&#39;s. Dakota would now be a bit different in having both male and female features. As Harper looked down, that was fairly obvious as he could see Hir penis also growing erect.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re both ready,&quot; Dakota smiled and nuzzled hir muzzle to Harper&#39;s cheek, &quot;Let us start something new together...&quot;<br />
<br />
Harper dutifully followed as Dakota climbed back onto the bed and then helped Harper onto it and leaned back. As shi delicately maneuvered her feathers so that Harper could get a clearer look at hir vaginal opening, glistening with some moisture and with hir penis sitting erect above it. Harper moved slowly and hesitantly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ll be all that pleasing,&quot; Harper said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;That will change as you do,&quot; Dakota answered him and leaned forward enough to hold him by the shoulders and guide him to hir and she gave a slight chirping moan as shi felt his penis enter hir. It wasn&#39;t that big, but shi could feel hir female opening grip him reasonably well and what was there felt good. Shi then licked his nose while trying to entice him to begin, and to a degree it worked. Harper did begin to thrust into hir and gently caressed and stroked at hir cheek and it was something that shi liked and noticed. It actually gave hir some feelings of happiness given how close they&#39;d been before hir uplifting. He even leaned down wrapped his lips over one nipple for a moment and that sent shivers of pleasure through hir, along with feeling the movement of milk out of hir and into him.<br />
<br />
When Harper lifted his head, Dakota could already see some of the first sign of changes. Shi could see a more youthful and muscular look about him, but this was mostly in relating to the thin wrinkles and age-lines pulling away as his skin grew tighter on his face. His hair for a moment seemed to regain its red coloration, but it was soon falling out, which seemed to be the case for all Humans that became Dinotopians. As they continued, Dakota could also feel Harper&#39;s penis growing larger and longer within hir, letting hir moans grow louder and longer as the sex started to feel very good and actually held hir own penis rather erect and pressed against him as he thrust into hir. The closeness also began to give Dakota some other alerts on Harper&#39;s changing form.<br />
<br />
Dakota looked up and down to see not only was Harper&#39;s human hair falling out, but his feathers were starting to grow in. They brushed hair away and grew in fairly thick. On his neck and belly were a creamish-white with some dark brown speckles on the sides of his neck. Growing in around his eyes and running back toward his neck w band of dark brown feathers that sort of formed like a domino mask. Between his eyes and going to where his hairline had been there were more creamish-white feathers. Above that were tannish-brown feathers. The band that went down the side of his neck that were dark brown went down to shoulders and seamed to circle there. The areas around his shoulders and upper back was more of a grayish-brown before turning to a tannish-brown at his lower back and toward his legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re looking different from me,&quot; Dakota commented between moans as Harper was actually beginning to pick up pace with a larger penis.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am?&quot; Harper managed slowly and noting that his voice was growing a bit higher as he continued to thrust into Dakota.<br />
<br />
He looked down to his hands and noted that his pinkie fingers were starting to dwindle down as long &quot;flight feathers&quot; were growing in. They resembled the flight feathers on Dakota&#39;s arms, though given the size that Dakotaraptor was, the articles head read on the animal indicated that the &quot;wings&quot; on Dakotaraptor were more to improve aerodynamics while running and balancing while on struggling prey and not flight. The bigger thing was that they were largely a dark grayish-brown with end of the &quot;wing&quot; feathers being dark tannish-brown feathers. As he felt some pressure begin to build in his face, at the base of his spine, and behind his penis it indicated that while Dakota retained hir exact coloration as an uplifted Osprey, it seemed as though he was gaining a different coloration.<br />
<br />
&quot;Int..errrrrrrrrreeeeeeeeeeekkkkkkk!&quot; Harper than gave out a screech as his his face began to push forward into a long and relatively pointed muzzle. The region around his nose and lower jaw had no feathers and only had a creamish-gray coloring of scales, which mirrored the area where bird&#39;s beaks began to evolve back in the Mesozoic era.<br />
<br />
Dakota watched as Harper&#39;s muzzle pushed forward and with his teeth growing shaper and pointed in the process, and a part of hir viewed this with delight. That Harper was joining hir and that they would become a mated pair, particularly as his now large penis was sending thrills of pleasure through hir and the rubbing of their feathers against hir penis had actually gotten hir to cum as sell. Though Dakota didn&#39;t mind, particularly as Harper&#39;s tail also began to grow out behind him, largely with a tannish-brown coloration. The long tail fathers grew out from the tip and they were tipped by bands of dark brown and white at the ends of them. A few small cracking sounds presented other alerts to Dakota and shi managed to look further down to see that Harper&#39;s feet had lengthened into the long digitigrade feet that shi now had with one toe having shrunk down to become an almost insignificant dew claw while the next toe was much larger and held the long &quot;killing claw&quot; that Dromaeosaurs were known for.<br />
<br />
&quot;Interesting,&quot; Harper then said slowly, though his voice being higher. At the same time, he&#39;d also had the sense where his testicles were being pulled inside him, though at the same time the opening behind his penis was also starting to grow wet as he continued to thrust into Dakota, giving the sense that he was now going into the final part of the transformation and becoming shi.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s more than interesting,&quot; Dakota moaned heavily as shi watched Harper&#39;s shoulders narrow slightly and then seeing two puffy forms begin to grow on his chest, &quot;It&#39;s sexy... as you become a shi...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I&#39;m already there,&quot; Harper moaned back as hir breasts began to grow in and bounced as they grew larger. Hir nipples were erect and she was starting to leak a bit of milk as well.<br />
<br />
Dakota managed to nod, though things were beginning to reach a climax. Harper&#39;s breasts had grown to match hir own and shi could feel Harper&#39;s penis begin to twitch a little. That climax soon followed as both Dakotaraptor Dinotopians gave a pleasure filled moan as they came together.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for loving me,&quot; Harper said to Dakota and nuzzled hir muzzle to Dakota&#39;s.<br />
<br />
Dakota nuzzled her mate back.</p>
