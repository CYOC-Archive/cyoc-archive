<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I had stripped down to bra and panties in the bathroom in order to observe my change. That didn’t happen, so now I was standing in the lounge staring at my twin having just fare-welled my best mate who was in my body and was off to pick up my girlfriend to take her to dinner at her parents. Confused? I was too.<br />
Sara was wearing the silk dressing gown that had helped her regain her true form.<br />
She looked at me. I looked at her. I could feel tears trickling down my cheeks. “Cheer up Sis” she said as she gave me a hug. “We will get this fixed” I found myself sobbing into to her shoulder as she comforted me. Was I doomed to be stuck in this body for the rest of my life?<br />
Several minutes, I was still sobbing, Sarah whispered in my ear “How about I run you a bubble bath” I remembered how that had calmed me earlier in the week, so between my blubbers I was able to nod in agreement. She picked up Rod’s discarded coat and placed it over my shoulders and gently ushered me to the couch. While I sat there trying to staunch my tears, I heard the bath running. <br />
Eventually the water stopped and Sarah ushered me into the bathroom. The steaming bath was filled to the brim with bubbles. “You get in and I’ll fix dinner” She closed the door behind her.<br />
I stripped off to step in and felt further despair when I noticed a blood stain on my panties. I sank into the bath and submerged myself. Slowly I felt myself calming down. This body certainly found baths soothing.<br />
I lay there and contemplated my situation. I appeared that I had reverted to the Tuesday night version of Sarah. That was then I almost made love to Rod. My bra was lost as he stripped it off me in our passion. Why didn’t I spot the bra earlier?  If only I had cleaned up the lounge this afternoon. If only I had caught the shirt when Sarah threw it to me. If only I hadn’t experimented with Amanda’s undies last Saturday. If only I had never set eyes on that damn Medallion of Zulo!<br />
I was calmer now and since my hair was already wet, reached for some shampoo and gave it a wash. I was rinsing off the suds when there was a knock on the door. Sarah opened the door “I’ve got you a change of clothes. Dinner will be ready in 10 minutes” She put the clothes on the bench and shut the door.<br />
I finished rinsing and stepped out of the bath and dried myself. Sarah had bought in some fresh undies, a lavender nightie and a terry towelling dressing gown. I put the clothes on, adding a pad and dried my hair.<br />
The table in the kitchen was set and Sarah produced two omelettes with a side serve of vegetables.<br />
I sat down. Sarah had changed and was wearing a loose grey sundress. She sat down opposite me “How are you feeling”<br />
“Better” I replied. “How are you, No doubt you were looking forward to being reunited with Rod. I’ve ruined your plans as well”<br />
“I’ll cope. It’s nice to be female again. I can’t deny that I was hoping for sex as a woman tonight. However we can have a girl’s night in. You can tell me about your week”<br />
“They will be off to Sydney early in the morning. I was hoping that would be me. I was looking forward to sex as a man” I ate some omelette. It was delicious “Very tasty”<br />
<br />
“I’ve put the medallion away. We can try to change you into Rod in the morning. How are your IT skills” Sarah asked. If I became Rod I would have to go to Rod’s work as an IT specialist for the city council. <br />
“I’ve bluffed my way pretending to be you for a week. Being Rod would be relatively easy. However… I’m bleeding again. I think I reverted back to Tuesday night. I may not be able to change until Saturday some time….. and then only if the Medallion works as we think it does” <br />
“We will see if you can change in the morning. If not I might have to be Rod for a day”. <br />
“There is one other thing I’ve been meaning to tell you. On Thursday the boys at work were taking photo’s of the new cars that had just arrived. Me and Karen…..” I explained about the posters.<br />
Sarah laughed “Sunday at the motor show will be interesting”<br />
We shared the remaining chocolates for desert then I helped her clean up the kitchen. <br />
When we had finished Sarah asked If I could show her where I had stowed the gear I had bought from her old room. I had bought a car load of Sarah’s gear with me on Tuesday morning. I had packed the clothing into the wardrobe in the guest bedroom but two boxes containing jewellery and assorted junk were left untouched in the bottom of the wardrobe. “I just want to see what is there” I showed her the boxes.<br />
While she investigated their contents I sat down and turned on the TV. I flicked to a footy game but found I wasn’t interested. I was feeling tired and returned to the bedroom to see how Sarah was going. The contents of the boxes was spread over the bed. Sarah looked up at me with a guilty look on her face. She had been examining what looked to be black dildo.<br />
I couldn’t help myself “Found what you were looking for?” <br />
“I just…need it…” she said quietly. She put the object back in the box and started gathering up the items on the bed. “You can have this room” she said “I’ll move into Rod’s”<br />
I went to the bathroom to clean my teeth and to allow Sarah to take what she wanted into Rod’s room. I thought about what I had just seen. A picture of Sarah thrusting the dildo into herself came into my mind. I was turned on by the image. Still a bit of the old Zach in here I thought. I put the toothbrush down.  I felt myself getting wet down below and could feel my nipples becoming erect. My hand wandered inside the gown under the nightie and into my panties. I touched my clitoris. I imagined putting the dildo in there, how would it feel, would it feel as good as Rod’s penis? I wanted to try it.<br />
I calmed myself. Think of something else. Time to put Biddy out. He had been following me around since the bath. I found a treat and enticed him out the back door and said good night to him. Sarah had taken what she wanted and was in Rod’s room. I called out good night to her, turned off the lights and went back to the guest bedroom. It was tidy again, I climbed into bed.<br />
I lay there in the dark and could not fall asleep. The image of the dildo moving in and out of Sarah’s body, my body, came back to me. If my theories were correct I would be a female for I estimated another 36 hours. Could I ask Sarah if I could try the dildo? I might never have this chance again. What was the etiquette among females? I found I was fingering my clitoris again, however I couldn’t take myself to orgasm. My vagina had an enormous need to be filled. <br />
I tried to calm myself down, tried to remind myself that I was Zach. I had no need of dildo’s. Go to sleep.<br />
I couldn’t sleep. I had to see if it was still in the box. I turned on the bedside light and pulled the box out of the cupboard. I quietly unpacked the box, placing the items on the bed. It was there inside a pink material bag. I pulled it out. It was about 10 inches long and nearly 2 inches thick. It was made of soft but firm rubber. It had a distinct head and the sides felt just a little bit rough. I squeezed it with my hands as if milking it.<br />
“Zach, are you still awake” It was Sarah outside my door. The door opened and Sarah caught me in the same pose that I had caught her in an hour or so earlier.<br />
She immediately saw what I was doing and said “Found what you were looking for?” <br />
I’m sure I wore the same guilty look she had shown me earlier, after all, I was her twin. I could feel myself blushing as I said “Sorry Sarah, I couldn’t get it out my mind. I had to feel it”<br />
She looked at me “I couldn’t get it out my mind either. When I saw the light under your door I thought you might have been reading. I have been waiting outside the door for 5 minutes trying to summon up the courage to enter and ask if I could retrieve him.... By the way I call him Norman”<br />
“Hello Norman” I said, and gave the dildo a kiss, then giggled, the tension broken by Sarah’s confession.<br />
I put Norman back in his bag and handed it to Sarah. <br />
Sarah took the bag and turned to leave but then paused by door. She turned back to me and said “I’ve never done anything like this before…. but ........would you like to come with me and have a play date with Norman?”<br />
“Yes” I replied<br />
………<br />
I followed her to Rod’s room in the dark. She turned on the light but then dimmed it so we could just see. I was wearing a lavender nightie of Sarah’s. She wore a silk black pyjama set. “He needs a rinse” she said and went to the en suite. I could hear the tap running for 20 seconds.<br />
She returned and sat down on the bed. I sat down beside her. She handed me Norman and whispered “He likes to be fondled” I took him in my hands and gave him a squeeze. He was warm to touch. She positioned herself on the bed behind me and gently started massaging my shoulders. Her hands wandered downwards until they found a spot that made me twitch, somewhere between my shoulder blades. I found I had goose-bumps all over my body “I see I have found my magic spot”<br />
She pulled me down so I was now lying with my back on the bed but my feet on the floor. The back of my head was resting in her lap. She took Norman from me. “He likes to rub your body” and proceeded to rub the dildo gently across my stomach, up to my breasts. Using the head like a large finger she circled each breast in turn. My nipples expanded as she did so. Her left hand came and gave my left nipple a twitch. “I think we need to get into bed”<br />
She put Norman on a bedside table and turned the light off. There was enough moonlight coming through the curtains to make out her shape beside me. We both crawled under the doona. I tentatively felt for her hand. Our fingers interlocked and she bought my hand to her mouth giving it a kiss. I pulled her hand back and placed it on my breast, I then found her breast and we gave each other a caress. She pulled me closer and began to kiss me. Her hand fondled my side wandering down onto my hip. I mirrored her action feeling her body under her silky pyjamas. My hand came to rest on her hip. The kiss lingered, I could feel our breasts touching, my nipples enjoying the sensation of rubbing against hers. <br />
Her hand moved gently from my hip to my crotch. She rubbed the bottom of my tummy, with each rub her hand went lower. Meanwhile I found the waist of her pyjama pants and pushed them down over her hips. We paused the embrace long enough for her to remove her pants. I took the opportunity to remove my panties. <br />
Next she pulled the nightie over my head and I removed her top. She climbed on top of me, her breasts dangling against mine and kissed me again. My crotch was begging to be filled but we had no penis between us. I could feel her pubic hairs rubbing against my leg but nothing else. <br />
She broke of the kiss and sat erect on top of me, her hands felt for my breasts and I felt hers. While she massaged my breasts, I let my hands wander down and found her pubic hairs, she arched her back so that my fingers found her clitoris. She was as wet as I was. I stimulated her and soon could feel her vagina pulsating in orgasm. She pulled off me and whispered “Your turn” <br />
I lay there as her hands wandered slowly down from my breasts to my groin. Her fingers found my clitoris and she gave me a gentle massage. My excitement was building, I was almost there. Suddenly she stopped. I thought she must be reaching for Norman as she moved further down the bed. I eagerly awaited the feeling of Norman piercing me. <br />
Her hands returned to my vagina, I lay there in anticipation, for the feeling of penetration. But it wasn’t Norman that touched me, it was Sarah’s tongue. I felt her tongue encircle my clitoris and dip down to scoop out the juices from my vagina. I exploded in ecstasy. I held her face where it was until I could bear no more.<br />
I regained my composure and realized I wanted more. Women were capable of multiple orgasms and I was willing to see how many I could give and hopefully receive. I reached to the lamp and felt for Norman. I took him to the bed and felt for Sarah. I rubbed Norman’s head against her stomach and breast then worked my way back to her groin. As I let Norman rub against her crotch her hands grabbed him and pushed his head gently against her vagina. I pushed her hands away but held Norman in place. I used my fingers to find her clitoris while gently pushing Norman into her, a half inch in, then out again. I could feel that she was getting easier to penetrate. I pushed him in a little further, an inch, then two inches partially removing him each time. I kept going, now Norman was easily sliding half his length into her with each thrust. Sarah cried “Enough” as I pushed him in 6 inches “Leave him there” she uttered, breathing heavily. I took my hands away. I was excited as well, so bent down and kissed her pubes. My tongue reached out and found the top of her clitoris where it was rubbing against Norman. It felt both rubber and flesh. I savored the taste of Sarah’s juices. Sarah reached over my head and began again to thrust Norman in and out. Before long she was involuntarily moaning. She pulled Norman out, but held my head in place. I repositioned to a less awkward position and let my tongue caress her clitoris until I could feel the vibrations had stopped.<br />
5 minutes later she whispered “It’s your turn to play with Norman” I lay back and abandoned myself to her. I felt her fingers on my groin, on my clitoris, then in my vagina. I felt Normans head entering me. I asked her to push him in all the way but she refused “Slowly” she replied. Very slowly, too slowly, she pushed him into me. My vaginal muscles tried to hold him in, but she slowly pulled him out again. My body was eagerly anticipating each inward thrust and fighting the pulling out. I said “More” as I was penetrated further than ever and was sent over the edge. She continued the slow in and out movement as my body bucked.<br />
Without saying anything we agreed that it was time to go to sleep. She enveloped me in her arms and I fell asleep.</p>
