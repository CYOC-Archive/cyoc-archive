<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Gloria and her friends now found themselves with a rare off day. As thebgirls now lounged around Felicia&#39;s pool, they talked of what had happened at the Magic Shop.<br />
<br />
&quot;A demon hunter,&quot; Felicia stated, raising an eyebrow. &quot;You&#39;re joking.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wish I was,&quot; Gloria stated. &quot;But I saw it with my own eyes. Guy just burst into the Magic Shop brandishing a gun. He said everything that happened last year drew alot of attention.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thought we made it so no one would notice,&quot; Diane asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thought so too but thats not completely true,&quot; Gloria sighed. &quot;Humans may not remember but the supernatural do. According to Caleb the vampires are probably close by.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what do you need us to do,&quot; Sasha asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Gloria stated. &quot;Has anyone noticed anything weird? And I mean anything. Someone looking weird, an odd situation, anything!&quot;<br />
<br />
The girls all shook their heads no, nothing of note had happened. Naomi now paused, something odd had happened. &quot;Okay this is probably nothing,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay I didnt think anything of it at the time,&quot; Naomi said. &quot;But Akira and the others paid us a visit when we had that cookout a few days ago. They disappeared for a little bit but the next time I saw him he seemed real angry and Rexie had a black eye.&quot;<br />
<br />
A few days prior......<br />
<br />
Caleb rubbed his eyes as he now studied the Tozawa family. Kitsune? Demons? Witches and wizards? Caleb was beginning to think maybe the family had bitten off more than they could chew. As he found himself deep in thought, he failed to notice a small green light sailing towards him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Was wondering where the hell you went to?&quot;<br />
<br />
Caleb glanced over to see Spark giving him a critical look. The tiny green fairy now floated next to him, her hands on her hips. &quot;Hey Spark what&#39;s going on?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we&#39;ve been busy,&quot; Spark stated. &quot;Your pops found the head wizard. Turns out their probably the good guys around here. Chances are your old man is going to be working with them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Caleb simply nodded as he turned back towards the Tozawa house. &quot;Guess a couple extra hands couldn&#39;t hurt,&quot; he whispered. &quot;But does dad know about that.&quot; Spark now squinted towards where Caleb was gesturing the fairies jaw dropping in shock. &quot;Wait they hangout with demons and kitsunes!&quot; Caleb nodded, causing the fairy to shudder.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it,&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well demons are no bueno,&quot; she muttered. &quot;And it seems like the imp is a familiar which makes me wonder. Also a freaking kitsune! Not only are they rare but they&#39;re also legendary fighters. Like a samauri, ninja, and barbarian all rolled up into one. They also happen to be very protective. If a kitsune is watching the wizards than we don&#39;t want to mess with them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Caleb agreed, he had done enough reconnaissance for one day. As he was about to leave, he was shocked to see the kitsune vanish from sight. Alarmed he quickly scanned the area.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing here?&quot;<br />
<br />
Calebs blood ran cold, the voice was directly behind him. He had a feeling he knew what that was. Fortunately for the young hunter, he was prepared for situations such as this. Releasing a flashbang, Caleb now backflipped from his perch, pulling his mask up as he now brandished a bowie knife from his hip. As he studied the three individuals in front of him he began to size them up.<br />
<br />
Akira was momentarily dazed, the kitsune had sensed something was amiss and requested Ayami and Rexies assistance. As guardian of the next generation of wizards he would confront any and all threats posed to Mia, Zack, or any of the other children. As he now furrowed his brow he beheld a teenage boy dressed in a cowboy hat, duster, and mask. &quot;A hunter,&quot; he thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey cowboy,&quot; Ayami exclaimed. &quot;Dont know what you think your doing but the family is off limits.&quot; Caleb said nothing, his eyes narrowing as he gazed at the succubus and imp.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing to say huh,&quot; Rexie grinned. &quot;Fine by me. Just don&#39;t scream too loud when I tear your throat out.&quot; The imp now bared her needle like teeth, lunging at Caleb with murderous intent.<br />
<br />
Caleb simply smirked under his mask, why were demons always so straight forward with their attacks. Dodging out of the way, the teenage hunter now grabbed hold of Rexies wing, slamming her to the ground.<br />
<br />
Akira and Ayami growled, the kitsune drawing his sword as the succubus lept at Caleb. Unfortunately for the succubus she wasn&#39;t paying attention as Sparks grabbed a fallen branch, swinging it like a baseball bat. Ayami was dumbfounded, wondering how the boy in front of her had levitated a branch, not realizing it was in fact a fairy who had knocked her to the ground.<br />
<br />
Akira though saw the tiny nude speck, now angered that the fairy had struck his girlfriend. As he swung his blade, Caleb was their to block, the two warriors locking blades.<br />
<br />
Rexie groaned dusting herself off as she glanced back at Akira. The five tails seemed annoyed to be dueling some teenager. &quot;Hang on big guy I&#39;m coming,&quot; she exclaimed. Rexie though was not paying attention as Spark rocketed towards Rexie, punching the imp straight in the face.<br />
<br />
Caleb had watched what happened, sighing as he saw Spark celebrate her momentary victory. &quot;Damn it Spark do you really have to do the Ali shuffle,&quot; he thought. Looking at Akira, he could see the annoyance on the kitsunes vulpine features.<br />
<br />
The kitsune wasn&#39;t prepared for this fight, he had been thrown into it by his companions. Caleb was thankful for this as he strained against his strength. <br />
<br />
&quot;Got you covered kid,&quot; Spark exclaimed. Soaring towards the teen the fairy now floated in front of Akiras face. The kitsune giving the tiny nude a look of confusion as she proceeded to punch him right in the nose.<br />
<br />
Akiras eyes watered as he cursed, Caleb taking advantage of the situation, sweeping his legs and knocking the kitsune to the ground. <br />
<br />
&quot;Cover our tracks,&quot; Caleb exclaimed. Spark nodded, the tiny green fairy releasing a blinding green light that dazed the kitsune, succubus, and imp. As Akiras vision cleared he could see their attackers had vanished.<br />
<br />
Ayami rubbed her head, still confused by what had happened. As she watched her kitsune lover stand, she could see his face contort in rage as he smashed his hand into a nearby tree, splintering it in the process. &quot;We say nothing of what happened understand,&quot; he roared. Ayami nodded quietly, realizing her boyfriend was clearly embarrassed by this altercation.<br />
<br />
*****************************<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know what happened but Akira was super pissed,&quot; Naomi said as she gazed at her friends. &quot;When I tried to ask what happened, Ayami just told me to leave him alone. Maybe, he had a run in with vampires or this demon hunter.&quot;<br />
<br />
The others simply nodded as they continued to talk, they would have to keep their eyes open if they were dealing with another supernatural menace.</p>
