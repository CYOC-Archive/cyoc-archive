<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You consider me a friend?&quot; Officer Barnes coughed out after a few moments.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; I nodded, &quot;You've given me a chance when Beauregard had everyone up at arms against Molly and I.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bah...&quot; Officer Barnes shot back, &quot;that's mostly because I believe in waiting to see what one actually does before making any judgment. And so far, what you've done has been a good partner.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wouldn't that have made you &quot;friends&quot;?&quot; Molly asked him.<br />
<br />
He coughed a little.<br />
<br />
&quot;I had thought I had been a bit more business-like then friend-like,&quot; Officer Barnes answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;In many ways you have,&quot; I nodded, &quot;but that is I wanted after I was transformed... it has been all Molly has wanted for close to a year now. The chance to prove ones self without being treated as a man-eater, a circus animal, or some yahoo's escaped exotic pet.&quot;<br />
<br />
I could have sworn I saw a tear go down Officer Barnes' face.<br />
<br />
&quot;An part of me has felt fairly guilty about not being able hear or smell Beauregard on the other side of that door,&quot; I added.<br />
<br />
&quot;What good would that have done?&quot; Officer Barnes commented, &quot;Even so, if we turned around, he could have charged in behind us and killed us both... besides... houses aren't something that allow scents in anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your room here smells of you,&quot; Molly commented, &quot;and a dog has been in hear at least once. Everything leaves a scent behind. Inside a house it may be harder then outside because he scents are more concentrated as people tend to go in and out of their rooms fairly regularly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You sure you're a tiger? Not a bloodhound?&quot; Officer Barnes coughed off a chuckle, &quot;oh... man... the staples are uncomfortable, no matter what position I'm in...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Staples?&quot; Molly shuddered, &quot;not stitches?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Doctor told Joey that stitches lead to greater infection or something like that,&quot; Officer Barnes sighed, &quot;and they don't go in that deep... they're just uncomfortable.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When do they come out?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I got at least a month before that happens,&quot; Officer Barnes replied, &quot;I got to wait for all the surgical scars to heal together a bit... they seem to have policies about open wounds.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's probably a good policy,&quot; I told him.<br />
<br />
&quot;That doesn't make this any more comfortable then it already isn't,&quot; Officer Barnes grumbled.<br />
<br />
I lowered on paw-like hand to Officer Barnes' hand and patted it gently.<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll get better in time,&quot; I told him, &quot;time heals all wounds, as they say.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, yeah.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And it is good to see that you are doing as well as you are,&quot; I told him, &quot;I thought you were a goner the whole time I saw you on the ground... and waited for you to come out of surgery.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, George,&quot; Officer Barnes replied.<br />
<br />
Molly then slid up close to him. She nuzzled the top of his forehead with her nose and then licked the same spot. It earned a couple of &quot;yucks&quot; but while our lips were flexible enough to talk, the curvature of our muzzles made it impossible for us to pucker. Molly couldn't kiss him on the forehead the way a lot of nurses did in the movies.<br />
<br />
&quot;And thank you for giving my husband a chance, Mr. Barnes,&quot; Molly told him, &quot;we'd probably be alone in the wilderness with no money if not for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw... shucks, THAT was more Officer Howard's work then mine,&quot; Officer Barnes replied, &quot;but thank you just the same. When we had first met... after his transformation anyway, it was simply giving him a chance to prove himself... Now... I'm glad he considers me a friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Two days later, a different pair of Federal Agents collected Beauregard from his cell to transport to Helena, where he would be held at the local FBI office there. He went quietly with them, but I could practically feel the glares he shot me as it was done. Once these two agents were through securing Beauregard in their vehicle, I expected them to drive off, as Agents Harris and Blustunn had done with the three gang members.<br />
<br />
This time, however, was different. One Agent did climb behind the wheel, but the other turned to me directly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would like a word with you and your chief regarding the trial, Officer Wayne,&quot; the agent, Agent Schnozz, told me.<br />
<br />
I nodded immediately, somewhat surprised by the comment, but it wasn't like I wanted to block him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, follow me,&quot; I answered, &quot;your partner...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Agent Hatcher will be fine,&quot; Agent Schnozz said firmly.<br />
<br />
I only shrugged and lead the agent back inside the station and then into Officer Howard's office. He was busy with some paperwork when we came in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, sir,&quot; I said carefully, not wanting to startle him, &quot;Agent Schnozz has said he wants a word with the both of us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Officer Howard gave a soft chuckle that I was sure only I could hear and then nodded, looking up from his paperwork.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go ahead,&quot; Officer Howard offered the floor to the FBI agent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, Chief Officer Howard,&quot; Agent Schnozz answered, &quot;as I'm sure you both know the evidence your local department has collected has drawn a connection between this rancher, Beauregard and the attack on Leona Washburn's lab in Peoria, Illinois.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, why you are taking over the responsibility of trying Beauregard,&quot; Officer Howard nodded, &quot;since his planning lead to crime that involved the crossing of state lines. Beauregard is being tried here because he, himself, did not leave Montana, and &quot;worst&quot; of his crimes isn't necessarily a Federal Issue... unless you've promoted two of my officers... secretly.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both Agent Schnozz and Officer Howard chuckled at the response.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, you are correct on that,&quot; Agent Schnozz nodded, &quot;a most perplexing case your men have solved. We normally don't expect local officers to break such a complex case open down at the bureau.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You'd be amazed what local officers can do when they pay attention,&quot; Officer Howard shot back, not taking the insult that the Columbia Falls PD &quot;should&quot; have called the FBI in beforehand very well.<br />
<br />
Agent Schnozz only shrugged, &quot;However, since none of our personnel were involved in instigating the evidence you collected... or in the apprehension of Beauregard and the gang members themselves, we will need you and Officer Wayne to stay in Helena for the duration of Beauregard's trial. It will be your testimony that the Federal Judge will want to hear.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Helena...?&quot; I gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Agent Schnozz nodded, &quot;the two of you are to be well cared for. We have a hotel room reserved for you. There is no foot-board, so Officer Wayne here should fit, and the expenses have been taken care of.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The expenses have been taken care of...&quot; Officer Howard asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Our office got a call from the Illinois office, apparently they owed the Peoria Police chief a favor, and he's called it in,&quot; Agent Schnozz shrugged, &quot;it's certainly an odd favor, but whatever works... It's actually cheaper then any sort of &quot;evidence sharing&quot; that could have been done in Illinois.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But we can't leave our work here...&quot; Officer Howard protested, &quot;Officer Barnes is still out on mandatory injury leave and will be out for awhile... Officer Wayne is having to do his patrols on foot. I don't think I have the officers available for this... neither do I have the budget to hire temps.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We've ALL felt budget crunches lately,&quot; Agent Schnozz sighed, &quot;even at the Bureau... but we need your testimony at the trial. Officer Wayne as he made the arrest, and can testify to what Beauregard did to his partner. And you, Officer Howard, because you finished the arrest and transfered the paper evidence to us. I am sorry if this puts your Department in a pinch, but we NEED your testimony.&quot;<br />
<br />
Officer Howard then sighed, &quot;How long do we have?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The trial starts tomorrow at ten AM,&quot; Agent Schnozz answered, &quot;I'd suggest you head down to Helena today though. Go to the Super 8 on the west side of the city and ask for Room 34.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Officer Howard sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, Officers,&quot; Agent Schnozz then left.<br />
<br />
Once he was gone, Officer Howard turned to me.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose I'll have to release you from duty for today,&quot; Officer Howard answered, &quot;you'd best go get some spare clothes, uniforms, and any pieces of meat you don't want to buy at a snack food vendor.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, sir,&quot; I said slowly.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
What followed was some rushed hurrying. I hurried home as quickly as I could to put something together to travel in, as well as a few pieces of meat to snack on. Once that was done, I left a note for Molly on the front door of Bandhavgarh Cabin so that she would know where I had disappeared to. As I finished that I headed out to find Officer Howard waiting in his squad-car. I slowly approached and got into the back seat.<br />
<br />
&quot;You didn't need to come all this way, sir,&quot; I spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;This will save you time running back to the station,&quot; Officer Howard shrugged, &quot;You have everything?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty much,&quot; I sighed, &quot;and left a note for Molly as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very good,&quot; Officer Howard nodded, &quot;then it is time to go.&quot;<br />
<br />
He then began the drive to Helena. Although the dirt roads we started on were bumpy, once we made it onto the major roads, the ride was much smoother. Not having really anything to say at the moment, I fell asleep as we went.<br />
<br />
It was relatively late when I awoke again to find that Officer Howard was pulling into the hotel that Agent Schnozz had told us to use.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here we go,&quot; Officer Howard sighed as he finally parked the car.<br />
<br />
He then let me out. I made my way behind him. A lot of this all seemed odd to me, but it would all contribute to victory over R.A.M. and Beauregard's hatred. A victory that would give Molly and I hope for a happy future and a happy family. Hopefully, it was a road that could be traveled.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The next day at ten o'clock we waited for the trial to begin. Beauregard was brought in with what looked like his own private attorney, and it probably was. He sat quietly even with the Federal Agents watching him along with the courtroom's guards. Officer Howard and I waited patiently in our seats, though I was actually doing quite a bit to make sure that my weight didn't crush the chairs. Eventually, the judge made his way into the Federal Courtroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Honorable Bastion Walker will now preside in the criminal trial of the United States versus Pierre Beauregard,&quot; the bailiff announced, &quot;all rise.&quot;<br />
<br />
We all stood up as the judge entered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Be seated,&quot; Judge Walker spoke, &quot;the charges may be read.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pierre Beauregard is charged with criminal conspiracy to murder two citizens of the state of Montana,&quot; the bailiff read the charges, &quot;conspiracy to murder and destroy the lab of Leona Washburn, hiring of illegal mercenaries to accomplish the conspired goal, assault on two officers of the law, assault with a deadly weapon, attempted murder of one officer of the law, and embezzling organized funds.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pierre Beauregard, how do you plead?&quot; Judge Walker asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not guilty!&quot; he answered firmly before his attorney could even speak.<br />
<br />
And Beauregard's trial was under way.</p>
