<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Guy gawked at his growing body.<br />
<br />
He couldn’t believe how massive he had become, and he was still growing!  Wondering what was taking his friend so long, he decided to try and sit down on the couch and wait.  He hobbled towards the sofa, stepping cautiously since he could no longer really see where he was going, his chest bulging out unbelievably far.  With each step of his unsteady feet, the floor creaked under his weight.  He managed a glance in the mural-mirror, surprised to see that as extreme as their size was, they weren’t sagging downward as they were being supported by his growing muscle-belly.  His obliques were incredibly thick, giving the appearance of giant love-handles; only these were solid muscle.  Like his abs, they bowed out to the sides, obscuring his waist.  He couldn’t bend at his waist or turn anymore, even if he wanted to.  His core muscles and lats were simply too big now.  His bubble-butt was immense, resting uneasily atop his swelling hamstrings.  Lumbering to the sofa, his boxers finally succumbed against the onslaught of his growing body; the waistband snapped and his boxers tore apart, falling to the floor.  Guy managed to turn around, and tried to ease himself onto the sofa.<br />
<br />
Losing his balance, Guy flailed reflexively, only to discover that he could no longer bend his arms at all!  His triceps jostling with his lats for space only threw his balance off more.  His thighs and hamstrings pressed against each other even more, and Guy was unable to accommodate their developing size, knocking him off balance further.<br />
<br />
He crashed onto the sofa.<br />
<br />
The thud was loud, and he heard the couch’s frame crack under his mammoth weight.  Even then, it started creaking and groaning as he continued growing.<br />
<br />
Guy realized that sitting down wasn’t such a smart move as he felt his muscle-gut pressing on top his swelling thighs; which in turn was pressing against his swelling muscle-gut, which was also pressing against the underside of his mammoth chest, lifting them higher and obscuring his vision even more.<br />
<br />
The jostling between his chest, abs, and thighs only worried guy more; pressing against each other, they were forcing him to lean back against the couch.  Making it more uncomfortable was his growing lats pressing into the back of the couch and pushing him forward!  His back alone had to be several feet thick!  Guy’s widening lats were growing further out to the sides, lifting his swelling arms parallel to the sofa.  From what he could see over his swelling chest, he was being lifted in his seat by his swelling glutes and hamstrings.<br />
<br />
Looking again towards the wall-clock was difficult, he could barely move his head as his traps were swelling up and past his ears as his neck thickened; Guy was greeted by his massive shoulder crowding around the side of his face.  Straining to look over them, he managed to see that a nearly a quarter of an hour had passed since he called Ryan.<br />
<br />
What the hell was taking him so long?  He should’ve have been here by now!<br />
<br />
Guy decided to give Ryan another call.<br />
<br />
He tried to stand up, but couldn’t.<br />
<br />
His thighs were pressing against each other, forcing his legs out to an awkward angle.  His calves were pushing into the backs of his knees, preventing them from bending his legs at all.  He couldn’t get the momentum to stand, hindered as he was by his swelling muscle-gut and thighs pressing against each other.  Guy was straining to look over his chest, but his pecs started crowding around his face like his swelling shoulders were.  He could barely look over them!  His traps were swelling even more, thrusting his head forward, causing it to be pinned against his growing chest.<br />
<br />
Guy screamed in frustration as he futilely struggled to stand again.<br />
<br />
There was a knock at the door, then it opened.<br />
<br />
“Guy?” a voice asked.  “Are you okay?”<br />
<br />
It was Ryan!<br />
<br />
“Come in,” Guy shouted, slightly mumbled as his chest began pressing against the underside of his chin.<br />
<br />
He heard the door close, and footsteps from the foyer to the living room.  The footsteps stopped abruptly.<br />
<br />
Ryan couldn’t believe the sight before him.<br />
<br />
His friend was huge!  Muscles were bulging everywhere, fighting for space on his friend’s body.  Each muscle was distended incredibly, looking like some over-inflated balloons under Guy's skin.  Only these were solid muscle, and their definition and vascularity was incredible, the striations and veins visible beneath his friend’s skin.  Ryan could see they were bulging and growing larger, twitching and jiggling like water balloons as Guy was struggling to move.  It would have been comedic, had it not been his friend.<br />
<br />
“Holy shit!”  Ryan exclaim.  “What the fuck happened?”<br />
<br />
“I was given an ointment for my muscle aches, and it made my muscles bigger—”<br />
<br />
“No shit,” Ryan stated incredulously, despite the evidence before him.<br />
<br />
“At first, it was only about fifty pounds,” Guy continued.  “Then, I started growing at the gym.  It hasn’t stopped yet.  I can’t stop growing!”<br />
<br />
“What the hell can I do?”  Ryan asked.  “Shit, man!  I can see you growing!”<br />
<br />
“Go to the Ointment Store!  Mr. Yuan can help me!  He’ll know what to do!”<br />
<br />
“Got it!”  Ryan said as he turned to leave.<br />
<br />
“Hurry!”  Guy shouted after him, his swelling chest forcing his head to an incline.</p>
