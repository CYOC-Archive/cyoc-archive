<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Heather ultimately found Jeremy in the spot where she expected him to be, the Horizon offices there in New Zerzura where he was discussing something with some of the scientists that were on duty. It sounded fairly friendly and comfortable, but then that was more within Jeremy&#39;s known comfort zones. The Egyptian colony wasn&#39;t necessarily a bad place, as the archeological sites that were being preserved was interesting, and Rex had enjoyed talking with Melbourne in ways that compared archeology to paleontology. Listening in, Heather had found a fair number of similarities in the care that had to be employed in both fields, but that wasn&#39;t the most fascinating thing for her.<br />
<br />
And outside of sites that were being preserved and protected as a historical tourist site there really wasn&#39;t that much more that would be more of a tourist type of site. The colony&#39;s market area had some small nick-knack type of things that could be sold, but many of these were things that were likely for those much smaller than a Dinotopian. Some of the foods were interesting and tasted good, but neither Heather nor Jeremy could spend all there time there. In this Jeremy came to a spot where he&#39;d be comfortable, in a more scientific center and looking into what Horizon was doing.<br />
<br />
&quot;I found you,&quot; Heather called to Jeremy as she approached and hugged him from behind.<br />
<br />
Jeremy looked over his shoulder and raised one eye-ridge to his wife. She looked beautiful to him, even if the tee-shirt and jeans she was presently wearing were a bit pedestrian by Animalian standards. But, it was something that was there for being in accordance with Egypt&#39;s laws and cultural expectations. And most Animalians generally did have basic attire that would suit that for various reasons. He knew that Abby and Samson had attire that would serve that purpose because the nature of farm work was something that could get them dirty or do damage to clothing, which made wearing things that were &quot;sexy&quot; not practical for the work they did. But not everyone had had that, though New Zerzura did provide some basic garments for those that didn&#39;t have more conservative &quot;tourist wear.&quot; <br />
<br />
Regardless, he still found Heather attractive. It was the odd sort of case where their reunion had lead to a lot of growth and change in them. He&#39;d never realized that Heather liked him romantically, and after that realization at a session with Doctor Jones, he&#39;d come to realize that he&#39;d actually liked her that way too. But he&#39;d been too easily distracted by other pursuits to notice it before. Now he wasn&#39;t going to let her go. He&#39;d still enjoy his work with scientific research, but he&#39;d want her to be there by his side and in a legal way.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, aside from our game of hide and seek,&quot; Heather said to him, &quot;What have you been up to?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mostly just seeing what Horizon&#39;s been up to here,&quot; Jeremy answered with a small shrug, &quot;Much of it is similar to what Horizon was doing in Maelewano. Some of the people that have come here as refugees are apparently from Syria and were looking to get away from the violence from ISIS and Assad... and with America and Russia openly backing a murderous dictator and with the Turks not being much better... they&#39;ve come here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Makes sense,&quot; Heather commented, &quot;even with all the violence and chaos in the region... Egypt has been relatively stable. I assume they were put through Project Phoenix?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If they were injured,&quot; Jeremy nodded, &quot;and other than that, they&#39;re mostly just working on basic medical work and will probably run a local hospital here, like they do in Maelewano.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So... no new projects?&quot; Heather asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing new,&quot; Jeremy nodded.<br />
<br />
Heather then gave a toothy grin and took Jeremy by had as he turned to look to her. He gave one small sniff and also caught wind of some scent of arousal on his wife.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then since I&#39;ve found you and won the game of hide and seek,&quot; Heather commented, &quot;why don&#39;t we go back to our hotel room and celebrate.&quot;<br />
<br />
She then pressed herself against him and nuzzled her muzzle to Jeremy&#39;s. Jeremy soon returned in and moved to whisper in her ear, &quot;Mrs. Green, are you trying to seduce me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it working?&quot; Heather smiled back and then kissed his cheek. Her smile grew a bit bigger when she caught an aroused scent coming from Jeremy as well. With that they made their way out, with Heather playfully leading Jeremy on. She didn&#39;t do anything truly outlandish, as she was certain that she&#39;d never hear the end of it from Tyra if she did, but she was certain to keep Jeremy close by and return to their hotel room.<br />
<br />
They arrived to find it clean and in order, though how long that would last could be up for debate. They were on their honeymoon and Heather was more than eager to have her moments of marital bliss with Jeremy. They&#39;d both gone through a lot and then found each other, and Heather wasn&#39;t going to give that up. And from her reading, while Egypt had some regulations that were restrictive in some areas, they didn&#39;t outright ban sex. They just wanted it kept in private, which Heather had no problem with. It was why she didn&#39;t work at the Meat Market in Lyre and stayed away from some of the other parties that went on that often played to high Animalian libidos. But in private and with the man she loved, Heather had no problem with it.<br />
<br />
Jeremy watched as Heather strode across the room and drew the curtains on the far side window, making sure they were closed and that only some soft lamps that were in the room provided light. Both could smell the growing scent of arousal on the other, and as Heather turned she could also see growing tent in Jeremy&#39;s pants. Like the reptile and bird Animalians, after he became a Syntixisaurus Rex all of Jeremy&#39;s equipment was more internal than a mammal Animalian, but that couldn&#39;t stop him from getting an erection.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... all this way for a little fun,&quot; Jeremy gave a low smile to Heather as he approached and placed his hands on her waist.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well of course,&quot; Heather answered, and began unbuttoning and pulling down on Jeremy&#39;s pants, &quot;I love you and it IS our honeymoon. I&#39;m sure many people will understand... that we love each other...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeremy stepped out of his pants as Heather had gotten them down to his ankles. Doing so had also pulled them and his tail down a bit, but once was out of his pants, a casual flick of his tail sent them flying off onto the floor. A cool breeze from the room&#39;s air-conditioning soon betrayed that when Heather had pulled down on his pants it had included more than just the pants he wore but his underwear as well. The result left his erection standing tall before him, making Heather smile and then move to pull down her own pants. Jeremy than carefully pulled off his shirt, and as he got it off, he got an eyeful as Heather undid her bra and let impressive bosom bounce free with her scaled nipples standing erect on her chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;And we&#39;ve come through a lot together,&quot; Jeremy said slowly as he approached her, &quot;and I think... I think it&#39;s made us better as people.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Much better,&quot; Heather moaned as Jeremy slowly massaged her breasts as they came toward each other, with his thumbs periodically flipping at her nipples.<br />
<br />
They&#39;d found that full foreplay wasn&#39;t exactly the easiest thing. While they did have lips, they didn&#39;t completely cover their teeth, which made kissing rather difficult, and that was before considering their muzzles. And while their lips could allow for some of the other forms of foreplay, it was something that both had to be careful of, as Heather didn&#39;t want her nipples pierced any more than Jeremy didn&#39;t want his equipment bitten off by accident. But in their private moments since his conversion, Jeremy and Heather had gotten a fair amount of practice and new what to do. It added to the wetness Heather felt between her legs, and she eagerly looked up to Jeremy as he laid Heather on the bit and with a small bit of Heather&#39;s milk dribbling down his chin.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m ready for you, big boy,&quot; Heather said to him playfully as she eyed the huge erect shaft between his legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;For now?&quot; Jeremy asked back slowly as he began to ease his erect penis into her, holding back a moan as her wet folds stretched around it and gripped him firmly.<br />
<br />
&quot;For now and forever!&quot; Heather declared as she thrust her hips forward, pushing Jeremy all the way in, and giving a heavy moan as she did so, &quot;I love you Jeremy. And I will never give you up!&quot;<br />
<br />
She couldn&#39;t help but smile as Jeremy thrust his own hips into her as well as she pulled back. It sent pulses of pleasure through her and with each thrust that both of them made together, the building pleasure in both of them grew stronger. She soon had her hands on Jeremy&#39;s hips to &quot;help&quot; him thrust forward and almost as if to hold him inside her, though as Jeremy moved to stroke her breasts with his hands, along with a few other spots that they&#39;d found to be erogenous zones on each other&#39;s bodies, Heather found herself moaning more heavily and being lost to the pleasure and love that she got from Jeremy... The boy she&#39;d loved for years, even if it was much more recent that she had actually admitted it to him. Though that didn&#39;t matter. He was her husband, and she his wife. In that, they had their happy futures that they could envision, and while their honeymoon was close to being over as they finished with New Zerzura, Heather would be more than happy to get as much &quot;private time&quot; with Jeremy as she could.</p>
