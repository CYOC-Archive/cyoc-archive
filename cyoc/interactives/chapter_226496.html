<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dragging the corpse of the guard into the shadows, Abolith now looked over the grounds of the manor. So far the elf assassin had gone unnoticed as she reached her hand up to activate her Bluetooth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shay I&#39;m in.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shay replied, going over the mission details as Abolith now made her way through the shadows. It had not been one of the more pleasant months for the elf. At the beginning of November, the sanctum she shared with Fukushu had been invaded by Tatsu. At first the elf thought the celestial kitsune had come for revenge, especially when he mentioned her son Raiden. Despite Fukushu&#39;s best effort they were unable to stop him, anticipating their deaths and for their son to be raised by the kitsune. Instead, Fukushu and his family returned to the kitsune kingdom where Abolith discovered a group of time traveling teenagers as well as a future version of her son. Despite the happy interactions with her future son, Abolith thought death would have been easier and now blamed Shay for her troubles.<br />
<br />
&quot;How many times do I have to say I&#39;m sorry,&quot; the nekomata groaned over the mic. Abolith simply grit her teeth as she now skillfully ran along the roof tops. &quot;You had one job Shay,&quot; she hissed. &quot;Inform myself and Fukushu of the wizards movements. Instead you let Hsu Hao get the drop on you before telling Akira everything. Do you have any idea how annoying it is being back in the kitsune kingdom?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What was I supposed to do,&quot; Shay exclaimed. &quot;The future girl already knew everything. Besides, a few of those future kids seem to like you two.&quot; Abolith scoffed, thinking of her meeting with Darren McKenna and Stella Heat. The two teenagers from 80 years in the future had told the pair of their relationship in the future. Honestly Abolith was having a difficult time believing it, despite the teens honesty. Fukushu trained the boy as a swordsman, molding this future Catalyst into a formidable warrior. Abolith and Stella&#39;s relationship though was much different, the future guidance counselor acting as Aboliths friend and confidant. It was hard to say, considering the pairs history, who had it worse. &quot;Hey at least I got you this job,&quot; Shay stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;And it better pay well,&quot; Abolith grumbled. &quot;Who is he anyway.&quot; As Shay now went over the target once more, Abolith now began to scale the wall of the manor. The target was apparently a high ranking member within the Normal. Although Abolith was unaware of who this organization was, according to the future teens they were responsible for systematically wiping out the wizards in the future. That part didn&#39;t bother Abolith, however, when she discovered it also meant the death of her son she became immediately interested. &quot;And how is this group connected to the One Humanity,&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It looks like they&#39;re an evolution of the One Humanity,&quot; Shay replied over the radio. &quot;Needless to say considering the One Humanity already killed off the son of a dragon, they&#39;ve made some enemies. That&#39;s why there&#39;s a $500,000 bounty out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably should&#39;ve been more,&quot; Abolith grumbled as she perched on the roof. &quot;Dragons. Always cheap when it comes to their horde.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well they also hired someone as a distraction,&quot; Shay replied. &quot;Apparently they were in contact with Lilith. You should be seeing them any minute.&quot; Confused, Abolith looked to ask Shay for more information, only for the sounds of a loud engine pierce the quiet of the night. Glancing into the courtyard, Abolith watched as a car now broke through the gates of the manor, unleashing machine gun fire and rockets on the smaller adjacent buildings. Over the din of explosions, all Abolith could hear was the blaring of punk music. &quot;Sounds like they&#39;re here.&quot;<br />
<br />
A stray rocket now soared towards the manor, detonating perhaps 50 meters from her position. Abolith shielded herself from the heat, the explosion almost knocking the assassin off the roof. &quot;Those idiots almost killed me,&quot; she yelled. &quot;They don&#39;t know you&#39;re here,&quot; Shay said quickly. &quot;Lilith sent them to cause chaos. It should leave the target open. Just go!&quot; Abolith didn&#39;t need to be told twice, the assassin now sneaking through the window.<br />
<br />
Creeping through the halls, Abolith could observe the distraction was working. Guards now seemed to run aimlessly throughout the manor, raiding the armory as they spilled out onto the grounds. For now they were of no concern. Abolith now silently made through the third floor, clinging to the ceiling as she awaited her mark. It didn&#39;t take long though as she noticed the man and something else.<br />
<br />
Her target was a man in his mid to late 40s, dressed in a business suit with thinning hair. Completely ordinary in appearance, it struck her as odd that he could cause harm to anyone. His companions were a different story, one was a doctor, Abolith assuming that based on the man&#39;s lab coat but the other was a four tailed kitsune. What a kitsune was doing here was beyond her. Watching the trio, Abolith waited until they passed underneath her before dropping from the ceiling. Unsheathing her blade, she now stabbed the man through the back, piercing his heart.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dr. Chapman get behind me,&quot; the kitsune yelled, shielding the doctor as she unsheathed her own sword. Abolith paused, studying this four tailed kitsune with interest. She didn&#39;t recognize her, which was odd considering all the time she had spent with Fukushu and the kitsune. The vixen scowled, Abolith immediately noting the mystical blade in her hand as well as her unorthodox fighting stance. &quot;A rather unique fighting style for a kitsune,&quot; she said. &quot;Who are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was going to ask the same question,&quot; the vixen growled. &quot;The names Hinata and what is an elf doing in the mortal world?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Abolith,&quot; she replied, assuming a fighting stance of her own. &quot;And I would think the answer is obvious, killing him.&quot; Hinata eyes now rested on the body of the One Humanity board member. Dr. Chapman was meeting with him this evening to discuss research with Hinata acting as Chapman&#39;s bodyguard. It was supposed to be a routine meeting, instead she now found herself face to face with an assassin. &quot;Doctor head to the escape route I&#39;ll be right behind you.&quot; Chapman nodded, sprinting off as the four tailed glared at Abolith. &quot;You&#39;ve collected your last bounty assassin!&quot; Abolith grinned, she so rarely got a chance to test herself nowadays. Perhaps this kitsune could prove to be a worthy opponent.<br />
<br />
With a yell the two duelists now sparred, Abolith impressed by the kitsunes skill and unorthodox fighting style. Locking blades, Hinata now slashed the elf along her arm with Abolith countering by slashing Hinata along the stomach. Both now staggered backwards. &quot;Not bad,&quot; Abolith grunted, noting the wound was healing slower than usual.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was about to say the same,&quot; Hinata grimaced, holding her hand along her midsection. &quot;It seems we&#39;re evenly matched. Still, you can&#39;t hope to win. With every blow I land, Moon Slayer makes me stronger.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve faced many a magical blade child,&quot; Abolith chuckled. &quot;I was a veteran of war before you were weaned. You will need more than boasts if you are to defeat me.&quot;<br />
As the pair looked to clash once more, an explosion rocked the hallway they stood. A flash of light and a thunderous shockwave now sent Abolith and Hinata sprawling in separate directions.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice shot Luca,&quot; Bong cheered as the third floor of the manor exploded. Tonight&#39;s mission for Misery and her friends was simple, destroy this building by any means necessary. Destruction though for this group was as natural as breathing. With the third floor of the manor now rubble, the group exchanged a celebratory congratulations as the manor burned. &quot;Hey what&#39;s that,&quot; Jolie asked, pointing to a figure emerging from the rubble.<br />
<br />
Misery and the others paused, curiously watching as a four tailed kitsune now emerged from the fire. The kitsunes breathing was ragged, her eyes glinting with maniacal hatred as she gripped her sword. &quot;Wow she looks pissed,&quot; Jolie whispered. &quot;Do we shoot her?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh yeah,&quot; Bong exclaimed. &quot;Set light her up!&quot; The mummy didn&#39;t need any more convincing, pointing the mini gun at the kitsune before opening fire. Much to the groups surprise the kitsune now deflected the bullets, dodging out of the way of others as she sprinted towards the car. &quot;Set quit fucking around!&quot;<br />
<br />
Panic was beginning to sink in as the enraged kitsune charged. How was she able to deflect and dodge a mini gun? Bong now withdrew the sword the Normal had given her, hoping to at least slow her down. Instead Hinata now disarmed Bong, slashing her across the chest before knocking her to the ground. Bong now found herself struggling to keep this crazed kitsune from piercing her heart. &quot;Jolie get this fuzzy bitch off me!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jolie nodded, useing her magic to open a portal. A single tentacle racing out and knocking Hinata off Bong. Misery and Luca now assisted the vampire to her feet, anxiously gazing at the kitsune. Whoever this kitsune was, she was going to be a problem.<br />
<br />
As the group now tried to think of a plan, a dark blue blur sprinted behind the kitsune kicking her in the back. Hinata was sent sprawling, the air temporarily knocked out of her. As the figure approached, Miserys eyes went wide beneath her plague mask. &quot;Abolith?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Give me the rocket launcher NOW,&quot; the elf bellowed at Luca. Stunned, the werewolf could do little more than comply, handing the weapon to Abolith who promptly unloaded the remaining rockets at Hinata. A massive explosion now engulfed the kitsune for the moment as Abolith turned to the group. &quot;Get in the car and drive,&quot; she bellowed. &quot;We have to go!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who the fuck are you lady,&quot; Jolie exclaimed. Glancing towards the massive fireball, the group watched in abject terror as the kitsune now emerged, her brow furrowed as she glared at the intruders. &quot;Yeah I think we should go,&quot; Jolie whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shay take off I have another ride,&quot; Abolith said quickly as the group piled into the car. As Bong now floored the accelerator, Hinata watched them leave, furious at the groups actions and vowing to get even very, very soon.</p>
