<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Marty awkwardly slide out of Lizzys arms as she bit her bottom lip. This was all so much to process. Marty walked to the kitchen as he fumbled with the box of cereal, his body felt like it was on auto-mode as the shock had yet to wear off. He shakily poured the milk he stared into the bowl, was this some kind of horrible nightmare? It had to be, maybe it was one of those lucid dreams he had heard about online. He had never experienced one but it had to be, the alternative was just too much to imagine. Marty shoved a spoonful of cereal into his mouth as he tried to contemplate the situation. Lizzy returned from the other room as she gasped. &quot;Oh my goodness you&#39;re naked?!?&quot;<br />
<br />
Marty looked down confused, yea, he must have forgotten to put anything on after last night. &quot;Yea?&quot; He replied sarcastically. Lizzy&#39;s face turned beet red. &quot;G-go get clothes on right now!&quot; She stamped her foot as she pointed to the door. Marty raised an eyebrow at the whole scene as he stood up from the kitchen stool, his cock hanging down freely. Lizzy tried to cover her eyes as she yelled. &quot;I didn&#39;t see anything.&quot; She pointed again in the direction of the door. &quot;Go!&quot; <br />
<br />
Marty shrugged, unable to protest as he walked back to his room. What was all that about? Marty shook his head in confusion as he went to look at his clothes he had purchased yesterday. He didn&#39;t think he&#39;d get this young, while the stuff he bought would fit him better the only things left that were smaller were......Timmy&#39;s clothes. He had packed some in his own bag for the trip. Marty stared at the clothes for a moment as the tingling feeling in his side returned. Marty could feel his perspective shifting as he had lost another inch of height. Moving back to the bathroom mirror he was maybe sixteen, a brushing of acne sold his transformation into a teenager, his hair oily and unstyled, his pubes became a unshaved mess. &quot;Yup, definitely a teenager again.&quot; Marty said to himself, shocked at how his voice was starting to sound so different. Marty felt the pang in his stomach return as he had a idea, standing next to the wall he placed his head against it. Sure enough, as if he was slowly sinking into quicksand, he felt his head drag down the wall, it was barely noticeable, but still present. He was still getting younger. <br />
<br />
Marty put on the clothes, they were way too large on him, but luckily his belt still was able to fasten his pants mostly. His shirt drapped down over his waist as he combed his hair. Marty collected himself and sighed as he opened the door again from his room. Lizzy stood there with her arms crossed. &quot;Look I don&#39;t know what you do while you&#39;re at home alone, but here when I&#39;m in charge you gotta obey the rules. That means you wear clothes ok?&quot; Lizzy stared daggers into Marty as he just looked on with confusion. &quot;Look, I&#39;m going to have to tell your parents this happened.&quot; she rebuttled. &quot;I&#39;ll give them a call once we have cell service in town.&quot; Marty looked even more confused. &quot;My parents? Their in their eighties what are they going to do?&quot; Lizzy shrugged, &quot;It&#39;s not for me to decide that.&quot; she said as she sat down, looking to make herself some breakfast. Marty was so confused, he has to ask the obvious. &quot;Lizzy, uh, who am I to you? Don&#39;t you remember last night?&quot; Lizzy turned back, &quot;Marty you&#39;re just a kid I&#39;m babysitting here, don&#39;t get any weird ideas, we just had smores by the fire last night.&quot; Marty shook his head, they didn&#39;t do anything like that, and a babysitter? What? What was going on? Marty&#39;s brain was thinking hard as he watched Lizzy finish her breakfast. The pang returned as it was much stronger than before. Marty ran back to his room, his clothes growing on him rapidly. Marty looked into the bathroom mirror as he watched himself lose nearly a foot in height in a few minutes, his face growing smoother as the faint line of facial hair faded away. Marty felt a pressure in his groin as he pulled down his pants desperately. Like a sudden urge he couldn&#39;t help himself as he masterbated, each second feeling as his penis grew smaller with each stroke. Marty gasped as a small trickle of cum leaked from his dick. Only now noticing his pubes starting to shrink away one by one, his balls growing smaller and more compact to his penis. &quot;Oh my god, I just went through puberty.&quot; Marty&#39;s eyes shot wide open at the sound of his voice, it was much higher than before, like a kids. Marty looked up at the mirror, he looked like his thirteen year old self. He heard a knock on the door, it was Lizzy again. &quot;Marty, we gotta go it&#39;s almost noon.&quot; Marty looked back in confusion, he was so much smaller now, there was no way he&#39;d fit into...<br />
Marty looked back to his suitcase, as he walked over he pulled out Timmy&#39;s clothes, they were a good enough fit, abit snug actually. <br />
<br />
Marty opened the door meekly. Lizzy smiled at him, her attitude much more understanding and caring, &quot;Come on we&#39;re gotta go into town.&quot; Marty looked on worried she would scold him again, but she acted like it was more an accident than anything perverted, she was treating him like a kid.<br />
<br />
Lizzy opened the cars back door. &quot;Come on.&quot; She gestured as Marty hopped in. He wasn&#39;t used to sitting in the back, but didn&#39;t want to protest it anymore. Lizzy started the car as they pulled out of the cabin, the forest growing around them as she continued down the dirt road back to the town.<br />
<br />
It took them nearly two hours to reach town, by then Marty felt even smaller, he had to guess he was barely ten years old, his height was shrinking even more as his feet had left the ground of the car. Lizzy parked the car. &quot;Alright, hold on I&#39;ll be right back.&quot; she said as she stepped out for a moment. Marty looked up out the window as suddenly the door opened. Marty looked on with concern as Lizzy has next to her a car seat. &quot;Ok, hop out while I fix this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marty complied, standing nervously while she attached the car seat into the back seat. &quot;Alright, there we go.&quot; she said with a clap. Marty shook his head. &quot;Who&#39;s that for?&quot; Lizzy let out a small laugh, &quot;That&#39;s for you silly. Also I called your dad, he should be here late tonight.&quot; Marty gave her a side glance as he tried to protest Lizzy picking him up, she was much too big for him now, she picked him up like a feather. Lizzy clicked together the carseats straps as she climbed back in the car. &quot;Alright, let&#39;s have a little lunch and then we&#39;ll head back.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two stopped at a local food chain. Marty disappointed in that he was forced to order from the kids menu, but after seeing the proportions he didn&#39;t protest any further. His perspective has shifted that even normal objects seemed so much larger, a seat was as tall as him, a fork was larger than his hand. Marty went to the bathroom at the restaurant, only to find he couldn&#39;t even reach the sink without being on his tippy toes. Timmy&#39;s clothes now growing bulkier on him by the second as he shrinked down to the single digits. He walked out of the bathroom to find Lizzy right outside. &quot;Are you ready kiddo?&quot; Marty nodded, as she grabbed his hand as they went back to the car. Marty hoped maybe he&#39;d have a answer to this when he woke up from this dream. The car hit the dirt road as a bump caused his shoe to slip off, even Timmy&#39;s shoes were too big for him now. Marty looked at his clothes, his arms seemingly shrinking into tee-shirt. <br />
<br />
By the time Marty left the car he had returned to the cabin barely five years old, it was turning to night as the clock struck seven. Lizzy, noticing his shoe, simply picked him up and carried him inside. &quot;Whoopsies, forgot your shoe didn&#39;t you? I&#39;ll grab it later.&quot; she said in a sweet voice. She set him down once they were inside. &quot;Ok, it&#39;s getting late so let&#39;s get you into a bath before bed.&quot; Marty shook his head. &quot;But I don&#39;t want too!&quot; <br />
<br />
Lizzy didn&#39;t take no for an answer as even as he tried to run away she was swiftly able to catch him, scooping him up she carried him to the bathroom. Lizzy helped strip Marty down, he didn&#39;t want to feel embarrassed, especially to his wife, but so much had happened to day he didn&#39;t know what to feel. She towered over him, his head barely reaching her thigh. She placed him into the warm bathwater. Marty expected her to leave him while in the bath but instead started to pull out the soap and shampoo as she started to wash him. Marty felt mortified, having his wife scrub him from head to toe. &quot;Aw does my baby has soap in his hair? Yes he does.&quot; Lizzy playfully coo&#39;ed. Baby? Marty looked up at Lizzy confused, she kissed Marty on the forehead gingerly. &quot;Aw don&#39;t you look at me with those big ol eyes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lizzy pulled the plug as she picked up Marty, staggering abit as he realized he was barely up to her knee. He looked around the room, everything was so tall, he couldn&#39;t even look over the sink anymore, let alone the mirror. He must have been only three years old! Lizzy grabbed a towel as she carried him back to Timmy&#39;s former room. Placing him down in the bed she kissed him. &quot;Shh, don&#39;t cry, mommies here for you&quot; Lizzy smiled as Marty as left defeated, his wife now thought he was her kid, was he that young now? The light switch flicked off as Marty looked at the clock. It was almost half an hour to midnight, where did the day go? Marty stretched as he crept back into a year old, his body growing hard to move as he closed his eyes to sleep.</p>
