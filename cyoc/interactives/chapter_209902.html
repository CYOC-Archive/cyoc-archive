<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Troy lay down in bed, one arm slung over his face. He’d sold a man into studwork. A good man, one he could have seen himself with…well, Brandon hadn’t been interested, had he? It was just a goddamn shame. He felt hot tears spill down his cheek. <br />
<br />
Dustin whimpered, the dog hopping up onto the bed and licking his face tenderly. <br />
<br />
“Down, Dustin.” Troy tried to push his dog away.<br />
<br />
The big German shepherd refused to budge, and Troy wanted to shove him away. Hadn’t he told him to Be a Good Boy? But still the dog persisted, and Troy had to haul himself out of bed and feed the damn thing. Why had even gotten a dog anyways?<br />
<br />
Troy paused after filling up Dustin’s bowl. <br />
<br />
Right. He’d transformed Dustin into a dog. Troy chuckled and shook his head. So much had been happening in his life lately that Dustin had slipped from his mind. He looked down at the dog as it hungrily wolfed down his food and pat his big furry head, smiling. Dustin really was a good boy. But did he need a dog or a guy who could keep him focused on his goal: making money?<br />
<br />
Troy continued to pet the German Shepherd and decided he could wait a bit longer to transform the guy back. Maybe if his parents come looking for him. But having such an obedient pet was growing on him, actually. He walked back to his bedroom and fell asleep on the bed, originally intending to only nap for a few hours before making dinner.<br />
<br />
Instead, he woke up the next morning to his alarm clock going off at 7AM sharp. Troy had forgotten to turn the damn thing off after he quit working. Wait, 7AM? He’d lost the whole rest of the yesterday?! Troy bolted out of bed, flung open the backdoor to let Dustin out, the dog scrambling for the backyard, then poured him a bowl of food.<br />
<br />
That executive guy was coming over in a few hours and he hadn’t even lined up a buyer!<br />
<br />
Troy got on his laptop and began going through the various sites he’d bookmarked. He had the control spell, and now that Hollywood was interested in trained animals, and he could provide literal trained animals, well, his price point had just increased. So he flipped through trained animals wanted ads. <br />
<br />
Trained bears needed for survival movie…$20K. Hmmm….not enough to deal with a fucking bear in his house. Monkeys…nah, they wanted trainers on site with the animal, Troy would rather make another prize boar than go to the shithole that was LA. Oh, here was something: White Tiger, trained, for Vegas Magic Show. WTB $50,000.<br />
<br />
Troy smiled and picked up the phone. <br />
<br />
“Hi, my name is David Flint. Yes, I do have an absolutely stunning stripe-less white tiger. He is absolutely docile and will follow any commands you give him…Yes, but I’m having licensing issues right now. I can drop him off at my nephew’s apartment…No, he can’t have tigers on his property, so if I drop him off, you guys will need to be quick and discrete…Check is fine. Thanks. What time?…Today at 7PM? Well, I can have him dropped off an ready for pickup by 3PM. Just give my nephew the check, that will be fine…Thanks, pleasure doing business…Why yes, I do other show animals, and once you’ve seen how well-trained Shiro is, you’ll want to keep my number on file…Yes, that’s his name…Thank you, bye.”<br />
<br />
He sat back on the couch, satisfied, and waited for his second victim to enter his trap. Troy didn’t have to wait too long, because the man arrived forty minutes early. He’d just finished grilling a ham and Swiss sandwich and was sitting down to eat when his doorbell rang. Troy looked up at the clock and frowned. 1:20PM. The guy should have gotten in at, like 2PM, at the earliest.<br />
<br />
Sighing, he got up, plastered on a smile, and walked to the door. He opened it and saw a man in a suit standing on his doorstep. A car sat in Troy’s parking spot. Rental. He’d have to do something about that. Those cars had trackers. <br />
<br />
“Are you TrojanHorse?” The man asked.<br />
<br />
“Yes. Are you the Hollywood special effects guy?”<br />
<br />
“Executive. And yes.” The man pushed past Troy and stepped into his apartment.<br />
<br />
“Wait-excuse me!” Troy protested.<br />
<br />
“Look kid, I’m here on limited time. You either got something for me, or you’re a non-starter and I wasted good money to get here.” <br />
<br />
“You-you haven’t even told me your name!” Troy said, flustered.<br />
<br />
“Toby Richards.” The man was inspecting his rather spartan home. “This is it?”<br />
<br />
Troy had started discretely packing things away he wasn’t going to need. Less things to wipe fingerprints off of. So his apartment currently looked…kinda like a BnB. A couch, a coffee table, a TV, a laptop, and the camera setup.<br />
<br />
“Uh, yeah. This is where the bread gets buttered.” Troy shrugged, not even sure if he got the saying right.<br />
<br />
“That’s not how the saying goes. Anyways, I’m not impressed. Did you farm the work out to a third-party? Who do I really have to talk to?” Toby asked, playing with the phones and webcams Troy had rigged. “These cameras are terrible. Haven’t you heard of rentals?”<br />
<br />
“They cost thousands.” Troy replied, feeling more than a little defensive. “I make do.”<br />
<br />
“You never answered my question. Do you do it or does the third party?”<br />
<br />
“There is no third party, and I perform acts of motherfucking magic in the literal sense. Stand on that blue X taped onto my floor.” Troy said angrily.<br />
<br />
“No such thing as magic.” Toby scoffed.<br />
<br />
“Guess you’ll find out in exactly fifteen seconds, huh?” Troy said, starting his recording equipment. “So what’ll it be? Cat, dog, giraffe, blue whale…”<br />
<br />
“None. I wanna see how you render non-standard animals. Any AI worth its salt can photo-morph, now.” The executive reached into his pocket and pulled out a drawing.<br />
<br />
It was furry art. On it was a cute and colorful femme anthro cat, whose coat was white with colored accents and bangs. Professional and expensive art by a rather famous artist. Troy looked up at the guy. <br />
<br />
“Is this your OC?”<br />
<br />
“Do you like it?” The man smiled.<br />
<br />
“No.” Troy said flatly.<br />
<br />
“So I was fifteen when I first thought of Shane. He’s bubbly and outgoing…” The man just started babbling. Troy stared at the man, wondering where the asshole from before had gone. Fucking LA. “…So I thought, if he can render me into this, two birds with one stone, right?”<br />
<br />
“...Are you done?” Troy asked.<br />
<br />
“Yes. Can you do it or not, shit for brains?” Toby rolled his eyes. “Right in front of me?”<br />
<br />
Troy pointed a finger at the businessman, eyes flat, trying to imagine a body that would fit his proportions while still being femme. “Half.”<br />
<br />
“Half? Is that the magic word?” The man asked, grinning, not snitching his hair lighten to white and colorful bangs begin to extend over his eyes. <br />
<br />
“Hands.” Troy replied.<br />
<br />
“What?”<br />
<br />
“Look at your hands.” Troy repeated.<br />
<br />
Toby looked down at his hands just in time to see them shift into dexterous paws, claws popping out of his fingers as he gently flexed them. Then the same white fur his hair had shifted into slowly covered them and traveled up his arms. A look of horror and delight danced on his face.<br />
<br />
“It-it’s real!?” Toby marveled at his arms as they grew thinner and a bit longer. “Am I getting taller?”<br />
<br />
“I can’t change your body composition. In other words, fat people become fat anthros. So If I want to make you skinnier, I have to stretch you slightly to pull the effect off.” Troy explained.<br />
<br />
The businessman’s face warped and shifted into a cute, big eyed cat-creature that Troy honestly wasn’t sure was physically possible, given the dimensions, but it was what the guy asked for. The changes were spreading down his long, lithe form, and stopping at his digitigrade footpaws.<br />
<br />
“This, this is amazing!” Toby exclaimed. “Real magic! You could make a fortune off this in the film industry, kid!”<br />
<br />
“You want me to expose the fact that I can warp reality to greedy executives?” Troy asked, nonplussed.<br />
<br />
The businessman wasn’t listening anymore, bouncing up and down excitedly, playing with his growing tail. It was actually a rather ridiculously long tail, especially considering the man’s proportions, but Troy guessed that was the man’s ‘thing’.<br />
<br />
“Dude, can I run outside?” Toby asked excitedly.<br />
<br />
“Backyard,” Tory pointed, “And you have-”<br />
<br />
The man was gone, running out the back door and doing cartwheels and handstands. He really was a showman. Troy smirked. He’d make a great show cat.<br />
<br />
While he was outside playing, Troy went to the kitchen and finished eating, taking out a can of Coke and pouring himself a glass. He didn’t want to get caught up in the guy’s excitement and make the same mistakes he’d done with Brandon. This one would go like clockwork. He kept an eye on the clock. <br />
<br />
The buyers would be here in a few hours. How long would it take him to nab all the man’s personal information before he got sent away? He guesstimated maybe an hour if things went horribly wrong. Maybe slow-burn the tiger TF, give him his money’s worth, then Control him and wait for the buyers to show up with a trailer and cart him off. It was 3PM when he decided to call the guy back in.<br />
<br />
“Okay, bro, free trial is up.” Troy called, waving the femme catboi back into the house.<br />
<br />
Said catboi was lying on his back, playing with his toebeans. He kipped up and ran on all fours into the house, Dustin running back inside after him. Troy huffed and rolled his eyes. He’d wanted to keep the dog outside for the duration of the man’s stay. He wasn’t comfortable with having Dustin around. Just in case someone made the connection between the dog video and Troy’s missing best friend.<br />
<br />
Like Brandon had.<br />
<br />
“So.” Troy closed the door and locked it. “There’s my laptop. Go ahead and Paypal me that $100,000. As you promised.”<br />
<br />
“Of course!” The catboi exclaimed, his voice pitched higher. He jumped on the couch and eagerly began accessing his bank account and Paypal information, typing in usernames and passwords.<br />
<br />
Troy’s keystroke logger had been turned on when the catboi was outside, and the camera on the shelf was recording everything the man typed as well, just in case. Toby wouldn’t be needing it anymore after today.<br />
<br />
“Alright, done!’ The man smiled. “Should arrive in your account in a few days once Paypal verifies the transaction as legit.”<br />
<br />
“Heh, I appreciate it.” Troy smiled.<br />
<br />
“Man, you should really take advantage of that magic!” Toby smiled, the look rather…appealing on the cute catboi’s face. “You could, like, change the world.”<br />
<br />
“That’s true.” Tory paused, “Why were you so rude to me earlier?”<br />
<br />
“Rude?” The catboi’s brow’s raised. “That’s Hollywood, baby. You gotta be a dick, throw your weight around, or people’ll step all over you.”<br />
<br />
“Oh. Understandable, then” Troy smiled. “So, ever have a fantasy of going feral? If life as an Effects Director is too stressful, and you wish you could just forget about all of that, just be happy and proud to just…be?”<br />
<br />
“Heh, is this a sales pitch?” Toby smirked. “I hear ‘em all the time, kid.”<br />
<br />
“I’m sure you do.” Troy smiled. “I was just thinking, maybe…you wanna try feral.”<br />
<br />
“Fuck yeah I do!” Toby exclaimed, shocking troy. “Dude, ever since I saw you turned that guy into a dog…” His eyes flicked to the German Shepherd. “Uh, is that him?”<br />
<br />
Troy nodded.<br />
<br />
“Can he understand me?” Toby asked.<br />
<br />
“Kinda. Dustin’s still in there, he’s just…deep, you know?”<br />
<br />
“And he wanted to stay like this?” Toby asked.<br />
<br />
“Oh yes. But just for a month.” Troy lied. “I believe he is on day two of not having to care about anything but being a good boy.”<br />
<br />
“Hot.” Toby smiled, petting Dustin. “So I was thinkin’ Donkey, like in Pinocchio. Pleasure Island, you know?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, a Donkey, huh?” Troy grinned. “You’re already quite an ass already. I was thinking of something more elegant, more powerful. Something that effortlessly captures the attention of anyone who sees him, the biggest act on stage. Beautiful, powerful, terrifying, all combined into one handsome package.”<br />
<br />
“Oh?” Toby swallowed. “I was afraid of asking…”<br />
<br />
“White tiger.” Troy said.<br />
<br />
The catboi fanned himself. “Oh, that’s one hell of a pitch. But why not donkey?”<br />
<br />
“It’s more of a punishment thing and I don’t really have a barn or proper lighting to do the TF justice. But I DO have a big pedestal.” Troy grinned.<br />
<br />
“Well, wait, how long can I be one?”<br />
<br />
“As long as you want.”<br />
<br />
“And you have, like, permits?”<br />
<br />
“Taken care of.” Troy waved his hand. “There’s a stage show in Vegas that needs a cat to perform for the next month.”<br />
<br />
“A stage magician’s tiger?’ The man’s eyes widened. “Wow, but a month, that’s a long commit…”<br />
<br />
“You’d just be a loaner.” Troy assured him. “Worse comes to worse, I swoop in and we do the best magic show that the strip has ever seen! Uh, wait, what are you doing?”<br />
<br />
The catboi had pulled out some white powder and was using a tampon to snort it all up. He wrinkled his nose and leaned back on the couch after doing a few lines. His tongue wagged oddly.<br />
<br />
“Wow, shit hits better as a catboi, I swear to gooooooood!” Toby said, snuffling his nose. “Fuck man, let’s fucking DO THIS SHIT BRO!”<br />
<br />
“O-Okay, yeah.” Troy gulped, wondering where all the energy-oh, never mind. <br />
<br />
“FUCK YEAH BRO!” Toby hollered.<br />
<br />
“Get the fuck on that pedestal, big cat!” Troy said, trying to match his exuberance. “Also thin walls, sorry. Please shut the fuck up.”<br />
<br />
“Alright, alright, sorry. Fuck this is gonna be fun!” Toby whispered, jaw working strangely as he hauled the pedestal over to the big blue X. “Like this, man?”<br />
<br />
“Oh yeah. Let’s bring you back to human first.” Troy said.<br />
<br />
“Ah, can’t we just…” Toby made a cute little pose. “Rawr! You fucking know what I mean, man?”<br />
<br />
“Not a clue. Half.” Troy said, pointing at the catboi.<br />
<br />
His exaggerated feline features quickly receded, the process only taking a few seconds. Troy had figured out that he could will changes to happen faster or slower by concentrating. The spells were still taking his energy, but he wasn’t nearly as exhausted as he had been yesterday, though. He pulled out a can of redbull and downed it for the show, though eyed the last unsnorted line of coke. Then he shook his head. He had enough shit to worry about, he didn’t need a coke addiction to boot. Besides, that shit was expensive.<br />
<br />
“Alright, all human. What now?”<br />
<br />
“Go ahead and start posing. Try to really get into the transformation, like you’re a big, hot, cat and proud of it.” Troy smirked.<br />
<br />
“Fuck yeah! Oh, can I get some tiger pussy while I’m at the show?”<br />
<br />
“Actually…yeah.” Troy wrote something down. “I can actually get a few things arranged for you. Diet?”<br />
<br />
“Steaks and salmon and pussy, bro, all fucking day!” Toby grinned. <br />
<br />
“A femme fursona and a need for pussy?” Troy raised a brow.<br />
<br />
“I’m usually leaning gay, but, bro, I definitely want to impregnate some cats and have, like, puppies-”<br />
<br />
“Cubs.” Tory corrected.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, shit, that would be hot, turning human knowing I have kids!”<br />
<br />
“Kids are goats, but…you know, what, I’m being nicer than I need to, so it’s whatever.” Troy sighed and pointed, “Shape.”<br />
<br />
“So Half for anthros and Shape for ferals?” The man asked, rubbing the back of his neck.<br />
<br />
Troy smiled, watching the thick tufts of white fur growing there. Toby pulled at the hair, grunting, as the skin of his neck seemed to stretch, growing looser like a real cat’s. His hands traveled up to the top of his head, where Troy could the brown hair there lightening into pure white fur. <br />
<br />
“Yes.” Troy smiled.<br />
<br />
“I was-oh, my hands are going!” The business man exclaimed, bringing his hands out in front of him. <br />
<br />
His fingers were growing fatter and stubbier, becoming more like the toe’s of a tiger’s paws than human digits. Pink paw pads welled out of his palms and his thumb was yanked up his wrist, where it pudged into a cute little dewclaw. Thick fur began springing up as the paw grew rounder and more massive, the fur traveling up his arms, fur beginning to sprout along his neck and face, like a big white beard.<br />
<br />
Troy leaned back and unzipped his pants, his cock hardening as he watched the man unwittingly let go of his humanity permanently without even putting up a struggle. He was glad he’d made it slow. He wanted to see that light leave the man’s eyes-but not before he got a few licks in of his own. His hand began to stroke his length, beads of pre forming and trickling down his shaft.<br />
<br />
“I can-” The man wriggled his nose as whiskers began to grow from his lips and his nose blackened. He huffed. “I can smell you jerking off, man. Hot shit!”<br />
<br />
Troy grinned, stroking faster.<br />
<br />
The fur had traversed his spin and it popped, loudly, sending the man to all fours. Toby groaned as a nub pressed out from between his cheeks. It quickly grew into a long tail that lashed in a happy frenzy. His legs cracked, the heels rising higher, feet quickly shifting into big paws, built to support a big cat’s weight, and his knees moved closer to his hips. Toby dug his claws into the pedestal, back arching as his spine cracked again and the man’s body lengthened.<br />
<br />
Troy’s fist was a blur and he watched.<br />
<br />
The tiger groaned as his body was fully covered with white fur and his muscles began to grow and shift into their proper positions. They were lean but powerful, bulging even through the thick white coat of fur. Troy watched as Toby’s cock and balls get enveloped by a fur sheathe and nestle themselves between his hind legs.<br />
<br />
Toby’s face began to push forward into a thick muzzle, his teeth elongating into fangs. He was close. Toby’s ears were getting longer and furrier, rising up the sides of his head to their place near the top of his distorting skull .Troy watched as the former businessman’s eyes began to change color. Now would be a good time to tell him, he thought, panting. <br />
<br />
But Toby beat him to the punch.<br />
<br />
”Hrwo leerng, ageeen?” The man tried talking through his muzzle, human speech difficult. <br />
<br />
“Forever, Shiro.” Troy said. “You’re never going to be human again. This is permanent.”<br />
<br />
“Thiss rrwas noawt…” Toby swallowed. “Grraggh! Rrrgh!”<br />
<br />
Troy was almost there. He pointed as the lights of sentience began to fade from Toby’s eyes. “Control. You are docile. You don’t remember being human. You follow orders. You are proud, and will suck yourself to completion every night, thinking about yourself and how handsome and beautiful you are. You experience a state of orgasm for an hour after every successful performance, but are quiet about it. Your name is Shiro.”<br />
<br />
Troy felt a massive amount of energy leave him. He fell back onto the couch as he came, hard, cum splattering every where.<br />
<br />
“Lick me clean, Shiro.” Troy gasped, exhausted.<br />
<br />
The big cat hopped off his pedestal and wandered over to Troy and began nuzzling his hand and groin, great tongue gently licking his semen off. Troy could feel darkness encroach at the edges of his vision. Had it been too many commands that was sucking so much energy out of him?<br />
<br />
“You…had a very successful performance.” Troy managed, fingers ending the recording.<br />
<br />
Shiro yowled as his tongue kept licking Tory’s groin, his hips bucking, tiger semen splattering on the floor. The cat kept nuzzling and licking Troy, balls tensing, and began loudly purring as the orgasmic state began. Troy rubbed the tiger’s massive head and passed out.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br />
<br />
Troy woke up completely naked, his clothes ripped and on the floor. A massive tongue was gently licking his hair. Why was-? Oh, he hadn’t specified what part of him needed to be cleaned, so the tiger had cleaned all of him.<br />
<br />
He checked the clock. Only a few hours had passed. It was almost seven. Shit! The buyers were gonna be here!<br />
<br />
Troy tried pulling away to put on some clothes, but the tiger growled and held him tightly with one big paw, lapping behind his ears and snuffling at his face, tongue lapping there as well. Troy closed his eyes, wincing as the rough tongue lathered his cheeks with saliva.<br />
<br />
“Enough cleaning, Shiro! Go sit on the pedestal!” Troy gasped out, getting a mouthful of tiger tongue and spit. “Pfftah! Go on!”<br />
<br />
The tiger rumbled and walked over to the pedestal and jumped onto it lightly, tail flicking. He truly was a beautiful creature. His muscles had grown while Troy was unconscious, and the beautiful pure-white tiger had become massive. There was an air of pride to the cat that Troy had made sure to instill. Gotta be a proper performer.<br />
<br />
There came a knock on his door.<br />
<br />
“Shit!” Troy said and scrambled for some non-ripped clothes, shoving the ripped ones into the hamper. “Uh, coming! In the bathroom!”<br />
<br />
“Take your time.” A man’s voice called. <br />
<br />
Troy threw on some clothes and ran to the door and flung it open. An older, bald man stood there. He wore a white t-shirt with VEGAS PERFORMERS ASSOCIATION printed on it. Behind him was a cage on wheels. Behind that, parked in the small parking lot, was a tractor-trailer with a picture of a tiger jumping through flaming hoops.<br />
<br />
“Uh…is that the tiger?” The man peered at the Shiro, who still sat on the pedestal.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I said he was well-trained. You can even get him to do the deed in the toilet. Just order him to.” Troy said, checking around to make sure his neighbors weren’t around. <br />
<br />
He thought he saw the curtains move at Clint’s window. Fuck. The cat needed to go, now.<br />
<br />
“That…we don’t need a leash?” The man’s eyes were wide.<br />
<br />
“Shiro, get in the cage.” Troy said.<br />
<br />
The tiger hopped off the pedestal, past the bald man, who stepped clear, and got into the cage.<br />
<br />
“Shut the cage.” Troy ordered.<br />
<br />
The cat pawed at the latch and the cage door slammed down. The bald man stared at Troy, then back at the cat. <br />
<br />
“Magic.” Troy explained. “I ain’t gotta explain shit.”<br />
<br />
“I’ll say. Anything we order him to do?”<br />
<br />
“Anything.”<br />
<br />
“Why do you have a tiger?”<br />
<br />
 “Ask me no questions, I’ll tell you no lies.” Troy said firmly. “Or I tell him to get out of the cage and eat you.”<br />
<br />
“...He can do that?” The man swallowed and stared at Troy.<br />
<br />
“Not really, I trained him to ignore kill orders. He’s perfectly docile and will obey every other command.”<br />
<br />
“Sweet Jesus.”<br />
<br />
“It’s Troy.” Troy extended a hand.<br />
<br />
The man shook it. “Got any more animals that well trained, Troy?”<br />
<br />
“Oh. I believe I do.” Troy smiled. “Just ask.”<br />
<br />
“I think I will.” The man grinned. “That…I think I will. Here’s the check.”<br />
<br />
Troy took it and nodded. “Pleasure doing business with you.”<br />
<br />
“Likewise.” The man carted the tiger away and loaded it onto the tractor-trailer. <br />
<br />
Troy watched as they maneuvered out of the small parking lot and grinned to himself, looking down at the check. He didn’t feel bad at all about this one. The dickhead got what he had coming to him.<br />
<br />
Movement at the corner of his vision caught his eye. He turned just in time to see Clint putting his phone away, into his pocket. He looked up, eyes wide when he met Troy’. He gave Troy a shy wave before ducking back into his apartment and shutting the door. Troy heard the lock latch into place.<br />
<br />
Troy frowned. Had Clint been recording that exchange? That wouldn’t do. Telling the police someone had a tiger in their apartment was one thing. Having video evidence was another thing entirely. Troy wasn’t sure if it was illegal…Troy’s eyes widened. Unless he’d filmed Troy receiving a check. That might be…somehow illegal.<br />
<br />
Another ping came from his computer. Troy shook his head. He’d worry about Clint later. Right now, business was booming. At least he’d be able to afford a new lawyer once he cashed the check.</p>
