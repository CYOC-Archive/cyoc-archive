<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Anyone who wants an illustration for easier visualization of the outfit I describe in question should look up the video or pictures from the Resident Evil 2 Remake featuring Ada Wong in a naughty shrinemaiden bikini from the PC mod of the same name.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sarah pressed the button and before Roy could utter a single additional protest a violent shutter ripped through his body that completely took his breath away. Roy would have screamed but the air had completely been sucked out of his lungs in the process of the shutter and he was forced to close his eyes and open his mouth as if he was screaming in agony. Just as Roy thought he was going to pass out the violent shakes ceased in a process that only lasted several seconds but to Roy seemed like minutes. Having leaned down towards the ground Roy was in a state of shock and that didn’t even include having a pair of black sunglasses with wide lenses fall forward and come to rest in place on the nose bridge. Roy slowly began rising again but already found that something was off and out of the ordinary.<br />
<br />
Upright and standing tall once again Roy opened her eyes and immediately saw what was the problem as soon as her curious eyes tracked downward to the changes that were waiting beneath. “No, No, No, No, Nooooooo” screamed Roy even as she slapped her palm over her mouth at the high-pitched girly tone that emanated from her lips. Roy screamed again when she saw the dainty small hands and red nail polish on her covering hand. Uncovering her mouth Roy was about to pass out from the revelations of what she had become. Roy knew it looked familiar but couldn’t quite place it in context that was until she looked to where a grinning Sarah was pointing the device to, a unclear photograph in Jack’s photo album. Rushing over in her alien body over to the photo album nearly tripping in the wedged high-heels she was wearing and pushing Sarah out of the way Roy picked up the album with both hands and saw the woman and the outfit she was wearing be a mirror image of her own self.<br />
<br />
The picture was a posing snapshot of Sarah at a Halloween costume party that Sarah and Jack had gone to last Halloween and that Jack’s best friend and rich coworker had thrown. The party was a celebration for couples and so no expense was spared by the woman who went to dress sexy and alluring for their men in a night of drink, drugs, and high libido. Unfortunately for Roy Sarah played this book to the letter in wanting to look attractive and have Jack’s eyes pinned on her the whole night. In that seductive pose stood Sarah with a pair of sunglasses resting on her forehead and herself stood in a white thong bikini her breasts held up by two thin white straps that wrapped around her frame and expanded at her nipples to form a square of fabric that extended between the two straps, both square pieces had a red heart on them. Her bottom piece wasn’t much better she had one thin white bikini strap that encircled her waist and only expanded in size a small amount to barely reach down and cover her genitals and butt crack, both the front and rear of the flap also had a red heart on it. Sarah was wearing long white stockings that went all the way up to mid thigh and had a thin red ribbon tied at the beginning of each her thighs not to mention the previously noted thick wedge high-heels which were red in color. What made this outfit really a costume was two flowing cut-off sleeves of white robes with open red cuffs on the wrists that hung on her arms held up by a tight red cuff on each arm that the robes sprung from on her biceps. Sarah at the time claimed that she was dressed as a bikini shrine-maiden but Jack and every man at the party didn’t care what she claimed to be but instead was just happy that she chose the costume she did.<br />
<br />
Taking a few deep breaths with her eyes closed after seeing the truth right in front of her Roy pushed herself off the desk that she had been leaning on and upon opening her eyes gave herself a quick look over. There wasn’t much to look at that she hadn’t already seen in the photograph as the outfit was the same down to a T. Roy was still in shock to the long hair that tickled her shoulders or to the heavy weights on her chest and the thin straps digging into her flesh holding them in place (badly) but that didn’t even come close to the missing piece of her former self between her legs that now felt like there wasn’t anything covering that region expect again for a tiny strap. The heels would take some getting used to as well as the tight stockings but it wasn’t like she was going to be in this outfit for long anyways. Looking back towards Sarah who was as smug as ever at what she had done Roy began to open her mouth to angrily protest but Sarah cut her off cold. Grabbing her keys and the device on the kitchen counter with a big smile Sarah quickly blurted out “Oh Sarah I’m so happy that you and Jack are getting along so well and your love is blossoming for each other but I have to run or I’ll be late for work, we’ll talk later, see ya” and she ran out the door closing it behind her before you could even mutter a peep.</p>
