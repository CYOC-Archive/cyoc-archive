<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Eventually Matt found himself in the light again, as his box was opened and the same two men lifted him up and began taking him wherever his final destination was. He idly watched the world go by as they carried him into some sort of building, not that he was capable of doing anything else. This continued until he was placed into some sort of glass case and was positioned upright, next to his charger stand which had apparently been brought with him. He then felt the men fiddle with him even more, his hand being moved away from his ass and wrapped around his cock instead, then finally he was lifted up and violently thrust onto his stand.<br />
<br />
It was like coming back to life, feeling the power surge through him and bring his mind out of its hibernation. Having full access to all of his senses felt amazing, being able to see, hear, and most importantly of all touch. Oh god the feeling of touch, he thought as the power flooded his asshole, making him feel like he was experiencing repeated orgasms in his ass. At least something was working properly, he thought as he stood there and let the charger do his thing. The charger fed constant pulses of electricity into his body, making him feel alive again and letting him feel untold pleasure in the process. Man, eating never felt this good, being a robot is so much better than being human was, Matt thought, completely oblivious to his current situation.<br />
<br />
A part of his mind tried to remind him that, nice as this was he was still immobile and apparently trapped in some sort of display case. The part of his mind that wanted to remain in mindless arousal was still dominant however, particularly when he realised that his hand that had been wrapped around his dildo-cock was giving him all the sensations of masturbation as well. It felt like both his ass and cock were on fire, and the warm sensation was beginning to spread throughout the rest of his body. The part of his mind screaming increasingly desperately about escape could hardly compete against such sensations; why the hell would he want to escape this, his libido-dominated brain wondered.<br />
<br />
So Matt stood there fixed to his pole, largely without the inclination to move even if he could, until something finally came along to interrupt his mindless pleasure session. That something was a young blond guy, dressed in some sort of uniform, who Matt suddenly discovered was standing in front of him. He was actually pretty cute, Matt thought through his lust fueled haze, he&#39;d probably fuck him if he ever got out of here. The guy cleared his throat and looked down at the clipboard he was carrying, before launching into some sort of speech.<br />
&quot;New product, current designation sexdoll #087, former designation...Matt. Yup, looks like that&#39;s you...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sexdoll!? Matt would have burst out in outrage of he could. Yeah, he&#39;d designed himself to be the perfect sex machine but he was so much more than that... Though in his current state he couldn&#39;t exactly make his views known and the man continued regardless of what he might think.<br />
<br />
“You&#39;ve probably got a lot of questions right now, but happily you&#39;re not in a position to ask them. Well, happily for me, sure makes my job a lot easier.” The man smirked and went on. “But anyway, Chronivac Inc. has prepared this standard orientation to prepare you for your new life as a product.”<br />
<br />
Matt had a sinking feeling bringing him down from his earlier high, even if the vibration in his ass was doing its best to make him forget his worries. It was nice, but not quite nice enough to make Matt content with the prospect of being some... object for the rest of his life. Though some treacherous part of his mind was wondering just how bad it could be- if he was to function as a sexdoll he could expect to feel this pleasure a lot more. The man went on, apparently oblivious to Matt&#39;s inner turmoil.<br />
<br />
&quot;So there&#39;s a bunch of legal detail here which you don&#39;t need to know, the short version is that when you used the Chronivac you agreed to sign yourself over to Chronivac Inc. if any mishaps occured. Which they... did, I guess. Not that you need me to tell you that. So basically you&#39;re now our property, and we have the legal right to dispose of you as we wish. You&#39;re going to be put on display on our shop here, until we find an owner we can sell you to. Now I know what you would say, well if you could I guess, blah blah &#39;I&#39;m a person, you can&#39;t do this to me etc. etc.&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt was in fact preparing objections along those lines in his head, and was a bit put out to be shot down so pre-emptively. He felt like he was at a bit of a disadvantage in this whole conversation really, as he wasn&#39;t able to respond in any way. That, plus the fact that he was being forced to stand naked, dick in hand in front of this guy left Matt feeling pretty embarrassed about the whole situation. Though this seemed to be exactly the way the guy wanted it, he was showing every sign of satisfaction with the situation.<br />
<br />
“But the fact is, we can do this to you. You might still look like a human, unlike those poor fuckers over there.” The guy gestured at the aisle before him, which appeared to be entirely full of jockstraps. “But the fact is you&#39;re not a person any more. You&#39;re an object, our object, so we can and will do whatever we want with you.<br />
<br />
My advice? You&#39;re not getting out of this, so just accept it. Tormenting yourself with thoughts of becoming a human again is just going to make yourself miserable, you&#39;re much better off learning to enjoy life as an object. Hell, looking at you I&#39;d say you&#39;re in for a pretty fun time, and if you designed yourself to be like this I bet you&#39;re the kind of kinky fucker who&#39;ll enjoy it. Oh and don&#39;t worry, we&#39;re good at matching our products with the right owner so we&#39;ll find someone who&#39;ll really know how to use you.&quot; He winked and walked off.<br />
<br />
Matt tried to call out to the man, anything to get him to stay, but immediately realised it was hopeless. Damn it. If that guy was right then they did seem to have him by the balls. He quickly checked his system, just in case there was a backdoor they&#39;d missed, but they&#39;d done a pretty thorough job of locking him out of any movement functions. He didn&#39;t even have wi-fi any more.<br />
<br />
He wasn&#39;t going to listen to that guy and resign himself to being a thing forever, even if he felt nice right now he wasn&#39;t exactly ready to submit to an existence of servitude. However it looked like there was no point fighting it for now, he couldn&#39;t even move his eyes so he wasn&#39;t getting anywhere under his own power, and he didn&#39;t think anyone in this place was about to life a finger for him.<br />
<br />
 At least he had the wonderful, wonderful orgasms to make this undignified captivity somewhat more bearable. Not that he had much choice in the matter, but Matt decided to wait for someone to buy him, hoping that being taken out of this damned case would give him a better opportunity of escape. (Or at least a better opportunity for some sex, the treacherous lustful part of his mind thought). Either way, all he could do now was wait for a buyer...</p>
