<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Absently swivelling the chair back and forth, Jeff weighed whether he wanted wait or try his prank. Reaching out, he began to idly fool with the Chronivac programme. Discovering that any age reduction was not permanent so long as the time period was altered, he jumped the age forward and learned that it was possible to become older if he wanted to. Clicking on a couple icons, he began to create a saved profile of a sixteen-year-old girl with B cup breasts, a height of five-foot-two, and a weight of a hundred and nine pounds.<br />
<br />
Suddenly realising that at some point he must of subconsciously made his decision, Jeff sat back and stared at the computer screen. Asking himself, &quot;Can I really do this? Will it be believable?&quot; he clicked on a couple more things, studying the choices available, not understanding some of them, like if the saved profile would use pads or tampons, which he thought must be the same thing and so hit the check box for tampons.<br />
<br />
After making a couple changes, updating some things and adding a bit more, Jeff saved and backed out. Studying the information displayed about himself, he questioned whether the device could actually do what it said. Scrolling through the various options, he decided to test it. Finding what he thought was the easiest thing to alter about himself, he quickly removed all traces of his body hair, thinned his eyebrows and, after debating a moment whether he should, decided to leave the hair on his head the way it was. Leaving the timer at zero and setting it so that the changes would remain in placed until he reverted them back to the default, he hit the button to send the information to the remote.<br />
<br />
Still not quite convinced, he glanced down at the screen and held his finger above the enter key. After a moment, he muttered, &quot;Either nothing will happen or something will. And if I don&#39;t like it, I can always change it back,&quot; and reaching out he pressed the enter key.<br />
<br />
Instantly, the screen went blank and a message appeared. Reading, &quot;You have selected single use. Make sure there is nobody within line-of-sight before beginning change,&quot; Jeff wondered what this meant before clicking on the screen the confirm option.<br />
<br />
The screen going blank instantly after it had scanned his thumb print, then resetting back to the default of showing information on him, Jeff wondered if there was something he was supposed to feel and if something went wrong. Looking down, he squawked in surprise when he found himself staring at bare legs. Running a hand over his now de-haired legs, Jeff thought, &quot;It worked,&quot; incredulously as he pulled on his tank top and peered down at his now hairless chest. Lifting his arms, he studied his bare armpits, still trying to wrap his mind around that the Chronivac actually did what it said it could. Turning his attention back to the computer, Jeff grinned and pulled up the save profile.<br />
<br />
Quickly going to work, he gave her the name Jessica Kaylon, kept the date the same and added a couple more bits of information, including that she had an extensive knowledge of cheerleading, had experience in gymnastics and ballet, made sure his awareness was that of Jeff Kaylon, as he found it disturbing that his mind would go completely female and this girl would take over, and, after a bit, added that he could follow conversations and automatically responded and act like a normal sixteen-year-old girl, even if he still had the mind of an eighteen-year-old boy. Finishing, it came to him he should check and make sure the coach at the high school was holding squad tryouts and minimising the programme, he pulled up the web-browser.<br />
<br />
Within minutes, he had the information he was searching for and reading that tryouts had been on the twentieth, a little over a week ago, Jeff cursed and sat back. Realising he would have to set the date on the Chronivac back from the twenty ninth of July to the twentieth, he asked himself, &quot;Is it worth it? All for a prank you thought up some time ago?&quot; and thinking about the couple cheerleaders he&#39;d seen, the one he&#39;d asked to the prom, who&#39;d turned him down, and the way they acted, he spun the desk chair and shut his eyes as he felt it spin about.<br />
<br />
His mind wandering as he tried to consider what he was about to do from all possible angles and after some time, he opened his eyes, adjusted the chair so he was facing the computer and reached for the mouse. Reasoning that losing a week wouldn&#39;t be so bad, Jeff muttered, &quot;It&#39;s not like I am turning the clock back a number of years,&quot; and clicking on the time icon, he set the limit so that there was no time limit and that he&#39;d chose when to change back and hesitating for a moment, he breathed evenly before clicking on the option for the date. Setting it back, he double-tapped the save icon before he could change his mind and sent the information to the remote. Looking at the screen on the transmitter, he read, &quot;For optimum performance make sure antenna is aimed at you,&quot; and making sure it was and that the remote was on a flat surface, Jeff took a deep breath, reached out and hit the confirm button.<br />
<br />
At first, he again thought that nothing would happen. Standing in front of his desk, staring down at the transmitter, waiting, he eventually groused, &quot;Load of horseshit. Probably cannot even change,&quot; but stopped when he felt something tickling his shoulder. Grasping at it, he felt something yank at his hair and as something tickled his forehead, then his cheek, he gave a start when he realised that his hair was now down past his shoulders.<br />
<br />
Overwhelmed by how soft his hair felt, Jeff marvelled at it for a moment before glancing down. Wondering what would change next, he felt a twinge of some discomfort in his abdomen and groin. Trying to shrug it off, he grimaced when it happened again, then promptly doubled over in pain. Feeling like something warm was growing up and into his body, starting at the area exactly in the middle between his legs, Jeff gasped as what felt like a hand pull down on his dick and nuts. Squeezing his eyes shut, tears starting to sprout at the corners, he gripped the desk as the pain grew and vaguely understanding that it was somehow connected to his privates shifting sex and gender, he reached out with his other hand and rubbed at his chest, which had started to itch.<br />
<br />
The sore and tender feeling growing, whilst the discomfort in his groin and lower abdomen refused to diminish,  Jeff managed to open his eyes. Trying to look down, he gasped as he watched his chest push outward and before his eyes, four years of growth blossomed as he developed a pair of pert B cup breasts. The pain starting to fade, Jeff saw that his tank top was starting to lengthen and hug his body. Understanding coming to him that it was changing into a dress, he wondered why his clothing was changing as the bodice of the dress hugged his torso tightly, amplifying the right areas, whilst the skirt stopped a couple inches short of his knees. And as his shorts disappeared and something wrapped itself firmly, but comfortably around his crotch, Jeff slowly stood, shifted as his sneakers transformed into a pair of strappy-high-heels that had a two-inch heel and gazing downward, he found himself in awe that it had worked.<br />
<br />
Curiously peering at his hands, which were small and delicate looking, he giggled and ran them up and down the side of the dress, liking how the soft cotton fabric felt. Wanting suddenly a mirror, Jeff turned away from his desk and nearly fell over as he tried to take a step. Finding he didn&#39;t know how to walk in high-heels, he questioned whether he should add more knowledge as he mumbled, &quot;After all. You are essentially nothing more than an eighteen-year-old dude in the body or a sixteen-year-old girl, with only the knowledge in gymnastics, ballet and cheerleading.&quot;<br />
<br />
The sound of his voice stopping him, Jeff grinned and trilled out, &quot;I am Jessica Kaylon. I am sixteen and I like cheerleading. And boys, which doesn&#39;t make me gay,&quot; and really liking how his voice sounded, he, now she, tried to think of herself in the female pronouns as she realised that somethings about her mind had changed, such as her sexual preference and her extensive knowledge in the three areas she programme in.<br />
<br />
As she did this, Jessica practiced walking back and forth a couple times, but stopped when she noticed something off. Glancing about, it came to her that her room had morphed and was now a teenage girl&#39;s bedroom with whitish-pink walls, posters of boy bands and cute boys pinned up on the way, a comforter that was white and had pastel pink, purple, green and blue hearts on it covering the bed, a vanity and, among other things, a full-body mirror. Starting to step closer to it, curious to know what she looked like, Jessica stopped when she saw the computer. Remembering the cheerleader tryouts, she changed course and headed for the desk, stumbling only once or twice. Pulling back up the information, she read where they were being held, what time, she checked the computer and discovered she had about two hours, and what was expected to be brought, mostly a consent form from the a parent, which she saw sitting nearby, a pair of spandex shorts or a leggings, an appropriate top or sports bra, and hygiene stuff, as all girls had to shower before and after tryouts.<br />
<br />
Slowly going back over everything, making sure she had all the information, she eventually picked up the form and wondered how it had gotten there. Thinking it must had formed when the rest of the room transformed, she turned away from and started toward her dresser, but stopped in front of her mirror. Peering at her reflection, her male mind thinking that she was very pretty, Jessica studied her soft, long, brown hair that felt past her shoulders, curling at the ends, the white dress that had thin straps going over her shoulders, the way it hugged her boobs, which she soon discovered that she was wearing a strapless bra, and idly playing with the edge of the dress, liking the way it tickled and rubbed against her legs, she lifted it up and stared at the her underwear. Having never seen a thong, she didn&#39;t know this was what she was wearing, as she studied the small triangle-shaped cut of fabric in front that barely covered anything, the way it rode high on her hips, and how it only managed to cover her butt crack. Wanting to take a look at how it covered her privates, she resisted the urge and instead let go of the fabric.<br />
<br />
Suddenly feeling awkward, Jeff stepped back a couple steps. Putting a hand over his mouth, he reassured himself by uttering, &quot;You can do this. You look like a girl. You sound like a girl. You probably smell like one. Just take things one step at a time, get to tryouts, have some fun, then change back,&quot; and taking a couple deep breathes, finding them to be calling, Jessica turned to the dresser, where she collected a pair of black leggings and what her mind assured her was a sports bra, as she&#39;d worn them also for gymnastics.</p>
