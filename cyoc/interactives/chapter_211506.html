<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Before Greg can decide, Mr. Osborne comes walking up to him and Tyler, “okay boys,” he says, “class is over,” he then looks at Greg and adds, “Greg, since the paint is still pretty fresh, I&#39;d suggest you leave your car overnight.”<br />
<br />
“Um...,” Greg starts, “I&#39;d rather prefer to take it with me.”<br />
<br />
“I understand,” Mr. Osborne says, “it is your first car and you are anxious that something might happen to it, right?”<br />
<br />
Greg nods, “ye-yeah,” he says, in truth, the thought of leaving his brother alone and stuck as a car for a night, does not feel right to him.<br />
<br />
“Listen,” Mr. Osborne says, “I promise nothing and no one will touch your car. I just think it would be for the best, so that the paint can dry properly and not get smudged and destroyed with dirt.”<br />
<br />
Greg thinks about it for a while, he then sighs, “I guess you are right, sir,” he says, “I guess it&#39;ll be okay to leave it here for a night.”<br />
<br />
Mr. Osborne nods and smiles, “it&#39;ll be fine,” he says, “now get to your next classes, Greg, you can put the keys in the key-box by the door.”<br />
<br />
“Sir,” Greg says, “I&#39;d rather take the keys with me.”<br />
<br />
“Don&#39;t worry,” the teacher says, “I have the only key to the key-box, so no one is able to get at them.”<br />
<br />
“O-okay,” Greg replies and hands the keys over to the teacher, who walks up to the box, puts the keys, which are Jeff&#39;s balls, inside and locks them in.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, around 65 miles from Greg&#39;s hometown, in the middle of nowhere and surrounded by a dense forest, is a lunatic asylum. A man, wearing a white T-Shirt, blue Jeans and white Socks is sitting in his room, staring out the window. The man, who is named “Henry Powers”, is a 35-year-old with an athletic built, short blond hair and brown eyes. The reason he is in this Asylum is because he conducted strange and illegal experiments on animals, others would call him “the mad scientist”.<br />
<br />
Henry has been in the Asylum for a half a year, in that time he tried to escape on numerous occasions, but failed every time. Today however, he WILL escape: the man stumbled across the Chronivac-App, while surfing the internet on his phone. After reading about what the App is supposedly capable of doing, Henry did not hesitate and installed the App on his phone. He then did a small test on himself, changing his hair color from blond to blue. He then started to come up with a fool-proof-plan to escape: he&#39;d pack all of his belongings, which simply were the clothes he is wearing right now and his phone, into his pillow case. Henry would tie the “sack” to a rope made from his bed sheets and lower it out his window. His window has bars, the bars are so tight, that a person would be unable to fit through, but a bird, the size of a small eagle, defiantly would be able to. Once he would have transformed into the bird, Henry would squeeze through the bars and once airborne, make a U-turn, grab his “bag” and flew off. The windows in the Asylum are able to be opened wide by the patients, because of the bars, the personal finds it unnecessary to secure the windows.<br />
<br />
Henry waits until 10pm, that is when the “guard” comes and checks on the “patients” and when “lights out” is called. After the guard has left, and the whole Asylum turns dark, Henry waits another hour before quietly slipping out of bed. The man strips out of his clothes and stuffs them into the pillowcase, once naked, he opens the App on his phone and selects the transformation.<br />
<br />
Henry feels a tingle run through his body, he puts his phone into the pillowcase and quickly ties the make-shift rope to it and lowers it out the window, he then waits. First, he feels himself shrinking, soon he is no taller than 25 inches. The man chuckles, “man, I really have gotten small,” he chuckles, he then feels his legs and feet change, his toes lengthen and become talons. Henry grins, “he... I really could do some damage with these claws,” he mumbles to himself. He then feels his whole body start to itch, while his hands and arms start to change into wings, as weathers start to sprout from his body. His head is the last to change, his nose merges with his upper lip as his mouth becomes a beak, soon a medium-sized eagle is standing in the room.<br />
<br />
Henry had left the window wide open, with a few strong flaps with his wings, he jumps up on to the windowsill, he then wriggles himself through the bars. His window is on the fourth floor, so the eagle lets himself fall and spreads its wings, after a few flaps he is flying through the night sky. Henry makes a U-turn and aims for his bag of stuff, he gets his talons ready and lands on the sack, using his beak, Henry shreds the sheet. Henry is then pulled down, due to the added weight, but with a few strong flaps of his wings, he manages to catch himself and soon is flying across the skies towards the lights of a town in the distance.<br />
<br />
The “Eagle” has to stop a couple of times for a rest, &#39;man, who knew flying could be so straining, especially with this extra weight,&#39; Henry thinks to himself. Henry had set the duration of his transformation to last two hours, &#39;I should arrive in 30 Minutes,&#39; he thinks to himself, &#39;better get going.&#39;<br />
<br />
After 30 minutes, Henry arrives in the town, he flies over the houses and searches for an ideal place to land, transform back and think of how to proceed. It does not take long for Henry to spot a huge building, thanks to his sharp vision, when he flies closer, he recognizes the building to be a High school. After circling for a while, he spots a small building and decides it would do to hide out for a few hours.<br />
<br />
Henry lands behind the building, all is quiet and dark, and waits for the transformation to end. Once Henry is back to being himself, he quickly gets dressed and, using a thin metal string he found on the ground nearby, starts to pick at the lock. The man manages to open the door and slips inside, after closing the door, Henry takes out his phone and turns on the flashlight, after his eyes got used to the darkness, he notices that he is in a garage.<br />
<br />
He notices a Jeep Wrangler in the center of the garage, walking up closer the man can smell the fresh paint, “I guess this is the chop-shop of the school,” the man says to himself. Henry walks around the Jeep, “this vehicle would be great to get around with,” he mumbles to himself, “I could use the App to copy the Vehicle&#39;s look and transform something else into a copy of the Jeep. I&#39;d then drive off with the original, and no one will be any wiser!”<br />
<br />
Henry is unaware that the Jeep is really a human, and Jeff himself is unaware of what is happening since he is in sleep-mode and will only awaken or at least be aware if the keys are in the ignition.</p>
