<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;HEY MAN! LETS PARTY!&quot; Tommy bellowed. &quot;IF  THERE ARE ANY FAGGOTS HERE! WE DONT GIVE A FUCK!&quot;<br />
<br />
Marion rolled his eyes at the lame frat boy comment Tommy gave, that jock was always a party crasher more often than he was invited to one , with an influence that causes more people to follow in his example. Sure he would normally be turned on by a loud boisterous beast, but he was in the mood for foreign men for today.<br />
<br />
He disliked the clubs he went to, being mistreated by their own drama. He didn&#39;t feel anything as he left for other things, with the only regret of not leaving those clubs earlier. He hoped that other clubs, aside from those he&#39;s joined, aren&#39;t like that. <br />
<br />
But regardless, most clubs generally only picked freshmen to become exco members in the future. &quot;Oh well&quot; he thought, he had to be fine with just being a regular member then.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Mathias, your leader for today! Nice to meet you!&quot; The man spoke with a heavy accent, yet depicting himself with a light hearted personality. He was the leader of the group , and boy was he foreign and hot!<br />
<br />
Dressed in his club&#39;s apparel , coupled with a pair of jeans that enhances his look. Tannish yellowy hue blessed his eastern skin along with the fact that he&#39;s over 6ft 2. The third year college junior smiled gingerly.<br />
<br />
Long decently muscled arms as well as lean muscle coupled around his body and can be imagined on his legs, to show he did his daily jogging and running. Rectangular face, small puppy dog eyes, and neat combed back black hair. The Hokkien hottie smiled eagerly at the entire team, including himself.<br />
<br />
Marion sandwiched his growing member between his legs, hiding it in his green trousers, and stared at the guy, being way shorter than the guy and not even close to being as athletic or as fit as him. He was a performer, a singer and an actor, and although he didn&#39;t know dancing that much he was ready to learn.<br />
<br />
The sophomore hated his rich parents, insisting that he continued studying and never helped him find lessons to learn dancing. But that was about to change, he was going to be more independent without them, he didn&#39;t need their money!<br />
<br />
He tried to distract his anger from them, crossing his arms over his expensive long sleeved shirt. Moderate sized feet donning a pair of loafers. His eyes hid behind trendy glasses, pale skin, and his cute face was topped with blonde-dyed coif, donning that hipster look.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sian! Take so long to load! Haha!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up la Mata Mata!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Haha! Take any longer and I&#39;ll catch you and put you in jail!&quot;<br />
<br />
The hipster teen wondered, not quite understanding the joke. He shrugged momentarily, before suddenly-randomly recalling that &quot;Mata&quot; was Police in Hokkien, suddenly that dawned upon him as he felt a strange new taste gasping out of his mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmmmmhaha...!&quot; He giggled somewhat, feeling his refined tastes drop. Developing a lower sense of humor as he chucked at the joke, being able to have fun at simpler things, at lame jokes, and jocks such as them.<br />
<br />
---FLICK! WELCOME TO WORLD NETWORKING CLUB!!!!----<br />
<br />
&quot;Wahhhhhhh.....&quot; Matthias stared at the monitor, eyes completely, as the slide show flicked one by one, showing the photos they have taken off their members.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chio sia...&quot;<br />
<br />
Marion directed his head to the left , noticing the Exco member looking all relaxed, mouth forming an &quot;O&quot; like he is so amazed at the clips being shown, with comments directed specifically at the ones with young females in them.<br />
<br />
Sigh, Marion knew that the guy was definitely straight . It was okay, he supposed . Matthias&#39;s boner was throbbing vigorously in the pants he wore, Marion liked that, as his began throbbing while being focused at the man to the right of him--<br />
<br />
&quot;Wahhhhhhh....!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Marion jolted back to the screen at Matthias&#39;s fanboying over them pics. Them still showing the same old slideshow with more captivating...pictures .As though...they had a quality to them that he couldn&#39;t have appreciated earlier.<br />
<br />
Marion tried to avert his eyes away from the screen, trying to avoid the hypnotic trance it was getting to him and enjoy the fondness of a man&#39;s boner...yet the only boner he ever looked at was his own. Any memory of other muscles invading his fantasy space felt like it was non existent, like looking at the man next to him was just &quot;fine&quot; , it just didn&#39;t give him any pleasure . Well... especially not in the way that boobs could do to him.<br />
<br />
This time, Marion felt like his eyes couldn&#39;t pry off the screen. Like he didn&#39;t want to, as though he enjoyed what it showed very much, feeling.  He stretched his legs and sunk down in his chair, feeling more at home as his eyes were directed at the cute girls that appeared on screen. So sexy sia...<br />
<br />
His legs overtook the entire floor space around him, stretching long and flexible as they felt like they could be perform some sick moves if he wanted to. <br />
<br />
Feet tapping, memorising some movements as they tapped nicely to a beat, loafers degrading themselves to bright red sports sneakers, being more flexible and ready for a workout. Expanding nicely to fit his musically inclined feet.<br />
<br />
Pants morphing into a more typical material, a pair that was affordable yet good, hugging his crotch as his was wide open, like the man next to him...like the man next to him...<br />
<br />
His mind was overwhelmed with enjoyment and excitement with this new foreign experience...but...a part of him that yearned for men, Matthias , still existed...as it continued to degrade in lust into pure brotherhood.<br />
<br />
&quot;He my bro la, Matthias. We in the brothership lah! We ain&#39;t no gay faggot for fuck. Understand hor.&quot; His mind sarcastically reminded him, as his taste buds began to accentuate themselves to Asian delights from their home country.<br />
<br />
What&#39;s gay? Not him for sure. He felt his boner proudly acknowledging that fact that he was incredibly turned on by the sight of the lovely girls of different nationalities being shown on the screen. Being the younger brother of the Hokkien teen , with the traditional looking parents as well as growing up in their culture. What can be better way to live your life? <br />
<br />
Almost as though as he appreciated that, he was given his very own nationality, coupled with all their phrases and dialogues, accents and mannerisms, thoughts and their pride for their own heritage. Skin roughening slightly, as a result of being exposed to the sun more often, becoming tanned with yellowish Asian hue.<br />
<br />
Chiobu...They&#39;re chiobu...<br />
<br />
&quot;Chio...&quot; He muttered, feeling his boner pop to full mast as the video gallery continued playing on. Filled with pretty and cute girls posing for the camera, suddenly appreciating the fact there were more girl than guy freshies in the club.<br />
<br />
He felt his fingers clutching shiftily , as though as they&#39;re feeling and experiencing the thought of boobs on their tips. Hands roughening ever so slightly due to lifting weights on occasion. Arms swelling due to working out often, thickening with a decent amount of muscle mass appropriate for a college junior, wanting to impress the girls in the school.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chio...!!!!&quot; Both of them said in unison , with overall enthusiasm. The rest of the hall not caring, like it was natural behavior for men to ogle over girls, like it was expected that both guys were without a doubt, heterosexual . Any suspicions on one being gay or even bisexual were thrown out the corner, they were straight as an arrow, and proud of it.<br />
<br />
--BEEP!--<br />
<br />
&quot;Wah Lau Eh!!!&quot; The two men groaned in unison , crossed their arms while still keeping the smile on their faces. Younger Brother imitating the other&#39;s movements telepathically, like twins.<br />
<br />
Body Aging itself up about year or two, feeling as tough washboard abs poked underneath his shirt, along with a pair of fit pecs sporting underneath. Stretching to be as tall as Matthias, they&#39;ve always played Basketball and danced together during their spare time, it was understandable.<br />
<br />
Hair bringing itself nicely to a college boy combed over, dye free, he used a free hand and felt the nice simple strands of hair that laid in his genetics, with a newfound love for his family .Knowing that they would not approve him and his twin to dye their hair, as it would be disrespectful. Obeying the rule, while maintaining the sides short, he was a proud Asian man like his bro, and quite handsome as a matter of fact.<br />
<br />
Both Asians stared at one another&#39;s crotch and smirked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You gay for me or something bro?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hahaha! No la! You&#39;re the gay faggot!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hahaha!&quot; It was a joke, the two were obviously straight enough to make it. Homophobic but who cares, come to Asia then they&#39;ll know! His eyes diminished, becoming smaller as his wide venture, world dreams started to disappear, replaced with only the want to make his parents proud.<br />
<br />
A brand new collar and two buttons plastifying, as they unbutton themselves and shredded away the sleeves so that it could fit into nice polo shirt that hugged his larger, testosterone filled build more nicely. <br />
<br />
A sense of pride surged within him, feeling more confident in what he&#39;s wearing and how he looks to the other students and adults, like he&#39;s not afraid to show who he really is to them. Body rubbing about wildly, as the final changes began taking place, his face squinting as they hit his face strongly. <br />
<br />
Body stopped itching, having adjusted to wearing cheap clothing , relishing in the comfort and familiarity of it. Manliness donned over him as his jaw man-ed out, a bit of wear and tear from the weather but that gives him a tougher experience than his bro, roughening out slightly , nose broadening and cheek bones rising, as the fake glasses disappeared like it was an insult to him, not all Asians needed specs, especially not a charmer like him.<br />
<br />
Much preferred over more expensive clothes with richer threads , they just didn&#39;t feel right on him , he couldn&#39;t afford them anyway. Plus, Polo and sports shirts make him look &quot;more man&quot; . He didn&#39;t like wearing anything long sleeved as it would construct his movements, and didn&#39;t show off his guns.<br />
<br />
With that being said, it&#39;s material turning into a mass-produced cheap cotton, supplied and funded by the school&#39;s subsidies. The club logo sewed itself onto his breast pocket, a logo of a globe with fancy additions surrounding it. It dyed itself grey, with the polo shirt bleaching itself a plain white. A small silver men&#39;s watched wrapped itself over his left wrist, his club gave to him so that they could identify the two twins apart, it representing masculinity due to his stronger beliefs in heterosexuality and brothership. Without a doubt, the only kind of pride Marvin had. A pride in being a man and a leader in his club.<br />
<br />
&quot;Li Yang! Mata! Your segment is up!&quot; The President called out. The identical twins happily to oblige. Mata-his roommate having a sense of familiarity in the dance, while Li Yang-Martin despite having experience, felt this newness like never before, which made his movements outshine his twin brother by abit for today.<br />
<br />
Generally people call him by his Chinese-Hokkien name , Wen Li Yang. Wen being the family name, representing his manlihood and Asian pride, Li representing his strength , power and dedication, and Yang representing his radiance and cheerfulness. Without a doubt, Marvin definitely fits the destiny he was born into.<br />
<br />
The crowd goes wild with excitement at the twins lead, they were identical so they were always judge as a pair. Though this time, someone noticed Marvin&#39;s slightly better performance than his bro&#39;s, it was a girl sitting at the front seat, who never once gazed to his bro on the right. He knew it was time to make his move.<br />
<br />
Marvin walked up to the girl sitting in the front and sat next to her, secretly admiring her small, petite physique , and her smooth locks covering up her face. He knew he could score with her, as he turned to the right and gave a genuine smile, shedding the nice guy demeanour a bit in exchange for some cute sexiness.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Hey! I&#39;m Marvin! Nice to meet you~!&quot;<br />
<br />
The two of them haven&#39;t stopped talking to one another since the start of their conversation.</p>
