<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">They woke up just as the sun was setting, still in each other&#39;s arms.  They went over to the stream and clean each other off.  After the got dressed, they headed back.  When they got to the spot where they ran into each other, they paused. At the same time they said &quot;So when can I see you again?&quot;  They laughed for a moment and them Ahote pulled a black sharpie and grabbed Jae&#39;s arm and wrote his phone number and address.  He gave it to Jae who did the same thing .  Ahote kissed Jae on the lips and said &quot;I hope I see you sooner rather than later.&quot; Emphasizing sooner before he boarded away.<br />
<br />
Jae skated home deep in thought.  Ahote reminded him of someone but he couldn&#39;t remember who.  In his mind&#39;s eye, he could see the shape of the person but no features.  He remembered crying earlier but couldn&#39;t remember why.  When he got home he saw Kai passed out on solomon&#39;s lap while watching Catfish in mtv.  Without opening his eyes Kai mumbled &quot;hey big bro, there&#39;s pizza on the table.&quot; Jae chuckled.  He grab a couple slices and headed up to his room.  <br />
<br />
When he got there the screen on his computer was flashing red.  When he clicked maker to see what the error was it &quot;Error 13mgr - two files have been corrupted and are in the process of merging.  Data may be lost.&quot;  He went to the help section to see how to fix it.  It didn&#39;t tell him how to see what was merging or how it happened.  It sent him to website to download a fix.  Jae clicked to start the download.  Because of the size, it estimated download time within 24 hours.  He closed out of the help file, missing the part that said the fix would stop the merge error but couldn&#39;t guarantee reversing the merge.<br />
<br />
Jae jumped in the shower quickly before returning to his room. He lay in the bed in just a pair of boxers.  He put his hands behind his head and stared at the ceiling.  He couldn&#39;t figure out why he couldn&#39;t make out the image in his head.  He then thought about his day with Ahote and it made him smile.  There was something about him that was so familiar  and comforting.  He looked at his forearm and smiled.  It was 10pm and a Friday night.  Jae got up and put on some basketball shorts and a tank top.  He made his way downstairs and heard a loud moan.  When he walked into the living room he saw Kai trying to look innocent and Solomon wiping his mouth, looking very satisfied with himself. Jae rolled his eye saying &quot;really?&quot;  He grabbed his board and headed to the address on his arm.<br />
<br />
When he got to the address he couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that he had been here before. He saw one of the second floor lights on, partially concealed by tree.  He considered going home until he saw someone with long hair walk by.  He walked to the tree, having to jump to reach the lowest branch.  He then easily pulled himself and made his way to the window.  He peered in and saw Ahote lying bed, wearing just a pair of sweatpants reading.  He tapped on the window and waved.  Ahote looked over and his expression changed to one have surprise.  He opened the screen on the window and motioned for Jae to come in.<br />
Jae looked a bit anxious and said &quot;hey...so ummm I know the rule is you&#39;re supposed to wait a day or two before contacting someone...but I don&#39;t really follow that crap and I believe if you like someone you should be up front and say that you li..&quot;  Ahote stopped him by kissing him.  Jae pulled him in close, wrapping his arms around Ahote.  <br />
Ahote blushed  &quot;I didn&#39;t mean to interrupt but I really wanted to make sure you understand my feelings about you.&quot;<br />
They  sat on his bed for a while talking.  Eventually they were laying on their sides, heads propped up with the arm, just talking and getting to know each other.  Around 230 in the morning, Jae started to yawn and started to get up, looking toward the window.  Ahote grabbed the part if the tank top that went over Jae&#39;s broad shoulders and pulled him back down, ripping the shirt in the process.  &quot;Where do you think you&#39;re going mister?&quot;<br />
&quot;I was gonna head home because you look tired and it&#39;s late.&quot; Jae said<br />
&quot;Uh uh...with the way you&#39;ve been yawning and how heavy your eyes look, if I let you go and something happened to you, I wouldn&#39;t be able to forgive myself.  Stay.&quot;  Ahote said, &quot;Pleeease?&quot;<br />
&quot;Anything for you babe.&quot; Jae grinned kissing him.  Jae laid down on his back.  Ahote placed his arm under Jae&#39;s head while resting his hand on his chest and his head on Jae&#39;s pec.  He then wrapped his leg across Jae&#39;s.  Jae entwined his legs with Ahote&#39;s as he ran his fingers through Ahote&#39;s long hair.<br />
That night, Jae dreamt if the shape.  Right before he woke up be the face of Korean American, same age as him, and they were together and happy.  Ahote had a similar dream but on his dream he saw Jae and the Korean walking away as he faded away.  When Jae opened his eyes, he felt Ahote&#39;s hard cock pressed against his leg and Ahote&#39;s hand resting on Jae&#39;s hard cock.  He also noticed that somehow they both ended up naked. Ahote looked so peaceful as he slept.  There was even a small smile.  Jae saw the time and it was only 7.  He pulled Ahote a little closer and fell back asleep.  <br />
Several hours later Ahote let out a loud scream, startling Jae awake. Jae sat up and pulled Ahote close, beads of sweat had formed in his face.  Jae cradled him in his arms, reassuring Ahote it was just a dream.  Ahote looked up at him and Jae saw how scared he looked.  He asked what happened.  Ahote clung to him tightly and told him of the dream he had.  Of Jae letting him go and leaving with a figure who he couldn&#39;t make out, except for the end.  He described what this person looked like in detail and how when Jae left, he could feel himself disappear, not just be invisible, like he never existed.  He looked to Jae who stared at him in disbelief and then told him about his similar dream with the person.<br />
&quot;I guess we&#39;re connected.&quot; Ahote said.<br />
Jae hugged him &quot;I&#39;m glad we&#39;re connected.  I won&#39;t let anything happen to you.&quot;<br />
Ahote kissed Jae and in a matter if 2 second He then turned his body and grabbed Jae&#39;s cock in his hand.  He then ran his lips over his head and down and around the shaft, before he opened his mouth and greedily sucked on the head.  Jae changed his position ever so slightly and just enveloped Ahote&#39;s huge cock in his mouth.  He then licked Ahote&#39;s balls, gently taking in his mouth as his jerked off his cock.  This nearly sent Ahote over the edge.  He started to suck with more intensity, which caused Jae to do the same.  The both bobbed their heads up and down even fast.  They started to feel each other&#39;s bodies tense. Ahote put his hand on Jae&#39;s free hand and clasped it.  Ahote came first, Jae swallowing every drop and right after Jae came.  He crawled to Ahote, smiled and said &quot;you taste good&quot; which made them both laugh as they kissed. Out of the corner of his eye, Jae noticed a red error in Ahote&#39;s computer, similar to his...</p>
