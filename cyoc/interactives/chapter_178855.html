<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mr. Mendez look at Ric&#39;s body and remembered when he met Marco for the first time during his childhood. Thinking about the small boy who became into the hot Marco makes Francisco wonders how Ric will look as an adult. So he decided to try a spell that would make Ric as old as him.<br />
<br />
Mr. Mendez walked over to Ric and whispered the spell in his ear. And soon Ric had begun shaking and rolling from side to side again. But the spell didn&#39;t begin until he laid completely flat. Not moving as much anymore, Ric&#39;s ass began changing first. His ass began to plump as it squeezed and expanded. Soon Ric&#39;s ass had grown so big it was lifting the rest of his undeveloped body.<br />
<br />
Soon however the changes continued. Ric&#39;s sparse pubes spread forming a treasure trail as his arms and legs quickly were flooded with hair. Francisco even spotted some growing on Ric&#39;s plump and muscular ass. Ric&#39;s body hair wasn&#39;t the only to change. His hair on his head became less shaggy and shorten as if it was getting a fresh cut. Stubble appeared on his face forming a small beard that accentuated his growing manliness.<br />
<br />
The next changes were far more interesting as Ric&#39;s body began to develop more profoundly. Ric began to grow until his legs and feet were far over his bed and almost touching the ground. Ric began to grunt as his arms thickened and grew impressive muscles exposing his much more grown armpit hair. Next were his legs which thickened and hardened exposing even more leg hairs than before.<br />
<br />
Finally Ric&#39;s chest underwent some changes. His nipples spread apart growing some hair as his pecs developed along by becoming large and round from muscle. A six pack framed on his chest hiding his once prominent treasure trail. But fortunately a new array of chest hairs covered his pecs.<br />
<br />
Now a muscular man, Francisco watched for his favorite change. Ric began to moan and thrust as his genitals began to develop. His balls dropped and grew to the size of golf balls. While his once 5 inch dick grew four more inches leaving it to hand over his nice new large balls. Finally his dick began widening and expanding to a reasonable length as the changes were completed at last. Of course, the pubes had spread a lot and now they were even covering Ric&#39;s bigger sac.<br />
<br />
Where a normal boy once stood, now was a muscular and well developed man naked to the world. Francisco shut the book with a satisfied smirk. He looked over Ric’s new body one more time and removed the sleeping spell, leaving the room to let the boy discover his new body on his own.<br />
<br />
With the sleeping charm dispelled, Ric’s subconscious became of the changes. He tossed and turned, the mattress protesting under his increased weight. Ric groggily opened his eyes and yawned. He rubbed the sleep from his eyes and stretched.<br />
&quot;Thunk~&quot;<br />
Ric’s eyes opened wide. Unaware of his new size, Ric had underestimated his reach and hit the wall. He sat up, the springs creaking beneath him, and stared at the wall behind him. Absentmindedly, he scratched at the stubble on his jaw, but soon paused.<br />
<br />
Stubble? He touched his cheek and surely enough, he felt the prick of a sprouting beard. Ric pulled his hand away and looked at it. His hands were large, and masculine. He could see veins raise the skin on the back of hands and the glint of hair on the knuckle of his long fingers. His eyes away from his hands, up his sinewy arms, around his muscular shoulders, down to his torso, and down his long, strong legs. All of it was covered in a big amount of black coarse hair. The only exceptions he’d seen were his nipples and his new manhood, which made him blush a little after noticing it.<br />
<br />
Ric stood up with a start, reeling from the sudden drastic increase in height. He patted his new body down, prodding at his firm muscles and petting the pelt that covered them. He looked up and noticed a mirror hanging over a dresser. As he walked over, he watched a tall, handsome, man get closer and closer.<br />
<br />
“Holy shit,” he muttered in a deep baritone. He stared at the man in the mirror. His hair had shortened and now it stood up stylishly at the front, his eyes seemed to sparkle with specks of brown, and strong, sharp features. A coarse five-o’-clock shadow covered his chiseled jawline.<br />
<br />
“I’m a... I’m a grown-up!,” Ric said to himself, feeling his deep voice resonate in his chest, “No, I’m a MAN,” he corrected himself and struck a muscle-man pose.<br />
Ric turned away from the mirror and turned his attention down his navel. Following the thick trail of black hairs down from his bellybutton he stared at the meat that hung between his toned legs. Ric gave his hips a little thrust and giggled when he saw how his bigger friend swung to and fro.<br />
<br />
He looked over his massive shoulders at the stranger in the mirror, because that really was who he was now. He could see a faint resemblance to his original self in his face, but he was a little worried that no one else could recognize him.<br />
<br />
Ric rubbed his hands over his mature torso again, feeling an electric tingle in his loins. But he couldn’t help to keep wondering, how had this happened? For all that the convention was that mexican guys were not exactly too tall, Ric was definitely above the average, but somehow he still looked like a stereotypical latin man with every inch of him muscled to a degree he didn&#39;t even know was possible. <br />
<br />
He was a little panicked but at the same time, he really liked what he looked like now. He found himself really drawn to that mirror, and he dragged his hands across his muscled torso, feeling his abs and chest, and he giggled with pleasure when he felt his hands run over his nipples. He flexed his arms in a double bicep, and the sheer sight of himself like this made him swoon with adoration. He&#39;d never had this kind of muscle before.<br />
<br />
Ric twisted his body and turned - going from double bicep to a lunge and chest flex, biting his lip and enjoying how toned and strong he felt. He could tell - he could deadlift 405 lbs like this, and he was really getting off from how that felt. The sheer strength, uncommon even among gym goers, which was now his. And here he was, displaying it for himself to see. An actual adult now, beyond childish awkwardness and inhibitions.<br />
<br />
He cupped his beautiful brawny shoulders and practiced for the mirror. He frowned, he beamed, he pouted, Ric was a step away from orgasm even though he hadn&#39;t even touched himself once in this whole day. He backed off and breathed, realizing how shallow his breath was when he did so, how he had just been so taken with himself. He flexed again and saw his manhood bob back up and he moaned, a low and ragged moan, &quot;I am...I am so big...&quot;<br />
<br />
The new man couldn&#39;t stop himself. He flexed, he posed, and he showed off - in the fashion of a bodybuilder, a muscular specimen of masculinity that existed for aesthetic appreciation. Ric loved himself that was the thing he realized just doing this. Maybe it was some kind of autosexuality. He was attracted to this new man first and foremost, whom he saw in the mirror.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I gotta...!&quot; He looked down at his manhood, the temptation was great, but he also felt he needed to find out how and why this transformation occurred to him. As much the blessing as it was, he...he did need to find out how and why. He hadn&#39;t always been this muscular Adonis. But what should he do now?</p>
