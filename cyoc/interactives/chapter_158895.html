<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the creatures in the reptile house began to wrap up their transformations it was clear that Todd&#39;s remote-altered water had worked perfectly. The floors were and building were creeping with reptillian humanoids ranging from only a couple of feet tall to one giantess of a komodo dragon.<br />
<br />
In the janitor&#39;s room, a large handsome male boa constrictor found himself engaged with an equally handsome male monitor lizard. They had progressed beyond introductions and now the two sinfully dripping reptiles were eagerly exploring each other&#39;s giant sized bodies. It was at the moment that the snake began to &quot;swallow&quot; his new friend and lover that Todd opened the janitor&#39;s closet to deal with the water that had long run out of the transformation chemical.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm.&quot; The boa moaned, eyeing Todd seductively and grinning as his lizardy mate giggled. &quot;Hello, creator. Thissss, uh...&quot; He released the monitor&#39;s cock from his mouth and they both nuzzled their noses affectionately. &quot;Thisssss gentleman and I were getting to know each other better.&quot;<br />
<br />
This made the monitor lizard burst out laughing playfully and he swished his hand in the air to dismiss it. &quot;Oh, sure, gentleman. I&#39;m sure gentlemen don&#39;t lick each other&#39;s dicks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean, they might! Who&#39;ssss to ssssay, huh?!&quot; The boa said dryly.<br />
<br />
Todd couldn&#39;t help but burst out laughing as he went for the water main again, perfectly comfortable as the two large reptilians began to kiss and cuddle each other close against the far wall of the room. The water finally stopped pouring as Todd reset the fire box and he turned back to see the two tenderly kissing and nuzzling each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmm.&quot; The monitor suddenly moaned, picking up Todd&#39;s scent. &quot;You smell like you&#39;ve been having fun with some nice scale ladies.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not my thing.&quot; The snake shrugged.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I didn&#39;t say it was, darling.&quot; The monitor laughed, pulling his boyfriend close. &quot;You do you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d rather do you.&quot; The snake grinned. The two began to caress again, exchanging grips on one another&#39;s junk and lovingly stroking each other.<br />
<br />
Todd couldn&#39;t help but watch. It wasn&#39;t about lust or sex. There was a beautiful kinship between the two big lizard men as they playfully laughed and touched each other. It really began to strike the human that he had created something unique and potentially wondrous here. Imagine, animals free of humanity. No social trappings, no hate for preference or desires. Intelligent beings capable of pure love and interaction.<br />
<br />
The monitor giggled as he kissed the snake&#39;s lips again and motioned to the doorway where Todd stood. &quot;Somebody&#39;s watching us, lover.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; The boa turned his head, kneeling down excitedly. &quot;Doessss the little human want to play?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come here, little man.&quot; The monitor wagged his finger. &quot;If you&#39;d like to try the other team I&#39;m more than happy to coach.&quot;<br />
<br />
This made the snake burst out into a hiss laugh. &quot;That wassss awful!&quot; He pushed the lizard&#39;s chest back and they mock wrestled.<br />
<br />
Todd decided to leave them alone as they laid on top of each other and began to lose themselves in sweet sensual kissing.<br />
<br />
Once back in the corridor again Todd discovered the lone green anole woman sitting in the corner. She had wrapped herself in her soaking employee shirt and gulped as Todd approached.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please.&quot; She squeaked, voice high pitched and tiny. &quot;Please just leave me alone.&quot;<br />
<br />
The poor lizardess was barely over one foot tall. She might be the smallest of the smallest. Lean and girlish, she was barely developed. She saw Todd examining her body and covered herself with her damp shirt, gulping.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please?&quot; She repeated, trembling.<br />
<br />
Todd nodded, turned respectfully, and left the former human woman alone as she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-Wait!&quot; She squeaked, as Todd was about to leave the hallway.<br />
<br />
He turned and saw the tiny lizard woman standing trying to cover her shame. She gulped nervously and looked around. &quot;You were right.&quot; She squeaked, looking down at her alien feet. &quot;I... I treated these... these animals like shit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know.&quot; Todd shrugged. &quot;Maybe... maybe you get to start over. Make things right.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You... you won&#39;t change me back.&quot; She whimpered.<br />
<br />
&quot;No. No, I think you have to earn it if that&#39;s what you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I see.&quot; She sighed. She turned back and sat against the wall again, eyeing giant Todd with a little pout.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, what&#39;s your name, anyway?&quot; Todd looked back, hand on the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sandra.&quot; She sighed. She turned away again and sulked.<br />
<br />
Todd shrugged, not really feeling she had learned a lesson, and walked back out into the main room.<br />
<br />
The passion and sex had given way to general contentment. He found most of his new reptilian friends either sitting riding the high out or cuddled into each other lovingly sharing heat. This was particularly charming with the iguana couple, who he passed in the main hall snuggling against each other and snoring.<br />
<br />
He came back out into the main room to find the two crocodiles cuddling and kissing nearby the giant komodo dragon. She was whistling happily and saw Todd approaching. She smiled warmly. Todd smiled warmly. They exchanged naughty eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was quite the thing you did with your tongue, sir.&quot; The dragon giggled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I should be thanking you, miss. I think I&#39;ll be empty for years.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sucked you dry, did I?&quot; She smiled wider.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can&#39;t say I&#39;ve ever had an orgasm while being dangled by my feet, so yeah, that was new and interesting.&quot;<br />
<br />
They both laughed again and Gretta overheard, shaking her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh boy, what a day this has been.&quot; The crocodile leaned back and Fred cuddled into her side. The two muscular and well built crocodiles had fallen hopelessly for each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell me about it.&quot; Fred smiled.<br />
<br />
All around them, the lizards were either relaxing or in a state of contented bliss. The hot scent of sex and mist began to fade.<br />
<br />
&quot;So.&quot; The komodo pointed to the doors. &quot;What are we going to do about that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Todd turned and saw several employees staring at the filthy glass beyond a sort of information desk and trying to figure out what the hell was going on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit.&quot; Todd looked down at his naked body and gulped. &quot;Uh...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, whatever.&quot; Gretta grinned. &quot;It&#39;s not like some monkeys are going to stop us, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, uh... guys?&quot; Todd suddenly realized. &quot;Where&#39;s the remote?&quot;<br />
<br />
A scaled hand suddenly passed Todd a plastic baggie in which his remote had been sealed. He turned and saw the cobra woman, who was honestly kind of hurt and made no qualms about showing it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well. Lookssss like you forgot a lot of thingssss thisssss passsst hour, hmmm?&quot;<br />
<br />
Todd stared at her in guilt and she looked away nearly crying.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wassss hoping you&#39;d come back upstairssss. I wassss... lonely.&quot; The cobra crossed her arms in front of her chest and flicked her tongue. &quot;But I guessss other girlssss were more fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey...&quot; Todd gulped. &quot;You... you know how it went. I...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You forgot me.&quot; She said sadly, her hood actually falling in sadness. &quot;I asssssked you not to. I really like you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; Todd admitted, gulping.<br />
<br />
The crocodiles and the komodo dragon looked away nervously, not wanting to get involved in the awkward public ordeal.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jussst... let&#39;ssss deal with thisss.&quot; She pointed to the door, and sighed. &quot;I expect we&#39;re about to have sssssome trouble.&quot;</p>
