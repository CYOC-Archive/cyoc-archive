<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff put in the commands. He would have a tail, one that would reach the ground. He would be a humanoid Komodo Dragon Man at 7 feet 2 inches tall. He smiled at the thought of towering over his little brother&#39;s class. <br />
<br />
A few prompts came up for universe alteration. Jeff would still have the same human family, but his genetics would be the only one in the household to be altered. For muscularity, he put in the potential for massive muscle building. As it was, he would be 16 years old and a star athlete at his high school, but he would only be allowed to compete against other Reptilians from other schools. Reptilians were only 5% of the population in this universe, due to scientific experimentation. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I think we&#39;re ready!&quot; Jeff was so excited. His fingers shook as he pressed the &quot;Enter&quot; key. <br />
<br />
There was a flash. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmmm. Unggggh.&quot; Jeff was groggy. He got up and licked his scaly lips. He looked at his arms. They were very dark gray-green and covered with scales. They were thicker with muscle than he had before but they were...long. His arms were so long now! He got up and walked to the bathroom. He was now taller than the bathroom door! He bent his head down and in the bathroom he realized that his head came only a few inches away from the ceiling. Wow! He looked at his reflection. Standing there, in all his glory, (complete with a giant noticeable bulge down below under his boxer shorts), was a half Komodo Dragon half human hybrid! He smiled. His face was similar to a humans. His snout wasn&#39;t as long as a real Komodo, though it stuck out much more than a human&#39;s face would. He estimated his snout was about 8 inches long. His head wasn&#39;t totally Komodo. He looked half and half, with no hair left on his head, and instead he had smooth scales and severely reduced, very small ears. He was handsome, still, he thought. His human features allowed him to have very large but becoming eyes, a much stronger jaw then he had before and his muscularity was more developed. He had more of a beanpole frame than he&#39;d hoped for. Typical for a 7&#39;2&quot; human. His nostrils were much further apart. He opened up his mouth in delight and a huge forked tongue fell out of his mouth! <br />
<br />
&quot;Awesome!&quot; he said, noticing his vocal cords were a little different, a little more...sinister sounding. Like he was purposefully trying to sound scary to a human. But that was just how his voice sounded now. <br />
<br />
He put on his 4X T-shirt and black leather jacket. He wore special clothes made for Reptilians, he noticed. The clothing brand was &quot;Scale Pride&quot;. He put on some khaki shorts that showed off his very muscular legs, which had more definition and bulk than the rest of his body. His tail of course was unadorned. <br />
<br />
&quot;I have a tail!&quot; he said out loud, to no one. &quot;This is so awesome!&quot; He noticed that he automatically lifted his tail up when he stomped down the stairs. <br />
<br />
For breakfast, he sat at a special chair. He was much taller than his parents and Henry seemed oblivious to the changes! Since the Chronivac was assigned to Jeff, Henry didn&#39;t register any of the changes because Jeff hadn&#39;t set his awareness level. Henry was just excited Jeff was going to come to his school today. <br />
<br />
For breakfast, everyone was having cereal. But Jeff was having a few scrambled ostrich eggs which his mother always made for him as his nutritional needs were very important. <br />
<br />
Outside, he noticed that there was a safari jeep waiting for him. No roof, of course. He was far too tall for that. The seat contained a large hole for his tail so that he could drive comfortably. <br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t wait for everyone to meet you! I tell everyone about you all the time!&quot; <br />
<br />
Jeff smiled. He was a minor celebrity in his town. There weren&#39;t many Komodos around these parts. Some Alligator Men, though they kept to themselves for the most part. <br />
<br />
Finally, they got to school. In the classroom, the teacher beamed when she looked up at Jeff, who smiled shyly. She explained to the class that Jeff contracted leukemia as a young child, and that the only treatment for cancer was Reptilian Hybridization, and explained to the class how those cross genetics now saved lives. The junior high kids all had questions for Jeff. How fast could he run? About 30 mph. Did he play basketball. &quot;Yeah, sometimes, but it&#39;s not my game,&quot; he told them. &quot;But they don&#39;t allow Reptilians in the NBA yet.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jeff was so happy with his newfound attention. Everywhere he went, he towered above mere humans. </p>
