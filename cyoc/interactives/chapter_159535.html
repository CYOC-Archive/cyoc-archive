<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;What is it with Animalian punishments and making me &quot;drop&quot; places?&quot; Evelyn hissed to herself, where again, she was lead to the same back door by her guards and again put into a fake elevator where she then fell through paper covering a trap door and sending her sliding down into the basement beneath the modelling school. The forced &quot;bath&quot; punishment made for a good &quot;first&quot; round in getting her surprise, but pulling the exact same trick again was not helpful and in this she was far more hostile to it.<br />
<br />
This time, though, the basement was near pitch black and the only reason she knew people were there is that she could hear some whispers and the moving of feet against the concrete floor. She was grateful to have landed on a cushion, but didn&#39;t really change her mood. Though with the lights presently out, she had no way of knowing what was going on as she couldn&#39;t fully see. Snakes generally had poor vision and thus the Animalian conversion did not improve her eyesight, and as such she was left with only her other senses to know that there was someone there. Her ears, a feature that weren&#39;t much more than thin opening near the back of her head covered by thin scales could hear some things and between her nose and her tongue she could tell that there were other Animalians there as well.<br />
<br />
But with things near pitch black, she couldn&#39;t fully tell who and that made her a bit more wary with regard to her response. She was irritated, but also knew that if she attacked she would be attacking blindly and for all she knew the room was either full of Animalians that were immune or at least resistant to her venom or were armed and could see her and she didn&#39;t want to be in a fight she couldn&#39;t win. Thus she took her safest option which was to talk. And thankfully with some practice, she&#39;d been getting better at pronouncing words that had an &quot;s&quot; sound in them without hissing them, too much.<br />
<br />
&quot;For one thing, it&#39;s an insurance to make sure you&#39;re in a position to comply,&quot; came a feminine voice, but not one Evelyn recognized. She knew it wasn&#39;t Sabine again, but it was someone else. &quot;Which given that you&#39;ve moved around the country infecting lesbian women with HIV/AIDS was a major consideration this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This isn&#39;t a lesson,&quot; Evelyn hissed back, &quot;this is some twisted prank.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In some ways, I suppose it is,&quot; the voice answered as some of the lights came on to reveal crowd of female Animalians with two prominent females. One looked like a mink and the other was a striped skunk. &quot;But then... sometimes humiliation is the best teacher.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?!&quot; Evelyn gasped and recoiled back, noticing some movement to a side to see the officers coming in to the basement from another route before returning her focus to Maggie who had been the one to speak.<br />
<br />
&quot;When there&#39;s something that&#39;s embarrassed you, do you do it again?&quot; Maggie simply asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... no... but... most places would put me in jail for what I did,&quot; Evelyn answered, &quot;and to a degree I can... I can except that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Animalia is not most places,&quot; Maggie answered, &quot;Our intent is to see that you recognize that your forcing HIV and AIDS onto others was humiliating for them... attacking who they were. Thus the lesson to be learned... before you are essentially released on probation is to feel that sort of humiliation so that you will never wish to force it on anyone ever again... and for that... Anne Cumbertin has arranged a small show...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which ultimately you will join,&quot; the Skunk Animalian finished with a small smile and raised her tail when Evelyn moved to spread her hood, &quot;and maybe it will be... helpful in other ways.&quot;<br />
<br />
Evelyn backed off from any challenge. Skunks weren&#39;t immune to any snake&#39;s venom, but that didn&#39;t mean that Evelyn wanted to be sprayed either. As Anne then gestured to the other Animalians that were around, Evelyn noted a very similar theme with all of them. Their species were all different, but they all wore some variation of a &quot;sexy maid&#39;s outfit.&quot; In some cases the skirt was short in length and hugged the Animalian&#39;s body tightly, leaving little to the imagination and raised some desires on Evelyn&#39;s part. On others the length of the skirt was longer, but it was of firmer fabric and sitting on top of some rather fluffy layers. In this the result was essentially still the same in that Evelyn could see a good bit of hip and if they turned around and bent over, Evelyn was also sure she&#39;d get a good view on the shape of their butt or what panties they were wearing. The top of the dress also didn&#39;t do much to cover the generous bosom that all Animalian females had, and a few even looked like they were designed to enhance it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... uh...&quot; Evelyn said slowly as one of the &quot;models&quot; that was there picked up a box from the floor that was behind the curtain hanging from the ceiling. The model fiddled with the box for a moment, but soon lifted a black dress that wasn&#39;t too different from the ones the models were wearing, at least from outward appearance.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;ll be something you can wear to get all the boy&#39;s attention... or all the girl&#39;s attention, once you&#39;re comfortable with yourself,&quot; Anne spoke, &quot;and there may be some practical tips too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like what?&quot; Evelyn asked nervously, &quot;I&#39;m already aware that I have no legs, so shorts, pants, and anything that requires legs to wear, I can&#39;t wear.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A good start,&quot; Maggie commented, &quot;but we will still move forward with what must be done... so that you understand what you forced on others was wrong...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t want to be a model!&quot; Evelyn protested as Maggie and Anne came forward and began to undress her.<br />
<br />
&quot;And that is why this is part of your punishment,&quot; Anne countered, &quot;you forced HIV/AIDS on people out of beliefs that who we love is wrong. I&#39;m sure none of the people you infected... now needing conversions to cure them... wanted it. It is something think over, non? Unless you&#39;d rather sit in a jail cell with little contact with the outside world for fear being beat up in prison?&quot;<br />
<br />
Evelyn didn&#39;t answer that. Partially because she knew they had a point and at the same time, a big part of her plea agreement was to essentially play to what Animalia&#39;s city government had in mind. Which apparently included being humiliated by their modelling school, even if she didn&#39;t like it. As Maggie readied a camera, she grew even more nervous.<br />
<br />
&quot;And remember... as a model, you will need to make sure that you smile and put your best features toward the camera,&quot; Maggie said with a knowing smile.</p>
