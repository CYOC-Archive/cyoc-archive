<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty’s Power- Ty shows Peter how to become stretchy – by scriptboy<br />
<br />
Ty, of all people, can be very lazy and self seeking. Since he was the orphan who never had his own parents, he had learned to survive on his own and to be as independent as he possibly could. But over the past two weeks he had noted a trend that had begun to get on his nerves: Peter and Dustin hadn’t done a thing around the house. The house started to look like a mess and Ty was getting tired of living in it.<br />
<br />
Dustin has been wrapped up in studying for a test, where he’s had stacks of books and papers all over the dinner table in the kitchen. Because of all the mess, the boys had not been able to eat at the kitchen table for the past two weeks, meaning that there were cups and plates scattered all over the house.<br />
<br />
Peter had been locked up in his room for over two weeks, working on computer stuff. He had blown a fuse twice, cutting off the power to the rest of the house. His room looked like a workshop, with computers, cables, motherboards, and disk drives everywhere. But one day Peter went looking for a book in the garage when he did something that was the last straw for Ty.<br />
<br />
Peter was looking for an old computer book in the garage. There was a large bookcase in the garage, and Peter thought about going through it. While he was going through the shelves, the single light bulb on the ceiling had burned out, leaving him in the dark. Peter found a box with new bulbs and grabbed the old wooden ladder so he could get to the bulb that was hanging from the ceiling. Since the ceiling in the garage was rather high, he had to climb on the ladder to get to the bulb. Unfortunately, the old wooden ladder was about to crack because of old age, and it gave way when Peter had just gotten to the next to highest step, sending Peter tumbling down on to the concrete floor and making the old wooden ladder crash into the side wall of the garage. <br />
<br />
When Ty and Dustin heard that, they immediately got up and ran to the garage, where they found the ladder on the floor with Peter laying on his back! <br />
<br />
“Peter! Are you alright? What happened?” Ty said, as he walked up to his cousin and helped the boy to get on his feet again. Peter got up with a groan, with an expression of pain on his face.<br />
<br />
“Darn ladder! It broke and I fell on my back! Ouch!” he groaned, as he slowly got back on his feet.<br />
<br />
“The ladder? Why did you use the ladder?” Ty asked Peter.<br />
<br />
“The bulb had just burned out and I wanted to replace it so I could see what kind of computer books you had in your bookcase!” Peter explained, while twisting his back a little to shake off the pain of the fall.<br />
<br />
“You darn Canadians! You do everything the hard way! What’s the matter with you, Peter? Don’t you have your powers anymore?” Ty said, feeling a bit annoyed with his cousin. “Look how I do it! I wish for my body to be stretchy!”<br />
<br />
Peter gasped as Ty’s arms stretched out almost eight feet, until they reached the burned out bulb and began to twist it out of the socket. As soon as the bulb was loose, Ty held it in his right hand and snapped his arms back to their normal length.<br />
<br />
“Here’s you burned out light bulb, Peter! And I got it without even using the old ladder! I just make my arms elastic! I’m shocked that you, of all people, with all your transformation powers and tricks, that you didn’t even think of this! Now, give me the new bulb!” Ty ordered his cousin. Peter handed him the new bulb, while he tossed the old one in the trash can.<br />
<br />
Ty grabbed hold of the new bulb and stretched out his arms again, until his hands reached the ceiling. He screwed the bulb into the socket until it was as tight as it could be. Then Ty stretched his arm towards to light switch on the wall, and turned the light on in the garage. He then snapped his arms back while Peter looked on in amazement.<br />
<br />
“I bet you’ve never tried that trick before, huh?” Ty said. He had never seen Peter become stretchy before, and it seemed ironic to him that here he was, teaching the Transformation Master the easiest trick he knew. Peter shook his head, and humbly accepted the fact that Ty knew one trick that he had never tried before.<br />
<br />
“You know every type of transformation trick in the book! You can perform the hardest tricks, but this trick is so easy, that you don’t even know it! And here you are, with these awesome powers, and you’re doing things the hard way, as if you had forgotten that you even have them! You’re worse than Dustin! And he doesn’t even have powers!” Ty said to his cousin, becoming even more irritated with his cousin.<br />
<br />
“You need to go out and have some fun! When is the last time you’ve gone outside? I haven’t seen you get out of your room for the past two weeks! You need to go out and use your talents, Peter! I mean, what have you been doing over the past few weeks?” Ty asked his cousin. Peter just stood in silence, for he knew that Ty was right.<br />
<br />
“I’ve been doing some computer work in my room!” Peter responded.<br />
<br />
“Just out of curiosity: what kind of computer work?” Ty wondered out loud.<br />
<br />
“Well, I found this old tower that had an old hard drive in it. At first I wanted to network it with my laptop, but since the old version of Windows had crashed on it, I had to re-install it. Then I had to plug it in to a network card, but since the BIOS was outdated, I had to download the newest patch off the Internet. When I upgraded it to Windows XP, I decided to backup the files on to a zip drive first. Then I replaced the sound card and the video card, but it needed the newest drivers. So I had to go online and…” Peter began to explain to his cousin.<br />
<br />
“Ahhhh! Stop it! Peter, you’re starting to talk like a rocket scientist!” Ty shouted, getting even more frustrated. “You and Dustin have been so wrapped up in studying and messing around with computers, that you have neglected the house, the yard, the garage, and Peter, you have forgotten how to use your powers!”<br />
<br />
Peter and Dustin just turned towards each other and they both shrugged. “Well, you made a good point, Ty. I think we both need to take a break!” Dustin replied.<br />
<br />
“I got an idea!” Ty responded. “I will stay home and clean the house, the yard, and the garage, because I’ve had enough of looking at the mess everywhere. Ryan will stay here and help me out.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t you want us to help you? That’s a lot of work! I feel kind of bad, leaving you and Ryan here with all that work!” Peter replied to his cousin. He began to feel guilty about having neglected the house, and he felt uncomfortable with the idea that Ty and Ryan were going to clean the whole house themselves.<br />
<br />
“No! You two are going to be in the way and I’m a little tired of seeing you guys at home all the time. We can get the job done easily, with Ryan’s strength and my powers! I want you two out of the house! Go play basketball or something! You’re not in Canada anymore, Peter! It’s not like it’s too cold to go out! You’re in Orlando, Florida! So go out and enjoy yourself! There are plenty of people out there for you to change. I want you two out of the house!” Ty said angrily.<br />
<br />
Ty then concentrated on Dustin and Peter. Suddenly Peter was dressed in his blue basketball shorts and jersey, and he was wearing his Air Jordan high tops. Dustin was wearing his blue jersey and matching shorts. And he finally saw his basketball shoes materialize on his feet.<br />
<br />
Then Ty grabbed the basketball that was in the corner and tossed it to Peter, who caught it with his hands. <br />
<br />
“There! Now go outside! Play basketball and walk around downtown. Get out of the house!” Ty said, as he walked Peter and Dustin to the garage door, which he had opened using his powers. <br />
<br />
“Hey Ty, can I ask you a small favor?” Peter asked his cousin.<br />
<br />
“Sure, Peter! What do you need?” Ty replied.<br />
<br />
“Can you teach me how to be stretchy?” Peter asked him humbly, while handing the basketball to Dustin.<br />
<br />
“Just wish for your body to become elastic!” Ty answered. “It’s the easiest transformation trick around! I’m surprised you’ve never even tried it before!”<br />
<br />
“Okay. I wish my entire body were elastic!” Peter said out loud. Then Ty grabbed hold of Peter’s hands, and he started to walk backwards, pulling Peter’s arms out. His arms were now stretchy, and they became longer and longer as Ty continued to pull them further back. “Wow! This is weird! My arms are like over ten feet long now!” Peter said, while looking at his stretched arms with amazement.<br />
<br />
“Now take a seat, stretchy-boy!” Ty said, grabbing Peter by the shoulders and pushing him onto the old recliner that was standing in the center of the garage. While Peter was sitting in the recliner, Ty stood in front of him, grabbed hold of his basketball shoes, and pulled them towards him as he slowly walked backwards, stretching Peter’s legs in the process.<br />
<br />
“Holy smoke! Look at what you did to my legs!” Peter exclaimed, looking at Ty with complete amazement. Ty finally let go, and Peter gasped when he saw that his legs were stretched out towards the other end of the garage. He moved them around, and grinned when he saw how easy it was to stretch them out even further.<br />
<br />
“Alright, now snap yourself back together so that you look normal again!” Ty instructed. Peter’s long arms and legs snapped back, quickly shrinking until you couldn’t tell that he was elastic because his body looked normal again. <br />
<br />
“Hey Plastic Man, let’s go! Let’s get out of here before Ty goes crazy!” Dustin said to Peter. Peter and Dustin walked out, and Ty closed the garage door when they had left. Then Ty walked back into the house via the side door and he ran up the stairs to Ryan’s room, cheering of joy. Ty stretched his legs out in front of him and made it to the top of the stairs in just one mighty step.<br />
<br />
“Hey Ryan! Peter and Dustin are gone! It’s just us two!” Ty shouted as he walked into Ryan’s room. The giant ebony muscle boy was doing his homework when Ty walked in.<br />
<br />
“Really? Where did they go? What are we going to do?” Ryan asked Ty, with a worried look on his face. <br />
<br />
“We’re going to the mall to grab some lunch. Then we’re going to come back and clean this place up! Sounds like a deal?” Ty asked the big muscle boy, who had just gotten up from his chair, and who now towered over Ty like a giant.<br />
<br />
“Sure! This will be the first time that I have ever gotten to hang out with you, Ty! Just you and me! But when will Peter and Dustin come back?” he asked the smaller but older teenager, who was looking up to him.<br />
<br />
“Peter and Dustin went out to play basketball, I think they’re going to walk around downtown and I don’t expect them back until tonight! We got a lot of work to do! Are you hungry?” Ty asked the muscle giant.<br />
<br />
“You know me, Ty! I’m always hungry!” Ryan responded with a smile on his face.<br />
<br />
“Ryan, we’re going to hang out for a bit and we’ll grab lunch on the way. Are you ready to go out?” Ty asked the giant boy.<br />
<br />
Ryan grabbed Ty and let him sit on his shoulder. Ryan was just wearing a pair of shorts and his sandals, and he walked out the front door of the house with Ty sitting on his back. “Let’s go to the mall!” he shouted, feeling happy that he finally had the chance to hang out with Ty for awhile.<br />
<br />
Where did Ty and Ryan go for lunch? And what did Dustin and Peter do while they walked around downtown Orlando, after they played basketball?</p>
