<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Someone was pre-occupied earlier.”<br />
Said Sam. Tyler looked up guiltily, only to realise he was talking to Oliver.<br />
<br />
“I can’t help it man. She’s just so fucking hot.”<br />
“Really? I don’t see the appeal.”<br />
“One day I’m gonna fuck the shit out of her. Like this.”<br />
<br />
Oliver was wearing nothing but underwear. Tyler noticed his slight hairy chest and arms flex as he jumped the air. The large bulge between his meaty thighs was semi-erect, and began to push against the fabric of his pants. Sam just laughed.<br />
<br />
“You certainly know how to treat a lady.”<br />
He said sarcastically.<br />
<br />
“Seriously bro how do you not find her sexy?”<br />
“Not my cup of tea I suppose.”<br />
<br />
They both laughed. Sam was wearing his usual shirt-underwear combo for bed, but his shirt looked tighter, and smaller. Tyler was wearing his second pair of striped pyjamas. The first pair are in his suitcase, hidden.<br />
<br />
“Oh hey, guess what I found.”<br />
<br />
Sam reaches under his bed and pulled out a large cardboard box. Oliver’s eyes lit up as he peeked inside the box.<br />
<br />
“No way! There are so many!”<br />
“I know!”<br />
<br />
Tyler looked worried.<br />
<br />
“Where did you find them?”<br />
“I just found the box full of them in my locker. I dunno who put it there.”<br />
“I’m not complaining. They’re delicious!”<br />
<br />
Oliver took a few and began eating them. Sam took a handful and handed them to Tyler.<br />
<br />
“Come on, try some. They’re pizza-flavoured.”<br />
“Steak!”<br />
<br />
Oliver said loudly, parts of the flowers flying from his mouth.<br />
<br />
“I’m good, thanks. You can have mine.”<br />
“Suit yourself”<br />
<br />
Said Sam as he ate the entire handful in one go. Not long after, the box was empty, with Oliver and Sam lying on their beds feeling incredibly bloated.<br />
<br />
“I think I’m gonna be sick.”<br />
“Have you got any more?”<br />
“No wait, I’m definitely gonna be sick.”<br />
<br />
Sam got up quickly and ran towards the door, making his way towards the bathroom. Tyler followed, he needed to make sure his friend is alright.<br />
<br />
The bathroom was incredibly small. It was just one room with one toilet, one sink, and one shower. A large mirror stood opposite the door. Tyler has to quickly get used to sharing with boys his age, often at the same time. He remembers having a shower when Oliver and Sam both came in to brush their teeth. That door needs a lock.<br />
<br />
Sam hurled his body through the door and over the toilet, getting ready to hurl. Tyler entered behind him.<br />
“Do you need anything? I can get you a glass of water?”<br />
“Yeah that’d be great, thanks. My stomach feel so hot.”<br />
“OK I’ll be quick.”<br />
<br />
Tyler made his way down the dark corridor. He noticed Sam’s voice was slightly deeper, but just assumed it was his mind playing tricks. The corridor was lit faintly by one light at the end. To the left of that light was the entrance to the kitchen. Tyler opened the creaky door and stopped in his tracks.<br />
<br />
Dwayne was in the kitchen, filling a large container with water. He was wearing a multi-coloured onesie. It was daunting for Tyler to see him out of his uniform. The onesie just fit on his huge body. Every curve, bulge, and muscle, was on display. His large, flaccid dick filled most of the onsie. Tyler noticed his thick neck turn towards him. Dwayne’s Blue eyes glowed in the dim kitchen.<br />
<br />
“Hi there.”<br />
“H-hi. Sorry c-can I just..”<br />
Tyler squeezes past Dwayne, the monster bulge rubbing against his hip. He hastily filled a glass with water. Dwayne didn’t move, and stood incredibly close to Tyler.<br />
<br />
“Thirsty?”<br />
“N-no it’s my friend he’s f-feeling sick.”<br />
“Ah well, drinking plenty of water will definitely help.”<br />
“Hopefully.”<br />
“I saw you last night.”<br />
<br />
Tyler froze. He could hear Dwayne’s deep, long breaths. Tyler’s cock grew erect in seconds, as his breathing quickened and his hands started to shake. He was too afraid to turn around.<br />
<br />
“I-I-…Y-yo-you-“<br />
“You don’t need to say anything. I usually do it really late so no one sees it. Sorry you had to.”<br />
“N-no I’m s-Sorry for looking.”<br />
“You shouldn’t be. Hey, meet me in my dorm in 30 minutes. I’ve got something I wanna show ya. It’s room 203.”<br />
<br />
Dwayne then left the kitchen. As he did so, Tyler turned around to see him. All he could see was the boy’s wide, muscular back, and his perfectly round butt bounce as he walked out of the room and around the corner. Tyler was so turned on, but suppressed his horniness as he made his way back to the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Tyler opened the door, and almost dropped the glass. Sam was still hunched over the toilet, but the back of his shirt had been torn to shreds. In it’s place was his large, bulging shoulder blades that started pushing even further out. Sam’s arms had grown considerably, his biceps still growing.<br />
<br />
“Shit Sam, are you OK?”<br />
<br />
Sam didn’t say anything. He slowly tried to stand up. He was easily 6’2”, and his clothes were certainly paying the price. His shirt stopped just below his belly button, which revealed hard pack of abs. His pecs were larger than before, and Tyler could see the outline of his sensitive nipples piercing through what was left of the shirt. Sam’s legs grew wider, until there was no space between them. His cock was poking out the right leg of his underwear, which was only semi-erect at over 10”! Sam grabbed the water with his manly hands and drank the entire thing in one go. After he did that, his cock grew until it ripped through his underwear and was shooting out of his crotch at 12”. It was starting to leak pre-cum all over the floor. He grabbed his large manhood and began pumping it vigorously, moaning loudly. His voice dropped an octave as he pulled on his cock quicker and quicker. His moans turned into roars until he eventually came. Tyler quickly took cover behind the door, and could hear Sam’s loads splatter everywhere in the room. As he re-entered, the thick smell of cum and musk flooded Tyler’s nose. Sam then collapsed on Tyler, who was almost crushed under the large teen. Tyler just stood in shock for a second. He knew the flowers were doing something, he wasn’t crazy! His boner refused to go down as he tried to carry Sam back to the dorm.<br />
<br />
He eventually dragged Sam into the dorm. It smelt of B.O. and musk. He tried lifting Sam on the bed, but was distracted by a figure in his room.<br />
<br />
Oliver was sitting up on his bed, staring at Tyler. He was completely naked, and had grown considerably. He was around 6’4”, and was drenched in cum. The dorm was littered with his loads, and his bed had collapsed under his new weight. His 15” cock was still hard, and he was absent-mindedly massaging it. He then stood up, and lifted Sam off of Tyler. No words were spoken. The complete silence was often broken by Oliver’s deep, sexy breathing. He carried Sam to his own bed, and lay next to him. He held onto Sam as he grinder his cock against Sam’s bubble butt.<br />
<br />
Tyler, still in shock, ran from the dorm. This was too much for him, and he still had to meet with Dwayne!</p>
