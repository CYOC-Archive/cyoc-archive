<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When I woke up the next morning, the first thing I noticed was that I was horny. Really horny. My morning wood caused an obvious tent in my pajamas and no amount of breathing, walking around my room, or thinking about gross things, would bring it down. I guess this is what happens when you can&#39;t fuck for a day after fucking your girlfriend daily for the last two weeks. I was probably going to have to rub one out later on today. That was going to be annoying.<br />
<br />
I quickly changed into my jeans and a t-shirt, trying to control myself as I shoved my dick into my pants. Fuck, it was sensitive. I was walking weird just to try to give it a little attention as possible. It wasn&#39;t working.<br />
<br />
After a little bit of my commotion, Taylor woke up, too. The redhead groggily rose from his bed and slipped off his covers, rubbing his eyes as he did so. Oddly enough, the first thing I noticed was that he was sporting wood, too. Why was I even looking down there? It was completely common for that to happen to guys in the mornings. It was normal.<br />
<br />
Unless it wasn&#39;t...<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning,&quot; Taylor mumbled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning,&quot; I replied. &quot;We slept until noon. Pretty sure breakfast and lunch have been served.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good to kn--&quot; he began. He paused after looking down, finally noticing his situation. Anyone in mile radius would have seen the bulge in his shorts. &quot;Uhm. Sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No worries, bro,&quot; I stated as he began attempting to cover himself. &quot;It happens to the best of us. After all, none of us have girls here anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
Taylor looked at me, understanding my statement. Before he could press further, someone began knocking on our door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get up guys. You&#39;re the last ones in bed,&quot; the person yelled. I realized pretty quickly who it was. I swung the door open to see Daniel&#39;s familiar black bangs in front of my eyes. The guy had always been smaller than me so he had to look up at me with his soft, brown eyes. Still, he had that familiar, plain but uncertain look on his face. Seeing him okay was a relief.<br />
<br />
&quot;Daniel! You&#39;re looking and sounding better today,&quot; I remarked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I think I just needed a good night&#39;s sleep. Sorry I made you guys worry, I&#39;m fine,&quot; he explained. &quot;Still though, you two are way late. They took your breakfast away already. All you&#39;ve got is your lunch now. When you&#39;re done, we&#39;re all hanging out in the lounge.&quot;<br />
<br />
I nodded, grabbing the packaged lunch trays from the floor. Then, I went in for a bro hug to say goodbye. As I did so, my dick grazed against Daniel&#39;s jeans ever so slightly, causing me to jump back in shock. Fuck, that shouldn&#39;t have felt that good. I needed some &quot;me time&quot; soon.<br />
<br />
In response, Daniel let out that uncharacteristic giggle again, freaking me out even more. &quot;Chill, it&#39;s not like I&#39;m contagious or something. See you later.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, he just strutted right down the hall, leaving me at a loss for words. Why on Earth had I reacted like that? And why did Daniel react like that? I had barely woken up but I was already uneasy.<br />
<br />
&quot;You okay dude?&quot; Taylor asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yeah, I&#39;m fine,&quot; I stuttered. &quot;Let&#39;s just eat.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, we quickly scarfed down our food and headed out to the lounge. The entire time I found it increasingly difficult to ignore the pressing need in my nether region. Every shift caused my body to scream in need and I completely lost focus on the conversation Taylor and I were having. It was only okay because the same thing was happening to Taylor, as well. By the time we got to the lounge, we were both kind of a mess.<br />
<br />
The strange thing was that it felt like nothing was different. In the center, Jacob, Chase and Daniel were playing ping pong while others used the other games available. Off to the side, people sat in the comfy lounge chairs, studying for their next exam or catching up on homework. The sun still brightly shone outside, and the campus was picturesque. It didn&#39;t feel like we were actually in a quarantine because of a ludicrous virus that was on the loose. It made me want to relax and finish up my paper on the state&#39;s judiciary that was due Monday. Or would&#39;ve been due Monday at least. Honestly, who the hell knew anymore.<br />
<br />
I tried to take my mind off past events by focusing on the game between Jacob and Chase. It was weird. Usually Jacob&#39;s incredible intellect meant that he was easily able to predict everything Chase could do, but today, it appeared that the blonde was having difficulty. It actually made the game somewhat exciting and distracted me a little from the pressing need in my jeans. It wasn&#39;t football or anything like that, but definitely better than golf or something, and it was helping.<br />
<br />
It was about half way through the game when Daniel, who was serving as referee, got completely distracted by something. Tracing his line of sight, I found that he was staring at two men passing by the lounge, caught up in their own conversation. It almost looked like Daniel was longing for something. It took a while, but eventually one of them noticed Daniel staring and smiled at him as he motioned for him to join them. Without questioning it, the black haired man began walking straight towards the strangers.<br />
<br />
Jacob began calling out to Daniel, but before he could finish his statement, Daniel simply stated, &quot;Sorry guys, gotta go. I&#39;m meeting up with some new friends to... talk with them.&quot;<br />
<br />
He punctuated the sentence with a last, uncharacteristic giggle and walked away. I don&#39;t know why but I got the feeling that there wouldn&#39;t be much talking between them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anybody wanna question that?&quot; Taylor asked. I wanted to say something, but I accidentally shifted my weight, causing my dick to rub up against my jeans. It was all I could do not to moan out loud.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know, I think Chase was the last one to see him before the guy went to bed,&quot; Jacob noted. Daniel had his own room because of anxiety issues, making this even more weird. &quot;You notice anything?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Man, fuck if I know. You know I&#39;m not in the mood right now. I just wanted to play the game, but our ref just left,&quot; Chase replied, puzzling us even more. Even if he ever wasn&#39;t in the mood, the dude always put on his &quot;I&#39;m student council president&quot; face and pretended to be great. What was going on?<br />
<br />
The two began bickering with each other, completely ignoring their surroundings and the game. It was far too easy for me to drown out the meaningless racket and without the game to distract me, my mind focused on one, throbbing thing. I was losing it. If I didn&#39;t do something fast, it would be a problem.<br />
<br />
Fuck this.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll be back!&quot; I yelled, not bothering to see if they heard or cared. Before I knew it, I was already in the floor&#39;s bathroom, slamming the stall shut and fishing out my dick. It only took a few touches before I came, causing a huge mess on the stall door and floor. The pleasure was immense. I yelled out and then sighed in relief.<br />
<br />
I wanted to clean up and go back out, but before I could, I realized with horror that my dick still hadn&#39;t softened. Instead, it glared back at me, not as purple as before, but definitely red and needy. Cautiously, I touched it once more, and gasped in pleasure. This time, I took it slow, and was able to indulge in my thoughts. I pictured Lisa&#39;s thighs, and my hand sliding up them. I began imagining myself kissing them, and sensations banged throughout my body. Fuck, I was already close. I got closer and closer to her center and was almost ready to blow by the time I reached her sex. I reached the soft, smooth skin at the core, and shifted my head as I kissed the base of his shaft. I slowly grazed my lips along the shaft and timed my orgasm as I kissed the tip of his cock. Wait. His cock?<br />
<br />
That thought was the one that came with my cum as I spurted a second time all over the stall. Pleasure racked my brain as I realized what I had done. I just masturbated to someone who, not only wasn&#39;t my girlfriend, but was also a fucking guy! I literally jacked myself off and pawed at my ass because of some guy?!<br />
<br />
Wait, what?<br />
<br />
I turned my head to see my other hand, still firmly cupping my left ass cheek. What the fuck was happening to me?</p>
