<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The knowledge that Frank Rhoer would drive Molly and I to Peoria when the time came for Leona's wedding was a bit of relief to Molly and I. Driving across three or four states would not be comfortable at our size and we needed someone to do that for us. And Frank Rhoer took on the role. Once that was completed Molly's Uncle gave both of us an update on what they had been doing, particularly in relation to the calving of the small herd that Molly and I officially owned. Things had been going well, and all of female cattle survived giving birth. They planned to brand them in a week or two, when they'd built up their strength, as well as to have them taken in to the local vet for the first time to administer all the necessary medical treatments to make sure they came to no harm.<br />
<br />
We both nodded and thanked him for the update, as well as thanking for his help in making sure that Molly and I had a means to get to Peoria. With our mission there complete, we let Frank Rhoer and his daughters get back to their work and we went to deal with our own daily missions.<br />
<br />
&quot;We could probably stand to restock our refrigerator and the deep freeze, today,&quot; Molly commented as we made our way back toward Bandhavgarh.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can help,&quot; I nodded, &quot;let me get my wallet once we get back and we can head off.&quot;<br />
<br />
Molly nodded as we continued on. We returned to Bandhavgarh Cabin long enough for me to go upstairs, get my wallet and then return downstairs, where Molly was waiting for me. We then made our way into town. As we did so, there were a few hushed whispers from people, though they had made sure to stay far enough away that neither Molly nor I could make out what they said. It seemed to be a step backward from the way a lot of people were starting to treat Molly and I after Beauregard's scheme was defeated and exposed for the coward scam it was. <br />
<br />
I guessed that they were still responding to the news of Leona's lost lawsuit and didn't look all that fondly on the results. If only they knew that Molly and I weren't all that in favor of letting people take the Animatrix Serum, as it was now being called. But, Columbia Falls was a small town. Eventually they would know where Molly and I stood... or at least the would realize tat we played no real role in the lawsuit. Until then, we would simply carry on.<br />
<br />
Our shopping mission went off very well. We picked up plenty of meat ranging from beef to pork, some chicken, turkey, sandwich meats, as well as a few boneless fish fillets and a bag or two of shrimp. And there was plenty left for the rest of the people of Columbia Falls. In the short time since Molly and I had moved to the Montana town, the local grocer had already enlarged its meat section. We also picked up a few cartons of eggs, and made our way to the checkout.<br />
<br />
As we arrived there, we ran into the cashier that had been very friendly to me, even if he seemed rather odd in doing so.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, hello!&quot; he said enthusiastically, &quot;how are things going for you two today, George, and Miss Molly, I understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just Molly,&quot; Molly answered and began to put our purchases on the checkout counter, &quot;I don't use any Ms., Mrs., or Miss.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Though you will settle for &quot;Tiger-Lady&quot;,&quot; I teased.<br />
<br />
&quot;Only from the kids at school,&quot; Molly answered, shaking her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you guys seen the news of late?&quot; the cashier asked, sounding excited.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you're referring to the lawsuit, yes we have seen the news,&quot; I told him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Exciting, isn't it?&quot; the teen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Exciting isn't the word we would use, actually,&quot; Molly informed him, &quot;turning oneself into an animal person won't make them happy. It could in fact make their lives difficult. They may not become dangerous to people, but that doesn't mean that the'll have to overcome some very big hurdles.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You two are happy as you are, aren't you?&quot; he asked curiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;We are happy together,&quot; I answered, &quot;our species is unimportant in that regard. We'd be happy together as humans or as tigers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We've accepted that we are tigers now,&quot; Molly told him, &quot;we'd like to be human again... but we know that is likely impossible.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The two of you look well, together, though... as you are now I mean,&quot; the teen commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, I guess,&quot; Molly answered slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You haven't honestly thought of applying for the Animatrix Serum?&quot; I asked as I paid for the items Molly and I had bought.<br />
<br />
&quot;I had asked, but the guy on the phone said I had to be eighteen to take the drug, in accordance with basic FDA regulations,&quot; the teen answered, &quot;but I had thought it'd be cool... to be bigger... stronger...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hungrier?&quot; Molly asked, knowing that our transformations had heightened our metabolisms and required both Molly and I to consume a large amount of food every day.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd take it if it means attracting a girlfriend,&quot; the teen replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't need to be strong to find a girlfriend,&quot; Molly told him, &quot;When we were human, what brought me to George were the non-physical things I knew because of our long friendship. His strength back then was not what made me love him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not to mention that teens won't be knocking down your door because you gained fur,&quot; I told him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; the teen replied. It didn't quite sound like he accepted it, but it was the best we could manage for the moment, &quot;I see... all the same though, they said I had to be eighteen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just make sure you make a wise decision when you make it,&quot; I warned, &quot;be sure to think things through.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; the cashier nodded and handed me the receipt.<br />
<br />
Molly and I collected our bags and made our way out. Once we were outside and on our way back to Bandhavgarh Cabin, Molly gave a slightly nervous glance to me.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was possibly the oddest conversation I've ever been in,&quot; She commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;He's alright,&quot; I told her, &quot;and given that his &quot;oddness&quot; has him supporting you and I... I wouldn't fight him and risk losing some of the few people who are supportive of us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose,&quot; Molly nodded, &quot;but it was still odd.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The rest of the day went peacefully. Our mission to secure a ride was complete, and we acquired enough food to make sure our supply of meat was fully stocked. By the next morning, though, the oddities didn't go away. Officer Jenkins did come on and I met her as I arrived at the station.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning, George,&quot; she greeted me politely, &quot;How was your day, yesterday?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty good,&quot; I nodded, &quot;enjoyed a day off to handle some personal business.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Personal?&quot; Officer Jenkins asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Molly was invited to be bridesmaid in a wedding and we needed to arrange a ride for the both of us,&quot; I explained, &quot;though we don't know WHEN it is yet, so I can't take time off.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A ride?&quot; Officer Jenkins asked, &quot;don't you and your wife walk everywhere?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The wedding is in Peoria,&quot; I told her, &quot;a family friend from before when Molly and I moved here.&quot;<br />
<br />
That was a slight fib on my part, as Leona was merely an acquaintance when Molly was transformed and while we were in college. The idea of us being friends with her didn't really come until after I had transformed and we needed her help. But I didn't think Officer Jenkins could guess those details, and I really didn't want to talk about Leona's wedding until they were farther along in planning it then they were.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell them congratulations for me then,&quot; Officer Jenkins replied.<br />
<br />
We continued on into the station when she chuckled slightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Megan hoped you would drop by for a visit yesterday,&quot; she chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't want to bother you with your responsibilities to your mother,&quot; I told her, &quot;and Molly and I both had some other responsibilities to take care of at home.&quot;<br />
<br />
Officer Jenkins nodded as we made our way in. We found Officer Howard pouring himself a cup of coffee as we came in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning, you too,&quot; Officer Howard spoke, &quot;Do you have a moment?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We were preparing for our patrol, sir,&quot; Officer Jenkins answered, &quot;but I believe we have a few moments.&quot;<br />
<br />
Officer Howard nodded, &quot;come with me then.&quot;<br />
<br />
We followed him into his office. Once there, he sat down and addressed Officer Jenkins directly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have looked over the questions from the kidnapping case you and Officer Barnes called in,&quot; Officer Howard spoke firmly, &quot;and I apologize if this upsets you, Officer Jenkins, but I felt the both of you should know. Officer Wayne because you helped bring him in. Officer Jenkins because it's personal for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm alright, sir,&quot; Officer Jenkins answered, &quot;Officer Wayne got my baby girl back. That's all that matters.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, because from the way he answered the questions, I think this is somewhat personal for him too,&quot; Officer Howard remarked, &quot;the man claims that what he did wasn't kidnapping. He doesn't deny taking the child, but he denies that it was kidnapping.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How could he possibly claim that?&quot; Officer Jenkins gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;He actually claims to be Megan's father,&quot; Officer Howard spoke firmly, &quot;says he is an Officer in Spokane, Washington, which I believe is where you came here from, Officer Jenkins.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's impossible,&quot; Officer Jenkins spoke, &quot;I was drunk that night. I have no idea who Megan's father is, and I was never able to figure it out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All the same, he claims that Megan is his daughter,&quot; Officer Howard told her, &quot;and he claims that you stole her from him to begin with.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's a lie!&quot; Officer Jenkins blurted, &quot;I was still pregnant when my family moved here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He doesn't deny that, either,&quot; Officer Howard replied, &quot;his reasoning is extremely odd, at least based by what his answers are.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If the guy is an officer, he could lose his badge for this,&quot; I commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not the first time a cop, anywhere, has gone crocked or nuts,&quot; Officer Howard replied, &quot;honestly, I would think that nuts would be a fair description.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How did he know we lived here?&quot; Officer Jenkins asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Apparently through an unnamed friend,&quot; Officer Howard answered, &quot;which is why I thought you should here this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why does he think he is the father?&quot; I wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;That he didn't say,&quot; Officer Howard sighed<br />
<br />
&quot;May Officer Wayne and I talk to him?&quot; Officer Jenkins asked, &quot;find out what he knows?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have no real problem with it,&quot; Officer Howard shrugged, &quot;none of it will be official, but from the way he's talked so far, I'd think he'd end up convicting himself.&quot;</p>
