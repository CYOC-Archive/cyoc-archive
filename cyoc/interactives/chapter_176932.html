<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You wake up feeling light headed and weak. Not the weakness you felt last night that felt like you ran a marathon and then collapsed, no you felt weak like a strength you had come to expect being there was just gone. Opening your eyes you&#39;re not in the room at the castle, but that doesn&#39;t mean the room is unfamiliar. It takes you a moment to place it though. This is your room in your old apartment back on Earth.<br />
<br />
You sit up with a bit of a groan, a wave of dizziness passing over you for a moment. As the sheet falls off of you, you look down in mild disappointment. The body you got in the other world was gone to. You were back to your smaller, much more slender self. Had it been a dream? You never had a dream that vivid or long before. You could remember all of it, even some dreams you had in that dream.<br />
<br />
Sounds reach your ears, and the smell of something cooking. There&#39;s cheery humming coming from the kitchen. You live alone. Carefully you slip out of bed and go to take a peek. The sight you&#39;re greeted with almost causes you to fall over in shock, and also causes your cock to suddenly spring to attention. There is your body from the other world, standing in the kitchen and making pancakes.<br />
<br />
Had you really been so huge. The man in the kitchen was easily six and a half feet tall, a whole head taller than you and probably twice your weight. He wore only a pair of boxer briefs as he cooked, giving you a good look at his muscles and the forest of curly golden hair along his chest, the short trimmed beard along his square jaw, and the massive bulge that filled the front of his shorts as he turned off the stone and set a few more pancakes on a waiting stack.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, babe.&quot; He said in a deep, rich voice as he noticed you watching him, smiling as his eyes ran over your body. You realized you were naked, and blushed. You had gotten too used to that other world and it&#39;s loose ideas. &quot;Hope you don&#39;t mind I made breakfast.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.. not at all..&quot; You stammer out as you step into the apartment&#39;s small kitchen. He wraps an arm around you and pulls you close, lips meeting yours in a long kiss that makes your knees go a little weak.<br />
<br />
&quot;Surprised you&#39;re walking so well how you rode my cock last night.&quot; He jokes once he breaks the kiss, giving one of your nipples a little tweak. That would certainly explain the soreness you think as you look down to eye his package. Without thinking you groped it through the thin fabric of his underwear, feeling it start to stiffen, pushing down the elastic waistband.<br />
<br />
You find yourself suddenly up against the kitchen wall, up off the floor and supported only by your mysterious guest&#39;s strength. You feel the head of that giant cock pressed up against your hole then gasp as you feel yourself lowered onto it. You expect it to hurt, something that large going in completely dry, but it&#39;s almost like you&#39;re back in the other world where this is how things are supposed to work. You feel stretched and full, but there&#39;s little pain. He begins to roughly thrust into you, holding you up against the wall with his muscles taught as he fucks you.<br />
<br />
All you can do is hold on to those muscular shoulders and enjoy the ride. You moan as your own cock explodes between your bodies, cum dribbling down your shaft, but he keeps going for several more thrusts before you feel that gigantic cock twitching inside you, flooding your inside with his hot seed. You kiss again, his beard tickling your face.<br />
<br />
After a moment he pulls out and gently lowers you back to the ground. &quot;Pancakes?&quot; The question seems almost silly with both of you panting and sweaty, but you just nod. You don&#39;t even know what name to call this guy. He was you! Is it Alex, too? You make your way over to one of the two chairs at the small table, smiling as he sets a plate of pancakes in front of you and another at the other seat. Two cups of coffee and syrup are placed on the table before he seats himself.<br />
<br />
You both eat in silence for a bit, until he speaks up, reaching out to put one of his huge hands over yours. &quot;You know. I really liked last night, and uh..&quot; he looks over to the wall you were pressed up against not long ago.. &quot;this morning. I know this was probably supposed to be a one night stand but I&#39;d like to see you again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I&#39;d like..&quot; You start but then everything seems to wash out and stop, the world turning grey and frozen, except for you.<br />
<br />
&quot;You really do take getting shunted between worlds rather well.&quot; The voice was masculine and teasing, and coming from nowhere.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who?&quot; You look around, trying to find a source for the voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m the god that sent you to that other world, and brought you back to this one. Meljin. God of trickery and transformation, at your service.&quot; You could almost hear a bow in those words.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why are you doing this?&quot; You stand up out of your chair and start looking around, but all you see is your tiny apartment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Boredom, mostly. And you&#39;ve been a wonderfully amusing little toy. This went better than I expected, I mean look at that body you had for yourself. Woof.&quot;<br />
<br />
You do look the body over. The thought of having been that man.. you feel a twinge of jealousy to be outside of it now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Since you have been so good, I want to offer you a choice! Choice number one! I give you back this very sexy body and return you to that other world, along with a fun little blessing of mine that you might enjoy, but that&#39;ll be a secret until you pick it. Of course, there&#39;s lots of transformation magic in the world courtesy of yours truly, so who knows what will happen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Choice two, I give you this. I promise this man will be the perfect boyfriend for you, the two of you will have a long happy life together, but this isn&#39;t your home. It&#39;s another world that&#39;s pretty close, you&#39;d figure out the differences soon enough. But you&#39;ll also have to go through a change of my choice, also a secret until you pick it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Third. I give you back sexy body here and send you home, I find myself a new play thing and we part ways. You get this body as your prize.&quot; For some reason, it feels like he&#39;s leaving something out of that last one, you don&#39;t know what, but he is a god of trickery. Hell, all three could be booby traps or just more twists in his little game. Maybe you could even try to strike your own deal, but myths are full of people trying to outsmart gods and ending up the worse for it.<br />
<br />
With no where else to look you look across the table into the face that was yours for only one evening.</p>
