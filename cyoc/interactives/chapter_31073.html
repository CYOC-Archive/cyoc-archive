<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><P> “My teddy…it won’t come off,” Ginger said as she began to tug at the riffled shoulder strap. She tried to get her nails under the strap, but it held tight to her shoulder. She kept clawing at it but she could not manage to get her fingers under the straps. She moved her hands to her bust line, but it was the same story. She could not get her fingers under it. “This is really creeping me out,” the once confident Ginger said in an increasingly nervous and scared voice.

<P>Michelle and Heather were shocked. They did not know how to respond. They just kept watching a little confused. “How can your lingerie be stuck on you? It doesn’t make sense,” Heather said walking toward the girl and reaching for the shoulder strap. She tried to grab under it, but she could not get under the ruffles. It was very odd. “Dam it! It is stuck to your skin. How did this happen?” Heather took a step back and looked at her friend. 

<P>Ginger was now trying to reach her crotch with no success. “That’s what I want to know,” Ginger cried out. She was getting a little panicked as she tried desperately to get the lingerie off. 

<P> “That’s weird…the fabric doesn’t look sheer anymore,” Michelle commented. She was quiet and little stunned. Her voice was soft and meek as she stared at Ginger. She was wearing the same brand after all. Would this happen to her next?

<P> “My legs… they feel weak…” Ginger complained as she stopped struggling and began to teeter backward. Her heels were not helping the matter. The large platform stilettos only worsened her balance. The final straw was when kept backing up, and backed up over her masturbating friend Lucy, who was still in a fluster and barely even complained. Maybe it was the fact that as she fell back and landed on the bench, her shoes came off. They simply slid off as her feet appeared to disappear. “Alright. This just got seriously fucked up. I am fucking freaking out here,” Ginger screamed as she stared at her bare ankles. Her legs ended in smooth, bare caps of skin.

<P> “It looks like it is spreading up…” Michelle whispered as she stared in amazement at Ginger. If one looked long enough, they could see her legs slowly receding. It was becoming much more obvious as it reached half way to her knee. Ginger’s face said she was scared, and she cursed a lot, but she was not breathing heavy or showing any signs of being physically scared. 

<P> “Shit, we have got to get help. I will go find a salesgirl or something,” Heather said as she herself was getting a little panicked, but it still felt a little empty. As if she was concerned, but she was not going to get too concerned. The Island was having a definite effect on things like this and none of the girls noticed. “Dam it Lucy. Quit fucking yourself and get up. Ginger is in trouble!”

<P> “Don’t leave me you guys. I don’t want you to leave me here! I can’t walk!” Ginger begged her friends. 

<P> “Wha… oh sorry, I got carried away…” Lucy stopped playing with the Cynthia dildo for a moment. “This thing can be really addicting,” Lucy commented as she got up, and as she did, she saw Ginger’s legs which were now gone to the knee. “Holy shit, what the fucked happened?”

<P> “We don’t fucking know. All we know is that this is fucked up and no one knows what is going on!” Heather told her friend in a loud yet not truly panicked voice. “Alright… we will stay with you… but I don’t see how that will help,” Heather said as she crossed her arms and merely watched.

<P>Ginger’s legs were picking up speed now, and her thighs were almost gone. The group merely watched silently as her disappearing legs reached the leg openings of her green teddy. Her legs kept receding until the area were her legs should have sprouted were flat. Two perfect flat patches of skin where her legs should have been coming out of the teddy. It stayed like that for a surreal, speechless moment before the leg holes began to fill in. Green, now opaque, not sheer fabric began to fill in the frill lined circle. With in a moment they were complete filled and a large ribbon bow actually appeared in the center of the circle. It was like Ginger never had any legs, and her lingerie was specially cut for it. 

<P> “Well that was fucked up. How are you feeling Ginger?” Lucy asked as she stared at the ruffle-lined circles where her legs should have been. Cynthia was still hanging out of her cunt.

<P> “I feel fine… except my legs are gone. I even felt a tingle while it happened… kind of like what you described,” Ginger explained. She was a little too calm for someone who lost her legs, but panic was becoming something alien to them.

<P> “Well, is it done? I mean, is that all?” Heather asked as she looked down at her friend. “I got to say, despite the fact you don’t have legs. It looks a little… hot… for some weird reason. How come we stopped freaking out?” Heather asked, noticing that they all seemed fine with everything now. They all thought it was weird… when they actually noticed. 

<P> “Yea, it was like that with Cynthia. When I was picking up the pieces I was flipping out. I thought I was going to need counseling, but then after she got molded and the woman put her into my cunt, I felt as if it were normal. That it was just something normal that happens to girls,” Michelle commented. “I think it is the Island. It is making us think that weird stuff is normal. It is probably why we don’t mind being nude in front of each other,” she commented as she gestured to Heather’s and Lucy’s bare pussies. 

<P> “I guess so… but is it really that bad? I was kind of having fun,” Lucy suggested. “I mean, I like this waist, my tits, and I don’t really mind if I am naked… so does it matter. I mean, if we don’t care about this stuff, why should we get so worked up over it. We feel fine so let’s enjoy life.”

<P>“Well that doesn’t change what just happened to Ginger. Is she done or is there more?” Heather rebutted to Lucy.</p>
