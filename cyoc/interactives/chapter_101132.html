<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty pressed the shutter button, and there was a flash of light. On the screen was a picture of the family. Only one thing was strange about it. After the flash faded away, the family of six stayed exactly where they were, not a muscle moving.<br />
<br />
Smiling at the scene, Ty made a quick wish and suddenly heard the voices of each family member in his head, and they, were, panicking! Listening to the cacophony, Ty started weeding out the voices. First to go were the two youngest, their panic was more or less just crying, so he wished that he wouldn&#39;t hear their voices in his head. Next were the adults, as much fun as it was to listen to the father and wife&#39;s rampant gibbering, they weren&#39;t dealing with it well enough to form coherent thoughts, so he cut them out of his head. That left the two teens minds. Concentrating on the boy, Alex was what his family called him if Ty remembered right, he found a surprisingly calm mind. &quot;Why?&quot; The single thought, rang through his head, laced with malevolence. Starting, Ty sharply glanced around, before his eyes settled back on the frozen boy. &quot;I know it&#39;s you... I know you can hear me and I&#39;ll let you know this, you will regret interfering with me whe---&quot;. Shuddering at the pure hatred in the voice, Ty wished for Alex&#39;s mind to freeze along with his body. The voice went silent. &quot;Some things,&quot; Ty reflected, &quot;You just don&#39;t risk.&quot; This was one of those cases.<br />
<br />
Quickly recovering from his encounter, Ty turned his mind&#39;s ear to Susie and was quite pleased with what he found. She was panicked, oh she was definitely panicked, but she was forcing her mind to stay calm as she walked herself through the situation, &quot;Alright, stay calm&quot;, he heard her mentally murmur, &quot;So I can&#39;t move, but I can see that neither can my family from what I can see. I can barely even see, I can&#39;t even move my eyes. My eyes, why can&#39;t I move my eyes. Oh my god I&#39;m not breathing, how am I okay, I&#39;m not breathing, I can&#39;t move my eyes.&quot; Deciding to get her off that topic, Ty lets her move her eyes. &quot;Oh, my eyes moved! Ok, ok, maybe things will be ok. I just need to calm down. Calm down. Now what happened exactly. That kid took the picture, and we suddenly couldn&#39;t move. The kid&#39;s still there, not surprised at all, and is watching us, so it&#39;s probably his fault.&quot; Ty arches his eyebrows at this deduction, and at the fact that she&#39;s already thinking clearly.<br />
<br />
Taking a step back, Ty surveys Susie closer. When he said cute earlier, he meant it. She&#39;s not someone that you would describe as beautiful, nor attractive by any normal standard of the definition, but definitely as cute. Despite all of this, Ty found himself attracted to her and eying her body, wondering what might be beneath her clothes. With a grin, Ty wishes that nobody will notice anything strange and approaches Suzie. As he approaches her, her thoughts become somewhat fearful, &quot;Oh crap hes coming closer and hes looking at me. I hope he&#39;s not going to do anything else, wait maybe he&#39;s going to fix this! That would be good.&quot; As her thoughts rambled on in the way thoughts do, Ty faced her and winked, much to her confusion, before approaching behind her. As a teenager, Suzie had naturally shied away from her family somewhat during the picture, so Ty had no difficulty getting behind her and patting her on the back much to her confusion. Then, grinning, Ty pulled a pocket knife out of his pocket and carefully split the back of her shirt down the middle. Next he did her pants, careful not to let her know what was happening. &quot;What is he doing?&quot; Suzie wondered silently as she felt movement behind her, then she gasped (or would have had she been able) as Ty&#39;s hands rubbed her exposed back. Ty&#39;s hands explored her upper back before hopping the bra strap and wriggling down to where her pants were supposed to be. Her thoughts once again turned fearful as she realized the only fabric between his hands and her butt was merely her underwear. She panicked as the hands stroked her small but toned butt before arcing over the rim of her panties and pulling down, leaving her rear exposed to the air. Ty of course went right to work stroking the smooth skin of her butt before moving his hands upwards again. Taking the knife in hand once again, Ty slashed the sleeves and removed the back of the shirt so the front was only just resting on her. Running the knife along the pant legs, he did much the same to those. Circling around to her front and wriggling his eyebrows towards her terrified eyes, Ty slowly pulled off the sheet of fabric that used to be a shirt draped over the slim girl before tossing it aside. Rubbing her exposed chest, he stroked downwards before grabbing and removing her pants, leaving her in only her underwear and her shoes. Stooping down to inspect the footwear, Ty is momentarily stumped, before simply wishing that her shoes and socks would be removed, leaving her barefoot. Returning to the terrified teen&#39;s upper body, Ty hefts her breasts gently through the bra before dropping his hands to stroke her inner thighs, teasing her helplessness. Finally ending the torture, he reaches behind her and fiddles with the clasp of the bra, then fiddles some more, before giving up and slashing through the band with his knife. Removing the garment perniciously, Ty strokes the supple flesh as Susie mentally shudders at what&#39;s happening. More expeditiously, Ty reaches towards her panties and slashes them in half, leaving his poor victim completely in the nude.<br />
<br />
Of course, Ty isn&#39;t going to shy from this opportunity and gropes, molests, and otherwise feels up the vulnerable girl as she mentally whimpers through it. Ty takes his time thoroughly enjoying the feel, but also the mental agony he can hear Susie going through mentally. Smiling, Ty decides that it&#39;s been enough and takes a step back before considering his next step. He has an infinity of possibilities in front of him, but suddenly he doesn&#39;t want to go through them alone. The question then is, how is he going to force Susie to join him.</p>
