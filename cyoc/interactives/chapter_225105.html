<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Charlotte tossed herself on her bed, too tired to take off her clothes or undo her updo. Still within the twilight hours of day 2 in her chaotic version of No Nut November, Charlotte mused to herself before falling asleep. &quot;The girls at work were surprised to see me with all this hair, especially when they realized that it was real and not a wig. Here hoping that Nancy can get me a permission slip so that I won&#39;t be unemployed due to these bots. Speaking of Nancy, it was nice of her to get me a hairstylist at such short notice. However, I do feel bad for leaving Roxie without talking to her or at the very least paying her for her service. I guess I can ask Nancy to take me to her when this is over.&quot; Then her musing became mumbling which soon led to snoring, right before the clock turned to the eleventh hour.<br />
<br />
As the sleeping woman with the very long hair rolled about in her sleep, time moved forward until it had become the third day of the month. As the grandfather clock heralds the new day by dinging its bells twelve times, the nanomachines start to work on the unconscious Charlotte.  The changes first start with an impressive haircut. It did it by releasing all the hair follicles on Charlotte&#39;s head so that she was temporarily bald.<br />
The remains of the previous day&#39;s transformation were freed from Charlotte&#39;s control and then kicked off the bed when Charlotte tossed a little too much. As the lump of hair fell, brand new hair began to grow once more but in a more vibrant color palette. The newer hair has developed a greener tint while also shifting to a much lighter tone, giving Charlotte a natural, light green hair color. Likewise, the hair growth soon stopped when it gave her a short amount of hair as compared to yesterday&#39;s insane growth, shorter than Charlotte&#39;s preferred length that reaches her chin.<br />
<br />
When that finished, the nanomachines moved ahead to affect the rest of Charlotte&#39;s body. As the night moved on, the nanomachines began to steadily reduce Charlotte&#39;s height. While she wasn&#39;t small compared to other women, Charlotte was steadily moving away from her normal height of 5&#39;6&quot;. The clothes that Charlotte wore yesterday were becoming looser and bellowing out even more, with her limbs getting shucked inside multiple layers of fabric.<br />
As Charlotte becomes more height-impaired, the nanomachine has begun to grow some new appendages on her back. Six little growths soon burst out behind Charlotte, who had turned to face down on her bed in the middle of her tossing. Each of the growths soon unfurled into one half of an iridescent butterfly wing, with a matching pair across from it. As the little wings spread out, Charlotte&#39;s body shrank even smaller than a child&#39;s.<br />
<br />
If one was watching this transformation, one would see Charlotte&#39;s figure under her bedsheet disappearing. The outer edges reduce away and the central form of Charlotte becomes smaller under her clothes and blankets. Even when she shrank even smaller than a baby, Charlotte was still fast asleep with her new wings flapping about in an attempt to fly. The final feature that the nanomachines left her before turning off for the day is to give Charlotte some elven features and some pointy ears too. <br />
As dawn approached, Charlotte stirred for the final time before her alarm clock screeches out at her. Not wanting to open her eyes, the shrunken lass flails about to silence her alarm. Realizing that she can&#39;t turn off her alarm by swinging her arm, Charlotte opens her eyes. What threw her for a loop when she opened her eyes was how big everything was. The clothes that she shrank out of look like they belong to a giant, and the bed that she was standing on looks more like a barren plain on a bouncy planet.<br />
<br />
Now extra worried about how much she changed, Charlotte ran toward her phone which was still blasting out her alarm. But while running, the six wings on Charlotte&#39;s back began to flutter and then skyrocketed the transformed girl up in the air. Now screaming in a higher pitch than before, Charlotte zoomed around her room until she managed to get a handle on her flight. &quot;This, this is unbelievable,&quot; gasping Charlotte in her new squeaky voice. &quot;I have to call Nancy! She can help me out!&quot; <br />
Trying to fly down to her phone, Charlotte turns her head around to see the newest addition that the nanomachines gave her. Charlotte grew wide-eyed at the six wings on her back, shining and shimmering in the morning sun. When Charlotte made it to her blaring phone, with its screen being almost as tall as her, Charlotte managed to turn off her alarm. Now that the phone had been silent, Charlotte went to her contracts and called up Nancy.<br />
<br />
But due to how small and squeaky her voice had become, Nancy was having a hard time trying to understand her friend. &quot;Wait a minute, you have turned into dairy? Or was it a berry? I can barely understand you. I&#39;m going to come over and see what happens to you.&quot; Just now realizes that her friend is coming over and she is still nude, Charlotte panics and zips over to her closet to see what she can wear. The unfortunate thing was that she had closed the door to her closet yesterday and her current strength isn&#39;t strong enough to pull the door open.<br />
Now panicking even more, Charlotte flew her way to the front room to see if there was anything that she could cover herself. &quot;If only I had dolls to take clothes off or I had some spare fabric to turn into clothes.&quot; Charlotte zips around the room but finds nothing for her to wear. Nothing except for her potted plant by the window. After debating on wearing leaves as clothing or risking being naked, Charlotte sighed to herself, flew up to her plant, and started to pick a few choice leaves out for her new outfit.<br />
<br />
By the time Nancy made it to her friend&#39;s home for the third time in a row, she knocked on the door to be let in. After waiting for a few minutes, with noises behind the door showing that there was someone there, Nancy heard the muffled, high-pitched voice saying, &quot;It&#39;s open.&quot; Nancy let herself in and was about to ask her friend what had happened until she looked up. There, floating in front of her, was a 6&quot; tall, live fairy. <br />
Nancy, while a scientist, loves to read fantasy stories. Especially stories that contain faires in them. So when Charlotte had flown up to her as a fairy, even wearing leaves to cover herself like a forest fae, Nancy squealed with delight. &quot;I didn&#39;t know that my tech could change you into a fairy. I have to take a picture of this, no wait! I need to take a photo shoot of this!&quot; The very concerned Charlotte meekly asked, &quot;I guess you love fairies, don&#39;t you?&quot; Nancy was busy typing in her phone with glee until the question had reached her ear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very much so Charlotte. And if I win the bet, I know just what to turn you into.&quot; Charlotte looked at her smaller and lithe frame, now more determined to win the bet. &quot;But what I don&#39;t understand Nancy is how similar these recent transformations are?&quot; The odd question had made Nancy a slight pause in her typing. &quot;What do you mean?&quot; &quot;Well,&quot; Charlotte zoomed over to Nancy to sit on her shoulder to rest her wings, &quot; The first time was a Furry and the second was Hairy. Now that this time, I&#39;m a Fairy!&quot;<br />
&quot;So? What about it?&quot; asked Nancy while still tapping on her phone. Feeling frustrated at her hyper-focus friend, Charlotte squeaked, &quot;Because there might be a chance that my next transformation may turn me that rhyme with Fairy!&quot; Not skipping a beat, Nancy replied, &quot;You don&#39;t know that.&quot; Now really upset at her friend, Charlotte flapped her wings and flew off from her shoulder to another part of the house. <br />
<br />
Nancy stopped typing on her phone and began to walk around the house to find her shrunken friend. She found her in her room, tapping on her phone that was still by her bed. In an attempt to comfort her elven friend, Nancy said, &quot;How about this Char? To make sure that nothing like this happens, and to make sure that you can take care of yourself, I will move in for you for the time being. At the very least, it can reduce the amount of time for me to come over to help you out. How does that sound?&quot;<br />
The micro girl just stared at the bigger girl with tears in her eyes, nodding yes at the idea. She flew up to her face and hugged herself against one side of her face, with Charlotte&#39;s face facing Nancy&#39;s single eye. Nancy just smirked at her friend&#39;s attempt and said her favorite quote, &quot;Just think of happy thoughts and you&#39;ll fly.&quot; Charlotte let go and stared at her friend for referencing Peter Pan. &quot;What, I loved that movie when I was a kid.&quot;<br />
Nancy soon got up and made her way to the door with Charlotte&#39;s keys in hand. &quot;Now let&#39;s get out of here. Not only I am going to pack up a few things from my home, but we also need to make a quick stop as well.&quot; &quot;Wait, you don&#39;t mean?&quot; &quot;Yep, we&#39;re going shopping at the toy store to get you some cute outfits. I can say that you are my doll while shopping and afterward,&quot; Nancy faced her nervous fairy friend with her wings twitching behind her, &quot;we are going to have some fun.&quot;</p>
