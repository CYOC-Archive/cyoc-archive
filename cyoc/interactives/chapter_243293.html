<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Invite her over”, I offered, with an afterthought, as I admired Jake’s butt while he was now going around my oversized bed to gather his underwear. He froze in his tracks.<br />
“You’re, joking, right?”<br />
“I mean, she knows about me, right?”<br />
“She knows about a guy. She doesn’t know about the neighbour. Or you, specifically.”<br />
I shrugged.<br />
“Still, don’t change your plans for me. I’ll be there when she leaves, and you should shower first.”<br />
Jake took a moment to look at my naked self, bit his lips and started pulling up his hideous underwear.<br />
“It’s not that I’m ashamed or anything. I just don’t know how she’ll react.”<br />
“I know. You love her, and she loves you back. This.” I pointed at the two of us. “This is carnal. Unless that changed, in which case we should discuss about it.”<br />
<br />
Jake seemed to reflect for a second, his massive body stuck mid-movement with his arms in the sleeves of his shirt. “Nah, you’re right, bud. You’re just a nice cock.” I laughed at what I presumed was a tease. I knew we still weren’t friends in this new dynamic, but I believe I am worth more than just my member.<br />
<br />
I slapped Jake’s but as he went off my door, then went to my room to pick up the book I started reading a few days ago. The temptation to upgrade my apartment was there, but I first wanted to unfold this step of my not-so-developed plan. I could hear Jake showering, then vacuuming his apartment, thanks to the paper-thin walls. About an hour after he left, the door from the stairwell creaked open. I put my book aside and opened the system HUD. I had a bit of time to fiddle with it and get used to it a bit more. I started by changing Jake’s underwear with various types, shapes and colors of sexy jocks, thongs and others, than I explored the area around our building. I was now rather efficient in observing our floor plan from the bird-view. I selected Aarav as she was halfway between the staircase and Jake’s door. Everything froze, as I selected her. Fist stop, the gender section, where I made her a man. I adjusted other parameters accordingly, annoyed that the UI didn’t. I made sure to make her - him - a top, otherwise the rest changed in a similar way as for Jake. I didn’t tick attraction to women either.<br />
<br />
When I went back to his main profile, instead of the petite south-asian woman with long silky raven hair was a slim and toned man with the same rich and dark complexion. I changed his eyes to an emerald green, and gave him a short beard to compliment what I could only qualify as a bad boy look. He seemed to be a bit younger than Jake, but nothing drastic. He was currently wearing loose pants and a form-fitting tanktop. As I did before for his fiancé - They still were, I checked - I changed his clothing tendencies to prefer sexier underwear - the bulge enhancing kind, rather than the butt-emphasized ones that Jake now like. It is then that I noticed his tattoos, almost hidden by his hairy body. I trimmed his hair distribution to highlight the tattoos rather than conceal them. Some seemed really cool and intricate. I couldn’t tell for sure how tall Aarav now was. He had been a small woman and was now a small man too, though taller in this form. I thought about it for a moment. He was probably still smaller than me and for now that worked well with me. As for his hooded dick, it looked fairly large on his frame, though I suspected it was probably average, or not much above average in any case. <br />
<br />
Finally, I went to his Woohoo relationships and added myself as a ‘casual woohoo partner’. So, I assumed, not as regular as Jake. It made sense to me, as Jake is literally a few yards away. I closed the CAS and saw the new Aarav walk to Jake’s door. This is also about when I decided to put some clothes on. I traded the teal brief for a jogging - deciding to go commando - and a t-shirt, and went to do my dishes.<br />
<br />
<br />
When Jake knocked at my door, I smirked to myself. I heard him and Aarav discussing casually as I walked to the door. Told him Aarav’d come over. <br />
“We’re not bothering you?” Jake asked. Then Aarav explained the situation, while Jake did his best to look innocent. “I forgot my notes for my next classes and I thought we could say hi.”<br />
I had a moment of hesitation, as I wondered what classes he was talking about. Then I remember, he was a yoga instructor. “Sure, come in.”<br />
<br />
This time, Jake stood a bit behind as Aarav grabbed me by the neck, tilting it down to be at his height. I knew my larger bed was now our main playroom, as Jake’s room only had a double bed. He kissed me, making sure his beard would tickle my nose, and moved his hands to the waist of my pants, pulling them down without hesitation. A satisfied smile on his face, he ordered me to the bed. “To your room, naughty boy.” I complied, tossing my shirt and pants on my nightstand, soon followed by Aarav, as nacked as I was. We started feeling each other, kissing too. Despite being bigger, Jake seemed to be the more gentle of them. Speaking of, where was he? I looked around to find him feeling himself, in the doorway. He pulled one of my kitchen chair and sat on it. He was biting his lips, again, and I invited him to join us.<br />
<br />
“You know we’re saving ourselves for each other on our wedding night” Aarav scolded me as he slapped my ass. They were still doing that thing? My butt cheek jiggled for a moment and the pain subsided as soon as I felt the smaller man’s tongue playing with my hole. I tensed up for a second, then relaxed. He was good. Some memories came to my mind. They opened their relationship so that they could get some practice before their matrimonial duties. I seem to fit the deal for them both, as they currently only fuck with me.  The tought vanished as fast as it came, when a new wave of pleasure surged through me, from my balls. I groaned and reached for Aarav’s member. He let me have it, positioning himself differently, and we shifted as I started sucking him, while he continued lubing up my ass with his tongue. A feat possible thanks to his practice and years of hard-owned flexibility. <br />
<br />
“Fuck me” I whispered when I felt I had loosened up enough, a tingle constantly resonating in my anus. And I laid on my belly, hips raised, awaiting, demanding for his dick to bless me. Only for Jake’s voice to resonate, softly if not for the cracking in his voice due to his own sexual tension. “On your side, I wanna see your dick, bud!”<br />
<br />
I complied, and Aarav pierced me with eager and passion. He took possession of me in a way I knew I never did to anyone. The indian man is a more aggressive lover than I am. Jake must see it. The same way Aarav must see I am not Jake when it’s our time together. A stifled groan came from Jake as he took his hands out of his pants, clearly unable to take much more. I felt myself panting in rhythm with the warm club massaging my prostate. I felt his pelt brush on my side as I reached out for Aarav’s ass, clamping it, massaging it, lost in my pleasure. My other hand squeezing his, anchoring us in the rhythm.<br />
<br />
“Guys, I…”<br />
<br />
I opened my eyes. When did I even close them. In from of me, behind Aarav’s tattooed arm, Jake was holding onto the doorframe, sloppily slipping on my chair as his other hand was making an obvious movement into his jock. A second later, he stated what was too easy to see, and smell.<br />
<br />
“I came.”<br />
<br />
The HUD had opened and in between two breath I opened Aarav’s profile to make his dick bigger than Jake’s but only erect. A real grower. <br />
<br />
Jake was still watching us fuck, fondling his soft member. I came next, making a mess of my bedsheets. Then Aarav shifted his position again, grabbed me by the hips and thrusted harder. My lumped dicked flailed about, as I moaned in pain and ecstasy, until he released. In me. He kissed on my shoulder, then removed  himself from inside me and kissed my butt cheek before licking my hole one last time. He exhaled deeply, serenely, and I quickly returned his dick to its normal size.<br />
<br />
I was definitely satisfied, and still panting a bit. This software, or whatever it was, was amazing.</p>
