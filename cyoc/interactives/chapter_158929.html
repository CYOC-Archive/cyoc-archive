<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ashley grabbed up the container full of the magical shampoo, noticing that despite its uses already it did not seem to be diminishing in its supply. That...could be useful, if she wanted to turn any more boys into men so to speak. However as she took it up and poised herself on top of the young linebacker, Jacob noticed the container and her putting some of the shampoo on her hands. It pleased her when he seemed to get a wry grin on his face and said, &quot;Babe...that stuff seems like it&#39;ll get me dirty right now rather than get me clean...&quot;<br />
<br />
Ashley leaned in and asked him, &quot;How are you feeling about getting it back up?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Babe...&quot; Jacob said with a dejected chuckle, &quot;Even a stud like me has his limits...just gimme a minute to whew...catch my breath. Then I&#39;ll give you another ride on my dick...&quot; He was obviously starting to feel more confident and cocky even in his sex talk. Which made Ashley feel even better about possibly bettering that.<br />
<br />
She knew she&#39;d need to wash it out to stop the effects, but she figured she could do that at her leisure.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me help you out...trust me, this stuff will work magic on you.&quot; She reached over and Jacob, apparently deciding that he saw no reason not to go for it, leaned up to present his head for her to basically anoint with this shampoo.<br />
<br />
Jacob for his part supposed that this stuff possibly had some sort of aphrodisiac effect mixed in there, some kinda sex shampoo. He&#39;d never had any experience with such a thing, so he was excited to see how it felt. He had little idea of what exactly Ashley had planned for him. And so he was remarkably surprised when, as she started to rub and work the shampoo into his sweat shined hair, he felt his dick get hard again.<br />
<br />
Ashley felt a sense of triumph immediately followed by a sense of great pleasure as Jacob immediately plunged back in and she yielded the position on top to the very turned on young man, hearing him almost reduced to incoherence from how it felt. While Jacob mumbled to her, she noticed things about him, &quot;Fuck babe, I dunno what&#39;s in that stuff...pure viagra? Fuck you gotta lemme get some relief...fuck...&quot;<br />
<br />
She noticed immediately that his already broad shoulders were further filling out, proudly growing further into near on boulder shaped relief, and as she wrapped her arms around his torso, she felt his lats and pecs growing larger and meatier. Ashley realized she might have underestimated the sheer size linebackers tended to acquire to keep up with the rigors of football on the field. And the corresponding sexual virility...!<br />
<br />
She moaned and groaned, choking down louder more pornographic groans as she felt his dick hitting all the right places. Even growing bigger while he was at it. She saw the dark blond hair on his head growing somewhat thicker as he aged, his jawline strengthening and visibly complimenting his aging features. She felt his abs grow tighter and stronger at first, and then push out slightly - a compromise between sheer size and the girth a linebacker needed.<br />
<br />
And Ashley could more than tell that his glutes and legs were strengthening based on how strong he was thrusting away into her. She couldn&#39;t tell how old he was at the moment and, right now, she hardly cared. She just kept urging him onward, whispering sweet nothings in his ear...<br />
<br />
&quot;Babe you turn me on so fucking much...&quot; He now had some visible tough stubble on his face, which Ashley wasn&#39;t much a fan of, but she more than liked the rest of him. She loved how thick and strong he was getting, the compromise between tone and size was a very sexy compromise for her indeed. He kept talking, &quot;Damn, I&#39;ve never felt this strong during the act...how&#39;m I doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Excellent, baby.&quot; Ashley kissed him on the lips and urged him further, no longer paying much heed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmph...&quot; Jacob said as he thrusted away, his increasingly muscled ass pumping in the air, &quot;You&#39;re getting so fuckin&#39; tight on me, its crazy. It&#39;s like I&#39;ve...like I&#39;ve grown or something!&quot;<br />
<br />
And that brought her back to reality. Ashley realized she was leaving the shampoo in there a bit longer than what she&#39;d experienced before, and looking at Jacob, she realized he was quickly approaching thirty. He was still stunningly attractive to her, but Ashley didn&#39;t know how much further she wanted to take him. Either stop this here or...<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooh, big boy...I...oh, I think we need to wash it out of your hair...&quot; Ashley managed to say, impressing at least some degree of seriousness in her statement. She watched him stop pumping his hips for a moment, and the muscled linebacker, now almost definitely an even thirty in age, smirked down at her.<br />
<br />
He of course had no idea he&#39;d even aged at all. He felt amazing, better than amazing. He felt so oddly right for this. It was like he&#39;d picked up experience he&#39;d never known before, naturally found himself hitting the exact right sexual notes. And somehow he figured it started with that &quot;aphrodisiac soap&quot; stuff she did on him. And being that he was feeling so good, he didn&#39;t feel much like stopping now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, babe, let&#39;s finish up and then wash me heh, clean...&quot; Jacob said with a coy grin. Ashley looked at him, wondering how long he&#39;d keep his more boyish looks and when he&#39;d enter more &quot;Daddy&quot; territory. She almost wanted to find out...</p>
