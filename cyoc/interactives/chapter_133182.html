<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">But that music was starting to get to Zossie, she felt it pouring through her body and making her limbs stretch out out and her breasts and ass expand. Her waist became even more perfect as her clothing began to cover more skin and a tie appeared around her neck. Large headphones emerged on her head and the dick vanished from behind her. She shut her eyes and smiled as her hands shot out and began to play with large records, dials, and buttons. She opened them again to find herself at the DJ station in a club with dozens upon dozens of people in front of her. Her smile got very broad as she watched the people on her dance floor having fun while also keeping an eye on the edge where people just listened to the music or drank. The music almost felt like part of her, tendrils of her mind reaching out and connecting to people, reading their emotions and enjoyment and one of these tendrils happened upon a feeling of distress.<br />
<br />
DJ Morpher narrowed her eyes and spotted a couple near the doors having an argument. The guy suddenly reached out and slapped his girlfriend yelling, “Bitch!” In the process. That wasn’t how couples acted, the two should be loving one another and from what she could gather they were just together for the sex, it was pathetic.<br />
<br />
“This next song goes out to the couple near the door!” She announced before tapping a button and allowing a new song to start playing. It had an 8-Bit feel to it and the song sped up and had a massive drop before a heart pounding bit of music started. The couple clutched their foreheads in pain and the girl’s hair began to retreat into her head getting shorter and shorter until it was a well kept and short male haircut with the top flipped upwards. She grew in size, getting taller and broader as muscles expanded on her chest and arms and her breasts deflated into heavenly pectoral muscles. Her eyes shrunk a little, her nose got bigger, her lips slimmed down, and her jawline became shaven and chisled. Her fingers grew in size as her arms bulked out and the sleezy top she had been wearing morphed into a white shirt and a high school football jacket. Her legs expanded and got hairy as hair spread across her chest, arms, and legs while her butt became more solid and masculine. Her underwear became boxers, her skinny jeans became bottom cuts, and her heels turned into simple nice brown shoes. Finally her clitoris pushed outwards accompanied by two testicles as a monster penis formed. The new man stood there with his mouth agape and the music pouring through his ears as his boyfriend went through a similar transformation.<br />
<br />
He shrunk down in height until he was roughly five foot nine and his shoulders immediately crashed inwards while his arms slimmed and hands became dainty. The fingernails expanded and had a gloss of polish put on them while his hips grew outwards and his ass became round and bubbly. The loose clothes caught on his new waistline as his legs slimmed and his thighs expanded. The feet shrunk several sizes and nail polish applied to the nails as dead skin on the heel vanished. His gut shrunk inward becoming a pleasant hourglass figure as his face began to alter itself. Makeup applied to it as the facial and body hair was sucked back in and eyelashes expanded, eyebrows became trimmed, and the nose shrunk in size. His lips puckered up and had a glaze of frosty pink applied to them as his hair began to expand and fall down around his slim shoulders. It dyed itself blue as glasses appeared on his face and the shirt shifted into a T-shirt with the logo for a classic arcade video game called “Lancer” on it while a bra formed. Breasts began to push outwards into nice C-Cups as the pants changed into skinny jeans coloured a nice dark tone and sneakers with the laces neatly bowed. Finally his underwear changed into nice bikini briefs while his dick was crushed and sucked into his body forming a gaping hole as a vagina formed accompanied by all the rest of the material needed to create babies.<br />
<br />
“Mmmmm, this is my favourite song,” The new girl smiled while closing her eyes.<br />
<br />
“I’ll be right back babe,” the new man replied before they exchanged a kiss and he went to go put his girlfriend’s coat in the coat room. He returned shortly after and they went and got drinks before starting to dance, now a couple since high school. A football player dating a geeky girl who liked retro video games. She’d been his tutor and he enjoyed every aspect of her. She’d Show up to his games and he’d hang at her place during the weekends. Sex was no longer the only thing keeping them together. They danced happily for a while and DJ Morpher smiled at her work as the next song began to play and she adjusted the audio to be perfect.</p>
