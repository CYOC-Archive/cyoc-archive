<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“You gave up!” yelled Sam as he floated in front of a Nate who had been up for maybe 10 minutes at most.<br />
<br />
“We were fucking injured trap on an island in the middle of a cave network which we couldn’t escape from!” Yelled Rose back as she floated in front of Nate who sat looking at the white mass which now was attached to his hips. <br />
<br />
“You should have found a way; we are in this mess because….” started Sam<br />
<br />
“Because of dumb luck.” countered Emiko as she looked at everyone. “I don’t know all of you and those I do know I have known for only a day or so. I should have thought that the ledge couldn’t support all of us but I needed to show you all to confirm that these creatures are real.”<br />
<br />
“And we are becoming them.” said Kelly before shaking her head. “no one is to fault for this…there was no way for anyone of us to know.”<br />
<br />
“There….there has to be a way to fix this.” Said Amanda softly as she sat on her own bench lost in her own sadness.<br />
<br />
“Is there a way out?” inquired Nate<br />
<br />
“No.” stated Sam<br />
<br />
“There has to be.” Countered Nate “If we all work together and look around.”<br />
<br />
“There isn’t one!” snapped Sam as he went chest to chest with Nate, the two of them glaring at each other. The two of them where best friends, but they also tried a lot to out do the other to show the other up. <br />
<br />
“Stop it you two.” Said Rose as she and Taylor swam up and separated their boyfriends.<br />
<br />
“Why don’t you two settle this by simply measuring dicks.” Joked Kenny as all eyes turned to him for a moment. He was making one of his jokes, it was the wrong time for one but that was how he handled stress. “It’s all internal now, I have been told.”<br />
<br />
“This will not be solved by you and I punching it out.” announced Sam as he kept glaring at Nate, over the course of the day that everyone else had been knocked out Sam, Taylor, Mike and Stacy had searched the entire chamber multiple times. Over that time changes had begun to take place on the four of them.<br />
<br />
“We need to pull our heads together and figure something out.” Said Taylor as she looked at her friends, they all looked the same, minus the massive white fish tail which now covered their legs and extended beyond their normal length by at least a 18 inches or more. None of them had changed from the waste up but that could and likely would change.<br />
<br />
Taylor’s hair was becoming ever brighter golden blonde, some of the pure white scales on her “tail” had started to change color. A mixture of different shades of yellow where coming in, most of the tail was still white but multiple patches where a mixture of bright and dull yellow. Her boyfriend Sam was having something similar to her, his already dark hair was becoming darker to almost pitch black which really made his new red eyes stand out. Small patches of black with a few blood red scales where coming in on his tail, however much more of his tail was still white. <br />
<br />
Mike and Stacy where also changing, both where behind Taylor and Sam, but still changes where visible…somewhat. For some reason Stacy had not changed all that much, she now had webbed hand with thin membranes which stretched between her knuckles but her tail at first that seamed to be it. Only a few minutes ago, did some of the scales around one side of her hip started to change to a light tan color with two scales of darker brown mixed in. Mike’s changes where localized around his hips, it almost looked like he was wearing shorts because from the area that would where his knees were up was now colored scales. They were your classic green scales, a mixture of Kelly, forest and other greens but with a heavy focus on the darker forest green color. <br />
<br />
“Yes…we need to escape before we come under their mind control or whatever they do to someone to make them like being this way.” Added Meiko<br />
<br />
Taylor looked around, she didn’t want to admit it but on some levels, she actually liked the idea of being a mermaid, but for a day at most not her whole life.  She knew Rose loved the water and swimming, hell until Taylor got more involved in dance/cheer she was on the swim team with Rose.<br />
<br />
“Meiko…my love why do you think I am brainwashed?” added a new voice as everyone turned to see the silver merman with long black hair had entered the room, the door closing behind him, a few feet behind him was the mermaid doctor coming in to check everyone.<br />
<br />
“Denji, You would never want to be like this?” cursed Meiko as the silver merman, Denji it seemed let out a sigh as he crossed his arms over his bare chest.<br />
<br />
“At first I thought the same, but it isn’t like we have a choice and the more I thought about it the more being a merperson is better.” stated Denji “You get to live in a magical world, full of things to expolore and people to meet, the ocean is amazing there are coral reefs which make the Great Barrier reef look like some slum, we aren’t stuck being a salary men and a salary woman working our lives in some office we are free and….”<br />
<br />
He waved his hand as some blue water began to gather around his fingers. <br />
<br />
“If you work hard, you can learn to do magic…actual magic…it is amazing.” Said Denji<br />
<br />
“Denji you need to remember that skill is very rare among human transformed into merfolk.” Stated the mermaid as she gathered a lot more of that blue energy in her hands. “You may not be able to get as much magic as this but your children will be able to.”<br />
<br />
“We will not be here long enough for that.” Said Taylor as she crossed her arms over her chest. <br />
<br />
“Sure…” said the mermaid with clear knowing in her voice.<br />
<br />
“Denji you and the others are brain washed I am sure of that.” added Meiko “That creature which attached to you has a brain it must have done something to you.”<br />
<br />
“It’s brain, dies almost instantly once the process of joining starts, your brain takes over.” Added the mermaid “There is no way you will believe us, but give it time. I will add, there are some more benefits to what you are becoming, your life span will increase a lot.” <br />
<br />
“Sure…what are merpeople immortal or something?” inquired Mike<br />
<br />
“No…but our average life span is 120 years for males and 130 for females.” Said the mermaid before giving a perverted grin. “Besides, I have heard from almost everyone who was old enough who transformed, sex as a merperson blows away sex as a human.”<br />
<br />
That caught Kelly and Kenny’s attention as the two of them shared a look. <br />
<br />
“Now…once everyone is fully transform we will move on to orientation, that should be in about two to three days.” explained the mermaid “And then you will be ready to start your new life. Doesn’t that sound wonderful?”<br />
<br />
“NO!” yelled a voice as suddenly the mermaid and Denji where thrown back into the wall by a powerful wave of blue magical energy which was brighter then what either Denji or the mermaid had shown. The energy was so strong it actually caused the door to groan a bit as the heavy hinges bent a little before it stopped. All eyes flicked to the source as blue magical energy danced around the persons hand.<br />
<br />
“How…how is that possible you said magic like that is impossible in a turned human?” said Denjo as he looked at the source who seamed just as stunned as everyone else. Beside him the mermaid did the same, but with an even more surprised look on her face.<br />
<br />
“That is too powerful to even come from a natural born merperson….” explained the mermaid doctor as the only answer came to her. “By the seas themselves….there…there is only one answer, they are one of the missing members of our royal house one of those who were taken and sent to the human world by our enemies. This changes everything.”<br />
<br />
Who is the newly found royal?”</p>
