<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rick's fingernails were pink!  And they were long, too!  &quot;What the fuck?&quot; Brendon whispered.  Rick continued to cough.  But his coughs sounded higher pitched now.  They were not nearly as deep and masculine.  Brendon was still looking at his stepfather's altered nails.  Suddenly Rick's hair grew over his hands.  The brown locks grew long and curly, blocking Rick's hands from Brendon's sight.<br />
<br />
Brendon moved around to the front of Rick and tried to lift him up.  Rick did not move, still clutching his head.  After tugging at his hands for a few moments, he finally released Rick's clutch of his head.  Rick's face shot upward and looked back at Brendon.  Brendon nearly fell backwards at what he saw.  The face was not Rick's at all.  Gone was all traces of masculinity.  His face was now rounded, not angled.  He had full lips, long eyelashes, and a thin nose.  His face was completely feminine.  &quot;What?&quot; Rick demanded.  His eyes grew wide at the sound of his voice.  It was high pitched and just as feminine as his face.<br />
<br />
Rick stood up and ran to the mirror in Brendon's room.  He screamed at what he saw.  &quot;What is happening?&quot;  The changes weren't done.  His face and head had changed, as had his hands.  His hips burst through his pants, ripping them into pieces.  He groaned as his waist contracted, causing the remains of his pants and boxers to fall to the ground.  Instinctively, his hands went to cover his penis.  But his penis was much smaller than before, and he needed only one hand to cover it.  &quot;Oh my God!&quot; he groaned, feeling his penis and testicles withdraw inside his body.  He looked at his exposed legs and saw that they were smooth, long, and femininely shaped.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Ah!&quot; he screamed in what sounded like a combination of pleasure and pain.  He removed his hands from his groin and saw that his penis was gone.  He now sported a vagina, and had a finely trimmed line of hair above it.  &quot;I'm turning into a woman!&quot; Rick finally screamed. <br />
<br />
Brendon was looking on in a combination of amazement and horror.  What had done this?  Rick said he did it.  How was that possible?<br />
<br />
Rick was still wearing his lab coat and his shirt.  They looked baggier on him now, though, as his shoulders and stomach had reduced to feminine sizes.  But now the buttons on his shirt flew off in every direction, as the final change took place.  Breasts spewed forth from Rick's chest, completing his change into a woman.  They tore through his shirt, leaving it hanging on each side of his growing mammaries.  His new breasts stopped growing at D cups.  His jaw had dropped as far as it could.  He looked in the mirror and saw no traces of his true self.<br />
<br />
Rick ran his hands all over his body, feeling the smoothness of his skin, feeling the changes that had occurred.  He looked at his face.  His face was not that of a 39 year old woman.  He thought this face could be no older than 25.  Rick slid the jacket and ripped shirt off his frame, leaving himself nude.  He continued to run his hands over his body, and appeared to smile slightly.<br />
<br />
He heard a voice clear itself, and he turned to see Brendon staring at him.  &quot;Rick, what...how?&quot; he asked, still dumbfounded.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know,&quot; Rick said.  His face turned angry once again.  &quot;All I know is that your music wouldn't let me concentrate.&quot;  The music was still going in the background.  &quot;And I spilled some vials, and it created this pink smoke.  That's why I was coughing.&quot;  He turned back to the mirror.  &quot;But I don't know how this happened.&quot;  He smiled once more as he continued to run his hands over his body.  Something inside of him was enjoying this a lot.  Too much, in fact. <br />
<br />
Brendon spoke again.  &quot;Well, shouldn't we try to figure out how to reverse this?&quot;</p>
