<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Moving on from the second church came with some added sense of frustration, as the Chapmans had had the hope of getting the information they needed to deal with Edward Cupple in one go, or at least try to. It would then allow them to move to the Slug Person colony in the hopes avoiding being caught and isolated and turned into Cupple&#39;s slaves the way he had Megan and Jenny. They all knew that together, their link through the &quot;hive mind&quot; would protect them from the magic that was intended to hypnotize them or enslave them in some way, but they also didn&#39;t know how well that would work at night or while they were asleep. Jeff remembered all too easily getting zapped by Cupple&#39;s lightning spell and knew that could easily then be transferred to something like levitation and teleportation. Cupple might not be able to mesmerize them as a group, but he might be able to move them so they&#39;re alone and then mesmerize them one at a time.<br />
<br />
Now, they would have consider trying again later with this past church because the minister was out, and they could only meet with him by coming back on the coming Sunday night. It would mean a second journey and risking running into Cupple again and potentially without any benefit. But they had no other option and could only have the hope that their search would find some form of success that would find a way to defeat Cupple and give them some explanation on how that method would defeat Cupple. This meant that they could only make their way to the next church and hope that the minister was there. Though, it also allowed for some confusion as they moved along, largely because while the Chapman family had gone to their own family church on a regular basis, which was closer to their home, they also didn&#39;t go to every church in town. Thus, there was a bit of wandering as they moved.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what&#39;s the next church we&#39;re headed to?&quot; Lucy asked curiously as they slid along.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think the closest one to us is the Lutheran church,&quot; Whitney commented, &quot;though... I&#39;m not exactly sure on the address.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure we can find it just fine,&quot; Zoe managed after a moment and trying to interject some optimism, &quot;I mean... it&#39;d be hard to miss a church, particularly one that we know is well known.&quot;<br />
<br />
There were a few nods and they continued eyes on their stalks looking about and hoping to see either a steeple or something else that would be indicative of this church. There wasn&#39;t much that was there, but as they came up to an intersection that something came that caught their eyes, though it wasn&#39;t necessarily something that was wanted. The first thing was a &quot;for sale&quot; sign in the grass in front a rather nice-looking one-story home. That wasn&#39;t too much of a problem or issue. The thing that soon presented a problem was the black car pulling to a stop at the street in front of the house. Shortly after it stopped the driver and passengers got out of the car. None of the Chapmans recognized the passengers, they were rather non-descript people, but they did recognize the driver, Edward Cupple, the very man they were trying to find a way to defeat and the man that was the one truly responsible for their transformations into Slug People.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Mrs. Chapman, this is quite a surprise,&quot; Cupple gave a smile, &quot;I was hoping to speak again on the future and what good we can work toward, though, I&#39;m afraid at the moment, I am at work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Enslaving other people,&quot; Lucy shot at the man with her eyes narrowed and while Jeff slid forward to put himself between Cupple and his family.<br />
<br />
&quot;Enslaving?&quot; the first of the two passengers, a man said slowly, &quot;what would a realtor be lying about?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you own this house?&quot; the second person, a woman, asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I&#39;m afraid they might just be confused by something else they&#39;ve run into in the past,&quot; Cupple tried to add to things.<br />
<br />
&quot;Confused!?&quot; Jeff challenged, &quot;you brainwashed two Slug Women and sent them to our home and had them expose us to their magic to turn us into Slug People!&quot;<br />
<br />
This got Jeff wondering if this was more coincidence as Cupple was now going about his normal work as a realtor and showing homes to people wanting to move to town. Regardless, though, it was also something that Cupple was going to try to play to what he wanted from the Chapman family. That was still going to be something that they&#39;d have to be careful with, as these two people might not be important to whatever plans that Cupple had at the present time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Brainwashed?&quot; the woman asked, looking between Jeff and Cupple, &quot;why would a realtor brainwash someone?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Some way to make money?&quot; Cupple managed a joking shrug which made both of them laugh, &quot;but I assure you, I&#39;ve brainwashed no one. As I said, they&#39;re confused over things that have happened in the past. All the various prejudices and hardships that have been put on Slug People over the years. It leaves some mentally... abused.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s such a shame,&quot; the man said, &quot;can you help them?&quot;<br />
<br />
Cupple looked to his two passengers and then to the Chapmans and watched as Jeff spread his arms out and coiled his tail in a way that the male Slug Person would be a fairly intimidating barrier against any direct attack on his family. Jeff only glared back, suspecting some trick on Cupple&#39;s part.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can share my advice, but I cannot do much more than that,&quot; Cupple said to them, &quot;I&#39;m only a realtor and thus can&#39;t provide any medical order for them to get help. The rest is all up to them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The past you refer to is only within the last twenty-four-hour period,&quot; Lucy said pointedly, &quot;you&#39;re talking as though what happened to us happened years ago. You admitted your involvement to us this morning!&quot;<br />
<br />
Grace noted Lucy clinching her fists, as if ready to fight and also noted that neither of the people with Cupple were believing them. She then carefully reached for Lucy&#39;s army and tried to send some thoughts of calm through the hive mind. Cupple&#39;s presence made her nervous, particularly regarding what happened that morning in the house and then outside it, but she also knew that they couldn&#39;t provoke a fight. The passive magic that Slug People had might protect against immediate and massive violent attacks, but it wouldn&#39;t necessarily prevent people from gaining a negative opinion of Slug People, and in this, Lucy&#39;s more combative temperament might not be the best idea.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure where you got that,&quot; Cupple answered, &quot;I&#39;ve had a rather early and a full day of work. The housing market is growing and this appointment was on my schedule for months.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I suggest you go about showing these people the house they may wish to buy and let us be,&quot; Whitney spoke, &quot;We do not want help from you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A pity, then,&quot; Cupple responded and then stepped aside and ushered his passengers onto the driveway in front of the home, &quot;but do keep in mind that I&#39;m always available to help in any way I can. You won&#39;t have a friend like me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Whitney wanted to roll her eyes but managed not to and then slid forward with her children following. As they passed where the car was, she looked back with one eye to see Cupple then leading his passengers to the house and gesturing to it as he did so.<br />
<br />
&quot;That lying,&quot; Lucy growled once they were out of earshot, &quot;I know I he was there...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Or he had some way to project an image of himself or his power,&quot; Grace commented, &quot;we really can&#39;t tell with magic.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Doesn&#39;t change that he&#39;s lying about... everything,&quot; Zoe agreed with Lucy.<br />
<br />
&quot;No argument there,&quot; Grace nodded, &quot;though, I think some of this might be something to get in our heads. Like he knows that an outright fight might attract too much attention that might get him in legal trouble. This... however... let him keep track of things and in a way that wouldn&#39;t present anything criminal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Getting help cannot be soon enough,&quot; Jeff managed with a heavy sigh and they moved on.</p>
