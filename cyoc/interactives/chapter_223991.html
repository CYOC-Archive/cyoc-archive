<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Doctor Stein found that regardless of many of the other changes in the world, some things stayed the same. Life went on and while many of the other things went on that raised stress for everyone. Be it the discovery of a gold nugget on an Australian ranch that had ultimately led to some emails from Australian law enforcement agencies at Horizon offices in Australia and at Lyre on if their suspect had ever come into Horizon to become an Animalian. It was a bizarre event and Doctor Stein was able to report that no one of that description had ever come into Horizon&#39;s Lyre office, or any of the other offices connected with the other colonies. It was odd, but Doctor Stein hoped that this mystery in Australia was ultimately solved.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, Doctor Stein had some of the normal aspects of his work and the work that Horizon often worked on. This then came in when some wildlife rangers from eastern Colorado reported a badly wounded Golden Eagle. From what they reported, the Eagle had been in a territorial fight with another Golden Eagle and had been badly injured as a result of the squabble between the two birds. They guessed that the fight had begun in the air and ended with both spiraling to the ground, dislocating one Eagle&#39;s wings, and in a way that it wouldn&#39;t fly again. Mostly as a local rancher found the Eagle walking and holding its wings in an unnatural position before calling in the game, fish, and parks officers to report the injured Eagle. The report was thus that the Eagle, named Arlette by the wildlife officials, had two options, permanent residence in a wildlife sanctuary where she would be safe, but would likely never fly again, or being uplifted would have to adapt to Animalia&#39;s edicts and Human law, but would recover enough to fly again. The rangers chose the option that would let Arlette fly.<br />
<br />
“She’ll fly?” one of the rangers asked to Doctor Stein as he readied a small dish of water that had the Animalia Virus added to it while they guarded the plastic crate that had Arlette in it.<br />
<br />
“Yes,” Doctor Stein assured them, “this would go quite like those who have converted from Human to Animalian to regain lost limbs and the like. Earlier we had a woman come in and became a Saltwater Crocodile Animalian to get her hands back. So while Arlette here still has her wings, the uplifting will restore the appropriate ligaments and attachments so that she can fly.”<br />
<br />
“It won’t hurt her… will it?” another ranger asked, sounding nervous.<br />
<br />
&quot;Generally, the transformation into an Animalian isn&#39;t painful,&quot; Doctor Stein spoke calmly as he stood away from the water dish and noting the noticing the concern by these men, &quot;she might have some... unease as her wings heal, but it shouldn&#39;t be painful. More an &quot;odd&quot; feeling, not pain.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; the ranger answered and then carefully lifted the latch to the container.<br />
<br />
The gate easily swung open, and Doctor Stein could see on how broad it was. It was essentially a super-sized pet carrier, likely built for a large dog like a Great Dane or a Saint Bernard and was mostly used because of the injuries to the Eagle&#39;s wings. While Arlette more than fit in the container, the enlarged size was to make it easier for her to hop in or out with her wounded wings. Even with things being put back together, Doctor Stein could see some measure of an odd angle of the Eagle&#39;s wings and figured that the larger case was for the comfort for those wings as they presently were.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;d best head out,&quot; Doctor Stein then said to the two wildlife officers, &quot;the water bowl is on the floor, and I&#39;m sure she may show some interest in it... but if she is a wild eagle, she may be nervous with us all in here. And once she is uplifted... she will also recognize the need for clothing and so on. It&#39;s something that all uplifted Animalians have gained as part of the process.&quot;<br />
<br />
They then went outside and Doctor Stein calmly shut the door behind them as they left. From there, all they could do was wait.<br />
<br />
&quot;How long will it take?&quot; the first wildlife officer asked while noting a Horizon technician coming up and carrying some clothing in her arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Once the Eagle drinks from the water, the transformation should happen quickly,&quot; Doctor Stein answered, &quot;the real question will be on whether or not she is thirsty, and there we may have to wait until she does drink.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that&#39;d be something we can&#39;t predict,&quot; the second wildlife officer nodded.<br />
<br />
From there they could only wait quietly until after some time there came knock from the inside. That drew all attention to the door and eventually a soft female voice came through the door, though it was faint.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello?!&quot; came the voice, &quot;is anyone out there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Doctor Stein said to the closed door, &quot;you are Arlette?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is what the rangers called me while I was in the box and my wings hurt,&quot; the voice, Arlette, answered, &quot;but now... things are different and I&#39;m different. They mentioned something about a place called &quot;Animalia...&quot; Is that...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is what you are now,&quot; Doctor Stein answered, &quot;an Animalian. From what I&#39;ve been told, you&#39;d sustained injuries that couldn&#39;t be fully healed and uplifting you into an Animalian was the only way that would allow you to fly again. I would answer more questions, once we get you dressed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because Humans wear clothes?&quot; Arlette asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;In public, yes,&quot; Doctor Stein answered, &quot;and so do Animalians.&quot;<br />
<br />
From there, Arlette got dressed and thanked the game wardens for their help and at least getting her wings in a position where her battle with the other eagle hadn&#39;t been enough to kill her. The wardens and Doctor Stein found her polite, but also rather honest and very open, which then gave Doctor Stein an idea.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re wanting to hook me up with someone?&quot; Arlette asked him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not as in a date or a potential mate,&quot; Doctor Stein told her, &quot;as the male Golden Eagle Animalian has had a bit of bad luck in dealing with his own past. You might have the sort of personality that would put him at ease, and he, in turn, can help you adjust to being an Animalian.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Arlette answered, &quot;what is his name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s going by the name Dario, now,&quot; Doctor Stein answered, &quot;and if I can make a call... he&#39;ll be here shortly.&quot;<br />
<br />
And indeed, he was. Arlette noted he seemed a bit nervous as he came into the waiting room and so she was slow in her approach.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, you&#39;re Dario, right?&quot; Arlette asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Dario answered, eying the two game wardens who had stuck around, if only for Arlette&#39;s safety. Particularly as she&#39;d also explained that the fight had between her and a male Golden Eagle, who already had a mate and had been raising their latest hatchlings and saw Arlette as a yearling as an intruder and a threat to his hatchlings before they became independent the next calendar year.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Arlette, I was recently uplifted after I got into a bit of a fight with an established pair of Eagles,&quot; Arlette explained, &quot;these two wardens were among those who rescued me. You don&#39;t need to worry. They just want to make sure no one would come after me... It&#39;s how I got my wings dislocated before my uplifting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And they&#39;re not looking to send me away?&quot; Dario answered, his eyes never wavering from the two game wardens.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you broken any law in the US?&quot; the first ranger asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;NO!&quot; Dario said defensively, making both rangers rub their ears a little.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then you needn&#39;t worry,&quot; the first ranger nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just be friendly and patient with Arlette,&quot; the second ranger added, &quot;she&#39;s looking for a friend and someone who can help her in a world that is entirely new to her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dario blinked, tilted his head and then noticed the small smile on the lips behind Arlette&#39;s beak. Strangely, that was enough to put him more at ease. He wasn&#39;t sure on how he was going to explain to Arlette his &quot;leanings,&quot; but he did feel strangely at ease.</p>
