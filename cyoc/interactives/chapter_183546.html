<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>long chapter, but planned it before the other branch appeared. DM me if you wanna give ideas for future chapters, love hearing feedback</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After cleaning up, the two got dressed. Ethan&#39;s boxers felt really strange against his flat crotch, and he noticed that Haylee was holding her panties in her hand instead of wearing them, and he gave her a questioning look as they sat again on her bed. She shrugged and chuckled. &quot;What, you expect me to put them on? There&#39;s no way this thing,&quot; she patted her groin, &quot;is gonna squeeze inside these. I&#39;d tear a hole through them. Hell, they&#39;ll fit YOU better than they&#39;ll fit me.&quot;<br />
<br />
A devious look crossed her face. &quot;In fact, why don&#39;t we do that -- give you the full feminine experience?&quot; She opened the same drawer as earlier and pulled out four more clean pairs of panties. Three were plain white and pink, and the fourth was sexy black-lace lingerie and she held them out to him. &quot;Let&#39;s make it more fun. You gotta wear these to school, for the rest of the week, and the black one last, on Friday. You&#39;re a chick where it counts, and I&#39;m a dude.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ethan hesitated, but then he took the panties, a weird determination filling him. &quot;Okay,&quot; he nodded, &quot;but if I have to secretly be like a girl, then you- ... you have to wear boxers or go commando, and ... pee standing up. Even if you&#39;re in a stall, and if you&#39;re outside and can get away from people, you gotta find a place and do it like a guy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Haylee stared at him in mild surprise, but she began to smirk and quickly nodded back. &quot;You&#39;re an interesting one Ethan, and I like that! You drive a hard bargain, but that&#39;s a cool -- we have a deal! So, let&#39;s agree on some rules, just so we&#39;re clear where we stand: survive four days as the opposite sex. You&#39;ll have the ring and I can txt you, so if anything goes super wrong for either of us, there&#39;s always the option to emergency swap back as a &#39;get out of jail free&#39; card. ALSO ... my parents are gone on Friday night and my brother is gonna be at some stupid frat dude-bro party. I was gonna go out with some of the girlfriends, but ... I&#39;d much rather stay in and give you a big thank-you for all of this. Seriously, Ethan. You are fucking hung and ever since I swapped with Greg, I kept thinking about trying out something a lot bigger and better ... just like yours. It&#39;s gonna be an interesting few days living with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ethan blushed at the boldness of her compliment, and Haylee winked flirtatiously, enjoying making him squirm a bit. &quot;So do you think you&#39;d be free to come over for the evening on Friday?&quot;<br />
<br />
Somehow, he knew that she was inviting him over for more than just a &#39;thank you&#39;, as she&#39;d made her interest in him very clear. Still, Haylee seemed to actually be into him and a lot of fun, and despite his cock&#39;s apparent reputation -- most of which was news that Ethan was learning about recently himself -- he didn&#39;t have tonnes of experience with girls. He was very tempted by her offer, and if he thought about it ... there&#39;d be a way to make sure Eric was taken care of, and his dad were kept busy, so he could enjoy whatever it was that was going to happen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I think I can manage that.&quot; He grabbed his car keys and stood. &quot;I should go home though. If I don&#39;t catch you at school, then Friday?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep, Friday.&quot; She giggled, waving, getting in a last teasing comment about his new gender as he exited her room. &quot;See you then ... lovergirl.&quot;<br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
Monday night was spent mostly with it at the back of his mind, and Ethan went about things as normal. It was on Tuesday morning when the swap jumped to his attention -- or more accurately FAILED to -- and he woke up without his normal morning hardon. Going to pee, he almost raised the lid, but caught himself and instead sat down. Relaxing, he let go and stared at the toilet door as the liquid tinkled into the bowl, his face colouring as his mind adjusted to it. &quot;I chose this. This is me for the rest of the week,&quot; he muttered to himself. Releasing the pressure on his bladder through his new anatomy felt strangely good though, and he wiped himself before flushing.<br />
<br />
Wearing panties was more distracting than he expected. They were surprisingly close fitting and comfortable, but for Ethan it was more than that. There was a heightened feeling of being different and for his first couple of lessons that day, he was very on edge. Even though he KNEW he was a boy, the feeling that, technically speaking  he was functionally a girl and was wearing the underwear of one, was a thrilling secret. He was scared, but excited. He kept wondering what people would say if they found out, how his swim team mates would react if they discovered it.<br />
<br />
When practice actually arrived, Ethan&#39;s heart was hammering like crazy as he went to get changed. This wasn&#39;t the same as the fear of having his brother&#39;s tiny dick, this was another step up! He stuck to the cubicles getting into his speedo, and with a great deal of care, he slid a wad of fabric he&#39;d brought from home down the front. Adjusting it so at a glance it resembled a modest bulge, he tried to make sure his complete lack of balls was hidden. &quot;Can&#39;t believe I&#39;m pretending like it&#39;s all there.&quot; He breathed out, getting his nerves under control, and went out to the pool.<br />
<br />
On the way, he passed by Haylee leaving the lifeguard&#39;s office. She was wearing a skirt that was long enough to keep everything properly hidden beneath. She shot him a wink and a low-key comment that nobody else heard, her eyes darting to his crotch as he went by. &quot;Lookin&#39; good, stud. Nice disguise, almost seems real downstairs.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ethan blushed, envious that he couldn&#39;t do the same as her. It didn&#39;t seem fair that he couldn&#39;t fake it so easily!<br />
<br />
The rest of Tuesday went by, and he spent it continuing to adjust to the new feelings and emotions of the challenge he&#39;d accepted. Wednesday arrived, and he was calmer, and beginning to feel better about it. It no longer felt quite so weird, and his comfort level began to grow, along with his courage. By the evening, he was feeling much more bold and adventurous, and after dinner with Eric, he closed himself in his room.<br />
<br />
Ethan was ready to explore.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m really about to do this.&quot; Sliding a hand down the front of his panties, he stroked the hairless lips. Ethan&#39;s emotions and state of mind had shifted from boy-experimenting to full on feminine-sexual-confidence, and he began to caress along the sensitive outer parts, feeling a pleasant tingle as he got warmer, wetter. Lightly brushing his clit, he began to carefully rub across it, each touch radiating electricity. Shuddering, his breath picking up, Ethan continued to slowly stroke himself, and then without thinking, his other hand crept into his panties. He was sliding his fingers inside, and then he was pushing them in and out, in a rhythm. It didn&#39;t take long before his heart was beating rapidly, his face flushed, and with a surprisingly girly moan, his pussy tightened and he was awash with the ecstatic heat of his orgasm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, masturbating as a girl is a LOT of fun,&quot; he thought, pulling his fingers out and staring dazed down at his soaked panties. Grabbing a towel, he wrapped it around himself and went to take a shower, thinking it over as he did. He still imagined himself as a boy, and felt attached to that idea, but the feelings around female sex were really drawing him in. &quot;Having a vagina is ... interesting.&quot; He thought back to what he&#39;d just done, and before he realised it, he was fingering himself again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god,&quot; he sighed, quickly withdrawing his hand. &quot;I need to control myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
Thursday brought with it a new challenge. Ethan was still the same teenage boy who liked pretty girls, something he had to remind himself of in the current condition ... but his altered body was beginning to have an affect on him. He wasn&#39;t really interested in other boys -- well maybe just a bit? Not THAT much though! -- but more and more he found himself drawn to their crotches in particular.<br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t take much for him to understand it. The ring did seem to have a boosting effect on libido for a while, after all, and Ethan reasoned that having a pussy was making him crave dick. It started in class where he began to imagine how big his classmates were, mostly the better looking athletic guys. It got worse during swim practice, and he found it very hard to concentrate, and was even called out by the coach a couple of times for not paying attention. Observing the packed material, how good it appeared, dreaming of the sizes they must be hard -- it made Ethan feel hot, distracted, lightheaded. Even another feverish masturbation session wasn&#39;t enough on Thursday night, either. It just didn&#39;t seem to be hitting the spot, the satisfaction only temporary.<br />
<br />
It was like he needed something more than his own fingers ...<br />
<br />
Friday was even worse, and the afternoon&#39;s classes were a wash. His thoughts were consumed by horny ideas, and he spent too much of the school day thinking about cock, about the taste, smell, shape of it, how mouthwatering it was. By the end of school, having hurriedly arranged for his brother to be taken care of, he went straight to Haylee&#39;s place as soon as he was free from extracurriculars, feeling weirdly needy and desperate. He wasn&#39;t sure why it was so bad, but what Ethan didn&#39;t realise was that he wasn&#39;t the only one.<br />
<br />
Grabbing him by the hand, she pulled him inside, into the living room. Ethan went to speak, but he was struck dumb when he saw her. Haylee was wearing a sports bra on the top, and track pants below, fresh from showering after school. The pants were tented out in a massive erection, and his eyes went right to it, and stayed glued there. The outline of his former penis, now hers, was mesmerising and Ethan subconsciously licked his lips as he stared.<br />
<br />
&quot;This thing has been hard SO much since Wednesday night,&quot; she huffed. &quot;I jerked off twice yesterday and nothing! My English lit class was insane, it was full of pussy -- I mean, a LOT of girls -- but all I could think about was how tight they must be, but how I couldn&#39;t fuck any of them.&quot; She pushed Ethan and he fell backwards onto the couch. Haylee grinned. &quot;It&#39;s weird, I&#39;m still interested in guys but I also just want some quality vag. Good thing I have you for both those needs, stud.&quot;<br />
<br />
She unclipped her bra, and Ethan&#39;s brain automatically responded in kind by making him remove his shirt and shuck his jeans. The last to come off were Haylee&#39;s track pants, and her cock sprang up, long and thick. He was transfixed, but Haylee held out her hand. &quot;Ring!&quot; She demanded. &quot;I&#39;ve got one more change, real quick. Just for this, we&#39;ll swap back after.&quot;<br />
<br />
Handing it to her, Haylee put it on. Quickly, she snapped up Ethan&#39;s shirt and pulled it over her head, then concentrated.<br />
<br />
Immediately, Ethan felt a pressure on his chest, with flesh pushing outward.<br />
<br />
Breasts?!<br />
<br />
Taking a breath, he felt Haylee&#39;s gorgeous round C cups bounce lightly, the cool air tickling the nipples, and he groaned at the sensation.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re gonna be fucked like a girl, and I&#39;m gonna fuck you like a dude.&quot; Removing the shirt again, she climbed on top of him and pulled the black lace down his thighs, then slid a couple of fingers inside. &quot;You feel almost ready for me!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ethan could only moan softly in response, as she probed him, before slipping out again. His hand slid around her shaft and he gripped it. &quot;Fuck, it&#39;s big,&quot; he whispered, almost hungry for it. &quot;Even the balls ... &quot;<br />
<br />
Smirking, Haylee came nearer, and leaned it to kiss him. Their lips met and locked, and they drew together. Ethan felt the weird but wonderful softness of his newly acquired breasts squishing as they mashed against her flat chest. Her cock felt like it was hardening even more, and it crept up between Ethan&#39;s thighs. His pussy was soaking, and the liquid trickled, the juice dripping all over her shaft. Ethan&#39;s hand had slipped down to Haylee&#39;s balls and he was massaging them as she moved in yet closer.<br />
<br />
Breaking the kiss, she brushed against him. &quot;You good, Romeo?&quot;<br />
<br />
In response, he grabbed the tip of her cock and positioned it so the head was bumping his pussy lips. With a deep breath, he began to push himself onto it.<br />
<br />
Despite how hot and ready he was, the shaft was both thick and long, and Ethan gasped as he felt his vagina stretch dramatically, the log of flesh inching inside him. Breathing heavily, he kept pushing onto it, relaxing his groin. On and on it went, and there was so much that he felt like ten feet of penis was crammed inside him, until finally he felt the tickle of her pubes. Swallowing, Ethan glanced down and was greeted by the surreal sight of looking between his boobs at an oversized cock buried in his vagina.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m a boy,&quot; he whispered in his mind, at one of the most erotic images he&#39;d ever seen.<br />
<br />
He began to move, slowly at first, but then a little more as he loosened up and adjusted. &quot;I&#39;m a boy,&quot; he repeated to himself, as his pussy was slowly sliding up and down an enormous fat shaft, trying to milk the length of her dick.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck, you&#39;re so fucking tight,&quot; Haylee moaned, letting Ethan do the work. &quot;So warm and wet!&quot;<br />
<br />
Her hands came up, teasing his breasts for a few moments, then she slid her grip down to his hips. Taking control, Haylee began to thrust, picking up speed. Ethan&#39;s shock went quickly to rapture at the feeling of so much cock withdrawing then rapidly sliding back in. Each thrust felt amazing, and her balls were slapping his ass, his back sliding on the couch, his tits jiggling and bouncing. Ethan could only moan, swirl his hips in time to it, the pleasure and heat building in him, while Haylee was grunting, her eyes filled with pure masculine lust.<br />
<br />
She continued fucking him for a couple of minutes, slowing sometimes to edge a bit, then rubbing against him deliberately to give extra stimulation to his clit. When they were both getting close, she sped up again, and with a final sudden thrust, she plunged in as deep as she could go, and Ethan give an extremely feminine whimper as he orgasmed, while Haylee&#39;s cock was pulsing, shooting wave after wave into his tender well-pounded pussy.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m still a boy,&quot; he told himself again, as he caught his breath. Haylee had collapsed on top of him, breathing hard, her softening cock still inside him and her face nestled in his boobs. <br />
<br />
Except, it didn&#39;t sound very true to him right then.<br />
<br />
The breasts were temporary, but the rest of it?<br />
<br />
There wasn&#39;t a rush to change back, was there?<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, so maybe right now I&#39;m- ... I&#39;m a female boy,&quot; he flushed, at his private admission, &quot;and ... I like it.&quot;</p>
