<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">(Violence marked, because of the description of violence in the dialogue)<br />
<br />
You saw the boy right outside of your cave, and he was staring at you afraid. You knew now that any move that you would try to make towards the boy would only frighten him, so you decided retreat into your cave and wait for the perfect opportunity. So you walked back into your cave and layed down in your nest, and watched him. The boy looked at you seemingly confused as to why you didn&#39;t just attack him, but at the same time he was still scared and you saw him run off.<br />
<br />
After the boy ran off you stood up and began stalking him from the shadows. You saw him looking around and trying to find a way out, and it wasn&#39;t until you saw him stop and sit down that you decided to make your move. You walked up behind the boy silently, and spoke in a hissing voice when you said to him,&quot;Greetings lost boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
The boy swiftly turned around to see you, and screamed again and crawling backwards on his ass until his back was to a tree. &quot;D...don&#39;t hurt me....y...you....monster!&quot; The boy yelled in fear covering his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Monster?&quot; You said and paused looking down at your claws,&quot;Yeah, I am a monster to you aren&#39;t I. However, I don&#39;t want to hurt you, and I won&#39;t hurt you. But I need to know one thing, will you hurt me if I help you?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;H...help me?&quot; The boy asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I only wish to help you live. I will care for you, and help you survive here just promise me that you won&#39;t hurt me. I guess what I&#39;m really asking is, can we be friends?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;F...friends? No, I want my parents! Where are they!?&quot; The boy yelled breaking into tears, and you paused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y...your parents?&quot; You said then hesitated at the realization about what kind of trauma. The boy then broke into tears and you slowly walked over to him and layed down beside him and lowered your tail to the ground behind you so you wouldn&#39;t accidentally jab him with your stinger.<br />
<br />
&quot;I...don&#39;t know anything about your parents. There&#39;s no easy way to say this, but they may not be alive. I understand if you feel mad at me or....&quot; you began, but the boy interrupted you.<br />
<br />
&quot;No! They can&#39;t be gone! They&#39;re still alive!&quot; The boy yelled and looked at you with an expression of anger.<br />
<br />
You then fell silent, and thought about the situation for a moment. &quot;Look as I said I don&#39;t know if they are alive, but I&#39;m not quite sure if they are dead.&quot; You began and the boy looked at you. You then continued and said,&quot;All I am saying is that you have hope, so try your best to hold onto what hope you have. They can still be alive, and we just don&#39;t know it yet. However, I do know that I need to help you live, and so I will. As you said, I am a monster and whenever I need to feed I kill something that they release into the cage.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Who are they? Who are you?&quot; The boy asked<br />
<br />
&quot;I am not sure what I am, but I will tell you what I know. The name that they gave me is Subject 56, but please call me whatever you wish. As for them, all I know is that I met one earlier and I can&#39;t quite describe what it looked like exactly, but I can say that they aren&#39;t human and I am an alien being now, but they are different from me.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
The boy looked in wonder, but still partially crying. You then stood up and said,&quot;Boy, if you hear any sounds that sound like growling, tearing, eating, or anything that sounds violent STAY AWAY. These sounds are from me feeding, and unless you like to see me tear into the flesh of a small creature and devour it&#39;s blood and guts then get away.&quot; The boy then nodded, and scooted a little bit away from you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I won&#39;t do that to you, but I don&#39;t blame you for moving away from me just now. Once you are done here meet me at my cave, you already know where that is. There is where I will take care of you, so stay away from me when I feed, and meet me at the cave. I&#39;ll be waiting for you Boy, so see ya then.&quot; You said then walked away towards your cave.<br />
<br />
You walked back to the pond around your cave and you looked at your body once more. You looked down at your pelvis and you noticed something that shocked you to say the least. You noticed that you had a slit in-between you legs, which you should have expected because of the breasts. You deduced this slit to be a vagina for you noticed your anus was right above that.<br />
<br />
A few minutes later you saw the boy walk over to you as you sat right outside your cave. &quot;So you have come back.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t find a way out, and I need to uh...go to the bathroom.&quot; The boy said embarrassed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, well just go in the forest then I guess. Doesn&#39;t much matter for number one or two I guess. Just squat down and go wherever you want, well everywhere except the cave.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, uh thanks then.&quot; The boy said then walked away<br />
<br />
You then felt urges to piss and shit yourself so you made your way into the forest area. You found an area to do your business, and when you squatted down to piss you saw your dick extend out of your mouth and a big stream of urine blasted out of it, and a light stream came from your slit. You felt disgusted, but you felt like you expected this in the back of your mind. Your dick then retracted into your mouth once more, and you tasted what small amount of urine that dripped from it, and you were disgusted but you felt like you could live with it. When you shat you growled and your dung came out of the normal area, and it carried a strong scent. You turned around and looked at your shit and saw that it was dark blue and abnormally large for a creature of your size to produce, but you didn&#39;t question your biology by this point.<br />
<br />
Moments later you heard a noise and you saw the boy walk up behind you. &quot;Did you see me when I was uh....&quot; you began not sure what to say<br />
<br />
The boy nodded slowly,&quot;Are you um...a boy or a girl?&quot; The boy asked<br />
<br />
&quot;I uh...I don&#39;t know. I guess maybe I&#39;m both? Believe me my life is really weird. Let&#39;s just walk back to the cave for now alright.&quot; You said and began walking back towards the cave and the boy followed you.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, I&#39;ve been meaning to ask you something, and you&#39;ve been asking me a lot of questions so you need to answer me. Who are you exactly? What&#39;s your name?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Cody,&quot; the boy, Cody said<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright then, nice to meet you then.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
Cody just nodded and proceeded to say,&quot;So what now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know, but I know what we should do. Which is basically get you settled in here, so welcome to your new home. It&#39;s not your home for forever, or at least I don&#39;t think it is.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; Cody said<br />
<br />
Just then you heard the sound of the door to the enclosure open, and Cody seemed to hear it as well. &quot;Cody, go back to the cave and wait for me to come to you.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;But what&#39;s happe...&quot; Cody began <br />
<br />
&quot;NOW CODY, JUST GO NOW!&quot; You yelled and Cody ran off and tripped over nervously, but caught himself as he fell and got back up. Moments later Drush entered accompanied by two fully armored guards both from his race. You walked up to them, but kept your distance as the guards pulled out a couple of spears and pointed them at you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stand down, this one is intelligent and knows better.&quot; Drush said walking up to you and the guards looked at each other and returned to a passive stance.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what are you here for now Drush?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;The human, where is he?&quot; Drush said<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you want with him, he&#39;s fine.&quot; You thought to him<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing is wrong, we&#39;re just going to help him adapt using a solution that we have. We won&#39;t kill him if that&#39;s what you&#39;re asking.&quot; Drush said<br />
<br />
&quot;Still what are you going to do specifically? He&#39;s been worried about his parents too, so I&#39;d like to know what has happened to them.&quot; You thought to him<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re most likely one of the subjects, like you. If there&#39;s any luck they are subjects that came after you otherwise they would have died from the transformation.&quot; Drush said<br />
<br />
You paused and then said via thought,&quot;So what do you want with him?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s just say that you both won&#39;t be willing to let this happen, especially if you are already this attached to him. So we&#39;re going to sedate you.&quot; Drush said<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait what?!&quot; You yelled, and suddenly you were shot by a dart of some sort, and collapsed. When you woke up...<br />
<br />
