<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">By the time he left the bathroom, every employee had been turned into a goth with animal features. Jacob went back to work, trying to ignore his new body. This was easier said than done, as he is constantly reminded every time he has to reach up to punch an order into the computer, every time his ear twitches towards the door, every time he swallows his own cum.<br />
<br />
And, of course, every time he watches a customer change from human to whatever weird goth animal people everyone was becoming. A family of three humans came in talking about their road trip, and he struggled to keep a straight face while the mother&#39;s breasts grew, the father shrank down slightly and feminized, and even their young daughter now has small breasts that will only get bigger as she grows up. Makeup appeared, darkening their lips and eyes along with their clothes, comfy pants replaced with skirts soaked through with cum. <br />
<br />
The family now consists of a mouse mother, tiger father, and gazelle daughter complete with horns. Jacob finishes putting in their order of burgers, apparently those with herbivorous features can still eat meat like a human would. It looks like guys tend to be smaller than women on average, but it also looks like Jacob got the short end of that particular stick anyways. <br />
<br />
As lunch continues, fewer and fewer humans come in. Whatever virus or curse or whatever is going around must be spreading around town quickly. Jacob just tries to keep focused on work so he doesn&#39;t have a panic attack. That can wait for after his shift.<br />
<br />
Glancing over at Lily and the puddles of cum on the counter and floor, he can only imagine what the kitchen looks like. He&#39;s not hopeful about the cleanliness back there, and resolves to not think about it.<br />
<br />
As the lunch rush died down, a corgi woman that Jacob assumes to be around his age comes in. Her extreme anxious energy catches his attention, ears pinned back and tail tucked between her legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to Quick Burger, what can we get started for you?&quot; Jacob went through his normal script, offering a smile before feeling cum drip from his chin onto his shirt. <br />
<br />
The corgi girl stares at the menu for a minute. &quot;I&#39;ll have a... uhh...&quot; she pauses before muttering quietly &quot;can I even eat tomato anymore?&quot;<br />
<br />
Can she also remember everyone being human? Taking a chance, Jacob leans as far over the counter as he can, blushing as he realizes his feet left the ground. Half whispering, he offers his advice to the girl. &quot;Nobody else has been changing their orders, pretty sure you can have anything you used to eat before.&quot; <br />
<br />
She blushes, nodding. &quot;Oh... good. I&#39;ll have a bacon burger meal, then. Actually, I think I need some onion rings after all that.&quot; She gets her card out to pay. &quot;Sooo... you also remember?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep, I&#39;ve been trying not to think about it too much, but... I&#39;m so short now.&quot; Jacob looks back to the kitchen. &quot;Y&#39;know what, I&#39;ll take my break now if you&#39;ll let me sit with you. It&#39;ll be nice to know someone else who knows.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! Yeah, that would be good! I didn&#39;t even think of that...&quot; She accepts the invitation, waiting for Jacob to punch in his own order before the two grab a table. &quot;My name&#39;s Tessa.&quot;<br />
<br />
Every chair and table in the shop was covered in cum. picking one of the cleaner ones, they wipe it down as best they can with a few napkins.<br />
<br />
Jacob takes a sip of his soda before breaking the ice. &quot;So Tessa, how&#39;d you change? If you don&#39;t mind me asking.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I was furniture shopping. I just moved here for work and needed some things. One of the employees was loading the boxes into my car. Some goth chick with cat ears walked past with her cart, asked the worker to help her after he was done with me,&quot; she sighs, &quot;He turned, I didn&#39;t notice until he was at my window to tell me he was done. Suddenly I&#39;m dressed in black and have a tail pinched in the seat.&quot; <br />
<br />
Dan, now a slender otter boy, delivered Tessa&#39;s food to the table. He returns a minute later with Jacob&#39;s meal. Jacob waits for him to leave back to the kitchen before sharing his story. &quot;So that&#39;s me. A rabbit guy stuck at work while everything happens.&quot; He puts his head in his hands, running his fingers through his messy hair. &quot;I have to go home to my girlfriend like this...&quot;<br />
<br />
Tessa takes a bite of her burger before responding. &quot;Well, there&#39;s a good chance she won&#39;t notice anything.&quot; She wipes a mix of cum and grease off her mouth with a napkin. <br />
<br />
&quot;But she&#39;ll change too! And I have to just pretend everything is fine when it&#39;s not!&quot; <br />
<br />
Tessa grabs Jacob&#39;s arm, grounding him. &quot;Jacob. Listen to me. There&#39;s things we can say, little excuses. Amnesia, concussion, a... a bad trip or something. Hell, we might not be the only ones, someone else might make something up for us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob took a sip of soda, swallowing too quickly. He coughs, launching cum from his mouth onto the table. &quot;...Gross. Sorry, you&#39;re right, I&#39;ll... come up with something. Sorry for just breaking down on you. I... I should get back to work.&quot; He pokes at his half-eaten burger a bit but doesn&#39;t stand up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s exchange phone numbers. If either of us finds more people that remember, we can make a support group or something.&quot; Tessa opens her phone, navigating to add Jacob&#39;s contact info before checking her social media. &quot;Looks like it hasn&#39;t reached my hometown yet, none of my friends are goth yet. I&#39;m a dog girl in all my old photos, but everyone else is human.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob checks his own phone, scrolling through his friends&#39; stories. &quot;Most of mine are changed... They&#39;re just posting as normal. Let me...&quot; He takes a selfie, it&#39;s purposely bad but does show his bunny ears. Captioning it &#39;in my conspiracy era aliens changed us,&#39; he posts it on his story. &quot;Posted something. Kinda joke thing I&#39;d usually do but maybe if someone else can see through it they&#39;ll figure it out.&quot; He stands up to get back to work. &quot;It was really nice meeting you, Tessa. I&#39;ll see you around.&quot;</p>
