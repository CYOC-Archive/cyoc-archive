<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen hung up the phone with disgust.<br />
<br />
<i>Clearly the little pervert is just living out some fantasy.  Must have lost touch with reality.  So sad.</i><br />
<br />
She quickly found her missing sock and finished getting dressed.  She ignored the call and focused instead on what she was going to tell the rest of the cheerleading squad at their before-school meeting.  The school&#39;s homecoming was this Friday, and they were playing their long-time rivals.  Last year they won, but this year the rivals had a really strong team.<br />
<br />
The Vice Principal of Extracurricular Activities asked Jen to have the cheerleaders drum up support and interest in the general student body.  She was all too eager to do it, and had a number of ideas to discuss with the cheerleading squad.<br />
<br />
She grabbed the keys to her mom&#39;s spare car and got in.  She didn&#39;t have a car of her own, but her mom let her drive the spare car: a bright pink compact.  The color had been coincidental - it had originally been purchased secondhand with the wacky color, but Jen loved it so it hadn&#39;t been changed.<br />
<br />
The drive to school was uneventful - due to going in an hour early, there was a lot less traffic than usual.  But, she did hit 4 red traffic lights in a row, making her late for her own meeting.  By the time she was at the school she had almost completely forgotten about the weird call.<br />
<br />
Jen rushed into the gym, where the meeting would be, and was surprised to see her squad there... crying.<br />
<br />
&quot;Girls, what&#39;s wrong?&quot;  Jen dropped her backpack next to the door and looked over her squad.<br />
<br />
<br />
Amanda, her best friend, was slowly walking in large circles.  She was a humantaur, with 4 legs (with correspondingly both a front and a back vagina), and about 3 feet of torso-like flesh between the legs.  Amanda was strong enough that she could give people rides on her lower back, but preferred not to.  On the cheer squad, she had trouble participating in gymnastic cheers, and tended to do a number of solo cheers.  It was always a crowd pleaser when she reared up so her front legs pointed straight at the crowd, giving them an upskirt on her front crotch, and showing off her 2nd, larger, pair of breasts that hung from her lower body.<br />
<br />
<br />
Stacy was hugging all her selves as closely together as she could.  Stacy was a single girl with 4 bodies, all identical, but not physically connected.  When she had first joined the squad, there had been rumors that she was lying about being a single person, and was really a group of 4 identical quadruplets playing a joke on the squad.  A game of telepathic telephone, where she was in 4 locations and asked to relay messages quickly convinced the squad that she was genuine.  She usually made up the bottom of the pyramid, as she was fairly strong and could coordinate all 4 bodies at once to do some amazing things... like walking the pyramid around!<br />
<br />
<br />
Mary had all 6 of her arms wrapped around her girlfriend Julie&#39;s left body, and was crying on Julie&#39;s rightmost shoulder.  The two had been a couple since cheerleader camp at the start of the year and tried to keep it secret.  But everyone knew.  Mary&#39;s 6 breasts and arms gave her an impressive silhouette, and her 6 eyes often made it feel like she was looking into your soul.<br />
<br />
Julie said she liked the intensity of her girlfriend&#39;s gaze.  It was amazing that the two of them were a couple, because they physically did not seem compatible - Beneath Julie&#39;s head were 2 necks leading into 2 complete bodies.  Julie had tried to run track at first, but had been told she couldn&#39;t due to her form: having 4 legs and taking up 2 lanes disqualified her.  So she had joined the cheerleading squad instead, and had never looked back.<br />
<br />
<br />
Tracy had fallen to pieces, literally.  Her limbs were scattered in a circle around her.  Tracy had a unique trick that she loved to show off at games: she would detach her head and an arm, then attach her head to the stump at the end of her arm.  She would regrow her head and arm on her body, and use the separated head/arm as a baton.  Most recently she&#39;s started to shout cheers through a megaphone with her baton, and using 2 or even 3 &quot;Tracy-batons&quot; at once.  Once she has regrown a separated body part, she retains feeling and control in the separated part, but it will wither out and vanish after a couple of hours.  Jen had always felt a bit jealous of Tracy&#39;s ability, even if only because it lets Tracy cheat on tests by having a second disconnected torso/head/arms in the bathroom reading the textbook.<br />
<br />
<br />
Gwen was hugging her torsos together as closely as she could.  Her breasts pressed tightly together, causing them to spill from her too-small bikini tops and reveal a lot of side boob.  Gwen was normal from the waist down.  From the waist up, she had 2 side-by-side normal torsos, complete with a head on each (both heads were controlled by her single consciousness).  Her skeleton at the point where her torsos connected to her waist seemed to be abnormally flexible, as she was able to rotate her torsos in place, as well as rotate them around each other.  Gwen usually positioned her upper halves so both of her heads were looking forward, side-by-side, but sometimes she would do things like position one torso behind the other so she could talk with a friend was walking behind her.<br />
<br />
<br />
Trish, Trish, Trish, and Trish were, predictably, arguing between herselves.  Trish had 4 long and incredibly flexible necks coming off her shoulders, each 4 feet in length.  Atop each neck was an identical head.  Trish had been born with one head, but as she grew up, her hydra heritage had taken over and she had grown more heads.  All of the heads collectively were Trish, but each head had a different personality.  She had an unfortunate quirk that she would not make choices telepathically between her personalities, but preferred to instead talk it out verbally.  This mean that Trish was both the slowest decision maker on the team, and also the loudest.  Her heads even sometimes got into fights, but usually without any permanent damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
Natalie had coiled herself up next to the bleachers.  Only her head and arms showed atop her large coil of tail flesh.  Natalie&#39;s tail was nearly 300 feet in length, and 2 feet in diameter.  Like a snake her tail had beautiful vibrant green and gold diamond patterns, but unlike a snake her tail was not covered in scales - instead her tail was covered in resilient flesh.  To the touch she felt like a baby&#39;s skin, but try to pierce or hurt her flesh and it was suddenly as hard as reinforced steel.  Natalie&#39;s upper half was that of a normal girl.  When Natalie hit puberty and her tail started to grow beyond the baby 3 foot length, moving around rapidly became a problem.  Now that she has grown to such a large size and her growth has slowed down (but not stopped), Natalie is capable of slithering at over 50 miles per hour.<br />
<br />
<br />
Beth had coiled herself up too, next to Natalie.  The two were great friends due to the challenges they both faced.  Unlike Natalie who had no legs, Beth had hundreds of them.  Above the waist, she was a normal girl, but at her hips her body turned and grew backwards.  Every 12 inches was another pair of hips complete with a set of legs and vagina.  Her anus was at the very end of her body, over 400 feet of flesh from her front legs.  Ever since puberty, once a week Beth grows another set of legs.  She has no idea when, or IF, it will stop.<br />
<br />
<br />
Evelyn had retreated up the wall, as she often does.  The suckers on her lower tentacles held her securely to the wall.  Instead of human hips, at her hips her body flares out into 8 large tentacles, each about 10 feet in length and tapering from 6 inches to 1 inch in diameter.  Similarly, she has no arms, but instead has 4 smaller tentacles coming out of each shoulder.  Her amazing dexterity and ability to hang from walls or ceilings has proven quite useful on the cheer squad - they even invented a new gymnastic cheer specifically for indoor occasions, where they launch her up to the ceiling, and have her perform half of a cheer while hanging upside down.<br />
<br />
<br />
There were a couple of girls missing too.<br />
<br />
Jen was confused, as she saw nothing out of the ordinary with her squad.  &quot;Come on girls, what&#39;s wrong?  Tell me, I can help.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amanda snapped out of her daze and walked over at Jen, but stopped a good 5 feet away.  &quot;Ohmygod Jen, don&#39;t answer your phone!  That little shit did this to us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did what?&quot;<br />
<br />
Amanda stared, dumbfounded at Jen.  She shifted slightly sideways to show off her lower torso with and second pair of legs.  &quot;Uh... This.  Isn&#39;t it obvious?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen shook her head.  &quot;No.  What?  That you aren&#39;t wearing your rear skirt?&quot;<br />
<br />
Amanda&#39;s jaw dropped.  &quot;You can&#39;t be serious.  I have FOUR FUCKING LEGS.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen nodded.  &quot;Yeah.  You do.  So what?&quot;<br />
<br />
Amanda threw up her arms in frustration.  &quot;Goddamn curse!  Fucking Perkins!  I swear I&#39;m going to kill him!&quot;<br />
<br />
The name suddenly brought back the events of the morning and the phone call.  Jen&#39;s mouth slowly slid open as realization hit her.  &quot;You... you were a normal person yesterday, weren&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;YES!  So you do remember?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen backed slowly away from Amanda, remembering what she had been told.  <i>&quot;The first person you touch&quot;  Oh shit...</i>  She didn&#39;t want to steal Amanda&#39;s body.  &quot;Uh...  No, you&#39;ve always been a humantaur.  But uhm... I believe you.  I uh... I got called this morning too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen looked around at the rest of the squad, most of whom had gotten up and were moving over to Jen.  Seeing so many unusual girls approaching made Jen panic...</p>
