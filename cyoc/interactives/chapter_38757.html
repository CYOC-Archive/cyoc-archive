<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle could do nothing but watch as Felicia met his fate head on, as her body mass ballooned with blubber as an anorexic girl's nightmare came true. Having gone through this firsthand, he knew how much pain she should have been in.<br />
<br />
Yet, he had to give her credit...she didn't scream after the initial changes began even though it HAD to have hurt like the dickens. Felicia simply looked ahead, probably having her human life flashing in front of her eyes. <br />
<br />
Of course Kyle had noticed something else, it seemed that Felicia actually still had some resemblance to her human self. Her face, Kyle noticed, still was definitely that of a walrus but still had her somewhat thin cheeks, and even compared to his own hide, her skin (That had been olive before) still looked like it had somewhat of a greenish tint. <br />
<br />
Felicia and Kyle both stared at the ocean for hours...they didn't know if they could even use some kind of Walrus speak to each other, or even know if they could. Felicia seemed to be too depressed to want to talk anyways. Kyle even feared that if he tried to calm her down or cheer her up a little bit, that she'd just snap at him and say that this was his fault. Arguing of course wouldn't help at all. No one could curse them back to human beings or undo all this mess. They couldn't talk, they couldn't curse each other, they were stuck until the people working from the zoo came, just as Jennifer predicted.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Finally, the two slept, and they didn't know when it was they fell asleep. The two walruses slept so deep, they didn't even notice anything until Felicia woke, realizing that she wasn't on the beach anymore...it definitely seemed to be a fake arctic environment. How on earth could one replicate the arctic in a coastal town? They at least did a much better job of it, the rocks were indeed real and thanks to her felt soft. <br />
<br />
Kyle was asleep in a corner, and Felicia tried to move, already knowing it wasn't a dream, it was real - in dreams, you can't feel pain. There were walls up blocking people from the exhibit, and it likely wasn't opening hours just yet - heck the exhibit seemed to be closed off for a little while, just to allow them to adjust to their new environment. <br />
<br />
Felecia rolled on her back and looked up at the cloud-free sky. At least a Zoo would have been a little better for her than the wild...and Kyle. <br />
<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
<br />
Kyle and Felicia had of course not even tried to fight it, they all knew their fates were sealed (not like the animals) the second they became full-fledged zoo animals. Even if they could have escaped to follow Jennifer, she could have out-swam them easily. Revenge was futile - they couldn't speak to her to curse her.<br />
<br />
Speaking of which, Felicia one day realized that since they were of the same species, they probably could at least try to say something. Felicia looked at the lazy form of Kyle - who had put on some pounds but still looked like a healthy attractive walrus to her (Sex was the last thing they wanted to think of).<br />
<br />
She finally tried to send a thought to Kyle - she had read this in books. <br />
<br />
&lt;&quot;...Kyle? Can you hear me now?&quot;&gt; (She had learned his name from Jennifer)<br />
<br />
The man-turned walrus jolted his head awake and tried to say something but it emerged as a grunt. He looked at Felicia, making eye contact with the she-walrus.<br />
<br />
&lt;&quot;...Was that you?! You spoke to me?!&quot;&gt; it had been a week and a half since any of them spoke last. <br />
<br />
Felicia's eyes widened. <br />
<br />
&lt;&quot;Yes...yes it is...We can speak to each other.&quot;&gt;<br />
<br />
Kyle looked excited, bobbing a little.<br />
<br />
&lt;&quot;Good....this'll make our fate more bearable. We should at least get to know each other...I mean we're gonna be roommates for awhile.&quot;&gt; he thought to her.<br />
<br />
&lt;&quot;Well we already know each other's names...what do you think we could talk about?&quot;&gt; Felicia said.<br />
<br />
&lt;&quot;Well what does a Zoo animal think about? Or even talk about?&quot;&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
That was the beginning of a fairy-tale like relationship. The two walruses became the equivalent of being married. They fought, laughed, and even on the rare occasion engaged in sex, but they had a sense of decency and would only do it when there were no tourists looking. They may as well have been the happiest pinnipeds in the world.<br />
<br />
And yet, months afterwards, a thought occurred to the Zoo animals....They had gotten their revenge on Jennifer. They had became even closer to each other than they probably would be if Kyle had become a fish man like he intended, rather than a nice sexy walrus. Felicia, the most beautiful woman in the world to him was all he needed, same with the care of the zookeepers. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
********************************************************<br />
This of course does not need to be the end of the story.<br />
<br />
The walruses, rather separate from the rest of the zoo seldom knew of the events. Especially those at night when no one was looking.<br />
<br />
And of course, what of Jennifer?</p>
