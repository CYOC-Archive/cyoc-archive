<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You wake up slowly. You can't see anything. You realize quickly that you are naked. But nothing feels or sounds familiar.<br />
<br />
Then you begin to recognize sounds. You recognize the voices of your family and apparently it's Christmas. They are going through the usual <br />
chit chat as they settle down to open presents. You wonder why your not one of them. You hear hints in the conversation that your family <br />
believes you couldn't make it for Christmas because you couldn't afford the airfare.<br />
<br />
You figure you must be dreaming because why would you be able to listen to your families Christmas and not be there with them.<br />
<br />
They settle down to open presents. You begin to feel like your on a roller-coaster when you hear your father says, &quot;James, this one is for you. <br />
Your brother sent it to you from college. It was peculiar how it arrived though because it wasn't delivered. It just showed up on the doorstep <br />
last night.&quot;<br />
<br />
You begin to see some light finally but you can't really see anything because the light is leaking through seams. What you see looks like <br />
packaging: cardboard and paper with a little plastic. You try to speak but can't make a sound. Then the packaging clears away and you are <br />
looking up into your brother's face when he says, &quot;Really, he sent me bike shorts.&quot;<br />
<br />
James does compete in triathlons. Although you never thought of giving him bike shorts for Christmas, it's not really that bad of an idea.<br />
<br />
James reaches toward you and starts lifting you up. That's when the realization finally registers. You are the bike shorts. Your mind reels and <br />
you quickly remember the conversation you had with your roommate Tom. It was the last thing you remembered before waking up here. You <br />
think, &quot;So Tom decided to initiate me by turning me into my brother's bike shorts. I wonder just how bad this initiation is going to get.&quot;<br />
<br />
The rest of Christmas was kind of boring. You were laid to the side while the rest of the family had Christmas. From where you were, you <br />
couldn't see much and you weren't included. You got to hear a little about what everyone got but that was about it. Then the family moved to <br />
the dining room for breakfast and you heard less. Then the family began to scatter to do their own things.<br />
<br />
There was some clean up and you were placed in the dirty laundry for later. You dozed off from boredom and don't know how long you were <br />
there. It felt like days before James got around to washing you. Being bike shorts, he couldn't just wash you with other clothes. He had to hand <br />
wash you. Then he stuck you in a drawer for you don't know how long again. You'd see him briefly as he opened the drawer to get something <br />
and then you'd be in darkness again.<br />
<br />
Finally, when you were just about to go insane from isolation, James pulled you out of the drawer. You were already a little broken down <br />
mentally so when he picked you up, you felt special and exhilarated that finally, you were chosen.<br />
<br />
You learned that James was in the habit of wearing very little under his bike shorts. He wore a jock strap but it was a racing jock strap that was <br />
very tiny so that the strap lines would not show through the bike shorts. This meant that more of you would be hugging more of him closely. <br />
But in your mental state, you weren't really disturbed by this thought. Until you felt where his bulge wound up.<br />
<br />
When Tom changed you into bike shorts, he designed you so that you would feel the bulge pressing against your crotch. James pulled the bike <br />
shorts down again to examine the interior and realized that you had a jock strap like lining built into you. So he pulled you completely off and <br />
then pulled his jock strap off before putting you on again. Your own cock was the strap that ran up his ass securing his junk with the lining <br />
that was your ass. You also realized that you eyes were on the interior so that you were looking directly up at the tip of his cock and resting <br />
snugly between his two balls inside your ass.<br />
<br />
You began screaming. James then sat down quickly. (You didn't know it but he heard ringing in his ears that gave him a headache.)<br />
<br />
Nothing seemed to change for you. James continued to move about: standing, sitting or walking. You heard the noises of people nearby. But all <br />
you could see was his cock. You cried. (James didn't recognize the sound but was beginning to wonder why he was hearing things.)<br />
<br />
You learned some things about your brother. To make himself more competitive for swimming, he shaved. But he didn't stop at shaving what <br />
was outside his swim suit. You got a clear study of his uncircumcised cock and balls without the slightest hair in the way.<br />
<br />
Then he started riding his bike.</p>
