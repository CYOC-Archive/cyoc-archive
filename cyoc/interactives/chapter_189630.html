<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">(A/N: The Greg section is adapted pretty much from mattieb81&#39;s chapter, with a couple tweaks to the magic)<br />
<br />
I was out of breath and could feel my insides sloshing just moving around on the sofa. My distended belly was getting so big, it obscured my little dick, still a hard little nub sticking up from my trimmed pubes. I put my hands on my throat, almost expecting I would find my neck stretched out after worshipping three large-dick cocks. I swallowed, imagining it was Mr. Jenkins cum sliding down my throat again. My stomach rumbled. God I wanted more so bad, but I was so full!<br />
<br />
My falsie was still laying on the floor. What a joke, thinking I could pass as a large-dick with THAT thing! I was embarrassed that even the falsie I&#39;d bought to pass was smaller than my younger brother&#39;s mammoth cock. He thought I was his large-dick older brother. Turns out I&#39;m his little-dicked cocksucker. I felt elated and devastated, and my mouth started watering.<br />
<br />
--------<br />
Back at his apartment, Greg was sloshing too. Sucking off a few more strangers on the way back from the bus had left him waddling through the door. He&#39;d been so busy thinking about how stuffed full of cum he was, it took him a few minutes before remembering the notebook. It was time to make things a little more comfortable.<br />
<br />
He opened to his previous page and had his pen at the ready. First of all, to get rid of this bloat. Greg wrote that small-dicks absorb the cum introduced orally or anally, allowing them to subsist on the cum of large-dick feeders. At 500ml per day, a small-dick could live a happy, energized day, keeping them trim and healthy.<br />
<br />
As soon as he put a period after the last line, he immediately felt the rumbling in his stomach go away, his belly was already looking flatter again. He thought of a second idea. On the walk from the bus stop, he&#39;d encountered his string-bean of a large-dick neighbor--and ended up swallowing his load. The humiliation of servicing the much smaller man with the much larger cock was intoxicating. He continued writing:<br />
<br />
&quot;While it is taken as a given that the 25% of men classified as small-dicks will be ashamed of and hide their short-dick status, 90% of small-dicks quickly acclimate to their new social role once they are outed. The small-dick system is such that the same area of the brain that processes humiliation also generates sexual need. As such, even acclimated small-dicks crave humiliation. Studies have shown that a small-dick humiliated multiple times throughout the day experiences a happier outlook on life. For reasons still being explored, the acclimatization process takes longer for small-dick men who have more muscle mass, though testosterone may also play a factor. For this reason, small-dick men who exhibit very traditionally masculine characteristics require more humiliation, once outed, to acclimate.&quot;<br />
<br />
There, Greg sat back and reviewed his new changes. This was going to be a wonderful world.<br />
<br />
----------<br />
<br />
(Danny&#39;s POV)<br />
<br />
I burped, rubbed my belly. Already it was looking a little flatter. Huh, I remember learning in health class that small-dicks absorb cum, but to feel it in action in my own body...<br />
<br />
Then it washed over me again. I was a small-dick. I had been a pretender for years. Strutting around on the wrestling mats, pinning guys a few years older than me with my big frame, pressing my large-dick (actually my falsie) into the asscrack of the guy I just pinned. Pretending like I was some sexual dynamo. <br />
<br />
I looked down again at my little nub. It was still leaking its tiny drips of pre-cum thinking about how everything was going to change for me at school. What would people say about me? I can think of some guys--some real assholes--who would really have their day made getting to pound my eager mouth, me specifically.<br />
<br />
&quot;Small-dick!&quot; Chris called from upstairs<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yes Sir?&quot; the sound that came out of me was soft.<br />
<br />
Chris appeared at the top of the stairs as I fumbled with putting my underwear back on, hopping over to the stairs to answer my sir. My brother. Yeah. Still my little brother. But a large-dick, with big fat nuts--<br />
<br />
&quot;Leave those off,&quot; Chris laughed at me as I gawked. I was just standing there in my underwear. &quot;I want my small-dick boy showing off that little baby dick all weekend!&quot;<br />
<br />
I gulped and slowly slid the briefs down my legs. I felt so small standing at the bottom of the stairs, naked, big wrestling shoulders slumped. My kid brother standing above me, at the top of the stairs. The only man in the house, right now. He fly was still partially open, and I could tell his monster was starting to get hard again. He grinned wickedly at me.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve been doing some reading,&quot; he began. &quot;I&#39;ve been reading up on small-dicks, now that I&#39;ve got my very own in the family!&quot; He tromped down the stairs, stopping when his bulge was at my eye level. I couldn&#39;t take my eyes off it. He was so short, it looked obscene on him. I knew that monster topped out over 16 inches hard, and I&#39;d swallowed most of that. I could practically taste his salty foreskin on my tongue. I barely paid attention to what he was saying. Suddenly he pushed me back and stepped down, grabbing my tiny balls between two fingers and giving a twist.<br />
<br />
I yelped and my whole body tensed up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do I have your attention, now, small-dick?&quot; Chris grinned again, eyes dark.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Sir, sorry Sir. I was--&quot; I couldn&#39;t say it. I couldn&#39;t tell him I had been staring at his bulge. As if he didn&#39;t know, right, but my face was burning imagining saying the words.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know what you were doing you frisky little baby dick. You have to be good to earn the right to stare at a real man.&quot; He continued to squeeze my balls as he spoke &quot;So I read that a big strong little-dicks like you sometimes need extra help acclimating to being cock-sleeves once they&#39;re outed. What kind of BIG brother would I be if I didn&#39;t help my small-dicked LITTLE bro learn how to be the best cocksucker he can be. What do you say to that, boy?&quot;<br />
<br />
I didn&#39;t know how to react, on the one hand I felt my chest swell with pride that my sir--brother--was so considerate. He wasn&#39;t going to leave me to wallow in all this self-doubt! He already knew more about my body than I did. Damn, why didn&#39;t I pay more attention in health class? Wasn&#39;t there something about needing to deeply humiliate the small-dick?<br />
<br />
&quot;Th-thank you, sir!&quot; I still felt like I was looking up at him, and my eyes watered either from the emotion or the pressure on my boy-balls.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re very welcome, boy.&quot; He let go of my balls and patted my cheek patronizingly &quot;It&#39;s time to learn just what being a small-dick in this world means.&quot;</p>
