<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You going to be okay?&quot; Tracy asked, giving the eleven year old Emily one last hug.<br />
<br />
Emily nodded slowly, &quot;Yeah. This is just all so scary, you know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do I ever,&quot; Tracy winced as she shifted her weight, putting pressure on the pair of balls the game had given her, &quot;Now I'm going to take my turn and see what happens.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Emily said quietly, her face puffy and her eyes red from how hard she had been crying.<br />
<br />
When Tracy sat back down with Samantha and Sandra she looked at the nearly full gallon jug of milk and Samantha's new shirt, but said nothing. Instead she picked up the dice and rolled them with a look of grim determination.<br />
<br />
&quot;Seven,&quot; she giggled when she saw what she rolled, &quot;That's lucky, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope,&quot; Sandra said and handed Tracy one of the change cards.<br />
<br />
Taking a deep breath Tracy read the card out to the rest of the girls, &quot;It says, 'There are many battles in life - Winning any is a source of pride - But in the battle of sexes - You'll be joining the other side.' These cards have it in for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
On the bed Emily giggled, &quot;I know what that means!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not exactly...&quot; Tracy trailed off as a tingling feeling started in her balls and pussy, &quot;It's pretty - &quot;<br />
<br />
She tried again only to stop as her voice cracked. Swallowing, she brought a hand to her throat and felt an Adam's apple bob up and down beneath her fingers. Clearing her throat she tried speaking again and this time her voice was much deeper, &quot;What it meant was obvious. Wow it feels creepy though.&quot;<br />
<br />
The tingling in her pussy had stopped and she knew that it was because her pussy was no longer there, her balls on the other hand were still tingling like crazy, working overtime to pump testosterone through her body. Above them she could feel an almost pleasurable pressure as a bulge grew in her jeans. Without even thinking, she brought her hands to her crotch to adjust her rapidly growing cock, blushing at the feel of it. By the time it stopped growing it matched her balls in size, probably about seven inches, though that was probably due to the fact that it was half hard from her rubbing it and the way the smooth fabric of her panties felt as it had slid free of their confines.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me,&quot; She got up and awkwardly shuffled to the closet, the seams of her shirt beginning to make popping noises as her shoulders broadened.<br />
<br />
Safely in the closet, she unzipped her jeans and let her cock fall free. In the small amount of light shining through the crack of the door she could see how big and thick it was, and that it was uncircumcised. For some reason that discovery intrigued her, she had never seen an uncut cock before and the sight of one, even one attached to her was kind of exciting, though part of that might have been due to all the new hormones rushing through her.<br />
<br />
As best as she could she stripped off her jeans, feeling how muscular and hairy her legs were in the process, then she struggled to remove her shirt, which had become painfully restrictive. The seams tore at the shoulders and she looked down at her bra, its straps pulled tight while the cups hung uselessly against her flat, muscular chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Samantha,&quot; her new deep, masculine voice startled her for a moment, but she recovered, &quot;Do you have a pair of sweat pants I can borrow and a big shirt or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
Through the door she could hear Emily giggling again and the sound of Samantha getting up.<br />
<br />
A moment later there was a knock on the door and Tracy opened it a crack, letting her friend pass the clothing through. Though baggy on Samantha, Tracy found that the pants were tight on her, especially in the crotch area, not to mention too short, stopping six inches short of her ankles, still it was better than nothing. The shirt of the other hand wouldn't work at all. The shoulders were way too narrow and Tracy was forced to give up.<br />
<br />
Crossing her arms over her chest Tracy stepped out and was greeted by looks of shock from her three friends.<br />
<br />
Ignoring them, she walked across the room to a mirror and examined herself. With all the other changes she had failed to notice that her hair had become shorter, the sort of style a guy would wear, it had also darkened to a sort of dirty blond shade. Her face itself was that of a stranger, angular and hard there was not a trace of femininity left in her features. Lower down, the arms which she had crossed over her chest were muscular and hairy, and when she lowered them to better see just how muscular she had become she saw that her chest was as muscular and hairy as the rest of her.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is crazy,&quot; she muttered, looking at the shirtless man in the mirror as it slowly sunk in that the man in the mirror was her, &quot;I'm a guy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes you are,&quot; Samantha said with a giggle, &quot;So try not to stare too much at me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Tracy was puzzled by the request and turned to look at Samantha.<br />
<br />
In response Samantha rubbed at her big, perky nipples through the fabric of her shirt, which was pulled tight across her heaving, basketball sized breasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Tracy asked again, confused, &quot;I'm not going to stare. I mean this game's done so crazy stuff to all of us. I'm not going to be rude.&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily bounced off the bed, &quot;So you're still you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I am,&quot; Tracy said quickly, not sure what her friends meant.<br />
<br />
Sandra let out a disgusted sigh, &quot;Lay off her you guys.&quot;<br />
<br />
At that moment Tracy realized what they had all meant and blushed, &quot;The game didn't turn me into a lesbian.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's right,&quot; Emily chimed in, apparently taking spiteful pleasure in her friend's situation, &quot;You need to be a woman to be a lesbian. You're a guy, so that makes you gay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not funny,&quot; Tracy grumbled as Sandra took the dice to take her turn.</p>
