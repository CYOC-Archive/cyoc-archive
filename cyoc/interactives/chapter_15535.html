<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After a long week of quizzes, tests and writing papers for school, Allen and Tim decided to relax and have fun. It was the end of the semester and the final exams were over and done with, and the two students enjoyed having a few weeks off between the finals and New Year’s Day.<br />
<br />
Allen now had two “victims” he could play with: Peter and Tim. He wanted to keep Peter for the big muscle growth spurts, which was always a huge favorite for both boys. But Allen began to feel a greater feeling of closeness with Tim, and his desire to have Tim with him all the time continued to increase.<br />
<br />
Allen had wished for Tim to want to hang out with him, and Tim immediately called him and asked if he could come over. Allen had the same control over Tim as he had over Peter, and he wanted Tim to stay at his house for a couple of days. Allen had given Peter the idea to buy a pizza and to come over with Ty and Kent. In the meantime, Tim and Allen were alone in his bedroom.<br />
<br />
After playing a few rounds of HALO2 on Allen’s XBOX, Allen decided to get to know Tim a little better.<br />
<br />
 “Hey Tim…” Allen said, as he spoke in a soft voice. He really began to have feelings for his friend.<br />
<br />
Allen got up and looked down at Tim, who was still sitting on the floor with his controller in his hand. Suddenly, Tim felt an overwhelming urge to stand up and to walk over to Tim.<br />
<br />
“You’re such a handsome guy. I’d just love to have you with me all the time. I would love to feel your presence day and night, as you touch my body…” Allen whispered.<br />
<br />
“Well, I love your body as well. I would love to be tiny for you. Can you make me smaller, so that I can be on your body all the time?” Tim asked.<br />
<br />
“I just want to have a good look at you…” Allen grinned, as he slid his briefs down his legs.<br />
<br />
Tim felt the urge to do the same, and he pulled his briefs down his legs.<br />
<br />
For the moment the two men just stared at each other and they were about to pull each other closer, when they heard the front door open downstairs.<br />
<br />
“Pizza, you guys! We came with some pepperoni and cheese pizza for you guys!” Kent shouted, as he walked in, followed by Ty and Peter.<br />
<br />
Allen panics for a split second, at the sound of the people who were walking in the door. He looks back at Tim and at himself, and he realizes that they were both completely naked.<br />
<br />
“I don’t want them to see us naked.” He said.<br />
<br />
“Why don’t you just wear me around your waist?” Tim suggested to him.<br />
<br />
“Brilliant! I want you to change into a new pair of briefs for me to wear. Allen wished out loud.<br />
<br />
Tim’s body shuddered for a second, before it began to shrink down rapidly. Tim gasped as he looked up and noted that the room appeared to be growing! As Tim continued to shrink, his skin slowly began to turn white, before the flesh began to transform into a think layer of cotton. An elastic waistband started to form around his white face, just before the body began to stretch out sideways. Tim was about six inches tall before he turned to white cotton, as his arms and legs merged into one. The cotton stretched out and looped around, as Tim’s body become a thin layer of cotton. Two holes formed at the bottom, where the legs would go through, and the elastic tightened a little around the waist area. When Allen looked down, all he could see was a new pair of briefs, at the exact spot where Tim had disappeared just moments before.<br />
<br />
Allen reached down and placed his feet through each of the holes. He grabbed the elastic part with his fingers before he pulled the briefs gently up his legs, until his groin was completely covered and the waistband’s elastic fit snug around his waist.<br />
<br />
He immediately felt a warm sensation around his cock, as Tim was able to make his cotton “skin” move around a bit, allowing it to touch certain areas of Allen’s skin. Another layer of cotton grew from the inside bottom of the briefs, and it gently wrapped itself around Allen’s cock, before tightening itself around his manhood.<br />
<br />
Allen groaned in pleasure as he felt the soft, warn briefs magically wrap itself around his balls and his cock. The sensation was awesome, and he felt the need to shoot a small load, when Ty, Peter and Kent walked into his bedroom.<br />
<br />
 “Hey dude, what’s up?” Ty asked.<br />
<br />
Allen could tell that Peter and Kent were having a discussion about muscle growth.<br />
<br />
“If your muscles grow, not only should you feel an increase in strength, but an increase in weight as well. Muscles add weight to your body, besides fat and bones and liquid.” Kent pondered out loud.<br />
<br />
“You need to experience it more often. It’s such a rush to grow muscle. Just ask Allen!” Peter replied.<br />
<br />
“Hey guys… you guys brought the pizza, huh?” Allen asked Ty.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, it’s downstairs” Ty said, as he looked over Allen and his new briefs.<br />
<br />
“I know what you’d like to see, Allen” Ty chuckled, as he looked at the new, white briefs. Ty immediately understood that Allen had changed Tim into his briefs.<br />
<br />
“I wished for Kent’s muscles to grow in exact size and proportion with Peter’s muscles, so we need you to give it a test drive for us” Ty instructed. “Wanna demonstrate, Allen?”<br />
<br />
“Sure!”<br />
<br />
Allen never passed up the opportunity to make Peter’s muscles grow. He loves Peter’s body and he delighted in watching Peter’s muscles expand to whatever size he wanted.<br />
<br />
“Let’s add 30 pounds to Peter” Allen chuckled.<br />
<br />
Immediately Peter’s calves began to inflate, his quads became bigger, his abs popped out of his thin, flat torso, and his pectorals and his biceps expanded like someone was blowing air into a balloon. At the same time while Peter was growing, Kent gasped and began to look down at his own body, as he realized that his muscles were growing as well! Within moments, both Peter and Kent had become more muscular.<br />
<br />
Allen loved to watch the double muscle growth, and his member immediately hardened inside of his new briefs.<br />
<br />
While Allen looked down and felt the hardened cock rub against the new briefs, Peter and Kent were looking at their own bodies, which had gained thirty pounds in muscle. And Ty just stood there, laughing it up. <br />
<br />
Ty couldn’t contain himself, as he watched how the three men were just completely in awe of their transformations.</p>
