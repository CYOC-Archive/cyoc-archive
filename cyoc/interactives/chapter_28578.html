<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As you lift the pendant up to place around your neck, you suddenly hear the sound of tires squealing and horns honking.  You look to the road to see a sky blue 1976 Pontiac Firebird coming right at you.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Holy&quot; is all you can say before you slam your hands down on the hood of the car and the car stops.  You breath a big sigh of relief as you realize that you're still alive and you can stop your hands from shaking.  Lifting them up, you see where the pendant hit the car and left it's mark.  Before you can look at it any closer you hear the sound of someone cursing up a storm.  Your not surprised when you see it's the driver as he's getting out of his car.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn car, hell of a time for the brakes to go out on it like that.  Luckily they cut back on or else you'd 'ave been a smear on the sidewalk.  In fact are you sure your not somewhere under my car right now?&quot;<br />
<br />
You come to a pretty fair conclusion that this guy is off his rocker and the faster you get away from him the quicker you'll get to your date with Clarissa.  &quot;No, I'm fine, definitely standing in front of you,&quot; you assure him, &quot;but I'm really busy today so maybe we can talk some other time about this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, of course, no doubt you couldn't do to much damage to the car anyway, not like a telephone pole could.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway, I have to get going, busy day, date with my girlfriend and all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I got ya.  Well don't have to much fun then.&quot;  The old man grins at you like you just told him a joke.  &quot;Would ya like a ride there?&quot;<br />
<br />
You're pretty sure that he means taking you in the car that almost ran you over.  Apparently this is the day to start running because you take off down the street and head home.  You hurry and change your cloths to something a little more appropriate for your date.  You put on a nice pair of khaki pants and a white t-shirt with an unbuttoned green shirt over that.  You hop into your car and drive over to Clarissa's and run up to the door and knock.  Then two things happen.  One you don't like, that Clarissa opens the door in the middle of your knock.  The second almost blows you a way, to see Clarissa looking so beautiful.  You just want to pat yourself on the back that you were able to find such a foxy lady.  She's got her long blond hair pulled back into a pony tail and she just seems to look right into you with her blue eyes.  The color of sapphires, bright and glittering.  She's a little bit smaller then you but you like that about her too.  Really the only thing that you weren't falling for was her chest which was really on the small size.  You wondered what could possibly be keeping you from going further.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your late.&quot;<br />
<br />
That was it, Clarissa always pointing out your faults and forgiving you for not being as good as her.  You decide it's best to explain so the date can still happen after all the effort you've put into it.  &quot;Sorry Clarissa, I almost got ran over by a car and so that set me back a little.&quot;  Maybe it was what you said or maybe it's how you said it but you can tell that she doesn't really believe you.  &quot;But more importantly I was looking for a proper anniversary gift and so here it is.&quot;  You hold out the pendant to her and suddenly she gives up her tough front and stares at the pendant.  She reaches out for it to take it and you have this strange feeling that you don't want to give it up.  You don't pull it back but your not exactly giving it to her either.  Once she gets her hand on the pendant she grips it strongly and rips it from your weak grasp.  Holding the pendant up to the light, Clarissa turns around and walks back into her house.  You can't help feeling like she is taking something precious away from you.  You follow her in to the living room and close the door behind you.  Clarissa, entranced by her pendant begins to place it around her neck and you feel a strong desire to take it away from her, whether to protect her or so you can wear the pendant yourself you're not really sure.  You can only stare helplessly as she puts it on and as soon as she does the feeling disappears.  The dazed look on Clarissa also disappears and she looks at the pendant with a little confusion.  As if she was seeing the silver fox head with its ruby eyes for the first time.  She looks at you and asks,&quot;What's happening?&quot;  <br />
<br />
Unable to give a reply you stare at the pendant as strange writing appears across the pendant obscuring everything except for the ruby eyes which were glowing with a life of their own.  The light continued to grow brighter and brighter until you can hardly see Clarissa, let alone what's happening to her.<br />
<br />
Clarissa on the other hand was feeling out of sorts.  There she was berating you for being late and the next she had some strange jewelry that glowed.  She struggled to come to terms with this when she felt like she was being pulled.  She resisted the pull not wanting to know what would happen if she lost this struggle.  The fight was made all the more difficult as she felt soft fingers caress her body and let out a gasp of pleasure from the sensation.  She just wanted to let go and lose herself to those gentle hands as she was stroked and caressed.  Massaged and rubbed, making her feel lose and she knew that her grasp on her mind was weak and tenuous.  Almost frantically now, the fingers began pushing and prodding, pinching and slapping, striking and punching.  Her moment of pleasure was now replaced with bone jarring pain that felt like it was trying to brake her.  No longer gasping with pleasure but crying from the pain Clarissa tried to take it.  Then she noticed what was happening to her body.  Her hair was now the color of fine spun gold and it burst free from her pony tail and draped down her back to her butt.  Black stubby nails grew out of the points of her fingers and they couldn't come at a better time as Clarissa was in pain from how her clothes grew tight and constrained the many changes that were occurring.  She tore off the cloth and grinned fiercely at the sight of her now prominent breasts.  Then golden fur began sprouting all over her body until it gave her a nice coat with her the front of her from at least her neck down to her groin was a creamy white while the fur from her elbows to her fingers and from her mid-calf to her toes was a dark brown.  Looking behind her she saw that she had also grown 9 fluffy fox tails with white tips.  Then it all just stopped.  The light, the pain, mental and physical, and Clarissa was left stunned by the disappearance of the onslaught.  It had gone on for so long that she had almost forgotten there was anything else.  Clarissa was about to ask you something when stronger then before, the mental attack struck at her defenses until she didn't know whether she wanted to moan from pleasure or pain.  Whatever force that had been holding her up finally let her go and she collapsed to the ground.  And deep inside Clarissa thought she could hear laughter, dark and full of promise.  Of what Clarissa did not know but she was sure that she would find out.  She took comfort in the fact that throughout it all she hadn't completely given in.  Surely that would count for something.<br />
<br />
You are still trying to understand what is going on.  After the light disappeared, it revealed a goddess of flesh and fur that captivated you.  Tattered scraps of cloth that were once Clarissa's clothes lay on the ground and except for the golden fur on her body you see that she is naked.  With the pendant now lying prominently on her breasts, now the size of cantalopes, your sure that it's Clarissa.  Then she looks at you with her golden eyes and her luscious pink lips part as though she is about to ask you something when she grits her teeth in pain, showing off her canines and the fox ears on the top of her head spread out as though she were being pounded on the head.  It's to much for her and she falls to the ground, her nine tails splayed out all around her.  You think about drawing close and checking to see if she's alright when you hear a laughter that grows louder and louder and you know it's coming from her.  A laughter, dark and foreboding and you begin to wonder if really it's you that's in danger.</p>
