Kenya looked from Nate, to the ring, and then made a decision. Only stopping to grab the ring itself, she chased after him. Not caring one bit about the normal people staring at her. She grabbed his wrist and stared him in the eyes.<br />
<br />
“Nathaniel Anderson, please…” she said. Kenya held the ring in one hand, and looked like she was trying to put it on Nate. But Nate didn’t want her proposing with something someone else bought, and had intended for her to wear. <br />
<br />
“Save your breath Kenya. I’m not interested. Now leave me alone before I do something very stupid in front of all these nice people. I’m going to enjoy the rest of my Saturday, WITHOUT you. Call me tomorrow, maybe I’ll be in a better mood by then.” Nate said as coldly as he could. <br />
<br />
He walked back, knowing Kenya was silently crying behind him. There was a sharp pain in his heart as well, but he couldn’t turn around. Because if he did, he wasn’t sure what he’d do. Nate kept moving forward, and eventually walked straight into Ben, who’d been coming to talk to him. <br />
<br />
He hadn’t heard much of anything, but based on what Ben had seen, Kenya and Nate just hit a serious road bump. Maybe worse. <br />
<br />
“Do you want to talk at all man?” Ben asked. <br />
<br />
“No, thanks for the offer. I’m here to have fun, regardless of whatever distractions may show up.” Nate said. <br />
<br />
Ben didn’t argue, he could see Nate was pretty upset. Every now and then, Nate would blink and a tear would well up in his eyes. But Ben knew better than to press. Nate needed some space to himself to come to terms with whatever just happened. <br />
<br />
Nate sat under a tree, and then slammed his head back against it. <br />
<br />
“How could you be so stupid? How could you let her play you like this?” Nate angrily thought to himself. He should have realized something was up from the beginning. Then none of this would have happened. <br />
<br />
“Hey, want one?” Nate looked up and saw Skylar standing over him with one hand stretched out holding a soda. <br />
<br />
“Thanks.” Nate took the drink, and drank at least half of it as soon as the can touched his lips. <br />
<br />
“Wow, someone was thirsty.” Skylar remarked, opening her own drink. <br />
<br />
“I guess so.” <br />
<br />
“Look, I don’t know what happened between you and your girlfriend, but don’t let it get to you. Everyone screws up.” <br />
<br />
“Well this was one hell of a screw up.” Nate sighed. <br />
<br />
“Maybe. But look at it this way, if it wasn’t meant to be it wasn’t meant to be. Heartbreak is just a part of life. And trust me, it does get better. Takes a while, but it does.” Skylar said before walking off. Nate watched her go, unsure what to make of the girl. <br />
<br />
“Little early to be playing the field don’t ya think sis?” Asar raised a brow at his sister when she rejoined the group. <br />
<br />
“Oh be quiet. I’m just trying to be nice. Do you honestly think I’d be trying to make a move on a guy right after he broke up with someone? How shallow do you think I am?” Skylar shook her head at Asar in distaste. <br />
<br />
“Fair enough. I wonder what went on with Nate and that girl?” <br />
<br />
“Who knows. But it’s between those two, so don’t go asking questions. You’re like the most insensitive person I know.” <br />
<br />
“Hey!” <br />
<br />
“Sorry bro, it’s the truth. You want a relationship, try caring about the other person.” Skylar patted her brother’s chest and then went to talk to her girlfriends. She stole one more look back at Nate, who was now staring at the ground. Skylar thought she saw tears falling from his face. She didn’t know Nate at all, but still felt sorry for the guy. <br />
<br />
“The two were probably pretty serious. Otherwise he wouldn’t be reacting this way. I wonder how she’s doing,” Skylar thought. <br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Jack Ashford was spending his Saturday afternoon in his penthouse, flipping through a book and waiting for Kenya to give him an answer. He knew it was sudden, and very unexpected, but after spending who knows how man nights with her, Jack couldn’t imagine going to bed without her by his side. And he never wanted to wake up without her either. <br />
<br />
He was lying in bed, still in his fursona when he got a call. Alfred had the day off, which was fine with Jack. Truthfully he didn’t need any servants, but his father insisted. And it was either have someone watching out for Jack, or installing security cameras in his own home. <br />
<br />
“Yes?” Jack gently pressed the intercom button beside his bed with his claw. <br />
<br />
“Sir, there’s a woman here to see you. One… Kendra Smythe.” <br />
<br />
“Thank you, tell her to come up.” <br />
<br />
Jack hadn’t been expecting her to come back so soon. She’d only been gone about three hours. Which was pretty fast. Was she coming to turn him down? It didn’t take that long to say no. Jack understood why she would reach that conclusion, but still held out hope he might persuade her to stay. <br />
<br />
He got up, and slowly shifted back to answer the door. Slipping on a pair of boxers and a random shirt, he went to meet Kenya, Kendra, whatever she wanted to call herself. Jack didn’t care. As long as she was happy. Which he found she clearly wasn’t when he opened the door. <br />
<br />
The man downstairs left out the part about her crying and shaking. Jack had no idea what happened, but he quickly pulled her inside and into a tight hug. After a quick sniff, he realized she must have been with her boyfriend. <br />
<br />
Jack half carried Kenya to his couch, and sat her down. She continued to silently cry on his shoulder, until Jack finally asked her if she wanted to talk. She shook her head. So they sat in silence for the time being. <br />
<br />
Jack started to stroke her hair, from the back of her head down to the middle of her back. Call it a reflex, but Kenya started to purr (as much as someone in their normal form can purr) in response. The sound made Jack VERY happy, and he did his best to hide that. A tough task since he was just in boxers. <br />
<br />
Kenya looked down and saw this. She then turned to look at Jack’s face. His deep brown eyes are just like Nate’s. They are brimming with kindness, and concern. Well, that’s how Nate’s eyes used to be. The only thing Kenya saw in them now was betrayal and anger. She’d ruined their relationship. But at least she still had this one. Because she really needed a friendly shoulder to cry on. <br />
<br />
“More than friendly” some voice said in her mind. Kenya pushes those thoughts away and leans against Jack’s body. Jack wraps an arm around her, and the two are spooning on the couch, each making their own sounds of contentment.</p>
