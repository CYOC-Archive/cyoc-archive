<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After dinner, Jamie was back in her new teenage like room as she was in her extra large Taylor Swift T-shirt and having only her panties on.  Lying on her bed with her headphones on her head, she listened to one of Taylor&#39;s song while tapping her foot to the beat.  While she never understood Swift back when she was just a mother, she was starting to understand why teen girls want to be her.  She could even take a liking to enjoying her music.<br />
<br />
&quot;Got to admit, Taylor Swift is certainly a talented pop star.  Maybe when I get back to normal, I can enjoy listening to her tunes.&quot; she said as she was humming.<br />
<br />
Thinking of that, Jamie was surprised at how much a few hours have changed her and her family.  First she became a teenager to be Jeff&#39;s twin.  Then due to her no longer a mom, turned your young daughter into the mother instead.  But suddenly, Jeff made a few more adjustments where she no longer have siblings.  Instead, Joey, the older brother, became a grandfather and Jeff is the father.  She was upset over the fact that she doesn&#39;t have brothers to look up to, however, they seem happy in their roles.  Even if its for a week, she could get use to Jeff and Amy playing the parents role while Joey and Mary play the grandparents role.  But then, a thought occurred to her.  What about her?  Indeed, Jamie is now a teenager, but she has no clue what&#39;s in store for her.  While she got a second chance in life for a week, she doesn&#39;t know what surprised are awaiting her.<br />
<br />
Peering down, she could see that she got her luggage packed up and ready to go to her grandparents house for the week.  At least she knows that she&#39;ll be staying with them while mom and dad will be away on an anniversary holiday.<br />
<br />
The thought of that made her smirk, &quot;Heh...  Mom and dad...  That&#39;s something I need to get use to.&quot; she said with that thought.<br />
<br />
But then, looking down to the floor, she noticed what appears to be some sort of scrap book with a creative cover and the picture of her in the front with the title reading, &#39;Jamie&#39;s Memories&#39; with cut outs of shapes and characters around it.  Looking at this, she rubbed her chin that thought, &quot;Maybe I should take a good look on what this new life I have is about.  I mean, going to be living as a teenage for a week.  Might as well be prepared for what&#39;s to come tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
Getting off the bed and removing the headphones, she bend down and picked up the book to see see what is inside.  Opening it up, she sits down and starts to skim through what surprised are in store for her.<br />
<br />
Getting to the first pages, you could see that the book was showing each year of her life.  Starting with the day she was born with an Ultra sound of her as a fetus on and a picture of a positive test on one page and the other showing her birth with her mother, former younger daughter, cradling the newborn with a few extra pictures of her sleeping soundly.  Above is the the date she was born and while the month and day is the same, the year was completely different as it says that she was born on 2009 and not 1977, the original year she was born.  With that though, she chuckled and said, &quot;Guess that means I was officially born on the same year Jeff was.  I&#39;m amazed how accurate the Chronivac can accomplish that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Going through the pages, Jamie could see so much accomplishments at a young age.  Her first steps, her first words, her many birthdays.  All of which show childish cutouts and drawings that Jamie did around it for fun and not realizing it was her scrapbook.  She finds it all to be so cute.<br />
<br />
By the time she got to five, it was her first day of preschool and she was standing in the photo of the school entrance with her mother and father.  The next picture showed her sitting in the sandbox with two girls around the same age as her, one looking like a black girl and the other looking like an Asian girl.  Starring at the two, a small part of her mind was picking something up.  &quot;Wait...  Are these my friends?  They look very familiar...&quot;<br />
<br />
Continuing going through the pages, she could see that each year turn, it shows her getting older as the cutout starting to look more mature and the drawings were getting less childish.  By age ten, she could see herself competing in athletics and looks like she took part of acrobatics, running, and climbing, she could even see pictures of her achieving so much with her on the podium holding her medals and trophies.  Seeing that, she smirked and said, &quot;Guess I was at the year where I was very competitive.  I mean, it makes sense...&quot; she looked up at the shelf to see the trophies and medals still standing there.  &quot;I was such an athletic girl.  Guess it the quirks of growing up in this new life.&quot;<br />
<br />
Continuously flipping through the pages, she could see herself growing into her teens and experiencing teen like problems.  From periods, to junior high, to even crushes, she was becoming quite the teen.  Even the cutouts were that of teen heartthrobs then cartoon characters while the drawings showed a bit of a rebellious side of her.  It was then that she stopped at 16, her current age, while the rest of the pages were blank for more years to add.  It was then she got a clear picture.<br />
<br />
Looking through each page, she could see her and her friends growing up.  Once she sees the current year, she could see a black teenage girl with a mature body complete with big C cup breasts and curvy waistline and round booty with long black braided hair.  The other is a thin teenage Japanese girl with perky a cups and boyish hips and long glowing black and straight hair.  Starring at the two, she starts to realize who they were.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait a sec...  I know these two.  They are the girls I came across when I pick Jeff up from school back when I was a mom.  They always look up to me when I waited for him and claim that I was a role model to them.  How surprising that I would be friends with them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Skimming through the pictures, she saw the three of them dressed up in cheerleading uniforms.  Memories soon picked up on Jamie and remembered that moment.  It turned out, they were part of the cheerleading team and surprising enough, she is the head cheerleader.  She recalled that some Latin teen girl that was spoiled and rotten was the head cheerleader, now that she has become one, there is a positive morale of the cheer team as she was the most respected compared to the previous one.  With a smirk, she said, &quot;And I am the head cheerleader for the team.  Quite a sudden change of dynamic.  Hmm...  Wonder how that Latina bitch would feel.&quot;<br />
<br />
As she finished up with her look back in her new memory lane, there is one photo she encountered that looked like she took in secret.  In the distance, it was a young Filipinno teenage with bronze skin and a toned build for his time in basketball with shaved black hair, a suffle on his chin and upper lip, and dressed in a basketball jersey, shorts, and sneakers playing basketball with his friends in the gym.  Starring at him, a new memory popped up in her and remembered who she is.  &quot;Wait a minute...  Isn&#39;t that Antonio, Jeff&#39;s best friend?  I know he always talks to me when he&#39;s with Jeff, but why is he in that photo?  Unless...&quot;<br />
<br />
The memory soon altered as she felt a little flushed and realized why she had that photo.  Turned out, when she lost her husband, she was pretty much lonely and wished for a new one.  Since then, she always looked to Antonio with Jeff as they talked and envisioned him as the husband when he&#39;s older.  But now that she was a teenager, her hormones were acting up and she felt a flustered with horniness.  Seeing him on just the picture, a thought immediately occurred to her.  &quot;OMG!  Antonio is my crush!  I&#39;m immediately in love with him.  I know he is a sweet kid and all, but now...  I couldn&#39;t help but to have a certain affection with him.&quot;  Just thinking of that, a devious smirk spread across Jamie&#39;s face and erotic images played into her teenage mind.  &quot;Hmm...  Would it be wrong to go on a date with my son&#39;s friend?  I mean, Jeff&#39;s now my dad and Amy is my mom...  Just the idea in dating a friend of his seems wrong as a mom.  But now as a teen, I couldn&#39;t help but to be around him.  Just imagine the thought of him and me together in one room...&quot;  She soon squeezed her breast and moaned at the sheer thought of it.  She soon slipped her hand into her panties and rubbed her clint, self masterbating and thinking of Antonio on top of her, both fully naked and making out on bed.  The pleasure soon intensify as her teenage hormones were growing and her moans were getting louder.<br />
<br />
Almost instantly, her eyes snapped opened and and stopped herself.  &quot;Shit!  I forgot teens have quite the hormones. <br />
 I need to get use to that.&quot;  The moment she regained control, she said, &quot;Calmed down Jamie...  Remember this is only a week until we are all back to normal.  I mean the idea of getting knocked up and the effects is permanent would be really concerning.  I just hope that Jeff and Amy-er...dad and mom won&#39;t think of the same thing.  Otherwise, I would have to grow up all over again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Closing her scrap book, she stretched and yawned, wanting to rest before her new life as a teenager.  &quot;Regardless I should enjoy this life while I can.  It&#39;s not every day and middle age mother can be a teen for a week and live it to the fullest, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Getting back on the bed, she pulled the covers over her and turned off the lamp on the night stand.  Looking up at the ceiling with the glow in the dark stars, she futtered her eyes and said, &quot;I can&#39;t wait to start school again.  I can only imagine what it would be like this time...&quot;  She soon closed her eyes and went to sleep, dreaming teenage dreams and hoping for a fun and exciting adventure.</p>
