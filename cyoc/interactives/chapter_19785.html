<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle felt a tingling all over his body, and a churning beneath his skin.  He felt it before he saw it: His thin frame began to thicken as a layer of fat developed all over his body.  His clothes quickly became tight and he hurriedly stripped them off to avoid being constricted.  <br />
<br />
In the mirror he saw his torso swelling, his legs thickening, and his face growing rounder.  While he knew that getting fat was obviously part of the transformation, he knew that Rich wouldn't have stopped there.  He studied his body fearfully as it grew for signs of other changes, and his heart started pounding when he noticed the first of them: <br />
<br />
His chest was growing at a decidedly faster rate than the rest of him, his new man-boobs suddenly developing a roundness and heft that was unmistakably female.  Trembling, he grabbed his chest and pressed the growing flesh against his body, trying in vain to hold back its growth; his only reward was increasingly large handfuls of breast that slowly outgrew the span of his hands.  He let go and his new breasts plopped heavily on his chest, still growing, and he was shocked to see the size of his nipples.  They weren't the exaggerated, long nipples that he had given Jennifer and Rich, but his areolas were huge, with thick female nipples that would give any baby a gaping mouthful.  <br />
<br />
Seeing his belly swelling beneath his breasts, he took a step back from the mirror and felt his ass and legs jiggling like mad beneath him.  In the mirror he saw a truly huge pair of hips continuing to grow at his sides.  He turned and was shocked at the size and the unmistakably female shape of his bottom, which seemed to move with a life of its own, sending ripples down his huge thighs.  His fattening knees were developing a huge bulge of chub on the inside of his legs, and his calves had grown quite round and thick, also jiggling as he took a step.  <br />
<br />
As he reached around back to feel his ass growing, his attention was drawn to the thick pillows of fat that had developed around his upper arms -- they hung pendulously and he felt them dragging across the rolls of fat that were growing under his arms as his breasts filled out around his sides.  He held his arms out at his sides and felt the heavy fat swaying beneath them.  <br />
<br />
None of this, however, prepared him for the sight of his face.  That it had grown round and heavy, with a considerable double chin and thick, full lips, was no surprise.  But after a lifetime of seeing his own face in the mirror, and a male face at that, the sight of himself with a girl's face made him feel completely unreal.  His eyebrows had thinned, his nose had rounded and shrunken slightly, and his hair had grown to shoulder length, leaving him with a face that still looked vaguely like his own, or like a very fat twin sister.  He didn't want to be a girl!  <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my GOD&quot;, he said, seeing the round fat girl's face in the mirror talking as if it were someone else.  This was quickly followed by his shock at the female voice that rang from his throat.  It wasn't overly high-pitched, but it was clearly female, and it had a thick sound befitting a fat girl.  <br />
<br />
He felt a pulling in his groin as his genitals started shrinking -- they had been pressed between his heavy thighs and were now receding into him.  He spread his feet a bit wider apart to make room for the movement but couldn't see what was going on beneath his protruding stomach.  In the mirror he saw the last visible remnants of his manhood disappear into the folds of fat between his legs, where he felt his balls pop uncomfortably one at a time back inside his body.  He was almost glad that he couldn't see the rest of what happened down there, but the final state of things wasn't hard to imagine.  <br />
<br />
By now he had become huge.  His belly bulged out and had begun to hang heavily over the tops of his legs, and his arms were no longer able to hang straight down at his sides.   He tried to approach the mirror and felt a bit stuck, settling back where he was standing; he had to swing his arm to get started and then had to waddle considerably so his thighs would be able to rub past one another.  He felt his belly bouncing against the front of his legs and his breasts moving back and forth -- they had grown to truly impressive dimensions, much bigger than the breasts he had given Jennifer and Rich.  They even looked huge on a fat girl.  He felt humiliated at having to waddle so dramatically, but he just couldn't keep his body going forward otherwise.  He felt the cheeks of his four-foot-wide rump bobbling up and down with each step.  <br />
<br />
His growth began to slow as his weight settled around 475 pounds.  His legs were starting to get tired from supporting his weight.  His entire body jiggling like mad, he waddled over to the chair in the corner, but quickly realized that this chair had arms, and that there was no way he could fit his beanbag-chair-sized ass into it, never mind getting it back out again.  He waddled over to the bed and slowly lowered his bulk to sit on the edge.  The bed creaked and he sank into it much more than he was used to, and had to lean back slightly, supporting himself with his arms, to keep all the fat in front of him from bunching up.  He spread his thick legs and felt his heavy belly fall down between his legs to hang over his crotch, which allowed him to sit a bit more upright.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Could this be it?&quot; Kyle thought to himself.  &quot;He just turned me into a fat girl?&quot;  He started to feel relieved.  While he wasn't thrilled about living the rest of his life as an immensely fat female, he had expected much worse, something truly beastly and hideous.  <br />
<br />
Feeling somewhat rested, he struggled to his feet.  He had to lean back and rock forward hard to get himself moving off the bed, and his legs groaned as he rose unsteadily to stand, his ass slowly settling behind him.  He felt a crushing humiliation at seeing his huge reflection across the room.  Every inch of his body was voluptuously, exaggeratedly female.  He waddled over to the mirror to get a better look at himself.</p>
