<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Stepping through the staff door Antonio was surprised by the level of security here, just for a backstage area they had two uniformed guards either side of the door on the way in, both packing some serious firepower, a magnum strapped to both of their hips, which they were more than happy to demonstrate as Antonio followed Kat through the door, the cold steel of their firearms pressed against his temples, a chill running down his spine for a moment as he heard both gun hammers cock back, Antonio sent a charge through his body, the Cyberware along his spine jolting to life.<br />
<br />
[SYSTEM: Bioplastic blood vessels]<br />
[ENGAGED]<br />
[SUBSYSTEM: Kerensikov MK3]<br />
<br />
A familiar feeling of time slowing to a crawl surrounded Antonio, setting straight to work he took the both guns out of the guards hands, spinning around and aimed the loaded weapons at their previous wielders, time speeding back up once he deactivadet the Kerensikov systems.<br />
Both guards blinked in confusion before Antonio shoved both weapons in their faces<br />
&quot;Guys, after the day I&#39;ve had, pointing a gun at me has gotta be the most fucking stupid thing you&#39;ve done in your lives&quot; Antonio growled, his fingers over the triggers as both guards backed off, suddenly the sound of clapping echoes through the hallway, turning around to see Mantis holding the Cybergirl out of the way, and Kat clapping in applause<br />
&quot;Impressive, very impressive, you&#39;ve got some serious chrome and some serious balls my guy&quot; she commended before raising an eyebrow at him<br />
&quot;Now can you please put those toys down, blood is so hard to get off the walls&quot; Kat sighed, Antonio not even attempting to return the firearms to their owners, stuffing both in his back pockets as he walked past, Mantis giving him a smile and nod of approval as they followed Kat into the dancers changing room.<br />
<br />
The room was lined with tables, mirrors, lights, smoke and the overwhelming scent of perfume and other beauty products that Antonio didn&#39;t even know the name of, lockers lining the wall, and at least a dozen dancers all preparing to perform, some completely naked, their round cute asses and tits of all sizes on full display, one girl who seemed to be chromed up more than the others had taken off the plate that covered her chest, exchanging it for one with H cup tits attached to it, freckles accross the robust cleavage.<br />
Another dancer had one leg up on her dressing stool, pulling up a stocking over her Cybernetic leg, wearing the shortest miniskirt possible, revealing her cleanly shaved pussy to the room.<br />
Just then one dancer spotted Antonio, Her eyes a bright pink, dark chocolate skin and curled puffy black hair in an afro style, wearing the shortest pair of jean shorts Antonio had ever seen, A bright pink thong visible high on her hips, the top button of her shorts undone revealing a small peak at her dark pubic hair.<br />
And a bra so small it may as well have been a bikini, two triangles of striped grey fabric over her nipples with a few strings connecting it all together, tied into a bow behind her neck<br />
&quot;Hey there big guy, not supposed to be back here, you looking to get into a bit of trouble?&quot; She purred, stroking her hand up Antonios leg, in an instant Mantis was at his side, her hand grasped tightly around the dancers arm<br />
&quot;Hey bitch, hands off, this one&#39;s taken&quot; she growled, the strippers glowing eyes narrowing as she slapped Mantis&#39;s hand off her before turning back to her morror, clearly thinking it wasn&#39;t worth the trouble.<br />
<br />
Once Antonio and Mantis caught up with Kat she stepped into a side room, curtained off by a string of dangling glowing pink beads, chained together until they hit the floor, parting the curtain and taking a seat accross from Kat, Mantis and the Cybergirl sitting close beside him, the young girl clinging to Mantis as she curiously stared around the room.<br />
Kat reached accross to a table and pulled out a cigarette putting it to her lips and cupped her hand under its end, bringing her other hand up to the cigarette, her index finger spliting in half and folding in opposite directions before an open flame erupted from the tip, taking a strong pull from her lit cigarette and blew a heavy cloud up into the air<br />
&quot;Alright, let&#39;s hear the amount of shit you got yourselves in, tangling with Kovastov is already about as bad as it gets&quot; she sighed heavily before returning the lit tailpipe to her lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you see this girl?&quot; Mantis started, jutting her head in the girls direction &quot;she was what Kovastovs boys were transporting, apparently had her stashed away in a sealed container inside the armored truck, and trust me, the kids packing some serious chrome&quot;<br />
This made Kat freeze, looking at the girl as her eyes turned a bright orange, scanning the cybergirl thoroughly, before stopping abruptly, her eyes returning to normal, taking a shaky breath before blowing out an uneven cloud<br />
&quot;What the fuck is she?&quot; Kat asked in a shaky voice<br />
&quot;Why the fuck would you bring something as heavily armed as her into my place of business?&quot; Now looking at Mantis with horrified eyes, Mantis giving her an apologetic look<br />
&quot;I know but we couldn&#39;t leave her anywhere or with anyone, and you owe me a favour or two, so I&#39;m here to collect&quot; she said with determination, this seemed to snap Kat back to the matter at hand<br />
&quot;Alright alright, never let it be said that the tiger doesn&#39;t keep pay her debts&quot; Kat boasted, jutting her chest out with pride.<br />
&quot;What do you need from me then?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mantis took a deep breath, leaning forward, clasping her hands together and resting her chin on them<br />
&quot;Kat, I need you to give us accomodations, here if possible, just until things quiet down, or until we can think of something&quot; she said in an earnest tone.<br />
Kat was silent for a long while, taking long pulls of her cigarette and releasing clouds in smooth breaths, before letting out a groan<br />
&quot;Ughhhh, fine, you guys can stay with me until you figure something out, if you want you can stay with me at my place&quot; she sighed, putting her hand over her face, leaning back into the seat<br />
&quot;This is us square Mantis, anything after this I&#39;m not liable&quot; she warned.<br />
<br />
Antonio chose to pipe up at this point<br />
&quot;Look, we don&#39;t intend on being dead weight around here, you got a job, a hit, anything, we&#39;ll be there and get it done, no bullshit&quot; he said with confidence in his voice, leaning forward on the table towards Kat, who eyes him up and down with fascination<br />
&quot;Dam Mantis, you got yourself a man with a set of balls made of steel, from what I&#39;ve seen of you so far I&#39;m impressed, but don&#39;t push your luck, you talk the talk, but we&#39;ll soon see if you walk the walk, or trip like a drunk&quot; she smirked, standing up with a stretch, sighing in satisfaction.<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon then, let&#39;s get you three squared away in my place&quot; she called as she walked back out into the changing room, beakoning for them to follow her, Antonio smirking slightly as he heard the sound of a slap, followed by a squeak, Antonio coming from the side room just in time to watch Kat spank the ass of the black dancer on her way past, her big dark ass jiggling from the impact, looking back as Antonio followed Kat the dancer grinned evily, bending over on her dresser, shaking her ass at Antonio before giving it a spank.<br />
Now slightly arroused Antonio struggled to hide the sizable bulge in his trousers as he walked by, glancing the dancer make eye contact with the dent his cock made, licking her lips with hungry eyes.<br />
With that Antonio quickened his pace out of the dressing room with Kat, Mantis and the girl close behind him, A chill running down his spine as Mantis bumped his shoulder as she passed him, muttering and growling to herself as she went.<br />
__________________________________________________<br />
<br />
Antonio looked around in amazement as Kat opened the door to her private penthouse, the door swinging open to reveal a large pristine room, the flooring metallic and patterned with hexagons, the room was lined with a with glass overlooking the city, the corner curved with angled pillars at both curves ends, a U shaped white couch sat in the center of the room, a black red and pink square carpet underneath with a round glass coffee table in front, a lone egg shaped seat on the opposite side, behind the couch was a solid wall, a large flat screen mounted, and a set of stairs bleeding to a room above, blocked from view from thw mirrored ceiling.<br />
<br />
There was also what looked like the remains of a brick wall placed along the wall next to the front door, the bricks painted a shade of white with big black letters spelling &#39;THE HAMMER&#39; written on it, as well as an old guitar case leaning up against it, a large modern art painting displayed behind it.<br />
<br />
Kat walked in like she didn&#39;t have a care in the world, bottle in hand and tailpipe hanging from her mouth as she leaned onto her couch, putting her bottle on the glass table and extended her arms out wide<br />
&quot;Welcome to your home away from home, bedrooms are upstairs on the left, bathroom is first shutter on your right, please keep the kid from wrecking any of my shit&quot; she chuckled before yelling out at the young girl as she zipped over to pick up the guitar case with curious fascination<br />
&quot;Hey that&#39;s not a toy!&quot; Kat snapped as she yanked it from her grasp, putting it back in its spot with the utmost care, letting out a sigh as ste pinched the bridge of her nose<br />
&quot;Please, just keep grabby fingers here under control, il talk with my guys now, see about getting her to be more talkative, maybe fit her a cybernetic lower face&quot; she offered, Mantis instantly coming forward and hugging her friend, Kat shook her head and sighed with a smile<br />
&quot;Awwww don&#39;t go getting sappy on me now, just help out wherever you can and keep out of trouble and we&#39;re good&quot; she said, patting Mantis on the back before heading out of the door, tossing Antonio a spare keycard from under the front door mat, closing the door behind herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice place huh?&quot; Antonio remarked, taking in the room once again, Mantis smiled at him in response before walking over to the couch and collapsed into its seat the events of the day finally catching up with her, she looked emotionaly and mentally drained, Antonio walked over and sat beside her, putting an arm around her waist and pulling her into his embrace<br />
&quot;Hey it&#39;s gonna be ok, we&#39;re with Kat now, she promised to let us stay until something is worked out, plus with the tigers now watching our back we can at least relax a little&quot; he said optimistically, however his words were met with a light snore, smiling down at her as he kissed her head gently Antonio eased her back so she could lay down.<br />
Looking out towards the city he watched the girl with her hands and face pressed against the glass, and only one question burned in his mind.</p>
