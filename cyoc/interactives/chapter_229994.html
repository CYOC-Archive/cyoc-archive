<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">just as Chris was about to down the vial Kane stopped him. &quot;wait&quot; the dragon said. Kane then explained something. &quot;I remember being Katherine. I was only messing with you because of the coffee prank you pulled&quot; Kane scratched his neck as he looked embarrassed. &quot;what!&quot; Chris said making the former woman flinch. &quot;I was planning on drinking it myself. I poured it into the coffee on the right intending to give you the one on the left. then I had to use the restroom and came back to you drinking the one on the right&quot; Chris was switching from anger to sadness as tears rolled down his cheeks.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I thought I lost my mother so I was gonna prove to you this vial case was real and let you do what you wanted with it&quot; Chris was soon embraced by Kane who wiped the tears away with his power. &quot;I&#39;m so sorry. I just felt so different and thought it would be funny.&quot; glancing at the case with the vials with confusion. he sensed great power coming from each liquid. the case itself was no bigger than a gift box. however, each time he glanced back at one section inside he found more vials each time he looked.  <br />
<br />
he picked one up and read the contents. on it was labeled with a male symbol surrounded by a heart. somehow he was able to read this as &quot;sexual preference: male&quot; he didn&#39;t feel he needed it as he was still fond of his late husband. setting it back down he picked up the vial right next to it. this one was similar but with a female symbol in place of the male one. &quot;where did you get this Chris?&quot; Kane asked.  <br />
<br />
for some reason, he was getting an urge to down the vial&#39;s contents. most likely the magic of this thing. &quot;it was sent to us. I wanted to try it but you got it instead&quot; Chris said. he noticed the lid off of the vial Kane was holding. &quot;guess I want to try something too&quot; Kane said before he downed the contents. he put the vial back in its place and it filled back up.  <br />
<br />
suddenly Kane felt horny as images of beautiful girls he knew thought his life flashed before his eyes. Chris noticed a bulge on the dragon&#39;s cock. coming out of it Kane noticed it and apologized. &quot;it seems the vials have enchantments on them so people find and use what they want. I always preferred liking men until I changed. then somehow I found what I wanted in the case.&quot; Kane said before turning to the bathroom.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m gonna be gone a while.&quot; he then rushed to the bathroom and slammed the door shut. looking down at the vial Chris realized what Kane had said about the vials was true. in his hands was the dragon anthro vial from earlier. he was fully intending to pick a random vial yet he picked the same one. could this case of vials truly give you what you want?  <br />
<br />
picking up a second vial proved yes. this one depicts the world with three rippling circles. one was at the center he somehow read this as &quot;reality normalization&quot; Flipping the vial he read it would make the change acceptable to everyone but not change anything in reality. it would only make the last change normal so he would need to use it after each change. glancing down he saw the vial next to it had a similar design but the world looked warped. &#39;guess that&#39;s the reality alteration vial&#39; he thought.  <br />
<br />
setting down the second vial he opened the dragon vial. As he did this the bathroom door opened. &quot;hey. Guess those vials make yeah horny or something&quot; Kane said as he approached Chris. &quot;yeah well I wanted to do this myself so&quot; Chris quickly downed the contents of the vial. putting the vial back in the case and both of them saw it refill instantly.  <br />
<br />
soon, however, they heard a door open. &quot;Mom, Chris is breakfast ready?&quot; Tanya called out. feeling the effects of the vial Chris quickly grabbed the reality normalization vial and gave it to Kane. &quot;drink this fast&quot; was all he said as he left the room. he bumped into Tanya as he rushed to his room he swears he could feel his genitals shift and change as he ran.  <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
back in the kitchen, Kane downed the contents right as Tanya entered. suddenly Kane felt a burst of energy flow out of his body in all directions. the second it passed through Tanya her face went from shocked to having a small smile. &quot;and who are you?&quot; she said while approaching the anthro. Kane smelled her getting aroused slightly and nipped it in the bud.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Tanya I was your mother. also, I&#39;m still 36 years old&quot; Kane said. this snapped her out of it instantly. &quot;whoa, sorry. you looked so appealing when I saw you&quot; Tanya apologized. She was embarrassed by both her actions and smell. still holding the vial he just drank he flipped to read the side effects.  <br />
<br />
one major one stood out to him. &quot;may increase admiration and arousal on oneself from others. will not affect people already in a relationship. &quot;it is okay. like I said I was your mother but after I changed I became something different&quot; Kane said as he put the vial back. he then explained who he was now and how he came to be. &quot;wait Chris seriously wanted to drink a mysterious liquid that he had no idea where it came from?&quot; she asked Kane. &quot;well it seems enchanted to do so. it doesn&#39;t seem malicious in intent&quot; Kane said as he made breakfast. While he may have been a different person now he still knew what he was doing. he then set three plates of eggs and hash browns down at the table. &quot;Chris breakfast is ready,&quot; he said. Chris&#39;s door soon opened. <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Chris had stripped down after entering his room. his cock was now almost as large as Kane&#39;s. its grey base swelled with a knot while its upper half became blood red. he moaned a bit as his testicles swelled to the size of shot puts. like Kane, his mind was filled with lust as he gripped his new cock.  <br />
<br />
a sheath formed around it as his hands began to change. pure white claws dotted each digit teal scales covered them as they swelled with power. they stopped just before his elbows as a silver line of scales cut them off. the same scales soon covered his sheath and balls and spread up his torso in a curved shape. on the inside, more teal scales grew while on the outside deep blue scales began covering most of his body.  <br />
<br />
five pure white curved spikes grew on his shoulders while more dotted his now chiseled chin. the teal scales stopped right at his lower jaw as a horn grew on his expanding muzzle. two larger horns grew in above his now finned ears. the one on the right was perfectly curved with thin lines embedded in it. the left however was taller and more jagged in its curve.  <br />
<br />
this asymmetrical appearance seemed to only enhance his handsomeness. As this was happening his less changed. like the rest of him, he gained muscle and height. on the front of his thighs and knees bumps of pure silver grew. right after his knees silver scales covered his calves and feet.  <br />
<br />
much like Kane, he too lost a toe. the remaining toes gained claws only slightly larger than his hands. a long tail grew from his spine. the underside was silver while the upper side was blue. a series of large curved spikes ran down its length as he cumed. two large wings grew from his back as he did so.   <br />
<br />
They were blue with white spikes on the tops and bottoms. the membrane between started teal and transitioned to white as it went down. Chris then opened his still blue eyes and looked at the massive amount of cum he let out onto his room. like Kane his mind had altered some. he simply waved his hand as blue flames floated harmlessly from them.  <br />
<br />
the cum then was consumed in blue flames. once it was done in its place was a round sapphire with a carved image of a dragon on it. Chris was now a dragon of shape. he knew he could now alter anything without a mind, be it plant or stone. he then made the stone float onto his desk.  <br />
<br />
he was about to leave when he realized his clothes wouldn&#39;t fit his new form. he used his powers to turn them into a mirror to see the full extent of the vial&#39;s power. he noticed he was not as buff as Kane nor was he as tall. coming to 7&#39;8&quot; he was still a 16-year-old boy, or rather dragon.  &quot;Chris breakfast is ready&quot; he heard Kane say.  <br />
<br />
smiling he had the mirror engulfed in blue flames that flowed onto him. he now wore a sleeveless white shirt. an open cyan vest with bronze encircling the arm holes was on top of it. its collar was white and it had a white ascot. a piece of gold molded in a bow-type shape with four round jewels running down it.  <br />
<br />
a bronze belt wrapped around his cyan pants. fools of gold lined the edges of his pockets. a pair of tan gloves covered his hands. slightly covering them were white wrappings and a cyan armband on his wrists. steel boots acted as armor for his feet. his magic made them as malleable as cloth and as comfy as slippers. they had no top front allowing his toes to be exposed. feeling satisfied with his attire he quickly exited the flames and his room.  <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Tanya was surprised as a blue muscular dragon anthro left her brother&#39;s room. &quot;sorry sis forgot to take the other vial&quot; the dragon said. while deeper with a slight rumble it sounded similar to her brother. he passed them and went to the case from earlier. picking out a vial he drank.  <br />
<br />
she could not see the wave or energy ripple quickly out from her brother&#39;s body. thankfully knowing who he was beforehand kept the young virgin from hitting on him. &quot;sorry didn&#39;t want a mob on me when I go out in this form.&quot; he then sat down in his seat, or he tried to. his tail now at an odd angle as was the rest of him while he sat. Kane meanwhile seemed to be sitting on nothing but air. &quot;one would think being related we would both be eastern&quot; Kane said as he ate his eggs.  <br />
<br />
&quot;yeah well, I guess it&#39;s random. either that or it&#39;s a form you think a dragon should be&quot; Chris said his appetite demanding food. getting fed up with his chair he waved his hand. the two others in the room saw blue flames emerge from between his fingers and the chair caught on fire. Tanya freaked out and bolted back from the table. this of course made her chair fall and she almost went to the ground.  <br />
<br />
however, a sudden rush of wind and pink petals made sure she landed safely. getting back up the two looked at Chris. Tanya was pissed while Kane hid a smile as he continued eating. Chris was now sitting comfy in a throne chair.  it was silver with blue cloth.  <br />
<br />
&quot;sorry it was an instinct&quot; Chris made up his excuse as he saw his sister&#39;s face. &quot;um... anyway I&#39;m a dragon of shape now,&quot; he said while eating his food. his hand lifted and the chair Tanya was sitting in rose while surrounded by transparent blue flames. &quot;You haven&#39;t changed have you,&quot; Kane said indicating to his mind rather than his form. &quot;not as much as you have&quot; For a while they talked and ate. getting up Chris waved Tanya to follow him. &quot;this is what granted me my awesome body,&quot; he said as he pressed the button on the case.  <br />
<br />
Tanya saw the vials again.  &quot;okay. but why are you showing me this?&quot; she asked as she noticed Kane approaching them. &quot;say it&#39;s an apology or feeling like you are being left out. if you want just pick a vial and become whatever you want to be. you can even do a minor vial if you want to&quot; Chris explained that the case was enchanted so that you could find something that interests you. Tanya was left there as the two dragons went to the living room so she could make her choice unhindered.</p>
