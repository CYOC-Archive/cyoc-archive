<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You two aren&#39;t in this round?&quot; Tiffany asked as she and Princess followed Jamie, Trevor, and Reilly along the pathway in the Claw Coliseum as they got into the various initial rounds for the UFC-A&#39;s first tournament, &quot;Did you... get a bye or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
The UFC-A and the A-BC had to alternate as they went through their preliminary rounds, and with the A-BC through their preliminaries, it was now alternated out for the UFC-A. And for Trevor and Reilly, who both shared some interest in the various combat sports, likely in relation to their competition over Jamie going through the IAC the previous summer, it was something that they were fairly intent on following and had even signed on with and for once they graduated from WSA.  It also meant that they were interested in following the matches as they were set up.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s more that we&#39;re too &quot;young,&quot; actually,&quot; Trevor answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;But you&#39;re both double dosed,&quot; Princess commented, &quot;don&#39;t they count that as being a legal adult?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In terms of physical development, sure,&quot; Trevor answered, &quot;but because we&#39;re still in school and won&#39;t graduate from high school until after the COMING school year, the UFC-A faces something a legal pickle. The Styracosaurus Animalian that&#39;s working as a promotor and manager for the tournament will let us train... but until we have at least a high school diploma, they&#39;re not going to put us into official matches for fear of lawsuits involving the use of &quot;minors&quot; in combat sports.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There wasn&#39;t any problem with that in the IAC,&quot; Jamie commented as they all sat down and looked into the ring where the uniformed referee was going over the rules with the competitors in the ring.<br />
<br />
&quot;The IAC was AMATURE  sports,&quot; Reilly admitted, &quot;we weren&#39;t paid for participation in it. In that, it&#39;s sort of like the Olympics and College sports. The UFC-A, however, would be considered professional and that all participants would be paid... though obviously the winner stands to earn the most as a prize. In this... I think they&#39;re playing at making sure no one can claim they&#39;re making minors fight for money.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamie glanced to Trevor and Reilly, and both nodded in agreement. She then sighed and figured it was possible, after all there were laws against child labor and what jobs they could be allowed to perform. And with the present administration presently shuffling between various points, many of which often seemed rather confrontational with Animalia at times, it probably made sense while Trevor and Reilly were enrolled in a high school. But they would be Seniors in the coming fall, and after that, there would be no further loopholes to use against them.<br />
<br />
&quot;But it will still be fun to just watch the matches,&quot; Trevor added.<br />
<br />
Tiffany and Princess traded glances and then shrugged. While Princess was the one most interested in sports between the two poodle sisters, neither of them were necessarily that into combat sports. The only real reason they were there was because Jaime, Trevor, and Reilly would be there to watch the event, and they thought that Trevor and Reilly would actually be in the preliminary matches. Tiffany eventually managed a shrug.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps that&#39;s for the best,&quot; Tiffany commented, &quot;as you still have the biggest preliminary bout of all...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; Reilly wondered, noting that Tiffany&#39;s gaze had shifted to him and way from the ring.<br />
<br />
&quot;Convincing my dad you&#39;re good enough for me,&quot; Tiffany answered, &quot;as he gets a bit traditional about those sorts of things. It&#39;s why whenever I got into anything that would require approval, it was away from home and his ability to say yes or no... but... I&#39;d actually think that WE are starting to get to a point where it&#39;s serious enough where we&#39;d have to go through all that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Reilly actually gulped at that. He&#39;d never actually met Tiffany&#39;s father, but as part of all the lessons and help Jamie had given Tiffany during Tiffany&#39;s Senior year at Lyre High, he learned enough to know that the man was fairly successful in the area. Supposedly he&#39;d owned several Silver Mines in the west and played the Stock Market, and played it very well, which made him fairly wealthy and enabled him to dabble in various business ventures in Lyre and Animalia. In this, he new that Tiffany&#39;s father was well off and could probably do a lot to impede his courtship with Tiffany, who after psychologically maturing after being more secure in being a Dog Animalian, he&#39;d found a fair amount to like. In this the worry about making a good impression made him wish that he was in the ring. At least there he could focus on competing against an opponent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; Jamie assured him and placed a hand on his shoulder, &quot;It&#39;s just one of those things... You&#39;d be essentially asking permission to date her. You dress up, come to dinner, you&#39;re on your best behavior... that sort of thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Reilly still only gulped.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
In another area of the stands, Walter and Dory sat watching the first fights with some interest. Like Reilly and Trevor, the pair had signed on with the UFC&#39;s plans for combat leagues that would allow Animalians some measure of competition against each other but couldn&#39;t yet have actual matches. Though, this was mostly due to the fact that Walter was an Ankylosaurus Dinotopian and Dory was a Doedicurus, an armored mammal from the Pleistocene epoch. Since both of them were from animals that were considered prehistoric, their registration was with regard to the Mesozoic Fight Club, which for the moment didn&#39;t have enough competitors to actually hold a tournament with trained athletes. So for the moment, they were free to enjoy the match cheer on many of the competitors.<br />
<br />
&quot;You really want to get into it,&quot; Dory commented Walter with a chuckle as she watched him practically sitting on the front end of the bench that was provided for them toward the back of the stands where they were free to let their tails sit behind them, which was a good thing as the long and stiff clubbed tails that both of them had weren&#39;t easy to fold conceal into tight spaces.<br />
<br />
&quot;In a way yeah...&quot; Walter gave a small smile and a passing glance to her, &quot;I wasn&#39;t always the type to get into a lot of this sort of thing... but then, I also had to deal with brittle bones and couldn&#39;t do anything like this. Now... I can, and can&#39;t wait.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And made up for it,&quot; Dory laughed, &quot;like the actual dinosaur... even your eyelids are armored.&quot;<br />
<br />
Walter nodded at that. Joining Project Mesozoic and his specific choice in Ankylosaurus was his way making up for his years of having overly brittle bones. Dory&#39;s specific reasons for becoming a Doedicurus were different from his, but she made for good company and the pair had become rather good friends as they bonded over the things that made the two animals interesting. And if the Mesozoic Fight Club wasn&#39;t at least a year away due to the fact that Project Mesozoic had only JUST gone public, he would be ready for his first matches, but he did have to wait. Though, hiding his excitement over it was a different thing.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... how do you think the Mesozoic Fight Club&#39;s opening round will go?&quot; Dory asked after a moment as the crowd rose to a rather great cheer in response to a strong blow that was delivered in the ring.<br />
<br />
&quot;So far... it may go well,&quot; Walter answered, &quot;though... what they have is more a promotional fight, playing up Spinosaurus versus Indominus... I think that case was really written by too many sci-fans. Especially when Heather, Jeremy, and Tyra all state that they are Syntixisaurus Rexes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Jurassic Park is still a big thing right now,&quot; Dory commented with a chuckle, &quot;I was more thinking on Heather and Regina&#39;s training.&quot;<br />
<br />
Walter nodded and shrugged as his eyes were focused on the arena. Without turning, he did slowly answer, &quot;they&#39;re advancing... though, I&#39;d think that a lot of what they have ahead of them is going to be more with regard to the basics and figuring out what the exact safety equipment there will be.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dory nodded at that as she watched the present round being fought out...<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
On the floor level of the main area, Joshua was quick to move about and keep in touch with those that were on duty as nurses and medics for the tournament. Most were assigned to the event from Horizon Light and there were a few that looked hesitant and nervous being there. The most obvious of these two were a pair of Horse Animalian Mares. They stayed at their posts and were alert, but Joshua had noticed that they also at times tried to look away or look down. It was like they didn&#39;t want to be there that evening.<br />
<br />
&quot;You two okay?&quot; Joshua asked as approached them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; the first, Delilah answered slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess that neither of us really like this sort of thing,&quot; Calamity added, &quot;especially considering he situation our husbands were rescued from.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joshua slowly nodded, as he&#39;d gotten some of the backstories on the staff that was provided for this round for the UFC-A. Delilah had married a Quarter Horse Animalian named Red Cloud while Calamity had married a mixed Quarter Hourse/Appaloosa Animalian named Thunder. Both had been rescued from a horse fighting ring early in Animalia&#39;s history, around the time these two mares had actually left Lyre High and earned apprenticeships and nursing degrees online. From the records Joshua had found, the two were competent and quick to respond, which in a way made for a good medic.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... I can understand not feeling interested in combat sports,&quot; Joshua spoke, &quot;but you must remember that your husbands were FORCED to fight before they were rescued. Everyone in these bouts has quite willingly joined... including me.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two of them looked to him for a moment, and while the Komodo Dragon Animalian was moving slowly, for the moment it didn&#39;t look like he was injured and both Delilah and Calamity knew that Joshua had made sure there were a lot of things in place to be ready for medical emergencies. That combined with the fact that he was reported to have been a medic in World War II had actually puzzled them as to why he volunteered for the contest. And while Joshua had won his first bout, that didn&#39;t exactly justify it to either Delilah or Calamity.<br />
<br />
&quot;But why would someone want to do this?&quot; Calamity wondered, &quot;a lot of the procedures you put in place are designed to be ready for the case of major injuries... so it&#39;s not like you&#39;re expecting this to be a race... or something non-violent.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is violent,&quot; Joshua nodded, &quot;but the measures I have are to make sure that it stays non-lethal and gives those that wish some measure of competition that goes beyond races and so on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bu why would they choose to do this?&quot; Delilah asked, &quot;and risk injury... all for money alone...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Some of it is the challenge and the comparison between individuals,&quot; Joshua answered, &quot;it&#39;s that sort of thing that fuels a lot of competition... regardless of what it is. That&#39;s partly why I volunteered to join  the league... and not just as a medic. Particularly in the sense that back during the War... I was usually on the sidelines. Good friends went forward and fought and died for the world&#39;s freedom, and I had to stay back. In case someone got shot. For me personally... I suppose it&#39;s to show that I&#39;m not just some background guy who&#39;s only good for stitching people back together.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But the talk you gave on how you wanted us to be ready was detailed,&quot; Calamity said slowly.<br />
<br />
Joshua gave a small smile, &quot;I never said I was giving up on medicine and being there for first aid. And I&#39;m not saying now that you have to like the sport. But you will need to pay attention. As if a major injury happens, your duty as medics for the event will be to be able to react quickly and make sure that injured are in as good of condition as possible before going to the hospital. You may not like the sport... but they will still be counting on you to be paying attention and being on your toes...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We only have one on each foot,&quot; Delilah snorted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Still,&quot; Joshua answered, &quot;you need to be ready. Don&#39;t simply avoid paying attention because you don&#39;t like combat sports. For if something goes wrong... they will need the speed and diligence that you&#39;ve shown at Horizon Light with your normal nursing shifts. Can you do that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose...&quot; Calamity said after a moment, &quot;though... hopefully we aren&#39;t always assigned to this...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve actually worked it out so that all the nurses at Horizon Light will periodically get some work in as medics for the UFC-A,&quot; Joshua chuckled, &quot;but still stay alert.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two mares nodded and Joshua returned to his rounds to check on some of the others that were on duty, though so far, things had actually gone rather well with no broken bones or anything like that. That showed that the gloves and other measures that were added to provide safety and prevent Animalians with strong natural weapons employing them, even if by accident. In that, so far, the first round was a success from a medical standpoint.</p>
