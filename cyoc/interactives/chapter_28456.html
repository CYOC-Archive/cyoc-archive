<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Why can't we use  Julio's power?&quot; Janice asked out load. She had just ask <br />
about using Julio's power to restore themselves and her sisters to humanity <br />
and manhood. Julio was in meditation, something he explained he had to <br />
occasionally do to bring himself into total focus and bring his abilities back to <br />
their max without overloading himself. <br />
<br />
Tabra spoke mentally. 'Don't speak Janice, -think- you can do it Janice, just <br />
think how you normally would, I'm right in here with you, nothing else to it. It's <br />
best we not speak too loud while Julio's realigning himself.'<br />
<br />
'O-Okay... w-why can't we use Julio's power? If it's supposed to be a mini-<br />
version of God that means he can do anything right?'  <br />
<br />
'Julio also has a human brain, meaning he's limited by his perceptions, he's <br />
talented, but ... mixing magic never goes well, it always backfires somehow, it <br />
like trying to use two program meant for different OS, there are going to be <br />
some -very- big bugs, you have to work with what's there, or work with that <br />
isn't the already existing program's territory.' <br />
<br />
&quot;Janice?&quot; Vicki's voice broke them out of their internal discussion. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes?&quot; Janice said speaking through the shared mouth. <br />
<br />
&quot;We need to talk.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot; Tabra said though Vicki no way to know it wasn't Janice this time, &quot;But <br />
not in here, let's go outside.&quot; She lowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;To the surface?&quot; Vicki asked as they walked out of the 'room' in the mutli-<br />
chambered cavern. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry no, just out of the room, our guest need his quite time so to speak.&quot; <br />
Tabra continued. Finally he let Janice get a word in edgewise. <br />
<br />
&quot;What do you need to talk about?&quot; Janice asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Our sisters and I have been discussing, some of us want out.&quot; <br />
<br />
'I saw this coming.' Tabra said mentally. <br />
<br />
&quot;How many?&quot; Janice asked, feeling like a child in the middle of a divorce.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Charlene decidedly, Luna of course wants to stay and fight, Anna... I'm not <br />
quite sure -what- she wants.&quot; She saw the look in Janice's face. &quot;I'm sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about you?&quot; Janice asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I haven't decided yet.&quot; Viki hung her head down. <br />
<br />
Janice grasped at straws. &quot;You, you ask tell them to stay, you're our big sister <br />
after all.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;It's -their- choice, I won't make it for them.&quot; Viki said sternly at her little sister.<br />
<br />
'You're an angel,' Janice began, 'You can-'<br />
<br />
'I won't! You're free to scream at me until Judgment Day, but there is no way <br />
I'm forcing them to stay with you. Janice...I can feel your emotions, and the <br />
memory you're replaying in your head again and again. You're NOT losing <br />
them like you lost Tammy. They aren't being stolen from you.'<br />
<br />
'I didn't want these feelings, I don't want these feelings, but I feel them all the <br />
same, and they scream at me that they are my sisters.'<br />
<br />
'And they still will be. That won't change, I promise, but you were kept together <br />
through slavery, they each have to find their own path before they find their <br />
way back to each other.'<br />
<br />
Viki saw Janice's face turn desperate, then stern, then soft, then resolved. Viki <br />
wondered what was going on in there. <br />
<br />
 &quot;Come on.&quot; Janice said in a calm and steady tone that Viki guessed was the <br />
angel's. &quot;We had better settle this before we get any further. Our guest is <br />
another drop of chaos in what is about to become a maelstrom, the more <br />
things we have resolved before we make our go on Kather and...Tammy the <br />
better.&quot; <br />
<br />
Viki acknowledge the logic in that. <br />
A few minutes later, all nine vixens were in a circle, Julio had come out of his <br />
meditation and watched, but realized this was a, well, -family- matter, all he <br />
could do was observe. <br />
<br />
&quot;All right.&quot; Tabra said, some of the vixen sitting, some standing, others <br />
leaning, but all had their eyes on the fox angel. &quot;I right now have three options <br />
I can give you, and I'm very sorry, but staying in this cave indefinitely isn't one <br />
of them.&quot; All the vixen nodded at this. <br />
<br />
Tabra counted off her fingers. &quot;Option one, you can just go home to your <br />
families, there's still a chance when all of this is laid to rest you can be <br />
returned to your original forms, it might be days, or years, but it is very <br />
possible. I can even make sure your families will know you for who you are.&quot; <br />
She counted off the next finger. &quot;Option two, since you've all been changed <br />
into kitesune, or at least partially, there are parts of japan that rely on faith <br />
more than technology. I can give you a crash course in the culture and <br />
language the fast non-verbal way. You'll be treated as minor deities of their <br />
hometowns. -But- there won't be -any- turning back from this choice once you <br />
taken the first two steps down the road, you don't become something sacred <br />
then walk away from the job. And be very, -very- warned, while you will NOT <br />
forget who you are, or were, though at times you might want to dismiss it as a <br />
bad dream, nor will those dear to you stop being dear, but you will be trading <br />
in your current instincts for new ones, and while you'll be able to assume the <br />
form you have right now, hey, even a human again with practice, it will never <br />
be your default form again.&quot; <br />
Tabra stayed quite for a minute so everything she had said could sink before <br />
moving on to the third finger. &quot;Finally. Option three, for those of you brave <br />
enough or foolish enough to stay here with me, and fight Karther's intentions. <br />
Normally I wouldn't even consider this a valid option, but I have to <br />
begrudgingly admit you ladies now Karther and his ilk better than anyone <br />
else. And I also have to acknowledge your willing to fight as a choice you <br />
have the right to make. And here comes the 'but' though. The but is: you can't <br />
fight him as you are, if you wish to fight Karther's monsters on their level, and <br />
save your sisters, you're going to have to become more than you are.&quot; Tabra <br />
spread her material wings. &quot;You're going to basically become like Janice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We're going to have to join you in there?&quot; Erica blinked point at Tabra's body. <br />
<br />
Tabra and Janice for once in sync slapped herself in the face. &quot;No, no, no. <br />
You're going to have become part of the angel army while you're still alive, <br />
something that only happened once before in history.&quot; Only Janice felt the <br />
echo in Tabra's memories that said that Tabra meant in the history of the <br />
universe. <br />
<br />
Luna said not looking at all as phased as the others, &quot;So we get big fluffy <br />
wings and get to blast things to atoms?&quot; <br />
<br />
Tabra spoke evenly, &quot;This isn't just a simple transformation of your body, it <br />
also transforms your spirit and soul as well! This change will reach all the way <br />
down to the center of your self! Don't think you're just getting some pieces of <br />
bones and feathers connected to your shoulders and a semi-automatic laser <br />
blaster install in your forearm! It'll still be you, but I can't promise it'll be the <br />
same version of you. And there's something -much- bigger, if any of you love <br />
and serve any deities other than Jehovah, and you decide on option three, <br />
then you had better say your good-byes and wish them farewell.  And any of <br />
you who has chosen to not love and serve any god, and you chose this <br />
option, I'm afraid this won't be the case afterwards.&quot; <br />
<br />
This had the desired effect of scaring most of the girls off who might have <br />
taken the third rout, however, there will always be those bold enough. <br />
<br />
&quot;You can sign at least me up.&quot; Luna said, she hadn't wavered, in the face of <br />
everything, she hadn't wavered.<br />
 <br />
Tabra thought/sighed. 'So much for no one taking option three. There is one <br />
plus side.'<br />
<br />
Janice was courious. 'What plus side?'<br />
<br />
'Doing this should help you learn to use our abilities -much- quicker.' <br />
<br />
'Won't this decease what we've built up?' Janice saw the echo of what Tabra <br />
was thinking. It had the same feeling as a organ transplant, only the donor <br />
didn't have to die. <br />
<br />
'It will and it won't.'<br />
<br />
'No riddles!'<br />
<br />
'Riddles are only riddles if you don't know the answer. While transferring my, -<br />
our- essence partially into another might be a drain on us at first, we'll get it <br />
back much faster this way.'<br />
<br />
'How's that work?'<br />
<br />
'Long story short? To quote 'God is love' and love grows much faster when <br />
shared. And as an angel, my original function before I was drafted into a <br />
solider was to spread the stuff. '<br />
<br />
'I'd say something, but at this point, I've kinda given up. I'll say something later <br />
if it -doesn't- work. Otherwise I think I'm just gonna go with the flow.'<br />
<br />
'Not a very smart way to go through life, but I understand. So sit back and, no <br />
scratch that, stand up and be a part of this Janice, because this is something <br />
no living human normally gets to see before they die.' <br />
<br />
For once, Janice chose just to take what Tabra said at face value. <br />
<br />
&quot;The person who wants to stay and fight the most step foreword.&quot; Tabra/<br />
Janice said. <br />
<br />
&quot;That's me.&quot; Luna said stepping foreword without a second thought. <br />
<br />
Tabra/Janice said. &quot;Anyone who doesn't want to do the easy and likely smart <br />
thing and back out now, please watch this, because if you're going to chicken <br />
out, this is the best time for all of us for you to.&quot; <br />
<br />
The angel fox looked the former slave in the eyes. &quot;Okay Luna. Brace <br />
yourself, because this, is going to hurt like the gates of Heaven.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Don't you mean hell?&quot; Luna raised an eye brow. <br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot; Tabra/Janice said simply. &quot;Hell is the line at the bank at closing time. <br />
Hell is the street corner after school when your parents forget to pick you up. <br />
Hell is the quarter inch of glass between a kid and the toy at the store he can't <br />
afford to buy but wants with all his heart. Hell is the closet a child is locked <br />
inside by his parents. Hell is the -need- an addict hears whispering at the <br />
back of their head . . . &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You aren't scaring me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I'm happy that this is likely to also give you some common sense. <br />
Because fear is healthy. And this, is -really- going to hurt.&quot; <br />
<br />
'Total disregard of protocol! I can't believe you did this. Oh wait, yes I can!' <br />
<br />
'What was that?' Janice asked, doing her best not to say it out loud. <br />
<br />
'That was me imagining what Mike might say he finds out I held a recruitment <br />
drive without telling him.' <br />
<br />
'You gonna get in trouble that badly?'<br />
<br />
'Only if we all get killed.' <br />
<br />
'I'll remember to stay alive then.' <br />
<br />
'Good idea. Follow my lead, let yourself go for a moment, just one moment. <br />
Don't force it through, -let- it through.'  <br />
<br />
Tabra/Janice put their hands just above Luna's breasts, holding onto her <br />
shoulders. Tabra/Janice breathed in deep, and carefully opened the <br />
floodgates between themselves and Luna. <br />
<br />
Then came the flood of white light to those with the spiritual sight to see it that <br />
crashed through Tabra into Luna. Luna howled in pain, echoing from the <br />
walls, feeling the force filling every inch of her being, altering it in ways that <br />
were not just cosmetic. She felt her flesh and bone sculptured into a slightly <br />
different shape, but this was nothing compared to what was happen to -her-, <br />
for at this moment she felt almost a disconnection to her body, for she felt a <br />
second pair of wings that were made of flesh or bone, but felt infinitely more <br />
real than the mundane ones. The tidal wave seemed to wash the muck from <br />
inside her, cleansing her body, and man did it hurt! But at the same time, she <br />
felt something beyond it, yet was a part of it, something... wonderful.<br />
The pain was in all honesty blinding. But nothing lasts forever in this world <br />
and eventually the pain left her. And in the pain's place, was the wonderful <br />
something. <br />
<br />
From the vixens' perception, Janice glowed white, and in a moment, so was <br />
Luna, the girls involuntarily took a step back as they hide their eyes. Luna's <br />
howls of pain stinging their ears which flattened against their skulls. Which the <br />
screaming suddenly stopped, they wondered if maybe Luna had died, when <br />
they looked at her, they instead wondered if she had been dead before and <br />
had just now been brought back to life! <br />
<br />
Janice steeled herself and calmly followed Tabra's instructions down to the <br />
letter. Touching Luna's body with as much professionalism as she could <br />
muster. Then again at Tabra led her through it step by step, she undid a tiny <br />
lock that was on Luna, and slowly opened it, then undid a similar tiny lock on <br />
herself, then it was as if a piece of herself, and Tabra leapt out of her and into <br />
Luna, slamming into her sister, with a force akin to a natural disaster. She <br />
heard Luna scream, but Tabra held Janice fast so she wouldn't let go <br />
prematurely, or Janice sensed the side effects would be awful. <br />
But even as Luna screamed, she felt her change, felt her ... grow... it wasn't <br />
like her body got larger but... it was like the complexity of Luna's spirit <br />
increased, and Luna's eyes gained more vision. And Janice realized with a <br />
ton of brick that what Luna was screaming about.... were growing pains. All on <br />
their own, the lock on Janice closed, then Luna's too closed by itself and it <br />
was done. <br />
<br />
Janice realized she was hurting too but... it felt like a -good- kind of hurt.<br />
<br />
Janice look at the change to Luna, but any material changes paled to the <br />
transformation her spirit had undergone, those were the truly fantastic ones. <br />
And Janice, looking at the reborn Luna, finally acknowledge the existence of <br />
angels, not just some super powered mutant human with delusion of divinity, <br />
not an alien pretending to be one, not some extra reality ET who humans <br />
mistook for one, but, a Messenger. <br />
<br />
Tabra said calmly. &quot;Congratulations, you've just been conscripted.&quot; <br />
<br />
Luna's eyes came back into focus, she saw her fur's 'gloves' had turned <br />
snowy white, a odd contrast to her redding brown fur. Wait... no way... just no <br />
way. <br />
Luna stood up, and looking at herself saw her entire body was as white as <br />
freshly fallen snow, pardon the old comparison. Slowly twirling around, she <br />
got a look at her tail and... wings! Connected to her like she had been born to <br />
have them. <br />
Though she couldn't see her own eyes, they were now as blue as the sky <br />
above ground. Her hair had also turned the same white but... it didn't feel like <br />
it was hair that had lost it's color, more like white -was- it's color, if that made <br />
sense. <br />
<br />
Luna unconsciously touched her chest and felt a gem the color of the sky that <br />
was as much a part of her body as her wings. ... Luna felt, beautiful. It was as <br />
simple as that. But at the same time there was more to it, she felt, an intensity <br />
just below the surface, like a sleeping storm and it made her feel alive. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are we all going to end up with a uniform appearance?&quot; Vicki asked still <br />
wearing the cross 'T' had given her.  She wasn't liking the idea of being a <br />
cookie cutter soldier even for a just cause. <br />
<br />
&quot;No. This is how the angelic essence interacted with her spirit, it rarely the <br />
same with anyone twice.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I see.&quot; Vicki said. <br />
<br />
'Nice job.' Janice thought. <br />
<br />
'Glade you think so, but it was as much you as me.' Tabra thought back. <br />
'Cause it's your half of the job to get these newbie soldiers armed and <br />
armored. I have the much harder task hamming into them some basic combat <br />
sense and how to use the power that's now a part of them.' <br />
<br />
'Wha?' Janice thought in a squeak. <br />
<br />
'Come -on- you didn't think we were going to lead a tiny group of vixen into <br />
battle naked against an magical insane wolf vixen queen.' <br />
<br />
'Er, I see your point.' <br />
<br />
&quot;What happened to my sand armor?&quot; Luna asked in a voice that carried a <br />
tone that could bring stars down from heaven to dance among men. Truly <br />
Janice realized, the angelic essence that Tabra had fused into her made <br />
made Luna more than she had been. <br />
Luna was in the fur, and she didn't mind. <br />
<br />
&quot;That was a part of Karther's magic... it couldn't hang onto you anymore, this is <br />
the shape your body became because it's based on what you're now -used- to <br />
seeing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luna looked at her hands, then nodded, &quot;You're right, I do.&quot;<br />
<br />
It would be a ugly lie to say that the vixens weren't all scared by Luna's <br />
transfiguration, which was exactly Tabra's point. If they didn't have the <br />
courage or resolve, in them, heck, or just wanted to go home and be done <br />
with all this fur and breasts or no, Tabra wasn't going to force this on them, <br />
and he was going to make -very- sure they knew what they were volunteering <br />
for! <br />
<br />
Tabra/Janice said to Luna, &quot;The transfiguration should make you immune to <br />
infection by the wolf creatures, however, remember-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Remember what?&quot;<br />
<br />
In a lightning quick motion the fox angel left a small cut on Luna's forearm. <br />
&quot;Your body is still alive, which means you can die, just like the living body I <br />
have can die. So in other words don't think that just cause Tammy can't <br />
remake you back into a slave doesn't mean you can't get killed.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;..I will.&quot; <br />
<br />
Viki held the crucifix T' had given her tightly. <br />
<br />
Erica looked at Luna, then at Tabra, then looked at Luna again. <br />
<br />
&quot;Red angelic fox, white angelic fox. What is this: Power Rangers?&quot; She said <br />
sounding rather annoyed. <br />
<br />
Tabra didn't enjoy the comparison and saw fit to correct her. &quot;You aren't <br />
teenagers, you aren't going around in a giant robot, you aren't facing a <br />
characterless monster of the week, you aren't expected to say 'Right!' or <br />
'Morphin' to everything, and no, Jehovah does NOT normally take the <br />
appearance of a giant floating head. Well, usually.&quot;<br />
<br />
Erica was courious. &quot;What does he normally appear as then?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tabra scratched her nose. &quot;Well since he's the God of Everything, he has a lot <br />
of options, there was that time he appeared as a little girl, then as a janitor, an <br />
bearded old man in a white hat snipping lemonade on the beach,  and of <br />
course that time as a giant white lion.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Erica was quieted down. &quot;Oh.&quot;</p>
