<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">For more than ten thousand years ago, a group of shamans and witches sealed an ancient spirit of chaos in the <br />
underground of a valley. The spirit was called CYOC, and their power was to create chaos transforming beings <br />
according to the imagination of humans. He could not create anything, so he fed on ignorance and prejudice to <br />
accomplish its evil deeds.<br />
<br />
CYOC waited patiently until changed by humanity itself and forget that he existed and finally freed from his <br />
prison. The years became decades, the decades turned into centuries, the centuries turned into millenniums, <br />
until one day a group of enterprising businessmen decided to build a new mall in the small town of <br />
Springvalley, which was once the site of the final battle against CYOC.<br />
<br />
While the mall's foundations were dug, the workers ended up breaking an unsuspecting of charms that held the <br />
spirit, as they rushed to finish early in a Saturday.<br />
The awakening of CYOC was quick and discreet. Around the time that had passed in prison, the world had changed <br />
a lot and there was also little changed. There were people from many different type, men of reason and men of <br />
faith, but still had a lot of prejudice about each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;This world can still change much.&quot; Said the old spirit. He felt that his brothers or had moved away, died or <br />
been imprisoned. Mankind had lost their fear of the old spirits, and was master of the world. &quot;I have much <br />
work to do.&quot; Said the spirit, while exploring the town.<br />
<br />

Fred and Zach were playing video games at home, both were students at the local college nineteen years old. <br />
Fred was studying pedagogy and was a descendant of Irish with red hair, while Zach was studying law and had <br />
blond hair. Both were fans of gangster games and hip hop culture and dressed accordingly, but were just <br />
ordinary kids.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is better to take a break, I have a paper to deliver tomorrow and need to study.&quot; Zach said pausing the <br />
game, and both Fred heard the phone ringing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god, I forgot I had set to meet with Pamela at the gym.&quot; Fred said answering the phone worried.<br />
&quot;This girl has trained to obey you pretty fast huh?&quot; Zach said laughing, then immediately decided to go in the <br />
bathroom while her friend answered the phone.<br />
<br />
Moments later, when Fred was still turned the phone over his expression had changed. Fred was a pretty relaxed <br />
and carefree, but now his face was tense and angry, he was talking on the phone with someone and swearing a <br />
lot. Will was having a fight with Pam? Anyway there was something different about him, his designer clothes <br />
looked old and ratty, made &amp;#8203;&amp;#8203;of inferior material. He looked more muscular than a few moments there and he did <br />
not remember that Fred had done tattoos on his arms.<br />
<br />
Suddenly he finished the call and turned to Zach. &quot;We have work to do. Come on.&quot; He said while wearing a <br />
hoody. For a moment Zach thought Fred had spoken with a ghetto accent very authentic.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where do we go? You were not going to the gym?&quot;<br />
<br />
Fred looked strange to Zach and kept walking. Figuring it was some problem with Pam, Zach followed to help. <br />
When they arrived at the car of Fred, was a different car, an older model, with paint worn but with chrome <br />
hubcaps and a super expensive sound system.<br />
<br />
&quot;What a nice car! Seems real gangster car.&quot; Zach said they immediately got another look at Fred.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're on drugs mate? You are talking like a suburban kid.&quot; He said with a deep voice and again making a <br />
ghetto accent.<br />
<br />
Both got into the car, Zach was concerned. If you did not know better I would say that Fred was more like a <br />
true criminal and not a well educated college student. Suddenly he felt a chill and like an invisible hand had <br />
tapping him. His clothes have suffered the same change of clothes from Fred, and he felt a gun appearing in <br />
his pocket, his hair was braided in cornhows, the violence of the streets got inside his mind, turning Zach on <br />
what and the rappers sing about, a true thug.<br />
<br />

<br />
A young web designer parked his Lexxus in front of the Home Depot. Jeff was a descendant of immigrants from <br />
Mexico and was always sad to see the dozens of illegal piled up in front of the store to work as day laborer. <br />
Unfortunately few of them have the same chance that his grandfather had, but those were different times, and <br />
Jeff was an American citizen in the way of realizing the dream. He had his own company and was renovating his <br />
new home.<br />
<br />
While walking from his car to the store door, a fat guy in a truck pulled up next to him and shouted &quot; YARD <br />
WORK ? Huh, ...Trabajar ...en el jard&iacute;n! 10 bucks hour. &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; Sorry pal, i am an American citizen. &quot; Said Jeff with his perfect american accent. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry then.&quot; Said the fat before being surrounded by a crowd sweaty after work.<br />
<br />
Jeff went on his way a rather annoyed, when he went to Home Depot he was confused with a day laborer just <br />
because he was Hispanic, no matter the clothes he was wearing. Jaff deep breath and continued toward the door <br />
and felt a hand on his shoulder, turned around but there was nobody. Was he imagining things?<br />
<br />
Jeff continued his way and began to walk the store looking for things that come to buy. He had a list that the <br />
contractor had given him the necessary material, but it was hard to read. The words seemed strange, as if in <br />
another language. Jeff then approached a store clerk, a man of southern appearance. When looked at Jeff he <br />
seemed impatient and angry, he murmorou something that Jeff did not understand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, you can look at this list and see if you recognize any material? I think I hired is a foreigner who <br />
does not speak our language.&quot; Jeff said, surprised that his speech was a Latin accent. The clerk took the list <br />
and looked for a while and finally said.<br />
<br />
&quot;The friend list is right, your boss should have sent someone who could read English better. Do not worry I'll <br />
put it all together for you.&quot; Said the attendant relieved not to have to continue in the presence of Jeff.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gracias.&quot; Said Jeff unconsciously. He had only understood that the clerk would provide the materials for him.<br />
<br />
While waiting, he looked at his feet and saw she was wearing a kind of worn leather sandals. He was sure he <br />
had footwear shoes when he left home, his pants looked different too, thick and dirty jeans. Searched in a <br />
bathroom mirror's lane and saw what was actually dressed as a day laborer. What could be happening? He looked <br />
around and could not read anything on any board, all were in a strange language. Panicked and ran out the <br />
store, tried to return to your car, but did not find the keys in your pocket, just a bus card.<br />
<br />
Jeff was in despair, looked around and saw a number of day laborers standing talking. Jeff had never learned <br />
to speak Spanish, but I could understand perfectly what they were talking. They wore the same kind of clothes <br />
he was wearing old clothes to good hard work.<br />
<br />
He was becoming one of them? What a ridiculous stereotype, these illegal workers were only a small proportion <br />
of Latinos living in america. Sociologically it was ... it was ... What means this &quot;sociologically&quot; word again <br />
? Jeff was regressing in education, his post-graduate degree in webdesign was turning into the education of a <br />
high school drop-out and even that was decreasing.<br />
<br />
Jeff felt a mustache forming on his face, some teeth fell from his mouth and others became decayed. His hands <br />
were calloused from hard work, had his arms the muscles of a member of the working class and a beer belly. <br />
Jeff felt dizzy and when he realized he had entered into a van. It seemed that would be taken to a farm <br />
outside the city, Jeff was happy that work and he would have lasted more money for the rent of the month.<br />
<br />

<br />
CYOC was just beginning, this new world would be his to torment. Where CYOC should seek new victims? It was <br />
then that he felt his name being called, would exist followers of his in this age ? CYOC laughted hard, it was <br />
time for some changes.</p>
