<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mary now stared at her youthful appearance in the mirror. The 18 year old red head was fascinated with the power of the ring, the idea that she could be any age fascinated her. As she now stared at the ring she wondered how exactly it worked. &quot;I just wish I knew how to control this thing,&quot; she thought. Instantly Mary Elise&#39;s mind was filled with the knowledge of the ring, causing the teen to swoon slightly.<br />
<br />
Mary Elise now understood that the ring was controlled by either saying or thinking a wish to change anyone&#39;s age. Currently she and her friends were getting younger because of the her birthday wish to be young again. Unfortunately she had been very unspecific with the wish meaning the girls would continue growing younger until they blinked out of existence. Mary Elise looked at her young reflexion in the window, she had made her wish at midnight and was now only 18. If she did not alter her wish the group would continue to grow younger by one year every hour until they ceased to exist. Looking at the time Mary saw it was now 8:20 a.m., in forty minutes the group would become 17, with her knowledge of how to control the ring Mary began to consider whether or not to halt the groups regression.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mary how do you think this happened?&quot; Claudia asked. Mary looked up at the two teens as if in a daze. Claudia was still in her nightie, which appeared ill fitting on the blonde teen. Claudia was continually adjusting the strap that was sliding off her shoulder. Mary looked down at the ring, for right now Mary thought it best not too mention her age changing abilities. &quot;I&#39;m not quite sure,&quot; she said. &quot;I just hope we can figure it out.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Hope so too,&quot; Mika said as she tried to adjust her ill fitting night shirt. &quot;Really don&#39;t want to be stuck as a teenager when I go back to work. The fashion industry is tough enough without me being stuck as a kid.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Mary was about to answer the girls heard a frantic knock at the door. Mary quickly opened it and stared at a now teenage Samantha and Tricia. The young brunette was dressed in a ill fitting sweater and was continuously adjusting her loose jeans. Tricia was in a similar state as she hiked up her jeans and adjusted her loose blouse. &quot;Mary,&quot; Samantha exclaimed. &quot;Wow, you look so young I wouldn&#39;t of believed it unless I saw it with my own eyes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary smiled and shrugged. &quot;Yea it&#39;s kind of crazy,&quot; she said. &quot;Bet Jacob will like it though.&quot; Samantha blushed slightly she gave Mary an incredulous look. &quot;Yea I&#39;d rather not be Jakes teenage wife,&quot; she said. &quot;Let&#39;s just try to fix this before we get any younger.&quot; Mary hustled her friends inside where they joined the others in the kitchen. The six friends now looked over each other with fascination as their predicament began to set in. Mary could only grin, watching the group group brought back fond memories of their childhood.<br />
<br />
&quot;So any idea how this happened?&quot; Tricia asked. Samantha shook her head. &quot;No,&quot; she said. &quot;All I know is that it&#39;s not stopping. When I wole up a couple of hours ago I was 20 or 21and every hour I feel a tingle and start to become a little younger.&quot; The group shuddered at the thought of slowly growing younger and what would happen if they didn&#39;t figure this out soon. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well if we can figure out how to stop it maybe this could be kind of fun,&quot; Mary said optimistically. The group turned slowly towards Mary with a disdainful look on their faces. &quot;Seriously,&quot; Claudia stated sarcastically. &quot;You really think being kids can be fun come on Mary I think you&#39;ve been working at the school to long if you think being a snot nosed kid is going to be a fun time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Think about it,&quot; Mary said defensively. &quot;If we could spend the day as kids and go back to being adults tomorrow it could be a lot of fun. Besides you know we&#39;ve all been so absorbed in our own things that we don&#39;t see each other as much as we used to.&quot;<br />
<br />
The group looked at each other skeptically at this idea. &quot;Okay maybe,&quot; Mika said. &quot;I mean you do have a point we have kind of drifted over the last few years but that&#39;s just growing up I guess.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can&#39;t possibly think being a kid could be fun do you,&quot; Tricia exclaimed. &quot;And besides we still don&#39;t know if this is going to stop none of us know how this happened to begin with.&quot;<br />
<br />
The group now debated the pros and cons of reliving their youth as Mary listened intently. As the conversation continued they reached a consensus that being kids for a day could be a lot of fun but only if they could control it. Since no one knew that Mary now had the ability to control their ages they agreed that they first needed to solve the problem of their slow regression. As the clock slowly approached nine and Mary realized she needed to broach the subject with her friends.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Mary said. &quot;What if I told you that I think I can control what&#39;s happening to us.&quot; The group looked at Mary suspiciously. &quot;What are you talking about,&quot; Samantha said. Mary blushed slightly as she held up the ring. &quot;I think this ring we bought is the reason were all getting younger,&quot; she said shyly. &quot;I didn&#39;t believe it at first but this ring controls ages. When I blew out my candles last night I wished that things could be like they were when we were younger...li kind of miss how much fun we used to have.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I miss it too,&quot; Samantha said sadly. &quot;But you can&#39;t go backwards that&#39;s just life.&quot; Mary now looked at her friends intently. &quot;What if we could just for a day,&quot; she asked. &quot;I think I can do this but I don&#39;t want to do this without all of you. What do you say you want to relive our childhood for a day?&quot;<br />
<br />
The group looked at each other apprehensively before sighing and turning to Mary. Slowly bit surely the group smiled and nodded. &quot;You know what,&quot; Claudia said. &quot;Why not. If you can control this it might be kind of fun to be young just  as long as we can grow up again when it&#39;s done.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yea I agree,&quot; Mika said. &quot;As long as I&#39;m not stuck as a kid permenantly it could be fun to play around at different ages.&quot; Mary turned towards Samantha and Tricia. &quot;What about you two you want to give it a try?&quot; Tricia looked at the group and sighed. &quot;I guess,&quot; she said. &quot;I just always hated how I looked when I was a kid. I was always gangly and tall when I was a kid. I was a bit of an ugly duckling until I went to high school. As long as you guys don&#39;t make fun of me I might be interested in this.&quot; Mary looked at Samantha who seemed apprehensive. &quot;We&#39;ll Sammy that leaves you,&quot; she said. &quot; I don&#39;t know,&quot; she mumbled. &quot;I mean I&#39;m married what would my husband say if he saw me as a school girl.&quot; Mary smiled. &quot;He doesn&#39;t have to,&quot; she said. &quot;And if he does maybe you can find out if he&#39;s good with kids since you want to have children. What do say you want to go back with us?&quot; <br />
<br />
Samantha looked at the others before sighing heavily. &quot;Okay fine,&quot; she huffed. &quot;This is gng to be so weird but what the hell as long as we can turn back.&quot; Mary smiled and looked at her friends. &quot;Okay so it&#39;s settled,&quot; she said happily. &quot;Guess we&#39;re reliving our childhood. The only question now is how old to we become?&quot;<br />
<br />
The group now looked at each other as they tried to decide what age to start the day at.</p>
