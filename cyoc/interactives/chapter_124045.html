<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You haven&#39;t heard anymore from me Uncle, have you?&quot; Ben asked to Sophie as the small group walked along through the Horizon Lab&#39;s hallways to the area where the Thylacine DNA would be bonded with the Animalia Virus to allow for Ben and Tyree to then transform.<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s given Animalia Ambassadoria some periodic updates for us to use as advertisements as a sort of selling point that we may need,&quot; Sophie answered, thinking on the recent episode they had filmed, &quot;They&#39;ve been making some progress down there in the Amazon with the abandoned hotel as far as I know... but I can&#39;t say on how much... Though, Animalia Ambassadoria is cleared to do a full preview when we get to the fall break... It won&#39;t be super long, but it would be something we could present on just how much progress has been made.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see...&quot; Ben said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;We will want to do an episode with you and Tyree before we go though, especially if all this proves successful,&quot; Sophie commented, &quot;In that... you could deliver a direct message to your Uncle if you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Or we could go with them,&quot; Tyree gave a small smile as she looked her fiancée, &quot;show him the restored Tasmanian Tiger.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s worry about the stability of the DNA and the transformation for we get into that,&quot; Ben answered.<br />
<br />
Doctor Stein eventually lead them into one of the main laboratories with various pieces of equipment. A lot of this included powerful scanners and equipment that could also analyze various DNA samples. Sophie noted that there were also a few syringes there that reminded her of when one would need to have blood drawn for lab tests at the hospital. In this she figured that this would be the preliminary test to make sure that once the Thylacine DNA was mixed with the Animalia Virus that the new strain wouldn&#39;t kill or hurt either Ben or Tyree.<br />
<br />
&quot;This shouldn&#39;t take too long to get through the preliminary testing,&quot; Doctor Stein said slowly, &quot;Since the Thylacine is believed to have gone extinct in the early 20th Century, even with the degradation of DNA that is to be expected, it shouldn&#39;t be enough that the Animalia Virus shouldn&#39;t be able to work with it... or at least reconstitute a healthy complete strand once it&#39;s mixed with your DNA as it is now. However, because of certain issues with the DNA gaps that we&#39;re discovering in the fossilized DNA for Project Mesozoic, we would like to make sure both the Thylacine DNA is &quot;stable&quot; and that the virus will respond to your DNA in the normal way...&quot;<br />
<br />
Of course, the &quot;normal way&quot; when referring to the Animalia Virus was in the transformation into human/animal hybrid known for being very muscular and strong among males and with females being naturally well muscled as well, but also being quite curvy as well. And the various projects and tests that had been done over the past year was that Horizon was well aware of what happened at the cellular level in each transformation.<br />
<br />
&quot;What will we need to do?&quot; Ben asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... first, we will need a blood sample to test on,&quot; Doctor Stein commented, &quot;but in the sense of combining the Thylacine DNA with the virus, if you could place the samples on that platform. It&#39;ll serve to mix everything to the point where the Animalia Virus can bond with it. From there with the serum in tact we can move on to testing blood samples.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben and Tyree nodded and moved to set the DNA samples that they had brought, much of which being hair samples that had been taken from captive Thylacines and preserved and placed them on a plastic tray that was seated on a sort of conveyor belt that would into the main scanners that given them a chance to look the integrity of the DNA that was being provided. Sophie watched a lot of this with some interest, as she was fairly curious in regard to how some of the things that related to the scientific side of things would progress, partially as it would relate to what she&#39;d helped work on with regard to Project Mesozoic.<br />
<br />
While they did this, Doctor Stein readied his equipment, both to start the process that would record the Thylacine DNA and to draw blood from Ben and Tyree. The former wasn&#39;t too much more than pressing a command button or two on the computer, which activated the conveyor belt and moved the samples toward the scanner. The latter made Doctor Stein look like doctor in charge of a hospital&#39;s laboratory rather than a geneticist who was preparing for the next step in a series major genetics tests. He readied some alcohol swabs as well as a specialized rubber band that was designed to help keep the blood flow strong and healthy when blood was drawn. Sophie then watched with predicable results as Doctor Stein watched as he took blood samples from both Ben and Tyree.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what next?&quot; Ben asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now all we can do is see how your blood samples respond to the new strain of the Animalia Virus,&quot; Doctor Stein answered, &quot;if all things are &quot;normal&quot; it&#39;ll mean we can move to the actual conversion.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Doctor Stein then moved to set up that mixing and to make sure that the electric microscope that was also hooked up. While he did that, Sophie glanced over Ben and Tyree, who had taken hands and looked to each other. Both had small smiles as they looked to each other, which she supposed was their excitement or hope for the project&#39;s success.<br />
<br />
&quot;If it all works... perhaps you may talk with the Australian government,&quot; Sophie offered, &quot;see if they&#39;d be willing to tolerate an actual colony. Let other Australians convert into local wildlife... or provide at least the virus base to establish a stable breeding population of Thylacine Animalians.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If it works,&quot; Tyree commented, &quot;the zoo I work at isn&#39;t too big and has generally been family run... but we do hold a collection of all native Australian creatures and we do attract a decent sized number of people from across northern Australia. You may end up with various people converting but living on their own as individuals rather than in the big colonies your website says Animalia&#39;s wanted to create.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But on the whole... Australia seems to hold a rather decent opinion about Animalia,&quot; Ben added, &quot;having restrictions on mental health trying to do &quot;designer Animalians&quot; might be something that they&#39;d be concerned with, but they don&#39;t hold one negative action as indicative of the whole. You&#39;ve all shown more good than bad.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sophie gave a warm smile at that, as it helped ease some of her fears and concerns. There were a fair number of things that would need to be overcome with regard to what Heather Wilcox had done, but at least with Australia, it appeared that complete rejection outside the US hadn&#39;t happened. That was good news. While this went on Doctor Stein completed his work and had Ben and Tyree&#39;s blood samples under a microscope while exposed to the new Thylacine strain of the Animalia Virus. And after a few moments, he gave a very pleased hum at that.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot; Tyree asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... from the tissue tests here,&quot; Doctor Stein gestured to the computer screen which was hooked up to the microscope equipment, &quot;you can see that the cells in the blood sample are undergoing the standard and normal transformational change with regard to the Animalia Virus. There was some DNA degradation, as the DNA samples, despite being preserved, are nearly one hundred years old. However, it wasn&#39;t enough to make it non-viable... especially with regard to the Animalia Virus&#39;s ability to nit things together. In that, we can move you two to a room that is more comfortable and provide you with dose one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dose one...&quot; Tyree said slowly, &quot;You mean... we&#39;d give each other dose two?&quot;<br />
<br />
Doctor Stein nodded, &quot;the vaccine won&#39;t be administered until AFTER you&#39;ve given each other your second dose.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;By which point you would have brought an animal that many believe was driven to extinction by man back,&quot; Sophie smiled, &quot;and depending on what DNA is available... the first of many.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That would be good,&quot; Ben smiled to Tyree and then looked back to Doctor Stein who was now picking up two hypodermic needles, filled with the new Thylacine strain of the Animalia virus.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good to hear,&quot; Doctor Stein spoke, &quot;If you&#39;ll come with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Doctor Stein then proceeded to walk out and into the main hallway that they&#39;d been in earlier. Ben and Tyree followed closely with Sophie following along behind. They eventually came to a wing of the main Horizon facility that was set up like a hotel. Often it was used for the transformations that related to Project Phoenix, particularly when the person being converted would get a second dose as well. As they reached the doorway, Sophie stopped at the door and waved to Ben and Tyree.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have a good time,&quot; Sophie said to them, not entirely sure if that was the right thing to say, but stuck with it as she didn&#39;t to come off like sounding like the reason she wanted to join Animalia was because of how a fully mature Animalian looked and how strong their sex drive was. As a typical teenager, that might be a small part of it, but her main reasons related to the ability to fly and to show the world that being different didn&#39;t mean the end of the world. Animalia had been good, and while the outbreak may have cost some of her friends their humanity when it came to their species, it HADN&#39;T cost them many of the things that made them human and made them her friends.  And in that, that is what she wished to share with Sarah, Jessica, Abby, and Malice, though talking her parents into it was still a work in progress.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh we will,&quot; Tyree smiled back and then followed Doctor Stein into the room.<br />
<br />
The room was of modest size with enough room for a small dresser and a twin bed. It wasn&#39;t big, but then for the most part these rooms rarely had overnight visitors. Once the new Animalian was vaccinated, they were on their way. On some level it was expected that Ben and Tyree would be no different. As they entered, they noted Doctor Stein preparing the two needles.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do we need to strip?&quot; Ben asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It may help... but you don&#39;t need to do that at present,&quot; Doctor Stein spoke, &quot;and I&#39;d think a lot of that would best be done in private. We do keep a change of clothes that are more... practical for Animalians so you won&#39;t need to worry about clothing issues. All that will be needed is the injection to begin your transformation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You ready?&quot; Ben asked as he moved to lift up his shirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Tyree smiled, &quot;let&#39;s go.&quot;<br />
<br />
She lifted up her shirt and the two stood there shirtless while waiting for the injection. Tyree still had a black bra on that covered her C cup chest and a part of her marveled Ben&#39;s well muscled chest. He&#39;d done a large amount of his work in the ranching business in their part of Australia and had fairly well toned muscles as a result of the work needed to feed cattle and at times to keep wild dingoes from the herd. Tyree watched as Doctor Stein moved up to stand beside Ben and prepped a spot on his upper shoulder with an alcohol swab and was privately ready. She found him rather handsome already, and judging by what they&#39;d seen of Animalians, he was about gain even more muscle mass.<br />
<br />
Doctor Stein quietly and quickly went about his work. First he gave Ben the injection in his upper shoulder and then turned to do the same with Tyree. As he finished with her, he turned to head back to the door. As he reached it, he looked over his shoulder and said, &quot;thank you for all your help.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tyree nodded, though she was already feeling a bit warm. She figured it was a reaction to the shot and looked back to Ben and found that he was already well on his way to becoming a Thylacine Animalian. His body seemed to be covered in the yellow/tan fur the animal was known for and his ears had already become &quot;U&quot; shaped and had shifted to the top of his head. She also noticed that he was panting a bit with each breath.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s getting a bit hot...&quot; Ben stated as he looked to Tyree.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your fur&#39;s coming in,&quot; Tyree answered as she felt her own skin seem to itch and as the room felt warmer to her as well.<br />
<br />
The itching of her skin made her scratch at her sides for a moment, though the sensation of her fingers moving against her itchy skin felt a bit different. That brought her attention down to her hand, and she rapidly found that she, too, was changing. Her fingernails had started to lengthen into the modest non-retractable claws of the Thylacine and she could see the same yellowish tan fur starting to grow out across her body. In this, Tyree couldn&#39;t help but smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re changing,&quot; Tyree stated with a smile when she heard a series of soft cracking type sounds. She looked up to see that Ben had worked to get his pants down and was trying to get out of his shoes. The big thing, however, was that his face had pushed forward into a very dog-like muzzle complete with a black triangle for a nose. As Ben wrestled with his clothing she could notice the dark brown stripes running down his back to his hips and to a small nub that was forming at the base of his spine.<br />
<br />
Her marveling at Ben&#39;s transformation couldn&#39;t go on for long as she felt a bit of discomfort in her own body. It was primarily in her feet and on her spine. Her feet felt cramped inside her shoes, like they were starting to get longer but had no room to grow. That soon brought Tyree into a series of hops as she lifted one foot up and hastily pulled off her shoes one at a time. As she got each shoe off, she found her lengthening in order to take on a digitigrade stance. Like her hands, her toes had gained the non-retractable claws. Once properly on her knew feet, she could tell she was a bit taller as some of the fixtures of the room were slightly shorter than they were a moment ago.<br />
<br />
However, the easing of her feet wasn&#39;t the end of it. She could feel pressure on the end of her spine, as her tail was starting to grow there. She could also feel that her underwear and bra were also starting to feel rather small on her, signaling the further development of many of the secondary sexual characteristics that mature Animalians were well known for. It was tight and constraining, and as her own muzzle pushed forward from her face, Tyree was a bit perplexed as to which issue to deal with first, though she eventually settled on relieving the pressure on her hips as there was also something that felt a bit odd.<br />
<br />
Ben couldn&#39;t help but smile. He&#39;d always found Tyree beautiful, and as the two of them continued to turn into Thylacine Animalians, he found her to be even more beautiful. Her hips were stretching out wider and her breasts were noticeably larger and appeared almost painfully stuffed inside a bra that was too small for her. Ben also noticed the obvious outlines of her muscles underneath her fur. However, as she managed to get her panties down, Ben noticed something just above her vagina. It seemed to be a small opening that almost looked like a second belly button, but then Ben remembered that the Thylacine was a marsupial, just like many other Australian/Tasmanian mammals were. That was the opening for pouch.<br />
<br />
Tyree didn&#39;t get the chance to investigate it though, as her tail burst out behind her. She then gave a pained grunt as her black bra finally lost the battle with her swelling breasts and they bounced free as the material that housed them fell to the floor. It left her panting for a few moments as Ben approached her.<br />
<br />
&quot;You look good,&quot; Ben said to her as he slowly approached, &quot;are you okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel better now,&quot; Tyree admitted, &quot;though I probably could have gotten out of those clothes a bit quicker... it would have made things a bit more comfortable.&quot;<br />
<br />
She then looked up to see Ben as he stood before her, and she found him to look quite good too. His shoulders where broader, his chest deeper. He wasn&#39;t as big as some of the males that she&#39;d seen from what was televised of the IAC, but he was still desirable in many ways. In fact his voice even seemed a little bit deeper now that the pair of them were Thylacine Animalians.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... you look good,&quot; Ben said to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;So do you, Benji,&quot; Tyree smiled and made her way to them and they managed a small kiss, &quot;In fact, you&#39;re looking so good... I&#39;m ready for my second dose.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben only smiled and they kissed again.</p>
