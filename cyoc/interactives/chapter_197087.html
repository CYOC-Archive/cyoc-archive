<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Hear anything back from your cousin yet, Todd? I’d assume that since he’s a junior and a wolf, he’s got some pretty good knowledge on when and where parties take place each night of the week,” Mike said, kicking his paws up on the dashboard of his truck. After finishing and paying for their meals, Todd sent his cousin Dan a text asking if he knew if any parties were happening that night. While they waited, Mike ushered the two younger men to his truck so they didn’t have to wait outside. <br />
<br />
“N-Not yet,” Todd replied, turning off his phone and tucking it in his pocket. “He might be b-busy with homework or something right now.” The wolf sat alone in the back seat of the truck, but he didn’t mind. After all, he had urged Sam to sit up in the passenger’s seat with his brother. “O-Out of curiosity, why do you think he’d k-know where all the parties are?”<br />
<br />
“Because you wolves are fucking party animals!” Mike said with a laugh. “Like I said back in the diner, the CVU Pack threw some raging parties when I went to school here. Hell, I met Adam at one of their parties in my freshman year.”<br />
<br />
Sam had been sitting like his older brother was, with his paws up on the dashboard and hands behind his head. Upon hearing this revelation from Mike, however, the tiger sat up straight and looked at his brother in shock. “I thought you said that you two met at a study session?” Sam asked, which made Mike start cracking up. <br />
<br />
“Seriously fuzzball!? You actually believed that lie I told mom and dad when I brought Adam to dinner that one night? I thought you were smarter than that!” The older tiger ruffled the fur on Sam’s head. “I didn’t want mom and dad to know that I had been going to parties and stuff, you know?”<br />
<br />
Sam shook his head and laughed in disbelief. “Okay okay. Knowing you, I should have thought twice about what you said. So then, how did you two meet at that party?”<br />
<br />
Mike put a hand on his chin as he tried to recall some memories. “If I remember correctly, the party was around the very beginning of my freshman year,” he said. “I had learned about the party from some wolf upperclassmen. The CVU Pack was hosting the party at their frat house as a way for freshmen to mingle with each other and get their first taste of college life. So anyway, when I got to the party, I started chatting with some other freshmen and seeing what they thought about everything so far. Most people seemed to be enjoying themselves, but there was this fox who was sitting by himself off to the side. I genuinely don’t know what drew me to him, but I dismissed myself from the conversation I was having and went over to talk to him. I sat down next to him, introduced myself, and struck up a conversation with him. Adam and I actually hit it off right then and there. We must have talked for a good hour and a half, because before I knew it, the party was beginning to die down. The night was still young, so I suggested that we go out for a little night on the town. I had remembered seeing a night club not far from the campus, so I suggested we go there. He was hesitant at first, but I managed to convince him. We danced and talked for hours and hours, and the more we talked, the more I realized how adorable Adam was. Of course, I had no idea if he was gay or not, so I didn’t make any moves as to not come off as a creep. When we finally went back to campus, I walked him back to his dorm, and he thanked me for such a fun time before confessing that he wasn’t sure why, but he found me rather attractive and wanted to see me again. So naturally, I leaned in and gave him a quick kiss. His face went beet red in an instant, and when he asked if we could kiss again, I knew right then and there that he was the one for me. The rest is pretty much history.”<br />
<br />
“That was a c-cute story,” Todd commented, his tail wagging a little. “A-And you two are happy t-together?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, most definitely,” Mike responded. “We dated all four years of college, and on our graduation day, I pulled Adam aside, told him that I wasn’t ready to leave his side just yet, and got down on one knee. We’ve been married for almost a year now, and I don’t regret a thing.” Mike’s phone began to ring almost as soon as he finished talking. The tiger reached into his pocket and pulled out his phone, a grin on his face as he read the caller ID. “Speak of the devil…” he said with a chuckle before pressing the answer button and holding the phone up to his ear. “Hey babe. How are you?”<br />
<br />
“I’m doing pretty good, thanks,” Adam replied. “I was just finishing up dinner and getting ready to watch some TV for a bit, but I wanted to call you so I could hear your voice. You’re going to be back home tomorrow night, right?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I should be home around 6 PM if traffic isn’t an issue.”<br />
<br />
“Good. That gives me plenty of time to prepare for the night’s events.” The fox’s voice had shifted to a rather sensual tone. Anyone could put two and two together and deduce what he had planned. Mike quickly put his paws down, trying to hide the growing erection in his shorts, which made Sam start to laugh a bit. <br />
<br />
“Huh? Who’s that? Is there someone else in the car with you?”<br />
<br />
“Relax babe, it’s just Sam.”<br />
<br />
“Sam? Who’s…oh, your younger brother. I completely forgot how close you were to CVU. How is he doing?”<br />
<br />
“He’s doing just fine. Oh, I met his boyfriend too.”<br />
<br />
“Really?!” Adam’s sudden reaction made Todd jump a little, especially since the conversation had now shifted to talking about him. “Tell me about him. Is he…?”<br />
<br />
“He’s not a fox, babe. You might be a bit jealous of him though. Sam managed to find himself a rather good-looking wolf to be his boyfriend.”<br />
<br />
Adam was silent for a few seconds, which told Mike all he needed to know. He covered his phone with his hand and turned to face Todd before quietly saying “He’s totally jealous of you.” The wolf covered his face in embarrassment as his tail began wagging behind him. After a few more seconds, Adam finally spoke again.<br />
<br />
“A wolf, huh?” he asked. “So they’re just like us when we were in college? I know that younger siblings like to copy their older siblings sometimes, but jeez!”<br />
<br />
“Babe, be nice,” Mike said, only joking a little bit. “You know you don’t have to compete for my love and attention, right?”<br />
<br />
Adam let out a sigh. “I know, it’s just a force of habit sometimes,” he said. “Had to compete with three other siblings for attention when I was a kit, and I still do whenever we all get together. I’ll break that habit eventually. Anyways, did you have any other plans for the night?”<br />
<br />
“Possibly. Todd, Sam’s boyfriend, is a member of the CVU Pack. He texted his cousin to see if there are any parties going on nearby.” Just then, Todd’s phone went off. The wolf looked at his phone for a second before looking up at Mike and Sam.<br />
<br />
“Dan said there’s a party over at the Alpha Theta Delta frat house,” Todd said. “Do you know where that is?”<br />
<br />
“Alpha Theta Delta?” Adam asked. “Isn’t that…?”<br />
<br />
“The place we met,” Mike finished, chuckling a bit. “Well what are the odds of that?”<br />
<br />
“Well, I’ll hang up and let you three enjoy your night. I love you, stud.”<br />
<br />
“I love you too, fuzzy butt.” This earned a groan from Adam in response, which made Mike laugh. “See ya tomorrow babe.” Mike hung up his call and tucked his phone back into his pocket. “Sorry about that. Now, let’s head out to this party, shall we?” The older tiger put his car keys in the ignition and gave them a twist, turning on his pickup truck. He backed out of his parking spot and drove out of the diner’s parking lot, making a left on Mane St. as he headed towards the Alpha Theta Delta frat house. <br />
<br />
“Hey Todd, why don’t you send a text out to Curtis and see if he wants to come socialize with other canines?” Sam suggested. “Might help get him out of that funk he’s been in.”<br />
<br />
“O-Okay, I’ll definitely do that,” the wolf replied. “I-I’ll also invite Milo and D-Dare while I’m at it.” Todd looked back down at his phone and began texting their friends.</p>
