<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nick flopped back on Jason&#39;s bed, lightly tugging and twisting the new nipple ring through the fabric of his shirt. Anthony really had ramped up the sensitivity of those nipples a bit, made them plumper. He could feel the bundle of memories and emotions that was the mostly dormant Jason quivering in delight at the new sensations. Enjoying it. Wanting more. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, by the time I&#39;m done with you, you&#39;ll have plenty of little kinks.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick pulled out Jason&#39;s phone with his other hand, and went to the hook up app. He had a few offers to meet up tonight already and with a grin started flipping through the profiles. He could feel Jason&#39;s disgust an annoyance at first, but Nick tamped down on that, using the feeling of playing with those sensitive nipples while looking at the shirtless profile shots to slowly work away at that resistance. The obviously &#39;roided out muscle beast in the first profile was certainly an appealing option. Bigger than Jason at least in muscle mass. Nick kept flipping. Next was a muscle bear about Jason&#39;s size, though a couple decades older. It was the third pic that caught Nick&#39;s attention though. There was no face in the picture, just a nude torso. Fit and defined, though not as muscular as Jason, but with pecs and a six pack covered in dark, thick but trimmed hair, the glint of barbells through his nipples. He had gorgeous arms, but what also caught his attention was the screen name, KingDong. Something about the pic tickled a memory though, not Jason&#39;s memories, but Nick. Couldn&#39;t hurt to message..<br />
<br />
HockeyBottom: KingDong, huh?<br />
<br />
He sent it, it took a few minutes but a response did come.<br />
<br />
KingDong: My friend made my profile, thought it was funny. Gets attention though.<br />
HB: But is it true?<br />
<br />
There was another pause before a pic came through. It was the same furry torso but with a hard cock laying against his stomach, long and thick. It must have been over ten inches and wide as a soup can. Nick had never seen one so large outside of a porno, even in a porno it&#39;d be obscene.<br />
<br />
KD: Proof enough or do you want me to take a picture of it with a certain item like some guys ask?<br />
HB: Holy shit, I don&#39;t think I could take that.<br />
KD: Not many can, I&#39;m good with fooling around. If it becomes more, well, you wouldn&#39;t be the first guy I trained to take it.<br />
<br />
In the back of Nick&#39;s mind, Jason was both repulsed and curious. Nick just grinned. He could hurry the process along, focusing on making Jason&#39;s ass more pliable to take that monster tool, and maybe adding a little more roundness to his ass. Anthony said it would take him time to learn to change things quickly, but he could start practicing with this. He did feel a certain.. tingling in his ass, either because of his new powers or from thinking about it, but he hoped the former.<br />
<br />
HB: I&#39;d be an idiot to say no.<br />
KD: Then come over.<br />
<br />
There was an address next. Nick hopped out of bed to get changed, stripping out of his current clothes. He settled on a bright red thong with a pouch just big enough to hold his cock, he pulled the tight pair of jeans back on, letting the straps of the thong just peek over the waistband. He pulled on a net tank that hugged his torso tight, the glint of metal from his new piercings obvious through the openings in the fabric. With that he headed out. He got a few shocked stares from his frat brothers on his way out, but none of them stopped him or said anything, they only shared confused looks. Nick made sure to swagger confidently, and even winked at one of the ones that seemed to stare a little longer. Brody.. he&#39;d keep that one in mind. He had another destination though.<br />
<br />
Soon he stood in front of an apartment door that was only mile from the frat house, a place where a lot of the more independent students and grad students lived. He gave a knock on the door. The man from the photos answered, at least it was the right torso, still bare and fuzzy, though he had put on jeans. Nick gave a start at the face though. He knew this guy, Phil King, he was a grad student and a TA in Nick&#39;s biochem class. Jason had never met him before. Nick on the other hand had fantasized about the cute TA in class, never knowing what he was hiding between his legs. Phil&#39;s youthful but bearded face split into a grin. &quot;HockeyBottom?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jason.&quot; Nick replied, following Anthony&#39;s advice from earlier.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jason. I&#39;m Phil.&quot; He stepped out of the way to let Nick enter<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve seen you around campus.&quot; Nick couldn&#39;t help himself from saying as he stepped inside, he felt a hand go to his ass and almost jumped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Those weren&#39;t in the pics.&quot; Phil said with a note of amusement as he reached out and tugged gently at one of Jason&#39;s piercings.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fairly new. I wanted to make sure they were fully healed before taking new pics. Guess it&#39;s about time.&quot; Nick tried to sound casual about it. Phil nodded as if that made sense.<br />
<br />
&quot;Beer?&quot; Phil offered as he slipped by and into the kitchen. &quot;You&#39;ve got that first time random online hook up feel about you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick followed, cocking his head to the side. &quot;That obvious?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Most guys are trying to get my pants down the moment they get in the door.&quot; He joked, handing over a beer and taking one for himself, he headed over to the couch and Nick followed. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll take it slow and easy. Just a little fooling around.&quot; He used the same tone of voice as he did in the classroom when trying to tach a particularly difficult lesson. Soft, reassuring, confident.<br />
<br />
Soon, Jason was shirtless and leaning back. Nick found it harder to distinguish between himself and the jock the higher emotions ran. Right now they were running so high Nick and Jason felt like the same person. Jason&#39;s reticence and was being overwhelmed by Nick&#39;s desire though, and Nick knew no matter how muddled things got between them, he&#39;d always win out. Jason was no longer repulsed though he was almost as eager as Nick.<br />
<br />
Phil leaned towards Jason and kissed him, slowly working at those jeans to free the jock&#39;s cock. In most cases he&#39;d be the big one in the room, but not against Phil King. Once Jason&#39;s pants were on the floor, Phil&#39;s followed suit, both men sitting naked on the couch as they made out. Phil was taking it easy like he promised, and Jason got his hands on that massive wonder between Phil&#39;s legs, stroking it softly. &quot;You&#39;ve really found guys who can take this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It takes work.&quot; Phil admitted, his hand running down Jason&#39;s back. &quot;And never the whole thing, but you&#39;d be surprised how far things can stretch when time is taken to do it right.&quot;  Jason gasped softly as he felt a finger prodding at his hole, then force its way inside. Jason leaned forward against Phil as the man fingered him, slowly sliding a second finger inside. &quot;You might have a knack for it though.&quot;<br />
<br />
Two hours later the two men were in the bedroom, face to face with their cocks pressed up against each other. Phil was guiding a lubed dildo into Jason&#39;s ass with one hand while Jason worked diligently on frotting their cocks. Jason had already came twice in the last couple hour, Phil once. Phil was attentive, more eager to please his partner than himself, though he always did it in a way that made sure Jason, despite physically being the bigger of the two was not the one in charge. Phil hit Jason&#39;s g-spot with the dildo and the orgasm he had been holding back came, his seed spilling onto already soiled and drying sheets. He had used fingers, his tongue, and now the dildo, making Jason cum each time. Jason struggled once to get his mouth over the head of Phil&#39;s cock, settled for using his hand and tongue to bring the man to climax. This time Phil thrust his hips a bit as their cocks rubbed together, Jason&#39;s cum acting as lube on Phil&#39;s cock until he finally came as well, strong enough to hit the headboard above the bed with the first shot.<br />
<br />
Phil rolled onto his back, Jason moved to curl up next to him, not minding the sticky sheets, he rested his head on Phil&#39;s chest and dozed sleepily, the other man rubbing his hand up and down his back. Nick thought for a moment and let himself slip free of Jason and into Phil. The change in perspective made him dizzy for a moment, but once he settled in he grinned. Jason stirred slightly but stayed put. He was sure that was a good sign that Jason&#39;s changes were coming along nicely. Nick reached down and stroked the massive cock between his legs with his other hand, just wanting to know what it was like to be so endowed. Maybe once he was done with Jason he&#39;d look for someone with a cock like this.<br />
<br />
Jason started stirring more so Nick let himself slip back from Phil into Jason. Each time he did so it felt easier to make the change. He eased the nervousness that had been rising in Jason and settled back down. &quot;I should probably get going.&quot; Jason said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Spend the night. I could use the company.&quot; Phil said with a yawn and a grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? No roommate?&quot; Jason asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not at the moment, I rent the second room out sometimes, but the last guy dropped out and went home. Luckily he had to give me a few months rent anyway, so no, just me.&quot; Phil kept caressing Jason&#39;s back. Jason just agreed to stay with a nod and let himself doze back off.</p>
