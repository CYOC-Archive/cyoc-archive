<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Is this really happening? My thoughts were rolling over the information that I just received over and over again. Was i really about to live in an area, with a bunch of strangers, where every single move that I do could change the rest of my life forever? A simple wrong step, a simple wrong brush could make me into anything... Would I be able to distinct the old me from the new one afterward? Will I be able to remember me? I don&#39;t know what to believe anymore... My mind has come to a halt, I was lost...<br />
<br />
Revand: Well... we need a plan of action.<br />
<br />
Samilla: A plan? For what?<br />
<br />
Revand: Simple, get out of here.<br />
<br />
Abigail: Good job Einstein! I hadn&#39;t tought of that! Gettting out of here is a genius idea! Now explain how the hell you&#39;re going to do that?<br />
<br />
Revand: Well... If I understood well, the door will soon open and we&#39;ll be released into a comfortable living area with multiple facilities of use. Even thought the transformative part of his speech is rather unbelievable, we&#39;ll have to be causious at any moment. And since finding a possible exit will probably take a while... I think we&#39;ll be obligated to get to know each other, whether you like it or not.<br />
<br />
Hadley: How... How can you be so sure that there is a way out?<br />
<br />
Revand: First of all, I&#39;m not sure, but its our best bet at the moment. Moreover, A building without an exit, that doesn&#39;t exist. How would he have brought us here without entering first? Also, if there is no exit, we may at least get rescued by outsiders, but we should at least try to escape on our side. What do you all think?<br />
<br />
Trevor: This isn&#39;t a bad idea... Tristan didn&#39;t mention an exit, but he didn&#39;t exclude that idea either!<br />
<br />
Samilla: Yeah! We souldn&#39;t give up!<br />
<br />
I guess they are happy from this weak and unstable plan. I honestly don&#39;t think that Tristan would have left a obvious exit door out there for us to find, but this is our best bet. The mood seems to be lighter, a slight smile crossing the face of some. My eyes are still watery from my earlier cries, but I hope that we manage something out.<br />
<br />
Abigail: Okay, that&#39;s great and all, but can we talk about the elephant in the room? What is that transformative bullshit that this psycho talked about? We&#39;re not supposed to believe this aren&#39;t we? Is that guy serious?<br />
<br />
Revand: I don&#39;t believe whatever he tried to blurt into our minds. This idea was probably something he caught on in the moment to make us feel even more paranoid about this whole kidnapping situation. We shouldn&#39;t worry about it.<br />
<br />
Hadley: Maybe you&#39;re right... But it&#39;s a strange think to say don&#39;t you think? I mean... of all torture he could&#39;ve lied about, he chose that weird idea?<br />
<br />
I don&#39;t think we should let our guards down over this. His revenge would be a lot too bland if it was for a simple kidnapping. Even thought it&#39;s hard to believe, I&#39;m going to be careful in there.<br />
<br />
My thought process and our conversation was cut short by a sudden sound coming from the door. A metal mechanism seemed to activate, and the door slightly went ajar. Not enough for us to see inside, but enough so that we know that it&#39;s unlocked.<br />
<br />
Abigail: Oh... Damn.<br />
<br />
Trevor: The moment of thruth huh?<br />
<br />
Revand: He could have lied about our habitations too, so be on your guards.<br />
<br />
Samilla:... Who opens it?<br />
<br />
I&#39;m not going. I take a step back, showing my uncertitude. Most of us seemed in the same state.<br />
<br />
Trevor: F-fine I&#39;ll go.<br />
<br />
The built man approached the heavy metallic opening, carefully putting the fingers of his two hands on the protruding side. He then pulled with all is might, and the door creaked open.<br />
<br />
Hadley: It&#39;s... It&#39;s so-<br />
<br />
Revand: Beautiful.<br />
<br />
I stand in awe in front of the spectacle that is upfolding through the gap of the door. There is a large indoor courtyard laying in front of us. In its center, there is a humid and almost tropical garden, with multiple exotic plants of all sorts. Next to it, on the right side sits a voluminous foutain, the light reflecting from its surface. On the left however, there is a short cut lawn, followed by a small glass summer table surrounded by a few chairs. The ceiling was either covered in vines and wooden structure, or casting a powerful light over the whole scene, causing the illusion of an outdoor environment.<br />
<br />
Myself: W-wow...<br />
<br />
Abigail: If there is something that I didn&#39;t expect, between everything that I thought of, it&#39;s THAT!<br />
<br />
Trevor: He don&#39;t seem to have lied about the comfortable living area...<br />
<br />
Farim took a first step in, his shoes brushing against the concret path that was surrounding the garden, separating it from the poll and the lawn zone. They looked side to side, as if expecting something to jump to them, but sure enough, there was nothing more than this luxurious place.<br />
<br />
Farim: Well... This is quite inviting...<br />
<br />
Samilla suddenly jumped out of the our waiting room to join the gorgeous interior of the plaza. The others soon joined them one by one. I was the last behind, and I followed with extremely careful steps.<br />
<br />
Hadley: Is everything okay Vivian? You&#39;re paler than a bed sheet!<br />
<br />
Myself: Y-yeah I&#39;m fine... just... unsure.<br />
<br />
Revand: With reasons. Why would he put us in a comfortable living, if its to take revenge? The mind of this man makes fewer and fewer sense by the second.<br />
<br />
Nobody responded to that. Obviously, the possiblity that the transformation talk was real still lingered. Revand seems so sure of its unexistance...<br />
<br />
Trevor: Hey look guys! There a door in the back!<br />
<br />
Indeed, if you look after that garden in the middle, there is a door. I would say that it is quite the simple door,  grey color and round handle. Trevor turned it, revealing an round room. Much darker than the atrium that we were standing in. We followed the tall man through, and into the new room. <br />
<br />
Abigail: Dayum! This place is huge!<br />
<br />
The ceiling of this particular room was indeed pretty high, giving it a grandiose and important feeling, even thought it was empty. Well, empty if we don&#39;t count the four doors that ornated the walls. The one behind us leads to the courtyard we just came from, but what was the other three? The others as already started to investigate the rightmost one, leaving me behind again. I ran to catch up, and found my self in a normal looking zone with multiple other doors, all labeled with a drawing on their front. One was a toilet, another one a fork, there was also a washing machine, and some others. <br />
<br />
Revand: This seems like the living area. There seems to be a few useful facilities for basic living needs like a kitchen, a bathroom and a laundry room, according to these indications.<br />
<br />
Samilla: So this is like... the basic needs wing of the building?<br />
<br />
Trevor: It does look like it...<br />
<br />
Hadley: Hey everybody! Come see this!<br />
<br />
I hadn&#39;t realized it, but Hadley is not with us. She seemed to have headed for another of the areas from the room before, we rush back again through the grandiose room, and enters the door that was at our left earlier. In it, I can see a corridor with eight doors, this time not labeled by drawing, but with words. Not words in fact, but names! Our names!<br />
<br />
Hadley: This is the dorms he mentionned! We all have our individual rooms!<br />
<br />
Trevor: This is such a great place to live, theres so much to see and do! Why would he give us so much comfort like that?<br />
<br />
Myself: I mean... maybe if... you know, the transformation?<br />
<br />
Revand: Ha! You don&#39;t seriously believe his rubbish? I already told you all, absolutely impossible. There is no way that such technology exists, and even more in the hand of a random guy! If this was real, the entire world would know about it!<br />
<br />
Myself: ...<br />
<br />
Abigail: Anyway! If we have an living place, our own rooms, and a semblance of outdoor, what might be hiding behind that fourth door? I want to see!<br />
<br />
All this walking started to feel tiring. I don&#39;t know how they do this so easily. They were already in central room as I was still trailing behind. Could this all be a scheme to hide this place&#39;s true intentions? I am not sure of what to think of all this. I thought kidnapping left to dangerous situations, and now we&#39;re threated a kings? This can&#39;t be right, there obviously is a catch. What if what Tristan said is true? Everything here could change us? My stance steadied as I made sure to not even brush the walls as I walked back.<br />
<br />
EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEECK!!!<br />
<br />
A scream?! What&#39;s happening? I ran back into the center room.</p>
