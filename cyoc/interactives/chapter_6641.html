<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next three hours after arriving at Jimmy's house were rather pleasant, since Jimmy's mother wasn't home from work yet. <br />
<br />
They took a shower together and engaged in some exploration of each other's bodies, leading to mutual masturbation in the shower.<br />
<br />
They ate a meal, leading to Angel's discovery that beef and canned vegetables smelled rancid and sickening to her new form, but fresh vegetables and fish were both acceptable and extremely flavorful.<br />
<br />
They also engaged in serious necking. This was pleasant to both - Jimmy because it was new and exciting, Angel because her former experience had never included this activity (at least with a young boy).<br />
<br />
Angel learned that his name was Jimmy, he lived alone with his widowed mother (whose picture indicated a woman in her prime of life and nice looking but not beautiful), he was 12 years old, and the house was owned by a family trust. She also learned about his extensive homosexual experiences, as well as his sexual fantasies.<br />
<br />
Jimmy learned what Angel wanted him to learn - that she was an innocent waif being hunted by evil men who had held her prisoner in a secret lab, and needed him to protect her. (In other words, a pack of lies.)<br />
<br />
They both went to the basement and began cleaning out the ancient bomb shelter which Jimmy's mother never entered. It had a thick steel door (about 3 inches) that could be locked from the inside, bunks and shelves, and a ventilation system and lights. It also had spider webs and dead bugs, but a bit of elbow grease (punctuated by some necking and fondling) helped with that.<br />
<br />
When Jimmy's mother got home, Jimmy went and acted like a Good Son while Angel continued cleaning. It would make an excellent hideout.<br />
<br />
During her cleaning, Angel found some old boxes containing old leather straps and riding crops. A photo album inside had pictures of Jimmy's mother some years younger in bondage positions and a masked man. Some of the pictures were of her pregnant. One picture of her bound, gagged, and in her last stages of pregnancy, was labeled &quot;Daddy's  Good Little Girl&quot;. The date was about 12 years ago.<br />
<br />
Angel inspected the shelter and the basement outside. She was certain the pictures had been made here.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guess why she don't come down here,&quot; Angel muttered to herself.<br />
<br />
After a while, the lights went out, and Angel snuck upstairs, into Jimmy's room, and spooned with him.<br />
<br />
-------<br />
<br />
Angel was pleasantly surprised to discover that she awoke after only a couple of hours fully rested. It was still a couple of hours until dawn, so she ate another meal and took stock of her body.<br />
<br />
She could see fine in the dark, she noted, as well as having exceptional senses of all kinds. She had been pleased to note during her rescue of Jimmy that she was as strong as a tiny elfin dickgirl as she had been as a huge and muscular male soldier, and somewhat faster.<br />
<br />
And then there was the case of her altered sexual organs ...<br />
<br />
Something stuck in her mind - the chart at the &quot;hospital&quot; had indicated that her rapes had been a regular occurance, authorized by whatever doctors had run the place. Why would humping a delirious biologically-altered captive be proscribed? And why sex? Why not just handjobs?<br />
<br />
Unless she now needed it ...<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that why I've been so horny?&quot; she whispered. &quot;Because my body's been re-engineered to be horny? Because I now need it?&quot;<br />
Angel went over the list - strong, fast, excellent senses, unable to eat over-processed or over-hormone-fed foods, hermaphroditic, needing sexual contact on a regular basis ...<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds like some crazy bisexual hippy eco-freak's version of a Master Race,&quot; she muttered. &quot;But how would someone like that get facilities and connections to pull it off? And why me?&quot;<br />
<br />
It was a mystery, and Angel hated mysteries.<br />
<br />
----------<br />
<br />
The next morning, Angel waited patiently downstairs while Jimmy's mom cooked breakfast (which smelled odd to her), got ready for work, and left. The rest of the afternoon was split between cleaning the shelter, necking, and various forms of sexual activity, including a 69-style blowjob where they swallowed each other's semen.<br />
<br />
Angel wondered how much of her own behavior toward Jimmy was from her remade body's new instincts, how much was from conditioning during her blank period ... and how much was due to those occasional stirrings he had always had toward effiminate males.<br />
<br />
Angel's original persona Rick Hunter hadn't been gay, not at all. He had enjoyed many women, completely and eagerly. But sometimes, once every three months or so in secret, he would patronize the more feminine-looking transvestite hookers. He had always rationalized it to himself that it was a 'change-of-pace' thing, that such hookers are mostly female in every respect but one. Now he wasn't so sure ...<br />
<br />
Jimmy was still not thinking rationally. And why should he? He was a preteen boy with a lover who fulfilled every sexual desire - both straight and gay! Of course, she was a semi-vegetarian elf-girl with a penis and she had to be hidden from his mom and everyone else, but she was still a girlfriend!<br />
<br />
After some mutual release, she pulled the money she had stolen from the convenience store out of her hair. &quot;Jimmy, I need food and clothes. Can you buy it with this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; Jimmy said uncertainly. &quot;I guess.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I nned fresh fruit and vegetables,&quot; she reminded him. &quot;No canned stuff and only fish for meat.&quot; She wasn't sure about chicken, but why take chances? &quot;And I'll need a shirt and pants and some underwear - not a lot, nothing fancy.&quot; She kissed him, probing his mouth with her tongue. &quot;Please?&quot;<br />
<br />
After that kiss, Jimmy couldn't really say no.<br />
<br />
As he left, Angel wondered whether or not to tell Jimmy about the things she had found. From the evidence, she was certain that Jimmy's mother had been the sex-slave of Jimmy's father, who may or may not have been her father as well. The album could blackmail her into cooperation ... or would she cooperate voluntarily? And would Jimmy consent to blackmailing his own mother?<br />
<br />
**********<br />
<br />
After going to the farmer's market, Jimmy raced to the thrift store, got some set of girl-clothes, and started heading home.<br />
<br />
He didn't pay any mind to the sleek black van driving down the road.<br />
<br />
***********<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, The Doctor and the Gray Man were talking again. The Doctor was looking very nervous.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thirty-six hours have passed,&quot; the Gray Man said. &quot;Angel-7 is not in custody. No reports of it - or anything resembling it - have been heard in a hundred-mile radius. You assured me that Angel-7's special requirements would prevent it from surviving this long.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then - then it's dead somewhere,&quot; the Doctor muttered nervously. &quot;A corpse in the woods somewhere. We just haven't located it yet, that's all.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Gray Man pushed a button. &quot;Nevertheless, the Project is in jeopardy. We should begin work on Angel-13 ASAP.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes!&quot; the Doctor agreed enthusiastically, grateful to be let off the hook. &quot;And of course we should copy Angel-7's profile and treatment as closely as possible. What available subjects - OW!&quot;<br />
<br />
As the needle entered the Doctor's buttock, it occured to him that he was the same age as the Angel-7 subject, and had the same blood type. Then he went to sleep.<br />
