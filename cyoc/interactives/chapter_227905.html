<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next morning, when the new “Paul” (Mandy) came home early. with Mellisa waking him up early with a nice surprise what enclosed, her mouth and his dick, with Mellisa telling him after he had organised inside her mouth, to get out, with her parents will be back soon, but that made him think of the plane he has to, what was to take her sons life, what made him smile walking through the door of his/her house.<br />
<br />
But he did not expect to see his son back in his own body sleeping on the couch, this might complicate things, how long ago did he fall asleep was it more than 12h? he thought his son could of change at 10 pm or earlier yesterday and seeing it is now 10:45 in the morning so his son might be able to swap, but to who.<br />
<br />
he still did not know who to make Paul into, he was no a monster, and  not going to trap his son in his moms body, (Mandy’s old body ) he was thinking the kid next could do, sure he was 10 but he was much more active than Paul having talked to his mom when he was in his old woman&#39;s body Mandy, and new they makes the boy do like 5 clubs during the week, and having to keep a B+ on all school work.<br />
<br />
and looking at the asleep lazy boy, now he knows he him self is going to make a much better active Paul than her son, And decided then and there, that this is the best idea, and new that one of Tonys (the 10 year old next door) swimming trunks was upstairs , with having looked after him 3 weeks ago after his swinging lesson, before picking him up.<br />
<br />
So that is what he did, he grabbed the medallion and put it around her sons sleeping neck and then pulled the blanket off him seeing with shock and some relief that he was naked, and had some underwear what he obviously used to wank into beside him, he did not really judge him for doing such a thing, with being in his body so much that he is stealing his life, for the greater good, and knowing that he is going to be a much better Paul.<br />
<br />
And so he throws Tonys speedos on to his son and saw that it has been 12h seeing him start to shrink and his wavy hair suck in turning black and becoming a buzz cut and eventually looking like a very healthy and athletic 10 year old boy who has not gone throw puberty yet looking at his now tiny balls and dick, and then put the sheet over him again and took back the medallion, now wearing gloves not wanting anything to happen to himself, knowing that this is best for his son, with Tonys parents being much more strict, and not a push over like himself.<br />
<br />
But now Looking at the cute boy sleeping on the conch he knew his plan was working, now to get the real Tony to swap with his/Paul’s trans friend and then get his trans friend to become his old woman&#39;s body what will be his new mom, and then finally everyone will be happy, well old Paul will be happy once he is use to his new life.<br />
<br />
So he walked out the house and saw straight away Tony running around the front yard with his soccer ball kicking it in to the net, and well Mandy thought he is on a role not having to knock on the door and convince his parents to play with him, so he walked up to him and said, “what&#39;s up Tony” and explained what he can do and his idea.<br />
<br />
“so I have a magic neckless and it will let you become a big 14 year old, and you won&#39;t have to yell at your mom or dad or them yell at you anymore?” the boy looked up at him, only seeing Paul, his cool 14 year old neighbour, but did not know if he was messing with him, but decided to play alone, said “uhhhm, ok” with it seeming fun to play pretend if it was not real.<br />
<br />
Mandy just smiled and said “cool, you are going to become my friend Sam, he is a little weird but with you in him you will make him so cool” with Mandy now “New Paul” smiling down at him, making up that Sam is her friend, with the week he has been his son Pual, he has not said a lot to Sam, with him being a trans person, wearing skirts and such, and does not run in the same cereals as Paul, but I think I can talk him/her into becoming my mom.<br />
<br />
So, Mandy walked a couple of doors down knowing where Sam lives by knowing Sams mom when he was Pual’s mom, and he/she live close as well, and got there in 5 mins so he knocked on the door, and Luckily Sam opened the door in his/her pink pjs rubbing his/her eyes.<br />
<br />
Mandy took a deep breath and said “hay Sam” she/he looked confused seeing a boy she/he barely talks to form school, and said “uhhm hay.... Paul?” Mandy put a smile on and said “so... i got an idea I think you will like” and explained the whole idea, of the medallion and him/her becoming my mom, and the boy next to him becoming him/her.<br />
<br />
Obviously, Sam did not believe him, but he managed to make him get changed and give her/his Pjs to Tony, so Tony can change into Him/her and prove it.<br />
<br />
And well it only took 5 minuets for Sam to get changed in to his/her cloths, what was a skirt and a pink tank top, and gave his/her PJs to Tony and told him where the toilet was, and in 10 minutes when the toilet door opened, and a copy of Sam came out smiling looking amazingly happy, walking up to them saying “this is amazing, look how tall I am, and look at this hair, it is going down to my back, this is great!!! But I think I am going to drop the whole pink and skirt thing” looking down at his now long legs what had the Pink PJs covering.<br />
<br />
Mandy smiled and said how happy he is that he is happy with his new body and before him and the real Sam left, he said to remember that he is now called Sam, and then started to walk back, with Tonys clothes in hand.<br />
<br />
Once Mandy and Sam got back to his house, he guided Sam to his room, what is soon going to be Sams room and got her/him to sit down and throw the neckless and one of his old woman&#39;s shirts, seeing it made contact on the medallion and the shirt and watched as Sam grew in to his old body, what is now going to be his... mom now, so he smiled at his new mom and said “looking good”, with them all being in the body&#39;s what the “new Paul” had planned<br />
<br />
And he saw the how his mom&#39;s eyes looked so bright and open being overjoyed being a milf of a woman, and “New Paul” just smiled at his mom and said “ it is going to fine now mom, so I&#39;m glad you look like you like being my mom and your new body&quot; haring her say &quot;yes I love this.... darlin&quot;.<br />
<br />
And then the “New Paul” started to head to the door saying &quot;I am going to get the new little Tony back home mom&quot; who is still asleep on their conch, and so &quot;New Paul&quot; went downstairs and scatted the cloths he got from the real Tony, like they were thrown off, took away the cum stained underwear, and then went next door explaining how he was teaching there “son” to play Basketball, but then he went crazy and striped and fell asleep, in his living room to Tony&#39;s parents.<br />
<br />
Surprisingly Tony&#39;s dad brought it straight away, saying Toney has been going through some behaviour problems recently, and headed with “New Paul” to his house and when he picked up what he thought was his son, the &quot;New Tony&quot; surprisingly cuddled into the mans arms, staying asleep, and they both walked out and that was that.<br />
<br />
The “New Paul” fell on to the sofa taking a breath and smiled, knowing he had done it, he has stolen his sons life, and could not wait for his girlfriend to come around later today, so they can have some more fun like last night, and hopefully, the “New Tony” will wait till tomorrow, to demand his body back, what he is never getting back.<br />
<br />
With the “New Paul” knowing his ex-son will be a lot better off, as Tony, and he knows that he is going to be a better Paul with already being a much better boyfriend with the love of his live, and he is going to be able to fly past school, Smiling reading the message from his girlfriend.</p>
