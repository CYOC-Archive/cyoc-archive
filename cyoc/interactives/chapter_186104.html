<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;In defense of all women who have been pregnant,&quot; Kellie spoke up, &quot;while there may be certain things that are uncomfortable... and labor does hurt, but that doesn&#39;t mean that there aren&#39;t good things.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie and Roxie then lead the way up to the front door of the Vaxer house, the door you&#39;d barged through to find that Luna was born a MILF-wolf and hadn&#39;t become old enough to take on a MILF-wolf&#39;s form. You followed behind her with the duffel bag hanging to your side with the long shoulder strap pinning your now long brown hair against the right side of your neck.  The clothes and other assorted things that you put in it had enough weight that the strap going across your front was putting a bit of pressure on your left breast. Meanwhile, the fireproof box with the documents and other things, which you would need for dealing with what would be coming the when the sun came up and you had to fill out the related paperwork that was required with any and all new MILF-wolves, was being held just below your breasts. Luna followed behind you with the PlayStation and the games you had for it. Roxie opened the door for Kellie and ushered you and Luna in.<br />
<br />
&quot;I could feel Luna grow when I was pregnant with her... I could feel her move,&quot; Kellie continued, &quot;and I knew that was my baby girl. And Roxie gave me the most marvelous foot massages while I was pregnant and that was divine. I loved it. And while labor hurt... seeing Luna&#39;s eyes open for the first time and feeling her suckle from me... that made ALL of the negatives worth it. That&#39;s part of the good things about becoming pregnant and being a mother.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right... but that was you... I&#39;m sure you and Rook made the conscious choice to have children,&quot; you pointed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;That we did,&quot; Roxie said as you entered and then shut the door behind you and Luna, &quot;just as you made that choice to get Luna pregnant when she likely asked you to get her pregnant as part of your transformation from Nick to Nicki.&quot;<br />
<br />
You didn&#39;t say anything.<br />
<br />
&quot;And also keep in mind, that as Roxie told you earlier, she was just like you when she first became Roxie,&quot; Kellie answered, &quot;not knowing that my being a MILF-wolf would turn her into a MILF-wolf and carrying with it all the desires for motherhood with it. It wasn&#39;t until close to when I was ready to give birth to Luna that Roxie actually came to grips with those instincts and recognized that with the transformation comes some change in sexuality.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But Roxie said...&quot; you began to protest.<br />
<br />
&quot;I may have misworded it,&quot; Roxie said slowly, which Kellie nodded to.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Kellie nodded, &quot;some MILF-wolves may not have gotten pregnant... but with those that were once male, that has had more to do with their emotional bond to their wife. It has nothing to do with who they are interested in sexually. They love their partner so much that they won&#39;t be with anyone but their partner... but that&#39;s more an emotional thing rather than what they&#39;re attracted to. That desire to be a mother is part of you now as a MILF-wolf and that will raise some interest in men or male werewolves. Whether or not you act on that desire will relate more to your love and relationship with Luna... and even that may relate on what Luna may want as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which is how mom and Roxie&#39;s marriage works,&quot; Luna said to you, &quot;most of their sexual fun is between the two of them... but they will have fun with a male werewolf that comes through town as well. And I&#39;d think that any decision on you becoming a mother, Nicki, should wait until after you&#39;ve gotten more used to those instincts not declare you don&#39;t feel them. They&#39;re there... and to a degree, I could even feel them before I was old enough to transform.&quot;<br />
<br />
You didn&#39;t say anything as Luna passed the point on the floor where she had her transformation and the spot where the two of you had had sex while you were still male and then again once you&#39;d become Nicki. That allowed her to approach a decent sized entertainment center. The television was moderately sized, but the shelves allowed for a separate DVD player, VHS tapes, DVDs, and even a few old records that could be played on the record player on the top of the entire set. On the floor close tot he wall there was a long power strip, and Luna placed the PlayStation on the floor near that power strip and with the games on top of the piece of gaming equipment. As she did this, Roxie came over to sniff at the spot where Luna transformed and then at the spot where you&#39;d had sex with Luna and then transformed.<br />
<br />
&quot;So this is where it all happened,&quot; Roxie said slowly, &quot;my baby girl became her true self and won her mate...&quot; You paused as you watched Roxie look up to Luna as she came around the couch. &quot;I must admit that I&#39;m a bit jealous. But I&#39;m happy for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks dad,&quot; Luna smiled, &quot;we might have made a bit of a mess... but I&#39;ve known that Nicki as Nick wanted to be a MILF-wolf... to be in the right gender. And I wanted to be with Nick/Nicki in every way. So... when Nick came in... things went quickly.&quot; You watched as Luna smiled, &quot;and things got even better when we found that we&#39;d both had feelings for each other but hadn&#39;t be able to say it out loud.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And hopefully the two of you will be happy together, like Kellie and I are,&quot; Roxie then hugged Luna. There wasn&#39;t anything sexual about it but looked like the what one would expect from a parent and child, even if Luna had matured from 18 to 35 in her transformation into a MILF-wolf. &quot;Kellie is the only woman for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And Roxie the only woman for me,&quot; Kellie smiled, &quot;we MILF-wolves may be frisky... but that doesn&#39;t change the love we have for our mates.&quot;<br />
<br />
You found yourself nodding as you looked to Luna, and your thoughts almost immediately starting drifting to making love to her again. But for the moment there were the things that related to putting the things you had brought from what had been your home and they had to be dealt with. The PlayStation and its games were rather easy, as Luna had just set them down, but there was now the duffel bag and the fireproof box that you were presently still carrying.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s good,&quot; you spoke up, &quot;but where will the rest of the stuff to go?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For now... the fireproof box can go into the kitchen,&quot; Kellie commented, &quot;we have a spot that&#39;s out of the way and then tomorrow when you go through all the registration process will come in handy. Once that is done, they can then be taken to where we keep our paperwork and Luna&#39;s, though hers will need to be updated now.&quot;<br />
<br />
From there, Luna&#39;s hug with her father ended and she approached you with alert ears and a warm smile on her muzzle. She quickly nuzzled up to you and licked your cheek while rubbing your right shoulder and arm in an up and down motion that was supposed to be reassuring, and in some ways it was. You eventually managed to lean over to lick Luna&#39;s cheek in return. A couple of times your tongue and her tongue actually made contact with each other as you traded loving licks, which felt as though the two of you were making out. That sensation not only made you feel happy but also turned you on a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;The duffel bag can go up to what will be our room,&quot; Luna said to you, &quot;you know where that is and that my bed is comfy... and would fit both of us.&quot;<br />
<br />
You blushed underneath your fur, wondering if Luna could se it. Luna had a decent sized room that was larger than your old room with a queen sized bed in it. You&#39;d wondered about this at times before, though now, seeing as to how tall Luna had grown in her transformation, you figured that the larger bed was actually to accommodate the MILF-wolf form she would gain once old enough. With you now matching her as a MILF-wolf, that soon brought other thoughts on testing the size of the bed and what it could support the weight of both of you. Luna only smiled as caught your scent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Before you two get started on anything,&quot; Kellie spoke up, &quot;it may do well to clean up where you had your respective transformations and your first sexual encounters. We may enjoy our pleasures... but that doesn&#39;t mean we don&#39;t like clean things.&quot;<br />
<br />
You nodded a bit more submissively, as Kellie was still Luna&#39;s mother. Being in a physical form that would make things look as though you were a group of female friends of the same age, there was still the fact that biologically, Kellie and Roxie were Luna&#39;s parents. The fact that you all looked to be roughly the same age was the fact that MILF-wolves seemed to age up until they looked like they were in their thirties to forties if they were younger than that age group or even aged down if they were older than that age group. That meant that Kellie and Roxie were still older than you and Luna, which in the back of your mind identified them as the &quot;Alphas.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, mom,&quot; Luna answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; you apologized, not knowing what else to stay.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t be sorry,&quot; Kellie answered, &quot;Roxie and I are quite happy that you and Luna were able to hit it off so well. That&#39;s bound to the two of you wanting to have more adult fun together.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And we understand that,&quot; Roxie agreed, &quot;but that doesn&#39;t change the need to keep things clean. Even Kellie and I need to keep track of these things when we have our fun inside.&quot;</p>
