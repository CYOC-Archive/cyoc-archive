<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When Alex woke up, everything seemed to be normal. He stretched his arms upwards and slapped his lips together before lifting himself up. However something bumps his head that didn&#39;t so much as hurt him, but turned him on. He opened his eyes to his blanket tenting above his head. His brand new 2&#39;6&quot; dick was under it, having grown over night from Alex&#39;s excitement. Just as he programmed the GCD to do, he and every person on the planet now had a massive fucking pole to ram into their husbands and boyfriends.<br />
<br />
<br />
Only 2% of people remembered the previous world, but it is likely this will just become another Mandela Effect situation. The other 98% of humans would find their elongated appendages normal, as this was the GCD&#39;S default setting and maximum awareness ratio. The thing is though, that Alex didn&#39;t program the machine to include him in the 2%, so there was a high chance that he wouldn&#39;t remember his previous existence. Ultimately, he fell into the majority and did not find his morning tree anything out of the ordinary.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, must of had a good dream,&quot; Alex said as he pulled his sheets away and caressed his leaking faucet. He licked the pre on his phallic head into his stomach, which was now used to sperm-bank amounts of cum, before making out with it like it was a person. He moved his hands up and down his shaft as he stuffed his mouth with head. (Aww f-fuck! Why does this feel so much better than before? Maybe it has something to do with that machine the shopkeep gave me. I don&#39;t remember using it though... eh, who knows~) he thought to himself before downing more of his meat into him. Alex rubbed his basketball-sized sacks with his thighs, squirming them like a virgin&#39;s first self-suck. He moved his left hand over to his neck to help his 3 in. girth stuff itself deeper and deeper. He massaged his bubble butt and donut hole against his soft mattress and pillows; his dick, fingers, and other substitutes currently being used for other pleasures.<br />
After 10 minutes of fucking himself, Alex finally splurged his seed all over his insides. His balls shrunk to the size of a small volleyball in the span of 20 seconds before stopping their release. He pulled his flaccid 2 feet out of him, along with a pint of loose cum. It landed on his chest and lower shaft, which, although hot, was sadly unreachable. He dried the man sauce and saliva away with his bedside towel, before finally getting out of his bed.<br />
Alex went into his wardrobe and fully dressed himself with a button-up shirt, jacket, and sandals. He pondered a bit if he wanted to wear lace underwear today, but decided against it- his middle leg needed time to cool off after all. After grooming his hair and brushing his teeth a bit in the bathroom, he went to his living room and turned on the TV. A Big Bang Theory rerun was on, something about Leonard and Patrick arguing who should top and who should bottom, nothing that Alex cared enough to keep the TV on. He looked at his clock and decided to head to work early.<br />
<br />
He passed by his neighbor, George Sanders, who was wearing a speedo that carried his yard-long dick and beachball testicals off the ground. The speedo accentuated the superior crotch enough to make Alex drool at the glance of it. George noticed this and patted his package. &quot;Hey cutie, heading off to Greensmart early? How about we take a little &#39;detour&#39; on the way?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
In the previous reality, George Sanders was in a constant state of horny. The kind of man that would have been called a slut if it was common to call boys that. He brought at least 2 girls over a week and didn&#39;t look like he&#39;d stop soon. Alex never really cared for him, only smelled him whenever he was out of his apartment and heard him whenever he and someone else were in it. His 9 inches would have definitely caught Alex&#39;s attention if he ever saw them, but sadly, that never happened.<br />
In this new reality though, Alex was one of George&#39;s main fucks. Since all women were changed into men, heterosexuality no longer existed, which meant that George&#39;s biweekly sexcapades were now directed towards men. Now, not only did room 204 smell like eyewatering sex, but the entire hallway had musk swimming around it. The only people who didn&#39;t bust a load in a minute were the ones who lived there, and even then they were a cumming mess for their first month.<br />
Luckily for them, George was as helpful as he was a sex pest. He offered nose clippings and air freshners whenever someone new came in, and after they got used to the aphrodisiacs he radiated, offered them some go&#39;s at his ass. Of course, these likable traits were in the old George, but they were never able to prosper in the past environment. Here though, George was the floor leader and a friendly face/fuck to his neighbors and landlord.<br />
<br />

Alex looked red-faced at Mr. Sanders and...</p>
