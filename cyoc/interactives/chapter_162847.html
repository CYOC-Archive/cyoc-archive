<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There were clouds everywhere, David could feel their softness between his toes. In front of him, his sister Mariah was smiling. She had the biggest grin upon her face, when suddenly light began to emit brightly beneath her, coming up through the clouds. She reached behind her back quickly and pulled out a rope. Mariah threw one end like a bolas at David and the next thing he knew he was tied up in an instant! Mariah pulled the rope towards herself, dragging the now tied up David along with it. She began to laugh, as she pulled faster and faster. The light began to engulf everything and it was becoming harder and harder to see. David tried to shove his feet into the clouds to stop the pull but there was nothing to provide grip. Within a matter of seconds he slipped over onto his back, letting out a gasp and he began to be pulled faster and closer towards his sister. Mariah yanked the rope one final time with all her strength and David flew towards her full speed, hitting her in the stomach before being pulled inside. He felt his essence merging into her flesh as he was engulfed by her fat, curvy stomach.<br />
<br />
“Hope you enjoy your new life, sis!” She laughed, her voice becoming more and more distant.<br />
<br />
 The bright light had stopped and everything was now dark. David could feel himself breathing heavily, his heart pounding fast. A consistent high pitched beeping sound from a nearby heart monitor reminded David he was in the hospital. <br />
<br />
“Just a bad dream”, he thought. David slowly opened his eyes, before blinking a few times due to the bright ceiling lights. David knew something wasn’t right... then he remembered the reason he is in the hospital in the first place. David, panicking, tried to sit up straight but found it hard to do so, his long hair flicking in front of his eyes and his body juggling in all the wrong places as he did so. Wiping his hair out his face, he took a deep, high pitched girly breath and put his now large arms to his side and slowly sat up. <br />
<br />
David now saw it had worked. He felt strain in his back now he sat up, with the cause being very visible - two huge, fleshy mounds sitting upon his chest. David pokes at them before recoiling out of disgust, hitting his head on the wall behind him. He let out a high pitched pained yelp before grabbing at his throat out of shock, noticing his higher tones in the gasp. <br />
<br />
The door opened and the doctor entered the room, “Ah, David, I thought I heard you. I see you are awake now! Glad to see everything went well, how are you feeling?” He smiled.<br />
<br />
David didn’t know how to respond, how was he feeling? What sort of question is that? He is in his sisters body! <br />
<br />
“I’m fine.” David forced out. “What happened to the machinery? Where’s Mariah?” He shyly said, still in disbelief of his new nasally and high voice.<br />
<br />
“Firstly, glad to hear you are okay!” He chucked, “Secondly, the machinery is back in the room it was left, we had to move you to a hospital bed since you did not awake as soon as we hoped so we had to monitor you. As you probably guessed from me telling you that you took so long to wake, your sister is already up and about. She is within the lobby with your mom. I’ll send them in in a second once I check your vitals.” He moved towards you and did his checkup. <br />
<br />
“Everything seems good, I’ll  send in your brother and mother now.” He smiled.<br />
<br />
“She is NOT my brother!” David growled,<br />
<br />
“Well, on the contrary, David, you ARE now in her body. Legally you are her, entirely. In fact, this whole procedure is very hush so it’s pretty illegal for anyone else to know, so you’ll have to get used to it. A start would be to stop responding to the name David” he said firmly.<br />
<br />
“Now that’s out the way, I’ll send in your mother and brother.” He said before walking out the room.<br />
<br />
David gulped hard, beginning to feel extremely emotional. He was struggling to adapt to his new bodies hormones and they were causing an overload. Tears began to flow down David’s face, and he put his hands up to wipe them. He felt his soft, large cheeks squish against his hands as he rubbed his tears, making the reality all that much real. <br />
<br />
He took a deep breath in, and released, calming himself down. David looked down at his body again, he felt very sluggish. He grabbed at his stomach, getting a handful of his new stomach. A chill went down his spine as he did so. He looked down the ends of the bed and saw his large legs under the sheet, with his fat toes sticking out the end. He wiggles his toes, noting the pink nail paint on them. <br />
<br />
He had his sisters feet, her voice, her body, he had her everything! He wondered how long this would be for and if it would be reversible, he had to ask the doctor. <br />
<br />
David continues to check out his new body, looking at his flabby arms and realising the lack of muscle in them. He felt so weak now. <br />
<br />
That’s when he came to a sudden epiphany. He pulled up the sheet, putting his head underneath and grasped at his crouch. He gasped, it was flat. His penis as gone! <br />
<br />
“No, no, no, no!” He cried. <br />
<br />
He moved his fingers down more and felt a smooth slit in between his fingers, underneath his underwear. This was the last straw, the confirmation that he really had lost his manhood. <br />
<br />
David felt his emotions begin to flair up again, before hearing the door open. He quickly pulled his head out from under the sheet and saw the Doctor and his mother enter the room smiling. Following behind her, was himself, or more correctly, his old body, with a huge grin plastered on his face!</p>
