<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The idea of wearing something that matched Luna appealed to you very much, though, there were some things that were wandering through your mind and contributed to the question you&#39;d asked. Wearing white sounded nice, and while neither you nor Luna were virgins, as Luna had wanted you to have sex with her after she became a MILF-wolf so that she would become pregnant with your child before you then became a MILF-wolf to join her. The traditional &quot;white&quot; color didn&#39;t truly fit, but then, you also figured that there were a good many people who had sex before they got married, so that wasn&#39;t the real source of your question. But that did result in your change from an 18-year-old male to an 18-year-old female who looked like she was in her thirties.<br />
<br />
While you&#39;d always felt you were truly female, you&#39;d never dressed in women&#39;s clothing before becoming a MILF-wolf and at the same time, a lot of your choices in attire were more gender neutral. Jeans and shirts were primarily what you&#39;d gotten for yourself the previous day while you and Luna got the clothing that would fit your new forms. There were a couple of dresses in there as well, but they weren&#39;t the majority of the clothes that you&#39;d acquired for you. But a wedding was something different from everyday clothes. It was supposed to be something special and was to also make Luna happy. That then had you looking to Kellie and Roxie and then to your father, as they were the ones that had experience with weddings.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure that I have a real answer for you,&quot; your father said after a moment, &quot;I would prefer you wear a white suit to match a white dress, as you would technically still be filling the male role in the wedding... But that&#39;s likely all relating to a more traditional role and the only thing that I&#39;m really familiar with.&quot;<br />
<br />
You glanced over to Kellie and Roxie, who seemed to also be trading glances to each other. That made you wonder a bit, as a lot of your question was aimed more to them as they&#39;d all had experience with weddings and Roxie and Kellie had been together as a MILF-wolf couple longer than you and Luna had been.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure we could be of any more help than your father,&quot; Roxie said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;There would be nothing wrong with wearing a dress, as you are female now, and no one could criticize you for wanting to go that route,&quot; Kellie added with one glance to your father, &quot;but we really can&#39;t say what you should wear.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you&#39;ve gotten married,&quot; you pointed out, &quot;wouldn&#39;t you have experience...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We have experience with getting married,&quot; Roxie smiled and squeezed Kellie&#39;s hand, &quot;but like your father... our wedding was also more traditional. Remember that Kellie was already pregnant with Luna when she got bit and became the first MILF-wolf. Which then means that I was still male when we got married, and when Kellie became a MILF-wolf... we really didn&#39;t know all of the effects that the MILF-wolf strain of the were-virus would cause. To an extent... I thought Kellie would just become a normal werewolf and then I&#39;d become a werewolf. Thus, becoming female and a MILF-wolf was a surprise to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You were the first?!&quot; your father gasped as he looked over to Kellie, &quot;wouldn&#39;t that have been in the news...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think it was, but by the time they would have paid attention, Rook had become Roxie and there were also desires to prevent a panic,&quot; Kellie answered, &quot;the werewolf that bit me was a bit of a klutz and was sick with some kind of cold or something, tripped on to me and accidentally bit me on the breast. Thankfully no harm came to Luna when it happened... but as Roxie said, we thought I&#39;d just become a werewolf that would be that. It was only after Rook became Roxie that we got the sense that I&#39;d become something other than a mundane werewolf.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And the registration information on us as MILF-wolves is all accessible online, for local, state, and national registries,&quot; Roxie added, &quot;it&#39;s surprising on how many people DON&#39;T pay attention to that...&quot;<br />
<br />
That was all a rehash of things you&#39;d already found out. You&#39;d followed all the news reports on MILF-wolves and what they did or were capable of doing, and that was part of what drew you to them and drew you to the conclusion that Kellie might know how to get you in contact with one. But despite the fact that the news on MILF-wolves had also included information on government responses and the registry that went with them, you&#39;d never followed that and thus never found out that Kellie was the first MILF-wolf, and that Luna was the first-born MILF-wolf as a result of Kellie being pregnant with Luna when she was bitten. Your dad followed the news too, and at times, you did remember him saying that it was a good thing that MILF-wolves had to register their identities, but you also didn&#39;t think your father had ever looked into it before as it would just be something he&#39;d ultimately be uncomfortable with.<br />
<br />
Your father sort of nodded and then sat back in his chair, thankfully not wanting to challenge Kellie or Roxie while everyone was discussing yours and Luna&#39;s wedding plans. That then let Kellie and Roxie return their attention to you.<br />
<br />
&quot;And as a man, I wore a navy-blue suit and tie, as it was the best I could afford at the time and Kellie wore a beautiful white dress... which she and Luna are now too big for,&quot; Roxie than said slowly, &quot;which was then fairly similar to the more traditional weddings your father had with your birth mother and stepmother.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And it is sad... as I did like the wedding dress that I wore,&quot; Kellie smiled to Roxie, &quot;it was nice. It made you smile as I came up the aisle... and a part of me figured we could pass it down to Luna when we learned that our child would be a girl... but once I became a MILF-wolf, my hips and bust grew quite a bit from where I was at the wedding, and it wouldn&#39;t fit me now. And after measuring you and Luna... I can also say that both of you have hips that are too wide and busts that are too big for that dress. You might squeeze into it, but it&#39;d be painfully clear that you&#39;re stretching its seams.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The joys of growing up,&quot; Luna said playfully and rubbed your arm, &quot;but a big part would be up to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Up to me?&quot; you asked back, &quot;but... a lot of this on my part is to find out what would be the right thing and what would make you happy. I mean... I&#39;ve probably loved you for who knows how long and never got up the bravery to say it until after learning you&#39;d felt the same way about me. And then you gave me the thing I&#39;ve really wanted... the chance to BE female and without having to have surgery or pills. There&#39;s got to be something I need to do to make you happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m happy just having you by my side,&quot; Luna insisted, &quot;growing up knowing that at some point I was going to turn into this...&quot; Luna paused to gesture her present form, even under the shirt and pants she was wearing, you could tell how curvy she was as a MILF-wolf, even in her human form. &quot;...it presented some point of fear and worry. As, yeah, boys liked me, and a fair number of them wanted to get in my pants all through high school, but that would have led to them becoming MILF-wolves, even if I wasn&#39;t old enough to have transformed at that point, and that carried its own stresses. Some boys ended up taking me as a bit of a downer because they felt they were all that and didn&#39;t like that I said &quot;no&quot; to them when they tried. And even a few of the girls got competitive about who they slept with.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luna then leaned forward and took your hand again to give it a firm squeeze, &quot;but you were always there. You never had an agenda like the other boys did and that made you someone I could truly be comfortable with. That&#39;s where I began to fall for you and then had to keep it quiet just to... well... wait until after I&#39;d had my transformation so that you didn&#39;t jump the gun or get too excited that would have gotten you at trouble in school. And then after I changed... you gave me something that has made me incredibly happy. Your love that in turn got me pregnant and WE can start OUR family together. What you wear to the wedding is secondary to that. No pajamas, obviously, but if you want to wear a dress or a suit... that is YOUR choice. Just so long as it matches my dress.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My choice...&quot; you said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Luna said, &quot;your choice to decide what is right for you. You are me and I&#39;m not you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She is right there,&quot; your father commented after a moment, &quot;your mother and I worked out a lot of the plans for our wedding... I took the lead with a lot of things, to show how much I loved her, but there were moments where she was involved. And your stepmom was even more involved in our wedding.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kellie and I were about equally involved,&quot; Roxie commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Which makes Luna right...&quot; Kellie commented, &quot;we can give your ideas and help with some things. But the only thing we can have any authority on is wanting you to get married... and from meeting Nickie to now, I have the sense that you do want to be with Luna. So... the rest is going to be up to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And as I said... so long as it&#39;s reasonably nice, I don&#39;t mind which you wear,&quot; Luna said to you, &quot;If you want to wear a matching white dress and heals, I&#39;ll be happy. If you&#39;d rather wear a white suit and flats, I&#39;ll be happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; you asked, probably sounding more hopeful than anything else.<br />
<br />
Luna nodded, not needing to say anything out loud.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... since I was male, and certainly played the male role in getting you pregnant,&quot; you said to her, &quot;I&#39;d think maybe to go with a white suit that would match your dress. We&#39;d still match and even with a suit, it&#39;d be pretty hard to hide that I&#39;m now female.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That might mean a bit of a ride to get suit and dress,&quot; Kellie commented, &quot;as our town is a bit small for those sorts of things with regard to even business-wear and semi-formal clothing. That&#39;ll be something to do on a weekend. Luna and I can go for the dress.&quot; Kellie then paused and looked to your father, &quot;I trust you can go with Nickie for the suit?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; your father answered, &quot;though scheduling that will also have to work around any summer jobs Luna and Nickie get... but for the moment, that&#39;d be secondary to figuring out the overall plan for the wedding.&quot;</p>
