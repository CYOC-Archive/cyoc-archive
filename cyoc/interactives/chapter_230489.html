<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Thanks, Arman. I’d like to take you up on your offer,” the “girl” says, “I’m starting to trust you, and besides I have no money to pay for my own place”. Jeff is in shock, still not understanding why he has no control over his body and what he says, unaware that he is being controlled by his little sister, though, when he thinks about it, and even though he hates the idea to live with a creepy guy who he barely knows anything about, he has to admit that going with him is, at least for the time being, the best option until he is able to pay for his own place.<br />
<br />
‘It’s not like I’ll be stuck with him 24/7,’ he thinks to himself, ‘I’ll be logging out and returning to my own reality soon… that is when I get the control over myself back! Right now, I’m not able to access the menu in order to log out’. Jeff mentally sighs, ‘if only I knew what went wrong,’ he thinks to himself, ‘I doubt that I’m being controlled by someone, since my game isn’t available in the App store. Maybe I have to finish this task, or reach a certain goal in order to log out, I might have put in the option for the game itself to control me by mistake. I’ll fix that mistake once I get out of here!’<br />
<br />
Arman smiles when he hears the “girl” accept his offer, “grate, and don’t worry, my place is big enough, you’ll have your own room and won’t have to share a bed with me!”<br />
<br />
“That is a relief,” “Vivian” says, “I’d feel so awkward if I’d have to share a bed with you”.<br />
<br />
Arman smiles, “as I said: you don’t need to worry,” the man mentally grins, ‘though you WILL share a bed with me and you’ll LOVE it,’ he thinks to himself. The man gets to his feet, “let’s go, Vivian,” he says, “my place isn’t far from here”.<br />
<br />
“Vivian” follows Arman through the streets of the small town, which, by the way, has about 100.000 residence. The “girl” looks at Arman, “I think it was a wise decision to accept your offer,” she says, “it has gotten so dark, I might have gotten harmed or something”.<br />
<br />
Arman smiles, “at least you are safe,” he says, “this may be a nice quiet town during the day, but at night… well…let’s just say: weird things tend to happen”.<br />
<br />
“That sounds… kind of mysterious,” the “girl” replies.<br />
<br />
Arman chuckles, “you seem to love mysteries,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Vivian” sheepishly rubs the back of her neck, “is that so obvious?”<br />
<br />
“Haha, it sure is,” Arman says.<br />
<br />
“By the way,” “Vivian” says, “I couldn’t help but notice, that this town has a palace, although it doesn’t appear to be the capital, so… why is there a palace?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, that is just the summer residence of the Pharao and his family,” he says, “the main residence is in Kairo, a few hundred miles from her to the north”.<br />
<br />
“Oh, I see,” the “girl” says, “when will we arrive at your place?”<br />
<br />
“We’ll be there in ten minutes,” Arman says, ‘she seems pretty hesitant and nervous, I can’t blame her, after all… I assume she never had a boyfriend, I can sense that she is still a virgin. Luckily, I have created a potion just for this, it will cause her to relax and awaken her attractiveness towards males. It also will make her fertile,’ he thinks to himself, ‘once we had sex, we’ll be bound to each other for life, I will be able to sense her and know where in the world she is’.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes of continuing to follow the man through the dark streets, “Vivian” notices that they are heading towards a medium sized two story hut made out of bricks and wood, which have been coated in mud, or some kind of clay.<br />
<br />
Arman walks towards a door on the ground level, right next to a staircase, which leads up to the second floor, “welcome to my humble home,” he says, smiling as he steps aside, “please, come in”.<br />
<br />
When “Vivian” enters the hut, she finds herself standing what appears to be the main living quarters: in the back she can make out a small kitchen, in the right hand corner there she can see a couch and two armchairs next to a small fireplace and in the middle of the room is a medium sized round table.<br />
<br />
“This is the living room and dining room,” Arman explains, “on the second floor is the guest bedroom as well as mine. So, what do you think? It’s not exactly as magnificent as a palace… but I personally like the modest atmosphere,” he chuckles.<br />
<br />
“It’s a nice home,” “Vivian” says, “it has a cozy atmosphere”.<br />
<br />
Arman smiles, “why don’t you take a seat and I’ll get us something to drink and eat,” he suggests.<br />
<br />
“Sounds good to me, I’m kind of starving,” the “girl” says.<br />
<br />
While Arman disappears into the kitchen, “Vivian” sits down at the table, ‘Arman is actually a pretty nice guy,’ Jeff thinks to himself, ‘I should really stop judging a person, just because I feel a negative vibe, as the saying goes: never judge a book by its cover’. The former teen is unaware of what Arman is doing in the kitchen, the 16-year-old-american-boy-turned-12-year-old-egyptian-girl, is unaware that her… HIS life will be drastically changing in a few moments.<br />
<br />
“What would you like to drink, Vivian,” Arman calls out of the kitchen, the kitchen is separated by a door from the rest of the room.<br />
<br />
“Well, what do you have?”<br />
<br />
“I have water, beer, milk and wine,” Arman replies.<br />
<br />
“I’ll have some water then, please,” the “girl” says.<br />
<br />
Arman pours a glass of water for Vivian and a glass of wine for himself, he then opens a cabinet and takes out a small vial filled with a transparent liquid and lets a few drops fall into the “girl’s” drink, ‘luckily the potion is plain and hasn’t got a flavor to it,’ he thinks to himself, as he uses a small spoon to steer the water. The man then grabs a pan and puts it on the stove, and takes out two steaks from the fridge and puts them into the pan, next he grabs a pot and fills it with water, setting it on the stove and adds some potatoes to it.<br />
<br />
“It already smells so delicious,” the “girl” says.<br />
<br />
Arman chuckles, “it’ll be done soon,” he says, Arman has taken off his robe, the man has short black hair, a well-trimmed beard, brown eyes, an athletic body and olive colored skin, he is about 5’6’’ tall, which causes him to be half a head taller than “Vivian” who is 5’2’’. The man grabs the drinks and walks over to the dining table, “here is your water, Vivian,” he says, setting the glass in front of her.<br />
<br />
“Thanks, Arman,” she says, taking the glass and taking a sip, “aaah… I needed that”.<br />
<br />
Arman smiles, ‘it’ll take half an hour to an hour for the potion to start taking affect,’ he thinks to himself as he makes his way back into the kitchen to check on the food. He soon returns with two stacked plates, “here you go, tuck in,” he says, smiling as he sets the plate filled with delicious food in front of the “girl”.<br />
<br />
“It smells amazing, my mouth is watering,” “Vivian” says, she doesn’t waste any time grabbing her cutlery and starting to cut the meat and potatoes, then stuffing it into her mouth, “it’s so delicious,” she says. Jeff himself is amazed, ‘wow, even if this is computer generated food, it tastes like real food,’ he thinks to himself, ‘Arman sure is a good cook’.<br />
<br />
Arman smiles, “I’m happy you like it,” he says, ‘though soon YOU will be the one who’ll does the cooking,’ he thinks to himself.<br />
<br />
As the minutes tick by, “Vivian” starts to look up from her food time to time and towards Arman, ‘Arman is such a sweet guy,’ the “girl” thinks to herself, ‘he not only offered me a place to stay, but he even shared his food and drink with me. I don’t understand why he hasn’t been able to find a woman, sure he has a creepy and mysterious vibe about him, but… he’s so kind and… handsome’. When Jeff realizes what he is thinking, he is shocked, ‘wh-what am I thinking?! I am a boy NOT a freaking girl! Why… why am I suddenly feeling attracted towards him,’ he asks himself. As he tries to come up with an explanation, images of Arman NAKED, his 5 point 6 inch erect penis in full view, at first Jeff feels disgusted, but then he finds himself wanting to taste and… feel it.<br />
<br />
Arman realizes the look on the “girl’s” face and grins inwardly, ‘the potion is starting to take effect,’ he thinks to himself, “Vivian, why don’t you take a seat by the fireplace, while I clear away the dishes and get the kitchen clean?”<br />
<br />
“No… I mean… you have done enough already,” the “girl” says, “let me do the cleaning as a way of thanking you for your hospitality”.<br />
<br />
Arman smiles, “if you insist, Vivian,” he says, ‘that is my girl,’ he thinks to himself, “while you do that, I’ll get a cozy fire going”.<br />
<br />
“Vivian” smiles, “sounds good to me,” she says, getting to her feet and grabbing the plates, glasses and cutlery from the table and heads towards the kitchen, ‘what a romantic he is,’ she thinks to herself, smiling.<br />
<br />
Arman looks after “Vivian”, staring at her butt and her form, ‘I can’t wait to get her out of that pesky dress,’ he thinks to himself, his cock already starting to erect, ‘hehe… tonight… I’ll make her mine,’ he then gets to his feet and heads over to the fireplace. After getting a fire started, Arman sits down on the couch, staring at the kitchen door, waiting for “Vivian” to return, smiling to himself as he listens to the “girl” rummaging around in the kitchen as she does what she is meant to do by nature, or rather what males in the game’s reality expect a female to do. Back in ancient times, females were the ones who stayed home, taking care of the household, cooking, cleaning and caring for the children, while the males were the ones who’d earn the money to survive.</p>
