<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Author’s note: Hello everyone. I know I had previously written that this extension of the story wouldn’t be put up for a long time. However, circumstances in my life (and probably the whole world) have changed to where I have the time now to write this. With the coronavirus ravaging the planet and forcing people to stay home, I have some free time to continue with this branch of the story. A few months ago, I laid out a tentative outline for where this next branch of the story would go. It may not follow it to the exact letter, just as the chapters of the last branch of this story did not either, but it should mirror it pretty closely. Without further ado, here is the continuation of Freddy and Michael’s adventures; this time, taking place twenty years after the events of the original story.<br />
<br />
A lot of time passed between the conclusion of Freddy and Michael’s first near death adventure. Twenty years, that past September. In that time, they graduated high school, completed college, moved in together and built a life with each other. The dream Michael had on that cold night two decades ago, vocalized while watching Fido’s lifeless body in his hands, had come true. Everything he hoped would happen if Freddy would wake up from his seemingly certain death did. It seemed like a happily ever after…except it wasn’t, especially since a second adventure was about to begin.<br />
<br />
On a particularly sunny January morning, a hustle and bustle could be seen in Freddy and Michael’s home. They had bought a house in their old neighborhood ten years earlier, though it wasn’t one that either of them had grown up in. Instead, it belonged to an elderly man who was retiring to Nevada and sold it to them at a below market rate. It needed some work, which Michael had overseen, but it was equipped with the latest technology and had a classic American aesthetic, one that suited the older home nicely. With all the work he had put in, Michael was happy to call this house a home. He just wished it felt like it more often than it did.<br />
<br />
Sitting over a cup of coffee, Michael stared at the liquid before him. He sat alone at the table, wearing a worn, blue robe, ruminating in his thoughts. He had a lot of his mind lately. He didn’t have to work at an office, like Freddy did, but he was still incredibly busy nonetheless. He pondered over the chores around the house that needed to be done, errands that had to be run, appointments that he hadn&#39;t yet scheduled. Of all of the things on his mind, the one that he couldn’t stop thinking about was his current situation with Freddy.<br />
<br />
Freddy wasn’t home as much as Michael wished he had been. Years ago, he promised Freddy that he would let go of his proverbial leash and let him live a little. In this quiet moment alone at an early morning hour, Michael wondered if that turned out to be a mistake. Freddy worked as a public defender, which didn’t pay very much, but made him happy. Freddy always had a knack for wanting to help people, but Michael felt that it came at the cost of their relationship. He felt that Freddy spent too much time with others and not enough time with him.<br />
<br />
“I wish Freddy was home more” Michael thought to himself, as he sighed, before taking a big sip of coffee. <br />
<br />
Just as he drank it, he could hear footsteps coming down the stairs. Soon after, Freddy, dressed in a grey suit and a well ironed dress shirt with a bright tie hanging down, entered the kitchen. He looked very handsome, even though he no longer had boyish good looks. He was a man now, with some age apparent in his facial features, but Michael thought it made him look manly. Manlier then himself, in his estimation.<br />
<br />
“Morning Michael” Freddy said, with a wide smile on his face. <br />
<br />
Freddy walked over to Michael and kissed him on the cheek. Michael did not reciprocate. <br />
<br />
“Morning Freddy” Michael replied quietly, before he drank the last sip of coffee in his cup.<br />
<br />
“Something wrong?” Freddy asked, as he poured himself a cup. “You’re unusually quiet this morning. Up earlier than usual, too.”<br />
<br />
“I know. I just didn’t get a good night’s sleep last night and I guess I just woke up. Figured I’d make some coffee.”<br />
<br />
“I appreciate that.”<br />
<br />
Freddy sat down and drank from the cup, staring at Michael while trying to read him. Michael wasn’t happy and Freddy could tell this immediately. As they got to know each other over the years, Freddy became very good at reading Michael’s emotions. He could tell by his voice, his facial expression and his posture what mood he was in. In this dejected pose, with the occasional wistful sigh, Freddy knew that Michael was upset about something. He didn’t have a lot of time to talk about what it was that was bothering him, but he figured he should try to pry as much as he could while he could.<br />
<br />
“I know you too well, Michael. I know when you’re upset. Talk to me. Tell me what’s wrong.”<br />
<br />
Michael was silent for a moment, noticing Freddy staring at him intensely. After a brief silence, Michael sighed and then spoke up. <br />
<br />
“I’ve just been thinking about how you’re not really around enough. I know your job keeps you busy and all, but I just feel like you don’t have enough time for me anymore.”<br />
<br />
“Oh Michael.”<br />
<br />
“It’s true, Freddy, and I’m not the only one who feels this way.”<br />
<br />
Just as Michael had finished expressing this thought, a quieter noise could be heard from the staircase. A moment later, a young boy, who notably did not look like either Freddy or Michael, stood before them in the doorway to the kitchen.<br />
<br />
“Morning dad” the boy said. “Morning papa.”<br />
<br />
“Morning Evan” Freddy replied brightly. <br />
<br />
“Morning Evan” Michael added, getting up to grab some toast from the counter. “I’ll fix you up some breakfast before you go to school today.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks dad” Evan replied. <br />
<br />
“Freddy?” Michael asked, as he put the toast in a pop up toaster. “Would you mind taking Evan to school today?”<br />
<br />
“I have to get going soon and Evan’s school is nowhere near where I work” Freddy replied. <br />
<br />
“Come on papa” Evan said, as he sat himself down at the table. “You almost never take me to school anymore. In fact, you barely spend any time with me as it is.”<br />
<br />
“Evan” Freddy replied sheepishly. <br />
<br />
“He’s right, Freddy” Michael added. “When’s the last time you bothered taking him to school?”<br />
<br />
Freddy thought for a moment, before he looked down at his coffee. <br />
<br />
“I guess it’s been a while, huh?” Freddy replied, feeling a bit embarrassed. <br />
<br />
“Come on papa” Evan insisted. “Please take me to school today.”<br />
<br />
“I have to get going.”<br />
<br />
Freddy quickly finished his coffee, before getting up and making his way to the front door. <br />
<br />
“Papa?” Evan asked. “Don’t you want to spend time with me anymore?”<br />
<br />
Freddy grabbed his coat, before he looked back at Evan.<br />
<br />
“I’ll make time for you this weekend” he replied. “I promise.”<br />
<br />
“Papa, I’m not going to be home this weekend. Remember?”<br />
<br />
Freddy thought for a moment, before Michael had to interject. <br />
<br />
“His friend Corey’s sleepover party. Remember?”<br />
<br />
Even though he hadn’t remembered this, Freddy replied in the affirmative. <br />
<br />
“How about next weekend?” Freddy asked, hoping to ease the situation.<br />
<br />
“How about tonight?” Evan asked. “I won’t be leaving until tomorrow afternoon.”<br />
<br />
“I’m probably going to be home late tonight, kiddo. How about next weekend?”<br />
<br />
Evan sighed, before Freddy went back into the kitchen to give him a kiss on the forehead. Evan recoiled at this display of affection, which Freddy took note of. A kiss on Michael’s lips was given a better reception, but not noticeably so. <br />
<br />
“I’ll see you guys later tonight” Freddy said, as he exited the kitchen, went out the front door and quickly headed to his car in the driveway. <br />
<br />
“Dad?” Evan asked, as he watched Michael place two pieces of slightly burnt toast on a plate to give him. “When do you think papa is going to give us the time and attention we deserve?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know” Michael replied sadly, as he sat down and looked at his son, a slight tear forming from his right eye. “But you should hurry up and eat so I can take you to school. You don’t want to be late.”<br />
<br />
Evan nodded and quickly ate the toast, before he went and grabbed his backpack and other school supplies. Michael took this opportunity to get dressed so he at least looked presentable to the other parents. When they were both ready to go, they headed out the front door and into Michael’s car. <br />
<br />
Driving Evan to school, which Michael had become accustomed to, being that he was a stay at home dad, he thought about what his life had become. While Freddy was out and about fulfilling his passions, he was stuck in a situation with no ambition or fun. Although he loved his son dearly and cherished the time they spent together, Michael felt he was entitled to be able to have a life of his own. Though Freddy never shared in the parenting duties up until this point, Michael felt it was about time that he should be a more present parent. More importantly, Michael felt that Freddy needed to be home more. Unlike his dreams from years past, however, this was not one that would come true anytime soon.<br />
<br />
Later in the day…..</p>
