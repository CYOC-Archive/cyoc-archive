<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>Some days Lorna Williams just wished she was an average girl.  She enjoyed being a cheerleader.  Working with others with rhythm in time to the music all while sharing the same school pride was enough to not call into school sick somedays.  Teachers saw students who showed off true school spirit as a rare and powerful tool for getting things done by the students and the community, and Lorna was happy to serve her part.</p>

<p>But some days... some days like today... every one from Darrell Jackson to Coach Hanson to the sleazy truckers at the local gas station would make flirtatious remarks in her direction, stare at her chest instead of her eyes, and even wolf whistle (or try to, anyway).  Wether it be trying to look under her shirk, cop a feel, or stand between her and her departure from her locker in the hallway all while leaning his crotch into her, Darrell was the worst.  They all made her feel uncomfortable for her appearance, but it was always Darrell who took things to the next level.</p>

<p>Regardless of her wishes, most men thought she was the most attractive girl on the squad if not the school.  She wasn't head cheerleader, and she made no advances towards just about anyone, so she really didn't understand all the attention.  She considered herself an average student, and no one special, but she was always on defense from the advances of not just the school, but men all over.</p>

<p>Young Lorna Williams didn't give enough credit to her bust size, though, which is where trouble came to find her.  Even at eighteen and a Senior, it surprised some that she didn't already have back problems.  Maybe that was due to keeping in shape for cheerleading, who knew.  Maybe it was due to her mother's size being larger than her own 30G that put her in the wrong mindset.</p>

<p>Lorna stepped up to the front counter of the Kangaroo Mart for the BP up the street from her neighborhood.  She sighed as she looked back to Mel at the counter who she'd once again caught staring at her in the security camera.  She placed two twelve-packs on the counter, one of Mountain Dew, one of Pepsi Max, and reached to her purse for twenty dollar bill.  She laid it and the four different varieties of Combos snacks on the counter and slid them close to Mel.</p>

<p>"Not watching your figure?" Mel smirked, as he rang up the first twelve pack.</p>

<p>"They's just Combos," Lorna said, her look exasperated and worn.  Her red curls feel around her deep brown face.  Her green eyes stared at him as she waited for him to realize he was staring down at her black top partly covered by her blue jean jacket.</p>

<p>She fixed one of the straps of her red backpack, tapping her black sneakers on the floor as she put her other hand in the pocket of her torn jean panks.  He looked up, and grinned, not caring that she'd caught him staring at her chest.  "Long day?" he asked as he rank up the second twelve pack.</p>

<p>"Yeah.  First Game of the year is next week, and we're supposed to be ready," she shrugged, inadvertently giving her breasts a bit of a bounce as she did so.  <i>Go ahead and stare,</i> she thought after she realized what she'd done, <i>You always do.</i></p>

<p>Mel looked her over again as he rang up one set of Combos and hit the keys to ring it up four times.  "Time to clean up and go out with your boi?" Mel smirked, his flat black hair against his fat face made Lorna a little queasy.</p>

<p>"Thad and I've broke up for months," she said, waiting on her total, thinking Mel was taking exceptionally with so few items.  "I've got betta things ta do with my time," she added.</p>

<p>Mel paused on the total key, and looked over at her.  She was single, so in Mel's mind, that meant he had a chance.  He ran a hand through his beard and asked, "Like what?" he wondered.</p>

<p>She sighed, knowing he would wait for her to answer.  "An MMO," she said.</p>

<p>"Oh, I bet it's that new one, right?  Fuck, or whatever?"</p>

<p>She sighed, hearing his emphasis, "P. H. U. K.," she said, "And yeah, I play.  I got me an 80 already and thinking of tryin' somethin' new.  I'd really like to get home to it, either way," she said, waving a hand at the few items she'd bought.</p>

<p>"Right, Fuck," Mel smirked, handing Lorna her receipt and change.  "I play it too," he said.  She stared at him a moment, but turned to head out the door.  As she placed a hand on it, the bell ringing as it slightly opened, Mel asked, "You know they got hacked today, right?"</p>

<p>"Hacked?" she stopped and looked back at him.  "What hack?"</p>

<p>"People's accounts tied to the wrong characters.  Lots of players up in arms, lots of people running around as people they're not," he smirked,  "Maybe I'll see you," he smirked.  "Bet you got a masterful gaming rig," he said, moving his eyebrows.</p>

<p>"Masterful enough," she said, departing the Kangaroo and turning to head up the street towards her neighborhood.  Not the nicest part of town... well, OK, it was just about the worst part of town, really.  Still, with her dad trying to make things up to her and her mom, maybe he'd ask them to move into his nice new house.  <i>I'd love to turn him down,</i> she thought, <i>prick.</i></p>

<p>It took Lorna only fifteen minutes to make the trip all the way to the apartments where she lived.  She made her way in through the partway unbolted downstairs door and up the stairs to apartment 230.  She fiddled with her keys for a moment, fishing them out as she thought about what an ending to what a day this would be.</p>

<p><i>Darrell, the Coach, and all the rest all day long,</i> she thought.  <i>Now I'm gunna go in here, log on, and find myself lacking in anything interesting to play 'cause my characters'll all be gone,</i> she sighed as she turned the lock and kicked the door lightly to loosen it from where it had been wedged in the doorway.</p>

<p>Closing the door behind her and locking both the bolt locks, she made her way into the last room at the back.  It smelled the nicest of all the rooms due to her little lavender air freshener at one of the wall sockets.  She took in it's scent as she laid down her backpack and pulled out her 17" MacBook Pro, hooking up the 24" LED Cinema Monitor on her desk, plugging in her USB Mouse and Keyboard, and hitting the power button on the Laptop.</p>

<p>"Get's the job done," she said to herself, admiring her father's attempts at pampering her with expensive gifts.  Whatever his new job was, he made a good deal of money with it.  She didn't know, and she didn't want to ask, but being able to have IM's and web FAQ's open on the laptop screen while playing PHUK in full screen on the other was too good to pass up even for her stance against him and all he stood for.</p>

<p>As Lorna opened PHUK on one screen, she pulled open her G-Mail to check for anything new.  Sure enough, there was a mail from her father sitting there just like every other day.  She sighed to herself and clicked on it.</p>

<p>"To: My loving daughter," she almost gagged, "I thought I would let you know that your Birthday is coming a bit early this year.  That one thing you said you wanted should be arriving today or tomorrow.  If today, around 7PM.  If tomorrow, then probably while you are at school.  I hope you like it, and I can't wait to see you this weekend."</p>

<p>Lorna stared at the screen for a moment, thinking that over.  She had made a point not to make such comments around the lowlife.  When she said she wanted the MacBook to help with her artwork, he bought her the biggest and fastest she could find.  Then she commented how a second monitor with mouse and keyboard would work even better, along with a Wacom tablet, and he complied... but she didn't want him to act like she owed him anything, so she'd gone out of her way to keep thing to herself.</p>

<p>Her eyes went wide as she realized what it must be.  He'd walked in on a conversation she'd had with her mother, Kamaria, when being asked about her birthday.  Lorna had said the one thing she wanted, mom couldn't afford and to not worry about it.  <i>There's no way he spent money on something that expensive... no way he got a Total Emersion Unit for PHUK.</i>  Such a suit would allow her to live and breath the game, completely immersive (as the name implied)...</p>

<i>He might could buy my love,</i> she blinked, thinking it over.  Just then, there was a knock at the door.  Lorna glanced to the time in her titlebar and it displayed as "7:34AM" with it's little blinking colons.  <i>Could that be it?</i> She wondered.  FedEx always had trouble finding the right apartment... it could have taken him this long.</p></p>
