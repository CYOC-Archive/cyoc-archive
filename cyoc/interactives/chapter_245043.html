<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"> The next day, while the boys do their own thing, Ken is strolling through the convention center, enjoying the stares and comments he receives from his fellow furs about his “costume”, by now, Jeff has accepted his fate and gave up pleading with Ken to transform him back, instead the teen just remains quiet, ignoring Ken’s stupid comments like, “good costume”, and “I knew you’d enjoy being a costume sooner or later”, however, Jeff is NOT enjoying being a costume, he hates it, just as much as he hate his former friend.<br />
<br />
Unaware to Ken, someone has HIS eyes on him, that someone is a male lizard with an athletic body covered in dark-blue scales with white spots, making it look like a clear starry night sky. However, unlike Ken, HE is not wearing a costume, the lizard, now known as “Razor”, a few weeks ago had been a 25-year-old man who decided to become his persona for real.<br />
<br />
Razor always had a mental issue, thinking that the world should be ruled by reptiles and not humans, deciding that HE will be the king, but before he focuses on taking over the world, he had decided to first find the perfect female who’d be his queen and birth his children. When Razor noticed the “female” lizard, he immediately decided that she is the one, ‘her costume is amazing,’ he thinks to himself as he watches Ken, unaware that the wearer is a male, ‘she’ll make a perfect queen and mother. I got to get to know her, and see if my pheromones affect her, if she’s taken by some silly human, she won’t be affected. Should she not react to my pheromones… I’ll STILL make her mine! Once that’s settled, I’ll use my powers to make her costume her true body by merging it with her weak human body, then the next phase of my plan can begin’.<br />
<br />
The male lizard continues to follow Ken around, keeping his distance to not make it to obvious that he’s following her, ‘I must say, whoever made that costume of hers sure did one hell of an amazing job,’ Razor thinks to himself, ‘it looks so realistic, it almost fooled me, but thanks to my new senses I could tell that it’s just a simple costume… hehe… not for long though… soon it will be her new and improved body!’<br />
<br />
Razor continues to follow Ken, waiting for the perfect opportunity to start a conversation, that opportunity comes when Ken decides to take a break and sit down on a leather couch in the convention center, which also is the hotel he and the boys are staying in. The lizard-man smiles, ‘this is my chance,’ he thinks to himself, ‘not many are around, no one will pay us any attention’. Razor slowly approaches Ken, already sending out his pheromones, “hey beautiful, sorry for disturbing you,” he says, “but I really do like your costume, and I was wondering if you’d mind me joining you”.<br />
<br />
Ken looks up to see the male standing before him, ‘I’ll have some fun with this guy,’ he thinks to himself, “sure, I honestly would enjoy some company,” he says, moving over a little to give the male more room.<br />
<br />
Razor smiles, “thanks, my name’s Razor,” he says as he sits down next to Ken.<br />
<br />
“Selena,” Ken says, “it is a pleasure meeting you, Razor, and what a cool name, it really suits you”.<br />
<br />
Razor smiles, “thanks, you’re name is just as beautiful as you are,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Aaaw, why thank you,” Ken says, staying in character, “I would say how cool your costume looks, IF it were a costume!”<br />
<br />
Razor blinks, “what do you mean?”<br />
<br />
Ken grins under the mask of his “costume”, “you can’t fool me, Razor,” he says, lowering his voice, “your eyes… they are to real and your scales, unlike mine, do not look artificial”.<br />
<br />
Razor chuckles, “alright, you caught me,” he says, “yes, this is my real appearance, you are one smart female, I like that”.<br />
<br />
Ken chuckles, “thanks,” he says, “let me guess, you used the Chronivac to transform yourself?”<br />
<br />
Razor widens his eyes, “you know about that program?”<br />
<br />
Ken nods, “I sure do,” he says, “a… friend of mine… well… former friend to be exact, he owned the program. When I visited him a week ago, I discovered it and used it on myself, but I haven’t transformed myself into a lizard”.<br />
<br />
“I can tell, what did you do?”<br />
<br />
“I gave myself transformation powers,” Ken says, “I’m able to change anything and anyone by simply suggestions, I’m able to control the body of a target and alter the reality”.<br />
<br />
“Super cool,” Razor says, ‘I’m liking her more and more,’ he thinks to himself.<br />
<br />
Ken nods, “I used my new powers on my former friend,” he says, “by transforming him into this costume, which, I think, is what he always should have been”.<br />
<br />
Razor grins, “yeah, I can sense that he is now what he always should have been,” he says, “I assume you are using your powers to correct any error you come across?”<br />
<br />
Ken nods, “yup, it makes me feel good when I am able to show someone their true purpose,” he says, “my costume still has its human mind, but it has stopped whining around, I guess it finally got used to being its true form”.<br />
<br />
Razor smiles, “that’s great”.<br />
<br />
“What about you, why transform into a lizard?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, all my life I felt that my human body was wrong, I hated being human,” Razor says, “I personally believe the world should be ruled by us reptiles, and I see myself as the savior and ruler of this planet”.<br />
<br />
“That would really be amazing,” Ken says, “I hope you’ll find the perfect female to become your queen. You sure are one handsome hunk of a lizard, you defiantly look like a king!”<br />
<br />
Razor smiles wide and wags his tail, “aaaw, thank you,” he says, “and you are one stunning female, Selena,” he says, ‘she seems to be affected by my pheromones, or else she wouldn’t have said that I’m handsome. All I need to do now is officially make her mine,’ he thinks to himself, “are you here by yourself,” he then asks.<br />
<br />
Ken, unaware of the danger he is in, shakes his head, “nope, I’m here with my little brother Tyler and six of his friends, Jay, Lars, Hikaru, Arthur, James and Max, all of which I have transformed into anthros,” he says, “Tyler is a fox, Max is a Malinois, Arthur is a wolf, Lars is a tiger, Hikaru is a dragon, Jay is a Blue Jay and James is a red panda”.<br />
<br />
“Aaaw, hehe… I bet they look adorable,” Razor says, ‘and they’d be perfect to become OUR kids, or at least one of them,’ he thinks to himself, ‘let’s get to work,’ his eyes then suddenly glow in a blue color.<br />
<br />
“Razor… your eyes,” Ken says, “why are they glo…,” he is unable to continue as Razor’s hypnotic stare overtakes him.<br />
<br />
Razor grins when he realizes “Selena” being taken over by his hypnosis, “alright, now, you will forget everything about your past life,” he says, “your name is and always has been “Selena”, you have always been a female lizard. We have been a couple for a month and are planning to have children, you want to be a mother so badly, you’ve also agreed to be my queen and rule the world with me as your king and husband, both of us using our powers to help everyone find their true purpose”.<br />
<br />
“Y-yes,” Ken, now Selena, says.<br />
<br />
Razor smiles, “your costume will merge with your body, becoming you permanent true form,” he continues, “the mind of your former friend will be locked away in a mental cage in your mind, unable to break free and he’ll never be able to communicate with you, and you will forget he had ever existed. Once the merging is complete, you’ll awake from your trance and will have forgotten what we have talked about before, instead you’ll ask me to return to your, now OUR, room for some private… fun”.<br />
<br />
Selena starts to moan in pleasure as his costume slowly merges with his human body, his face pushing out and filling out the muzzle, his tailbone lengthens, filling out the tail, his cock and balls shrinking back into his body and a womb forms in his, now her, tummy.<br />
<br />
While this is going on, Razor uses his powers to alter the reality, making everyone who knew Ken, think he had always been a female lizard.<br />
<br />
Selena blinks once the merging is complete and she awakens from the trance, “s-sorry, hun,” she says, looking up at Razor, “I kinda zoned out there for a second”.<br />
<br />
Razor smiles, “no worries,” he says, “why don’t we get back to our room and have some… fun,” he suggests.<br />
<br />
Selena smiles, wagging her tail, “that sounds like a great idea,” she says, “I feel so horny, I hope I’ll finally fall pregnant!”<br />
<br />
Razor grins as they get to their feet and start heading towards the elevator, hand in hand, ‘oh, you WILL become pregnant,’ he thinks to himself, ‘either with your little brother OR one of his friends… or two… hehe!’</p>
