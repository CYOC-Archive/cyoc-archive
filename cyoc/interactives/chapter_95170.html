<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I&#39;d like to lose some weight!&quot; Another larger man called from the front of the crowd. Madame Illusia beckoned him forward, and the man made his way onto the stage. As he heaved his way up the steps, the crowd gasped - he was larger than Paul had been, larger than Ryan, even. Madame Illusia seemed a little taken aback, but cleared her throat and turned to the man. &quot;What is your name?&quot; &quot;Steve.&quot; The man muttered. &quot;Well, Steve, let&#39;s see what we can do.&quot; Madame Illusia smiled. &quot;Now, who wants to gain some weight?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryan&#39;s massive gut suddenly growled, and without thinking, he stood up. &quot;I&#39;d like some more!&quot; He called. The crowd murmured as his friends whooped and hollered, and Ryan lumbered his way back up onto the stage. &quot;Well, this is unexpected...&quot; Madame Illusia muttered. &quot;But very well! Stand next to each other, and let&#39;s get a look at you two.&quot; Steve took off his shirt and stepped forward to stand next to Ryan. The two men were massively huge and hairy, but Steve was definitely more fat than muscle. Ryan&#39;s thick frame looked far more solid than Steve&#39;s saggier, flabbier body, which was already slick with sweat from his climb up the stairs. Madame Illusia let the crowd compare the two for a few seconds before speaking up. &quot;Now, we already know how much Ryan weighs--&quot; &quot;296!&quot; One of Ryan&#39;s friends called. &quot;Yes, that.&quot; Madame Illusia muttered. &quot;Let&#39;s see how much Steve weighs!&quot; She beckoned for Steve to step onto the scale, which spun much further than it had before. &quot;425!&quot; Stephan called. <br />
<br />
The crowd began murmuring again as Steve stepped off the scale, then walked over to stand back-to-back with Ryan. Once the two men were touching, Madame Illusia raised her hands, and their bodies froze. Once again, Ryan felt a link form between his body and the larger man&#39;s as Madame Illusia began chanting, the strange smoke swirling around the men&#39;s bodies. Ever so slowly, Ryan&#39;s already large gut began to swell even bigger, his massive chest seemed to get a little bit softer, his heavy body got a little bit heavier. Steve, on the other hand, could feel his massive body lighten slightly, his gut growing just a little smaller, his arms and legs thinning as his mass was pulled into Ryan&#39;s body. <br />
<br />
The changes became more apparent as the weight transfer sped up, Madame Illusia chanting faster and waving her hands rhythmically as the two men changed size. Ryan&#39;s body was growing warmer and heavier by the second. His legs were aching from the effort of holding up his increasingly massive body, even as they swelled and thickened. His arms were pushed out to the sides as his belly grew outwards and upwards, his chest swelling and stretching before the crowd&#39;s eyes as his arms inflated with thick, heavy fat. Ryan felt his shoulders droop slightly as even more weight was piled onto them, his thick neck gradually disappearing beneath the ring of fat that was forming beneath his double chins.<br />
<br />
Steve, meanwhile, felt lighter than he had in years. His belly was rapidly withdrawing, the pain in his legs fading as the weight was pulled off of them and into Ryan. Steve looked down to see his chest shrinking, his flabby moobs deflating, hardening ever so slightly as some of his fat was converted to muscle. As the crowd watched, Steve&#39;s weight loss seemed to slow, although Madame Illusia was still chanting at her normal speed, and Ryan was still growing at a steady pace. There were gasps and hollers as the crowd realised that Steve was growing more muscular, his excessive flab shrinking and redistributing throughout his increasingly smaller and fit body. Definition returned to his flatter gut, his thinner arms, his legs, his chest, muscles he hadn&#39;t seen in years appearing before the crowd&#39;s eyes. He was still massive, but much less so, and much more muscular.<br />
<br />
Madame Illusia, pleased with the transformation, began lowering her hands. Once again, Ryan felt his weight gain increase ever so slightly, his massive belly bowing out further, his chest growing flabbier, his legs growing thicker. His thighs had pressed together before, but now there was no gap at all. His body was heavier, larger, more imposing than ever. Steve was now much smaller, much more fit, although still massive. His gut was now just a slight bulge below his massive chest, his face was younger, more full of life. The two men felt the bond between them dissapate, and their paralyzed bodies sagged, Ryan&#39;s much more than Steve&#39;s.<br />
<br />
Madame Illusia stepped forward. &quot;Now, show us your new selves!&quot; She cried. The two men stepped away from each other and turned to the crowd. As Ryan turned, the crowd gasped - he had been big before, but now he was positively massive. Any muscle definition he&#39;d had was now gone, smothered beneath the mammoth hairy gut which dominated his huge frame. His chest was soft and flabby, his shoulders were much wider, his arms far thicker. His face suited his larger body, wide, full and fat, his thick beard cascading down his triple chins and flabby chest, his brow stronger, more imposing. Unlike last time, it was obvious that this transfer had only added fat to Ryan&#39;s frame.<br />
<br />
Steve, on the other hand, was the epitome of power. His body rippled with thick muscle, supplemented by a small, but decent muscle-gut which only added to his imposing stature. He resembled a body-builder, or a weight-lifter, with real power behind his thick frame. Like Paul, he even looked slightly younger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Once again, it&#39;s time to weigh you!&quot; Madame Illusia said. &quot;Steve, if you would.&quot; Steve turned and walked to the scale, his body bouncing ever so slightly as he lumbered across the stage. He stepped onto the scale.<br />
<br />
&quot;240!&quot; Stephan yelled. Steve stepped off the scale, and Ryan made his way over. His body jiggled and wobbled with every footfall, the stage shaking beneath the heavy booms off his feet. The scale creaked as he stepped onto it, and the crowd watched the reading intently as it stopped on...<br />
<br />
&quot;481!&quot; Stephan cried. Ryan gasped, and the crowd began yelling, Ryan&#39;s friends hollering the loudest. He stepped off the scale slowly and waddled back over to Steve and Madame Illusia. They waited until the crowd calmed down, then Madame Illusia whispered to Steve and Stephan escorted the two off the stage. <br />
<br />
The crowd parted for Ryan as he lumbered forward, making his way back to his friends, who simply stared, slack-jawed, at his massively flabby body. Once again, they poked and prodded his stomach, their fingers sinking further into the soft flesh than they had before, and Ryan ran his own meaty hands over his overblown gut, grabbing and shaking the rolls and folds experimentally, feeling the motions travel through his entire fat form.<br />
<br />
&quot;I believe we have time for one more transfer!&quot; Madame Illusia announced.</p>
