<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A week went by in a flash. While your father studied names, faces and good-to-know facts about his new friend group, you studied your new co-workers. You were not happy about this. What made it worse was that your father always had an expression of glee upon his face. He was clearly excited about going to school and to start his new life as you. You had been angry and sad the whole week and your father&#39;s joy was not helping.<br />
<br />
Today was no different, he kept asking question upon question and quite a lot of them were now about girls. If &#39;he&#39; was a thing with anyone or if there were any girls at school &#39;he&#39; had more of a connection with. You didn&#39;t really want to answer - but &quot;luckily&quot; there was none. There were girls you found cute. There was a girl in your math class you had a huge crush on, but your only interaction with her had been totally awkward and since then you had been to embarrassed to talk to her. Now you were regretting the fact you hadn&#39;t tried talking to her more, because now, getting any action from a girl seemed like a pipe dream. Instead your father was going to try his best to live out that dream, it seemed. At least based on the nature of the questions he&#39;d been asking today.<br />
<br />
You asked your father if he didn&#39;t find it weird to be asking about 16 year old girls in that way. He was a grown man after all. They were young enough to be his daughters. With a smug face, your father answered &quot;I&#39;m 16 years old, DAD! how could I have a 16 year old daughter. It&#39;s only natural a young man like me would be interested in girls MY age.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your father was clearly taking this in stride and during the week he had LOVED to keep reminding you he was young and you were not. He had in the last few days also started to call you &#39;dad&#39; a lot. Your mother was in the room with you, but had more or less fazed you two out. Probably so she wouldn&#39;t have to listen to her husband gloating about being young again nor having him call her &#39;mom&#39;. That also started around the same time he started calling you dad. You could tell your mother had been upset the first few times. His joyful expression when calling you &#39;dad&#39; and calling his wife &#39;mom&#39; did not make things easier to swallow. But now, she didn&#39;t even react to the conversation you were having. You wondered what your mother was thinking about as she just stared into nothingness.<br />
<br />
You were also pretty sure your father had been masturbating daily. He kept looking himself into his room and he was going through an alarming rate of napkins. You had, since the last session, kept your hands to yourself for the week. Your mother sleeping in the same room helped because that made it harder to get any alone time. You did, unlike your father, not want to get to accustomed to the flesh you were inhabiting too fast. Kind of like a final act of defiance. But sometimes you caught yourself thinking &#39;MY body&#39; rather than your father&#39;s. The first night of masturbation in this body still fresh in your mind. The thoughts you had then, about this being you. You were fighting those thoughts with all your might but it was clearly not enough. Of course, the fact of the matter was that this was you. What&#39;s worse was that you kept waking up with a raging boner. One that seemed to get more and more painful for each passing day. You knew you were going to have to jerk off again. But wanking of your father&#39;s penis was a thought you did not enjoy, as long as you were clear of mind. Like you were right now. But the nights were a different story. You then often found yourself thinking about the penis between the legs as instinctively yours, just as the first night. <br />
<br />
You must have looked sad while having these thoughts run through your head, because your father asked &quot;Hey dad, why do you look so down?&quot; with that smug expression on his face. He looked over at your mother to see if she was listening. She wasn&#39;t. &quot;I think you know why I look sad&quot; you said with anger in your voice. &quot;So can you get off it, for once?&quot; you added. &quot;Jeez, dad, no need to get so upset&quot; he said, looking annoyed. Like you were the villain in the story, not him. &quot;Is this because I&#39;m talking about girls? Are you jealous of your son? You have my mom, no need to be so mad about it. I bet MY friends thinks she&#39;s a total bbw milf.&quot; he said, with a surprisingly serious face replacing his otherwise smug one. Your mother still not listening, thankfully. <br />
<br />
What a thing to say to you. Especially considering the fact he clearly enjoyed roleplaying the son. Calling &#39;his mom&#39; a bbw milf? How much porn had he consumed this last week? But even worse, he was right! Your friends loved to comment on how your mother was a milf, even thought she&#39;s fat. You used to get mad about it but that only made them tease you more with similar comments about your mother. The best thing had been calling their moms milfs back at them. You felt the same anger as you used to do then. But this time it&#39;d be really hard to say &quot;well, your mom is a milf too&quot; because you&#39;d speak about the same woman and it would just fan the flames of your dad&#39;s little roleplay. So all you mustered was an annoyed &quot;shut up&quot; as you sulked.<br />
<br />
Now your mother had apparently heard some of your conversation because she said with a confounded look on her face &quot;What is a be-be-double-ue milf? Why would David&#39;s friend think I am one?&quot; while looking at your father. Of all the things she&#39;d pick up from your conversation, it was that? Your father answered a little too fast. &quot;Well, it means MY friends think you&#39;re a mom-i&#39;d-like-to-fuck. They think you&#39;re hot.&quot; your father said with an almost proud expression on his face. Your mother blushed and nudged you. &quot;Did his friends... your friends really say that? she asked. She was slipping into your dad&#39;s twisted roleplay but had caught herself. &quot;Uh... Yeah...&quot; You said looking down, trying to hide your embarrassment. Your mother blushed even harder and got quiet as she slowly made her way out of the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, mom! It&#39;s a good thing&quot; your father shouted after her. With that you decided to call it quits for today. You went upstairs and made yourself ready for bed. Tomorrow you&#39;d start working. Tomorrow dad would go to school. Tomorrow, you were going to be &#39;Steve&#39; and your father was going to be &#39;David&#39;. It felt awful knowing reality was about to hit you hard in the face. <br />
<br />
You went into the bathroom to brush your teeth. You looked yourself in the mirror. Your father looking back. You got undressed and had another look. Your fat, hairy father looking back at you. You looked down at the gut protruding into view. Your gut. It was getting harder and harder to not look down and think about this body as you. You looked down at the penis dangling between your legs. Filled with half disgust having to look at your father&#39;s dick and half pride about the thickness of YOUR penis. It was going to be a weird life and you weren&#39;t too excited about the idea that the feeling of disgust would fade and your self-image would be completely replaced by the one in the mirror. You were still seeing your father looking back at you, but that feeling was diminishing by the day.</p>
