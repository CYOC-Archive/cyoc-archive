<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Declan Theodore Hall was not a nice boy. Often times he would lie, cheat and steal and despite the many spankings he got from his pa, never seemed to learn his lesson. His pa tried the best he could but didn&#39;t have much time or money to spend with Declan what with his factory job at AlterTech Inc.<br />
<br />
One day Declan saw a group of boys in Kindergarten cicled around scribbling on papers at recess. He walked up to them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why are yous doing school work at recess?&quot; Declan scoffed &quot;Yous like school that much?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not school work, We&#39;re writin&#39; to Santa!&quot; explained one of the boys &quot;We&#39;re changin&#39; our letters so we&#39;s don&#39;t all get the same toys and can share!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who&#39;s Santa?&quot; Declan asked.<br />
<br />
The boys looked at him like he was an alien and explained all about the jolly fat man who delivered toys to boys and girls around the world.<br />
<br />
Declan was confused but wrote a list of things he wanted and stuck it in the postbox just to be safe. Over the next few weeks he went on a search to find out everything he could about Santa, he read stories, watched movies and interrogated other kids for information. He was furious that his pa had never said anything and decided to question him about it. On Christmas Eve, Declan waited until his old man was snoozing in his chair. He snuck up quietly and duct taped his pa&#39;s legs to the recliner (his pa was a heavy sleeper). Then with his tee-ball bat, whacked his pa in the snowballs. His pa woke up with an howl and started trying to get out of the chair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatr&#39;ya playin at boy!&quot; His pa growled as he tried to tear off the duct tape (There was a lot) &quot;Ya got a spankin&#39; comin&#39; for ya&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why&#39;d ya never say nothin&#39; &#39;bout Santa!?&quot; Declan demanded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why bother?&quot; snorted his pa &quot;You&#39;re such a naughty boy he ain&#39;t brought ya nothin&#39; but coal since ya was three. I&#39;ve been chuckin&#39; em in the furnace to keep the house warm.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I mighta tried to be a good boy if I&#39;d get more presents!&quot; argued Declan. <br />
<br />
&quot;I want ya to a good boy cause it&#39;s the right thing,&quot; his pa growled &quot;not &#39;cuz you&#39;ll get presents. Besides Santa knows when you&#39;re just pretendin&#39; to be good.&quot;<br />
<br />
Declan gave his pa another smack in the chestnuts before stalking off.<br />
<br />
&quot;ARRRRRGH, GET BACK HERE BOY,&quot; he bellowed &quot;AND GET ME OUTTA THIS CHAIR!&quot;<br />
<br />
Declan ignored him and went outside. There was only one day until Christmas, he had a lot to do if he was going to get off the naughty list. The first thing he tried was going around the block and offering to shovel drive ways for free. Unfortunately everyone in the neighborhood knew him and thought he was just there to play some nasty prank and told him to shoo. Next he looked for old ladies to help cross the street, but ain&#39;t nobody was out walking about in the cold, and Declan was too young to cross the street himself in anyways. Finally he trudged back home thinking maybe if he helped his pa around the house a bit he&#39;d get some good boy points when a stray snowball smacked him on the back of the head. He turned around and saw the boy two doors down from him, Rudy Olfman standing there quivering in fear as his friends all scampered away as quickly as possible.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry Declan!&quot; Rudy stuttered &quot;It was an accident! I wasn&#39;t throwin&#39; it at you!&quot;<br />
<br />
Declan forgetting to be nice, promptly knocked Rudy to the ground and filled his clothes with snow before shuffling back home. His father had managed to free himself and had a spanking waiting for Declan before supper and bed.<br />
<br />
On Christmas morning Declan rushed from his room to their tree, but to his dismay there was only one box for him from his pa. When his father made his way to the lounge room he checked Declan&#39;s stocking for him and shook his head disappointedly before pulling out a black rock and throwing it into the furnace. Despite Declan&#39;s attitude on Christmas Eve, his pa had given him a big box of his favorite sweets. Though he only let him have one on Christmas, he gave him the full box and sent him out on Boxing Day in the hopes that he&#39;d be a good boy and share with the other kids. Declan of course didn&#39;t see the point. Christmas had come and gone, there was no reason to be good now! But he went for a walk anyway thinking maybe kicking over some snowmen would make him feel better.<br />
<br />
Though as he was walking along the street, what did he see but Rudy Olfman in his front yard playing with a shiny new firetruck. The one Declan had on his list! He strode up to him clomping his boots in the snow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where&#39;d you get that!?&quot; He demanded to know.<br />
<br />
&quot;S-Santa gave it to me&quot; Rudy spluttered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want it&quot; Declan declared.<br />
<br />
&quot;But-but-&quot;<br />
<br />
Before Rudy could protest further Declan had shoved him to the ground and walked off with his new truck, leaving the other boy bawling his eyes out.<br />
<br />
Later that day Rudy&#39;s parents came to pay Declan&#39;s father a visit. Declan was forced to give Rudy back his truck as well as his box of sweets and received another spanking for his trouble.<br />
<br />
Declan was confined to his room, with no sweets, no truck and a stinging bottom. He stared out his window and saw all the boys and girls crowded around Rudy, who was handing out Declan&#39;s candy. He swore revenge on Santa Claus that day. He might have to bide his time but despite all of Declan&#39;s flaws he was wily and patient. He knew every year his pa got a box of samples from the factory as a bonus. Declan was never allowed to touch the box because his pa said it was dangerous (And usually sold them off to pay for Declan&#39;s school supplies and clothes), but Declan knew they would be instrumental to getting his revenge.<br />
<br />
How long did it take Declan to get his grubby hands on an AlterTech box? Or how long until Santa pays him a personal visit to teach him a lesson?</p>
