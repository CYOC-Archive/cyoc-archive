<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The Chronivac displayed the name &quot;Tom Branchford&quot;, and he could see his less than flattering depiction inside of it. Granted, Tom wasn&#39;t entirely bad looking. His face was somewhat pretty, and it naturally lent itself to a good looking appearance, and his physique was quite thin but toned and well formed...but in comparison to the other guys at the scene, he was too thin. Too pretty. It all added up to less than apt action on the scene. As usual tonight, he returned home to the apartment with only his hand available to make him feel any better.<br />
<br />
But now looking at this device, he could see that there were a variety of people including himself logged in there. He tilted his head, wondering what kind of freaky amoral person would make a device that could access the data of people like that from so far away. He could see so many different people in here! And they were depicted naked! Now, Tom was a kinky guy, but the fact this device was capable of this made him feel a bit apprehensive. What if he was discovered? What if someone caught on?<br />
<br />
But as he started tinkering with it, he started to get some other ideas.<br />
<br />
Looking at the onboard manual of the device, apparently this thing was straight up magical. Said it could make people change, and all that power immediately made Tom give a lecherous grin and feel his tight leather pants get just a bit tighter at the groin. Tom decided first and foremost to give himself a bit of an upgrade. He selected himself, and then went ahead to give himself the benefits of a few months of dedicated gym time.<br />
<br />
A few taps on the phone gave him fifteen pounds of muscle spread out across his body, and he got the transformation duration set to a mere two minutes. As he initialized the transformation, Tom squirmed as he felt his mesh shirt and leather jacket starting to get a bit tighter as well. Acting quickly, Tom took off his shirt and jacket, swearing to himself...and then watching as his pecs and abs developed. His pecs swelling outward a bit, his shoulders slightly broadening, abs pushing out more, looking less like skinny boy abs and more like dedicated weightlifter abs.<br />
<br />
He flexed his arms and saw his biceps swell up a little bit more, just enough to really give him some decent arm size. All the more popular guys in the scenes he was familiar with had great arms, and Tom was really feeling good about this. He gasped a little bit as he felt his glutes tighten, his legs slightly swelling and really making these leather pants look good on him.<br />
<br />
By the time it was done, Tom was substantially more excited than he&#39;d been when he dragged himself home from The Succubus.<br />
<br />
He cupped his groin and promptly stripped down, keen to enjoy the show. He stood mostly naked in front of his mirror, looking at himself in his black boxers and silver necklace. He wasn&#39;t anything like one of those big bodybuilder types, but Tom was definitely better looking now than he&#39;d been before. Maybe he could do with a bit more exploration of what this device could do. He was definitely a believer now in this thing&#39;s abilities.<br />
<br />
Tom loaded the Chronivac up again and started checking to see who was around him...and then saw Chase Hammond listed as one of his neighbors. Chase had been something of a recurring antagonist all the way through high school, and sure once they graduated Chase SAID he was sorry, but it was one of those non-apologies. Guy was tall, strong, fit, and bounced from one relationship to another. Everything Tom envied was present in him.<br />
<br />
The muscular and athletic Chase had even dodged the Freshman Fifteen at his college, though the bulging trapezius muscles on his shoulders said that the dodge was not one hundred percent natural. Maybe it was time to get back at Chase a fair bit. See how much he could push this Chronivac thing. Chase always thought he was such a big stud...maybe it was time to make this stud a bit more literal than usual.<br />
<br />
Tom went ahead and started a suitably ironic transformation on Chase, something that&#39;d last a week until it was done. Chase would be turning from the blond adonis he was now into a &quot;big stud&quot; - that is, a great big Clydesdale horse! Tom kind of wondered as he grinned perversely how long it&#39;d take before Chase noticed anything was awry. Dude wasn&#39;t exactly known for being book smart. Well, that was another kind of fun Tom could have in this.<br />
<br />
He made sure the change would take a week to complete, and got it started...and then promptly went ahead to go to bed himself. He was feeling pretty eager to see how things changed the following morning. Tom figured he could head to the gym and act like everything was good between him and Chase in order to get to observe this more intently. Tom went ahead to sleep, eager to get this underway...</p>
