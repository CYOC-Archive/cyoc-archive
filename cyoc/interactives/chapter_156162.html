<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mika found all four of his limbs....his entire body....very tightly wrapped. He heard the voice tell him he&#39;s currently in a casket that&#39;s going to be lowered into a vault, then buried beneath 6 feet of earth. <br />
<br />
He then heard and felt his container, his new permanent home, being lowered as it shook and vibrated. Mika, of course, began to panic. The simulation in his brain afforded him some tiny amount of movement. All of it vertical. He could very slightly raise his head two or three inches, before coming in contact with the lid. Likewise, with both of his feet. He had to lift them at the exact same time, as the simulation made his legs tightly bound together. He could very slightly bend his knees upward, but only a few inches before they bumped into the inside of his casket&#39;s lid. <br />
<br />
His arms were straight down at his sides, and tightly bound to his body. He couldn&#39;t move them at all, even the slightest inch. <br />
<br />
Worst of all, he couldn&#39;t breath, and it was pitch-black. He tried screaming, but the simulation made his mouth and head also tightly wrapped up. All he could do, was lightly moan. He was now doing quit a bit of that in his tortured mind. He was hysterically moaning while trying to thrash about as much as possible. Which was very little.<br />
<br />
He then heard the vault outside his casket shut and seal him in for good. Then came the sound of dirt landing on the vault&#39;s lid.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is the last time you&#39;ll hear any human voice as you lay there uncomfortably in your pitch-black grave for the rest of time. You&#39;ll now feel the burning desire to scratch an itchy nose, and other itchy spots randomly around your body.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good luck, and have a nice existence.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mika felt the itchiness on his nose, and he tried screaming as loud as he could. He strained his arms against their bonds to no avail. He kept trying to sit up, but couldn&#39;t raise his head more than two inches from his permanently prone position. <br />
<br />
The sound of the dirt covering his hole slowly faded as it got deeper, covering him further and further from the surface. Then all was quiet, with the exception of Mika screaming into his tightly-wrapped bandages around his head, and his heart pounding and racing ceaselessly. His head and legs were periodically &quot;thumping&quot; against the inside of his tightly packed casket. He was utterly trapped. Lying on his back. Buried alive and fully conscious. Panic-driven. The itchy feelings he could never reach to scratch, alone, driving him mad. <br />
<br />
There were times where Mika would try and meditate, as he lie there alone in his grave. He&#39;s be able to calm himself for a short while, just lying there calmly, but still feeling his bonds tightly encasing his body. At best, it would feel almost comfortable and he would nearly slip into a semi-sleep trans with just the feel of his body bound in indestructible bandages or something. <br />
<br />
In these semi--sleep states, he would begin to grow bored and want to go play one of his video games, or play with his dog or something. He&#39;d start to try and get up with the strong desire to play, only to be immediately greeted with his head bumping against his container&#39;s lid, j able to lift his head more than two inches. He&#39;d try again, to be met with the same resistance. He&#39;s try to stand up by bend at the knees, but unable to raise two inches. And suddenly, he&#39;d &quot;feel&quot; the weight of six feet of earth above his container weighing heavily down upon him. He would try and stretch his tightly-bound arms away from his body with absolutely no success. Then panic would set in as he thrashes around and screams as much as he possibly could. But he&#39;s utterly 100% trapped. <br />
<br />
He would get intensely horny and on the verge of wanting to cum, but never being able to release. <br />
<br />
Outside of his glass jar that contains his brain and his feeding solution, is a sterile science lab. His brain being fed his simulation. People would come in for a tour of this brain research facility, and see a bunch of glass jars with brains. Mika&#39;s was just one of many. But nobody looking at his brain would realize that it was conscious and in a universe of its own in complete and utter torture. Mika would be totally unaware of the science lab he is actually in. All he knows, is the inside of a coffin. Unaware that his brain is in a light-filled glass jar suspended in bluish-clear liquid, and hooked to a computer program. <br />
<br />
After several days, Mika&#39;s mind would be heavily &quot;trained&quot; to think that coffin was his entire world and universe. His condition of being buried alive totally imprinted on his brain. The scientist running this experiment is able to turn off the computer simulation, and record what&#39;s going through Mika&#39;s mind independently of a simulation feeding him. Mika would be completely incapable of knowing his thoughts and experiences were being recorded and monitored. All he knows, is his pitch-black world of torment.</p>
