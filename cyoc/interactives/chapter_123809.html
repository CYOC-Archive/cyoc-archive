<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;- That was a little bit radical, don&#39;t you think ? asks Douglas. I mean : did he humiliates you for a long or just for one time ? Because the change of life you&#39;re giving to him is quite extreme for...<br />
-... just a joke ? continues Fay. No, Douglas, trust me : he had earned it. You said it well : your brother was not the nice and respectful kind of guy. It was just a matter of time that he should earn a lesson for his behaviour and state of mind.<br />
- But why have you been with him, if you could read throught him like this ? Couldn&#39;t you not avoid him ?  Or, did you love that?<br />
- It took a couple of days for me to guess, and... I think this time I had really believed he could be the one. I see the way you look at me, Douglas, but I told you : I&#39;m quite old and experienced. I&#39;m  fast now. A fast learner and a fast actress. Meanwhile, I still hope when I meet someone that seems to be different. Quinn was promising : he makes me laught, he was very surprising, and attractive too. The disapointement was bigger because of that. And when you makes me suffer, willfully or not, I don&#39;t takes gloves anyway.<br />
- I understand.<br />
- I didn&#39;t expect any other reaction from you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Does Douglas was betraying his brother ? He was definitely feeling sympathy for Fay instead of searching a way to help his brother. But you doesn&#39;t meet a magical person every day, don&#39;t you? <br />
He finally stays all the afternoon quietly talking to Fay, and learning several facts. Something that would definately interest Quinn, but also somes stories and information which were giving him matter to think about.<br />
<br />
In the first place, there was other guys in this town trapped like Quinn.  Douglas listenned in awe as Fay told him about her recent collection.<br />
<br />
One of them, Tom, was too much proud of his body and didn&#39;t pay attention to his lover&#39;s pleasure when he share a bed with her. After Fay cursed him, he didn&#39;t believed his new living rules to be true, so he continues to act like he had always done but ... The first time he undressed, in a bedroom with his new mate, he was quite proud to found how stiff he felt. <br />
After the girl had leave the place, yelling, he realised that he had become a mannequin and that he was anable to move. He stay that way during hours, before someone -a maid who went to clean the room- found him. She first thought that some clients have peculiar taste and then she did her job. Unlucky for the poor guy, she didn&#39;t thought of dressing him, and she put his clothes in order, gathered all his things in his bag and had stored it at the founded objects office of the hotel. As nobody came for the mannequin, the hotel manager took him and put it in a storage. He stood like this during days, until some jerk of the crew, which was told to put the storage room in order, decided to dress him to have a little fun on his boring day. The moment the fabric took place on his body, the flesh started to come back. He was lucky this time, because the change back wasn&#39;t too quick, and the man had time to put him a shirt and a cap before he realised what was happening. When he saw that, he ran, terrified. Tom took some time to realise that he could move his arms, torso and head again, but when he did, he found out other clothes to dress up fully and becoming a running human, fleeing from the hotel. It was very difficult as he had no recovered his hands yet, because there was no gloves in the room, and he had to come back home (whitout his keys) to find all that he needed. After that, Tom remembers the rules Fay told him:<br />
-  He will become a mannequin each time he is fully naked, in order to never be able to see his beauty fully and to remember there is always something you don&#39;t see at first glance;<br />
- While he is a mannequin, he is also still and unable to move by himself, to discover what is it to need someone to achieve what he want; <br />
- And he will stay a mannequin until each part of him is dressed, to know that each part of the body is important, not only your pretty face or your dick.<br />
<br />
Terrified, it took several days to Tom to dare to put off the smaller piece of fabric he was wearing. You see, when he was trapped, Tom was completely lost, and after more than a week in the dark of a closet, and seing people passing away or taking stuff wihout even an attention at him, he was about to think he was mad, just an object which, by accident, was starting to think. <br />
Since that, he never dare to come to see Fay again, but she knows that he hadn&#39;t tell it to anyone (one more which seems popular but doesn&#39;t has any true friend), and that he always wear at least a pair of socks, so that he never change again, or at least he could always run in this case.<br />
<br />
&quot;- What a pitty, says Fay to Douglas. This little bastard didn&#39;t learn how to live with his curse. He just focus on avoiding it. It&#39;s a shame, I didn&#39;t want that.&quot;</p>
