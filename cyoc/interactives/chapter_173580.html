<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Having what were essentially rubber feet kept the walk home fairly painless though as mentioned before, its been a trying day both physically and mentally and sleep was all you really wanted. As you neared your apartment complex the shadows you had managed to hide within gave way to streetlights and you had to cross through them to get to the planters on your porch, which hid the spare key you needed because your regular key was apparently deconstructed molecularly. <br />
<br />
As you reached the first streetlamp at the edge of the parking lot a voice called to you with an authoritative bark, &quot;Please turn around!&quot; in your surprise you did, to find that one of the parked cars with its lights off was an undercover cop car. &quot;Shit.&quot; you mumbled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah! I wasn&#39;t expecting anything like this till the full moon next week.&quot; the officer exclaimed with a chuckle. &quot;Please remove the mask and use it to cover yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, Officer, I was attacked.&quot; you began desperately. &quot;Alien sentient latex attacked me and deformed my face, later I fell into a puddle of the stuff and managed to get away but not before it devoured my legs, I managed to get them back though they still feel like rubber...&quot; it was at that moment you realized how you sounded... if nobody else managed to get away and call the cops, which was likely, then he wouldn&#39;t have heard of any attacks and...<br />
<br />
&quot;So you&#39;re saying you&#39;re exposed and half covered in rubber paint because of aliens?&quot; the officer replied barely holding back a smirk.<br />
<br />
&quot;NO! Well, yes, but this isn&#39;t paint, and this isn&#39;t a mask.&quot; You pleaded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sir, what have you taken this evening?&quot; the officer asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing!&quot; you cried indignantly realizing that your beak lips and relearning how to speak wasn&#39;t helping your cause.<br />
<br />
The officer got out of his vehicle and was a head taller than you and about 50% wider. &quot;Are you sure you don&#39;t want to just say you took something while at a rubber kink sex party? Cause that would make a whole lot more sense all around. Don&#39;t you think?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Thaths not wha haffened.&quot; You struggled, more acutely aware of your inability to enunciate and wondered how much he understood of what you told him previously.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t suppose you can produce some Identification?&quot; the officer asked reaching into the trunk of his vehicle.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, tha fuddow ade it.&quot; you sighed.<br />
<br />
The officer pulled a blanket out of the trunk and shut it, &quot;Alright, cover up, I&#39;m going to write you a ticket for indecent exposure and take you down to the drunk tank.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?!? No! I was attacked, I live right here!&quot; you said instinctively backing away, unfortunately the rush of adrenaline immediately began to effect your exposed penis.<br />
<br />
The cop calmly reached for his cuffs as he stepped forward. You had no hope to out muscle him, you were too tired to outrun him (not to mention finding the key and opening the door isn&#39;t easy while being chased), you couldn&#39;t speak clearly enough to reason with him and the next morning when they see your facial deformities more clearly and realize you aren&#39;t and weren&#39;t under the influence... the possibility of becoming a science experiment didn&#39;t seem too far fetched. &quot;Don&#39;t make me tackle you naked man...&quot;<br />
<br />
Panic was gripping you tighter and tighter, every step you took back he matched and with his longer stride inched closer and closer. He was within 6 feet, just two more steps and he&#39;d be within striking distance to grab you. You had backed back under the streetlamp and could now clearly see how easily he could physically dominate you. He was not just hulking, but lean, and looked like he had been shaving since he was 8. All hope seemed lost and that&#39;s when it happened...<br />
<br />
Your face latex launched itself as a glob at his head with such force it felt like you were punched. The officer stumbled back dropping the handcuffs and blanket immediately groping at the stuff stopping him from being able to see or breathe. The officer weighed more than you so his stumbling back pulled you forward roughly. After a second you pieced together that you had somehow attacked him and began yanking on the rubber cord connecting you to the officer. As you yanked roughly the officer blindly stepped forward but still fell to a kneeling position. <br />
<br />
You don&#39;t know how long it had been but the officer&#39;s groping at his face was becoming frantic. You did the first thing you could think to do, you stepped up and putting your foot on his shoulder trying to pull yourself free of him. The officer suddenly thrashed in desperation hitting your leg with his his head and to your horror, things got worse.<br />
<br />
Your leg stuck to his ear/cheek area and he pulled you off balance when he flung his head the other direction. Instinctively you said, &quot;Hold still, I&#39;m trying to help.&quot; forgetting that your lips were stretched over 3 feet. Your foot accidentally landed on his neck sticking immediately. His hand grabbed your leg trying to push you off but that stuck too. You tried to use your leg to push off of him and pull on your face but your leg simply melted coating his chest and back and dragging his hand to his neck as your leg enveloped him. His free hand went to his Billy club and you hopped around trying to avoid getting hit... eventually you fell, slowly bringing him toppling down on top of you. <br />
<br />
Your latex lower half was no longer solid but instead you could feel it coating his body. You could feel the officer&#39;s heartbeat and feel him struggling to free himself, you could identify that you had covered his torso and down to his calves and were reaching towards his toes. As he tensed his muscles you saw him raise his club and he was now close enough to your non latex torso that this could really hurt, in a flash his arm was engulfed in latex and he couldn&#39;t swing, a moment later he went limp his head fell softly on your belly.<br />
<br />
Slowly your latex detached from his face and you breathed a sigh of relief as you could feel his breathing commence and his heartbeat continued. You could feel that you had engulfed everything but his head in your latex and as effective as that was in restraining him, you couldn&#39;t get away while attached...<br />
<br />
Panicking and trying to pull on the latex didn&#39;t work so maybe trying to connect with it like when he formed it into legs in the first place will work. You close your eyes and try to relax, connecting with all the latex and feeling where it is in space and what its connected to. You focus on pulling it back to you starting with his toes. The officer lets out a relaxed moan and begins to snore. you desperately want to move his head off you but can&#39;t risk waking him as you are about to get away!<br />
<br />
You focus on pulling back the latex from the officer&#39;s feet, calves, legs, his groin. You glance over at his arm and grab the club pulling it out of his reach. You close your eyes again and focus on pulling back from his hands and arms. Your connection tells you that you can feel his face became fully engulfed again but you don&#39;t want to engulf more, you keep pulling back, drawing it back to you. You focus on pulling back from his torso, back, and chest but this feels slower for some reason, finally you can no longer feel his heartbeat or breathing and you focus on pulling in the latex from his head and neck.<br />
<br />
A moment passes and you feel really warm all of a sudden. You look down hoping to see your legs have reformed but instead you see a blue latex puddle and an empty officer&#39;s uniform. You weren&#39;t pulling in the latex, you were pulling in the officer. <br />
<br />
Tex flies up from wherever she had been hiding. &quot;Wow, I didn&#39;t know if you could get out of that one but you did, and quite cleanly too! Look you left the clothes entirely untouched! Wow, cleanest first meal I&#39;ve EVER seen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I killed him?&quot; You muttered horrified. <br />
<br />
&quot;No, he&#39;s still here, but he&#39;s part of you now.&quot; Tex commented cheerily. &quot;But much of you is still human so I&#39;m fascinated how this will effect you.&quot;<br />
<br />
You focus on reforming your legs and trying to get away but your form now has roughly 220 more pounds of latex dead weight to drag along and you can&#39;t move.<br />
<br />
Now close to tears, just 250 feet from your bed you reimagine accessing the officers form, but scaled up to 370 lbs to encompass your mass and his mass combined.  The latex coats you creating a mech-like coating around you and it somehow works, you can move and manage to get into your apartment before carefully collapsing onto your bed.</p>
