<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">How did the story start? It was the best of times, it was the worse of times. This, Stephanie thought, would be to most apt description of how her Junior year had begun.<br />
<br />
For the first time in her school life,  Stephanie had friends. Nat, Rei, and the others accepted Stephanie without question. She had always wished for friends like this throughout her life, people who showed compassion, people that didn&#39;t think she was just some spoiled rich girl. She finally found those friends, including a best friend named Chenoa. Chenoa, much like Stephanie, had also been an outsider; the Deer girl not quite fitting in but wanting too. The pairs mutual concerns drawing them closer to the point they shared secrets and dreams with one another. Stephanie&#39;s life was everything she could have hoped for. Still, it wasn&#39;t quite perfect.<br />
<br />
The worse of times started quite accidentally. Chenoa had tapped into her latent magic, showing off an incredible potential as a shaman. This potential had transformed the entire school into animal people. All except one and that one was where things became difficult for the 16 year old.<br />
<br />
When the spell reversed itself, Stephanie and the others discovered how Chenoa had transformed everyone. There was some awkwardness at first but the true problem was how both Stephanie and Chenoa had treated Travis. The best friends had struck the teen, for simply showing concern for noticing the changes. Travis&#39;s concerns weren&#39;t based on any type bias but in genuine fear of their well being. Stephanie and Chenoa, at the time, hadn&#39;t seen that. They simply attacked Travis. Now though, they began to understand the consequences of their actions.<br />
<br />
It waa a little over a week since the accident. During this time Travis slowly began to distance himself from the others. At first he had tried to be cordial, to be forgiving. Stephanie, in retrospect, probably shouldn&#39;t have said what she did. She made a poor judgment call, thinking he was only interested in her looks when he was simply concerned about her well being. That Chenoa had whole heartedly agreed with her, only pushed Travis away. When the pair realized their mistake, they found Travis avoiding them, the teen looking despondent and not speaking with anyone. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh cmon answer,&quot; Stephanie groaned as she glared at her texts. She had been trying to get Travis to respond for a couple of days now to no avail. Travis appeared to have shut down, withdrawing from everyone. &quot;Everything okay in here,&quot; Ann asked. Stephanie groaned, tossing her phone to the side as she looked to her adoptive mother. &quot;Travis won&#39;t return my text,&quot; she sighed. &quot;I&#39;ve been trying to apologize to him. I know I messed up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You just have to give him time Steph,&quot; Ann sighed, noting the look of annoyance on her daughters face. &quot;I know, I know, you really hate waiting but you and Chenoa hurt him. He needs some time but he&#39;ll get back to you soon.&quot; Stephanie grunted in annoyance. Ann had heard the whole story, not taking a side but pointing out hitting him for being concerned probably wasn&#39;t the best idea.  If she truly like him, she would give him space and hope he would come around. <br />
<br />
&quot;Listen,&quot; Ann said softly.  I know the whole Travis thing is bumming you out but I was hoping you would come with me today.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What for,&quot; Stephanie asked. &quot;I was going to swing by your cousin Katie&#39;s place,&quot; Ann stated. &quot;Lisa asked of we could pick Lynne up, she&#39;s going to be running a little late and she doesn&#39;t want to leave Katie with all the kids. I know you like babysitting Lynne, so what do you say?&#39; Stephanie paused as she thought of her cousins. Katie and her wife were both busy but always quite kind to Stephanie, especially after she was adopted. Couple that with them being powerful wizards and it always made for an entertaining time. Lynne, her youngest, and perhaps favorite, cousin was sometimes babysat by Stephanie. Ever since Gloria had gone away to college, Stephanie had picked up the slack as far as babysitting went. Honestly, she loved babysitting Lynne. The red haired 4 year old was spunky, mischievous, and caring. It helped too that Lynne, for whatever reason, adored Stephanie. &quot;Sure mom,&quot; she smiled. &quot;Seeing Lynne would definitely cheer me up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Making their way to Katie&#39;s, Stephanie continued to mull over the entire Travis situation. She really like this guy and wanted this to work. How long would it take before he accepted her apology? What else did she have to do? As mother and daughter now made their way towards the front door, they could heat excited talking coming from within. Curious, they now knocked, waiting for Katie to answer the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aunt Ann,  Stephanie, come on in,&quot; Katie smiled. &quot;Hi Katie,&quot; Ann smiled. &quot;Sounds like there&#39;s a party going on in here. The kids aren&#39;t giving you too much trouble ate they?&quot; Katie smiled, inviting the pair in as she looked back towards the living room. &quot;No they&#39;re just excited. We have company.&quot; Ann and Stephanie now looked to where Katie was pointing, Stephanie having to do a double take as she noticed a very familiar looking teenage girl. &quot;Mom why is there a teenage version of you here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually Steph that&#39;s my sister,&quot; Katie smirked. &quot;Ann Pendragon, from the other timeline. She came to visit.&quot; Stephanie balked, she had heard of the other timeline before. Apparently this was where her Aunt Kellie and Uncle Jack, Katie&#39;s parents, resided. She had never met anyone from there though, let alone a teenage version of her mother. &quot;Mom did you know about her?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I met her once,&quot; Ann stammered, shocked to see her teenage doppelganger once more. &quot;And you never thought to say anything,&quot; Stephanie exclaimed. Ann vanished, sheepishly rubbing her neck as she looked between teenage Ann and Stephanie. The last time she had anything to do with the other timeline was three years ago when the realms merged. Hopefully Ann&#39;s appearance wasn&#39;t a bad omen. &quot;Steph why don&#39;t you go talk with her,&quot; Katie stated. &quot;Ann just started high school and she came with a few friends. You might find you have somethings in common.&quot; Stephanie looked between Katie and Ann, picking up on the subtle hints the pair wanted to talk in private. Shrugging the ebony haired teen now made her way towards the living room to introduce herself to her cousin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Steffy,&quot; Lynne exclaimed, sprinting to Stephanie and hugging her. &quot;Steffy look this is Annie!&quot; Stephanie paused, locking eyes with the teenage version of Ann. It was uncannyhow similar she looked to her own mom. Stephanie had seen pictures of Ann in her early teen days. A wafish body with a shy smile and blue atreaked hair. This Ann was that same girl. &quot;Um hey,&quot; Stephanie said. &quot;I guess I&#39;m your cousin Stephanie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi,&quot; teenage Ann replied. &quot;I&#39;m Ann. Ann Pendragon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You just started high school?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah I&#39;m a Freshman,&quot; Ann replied, curiously studying Stephanie. &quot;I didn&#39;t know the other me had a daughter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Adopted daughter,&quot; Stephanie stated. &quot;Couple years ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Steffy,&quot; Lynne exclaimed pulling on her arm. &quot;Annie has magic!&quot; Stephanie paused, looking to the teenage Ann who now sheepishly rubbed her neck. &quot;Yeah I do,&quot; she replied nervously holding out her hand to reveal the two rings she wore. &quot;Do you have magic?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Stephanie grinned. &quot;Guess I&#39;m the only one in the family that doesn&#39;t. I do have a battle suit though.&quot; Ann tilted her head, curious about what Stephanie was saying. &quot;So you in town for long?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just for the afternoon,&quot; Ann replied. &quot;My friends are visiting their goddaughter and I wanted to tag along.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well then let&#39;s start getting to know eachother,&quot; Stephanie stated. &quot;I want to know all about my mysterious cousin.&quot;</p>
