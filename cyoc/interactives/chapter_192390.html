<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Between lessons with Yuriko, lessons with Akira, and lessons now with Fukushu, Darren was feeling a bit stretched thin. School it seemed was a needed relief from his other activities.<br />
<br />
Taking a deep breath, Darren now gazed at the front foyer of the school. Students, teachers, and the two Soul Drives went about their morning routine, busily making their way to class. Darren now noticed the elderly janitor mopping the floor.<br />
<br />
Otis had been the janitor at the school for probably 30 years. Pushing 70 the older man had a sour look on his face as he mopped. &quot;Ugh I&#39;m getting too old for this,&quot; he grumbled. Darren rubbed his chin for moment as he thought. Maybe he could give him back his youth?<br />
<br />
Darren quickly dismissed that thought, who would want to be a 13 year old janitor. Approaching Otis, he watched as the man lifted his head, giving Darren a tired smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hows your day going Otis,&quot; Darren asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eh same as usual kid,&quot; he sighed. &quot;Mopping the floor and fixing stuff round here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Doesn&#39;t sound like fun,&quot; Darren said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well if I had my way I&#39;d be home watching daytime t.v.,&quot; he chuckled. &quot;Still, used to like the job more. It was kinda peaceful just getting the work done. Now though, well, let&#39;s just say arthritis sucks.&quot; Darren nodded, stepping back as Otis began going about his duties. He had the perfect idea for how to help the old janitor.<br />
<br />
Otis froze in place, his skin taking on a plastic sheet as the wispy white hairs on his head vanished. Otus&#39;s body now began to transform, his face reshaping taking on a more canine appearance complete with false synthetic ears that looked like they belonged on a blood hound. Otis&#39;s clothes now vanished, Darren noticing the his plastic body was smooth and featureless. Brown fur now covered portions of his torso while his hands took on the appearance of dog paws. The newly minted Soul Drive now smiled, whistling as he went about his duties.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey there Otis.&quot;<br />
<br />
Otis the Soul Drive now looked up from his task, flashing a smile at the young teen. &quot;Morning there Darren,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t know you had recordings of whistling.&quot; Otis smirked, impishly looking around before beckoning Darren within whispering distance. &quot;Actually,&quot; he grinned. &quot;Thats not a recording. Pam installed a set of artificial lungs into my system. She&#39;s been giving me music lessons after school lately.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pam,&quot; Darren gaped. &quot;You mean Ms. Foster? She&#39;s been giving you music lessons!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I am her Soul Drive unit,&quot; Otis stated proudly. &quot;And I&#39;ve always loved music. I mean if I&#39;m going to serve the needs of a musical prodigy might as well get a little something out of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you like your job?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like it,&quot; Otis exclaimed. &quot;I love it! Plus I get to practice my music. I&#39;m hoping Pam can give me some singing lessons this weekend. Now if you excuse me, the furnace has been acting a bit funny. Gonna have to give it a tune up.&quot; Darren now watched as Otis put his mop away, the Soul Drive happily whistling as he opened the door to the schools basement.<br />
<br />
As Darren went about the rest of his day, he couldn&#39;t help but feel a bit of pride in his latest accomplishment. Otis had loved what he did as a human, his bodybwas just beginning to breakdown. Now, as a Soul Drive, he could continue to do what he loved without the aches and pains of a human body. He could even explore some of his old interests, such as music, while looking after one of the teen prodigies he had created.<br />
<br />
As Darren now made his way into the guidance counselors office he smiled, noticing Stella Heat waiting for him. The counselor had called him to his office to help him in deciding what to do about high school next year.<br />
<br />
&quot;So have you given high school alot of thought,&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;To be honest not really,&quot; Darren shrugged. &quot;I&#39;ve, um, been a bit busy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know things can be a bit busy at times,&quot; Stella stated. &quot;But you need to think carefully about your future. These are going to be some of the most important years of your life. Depending on your choices, it could shape what you do as an adult.&quot;<br />
<br />
Darren nodded, agreeing with the young counselor. Eighth grade would be ending soon, he probably should begin thinking about what would be in store for him over the next four years.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stella have you completed those evaluations I asked for?&quot;<br />
<br />
Stella and Darren turned, noticing a man in his 60s with thinning grey hair and glasses. &quot;I&#39;m almost finished Paul,&quot; she said. &quot;I told you I would have them on your desk by the end of the day. I&#39;m just in the middle of a session right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can see that Ms. Heat,&quot; Paul replied. &quot;But I requested those evaluations yesterday. If you don&#39;t think you can handle it just let me know. I can have one of the other counselors finish them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can do it Dr. Voss,&quot; Stella said quickly, Darren noticing the young counselor frown at her older boss. Paul simply nodded, casting a critical eye at both young teens before closing the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry about Dr. Voss,&quot; she sighed. &quot;He still isn&#39;t sold on the idea of a teenage teacher. I swear sometimes he makes me feel like such a child.&quot; Stella blushed, composing herself as she now looked at Darren. &quot;Sorry shouldn&#39;t vent to you like that. Its easy to forget sometimes that I&#39;m the teacher and your the student.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Its okay Ms. Heat,&quot; Darren smiled. &quot;I guess even counselors need counseling sometimes.&quot; Stella chuckled thanking Darren. &quot;If you&#39;ll excuse me for one sec Ms. Heat.&quot;<br />
<br />
Darren now stepped out if Stella Heads office for a moment as he gazed at the older psychologist. He had the perfect idea of what he needed to do with Paul Voss.<br />
<br />
Paul began growing younger. The man&#39;s grey hair steadily creeping forward, becoming a golden blond. As he crept backwards in age, Darren watched as the man&#39;s face began to smooth, his thin body regaining some muscle. Even the psychologists white beard began to regain some color.<br />
<br />
Soon a man in his early 30s stood in his office yet Darren knew he wasn&#39;t done yet. Paul continued to youthen, racing back through his 20s. Soon a college psych major stood, where an experienced one had once been. Leaving his 20s and reentering his teens, Darren watched as Paul&#39;s body began to thin, his beard becoming thinner as he raced backwards in age. By the time Paul became 16 once more only the faintest amount of hair existed on his smooth teenage face.<br />
<br />
That hair though quickly vanished, leaving thw teens face baby smooth. Paul now began to grow smaller, puberty reversing itself even further. Paul now exited high school, a young teen ver much like him and Stella Heat. The teen now possessed a round and smooth face with a mop of blond hair, the former psychologist swamped in his adult clothing. An impish though now crossed Darren&#39;s mind as he gazed at the handsome young teen.<br />
<br />
Darren now goosed one extra year off if Paul, the boy shrinking down to 12. Paul&#39;s face was now round, devoid of any hair, and only showing the faintest signs of puberty. Thw now 12 year old blinked, his clothes reforming into a blue blazer and khaki pants with topside shoes. <br />
<br />
Darren quickly reentered Stellas office as Paul tentatively approached Steelas door. As the boy now quietly knocked, Stella called for him to come in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm Ms. Heat,&quot; Paul said meekly, his voice a boyish soprano. &quot;I um finished those evaluations you asked me to look at.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Paul,&quot; Stella smiled. &quot;Did you double check my appointments for this afternoon?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm no,&quot; Paul blushed. &quot;I um kinda forgot.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stella sighed, giving the younger boy an almost motherly look. &quot;Paul if you&#39;re going to be working here next year you need to be more thorough,&quot; she stated. &quot;I don&#39;t want to give you a bad review for your internship.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll double check them now Ms. Heat,&quot; Paul squeaked as he quickly departed. Stella simply shook her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Interns,&quot; she sighed. &quot;Always so worried about the wrong things. Don&#39;t get me wrong, Paul is a nice kid. I just worry about what he&#39;ll be like when he&#39;s working here next year after he graduates from college.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stella now turned to Darren, a small smile on her face. &quot;Well that will be my problem not yours,&quot; she said. &quot;Have a good day Darren hope to see you soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
Darren smiled, waving goodbye. It had already been a pretty good day.</p>
