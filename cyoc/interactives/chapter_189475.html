<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The deinonychus emerged from the garage – after hastily cleaning up his messy evidence with an old oil cloth – and carefully closed the door again behind him. Nobody would ever have to know he had been there.<br />
<br />
The clever dinosaur man felt absolute euphoria as he stood in the rain and let it soak him to his scales. He was entirely himself now. The very last of the great and wonderful dinosauria revived and imbued with the duality of a human mind and a beast’s body. He could literally be whatever he wanted now. He had the ability to do whatever he wanted and go where ever he liked. He threw his jaw up to the sky, let the rain fall across his snout, and and closed his eyes, relishing the feeling. All of his senses danced and tingled in full strength as a snap of lightning and thunder momentarily lit him up in the cloudy stormy night.<br />
<br />
He moaned a little in erotic bliss as he came to a sudden decision. He would go after Rick’s technology and take it for himself. He could resurrect the dinosaur, destroy man, or simply create a new world of joint animal and man society.<br />
<br />
But first, he had to get there. And, with a quirky smile, he realized the fastest way would be to fly. He urged himself to transform into a full bird capable of flight. The Deinonychus stood in the rain and let out a pleased gasp as he body complied. He began to shrink. His feathers grew, his bone structure lightened and changed. His snout developed, his eyes grew, his torso dwindled. His legs lost length, shrank, his talons grew longer and his feet wider spread. He let out a caw, losing speech, and then a trill as he reduced from humanoid to a dino bird. He was absolutely tiny, barely a foot long, but he had gorgeous full wings instead of arms that could carry him aloft and a tail fan that female dinos would die for. A quick check revealed that he had maintained his colours and feathering, but he had reduced, or rather, evolved to an intermediary state between full dinosaur and full bird.<br />
<br />
He was an entirely new species!<br />
<br />
The thrill of that made his heart beat fast. He got used to his form, bobbing and hopping around the yard, and then broke into a run. He pushed off the ground, spread his wings... and was carried up in the rain. Several strong flaps raised him up several feet in the air and despite the light gust from the storm, he was an able flyer. He glided up and up, circling around into the night sky, and felt a rush of adrenaline as he found himself some 40-50 feet above the houses, looking down on the streets below.<br />
<br />
He spied the industrial district he had travelled through with Brendon, realized he felt no remorse at his ‘friend’s’ demise, and let out a sigh of relief as he let go of the guilt he felt. The dino bird flew higher still, rain pelting his oiled feathers and glancing off as he winced a little at the hard droplets smacking against his face.<br />
<br />
Flying was so natural, so relaxing, that he barely had to think about it. He got used to the spray in his face and found intense enjoyment in soaring above the world. An adjustment here, a little push of the wing here. He was startled as he began to recognize the park... the houses... he dipped down and focused on a particular beige and brown roofed home on one corner. The lab. His genesis. His future.<br />
<br />
The dino bird circled and landed with impeccable grace and found himself standing on the roof top. The lights were off. Vehicles were gone. Perhaps they were out looking for raptor Brendon? Perhaps...<br />
<br />
Rex struck a coy smile and felt a hint of his darker reptilian nature creep in. Look all you like, he thought. You’ll never find him. Now, how to get inside? Well, he had every ability to do so in ways humans could never imagine.<br />
<br />
From the roof, he spied a cone tipped vent fuming a plume of warm steam. There it was. He probed his collected memory and nodded to himself as he expected to reach the basement sooner than expected.<br />
<br />
The dino bird approached the vent pipe and glanced inside. Quite a snug fit. Good thing he could become smaller. The dino bird reduced himself and let out a pleased caw as he shrank and shrank to unfathomably tiny size, adjusting his body’s metabolism and form to scale down to the appropriate level he needed.<br />
<br />
The single shingle he now stood on stretched out like a football field or more around him. He looked up and saw a titantic pipe jutting into the sky stories above him. The thrill of being so tiny and yet so resourceful was keenly erotic. He was the size of an insect. No... he was smaller than an insect.<br />
<br />
He pushed himself off the ground and rose only inches above the roof, rain exploding around him in delayed speed. To his sudden realization and fascination he began to comprehend that he was so small that his very perception of time itself had changed. The giant world around him had slowed in such a way that he was moving at regular speed and the world was moving in slow motion. He ducked out of the way of water droplets ten times as big as his own body as navigating upward and into a canyon sized tube.<br />
<br />
He began to circle the vent carefully, getting his bearings, and shrank down further. The space around him grew accordingly until he was a spec of dust flying around the width of two stadiums. A vast empty nothing with darkness waiting below.<br />
<br />
A crack of thunder rattled the vent for minutes as the heavily reduced dino bird began to descend. With his natural night vision active, he fell downward into the abyss without fear. Soon enough, he passed into the void below and felt heat begin to rise against him, forcing him back up on a thermal. He grew slightly... only slightly... to the size of a pin’s point and found he was better able to fight the rising current. Down he went, for what seemed like hours, until he felt the distinctive heat of the furnace blasting below. Well before that, he slipped into a massive tunnel to one side and was thrilled to realize he was standing in one of the air ducts in the basement roof.<br />
<br />
He grew... relishing the sensation as he enlarged to half the size of the 4” ductwork, and began to travel down the tunnel. Another sharp drop. He looked down and his heart leapt as he saw Rick’s work station hundreds of feet below. With a cry of delight, the dino bird reduced himself one last time and dropped down, slipping down into a dive and easily clearing the distinctive slats of the vent cover.<br />
<br />
He dropped into the basement as a grain of sand and hit the desktop as his full sized dino bird.<br />
<br />
Panting, delighted, the creature hopped down to the floor and took a look around. He recognized everything from Brendon’s former memory. His heart raced in delight. It was still, quiet, dark. He was completely alone.<br />
<br />
He concentrated and grew back to humanoid Rex, experiencing a head rush as he swelled back up to seven feet and restored to his deinonychus self.<br />
<br />
He took a quick glance up at the vent above and smiled wryly with self-congratulatory delight.</p>
