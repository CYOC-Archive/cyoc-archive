<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">That night, Sammy did indeed dream of diapering the in the moon, and baby furs having space stations that looked like giant dublo sets over the entire solar system. <br />
<br />
Like everything else transformed by the baby furs, the hotel was mostly scaled to their size and use. There was a bathroom, but it was just that, a bath, the baby furs didn&#39;t notice or care about the lack of other services they had no need for. <br />
<br />
As Sammy and Jessy woke up the next morning still snuggling with each other, Sammy off-handedly wondered if the shark baby fur he&#39;d seen was really a shark, or just a whale or something that looked like one, after all, having to breath water the way fish did, would have been as confining as if they all had fish tails. This made Sammy wonder about those mermaid rumors he&#39;d heard on Maxi&#39;s plane... maybe those could have paws on dry land? Or maybe the ocean was so vast and big, they thought that it was the walking baby furs who were trapped? Sammy didn&#39;t know. Or the mermaid thing was just stories. <br />
<br />
The two baby furs sat up in the crib, and Sammy asked. &quot;Time for breakfast?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s have a bath first!&quot; Jessy said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Didn&#39;t we get wet enough yesterday?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah and it was fun!&quot; Jessy giggled.<br />
<br />
&quot;True!&quot; Sammy giggled back. <br />
<br />
The two baby furs filled the tube that was actually rather big for them, but that suited them just fine as they hopped in, diapers and all, and sliphed splashed around, soaking themselves and the bathroom itself, getting soap, and bubble bath that never seemed to run out, and soon had the entire room covered in suds. <br />
<br />
Deciding it was finally times for breakfast, the two came out of the bathroom covered in suds. They shook themselves clean of the bubbles and dried themselves off with a towel. As they left, a filly baby fur came in with a large bow on her back wearing a apron. <br />
<br />
Without hesitation they introduced themselves, &quot;Hi, I&#39;m Sammy The Fox.&quot; &quot;I&#39;m Jessy The Raccoon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Flora The Filly! Nice to meet you! Whoa! This is going to be fun!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Doesn&#39;t everything clean itself?&quot; Jessy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not if I want to have fun cleaning it up!&quot; Filly said with a giggle, and they giggled back. Sammy figured this was important somehow, but couldn&#39;t figure out what, oh well. Time for breakfast!<br />
<br />
Holding paws, the two hopped down the stairs, which were now a slide, and skidded down with a &#39;Whee!&#39; and landed safely on a pillow below.<br />
<br />
They entered the big hotel&#39;s dinning room, and found it was almost completely full of baby furs. <br />
Though Sammy and Jessy knew that if the place got too full, it would just expand on the inside, without having to get any bigger on the outside to make room for more friends. <br />
<br />
As Samuel The Not-Friend, he&#39;d have logically reasoned how impossible that was. As Sammy The Fox baby fur, the thought couldn&#39;t have been more natural. <br />
<br />
Sammy got a huge stack of flapjacks, while Jessy got a stack of waffles. <br />
<br />
The two last open seats were next to an Alligator baby fur who was scarfing down french toast.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi! My name is Sammy The Fox!&quot; &quot;And my name is Jessy The Raccoon!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can we sit with you?&quot; They asked, thought it as a formality, they were all friends here, of course it was alright. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Alfred The Alligator! And sure!&quot; <br />
<br />
The two sat down and began to eat breakfast and chat with Alfred. <br />
<br />
Alfred had also met friends who wondered, fantasized, and talked about if the First Fur could make baby furs &#39;more magical&#39;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like make an Alligator a dinosaur or a dragon?&quot; Jessy asked, excited a bit at the idea.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe, but I don&#39;t mind, I like being an Alligator anyway.&quot; Alfred shrugged. <br />
<br />
&quot;I wonder if she made me a Tanooki, I could talk with animals.&quot; Jessy wondered with stars in her eyes. <br />
<br />
&#39;Don&#39;t Tanooki also turn into statues for jokes?&#39; Sammy wondered. Seeing how excited the idea of being &#39;upgraded&#39; by the first fur made Jessy, Sammy hoped it was a true. Not that it mattered to him one way or another, he liked Jessy whatever she was. Though if she asked him to become a kitsune for her, he imagined that he could never turn down her request. That was assuming the first fur could do such a magic trick at all. <br />
<br />
They hadn&#39;t seen any &#39;mythical&#39; baby furs yet, but there were just so many of them, and more by the day, it was hardly impossible that Jessy and Sammy simply hadn&#39;t met any yet. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you going to Cape Carnival to see the space ship lunch?&quot; Sammy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s the whole reason I came here!&quot; Alfred said. &quot;I&#39;m from New York. Friends were busy still making friends of not-friends when I left, but I just had to see the space shuttle lunch!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wanna see it with us?&quot; Jessy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure!&quot; Alfred said. Showing more concern and politeness than any &#39;real&#39; toddler ever would and put their plates back (they&#39;d eaten with their paws) and gave their keys back to the cute cat baby fur in the lobby. <br />
<br />
Alfred knew the way around Cape Carnival better than Jessie and Sammy, and so led them to where they could have great view of the space ship taking off!<br />
<br />
Along the way, next to the side walk was a booth and stand.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Hi! I&#39;m Ziggy The Zebra!&quot; &quot;And I&#39;m Silly The Skunk! Wanna try our color changing booth?&quot; Asked a Baby Fur skunk next t a baby fur zebra. Except the skunk&#39;s black parts were turquoise and the white parts were pink. And the The zebra&#39;s stripes were a bunch of random colors with his diaper with colored stripes to almost make it look like he wasn&#39;t even wearing one. The skunk baby fur&#39;s diaper had a buncha happy stickers on it. <br />
<br />
&quot;How does it work?&quot; Sammy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh it&#39;s very simple!&quot; Said Silly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! Oh! Can you make me blue?&quot; Asked a doe baby fur hopping up clapping. &quot;I&#39;m Anne-Bells The Deer!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course we can! First! We draw this picture of you!&quot; Ziggy drew a simplistic pre-school rendering of Anne-Belles that looked like a picture in a coloring book. &quot;Then you step in here!&quot; He gestured to a plastic box that looked like a changing booth with a door on both ends. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay!&quot; Anne-Belles did without hesitation. <br />
<br />
&quot;We slip this in here.&quot; Ziggy said slipping the coloring-book like picture in a slot in front.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then we color her blue!&quot; Silly said, taking crayons, and then colored in the coloring book picture all blue. &quot;And then you&#39;re blue!&quot;<br />
<br />
Anne-Belle stepped out... and she was blue, blue fur, blue eyes, blue diaper. Then looked at herself and giggled.<br />
<br />
&quot;COOL!&quot; The other baby furs said at once. <br />
<br />
Anne got to keep the picture of herself. &quot;If I color it, will I change?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Naw, you have to be in the booth, and it has to be in the slot for that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! Okay, that makes sense.&quot; Anne-Belle said, and to all the baby furs present, it did. <br />
<br />
Anne-Belle bounced away after giving the pair some play money.<br />
<br />
Sammy knew beyond a doubt that had to be magic. And it made more a bit more warm and fuzzy inside knowing that baby furs were being so clever.</p>
