<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Dammit. Open up,&quot; Holly bleated  in anger as her hooves scrabbled uselessly against the wood of her dresser and then jamming them into the crack between the side of the drawer and the rest of the dresser, she tried to force open the drawer that way before thinking, &quot;Stupid hooves,&quot; as she turned her head first one way, then another as she tried to grip in her mouth the handle that had been so easy to pull on when she had had hands.<br />
<br />
A series of bleats that expressed her frustration and lowering her head, Holly headbutted the dresser, which rocked back and slammed into the wall. Listening to a couple of things on her dresser spill off, Holly turned away. Looking at her clean room, hating that she couldn&#39;t even leave one piece of clothing lying about, she gazed down at her four hooves and bleated, &quot;I don&#39;t want to be a goat,&quot; before bleating out, &quot;Dion. You are so going to pay for this,&quot; before trip trapping across her room to her closet, where she tried to open the door by wrapping first hooves, then her arms around the handle.<br />
<br />
Irked when that didn&#39;t work, her temper slipping even more, Holly glared at the thing keeping her from getting what she wanted. Lowering her head, unaware that she now had a pair of horns instead of the nubs she had noticed moments before, she headbutted the door a couple times before dropping to all fours. Bleating, &quot;Stupid door,&quot; she lowered her head, reared back and, unaware how animal like she was acting or that her body was starting to transform even more, she proceeded to slam her head forward.<br />
<br />
&quot;Open up, dammit,&quot; she bleated and after she had butted the stout wood a couple more times, she proceeded to turn and try and use her back hooves to kick through the door.<br />
<br />
So angry at her inability to get any of her clothing, Holly was completely oblivious as her body, with a series of cracks, ceased to be bipedal and became quadruped. Her back legs shortening until they were the same length as her front legs, Holly continued kicking at the door, unaware as her height dropped to about 31 inches high, 25 at her withers, and her body lengthened to forty inches. Taking a couple steps back, breathing hard, Holly tossed her morphing head and turned to look at the closet door. Seeing evidence of where her rear hooves had struck, but hadn&#39;t gone through, she bleated her out agitation about how her father had built such a sturdy closet. Thinking she might try again with trying to wrap her arms around the hand and twist it that way, she tried to stand up.<br />
<br />
Only to find herself dropping back down to stand on her front hooves. Confused, not sure why she couldn&#39;t stand up, she tried again, took a wobbly step, then dropped down. Crying out a series of bleats, she couldn&#39;t figure out why she was unable to stand up. Forgetting about getting into her closet, she turned her head, which now looked less like a human&#39;s and more like a goat&#39;s, and stared backward, thinking there was something off.<br />
<br />
Fur, white with black splotches, started to grow the rest of the way up her now four legs and cover her body as Holly peered backward, struggling to focus her thoughts. After a moment, it slowly came to her that her pants had shifted down and what looked off was that she had a tail poking out. Bleating, &quot;That&#39;s just great,&quot; she found she still didn&#39;t understand out why she was unable to stand on two legs and looking back at the door, she tried to figure out how to open it, even as she realised she had no idea what it was she wanted in there, only that it was important she get it.<br />
<br />
A series of bleats escaped her as she voiced her frustration, anger, need to punish her sister, and her own horror at what was happening, and trying to stand again, she found the best she could do was place her front hooves on the closet door. Staring at it, wondering if maybe she could bite and twist the handle, she uttered a bleat of surprise when suddenly the door to her bedroom slammed open and a masculine voice exclaimed, &quot;What in the hell?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dropping to all fours, Holly turned, scared, but then found herself relieved when she saw her daddy standing in the doorway. Trotting over to him, bleating out, &quot;Daddy, daddy. It&#39;s me, Holly. You&#39;ve got to help me. Dion did this to me. Please. Help me. You got to do something.&quot;<br />
<br />
But then her relief disappeared as her dad swore then spat, &quot;Dammit, Taylor,&quot; before reaching out and grabbing Holly by one of the horns, whereupon he proceeded to remove the pants she had on and, after working it for a moment, tearing the shirt up the back until he could force it off her.<br />
<br />
Embarrassed that she was now nude in front of her father, Holly tried to twist away, still bleating. Her father tightening his hold for a moment, promptly let go of her, turned and stormed out, muttering what Holly thought sounded like, &quot;Damn Taylor. Trying to dress up the animals in clothes. What is wrong with that girl. Can&#39;t she just be content to do it with her plush animals,&quot; before his voice was cut off by the closing of her bedroom door.<br />
<br />
Alone in her room, Holly peered down at the pants she&#39;d been wearing and the torn remains of her shirt. Pawing at them, wanting to put them back on, but at a loss to understand why, Holly stopped when she saw the fur now covering the rest of her front legs. Looking back at her body, she uttered a series of bleats in surprise when she saw not her usual self, but the fur covered body of a young goat. Twisting her head one way, then another, she lifted her leg and stared at her male goat parts before shaking her head and bleating out, &quot;No. I don&#39;t want to be a goat,&quot; and beginning to tear about the room, headbutting things, kicking at the furniture, her mind slipping a couple more notches down into the animal she had become, Holly tried to figure out how not to be a goat, somewhat certain her sister was the reason she was.<br />
<br />
The door abruptly opening again, Holly paused for only a minute before she lowered her head and pawed at the floor. Her mind under able to fathom that the person standing in the doorway was her father, she angrily bleated, sure the person was somehow responsible for her predicament. Rushing forward to headbutt them, she was suddenly stopped when they brought a knee up into her, then forced a rope around her neck and proceeded to drag her out of the room. Struggling, her hooves sliding, Holly bleated, &quot;No. I don&#39;t want to go. I need to stay. I need to change back. I want to be to me,&quot; but found her attempt ineffective as she was drug downstairs, outside, and toward a pen, where she was placed.<br />
<br />
Her father, after he had checked to make sure the gate was secure and that door that allowed the two goats access into the shed hadn&#39;t gotten jammed shut again, stared at the male. Watching as the ram butted the walls, the gate, looked at him and bleated, Martin had the weirdest sensation of familiarity come over him, like he was looking at his brother or sister. Shaking his head, unable to explain the feeling, he turned away, muttering, &quot;They belong to Charlotte. She wanted them, so she needs to deal with Taylor dressing them in clothing,&quot; before walking back to the house<br />
<br />
Inside, he headed upstairs to collect the clothing his daughter had dressed the ram in. Intending to hand them to his wife, Martin stopped outside the bedroom as once again he felt the strange sensation slip over him again. Rubbing his face, trying to shake it, he pushed open the door, and stopped when he saw the usually empty room. Mind trying to fathom what was going on as he stared at the unmade bed, he muttered, &quot;Wasn&#39;t this room decorated, occupied, minutes ago,&quot; and not seeing the clothing he stripped off he goat, he started to leave, confused, but stopped when he saw something glittering on the floor. Entering the room, he stepped over to the object and stooping down to pick it up, he saw it was an old looking necklace.<br />
<br />
Outside, Holly sniffed he air as she paced back and forth in the pen. In the next pen over she could smell the randy female goat, which caused her boy parts, to her alarm and horror, to grow hard, in addition to the smell of the shed she was now expected to sleep in. Bleating her woes, the female not answering her cries, Holly stopped and peered at the house she had been taken from. Wanting to go back, she started pacing again, trying to bully her mind into working out a way she could turn herself back, and wanting more than anything to get revenge on her sister for what she&#39;d done.</p>
