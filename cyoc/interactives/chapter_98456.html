<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After Nate eagerly participated in Alex&#39;s &quot;experiment&quot;, the two werewolves cuddled together on the bare floor of what once was supposed to be a home gymnasium in the basement of Alex Ramsey&#39;s basement.<br />
Each gently stroked his lover&#39;s fur with a tender paw as they exchanged occasional kisses.<br />
&quot;I have to be honest with you,&quot; Nate finally said, looking Alex right in the muzzle. &quot;While I knew long before I ever got to act upon these feelings that I was gay, I never thought it would be this good.&quot;<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; replied Alex, before kissing Nate on the muzzle. &quot;While for better or worse you&#39;re not my first, you are the first man I have really felt any connection to.&quot;<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; asked Nate, surprised to hear that.<br />
&quot;Think about it,&quot; suggest Alex, as he held Nate tighter in his furry arms. &quot;Although I didn&#39;t have my first change until after my thirteenth birthday, I was born a werewolf, and have lived in Moon Lake all my life. You on the other hand, longed to be one, and I was the lucky guy who got to welcome and change you. That alone would have been something special in and of itself. But then the rest of that fantastic night we had, on top of finding out I was your first, I feel has really started to forge something truly special between us.&quot;<br />
&quot;This might be a bit too soon to ask, but do you mean as in the proverbial &#39;happily forever after&#39;?&quot; asked Nate.<br />
&quot;Who knows? There are not that many homosexual werewolves in Moon Lake to begin with, and you&#39;re definitely the first guy in a long time I&#39;ve ever felt something serious for, beyond being a casual fuck during pack orgies,&quot; admitted Alex.<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot;<br />
&quot;For me, I had a feeling I was gay the summer before I started high school. There was this girl, who was also a werewolf, who thought I was cute.&quot;<br />
&quot;I can see that,&quot; commented Nate, while nuzzling Alex&#39;s neck.<br />
&quot;Anyway, she finally convinced me we should go on a date together, but her parents thought she was too young, so they insisted that her older brother chaperone us.&quot;<br />
&quot;Let me guess. Turns out you were more interested in him than her.&quot;<br />
&quot;You got it,&quot; confirmed Alex. &quot;Unfortunately he was straight and seriously not interested, and once she figured it out, the girl quickly dumped me as if I had mange or something, but at least by then I had my act together and realized what road my heart needed to follow.&quot;<br />
&quot;And your parents were cool with it from the start?&quot; asked Nate, remembering his recent worries about how he was going to tell his folks about his personal preferences.<br />
&quot;Well, I admit that I did have the standard &#39;how to I tell them&#39; angst; but when I finally did, they said as long as I was happy, and didn&#39;t force myself on anyone who wasn&#39;t willing, we were cool.&quot;<br />
&quot;I am definitely more than willing,&quot; said Nate, as he reached down with one paw to start stroking Alex&#39;s cock within its sheath.<br />
&quot;I can tell,&quot; replied Alex, as he performed the same gesture on his boyfriend.<br />
&quot;But I have to ask. I know now how a normal gets inducted into were society, but what happens when a naturally born were has their first change?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, depending upon what kind of a were you are, you&#39;re automatically considered a member of your parents&#39; group, pride, or whatever; even though you don&#39;t attend any meetings until after you experience your first change. In this case, my folks are members of our pack too, although you didn&#39;t get to meet them during your induction ceremony, because until that night, I didn&#39;t know of your preferences. Austin never got the chance to talk to me until about a half hour before the meeting started.&quot;<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; asked Nate.<br />
&quot;We were out of town that Friday night. My mother was born normal, and we had gone to visit her mother, who lives a couple of hours from Moon Lake and doesn&#39;t know weres exist outside of Hollywood,&quot; explained Alex. &quot;If it wasn&#39;t for the pack meeting, we would have stayed there the whole weekend, and not come back until Sunday night.&quot;<br />
&quot;Then we might never have met,&quot; realized Nate.<br />
&quot;But we did stud,&quot; said Alex, before kissing his new boyfriend again. &quot;There&#39;s only two other gays within our pack, but Austin told me they just started dating each other and weren&#39;t interested, which left me the <b>very</b> lucky wolf who got to usher you into your new life. Anyway, getting back to things. Depending upon when a naturally born were has their first change, it&#39;s basically a group gathering to give all the other members a chance to say &#39;welcome&#39;. There might be some kind of celebration afterward, but otherwise it&#39;s pretty routine, compared to the formal induction of a normal.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, I am very glad we met, and whatever happens, I hope we&#39;re together for a mighty long time,&quot; confessed Nate, before kissing Alex again. &quot;Besides, our budding relationship gives me the chance to do stuff like this.&quot;<br />
Then Nate moved his head down and began to lick his boyfriend&#39;s red rocket.<br />
<br />
With Nate&#39;s lower end now near his muzzle, Alex quickly started returning the favor.<br />
Soon, the two werewolves were rubbing their furry bodies together as each tried to lick and suck as much of his lover&#39;s shaft as they could. Tails started thumping in anticipation as bodies tensed, and moments later each boy&#39;s oral efforts were rewarded with the taste of their mate&#39;s masculine nectar.<br />
Despite having already come together, Nate and Alex continued pleasuring each other in hopes of obtaining even more from their lover, when suddenly the lone door to the unfinished gym opened.<br />
Nate froze in shock, with Alex&#39;s hard penis deep in his muzzle, as he looked up and saw a middle aged man standing in the open doorway.<br />
&quot;Hello,&quot; he said. &quot;You must be Nathaniel Anderson. I&#39;m Mister Ramsey. Alex&#39;s father. Our son has told us a lot about you. You boys must have been having some great fun, for you seriously lost track of the time. Dinner will be ready in a half hour. Alex can show you where the bathroom on this floor is to clean up in. I&#39;ll see you both at supper.&quot;<br />
Never once did the man raise his voice or lose his calm composure. Then Mister Ramsey closed the door, even as Nate continued to stare at it. Alex&#39;s penis had slipped out of his mouth, and his boyfriend&#39;s cum dripped off the edge of his muzzle fur while Alex continued to eagerly suck Nate&#39;s cock.<br />
Yet, even as Nate shuddered in pleasure from another orgasm, he continued to stare at the closed door.</p>
