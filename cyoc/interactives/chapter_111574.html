<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You shift in your seat. It&#39;s not really made to accommodate a tail of any kind, let alone one longer than your height twice over. You turn your body to face the large, red draco tail. Its scales-- your scales-- shimmer in the weak overhead light of your fan. You have the vaguest sense of control over it. If you don&#39;t consciously think about keeping it still, it naturally sways and lifts off the ground slightly. You can feel your body sway in rhythm with it, unable to overpower the muscles inside it. You sigh at how much maintenance it is. A thought wanders through your mind, what if you had the correct body to control it? But.. that&#39;s a dragon. The thought of becoming quadruped doesn&#39;t appeal to you. However, you don&#39;t want to get rid of your tail. Turning back around, you face the Chronovac and decide to explore the options available to you.<br />
<br />
You&#39;re in the tails section. Going back a page, you&#39;re back in the body parts section. You&#39;re greeted again with all sorts of appendages. You groan, going down the list of possible body-part changes. From the size of the list, you figure it&#39;ll take all day to select the dragon options in each category. Even then, that would leave you as a feral dragon! In frustration, you scroll back to the top of the list. You figure there&#39;s no way around it, if you want to keep the tail, and make it manageable. You go to the first category, and almost select it. Before you do, you notice there&#39;s a check-box above it. You face brightens, and your dragon tail thrashes around violently in reaction to your mood change. The check-box simply states, &quot;Change all-body parts&quot;. You happily check it with more than a little excitement. It may not help you find a way to not end up on four legs, but it does seem to save some time. Immediately, the page turns white, and all the body-part categories fall away.<br />
<br />
You&#39;re silent, waiting for the Chronovac to do something. Minutes pass, and with it your excitement. Your red tail even ceases it&#39;s idle movement and lay completely still. A few more moments, and suddenly a feeling of dread washes over you. It&#39;s not crashing, because the program window itself still works fine. Still, another thought. What if you&#39;re stuck like this? If your tail was smaller, you could deal with it. You look behind yourself again. The tail itself is no longer swaying or twitching by itself, but its sheer size alone is enough to reach all the way to the door and back!You frown and slowly turn yourself back to face the computer screen.<br />
<br />
Again, your large dragon tail thrashes about the room violently, knocking over anything incapable of resisting its sheer force. You couldn&#39;t care less about the state of your room however, as the Chronovac appeared to work again! You look the new menu up and down, scrutinizing everything after being held back from doing so immediately. It&#39;s actually a pretty simple interface.<br />
On top of everything, it&#39;s your name. Below it, are what look like two fields of text, with the first one occupied. It simply says, &quot;Human&quot;. Below the first, it commands &#39;enter species&#39;. Understanding the gist of what the Chronovac is asking for, you enter &#39;dragon&#39;. At this entry, your computer hums for a second, and a slider appears between the two text fields. On both sides are numbers. 100 and 0. You experiment with the slider, and watch each number rise or lower depending on how far over you drag the slider towards it. You quickly understand. It&#39;s given you an option on how much of a dragon you want to be! Relieved at your second problem resolved, you move the slider to 50-50. With that, you wonder how you&#39;ll initiate the changes.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, you feel the similar burning sensation like before. But instead of just above your rear-end, it&#39;s your entire body. The intensity of the burning is too much, and you squeeze your eyes closed. You writhe and toss yourself out of the computer chair, which gets caught up in your tail and flips over. You can feel every part of yourself shifting, part by part, as if someone or something were quickly going down a checklist. Now on the floor, you feel horns burst out of the side of your head, and hear them scrape loudly against the varnished wood. You try to save the wood and lift your head, but almost fall back down as your face explodes in a slender reptilian muzzle. You grit your teeth at the sudden weight of a larger face just as they sharpen to a point and interlock. Without your consent, your eyes burst open by themselves. The room goes amber a brief moment as your sclera shifts to a deep dragonic orange. As your eyes quickly become slitted, you see the red-scales on your new dragon snout burst downward, converting any flesh it touches into more of itself. You bring your hands up in front of you just in time. In a single moment, they morph into a clear mix between man and dragon, staying dextrous, ruby-scaled and ending in sharp and threatening claws. Your forearms swell in dragonic strength as your elbows grow small boney claw-like appendages that bend with your arms. You can feel muscles swell everywhere. Your growing biceps naturally flex underneath your scaly exterior as you hoist yourself up off the ground with your new found strength. Once you stand, you breathe in just as involuntarily as you opened your eyes, which you still can&#39;t close, and feel your torso expanding a great deal.<br />
<br />
 Looking down, you watch your clothes give up and completely rip away, unable to contain your rapidly increasing size. You nearly lose your balance as you watch the ground grow away from you as you bulk up. Your front torso is now covered in darker, redder and fleshier underbelly scales. You suddenly have the feeling of something pulling at your back, through the burning sensation. Craning your neck behind you, you watch as small, hand-like appendages push out from your back. After a few seconds, they push out until they match your new arm length, The fingers grow long and tendril, tapering to thin points. At the same time, a fleshy material stretches between each finger, ending at your back. Reaching their full size, they involuntarily shiver, which is oddly cold against the burning sensations you&#39;re feeling right now. It quickly folds into your back until you can see over your shoulder again. As your wings finish folding up, you watch your large tail slowly slide back into you, shrinking in circumference slightly, before finally shortening to about the length of your new body height. Before you can appreciate its new size, you feel a strong tugging on the opposite side of your body.<br />
<br />
 Curious, you turn back forward and look down at the feeling. You gasp in surprise as your penis bursts forward like your tail, easily doubling its length. Through the continued burning sensation, you can feel slight pleasure as it thickens considerably. It takes on a darker hue than the scales around it and remains skin like. It tapers just a bit, but still retains its bell-end. As you make a mental note of your new penis, your bright orange eyes widen as it begins to split right down the bell end. Little by little, your penis splits in the middle, rounding off each half until you possess a new and heavy set of penises. Unceremoniously, they pull up into you, into a genital slit, indicative of most reptiles. Unlike your penises, however, your balls continue to hang in between your legs, scaled in the same soft scales of your underbelly. Still looking down, you see your feet finish altering. The best way to describe them now would be how similar they look to dog&#39;s hind legs.<br />
<br />
With that, the burning sensation stops. Now free from the intensity of the transformation, you find yourself standing in the dead center of your room. It feels almost too cold now without the heat. You walk back towards your desk and your computer. You pick up your overturned computer chair and set it right. You make a note of how incredibly easy it was to simply lift it with a single hand and place it down the same way, as if it was as light as your phone. Speaking of which, you bend over and pick up your cell phone after letting your old tail knock everything it could down. Inspecting it, you use the screen&#39;s reflectiveness to gauge how you look now. As you stare intensely, you see a wide faced, ruby-colored dragon stare back through the phone. Your eyes glow, emitting the slightest amount of light, making them appear very piercing. The orange lava-like sclera and pitch-black slitted pupils did nothing to counter this. Your horns are big and white, curving back like a ram, but not able to get the first loop.  Baring your teeth gives you a view of all your new dentures, pure white and unstained by food or drink.<br />
<br />
Ditching the phone, you look down at yourself once more. Without the intensity of the burning, it&#39;s clear to see how much muscle you&#39;ve gained. If  you didn&#39;t have a six-pack before, you sure do now. It&#39;s easier to see your muscles through the scales on your underbelly, but you can make them out on your legs and biceps as well if you look hard enough. You can&#39;t really see your wings or tail more than turning your head, but their locations are way more manageable now that you have the backspace to hold a tail and a pair of wings. Looking down, you look at your genital slit. A bit unused to it, you&#39;re reminded of a vagina in it&#39;s appearance. However, the weight of your balls manages to pull it downwards slightly, making it look more like a sheath, not that you&#39;d be used to that either. As for your testicles themselves, they sag at around orange size, being considerably big on you, but perhaps rather small on an actual dragon.<br />
<br />
You stretch, making the bones crackle in your new anthro dragon body. Your tail lifts up slightly and stretches with you. You feel very warm, despite the cold of the room. Unsure, you think about what you can do now.</p>
