<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rachel took a deep breath.  “Before we do anything, I’m going to ask again.  Are you absolutely sure you’re going to be OK with anything I might do to you?”<br />
<br />
This was a question I could have answered in many ways, most of them wrong.  So I simply said, “I trust you.”<br />
<br />
“Alright, then,” she said.  “Lay down on the bed.  I need to test something first.”  I did as she asked.  I had an idea of what she wanted to do, so I made sure to spread my legs open.  She smiled briefly only to suddenly look stern.  “Oh, so my little bitch thinks she’s in control?” she asked with anger in her voice.<br />
<br />
I honestly didn’t know what to do.  I started to say, “No, it’s just that…”<br />
<br />
“It’s just what?” she cut me off.  “That you think you can read my mind?  That I’m about to listen to you?  Take that shirt off!” she ordered.  I didn’t hesitate to oblige her request.  Meanwhile she stripped out of her bra and panties.  “Get closer to the edge, and keep those legs open.”  I shifted myself down to the edge of the bed.  I put my feet on the floor but made sure to do as she told.  “Oh, no,” she said.  “Get those feet back on the bed.”  I moved back up the bed just enough so that my feet sat on the very edge of the bed.  “Finally,” she said.  At this point her act was really confusing me.  She was speaking in such a way that I felt she was honestly mad with me.  But I had to admit feeling turned on by it. <br />
<br />
“Now let’s see what we have here,” she said.  She walked to the end of the bed and stood in between my open legs.  She held up the first two fingers on her right hand for me to see.  Then she slowly lowered them toward my groin.  Much as I expected, she inserted her fingers into my pussy.  Immediately I felt a jolt throughout my body as my head fell back onto the bed.  A few seconds later I felt something very strange inside me.  I looked up again and saw Rachel remove her fingers.  She pointed to a spot on her fingers about halfway down.  “That’s how far,” she said. <br />
<br />
She bent over and I saw her pick up the dildo.  Not only was this dildo close to a foot long, it was also very large around.  I couldn’t imagine an actual penis looking like that.  Her expression became one of disappointment.  “Doesn’t look like your pussy is quite ready for this yet,” she said.  As intrigued as I was by how it would feel, I was relieved to hear that.  “Too bad,” she said.  Once again her expression turned to one of anger as she forcefully jammed the dildo into my pussy.  I screamed out, mostly in pain, but undeniably somewhat in pleasure.  To put it simply, my pussy wasn’t yet big enough for the dildo, but that did not stop Rachel from forcing it into me as much as she could.  After she thrust it back and forth a few times, my screams grew less painful and more pleasurable.  “See, I knew you could take it,” she said unapologetically.<br />
<br />
Considering I still had a tiny penis, I was amazed at how much pleasure I felt.  After all, the most sensitive part of a woman wasn’t inside my pussy yet.  I do think that her actions still caused my penis to feel the pleasure.  I definitely felt pleasure within my incomplete pussy as well.  To feel that kind of pleasure both internally and externally was amazing.<br />
<br />
Even though the dildo couldn’t be put to full use, it was still more than sufficient to cause me to climax with a loud scream.  “There’s my little bitch,” Rachel said with a twisted smile.  “Scream for me, my little bitch.”  That was a command I had no choice but to obey.  Once I began to feel normal again, Rachel removed the dildo from my pussy.  “Let’s see how you taste,” she said and she inserted the dildo into her mouth.  She moved it in and out seductively as if she were giving a blow job.  “Mmm,” she said.  “I like your taste.”  I took this moment to relax and my legs slipped down and my feet hit the floor.  “Oh, no,” she said.  “I’m not nearly done with you.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, god, what now?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“Remember how Joyce and I were laughing at you in the hallway?” she asked.<br />
<br />
I replied, “Yea, sure.”<br />
<br />
“Well,” she began.  “You’re developing quite nicely.  In fact, you’ve already got what some might call ‘child-bearing hips.’”<br />
<br />
I thought for a second and then said, “Wait.  Isn’t that an insult?”<br />
<br />
“All depends on how you take it,” she said.  “I don’t think of it that way.  To me it means that you’ve got curves.  Or, rather, you will.  You’re not quite done, after all.  But didn’t you notice yourself walking differently?”<br />
<br />
I honestly had no idea what she meant.  “No,” I said.  “Not at all.”<br />
<br />
“Trust me, you were,” she said.  “So were your brother and Carl.  You’re all walking like women now with that slight sway in your hips.”<br />
<br />
“Really?” I asked.  “That’s weird that I wouldn’t notice.”<br />
<br />
“I think that’s a good sign,” she said.  “It shows that things are coming to you naturally, instinctively.  You don’t have to think about making sure you look feminine, you just do.  On that note, let’s move on.  Your curves don’t just happen in your hips.  They happen in your ass, too.  And I must say, Joe, you have grown one pretty fabulous ass.  In fact…” she stopped talking as she bent over and picked something up from the floor.  At first I couldn’t tell what it was.  But when I saw her take what looked to be a pair of crotchless panties and put them on, I became acutely aware of what awaited me.  She continued, “In fact, that ass is so fabulous that it’s time for you to get fucked in it.”  She took the dildo and affixed it to the panties.  Once it was connected she proudly put her fists on her hips and asked, “What do you think of this?”<br />
<br />
I looked at the way the dildo hung down from the panties and said, “It looks like you grew a penis.”<br />
<br />
She looked down at herself and laughed.  “I suppose it does,” she said.  Then she turned serious again.  “But now nice time is over.  Move up the bed and get on all fours!” she barked.  At this point I felt so completely submissive that I responded right away.  I flipped myself over and crawled up to the head of the bed.  A second later I felt Rachel get on the bed behind me.  “Now I am truly going to fuck you like the bitch you are.”<br />
I had no idea what to expect now.  So I acted instinctively and tensed up as I waited for her to begin.  However, she could tell that I reacted that way.  “Trust me, bitch, when I say that you need to loosen up for this,” she warned.  I tried to do as she told, but I just could not relax properly.  I heard her sigh loudly and then she said, “Suit yourself.” <br />
<br />
I felt the tip of the dildo rub against my ass cheeks.  I liked the feeling it produced, but at the same time it made me tense up again.  Rachel continued to tease me with the dildo for a few more seconds.  Then she placed her hands on my hips and locked them under her control.  The next sensation I felt was undoubtedly unlike anything I had ever felt in my life up to that moment.  I felt the dildo enter my ass and force its way steadily deeper.  I cried out in pain.  There was no pleasure at all in what I felt.  “I told you to relax,” she said angrily.  “I’m not stopping.”  As the dildo penetrated deeper my cries grew in intensity.  I noticed that they grew steadily higher in pitch.<br />
<br />
Rachel began to thrust back and forth.  This felt worse than the initial penetration.  I felt tears coming out of my eyes.  “Oh, please,” I whimpered.  “Please.  Please stop.”  My voice was most certainly higher all of a sudden.<br />
<br />
My pleas fell on deaf ears.  “Absolutely not!” she shouted.<br />
<br />
“Rachel, please,” I begged.<br />
<br />
“No!” she yelled.  However she did not just yell at me.  She also took her left hand off my hip and slapped me very forcefully on the ass.  I yelped out in alarm.  I could feel a stinging sensation in my ass cheek.  But something else happened as a result.  I lost focus on the dildo inside my ass.  I no longer felt any pain there.<br />
<br />
“Do that again!” I said.<br />
<br />
“What was that?” she asked.  I couldn’t tell if she didn’t hear me or if she didn’t believe what I said.<br />
<br />
“Do that again, please!” I repeated.  She didn’t need me to ask again.  I felt another stinging wallop on my ass.  This time when I cried out there was a clearly pleasurable response.  Before I could ask for another one, she slapped me again.  “Do the other side, please!” I cried.  She obliged with two successive, equally hard slaps.  I realized that I was able to enjoy the experience now.  I was no longer feeling any pain from the dildo.  I instinctively began to thrust back and forth along with Rachel.  Soon we were thrusting in perfect unison.<br />
<br />
“There’s my good little bitch,” she said as she slapped me on each cheek again.  Each time I cried out appreciatively.  “And just think about it.  You’re not even a whole woman yet.  You don’t have any tits.  Imagine how this is going to feel when you have two glorious, round tits hanging down from your chest.  They’ll be so nice and soft.   You’ll be able to play with them and stroke them as I’m doing this to you.  You like the sound of that, don’t you, bitch?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, god, yes,” I moaned.  “I want my tits.  I want to have two big tits for you.”<br />
<br />
She slapped me on each cheek again.  “Of course you do,” she said.  “You want whatever I want you to have.  And with these nice, broad hips, and this big, round ass, you’re going to have two big tits.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, yes, I want them,” I said between squeals.  I was truly at her mercy.  I would have agreed with anything she said.  Somehow I was able to notice that with each new squeal, moan or scream that came out of my mouth, my voice was consistently higher.  Was my voice finally starting to change as well?<br />
<br />
Rachel’s intensity didn’t let up.  I knew it was just a short matter of time before I had another orgasm.  I started to bite down on my lip until I bit just a little too hard.  I could feel both my knees and my elbows buckle.  I knew that once I came I was going to collapse on the bed.  Rachel had actually stopped slapping me and had taken hold of my hips again.  Her thrusting increased in intensity when she did this.  The pain I felt earlier did not return, however.  “Come for me, you little bitch!” she commanded.<br />
<br />
I complied immediately.  I let out an assuredly feminine sounding scream of delight and, just as I thought, instantly fell face down on the bed.  Since we were still basically “connected,” Rachel fell on top of me.  Even though I had lost some of my size, I was still bigger than her, so she didn’t cause any pain.  If anything I loved the feeling of her breasts pressed into my back.<br />
<br />
After a minute or so I felt the dildo come out of my ass and Rachel rolled off my body.  “So how was your first time?” she asked.<br />
<br />
I still couldn’t lift myself off the bed.  “Like you don’t know,” I said into the bed.  My voice was extremely muffled. <br />
<br />
“What?” she asked.<br />
<br />
I mustered up enough strength to roll onto my side and look at her.  “Like you don’t know,” I repeated.  Rachel’s eyes opened a little wider.  So did mine.  We were both surprised by the sound of my voice.  It had definitely grown higher pitched.  I cleared my throat and as normally as I possibly could, I repeated, “Like you don’t know.”  Rachel chuckled in amazement.  “Are you happy?  You broke my voice!” I said as I began to laugh as well.<br />
<br />
“Don’t get used to it,” she said between giggles.  “I’ll bet it’s going to keep changing.”<br />
<br />
I couldn’t really describe exactly how I sounded now.  I’d never had the deepest of voices as a complete male, but I could never sing high notes either.  I figured that my voice had to be somewhere between a high male and low female pitch right now.  “It’s funny,” I said.  “I don’t feel different, like in my throat or anything.”  I ran my hand up and down my throat and neck.  I could still feel a lump.  “Still got the Adam’s apple,” I said.  Just as I was about to take my hand away, I felt a sharp prick on my neck.  “Ow,” I said.  “The hell?”  I looked at my hand and saw that my fingernails were growing out over my fingertips.  A quick glance at my other hand showed the same development.  I held them up for Rachel to see.  “I hope this means you don’t have to repaint them.”<br />
<br />
“Everything’s starting to change so fast now,” Rachel remarked.  “And there’s still so much more to come!”</p>
