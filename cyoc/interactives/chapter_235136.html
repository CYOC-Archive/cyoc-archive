<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;What about me transforming to be your leggings?&quot; He winks at her. Alice&#39;s eyes light up. &quot;Oh, that sounds great! I would love to be able to wear you as my leggings.&quot; She leans in and gives him a kiss. &quot;But for now, I want something that is much more extreme and kinky.&quot; That leaves Jake surprised. &quot;Oh, I didn&#39;t expect that! What do you want? And what could be more extreme than transforming into a fuck machine and an artificial pussy to have intercourse?&quot;<br />
To find the words for this, Alice thinks for a moment. &quot;I want to be an automaton. A real automaton that is only made to experience orgasms when the users does some specific action on it. And I want you to operate me.&quot; She looks at him with a serious expression. &quot;But not with my own mind. I want to be that automaton. And I want to be that completely. There should be no trace of anything like rational or emotional thought, no processing of my impressions beyond the experience of orgasms, no personality, nothing except the experience of the orgasms that I have when you have operated my controls accordingly. I don&#39;t even want to have the desire to be operated by you or the desire for further orgasms, just the pure experience, nothing else.&quot; She tries to keep looking him in the eyes to express her seriousness. &quot;What do think?&quot;<br />
Jake is taken aback by Alice&#39;s request. He didn&#39;t expect her to want to be an automaton, completely devoid of thought or personality. But as he looks into her eyes, he can see the seriousness and desire there. He takes a deep breath and nods. &quot;I&#39;ll do it. I&#39;ll transform you into an automaton, just like you want. But I have to warn you, this is a big step. Are you sure you&#39;re ready for this?&quot; &quot;Absolutely! From our experiments and our last transformations I know that the Transform-O-Matic is safe and I trust you completely to bring me back to be myself.&quot; Alice is relieved that Jake is willing to grant her wish. &quot;I just don&#39;t know what kind of construction I want to be. Above all, I want to function very simply. Just something that you can operate very simply and that then automatically has an orgasm. Almost like when you turn on the light.&quot; She adds: &quot;And I want to be that thing for about 15 minutes. And I want you to make me orgasm at least five times. Would you do that for me?&quot; Jake nods, still a bit hesitant, but willing to grant Alice&#39;s wish. &quot;Yes, I&#39;ll do it. Let&#39;s find a simple construction for you to be. How about a music box? You could be a music box that plays a tune when I wind it up, and when the tune is finished, you have an orgasm.&quot; He looks at her, hoping this idea meets her requirements. &quot;Thank you!&quot; She kisses him. &quot;But not something so complicated. I mean something as simple as pressing a button and voila: an orgasm.&quot; Jake is almost a little surprised. &quot;OK, so just a box with a switch that I press and that&#39;s it?&quot; Alice is really relieved. &quot;Yes, that simple. Or is that too stupid for you?&quot; &quot;No, no. I&#39;m just wondering if that wouldn&#39;t be boring for you.&quot; He looks at her questioningly, but Alice says: &quot;No, not if it&#39;s only 15 minutes. I&#39;m sure of it.&quot; &quot;Okay. A simple housing with a single control element. Can I add a display that shows me whether, like, you&#39;re having an orgasm?&quot; Alice thinks about it. &quot;Well, if it&#39;s just a light that flashes, then fine.&quot; Then she thinks the concept over again briefly. &quot;I think you should also have fun operating me. Why don&#39;t you suggest something we can add to this automaton so that you really want to use it.&quot; Jake thinks for a moment. &quot;How about I can adjust the intensity of your orgasms? Maybe with a slider or a dial?&quot; He looks at her, hoping this idea meets her requirements. &quot;And I can also add some sounds, like moans or screams, when you have an orgasm. Plus a counter that shows how many times I&#39;ve made you orgasm? That way, I can try to beat my own score.&quot; He smiles, hoping this idea meets Alice&#39;s requirements, thinking this could be fun for both of them.<br />
Alice hesitates. &quot;Well, that breaks the concept a little. I mean, I don&#39;t want to do anything, make anything, not even really exist, as a person or entity or whatever it&#39;s called.&quot; Jake reassures her. &quot;Yes, I know that. I don&#39;t mean that you, as the automaton, should do something. It can happen completely automatically, like the lamp.&quot; &quot;Well, if you think we can get the settings so that I don&#39;t notice anything, then I&#39;m OK with that. But how are you going to collect points and beat your high score? I&#39;m not going to be a game.&quot; Jake grins. &quot;Why not? Let&#39;s do it like this: Instead of a push button, a slider and the light, you get a touch display on your surface on which I have to solve a sliding puzzle. You know, the ones where you have to move squares back and forth until they form a picture again. And the fewer pieces I move and the faster I solve the puzzle, the more points I get and at the same time your orgasm will be more intense. But if I don&#39;t manage to solve your puzzle within, hmmm... let&#39;s say three minutes?... So, if I don&#39;t manage to solve your puzzle in three minutes, then I don&#39;t get any points and your orgasm will just be a pleasurable feeling. By the way, do you also want to feel when I move the puzzle pieces? We&#39;ll have a chip installed in you for this puzzle game and everything that operates this part of you, but it has to run completely independently of the orgasm part. Does that sound good?&quot; Alice is amazed. &quot;Yes, that sounds great! Provided I don&#39;t know anything other than that I&#39;m being operated and having my orgasms. And yes, if your moving my puzzle pieces around doesn&#39;t make me orgasm, then I want to feel you moving the pieces. I&#39;m curious to see what that will feel like.&quot; She giggles sheepishly. Jake reassures her. &quot;Look, I&#39;ve already entered that into the text fiel of the software and the preview that&#39;s shown here looks pretty good.&quot; He shows her the screen and Alice studies what she sees next to the picture of a kind of simple handheld game console. &quot;Yes, you&#39;re right. It also says that the puzzle is placed in a separate part of the machine as specially isolated subroutines. And that the routines of my mind are completely reduced to the experience of pleasure. Good, good. Do you like the design?&quot; Jake laughs. &quot;At the beginning you wanted to be a box with a button and now you&#39;re asking me if I like the design! But yes, you will look very good.&quot; He still can&#39;t suppress a giggle. Alice giggles now too. &quot;Well then, let&#39;s do it like that. Oh yes, and change it so that there is no time limit, but you can only transform me back when you have solved my puzzle at least three times in a row in less than a minute.&quot; Jake raises an eyebrow. &quot;Three times in a row in less than a minute? Well then I hope your game chip gives me a chance! You know what, just to be on the safe side I&#39;ll set a time limit of one hour. I don&#39;t want us to have to test how unpleasant a retransformation is when I have to carry you out of the energy field of the Transform-O-Matic because I can&#39;t solve your puzzles fast enough.&quot; Alice looks at him a little disappointed. &quot;Well, so that you feel better about it. But I don&#39;t want me to know anything about this!&quot; Alice lies down on the bed and looks at him expectantly. &quot;Come on, transform me!&quot; &quot;Just a sec.&quot; Jake adds what was just discussed and clicks on the field that starts the Transform-O-Matic. He watches as Alice is scanned as usual. &quot;I&#39;m looking forward to play with you!&quot; Alice murmurs a contented &quot;Oh yes, me too!&quot; while the transformation beam has already half transformed her into this computer game.<br />
For Alice, this transformation feels wonderful once again and she is also very excited about what it will be like for her when her mind is not only adapted to the object she is becoming, as in the other transformations, but is also practically completely reduced to her sexual pleasure. And she also wonders what it will be like when she and Jake cannot communicate with each other for the first time because they do not have activated Mental Link. But before she has even finished thinking this thought, her physical transformation is complete and the Transform-O-Matic sets her mind to the way Jake set it on her behalf.</p>
