<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ric and Josh kept looking through the book, all the way to Alex's house.  They saw Mr. Mendes getting fatter back at the house, and found his clothes in shreds on the floor of the living room.  How fat had he gotten?  The boys were worried they had made him so large that he was trapped in that little bathroom.<br />
<br />
  Ric especially looked concerned.  It was him who had read the spell after all.  He thought he could make out most of the reversal spell now, but they needed to test it.  He looked at his younger brother.  &quot;Josh.  I'm going to read the spell again.  We need to be able to test the reversal spell.&quot;<br />
<br />
  Josh looked at him &quot;Who are you going to use it on?  We can't make some stranger fatter...&quot;  Ric just shrugged his shoulders and made a face.  &quot;Well, I was thinking of using it on...&quot;  He looked at Josh.<br />
<br />
  Josh coiled back from him &quot;No way, you aren't doing that to me!  You're the one who made Mr. Mendes fat.  If you're going to use the spell, you should use it on yourself!&quot;  Ric gulped.  Josh was right.  It was only fair if he was the one they fattened.  What if the reversal spell didn't work though?  He'd be stuck fat forever!  Just like Mr. Mendes.<br />
<br />
  &quot;Maybe we should use it on someone else.&quot;  Ric said, a bit flushed in the face, as they walked up the steps of Alex's house.  Before they even knocked on the door, it opened.  Alex stood there grinning.  &quot;Hey guys!&quot; <br />
<br />
  Alex was 13 years old, and kind of chubby.  He and Ric were in the same class, and had been for a few years, so they had become good friends.  &quot;My parents are still off on their cruise, so they put Mark in charge.&quot;  Alex said while making a grimace.  Josh and Ric walked in &quot;They're still gone?  How many weeks have they been away?&quot; Alex thought for a second &quot;About 4 I think.&quot;<br />
<br />
  Mark, Alex's older brother, was taking care of him.  He was 21, just home from college for a while.  Josh and Ric hadn't seen him in a year or so.  They heard heavy footsteps coming into the living room.  Looking over, Ric and Josh hardly recognized the person standing there.<br />
<br />
  A broad shouldered, muscular young man stood there.  Josh thought he was nearly as big as Mr. Mendes' friend Marco.  After a few moments, they realized... it was Mark!<br />
<br />
  &quot;Hey, fatboy.&quot;  He said as he walked by, scruffing his little brother's head.  &quot;Don't go in the pool, or use the kitchen.  I'm going to go take a nap, and I don't want a disaster, k?&quot;  Alex groaned out a yes as his brother retreated back into the living room and fell back on the couch.  The boys went upstairs to Alex's room.<br />
<br />
  Ric spoke first &quot;Geeze, what happened to Mark?  He was fat a while ago, wasn't he?&quot;  Alex nodded &quot;Yep.  He went to school and got interested in bodybuilding, now he's skinny.  He keeps making fun of me though.  You think he'd be nicer since he was fat before...&quot;  Ric then had a thought  &quot;Have your parents seen him since he was back?&quot;<br />
<br />
  Alex shook his head &quot;Nope, he's only been home 3 weeks.  He wants to surprise them when they get back.  I was at my grandmothers place till then.&quot;  Ric grinned wide and pulled the book out of his backpack.  Josh looked at him shocked &quot;Ric, no!&quot;  Alex just sat there looking confused.  Ric was half listening to his brother.  &quot;Alex, how much does he make fun of you?&quot;  Alex groaned.  &quot;Constantly.  Every conversation he tells me how fat I am, and all that stuff.&quot;<br />
<br />
  Ric grinned again.  &quot;You know, college students who live away from home seem to get fat.  He sounds like he deserves it Josh.  Plus, his parents don't know he was buff, so when they see he just got fatter, they won't be surprised!&quot;  Ric stood up and took the book with him, creeping out of the room.  Alex and Josh following behind.  It was too late though.  Ric was looking over the bannister on the stairs down into the living room, reading the spell.  He stared down at the muscular co-ed, snoring away.<br />
<br />
  &quot;Now we wait.&quot;  Ric said.  The boys watched intently, the changes were subtle at first, but soon became more and more evident. Marks flat belly was starting to grow rounder.  His body was thickening and softening.  Soon he had gained 50 pounds.  Then 100, looking like his old self, his round stomach rising and falling.  150 passed....  200... and it stopped.  There was mark, snoring still, nearly 150 pounds bigger then he'd ever been.<br />
<br />
  &quot;Allright... now the moment of truth....&quot;  Ric read the reversal spell that they had tried to restore.  &quot;let's see if this works...&quot;</p>
