<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kellie looked on and was amazed and what she was witnessing.  In all her years, she never thought that her daughter, her only child, aged a couple of years in a span of a few seconds.  And to think that the ring she used the ring to age her body for a little bit.  Kellie could tell that this ring is powerful stuff and that of all the people that would obtain such power, it is in the hands of Katie.  If she had that ring, she could do whatever she wants.  She could give people second chances in life, return an elderly person into a youthful adult or kid, change a child to a responsible adult in no time, or many other options.  The possibilities seem endless at that point.  But the more she thought of what that ring would do, the more she thought of something for herself.  Something she never had.  A family.<br />
<br />
See, Kellie never had a mother, or a father, or even a sibling.  She was orphaned when she was just a little baby and raised at an orphanage.  And although the caretakers were nice to her, no one outside that orphanage had ever taken her in; giving that the building was full of other orphans.  As years passed, she knew that her chances to be with a family were starting to get slim.  Which is why she decided to start studying and prepare for the outside world in case things didn’t went her way.  By the time she was twenty, she left the orphanage to took side jobs to help pay for rent and going to college.  She chose an attorney position for her degree to help those in need and juggled work and studies and a day-by-day basis.  After all that sacrifice, she managed to graduate and applied for a position as a lawyer, which helped her work her way up to the top of the attorney ladder.  Still, she felt that she would have the support of her family, but she never had one at the start.<br />
<br />
Sure her life was easier now that she had a stable life, but she never had a family that supported her since day one.  Hell, she wasn’t even married to begin with, she had a one-night stand with a client after a case and the two were drinking and they made out in her home.  He soon left her, but not until she discovered that she was pregnant with Katie and had to raise her herself, since then, she was balancing work and mother life as her body was taking a toll on her.  Though she covered it up nicely in her professional lawyer suit, and make up, it still wouldn’t change the fact that she was older then she looked.  Her C cup breasts were sagging and she had a muffin tuff on her waist with a round belly.  Her muscles were a little flabby as varicose veins appeared on her arms and hands.  Her face had wrinkles around her eyes and mouth as her eyes looked a bit puffy and tired.  And her hair, which was done up in a bun, has a few gray streaks woven into it and it looked a little dull.  So she was pretty much a middle age woman at that point.<br />
<br />
She only wished that she would start off fresh and raised by a family, then maybe she can live a happy life.  But it was just a pipedream as there’s no way her wish would be granted.  But when Katie showed her mom the ring, then that wish should be granted.  It would be the only opportunity to let her start her life over and raised right.  But who will be her mom and dad?  Who would raise her when she is reborn and look after her?<br />
<br />
Looking towards Katie, she soon realized who the mother would be.  Katie has always looked up to her mother since she was a toddler, and considered her to become the role model for her.  So if Katie can be the mother, then it seems like the wisest of option.  But for Katie to become her mother, which would mean that she had to give up her childhood.  Is it something that Katie would want?  To leave her innocence behind to become a full-grown woman?  Hell, she didn’t even let her know that Katie has never had grandparents in her life.  Would she be prepared for that type of responsibility?<br />
<br />
“Mom?” Katie said with confusion, “Is everything okay?  You seem to have spaced out when I showed you the ring I got.  Is it because you saw me growing?”<br />
<br />
Kellie snapped out of it as she turned to look at an older Katie with a look of concern.  Seeing her, she cleared her throat and said, “What?  No!  It’s nothing.  I was in deep thought is all.”  She soon thought about what she was thinking and decided to let her in on an important favor.  “As a matter of fact, can I speak to you of something?  Something very important?”<br />
<br />
Katie looked to her mother in confusion and wondered what she wanted.  “Sure thing mom…” she said still perplexed, “What do you want to talk about?”<br />
<br />
Kellie took a deep breath and decided to let her in on her own wish.  “Katie, do you ever wondered what happened to your grandparents?  Why you have never seen them?”<br />
<br />
Katie heard her question and remembered asking constantly why she never seen her grandparents.  She always had seen other kids with their grandparents, yet she had never seen hers since she was very young.  “Yeah…” she answered back, “I remember wondering about that.  Why you ask?”<br />
<br />
Kellie knew that now was the time in explaining and said straight away, “That’s because you never had grandparents.”<br />
<br />
Katie’s eyes blinked and were starting to process that sentence in.  “Wh… What?”<br />
<br />
Kellie lifted her hands up and explained about that.  “Now, now, hold on.  Let me explain.  See, your grandparents, my parents, left and abandon me at the orphanage since I was born and I never knew my mother and father.  I grew up all alone and was never raised by a family since, even more so when anyone that would like to adopt never picked me.  But no matter what, I always work hard to try to survive on my own, which is why I studied hard to get a job as a lawyer, so I can live a life and be independent.  But there was no mom or dad that would support me, as I did all of it myself.”<br />
<br />
Katie heard this and was shocked to know that her mom never had a family in her life.  There was no wonder why she never had grandparents before.  But there is one question that still remains and asked her, “But what about dad?  Why have I never seen him?”<br />
<br />
Kellie heard her say this and knew she would get around that question.  But she was strong over this and told her the truth.  “That’s because your father was just a client of mine in order to solve in important case.  I was able to win it and we celebrated at a bar.  We had a little too much to drink and…  Well…  One thing leads to another I guess.  He left the day after while I was getting through with work.  That was until a few months later when I found out I was pregnant.  And with your father left to his home far away, I decided to raise you myself when you were born.”<br />
<br />
Katie thought of that with her maturing mind and realized that her mom kept so many secrets from her.  Yet she never explained it until now and didn’t think she would let it all out.  “That explains a lot.  But why haven’t you told me any of this before?”<br />
<br />
Kellie sighed and answered, “Because I don’t know how you would respond to that.  I never wanted you to feel upset by this and would blame me.  But giving that the rind made you older, I suppose that you understand it now more then your younger self.”<br />
<br />
Katie though decided to ask her about that.  “That doesn’t explain to me why you never told me of this.”<br />
<br />
Kellie could see her loosing her patience and decided to let her in on the secret.  “That is because that I have spent my entire life living without a family.  I had never known what it would be like to be raised by a mom and dad.  To be taught and fed.  To be protected.  To be a real family.  I try to give you a family myself but I could never keep up without someone to be a dad.  Regardless, I only wanted to restart my life, so I could have a family.  But would never have one, as it was impossible.  That is until now.”<br />
<br />
“Huh…?” Katie asked a little confused.<br />
<br />
She soon turns to her daughter and pointed to the ring on her finger.  “You got a ring that can change anyone’s age on a wish and would make people’s lives easier.  You can make my wish come true.  If you wish for me to be reborn with a family, then I will have a far better life then what I have.”<br />
<br />
Katie heard her and realized what she wanted.  She wanted a family that she had never had and would want to be reborn into that family.  She could imagine how hard it was for her to get through with life without someone by her side.  And with the ring in her possession, perhaps her mother would get a second chance in life.  Still, the one question remains is that who would raise her when she’s born?  What’s going to happen to Katie if her mother gets reborn?  Those are the questions she wanted to know.<br />
<br />
“But who’s going to take good care of you when you are born?” she started asking, “Who’s going to be the mother and father?  And what’s going to happen to me?”<br />
<br />
Kellie started to have a smirk on her face and she answered her back with the obvious of responses.  “Isn’t it obvious Katie?  It’s you who will be raising me when I’m reborn.”<br />
<br />
Katie’s eyes grew wise as she responded the best way she could.  “What?!  But…  Why mom?”<br />
<br />
“Because you always loved me.” Kellie answered back, “Ever since you were born, you have always looked up to me and thought of me as a role model.  I always work so hard in order to support you day after day and you always wanted to be like me when you grow up.  Well, now that you have that ring in your possession, you can make both our dreams a reality.  All you have to do is wish for you to be an adult and me your unborn baby, perhaps all the way back when I’m just an egg, that way we can have what we want.”<br />
<br />
Katie heard that and was surprised of what her mother wants.  Not only that she wants to start over with a family, but also having her own daughter to be the mother of her.  It was completely surreal at that point, especially with how she could approach the wish.  For her mother to go all the way back before she is conceived, that’s a dangerous risk, even for her.  But then there’s the father as Kellie did state that she needed a family.<br />
<br />
“But what about the father?” Katie asked her mom, “What am I going to do if there’s no dad for you to have?”<br />
<br />
Kellie gave it some thought and said; “I think you can get creative with finding a husband.  There are a lot of men in the city you can find.  Maybe go on an online site.  Maybe even use the ring to make a husband out of one of your friends.  There are many possibilities.  But we should worry about changing the both of us first before you can think of a husband.”<br />
<br />
Katie heard that and decided to worry about one thing at a time.  “Okay Mom, whatever you say.  So how do you want the changes?”<br />
<br />
“What?” the mother said raising an eyebrow.<br />
<br />
“I mean, how do you want us to change?  Do you want it to be instant?  Or is there a specific time limit for a slow change?  And what about any mental changes or clothing and reality changes?  I can’t just make a wish without giving it some specific details.” Katie explained.<br />
<br />
Kellie thought of that and wondered about it.  So there are options on aging or regressing.  She didn’t expect that to happen.  But if there are ways in changing the ages people, she needs to think of a way in making it work.  So thinking it through, she looked to her daughter and said, “You know what?  Let’s get creative.  Why don’t we age and regress to our designated age at midnight.  I mean I know it’s only almost four and it’s a long ways, but I want to experience the changes minute by minute.  To help see myself getting younger bit by bit.  I’m certain that it would be a fun experience.  As far as the other options, maybe we have our minds regress and progress as well, but make us aware of the changes with the ring.  So we don’t forget anything, even after the changes are finished.  The clothes and reality ones though I don’t think we need.  After all, if you look like me and can take my job as a lawyer, than maybe they won’t know the difference.  Course you need to go around with my name so people won’t get too confused.  And I have plenty of clothes that would fit you since you will be an adult.  Though for now, I guess you can wear an extra large shirt if you want.  Would all that be okay?”<br />
<br />
Katie heard every word she said and decided to leave it at that.  “I suppose that would work, mostly.” she responded.<br />
<br />
Kellie smiled and decided to get this over with.  “Then, what are we waiting for?” she asked, “Let’s get started!  I can’t wait to restart my life all over again with an actual family.”<br />
<br />
Katie smiled and knew that her mom really wants this so much.  And even if it means sacrificing her own childhood, then it would be all right. So looking to the ring, she closed her eyes and started to make the wish<br />
<br />
“I wish and I would age up to an adult woman of thirty and my mom to regress into my stomach and before conception all the way up to midnight.  And I want are minds to match that of our changing bodies, but also let the two of us be aware of the changes that are happening to the two of us.  I would also wish that my mom would remain as an egg until I find a man so I can start conceiving her, making her part of our family as well.  Please make my wish come true.”<br />
<br />
The ring than started to glow as it granted Katie’s wish.  The two soon felt a chill in their bodies as they spread from head to toe.  As the chill stopped, Kellie was a little confused and said, “Whoa…  That was weird.”<br />
<br />
Katie looked to her mom and said, “That’s how it feels every time you make a wish on yourself or anyone else.  You get use to it.”<br />
<br />
Kellie than looked to herself and didn’t notice anymore changes that are happening yet.  “I don’t see anything happening yet.” she said in disappointment.<br />
<br />
Katie looked to her and said, “Well, you did want the changes to keep going until midnight.  Give it a few hours and maybe you will notice some drastic changes.”  She than looked around and wondered what to do until the changes are complete.  “So…” she started to ask, “What do you want to do while we change slowly.”<br />
<br />
Kellie rubbed her chin and wondered what to do while she regresses and her daughter ages slowly.</p>
