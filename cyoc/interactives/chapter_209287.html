<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff was aware of a strange sensation that washed over him. Believing it meant the timer had finally expired and that he was about to transform back, he thought, &quot;Now you&#39;re going to pay you little dip face,&quot; as he tried to mentally prepare himself for any discomfort he might feel as he changed back.<br />
<br />
To his surprise, the room around him vanished and he was overcome with a sensation he could only describe as a sudden movement. Whisked away, he mentally screamed, &quot;Dammit, Tyler. What have you done,&quot; as he wondered where it was he was being sent.<br />
<br />
Darkness was the first thing he was aware of. Knowing he had stopped moving, that he was lying on something hard, Jeff wished he could move, call out, doing anything. Regretting his choice of turning himself into a sex doll, hating his younger brother for fooling around with stuff that wasn&#39;t his, Jeff silently cursed to himself as he attempted to sort out what would happen when the timer he&#39;d set ran out and where it was he&#39;d been sent. Failing to come to any sort of answer, he let his mind drift as he tried to determine how long he&#39;d been trapped in the current form he was, but having no sense of time, nor any way to measure time, his only knowledge of any time passage lie in what he&#39;d witnessed when Tyler had altered himself by giving himself various tails, then turning himself into some weird female animal-human freak.<br />
<br />
What seemed like minutes, might have been hours, but Jeff didn&#39;t know as he lay on a shelf in what he would&#39;ve been surprised to know was in his girlfriend&#39;s closet. When the strange sensation started to creep over him a second time, his thoughts automatically leapt to, &quot;At last,&quot; as he figured that this time, it must mean he was about to change back.<br />
<br />
A pressure built up all over him and instead feeling like he was transforming back, Jeff was concerned when it instead seemed like he was being twisted, compacted, stretched, and lengthened. The moment passed and he stiff found himself in darkness, unable to do anything. Wondering what had happened, unaware that what he&#39;d felt was due to his sister and her friend altering his profile, Jeff began to panic. Starting to believe he was trapped, that somehow Tyler was to blame, he started to mentally scream, &quot;No, no, no, no. I don&#39;t want to be trapped like this. I don&#39;t want to spend the rest of my life as a sex doll,&quot; and struggling to make himself move, he was startled when he sensed rather than heard a door open close by.<br />
<br />
Except for his sense of what he felt, none of his senses he was alarmed worked. He couldn’t see, hear, smell, or taste anything, but, in a rather odd way, like he was picking up on vibrations, he was able to tell when the door opened and an artificial light clicked on somewhere over heard as the rumbling of a voice uttered something. His new senses telling  him the speaker was female, Jeff tried to figure out what she&#39;d said, but found he was still unused to processing things the way he now did. Feeling himself picked up, he had the strangest idea come over him as it seemed he felt, floppy, limp, as more of those vibrations he took to mean speech washed over him.<br />
<br />
Denise stared at the double headed pink dildo, unsure where it&#39;d come from. She had a modest collection of self-pleasure items, but nothing that was the lurid shape of the thing she found, nor with looked like a thick, bulbed penis on one end, and a spiked dick on the other end. Thinking both could be titillating, she hefted it, found it was a decent weight, and headed over to her bed. Looking at the bedside clock, seeing it showed the time was almost eleven pm, she knew that her mum, dad, and three siblings were fast asleep and she shan&#39;t be disturbed if she tried out her find. Setting the sex toy on her bed, she reached around back, unclasped her bra, stuck her hand up one of the short sleeves of her shirt, fiddled about, and after a moment, pulled the undergarment out through the other sleeve. Tossing it into a laundry hamper in the closet, the sixteen year old girl unbutton her pants and lay down on the bed.<br />
<br />
Still getting used to everything, Jeff couldn&#39;t begin to fathom the plethora of information that bombarded him as he felt himself moved about in various ways before he was put down. Feeling something soft beneath him, he was able to tell it was a bed, which was confirmed when, moments later, the surface shifted, dipped, and someone lay down on it. Feeling himself picked up, he wanted to scream when suddenly it seemed like part of him was thrust into what he could only describe as a round, wet cavern. Sensing a soft, feminine sound, it took him a moment before he understood it was a sensual moan. Realising that what he was experiencing was someone starting to play with him in a sexual manner, he wondered, &quot;Why can&#39;t I see it the same way I was able to before?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dildo sliding in and out of her mouth, Denise relished how great the bulbed end felt. Licking it, nibbling on it, he reached down with her free hand and teased her breasts through the soft fabric of her t-shirt. Wanting to garment off, she stuck the sex object in her mouth, sat up, and pulled the garment up and over her head, frustrated for a moment when the shirt caught for an instant on the thing in her mouth. Her C cup breasts exposed to the cool air of the room, she lay back down, reached for the waist line of her pants, and pushed them as well as her panties down and off. Naked except for her socks, she kicked the garments from the bed before she returned her attention to working the dildo in and out of her mouth with one hand as, whilst with the other, she teased her erect and sensitive nipples a moment longer before she traced her fingers down her abdomen and across her almost bare groin. Moaning as felt herself getting more and more turned on, she eventually took the thing from her mouth, flipped it over without a second thought, and used the spiked end to begin tease her clit.<br />
<br />
Aware in his own way of the movements, able to determine the noises he felt where sounds of sexual excitement, Jeff was still worried by what was going on, and what would happen. Terrified that this was to be his new life, he sensed himself being turned about and a part of him rubbed against something. The vibrations of noises getting more and more intimate, personal, Jeff sensed he knew what was going to happen. And then it did as he experienced himself coated in a viscous fluid and thrust into what he could only imagine must be a vagina, hoping at the same time it wasn&#39;t an anus. Feeling himself moving back and forth repeatedly, he was unable to stop himself as he thought, &quot;Holy shit. I being used to help someone masturbate.&quot;<br />
<br />
Turned on beyond anything she&#39;d thought was possible, Denise moaned with pleasure when the barbed head of the dildo finally slid past her slick folds. Thrusting back and forth with it, her arousal grew and grew, until it suddenly came crashing down and she heard her boyfriend&#39;s voice exclaiming, &quot;Holy shit. I being used to help someone masturbate,&quot; and gasping, both at the sound of Jeff&#39;s voice and the feel of the sex object inside her, Denise stopped and propped her self up.<br />
<br />
Legs spread, palms pressed firm into her bed, the teenage girl looked about her room. Not seeing Jeff or anyone else, but still scared to move, she called out, &quot;Jeff?&quot; after a moment in a tentative voice.<br />
<br />
He was starting to get used to how his new senses worked. Able to tell the vibrations he &quot;heard&quot; was a voice, he was able to determine after a bit it was his girlfriend calling his name. Not giving it a single thought to what he was doing, Jeff thought, &quot;Yes, it&#39;s me. I&#39;m here. Somehow, I am here.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was the last thing she&#39;d expected. But when her boyfriend answered her, Denise suddenly wanted to cover herself up. Feeling exposed the way she was, she reached down and gingerly extracted the dildo. Gasping as the barbs rubbed in a gentle manner against her slick, sensitive folds, she grasped the thing tight as she stood and went to fetch a robe. Putting it on, she searched the room, calling out, &quot;Where are you? And why are you in my room?&quot; but got no answer.<br />
<br />
In her hand, Jeff felt himself flop about and could tell by his new senses what his girlfriend was asking. Telling her, &quot;I&#39;m here, in what I assume is your hand.  My brother Tyler did this to me,&quot; he was disappointed when he didn&#39;t get an answer.<br />
<br />
Both of them confused, Denise wondered if she&#39;d imagined hearing Jeff&#39;s voice as the boy-turned-dildo tried to suss out how it was that he&#39;d been heard in that one moment. Telling herself she hadn&#39;t imagined it, Denise was unable figure out where Jeff was, but certain that, somehow, he was close. Deciding she wanted a  hot bath to think it over, she looked down at the sex object. Still not sure where it&#39;d come from, she decided to take it with her, figuring, if nothing else, she&#39;d clean it off. Feeling himself moving, Jeff still had no idea how it was that the girl had heard him, but a sneaking suspicion began to creep over him that it had something to do when she&#39;d thrust him into her vaginal opening.</p>
