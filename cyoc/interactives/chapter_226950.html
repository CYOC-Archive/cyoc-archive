<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Edward sighed as his son was spending more time playing with his food than eating it. The two year old cougar cub giggled and screamed as he flung a couple peas from his paw; landing on his father’s muzzle as he sat trying to give the boy some apple sauce while being assailed with tying green balls.<br />
“The food is supposed to go in your muzzle, not everywhere else;” the anthro red fox fury sighing. He gags as another pea is thrown at him and lands right in his throat. This caused the cub to squeal with delight as Edward coughs to expel the foreign item from going down the windpipe.<br />
“I don’t remember your big sister being this difficult,” Edward sighing as he manages to get his son to take a spoonful of sauce; “she liked peas.”<br />
<br />
“Your memory must be hazy,” a female cougar entering the kitchen; carrying a large binder with the label family photos. Sitting down she open up the binder pulling out a photo of Edward when he was human. At the table like he is now with a small girl; sitting in a high chair with peas and diced carrots all over the place.<br />
“Now if only I managed to get a picture of our daughter at this age throwing spaghetti at you,” Julian laughing as she hands the photo to her husband. “I’m going to digitize these and create an album for Allison,” she adds; “I don’t want her to forget who she once was. Or that we were once human.” Julian sighs as she flips back a few pages and pauses at a picture of her and Edwards wedding.<br />
“Ahhh,” Julian sighing as she examines the white wedding dress she was wearing thirty years ago; “if only we could were clothes. I bet I could still fit in this.”<br />
<br />
Edward puts down the photo of their daughter and looks at the one Julian just handed to him.<br />
“If I recall,” Edward getting hit with more peas; “I tore this dress off of you once we arrive at the hotel. Your father was not happy as he was hoping to resell it,” Edward grumbling; “he thought we wouldn&#39;t last. Penny pinched at everything at the wedding,” Edward remarking as he gets a few peas into his son by hiding them in the next spoonful of apple sauce.<br />
“Dad was just frugal,” Julian countering as she looks at the very first photo of Alison. Taken just a few hours after she was born; swaddled in a white blanket with a pink cap. The new born baby was being held by Julian as she looked haggard and worn out in the hospital bed. “But he did love Alison,” Julian getting teary eyed; “it felt like yesterday that this photo was taken.”<br />
“Didn’t I take this picture,” Edward smiling at how tiny their daughter was when she was born; “I think I still have that old camera. Say what you will,” Edward turning back to his son; “reel camera is some of the best obsolete tech to have. They don’t need batteries like a digital camera.”<br />
<br />
“See if you can hunt that camera down then,” Julian closing the book; “and if there is any film left, we can use it to take some pictures of Adam splashing in the bath.”<br />
“Oh goodie,” Edward smiling as their son perks up at the sound of his name; “a chance to make a bigger mess! First the kitchen,” Edward picking up his son, “now the bathroom!”<br />
“Fetch the camera,” Julian pulling their son from Edwards hand-paws; “I’ll handle our cub.”<br />
<br />
************<br />
<br />
“Found it,” Edward speaking as he walks into the bathroom after spending twenty minutes in the closet pulling down boxes of old paperwork and nick nacks. Holding the generic film camera with the black nylon strap slung over him. If Edward was irritated with the synthetic material pressing onto his fur, he kept it to himself. Looking at the bath tub was his son splashing happily as Julian sat in with him. Her legs holding him steady while he flails his fury arms about, laughing as he makes the water splash about. Julian smiles as she gently restrains him from accidentally smacking her sensitive fury breasts.<br />
“Look here Adam,” Edward holding up the camera as he waits for his son to turn his head. A small click could be heard as he flicks a dial before pressing another button and another click could be heard. He puts down the camera just as Julian takes a small dollop of shampoo and begins to lather it in her son’s fur. Making sure to get the product behind his ears and under his arm’s before getting a cup and gently pouring water over Adam’s head.<br />
<br />
Another click could be heard and Edward puts down the camera.<br />
“That’s the last of the film on this role,” He comments; “but I can’t remember what the camera was used for last.”<br />
“Get the film developed and we’ll find out,” Julian pulling the drain plug to the tub. Adam stares at the tiny whirlpool of water forming above the drain as the water flows out of the tub.<br />
“Here,” Edward picking up Adam and getting him out of the tub; allowing Julian to safely climb out. Edward’s runes glow as he places a hand paw on Adams back; watching as his son’s fur dry as the water rapidly evaporates thanks to magic. “All dry,” Edward smiling as his son starts to get fidgety and eager to run and explore. Edward glances up to see Julian’s fur drying as she used the same magic spell on herself. Getting a good view of his mate’s crotch; her legs slightly apart giving him a tantalizing tease to her feline entrance. Edward could sense his arousal as he felt his shaft grown as his pulse quickens.<br />
<br />
“Let’s get our son to bed,” Edward growling with arousal; “I want to rail you hard.”<br />
“Later,” Julian smiling as she places a fury finger on her mate’s muzzle; “Adam left a mess in the kitchen. Plus I’m not ready for you to bed me just yet.”<br />
“Grrrrrrr,” Adam not understanding what his parents are saying; he just mimics the growls as if it was fun game to play.<br />
“And I don’t think our son is ready for bed just yet either,” Julian smiling though her feline muzzle;  causing some of her sharp teeth to show as she scoops up her son; “Lets watch cartoons on T.V while dad cleans up the kitchen.”<br />
“He didn’t eat much, I leave out the apple sauce if he get hungry in an hour or so;” Edward following his mate as they head to the living room that is now more of play room thanks to an assortment of toys designed to stimulate a child’s developing senses. “I don’t have the strength to sustain another artillery barrage of peas.”<br />
“Hahaha,” Julian laughing; “you better gather your strength tomorrow then daddy. Because you will soon be assailed with carrots,” Julian mockingly commenting as she places him in a play pen while sitting on the sofa just next to him.<br />
“Oh no,” Edward feigning shock; “not the carrots! Anything but the carrots!” Edward smirks as he walks into the kitchen to clean up his son’s latest mess.</p>
