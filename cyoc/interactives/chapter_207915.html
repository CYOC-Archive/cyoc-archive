<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Gym?&quot; Jeff texted Finn the next morning.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah man. Want me to meet at your house?&quot; Finn texted back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
Finn felt himself sigh. &quot;I want to try something with that Chronivac thingy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah man, we gotta be careful.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will be,&quot; Finn smiled. &quot;I&#39;ll be over in a minute and then we can ride together.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Finn headed down to his Hummer and started the engine. &quot;Good morning Finn,&quot; the car spoke to him. It caused him to jump a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mornin&#39; Todd,&quot; Finn said as he buckled his seat belt. It hugged his burly frame perfectly. &quot;I&#39;m going to Jeff&#39;s then the gym. Got it?&quot; He didn&#39;t know why he felt like he needed to announce it, it just felt awkward that he was technically inside another guy. <br />
<br />
&quot;Understood,&quot; Todd said. &quot;I love it when you drive me places.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ye-yeah?&quot; Finn asked. They were already leaving his neighborhood and headed towards Jeff&#39;s. &quot;It feels good?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It feeeeeeeels sooooo gooooood...&quot; Todd moaned. &quot;Your big hands are so gentle on my insides. I can just feel your body pressing against mine. Like a hug. But more. And... Ooooo...&quot; Todd moaned again. His voice was cutting through the static. But Finn hadn&#39;t noticed that his hand was gently rubbing against the shifter. &quot;That feels so gooooooooooood...&quot;<br />
<br />
The hummer bucked and Finn made sure to hold on with all his might. It almost sounded like his engine burst. &quot;What the fuck!?&quot; Static filled the radio for a few seconds. &quot;Todd? Todd what the fuck just happened.&quot; Slowly the static disappeared and Todd&#39;s voice returned.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m still not used to all the stimuli. It&#39;s hard to control myself with you inside me...&quot;<br />
<br />
Finn took a moment to breath, realizing what his hand had been doing. &quot;Right. Sorry about that...&quot; he said. <br />
<br />
&quot;No need to be sorry,&quot; Todd replied.<br />
<br />
Finn rolled his eyes. &quot;Alright. But you&#39;re a secret. Alright? Jeff doesn&#39;t get to know about you.&quot; Without a word, the radio station switched to some country music. <br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br />
<br />
Finn pulled up and walked into Jeff&#39;s house. &quot;Hey! You almost ready?&quot; he shouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Almost,&quot; returned Jeff. &quot;Just gotta finish breakfast.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright. I&#39;ll be in your room. I wanna test something.&quot; Finn was already up the stairs before Jeff was hot on his tail.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aren&#39;t you at least going to tell me what it is?&quot;<br />
<br />
Finn shrugged his heavy shoulders. &quot;I just want a more portable version. That&#39;s all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Portable? How?&quot; Jeff asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;As in my phone,&quot; Finn waved his phone a bit and then went to Jeff&#39;s computer. &#39;I have a Chronivac in my phone.&#39; &quot;See?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... Okay. I guess that makes sense. But I really don&#39;t think we should be using it too much,&quot; Jeff warned.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;ll be fine...&quot; Finn rolled his eyes as he watched the bar fill up. He looked at his phone to see that it was already loaded in.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br />
<br />
The two drove to the gym in Todd. Finn wondered if it felt better now that there were two guys inside him, instead of one. &quot;What are you so smiley about?&quot; Jeff asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it,&quot; Finn continued to smile as they pulled up into the parking lot. The two headed inside and changed into their gym clothes. Jeff always looked amazing. His red sleeveless shirt and black shorts contrasted with his white fur perfectly. And with his wide shoulders and thick chest he made sure to push his clothes to the limits. Even though his shorts were a bit stretchier, they hugged his ass perfectly, molding around the two massive globes. <br />
<br />
Finn loved working out with the tiger. Even if he wasn&#39;t nearly as built and tone, his bulkier body still could carry a good amount of weight. And being around the sweaty tiger was always fun. As they warmed up, Finn&#39;s eyes caught someone staring at them in the mirror. &quot;Looks like you&#39;ve got yourself an admirer,&quot; he joked, pointing to the man staring ever so slightly.<br />
<br />
Jeff looked up, and the guy&#39;s eyes instantly darted away. A smirk appeared on his face as the man cautiously looked back in their direction, but shifted his gaze again when they&#39;re eyes met. &quot;He&#39;s kind of cute,&quot; Jeff chuckled. &quot;Little small, but the Chronivac could fix all that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? And waste it on that guy?&quot; Finn&#39;s jovial tone shifted to something more angry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why not?&quot; Jeff shrugged. &quot;Make him a big sexy lion or panther. Or maybe even a bull or horse! Then we can really see what happens.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe...&quot; Finn grumbled. His eyes were following the other guy now, not letting him leave his sight. There was an obvious glare as he stared. The guy was obviously feeling a bit of unease and headed back into the locker room. &quot;I&#39;ll be right back...&quot; <br />
<br />
Jeff rolled his eyes as he continued to warm up. &quot;Don&#39;t do anything stupid...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I won&#39;t...&quot; Finn said. &quot;Just going to the bathroom.&quot; Even if Jeff didn&#39;t believe him, he wasn&#39;t about to stop him either. Finn entered into the locker room to see the guy refilling his water bottle. &quot;Hey there big guy,&quot; Finn leaned against the wall. His large imposing ram build made him hard to miss. And judging by this guy&#39;s shaking hand as he filled his bottle, it was obvious that he noticed.<br />
<br />
&quot;He-hey,&quot; he kept his eyes forward. <br />
<br />
&quot;I saw you looking at my friend out there,&quot; Finn crossed his arms against his chest. &quot;You interested?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Inter-rested?&quot; the guy gulped. &quot;I don&#39;t know what you mean...&quot;<br />
<br />
He tried walking away, but Finn was quick to intercept. His body was a natural wall that this man could not pass. &quot;The tiger. Real big muscular one. Has a hard time finding clothes that fit him properly and a cock that&#39;s impossible to miss.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; he was keeping his eyes low, trying his best not to look intimidating in the slightest.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know... He did call you cute. But if I was wrong, then sorry bout that,&quot; Finn went to turn around and waved. Though he felt the back of his shirt grabbed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cute?&quot; The man&#39;s grip tightened. &quot;He said I was cute?&quot;<br />
<br />
Finn knew he&#39;d reeled him in. &quot;He did. Once he saw you, it was all he wanted to talk about.&quot; The man&#39;s face went beat red as his hand twisted Finn&#39;s shirt. <br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really,&quot; Finn confirmed. &quot;You know. I can get you real close to him. He&#39;s a pretty wild guy. And loves to have sex. I can make sure that you&#39;re the one around that cock though.&quot; He paused for effect, watching the man&#39;s face squirm under the implications. &quot;Only if you want me to, that is...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?!&quot; Excitement filled his voice as he finally looked Finn in the eyes. <br />
<br />
&quot;Really,&quot; Finn confirmed again. &quot;Just let me text him real quick.&quot; Finn told Jeff to come to the locker room, but then opened up the Chronivac. He instantly started typing. &#39;This man is a jock strap that loves supporting dicks. The bigger the better. His fabric is unbelievably comfortable and resilient, able to last decades without ripping or tearing. Jeff has been using this jock strap since high school and has seen significant gains that he can only be attributed to it. Plus, his loads are significantly larger and more pleasurable when he&#39;s wearing it.&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hehe,&quot; the man giggled. His face wouldn&#39;t drop the smile as he danced in place to the thought of being next to Jeff. &quot;Oh gawd... I feel so awkward...&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; Finn inquired. &quot;How so?&quot;<br />
<br />
I don&#39;t know,&quot; he giggled again. His eyes were eyeing Finn&#39;s cock. &quot;I just... I don&#39;t know. Can I see your... uhhh... penis?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; Finn said, dropping his shorts around his ankles. The man&#39;s eyes lit up. He gasped and lunged towards the exposed cock. His open mouth wrapped around it and instantly started sucking. &quot;Holy--&quot; Finn grunted as a strong arm reached out to support himself on the locker. Blood flowed in, instantly hardening it into a sturdy rod.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry. It&#39; just looks like it could use some support,&quot; the man said. Though, he was starting to look a lot smaller than he had been. Even though there wasn&#39;t much size on him to begin with, he seemed to be getting even smaller. That&#39;s when his hands wrapped tightly around Finn&#39;s waist. He hugged gently against the burly ram&#39;s snuggling his face against Finn&#39;s cock. However, it no longer felt like skin, but rather a soft fabric gently against him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit...&quot; Finn gasped as he saw the man&#39;s arms dwindle away into white straps that held tightly against his body. With the sudden intake of air, the distinct smell of Jeff&#39;s musk entered into his lungs. He took another breath, holding onto the locker for support. The little man was only shrinking more as more of his body wrapped around Finn&#39;s cock and balls. His legs wrapped around Finn&#39;s and did the same. <br />
<br />
The rest of the man&#39;s body turned into fabric that perfectly supported the ram&#39;s cock. It gently massaged the sensitive member back and forth. &quot;Hol-y... Shi--it,&quot; Finn moaned as he got the most sensual rubbing of his cock he&#39;d ever had. It wrapped perfectly around him and it was like a million little hands all rubbing every inch of his cock at once. Not to mention how much heavier his balls felt. They were filled to the brim and ready to unload. He let out a couple of bleats as he tried to hold on. But it was damn near impossible as the jock gently rubbed his cock over and over. <br />
<br />
His body bucked and Finn felt himself lose. Over and over he humped the air until he felt his balls drain into the jock. An obvious yellow stain from years of use was in the pouch. &quot;Really?&quot; Jeff crossed his arms. &quot;So, you found my jock strap...&quot;<br />
<br />
Finn smiled awkwardly. &quot;Uh-huh...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just clean it when your done...&quot; Jeff went back to his workout.</p>
