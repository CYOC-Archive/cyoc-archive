<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;There&#39;s no way these will ever fit me, but I wonder what it would feel like to wear them?&quot; said Ryan to himself. He grabbed the enormous size 18 shoes and sat on the bench, catching a whiff of them as he swung them around. <br />
<br />
&quot;Holy crap! These smell disgusting!&quot; Ryan exclaimed, but for some reason, he felt compelled to smell the shoes again. Pressing the damp shoe to his face, he felt himself get hard. All of a sudden, he felt a rush run through his body, starting with his feet causing him to hunch over the drop the shoe; a thick load of cum launching into his underwear.<br />
<br />
It was a rush like he&#39;d never felt before, and he could swear his underwear and shoes felt ever so slightly tighter, a trick of the mind after that incredible orgasm surely he thought to himself. But he knew he needed more of where that feeling came from, he quickly grabbed the huge sneaker off the floor and planted his face into it again.<br />
<br />
Immediately he felt pleasure wash over his body again, he maintained his grip on the shoe this time though. With every breath he took of the sweaty sneaker he felt intense pleasure rush through his body starting from his feet. He lurched over, spraying load after load into his underwear. &quot;Oh god, yes...&quot; Ryan moaned, grabbing his dick out of his pants and beginning to stroke it. He was taken aback for a split moment as he felt his average 6 inch cock swell slightly larger with each breath, and he was sure his shoes were definitely tighter now.<br />
<br />
&quot;What... uh... the?&quot; he murmured. He looked down and sure enough, his cock looked a bit larger than before, throbbing and growing slightly with each breath, with each orgasm. He wasn&#39;t scared, for some reason this felt right. &quot;Fuck...&quot; he whispered, cum launching out of his growing member again. He kicked his size 9 sneakers off as well as he began breathing deeper into the huge size 18 sneaker in his hand, embracing whatever was happening to him.<br />
<br />
His cock reacted by shooting harder than ever before, Ryan literally gasping with each breath. His cock throbbed and swelled, becoming thicker and longer in his hand. He could feel the head flaring outwards, his shaft expanding. The fingers of his hand were being pushed apart by his members growth. 7 inches now.<br />
<br />
His feet were also definitely beginning to stretch within his socks now. Ryan couldn&#39;t believe what was happening, but it felt too good to stop, too right to stop. His toes were lengthening, tearing open his socks. His foot growing longer and longer. His cock throbbed and pushed past 8 inches as his socks started to tear open. His toes reshaped, becoming long, strong and well looked after. He could also feel his hands joining in with his feet, his fingers growing longer and thicker, his palm widening, wrapping around his expanding cock better. The shoe in his other hand becoming easier to hold. &quot;Oh fuck yes!&quot; he yelled out, feeling his climax approaching. His toes inches out further, longer than any he&#39;d seen before. His sole was catching up by stretching out as well, his feet pushing a large size 12 now. &quot;Uhh, yeah... my big, manly feet...&quot; he thought to himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god!&quot; His cock was around 9 inches long now, his feet pushing a size 14 easily, sliding across the carpet.  More cum shot out of him, his soles growing longer and thicker still, his hands becoming very large for someone his height. Another minute of Ryan grunting and panting passed; 10 inches, size 16 now. &quot;Oh man, here it comes!&quot; he yelled out, the end approaching. He screamed out as the last orgasm hit him, his cock stretching immediately out to 12 inches, his feet shooting out rapidly to a huge, narrow, manly size 18.<br />
<br />
Panting, his brain fogged for a moment, he realised that this was the way things had always been, he&#39;d always been average his whole life, except for his enormous hands, feet and cock. He was the same person he&#39;d always been, now with bigger hands, feet and a bigger cock. &quot;Yeah... Yeah, the guys and the girls have always loved my huge feet and cock!&quot;. A clean set of clothes dissolved over his body, along with a new pair of socks for his feet. He slipped the basketball shoes on his huge boats. A basketball jersey appeared on the seat next to him. &quot;What&#39;s that doing there? I mean I got the feet and the hands to be a basketballer, ain&#39;t got the height and body though!&quot; he thought, ignoring the jersey.<br />
<br />
Another dizzy spell hit him; he remembered now that his enormous feet could also make other people like himself, turning them into what he believed to be more masculine versions of themselves, with bigger hands, feet and cocks. Grinning, he left the store ready to help other guys.</p>
