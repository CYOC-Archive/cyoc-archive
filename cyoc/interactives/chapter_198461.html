<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It is Halloween, that time of the year when costumes and candies are the topics of everyone’s talk. Where people scour the streets in their monster costumes and attires that referenced pop icons like superheroes and villains. And yet, you still don’t have your costume. Lucky for you, there is still a shop open downtown where they sell strange costumes of men as latex suits with related attire.  The shop stank of burnt rubber and alcohol, and the shopkeep is gawking at you like a hungry vulture. Despite the awkward atmosphere, you stayed and rifled through the long rack of latex and costumes. <br />
<br />
One costume caught your eye through a rose-tinted lens. It looked like your old ghost hunting costume. It has the costume and the machine-sucker 9000! A complete set to reminisce nostalgia. You’d buy it if you haven’t outgrown it. You used to wear this costume when you were 9. But you’re 20 and twice bigger than the costume.<br />
<br />
Even though you didn’t say your thoughts, the shopkeeper butted in with a suggestion. He grabbed the hanger beside the ghost hunting costume to give you a latex suit of someone you recognize.<br />
<br />
It’s you from 11 years ago. But a little more dead and hollow. It&#39;s eerie. You looked at yourself as some piece of a hollowed-out bodysuit. Come to think of it. It&#39;s a lot more creepy because of how complete of a replica it is. It even got the right shade of golden hair you had as a child and even the three moles on your left buttcheek. <br />
<br />
You bought the suit, partly because you wanted it to be rid of the shopkeeper&#39;s inventory. You&#39;re glad that you were the one who first brought the suit, and not some complete stranger. <br />
<br />
The shopkeeper told you though, to keep wearing the suit even though it doesn&#39;t look like it&#39;ll fit. You know it won&#39;t fit because you&#39;re too big. But it doesn&#39;t hurt to try… you guessed. <br />
<br />
You came home to see your boyfriend already in his Bunny Waiter costume. He&#39;s got the bunny ears and the shorts with the bunny tail and suspenders that loop around his shoulders. He&#39;s not wearing any polo so you could see the full glory of his toned swimmer body. <br />
<br />
To this day, you wonder how such a perfect man chose someone as plain as you. He&#39;s got the fame and glory, and he chose you. Sometimes, you still wonder if this is just some dream. <br />
<br />
&quot;Caleb, have you got your costume yet?&quot; Gerard asked. <br />
<br />
You hid the costume on your back. He&#39;d be pissed if he saw you brought a costume you can&#39;t wear. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ah! I&#39;m still working on it.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Better find a costume fast. The Halloween party would start at 9 in the evening.&quot; <br />
<br />
You quickly ran to your room and laid the costumes on your bed. Of the two, your interest lies in the latex suit. It&#39;s strange but it&#39;s calling to you. Not in a form you could hear, but something you feel deep in your chest. You&#39;re like a moth drawn to the light. <br />
<br />
You grabbed the latex suit and flipped it over where you saw a slit running from the nape of the neck down to the butthole. You spread it open and the smell of a familiar baby powder hung in the air. It&#39;s the same brand you used to powder yourself before going to school. The inside surface is soft and smooth, just like the bum of a freshly powdered kid. Your hand slid swiftly in their place. Just like the shopkeeper said, it&#39;s tight but you pushed through. <br />
<br />
Then you felt it. It&#39;s that certain tightness that coils around your finger and spreads to your arm. You wore the other arm and you felt the same sensation. It was as if the second layer of latex disappeared. The thin fingers and arms that you are moving are like the real thing. There&#39;s no suit, only you. <br />
<br />
Armed with this experience, you finished wearing the suit. The face took some elbow grease to wear right but you managed to do it. After you finished wearing the suit, you flipped around to see the slit sealing itself leaving only a faint hole at the base of your neck. You put your finger inside. If you move it down, the hole enlarges. But it reseals quickly if you leave it alone. <br />
<br />
You know it is impossible. But it happened and it is here. You could see it and you could feel it. Time ran back to the time when you were a nine-year-old boy. You&#39;re a little small for the age, but you were an early-bloomer down under. If it weren&#39;t for the acne, you were one hell of a cute kid with your smooth pinkish face and lively brown eyes. It was also at the age of nine when you were most active in sports. Namely, baseball. If you still have your baseball costume, which you still do, it&#39;d make for a good costume too. But the ghost hunting costume is a hundred-fold better so you&#39;d rather stick with it. <br />
<br />
Naked down to the bum, you walked out of your room where you saw your boyfriend eating carrot sticks. He turned his head and saw you. At first, he closed his eyes. But in that split second where his eyes met your body, you know he recognized who you are. You were childhood best friends after all. And you had the pleasure of taking a bath with him when the two of you are still young so you two know what each other looks like when you&#39;re naked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit! Caleb, is that you? Ho- how?&quot; Gerard asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;I found this shop downtown selling these latex costumes. Strange, right? I bought a costume that looks like my younger self. I wore it and the next thing I know, I&#39;m nine-year-old again. Also, I didn&#39;t realize you were this big.&quot; Gerard stood up. His crotch is now at your eye level. &quot;Like really big&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I- is this permanent?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Of course not,&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank goodness. I can&#39;t have sex with you when you are this small.&quot; <br />
<br />
You crept up to him, causing him to sit back on the leather sofa. &quot;Is it because you&#39;d look like a predator preying on a child?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s that. But you know how big my dick is. It can&#39;t possibly fit inside you.&quot; <br />
<br />
Even though you&#39;re the submissive one in this dynamic, you are dominant in doing so. And that dominant attitude of yours has this side that doesn&#39;t want to back down from a challenge. <br />
<br />
&quot;Is that a challenge I hear?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh God, not this again.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What are you so bummed about? I know your dick is already itching to get a taste of this plump tight ass of mine.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Were you always this much of a brat when you were young? It&#39;s because you&#39;re touching it!&quot; <br />
<br />
You were indeed touching it. Your small fingers could barely wrap around the shaft. &quot;Oh, was I?&quot; <br />
<br />
You pulled down his shorts. His dick plopped on your face. It&#39;s bigger than half the thickness of your head. And the smell! It intoxicated your pink little nose with the deep stench it mustered. Your mouth is small so you can&#39;t just swallow the entire thing. So you did what you could and gave little licks here and there. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, fuck! It&#39;s even worse when your mouth is small.&quot; Gerard said. <br />
<br />
By worse, you already know that he didn&#39;t mean it in a bad way. It&#39;s worse because it makes him so flustered, which is unbecoming of a man like him. He&#39;s supposed to be strong, and not in a vulnerable pink state. He&#39;s using his palm to cover his face, but he can&#39;t fully hide how embarrassed he looks. <br />
<br />
As for your dick, it was already mentioned how you’re an early bloomer. At the age of nine, you have the dick of a fifteen-year-old. It’s a little bit smaller now but the sensation you’re having is much more intense. It was as if you never masturbated in a long time, and a single breeze is enough to make you cum on your boyfriend’s chest. <br />
<br />
Suddenly, your boyfriend picked you up from the floor. He plopped you on his lap. It was a surprise but you can’t help but anticipate this. You had the reins at the start, but the actual driver is now running the car. <br />
<br />
“I’d be lying if I didn’t think of a scenario like this one,” Gerard said. “You always looked so cute yet fierce when you were young. What changed?”<br />
<br />
“To be honest, I don’t even know.”<br />
<br />
From the sharp brat of the block to someone as plain as flour. How far have you sunk? It’s nice you had the chance of feeling this bratty attitude again.<br />
<br />
Gerard raised your chest and began licking your toned chest. His lips nibbled ever so gently on your nipple. Damn. You can’t begin to put into words how hard your nipples are. And your dick… Fuck!<br />
<br />
“I can’t believe you used to smell this good. Your skin is so smooth my face slides across it easily.”<br />
<br />
Gerard licked his fingers, and slowly with a smile on his face, his index slid in your hole. You braced for it but the sensation still overwhelmed you. A finger was enough to make you cry. You can’t imagine what damage his dick could do.<br />
<br />
“Should I stop?” Gerard asked. <br />
<br />
You collapsed on his meaty shoulders and let your tears out. <br />
<br />
“You meanie! I can take it.”<br />
<br />
“You sure?”<br />
<br />
“I’m not a cry baby. I can take it.”<br />
<br />
You don’t talk this way. You’re sure of it. But these childish feelings are swelling up and you can’t contain them anymore. <br />
<br />
Gerard slipped two fingers and split them apart. It widened your whole to a new circumference. It hurts a lot, but you braced through it. <br />
<br />
Once it was wide enough, three fingers slid in. You were crying but you screamed in pain-pleasure when he edged at your G-spot. You know how good it feels but it was still a surprise like many others.<br />
<br />
“I’ll put it in now,”<br />
<br />
Gerard slid the head of his throbbing cock inside. The head alone was larger than three of his fingers. But you held on… you would and you should. Your fingers dug on his brown hair as your mouth suckled on his pecs for comfort. You tried to ignore the pain and focused only on the warmth of Gerard’s body. But it’s difficult and practically impossible. You wanted it to stop but you kept your mouth shut. <br />
<br />
Gerard pushed slowly. When you thought he was finished, another inch would push forward. Being this new size really fucked up your sense of length. Everything is longer and bigger. It is expected but everything becomes a surprise. Just like how you thought you can’t get any harder. <br />
<br />
“It’s so warm and tight, I don’t think I could push further.”<br />
That was a lie. He could push further and he did push more. He fucked you like a doll. Your screams mixed in with the moans. It was painful but the pleasures overtook it as time passed. By the end of it, you were begging him to cum inside you.<br />
<br />
And he did. The two of you collapsed on the floor, his bigger body on top of your own. He released his cum inside of you while you released it on the crevasse between the two of your stomachs. <br />
<br />
“AHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!” you moaned in unison. <br />
<br />
No words escaped your mouth at the end. Just tiny nibbles and moans to top everything off. </p>
