<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nathan was breathing heavily as he looked around, his family had all paused for a moment in their transformation but only for a moment. He watched as his father began to grow, his cloths ripping as he transformed. His mother wasn’t growing but instead her neck was growing outwards as her face began to change. All her hair fell out as two cream-colored horns grew out of the top of her head along with dozens of smaller ones. If it wasn’t so horrifying it would be kind of funny, a dragon head and long snake like neck coming out of the body of 40-year-old women. <br />
<br />
He turned his attention to his sister, his older sister’s shoes had burst as her feet began to transform, her manicured nails were turning into claws and with a burst her top ripped as a pair of wings began to grow from her shoulder blades. <br />
<br />
“Mommy, Daddy, help.” Cried little Liz as Nathan turned and looked at her, she seamed to have been transformed the most, her entire lower body from the belly button down had been transformed. She had sharp clawed feet and a long tail covered with small, pointed spins. Her flesh had turned to scales with a mostly pink color with hot pink underbelly and spins, the scales were advancing upwards ripping her cloths and transforming her body. Within she was all but a dragon, her T-shirt ripped as a pair of wings grew out, like her scales it was pink with hot pink skin between the bat like wings. <br />
<br />
“It will be alright.” Said Nathan his voice deeper then normal as Liz’s neck grew outwards into a snake like neck with larger spins on the back as her face pushed out into a muzzle and her eyes changed to slits like a venomous snake. She was totally a small dragon, a pink dragon with hot pink accents. <br />
<br />
He looked back as his mother, she was growing in size and transforming as well, getting more and more dragon parts. Maybe because he hadn’t totally finished his drink his transformation was taking a little longer. He expected to see her as a pink dragon but instead his mother had taken on an orange and cream color set. For some reason while her body was now almost totally dragon like her little daughter Liz, in her new dragon body she was still skinny but now the size of a school bus with a long tail covered with spins and deadly claws. There seamed to be a bump in the scales around where her breasts used to be, did that mark her as a female dragon? Did dragon breast feed or was it just some of her humanity showing even as a dragon.<br />
<br />
His father who was roaring as he transformed wasn’t pink either but instead a deep dark blackish red. He seemed smaller than his mother in size, where dragons like birds with the female being larger than the male. His belly was covered with black scales, and he could see his own father’s dick was out but now covered in a protective scale covered slit with his balls assuming inside his body. He lacked the breast bump of his mother so maybe that was a sexual trait. <br />
<br />
His eyes turned to his oldest sister, her transformation was nearing the end as well, she looked to be the size of the mini van while both their parents had grown to the size of a school bus, her scales had taken on a bright blue while her horns where a darker blue. She let out a roar, as a small jet of ice-cold air came out turning a nearby tree into an ice cube. Like their mother she had a breast bump in her scales, which made no sense to him but neither did any of this. <br />
<br />
It made no sense if they where all transforming into the same creature how come all the scales where different, his father a Dark blackish red, his mother an orange cream, his oldest sister a bright blue and his little sister a bright neon pink. That made no sense, as their children should they have the same scale colors as their parents. Then he remembered the cause, of it all.<br />
<br />
He looked to the remains of the cups, beside his father was his Black Raspberry Dragon Blood, beside his mother was her Orange-Soda Cream Dragon Blood, beside his sister was her Blue Raspberry Blast Dragon Blood and beside his younger sister was Pink Bubblegum Dragon blood. <br />
<br />
“The flavor of the drink is the scales.” Said Nathan as he winced, looks like he was about to transform some more. He looked toward his cup to see what sort of scales he was about to get.</p>
