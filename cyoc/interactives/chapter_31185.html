<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>The vixen had been minding her own
business, getting a drink from the river,
though she didn't much care for the
strange taste the water had acquired.
Suddenly, a human had swum up to the bank
and bumped right into her as he clambered
out of the water. Surprised, she yelped
and leapt back, but for some reason she
couldn't bring herself to run away.</p>
<p>Mike managed to haul himself out of the
water and right smack into the muzzle of a
fox who'd merely been getting a drink. To
his surprise, she didn't claw or bite him,
not that he was complaining. He was
focused more on trying to get the foul
taste of the river water out of his mouth.
Funny, he reflected; he'd accidentally
ingested water from this river before, and
it didn't taste that bad. Some grit and a
bit of a fishy flavor, sure, but this was
downright bitter. Finally, he managed to
cleanse his palate sufficiently, and
looked around.</p>
<p>The vixen was still there, but
something was different about her. She
was...larger? Mike stared, and sure
enough, she was getting larger before his
eyes, her body proportions changing. It
almost looked like she was becoming
human...</p>
<p>His thoughts quickly shifted focus when
he realized that he was shrinking
slightly, becoming shorter. Not nearly as
fast as the vixen was getting larger, but
he was getting shorter. On top of that,
his arms seemed to be getting
slenderer...there was an expanding
sensation in his chest, and he sudenly
realized exactly what was happening.</p>
<p>The vixen was too preoccupied with the
strange changes happening to her body to
pay much attention to the human. It was
bizarre; her whole body was growing, but
her legs were growing faster than the rest
of her. There a twisting, cracking pain in
her hindlegs, and she realized that her
knees had suddenly switched the wrong way
round, bending forward instead of
backward! There was also a feeling of
growing in her front two nipples, as the
others disappeared into her belly. What on
earth could the purpose of that be!?
Suddenly, she became aware of the human,
who was suffering some similar changes,
especially with the growing nipples. He
was making all kinds of strange noises,
and a light suddenly broke in upon the
vixen's brain; <i>she could understand
them!</i> The noises were supplications to
his god to end the changes!</p>
<p>"Oh god oh god NO NO <i>NO!</i>" Mike
screamed. His voice had cracked a moment
ago, and had just changed into a soft
soprano as his new breasts finished
growing, stopping at a moderate size. Mike
watched, horrified and screaming, as his
body took on a feminine shape, his
formerly straight and angular figure
becoming soft and curvy, hips expanding
and waist contracting. Before he knew it,
there was a sickening scrambling sensation
in Mike's privates and <i>she</i> realized
that she was fully a woman.</p>
<p>But that wasn't all; she could feel a
change in her ears as they relocated to
the top of her head, and a painful,
kinking pressure in the seat of her pants
ended with a three-foot tail bursting from
the back of her jeans. She could only
stare as her fingernails became claws, and
a bone-crunching sensation in her feet led
her to pull her shoes and socks off to
find that her feet had become paws. To top
it off, parts of her suddenly began to
sprout fur; her ears and tail became
covered in red fur, with her ears tipped
black and the insides lined with white,
and her tail tipped white. Her hands and
feet became covered in black fur up to
mid-forearm and mid-shin, respectively,
and as her fur was growing, so was her
hair; it had been a litle shaggy before,
but now it had become long red tresses
dropping down just past her shoulders.</p>
<p>The vixen, meanwhile, felt her body
continue to rearrange. Her hindlegs and
forelegs had finally stopped growing when
they reached about the same proportions as
the human's, and her forepaws had changed,
the toes becoming long and slender, with
the dewclaw moving around to the side and
becoming a full-fledged toe that folded
inward onto the bottom of her foot. Her
muzzle had changed too, becoming more
blunt and rounded like the human's, though
not too much. Her body itself changed
shape, becoming curved around the base of
her hindlegs, and for some reason the fur
on top of her head began to grow, spilling
down her back until it nearly reached the
base of her tail.</p>
<p>And then it was over. Sensing the end
of the changes, Mike stopped her shrieking
and just stared - at herself, at the
vixen, at the sky.</p>
<p>The vixen stared as well. Her legs had
changed so much that she couldn't walk on
all fours, so there wasn't much else she
could do. She thought back to the noises
the human made, and how she could suddenly
understand them. Maybe,  she thought, she
could duplicate them. If the human could
use those noises to create meaning, maybe
she could too. And as she thought of this,
two noises stuck in her mind, the first
words she would  ever utter.</p>
<p>"What happened?" she asked.</p></p>
