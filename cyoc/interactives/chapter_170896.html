<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Now that Shane had joined their party, She and Alice would now become their parties Vanguard, while Vivian would now focus on Archery from a more midrange point and Neka would just be Neka, and do her own thing. Vivian had returned just before sunset and was surprized when Shane was the one to receive her and bring her up to their room. Of course Alice and Andrea had already both agreed to move into the penthouse suite with Shane too. She also wasn&#39;t too excited for another succubus joining their group, but she couldn&#39;t just turn down Shane. <br />
<br />
Had it been anyone else, then it would have been different. But since Shane was an S-ranked veteran adventurer, passing up on her addition to the party was just too hard to do. If she was with them, then they could get away with taking higher paying quests. Plus her numerous connections, wealth, experience, and ability to persuade others were all attractive features to Vivian. Plus she would easily be able to fulfill Alice&#39;s needs and vice versa. <br />
<br />
Actually, now that she thought about it, with Shane joining them, that gives them 3 non-human races who are very strong. Then wouldn&#39;t it be right to assume that they now could get proper equipment, maybe even buy a personal carriage to use so that walking the entire wouldn&#39;t be necessary anymore? Plus she already is fine with me being the Wife and she being the Mistress. Plus no rent for amazing living conditions is just too good.<br />
<br />
Vivian&#39;s outward expression started out frustrated, but as time went by, the others could see her thought process through her facial expressions. Especially now since she was grinning like a fool who just found burried treasure just sitting there along the side of the road, already half unburried with a shovel nearby. <br />
<br />
&quot;I gotta say though, I am still a bit surprised that you decided to keep them Vivian&quot; began Andrea so as to break the awkward silence. Everyone was thinking about it already, but now that Andrea had addressed it, maybe they would get the answer for the question they were all wondering. &quot;Yeah, why did you decide to keep the 4 additional tits? Don&#39;t get me wrong, you somehow are able to pull it off extremely well, where it almost looks natural, which I still can&#39;t seem to get my head around how, but I thought you disliked them?&quot; Also asked Alice, who had been curiously poking, groping, pinching, bouncing, and licking them all over, including on their nipples too, to see how Vivian reacted. Of course Vivian internally wasn&#39;t overly happy about being played with, but she didn&#39;t want Alice to stop either because even though it was annoying, it still felt really good. &quot;I got a connection with one of the sex toys, clothes, and accessories shops in the market district. They gave me a massive discount to test a new product for them, which would solidify the portion of the curse which added the extra boobs only. So far no I&#39;ll side effects and I guess I will finally admit to it that I actually liked having them, but coulsn&#39;t just find a good enough reason/excuse to keep them. But I came to the realization that they made me happy, and so that was what became the only reason I needed. I liked having them. I didn&#39;t need some excuse,  I just enjoied having 6 breasts.&quot; Explained Vivian with full confidence.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I think that you made a wonderful decision. Dont ever live your life only to do what others choose for you. Unless you are a parent, and the concern is about your kid, you don&#39;t need to adhear to anyine elses opinion about your personal decisions. At least that is how I have always done things&quot; said Shane who was now sitting elegantly in a throne-like chair, sipping a glass of wine, while still fully naked. Only herself and Alice were naked, both deciding to not put back on their clothing for the time being since they were &quot;home&quot;. However if you were to look around the mansion, it was rather rare for there to be a fully clothed succubus anywhere besides on the entertainment stage durring formal music events. Otherwise not a single succubi nipple was covered, and panties just didn&#39;t exist to them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Shane guess what I got from draining you!&quot; Alice said, changing the subject. &quot;Got from me? From draining me? Is that even possible?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My drain has a chance to give me a cooy of possibly any spell or skill used by the drain target, or add to my stat like slightly. I also have a skill which gives me a copy of the pussy I get fucked in while using possession. So I now have an exact copy of your pussy, as well as a special little skill called Instant Resurrection.&quot; Alice gloated as she held up her ID card for Shane to see.<br />
<br />
&quot;YOU COPIED MY UNIQUE SKILL?&quot; Shane shouted in shock while jumping to her feet and dashing into Alice for a full blown tackle, which was strong and fast enough to decapitate Alice instantly. However the moment she died, her blood and chunks of her exploded head all flew back together as she resurrected, gasping the moment she regained consciousness. &quot; Holy fuck, you really did copy my skill...&quot; Shane said to herself dumbfounded. She had seen it plrinted on the ID card, but just couldn&#39;t believe it. It was supposed to be a one of a kind skill. No 2 people can have it at the same time. And yet here in front of her is living proof against that entire concept.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have a theory as to why I could do it. Since you do doe for a brief instant, I can aquire it, but then you resurrect, which normally isn&#39;t possible. Basically it is a magic loophole, or a simply overlooked glitch in the logic behind the magic.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;YOU IDIOTS!&quot; shouted a teary eyed Vivian. &quot;What if it didn&#39;t work! Alice would be dead right now for no good reason. Please, just don&#39;t scare me like that. At least warn me first the next time you two idiots try and kill yourselves. And why are you so calm about this Andrea? Wait, am I the only one who is shaken by all of this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you see. I guess I am sorta use to it by now.&quot; Admitted Andrea, who now felt a bit self conscious about hiw she was completely unfazed by watching her friend&#39;s head get popped by her idol&#39;s tackle. &quot;Well, I mean, I have watched Alice kill Shane at least twice now with her drain, so this is kind of, idk common for me now? Either way, everything is all ok now. No one is hurt, let alone dead, and if we are honest, she did kind of deserve it at least once since she did kill Shane 2 times.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell did I miss while I was shopping?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just a fair bit of unusually violent sex.&quot;</p>
