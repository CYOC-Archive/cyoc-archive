<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was an occasion that might be described as a &quot;worst case scenario&quot; - during a pitched battle with the Cult of the All-Seeing Eye, devoted to an eclectic collection of GET Items which they alleged could be utilized together to create utopia, a couple items were lost in the ensuing struggle. One of those items being 0047-2, which, owing to its potential to induce drastic restructuring of the world if all seven were united on some fortunate or unfortunate souls.<br />
<br />
Apparently some lesser rank cultist grabbed it, and then escaped the battle while it was underway. At least as far as the footage showed.<br />
<br />
While there were higher priority, more dangerous items, the Tiara was designated a high priority item to be retrieved - before it could bind with someone and induce a transformation. The exact length of the transformation had been pretty fast at least as far as the records showed - so it was considered a relative bright spot that at least the individual who might&#39;ve ended up with the cursed tiara in question might be found quickly.<br />
<br />
After all, one tends to notice when someone has been transformed into a gigantic, ten foot tall woman basically made of muscle.<br />
<br />
However...<br />
<br />
What neither the GET or the All-Seeing Eye Cultists knew was the exact consequence of their battle. During the course of it, the Cursed Tiara 0047-2 was damaged - and the gem&#39;s ability to so quickly change someone into the image of the &quot;Curse of the Lion&quot; was slowed. Thus, in order to act upon its curse, the Tiara would end up more slow-acting, deliberate, and enticing. Whosoever took up the Cursed Tiara might not even notice it was what it was until it was far, far too late.<br />
<br />
And who indeed might end up with this sensitive and deeply cursed item?<br />
<br />
-------------------<br />
<br />
Dominic &quot;Dom&quot; Evans was headed home when he saw it.<br />
<br />
The tow-headed young man was getting used to the rough treatment he got at the football team, depressingly enough. He had thought that the hazing would let up some time soon, but it seemed like Caleb Kenning just...didn&#39;t want to.  Evans was a light brown haired young man, merely leanly muscled on a team full of roided up berserkers - though if you went around SAYING as much, the result would be even worse than what Dom got. The young man had hazel colored eyes, wore a short sleeved shirt, a denim jacket, jeans and sneakers. <br />
<br />
It seemed like nothing he did was quite good enough. Though it wasn&#39;t like he was the only one suffering through it. Caleb Kenning seemed to be a tyrant over the entire school, utilizing his &quot;football team hero&quot; status to get away with whatever he wanted.<br />
<br />
In contrast to Dominic, Caleb was a 6 foot 5 inches tall monstrosity. The network of veins over him, exceedingly prominent trapezius muscles, prematurely aged facial features, and constant, poorly suppressed rage all pointed to one culprit of why Caleb was so nasty. He just took to the same drug the others utilized...poorly. Though perhaps the rumors played just as much a role.<br />
<br />
As Dom walked along, he heard a pair of girls chatting about the issue at hand;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, I heard that Caleb mixes up these fucked up videos for personal consumption.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...Is this the gay porn thing? Yeah. I mean, if he&#39;s into that kind of BDSM for whatever reason. I just don&#39;t get why he likes watching it while he&#39;s having sex with [i]women[/i]...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I mean, just cuz he&#39;s good at football doesn&#39;t mean he isn&#39;t a mess upstairs.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dominic shrugged and figured it was none of his business. What mattered was getting Caleb off his back, not whatever personal business Caleb got up to in his personal time. What was clear was that the guy was insanely pushy, and nothing Dom ever did really made the dude happy. And it wasn&#39;t as if Dom replaced someone on the team Caleb liked. The position had BEEN open, and they needed someone urgently to fill it. It just seemed Caleb was exacting whatever issues he had on to Dominic.<br />
<br />
Not a fair thing - not at all. And he had a mind to see about trying to stop this somehow. But Coach was a lost cause. He was firmly in Team Caleb Gets To Do Whatever He Wants. Even the Principal was more concerned with getting more trophies than the fact the star player was a neurotic wreck of a human being...<br />
<br />
As Dom thought about ways to handle Caleb, and the sheer volume of issues the man represented, he stumbled suddenly as he turned on a street, kicking a box that had evidently dropped out of some truck. &quot;Ugh...dammit...&quot; Dom muttered and looked at the severely ruptured box. It was unmarked, and there was no hint as to what might be contained. Shrugging his shoulders, Dom decided it couldn&#39;t hurt to see what might be inside.<br />
<br />
Checking it out saw him looking at first at a bunch of newspapers.<br />
<br />
He grimaced and tugged them out, noting that they seemed to be pushed in around something. Something making distinctly metallic noises in there. His eyes widened. Dominic wondered if there might be something worth a bit of money inside there. Outside of Dominic&#39;s awareness, what was inside there shifted by necessity due to the damages sustained. What was in there would now be, coincidentally, more amenable to Dominic&#39;s tastes in apparel.<br />
<br />
What was a tiara now resembled a necklace by design - whatever anomalous intelligence dwelled within possibly lamenting the necessity.<br />
<br />
But it did register a worthwhile host.<br />
<br />
As Dominic took out the necklace, noting as he did the strange, almost tiara-shaped design of the frontal hoop-like metallic piece, he tilted his head. He did admit he found the jewel at the front, damaged as it was, pretty beautiful. He was not averse to wearing stuff like that, even if it didn&#39;t seem too conventionally &quot;masculine&quot;. &quot;Well, I dunno who dropped this fun little trinket...&quot; he said with a grin and a flourish in his step as he got the &quot;necklace&quot; around his neck, &quot;But you&#39;re mine now.&quot;<br />
<br />
And so Dominic continued on his way home, though unbeknownst to him a slow but certain transformation would begin to work its way over him in the coming days...</p>
