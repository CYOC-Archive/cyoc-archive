<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I&#39;m tired of your games you crazy old man! Stop this! I want you to leave me alone!&quot; Andrew screamed as he stood defiantly against the wizard.<br />
<br />
The Wizard raised his brow, finally something interesting is happening. A smirk crossed the Wizard&#39;s face and a light gleamed in his eye. &quot;Oh?&quot; was all he said, goading Andrew to dig his hole deeper.<br />
<br />
Andrew saw the Wizard&#39;s smirk and became infuriated, not realizing how humorous his defiant pose was when coming from a small child. <br />
<br />
&quot;You are insane! You have kidnapped me, removed any trace of me from my family, and put me in strange and smelly situations for your sick amusement! You are a horrible person!&quot; With this Andrew&#39;s young body was overwhelmed by his emotions, as little kids are, and he began sobbing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, Is that all what this is about? You want freedom, and your family?&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew only nodded, Teary eyed and hopeful.<br />
<br />
The Wizard began to pace and mumble to himself, lost in his own world of thoughts, Andrew could just stare.<br />
<br />
Stopping suddenly, the Wizard looked at Andrew and asked, &quot;This is your family, but you aren&#39;t satisfied? Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It It It&#39;s not MY fam-family!&quot; was all Andrew could say between sobs.<br />
<br />
A light seemed to click for The Wizard. &quot;Oh, I see.&quot; Going back to talking to himself. &quot;Well normally that is forbidden... but he did sign the contract...and he was rather disrespectful, we must chastise him for that...Yes... Yes... YES! Fantastic!! Oh this will be fun! I will need to pull some rather delicate strings but I believe we can make this happen.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew was suddenly filled with hope as he felt himself growing, The Wizard was a flurry of excitement as a enormous tome appeared from nowhere, several spells were cast in a few seconds, and the tome immediately disappeared. Andrew actually laughed to see The Wizard so zealous. Andrew heard his 14 year old voice back and was extremely relieved.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stay right here my lad, Ill be right back!&quot;, With a giggle and a puff of smoke The Wizard was gone. The house being frozen in time he walked over to look at his former family. Until now, Andrew never realized how short Kurt was, Andrew was 6 inches or so taller than him. Andrew hugged his former brothers, they were good to him and he appreciated that, He went over to his former mom, gave her a hug and a kiss on the cheek.<br />
<br />
Andrew&#39;s gaze lingered a moment on his mom, he never realized how beautiful she was until now, He began getting an erection then was filled with embarrassment and joy, he had been stuck in prepubescent forms so long he looked forward to having an orgasm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eh-Ha-Hem&quot; The Wizard appeared from nowhere and gave Andrew quite a fright. Eyeing Andrew, The Wizard said, &quot;I&#39;m glad the spell is taking hold, you should be ready in a moment or two.&quot; <br />
<br />
Andrew opened his mouth but The Wizard cut him off, &quot;Not a word! We haven&#39;t the time, You wanted freedom, you shall have it. You wanted YOUR family. Here it is.&quot; With a flourish of his hands the house spun and it&#39;s contents changed, Andrew looked back to where his fake brothers and Mother were standing and saw his brothers shrink to small children and his mother become a very young and beautiful woman in her early 20s.<br />
<br />
Andrew began to look confused but The Wizard was continuing on. &quot;I realized, in looking into your history that you are young and stupid. You don&#39;t even realize what levels of pleasure and pain are in this world. You don&#39;t understand what I offer you, but I can help you with that. I have centuries as you have seconds and this will be a crash course lesson in life, its riches, and its consequences.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Andrew blurted out suddenly terrified. Andrew didn&#39;t recognize his voice, it was much deeper than a 14 year-old&#39;s.<br />
<br />
&quot;You may have been right Andrew, I may have snatched you from your life too soon. To make up for it, I must ensure you experience the fullness of life before offering you the secrets of my ultimate power. You need to mature a bit, but thanks to your requests we can make that happen more quickly than waiting the natural 40 or 60 years.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Wizard clapped his hands twice and a full body mirror appeared beside Andrew, For the first time Andrew understood why his voice sounded strange. <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re 28 Andrew.&quot;<br />
<br />
Awed by his reflection he raised his hand to the shadow of stubble that had grown in while he was completely unaware. His frame and muscles had grown and his face had changed though it was still recognizably him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t understand, I thought you were going to return me to my old life?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What an absurd idea! Do you have no concept of how terribly dangerous that would be? You&#39;d end up killing everyone! Look, What you need to know right now is that she is your wife, those are your kids, this is your house, it is Saturday and your friends are coming over to watch the game.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But this isn&#39;t my family!&quot;, Andrew made a final protest.<br />
<br />
&quot;45..44..43.. Andrew, because it was your request I was able to make this easier on you, Normally I can only effect memories and physique, or emotion. A weird and twisted rule but it stops evil wizards from trying to take over all of the Father Realm, where you came from. You see they can either change the history of the world to enslave it, or make everyone loyal, but without the two working together you will simply have power without loyalty or loyalty without power. Because the spell is effecting you and you requested to have your own family, I can give you the memories of creating this family and the true love of a father that goes with it. This will add real pizzazz and kick to your actions. Real emotions means real responses, means real learning... We will get a good head on those shoulders of yours, even if it kills you, repeatedly! This all being said, This will be your family, the one you created, support, and love. That&#39;s what family is right? Love??? in 5..4..3..&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew was panicked, and frozen in fear. &quot;2..1.. There all done! painless right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew didn&#39;t feel any different at all... &quot;Ha ha! Your spell failed, I&#39;m still me!&quot;<br />
<br />
A terrible darkness crossed the Wizard&#39;s face. &quot;You insolent sprig of nothing, my spell executed flawlessly.&quot; As quickly as it came the rage evaporated and was replaced with a devilish smile. &quot;I will demonstrate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Indulge me if you would be so kind.&quot; The Wizard cooed. &quot;Walk me through your normal Monday morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew was perplexed but feeling confident since he felt the same as a minute ago so he started to rattle off his morning routine without considering what he was saying. &quot;I get up and grab my clothes for the day, I go to the bathroom, use the bathroom, take a shower, shave, get dressed, go downstairs, make myself a cup of coffee and have breakfast.&quot; Andrew shot The Wizard a glance as if to say, &quot;That accomplished nothing, what is your point.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm,&quot; The Wizard intoned, &quot;Perhaps you&#39;re right, I guess you won&#39;t mind if I incinerate Kurt then?&quot; Just then Kurt as a 4 year old and Mark as a two year old floated by and Andrew reacted before he knew what was happening.<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; Andrew cried, grabbing the children as they floated by and dropping to the ground over them prepared to smother any flames that erupt.<br />
<br />
&quot;But why not Andrew?&quot;, The Wizard questioned innocently. &quot;They aren&#39;t your family as you have mentioned repeatedly. They aren&#39;t your brothers. I could turn you into a beast and let you eat them?&quot; The Wizard offered.<br />
<br />
Andrew was in horrified tears, &quot;Please God NO!&quot; His body began to grow and fur quickly erupted from his body as his muzzle pushed out and grew fangs. Claws replaced his hands and feet and he could feel the urge to eat Mark growing inside him.<br />
<br />
&quot;But why not Andrew? Why not?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Because they&#39;re my children!&quot;, Andrew half screamed, half growled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahh, fantastic! Well then, that&#39;s good enough for me.&quot; With two claps The Wizard disappeared, the children returned to where they were originally, Andrew was again a man, and time had started.<br />
<br />
Reaching into the fridge, Andrew had this vague feeling he was about to be tested and forced to learn some of life&#39;s big lessons but he couldn&#39;t place where the feeling was coming from. Something he had heard back when he was 14?<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever.&quot; Andrew said aloud grabbing a beer. David and Brian would be here any minute to watch the game. &quot;Hey Hon? Do you Remember where the chips went?&quot; Without realizing he chugged half his beer while waiting for her to respond.<br />
<br />
&quot;Near the Microwave!&quot;, she called back from the other room.<br />
<br />
Finding them, &quot;Thanks!&quot;, that woman is a saint, Andrew thought to himself. Just then the doorbell rang.</p>
