<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The bus continued along its route picking up all the other boys and girls and loading them onto the bus.  Each one was sitting in a wheelchair like Monica&#39;s but each wheel chair had different attachments.  One had a foot plate with cups for shoes and straps.  The girl sitting in the chair had her shoes strapped into those cups.  Meanwhile, a boy had a black vinyl covered wedge attached to his seat keeping his knees apart.  Another girl had what looked like the complete package of attachments attached to her seat.  She just sat there staring into space with drool spilling onto her bib.  Little did Monica know that in the future, she&#39;d be spending more and more time in her special chair as attachment after attachment would be added to secure her more and more until she also would have the complete package.  This school wanted that sweet, sweet government funding and the only way to do that was to keep its students.  The only way to keep students was to teach them how to become even more special.  And so the entire staff at the school was in on the plan as it meant more pay raises for them.  All of this flew over Monica&#39;s head as she slowly drifted off to sleep.  When Monica woke up again, she was in a strange large room with other kids.  A teacher was cooing to her, &quot;Wake up Monica, wake up!  It&#39;s time for nummie breakfast, yes it is.&quot;  The teacher unstrapped her wheelchair/stroller thingy and gently guided her to a standing position.  She then held Monica&#39;s hand as she led Monica to a red chair that had not legs and was resting on a short base on the floor.    The chair was the usual thick vinyl with thick dense foam intended to be easy to clean in case some one smeared food all over or it or leaked poop on it.  The teacher then guided Monica down and helped her sit into the chair.  The teacher then strapped her in the new chair in much of the same way she was strapped into her stroller.  A strap came between Monica&#39;s crotch meeting in the center where two straps came together to support her waist while shoulder straps came down to meet everything in the center where the buckle is.  A blue tray was then wheeled up to her.  This tray looked very much like a high chair tray only detached from the chair and was on its own frame with wheels to move it around if need be.  The other noticeable feature of this tray, aside from the food that was placed directly on it without any silver wear, plates, bowls, or cups, was the half inch tall lip that went around the entire tray to prevent food from falling off of it.  It was a good thing she put her bib on when she left the house this morning.  That bib was gonna get messy.  But no matter, Damon handed Monica&#39;s diaper bag over to the bus driver who handed it over to the teacher.  In it was a spare outfit, more bibs, and some diapers, though, in reality, the daycare supplied diapers. On the tray were tiny bits and pieces of scrambled egg, potato, peas, and sausage all covered in shredded and melted cheddar cheese.  The teacher then placed a plain white sippy cup on her tray.  Unknown to Monica, it wasn&#39;t filled with milk.  Instead, it was filled with the nutrition formula that she would learn to rely on to get all of her meals in the future.  There would be no other menu options for her in the future.  But of course, Monica didn&#39;t know that.  She had a wide gaping smile, drool and for now, the fun looking mess she had on her tray was plenty good enough for her.  She started to grab at bits of her food with both hands using only her thumb and pointer finger.  It was difficult because the cheese was slippery and the food would fall out of her hand onto her tray, bib, or the floor.  The pieces of food she got into her mouth were really tasty, though.  Occasionally, she would take sips of formula from her sippy cup.   It didn&#39;t taste like milk, but despite the bland and slightly bitter and sour taste, it was was also yummy.  The teacher continuously encouraged Monica to eat and play with her food.  Most of the food didn&#39;t land in her tummy, though.  Instead it landed on her bib, in her lap, smeared across her face and hands, dropped onto the floor.  As long as the formula disappeared into Monica&#39;s tummy, everything would be fine.  The teacher never expected for Monica to finish her yummy breakfast.  As long as the sippy cup was empty of its formula, 500 Calories would end up in Monica giving her a third of her daily calories, vitamins, and minerals.  As for monica, she really enjoyed eating and playing with her meal.  She loved smearing it across the tray and chortled as she watched the sticky cheese on her fingers grow strings as she separated and closed her fingers back together again.  Just before the teacher started to clean Monica up for play time, Monica felt something squishy enter her diaper.  She bounced up and down on it and spread the mess all through her diaper giving her a slippery, squishy, warm, and gooey sensation in her seat.  She never registered the smell, but the teacher knew that Monica was in need of a diaper change.  The teacher quickly pulled away the tray from the chair, unstrapped Monica, and guided her over to the changing table while another teacher cleaned up Monica&#39;s mess.  The changing table was interesting.  It had a ladder that you could climb up and had cabinets underneath it.  Monica thought it was fun to climb up the ladder and onto the changing pad.  The teacher quickly got the strap around her waist and secured her in.  She then opened a cabinet took out a diaper, diaper wipes, a stuffed monkey, and baby powder.  She handed the monkey over to Monica who happily shook it.  In return, the monkey made a small tinkling sound and the miniature bell inside it rang.  First, she removed Monica&#39;s bib and placed it in a zip-lock bag.  She&#39;d hand it over to laundry to be washed and returned to Monica&#39;s diaper bag at the end of the day. She quickly undid the straps holding Monica&#39;s shortalls, and pulled them off of Monica making sure to tuck the bib under the changing table&#39;s straps so that she could easily remove them without undoing the straps.  It was easy to pull them over Monica&#39;s shoes and off of Monica due to the wide leg cuff of her shortalls.  She placed the shortalls to the side to be put on again.  She then worked Monica&#39;s shirt off, making sure monkey didn&#39;t get caught in the shirt, and placed it in Monica&#39;s diaper bag, though it was still mostly clean.  She used a diaper wipe to clean food residue off of Monica&#39;s face and hands and threw it in a trash bin below.  The teacher then proceeded to untape Monica&#39;s diaper, roll Monica to the side, clean Monica&#39;s front and tush.  She then removed the used diaper and threw it away.  She grabbed the fresh diaper, this one thicker than the one Monica was originally wearing, opened it up, fluffed it out, sprinkled baby powder in it, and then proceeded to put it on Monica.  Unlike Monica&#39;s other diaper that &quot;felt like real underwear&quot;, this diaper had a plastic backing.  At home, Monica&#39;s package of diapers in her closet only had two of six drips printed in blue.  This diaper had the six drips printed directly on the plastic, but only four were colored in.   It also had an &quot;M&quot; printed under the drips.  It also had much more visibly noticeable wetness indicators running through it.  Once Monica was finished being diapered, The teacher pulled out a pink crotch snap onesie from somewhere and pulled it over Monica&#39;s head.  She then worked Monica&#39;s arms into the sleeves o the new onesie making sure to not get caught up on monkey in Monica&#39;s hand.  At the neck, the teacher closed the two snaps and snapped up the six snaps at the crotch of Monica&#39;s diaper.  She then proceeded to put Monica&#39;s shortalls back on her and fastened the shortall&#39;s straps back onto the metal buttons on the shortall&#39;s bib.  She then placed a new bib on Monica. This one had the same green color and vinyl backing except this one also had a crumb catcher.  She then cleaned up the diaper changing station, locked Monica&#39;s diaper bag into the station&#39;s cabinet, and undid the straps holding Monica in.  &quot;Okay, time to hop down, Monica.&quot;, said the teacher.  Monica didn&#39;t really understand what the teacher was saying, but kind of got the gist when the teacher tapped on the ladder for Monica to climb down. The monkey dropped out of Monica&#39;s hands and fell to the floor.  The teacher then helped Monica down the ladder.  Afterwards, the Teacher grabbed the monkey and placed it onto the changing table.  She&#39;d have to return later to put it in its proper place.  She guided A drooling Monica over to a giant rug with other boys and girls and encouraged her to sit down.  Monica then set down onto the rug and left momentarily only to return with a large ring stacker.  Monica quickly grabbed at the top ring that rattled when it shook and jammed it into her mouth.  The cool smooth texture was a wonderful experience.  Meanwhile unknown to Monica, all of her special shirts at home and in her diaper bag transformed into snap crotch onesies.  Her diapers at home and in her diaper bag also changed into the new diaper that Monica now wore.  Her new diapers were twice as thick as her night time diapers as her night time diapers became four times as thick as they transformed as well.  They were similar to her diaper except now had all six drips colored in.  Four new empty drips appeared below the ones colored in making the total number of drips 10.  Apparently, Madame&#39;s spell was still coming into fruition.  And for now Monica was making happy babbling sounds as she munched on her plastic ring.</p>
