<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The main title theme for the video game “Colony” rang through Zossie’s ears. It was a retro game that had originated in arcades before being ported to the system named the “CM-Metro”, a console her dad owned. Zossie has grown up staring at the television watching her dad set up and create a simulated space colony. The theme was so nostalgic that she had to buy a remixed version of it and that music was slowly overtaking her mind and pushing other thoughts to the wayside. Zossie pumped that dildo in and out of her body repeatedly as she lost all sentient thought and simply let Colony’s main title wash over her as she mindlessly pleasured herself. So much pleasure and such nice music. She liked the theme more and more as time passed on and her masturbation increased in speed and intensity.<br />
<br />
She was so lost in pleasure that she failed to notice that the next song that came on wasn’t even one she owned. It was the town theme from Dungeon Hunter, a game from two console generations ago about managing a town that supplied adventurers with weapons, stat boosts, and supplies. Your job was to oversee the building and layout of the town while gifting your adventurers weapons and armour, attracting more to town, and directing them to explore dungeons and fight monsters. Zossie hasn’t even heard of the game before but the game was considered a classic and as that music filled her ears her hair began to suck backwards into her head. It rose past her shoulders and up to her chin halting at that nice length, just long enough to tie back with a band but also short enough that it didn’t take long to wash or care for. Zossie stuck her tongue out and licked her lips finding them shrinking back. They no longer protruded outwards in an overtly feminine way and simply sat at a small size for a girl but remained large enough to be obviously feminine. Her nose remained the same size and her eyes remained the same colour but gained a concentrated look and slight bags under them from late nights.<br />
<br />
The song changed again to another theme from another game Zossie hadn’t heard of. Battle Lines, specifically the beach battle theme. Battle Lines was a game where the player sent little soldiers along a pathway to engage in combat with other soldiers. The goal was to push past the enemy and reach their towers, base, and strategic points claiming them as your own. The game had been developed for mobile play and had stuck out above the rest, gaining ports to PC and handheld gaming consoles with the praise following it there. Zossie’s breasts perked up a little falling in a comfortable B-Cup while her waist lost definition and became smooth with the slightest bit of flab and softness. She thrust that dildo deeper and deeper as bliss came over her face and her hips flared out. Her legs got toned and her toenails and fingernails painted themselves black.<br />
<br />
The song in the headphones changed again to the tomb theme from Magic and Marauders. An open world Wild West and Mexican inspired fantasy game where the player controlled bounty hunter Chinco Ronks and hunted baddies that ranged from common thieves to me romantic criminals faced off in Mexican standoffs. The game was a Console exclusive and Zossie found herself humming along to it while a belly button piercing emerged followed by a pair of holes in her earlobes where earrings belonged. This was accompanied by a black ink tattoo of two intertwined dragons from the classic arcade game “Shantytown Showdown” while the earbuds transformed into a pair of expensive gaming headphones that wrapped over her ears. The sound became much better and the changes began to accelerate.<br />
<br />
Zossie’s discarded clothes shapeshifted into comfortable boxer shorts, a tight black tank top, an extremely comfortable bra that favoured function over fashion, and black panties she’d bought a week ago. Zossie’s phone underwent changes as game apps began to emerge on it while her laptop began to expand creating a tower and twin monitors. An expensive and custom ordered keyboard appeared while a hand fitting mouse popped into existence next to it with a mousepad with the Junkers logo from Master of Space 2 growing under it. Her desk changed to fit an ergonomic chair and a shelf appeared with top notch games for Pc in it. A handheld gaming system appeared under this with every game in the Suns of Orion series appearing within arms reach. Lamps changed to offer optimal lighting while the walls shifted to a blue paint job while the posters shifted into posters from video games. Zossie’s wardrobe changed as a series of old and much too large shirts appeared in it while newer shirts with geeky logos appeared next to them along with some fancy dress clothes, heels, and jewelry also attuned to her current shape. She moaned loudly as the bedspread changed along with pictures of her in the halls. Pictures from even a year ago showed a much different body type, a bigger one with a lot of acne and unhealthy bulges of fat. Zossie now has memories of being overweight and even her memories of high quality gaming were new. She had gotten a job as a waitress a year and half prior to feed her hobby and the constant walking around had led to a shift in her lifestyle. She’d Cut out junk food, begun to work out, and use her pay checks to upgrade her equipment while establishing a rigorous schedule for sleep, consistent meals, and outdoor time. The weight had practically dripped off her and now she was almost happy with her figure. There was a bit of fatty tissue left but whenever she looked in the mirror she felt closer and closer to perfect.<br />
<br />
A duo of game consoles appeared downstairs next to dad’s old one and Zossie felt her new mind awaken. She no longer remembered spending the evening with her family and as an orgasm wracked her body she felt her world begin to waver. She was in a bathroom and the dildo was gone. She was releasing juices and with a moan that fluid began to harden and expand up her body. It turned into fabric and formed around her as a nice dress. A bra and panties also formed while her feet rose and heels appeared under them. The dress turned a beautiful blue and a black belt formed on her waist while the straps and details of the dress turned black. An apron formed around her waist meant to hold a notepad and pen while makeup smeared all over her face. She bent down and felt toilet cleaner and a scrub brush appear in her hands before she began to work on the toilet. Her nice headphones were at home and her small earbuds were back playing video game soundtracks she hummed along to.<br />
<br />
Zossie cleaned a multitude of toilets in the men’s and wonen’s Bathroom before she exited and found her coworkers doing equally hard manual labour. They all just cleaned and as that music flowed into Zossie’s ears she began to feel reality solidify more. Memories of how to close down the restaraunt were now imprinted in her mind along with how her day had gone and plans for the next morning. She didn’t work until five that afternoon so she planned to be up early so she could get a few hours of gaming in. Her feet aches from the heels and she felt exhaustion and sweatiness through her body. She knew the second she got home she would collapse in bed and fall asleep. Her new personality formed while one of her coworkers did cash out and she counted her tips out. She had been super self conscious a year ago but after losing a lot of weight she had really come out of her shell and gained a lot of confidence.<br />
<br />
“Ninety dollars,” She finished counting before handing the coins and cash in for bigger bills. She now knew how to serve a table to the best of her ability even if that table was annoying and her pocketed cash was proof of that. A busy Friday night where she remained calm under pressure and multitasked so easily it baffled her coworkers. She then walked out the back while the manager set the alarm and held an umbrella up while she approached the train station.<br />
<br />
The public transport rocked back and forth while she played a round of Battle Lines and she felt a calm and soothing feeling come over her as riding the train became commonplace for her. It stopped near her neighbourhood and she walked for about ten minutes in the rain before unlocking the front door and realizing there had been a power outage thanks to the smell of candles. She just removed her coat, put the umbrella near the door and climbed upstairs to her room depositing the money in a savings jar and stripping her clothes off and changing into boxer shorts and a loose T-short that had once been tight. She was about to go to bed when she noticed her dildo lying on it. Shrugging she stowed it under her bed hiding it in the box her handheld had come in and falling into bed with a content sigh ready to turn her PC on the next morning and play some games.</p>
