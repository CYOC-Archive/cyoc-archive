<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Alright, first off clean off the semen from your legs and genitals while I put on a new pair of gloves.&quot;<br />
&quot;Wait, so we are just not gonna talk about that massive load Elliot just let out?&quot; Carl popped up again<br />
&quot;Shut up Carl. But, Elliot, is that amount normal when you ejaculate?&quot;<br />
And like that, the biggest amount Elliot ever jizzed became the new normal for him.<br />
&quot;Kind of? I cum less if I came recently, and more if I&#39;m more backed up, but normally it is about that much. Is that weird?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;s quite a bit more than average but I don&#39;t think it means anything bad, medically speaking. Cleaning wise, maybe not as good, I guess. Are you clean yet?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, we can start whenever. And you have no idea. It takes me more time to clean up after myself than to actually cum. I try and do it in the bathroom cause it&#39;s easier then, ya know?&quot;<br />
&quot;Alright, just spread your legs a bit more&quot;<br />
&quot;Careful, if he thinks you&#39;re Margaret he just might blow his load again. This time ON y-ugh! Would you stop that? It hurts, asshole!&quot; Carl objected to being hit by Sam again.<br />
&quot;Say stupid things, win stupid prizes&quot; Sam rebuked.<br />
Jim wanted to agree, but considering what happened before he wanted to make sure he wasn&#39;t gonna need to change his clothes after he was done.<br />
&quot;Elliot, does Margaret focus on your balls too when you&#39;re together or just the dick?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, she kinda has to, at the very least to get them out of the way, since they are so much bigger than my dick.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, but are you turned on by her touching them?&quot;<br />
&quot;Obviously. My girlfriend is touching my crotch, of course I&#39;d get turned on&quot;<br />
&quot;Like, enough to cum, turned on?&quot;<br />
&quot;Som-sometimes. But it also has a lot to do with the mental picture, you know? My balls aren&#39;t as sensitive as my dick or ass. It&#39;s just the thought of her touching me there turns me on a lot, so even if I&#39;m not that sensitive I might cum. But I wouldn&#39;t with you. Promise.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, considering what happened last time I think I&#39;m still gonna avoid being directly in front of you. Anyway, let&#39;s see here. Testis are about average... no, maybe a bit under average?&quot; Jim asked no one in particular. Then continued on &quot;Yeah, they are definitely quite a bit below average, right?&quot; Jim didn&#39;t have a lot of experience conducting these exams, and testicle size tended to vary quite a bit so he talked a bit to reassure himself. And the more he talked the more sure he was that Elliot&#39;s testicles were also on the small side. External hormone intake can cause testicular atrophy so he started to think that maybe Elliot was taking some testosterone or something cause he felt embarrassed about being so weak. &quot;Elliot, this is important, you haven&#39;t been taking any hormone supplements or any other drugs, right?&quot;<br />
&quot;Right. Why, is something wrong?<br />
&quot;Honestly, your testis seem much smaller than average. They don&#39;t exhibit all signs of atrophy, but I just wanted to make sure you&#39;re not on something...&quot;<br />
&quot;Dude! Do you really think I&#39;d inject myself with that stuff? That&#39;s how they always were!&quot;<br />
&quot;So your balls were always tiny?!&quot; Jim raised his voice a bit due to a mix of concern and disbelief.<br />
&quot;That&#39;s what I&#39;m telling you! You want me to call my doctor so you can ask him?&quot; Elliot responded, offended by the insinuation. He still couldn&#39;t blame Jim though. His doctor also thought like that when he first saw him. After all, a micro-penis was one thing, but having balls smaller in diameter than a nickel usually indicated some other problem.<br />
&quot;No, it&#39;s okay. I&#39;m sorry. I shouldn&#39;t have said that. Are they fully functional?&quot;<br />
&quot;It&#39;s fine, I don&#39;t mind. And you just saw me cum, of course they &#39;re functional&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, I just mean any other trouble like pain. Also, that could be a lot of seminal fluid and no sperm cells. Also, testis are also linked to libido. Other than physical stimulation, do you get erect from mental images or sight as well?&quot;<br />
&quot;No pain, and I&#39;m not sure about sperm count, you can get a sample if you want. I think my libido is pretty average. I also get turned on from watching porn too so all good there&quot;<br />
&quot;How often do you masturbate?&quot;<br />
&quot;About twice every three day or so.&quot; He was actually more self-conscious about his dick than he let on so he was too embarrassed to initiate anything sexual with Margaret. When they rarely did do something it was mostly her putting his dick between two of her fingers for a few seconds, until he came, and then him returning the favor with his hands. On his birthday he did get a blowjob though. Unfortunately he was already pretty turned on by then, and she already played a bit with his balls to get them out of the way, so he blew in about 10 seconds of the blowjob starting. Everything considered, masturbation was his usual way of getting off<br />
&quot;So pretty much everyday then? And would that be in addition to sexual relief you get when you&#39;re with Margaret?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, about every day. And we have sex about 2-3 times a week?&quot;<br />
&quot;Considering your... endurance, I assume she makes you cum all three of those days of the week pretty easily?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; If his friend wanted to assume that Margaret got him off 3 times a week, who was he to correct him?<br />
&quot;And how many times? You cum pretty easily so can you cum multiple times in a row? Does she make you cum many times on the 3 days a week you fool around?&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure how many, but yeah it&#39;s quite a lot. I don&#39;t have a problem having multiple orgasms so it&#39;s kinda fun for her to sometimes wring me out every once in a while&quot; The days Margaret came over were the days she would make him cum at least half a dozen times. It didn&#39;t even take her long. Unfortunately, since he was really tired after all that, her turn always came first. He had to &#39;earn&#39; his orgasms. It seems she became more dominant after she learned how easily he cried and he &#39;earned&#39; his orgasms a few times.<br />
&quot;I see. To be honest it seems the opposite of what I thought is true. I thought that because of your testis your libido would be low but not only do you masturbate every day, but you also cum with your girlfriend. You actually have a pretty huge libido, huh?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah. Truth is I get boners a couple of times during the day too. After I&#39;m done with Margaret I&#39;m always satisfied but I usually squeeze one out after I wake up each morning to keep me during work hours.&quot; Elliot always had a problem with his libido. School was especially awful since he had even less control over his body, not to mention he couldn&#39;t masturbate that openly. He almost came in his pants quite a few times. He ended up pretending to go for a jog each morning while he relieved himself in the most private public toilet he could find while stuffing his mouth to minimize the noise he was making. He still has wet dreams every now and then. Luckily, he is only a screamer when he is awake.<br />
&quot;Okay, I&#39;m gonna start examining you now, okay&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, go ahead&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, you go ahead and think of Margaret when he&#39;s doi-ugh. I swear next time you do that I&#39;ll hit you back and you won&#39;t fucking like it&quot;<br />
&quot;Stop saying stupid things and I&#39;ll stop hitting you&quot; Sam and Carl duo had their usual exchange <br />
Just as Jim touched Elliot&#39;s balls he saw that Elliot already got hard. Elliot had a big libido and Carl put Margaret&#39;s mental image in his head just as Jim was about to touch his balls, which gave him an unexpected stiffy at a bad time. <br />
&quot;Elliot... are you getting turned on from me touching your testicles?&quot; Jim asked, pretty deadpan<br />
&quot;Kinda. I mean, you know I have a big libido, right? It just sometimes gets the better of me. Just hurry up a bit and it&#39;&#39;s be fine&quot;<br />
&quot;Okay, just gimme a few seconds&quot; Jim carefully felt for lumps for a few more seconds when he saw Elliot&#39;s dick twitch a bit. Although Elliot was aroused he was actually pretty far from orgasm but Jim was a bit paranoid from before so moved completely to Elliot&#39;s side save for his hand which was still on Elliot&#39;s second ball, finishing up the exam.<br />
&quot;Your dick twitched again, are you about to cum again?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, sorry, let go now&quot; Jim let go and took another step to the side, but it seems Elliot already hit the point of no return. He closed his eyes and tried to stay still but after a couple of seconds he started moaning, followed by small stream of cum getting out of his dick, followed by the moaning turning into a full on scream.<br />
&quot;..Well, at least you gave me a heads up. Still that was even faster than usual, right?&quot;<br />
&quot;*pant* pant* Yeah, I think so. Why?&quot; Elliot managed to say, just before he calmed down enough to realise what just happened, again. At this point, maybe moving to a different city might not be so bad.<br />
&quot;Well, I mean, this is twice now, so I gotta ask. Are you also attracted to guys?&quot;<br />
&quot;I-Well, I kinda am, a bit, I guess? But not you guys. I mean, you know, I wasn&#39;t perving on any of you. It just kinda..you know?&quot;<br />
&quot;No, hmm, yeah. Sure. Anyway, we are done with the tests, for now. So...&quot;</p>
