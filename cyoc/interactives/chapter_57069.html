<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff is just standing there, on all fours pondering his embarrassing predicament, so full of shame. Meanwhile, Marcoh begins making preparations for Jeff's life in servitude for the Amish woman who should be along shortly to pick him up.<br />
<br />
With the new shoes in place, the last thing the donkey needs, was a halter, suitable for a donkey. He only had one halter left that matched the magic donkey shoes he placed on the boy's hooves. This halter, once he places it over the donkey's head, will force Jeff to remain calm, and to do his master's bidding, no matter how much he would like to protest. Even if taken off at a later time, once this halter is placed on him once, Jeff will remain a docile animal for life. He will have the freedom to bray all he wants, however.<br />
<br />
As Marcoh grabs this halter, he sees the poor, downtrodden animal who may already be broken in without having to place the final mark of the loss of his humanity over his face. Jeff is just standing there, with his head hanging, and lightly moaning. Marcoh almost felt sorry for Jeff, but the kid was the one that wanted to be trapped in that form forever. It wasn't his fault. Besides, he has to pay the bills somehow anyway. The whole point of being in business was to make profits. And boy was he going to make a tidy profit off this donkey named Jeff!<br />
<br />
But in any case, Marcoh tells Jeff about his new hardworking life he will have, once that halter is placed on him. Jeff, not doubting for one minute that such a thing could force him to work against his will for someone else with no rewards beyond food, began to get angry for the first time. <br />
<br />
&quot;This man just doesn't seem to get it! Or maybe he does, and is just simply going to make a profit off of me or something! I have to do something. It's one thing to be turned into an animal. It's a whole different story if I will be forced to breed with other dirty animals who were naturally born this way, and to possibly pull a big old plow behind me when I am not in heat!&quot;<br />
<br />
And so, Jeff began to buck wildly. As much as he possibly could in a body he still has yet to get used to.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa!&quot; says Dr. Marcoh. &quot;We can't have you going wild on me before getting this here halter over your head! Now, hold still boy!&quot; he said, as he has another trick up his sleeve. <br />
<br />
Pressing another button at his work bench, he activates a large magnet underneath the floor of his workshop. This is quite a powerful magnet, and he's always pretty reluctant to use such a thing. It renders many of his tools useless, as he cannot take them off their hooks, since they would be stuck to the floor with the thing activated. But, in situations when an animal that has been shod becomes unruly, he can simply activate the magnet, forcing their hooves to be stuck to the ground.<br />
<br />
From Jeff's perspective, he was trying to make his way over to the exit, and in his panic, he figured out how to kick out backwards with his hind legs. As embarrassing as it is to act like a stubborn jackass.....as a jackass....the last thing he wanted was to have that halter placed over him!<br />
<br />
As he was bucking about, he felt a tingling sensation go through his body, and all four of his legs became stuck to the floor, as if they were glued down or something. Noticing he couldn't lift his legs any longer, Jeff attempted to say &quot;WTF? Now what?&quot; But only brayed like a stupid jackass that he had become in body, if not mind. <br />
<br />
&quot;I have a very powerful magnet underneath the floor boards. It's to keep animals such as you from destroying anything, or hurting themselves if they go into any kind of panic. That's why I wanted to place shoes on you as quickly as possible. I figured you might get a bit uncomfortable with the idea of being stuck as a donkey forever. You may have thought the idea of becoming a donkey would be cool, but I figured once you found out just how boring the rest of your life will be, you would start something with me in here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So he DOES at least know, or suspect, that I don’t want to be an animal any longer! Wait, I never  even wanted to be this to begin with!&quot; brayed Jeff. &quot;Hee-haww, heee-haww!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can't even freaking talk! This sucks! Now I can't move! And here he comes with that thing! Oh no!&quot;<br />
<br />
Coming over to Jeff with the halter in hand, he began swinging his head from side-to-side.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now now, Jeff. I have a way to forcefully place this on your head, but it will be extremely painful. That I guarantee! And you know I have a way to do so!&quot;<br />
<br />
So, once again, from Jeff's perspective:<br />
<br />
&quot;Here I am, completely color-blind. Four legs that end in useless hooves. A big-ass body that extends out six feet behind me, that ends in a stupid-looking donkey tail with a tuft at the end. I have a large, disgusting penis hanging down below me that is always overly sensitive and stiff. I have HUGE ears that stick up. I have a large disgusting sour donkey tongue, with large blocky yellow teeth. Ugh, and my tongue can lick my big disgusting wet donkey nose as well! And my ass, ears, and back are itching. And I can't even speak! Instead, I just make ugly-sounding donkey brays. And there is nothing I can do about it! Not now. Not after he put those damned shoes on my hooves.....&quot;Hooves!!&quot; *shudder* Can't believe I am not thinking of my hands and feet anymore. Only of my HOOVES. Maybe it would be best to just....get used to this...&quot;<br />
<br />
After telling Jeff about how painful his method of getting the halter over his head, Marcoh observed the donkey actually not panicking for once, and just standing there, looking through dull-looking donkey eyes. Unsure of whether or not Jeff was contemplating something, or if the boy really is losing his mind to the animal without having the chronivac do it for him. <br />
<br />
For the first time, the donkey raises his head, and looks directly at the mad doctor who is standing in front of Jeff, holding the halter near him so he could see it. Jeff, just standing there looking at him, was once again thinking some more:<br />
<br />
&quot;So, once I open my mouth to allow him to put that bit in, I will lose all of my will to move around on my own. I will just be stuck with doing whatever it is a human wants me to do. Now, I am referring to &quot;Them&quot; as &quot;Human!&quot; Well, they are human. But so am I! Aren't I? Ugh, if open my mouth, I probably won’t be any longer. Or maybe I will in mind only, but without the will. I'll be stuck with my human intelligence, forced to do what is essentially manual slave labor, as nothing but a beast of burden, only meant to do hard work outside pulling plows, and making other normal donkey babies.....I should at least ask him to give me the intelligence of a donkey....to take away my human intelligence. Afterall, it's useless to me if I know how to drive a car, do math, and play video games if I can't actually physically do those things! Jeez, what a waste of a perfectly good human brain!&quot;<br />
<br />
Attempting to ask the evil doctor to take his human mind from him, Jeff opened his mouth, and.....brayed! Nothing but a bunch of idiotic-sounding, &quot;Hee-hawws&quot; escaped his lips once again!<br />
<br />
Acting quickly, Marcoh shoved the bit into Jeff's mouth, ran to the side, and quickly placed the rest of the halter over the donkey's head<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn! I forgot I can't talk! Fuck! He got that damned thing in place all too quickly as well! Ah! That bit is weird! It tastes  sour! I can't move my tongue around....gah!&quot; *gagging in a braying sort of way.*<br />
<br />
&quot;Hahaha, your gagging! Well, I forgot to tell you, this is a used halter. I used it on my previous donkey I owned myself. Although, that was a real donkey, born as an animal. Thinking about that, that's kinda gross....&quot; said Marcoh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway, I can now safely turn off that magnet. You should be quite docile by now. hahaha.&quot;<br />
<br />
Damn. Damn, damn, damn! Looking at himself in the mirror, with not only the dirty, embarrassing body of a donkey, but now with a halter, the situation is even worse. Suddenly, the tingling coming from his hooves ceases.<br />
<br />
Marcoh told him the magnet is now off. So, attempting to raise his front right leg (that used to be his dominant hand, but only ends in a useless donkey hoof now,) suddenly, it became numb, and couldn't lift it any higher than an inch off the ground. It was as though his hoof or the shoes on the bottom of the hoof, suddenly began to weigh a hundred pounds. <br />
<br />
Attaching some leather reigns to Jeffs new halter, Marcoh began leading Jeff out to the barn, which will be his temporary home. As he began leading him, Jeff's legs had no problem moving with the man, even though he didn't purposely attempt to move them. They were moving on their own accord, leading him to certain doom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good. Now this will be much easier getting you back through the door out of my workshop to the outside, now that you can actually walk like a normal animal,&quot; said Marcoh.<br />
<br />
Approaching the door, Jeff began to try to rear his head back, but his neck became stiff, and his head numb. Just like his leg did earlier when he tried raising it. <br />
<br />
As he was preparing to walk through the doorway, Jeff's eye was able to catch one last glimpse of himself in the mirror. <br />
<br />
&quot;A donkey! Just a total and complete donkey. That's what I am now. I don't even recognize myself at all. Loot at that tail hanging above that ass for all the world to see. And I can feel it too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly, his head was out in the fresh air. It was a sunny, and bright day, so full of color and life. But unfortunately for Jeff, he couldn't really see much more than a dozen feet in front of him, and the world looked all washed-out in nothing but tones of blacks, whites, and grays. For Jeff, the world will never be a right and colorful place any longer. It will only be a dreary, foggy place, no matter how sunny it may get.<br />
<br />
Leading Jeff to the farm's barn, Marcoh finally takes off his halter. He flips the switch to turn on the electric fence, and said to the donkey; &quot;Now you are free to roam about as you will, but within the confines of the electric fence. Long as this fence is turned on, you will be unable to trample over it, due to the magic of the halter that is now instilled in your brain.&quot;<br />
<br />
And so, finally for the first time, Marcoh turned to leave Jeff to his own devices, shutting the door to the barn. Looking about, the section he was in, was just simply a roof over top of where animal fodder was placed. Behind him, was just open field. The rest of the barn was through that door. As was the switch to turn off the electricity to the fence, which could lead to his freedom. If only he could just stick his arm through the crack of the door to grab. But, he had no arms and hands with which to work with. But he did have a powerful hind kick.<br />
<br />
So, Jeff decided to clumsily turn all the way around, with his ass sticking towards the door. Attempting to kick out with his hind legs, suddenly they became numb, and unable to move, as his front right leg had done before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dammit! So I AM a docile animal now! I am a human, trapped in the body of a ridiculously ugly and dirty farm animal. An animal that sounds as ridiculous as it looks when it tries to say something.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, man.&quot; &quot;Haww...haww...&quot;<br />
<br />
Poor Jeff, how he always so quickly forgets he is unable to speak!<br />
<br />
Throughout the rest of that day, all the poor former child could do, was just stand around. He wa just standing there, getting hungry, and getting hungry quickly. Eyeing up the food in the bin that was placed there for him, Jeff was just thinking;<br />
<br />
&quot;no way am I going to stick my head in there, and eat like an animal. No way, no way, no way!&quot;<br />
<br />
But, he did just that. Approaching the oats in that bin, he wanted to grab some. But seeing as he was unable to do so since his front legs ended in blocky hooves, he had no choice but to dip his big old face into the bin, and eat.<br />
<br />
Trying to grab it with his large teeth, his big slimy ugly tongue came rolling out. Bringing it backc into his mouth, he was able to pluck some of the oats up. <br />
<br />
It was quite sweet, and tasted of honey. Honey and oats. That's all? Jeff thought it was going to be some nasty animal food, but this is food he would have eaten as a human, no questions asked! And so, he began chowing down. <br />
<br />
By the time he was finished and full, it was getting dark out, and the bin was nearly empty. Looking at that large bin, Jeff thought &quot;Damn! I ate all of that!? Of course, I suppose being a 500 pound animal, that's a normal meal now....&quot;<br />
<br />
Yawning out a &quot;Heeeeeeeeee------haaaaaaawwwwww&quot; Jeff started getting tired. It has been a long day, and so, he finally closed his eyes....</p>
