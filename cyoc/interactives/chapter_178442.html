<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I just marched up the stairs and into Amelia room now my new room but there was Someone already in there, it was Amelia&#39;s.... now my big sister Cassandra, who was my twin sister and one of my best friends but now I was her annoying little sister that she hated the most in the family. She looked at me and asked me to sit. After I sat down for some time we didn&#39;t know what to say as it felt really awkward so I asked &quot;what are you doing in Amelia&#39;s room Cassi?&quot; to which she replied slowly &quot; I was thinking of sharing my room with you and letting Amelia stay in her old room as I feel that you mustn&#39;t be feeling too good after going through such a major change and I feel that you would need someone to teach on how to properly handle a female body&quot;.<br />
I was a bit startled at how kind my sister was towards me, even when I became Amelia but when I heard the latter part I once again started to feel a bit sad that now I would have to handle Amelia&#39;s female body and do girly stuff like makeups, periods... Uhhhh! I thought to myself as I replied to Cassi with a reassured look &quot; I will do fine and I would have to get used to it sometime soon anyways after all there currently isn&#39;t any way to change the fact that I am Amelia and from now on you will be my big sister, so you should call me Amelia and I don&#39;t think that it would be right for me to rely on my big sister a lot and If you are always with me how could I explore my new body&quot; I said this to Cassi to not make her burden about my true feelings with a very cinematic smile awkwardly while feeling embarrassed at the words I spoke to her.<br />
She was after all my best sister so how could she not figure out that I was lying to not make her feel bad, so she asked me &quot; Are you sure, you don&#39;t want me to share a room with you, like when you were still David?&quot; I sadly said, &quot; No, I don&#39;t wish to share a room with anyone for now and if a shared a room with you I won&#39;t be able to adjust myself to start living my life as Amelia.&quot; After what I said Cassi became silent nodded but she still couldn&#39;t hide the loving care for me, then she thought of something and asked meaningfully with a bright smile as to change this gloomy topic &quot; Now that I think about it you haven&#39;t taken a bath since you last went to the hospital and it has been around 10 hours since then, so we should really get you in for a nice bath and we can also increase our brother-sister bond.. uhh, I mean sisterly bond that I couldn&#39;t do when it was Amelia in there as she didn&#39;t understand my feelings at all&quot; she said a little grumpily very dissatisfied with Amelia but when I heard her say this I couldn&#39;t help but give her a little hug and say &quot;we can make a new start today by taking first steps towards our sisterly love&quot;.  As I said this Cassi didn&#39;t gave me another chance to speak and just dragged me towards the bathroom and started to help with strip up, which made me feel a little embarrassed getting undressed in front of my sister, even though currently we are both girls.<br />
After getting naked we both went inside and Cassi offered to help me teach about things a girl need to do when taking a bath like tying your hairs when you enter the bathtub and that girls have sensitive skins which shouldn&#39;t be washed roughly, etc. After washing our bodies we went inside the bathtub together which was filled with some sort of essential oils that Cassi said would make my skin softer, which I didn&#39;t really care about at first, but when I entered it I felt my body relax quite a bit. I said to Cassi while remembering about the past &quot; Cassi, do you remember the last time we went inside the bath together, it was around when we were 5, at that time we used to see who can hold our breaths longer in the bathtub and now we get to do the same really feels good, it seems being Amelia won&#39;t be so bad if I get to enjoy more quality time with you Cassi as we did before&quot;. Cassandra smiling said, &quot; Yes, it seems we would become the best sisters, not like me and that old Amelia&quot;. I laughed when she mentioned Amelia as old, which really befitted her now as she is 2 years older than me physically.<br />
After drying ourselves we went back to Amelia&#39;s now my new room to get a change of clothes for me, when we came to what seemed like a closet of Amelia&#39;s, Cassi opened it to show me all the clothes of different styles and colour that were mine now, uh, She picked out a plain-looking outfit which consists of a blouse and jeans, which she asked me whether I liked it or not, to which I instinctively frowned, which Cassi noticed and asked &quot;what happened do you not like my choice of clothes?&quot; to which replied by saying &quot; It seems by instincts are of Amelia&#39;s body which prefers more girly clothes, so I let out a frowned expression even without me noticing, I wasn&#39;t trying to make you sad&quot; after I said this hugged her to comfort her unconsciously. To which she smiled and said, &quot;if that is so then I will find you something that Amelia used to brag to me about how girly it looked on her&quot;. I wanted to say something but she just went over rummaging over to the closet and bringing with her some clothes which she didn&#39;t show me at first and told me &quot; Come, Amelia, today big sister will dress you and give you a big surprise. So close our eyes and follow with big sisters instructions, okay?&quot; with a big grin on her face. I knew that whatever she planned I wouldn&#39;t like it too, and it would be more of a shock than a surprise for me but I still nodded to her so I wouldn&#39;t make her sad. <br />
She asked me to wear some sort of clothing while blindfolding me. After making me wear the clothing she made me sat down on a stool and removed my blindfold but still asked me to close my eyes to which I readily as she couldn&#39;t make it any worse than making me wear a skirt that I can feel from through the breeze below my legs. It seems she was giving me makeup and hairstyle, though I do appreciate the hairstyling because ever since I became Amelia her hair has always come in front of my eyes though it didn&#39;t seem to cause me any problem since I still possess the motor skills of Amelia, so I appreciated Cassi doing my hair so that it wouldn&#39;t come in front of my eyes.<br />
After Cassi was done with it, she held my hand and said &quot;You can now open your eyes, Amelia, see how you look&quot;. When she said this I opened my I saw a 14-year-old cute girl sitting in front of a mirror with a cute french ponytail hairstyle wearing a cute blue coloured one-piece dress, one could also see a bit of her pink coloured lace panties beneath her one-piece skirt. The girl was Amelia, now me, when I looked at how cute I looked I felt a little proud at my body&#39;s assets, which inevitably let out a big smile on my face unconsciously. When Cassi saw she was smiling and told me &quot; David, I know its new and all for you to be a girl, but you should really try to enjoy it and you should sometimes let your guard down to Amelia&#39;s instincts. So try relaxing and taking it as a roleplaying game for starters for example and try to play it according to a third person, maybe you&#39;ll come to enjoy it&quot;. When I heard my sister say this I felt emotional and couldn&#39;t hold it anymore and burst out with tears while letting out all of my emotions while saying to Cassi &quot; Cassi, I am really scared about how I am going to live my life as Amelia, I tried to show a strong front because I didn&#39;t want to upset everyone as it was my own decision but I still cant help but feel scared.., Uuhhuhhhhhhhhh................&quot; I cried for some time and Cassi comforted me like a little girl while patting my forehead and saying &quot; Its only natural to feel scared to try something new, but I know how difficult it is to accept a change so don&#39;t push yourself and release your frustrations out, then you won&#39;t fell that much scared&quot; As I heard her say this I relaxed a bit but I still didn&#39;t stop crying in her lap until I lost my energy and fell asleep. Cassi let me sleep on her lap while caressing my face and hairs, she muttered to herself &quot; I really wish that from now on you and I will continue to be best friends as well as best sisters though now we have a 2 year age difference it doesn&#39;t matter much as we are sisters&quot;.<br />
I woke up from my mothers shout to come downstairs for dinner. When I woke up I saw Cassi still caressing me like how a mother does to her child when she is sleeping which made me a little embarrassed, So I changed the topic and said &quot;let&#39;s go downstairs for dinner&quot;.<br />
But before I could leave the room Cassi caught my hand and said &quot; Little Sis you should really look at how you look right now&quot;. When she said that I looked in the mirror to see Amelia&#39;s face with little teary red eyes which looked really sad. I immediately asked Cassi &quot; How do I fix it, I can&#39;t let others know that I cried, If they knew they will feel very sad, please help me fix it&quot;. I pleaded to Cassi, to which she readily agreed. After getting my face fixed we went downstairs. As I started climbing the stairs I remembered I was wearing a one-piece, which made me a little embarrassed, when I was walking I walked in a catwalk manner highlighting the curves and cuteness of my figure to which I didn&#39;t have any control over it.<br />
When I and Cassi entered the dining table we saw our Mom asking us to sit down. Just when I was about to sit at my usual seat my Mom said &quot; Amelia that is your big brother David&#39;s seat, so please go and get seated at your own seat&quot;. I grumbled to myself how it was my seat just yesterday, but now. I still went to Amelia&#39;s seat and sat down. Amelia&#39;s seat was in between Casi and Melody&#39;s seat. At the dining table only Dad and Amelia weren&#39;t there.<br />
My Mom saw that there were only us girls and said &quot; Girls since its only us right now, I wanted to discuss something with you especially you Amelia, I know it&#39;s new and all being a girl but you would have to just get used to it, so you and the rest of us girls will go over to my favourite spa where we can get ourselves to our heart&#39;s content and it will be beneficial for Amelia to understand the pleasures of being a woman after enjoying something fun.&quot; I wasn&#39;t that enthusiastic about it but my little sister melody was really excited about and even Cassi who wasn&#39;t that big fan of makeup had a big smile on her face. As if Mom remembered something and said to me &quot;Amelia, I and your father have decided to let you take a 15 day leave from school to let you assimilate everything about your new lifestyle. Do you understand now young lady?&quot; I replied &quot;Yes Mom&quot;.<br />
When We were taking about girly stuff I couldn&#39;t hold it and ask Mom &quot; Mom where is father and Amelia right now?&quot;. To which my mother replied and said &quot; Your father and big brother are doing some man to man talk which us girls don&#39;t need to care about, so let&#39;s discuss our trip.....</p>
