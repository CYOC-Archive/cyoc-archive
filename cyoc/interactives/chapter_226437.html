<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Now. To resurrect you back into this world!&quot; Loki boomed far above his small little head. <br />
<br />
Jeff began to feel relief that this might not be permanent, but rather as a demonstration of the former statue&#39;s power. Unfortunately for him, he couldn&#39;t be more wrong.<br />
<br />
The green moss that was slightly and partially covering the other rabbit statue, began to retract from its stone body. It&#39;s eyes turned black and began darting around. The black irises shrank and a more human-like quality took over. A spark of human intelligence entered those eyes. <br />
<br />
The stone began to melt away, as it&#39;s ears began twitching. Then shrinking, and moving to the side of its head. It began to grow larger, already towerimg above poor little Jeff. It stood upright. The face morphed into that of a cute, if slightly mischievous, Italian-looking teenage boy. A spitting image of Jeff&#39;s face! <br />
<br />
Former Jeff mentally gasped. He couldn&#39;t physically do it. His cute little rabbit face and body remained completely stiff and rock-hard. <br />
<br />
Larger and larger it grew, as it left out a long-awaited sight. Jeff&#39;s dark and wavy hair grew on his doppleganger&#39;s head, while he broke out into a winning boyish grin. Larger and larger he grew, standing straight up on two legs! As a human, Jeff wasn&#39;t very tall. But the new Jeff with his body, completely dwarfed the old Jeff stuck in its stony little prison on the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh. No....&quot; He thought, as he was stuck staring uselessly out of his stony eyes at this new development.<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s clothes began to appear on his body. The eyes softened into the nice soft chococalate-colored eyes of Jeff! Grey fur retracting. Revealing the nice even tan and smooth human skin tone of a really young and innocent-looking teenage male! Even Jeff&#39;s small little mole near his nose on his right cheek appeared. A perfect carbon copy of Jeff! <br />
<br />
Jeff would have whimpered in growing trepidation if he could. His doppleganger stretched his arms and legs. Flexing his fingers. Jeff&#39;s fingers! A grin spreading across his face, revealing Jeff&#39;s own perfect pearly white teeth!<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahhhh, thank you!&quot; The former rabbit statue said in Jeff&#39;s voice. &quot;Thank so much! For giving me life! For giving me that boy&#39;s life! I&#39;m going to enjoy being a young human male! Especially a cute boyish one!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No problem......JEFFREY!&quot; said the voice of Loki.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh....oh no....&quot; Jeff thought with growing dread as he struggled in vain to move. To move anything. To move ANYTHING at all! But stone figurines like Jeff must remain totally motionless! <br />
<br />
The new Jeff bent down toward the statue-trapped rabbit Jeff. He could only sit there. Totally without motion. Staring through his lifeless gray orbs of eyes. Completely at the mercy of anyone any anything to pick him up and move him howver they wish.<br />
<br />
He could only stare at his own face. That was no longer his face, he realized with horror! His FORMER face that was now controlled by some other entity. He could only watch as a crooked, cocky, but really cute smile was on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Am I REALLY that good-looking?&quot; He thought with a moment of calm before the mental storm would break in realizing the gravity of his situation.<br />
<br />
It was really weird and disconcerting looking at himself looking down at himself as a small little rabbit statue. <br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t know I was actually THAT nice looking,&quot; Jeff&#39; thought continued unabated. He was surprised at how cute he really was, looking deep into his former human eyes while it was bent down over top of him. Studying him. The soft brown sparkling human eyes really were rather dreamy. <br />
<br />
Jeff could only watch as his former body, the one he knew and lived with his entire life, used his own hands and fingers to reach down and pick him up! He couldn&#39;t believe just how reduced his mass was, to be picked up so easily! But he found he enjoyed being cradled within his own very youthful soft warm hands. He could feel the heartbeat pulsing through those former veins of his against his hard stoney surface. <br />
<br />
The new Jeff now in control of his human body, looked directly and deeply into Jeff&#39;s rabbity lifeless stone orbs of his eyes as he was lifted straight up at eye-level. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shit! Oh God!&quot; Thought Jeff as he was afraid of heights. &quot;Put me down! Please! Put me down!&quot; He was only 5 and a half feet off the ground at this point, but to Jeff&#39;s small perspective, it was practically a mile!<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know if you can hear me; if you&#39;re still in there,&quot; his doppleganger began in Jeff&#39;s clear young teenage male voice....<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, he most definitely is,&quot; Loki said from behind him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh. Well,&quot; the doppleganger Jeff continued. &quot;Thank you giving up your life for me. I&#39;ll make sure to put it to good use!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait ...wait...no!&quot; Jeff tried to say. But remained completely motionless and expressionless, nestled in his own former human hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll put you into the exact spot where the statue I was created from was sitting. That way, you can take it&#39;s place as I take yours,&quot; he said as he began reaching down to position Jeff into the very same exact spot on the ground the former rabbit statue had occupied for some extended period of time! Just a dirt patch in the shape of his underside, surrounded by healthy grass. A large juicy earthworm was hiding out in that location.<br />
<br />
&quot;No....no...please!&quot; Jeff tried with all his might as that very exact spot came closer and closer. <br />
<br />
Contact with the ground! Jeff&#39;s body settled into its new but old home. Exactly where the former rabbit statue had occupied a few moments earlier! <br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s warm, soft, former fingers unwrapped themselves from his body. He stood up, looking down at the poor former Jeff. Still with his mischievously cute crooked smile. <br />
<br />
Jeff was yelling inside his trapped mind, as he was stuck staring out of the solid stone orbs of a stone rabbit that was now his! HE was now that stupid rabbit statue! Stuck in its former tiny little patch of ground, position looking at the same exact spot it&#39;s lifeless eyes have been looking for god only knew how long while Jeff went school. Hung out with friends. Played video games. Went to usement parks. Ate his mom&#39;s cooking. Day after day. Night after night. Month after months. Through good weather and bad, as this stupid stone rabbit sat totally motionless the entire time, slowly growing black moss between his toes and green moss on its back. <br />
<br />
Unable to do anything at all, but to stare silently out at the world from his much-diminished position. Realization dawning on him of what the implications were while he was stuck looking at the exact duplicate of his former human body that he was born with and knew his entire life up until just a few moments ago! Only five minutes ago, he WAS that boy before him! <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure it&#39;s still conscious in there?&quot; he asked Loki.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yup! He&#39;s definitely still there! And there, he shall remain!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh. Ok. Well. I was never conscious until now. But I&#39;m just glad I&#39;m not him.&quot; the new Jeff said, checking out his new-found hands, arms, and chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;You weren&#39;t conscious as that statue, no. That statue was just a plain old hunk of rock, until I called you forth from the grave of someone who had died and was buried here. An old man who died 250 years ago during the Civil War. I called your dormant spirit or essence or whatever you want to call it, into a stone rabbit. Then gave you life as a fine young Italian-American boy of just 14 years old age.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Soooo....uuuhhh....what now?&quot; He asked, turning away from statufied bunny Jeff, who was now practically panicking and screaming in his own mind. Desparate to move. To speak. To do....well....ANYTHING, really, other than just sit there like a useless hunk of decorative garden rock all beginning to being covered by moss! <br />
<br />
&quot;Well. Now we go back to your home. Where you shall begin taking over Jeff&#39;s life.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay. Sounds good to me....&quot; replies the new Jeff, as he turned and began to walk away with Jeff&#39;s body and his life with Loki the Demon by his side!<br />
<br />
&quot;NOOOOooo!!!!! THEY.....THEY CANT LEAVE ME HERE!!  NOT LIKE THIS!!? OH....OH GOD!!! I can&#39;t....I can&#39;t....fucking....MOOOOVE!!!&quot; Jeff was panic-thinking as he was stuck staring at that damned mirror of a small statue bunny left in a garden at the base of a large tree! <br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s heart would be pounding in a panic-driven manner as all sorts of thoughts flew through his mind while trapped on the ground like this. Completely motionless. His large bunny-shaped ears stuck up in the air. His head low, almost resting on the ground between his twoarge stone bunny paws. Thoughts of what an imposter might do with his life. His body. His reputation! He couldn&#39;t believe he was a stone representation of a cute little rabbit! <br />
<br />
He had to get out of this situation! He just HAD to! But what could he possibly do!? <br />
<br />
NOTHING!<br />
<br />
He could do absolutely NOTHING! <br />
<br />
He could nothing but sit there! Sit there and stare out at the world in complete silence and stillness while his mind raged! Raged against its humiliating and diminutuve prison! <br />
<br />
While Jeff&#39;s mind was raging and panicking inside of a random statue of a stone rabbit at the foot of some tree with some random mirror that someone left leaning against it, the world was quiet. The grass was green. The sky was blue. Some bird was chirping happily overhead. Leaves were rustling in the light breeze. All was quiet and still, except inside the mind of Jeff. Just some stone rabbit.</p>
