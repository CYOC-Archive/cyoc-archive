<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">His seventeenth birthday came and went, the school term started, and still Patrick did nothing new with the Chronivac. Had he been truthful with himself, he&#39;d know he was avoiding the subject by finding other things to occupy his time. He tried to repair his friendship with the three others he used to hang out with before receiving the computer programme, but the problem was, they had drifted too far apart and now their individual interests were so separate, it was like a canyon existed between them, with Patrick believing he was to blame, as nearly everything they were interested in, did, he found boring, stupid, or immature.<br />
<br />
When it was obvious it was no longer possible for him to hang out with the same people any longer, he almost turned his attention back to the Chronivac, thinking it might help fix the situation. But, at the last moment, he instead turned his focus to other matters, and after some time, tried to work out if he was gay and what exactly it meant and entailed to be so.<br />
<br />
The problem he learned with this was he had no idea how to tackle the issue. There was no one he could talk to, he had no knowledge or experience, and the only things he had to go on was what a computer programme told him and a series of odd dreams which wouldn&#39;t leave him. Trying to tell himself, &quot;I am not gay,&quot; &quot;I do not want to love a guy,&quot; &quot;And I certainly do not want to be female,&quot; among other things only served to depress and confuse him. Reflecting back over his life, struggling to discover some hint which would give him the answer whether or not he was so, Patrick was stymied by how he was unable to find a definitive answer. Thinking of the times he&#39;d tried to ask a girl out, all because either his friends had goaded him or there was some societal pressure which was telling him to do so, he also mulled over how, each time, he&#39;d become flummoxed, turned a strange shade of red, and excused himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;But that&#39;s no proof right there,&quot; he tried to tell himself.<br />
<br />
Frustrated by any sort of answer which could set him straight, Patrick again almost turned to the Chronivac to solve the conundrum facing him. And again, found something to distract him.<br />
<br />
He wasn&#39;t entirely sure why he bought the thing he purchased. Scrolling through the internet, bouncing from sites on what he was supposed to be researching for a take-home project for his science class to random searches about animal facts to ways to determine a person&#39;s sexual orientation, he stopped when he was re-directed to a website aimed at crossdressers, transgenders, cosplay, drag queens, along with woman who&#39;d had mastectomy surgery. Feeling as if he ought to close the tab and try his last search again, Patrick instead browsed the options, all whilst telling himself, &quot;I&#39;d never buy anything like this,&quot; in an unconvincing tone. Clicking a link which took him to a section comprised of silicone bodysuits and silicone breast plates, he stared at the options, and was overcome with a sense of nostalgia.<br />
<br />
For some time, he&#39;d tried to convince himself it had been a mistake giving himself breasts, altering his body and the world around him until people saw him as a girl. But much in the same way he was confused about his sexual identity, he felt the same now about altering areas of his body. Doubling clicking on an option which could match his skin tone, he read the description, &quot;Swimsuit-style Body Suit B Cup Crotch Hair Optional Vaginal Tube Included Catheter Included Easy to Put On and Take Off Made of Experimental Medical Grade Silicone which Feels and Looks Realistic.&quot; Scrolling through the page, he learned more about the item, including it was designed so the wearer could pee sitting down like a girl, have sex like a female, the breast area was designed to have the weight and jiggle of real breasts, and there was an option for perfect match skin tone.<br />
<br />
With a few clicks, Patrick used the laptop cameras to take a proper image of his face and hands. Uploading it, the site blinked and Patrick found himself looking at a product which claimed matched his skin tone and would not be seen. Feeling this was unbelievable, he almost closed the tab. But once again, he instead clicked on a few options to darken the nipples and surrounding area a smidge, making them a lighter shade of red instead of pale pink, shift the bellybutton so it was the same shade as the skin tone instead of a dark red, covered the crotch with a light brushing of short, curly hair which was the same shade as what was atop his head, and lastly lightened the shading of the vulva to more of a pink. Thinking this might be a way for him to experiment without having to use the Chronivac, Patrick checked the price and after a bit more hesitation, placed the order, closed the tab, and went back to his browsing, all the while questioning whether he made the right decision in placing the order until, becoming engrossed in the homework he had to do, the subject was driven from his mind.<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t give his purchase any more thought until the day it arrived. After he&#39;d signed for the package, taken it up to his room, opened the box, as well as the box and bag inside, and looked at, Patrick questioned his decision to buy such a thing. Looking like a woman&#39;s swimsuit which had been designed to look like the torso, groin, and buttocks area of a female, he could see it opened in the back, would stretch to cover him, in which it&#39;d pull tight once he had it on, and the two areas in the back would fit flush together, leaving no seam, but coming apart with a mere tug on either side of where the seam would be. Not believing it would fit, he undressed and almost tried it on, but at the last moment, he instead headed for the upstairs bathroom, where he proceeded to shave off his body area, shower, then, as the online description suggested, apply a light sprinkling of talcum powder to the inside of the body suit, as well as over his own torso, groin, and backside. Splitting the back open, he stepped in, wriggled it up, and after a bit, managed to slip his penis in the catheter before pulling it the rest of the way up, causing in the process for his cock and balls to be pulled snuggly betwixt his legs, leaving the front flat.<br />
<br />
In front of the bathroom mirror, Patrick stared at his reflection. Still having questions about himself, what he was doing, if he ought to have bought what he now had on, he turned one way, then the other. Cupping the breasts, feeling how realistic they felt, their heft, the way the nipples pressed into the palms of his hands, he slid a hand down. The rest of bodysuit feeling realistic to the touch, he brushed the public area and the hair covering, noting how it somehow felt both course and soft, placed the hand between his legs and traced the tip of a finger over the female genitals. Finding the tube which connected to the catheter, allowing him to pee sitting down, then the vagina opening, he withdrew his hand after a moment. Continuing to stare at his reflection, he decided what he was seeing wasn&#39;t believable, and he looked like nothing more than a guy who just so happened to have tits and genitalia betwixt his legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you expect,&quot; Patrick huffed as he considered taking it all off and returning it.<br />
<br />
Instead, he reached for a towel, and after deliberating on it, wrapped it around his torso, liking as he did how it reminded him of how he covered himself when he&#39;d given himself breasts. Giving his reflection a last look, and still conflicted, he headed back to his room. Glad his mom wasn’t home, he closed the bedroom door, and still wearing nothing but the towel and bodysuit, he sat at his desk. Booting up his laptop, feeling now he had to access the Chronivac and use it, and was ready to do so, he logged into the desktop, clicked the Chronivac icon, then entered the password to access his profile. Scrolling through the information, he rubbed a finger against his cheek in a distracted manner as he considered what he might change.</p>
