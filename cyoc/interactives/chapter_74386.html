<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chad had barely glanced at the clothes he pulled on in the dim light of the field house.  But outside in the full daylight, he quickly noticed that the striped belt around his waist was a <i>rainbow striped</i> belt and the short sleeve shirt was really <i>pink</i>.  He looked down at the shoes and muttered under his breath.  He knew whose clothing he was wearing now.  He dared to utter the name aloud and was horrified even more by what he heard.  He recognized the clothes as belonging to that effeminate gay kid with a lisp.<br>
<br>
"Thtevie," Brad uttered.  It was his own voice, but it sounded higher-pitched and much more effeminate.  And he couldn't help but talk with a lisp, just like that fag Stevie.<br>
<br>
Gasping, Brad realized that he needed to find someone to help him.  He glanced down at his body again and realized that, while he was still himself, he looked much more slender than normal and maybe a little shorter.  The clothing he wore was skintight, making anyone who saw him think that he was trying to show his body off.  Well, the first chance he got, he was going to change clothes.<br>
<br>
Briskly walking back to the school, Brad spotted three guys he recognized.  Mike, Doug, and Rick.  They were his teammates on the football team.  If anyone could help him, it was them.<br>
<br>
As he walked over to them, he couldn't help but walk like a girl, limp wrists and swinging hips.  He must have looked ridiculous!  But ever since he put on Stevie's clothes, he couldn't stop acting like that little queer.<br>
<br>
"Hey, boyth," Brad said.  Wait, why did he say that?  He meant to say "guys", not "boys".  Well, no matter.  He got their attention.  Now was his chance.  Once he explained to these guys what happened to him, they'd help out.  He had known them for years.  Brad opened his mouth, but instead of asking for help, he said something else.  "I'm in the mood for thome cockth.  Ya got any?"  Brad was horrified.  What the hell?  What did he just say?<br>
<br>
"Piss off, you fag," Doug said.<br>
<br>
"Yeah," Rick agreed.<br>
<br>
"Wait a minute, dudes," Mike said, raising up his hands.  "I think I might just be able to help this fag out."  With that, he unzipped his jeans and dropped them, then he pulled down his boxer shorts, causing his limp cock to bounce out.  "Come and get it, fag."<br>
<br>
Brad wanted to run.  To get as far away from this as possible.  But his feet and legs wouldn't turn.  Instead, he actually found himself walking closer to Mike, and then kneeling down in front of him!  Now Mike's cock was right in his face ... and ... it was beautiful!  No ... wait, what?  Why was he feeling this way?  He moved closer, but then thankfully Mike stopped him.<br>
<br>
"Not so fast, queer.  If you do this, then you have to do something for me when we're done.  Deal?"<br>
<br>
Brad wanted to scream "no deal", but instead found himself shaking his head "yes".<br>
<br>
"Okay, then have at it."<br>
<br>
And Brad did.  The moment he had permission, his mouth was around Mike's cock faster than lightning.  As he licked his tongue around it, he actually felt the thing grow stiffer and stiffer.  He thought it would disgust him, but to his horror, it didn't.  In fact, it was turning him on and he felt his own cock grow stiff in response.<br>
<br>
"That's it, Bradley," Mike said, catching Brad's attention.<br>
<br>
So, wait ... Mike knew it was him?  Then why was he treating him like a gay boy?  And why did he call him Bradley?  No one ever called him that, except maybe his mom, sometimes.  Brad hated the name Bradley.  To him, it sounded, well, like a sissy name.  The name Brad sounded a lot cooler.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, the cock in Brad's mouth twitched.  After having countless girls give him blowjobs over the years, he knew what that meant.  Mike was about to cum.  Brad braced himself.  He didn't want it to happen, but he was unable to do anything about it.  And then it happened.  A sudden rush of warm salty goo filled his mouth, and ... he loved it.  It horrified him, but it was true.  He loved the taste.  What was happening to him?  And then he swallowed.<br>
<br>
Mike pulled his cock out of Brad's mouth, then ordered Brad to clean off the extra cum with his tongue.  Brad immediately did as he was told, disgusted by his body's actions, but pleased by the chance to taste more of Mike's delicious cum.<br>
<br>
Brad fell back on his butt (which felt a little more "cushiony" than usual) and looked up at Mike.  God, that man was sexy.  How come he never noticed that before?<br>
<br>
"Now," Mike said, smiling.  "You're going to do something for me, fag, no questions."</p>
