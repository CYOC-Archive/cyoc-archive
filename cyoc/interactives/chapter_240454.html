<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The cool morning air blew through Connor’s hair as he and Zack stepped off the porch and onto the sidewalk. The quiet hum of the neighborhood was a sharp contrast to the racing thoughts in Connor’s mind. Zack walked beside him, hands in his pockets, his relaxed posture a reminder of how at ease he always seemed to be.<br />
<br />
“Man, it’s been a while since I walked around this part of town,” Zack said, looking around at the familiar houses and tree-lined streets. “Almost feels like nothing’s changed, y’know?” <br />
<br />
Connor chuckled softly, shoving his hands into his hoodie pockets. “Yeah, I guess this place is stuck in time. Same houses, same streets…same people.”<br />
<br />
“Not all the same,” Zack said, giving Connor a glance. “You were gone for a while, remember?”<br />
<br />
Connor frowned, his steps slowing slightly. “Yeah…college. I thought I’d get out of here for good, you know? Turns out I didn’t have it all figured out like I thought.” <br />
<br />
Zack gave a sympathetic nod. “Yeah, that’s life.” He smirked. “For what it’s worth though, you’re not the only one who’s had a rough couple of years.”<br />
<br />
Connor raised an eyebrow. “Really? You always seemed like you had it all figured out.”<br />
<br />
Zack laughed, a short, dry sound. “Trust me man, I didn’t. When you left for college, I thought I’d just stick around here, maybe get a job and figure it all out as I went. But watching everyone else leave? That hit harder than expected. Made me feel like I was stuck.”<br />
<br />
Connor hesitated before asking, “So what did you do?”<br />
<br />
“Picked up odd jobs,” Zack replied with a shrug. “Worked here and there, got into some trouble every now and then. Nothing major, but it was enough to keep me busy. Then last year…” He trailed off as he held up his left arm, showing his scar. “…things changed.” He paused for a second before shaking his head a bit. “Enough about me. What about you? What was it like out there? College, the big world, all that stuff?”<br />
<br />
Connor scratched the back of his neck. “It was…different,” he started. “At first, it was amazing. New faces, new places, the freedom to do whatever I wanted. But then…I started to slip. While I struggled, I watched as the people around me seemed to move forward with ease. I started to realize that maybe I wasn’t as prepared as I thought I was. When I dropped out a few months ago…it felt like I was admitting defeat.”<br />
<br />
Zack stopped walking, turning to face him. “It’s not defeat C,” he said. “You tried. That’s more than a lot of people do.”<br />
<br />
Connor met his friend’s eyes, a small smile tugging at his lips. “Thanks. I suppose I never really thought of it like that.”<br />
<br />
They continued walking, their pace slowing a bit as the conversation shifted to memories of high school—the stupid pranks they’d pulled, the games they’d gone to, the trouble they got into—and for the first time in a while, Connor felt a sense of normalcy. Every now and then though, he’d catch Zack glancing at him, a small smirk on his lips as if he was waiting for the perfect time to say something. <br />
<br />
“So,” Zack eventually said. “Gotta say, you’re looking great, C. Been bulking up quite a bit, huh?”<br />
<br />
Connor scoffed, rolling his eyes. “You noticed?”<br />
<br />
Zack chuckled. “Oh, I noticed. Kinda hard not to after remembering you as a skinny twig in high school.” He gave the other man a playful nudge. “I mean, damn! If I’d known you’d end up like this, maybe I’d have tried a bit harder to stay in touch.”<br />
<br />
Connor felt a heat creep up the back of his neck, clearing his throat as he tried to play it off. “Shut up, Zack.”<br />
<br />
“What? Can’t a guy appreciate a fine piece of work?” Zack grinned, nudging Connor again. “You’re not just looking good, you’re feeling good too, right? Stronger, sharper, more…alive?”<br />
<br />
Connor hesitated before nodding. “Yeah. It’s weird, though. I feel like I should be exhausted after all that work yesterday, and yet I woke up feeling-“<br />
<br />
“Hungry?” Zack cut in, flashing a knowing grin. “Like, for something more than breakfast?”<br />
<br />
Connor narrowed his eyes. “The hell’s that supposed to mean?”<br />
<br />
Zack just chuckled, but there was something in the way that he looked at Connor—something knowing, something…hungry.<br />
<br />
“I’m just saying,” Zack continued, his voice dropping to something smooth and low. “It’s a big adjustment, becoming a werewolf. Your body’s gonna start wanting things. Cravings, instincts, new…urges.”<br />
<br />
Connor swallowed. He wasn’t sure if it was the way Zack was wording it or if it was just the way his body was reacting to those words, but he suddenly felt a bit warmer. <br />
<br />
Zack, of course, didn’t stop there. “You know, you’re lucky to have me and the others around. Micah and I had to figure a lot of this stuff out on our own. Definitely would’ve been helpful to have someone around to show me the ropes…” His smirk widened. “Or tie me up and show me who’s boss.”<br />
<br />
Connor nearly tripped over his own feet. “Jesus, Zack.”<br />
<br />
Zack burst out laughing, clearly pleased with himself. “Relax man, I’m just messin’ with you. Unless you’re interested, that is.”<br />
<br />
Connor groaned, shaking his head, but Zack wasn’t done yet.<br />
<br />
“For real though,” he said, his tone a bit more genuine. “Micah helped me through a lot of it. That’s why we’re so close. Well, that, and the fact that we’re dating.”<br />
<br />
Connor blinked, caught off guard by this sudden revelation. “Wait…you and Micah are…?”<br />
<br />
Zack nodded. “Yep. Been together for a while now.” He gave Connor a smirk before continuing. “We’re open, though. If you ever wanna, you know, join us sometime…”<br />
<br />
Connor’s face turned beet red as he struggled to find his words. “I-I, uh…”<br />
<br />
Zack laughed, clearly enjoying Connor’s flustered reaction. “Hey, no pressure man, but it&#39;d be a good way to welcome you into the pack. Micah did mention that Logan likes to keep things close.”<br />
<br />
Connor ran a hand down his face, letting out a groan. “You’re impossible.”<br />
<br />
“I prefer <i>irresistable</i>.”<br />
<br />
Connor sighed, but he couldn’t help the small, exasperated smile tugging at his lips. Same old Zack—charismatic, shameless, and always ready to push his buttons. <br />
<br />
For the first time in a long time, Connor didn’t feel like he was out of place, just passing through his own life. He felt like he belonged. <br />
<br />
Even if Zack was going to make his life hell while he figured all this out.</p>
