<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Now that I had proof of the rings power I tried my best not to 1: panic at the AWSOME power I now wielded and 2: start wishing things left an right. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey hun, everything alright?&quot; My wife Sarah asked, placing her nimble hand softly on my shoulder. &quot;You have that &#39;thinking hard look&#39; on your face.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhh, I was day dreaming. Nothing to worry about. Dear.&quot; I replied with a quick smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ready to head home? All this walking today has left me beat tiered. I hope the car is finished by tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, lets her home n off our feet.&quot; She agreed. She took my hand and I panicked as I realized it was the hand with the ring on it. Afraid that she might feel it and ask where it&#39;d come from. Luckily my wife&#39;s greatest fault was her obliviousness.<br />
<br />
She was kind, caring and sometimes a little to upbeat or optimistic, to the point she&#39;d sometimes seem a little unhinged, but she always missed little details. One time I had to change out our white shower curtain with a blue and orange stripe pattern without mentioning it to her. 2 weeks later she&#39;d asked me. &quot;Has our shower curtain always had those orange stripes?&quot;<br />
<br />
I&#39;d laughed so hard when I pointed out the blue ones that she was red faced with embarestment and a little angry that I was makeing fun of her that I&#39;d spent that night on the sofa. The next day we made up, but I always chuckle to myself when I see her miss something out of place. <br />
<br />
Once we got home I offered to make dinner, she didn&#39;t object and decided to take a shower. <br />
<br />
With her out of earshot I took the opertunity to set up some thing for the ring. First I wished it looked exsactly like my wedding band. That would make hiding the ring easier. Not that my wife noticed in the first place.<br />
<br />
Second, I wished for a tasty dinner to be prepared. Without any prompts a pan of vegetable stirfry appeared on the stove, ready to serve. With the ample time I now had I tested the ring a little more. <br />
<br />
Simple wishes to see how thing worked. I&#39;d wished myself to have blue hair, easy enough in the hallway mirror I had blue hair. Then I wished I&#39;d always had blue hair. In one of our vacation photos my hair was the same blue color as it was now. Conveniently I wished my hair was back to normal and the photo was undone. <br />
<br />
I&#39;d turned out salt and pepper shakers into two mice and then back again. With a few vague wisha I&#39;d picked up that the ring somehow drew on my intent on even the least described requests and on more intense description and specifications it matched them perfectly. I had compleate control over its powers. I was in a frenzy and almost blew my cover when I heard Sarah ask &quot;did you say something?&quot;<br />
<br />
I turned to see her with a towel on her head and whereing pajama bottoms and a tank top. I knew this as her &quot;in for the night&quot; wear. <br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s that smell?&quot; She asked, turning to the kitchen and abosndoning her first question. I quickly changed the drapes back into a black satun color from the white linin I&#39;d wished them into being. <br />
<br />
In the kitchen Sarah and I dished out our supper and chatted about our day and the thing s that needed doing tomorrow, mostly yard work. That; I usually dreaded but with the ring it be easy to accomplish. So I had a rather up beat tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;You seem happier today then usual.&quot;<br />
Sarah blatantly stated., I was taken aback by her sudden observation then anything else.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah?&quot; I feinted, &quot;I suppose I&#39;ve just been feeling rather obstomystic about things. &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I&#39;m glad to see it.&quot; She said with a smile, then got up and set her dish in the sink. <br />
<br />
&quot;I however am feeling beat tiered, I&#39;m going to go to bed, hopefully my body won&#39;t mind sleeping on a full stomach.&quot;<br />
<br />
I stayed seated and finished my meal, then did the dishes. I didn&#39;t wish the mess away because I didn&#39;t  want Sarah to question why it was so quick and to give her time to fall asleep.<br />
<br />
I then tip-toe&#39;ed past the bedroom door some time later, listening closely for any soft snoring. Once I was confident that she was asleep I quietly entered the room.<br />
<br />
I gave a quick wish to see better in the dark and soon the black room was cast into a kind of gray-scale that gae away the room outlines perfectly. I then stood befor my wife as she layed in bed on her side, waiting for me to cuddle up behind her whenever I called it a night. <br />
<br />
I took in the shape of her body; thin lith frame, her narrow waist an hips. The small breasts on her chest. She was a beautyful woman, but I&#39;d always woundered what she&#39;s look like with a little more curve. <br />
<br />
And that was the start of it I suppose. I wished almost absentmindedly that her breasts would grow a cup size. And as expected, they did. They gave a soft jiggle and through her tank top I could see just a little more cleavage. Then on a little bit of a high from the first wish, I wished again, but that she&#39;d gain an in on both sides of her hips and thighs!<br />
<br />
Those too jiggled slightly and had the added effect of causing my wife to shift in her sleep as I could see her upper legs widen ever so slightly.<br />
<br />
I hurried to my side of the bed when she gave her &#39;about to wake up&#39; groans an curled up behind her, slipping an arm under her pillow, and bring my other arm<br />
Down along her waist, noticing the the new curves I&#39;d given her and the soft, squeezable flesh beneath my fingers.<br />
<br />
 Lieing down suddenly braught with it the exhaustion of the day. So much happened and I still alot more to do. I planed to play more with this ring and my wife, but i would saver it, like a never ending buffet of posaablities. <br />
<br />
I was looking forward to trying everything.<br />
<br />
The next morning I was woken up by my wife&#39;s grunting. I blinked the sleep from my eyes and saw her struggling with a pair of jeans. Specifically the button. Already I could see her expanded thighs and hips pressing on the taught denim splendidly, molding her extra curvs like a marble statue.<br />
<br />
&quot;Geehh!&quot; She groaned, giving up on the button. She then fetched a belt from the closet and threaded it through her jeans. Using the belt like a corset for her waist, braught the pants togther and fastened the button underneath it. The tight jeans held as my stubborn wife sighed a breath of air from sucking in her abdomin.<br />
<br />
At this moment she noticed me watching her. &quot;You did the laundry last week right? Did you use hot or cold water?&quot; She asked, slightly winded.<br />
<br />
I knew where this was going, and for my own intrest lied. &quot;Yeah, I set it to hot, had alot of dirt in them from the yard work last Friday.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, I knew it, you shrank the load!&quot; She exclaimed. &quot;No wonder my bra is so tight today! And these jeans, it&#39;ll take me all week to streach these out now...&quot; Sarah then pouted her face at me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry hun, I didn&#39;t realize they were in that load.&quot; I continued the story. &quot;But hey, look at those pants now...&quot; I got out of bed and wrapped my arms around her waist, sliding my hands up and down her tight thighs into her even tighter pockets.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah-nah!&quot; She exclaimed grabbing my wrists and pulling my hands out of her pockets. &quot;I just spent 5 minuets putting these pants on, your not getting me to take them off that easy!&quot; She spun around and gave me a playful kiss. &quot;Besides, you have work today and i need to get the car from the shop, when they call. So hop to it mister!&quot; She slapped my butt lightly, pushing me to the bathroom to clean up.<br />
<br />
I did as I was told, it was the least I could do for her since I just ruined most of her cloths.<br />
<br />
After a shower I got in with my day eagerly waiting for my return home to play with my wife some more.</p>
