<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">So, Ty decided to have some more fun growing the guys at his high school since there were plenty of them walking around who were short, fat, skinny, nerdy, and not athletic at all. He realized that now that he had this power, it had become his obligation to improve the student body membership at the school. The school’s sports teams were all struggling, and he wanted to improve the standings and rankings of all the teams in every sport. He needed to do this by bulking up the boys one-by-one, which was the more time-consuming but more fun way of going about it. <br />
<br />
Ty wandered back into the locker room again, just to see who was around. Several members of the swimming team, the football team, and the basketball team were around or were just leaving. He walked around just as he saw a tall but skinny boy walk around while staring at his cell phone screen as he was about to slam into a shorter boy, who was on the swim team. <br />
<br />
“Jack! Can you watch where you’re going, big lug? You almost knocked me over, man!” Steve shouted at the much taller boy after nearly bumping into the lanky kid. “Damn, you’re such a bean pole! Get out of the way!” <br />
<br />
Steve was just changing into his clothes after his shower and Ty learned that Jack had just finished playing basketball. <br />
<br />
Jack just uttered “Sorry” as he sat down and opened his locker to retrieve his bag. The boy was at least 6-foot-8 inches tall, but he was as skinny as a board. He had no muscle and barely any meat on those long arms and legs. He truly looked like a bean pole. Ty felt sorry for him. <br />
<br />
As Jack removed his basketball gear, he quietly turned around and went into the shower stall. Ty got a good look at him and that’s when it hit him that Jack could use some muscle!<br />
<br />
“Jack needs to muscle up! What if he gains some, like right now, so he looks like a hulking junior bodybuilder? Then, he won’t ever be teased about being a bean pole again!” Ty grinned quietly to himself. <br />
<br />
Jack removed all his clothes before he stepped into the shower stall and closed the plastic curtain. Then, he switched on the water and grabbed the bottle of body wash. He was in the process of rubbing the liquid soap all over his long legs when he noticed something. <br />
<br />
His thin legs started to show some muscle for the very first time! His calves, which were always flat, suddenly began to bulge from the back of his long legs. Thick, hard mounds of muscle began to push outwards, becoming hard and completely covered with veins. They enlarged to bigger than normal, like large oranges. <br />
<br />
Next, his long, thin quads inflated like balloons on both legs. Not only did they quickly grow wider, thicker, deeper, and harder, but they also started to show profound muscle striations all over. Two big, thick, and rock-hard teardrops of muscle began to bulge from the front of his quads, like huge, vertical muscle cords. Suddenly, Jack looked like one of those guys who never skipped a leg day in the gym. His legs had become like those of professional runners or cyclists, which were bulging with raw muscle all over. This made Jack look like a soccer player or a rugby player. He could have easily qualified as a member of any of those teams. <br />
<br />
His long torso now was completely covered by muscle everywhere. What used to be his long, flat stomach, was now a canyon that was covered with bricks, like a brick wall separated by deep grooves between each brick. His lower torso was a well-defined field of abdominal muscles resembling a washboard. It appeared as if Jack had spent months doing sit-ups and crunches to develop and grow his core. Not only did he now have a six-pack, but the muscles were as hard as steel. <br />
<br />
Jack’s shoulders widened considerably as his flat pectorals ballooned from his upper chest into large, wide, and deep orbs of solid muscle. Big pecs that were like two half-size basketballs, placed side by side, were not positioned on his chest and jutting out from his wide frame. These gave insane strength to his arms and shoulders so the boy could carry and lift incredible amounts of weight, as many would see in the gym from this point forward. <br />
<br />
Jack’s backside widened and grew into massive slabs of rock-hard muscle, which now offered support to the growing boy’s large, muscular frame. Jack was tall, but he was lanky no more. His body had to pack as much muscle as possible, since that was what Ty had wanted. And that was what the boy’s body was trying to do. Finally, his long, skinny arms would inflate like crazy as big forearms inflated into muscular bowling pins, covered in veins everywhere. His upper arms grew those large triceps and biceps, so that the tall boy now had something to show off every time someone asked him to flex. He now had big, large, round, and solid 22-inch biceps, each with a vein running across it! His triceps stuck out from the outer ends of his arms like mighty bricks, making each arm seem big, thick, hard, and powerful. <br />
<br />
“Holy shit!” Jack whispered to himself when he stepped out of the shower stall, completely soaked and naked, as he quickly wandered over to the large mirror as Ty looked on. The big, tall, hulking boy grabbed his towel and dried off, before he just stood there, admiring his newly, improved physique. “I’m huge!”<br />
<br />
Jack just stood there for a whole minute before he got dressed. Ty made sure that his new clothes would fit his bigger, enlarged body. As soon as Jack had put on his tank top, his shorts and his shoes, Ty finally turned towards him. <br />
<br />
“Looking great there, big man!” Ty smiled as he walked up to him. <br />
<br />
Jack was more than a foot taller than Ty. Jack looked straight down and smiled as Ty stood directly in front of him. <br />
<br />
“All that muscle looks great on you! You’re no longer a bean pole, huh?” Ty laughed. <br />
<br />
“Uhh… N-n-no… I guess not!” Jack replied shyly, as he raised up his right arm and flexed that massive bicep. Ty reached out and rubbed his hand over that massive bicep muscle before him. <br />
<br />
“You know, I can make you even bigger, if you want?” Ty said as he craned his neck and looked straight up at the towering teen. <br />
<br />
“Oh, what? Did you do this? Are you responsible for this?” Jack asked him. <br />
<br />
“Yeah, I got you all jacked-up, Jack!” Ty laughed. “Do you like it?” <br />
<br />
Jack just reached down and placed his large hands under Ty’s armpits. Then, he gently, easily, and slowly lifted Ty off the ground until Ty’s face reached Jack’s level. Jack then pulled him closer, and he kissed Ty on his lips. Ty already knew right there that Jack was extremely pleased. </p>
