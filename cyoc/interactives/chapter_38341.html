<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I should go first,&quot; The pink skunk says. &quot;I'm a skunk, creating scent should come natural <br />
for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which likely means you're better at following them, also, I know Steve, you don't, so I'm <br />
better experienced to deal with him if he shows, it's been days T-Rex said, it would be <br />
weird if he came back with reinforcements -now.-&quot; 'Nine days, whao, I knew I had no clue <br />
how much had past but nine days... still, it wouldn't make sense that Steve would wait <br />
precisely the same amount of time I was in my birthing egg to stage an assault.'  &quot;Besides, <br />
think of it as my way of looking out for my elders.&quot;<br />
<br />
The pink skunk stamped her feet. &quot;I'm only older than you by what, a few minutes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, if I'm the first group through them I'm more likely to run into any people who are <br />
laying in wait or just happen to stumble on our rout, and if it is Steve or someone like him, <br />
maybe I can use that to my advantage.&quot; Truth of the matter was, you really didn't like the <br />
idea, or have the desire to kill anyone. However T-Rex's instructions had been black and <br />
white, capture for turning or kill any humans you came across. Which meant of course that <br />
you would have to have your group capture any human they ran into via non-leathal force. <br />
'How big is each of our groups going to be? When bee hive separate to start a new colony, <br />
they take around half the entire swarm with him. Will we be taking a quarter of the nest <br />
with us each? How many is that? Is that number too large? We are supposed to move <br />
quickly from the nest to the site of the new one.' You ask Pink Skunk on the subject and <br />
you both agree that T-Rex likely left all the finer details up to you.  <br />
<br />
You wish it hadn't been so dark in T-Rex's sitting spot. Was he humanoid? Was he brightly <br />
colored like all of you? Was he human size or the size of a true T-Rex? There were so <br />
many shadows covering him that you couldn't be sure one way or the other.  <br />
<br />
One odd thought does strike you, 'Snails?' You look around at the procreation chamber, <br />
and think back to the orientation chamber, all the Magni you've seen so far have been <br />
mammals with the exception of T-Rex, or at least vertebrates. There have been no signs <br />
of mollusks or the like. Not to mention, in spite of their vast variety, that there appears to <br />
be no specialization among the Magni, like humans.  You almost wonder how the Magni <br />
came across the animal traits they have. But a more interesting occurs to you, 'Where the <br />
magni sixty five million years ago sentient? T-Rex decidedly is, but he's had sixty five <br />
million years to become that way. And most people agree that Dinosaurs plus the <br />
mammals back then didn't have the brain structure and most didn't have the brain size to <br />
be tool users... then again, we really don't seem to be tool users ourselves. But we've been <br />
focused on just increasing our numbers so far, so maybe we just haven't had a chance do <br />
more. Though if sentient IS a new state for the Magni, it would explain a lot of things.' <br />
<br />
The mollusks likely aren't Magni themselves by this virtue, you figure they're more likely <br />
domesticated animals. You giggle when you think about how big or how tiny these snails <br />
could be, then again, you'll need to take them along either way, and T-Rex said it would <br />
take five hours to reach the new nest site, so would they keep up with you or would some <br />
of your group have to carry them? <br />
<br />
&quot;You don't want to kill anyone either Pink Cat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The look in your eyes, you don't want to kill anyone either.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... Yes, but the Old One gave us an order, we have to obey, but he did give us option of <br />
capturing any humans we came across for turning so we can go with that instead, and <br />
we'll need humans for the Magno anyway so it's logical.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... logical. Oh spirits I hope we don't have to.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Me too, me too.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Pink Skunk then looks into your eyes and says, &quot;Okay, you go first with your group, good <br />
luck.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Same to you, Pink Skunk.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think we have the same father?&quot; Pink Skunk said out of the blue. <br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; You ask surprised.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we're both pink, so it might be possible.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I doubt there's only one pink male Magni.&quot; You think of a pink male and start giggling. <br />
Could pink be a sex oriented color? Then again, the magni had existed long before human <br />
culture had assigned colors particular meanings. <br />
<br />
&quot;I know, I was just, ya know, curious.&quot; Pink Skunk says with the attitude of explain a whim, <br />
and you realize it for what it is, a whim. <br />
<br />
&quot;So I'll go ahead with the first group then.&quot; you says. <br />
<br />
&quot;All right.&quot; Pink Skunk nods, &quot;I just hope that our new nest is be as nice as this one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure it will be, the Old One gave us the job to make sure of that remember?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right!&quot; Pink Skunk nods eagerly. &quot;So we have no idea how big our groups are supposed to <br />
be?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just use your common sense and I think we'll be fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Gotcha.&quot; <br />
<br />
When both of you step into the Mating Chamber you find the same mass of naked brightly <br />
colored bodies you did before mingling. Pink Skunk put two fingers to her muzzle, and <br />
somehow manages a whistle from her rubber mouth. The manages to get most of the <br />
Magni's attention. <br />
<br />
&quot;By order of the voice, our Old One T-Rex, we are to relocate a percentage of our numbers <br />
to a new nesting site. Myself and Pink Cat will be leading two groups that shall leave a <br />
couple minutes apart from each other to the new location, all Magni females who are <br />
pregnant but are not on their ninth day please come foreword, as for obvious reason you'll <br />
be needed the most at the new nest.&quot;<br />
<br />
There is of course another reason, if this nest is attacked, then the pregnant Magni <br />
females will be least able to defend themselves. <br />
<br />
&quot;All up to eighth day pregnant magni line up. Males, line up behind the last pregnant <br />
magni you mated with, if there is a male already behind her form behind that one. We will <br />
be doing our best to be sure that the ratio of male to female magni in both nests remains <br />
at a level to insure the procreation of more birthing eggs. Some of you males will be <br />
coming with us, some of you won't.&quot;<br />
<br />
Under the authority the Old One has temporarily given you, the Magni of the mating <br />
chamber begin to line up. The sheer number of them again leaves you impressed. many <br />
city blocks worth indeed. You wonder how the media hasn't noticed yet. You throw away <br />
the childish idea everyone forgot about you the moment you became a Magni, just too <br />
silly. The Old One said they had only awakened recently, and you were in your egg for nine <br />
days. You wonder just how long T-Rex and Compy have been awake. Not long enough to <br />
be picked by even the tabloids to be sure, but the sheer number of people here suggests <br />
they've come or acquired a vast number of humans...it was dark outside when you came <br />
here. Was there excavation equipment outside? A archeology crew could have made up the <br />
first batch of Magni. You wonder if T-Rex and Compy are the only Old Ones or if there are <br />
others. If this is the only Magni nest or if there are others. Then again, it's pretty hard to <br />
survive sixty five million years worth of Earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, floods, and the <br />
like, immune to old age or not.</p>
