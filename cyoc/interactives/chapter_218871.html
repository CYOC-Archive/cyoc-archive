<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Following behind the shapely woman Connor and the others were still befuddled at her appearance. Not only was Goldilocks real, she apparently also married to one of the three bears. Entering into a clearing the teens gasped as they beheld the luxurious cabin before them. &quot;Is that your house?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Goldilocks turned, a smile plastered on her beautiful face. She and her husband put alot of time and effort into building and renovating their home. Standing at two stories tall, the log cabin sported a wrap around porch, complete with picture windows, and a cobblestone chimney. &quot;Nice am I right,&quot; Goldilocks replied with pride. &quot;Bear and I have spent alot of time improving it over the decades. We even added a wifi connection recently.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry did you say decades,&quot; Miles exclaimed. Goldilocks simply smirked. &quot;I&#39;m alot older than I look and home renovation isn&#39;t cheap.&quot; The teens simply gawked at one another, after everything they had seen over the past year, why shouldn&#39;t immortal storybook characters be a thing as well. As they approached the cabin the teens were shocked as a large creature now exited.<br />
<br />
Standing on the porch was what could only be described as a large anthropomorphic bear.  The bear stood on massive legs, his heavily muscled torso covered in dark brown fur with a flannel vest. Raising his massive arms the bear waved with hands that were a mix between bear and human. A smile beaming from his large bear head. &quot;Goldie you found them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Goldilocks bounded towards her husband, wrapping her arms around her 7 foot husband. Craning her neck up, the woman smiled as she planted a gentle kiss on his lips.  &quot;They were right where Calista said they would be,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait you know Calista,&quot; Spark asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We keep in touch with the local tribes,&quot; Bear stated. &quot;As forest guardians we help to keep the fae and the local shaman abridged of any problems that might pop up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We can explain all that later Bear,&quot; Goldilocks smiled. &quot;Now let&#39;s get inside. It&#39;s starting to get late and I&#39;m sure everyone is getting hungry.&quot; Bear nodded, opening the fron door wide as the group of teens entered they gasped in amazement at the interior of the home.<br />
<br />
Goldie and Bear had furnished their home extravagantly, most impressively it appeared everything had been hand carved. Oak couches and chairs with hand sewn velvet cushions, a hand carved and exquisitely designed maple table, even a oak staircase that appeared hand built. The only things that appeared purchased was the large plasma screen T.V. set into a hanf carved oak entertainment center. <br />
<br />
&quot;Bear is quite the handyman,&quot; Goldilocks stated with pride. &quot;He built everything here from scratch.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;With Goldies help, &quot; Bear added, squeezing his wife tightly around her waist. Goldilocks giggled, standing on tip toe to give him a peck on the cheek. The teens were astounded, amazed by Bears craftsmanship. &quot;Why don&#39;t you all get comfortable,&quot; Bear stated. &quot;Dinner should be ready soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
Settling in, the teens realized trying to return home as the sun was setting would be a bad idea. Making a call home, the teens explained they were safe and would check in tomorrow morning. As far as who they were staying with, that took a bit more of an explanation.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what did your folks say Connor,&quot; Miles asked. &quot;Well,&quot; Connor sighed. &quot;Amazingly they were okay with it. Even when I mentioned I was staying in the cabin of Goldilocks and the Bear.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably not the weirdest story your dad has ever heard,&quot; Spark replied. &quot;I mean he and I have seen some really crazy stuff over the years so why wouldn&#39;t two fairytale figures be out if the ordinary?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah I don&#39;t think my folks would believe that,&quot; Miranda said quietly. &quot;I mean even Ms. McKinnon was taken aback when Amara told her where we were.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what did you two tell your parents,&quot; Connor asked. Miles and Miranda glanced at one another before turning to Connor. &quot;We&#39;re crashing at your house.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So Goldilocks, Bear, can I ask what you&#39;re doing here,&quot; Spark asked. Goldilocks and Bear now turned to kne another, a loving smile on their faces as they now shared their story.<br />
<br />
Everyone was familiar with the story of Goldilocks, the young girl who got lost in the woods before breaking into a cabin in the woods and falling asleep. What the story didn&#39;t tell was what happened afterwards. Goldilocks meeting with Baby Bear would lead to a friendship that would blossom into love and then marriage.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bear and I grew up together,&quot; Goldilocks stated. &quot;After our...awkward introduction, we became inseparable. I still apologize to this day about breaking into your parents house.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Goldie you were 8 years old,&quot; Bear laughed. &quot;Yesh you scared my parents at first but when they saw you were just a little girl they realized you meant no harm.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you two have been together ever since,&quot; Connor asked. Bear and Goldilocks nodded, exchanging a loving look between themselves. &quot;I got a question,&quot; Miles said timidly. &quot;How do you know Chenoa and her parents?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Goldilocks stated. &quot;Years ago we became guardians of the forest. A little shamen magic and poof we found ourselves immortal. As guardians though, we tend to talk with some of the more important members of the magical community, such as Chenoa&#39;s parents.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re diplomats,&quot; Bear added. &quot;Very important ones at that. For years they&#39;ve negotiated peace treaties between the local Native tribes and the magical beings within the forest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Chenoa&#39;s father also happens to be an old friend of mine,&quot; Bear stated. &quot;In fact Goldie and I set the two up on a blind date years ago. They clicked and when they got married, they named us as godparents to Chenoa.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that&#39;s why we&#39;re so worried now,&quot; Goldilocks sighed. <br />
<br />
&quot;So what happened,&quot; Connor asked. Goldilocks and Bear turned to one another, a worried look on their faces as they now spoke. <br />
<br />
Chenoa and her family had just completed a recent diplomatic talk between the tribe and a clan of Dogmen that had recently settled in the area. They left a few days ago and should have returned hone but, something happened. What it was no one knew, however, after learning that Ezekiel Kane was rumored to be in the area everyone became worried.<br />
<br />
&quot;Calista called us and we began searching the area,&quot; Goldilocks stated. &quot;Considering how close we are I started searching the woods to try and find Chenoa.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mrs. Locke do you know where my parents are,&quot; Chenoa asked. Goldilocks looked at her goddaughter, sadly shaking her head no. &quot;We were hoping you knew Chenoa.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Deer Girl sadly shook her head, all she knew was her parents told her to stay hidden before running off. Something had spooked the couple,  who had tried to protect their only daughter. &quot;Do you think they&#39;re okay,&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your folks are some of the most resourceful people I know,&quot; Bear smiled. &quot;I&#39;m sure they&#39;re just fine. We just have to find them.&quot;<br />
<br />
The sound of Miranda&#39;s cellphone ringing, now drew everyone&#39;s attention. Curiously, the teen now answered, a smile forming on her face. &quot;Nat, Rei how are you,&quot; she said. &quot;Are you guys done babysitting? We could use your help.&quot; The others now watched as Miranda&#39;s smile faltered, her eyes going wide as she anxiously gazed at the others. &quot;What is it sis? What&#39;s wrong?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Guys,&quot; Miranda said nervously. &quot;Nat and Rei said they met someone today. We might have more problems than just Chenoa&#39;s missing parents.&quot;</p>
