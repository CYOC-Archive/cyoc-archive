<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">About the same time that Sean finished selecting the options for his transformations, the noises and voices of his parents became louder and louder.  It sounded like they were getting closer.  Sean and Jeff both freeze in sudden worry and look nervously at the door.  They can now distinguish the words coming from the two voices.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, hey, hey!  Where do you think you're going?  I'm not done talking to you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, well I am.  I'm going to go and do something better with my time -- like see how our son's doing.  It's pretty noisy up in there with him by himself!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're trying to avoid me!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you gotton so into yourself that you're forgetting about what's most important in our lives?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sean and Jeff shudder, and their eyes widen; they hear a hand placed on the door handle to Sean's room, and the voice of Sean's mother seems to be immeditately right outside the door.<br />
<br />
Jeff sat in front of Sean's large mirror, facing towards the direction of the door.  Oh, what would he do if he were caught?  He had an idea:  maybe he could change his form to something small or insignificant, to where he wasn't noticeable!  Or, better yet, his normal form!  The idea quickly faded from his mind, though; he didn't have the time to make a move right now.  All he could do was sit here and wait for something to happen.<br />
<br />
Sean took several steps forward.  I'll go right to the door and see my mom directly about what she wants.  Hopefully, I'll get right in her view, so she won't see Jeff.  These thoughts ran through his mind as he walked in front of the door.  He turned around to face Jeff, to give him some kind of signal or whisper about what was happening.  His eyes widened, and he stifled a gasp; it wasn't Jeff that was the cause -- it was the reflection in the mirror behind him.<br />
<br />
Sean saw himself, starting to transform.  He looked around his body and switched glances between it and the mirror.  He put his left arm in front of him.  His normal blonde hair turned dark grey, and was growing slowly.  The minor amount of fat on his face disappeared, as his face began to appear more masculine.<br />
<br />
Ignoring what was happening in front of him, Sean turned around.  While looking at the mirror, he lifted up his shirt.  His stomach was become more defined; it was deepening slowly, and his abs were starting to define themselves more clearly in deeper lines.  His nipples tightened up and hardened as he closed his eyes and shook, feeling a wave of electricity move through him.<br />
<br />
While Sean was caught in his transformation, Jeff's ear raised as he heard sound further beyond the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honey, some of our neighbors are at the door.  They want to ask about a robber.. a trespasser.. or something...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sean felt his arms push out in front of him.  He curved his hands up from his arms, and fell slowly to the ground.  His mouh was getting wetter, and his tongue was thinning and starting to elongate.  He opened his mouth and managed to say in a raspy voice, &quot;I'm okay, mom!  Busy!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff could hear the sound of someone sighing beyond the door.  Footsteps could be heard as Sean's parents started to walk away.  Jeff rolled his eyes and made a sigh of relief.  His right ear raised suddenly, though, to the window.  He looked in its direction, though unmoving, and listened.  He could hear the sound of several people talking.  He could hear clearly with his wolven ears... they were talking about the &quot;burglar,&quot; and asked if his parents knew anything about it!<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugggh... &quot; and panting could be heard from Sean, as he was on the ground, eyes still closed, as his face pushed out adruptly into a muzzle.  His nose darkened and became smaller, a wolf's nose.  His muzzle pulled out and became more sharply defined, as his ears stretched out in as adrupt thrusts.<br />
<br />
Sean was an interesitng combination of human and wolf.  His arms were the only things that were hairy at this point.  The rest of the bod was naked, with still smooth skin, though it was becoming more sharply defined with muscle.  Jeff cocked his eyes up at the top of Sean to see his back.  Something was moving around inside of it.. like a snake, or something.. his muscles were growing, and pushing up!  Looking a little below, Jeff could see that Sean's chest was broadening.<br />
<br />
Sean was now making realistic whimpers.  He continued panting and groaning ocasionally, soundling like a cross between himself and something else.  His fingers on his hands started to shorten and thin out, as his fingernails became black and lengthened, becoming curved and pointing down.<br />
<br />
At the same time, Sean's thighs and his arms became thicker and more muscular, while becoming shorter.  Jeff moved over as quiely as he could to Sean's position to watch the transformation.  It was so interesting seeing a friend transform in the same way he did.<br />
<br />
Sean closed his eyes tightly.  When he opened them again, the light reflected off amber eyes.  His feet lengthened and his skin bunched up as they became thinner, but very long.  His toes curved, becoming black and turning from bare skin to a wolf's toenails as they curved.<br />
<br />
Jeff looked down at a hairless wolf morph that was Sean.  The difference between his transformation and his friend's was that he obviously became more of a wolf than he.  Sean looked up at Jeff, forming what could possibly be a possible, and said, in the same raspy voice as before, &quot;It feels good..&quot;  He stood up.  He immediately closed his eyes again, and slumped back against the door.  His long, slippery tongue as out to one side of his mouth, and his facial expression was becoming more and more intense.<br />
<br />
Jeff looked down near Sean's stomach.  A trail was growing near his belly button.  From there, it spread out all over his stomach, his abs.. to his arms, and down to his legs and feet.. His hair lengthened and spread, becoming distributed around his body.. his muscular body was covered in his own hair.  Like Jeff, he, too, had a pelt of his own fur.<br />
<br />
But that's not why Sean's eyes were closed in hot concentration.  Jeff gazed down even further to see Sean's cock.  He'd never seen it before:  it was 7 inches, and throbbing as it grew out, a few centimeters.  It became covered by the fur, and suddenly snapped back to Sean's ripped stomach.  A fold of skin grew up from the base of his cock and covered it all in a sheath.<br />
<br />
Precum was starting to ooze from Sean's cock as he continued panting.. he was starting to drool now... he put a hand to his cock and started rubbing the skin up and down over his head.  Suddenly, his eyes shot open.  He shook as his eyes slanted and he started groaning as he rythmatically pumped his cock.  The underside of his cock bulged as he shot rope after rope of cum across the room, right on the mirror.  Jeff had to move out of the way.  He grinned, looking over in Sean's direction, knowing that he wasn't the only one who marked terrritory today.<br />
<br />
A satisfied Sean finally slowed on his panting.  He opened his eyes partially more and eyed Jeff, who was grinning at him and doing a wolf's &quot;thumb's up.&quot;  Little drips of wolf semen was still coming out of his cock slowly.<br />
<br />
The fur thickened to a practical point in Sean.  He marveled in the sensual and warm sensation that he felt during and after the transformation.<br />
<br />
Good to change.<br />
<br />
But, while Sean was indulging in his thoughts, Jeff decided to lean over towards the window and pay attention to what was being said outside.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, like we said, we saw those prints here.. and they oddly enough seem to point towards this part of your house..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't think Sean got a new pet or something, do you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.  Maybe he knows something.  I doubt it, though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, he is up there in his room a portion of the time..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, if it will help, we need to ask him!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, let's go ask him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sean!  Sean!&quot;<br />
<br />
Sean opened his eyes completely, and, still panting, looked at Jeff, who eyed him.  Sean shook his head; no, now was not the time to act.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, shoot.  Let's go up there and see what's going on.&quot;</p>
