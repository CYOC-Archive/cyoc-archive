<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ben and James led Luke up to the attac where James&#39;s parents had arrangend a sleepover room. The room had 5 full made cots laying around the room. There was a large window at the end of the long room that would give the boys a full veiw of the full moon. Luke put his suitcase down on one of the cots and then followed Ben and James back downstaird to wait for the other two boys to show up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Does your stomach feel a little queasy Luke?&quot; Asked Ben. <br />
&quot;Yeah, a bit.&quot;replied Luke wonering how he knew that. <br />
&quot;Well thats normal for a first transformation, at least you haven&#39;t thrown up yet, I still can remember my first change and I must of vomited at least twice a few hours before the change.&quot;Said Ben.<br />
&quot;Guess the kids got a stonger stomach that you.&quot; Joked James.<br />
Luke was actually very nervous about his first change. He looked out of an open window and the sky was turning oranger. He remembered what the doctor said and that the first change was the most painful. He also didn&#39;t care much for the idea if being in his Moms body. Not that his Mom wasnt attractive she was quiet good looking for 38. She was a high school nurse, a roll he would take for a few days just to see what living as his mom would be like. But she was still his mom and the idea of seeing her naked body was something that made him uncomfortable.<br />
<br />
Alex and Max arrived about 20 minutes later. Alex was 14 and was going through his 6th year of being a WereMom. Max was 12 and was going through his 4th year.<br />
&quot;Alright with everyone here, lets all head up stairs, It looks like the sun will be going down soon we should all be getting ready.&quot; Said James.<br />
<br />
Up in the attac the Boys had all changes into nothing but long t shirts and underwear. As sun down drew near James, Ben, Alex, Max and Luke were all playing board games and watching a movie on the small tv in the corner (Fitting enough, it was a WereWolf movie)<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright so we&#39;ve got tommorow planed out right?&quot; Asked Alex. <br />
&quot;Well first, we are going for a morning jog to stratch out our bigger bodies, I remeber last year how cramped I felt after every change so this year I&#39;ve made it a point to exercise after ever change.&quot; Said James.<br />
&quot;Right, after that we are going on a shopping spree.&quot; Said Alex. Max rolled his eyes and turned to shake his head at Luke who just sat there in confusion. <br />
&quot;Oh come on Maxwell, you know better than anyone that once you turn into your Mom your mind will become more like her&#39;s.&quot; <br />
&quot;Lets not forget Max that your mom is quiet a shopaholic, Our last sleepover you spent the most out of any of us.&quot; Said Ben.<br />
They then turned to the newist member of there little group. &quot; So Luke, how are you doing?&quot; Asked James. &quot; Its alright, remeber we have been going through this for a long time. And we know what your going through right now&quot;. Said Max.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m just a little scared is all, I heard that the change hurts and that I lose my mind and it changes into my moms&quot; <br />
&quot;Yes it is a little Painful, but not unbearable, in fact it sort of feels kinda good after a while.&quot; Said Ben. <br />
&quot;Just remember, don&#39;t try to resist the change, just let it happen, it could kill you if you do.&quot; James contunued, &quot; There was this kid I went to school with when I was little who was a Were Mom, on his first transformation he tried to resist it and....His parents found him dead in his room next morning, his limbs were stretched out and his face deformed.&quot; <br />
&quot;JAMES!&quot; yelled Ben. &quot;Don&#39;t frighten him any more than he already is!&quot; He continued.<br />
&quot;No its okay.&quot; Said Luke.<br />
Alex tried to change the subject. &quot;Well Luke I think you pretty lucky, Your Mom is kinda hot after all, I&#39;ve seen her a few times at school.&quot;<br />
Ben, James and Max all gave him a glare.<br />
&quot;Well uh...yeah..I guess so, but I still am a little uncomfortable in seeing my moms body um, naked.&quot;Said Luke blushing a bit.<br />
&quot;Its not that bad&quot; said Max. &quot; Once you finish changeing your mind becomes more like hers, her body will feel like yours.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Theres something else you should know and It um a little awkward, but I think you should know before you change.&quot; Said James. <br />
&quot;Once you finish changing, you will become very sexually  aroused. This goes away after the first couple of changes but you will be pretty turned on this first one.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh...so, I&#39;m going to want to have...sex?&quot; Asked Luke, his face redder than ever.<br />
&quot;Well yeah, but one of us will help you out with that once we are done changing tonight&quot; said Alex. <br />
<br />
After a while of asking questions, Ben decided it was time to tell them something.<br />
&quot;So as you guys know, this is my last year of being a WereMom. Once I hit 19, the curse will stop and will never turn into my Mom again. The thing is though, I truly feel like she is who I am ment to be. When I turn into her I feel like Im in the right body, I&#39;ve felt this way for a few years now, so that is why tomorrow, I am going to make the change permanent.&quot;<br />
The other boys looked at him in shock. <br />
&quot;But the only way to do that is for a man to Cum inside of you.&quot;Said James. <br />
&quot;I know, Ive made an arrangement with one of the secret organizations to provide a Male escort to meet me in a hotel tommorow. I hope you guys can respect my choice.<br />
&quot;Do your parents know your doing this?&quot; Asked Luke. <br />
&quot;No, but they will find out once I dont change back and my Mom has a new twin sister.&quot; Replied Ben.<br />
&quot;Well, we all support you Ben.&quot; Said James and the other boys nodded to.<br />
Ben smiled &quot;Thanks guys that means a lot to me!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben turned outiside to see that the sky was getting darker and darker by the second and that Luke was breathing harder and harder by the minute.</p>
