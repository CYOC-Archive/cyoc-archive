<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jessica was a bit surprised as she was lead toward the Meat Market to meet the newest Rabbit Animalian that had converted and seemed to call herself &quot;Hunni Bunni.&quot; It seemed like too much of a pun on being a Rabbit Animalian than anything else. Of course, Jessica had to admit that her own name had been part of why she chose to become a Rabbit Animalian as well, though she also knew that neither she nor her bond-mate had the surname &quot;Rabbit.&quot; Thus that could be more coincidence in the paring of herself with Roger. Yet this new Rabbit Animalian chose the name &quot;Hunni Bunni.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you say on why she choose Hunni Bunni as a name?&quot; Jessica asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;From what I was told... she felt it was &quot;cute,&quot; but I can&#39;t say beyond that,&quot; the Horizon representative answered, &quot;why she didn&#39;t pick something that might sound more... &quot;local&quot; to where she came from... I cannot say. Perhaps she&#39;s enjoyed America and ran into something that had a reference to that and she liked it. After all... she has had immigration papers that go back into the years shortly after what happened at Chernobyl and the fall of the Soviet Union. Thus despite things... she&#39;s probably had a LOT of exposure that could create that impression.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jessica slowly nodded at that and walked along quietly for the moment. Though as the sign for the Meat Market came into view, that raised some of the other questions there. It wasn&#39;t necessarily a bad place, but even with her being eighteen now and fully taken Roger as her mate, that didn&#39;t necessarily mean that she wanted to work there or spend a lot of time there. She was more comfortable with her body, partially as by growing into her adult form, she was proportionately as well built as most Animalian females, at least when compared to Abby and Sarah who ended up double dosed relatively early on. She also thought that her chest was also a bit bigger than Sophie and Pauline&#39;s, but then the Pterodactylus and Microraptor Dinotopians might need to be a bit smaller in that area in order to fly, which was something that actually fit in with all flying Animalians. Regardless, that didn&#39;t mean that Jessica wanted to work in adult entertainment, and yet she&#39;d seemed to have odd run ins with Animalians at or near the Meet Market. The first of this being the first meeting with Shyra.<br />
<br />
&quot;And meeting at the Meat Market... of all places?&quot; Jessica asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think much like your friend Shyra... her libido took a rather large leap up when the conversion happened,&quot; the Horizon representative answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;But ALL Animalians have a high libido,&quot; Jessica answered, privately thinking over the times when she and Roger had been able to get together after her eighteenth birthday , and knowing full well that Abby, Sarah, and Malice had all been active since they found their mates. And while Sophie might not have been as active as the rest of their group that had been double dosed, Jessica did get the sense that Sophie and Roland did look to find some way to get in bed with one another after their first time when they could.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... but as you know that there have been some cases where that issue has gone BEYOND even the normal libido range for Animalians,&quot; the Horizon scientist answered, &quot;and since you, your family, and Doctor Jones were able to help Shyra deal with her own issues... the hope was that you could do it again with Hunni Bunni... though she&#39;d likely need more than coaching.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay... just be glad that this first meeting isn&#39;t including my dad,&quot; Jessica sighed, &quot;I mean... he&#39;d care and may wish to help... but &quot;adopting&quot; someone straight out of a strip club is NOT something high on his agenda.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Again... we don&#39;t know WHY she wanted to meet here precisely,&quot; the Horizon representative spoke, &quot;our only guess is that her libido is higher than the average Animalian&#39;s and that might draw her here... given how heavily it has been publicized.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jessica slowly nodded as they made their way in. Going through the mandatory ID check, to make sure no one under aged was sneaking in, she and the Horizon officer came into the main area where they found a large white furred Rabbit Animalian seated at one of the tables, wearing a specialized Animalian mask that the Meat Market provided and was looking around the room. Unlike Jessica, who had red hair, this other Rabbit Animalian had blonde hair and from what Jessica could tell, she would also be on the larger side for a Rabbit Animalian. She couldn&#39;t be certain, but she guessed that &quot;Hunni Bunni&quot; would likely be well taller than her. That was soon proved when the Rabbit Animalian quite literally hopped up and hugged Jessica.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello!&quot; Hunni Bunni said happily hugging Jessica into her, &quot;they say you help me! I am Hunni Bunni!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Jessica Mariana,&quot; Jessica managed after being released from the hug, &quot;and yes... I was told that Horizon wanted my family to help you... adjust to things...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you are Momma Rabbit, yes?&quot; Hunni Bunni asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No...&quot; Jessica managed with a blush under her fur, &quot;I only just graduated from High School this past May... and I&#39;ll be going to UNLV in the fall, assuming they don&#39;t cancel things... so while I have a bond-mate... we aren&#39;t married yet, and we certainly don&#39;t have any babies. In a sense your new mother would also be my mother... and her husband would be your new father.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do they work here?&quot; Hunni Bunni asked looking around and seemingly unconcerned.<br />
<br />
&quot;My parents are both Human,&quot; Jessica answered, &quot;and before we get into that... perhaps you could fill me in on a few things...&quot;<br />
<br />
Hunni Bunni paused and nodded and they returned to the table. It wasn&#39;t big by any means, but they were wearing masks for the moment, and Jessica hoped that any introduction of Hunni Bunni to her parents would be on grounds that weren&#39;t quite so... exotic. Hunni Bunni actually looked curious as she sat down.<br />
<br />
&quot;What you wish to know?&quot; Hunni Bunni asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps you could tell me a bit about your conversion, to start with,&quot; Jessica offered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...&quot; Hunni Bunni nodded and then began to retell what she knew and remembered...<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Head... hurts...&quot; the woman that would become Hunni Bunni gave a pained moan as she was rolled through Horizon in a wheelchair.<br />
<br />
She&#39;d lived in America for years, shortly after the Soviet Union fell, her mother and herself had immigrated to the US, mostly in the hopes of getting better treatment for the cancers that had seemed to trouble both of them since the meltdown of the reactor at Chernobyl. She remembered being only a baby when it happened, or perhaps she was born shortly after that power plant melted down... those details were a bit hazy. She did know that her mother couldn&#39;t ultimately be saved and did succumb to the cancers. The Americans did all they could, but with her mother it wasn&#39;t enough. With Hunni Bunni it helped, but not enough to save her from dealing with a lot of pain and discomfort. It ultimately left her managing various small jobs to pay for treatment, which over time became more and more reliant on working from home or online. This ultimately didn&#39;t help her much and she was now also looking at something where the cancers she had were starting progress again, despite treatment. In this, Horizon and the Animalia Virus seemed to be her last hope.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everything will be fine,&quot; Judy said to the woman that would become Hunni Bunni, &quot;Horizon has your request and the appropriate paperwork with it your request that your conversion be into a Rabbit Animalian... and not with needles. That can be handled. We have one conversion room ready and to glasses of my milk should be there. All you&#39;ll need to do is drink.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your milk?&quot; the woman asked back as she looked up over her shoulder, and squinting when having to look into the ceiling mounted lights.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Judy explained, &quot;I took a shot that counters the vaccine for the Animalia Virus, provided the milk needed for your twin doses and then took the vaccination. You should be good to go.&quot;<br />
<br />
They then came up the marked door for the conversion room. Judy rolled the woman in and then helped her onto the bed, as the woman noted a small metal table that was set against the wall with two semi-clear plastic cubs filled with a white liquid in them. As the woman sat her self up on the bed, Judy walked over to them and lifted up both cups and then returned to the woman. Judy then handed the woman the first glass. After it was guzzled down with Judy&#39;s ears picking up a &quot;glug&quot; type of sound as the woman swallowed the milk, the woman returned the empty glass to Judy and then took the other. Judy didn&#39;t even get the time to give what had become something of a standard part of the conversion from Human to Animalian at Horizon.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m feeling better,&quot; the woman spoke and began guzzling down the second glass, making Judy back away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... the Animalia Virus does heal... and you did apply through Project Phoenix,&quot; Judy began as she moved to get back to the door as the woman suddenly surged up onto her feet and stood between Judy and the door.<br />
<br />
With a great &quot;fouf,&quot; the woman was surrounded in white fur and her hair returning to a bright blonde. At the same time she began to grow in size, and rapidly as well. At first the woman felt a bit cramped, but with a great &quot;boing&quot; like noise, her bust broke through her bra and shirt while her ears shot up to the top of her head as muscles enlarged well beyond what was normal for most Rabbit Animalians. She then looked down at herself and her reshaped feet and then smiled to Judy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hunni Bunni feels good,&quot; Hunni Bunni stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;But your name...&quot; Judy began, trembling a bit and noticing the very aroused scent that Hunni Bunni was giving off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is Hunni Bunni,&quot; Hunni Bunni interrupted, &quot;and I&#39;d like to go where others feel good and happy like I do now...&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;The little gray bunny gave Hunni Bunni some clothes and said I was big,&quot; Hunni Bunni then finished, &quot;so then I came here. They said I no match ID anymore but that more old Human Bunni, not new Hunni Bunni.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Her name is Judy,&quot; Jessica said slowly, thinking back on the Rabbit woman that had give Jessica the milk needed for Jessica&#39;s own conversion, though Jessica had only gotten a single dose. A part of Jessica wondered on how she compared to Judy now, but for the moment her focus was more on Hunni Bunni.<br />
<br />
Certain elements of Hunni Bunni&#39;s description of her transformation into an Animalian were rather cartoonish in nature. Jessica could remember her own transformation into an Animalian, and while it wasn&#39;t slow and agonizing, and Jessica had only gotten a single dose then, her fur didn&#39;t grow out with a &quot;fouf&quot; as though it suddenly appeared and she vaguely remembered some slight itching sensation as the transformation started. And while Jessica&#39;s own breasts had grown considerably since she first became an Animalian, at no point in the last four years did they go &quot;boing&quot; as they got bigger with the natural growth related to puberty. It sort of confirmed to Jessica something that the Horizon agent with her had said about Bunni&#39;s mental state. That the cancers she&#39;d had had been eating at her brain and while conversion was enough to save her life from the cancer, any mental abilities she had were weaker as a result of this. Thus when Hunni Bunni became Hunni Bunni... her ability to describe things were a bit vague.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you came here?&quot; Jessica then asked to Hunni Bunni.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, all Animalia&#39;s reports seemed to indicate that people had fun here,&quot; Hunni Bunni answered, &quot;though some seemed surprised to see me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably because you&#39;re a lot bigger than most of the other Rabbit Animalians... and if Judy is the one that gave you her milk... you were converted by an Animalian that before her uplifting was of a relatively modest size for a wild rabbit,&quot; Jessica answered.<br />
<br />
And Hunni Bunni was big. Jessica didn&#39;t think that the Horizon agent was right in saying that Hunni Bunni was over four hundred pounds, as that would essentially be more than two hundred pounds heavier than Rockwall, and he was Animalia&#39;s largest Rabbit Animalian. Though from what Hunni Bunni described, she guessed that the agent presently with them wasn&#39;t there for Hunni Bunni&#39;s conversion and might have only been responding to what Judy reported, which could have been influenced by some degree of fear if Hunni Bunni didn&#39;t give Judy the room to leave the conversion room.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was hoping she&#39;d be fun...&quot; Hunni Bunni answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure she is... but for a male Rabbit Animalian,&quot; Jessica answered, &quot;you are female.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hunni Bunni smiled at that and arched her back to point out her bust with pride. Almost as if she were trying to advertise herself to either the Horizon Agent or to one of the other males in club at the time. Though things were still a bit sparse in terms of the number of guests present, likely also in relation to what Animalia was trying to do what it could to reduce the risk of Covid spread, which was spiking in many parts of the country, including Nevada. Jessica also knew about Sophie and Roland being sent to cover something at Skull Island, hoping to get some answers to the rumors there, but if it related to Covid 19, Jessica had her concerns and even the safety measures that Animalia and its colony cities were trying to mandate might not be enough.<br />
<br />
&quot;And your bond mate? We could share him?&quot; Hunni Bunni asked, sounding hopeful.<br />
<br />
&quot;Roger is MINE,&quot; Jessica said in a low tone which got Hunni Bunni to shrink back away for a moment, &quot;if you want &quot;fun,&quot; you will need to find an individual to have fun with... and right now from what I&#39;ve been told... you&#39;ve had other issues that you may need help with.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like what the cancer did...&quot; Hunni Bunni said weakly.<br />
<br />
&quot;That is the cause we&#39;ve suspected,&quot; the Horizon agent spoke, &quot;Jessica&#39;s family is willing to help you with that...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And we will,&quot; Jessica nodded, &quot;but you will have to keep control over yourself. My parents aren&#39;t that old... but they don&#39;t tell me about their sex lives and I don&#39;t tell them the details about mine...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you do have sex,&quot; Hunni Bunni noted, &quot;it feels good?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jessica wanted to answer &quot;very&quot; but didn&#39;t think that would be appropriate, &quot;with my bond-mate and at an appropriate time. Understanding that will take some time and work. We can help... but it will take work on your part too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay...&quot; Hunni Bunni said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can start with what you will say when you introduce yourself to my parents,&quot; Jessica said slowly...</p>
