<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Andrew decided to keep on his way home. If his parents are still his parents, he will look for another place to stay and if reality has changed, well, he was curious of what will be his relationship with them now.<br />
<br />
The bus finally arrived at his home and he immediately noticed that his father was mowing the lawn, he stayed at the bus stop for a minute staring at his dad before he finally decided to talk to him. Andrew can hear the mower&#39;s motor getting louder and louder as he approached him until it suddenly stopped.<br />
<br />
Andrew&#39;s father had turned his mower off when he noticed Andrew almost next to him. “Uhm... hi?” Andrew told his dad while he raised a hand a little, his father was puzzled at first but then he changed that look into livid one. “Hi? Hi?! Do you think this is funny?!” His dad began to yell at him. Despite he was angry, Andrew was happy that he still recognize him. “We were expecting you to come back the whole night! Anthony has been crying for hours!”<br />
<br />
“Anthony?” Andrew repeated in utterly confusion. “Yes, your son. I&#39;ve already told you that me and Kendra can take care of him sometimes when you&#39;re busy. But not in his good damn birthday!!! He wanted to see his dad and spend time with you, but you just disappeared!!” He turned his mower on again and kept working. “He&#39;s upstairs. I don&#39;t know what are going to do but you&#39;re going to fix this!”<br />
<br />
Andrew and his former father didn&#39;t talk any more. Andrew looked up and noticed a small silhouette through a window in his room, or where his room was before. He came in and noticed that his former mother was vacuuming the living room. Like his father, she seemed furious and didn&#39;t say a word to him. He sighed and went upstairs realizing that his bigger body was making cracking noises on each step he take.<br />
<br />
When he was in front of his former room, he noticed that there were several poster of boy bands on the door. He would never put something like that on it, so he assumed that wasn&#39;t his room anymore. He knocked and a girly voice told him that it was open.<br />
<br />
Inside there was a girl no older than 12 years old watching music videos on her phone and another kid, a boy, probably 7 years old that he assumed was Anthony reading a book. “Uncle Andrew, you&#39;re back.” The girl said when she noticed his presence, Anthony stop reading for a second and took a brief look at him before he returned to his book, Andrew noticed how disappointed he was of him.<br />
<br />
“Sandra, darling, can you give us a minute alone?” Andrew said while he tried to hide how surprised he was of knowing the girl&#39;s name. She nodded and left the room, but Anthony didn&#39;t take his eyes from his book. “Listen, son...” Andrew started to speak but he immediately realized that he had no idea of what to say. He barely knows anything about this reality and he knows nothing about being a father.<br />
<br />
“I don&#39;t want to see you.” Anthony said while he tried to leave the room but Andrew didn&#39;t let him. “I know, but... damn, this is really hard. I don&#39;t know why I did what I did...” And he really doesn&#39;t know. “But something that I&#39;m sure is that being a dad isn&#39;t easy but I&#39;m trying my best because you&#39;re important to me. The circumstances had been rough for both of us, and I beg your pardon for being overwhelmed by that responsibility.”<br />
<br />
Anthony turned around and noticed that some tears were coming from his father&#39;s eyes. He didn&#39;t say a word but he now was listening to what Andrew was telling him. “I&#39;m so proud of you, despite we&#39;re very different. You are the smartest kid I&#39;ve ever seen and I am a completely mess. I don&#39;t deserve a son like you.”<br />
<br />
“Don&#39;t say that, dad...” Anthony replied while he hugged his father. Andrew hugged him back and they stayed like that for several minutes. “We have a lot in common. We both love videogames, you know.” Andrew smiled when he heard his son&#39;s words but he immediately noticed something. Something inside him that was worrying him a lot. He was growing a boner!<br />
<br />
He was in shock, he was getting turned on by a kid, and his own kid! That was terrible wrong and he immediately realized that was the reason he left the home last night. He needed to do something, maybe his body was trying to push him to be a pedophile but will try to fight against those urges. He stopped hugging his son and did his best to cover his hard dick. “Um, Anthony. What do you think if we go to the arcade, right now?”<br />
<br />
“That sounds great, dad!” Anthony seemed very happy and Andrew was very relieved that he didn&#39;t notice his erection. “I&#39;m going to tell Sandra. She loves to play those dance games!!” The boy immediately ran to tell his cousin and Andrew took this chance to ran to the bathroom. When he was in there, he closed the door and put his pants down. He was astounded when a big rock-hard dick jumped out like a spring and bounced for a brief moment.<br />
<br />
Andrew was in shock, one thing was being fat and hairy as a bear, but having a porn sized dick was something totally different. For an instant, he felt proud of himself, but then he remembered why he was hard right now. He must do something because he didn&#39;t want to think about a kid that way, even less his own kid!!<br />
<br />
Andrew put his pants on his knees and sat on the toilet and he heard a small splash when his hairy balls hit the water. He can&#39;t believe it, he also had big balls like a bull! To avoid the discomfort, he had to hold them with a hand while he began to jack off with the other one. Rubbing that long pole felt incredible, the hairs and veins on there made him even more aroused but his mind was another thing. He didn&#39;t know what to think while he was doing it.<br />
<br />
His former thoughts of pretty women wasn&#39;t working as good as before, and he refused to think in his son while he was masturbating. So, he started to lose his erection, which wasn&#39;t bad but also didn&#39;t feel as good as getting his climax. While he was thinking about it, a loud and nasty fart escaped from his hairy ass and without time to react, he started to shit a thick green tube of poop.<br />
<br />
Farts were still coming out and he felt astounded and mildly disgusted of noticing that his butt wasn&#39;t just covered in shit now, but it was also full of hair, hair covered in shit... He blushed a little before he clean himself. At least, if someone heard his farts he will have an excuse for why he suddenly went to the bathroom.<br />
<br />
When he was done, he noticed that Anthony and Sandra were waiting for him in the living room. Kendra was now in the kitchen, probably making dinner and his former father was still mowing outside. Anthony gave him some car keys which he assumed were from his own car and realized that he knew how to drive now. So, he took the kids back to the arcade.</p>
