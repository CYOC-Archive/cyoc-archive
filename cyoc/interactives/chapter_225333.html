<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I studied the glowing panels, tail swishing excitedly. Time to upgrade my Possession ability!<br />
<br />
I didn&#39;t feel the need to increase the efficiency of Possession. It was already working well enough for me. So bye for now, Range, Affliction and Insanity.<br />
<br />
While tempted by Empathy&#39;s promise of deeper insights from my host, but I kind of didn&#39;t want to mess with him for now. After everything that had happened in this short period of time, I felt sorry for him. He deserved a respite from my meddling, for now at least.<br />
<br />
Instead, Knowledge called to me. Tapping into my host&#39;s memories would help me better navigate this world. And what safer way to gain that wisdom than by borrowing from one who already lived here? Understanding was the first step to thriving in unfamiliar lands.<br />
<br />
But it was Heritage that truly sparked my imagination. I flexed, marveling at the beastman&#39;s muscular frame, feeling a surge of power and confidence. It was a clear contrast to my skinny old one, which had always made me feel weak and insecure. Gaining strength was always welcome, and what if Heritage let me internalize these animalistic gifts? I quivered with anticipation. And maybe, just maybe, I could become a real beastman if I got enough essence from my beastman hosts. That was my ultimate dream, to be one of them, to belong with them.<br />
<br />
Yes, this was right choice! Knowledge and Heritage would help me take the first steps toward discovering my true place in this world. With an eager yip, I made the selections. The panels flashed confirmation and dissipated. <br />
<br />
After upgrading, I eagerly accessed the beastman&#39;s memories, learning his name was Max. More importantly, I found a lake nearby perfect for washing up. The sticky mess matting my fur was rather unpleasant.<br />
<br />
I gathered the discarded flasks and my backpack, tail wagging happily despite my fatigue. As I prepared to leave, I realized my smartphone had been absorbed like my clothes into this body too! The implications delighted me. Protecting items, hidden storage, sneaking contraband - such a useful feature! But hygiene called first.<br />
<br />
I set off jogging, my borrowed lupine body moving on instinct through the dirt road. I reveled in the sensations - wind ruffling my fur, earthy scents teasing my nose, my powerful muscles propelling me onwards. The freedom and vitality were intoxicating, it felt really good to run as an anthro wolf.<br />
<br />
This was only the beginning of unlocking my beastman potential. With Max&#39;s knowledge and my drive, we could achieve anything! I smiled, picking up speed as the trees parted to reveal my destination shimmering in the sunlight ahead. The future brimmed with possibility if I faced it boldly. I had found my purpose in this world. My true adventure started today!<br />
<br />
This world was my childhood dream brought to life - a land where only anthropomorphic beings existed!  Anthros of every species thronged the streets. Rumors told of even more exotic Anthros in the seas beyond, by Max never see one.<br />
<br />
Luckily we all spoke a common tongue, though language barriers mattered little in fantasies like mine. This was an adventure prepared for me by an eccentric god, not some kind of perverted having fun in twisted game at my expense.<br />
<br />
And yes, magic and deities were real forces here too! Max&#39;s memories held a glimpse of a cleric channeling divine power to heal, though he knew little more. I made a mental note to find the church of the Good Samaritan God who had gifted me this second life, if possible, and when time allowed.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, as a gruff docker, Max had minimal exposure to the wider world. Yesterday&#39;s strife had pushed him over the edge, nearly wasting the precious gift of life. <br />
<br />
Max&#39;s life had been difficult from the start as an orphan on the streets, but he&#39;d survived against the odds.<br />
<br />
Yesterday began like any other at the docks, but Max&#39;s mind kept wandering to Amelia. The lovely rabbit girl from the bakery had captured his heart. He daydreamed of finally proposing to make her his bride.<br />
<br />
Distracted by these pleasant thoughts, Max made some clumsy mistakes. A crate slipped from his grasp, spilling its contents. The furious foreman Cornwall berated Max harshly. Further minor errors only angered Cornwall more, until he terminated Max&#39;s job.<br />
<br />
Crestfallen but still hopeful, Max went to the bakery to find Amelia. Her sweet smile could surely salvage this disastrous day! But there his dreams met a harsh end - lovely Amelia was already married to Brock, the burly bull who owned the bakery.<br />
<br />
Utterly crushed, Max left the bakery now without work or love. For a proud wolf, it was a painful blow. In just one day, all of Max&#39;s hopes had been shattered, leaving his future desolate. <br />
<br />
But the story wasn&#39;t over! Where one chapter ended, another began. I was here now to lift Max&#39;s life.<br />
<br />
For the port he worked before is the main port of Port-Tailus, the largest port city in the kingdom. Bustling with activity even at early hour. Ships of all shapes and sizes filled the docks, unloading their goods from near and far.<br />
<br />
The road I travelled is an old trading trail that use to connect two port cities. To my left stretched a vast forest, its ancient trees standing as sentinels over countless secrets within. To my right, open fields rolled on as far as the eye could see. Somewhere in the distance lay another road that would branch off towards one of the kingdom&#39;s prospering ports.<br />
<br />
My wolfish nose suddenly caught a most refreshing scent - the smell of fresh, clean water. Ah, I must be getting close to my destination! Eager to bath in this Great Moon Lake, I picked up my pace, fueled by childlike enthusiasm.<br />
<br />
The lakeside view was magnificent, its beauty captivating my gaze. Excitement bubbled within me as I swiftly discarded all my garments, fully embracing the freedom of being in my natural state. With my wolf-like muscular physique, I felt a surge of confidence and vitality, and a mischievous grin on my muzzle, I leapt into the water with great enthusiasm. Making a splash like a cannonball, I felt the coolness engulfing me, cleansing away traces of dirt and grime. It was a revitalizing sensation that left me feeling refreshed and rejuvenated.<br />
<br />
Emerging from the refreshing lake, I shook myself vigorously, sending cascades of water flying from my snowy fur. The droplets caught the sunlight, twinkling like scattered diamonds. I sat upon the sandy shore, my tail wagging contently as I began grooming my sopping coat.<br />
<br />
As I meticulously cleaned each part of my powerful wolf beastman frame, I marveled at the raw might coursing within these muscles. I traced my clawed fingers over the firm swells of my chest, feeling the thick pelt and hardened flesh. Though the sensations were foreign, a strange familiarity hummed just beneath the surface.<br />
<br />
My paws roamed lower, caressing the solid curves of my waist and hips. I had an hourglass figure that blended humanoid vigor with lupine strength. This body sang of a vitality and confidence I had never known in my frail human shell.<br />
<br />
There were scars across my body, varying in size and shape, some hidden under the fur, some visible to the eye. I caressed them with my clawed hand one by one, searching through glimpsing into Max&#39;s experiences for stories of fights and challenges overcome. But to my astonishment, many marks had been left not by brave battles, but simply his natural clumsiness. I chuckled inwardly at this discovery.<br />
<br />
My burly arms and legs evidenced great power, though not without flaw. My limbs possessed a hint of awkwardness, muscles bulging to the point of impeding my movement. I realized my arms were too stocky to easily reach my back, while my legs seemed to resist bending in certain ways. Max had adapted to these limitations, and now so must I.</p>
