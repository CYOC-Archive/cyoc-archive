<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Greg sat in the temple, meditating in front of the altar. Meditating in this instance also meant stroking his cock as he contemplated the new situation he and his friends found themselves in. He was sort of their leader after all now. While all of them were supposedly to be important in this new civilization, ever group needed someone in charge. Greg had been the head of their friend group, at least in responsibility, and it seemed a natural fit for the newly minted tiger man.<br />
<br />
He had also made the decision to stay behind when the other three went off to gather more recruits from the neighboring islands. They each had a job and the people they changed would reflect that. It was how the power flowed through them. Or so the voice inside the temple had explained. Richard&#39;s recruits would be the soldiers and protectors of their new home, Kenneth&#39;s chosen people would end up the hunters, fishers, and gatherers to keep them fed, and Mark&#39;s were the caregivers and the craftsmen, those that would build homes and make the things they needed, of course the lover would be the artist.<br />
<br />
That&#39;s why Greg had remained behind. His recruits would end up being teachers, scholars, and priests. They&#39;d need them eventually but not yet. Greg still wasn&#39;t sure who or what their new god was, but he was pleased enough to serve.<br />
<br />
--------------<br />
<br />
Jacob was looking for some place secluded. Someplace no one else knew of. He had come to this island as part of a scientific study team, checking on the ecology of the local islands. Still in college, he was there as the assistant to the team&#39;s anthropologist. Some strange ruins and cultural artifacts had been found on the islands so they were there to document and preserve them.<br />
<br />
He had stolen one, well, borrowed. Kind of. Only he knew it existed. It sat in the passenger seat of the motor boat as he shot across the waves. It was one of the most detailed maps of the islands he had ever seen, except it showed one that wasn&#39;t on modern maps, and it mentioned a temple containing an unimaginable treasure. If he could find it first.. Say he just stumbled upon it. Well, he&#39;d be famous,<br />
<br />
Finally, the island came into sight. Jacob had half believed it wouldn&#39;t be there. Who could misplace a whole island after all. But there it was, and a check of his GPS showed that it thought nothing was here. Except, someone had to be here, since as Jacob pulled up closer he noticed the wreckage of another boat on the shore. It wasn&#39;t old wreckage either, being no more than a few days old. A lost item and a rescue party. He would be famous.<br />
<br />
------------------<br />
<br />
Greg watched from the trees as the young man in his mid twenties hopped out of his boat. He was good looking, lean, even if he could do with a little muscle on him, with black hair pulled back into a ponytail, and scruff on his jaw. His skin was lightly tanned naturally, and darkened a bit more by the tropical sun. Too bad Mark wasn&#39;t here to have at this one, the man was just his type.<br />
<br />
The Sage was about to go claim him. He was on the island now, he was theirs. &quot;No. Just watch for now.&quot; Greg did as ordered and slunk back down into the bushes, watching eagerly with a fanged, feline grin.<br />
<br />
-----------------<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello?!&quot; Jacob called out as he walked from the beach to the tree line. There were foot prints all over the beach, so there were obviously people here, but the loose sand made it difficult to tell anything more than yes people had walked through it. Or people sized animals. He felt something tugging him towards the jungle. There seemed to be a trail hidden among the trees and he stepped onto it, walking for a few minutes before he noticed the temple up ahead. Just as the carving said there would be.<br />
<br />
He let out a little whoop and ran up to it, sandals slapping against his heels as he run up the stairs to the twin openings into the structure. He stepped inside to find an empty but otherwise well preserved ruin. &quot;This is amazing!&quot; He&#39;d need to photograph it later but for now he took it in. A large alter, the sides lined with four statues of anthropomorphized animal deities. Four? That wasn&#39;t right.<br />
<br />
He plucked a fruit from the tree growing in the middle of the temple, not even thinking about what he was doing as he took a bite. Sweet juices ran down his chin and dribbled onto his shirt. He looked at the garment and tossed it aside. The next bite caused the juice to run down his tanned chest but he could wash that off, easy. His mind was on another problem.<br />
<br />
The stone had mentioned a lead god and their five chosen. The altar could be for the main god, but there were only four other statues. He took another bite of fruit as he looked towards the wall opposite the altar, the entrances to the temple letting sunlight in from either side. The wall was overgrown with vines. He ate the last of the fruit and walked over, to the wall. He reached up and with a grunt tugged the vines. They started to come loose, falling to the temple floor.<br />
<br />
It was hard work, but eventually a fifth alcove was revealed, another statue standing on a plinth like the other four, still in near pristine condition as well despite having been covered in creeper vines. Jacob looked up at the statue of the fox. Smallest of the five, but still leanly muscled, he seemed to be smiling at some private joke. Jacob was sweating, panting, and strangely he was sporting the erection of his life in his shorts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Later came the fifth..&quot; A voice seemed to whisper in Jacob&#39;s head. &quot;The outsider, the hidden one, the Trickster. He would be the one to bind my people together. Spill your seed on the Trickster&#39;s altar. Take your place.&quot; Jacob knew there was something wrong with a voice whispering in his head telling him to jerk off on a statue, but his head felt cloudy and fogged. He let his shorts drop to the ground, wrapping his hand around his cock while his other hand came to rest at the foot of the statue.<br />
<br />
He looked up into those stone eyes and they seemed to be peering back at him. Into him. He felt a tingle running up his spine, an energy coursing through his body he couldn&#39;t explain. He felt invigorated, alive. He tossed his head back with a moan and came, splattering his seed across the base of the statue.<br />
<br />
Fire flowed through him. Red and white fur burst out across his chest, covering his torso. He felt his knees go weak, but as he started to fall a pair of strong, fur covered arms caught him. His own muscles were growing as fur engulfed his body, lean and lithe, quick and nimble. Not like the arms that held him, strong and sure. He felt his face pushing out into a muzzle as fur grew over it, an easy grin coming to his new vulpine face, large pointed ears moving to the top of his head.<br />
<br />
He could feel his tail growing behind him, could feel the muscles that made it sway and flick. Slowly the changes ebbed away and Jacob looked up to see a tiger&#39;s face hovering above his. Instead of being frightened he knew who this was as if by instinct. &quot;Sage.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Trickster.&quot; The tiger responded seemingly intrigued.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jacob.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Greg.&quot; The introductions continued. At least until the fox leaned up and planted a kiss on the tiger&#39;s muzzle, the effect of the fruit still lingering in his system and the Trickster&#39;s playful nature mixing inside of him. The two of them fell to the temple floor, exploring each other&#39;s bodies. After all, they had the place to themselves until the others returned. A little get to know you session seemed in order.</p>
