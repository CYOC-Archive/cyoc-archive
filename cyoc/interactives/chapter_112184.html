<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Happee waits for Julia to come to the circus, he knew she was coming because he had gone to the bar the previous night and she overheard a conversation about her going. He didn&#39;t know why specifically, but that didn&#39;t matter. Really what was on his mind was what he was going to say to her. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately he didn&#39;t have time, because Julia snuck up behind him.<br />
<br />
She tapped his left shoulder, and then disappeared to his right. A classic prank. When Happee figured it who it was suprised and flustered to see her there. Julia herself was a woman with Irish origin with a standard athletic figure and slight bubble butt. She had orange hair and pale skin. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Happee, I thought I might find run into you here.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well since you&#39;re here I have a few things to ask you. The first is well ah, would you maybe like to get some dinner sometime.&quot;<br />
<br />
Happee was planning on Transform or Daring Julia into a clown with some interest in him regardless, but he wanted to see if she was interested in him period. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well...&quot; she said sounding a bit coy and flustered at the same time, because she was going to ask him the same thing. &quot;Yes, that sounds great&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow... well then the second thing I was going to ask you is Transform or Dare?&quot;<br />
<br />
Julia was star struck for a moment, she had only lived in the city for a year and a half, and while she knew about the so called &quot;curse&quot; she didn&#39;t believe it. <br />
<br />
BBBBRRRRIIIINNNNGGGG!!!!!<br />
<br />
An alarm clock had just gone off in Hapees  pocket. He pulled it out, it was one of those old fashioned ones with the bells, and the hands were gloved fingers. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well times up, now you get both. For you transformation you will turn into a clown like me. As far as anybody knows, you always were a clown. You have a full knowledge of practical and impractical jokes, and everyone will think this is normal. And for your dare there are multiple parts for the first you will Transform or Dare everyone you know, Meet, and think they need to be cheered up. If they pick transform, you will make them into clowns for their transformation. If they pick dare, you will dare find people they know and give them the same T&D I&#39;m giving you. And if they pick both, you&#39;ll give them both.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Another part of your dare you will think that you and I have been dating for some time and it has worked between us. But those memories have been of you being a cute silly clown, and that you have always wanted me to propose to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Julia&#39;s eyes glazed over as her changes began, first her original pale skin gained a lot of color until it was almost a pink red hue and it covered her entire body, except for certain areas around her face, around her mouth there was a section of white shaped like a heart that complemented the shape of her face, and two ovals of white around her eyes that went up to her forehead. On her forehead new eyebrows appeared, they were now black drawn on lines that were very curvy and feminine at the same time. Blue diamonds appeared around her eyes as her mouth gained a very plump set of lips that were bright red. <br />
<br />
Next her hair exploded in an amount and turned bright orange. Complementing the diamonds on her face, her hair then formed itself into a long braid that rested on the side of she should and would swing whenever she rotated her head. <br />
<br />
Her original jeans and shirt changed next. Her long blue jeans much more baggy and the pant legs became very lose like they were from the seventies, her shirt however changed drastically into a very small short green pics of clothing that cling to her chest which had grow from a B to C cups, and suspenders then flew up from her pants to her shoulders. Orange buttons appeared on her shirts, and lastly a pair of rainbow socks appeared on her feet and her shoes doubled in size to 24 and became a pair of blue orange clown converse sneakers with bubble toes. <br />
<br />
Next her head began to fill with new memories, takents, skills, and experiences.   Her eyes glazed over and she had a distant look into her eyes until she came to. <br />
<br />
As a final tough. Her nose swelled to a bright red color and grew until it was the size of a peach on her face. Her eyes then came back over and her mouth gained a smile that looked even bigger with her heart shaped makeup. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello there Happee.&quot; JuJuBee said in a cute high helium voice. &quot;Ready for the show.&quot; She said that as she kissed him in the cheek. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes I am my dear.&quot; Happee said as she welcomed the cheek. Surprisingly the memories that he had implanted in JuJuBee filled his head to, but Happee remembered what is was before. <br />
<br />
He felt a bulged in his pocket and he knew what it was, and he knew now was a great time to do it. <br />
<br />
&quot;But first,&quot; Happee said as she got down on one knee and pulled out the box he had in his pocket. He opened it and there was a ring, well of course now the diamond was a ring, with a diamond as big as her nose. &quot;Will you marry me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like you even need to ask. YES!!&quot; JuJuBee said as she hugged and kissed Happee, who after slipped the ring onto her finger. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now lets go to the show, and also I believe it&#39;s your shift to greet the guests with Jen and Deen-Deen.&quot;</p>
