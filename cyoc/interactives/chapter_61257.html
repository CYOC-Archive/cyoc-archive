<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Slightly embarrassed Tim spoke up interrupting Joe's train of thought. &quot;It feels good doesn't it?.&quot; <br />
&quot;Ah . . . Tim is it . . . my name's Joe . . .  what's going on? Is this what I think it is? Oh shit I feel like I have a hard on to end all hard ons.&quot; Joe had his hands on his ever growing bulge all the time he was talking.<br />
&quot;Joe, JOE, JOE! I will explain about all this later, well at least I think I can explain but right now I NEED you to the next room and get me that jeweled chest on the table.&quot; Tim said pleading with his friend.<br />
&quot;Huh . . . what did you say . . . oh right the chest in the next room?&quot; Joe hurried off to the next room and retrieved the chest. When he re-entered the bathroom he was overcome by the strange looking object in front of him. <br />
&quot;JOE!&quot;<br />
&quot;What . . . oh yeah the chest . . . here you go.&quot; He says as he hands the chest to Tim.<br />
Tim takes the chest and fumbles with the keys. He removes the current key in the lock and puts in another. He presses the jewel with the down arrow and nothing happens. Desperately he tries one key after another keys until he is able to depress the jewel and feel it moment. There is a look of satisfaction on Tim's face when he finds the right key. He is too exhausted from all the ejaculation to push the jewel in all the way. The look of satisfaction changed to that of despair. Tim stares at his friend Joe with a &quot;help me&quot; look on his face. <br />
Joe can only stare at the giant phallus before him. It was hard to concentrate on anything else except the aromatic scent it was giving off. He could hear his friend talking but he could not tear himself away. The pearlescent white liquid was still flowing downwards to the already filled tub below. Chunks of plaster that littered the bathroom floor were inches deep in the overflow. Joe leaned forward to get a closer look at the giant erotic fountain. The closer he got the stronger the manly scent got. Instead of reaching for it with his hands he leans forward, with his tongue sticking out, and starts to lick the human fountain like ice cream cone. The cascading liquid is so thick that its electrostatic cohesive properties quickly covered Joe's face. As if he were washing his face Joe precedes to slather on more liquid from the erotic fountain. He leaned face first into the goo hugging the human fountain. The goo quickly cascades down over the obstruction that has attached itself to the phallic fountain. Joe could feel the warmth of the goo as it soaks into his clothing. It was getting hard to breath with the goo covering his nostrils so he opens his mouth for a much needed breath of air, but all he got was mouth full of goo. He reflexively tried to spit it out but the amount in his mouth was building so he drank it in instead. After a panic attack of the thought of drowning in goo Joe found that he didn't need to breath. The life creating goo was infusing his body with oxygen keeping him alive. Joe could feel the warmth penetrate every part of his body. Deep inside him he could feel the warmth building pushing his body outwards.<br />
******<br />
Saul had woken up early this morning with a start. He lived close by to the upscale salvage yard so his housing complex was affected by the power outage. All the various electronic devices in Saul's apartment that had clocks on them were out. He had no idea what time it was but judging by the amount of daylight streaming in the window it had to be close to seven-o-clock. There was just enough hot water for Saul to get a quick shower. Getting dressed he remembered that his cell phone had a clock on it. As Saul disconnected his phone from the dead charger he noticed that it was indeed was just after seven. He was not due to be at salvage yard for another two hours but he figured what-the-hell. He could get an early start on that pile junk that came in yesterday afternoon. It was a short trip to the salvage yard on his Vespa scooter. On his arrival he noticed the large pole like obstruction extending out of the residents of his boss. Being silhouetted by the rising sun behind it made difficult for Saul to see what the obstruction was so curiosity got the better of him. As he rounded the front of the building he saw the power company truck sitting on the other side with its boom extended high in the air.<br />
&quot;It must have been an optical allusion caused by the refractive properties of the morning sunlight.&quot; Saul thinks to himself.<br />
*******<br />
Saul's intelligence was something that he tried to hide from his friends at work. When he was in high school he was always being picked on by jocks. He could have gone to collage but knew that the harassment would be the same there as it was in high school. Much to the chagrin of his parents he left his hometown for the big city. He told them that he would be fine and could take care of himself. One of the first things he did was get a modest little apartment. Thanks to his parents he had a sizable checking account at one of the national bank chains. He had ready changed his glasses to contacts in an effort to make himself look &quot;dumber&quot;. He also got a job at an upscale salvage yard where his knowledge would get him into too much trouble.<br />
******<br />
The front door of the office/residents was open when Saul walked in. He saw a hastily written note on the cork board. He was about to leave when he heard a commotion coming from behind the door to the residents. The door was partially open as Saul cautiously approached it.<br />
&quot;Mr. Dane, Tim  . . . is everything ok?&quot; Saul called out as he pushed open the door wider.<br />
He could hear the muffled sounds of something going on coming from the direction of the bedroom. He had been privy to that part of the residents only a few times during his employment here at the salvage yard. He knew what was behind door number two, sort-of-speak. <br />
He was momentarily taken back by what he saw coming out of the bathroom door. There was a mass of slow moving goo on the floor extending out at least four feet. Floating in the goo were pieces of dry wall. Saul had his work boots so he was not afraid to step into to goo. God knows that he had stepped on far worse here at &quot;the yard&quot;. <br />
The somewhat familiar smell was different from anything that had ever assaulted his nose. It stirred something deep inside him. Saul cautiously steps into the large executive bathroom. This one room was bigger than his entire apartment put together. Even this large room was dwarfed by what he now was looking at before him. There before him stood the large figure of a man, hugging the even larger cylinder in the room, bathed in the same goo that was on the floor. The man was no ordinarily shaped man. He was the quintessence of the perfect male. Even though cum soaked rags covered his back they did little to cover its muscularity. Saul's eyes surveyed the muscular form. The broad shoulders and wide back sat atop a thin waist and an equally muscular striated ass. As his eyes followed the cascading goo downward he saw two very large muscular legs. Each by itself was just as large as the waist was wide. Together they were as wide as the upper body. The knees of the legs were pushed two feet apart by the shear mass of the upper legs. Large calf muscles, the size of footballs, were just below the knees. Saul could almost see the figure grow bigger with each passing second. He guesstimated that the &quot;man&quot; was about six foot six with about three hundred pounds of pure muscle and growing.<br />
&quot;Help me please.&quot;<br />
The sound of pleading for help shook Saul from his daydream. That was when he saw what the &quot;man&quot; was actually holding. It looked like part of a large penis covered in cum. Then it hit home, he was standing in a cum soaked room with a eight foot thick penis and a giant overly muscular man. He stumbled backwards against the bathroom wall. His hand hitting a glob of goo on the wall brought him back to reality once again.<br />
&quot;Saul, get a hold of yourself. There has got to be a reasonable explanation for what is going on.&quot;<br />
&quot;Saul you need to get out of here before you are affected too.&quot; Came the sound of a familiar voice once again.<br />
&quot;Tim is that you, where are you?&quot; Saul called out.<br />
&quot;Over here.&quot; Came the weak reply.<br />
Saul looked in what he thought was the direction of the voice. Why hadn't he seen it before? There at the base of giant penis was an equally large set of balls. Under the balls, up to his armpits in goo, was the cum soaked upper body of Timothy Dane, his boss, sitting in a large bath tub.  As he approached the tub Saul could see that Tim was still holding an antique looking chest.<br />
&quot;Saul, I need you to push the red jewel on the top of this chest before you are affected by the cum like Joe here.&quot; Tim pleaded with his friend.<br />
Being the good friend that he was Saul pushed on the red jewel. There was a corresponding &quot;click&quot; that Saul felt in his fingertip.<br />
&quot;Good I can only hope that will do the trick.&quot; Tim said weakly. &quot;Now as much as I like it pull that leech off of my dick.&quot;<br />
Saul turns to the right and sees that the man had grown bigger in the last few minutes. He had to be at least four hundred pounds of pure muscle now. How is he going to get him to let go? Than the strangest thing happened the behemoth released its grip on the giant phallus. As the cum covered body stepped backwards strings of goo were created between the massive bodies. But really caught Saul's attention was the phallus that was attached to the overly muscular body. It had to be at least two and a half long and as thick as a liter bottle coke.<br />
&quot;Saul, don't give into it.&quot;<br />
But the warning came too late.</p>
