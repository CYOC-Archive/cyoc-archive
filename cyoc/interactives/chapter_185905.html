<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">20 hours later the couple finally arrived at their resort. They were feeling fresh having travelled first class. All the same both were eager to get into a bed together for the first time as husband and wife.<br />
<br />
It was only while unpacking that Alicia found the small gift in her handbag. It came with a card that only said “For the newlyweds” Alicia did not recognise the handwriting.<br />
<br />
Eagerly she opened it up. She had not had time to inspect the pile of gifts at the reception. Her mother was going to ensure those gifts were taken to the mansion Henry had so recently purchased for her. She would have to wait until she returned home before she opened them.<br />
<br />
Inside the parcel was a strange colourful little doll only about 4 inches high. A piece of paper was with it.<br />
<br />
Alicia inspected the doll first. It was made up of colourful soft parcels of what felt like sand. These parcels were connected together to form the doll shape. It looked like the doll was offering up a gift. It’s legs and arms were fused together and in it’s hands was what looked like a stick of candy. Alicia was a little wierded out. It was a strange looking doll.<br />
<br />
She picked up the piece of paper that had been wrapped with the doll and read:<br />
<br />
“Sugar Doll”<br />
<br />
“Choose a part of the doll each evening. Dissolve it in a glass of water and share the drink. The crystals have an aura of magic which will make the two of you closer”<br />
<br />
“The magic from each sachet will last for 24 hours. Taste a new sachet before midnight or the effects of the previous one will linger until all the doll is consumed. The candy stick is a good one to start with as it will demonstrate how powerful this magic is”<br />
<br />
Interesting? Thought Alicia. She took the doll and the note and went to find Henry. He was on the phone talking to Simon his chief financial officer. Alicia waved to Henry to get his attention. Henry nodded and held a finger up as if to say “In a minute”<br />
<br />
Henry was eager to get off the phone and get to bed with his new bride. They had abstained from sex in the three days leading up to the wedding and Henry was feeling very lustful, however business came first and he had asked Simon to give him a daily update. Eventually with the update finished Henry was able to hang up, switch his phone off and join Alicia in the bedroom. She was leaning over the bed looking at something. <br />
<br />
Henry wrapped her in his arms and gave her a squeeze. She turned around and the two began to kiss. Alicia was as eager as Henry was. Soon he had undressed her down to her lingerie and she had dropped his trousers and released Mister Marvelous as she had nicknamed his penis. Seconds later he was inside her and she was screeching in delight. Alicia was a very vocal woman.<br />
<br />
It wasn’t until later in the evening when the two of them were getting ready to go out to dinner that Alicia remembered about the doll. She showed Henry the doll and the note leaving them with him as she fixed her make-up.<br />
<br />
Henry read the note and gave a chuckle, another one of Alicia’s airhead moments. She wasn’t the brightest spark in the room but she was always the best looking and a tigress in bed!<br />
<br />
Henry did wonder what particular drug the doll was dispensing. He smelt the doll. It just smelt like candy to him. Most likely nothing illegal. When he had been Alicia’s age he had on more than one occasion indulged in a few illicit products. Harmless fun he decided. He was on his honeymoon. He had an opportunity to not be the ‘Responsible CEO of a major company’. Why not? He decided he would humour her and prove that he was young of heart.<br />
<br />
So when Alicia came out of the bathroom all made up and looking stunning in a long brown dress which showed off her luscious figure, Henry held up the doll and said to her “We can try this out after dinner ‘My Lady’”<br />
<br />
Alicia held out her left hand the one which now had a wedding ring on it alongside the 3.5 carat diamond engagement ring. Henry took it and escorted her to the waiting limousine.<br />
…<br />
3 hours and a thousand dollars later they returned to their suite. Both had enjoyed their evening. Alicia liked Henry more when he wasn’t on the phone (and Henry had vowed that for the duration of the honeymoon he would only answer calls for 1 hour per day) and Henry just enjoyed being the man with the hottest woman.<br />
<br />
As Henry began to try and extract Alicia from her brown dress she reminded him “We have to try out the doll. The note said it would bring us closer” she giggled. <br />
<br />
Henry knew that Alicia already had enough alcohol in her system to make her very compliant, however a small amount of sugar water wouldn’t cause any harm.  The undressing would have to wait. He watched as Alicia went to the sink and filled a glass with water. The way her bum swayed as she walked was delectable. She had such a sexy walk, probably something to do with the fact that she always wore killer heels. The heels along with her natural height made her look like a goddess. It had been an easy decision when Maureen had given him the ultimatum “Either she goes or I do” when she had discovered Alicia had become Henry’s PA. Goodbye Maureen!<br />
<br />
Alicia returned with the glass. “What should we try first? The candy stick the note suggested?”<br />
<br />
“Sure beautiful. It’s as good as anywhere to start”<br />
 <br />
It didn’t take much to pull the candy stick away from the rest of the doll. It had just been attached by a thin thread “Do I just drop it in or do I break the sachet?”<br />
<br />
“Try dropping it in. If the bag doesn’t dissolve then I expect the crystals inside will anyway”<br />
<br />
The bag actually did dissolve and quite quickly. The way the glass fizzed up reminded Henry of an aspirin added to water. That made him suspect the crystals probably were aspirin. He didn’t tell Alicia that though. She thought they were trying out some mystical magical substance.<br />
<br />
‘So we drink half each” Alicia explained emptying half the glass down her pretty little throat before passing the glass to Henry. He quickly swallowed the rest before earnestly getting to the task of undressing his new wife.</p>
