<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty, Jason, Rob, Salvador, Peter Pendragon and Peter Karlowski were at the gymnastics hall on that Friday afternoon, just after school was over. Peter and Rob had about an hour of practice to go through, while Pete, Ty, and Jason watched from the sidelines.<br />
<br />
Ty and Pete gasped when they looked up and saw Peter looping from the high bar, hanging suspended and upside down from over 15 feet in the air. Peter swung around the bar three times before he let go on the fourth swing, allowing his body to roll rapidly in mid air, before touching down on the floor mat for the dismount.<br />
<br />
Peter finally landed on his feet, but he almost lost his balance and had to make a step back. It wasn’t a perfect landing, but the rest of his routing on the bar was perfect. He became known as the “Lord of the High Bar” in gymnastics, although he still had to work on the landing.<br />
<br />
Ty, Salvador and Pete got up as Peter walked over to them, rubbing the chalk from his hands with a towel.<br />
<br />
“Hey cousin, you did great! You’re getting really good on the high bar!” Ty said to him, feeling proud of the young gymnast.<br />
<br />
“Thanks, Ty… I just can’t get the landing right… I still need to work on that…” Peter replied, as he grabbed his gym bag which was sitting on one of the chairs next to Ty and Pete.<br />
<br />
“Hey Peter! Can we go to the mall after this?” Pete asked Peter.<br />
<br />
“Actually… I need to go buy the bank first, so I can deposit my paycheck from the grocery store! It’s always nice to get paid for pushing grocery carts over the parking lot every afternoon!” Peter replied, with a chuckle.<br />
<br />
“Oh come on, Peter! It’s not that much work!” Rob said to Peter, as the group was walking towards the locker room.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, what are you complaining about? You use your POWERS to push the grocery carts! That takes no effort at all!” Ty said to Peter with a strict tone of voice.<br />
<br />
Peter and Rob walked in the locker room, leaving Pete, Ty, Salvador and Jason waiting outside. They discussed what they wanted to do at the mall, especially since it was the weekend and they were all in the mood to go see a movie.<br />
<br />
About five minutes later, Peter and Rob came out, as they joined the group while they were discussing the movie plans.<br />
<br />
“Hey guys, I need to go to the bank first to deposit my check, and I have to do that before they close. Why don’t I just meet you at the mall?” Peter wondered out loud. Ty was standing right besides him, and he already knew what Peter had to do first.<br />
<br />
“I’ll go to the mall with the rest of the group, and we’ll just meet you there later!” Ty responded. “Maybe someone wants to join you while you go to the bank?”<br />
<br />
“I’ll go to the bank with PK!” Pete replied then. <br />
<br />
Ty then got his group together and instantly made Rob, Salvador, and Jason disappear from the gym. Moments later, they appeared at the mall, where they went to get the tickets to go see the movie. In the meantime, the two Peters were still at the gymnastics hall.<br />
<br />
“Darn it, how does he do that, eh mate?” Pete said to Peter, who just smiled since he has gotten used to Ty and his tricks.<br />
<br />
“Trust me, I’m worse then Ty!” Peter laughed, as he picked up his soft bag. In and instant, Peter and Pete had vanished into thin air, just to appear a second later in front of the bank entrance of the local bank where Peter has a savings account.<br />
<br />
It was exactly 4:15PM in the afternoon and the bank was crowded with people, who were trying to cash their checks before the bank was due to close for the weekend. There were at least fifty people standing in three lines, and there were about six tellers who were helping the customers. Peter and Pete just stood in line, patiently waiting their turn to cash the paycheck.<br />
<br />
Then a series of events took place, which caught everyone in the bank off guard. Suddenly all the lights went out, causing emergency backup light to go on. People panicked, for it had gotten pitch dark in the building. But what appeared to be a power failure now appeared to be part of a staged plan to commit a bank robbery on that Friday afternoon!<br />
<br />
“HANDS UP EVERYBODY!!!” one man screamed, with a ski mask over his head and a gun in his hand. He was standing right by the entrance, and there was another masked man standing next to the row of teller windows, holding a large, plastic bag.<br />
<br />
Several people screamed as everyone was in panic. Peter and Pete calmly raised their hands, although Pete wasn’t sure what Peter had in mind.<br />
<br />
“Why don’t you do something to stop them? You have the power to stop this!” Pete thought, while looking Peter in the face.<br />
<br />
“I know that, but there are too many people in here and I want to wait till the last minute to do something, just in case the Police get here first. Then I don’t need to use my powers in front of all these people…” Peter said back to him.<br />
<br />
“Listen dude,” Pete thought in reply, “If we don’t stop him, he will get away with all our money! And I sure as HELL do not want that to happen!<br />
<br />
“OKAY… EVERYBODY IN THE VAULT… NOW!!” the bigger of the two robbers said, while the smaller one was waiting for the tellers to empty all the cash out of their drawers and throwing the money in the plastic bag.<br />
<br />
“Pete… I’m going to make myself stretchy, just in case they shoot me. So stay behind me because they can’t hurt me now…” Peter whispered, as his skin became elastic. But he made sure his color stayed the same, so nobody noticed. <br />
<br />
The customers and bank employees quietly marched into the vault, as the smaller robber joined the bigger one while he was holding the bag of money in his hand.<br />
<br />
“Peter! They’re about to make a getaway! If you want to do something, you had better do it now, before they close the door to the vault and trap us inside of here!” Pete said to his companion.<br />
<br />
The two Peters then immediately assaulted the two robbers, but the smaller one dropped his gun on the floor since he was holding on to the big money bag. Peter tried to push the smaller robber in the corner, while Pete battled the larger one. Then the older one pulled his gun and first shot Peter in the chest, forcing him to stumble back for a moment.<br />
<br />
“PETER!” Pete shouted out loud, as he tried to knock the gun from his assailant’s hand. But he shot Pete in the shoulder, before dropping the gun on the floor so he could get away.<br />
<br />
“Oh no you don’t!” Peter shouted, as he carefully plucked the bullet from his elastic skin. He tossed it on the floor, and immediately wished for the front doors to be locked. The younger robber tried desperately to get out the front door, but panicked when he realized the doors were locked, as Peter began to approach him from behind.<br />
<br />
Inside the vault, Pete placed his hand over the wound on his shoulder, while the robber tried to look for another way out, not realizing what was happening to the wounded Peter Pendragon.<br />
<br />
“Ahhh you think you can shoot Wyraach Ur???” Pete said to him. “You rrreally think you can kill a drrrrrragon?!?”<br />
<br />
The robber turned around and gasped when he saw how Pete’s body was changing. All the others in the vault moved away from him as well, since they had no idea that the teenage boy was slowly being transformed into a dragon!<br />
<br />
The robber looked on in complete shock as he noticed that Pete’s skin had begun to split open. And the area where he had shot him? That had completely healed it as strong, deadly black scales began to tear through the boys flesh. Sharp stabbing points became noticeable in his fingers.<br />
<br />
“Holy cow, look at that boy over there!” one of the men said, as the crowded was stunned to see the transformation as it began to unfold before their very eyes.<br />
<br />
The stabbing pains grew worse and worse, until long sharp crimson dragons claws tore through the weak skin of his hands as they covered with scales, growing into deadly talons! The thief got a real shock when Pete opened his mouth and hissed angrily at him, revealing a purplish-black forked tongue, as well as slowly growing fangs!<br />
<br />
The masked man grabbed hold of his ski mask from behind and he pulled it up over his head, revealing his face. For he had to see the teenager as he transformed into a mighty dragon with his own eyes! <br />
<br />
“Holy smoke! I just shot a kid who could turn into a dragon?” he exclaimed, as he slowly walked towards the back wall in the vault as he watched the boy’s transformation, as it reached its final phase.<br />
<br />
“My change isssss farrrrr frrrrrom overrrrr!” he hissed, as his pants tore open, revealing his legs, which began to bulge with muscle and strength, tearing the skin and revealing more scales, which were tipped with deadly sharp points. The stabbing pains that were in his fingers a few moments ago started to spread to his wrists, shoulders, elbows and knees, and he could not help but let out a loud scream. <br />
<br />
“AAAARRRRRRRRGHHHHHHHGGGGGG!” But this did not sound like a scream, more like the fear inducing roar of a dragon!<br />
<br />
“EVERYBODY! GET OUT HERE! IT’S A DRAGON!” one of the men shouted, as panic had erupted among the onlookers as the dragon was forming before their eyes. Everyone began to scream, and Peter could hear the screams in the other room, on the other side of the wall that separated the vault from the lounge area in the bank.<br />
<br />
His legs started to fill with an ungodly strength, as his form began to grow more and more serpentine. 4 large lumps began to press against his back, as a large bump appeared at his rear. The bump erupted into a powerful tail, covered on its top half with black scales, and sharp spikes, and the underside with protective crimson scutes. The scutes concealed his gender as sharp spikes erupted from his knees, elbows, shoulders and wrists. His neck then began to grow INSANELY long, new vertebrae growing, each with a deadly crimson spike on top of it. He screamed again.<br />
<br />
“RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!” But all that came out was the roar of a dragon, a roar that could strike fear into the hearts of anyone!<br />
<br />
His legs started to twist and form until they settled into a pair of powerful black dragon legs, as his toes became deadly talons!<br />
<br />
“EEEEEEEKKKKK” the poor bank customers screamed, as they ran out of the vault. But they couldn’t go to the entrance either, because peter was battling Sergio there. They were trapped near the teller’s counter, as the two Peters continued to battle the bank robbers.<br />
<br />
The four lumps on his back ripped open suddenly, bones growing out and forming to form massive wing bones. Scales soon formed round the bones, as well as the muscles needed to fly, as the fingers on each wing began to grow longer, and thick leathery webbing was formed, soon leaving four beautiful, majestic, yet deadly wings, each with a sharp piece of organic metal, smeared with blood. His changes were nearing the end, and he spoke to the robber, a voice which hissed evilly enough to invoke terror into his heart<br />
<br />
“How about thissssss…… It’ssssss my turrrrrrn to sssshhhhhoot you with some FIRRRRE!!!” Wyraach Ur hissed out loud, as he was looking down at the man, who was trembling with fear.<br />
<br />
“GET… GET AWAY FROM ME… YOU… YOU MONSTER!” the robber screamed at the top of his lungs, as he was pushed in the corner with a large, live dragon standing before him.<br />
<br />
A large lizard-creature with a human head looked at the robber, but this was short lived as he closed his eyes as they began to sting. His nose and jaw fused and pushed out into a scaly black dragon’s beak. Tears of blood flowed as his eyes snapped open, glowing crimson red and glowing with an unnatural fire from within. His vision began to increase dramatically as his pupils slitted. His human teeth fell out and sharp, deadly black saber like fangs grew from his bleeding gums. 5 deadly horns grew from his head as super sharp spines grew all the way along his spine. His ears fanned out and his hearing increased dramatically, he could hear the heartbeats of everyone in the bank. A small burst of flame erupted from his deadly maw as he snapped at the air. His change finished, he roared in triumph as Peter Pendragon had been replaced by the almighty dragon, Wyraach Ur! <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the other robber was leaning with the back against the glass door while Peter Karlowski was walking towards him.<br />
<br />
“Wait a minute, you were just shot! You’re supposed to be DEAD!!” the robber screamed at him.<br />
<br />
“No, my friend… As of right now, you’re MINE!” Peter said, with fire in his eyes. Peter unleashed his mental powers on the robber, freezing him in his tracks. The man was suddenly levitating in mid air, about a foot off the ground, when an invisible force hurled him with his back against the wall near the entrance of the bank.<br />
<br />
“Now, take the mask off!” Peter ordered him. The robber removed the ski mask from his face, revealing the face of a teenage boy, who was probably the same age as him. Immediately Peter’s jaw dropped wide open, when he recognized the robber.<br />
<br />
“Sergio?” Peter wondered, recognizing his classmate from school.<br />
<br />
“Peter… Please… Don’t touch me man… Put me down!” Sergio pleaded with him, as he broke out in sweat.<br />
<br />
“What on Earth do you think you’re doing, Sergio? You’re helping out somebody who is robbing a bank, for crying out loud!” Peter shouted back at him, feeling very angry and hurt that his own classmate has become a bank robber.<br />
<br />
“PUT ME DOWN, PETER!! Golly, this is so weird… WHO ARE YOU, ANYWAY?” Sergio shouted, since he was still suspended in mid air, with his back against the wall.<br />
<br />
“You incredible IDIOT! How did you ever get around to robbing banks and shooting people? Are you out of your mind?” Peter said calmly, but feeling very angry and disappointed.<br />
<br />
“Okay Peter…  I also know a little hypnotism and mind control… I want you to let go of me NOW!” Sergio shouted, as he suddenly became very calm and focused hard on Peter.<br />
<br />
Suddenly Peter felt an incredible pain in his head, like a splitting headache, as Sergio was fighting hard to block Peter’s mind control power. For a moment, Peter lost his balance, and Sergio dropped back down on the floor. Immediately Sergio turned towards a few of the bystanders and used his own hypnotic powers to make them walk towards him, as he pulled his knife out of his pocket. He then grabbed hold of a well dressed lady and held the knife’s blade close to her neck.<br />
<br />
“Get AWAY from me, Peter, or ELSE I’ll kill this lady!” Sergio shouted, as Peter was left dazed for a moment.<br />
<br />
Peter just stood there, not wanting to endanger the woman’s life, but he knew that Pete would be outside soon, so Sergio couldn’t go far with his hostage! He then unlocked the front door using his psychic powers, knowing that he couldn’t go too far away from the bank.<br />
<br />
At that very moment, Pete was facing Jake, who was the older bank robber who had attempted to shoot both Peters using his gun. Wyraach Ur had Jake cornered, and he realized that there was no escape.<br />
<br />
“Pete… I need your help!” Wyraach Ur heard Peter say using his psychic powers. “Sergio is about to run out the door with a hostage, so I need you to come out of the building and to start a fire to block him from going anywhere!”<br />
<br />
Wyraach Ur was facing the main robber, who was terrified!<br />
<br />
“Thisssss isssss what happenssssss when you try to ssssssssshoot a drrrrrrragon….” Wyraach Ur hissed, as he took a deep breath, opened wide his large dragon muzzle, and shot a thin hot flame at Jake’s right arm, setting it on fire! Jake immediately feel to the floor, screaming of pain, as he frantically started to rub his burning arm on the rug in his attempt to extinguish the fire, leaving burnt marks on his skin. Jake was now on the floor in pain, and Wyraach Ur knew that he could no longer get away!<br />
<br />
“Now, if you excusssssse me… I need to go help Peterrrrrrrrr….” Wyraach Ur said, as he looked up, closed his eyes, and flapped his wings as he smashed a large hole through the bank’s ceiling, so that he could fly out in the open. As the mighty dragon was airborne, he circled the bank and flew low over the area surrounding the front entrance on the parking lot. Just at that moment he spotted Sergio and another woman running out the door, and they were immediately followed by Peter Karlowski.<br />
<br />
“Wyraach Ur! Stop them!!!” Peter shouted at the dragon, and the deadly, flying lizard immediately obeyed. The dragon then slowed down, took a deep breath one more time, and shot a thin flaming stream at the pavement surrounding where the bank robber was, surrounding him with a circular wall of fire.<br />
<br />
“Oh NO! We’re trapped!!” Sergio shouted, while he was still holding on to the young lady.<br />
<br />
Peter then ran up to the blaze, facing Sergio, who was on the other side of the flaming wall.<br />
<br />
“This is as far as you’ll go, Sergio! I’m going to lock you up!’ Peter shouted. Peter held his right hand in front of him, and a small circle formed on the palm of his hand, which materialized out of nowhere!<br />
<br />
“Shrink to one inch and get inside of my pokeball, Sergio! The party’s over!” Peter commanded. Immediately Sergio felt his body shrinking rapidly, forcing him to let go of the lady. She now appeared to be growing bigger and bigger in his eyes! Since he could no longer hold her, he was forced to let go of her and he dropped the knife.<br />
<br />
“Oh no… Peter, please…. NOOOOOOOOO!!!!......” Sergio screamed, as he was shrinking to about an inch tall!<br />
<br />
“Get inside my ball, Sergio!” Peter commanded. Sergio’s tiny body suddenly disappeared, and he reappeared a second later, trapped in the glass ball which Peter had in the palm of his hand.<br />
<br />
Then Peter stepped across the flames without burning or feeling the flames, and he reached out his hand to the lady. He helped her up and he gently lifted her off her feet, so he could carry her to safety.<br />
<br />
Suddenly they heard the sirens of police cars and the fire engine, as these were speeding the way over to the bank. Peter realized how everyone would panic when they would see a dragon, so Peter ran towards the back of the building and immediately transformed himself into a bird.<br />
<br />
The small yellow robin then flew towards Wyraach Ur, who was still flying over the area, and the robin gently landed on the top of the deadly dragon’s back, just above the wings. It then transformed back into Peter, who immediately wished for a leather strap to be securely fastened around the dragon’s neck, giving him something to hold on to.<br />
<br />
“Wyraach Ur! Make one more pass over the building so that I could fix the hole in the roof!” Peter ordered the dragon, which swooped down just low enough for Peter to have a clear view of the hole in the roof.<br />
<br />
“Bessssst fix thisssss thing and make it look asssss good asss new!” the dragon replied, “I don’t think the paperrrrsss would believe that a drrragon did thissss!”<br />
<br />
“Roger that, my dragon friend!” Peter replied, feeling the wind blowing in his face while he was riding on top of the dragon. “I wish for the bank’s roof to be completely restored to how it was before the robbery took place!” the young wizard wished out loud, allowing his magic to fix the hole in the building’s roof. The roof was restored in a flash, and everything looked the way it was before.<br />
<br />
“Let’s get away from here! I’m hungry! Let’s go eat somewhere before the police see us!” Peter shouted back at his trusted dragon. He loved riding on Wyraach Ur’s back, and it reminded him of the many folk tales he had read and enjoyed as a kid. But now he had a dragon of his own, and he enjoyed riding on it!<br />
<br />
As the dragon took the wizard several miles away, Peter looked back and caught a glimpse of what was going on. Several police officers helped the bank’s clients and staff, and the ambulance came as well. The firemen had put out all the fires, and the paramedics were treating Jake’s arm for the burn marks. Jake was then taken away in a police car, where he was now under arrest for attempting to rob a bank. But Peter knew he had Sergio with him, and he felt the need to have a talk with his classmate later on.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, Wyraach Ur had gently landed on the parking lot of a fast food hamburger establishment, which was located just off the highway. Peter let go of the leather strap and hopped from the dragon’s back, landing on the ground in front of him.<br />
<br />
“Stay here, Wyraach Ur! I think I know what you’ll like to eat…” Peter said, looking up to his giant, pet dragon. He then turned around and walked into the restaurant.<br />
<br />
The teenage wizard and basketball player then walked in to the restaurant, and he immediately proceeded towards the front counter, where one of the sales representatives was waiting to take his order.<br />
<br />
“Can I have two-dozen super size hamburgers with chips, please? And please add extra ketchup with them too!” Peter asked in a friendly tone of voice.<br />
<br />
The lady behind the counter gave the tall wizard a confused look, as she rang up the sale on the cash register.<br />
<br />
“Wow! Well you’re a big kid, but I wouldn’t think you’d be so hungry that you could eat two-dozen hamburgers!” the lady said, with a chuckle.<br />
<br />
“Oh, well they’re not just for me!” Peter replied.<br />
<br />
“Who else is with you?” the lady wondered out loud.<br />
<br />
“Jusssst a drrrrragon who isssss rrrreally rrrreally hungrrry!” the dragon said, while looking through the glass window. The lady’s mouth dropped wide open when she saw a large, slitted eyeball staring through the glass window, with great deadly black fangs sticking out everywhere in a hungry smile.<br />
<br />
“That’s my pet dragon… The hamburgers are for him!” Peter replied, saying it in a very normal tone of voice, while pointing his finger at the dragon, which stood there and was patiently waiting outside.<br />
<br />
The lady was so dumbfounded that she forgot to give Peter his change, as she handed him a large tray with two-dozen hamburgers stacked on it. Peter then reminded her of his change, which she gave him, while she was still in shock. Then he grabbed hold of the tray and walked out the door.<br />
<br />
Once outside, he removed the paper wrapping from every hamburger; and he laid them neatly back on the tray. He then walked over to his dragon, which was patiently waiting for his dinner.<br />
<br />
“Alright, open wide, Wyraach Ur!” Peter said, as he tossed the first burger into the dragon’s deadly open beak. He continued to toss them in until there were just two hamburgers remaining, which were for Sergio and himself.<br />
<br />
“It's time to give the bank robber something to eat. Look at him; he's been changed into a pocket monster!” Peter said, as he grabbed the ball out of the pocket on his pants, and he tossed the ball on the floor. Immediately a small, flying creature emerged, who came flying towards Peter, landing right before his feet.<br />
<br />
“I want you to turn back into Sergio!” Peter commanded, while looking down at the small, 1-foot tall creature.<br />
<br />
Slowly but surely, the small, confused creature began to grow to about six feet in length, slowly transforming back into the human form of Peter’s classmate Sergio. Peter allowed for Sergio to be dressed as well, so he wasn’t out in the cold. He then handed Sergio a hamburger, as he took the first bite out of the last remaining hamburger for himself.<br />
<br />
“Oh my God, Peter! Thank you so much…” Sergio said, as he embraced Peter for a moment. But then he looked up and noticed the deadly dragon.<br />
<br />
“Rrrrrrememberrrrr me, Ssssserrrrgio? I am prrrrretty sssssurrrre you do!” the dragon angrily hissed at him.<br />
<br />
“WWWHHHAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!! PETER!!! I didn’t do it! Jake made me do it! HELP!!!!” he began to scream, as he grabbed hold of Peter and started to shake him out of fear.<br />
<br />
“I know that, Sergio! Just relax, Wyraach Ur is my dragon. I just want to know why you were trying to rob the bank! You’re my classmate and I want to help you to get out of this mess!” Peter replied calmly, as Sergio was still trembling with fear.<br />
<br />
“Sergio, this is what I want you to do! You will run to the police station, which is just three blocks from here! There you will turn yourself in, because it’s the right thing to do. You’ll tell them what you did and why you did it, and they’ll realize that you were dragged into this by Jake and they will eventually set you free again. But you must go to the police station now!” Peter explained to him.<br />
<br />
“What? No way, Peter! I don’t want to go to the Police! You can’t make me! Look, just make me younger or use your power to change how I look, and nobody will ever find me!” Sergio replied, hoping to get the easy way out of the serious situation he has gotten himself in.<br />
<br />
“Absolutely not! I can’t have that on my conscious! Now, get going! It’s the right thing to do!” Peter shouted back at him.<br />
<br />
“NO! I’m NOT going to the police! You can’t make me go there!” Sergio shouted back.<br />
<br />
“Well I can’t, but my dragon for sure can!!” Peter responded calmly, giving Wyraach Ur a wink.<br />
<br />
“What parrrrt of going do you not underrrrssstand?” he hissed evilly, giving Peter a wink. “It looksssss like I will take you therrrrre, asssss rrrrevenge forrrrrr the beating you gave me on my firrrrsssst day!” he grinned an evil grin.<br />
<br />
“GET AWAY FROM ME!!!” Sergio screamed, as he turned and began to run away from Wyraach Ur. But the dragon wanted to help him out, so he took a deep breath, and spewed a flame of fire at Sergio’s pants, setting them on fire! Sergio was now running towards the police station at full speed, banging on the front door for someone to let him in. The officer used a fire extinguisher to put out his blazing jeans, and another officer took him into custody. This left Peter and Wyraach Ur behind at the restaurant, laughing it up as they watched Sergio jog to the station.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry; he’ll be back in school in a few days. He’s just a very confused guy, that’s all…” Peter said, as he turned to the big, black dragon.<br />
<br />
“Can I go for one more ride on your back?” Peter asked Wyraach Ur, who was quietly waiting for the wizard’s orders.<br />
<br />
“SSSSSSure, Peterrrrrrrr!” the dragon responded. Peter then climbed back on to the dragon’s back and grabbed hold of the strap. The dragon flapped his wings rapidly, while taking a few rapid steps forward. Then the dragon was airborne again, with Peter sitting on his back.<br />
<br />
“We’ll need to meet Ty, Rob, Jason and Salvador at the mall. I bet they won’t believe it when we tell then what we had just gone through!” Peter shouted at the dragon, while he was feeling the cold wind blowing in his face.<br />
<br />
So Peter decided to enjoy every minute of his ride, for he knew that it would not happen every day that he would get the chance to ride on the back of a large, black dragon!<br />
<br />
The end<br />
