<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Are you seeing the pattern? I waited till the next night and once Sarah was asleep I played my games again. This time though I wanted to go a little further. Keep her asleep still, but something different for her transformation.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish we were in a white expence.&quot; I stated to start. Instantly all our bedroom furniture was atop a white floor lacking any details. As though the walls of our room had toppled over like a set from a TV show and infinite white at reached out all around us.<br />
<br />
It was surreal to say the least. <br />
<br />
Now that i had some space, and by some I mean unending I racked my brain for just what I wanted to do. I&#39;d always had a fascination with movie monsters and science fiction, I know I wanted to do something in that wheelhouse, but more...<br />
<br />
Listen you get the ability to alter reality n see how forthright your imagination becomes. It&#39;s like an international all you can eat buffet, there&#39;s to many options and you can&#39;t decide if you want Italian, Chinese, or Mexican first!<br />
<br />
Pinching the bridge of my nose I sifted through my archive of creature before settling on one.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish Sarah would slowly become a behemoth rom The Mist.&quot;<br />
I figured it was bizarre enough and large enough to be a good starter.<br />
<br />
Sarah&#39;s body became to shift once again under the sheets. I positioned myself to behind our layed out furniture so when I eventually needed to back away from my transforming wife&#39;s body I didn&#39;t trip over anything. <br />
<br />
The first shifts I saw were in her body legth. As usual it was concealed by the sheets but I could see her streach out across the bed. Her arms and legs also became to stretch out, first tucked into her body, cuddling nothing. Then reaching past the hem of the sheets to dangle over the edge of the mattress. I could see her hands starting to shift now.<br />
<br />
Her fingers fusing togther, the skin leathery with scattered bristles of hairs. The four fingers fusing into one thick bone and the fingernails colliding into one a swell. Her hand resembled more of a hoof now rather then a hand. And the one bone her hand had become was now rapidly growing outward reaching a legth equal to her forearm. The point that was once her wrist bloated obscenely as it took on the curvature of a knee joint. That is until it divided into two joints, an new bone growing between it forming another section of leg.<br />
<br />
In watching its shift I missed the same happen to her rear leg. The foot becoming misshapen and hoof like. She also had a buldge form in the middle of her expanding body. From under the sheets it looked like another hump of shoulders. To confirm my suspicions (which I already knew, as I&#39;d picked the creature she was becoming)  another monsterus limb soon chased after its twin below it to catchup in its growth.<br />
<br />
I now took in that Sarah was growing in general along with her additions. The mass of her body now spanned the whole of the bed. Soon the sheet would come off and I&#39;d bear whiteness to the gigantic beast.<br />
<br />
Her growing arm collided with a dresser once set against the non existent wall, slowly tipping it over with a crash. I feared it be enough to wake her but as she lay still on the straining bed that seemed to not be the case. A wheezing snore began to register in my ears and I darted around to the head of the bed to better watch the next part unfold. <br />
<br />
In the movie it never gave a good look at the creature, likely why I went with this transformation to begin with in hindsight. But I watched in (admirably) fascinated horror as Sarah&#39;s cute face warped and bloated into the monsters hidius mug. Her jaw went wide and nose pressed flat. Jagged teeth merged with her lips as her head pressed flat, going from egg shaped to football. Her eyelids pulled back revealing beady black eyes that buldged from her sockets not unlike a lobsters. Her neck oriented upward as her spine began hump and curve. While watching the sight at some point I realized the bed had collapsed and Sarah had reached the size of a compact SUV! Her body swollen and covered in skin colored leathery flesh. Hairs that at this size started to look more like quills spattered across her limbs. Her head now finished resembled a cross between a bull dog and a slider, minus the mandible, 6 extra eyes, and chitin.  <br />
<br />
Still her body swells! I began to run back as I saw her final changes speed along with her growth. After I heard the sound of more furniture break I turned to watch more.<br />
<br />
Her torso had swollen larger now, her six legs lay before her each bigger then tree trunks. The hoof like nails big as dining tables. I couldn&#39;t even see the bed anymore. The bones of her ribs and shoulders looked like a dish, her head like a knob within it.<br />
<br />
Any features that distinguished her as female on her chest were gone. Come to think of it, did these things even have genders. Sarah was likely a &#39;them/they&#39; or given their monster status maybe a it was better suited. It was still Sarah though, so I stuck with &#39;her&#39;.<br />
<br />
From her barreling chest two growths pealed away. Thin spindally arachnid like arms curled up against her chest, cuddling air like her original arms once had. They hugged her body curled up like a mantis might fold its limbs in in itself when in waiting. <br />
<br />
Along her &quot;neck-dish&quot; (what else would you call it!) her sin seemed to boil as growths sprung up and out of ther skin, they reached further and further, stretching down her chest around her new claw-arms, down her belly all the way to her pelvis. The growths thrashed violently only once when they reached their final legth and formed a fleshy lion like mane that rested across the smashed remains of our frameless bedroom furniture. <br />
<br />
Her size was immense! Once she stopped she looked to cover 6 acres of space, most of it legs. It was hard to say how tall she might be in the empty white void, and I could never judge legth. I remember in the movie they seemed 3-4 stories tall, if not taller. Any number of factors could have come into play. When was the last time I even saw that move. Hell, for all I know I&#39;m remembering the wrong thing all togther.<br />
<br />
Sarah stired in her sleep, her redwood thick legs kicking air like a dog, only with the scraps of furniture being launched under her new strangth.<br />
<br />
As I watched the destruction she cause in just her sleep I though about weather this was a smart idea. It was amazing to see, but I also felt sick from the grotesque sight that I&#39;d turned my wife into. It almost felt cruel, never mind the fact I could, and had every intention of doing so. But that I took advantage of her vulnerability like this...<br />
<br />
For gods sake I was her husband! Trust, and honor, sickness and health n all that jazz.<br />
<br />
But were do you even start with all this? I looked at the ring, questioning my ethics in all this.</p>
