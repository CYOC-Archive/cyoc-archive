<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Looking at the suits you wonder about which to pick. There was a red, white, purple, pink, blue, green and yellow outfit, almost all of them being pretty similar with the red and white skin tight suits being the ones with highest difference. They didn&#39;t have a zipper but instead had some kind of fold that would presumably seal itself. Then again you weren&#39;t sure and they weren&#39;t really fitting in your mind. You kinda wanted to have some normal human clothes, not some revealing skin tight kink suit.<br />
<br />
You look at the costumes. None were really that appealing to you. You looked around more closely at the walls. since this was a wardrobe, there could be more choices in something like a closet. You noticed how the rooms walls had what looked like seams segmenting it at equal intervals. There were also some inbuilt handles or grips where you could try and push the panel open.<br />
<br />
Looking around you notice a rectangular recess in the floor under where most of the suits were hanging up and decided to open it to see what was inside. Pulling the drawer open you see what looks like a extremely holographic and reflective surface. Confused you think the drawer is empty, that is until you place your hand experimentally on the surface of the holographic mirror surface and realize it feels like a fabric material.<br />
<br />
Pulling the folded up suit out of the drawer you are shocked to see a full body suit with an attached hood that looked far more comfortable than anything else in the wardrobe even though it was extremely reflective and holographic. Looking at the ankles you realize the suit does not have attached heels like may of the other suits. Taking a look back in the drawer you see a pair of thigh high boots made of a similar holographic material.<br />
<br />
Taking the boots out you then slide into the suit which has a zipper on the back of the suit opposed to the front. You struggle for a little bit but eventually manage to get the zipper closed securing the hoodie like suit to your body. After you are done with this you then pull up the included boots over your legs which also have half a zipper on the rim. Looking at the bottom of the suit you see the other half of the zipper and secure the boots to the suit and zip them closed.<br />
<br />
&#39;what a strange suit&#39; you think to yourself but remark at how comfortable it is. As you start to stand up you then notice a light blinking on a display on the wrist. Taking a look you see a list with several options with symbols next to each option you cannot understand. Confused you press a random selection and suddenly the hood rises over your head and seals shut however you are still able to see out as if you are looking through a one-way mirror.<br />
<br />
Walking over to the mirror to see what you look like you are shocked to see that you do not have a reflection whatsoever. Looking down you also cannot see any part of your body at all. Curious you pick up one of the suits and hold it up as you stand in front of the mirror again and look in disbelief as you seemingly see the outfit floating in mid air with nothing holding it up. A grin starts to spread across your face as a idea pops into your head.<br />
<br />
Putting the suit back you then quietly tiptoe your way back to the cockpit where you see the lizard lady piloting the ship. Sneaking over to her you then tap her on the shoulder. Turning her head around to look at you she just stares in your general direction with a confused look on her face. She then says in a bemused voice &quot;oh hello there, did you find a suit you like?&quot; Confused you then drop the act defeated. &#39;How did you know i was here?&quot; you ask her and she smiles at you and says &quot;I&#39;m a reptile of course, i can see you with my heat vision&quot; she explains.<br />
<br />
Defeated she then stands up and walks over to you and presses a button on your control panel which opens the hood revealing your face but at the same time causes the suit to change shape sort of like a chameleon and after a short while you are aware of a slight breeze on your lags. When you look down you blush bright red as you see that you are wearing a typical Japanese schoolgirl uniform and your boots seem to have transformed into flats and you feel the ruffles of the skirt tickling your legs.<br />
<br />
You look at the lizard shocked and mutter &quot;how?&quot; she smiles at you and raising your wrist you see the same menu pop up only it seems to be floating above your wrist. She then clicks a few buttons and suddenly you can understand what the menu items say. &quot;sorry about that but i think you might find it easier to understand how the suit works if i change the menu language to English&quot; You thank her for that but then look at her confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;so what is this suit and how does it work?&quot; you ask her and she smiles back at you. &quot;this suit is a camouflage suit that can make you look like anything, including any race of human or alien you wish to disguise as as well as any outfit you can think of. It also has a invisibility feature for full stealth, but i see you already found that one. Do bear in mind however that this model is gender specific so it will only disguise you as the female gender of any race and cannot make you look male at all. It also is only cosmetic and if you ever take the suit off you will still be you on the inside&quot; she explains.<br />
<br />
&#39;Well that&#39;s a relief&#39; you tell yourself, &quot;So this can make me look like any female species i want in the galaxy?&quot; you ask her as she nods her head. You then get an idea in your head as you look through the options on the menu you see a scanner option. Clicking the option you then scan the lizard lady before pressing the confirm button, the hood then rises up and envelops your head completely as you take on the appearance of the lizard lady before you.<br />
<br />
You then look at her with a smug grin on your face &quot;oh I&#39;m a lizard lady looking to find a man to seduce my queen to continue our population, oopsie my faulty teleporter turned you into a girl so now you have to stay like this as i attempt to turn you back&quot; you then look at her fluttering your eyelashes mockingly at her. &quot;ha ha verry funny...&quot; the lizard girl says sarcastically as she rolls her eyes. You then select a new option exposing your head with the body of the lizard lady still as you laugh uncontrollably at her.</p>
