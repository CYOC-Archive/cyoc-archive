<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The Anderson family drove home from Moon Lake General Hospital in silence. Martha was behind the wheel, since William never had a chance before his death to take older son Nate to the local DMV to get his learner&#39;s permit.<br />
After parking in their driveway, securing the car, and going inside, Martha asked her sons, &quot;Who wants breakfast?&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not very hungry,&quot; answered Eric. &quot;Think I&#39;ll go upstairs and lie down for awhile if that&#39;s okay.&quot;<br />
&quot;Wouldn&#39;t you like to talk?&quot; wondered his mother.<br />
&quot;About what? Julie? Her reaction to me being a werewolf? The fact that I am a werewolf now instead of a were-merman?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well...&quot; began Martha.<br />
&quot;Mom, I know you mean well,&quot; said Eric. &quot;But I&#39;ve just about said all I can on this. Yes, Julie Stovall was my friend. Yes, I had feelings for her. Yes, I definitely liked her, but no, I wasn&#39;t at the point where I could say I was beginning to fall in love with her, or even actually in love with her. Could I have fallen in love with Julie? In time, maybe. I honestly don&#39;t know, but that&#39;s a moot point now. The only Eric Julie seems to recognize or wants is the merman I might of been, not the werewolf I am now.<br />
&quot;Yet I&#39;m happy with my decision,&quot; Eric went on. &quot;I know I made the right choice, both personally today and professionally for my future. Even Doctor Twist agreed with me. I know Austin, my new pack Alpha, called and confirmed that with her before he would even allow or schedule my induction ceremony. I sincerely hope Julie gets better. I even hope we can still at least be friends. Whether or not there will ever be more between us or not remains to be seen, but if there is, she will have to accept the lupine reality than her aquatic fantasy.<br />
&quot;If it was within my power, I swear to you I would go back in time and prevent that damn rogue from killing dad, but it ain&#39;t,&quot; said Eric as he began to cry. &quot;We&#39;ve got to move forward, and I&#39;m trying my best to do so, even with all the other stuff life&#39;s suddenly throwing at me with Julie and—&quot;<br />
Then he stopped himself, not wanting to think about <i>her.</i><br />
Instead, Eric wiped his tears the best he could with the back of his hand and said, &quot;Now please. I really need some time alone right now.&quot;<br />
Then he ran upstairs to his room.<br />
<br />
Martha Anderson turned to look at her older son. &quot;Nathaniel...&quot; she began.<br />
&quot;It has been a heavy night, for all of us,&quot; said Nate. He and Alex Ramsey had gotten together for a great time. They even had a &quot;date&quot; scheduled for tonight. Nate was beginning to embrace and enjoy his homosexuality, something he dared not express back in Minnesota. While becoming a Moon Lake were made his romantic life better, he still had not yet figured out how to &quot;come out&quot; to his parents, or parent now. Thanks to that damn rogue.<br />
&quot;I know sweetie,&quot; said Martha, hugging her son. &quot;If your father was still with us...&quot;<br />
&quot;I know mom,&quot; said Nate, trying his best to keep from crying.<br />
Between the life insurance William had and the fact that he took out debtor&#39;s insurance on their new Moon Lake residence (in case he lost this teaching position too because of his infidelities), which automatically paid off the mortgage once his passing was verified, the Andersons were getting by right now. Out of either sympathy or pity, the school district was giving Martha all the substitute teaching assignments she could handle until the opportunity to get recertified to become a full time teacher came next spring. Nate was hoping in time to find a part time job that he could work around his school schedule to help out, but all that was in the future.<br />
Right now, the present needed his attention more.<br />
&quot;Maybe Eric&#39;s right and we all need a nap. I&#39;ll see you later.&quot; Then Nate kissed his mom on the cheek and went upstairs.<br />
<br />
Martha stood in the living room. Thanks to the police and the cleaning service Samantha Twist recommended, the only clues as to this being where William Anderson made his last stand defending his family were his absence and the memories.<br />
With that, Martha grabbed a tissue from the box on the coffee table and began to cry. She thought about going upstairs, but there was too much of her husband in their bedroom, for the only things of his that she had managed to part with (so far) were the clothes he was buried in.<br />
She collapsed on the sofa and cried herself to sleep. That would be where the boys found her hours later when they finally came back downstairs to have something to eat.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
As Nate Anderson approached his room, he saw that the door to his brother&#39;s room across the hall wasn&#39;t completely shut. Taking the opportunity, Nate walked over and knocked on the door.<br />
&quot;Yeah?&quot; said Eric.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s just me. Can I come in?&quot;<br />
&quot;I guess.&quot;<br />
Nate entered and discovered that Eric had completely undressed and resumed his fursona before crawling into bed. The newest werewolf of Moon Lake was laying on top of his covers, staring at the ceiling when his brother came in.<br />
&quot;If you&#39;re here to talk about Julie some more...&quot; began Eric.<br />
&quot;No. I thought I&#39;d talk about something we haven&#39;t had a chance to yet. Eric Anderson&#39;s big night,&quot; said Nate, pulling his brother&#39;s desk chair closer to the bed before sitting in it. &quot;I&#39;m guessing you enjoyed it.&quot;<br />
&quot;Not counting the parts involving Julie Stovall, that&#39;s a serious understatement,&quot; admitted Eric, studying his paws. &quot;How was your first time?&quot;<br />
&quot;Great,&quot; replied Nate, thinking of Alex and fulfilling his lifetime fantasy of becoming a werewolf, while hoping Eric didn&#39;t press him for too many details. &quot;I see that except for Julie, you&#39;re adjusting well both mentally and physically to your new life.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, and I&#39;m sure every were feels this way, but changing is quite a rush,&quot; confessed Eric.<br />
&quot;It is, and don&#39;t worry. There&#39;s a lot of times I sleep in my lupine form too. I&#39;d just feel uncomfortable undressing in front of you before doing so though.&quot;<br />
&quot;I understand. Brothers, pack and otherwise, have to stick together,&quot; said Eric, holding out a paw, which Nate quickly shook. &quot;I certainly looked more different in my human form than I thought I would.&quot;<br />
&quot;Part of whatever you care to call it. Science, magic, or whatever. It improves you with and without fur,&quot; explained Nate.<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; replied Eric, while raising a leg to study. &quot;Have you ever seen a wolf with this fur pattern before?&quot; he asked, wondering about his new pelt.<br />
&quot;Can&#39;t say that I have,&quot; admitted Nate.<br />
<br />
&quot;She said I was quite dashing and handsome.&quot;<br />
&quot;She who?&quot;<br />
&quot;Cassie O&#39;Sullivan,&quot; replied Eric. Nate couldn&#39;t help noticing that his younger brother&#39;s lupine red rocket stirred in its sheath a bit at the mention of her name as Eric&#39;s tail started to wag. Then Eric turned on his side to face Nate directly. &quot;If I ask you a question, provided you actually know, do you promise to give me a straight answer.&quot;<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; swore Nate.<br />
&quot;The only thing I ever had a chance to tell Austin on the subject of who I wanted to be with was female. Why did Ben pick Cassie specifically to...&quot;<br />
&quot;I do know,&quot; admitted Nate, &quot;but in light of current events, I&#39;m not sure how you&#39;re going to react to the answer.&quot;<br />
&quot;Only one way to find out,&quot; said Eric, with a toothy grin on his muzzle.<br />
&quot;Okay, but understand two things before I continue,&quot; began Nate. &quot;One, I didn&#39;t know about this until I asked Ben the same question late last night, and two, that no one foresaw in advance exactly how badly Julie would actually react to all this. But Ben did foresee the possibility of Julie not liking your new lupine nature in general, so... when he chose the lucky lady to welcome you into werewolf society, he also decided to play matchmaker.&quot;<br />
&quot;WHAT?&quot; said Eric, sitting up and facing his brother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Think about it,&quot; suggested Nate, as he started listing the comparisons. &quot;You&#39;re both very smart 14 year old Freshmen who are also werewolves. You&#39;ve both recently lost your fathers and have decided to dedicate yourselves to helping others after graduating high school.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah. Cassie told me she currently has a 3.9 GPA like me and wants to be a doctor because her father died in a car crash,&quot; revealed Eric.<br />
&quot;Knowing Ben, I&#39;m sure you two have other things in common as well, but I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t know those off the top of my head. Besides, look at it this way. Whatever happens, I know dad would want you to be happy on and off duty, regardless of whatever you decided to do professionally. After all, even the best of those on any police force aren&#39;t on duty 24/7. Even doctors aren&#39;t on call 24/7.&quot;<br />
&quot;Hmmm....&quot; was all his younger brother said.<br />
&quot;Even if there wasn&#39;t all these new obstacles to overcome, if things don&#39;t work out with Julie after all, did you want to be single and alone the rest of your life?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well...&quot;<br />
&quot;All I&#39;m saying is if things don&#39;t work out with Julie and the opportunity arises with Cassie, think about it,&quot; suggested Nate.<br />
&quot;Promise you can keep a secret?&quot; asked Eric.<br />
&quot;Always,&quot; swore Nate, thinking about the ones he already had.<br />
&quot;I already have been,&quot; revealed Eric, before he was unable to suppress a yawn. &quot;I really do need to take that nap.&quot;<br />
&quot;Me too. Sweet dreams little brother,&quot; said Nate, before going on to his own bedroom.<br />

AFTERWARD: DIMENSIONAL DIFFERENCES<br />
In the Moon Lake of Earth-1 story thread, William Anderson survived rogue werevixen Yvette Smith&#39;s assault on his household to claim &quot;her fox&quot;.<br />
After that, Nate found the courage to come out to his parents that he&#39;s gay and seriously dating Alex Ramsey; while Eric truly fell in love with Julie Stovall and became a were-merman.<br />
On Earth-3, Nate and Alex&#39;s relationship is still just in the early stages, so Alex wasn&#39;t there during Yvette&#39;s fatal attack that resulted in William&#39;s death, and you&#39;ve seen how that event has affected the Julie Stovall/Eric Anderson relationship.<br />
The Marthas on both Earths were suppressing their bi nature, but it was Yvette making William a werefox against his will that was the catalyst for Martha to embrace both her bi side and as well as Samantha and Frances Twist on both Earths.<br />
What the current status of the Martha/Twists relationship at the moment post William&#39;s death on Earth-3 is remains to be seen.—tmw.</p>
