<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Pictures were always part of family life, and over time the only thing that really changed was how the picture was taken. When it was only through an artist painting or drawing a model, this had often become pricy and thus kept lower class people from having family pictures taken. But as things like the camera were invented and became more affordable, things related to pictures became more and more common. There would be photos of family members sitting together. There would be photos of friends or of events, and they would often decorate family walls and filled albums. It also served to create careers for models to pose for advertisements, and these often grew in popularity as people bought goods based on those advertisements or reviewers reported on a craze over the fashion being worn.<br />
<br />
And this was something that many Animalians caught on to. Those that had families liked their families and many also recognized the positive attention they often got, and given the higher Animalian libido, this then often lead to many willfully engaging in some things that might otherwise be considered &quot;questionable&quot; or risqué. But this all proved good for business and Animalians had also proven to be independent minded enough that if someone gave attention that was unwanted, that they weren&#39;t so controlled by their libidos that they couldn&#39;t reject offers that were unwanted. And this in turn made things like the &quot;Mother&#39;s Day Photoshoot&quot; possible and workable. The shoot would range from tasteful and family focused pictures to those that could be borderline risqué, all depending on those that signed up for it. There was some gossip that some of these photos were likely to be more presents for husbands than for the mothers, and in one particular case, that was precisely what it was.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m still surprised you&#39;re wanting to do this,&quot; Tiffany said as she pulled up into the parking area to the building where the Mother&#39;s Day Photoshoot was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on,&quot; her mother said back with a smile, &quot;it&#39;ll let me spend some time with the daughter I gave birth to and set up something that will then complete Mother&#39;s Day... for me at least. Something that will get your father excited, and we can have our own celebration privately after dinner.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Isn&#39;t Mother&#39;s Day supposed to be something that children do with their parents?&quot; Tiffany asked back.<br />
<br />
&quot;It can be,&quot; her mom smiled back from the passenger seat, &quot;but your father has always been proud that I am your mother. And we&#39;re having a grand time now, aren&#39;t we?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tiffany only shook her head and then nodded. To some degree, she figured her mother, even as a Human had a libido that was on par with an Animalian&#39;s and that had been partially why she had been able to get away with being &quot;promiscuous&quot; back when she was in high school. If the two of them had met as friends in high school, Tiffany privately figured that she and her mother might actually enjoy some of these things, but they hadn&#39;t, and Tiffany was a mature double dosed Animalian and her mother was a mature and older woman. Her mother wasn&#39;t so old that sex was unhealthy for her, but that didn&#39;t necessarily mean that Tiffany wanted to be there for these sorts of discussions or specific activities. It was also something that made her miss Princess.<br />
<br />
The two of them had gone through UNLV successfully with Tiffany majoring in business and economics while Princess majored in education and minored in physical education. After their college graduation there were options to stay together and through the summer they did, but Princess had also tested to gain her certification in Nevada, Arizona, and California, which wasn&#39;t easy and now was a health/PE teacher at an Arizona middle school and was on the staff for the high school&#39;s volleyball team in the same district and was the head coach for the middle school team. It left Tiffany to hear about frustrations with parents, problem kids, and things like that, but she also stated that teaching PE was easier and had fun during the volleyball season as a coach. It also included that small town this school was in did have some opportunities for some of the business ideas Tiffany had contemplated getting into after college. <br />
<br />
She thanked Princess but admitted she did want to wait for Riley to graduate later in May before getting into that. And that was a big thing. May was starting and the end of the school year wasn&#39;t that far off, but most colleges and high schools, including WSA, didn&#39;t have their school years end until about a week or so after Memorial Day, toward the end of the month. Riley might graduate a bit before the lower classmen ended their school year, that still meant that Tiffany would have to wait a bit before being able to catch up with Princess in person and see how Princess had been doing with Marvin. In the meantime, she&#39;d been helping with some of her father&#39;s endeavors in Lyre/Animalia and waiting for Riley to graduate. Today, was a day with her mother, who wanted to be part of this photo shoot.<br />
<br />
Thankfully, the shot was not at the Meat Market, which would have really made Tiffany uneasy, but getting use of the main floor area at the Claw Coliseum wasn&#39;t easy and came with a fair amount of engineering to make sure all of the photos and images would not have the stands behind them. Tiffany escorted her mother to the locker room where the women that were in the shoot were getting changed. With the exception of her mother, all of the others were Animalians though. Her mother happily whistled as she found an empty locker and proceeded to get changed. The others didn&#39;t pay too much notice, though they did note that Tiffany&#39;s mother was Human.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what do you think, will this drive your father wild?&quot; her mother asked while turning to hold out a black nightie that was practically see through in places, and was something that was designed to gather attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure it will,&quot; Tiffany answered. Knowing that while her father wasn&#39;t quite as &quot;active&quot; as her mother might what, he was still healthy enough of being capable of doing so, as well as knowing that her parents had generally had a rather happy marriage. She had no reason not to think that he wouldn&#39;t like seeing his wife in the nightie that was likely made to be taken off. The only thing she didn&#39;t like was a day that was normally something more &quot;family oriented,&quot; but this was what her mother wanted to do and to honor it, Tiffany was there.<br />
<br />
They then carefully made their way along the route until they came into the main area where the photos were being taken. Tiffany followed as the photographers blinked at the Human woman that came in ahead of her. Tiffany&#39;s mother introduced herself to them, stated her relation to Tiffany.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you&#39;re to be in the photo together?&quot; the photographer asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh NO!&quot; Tiffany cut him off, &quot;I&#39;m not posing with my mother in something designed to attract someone&#39;s attention...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No to mention that this is also to be something to encourage her father for some fun tonight,&quot; her mother added, &quot;I would hope that he would not be physically attracted to his own daughter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I... see...&quot; the photographer said slowly and looking between Tiffany and her mother, clearly looking puzzled.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is all part of some mother and daughter time,&quot; Tiffany&#39;s mother said with a smile, &quot;we are starting with something that will provide for a close to the day and celebration. After that... we will go to lunch.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; the photographer answered. <br />
<br />
He then gestured to the couch that was set up for the pictures. Tiffany walked around to a spot that would be behind the spot where the photographer and the others would be while her mother moved over to the couch. Being there for these pictures wasn&#39;t easy, but the fact that they would go to lunch after, did make Tiffany&#39;s tail wag with some happiness.</p>
