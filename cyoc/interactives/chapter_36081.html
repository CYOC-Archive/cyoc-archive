<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Having shoved the Amulet of Zulo into his pocket when he had ducked into the loading dock, Keith ran his hand over it as he wandered through the clothes department. He wondered briefly how Miss. Punnit was doing, seeing as she was the only person he'd ever gotten along with. Looking about, he eventually decided that he did not want to be older, nor did he want to be female. He'd seen how all the girls acted at school and did not want to be forced into that situation, nor grow up to become like that.<br />
<br />
Wandering into the children's section, he picked up a pair of underwear he figured would fit a five to six year old. On them where pictures of cartoon characters from the hit series Pokemon. Deciding these would do, he was just about to purchase them, when he thought, &quot;Why should I return home to transform myself? My parents wouldn't understand and I'd probably get a beating from Father for buying this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Turning about, he made his way back to the section were he'd found the underwear. Looking about, he selected a shirt with a picture of Mew on the front, a white coat, a pair of jeans, some socks and a pair of shoes that lit up when you pressed hard enough on the heel.<br />
<br />
He was making his way up to the front of the store when he saw Miss. Punnit again. Waving, she gave him a strange look and returned his wave. At the front, he made his purchase and walked out the front, only to duck back in. Seeing no one was watching, he made his way across the department store and into one of the changing rooms. <br />
<br />
Inside, he removed his coat and hung it on the door, covering the mirror. Setting his purchases down on the bench, he then proceeded to remove all the tags. Finished, he then removed the amulet from his pocket. Looking at it, he marveled at the design printed on the front and then slipped it on around his neck. Next, Keith began to undress himself.<br />
<br />
Looking at the clothes, he wondered what he should touch it too and finally settled on the shirt. Lifting the piece of jewelry, he touched the medallion to the shirt, a blue spark jumped from the amulet to that shirt and back. Then the blue spark jumped to him and disappeared into his chest.<br />
<br />
At first he was scared that this was nothing more then a bit of static electricity and nothing would happen. But then a sense of vertigo washed over him and he began to rapidly shrink. What little muscle mass he had built up rapidly disappeared and was replace by baby fat. He watched first in amazement as his penis and testicles regressed backward and then in horror as they continued to shrink and disappear up into his body.<br />
<br />
As an odd sensation crept over his groin and abdomen, one he thought might have to do with his insides rearranging themselves, all he could think was, &quot;Shit! Someone must have left a shirt from the girls section in the area for boy's clothes.&quot; as the area between his legs split open and the privates started to grow in a new location.<br />
<br />
His thoughts on how irresponsible people could be were distracted as he felt a tickling sensation as his hair grew outward. &quot;Guess I'll have to be female for at least twelve hours and then try again,&quot; She thought morosely.<br />
<br />
Realizing the changes had finished, Keith looked down and beheld the spectacle of looking at flat skin instead of a penis and testicles. Picking up the shirt from were he dropped it, he pulled it on over her head. Looking at the underwear, she hesitated and than finally made up her mind and pulled them on as well. Sitting down on the cold floor, she then pulled on the socks, followed by the pants. Next she fumbled with the shoes and eventually managed to tie the laces. Pulling on the jacket, she noticed that the pants, shoes and underwear were ill fitting. Figuring it was because they where meant for a boy, she sighed and pushed her old coat aside to gaze into the mirror.<br />
<br />
Looking back was an exact replica of her former old self. &quot;It's like looking at a computer program that could show what you'd looked like at five combined with the option of had you been born the opposite sex,&quot; she reasoned.<br />
<br />
Figuring it would have to do, she wondered what she should do and where she'd could live for the next twelve hours. Reaching up, she turned the handle of the changing room. Stepping out, she was just closing the door, when a familiar voice said from behind her, &quot;I think you'd better come with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Turning, she found herself looking up at the face of her former babysitter, Miss. Punnit.</p>
