<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After the night for Halloween, seeing the end of drama over Harry and Jennifer Jenkins&#39; wedding, the Halloween dance that for some had its own drama, and the standard pranks by the Skulk, for many there was hope for a quiet Sunday morning and letting things move toward a quiet future. In the pool at the Stovalls, Martin Stovall awoke as the first rays of light began to stretch over Moon Lake and were filtered down into the pool. He and his wife Melissa had gone to the Halloween Dance after he&#39;d checked on a few things at City Hall, and essentially giving Eric and Julie the time to make their entrance at the dance on their own. At that time, things had been quiet and he looked forward to dancing with his wife and perhaps enjoying some Halloween candy...<br />
<br />
However, neither of them ended up staying for very long. After going for a drink of punch, Martin found himself growing extremely aroused, and more than he normally felt around his beautiful blond haired wife. The pair of them probably would have returned to the Stovall family&#39;s pool for some one on one loving, as Moon Lake&#39;s were population was very relaxed regarding sexual matters. It had accepted same sex couples before any other town in the country did, and given the much higher libido that weres had and the fact that a young were&#39;s first transformation could be uncomfortable, Moon Lake had been very open with regard sexuality and so on. However, what Martin had felt was physically stronger than anything he&#39;d felt before, which then lead to taking Melissa home and the two of them jumping into the pool, where they stayed until their daughter and her fiancée returned to the pool as well. <br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t long after that Eric and Julie were engaged in very sexual acts as well. For most parents, seeing their one and only child, and one who was fourteen and female besides, would be unnerving and would immediately trigger &quot;stop this&quot; instincts. And to a certain extent, even Martin hoped that Eric and Julie could have waited longer, but he had been born a were, he had grown up in Moon Lake, and he knew just how easily a were could be aroused, particularly with one they loved. In this, Moon Lake generally tolerated young weres being together, provided both consented, and Martin had to accept that. His little girl was growing up and had found her one true love. He couldn&#39;t deny her her happiness with the man she loved. The only place where he would make a stand would be on Julie staying on her weremer birth control pill, as he didn&#39;t want to have to deal with any surprise pregnancies.<br />
<br />
As Martin&#39;s eyes fluttered open with the coming light rising over Moon Lake, he felt his wife Melissa Stovall in her stage two form beside him. He made a small glance and looked over to find both Eric and Julie in their stage three forms sleeping not too far away from them. He then smiled as he could see Eric&#39;s arms wrapped around Julie and holding her lovingly, in much the same way he&#39;d often held Melissa. In that Martin, knew that his daughter would be happy in life. However, those sorts of concerns didn&#39;t last very long as Martin soon felt another urge and one he needed to answer quickly. He carefully removed his arm from behind Melissa&#39;s head and neck, being as careful as possible not to disturb her, and once that was done he made his way out of the pool.<br />
<br />
Once out of the pool, he picked up a towel that Melissa had brought out the previous night before jumping in and hastily began to dry himself off. After getting the water rubbed off of him, Martin quickly headed inside, with getting to the bathroom in time on his mind. As he made his way, he passed a counter in the kitchen where his phone presently sat. He vaguely remembered setting it down there as he and Melissa made their way out to the pool the previous night. The trail of clothing from the garage door to the kitchen entry soon confirmed that. Martin grabbed the phone and continued on to the bathroom. As he reached the bathroom, he found that there were some messages on his phone, with one of them being from Samantha Twist. He flipped through with his thumb on his free hand to play the message.<br />
<br />
His phone soon played Samantha&#39;s message, &quot;I&#39;m sorry to trouble you Martin, but we have a problem and one we really need to handle... and handle soon. I&#39;m sure you&#39;re aware of the issues related to the law enforcement manhunt for Dymixious Drake, but things need to be updated as there have been some developments on that front. Apparently the man had Akane no Tachibana&#39;s number on a private yacht or something that they found. The FBI has already called Akane as a result of this, and I&#39;m certain that they&#39;ll probably send someone to deal with that matter personally. In that, we need to have a plan regarding the man. So long as they&#39;re looking outside Moon Lake, he doesn&#39;t pose a threat to exposing our secrets, but if they come here... Then things could be seriously troubled. We&#39;ll need to meet at eight AM tomorrow to make sure we have plan together, be it to either hand Dymixious over or try to explain his connection to Akane no Tachibana to the FBI in a way that WON&#39;T encourage them to ask more questions. Please respond as soon as you can.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that the message ended. Martin soon double checked the time and saw that it was nearly seven AM. He&#39;d have time to get ready, but he&#39;d need to hustle. However, he did manage to do the one thing he could and that was send a call to Samantha. With his business in the bathroom finished, he dialed as he walked to get some fresh clothes on. A semi-tired female voice answered very quickly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re a bit late in answering my call, sir,&quot; Samantha Twist spoke with a slightly humorous tone, but Martin could detect her private feelings of frustration on the issue.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t get to your message earlier,&quot; Martin said weakly, &quot;Let&#39;s just say that something had me far more in the mood than I expected to be last night. I know you and Frances left the dance before I did... but between all the music and so on...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not hearing it ring is understandable,&quot; Samantha spoke, &quot;anyway, we DO need to handle this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right,&quot; Martin nodded, &quot;and you were right to call me and call for a meeting on this. I trust...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Everyone in the city&#39;s executive branch has been called and agreed to attend the meeting,&quot; Samantha answered, &quot;Akane also said she would attend since this situation does have direct connections to her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very good,&quot; Martin sighed, &quot;I&#39;ll be there... and again... sorry about not getting back to you sooner.&quot;<br />
<br />
And he was sorry about that. He couldn&#39;t quite explain how or why he&#39;d gotten as horny as he did. He just knew that he was incredibly aroused and the only relief would be to take his wife home and pleasure her until they couldn&#39;t stop. He remembered her wanting to talk about something, but not getting the chance to. His thoughts drifted to this as he hung up and moved to get dressed. He&#39;d just put on a clean pair of underwear when he&#39;d heard his wife&#39;s voice come from the doorway to their bedroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Work? On a Sunday?&quot; Melissa Stovall asked him, concern evident in her voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Something&#39;s come up,&quot; Martin nodded, &quot;Normally we don&#39;t have anything going on on a Sunday... but when something DOES come up, we do have to respond to it.&quot;<br />
<br />
He looked over to see his wife wrapped in a town with her long hair stilling looking a bit wet and clinging to her head, neck, and shoulders. Normally, he&#39;d be drawn to fully dry her hair and be close to her, but with this situation brewing, he didn&#39;t have much in the way of time.<br />
<br />
&quot;I need to be at City Hall by eight,&quot; Martin spoke, &quot;Hopefully, I can let you know AFTER all this dies down... but right now, I need to get going. I trust you can make sure that Eric and Julie get their homework done.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can,&quot; Melissa answered and gave an inward sigh. She&#39;d wanted to talk to him about their ideas on children. Both of them had agreed to wait until after Julie was independent before expanding the Stovall family again, but as Julie had fallen in love and was feeling many of the same feelings Melissa felt around Martin, that got Melissa wondering on maybe upping the planned schedule with regard to that. In fact she&#39;d planned to talk to Martin about it during or after the dance, as Julie might like having a brother or sister, but in the end, Martin had been so aroused by something at the dance that Melissa never got the chance to raise that point of conversation or even take her weremer birth control pill.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Samantha hung up her cellphone shortly after Martin had hung up with a slightly heavy sigh. The werecat had managed to wake up before her wife did and had also managed to leave their king sized bed without disturbing Frances. That was something that Samantha felt her wife deserved. After all, Frances had done a lot to reassure Samantha over the issue that related to the coming meeting over the whole Dymixious Drake issue. It was a stressful situation and one that would be difficult, but Samantha felt she could power through it, especially with Frances&#39;s support and love.<br />
<br />
However, she couldn&#39;t bring Frances to the meeting and so Samantha decided to let her wife sleep in. She got up early, changed back to human form, got dressed and had been working on a quick breakfast when Martin called her. Thankfully, he called her cellphone and not the house phone, as that would have woken Frances up. Hopefully the meeting would go quickly and the situation with Dymixious would be handled quickly and she could return to her wife and they could look for a quiet day together or maybe visit with Martha and fully see how their pride mate and sister werecat had enjoyed her first Halloween as a were, but getting through the meeting came first.<br />
<br />
The one thing that she felt a bit &quot;concerned&quot; on was where Ben was, as he hadn&#39;t returned after the Halloween Dance, but then he had left with Kenya and was likely with her. And since it was a weekend that wasn&#39;t too much of a concern. True, she and Frances preferred that Ben did return home even on a Saturday night, but for today, Samantha figured to let that pass, should Dymixious fight against arrest if that was the decision the meeting would make. The situation with Ben would only be a concern if Ben didn&#39;t return by evening so he&#39;d be ready for school on Monday, but for the moment, that wasn&#39;t a major concern.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hopefully Kenya and her family don&#39;t mind having him over as a guest,&quot; Samantha thought to herself as she finished her breakfast and thought of the wereleopard/panther that Ben had met and been dating.<br />
<br />
Of course, Samantha couldn&#39;t really tell for certain what Kenya and her family did on Sundays. Moon Lake had nearly every Christian denomination present and there were a few weres that were rather religious in nature. As while Moon Lake tended to look preachers who preached gloom and doom with some degree of suspicion, that did NOT mean they didn&#39;t approve of concepts like forgiveness and the base tenants that Christianity was founded on, but then normal services didn&#39;t start until later in the morning. Some weres followed football and some might even have work, as Samantha happened to have this particular Sunday morning. As she prepared to head out for the meeting, she hoped that wherever Ben was, he was safe and he behaved himself.</p>
