<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next few days were weird for Sarah. As the man had said she saw no improvement in the first few days. In fact things had got worse if anything. Howard did nothing around the house, and only created a bigger problem when he was at home then he was before. Another thing that she had noticed was that they hadn&#39;t had sex since they started taking the pills. Normally they had sex almost every other day. But it had been five now and if anything she thought Howard wasn&#39;t attracted to her anymore. But still she continued hiding the pills in his food and she kept on taking hers. Even if the pills didn&#39;t do as they were supposed to she still enjoyed taking them. They made her feel more relaxed and they made jobs around the house easier.<br />
<br />
They went about their lives how they would have normally. Just with things slowly getting worse for Sarah but slowly improving as well. Howard was oblivious to any thing going on in fact only Sarah noticed any change at all.<br />
<br />
Things were definitely different during that first week but not bad or uncomfortable for the two of them. It was when the second week started that Sarah really noticed things happening.<br />
<br />
They woke up on a regular Monday and started to get ready for work. Howard put his clothes on, Sarah put her clothes on and they both drove to work. On the way there, from out of nowhere a police officer pulled them over. He said that Howard had been doing fifty in a forty zone. He went through the usual, breathalyzer, walking the line. All checked out as fine but unfortunately, the officer still put three points on his license. Now Howard wasn&#39;t a great driver and already had ten points on his license, so with the police officer putting the three points on his license he had exceeded the limit of twelve and had his license revoked.<br />
<br />
Sarah was appalled. Now she had to drive him everywhere. She couldn&#39;t do that, she needed time to herself. She couldn&#39;t drive him everywhere.<br />
<br />
She had to drive them the rest of the way. The whole way neither of them said anything they just concentrated on driving and getting to work.<br />
<br />
They got to the laboratory where they both worked and went to their respective offices everything was as normal. Until Howard asked to meet her in the hallway. She left her lab and went out to the hall Howard was their crying.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, sweetie what&#39;s wrong?&quot; She asked him as she gave him a hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sarah, I just got laid off,&quot; he said deftly.<br />
<br />
&quot;What, oh no why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They hired a new guy and apparently he&#39;s already better than me. You know that equation I&#39;ve been trying to figure out for a month?&quot;<br />
<br />
She nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah he solved it in ten minutes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh honey I&#39;m so sorry, maybe you can find a new job, you&#39;ve been talking about quitting for a while now any way. So give it a shot.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, Sarah, ill try.&quot;<br />
<br />
At that point Sarah was tempted to stop the process, but then she realised. She needed a change now more than ever. If Howard was ever going to get back on his feet he needed to be more mature. He needed to take care of him self for once. So that night she grated up another pill into his lasagne and made sure he ate all of it. <br />
<br />
Everyday from then on things got worse. Howard no longer slept with Sarah at all out of shame. Instead he set up a bed in the guest room and he slept in there. He also stopped hugging and kissing her by his own free will. It was only when she asked him to do it. It was the same time when things started to physically change. <br />
<br />
About two weeks into the process things started randomly appearing around the house. For example, Sarah&#39;s entire closet changed over night. Not that she was complaint as all the clothes fitted her fine but it was just that. They weren&#39;t hers. She liked them all but she was uncertain as to where they came from or why they were there. <br />
<br />
A few more things started randomly appearing and disappearing. Whether it was clothes furniture or something else, they all appeared. Whether it was wanted or not. <br />
<br />
Half way through the second week and Howard still hadn&#39;t got a job and still hadn&#39;t helped around the house. This was when they started changing.<br />
<br />
Sarah woke up one morning on what she assumed to be a regular day. She got out of bed and went to go take a shower. As she was cleansing her self she couldn&#39;t help but notice that her nipples looked darker and her breasts looked larger. In fact she felt taller all over but her breasts had grown significantly.<br />
<br />
She finished in the shower and went to go get changed. She put on her underwear and her bra, which looked different for some reason. Perhaps it was larger or something. Even though it fit her just fine. Then she put on a flowery undershirt and a red skirt which reached her knees. Then she put on one of her cardigans, she chose a nice blue one that went well with her skirt. Finally she put on a pair of dark nylons to cover her otherwise bare knees and shins. She went to prepare breakfast for her self and Howard. She decided to bring him breakfast in bed. <br />
<br />
She walked into his room with a tray full of pancakes, bacon and orange juice. But almost dropped it as what she saw shocked her.</p>
