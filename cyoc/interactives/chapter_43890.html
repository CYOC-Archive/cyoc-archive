<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I spent the first hour returning to the mirror to check I wasn't dreaming. This turned out to be a mistake as the more I looked at myself, the more the reflection in the mirror turned me on. My erections came on faster now each time I looked and took longer to fade away. I was tempted to sort them out properly but my wife's threat stopped me. Did she have hidden cameras?<br />
<br />
I went back downstairs and tried to get on with something to take my mind off what was happening. Unfortunately, my erection had become pretty stubborn and strangely, I felt pretty embarrassed standing there with the front of my skirt sticking out.<br />
<br />
In the afternoon, I got a call from my wife. She spoke as if nothing was unusual at all. She asked whether I had got dressed. She asked whether I had been good and only worn what I had been allowed. She told me that she would find out if I was cheating. I reassured her I was being good as I didn't know what else to say. Then she dropped the bombshell. I was to pick her up at a meeting in Manchester at 4.00pm. She had left the car at work in Glossop. It was a 20 minute train journey after a 15 minute walk to th estation and a 20 minute walk in Glossop through the town. She told me that she expected me to follow the &quot;rules&quot; regardless of the embarrassment. This was obviously the no underwear rule and the no playing with myself. <br />
<br />
Half an hour before leaving, my erection had still not subsided. I thought that she couldn't possibly mean for me to walk through busy towns and ride a train with a tent in my skirt. I decided I would have to deal with it. I was still worried she may have rigged up cameras so I went to the shed at the bottom of the garden, she wouldn't have rigged up cameras there. The shed has glass pannels on the doors and is overlooked by the neighbours windows so I was unsure how to do this. If my skirt was lifted up, I might bee seen through the glass but at a distance, I though I might get away with a quick wank if I did it through my skirt. I did this and was nearly overcome by the surge of excitement it produced. A wank had never been this good before. After a very short time my penis exploded its load into my clothes. After a couple of minutes I recovered realising I had made a mess of my skirt. I went back into the house, not needing to hold myself down thankfully. Whwn I got to the bathroom. I lifted my skirt and cleaned up the mess in my petticoats the best I could.<br />
<br />
I left for the station. It was really unnerving for a start but thankfully, I didn't have any erection problems after that my wank. By the time I got to the station, I was almost feeling confident. I was a woman, why would anyone think I was a bloke in womens clothes. I got a couple of glances but these were at my face and my cleavage not at my manhood region. The walk through Glossp went without a hitch. I was starting to enjoy myself by the time I got to the car. It was so comfortable walking around in a skirt without underwear, even in public. I got to the car and arrived at the hotel in Manchester where I was to pick my wife up. At 4.00pm on the dot she arrived, got in and told me to drive. She didn't say a word and I started to get worried. I thought of why she was upset the whole journey. At a woodland 5 miles from home she told me to pull into a parking space and get out. She moved to the driving seat and talked to me through the window.<br />
<br />
&quot;Take your skirt off&quot;, she said. She said it in such a way, I didn't want to argue. If she had spoken to me as a man, I would have argued I guess, but as a woman, I was suddenly submissive. I looked around, we were alone. I took my skirt off and stood in my petticoats.<br />
&quot;the belt too&quot;. She added. I took it off. <br />
&quot;hand them over!&quot;, she ordered. I did as I was told.<br />
<br />
&quot;EXPLAIN THAT!&quot;, she shouted pointing at the dried cum stain in my petticoats. How could I have been so stupid. How did she know. Then it struck me. I though I had been clever in going to the shed for a wank - no cameras there but then I cleaned myself up in the bathroom. How could I have been so thick!<br />
<br />
&quot;How did you know?&quot;, I asked.<br />
She was calm,&quot; I am watching you, I knew you couldn't be trusted. You will have to be punished&quot;.<br />
<br />
Stupidly, I just accepted this. She was the boss, I had no say anymore.<br />
<br />
&quot;Take this&quot;, she said handing me a small tablet, &quot;just swallow it&quot;. Was this the antidote? I took it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now put these on&quot;, she said handing me a pair of handcuffs. What did she have in mind. I put one cuff on and started the other. &quot;NO!&quot;, she called, &quot;behind your back&quot;. I reluctenly complied. What was I letting myself in foor. My confidence was shot standing in my cum stained petticoats with my hands stuck behind my back.<br />
<br />
&quot;That tablet you took is an impotance treatment. It's a sort of super viagra for people who want to be at it all night. You need to learn not to break the rules. The only way I can trust you not playing with yourself is to restrain you physically. Thats why you are wearing the handcuffs and why they are behind your back. Now your punishment is that I am going to leave you here without your skirt. This is a commomn spot for all the misfits and perverts who want to thrill themselves outside. You'll fit in perfectly. Of course you could choose to come home, it's only a five mile walk but in your petticoats and handcuffed and with a big erection sticking your petticoats out, it's going to be a walk of shame like no other. You're choice&quot;, she said.<br />
<br />
I couldn't speak. I just watched her, mouth gapping with disbelief, as she drove away leaving me there. This was bad, really bad. I looked at myself. If I had held on to the belt, I might have got away with the petticoats looking like skirts but they were just too flimsy and frilly and the thin elastic waistband gave it away. Worse still, my penis started stirring and after a few minutes, I had a stiffy like no other. Not so much excited but just physically hard and solid.<br />
<br />
I thought it through. I couldn't wait here to be buggered, abused or beaten up. I had to go home. But in my petticoats, my cum stained petticoats, my cum stained sticking out at the front from a twitchy erection petticoats, with hancuffs on at that! How the hell could I do it? I had no choice. I walked to the road - all clear. <br />
<br />
I started walking towards home. After a couple of hundered yards I saw my car. She was waiting for me - she was teaching me a lesson. I sped up to get to the car anothe rcar came from behind causing me to dart into the woods. I really didn't want to be seen. It passed and I was back on the road almost running now. This was so bloody embarrassing. Nearly there a car came towards me. Again I hid in the side. Too late, this time they saw me and slowed down some nasty letch hung out of the window and yelled something that wasn't pleasant and they hovered for a bit. I was stuck. Fortunately, they drove on when I wasn't coming out. I got back on the road, my car was just ahead when suddenly, the engine roared and off she sped leaving me behind screaming at her, the bitch.<br />
<br />
When I calmed down I walked on. It took a few minutes to realise that a car was following me crawling along about 50 yards back. I turned and saw them before realising I should be hiding. Shit, it was the car that passed earlier. I looked at the sides but the rad had big hedges preventing my escape into the woods. I started to run but they sped up and followed 10 yards behind me. After I ran out of breath, I knew I couldn't outrun them so I stopped. They weren't going away, they would find out my predicament soon enough. I turned and faced them making no attempt to hide my embarrassment. Two men got out, including the letch, and mockingly asked me if I was going their way and wanted a lift.<br />
<br />
&quot;No way&quot;, I retorted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tough, sweetheart&quot;, they replied, &quot;you're coming for a ride&quot;.<br />
<br />
Now I was scared.</p>
