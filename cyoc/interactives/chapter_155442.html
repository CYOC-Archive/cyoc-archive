<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Joe was visibly upset. The High School football team had lost another game. The team wasn’t great, but it was their quarterback who was just terrible. Joe walked up to Kevin, one of the other receivers on the team. <br />
<br />
“Man, we need a new Quarterback. Kyle can’t throw worth shit… His passes are either too deep, too short, or completely off! We lose so many opportunities to score!” he grumbled. “Not only that, but the coach chews us out because we’re not making our catches!” <br />
<br />
“What can we do, Joe? We don’t have anybody else!” Kevin sighed. “We need another guy who can throw the ball!” <br />
<br />
“Yeah, I know…” he groaned, as he walked over to the bench where the cheerleaders where. <br />
<br />
“Give me a T – I – G – E – R – S… Gooooooo TIGERS!” Madison cheered just as she hopped up to the bench where Joe was sitting and sat down next to the angry receiver, waving her pompons in front of his face as he removed his helmet. <br />
<br />
 “Hey, Joe! Don’t be so mad! It’s only a game!” she cheered. “Cheer up!” <br />
<br />
“Yeah, but this makes it four losses in a row…” he said with a deep sigh. “I should have joined the basketball team instead. We don’t have a good quarterback at all. We stink as a football team. I just wanna quit the team right now…” <br />
<br />
“Come on, let’s go do something fun… Get your mind off of football…” Madison smiled as she stood up and pulled on Joe’s uniform. <br />
<br />
The two ran over to the locker room. There was another storage room behind the locker room, that nobody ever used. Joe unlocked the door and turned on the lights. There were old blankets and an old mattress on the floor. The two teens jumped on the mattress and then cuddled for a few minutes. <br />
<br />
“Ohh… Joe… I feel funny…” Madison began, as she started to remove her clothes, all of them. <br />
<br />
“Hey, Maddie, I like you and all, but uhh… I wasn’t planning on doing this tonight, you know. Let’s just take it slow and see where this friendship takes us and…” Joe began, thinking Madison wanted to have sex with him. <br />
<br />
She removed her cheerleading uniform, her panties, her shoes, her bra… everything. Soon, she was standing before him, buck naked. Then, she closed her eyes and craned her neck back, letting out a loud groan. <br />
<br />
“Maddie? Madison? What are you doing? What’s happening?” Joe wondered, as her body started to tremble while she started to moan loudly.<br />
<br />
Then, her hair started to fall out, leaving her with much shorter hair on her head. Her short, slender legs suddenly began to grow with muscle as they grew much longer. Her calves inflated with raw muscle as her legs gained several inches. Her quads bulged with pure muscle as well, growing much thicker and wider along the way. Thick vertical columns of muscle began to swell up over her quads, forming thick teardrops of muscle above the knees. <br />
<br />
Her flat, thin stomach suddenly showed thick, rock hard abdominal muscles, which weren’t there moments before. She was becoming VERY muscular! Her torso widened as her flat chest started to inflate with big, wide, and very thick, bulging pectorals, ballooning from her chest like large, round orbs of muscle, separated only by a deep cleavage. Her breasts were replaced by large, thick pecs as her thin arms inflated with big, bulging triceps and biceps, making her arms seem twice as thick as before, since they were now also completely covered in an impressive network of veins! <br />
<br />
“Uhhhhhngggg!!!!” Madison moaned loudly as her backside grew twice as wide as before, with her shoulders expanding as mighty lats formed under her bigger arms. Huge traps and delts made up her upper body as well, as the impressive V-tape gave her that famous, coveted bodybuilder-look. <br />
<br />
Finally, her vagina closed and disappeared as a small stubble appeared at the center of her groin. The stubble grew into a thick, 9-inch long penis, with large egg-sized testicles hanging from the base. Madison was officially no longer a girl anymore, but a guy! <br />
<br />
“Joe…” he said now, in a much deeper voice. He walked up to Joe, standing 6 inches taller than the receiver. “Do you think you can teach me how to be a quarterback?” <br />
<br />
“Holy shit! Madison… You were a girl… You just turned into a GUY! You’re a DUDE!” Joe gasped, looking up at the former cheerleader. <br />
<br />
Madison now looked down and flexed his large biceps. <br />
<br />
“Yeah, look at me now, huh? I’m too big to be a cheerleader! I guess I’m big enough to be a player, right?” he said in a deep, baritone voice. <br />
<br />
“Yeah… Let’s… Let’s get you a uniform and we’ll get you out on the field with the rest of the team… I’ll have to introduce you to the coach and the rest of the team as a transfer student or something!” Joe pondered. “But we can make this work!” <br />
<br />
So, the cheerleaders were suddenly one member short during that following week. On the other hand, a new player showed up out of nowhere. This big, tall, athletic kid showed up out of the blue, and he asked to practice with the rest of the team. He was able to run, catch and throw. He completed all his passes and he made all his catches. He had impressed the coach enough to earn a starting position as quarterback for the next game. The team had already lost four games in a row, so the coach had nothing to lose by putting in a new quarterback! <br />
<br />
Game night came and Madison completed all his passes. The receivers made all the important catches and they scored on every possession. The Tigers beat their opponents 45-0 and it was a blow-out. <br />
<br />
Joe and Madison met in the locker room after the game. This time, when they went to the storage room, they just smiled. <br />
<br />
“Okay…. I know that, deep down, you’re still a girl, under those muscles and bones and that big body of yours…” Joe grinned as Madison removed his uniform. What remained was a big, tall, muscular high school athlete. He was 6-foot-9 inches tall and all muscle. This time, Joe wasn’t shy about getting in bed with Madison. He also removed his clothes. And the two young guys cuddled up together and made love. After all, they were on the same team. They had to work together from this point going forward, so what better way to get to know each other than this, right?</p>
