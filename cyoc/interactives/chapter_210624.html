<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tristan wasn&#39;t all that interested in computers, at least not like Rowan, Dennis and Marcus were. He knew enough to get by, had an email account, used a social media platform, and searched youtube for old music videos from the 80s and 90s. Beyond that, if he used a computer for anything, it was mainly to type up stuff using Pages or Microsoft Word, as well as whatever D&D stuff he needed off Rowan&#39;s laptop. Listening as Dennis asked, “What do you think I should change? Or do you want to try?” Tristan had already decided to let Dennis do whatever. Telling his friend he should give it go whilst they waited for Rowan to get back, the teenage boy wandered away.<br />
<br />
Quite aware of how his friend felt about computers, that because of it he didn&#39;t even own a mobile, Dennis shrugged and commented, &quot;Cool,&quot; and then, &quot;All right,&quot; before he cracked his knuckles like a pianist warming up.<br />
<br />
Not sure at first what he&#39;d alter, nor how it would exactly translate to a LARP character, he tapped and clicked through options. After some time, whilst Tristan started to check, fix, and update his character, Dennis reached for his character sheet. Drawing it to him, he read the information printed. Having played for all of the champaign a pure lycanthrope Elf who multi-classed in rogue and sorcerer, and was now at level seven, he thought about the backstory he&#39;d created.<br />
<br />
Drannor was an outcast amongst his people, had been since a young age. Now, at the age of 173, young for an Elf, really only a teenage if he&#39;d been human, he searched a way to remove the stain wrongly placed on his family name and reclaim his title. Thinking about this, Dennis thought that if he was going to LARP, he&#39;d wanted to try to play as Drannor. Setting his character down, he clicked and typed until he brought up his race. Searching through the options of mystical, he selected Elf. Checking to make sure the character&#39;s sex and gender was male, he entered a new height for himself, five foot five, six inches smaller than his current height, and a weight of a hundred and fourteen, down ninety-six pounds from his current weight.<br />
<br />
Finished with that, he began to make other alterations. He upped his dexterity to reflect the fourteen he written on the sheet, did the same with his strength, a sixteen on the sheet, set his health and constitution at the same as his dexterity, another fourteen, altered his intelligence and wisdom, a seventeen and an eighteen, the highest rolls he’d made, and last set his charisma so it came close to the eleven he&#39;d given himself. Scrolling through the rest of the stuff, he searched, pulled down menus, right-clicked, opened boxes, and after some time entered all the information that came close to the skills, feats, special abilities, and magick he&#39;d given Drannor.<br />
<br />
Satisfied he&#39;d done the best he could, Dennis added to the languages spoken, written and read English, there was no common listed, Elven, Dwarven, Sign Language, and the tongue of the wolf. Saving all the information, but not hitting the button marked “execute”, as he didn&#39;t know what it&#39;d do and wanted to wait, he turned his attention to the next thing that was needed for his character.<br />
<br />
A quick set of information entered, and he got the programme to recognise that he was werewolf who was in control of their change and not a slave to the moon. Adding that he&#39;d been able to control his change for almost a hundred years, he smiled and, as a joke, set that when he became the wolf, he turned in a bitch. Smiling at this, believing he was being clever, he entered a few more things, including that the wolf had blonde fur and grey eyes. Feeling he done everything he could, he made a last check over the information he entered, update and rearranged a few things, including setting the permanency option, making so he was only aware of the changes, and setting the discomfort level at its lowest. Failing to understand what he was actually doing, he saved the profile, and seeing Rowan was still not back, thought about turning the laptop over to Tristan, but, at the last minute, decided he wanted to see what the “execute” did. Clicking it, he was instantly overcome with the oddest sensation that washed through his body.<br />
<br />
He&#39;d had erections before, and had flogged his dong a number of times. But the instant the feeling settled into his groin, and he got what he considered was the worst hard on ever, Dennis couldn&#39;t help himself as he leapt up, muttered, &quot;Be right back,&quot; and, &quot;Your turn,&quot; as he hurried out the room before Tristan could say or notice his hasty departure.<br />
<br />
Down the basement hall, past Tristan&#39;s bedroom, Dennis headed for the bathroom. Feeling like he&#39;d blow his load before he could even do anything, he struggled to turn on the bathroom light, close and lock the door, and get his pants down. Grasping the erect shaft, he began to work it as he stepped closer to the toilet. Body temperature spiking, he missed it as his height dropped and he grew thinner. Barely managing to get the toilet lid and seat up, and a wad of toilet paper to catch his semen, Dennis thought he was done, but as his facial features started to take on more Elven looks, his body hair vanished, and the hair on his head lightened and shortened, Dennis soon found himself pumping his rod again as he fought to take off his shirt and kick off his shoes and socks.<br />
<br />
Soon naked as the day he&#39;d been born, Dennis didn&#39;t care the least. Working on the raging boner he had, amazed he&#39;d managed to let loose five times now, he flushed the toilet when he felt himself coming down off the euphoric feeling he felt every time he spewed a ropey, mucus white shot of semen. Taking a moment to breath deeply, he reached down and started to lower the seat and lid on the toilet, but stopped when he noticed his hand and arm was different.<br />
<br />
No longer hairy, and in the case of his hand, large, meaty, now the appendage and limb were small and clear of any body hair. Looking down, he had just barely enough time to realise the rest of his body had change, that he was slimmer, muscular without showing any muscles, hairless, before he doubled over. Wondering, &quot;What the hell,&quot; he placed his hands flat on the floor, arched his back, and tilting back his head, he opened his mouth with a silent gasp.<br />
<br />
The effects of the next change faster than the last one, it was more uncomfortable and didn&#39;t bring about the same results of making him horny. Instead, as his body cracked and rearranged itself, fur grew in itchy patches, Dennis squirmed and tried not to whimper as his face pushed out into a muzzle, whilst on the other end his tailbone extended. The final bit of blonde fur growing in as his eyes changed colour, the last thing to change was for his cock and balls to recede up into his body, reforming into a canine vulva. Finding the transformation was complete, Dennis shook himself and blinked. Scared by the sight of the paws that now made up his hands, the blonde fur that covered not his arms but his front legs, the muzzle he could see extending out from his face, Dennis whimpered. Finding it sounded very canine like, he began to turn in circles as he struggled to see the rest of him. Finding he not only was a wolf, but a bitch, just like he&#39;d entered, Dennis began to panic. Not wanting to be trapped the way he was, but to also warn Tristan and Rowan what the Chronivac did, he started to pace back and forth as he tried to figure out how not to be a wolf whilst at the same time how to let his friends know what had happened.</p>
