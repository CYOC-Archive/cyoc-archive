<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The plan was simple yet complicated. The girls would pretend to be Jennifer’s parents and invite both Jason and Lisa to their house on Wednesday evening. Talking to Jason and Lisa was easy enough but pretending to be the Bishops was another story. The girls came up with an idea on who could pretend to be Alexander Bishop. That idea was Shiro Who, despite his grumpiness, agreed with the request. Who could be Helen Bishop was another story entirely.<br />
<br />
Despite their best efforts the girls realized that none of them could pull off a convincing 40 year old adult. The girls now turned to Katie, knowing she had the ability to make them sound and look like adults. This too led to problems as it could mean telling Ashley and Jennifer about the ring. After much debate the girls realized that if they were going to pull this off they would need to tell them about the ring.<br />
<br />
“So let me get this straight,” Ashley stated. “Your telling me you can just magically make people older or younger?” Katie nodded sadly as the girls now sat at Samantha’s house. The group had decided to go to Samantha’s house because it was far enough away from both Jason and Lisa that they wouldn’t draw attention to themselves. The fact that both of Samantha’s parents happened to be working late and that she had the place to herself was another positive. “Yeah I can,” Katie sighed. “The girls all know and so does Shiro.”<br />
<br />
Jennifer now turned to face Shiro who looked uncomfortable. “How long have you know about this Shiro,” she asked. Shiro fidgeted as he searched for words. “Maybe a week,” he said. “To be honest I thought I was just losing my mind. That kind of thing shouldn’t exist. It’s....it’s just weird okay.”<br />
<br />
“Okay,” Ashley sighed. “Let’s say I believe this fairytale. What does that have to do with us?”<br />
<br />
Katie sighed as she looked at the group. No one was particularly happy about revealing this secret but understood it needed to be done. “Here’s the thing,” she said. “None of us really sound that adult okay. Shiro can pull off a good imitation of your dad but the rest of us...we...we just sound like a bunch of teenagers.”<br />
<br />
“WhatbKatie is trying to say,” Kellie added. “Is that we need Jennifer to pretend to be her mom.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t sound like my mom,” Jennifer stated.<br />
<br />
“Not now but maybe in 30 years you will,” Claudia said flatly.<br />
<br />
Ashley and Jennifer gave each other looks of concern as they began to understand what they were saying. “So,” Jennifer gulped. “You..you want to make me 46!!!” The girls nodded as Ashley and Jennifer now gaped at each other. “I, I don’t know about this. Ash I need to sit down.”<br />
<br />
“Look,” Mika said. “It’s temporary and we only need you to be that old for a couple of minutes. Just long enough to convince Lisa to come over. We promise to change you back immediately.”<br />
<br />
“They will change you back,” Shiro said. “They did to me.”<br />
<br />
Jennifer’s eyes bulged as she looked at Shiro. Still trying to grasp the fact that Katie and her friends had magical abilities. As she looked at the girls she could see the grave and pleading looks on their faces. Sighing she now stood and looked at them all. “Okay,” she muttered. “I’ll do it.”<br />
<br />
The girls sighed in relief as Katie now stood. “Okay so we’re going to do this,” she said. “Everyone ready?”<br />
<br />
The group nodded in unison as Katie now stood in front of Jennifer. Shiro instinctively slid out of the way, guiding Ashley away as well while Jennifer held her breath and closed her eyes. “I wish Jennifer was 40 years old.”<br />
<br />
Jennifer gasped as the tingles enveloped her body. The girls stared as Jennifer began to age into adulthood. The slim figure of her teens was quickly replaced by the curves of her twenties. Ashley went slack jawed as she watched her friend speed through adulthood in minutes. The blond girls curves filled as her breast size increased. As she hit thirty the group could see that Jennifer was an attractive woman with full hips, d cup breasts, long blond hair and a mature face. As she now crept through her thirties the girls could see Jennifer’s curves begin to soften as she approached 40. While not fat Jennifer’s body began to loook more middle age as she developed a small porch around her middle while fine lines began to appear around her eyes. The girls even noticed a couple of stray greys begin to appear in her blond locks. By the time Jennifer hit 40 the girls could only marvel at her. The woman was mature in her appearance with shoulder length blond hair and full curves. Her breasts, while large appeared to beginning to droop with middle age. Jennifer now ran her hands along her body inspecting herself.<br />
<br />
“Is it over,” she asked in a mature tone. The girls nodded in shock giving Jennifer a mirror. Jennifer gazed at her appearance and helped. “OMG I’m old!” She cried.<br />
<br />
“Well on the plus side your in better shape than your mom,” Mary Elise said. “And you really do look like her.”<br />
<br />
Jennifer frowned as she looked at the group. “Ugh the last thing I want is to look like my mom,”<br />
<br />
“Girls focus,” Katie said. “Listen this is perfect, Jen you could definitely pass for her now. Make the call while Shiro calls Mr. Tunner. As for the rest of us we need to start with everything else. Kel, you said Gloria is willing to help too?”<br />
<br />
Kellie nodded and smiled. “Yeah I told her about the plan and she’s more than happy to help her dad. She doesn’t know about the ring but she aware of everything else.”<br />
<br />
“Well we all know our jobs let’s get to work,” Claudia said as the group began to enact their plan.<br />
<br />
The plan appeared to be working perfectly as Shiro and Jennifer were able to convince Jason and Lisa to come to the Bishops home. The group found that being rich had its advantages as the Bishops house keeper answered the door and escorted Jason into the living room. As Lisa arrived the plan reached a critical stage as Jennifer answered the door inpersonating her mother. <br />
<br />
“Hi Helen,” Lisa said . “Wow you look great. Did you lose weight?”<br />
<br />
Jennifer smiled as she invited Lisa in. “Yeah new personal trainer and diet,” she said, trying to hide the sheepish look on her face. “Glad you could make it. Why don’t you head out to the patio. I’ll be out their momentarily, I just want to grab something to drink befor we talk.”<br />
<br />
Lisa nodded as she headed towards the back. As she walked onto the patio her jaw dropped. “Jason what are you doing here?” Jason stood up quickly as he gawked at Lisa. He was dressed for a business meeting and was still in a suit and tie. Lisa flushed slightly as she looked at him. He did look quite attractive all dressed up.<br />
<br />
“I was going to ask you the same question,” he said, slightly confused. “I’m supposed to have a business meeting with Mr. Bishop about an expansion to their home.”<br />
<br />
“Helen invited me over to talk she wanted to..” Lisa paused as she now shook her head. “Ugh the girls.”<br />
<br />
Jason cocked his head in confusion as he looked at Lisa. Before he could say anything Lisa tuned and smiled. “We’ve been parent trapped Jason,” she smirked.<br />
<br />
“Parent trap?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah like the movie. Cmon haven’t you seen it before. The two girls get their parents together on a date without telling them, hoping they fall back in love.”<br />
<br />
Jason smiled sheepishly as he scratched the back of his neck. “Um sorry no,” he said meekly. “Haven’t seen it. I guess I’m going to have to rent it with Gloria.” Lisa now started laughing as Jason blushed fiercely.<br />
<br />
“Excuse me Mr. Turner and Ms. O’Toole,” a voice said. Turning Jason and Lisa smiled as Gloria came out onto the patio. The young girl was dressed in a lovely blue dress complete with flats. “Hi,” She chirped. “My names Gloria and I’ll be your hostess this evening for your impromptu dinner date. The meal has been pre selected for you and I hope you enjoy. If you have any questions please feel free to ask.”<br />
<br />
Lisa smiled warmly as she felt her eyes begin to dampen. Turning she could see a warm smile spread across his face as he looked at his daughter. “You look so grow up Gloria,” he smiled. “Thank you I’m sure everything is going to be wonderful.”<br />
<br />
“Katie I know your in there,” Lisa yelled. “Can you and the rest of your friends get out here.”<br />
<br />
Slowly the backdoor opened as Katie, her friends, Shiro and Ashley now stood on the patio. Lisa gaped at the group in disbelief not realizing her niece had gone to this much trouble to get her and Jason back together. As she was about to ask where Jennifer was she paused. Looking at Katie she narrowed her eyes, she now realized why Helen looked so good. That had been Jennifer, aged up by Katie, inpersonating her mother. Shocked that Katie went so far to help she smiled warmly mouthing a thank you to her niece.<br />
<br />
“Sooooo we were kind of hoping you two could patch things up,” Katie said meekly. Gloria turned to her father and smiled. “Yeah come on daddy,” she pleaded. “Ms. Lisa has been as sad as you over the last few days.”<br />
<br />
Lisa and Jason turned to each other and blushed slightly before laughing softly. “Well I guess dinner never hurt anyone,” he said. “and it would give us a chance to talk.”<br />
<br />
Lisa smiled and nodded before turning to face Katie and her friends. “Okay we’ll do dinner,” she called. “But it better be good. I’m not exactly thrilled about all of you getting involved in my love life.”<br />
<br />
The group smiled as they raced back into the house to get dinner ready. Lisa shook her head as Jason gave Gloria a hug and kiss before the girl ran back into the house. As the two looked at each other they smiled, hopefully they could find a way to make this work.</p>
