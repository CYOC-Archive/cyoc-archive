<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Beldazar&#39;s magic hit Brendon and transformed his appearance and life. Indeed, his very reality. In fact, Triksi only went unchanged. Brendon&#39;s family forgot he ever existed and anything to do with him disappeared. The same went for Triksi and Brendon&#39;s family had adopted another dog. Instead, both Brendon and Triksi were cast into another family. A childless family, with now a dog and a new child. And it was there that Brendon was sent. Beldazar thought that if he was going to have fun twisting Brendon&#39;s words and wishes, then he might as well make other people happy. Brendon was just going to be in for a rough realization of his new life. He&#39;d have to discover everything about it. <br />
<br />
Brendon fell as he could see the world spin around him. It was all so strange... Was he fainting or something? He fell on his butt but surprisingly he didn&#39;t hurt himself. On the contrary, he fell on a cushion. A cushion that crinkled. Strange but lucky. He opened his eyes and focused as he looked around. But this wasn&#39;t his room! And he was in a cage! In a prison! There were bars around him! All around him! He was in a cage! A cage that had a mattress and a lot of blankets. And... toys? Plushies and big plastic toys and whatnot. Brendon looked around more thoroughly and saw that the room was one for a small kid. A changing table in a corner. Vintage cartoon characters on the walls and a lot of vintage toys too. Decorated with taste, in a sense. But why would he be here? Brendon looked at himself and started. He WAS a little kid! In a Disney pyjama that was also a footsie! So the pillow... Oh no! He was wearing a diaper! And the blankets had cartoon characters too. He tried to get up but he could barely toddle and walk. He was a toddler, barely one year old, probably! His palms and fingers were all chubby and a big tummy could be seen under the fabric of his onesie. He blinked and moved but did not wake up. It appeared so very real. It could only be reality. But how could he be a toddler? <br />
&quot;Why, good morning, my little man! Did you sleep well?&quot; said a jovial voice as the door was opened and a man stepped in.<br />
It wasn&#39;t a man though. He looked more like a bear! His hair was brown and disheveled and he had quite a bit of body hair. But his muscles were just enormous! Bulging masses worthy of a bull&#39;s! He could crush Brendon with his bare hands if he felt like it!<br />
&quot;I thought I heard you. You sleep later usually. Oh, well,&quot; said the man as he picked Brendon up, after thrusting his fingers into his diaper.<br />
Brendon felt very much humiliated and assaulted until he understood that the man was checking if his diaper was wet. Satisfied with the check, the bear of a man picked up Brendon and took him through the house. A pretty big house, where Brendon understood from the pictures around that the man he was with lived with another, slimmer but still sporty, obviously. They looked appreciative of vintage things, though. The man, calling himself Papa, fed Brendon some fruit puree and then let him play in a playpen, promising some &quot;Gabriel-and-Papa&quot; time later. &quot;Papa&quot; then typed on a computer, while Brendon, now Gabriel, absent-mindedly hugged plushies and pushed big plastic cars around the playpen. The only familiar thing was Triksi, who was there and gave big licks to the toddler. Brendon was happy to put his hands in her soft fur. He didn&#39;t know why SHE was there in this strange new world but at least she was and he was happy of that. It turned out that Papa was a sort of horror movie critic and writer. He later tickled and kissed his child profusely, exclaiming how happy he was that he and &quot;Daddy&quot; had adopted him. &quot;Daddy&quot; who was a cook and would be back later in the evening. <br />
Overall, it was very strange for Brendon but he had to admit it was pretty relaxing. He didn&#39;t have to worry about studies or other bothers and his new parents seemed loving and hard-working. And Triksi was there and treated like a queen, from what he could see. Of course, being unable to actually talk and having his diapers changed - a horrible experience!- was very frustrating. And unbeknownst to him, his inability to speak kept him from making any more wishes. Beldazar was left to wait for Brendon to learn how to speak again or for someone else to pick the lamp.</p>
