<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">To say that there was a bright light from my computer and I blacked out and then came to in a strange, white room would be rather simplistic, but it kept one important factor from the mix. Namely, who am I, what my lifestyle was like before the flash and possibly why all that happened after the flash might have occurred. So, for the sake of story-telling, let us go back to before the flash and explain what happened before I was drawn into the world of Choose Your Own Change.<br />
-----<br />
<br />
My name was Alex Jacobi, I am sixteen years old and have I have one older sister age eighteen, named Erin, and one half sister who's age ten, named Tanya. My mother died when I was thirteen and after about two years, my father remarried.<br />
<br />
About the most striking features about me are my unusual height of four foot two, short for a teenager of sixteen, and the fact that my features are rather androgynous. What most do not know about me was that I loved to dress in clothes appropriate for the opposite sex and gender, mostly Tanya's because that was the most readily available source and what would fit me.<br />
<br />
And the thing was, I may have dressed in girl's clothes, but it was not for the reason that I wanted to be a girl or anything like that. I didn't think being a girl was what I wanted. I just enjoyed how I looked and the fact that a girl's stuff was so much softer and more comfortable then a guy's. And so, every chance I got, I dressed as a girl in privacy, away from the eyes of my family and the few friends I did have, usually wearing Tanya's pyjamas to bed...which was what I was wearing the morning I was drawn into the world of Choose Your Own Change.<br />
-----<br />
<br />
My morning started off uneventful. I awoke to find that my step-mother and dad had gone away for the week, since it was spring break, and that Tanya was away of a girl-scout trip and Erin was spending her week with friends. Understanding that I was to have the week to myself, I decided that most of that time would be spent wearing Tanya's clothes, sitting either before the telly or in front of the computer, checking my two favourite sites...cyoc.net and Titillating TG captions...or going over to Mark's place if he wanted to hang.<br />
<br />
After having decided this, I climbed out of bed, ran a hand over the fuzzy, one-piece, footed pyjamas I am wearing and after a moment, I stretched and headed for the bathroom. Shucking off the pyjamas, I hop into the shower, wash myself and afterward, a towel wrapped around my torso, I head for Tanya's room, taking the pyjamas I wore to bed with me. Depositing them in her closet, knowing she won’t find them for some time, I turn to her dresser and open the top drawer. After a moment of thought, I take a pair of her underwear and a pair of socks. From the next drawer, I take a purple shirt that I know to be kind of big on both Tanya and I.<br />
<br />
Opening the second from last drawer, I began to sort through her jeans and bib-overalls, wondering what would go with the shirt I had just selected. Out of the corner of my eye, I caught sight of a pair of yellow Lycra-Spandex pants sitting in a box. Closing the drawer, I pick them up, noting that they are part of Tanya's Hallowe'en costume she wore the year previous and that there was a tail that looked like a fox's sewn to the seat of the pants.<br />
<br />
Smelling them, making sure that they were clean, I decided, except for the tail, which I would not remove, they would look cute with the shirt and dropping the towel, I move naked across Tanya's room to her mirror, where I began to slowly get dressed.<br />
<br />
Afterward, a bowl of cereal from the kitchen, I head for the living room where the computer was and sitting down, I folded my legs up lotus style, like Tanya often did when she sat before the computer, and booting up the machine, I slowly began to eat my breakfast. When the internet was finally activated, I headed for the sight cyoc.net, shifting a bit so the tail was draped over the side of the chair.<br />
<br />
Seeing the familiar warning, I click on the 'enter' icon and wait. Suddenly, there was a bright flash and briefly I thought, &quot;Great. Parents leave me home alone for once and I blow up the computer,&quot; before I blacked out.<br />
-----<br />
<br />
Slowly, consciousness returns and for some reason I hear the mingling voices of several people chatting amongst themselves. And then it dawned on me that they were in the same room with me and that I was clearly still wearing my sister's clothes. Snapping my eyes open, realising that I was lying against a wall, I stayed perfectly still as I looked about, hoping nobody would notice me and come to the conclusion that I was really a boy in drag.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's your name,&quot; a voice asked and closing my eyes, I hoped that they were not talking to me and then the voice said, &quot;It's okay. You don't have to be scared. I'm betting you were drawn into the computer as well, though you do look a bit young to have been on Choose Your Own Change.&quot;<br />
<br />
Opening my eyes, seeing a teenage girl standing before me, I mutter in what I hope to be a voice as close to a feminine tone, &quot;Alex,&quot; and then started to look about again, noting that I was in a white room.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's a pretty name,&quot; the girl said, apparently unaware that I was really a boy, thinking that I was nothing more than a scared little girl. And then she sat down beside me and said, &quot;My name is Rei. Do you normally go on Choose Your Own Change?&quot;<br />
<br />
Unsure what to say, wishing she would just go away, sure that sooner or later she would discover my secret, I shifted uncomfortably, glad that I had at least the brains to tuck my penis and testicles between my legs, I thought what I should say and finally just shook my head 'no' and then muttered, &quot;I was just surfing the web when I found an odd pop-up and when I clicked on it, it took me to the warning page and then everything went white.&quot;<br />
<br />
The girl listened to my explanation and then replied, &quot;I do not normally go on Choose Your Own Change. Most of the stories are so sexually immature. But, today I thought about a story I had been typing on and decided to see if it had an update. And then there was this weird bright flash and...&quot;<br />
<br />
Barely listening, nodding every once and a bit, I finally asked, &quot;Do you know how we are supposed to get out of here?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rei stopped talking for a moment and then explained, &quot;Well, I saw some doors on the other side of the room. And over there,&quot; she pointed to her left as she told me, &quot;I saw an alcove that looked like it contained a couple arcade machines. But, I do not know where the doors go or why there are arcade games, or even where we are, though I am pretty sure that we are in the world of Choose Your Own Change.&quot;<br />
<br />
Still keeping my voice quiet, I asked, &quot;What happens on Choose Your Own Change,&quot; deciding that for the moment, it would be better to keep up the charade.<br />
<br />
Rei shrugged and the said, &quot;Mostly people just post stories about changes, though, usually stories are focused on transgender and transsexual changes. But there are other changes, like becoming other people or some type of animal.&quot;<br />
<br />
Unsure what I should say, I decided to just sit there and think of ways I could get away, without being rude, before Rei discovered the truth about my sex. After a moment of silence between us, Rei stated, &quot;I am going to try one of the doors. Just to see where it goes. Would you like to join me, Alex,&quot; and standing, she held out her hand to me.<br />
<br />
Hesitant, I glance about the room, note that nobody way paying either of us the least bit of attention and glancing back at Rei, thinking that I should at least play along for a bit longer, I nod and reaching up, I take her hand and allow myself to be stood up.<br />
<br />
Standing, I adjust my posture while Rei was looking the other way so that I at least stand the same Tanya stood, I mutter, &quot;So where are these doors,&quot; to which Rei indicates across the room.<br />
<br />
Muttering, &quot;Lead the way,&quot; I started to follow her across the room, keeping a relatively safe distance from other people as we went, listening to the various conversations, most on the subject of how they, the people, arrived in this white room, what they should do now and how it was they might be able to get back home again.<br />
<br />
When Rei and I arrived on the other side of the room, I paused when I saw that there was only three doors, all simple in structure and all painted the same shade of white as the rest of the room, the only thing giving away that they were the was the brass doorknob on each and the black outline that hinted on something beyond. Approaching the one of the left, I turned the knob and pulled just a bit, and when I saw how easy it would open, I released the doorknob and looked over at Rei, who was doing the same thing I was, only with the door on the right.<br />
<br />
Seeing me looking at her, Rei released the doorknob and as the door slowly closed, she asked, &quot;Should we go through? And which one?&quot;<br />
<br />
Shrugging, I mutter, &quot;I am not sure? I do not really want to wander into a place where I am going end up being somebody else or an animal or the opposite sex or any combination of the three or anything else that might be posted on Choose Your Own Change.&quot; <br />
<br />
Rei nodded at this and after a moment, she came over to the door I was standing in front of and said, &quot;I suppose, just to be on the safe side, we should both go through the same door. You know. To watch each other's back. Just in case something happens,&quot; and reaching she turned the doorknob I had turned seconds prior and asked, &quot;Did you see anything on the other side when you opened this door?&quot;<br />
<br />
Shaking my head, I explained in the same quiet voice, &quot;I didn't open it enough to be able see what was on the other side.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stepping back to look at the doors, Rei noticed for the first time the fox tail attached to the seat of the yellow pants I was wearing and pointing at it, she asked, &quot;What's with the tail? Is it part of some type of costume for Hallowe'en?&quot;<br />
<br />
I shrug and then replied, &quot;It was all I had to wear. Today is laundry day and I had no other clean pants.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rei shrugged in return and focusing her attention back on the doors, she asked, &quot;So, if we decide on the doors as our exit, which one should we take? Or should we just leave it all up to chance and randomness and just choose a door?&quot;<br />
<br />
Again, I shrugged, and then, feeling rather bold and wanting to get this over with, I reach out and grasp the door handle before me and turning it, I pull the door open, not caring what was really on the other side, wanting only to get out of this white room and away from all of these people before somebody discovered my secret, hoping that I would be able to go through without Rei, but figuring that there would be no way without being rude.</p>
