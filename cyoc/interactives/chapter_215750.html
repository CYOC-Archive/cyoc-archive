<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Baby?” Ken called.<br />
<br />
He had used the Chronivac to move into Jess’s house, taking over the spare room. Her parents didn’t mind. Not anymore, at least. Ken smirked. They could be as loud as they wanted.<br />
<br />
Jess walked in, her breasts bouncing in a loose shirt, nipples clearly outline in the fabric. It was one of his own shirts, which was why it didn’t fit her right, draping from the top of her breasts. She liked wearing his clothes. Said it made her feel close to Ken. Ken didn’t mind, since his heart fluttered and cock hardened whenever he saw her wearing his things. She was his perfect girl, after all.<br />
<br />
He sighed. <br />
<br />
Not for long.<br />
<br />
“Alright, Jess.” Ken pointed at the screen. “All you need to do is hit this button for me.”<br />
<br />
“Why do I have to do it?” Jess asked, cocking her head in confusion. “You know I’m fine with whatever you change, babe.”<br />
<br />
“I know, sweetheart,” Ken said, reaching out an arm and puling her close, rubbing her bubbly ass.  “But it’s your program. You’re the activated tester, not men. Transdem Industries is getting upset that you aren’t changing things and testing the public relations waters.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, well…” Jess tapped her pointy chin, “I know! You keep talking about wanting a car. Why not turn something or someone into one?”<br />
<br />
“Because I’m saving that for an enemy,” Ken said.<br />
<br />
“Right…and you don’t have any because you’re the most perfect man in the world.” Jess said without any hint of sarcasm. <br />
<br />
That statement made Ken feel both really good and more than a little embarrassed. He pulled her into a kiss, wanting to taste her lips one last time. They made out, his cock going rock hard, like it did whenever she was in his arms. He might actually, truly, love her, and the thought scared him.<br />
<br />
And because he wasn’t a Designated Tester for the Chronivac, he was going to lose her.<br />
<br />
The clock was ticking away. Twenty-four hours was a long time to some, but when that was the last time you would ever see your girl in the immediate future, it really wasn’t long enough at all. He kissed her hard, squeezing Jess to him.<br />
<br />
Then, with a sigh, Ken pulled away. He had stalled long enough. They only had an hour left. He wanted to at least make it enjoyable.<br />
<br />
“Alright baby, press the button before things get too out of hand.”<br />
<br />
Jess batted her lashes, “Okay, Ken.”<br />
<br />
She reached over, guided the mouse to the button on the screen, and clicked ‘Activate’.<br />
<br />
Then she sat in his lap, breasts pressed to his chest, and kissed him deeply.<br />
<br />
Ken ran his hands over her body, feeling the curves of her hips and breasts. He slipped his shirt off of her, tossing it to the floor, enjoying the way her fat tits wobbled freely, the areolas nice and pink, nipples perky. With a grunt, he picked her up and carried her to his bed.<br />
<br />
Jess gave a cute little squeal.<br />
<br />
He sat down on the bed, his girl still in his lap. The changes would be starting soon. Ken had set the timer to wait five minutes. She squirmed out of her jeans and sat in his lap, completely naked save for her panties, which were wet with her arousal.<br />
<br />
Ken pulled his shirt off and she helped remove his own pants and underwear and the two lay in bed, Jess on top of him.<br />
<br />
On the computer, the timer ticked the last few seconds away.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br />
<br />
Jess straddled her handsome boyfriend as he lay on his bed.<br />
<br />
She’d been so happy when he’d gotten everything he’d wanted. Jess ran her hands over his perfect washboard abs, admiring how smooth his golden tanned skin was, then rubbed up to the deep crease between his thickly muscled pecs. Ken just smiled at her.<br />
<br />
That was strange.<br />
<br />
Normally, he’d be smothering her with kisses, eating out her pussy. But all day he’d been acting strangely aloof. His cock was hard, throbbing beneath her, but he made no motion to thrust. She was about to ask what was wrong when her nipples started to ache.<br />
<br />
She reached up and touched them, feeling something warm trickle down her torso. Her tender nipples pulsed and more warm fluid dribbled from their tips. Jess moaned, her breasts growing more sensitive.<br />
<br />
“I love you, Jess,” Ken said, smiling up at her.<br />
<br />
“I love you too, Ken,” Jess breathed, taking his hands and placing them on her massive breasts. “Can you rub them? My nipples are feeling so sore.”<br />
<br />
Ken gently caressed them, making her moan, her pussy feeling so empty and churning oddly. She blushed as he massaged her bountiful boobs, milk flowing from them and over their hands. Jess leaned forward and kissed him as he squeezed her full, luscious breasts.<br />
<br />
He broke the kiss, his mouth moving down her chest. <br />
<br />
“Ah! Ah!” Jess gasped, her tits almost painfully sensitive and looking oddly smaller, the flesh dimpled. “Ken!”<br />
<br />
Ken’s mouth engulfed one of those voluptuous orbs and sucked on it ravenously. His tongue twirled around her nipple, flicking it. Jess shook in delight at the pleasure, her feeling intense relief as the milk was sucked out of it.<br />
<br />
Her boyfriend switched, suckling from the next. Jess’s mind was nearly blank as she processed the feeling of his mouth as he milked her dry. Little by little, each pull and tug Ken’s mouth made caused he plump mounds to shrink and shrivel. She didn’t even notice, her arms wrapped around her sexy boyfriend’s hard, muscled torso, moaning.<br />
<br />
She closed her eyes, cupping Ken’s head while he nursed.<br />
<br />
A few minutes later, her tits began to feel tight and lighter than normal. There was no more of that intense pressure and it was like a weight had literally lifted from her shoulders. Oddly, while Ken was still sucking and flicking her nips, the hot pleasure had changed. It wasn’t nearly as pleasurable, merely erotic. She reached up to feel her breasts, expecting to find wobbly breast-flesh.<br />
<br />
Instead, where her breasts once lay, she found flat skin. <br />
<br />
Jess opened her eyes and looked down. She stared in horror as the last of her wrinkly boob skin began to refill, but with slabs of broad muscles instead of fat. Ken reached up and milked the last drops of fluid from her sizeable nipples, the final remnants of her buoyant breasts, and then they too shrunk. .<br />
<br />
Her pectorals began to harden and the skin of her waist began to raise into respectable abs as Jess’s chest began to barrel outwards.<br />
<br />
“Ken!” Jess gasped, tears welling up in her eyes, “My breasts!”<br />
<br />
“It’s okay, Jess,” Ken smiled, pulling her further forward and pulling her panties down. “I’m turning you back into Jeff.”<br />
<br />
“What?” Jess asked, distracted by the prickly sensation of hairs sprouting from her skin.<br />
<br />
“I told you I only changed your hair color. I lied. I turned you into my girlfriend, Jeff.” Ken said, “The week is up.”<br />
<br />
Jess was too busy scratching her bristly face as a beard started growing in to really get upset. Things began to make sense now. Ken calling her Jeff, enjoying the talk about her pussy. No, she wasn’t angry. Jess was sad, because she knew he loved her and she’d loved him. It may have started as a prank, but the way he looked at her? There was true love there.<br />
<br />
Her thoughts were interrupted by a tug on her clitoris and Ken’s tongue exploring her slit.<br />
<br />
She gasped and looked down to see Ken eagerly and lovingly feasting on her wet pussy. Jess quivered, rocking her body into his face, pressing him into her as pleasure radiated from her snatch. As she writhed, a sudden warmth blossomed deep in her churning womb. The heat soon spread all across her body.<br />
<br />
Bones and joints cracked and popped and her muscles writhed pleasantly beneath her skin as her shoulders widened. Her spine popped as she grew taller, muscles pulsing and expanding in her back filling her with brawny strength. Finally, her body began losing all its feminine curves as her fat melted away, her big, bouncy ass becoming a pair of globular, muscular haunches.<br />
<br />
Ken continued lavishing her vagina with licks even as her clit swelled, the warmth and churning in her gut growing in intensity.<br />
<br />
Her face followed with the rest of her body, losing its round curves and soft features as her jaw became angular. Jess’s hair receded, leaving her with a short but trendy male cut. She resembled a rather handsome, athletic man at this point save for the feminine folds between her legs.<br />
<br />
“God I’m gonna miss your pussy, Jeff.” Ken mumbled into her slit, his face covered in her fluids.<br />
<br />
He drilled his tongue deeper into Jess’s sagging flesh. Jess’s clit swelled up and out of her slit, throbbing and needy. Ken paused, eyeing it as though making a decision, then engulfed it and sucked on the little nub. Jess gasped, the pleasure intense as he wrapped his tongue around it as the swelling clit grew and thickened.<br />
<br />
Underneath her clit, Jess’s slit sealed itself up. Then the folds of her pussy began to sag. Her clit began to take on more cock-like features, a head forming and a slit opening up at the tip as her urethra grew up through the fleshy tube. It was all Jess could do but moan at the alien, pleasurable feelings racing through her new member.<br />
<br />
Jess grunted, feeling nauseous as two large balls slid into the sagging sack at the base of her cock. They churned as her clit-dick surged forward, filling up Ken’s mouth and bumping the back of his throat. Ken’s eyes widened and he gagged, cheeks puffing as veins wormed their way along Jess’s new shaft and throbbed warmly on his tongue.<br />
<br />
Ken pulled his mouth off the still-growing shaft and lifted Jess’s panties over that big cock. They warped as that beercan-thick dick continued to grow, transforming from dainty silk into a slightly worn-looking but clean jockstrap. Jess smelt a waft of masculine musk hit her nostrils.<br />
<br />
Her…his? Thoughts felt funny as his pussy was replaced by a cock. Jeff felt good…really good. His jockstrap hadn’t felt this pleasantly tight before. It was all Jeff could to not show off, kiss his bowling-ball sized biceps, and flex in front of a mirror.<br />
<br />
Jeff loved the way his abs grew thicker and harder, then softening as a fatty gut grew, forming a swelling musclegut on top of that washboard. It was soft and warm and felt like a great big scoop of creamy frozen custard, placed on top of the best plate in high school.<br />
<br />
His musclegut expanded with the rest of his body, arms and legs growing thicker and brawnier. While his body grew, the itching spread across his form as a carpet of body hair burst forth from his skin. It bushed his armpits, fluffed his groin, and blazed a treasure trail up past his belly button all the way to his chest, which it covered in a thick mat.<br />
<br />
Jeff scratched his short beard, the warmth still simmering in his veins. <br />
<br />
He knew the strange urges to show off, the pride welling in his meaty chest, were desires he’d never have felt about a few minutes ago. It felt natural now. He adjusted himself, the jockstrap feeling tight. It was kind of kinky and the undersizaed garment was doing things for him. He was so bulgy down there. All he wanted to do was…<br />
<br />
Jeff started massaging his cock through the jockstrap, loving how his large package filled the pouch of his jock to bursting. Still rubbing his cock, he flexed one arm, admiring the bulge of muscle from his long hours at the gym. Damn, he was so sexy, especially with that full beard he’d been growing in for a while, and the coating of fur on his muscled arms. <br />
<br />
Jeff reached over with one long, muscular arm and grabbed his phone off the side table.out  He began snapping some pics of himself flexing, then palming his bulge. Yeah, his cock did fit very nicely in the pouch of the jockstrap, all eight inches of it. The thick dick stretched the fabric to its limits, cockmeat visible on the sides<br />
<br />
He pulled his massive schlong out the side, slowly massaging it as he took a few more shots, then put his phone away so he could fondle his big balls with his other hand. Dang he was horny!<br />
<br />
“Feeling good, Jeff?” Ken’s voice came from below him.<br />
<br />
Jeff looked down and blinked.<br />
<br />
His boyfriend, Ken, was lying beneath him on the bed. He honestly hadn’t even noticed him. Talk about a brainfart! They way they were positioned, it was clear they’d intended to become more intimate but Jeff had gotten distracted showing off his hot bod and posting his pics on social media.<br />
<br />
“Sorry sweetheart!” Jeff chuckled, rubbing the back of his neck with one bulging arm and blushing, “Didn’t meant to forget you like that!”<br />
<br />
Jeff coughed, surprised at how deep and husky his voice was. <br />
<br />
“It’s alright,” Ken smiled, running his hands over Jeff’s thick body.”I know how you varsity wrestlers get.”<br />
<br />
Jeff snorted, forgetting about how weirdly deep his voice was. But he did think it was kinda strange, the way Ken was acting. It was like he’d never seen Jeff naked before! Of course he had…though not sexually, Jeff supposed. Just during gym and after practice.<br />
<br />
Yeah.<br />
<br />
New memories flooded in. He and Jeff were the stars in their chosen fields, respectively. They’d watch each other’s games, hang out together. Best friends. And then they became teenagers and they both started filling out.<br />
<br />
He remembered showering together after practice and he’d checked Ken out. Jeff had admired the athletes muscles and golden skin. All he ever wanted since then was to get Jeff in bed with him. But, sadly, Ken was straight as an arrow, or so he claimed.<br />
<br />
Which was why Jeff had so readily agreed to spending a week as Ken’s girlfriend after losing a bet.<br />
<br />
“I had a pussy,” Jeff said, recalling how nice that had felt. <br />
<br />
“Yes, I loved it.” Ken winked.<br />
<br />
“You…dude, you fucking kissed my puss, bro!” Jeff laughed.<br />
<br />
Ken blushed. “Yeah, so?”<br />
<br />
“You said you loved me.” Jeff said, sobering up. “Did you mean that?”<br />
<br />
Ken flushed red and turned away, “N-no!”<br />
<br />
Jeff smiled, enjoying that ineffective denial. <br />
<br />
He had just used the Chronivac. By this time, Ken should be a gay bottom with an interest in being dominated by big, burly men. Men that looked an awful lot like, well, Jeff. <br />
<br />
“I’m sorry about the girl thing, Jeff,” Ken said, running his hands over Jeff’s form.<br />
<br />
As far as Jeff was concerned, he had always been gay with a crush on Ken. <br />
<br />
Ken had turned him into a girl, and when it was Jeff’s turn, Jeff had chosen to undo the transgender transformation. Then he used it to turn himself into the star wrestler and Ken gay in revenge. In reality, that was the package Ken had set up and Jess had activated.<br />
<br />
“It’s alright, Ken,” Jeff grinned, scratching his hairy, barrel-like chest. “You’re gonna make it up to me.”</p>
