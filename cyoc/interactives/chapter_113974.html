<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After talking with the group during the study hour, the bell rang, indicating for students to go back to their classes.  The group of six went out of the library and to their respective classes.  Melissa focused on her classes, despite everything that was going on in her mind.  A part of her wanted to be a werecow to be with Trevor.  Another part of her wanted to be something else, leaning towards being a werefox.  Another part of her whipped the other two parts and told her to focus on class and taking notes.  Once the bell rang, she gave a sigh of relief that the school day was over, and she packed her books into her bag, and made her way to the front of the school.  Before she saw Trevor, she saw both Megumi and Alice at the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Mel!&quot; Alice shouted as she saw Melissa.  Melissa smiled and waved back, heading towards the two girls.  &quot;Soooo...when&#39;s the wedding?&quot; Alice asked with a grin on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guys,&quot; Melissa responded with a blush on her face.<br />
<br />
Seeing Mel&#39;s embarrassment made Megumi laugh a little before she said, &quot;Relax, Mel.  We&#39;re only messing with you.  Truth be told...&quot; Megumi looked around before continuing, &quot;We&#39;re a bit jealous.  Call it a girl&#39;s intuition, or maybe a werefox&#39;s instinct, but I think Trevor&#39;s into you.&quot;  This made Melissa&#39;s face burn even brighter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, and truth be told,&quot; Alice added in, &quot;We&#39;re sorta jealous.  I mean, we got those two boys but they don&#39;t seem to seem that interested in us.  Well, not in THAT way.&quot;  A grin formed on Alice&#39;s face as she said, &quot;Although, I can&#39;t really complain about the sex.&quot;  Melissa tried to look away with her eyes averting to the side as Megumi tried to contain her laughter as she watched Melissa&#39;s reaction.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I...um...I...wouldn&#39;t know,&quot; Melissa managed to stutter out.<br />
<br />
Megumi&#39;s expression softened a bit and put a hand on Melissa&#39;s shoulder.  &quot;So, I take it that you&#39;ve never done the horizontal tango with a boy before.&quot;  Melissa quietly and quickly shook her head, indicating agreement with Megumi&#39;s statement.   &quot;Well, as one who&#39;s helped other normals go through this process, the best piece of advice I can give is this.  Let things happen naturally.  Try to not overthink it.  Sex is a normal and natural part of were-life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Although,&quot; Alice added with a more serious look, &quot;There are also other pleasures.  For example, I like bounding through the trees and the fields with the wind going through my fur.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Or the thrill of hunting down a rabbit,&quot; said Megumi.  Alice turned towards Megumi with narrowed eyes and a rather large scowl on her face.  Megumi simply smiled and shrugged.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway,&quot; Alice continued, &quot;I think the point that Meg and I are trying to make is that being a were is a great life.  You rarely get sick, you live a long time, and there are all sorts of pleasures that you can enjoy and not just sexual pleasures.  As long as you remember to stay in harmony with your more animal side and remember the three rules, you&#39;ll be fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Three rules?&quot; asked Mel.<br />
<br />
&quot;First, don&#39;t kill anyone,&quot; answered Megumi, &quot;Murder is probably the worst thing you can do as a were.  That includes normals as well as other weres.  While there may be justifications to kill someone, try to avoid doing so anyway if you can help it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Second,&quot; continued Alice, &quot;Don&#39;t change anyone without their permission.  Ever.  This could have serious consequences for those forcefully transformed as well as those weres who do so.  Accidents do happen, and that&#39;s ok, but it&#39;s never ok to do it on purpose to anyone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Megumi said, &quot;There was case not too long ago where a rogue were-vixen went crazy and changed a couple of people into werefoxes.  The Skulk are still recovering from that, and it brought great shame not just to the rogue were-vixen, but to the entire Skulk.&quot;  Megumi looked down at the floor with a frown on her face.  Alice looked at her friend with concern as she put an arm around her.  &quot;Anyway, just be careful with normals when you become a were.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Melissa said, &quot;And the third rule?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Always take your birth control pills everyday,&quot; Megumi answered.  &quot;It&#39;s the only protection that you have between being pregnant and not being pregnant.  As you heard yesterday, we weres are very fertile, and having sex once without the pill is enough to get any were pregnant.  Unless you want to have a baby, don&#39;t forget to take the pill every day.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Mel replied nodding her head, &quot;my dad made me promise the same thing when I told him that I would be the family were.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice smirked a little and said, &quot;Smart man, that father of yours.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, yeah,&quot; Mel said as she shrugged a little, &quot;he is a college professor after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;College professor you say,&quot; Megumi said softly with a mischevious grin on her face.  &quot;He might be useful for a little project we have...&quot;  Megumi was interrupted with the appearance of Trevor in the hallway.  Melissa spotted him and wave him over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mel!&quot; Trevor called out as he approached.  &quot;Ready to go?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Mel said as she turned to the two girls.  She gave both of them a brief hug before saying, &quot;Thanks for everything guys.  You&#39;ve been really helpful.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hopefully, these two didn&#39;t fill your head with lies or anything like that,&quot; Trevor said as he put an arm around Megumi.<br />
<br />
&quot;Trevor!&quot; Alice exclaimed with a look of mock surprise on her face.  &quot;We wouldn&#39;t DARE do such a thing.&quot;  She then turned to Melissa and whispered loudly, &quot;Now remember, when you&#39;re with Trevor, watch out for the tentacles that were-bulls have.&quot;  Melissa rolled her eyes and gave a half smile as she turned with Trevor.  She could hear the two girls giggling in the background.<br />
------------------------------------------<br />
The two climbed into the truck, and then Trevor started the engine and pulled out of the parking lot.  The farm wasn&#39;t far from the school, but it did give the two a little time to talk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um...Trevor,&quot; Mel started, fiddling with her hair.  &quot;About, um, yesterday, I just wanted to say I&#39;m sorry about the things that I said.  I really didn&#39;t understand.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor smiled slightly as he glanced at Melissa.  He could tell that she was nervous by the way that she fiddled with her hair.  &quot;It&#39;s all right.  Mistakes happen.  Best to learn from it and move on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; she replied with a slight smile on her face.  <br />
<br />
The two drove in silence before Trevor broke in, &quot;So, are you really thinking about being a werecow?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Melissa said with her voice shaking a little.  &quot;It&#39;s something that I&#39;ve been considering.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Any particular reason why?&quot; Trevor asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I mean, I&#39;ve been thinking about what I wanted to become.  I mean, werecattle are good looking, don&#39;t get me wrong, but they also have this gentle strength that I&#39;ve come to admire.  Also, I&#39;ve been thinking that if I were a werecow, then I would be with you...&quot;  Melissa was speaking so fast because she was so nervous that she didn&#39;t register what she was saying before it left her mouth.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I...I see,&quot; Trevor said.  The air between them grew a little thicker.  &quot;And, um. do you have any plans for...you know...changing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, well,&quot; Melissa responded as her face flushed red.  &quot;If I were to be a werecow, I know who&#39;d I ask.&quot;  Right when she said those words, she realized what she said and what was implied.  Her face turned bright red as she tried to hide it in her hands.  It took all of Trevor&#39;s willpower to keep his eyes on the road as he felt his penis stiffen at the mere thought of being with, and changing, Melissa.  He shifted slightly hoping to hide his erection from Melissa.  The air between them grew even more thicker as these thoughts went through their heads.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, it wasn&#39;t long before the truck reached Trevor&#39;s farm and both of them scrambled out of the truck to get away from the rather uncomfortable situation.</p>
