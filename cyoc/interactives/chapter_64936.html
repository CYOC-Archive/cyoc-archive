<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As I stared out the window, I saw the local paperboy riding his bike down the hill. As my driveway was rather long, he had to actually <br />
come up to the house to deliver the paper. Excellent. <br />
<br />
I knew the boy as Toby McKizik, my neighbors' son. He was a senior in the highschool down the street and the quarterback on their <br />
football team. I also happened to know he was gay as well. I had seen him bring teammates and friends home when his parents weren't <br />
around. And let's just say these old houses aren't exactly soundproof. I hurried downstairs and opened the door just as Toby was <br />
getting out my paper. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! Good morning, Mr. Cole,&quot; he greeted happily for a teenage boy who was up at five in the morning. &quot;You're up early today.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I never really went to bed,&quot; I told him. &quot;I was up all night finishing my latest project. Care to have a look?&quot;<br />
<br />
Everyone in the neighborhood knew I was a basement scientist. Most of my previous inventions had been flops, and it was more of a <br />
joke than a concern. Which actually played right into my hand. <br />
<br />
Not wanting to be rude, I suppose, Toby agreed to come inside. He saw the small yet complex machine on the diningroom table and <br />
gave me a questioning look. <br />
<br />
&quot;It is a machine that will change life as we know it!&quot; I boasted with an exaggerated flare of my hands. I wanted it to appear as though <br />
this machine wouldn't work, so that Toby would be more willing to try it. &quot;By having two people man the controls, each can transform the <br />
other into whatever they want! In the process, they can also control the whole world around them to accomodate their changes!&quot;<br />
<br />
This, of course, wasn't entirely true. Only the person working the main controls could change anything other than their partner. <br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Toby asked with a hint of incredulity. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, if you don't believe me, let's try it out,&quot; I suggested. &quot;We could agree to the transformations ahead of time so that we know what <br />
to expect. If it works, and we don't like it, we can always change it back. If it doesn't work, you'll just have another story about crazy Mr. <br />
Cole who think's he's a mad scientist.&quot;<br />
<br />
With a chuckle, Toby agreed to try it out. I took out a piece of paper and pencil, setting it on the table between us. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright then, I'll be generous. You can pick both of our transformations. First, what do you want to change about you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Toby thought, &quot;I was watching one of those Japanese movies last night and the main character was a fox that stood on its hind <br />
legs and like a human body and hands, but still covered in fur.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;An anthromorphic fox?&quot; I asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, something like that. It would be cool to be that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, 'anthromorphic fox',&quot; I recited and wrote that on the paper. &quot;Now what would you like to turn me into?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You?&quot; Toby considered the question. &quot;Well...what if you were my age again? But you were a surfer with blonde hair and blue eyes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A surfer? Alright, anything else?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you could be kind of muscular, but not like body-builder big. If you're a surfer, you have to be tan. Uh...oh, if you didn't have body <br />
hair, you would be more streamlined for swimming. And what about an otter tattoo, like it was swimming across your back?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's very specific, but okay,&quot; I wrote it down. <br />
<br />
I knew that this was Toby's fantasy. I also suspected he might be adding the same thing I would to the transformation. We shook hands <br />
and agreed to follow the plan. I was lying, of course. I would be making far more changes than Toby had ever considered. I explained <br />
how the machine worked, he simply worked the driver while I did everything else. <br />
<br />
Once he understood, I set up the machine and we began to work it. The wires stuck to our heads picked up the thoughts we wanted for <br />
our partner and put them into action. I could feel the energy flow through me as I regressed in age to become an eighteen-year-old <br />
surfer as Toby had described. I also watched as Toby's ears moved up and changed shape as he grew a tail and a lot of fur. The <br />
feeling was the most amazing ever, and I was tempted to lose myself in it. But I had work to do. <br />
<br />
I added the thoguht for Toby's junk to double in size and for him to become my obedient and loving slave. I changed the house so that <br />
it would be a temple dedicated to me. I changed the world so that I was worshipped by every human on Earth as a god and creator of <br />
sex. The world would be male oriented, with women being kept as a small percentage of the population for the sole purpose of breeding. <br />
All men would be gay and all would be beautiful. I had nothing against furries, and Toby was to become one, so I also made anyone <br />
who had been a furry before transform into an anthro animal of their desire now. The new world would be a massive orgy centered on <br />
me with Toby as my personal favorite. <br />
<br />
By now, I had become the hunky and handsome surfer which Toby had dreamed of and Toby was the anthro fox he had fantasized <br />
about. He had a look on his face that showed he knew something was wrong with the house and himself. We gasped in unison as both <br />
of our crotches grew larger. Toby and I both rushed to remove our restrictive clothing as 18&quot; monsters flopped down on top of two <br />
coconuts. Toby was about to say something when a blissful and lusty expression overcame his face. I did a mental victory dance as the <br />
final transformations occured. <br />
<br />
We now stood in a large temple, surrounded by staues and images of my new body. There was noise outside of thousands of men <br />
flocking to see me. And Toby, my newly vulpine slave, stood eager to serve and service me. <br />
<br />
&quot;That's a good boy,&quot; I cooed as I scratched his headfur. &quot;Thank you for helping me realize my dreams. And for that, you may worship my <br />
body and cock as long as you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, thank you, Master!&quot; Toby said gleefully. <br />
<br />
He quickly got on his knees in front of me and took my enourmous cock into his paws. He began to lap at the head, sending shivers <br />
through my gorgeous young body. The otter tattoo Toby had given me came from the base of my neck, down and around so that its <br />
head appeared to be kissing the base of my cock. Soon, Toby's muzzle had made it that far and was making out with my otterfrom <br />
around my dick. The sight was so hot that I couldn't hold it any longer.  I blew my load down the fox-boy's throat who eagerly lapped it <br />
up. He gave a feral grin and licked the remainder from his lips. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, boy,&quot; I told him, &quot;I think it's time to share my body with the people.&quot;</p>
