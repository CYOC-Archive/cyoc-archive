<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Travis gazed over the room that he was going to live in, taking in the mess, the dirty stinky clothes, the smell of sweat and BO, the grime. He sighed, he still thought it was gross, but he had already committed. He would feel like a failure if he backed out now. <br />
<br />
<br />
Travis walked downstairs and found Bruce in the kitchen, still butt naked. His back was turned towards Travis. He could see that Bruce&#39;s back was just as hairy as his front, and his butt was incredibly furry as well. Travis grimaced and looked down at his hairless, pale body. He was really glad he didn&#39;t have any body hair, it was kind of gross. <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Bruce?&quot;, Travis timidly asked in his small, high pitched voice. &quot;I&#39;ve thought it over, I want to stay&quot;. Brice grinned at Travis with his furry face. &quot;Well alright dude!&quot;, He said as he clapped Travis on the back. &quot;Let&#39;s get started, buddy!&quot;. <br />
<br />
<br />
Bruce led Travis back upstairs into their dirty, shared room. &quot;Alright Travis, I want you to tell me. Do you think your a man?&quot;. Travis responded sheepishly, &quot;umm yeah? I guess?&quot;. Bruce laughed mockingly; &quot;Hahaha your not a man! Not yet at least. Me? I&#39;m totally a man! Men are supposed to be hairy! They stink! They love to beat off and fuck! That&#39;s what men are, like cavemen! You? Your not even close. But this frats going to help you along the way!&quot; Bruce raises his massive bicep, letting his thick armpit bush be visible to Travis. A wave of BO hit Travis and he scrunched up his nose. <br />
<br />
<br />
Bruce chuckled. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, boy, you&#39;ll get used to my stink. Hell, your gonna love it soon enough! Pretty soon with the no shower rule, youll have a musk about you too!&quot;. Travis highly doubted this; that he would like another man&#39;s stinky BO, let alone this hairy beasts stench? No way!<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;First things first, though, I want to see how dedicated you are to the frat, and to me&quot;, Bruce began, as he began to recline on the couch, naked, with his huge soft meat on display. He out one hand behind his head, showing off his hairy pits. With the other, he gestured down his hairy torso. &quot;I want you to give me a hand job, Travis&quot;, he said with a grin. <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;What? No! Gross! I&#39;ve never done anything like that with a guy before!&quot;, Travis shouted. Bruce grinned; &quot;do it now, or your out. As simple as that. Prove to us that you are loyal or else your not gonna make it as a pledge. It&#39;s fine, bro, we give each other hand jobs all the time in the frat!&quot;. <br />
<br />
<br />
Travis&#39; mind was racing; one one hand, he really wanted to join the frat. On the other hand, he wasn&#39;t going to jack a guy off. Especially not one as hairy and stinky as Bruce. He could only imagine the last time Bruce had washed his dick, from the smell it was giving off. Travis gulped as he made his decision. He would do it! He was already committed to the frat and didn&#39;t want to let himself down! &quot;Alright Bruce, fine, I&#39;ll do it. I&#39;m not gay though!&quot;. Bruce just smiled and chuckled. <br />
<br />
<br />
He laid down on the couch and put both feet up, and put both of his hands behind his head. With his hairy armpits on full display, it filled the room with a nasty, musky BO smell that made Travis grimace. Travis stared at the fat, hairy cock. It looked bestial! It was covered in a rug of thick curly brown pubes, it had a thick foreskin over the tip, and it was covered up and down with thick veins! His balls were the size of tennis balls and hung in a musky, hairy sac! Even soft the cock was massive! He wondered what it looked like when it was erect! <br />
<br />
<br />
Travis took a deep breath and reached down with his right hand and grasped the cock. Uggh it felt really warm and it was sticky with sweat. He felt the rough hairs rub against his hand. Bruce let out a tiny moan and closed his eyes. &quot;Oh yeah, let&#39;s get this started, dude!&quot;. <br />
<br />
<br />
Travis began to pump the huge rod up and down, and within seconds, it was fully erect. It stuck up about 10 inches! It was huge! Travis kept running his hand up and down the thick length. Bruce&#39;s eyes were still closed, and he began to moan a bit. <br />
<br />
<br />
Within a couple minutes, precum began oozing out of the tip and running down the length. Travis was grossed out, but it made stroking it a whole lot easier. <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh fuck yeah, keep going man&quot;, Bruce grunted. He began to hump his hips up a bit into Travis&#39;s strokes, his hairy musky nuts slapping against his hand. Bruce began to grunt harder, and he began to sweat a lot. A thick BO stink wafting off of him. Travis was grossed out and just wanted it to be over.<br />
<br />
<br />
Bruce humped upwards one more time and grunted deeply, and a thick load of cum shot out of his cock. It shot high up into the air and splattered all over Bruce&#39;s hairy stomach. Travis kept his grip, disgusted, as the cock kept shooting more and more jizz out. A few ropes got all over Travis&#39; arm. Finally after 8 or 9 heavy loads, Bruce stopped bucking his hips and relaxed, and laid back down, sweating and panting. <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit dude, thanks. I was pent up and needed that&quot;, Bruce said. Travis looked at his sticky hand and cum covered arm and shuddered. What the fuck had he just done?! Bruce saw the load on his pledges arn; &quot;your not allowed to wash, remember?&quot; He said with a sly grin. &quot;Not allowed to wash?! The fuck, I have your cum all over me!&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
Bruce just laughed; &quot;lick it off or something not my problem. If I see you washing your kicked out if the frat dude, so be careful!&quot;. With that, Bruce got off the couch and walked out of the room. Travis stood there disgusted. His arm had thick sticky cum all over it and his hand was sticky as well. He wiped what he could off on the couch but he still felt sticky and still reeked of cum. What was he getting himself into?!?!?!</p>
