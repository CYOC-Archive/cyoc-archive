<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">8 Year old Zac 's family had recently moved into a new house out in the middle of no-ware, they had been told that it was haunted and that, a young girl named Sarah had died there three years ago, she was only fourteen at the time, and her ghost still remained. Zac believed this and wasn't afraid, he thought it was pretty cool. What was cooler to him was that he got Sarah's old room so he had a chance to see her. There first night there Zac was sleeping when suddenly he herd his name, only it was coming from his own room. He looked around when suddenly a figure appeared in front of him. He was sure it was Sarah. Sure enough it was, as the Sarah's spirit cleared up, Zac saw that she was beautiful. She was pretty for 14 years old, she had long blond, a pretty face with a couple of freckles, she had a small figure along with small b cup breast, she wore a red t shirt that revealed some cleavage, over all she was pretty. Zac was so excited to see an actual ghost. Then she spoke&quot; Who are you&quot;? She asked. Zac told her that his family had just moved in her house and that he had got her room. Sarah soon decided that she could trust him. &quot;I've got a favor to ask of you Zac she said after a while, &quot;What? &quot; Asked Zac. &quot;Well you see, i have some unfinished buisness i needed to take care of before i died but i never got the chance, i could still do it but i would need a body of my own to do it and i was wandering if you would let me borrow yours for a while&quot;. Zac couldn't believe it at first he almost said no but then he decided it would be alright, as long as he got it back. &quot;Okay i guess so&quot; Zac said. Sarah smiled and hovered over his bed, &quot;i should warn you though, in order to completely posses you i will have to change your body into mine&quot;. Zac nodded understanding, he had always wondered what it was like to be a girl. &quot;first things first&quot;Said Sarah, and suddenly a pair of clothes that where the exact thing she was wearing appeared on the side of Zac's bed, &quot;put these on we don't want you to rip anything, remember im much older than you&quot; she said. Zac took a minute to do so, the clothes where very loose on him for now. &quot;Now lay back down in your bed so that this is easier&quot;. He did. &quot;Okay here i come&quot; Sarah said, She hovered over his bed and lowered down into him and completely vanished. For about a minute nothing happened, then suddenly Zac began to fidget around as Sarah began to change him, &quot;Alright lets get taller first&quot; she said from inside his mind, his feet got bigger and his legs elevated making him much taller, Sarah's jeans fit perfectly now, &quot; now for my vagina&quot;, and sure enough he felt his privates disappear and reform into a vagina, then his butt grew wider and more toned , the changes moved upward as Sarah's shirt began to fit him, his hips widened getting more curves, &quot;alright now you'll get my breast, looks like you'll be seeing a pair a lot younger than you thought&quot;, He looked down at his shirt and saw his nipples hardening as they did two buds appeared, next they started to grow into a girls breast, jiggling slightly as they did, they grew to Sara's size which was a b cup, her clothes fit him perfectly now, his arms grew longer and his hands got bigger as his fingers got thinner and longer, &quot;almost done&quot; She said, his Adams apple disappeared and his face changed into Sarah's, his hair changed to blond and it grew down to the middle of her back. The changes stopped as he/she stopped fidgeting and Sarah was back to life again. She got out of the bed and looked at her body, Zac no longer had control over his body but he could still see what Sarah was doing. Sarah smiled at her handiwork. &quot;Now time to take care of some unfinished buisness&quot; she said. She opened the window in Zac's room and began to run to her destination.</p>
