<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the dismissal bell rang, Frieda Knight and Eric Anderson left the library, the latter unaware his parents were at the school. They walked each other to their respective lockers to collect their things, and then went to meet Spencer Lawson at her locker.<br />
&quot;Quite a day, huh?&quot; said Spencer, looking at the two of them with a smile on her face, because even if he couldn&#39;t smell it himself yet, the scent of werepanther was now quite strong coming from Eric.<br />
&quot;Indeed, but we can talk about it on our way to my place,&quot; suggested Frieda, as she led them to where car riders were picked up. It was after 3:30 now, and without a more comforting guide, Eric would start feeling the effects of his first transformation around 5, if the werepanthress had timed her scratch accurately.<br />
&quot;Which one&#39;s yours?&quot; Eric asked, looking around at all the parents there to pick up their students, unless the child was old enough to drive themselves.<br />
&quot;That one,&quot; said Frieda, pointing to the rear of the parked cars lined up to collect passengers.<br />
At first, Eric and Spencer thought Frieda had pointed to a rather decent looking station wagon, but were both surprised when she walked to the larger town car behind it, and was greeted by the chauffeur who was standing by the rear passenger side door.<br />
&quot;Did you have a nice day at school Miss Knight?&quot; he asked, holding the door open for Frieda.<br />
&quot;Indeed John,&quot; was Frieda&#39;s casual reply, for unlike her parents, she liked to be as friendly to the employees as possible. &quot;This is Spencer Lawson and Eric Anderson, my friends and homework buddies for this afternoon. I already contacted Jeffery about the arrangements.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes ma&#39;am. Everything has been prepared as you requested. Sir? Madame?&quot; said the chauffeur, holding the door open for Eric and his girlfriend.<br />
Letting Spencer get in first, the speechless teenagers joined their friend inside the large back seat, put on their seat belts, and rode with Frieda Knight back to her place.<br />
<br />
&quot;Err... Frieda...&quot; began Spencer, trying to take it all in.<br />
&quot;I know. Sorry I didn&#39;t tell you guys earlier,&quot; said Frieda, genuinely apologetic, &quot;but I prefer people to be my friends because they like me and not my family&#39;s wealth or power. Since both of you moved here before the start of the new school year, I figured I had a chance in time since you wouldn&#39;t be up to date on everything concerning Moon Lake, although Julie almost ruined it,&quot; she added, sitting next to Spencer, with Eric on his girlfriend&#39;s right.<br />
&quot;Making friends has never been easy for me, but I understand,&quot; said Eric.<br />
&quot;Being in the military, my dad moved around an awful lot on various deployments, so it wasn&#39;t easy since we never stayed in one place very long. But I&#39;m glad we&#39;re friends now,&quot; added Spencer, reaching out to grab Frieda&#39;s hand while smiling at her.<br />
&quot;Me too,&quot; said Frieda, returning the smile and feeling genuinely happy about having Spencer and Eric in her life. &quot;I know you&#39;re curious, so I&#39;ll tell you right now that after the Tachibanas and their various holdings that comprise Tachibana Enterprises, my folks and Knight Industries are the second most richest and powerful groups in Moon Lake.&quot;<br />
&quot;That don&#39;t matter. All I care about is what&#39;s inside a person, furry or otherwise,&quot; said Eric.<br />
&quot;Me too,&quot; agreed Spencer.<br />
&quot;Good, because we&#39;re almost home and we have a big afternoon ahead of us,&quot; said Frieda, as the car pulled into a long driveway.<br />
<br />
Home to the Knight family was a six bedroom/four bath two story house bigger than the Anderson and Lawson houses put together, sitting on ten acres of property on the outer edge of Moon Lake. In time Frieda&#39;s new friends would also discover the estate had a full size swimming pool, professional tennis court, and the support equipment for both plus a modest cabana that was almost the same size as either of their houses; but that didn&#39;t matter to Eric and Spencer right now as the town car parked beside the front door under a large porch like carport.<br />
John the chauffeur got out and opened the door for his passengers. After thanking him for the ride and telling him his services would be needed later to take Eric and Spencer home for the night, Frieda led them inside.<br />
<br />
The entryway was huge, and Eric couldn&#39;t help but think of the Tara Plantation from when he watched <i>Gone With The Wind</i> with his mother one wintry day back in Minnesota.<br />
As they were greeted by Jeffery the butler, Spencer couldn&#39;t help sniffing to discover that the servants/employees they had met so far were all werepanthers too, but doubted Eric&#39;s budding were senses could detect that yet.<br />
&quot;I have prepared the upstairs day room as you requested madame,&quot; said Jeffery, after introductions were made. &quot;Refreshments are being set up there now.&quot;<br />
&quot;Good, but Jeffery...&quot; began Frieda.<br />
&quot;I know how you feel about the subject, but I am on duty and protocol will not allow me to call you anything more informal than madame,&quot; Jeffery reminded the girl, as he led her party upstairs.<br />
In truth, just about everyone on the Knight&#39;s staff preferred waiting on Frieda compared to her parents, since she treated them like real people instead of just status symbols, but since it was actually the parents who paid them...<br />
Although when any of them were alone, things were more informal, provided her parents never found out.<br />
&quot;Will there be anything else madame?&quot; asked Jeffery, holding the day room door open.<br />
&quot;I have John on standby to provide my guests rides home after we complete our homework, but won&#39;t need him before six at the earliest. Otherwise, I&#39;ll be sure to let you know if there is,&quot; answered Frieda.<br />
&quot;Very well madame. I will be near the intercom in case you call,&quot; said Jeffery and with that, left to go back downstairs.<br />
<br />
Frieda Knight ushered Spencer Lawson and Eric Anderson into the day room before she closed and locked the door. Her guests couldn&#39;t help noticing the small table of refreshments, mostly finger food snacks, bottled water, and canned sodas, especially since Eric still never managed to get any lunch today with everything going on.<br />
After the three of them sat their backpacks down on the other table&#39;s cloth covered surface so they could do their homework, although that&#39;s not why they were really there, Eric helped himself to a few munchies to please his empty stomach as Spencer grabbed a bottle of water.<br />
&quot;Now then,&quot; began Frieda, as both teenagers turned to face her. The fact that she had unbuttoned her blouse and removed her bra, exposing her well formed B sized breasts was not lost on either of them.<br />
Nor was the fact that Frieda&#39;s nipples were quite erect and hard in anticipation of what was about to happen. While she didn&#39;t have any on her face, the appearance of small freckles across the upper portion of her chest and what was visible of her shoulders complimented her red hair and added to her striking beauty.<br />
&quot;I believe we have more pressing... matters to address,&quot; she added, wrapping her arms around Eric before giving him a deep, passionate kiss.<br />
<br />
Spencer could see Frieda&#39;s tongue slip into Eric&#39;s mouth, but considering why the three of them were there, she was far from jealous or angry.<br />
In fact, Spencer was starting to get turned on as Frieda ended the kiss.<br />
&quot;You&#39;re right Spencer, Eric IS quite a kisser,&quot; agreed Frieda, before she turned and kissed the hybrid werewolf/panthress/cat.<br />
Eric had been surprised when Frieda had stuck her tongue in his mouth, but while he didn&#39;t know what to do in return, enjoyed the moment.<br />
Watching his girlfriend and Frieda kiss, coupled by the fact that both seemed to know what to do with their tongue in someone else&#39;s mouth, was making his penis start to stir and complain about the confines of his pants.<br />
&quot;You know, you&#39;re no slouch in the kissing department yourself, but Eric still needs to learn how to properly French,&quot; said Frieda, after their lips parted.<br />
&quot;Something I&#39;m sure we can teach him before the afternoon is over,&quot; agreed Spencer, eyeing Frieda&#39;s breasts and wondering how they tasted.<br />
&quot;So how do you guys want to proceed?&quot; asked Frieda, as she casually removed her blouse to be totally topless before her friends.</p>
