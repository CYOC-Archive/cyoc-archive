<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">On waking up, and long before she had any thoughts about brushing her teeth or jumping into the shower, Victoria brought up and pointed the chrome rifle at herself. Turning the dial to eleven, or four since it didn’t currently go higher. As a petite girl, not even a shortstack, with mousy hair and glasses she was a total and complete nerd, and not necessarily the cute kind either. At least if she listened to the critical voices in her head. Self-consciousness and Anxiety had brought her this far, and even given her this idea in the first place. <br />
<br />
With a last goodbye to those two companions that she hoped to lose along with most of her inhibitions, the young scientist then formed an image of her ideal self in her head. Her sensors on the handle then translating and modulating the older, more mature, and actual woman rather than a kid in her mid-teens she wanted to become to the interior computer. The particle beam was meant for a quick burst, but when Vicky pressed the trigger her entire body locked up, a purple laser connecting them until the battery out fizzled and the Lesbianizer tumbled from the scientist’s hands. <br />
<br />
A last observation about not shooting moving targets did enter her before she felt herself increasingly loosing control of her body. But Vicki cackled. loving this feeling welling up inside of her as the changes started. <br />
<br />
Puckered with tiny imperfections, scratch marks, and anything else that had marred her skin over the years drained away beneath the wave of lustrously bronzed and silken flesh that rippled out of her elongating limb and cracking bones as she grew half-a-dozen inches. Meanwhile as her body added years, so did her mind fill with all kinds of neural connections that spurred on her maturation and intelligence. She was still a horny teen. Just older. And far, far, far worse now, that nothing like anxiety stood in her way of bedding the first and best woman she laid her eyes on. Victoria slipped a few fingers down into her sex. Working two of them as team into her dripping passage. <br />
<br />
Her digits lengthened, previously short and stubby they were now slender and articulate enough to dance across the most complex piano arrangements or to push to deeper into her slit. Vicki moaned as she chose to explore latter, letting her imagination run wild with images of her roommate and the cheerleaders. Stripping Georgina of her cheerleader outfit one piece at a time. The scientist bit her plump and kissable lower lip, or maybe it’d be better if she kept it on. Thinking about kissing her way down the Samantha&#39;s slender waist was accompanied by a pinch around her torso, followed by a sharp and shuddering exhalation as her entire physique flared or folded with more and increasingly waspish and buxom curves. <br />
<br />
Just by the weight of her blossoming breasts resting against her chest, Victoria knew they were huge. Feeling the firm titflesh still yielding to her touch was amazing. But it was like her entire body listened to her, every limb was immovable until a writhing spasm, though they were fewer now, or she decided to bend them almost whichever way she wanted. And whatever pudginess she had in her hips and ass was still there in the supple and packed thickness. It was followed by a few more cracks as her body’s proportions adjusted to a statuesque ideal with a perfect waistline.<br />
<br />
Victoria felt herself cumming, gushing juices spurting in time with the sloppy stirring of her hand and fingers over her sex. The orgasm felt far more intense than anything she had ever experienced. Her chest heaved, the teen could just listen to the husky and resonant groans slipping out of her mouth forever. Her voice dripped with sex, even riding her post-orgasmic glow, hearing it made her desperately want to finger fuck herself again. Vicki barely held on and resisted the urge to have her thumb doing unspeakably lewd things to her clit. God and her mind was a mess! Even her vision was blurry. No, wait. Victoria, took of her glasses and immediately her vision cleared. It was possibly even better than before.<br />
<br />
Rising up from the floor, the teen woman felt the ease at which her body moved to her wardrobe. The clothes were boring, but a nerdy t-shirt riding midway up your abdomen and a pair of jeans short that barely fit and dug deep into her ass, was something she definitely looked great in. Vicki stripped, enjoying that almost as much as trying the clothes and rushed over to the shower. Since it was the weekend, Sam was sleeping off the stressful week and whatever alcohol she drank last night. And it meant her roommate could take her time to explore more.<br />
<br />
Vicki barely had to brush or dab her blonde hair before the long locks and curls were dry, full of volume, and without any stray strands to the ruin the immaculate impression. Although she had enjoyed her brown and shorter hairstyle this was something she could live with. But her eyes, formerly a hazel shade, was now lilac. The scientist concentrated on them, focusing her entire attention on the irises until she could see them glowing. With the increasing luminosity, she felt her body flush while her head was sent spinning with sapphic scenarios and ideas. <br />
<br />
Despite no longer focusing and her eyes returning to a relative normal starring into her reflection made goosebumps spread all over Victoria’s richly tanned skin. Speculating and working through the possible scenarios led the scientist in her to believe that she had become a walking Lesbianizer. She could repair the old one, but why carry around a ridiculous looking (and secretly kinda cool) nerf gun when she could cause mischief and have her revenge without any tools. Not much of a mad lesbian scientist without a few of those.<br />
<br />
Victoria’s smile before she turned away was both absolutely angelic and innocent.</p>
