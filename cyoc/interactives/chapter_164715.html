<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Aye, we could visit a hotel. Those places are usually filled to the brim with sticks in the mud. Don&#39;tcha agree, Mini-Me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Derek shook his head, ginger curls bouncing at the edge of his vision. He didn&#39;t think he&#39;d ever get used to that... or any of the rest of it. He sincerely hoped he wouldn&#39;t have to.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please don&#39;t call me that...&quot; Derek muttered weakly.<br />
<br />
Mavis clapped her hands onto her belly and laughed uproariously. Derek blushed. He really didn&#39;t think it was that funny.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I can&#39;t call ya Derek, can I? Whaddaya wanna be called, lassie?&quot;<br />
<br />
What kind of question was that? How was he supposed to come up with an answer for that? He really didn&#39;t want to be called anything but his own name. He never should have gone into that shop...<br />
<br />
&quot;Um... call me... Dawn,&quot; he finally settled on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dawn! A pretty name for a beautiful woman.&quot;<br />
<br />
Derek frowned deeply. Being called a woman was deeply disconcerting, but he was afraid to protest, for fear of Mavis taking offense and changing him again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, cutie, you don&#39;t have to worry about that. You&#39;re gonna stay that way for a while, trust me. Besides, we&#39;re even now. Whaddaya say we go have fun? Why don&#39;t you lead me to your nearest inn?&quot;<br />
<br />
Well, knowing that he wasn&#39;t gonna change again was both comforting and worrying. But it was probably best to just go along with Mavis and stay on her good side. <br />
<br />
The way to the local hotel was an exhausting affair. Derek was so much shorter now, and the unfamiliar heels he was forced to wear hurt his feet. The underwear she&#39;d given him was riding up into his crotch, a constant reminder of his new gender. All in all, it was an awful experience, but he was sure that was the point.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, here it is. &#39;Sunwave Inn&#39;? What kind of nonsense...&quot; Mavis muttered, mostly to herself. She wasn&#39;t paying much attention to Derek anymore. Maybe he could just run away... but then he&#39;d be stuck like this. He should just stick it out...<br />
<br />
&quot;There probably won&#39;t be too many people checking in right now... it&#39;s not even one...&quot;<br />
<br />
Mavis shrugged.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll work with what we have. There&#39;s always someone. Besides, we&#39;re here to check in. We will be spending the night here, after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;O-oh.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mavis winked at Derek, her intentions clear. How would that even work, though? Ah, maybe he shouldn&#39;t get his hopes up...<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, get them up. I don&#39;t mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
The tingling between his legs grew. Oh, he was wet now. Mmf...<br />
<br />
No, he had to control himself. They had to get a room first. If she wasn&#39;t just teasing. How could you ever really know with a mischief spirit?<br />
<br />
&quot;Wouldn&#39;t ya like to know? Come on then, let&#39;s see what we have to work with!&quot;<br />
<br />
She slapped Derek on the ass, forcing him forward into the air-conditioned lobby of the medium-sized hotel. There weren&#39;t too many people in the lobby at all, and only one of them turned to look at him at all, a thin, bespectacled man in a long brown trench-coat. He reminded Derek a little bit of a TV detective. There were only two other people in the room besides the receptionist, a well-groomed blonde woman accompanied by a tiny little dog sitting in her purse and a stressed looking man with his hands buried deep in his pockets as he waited to be seen by the receptionist.<br />
<br />
Mavis brushed past Derek and all three of the people waiting in line to lean forward on the receptionist&#39;s desk.<br />
<br />
&quot;A room for two, please. Me and my sister, Dawn, are tired and need a place to rest.&quot;<br />
<br />
The receptionist looked confused, and the blonde looked downright furious.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I was talking to her! Back of the line, ginger. Wait your freaking turn!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mavis rolled her eyes, and with a snap of her fingers, the blonde was enveloped in a cloud of blue mist. When it dissipated, the girl had seemingly disappeared-- but her clothes and her purse had not. They hung in the air for a moment before collapsing into a pile at Mavis&#39; feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you--&quot; Derek started, only to be cut off by Mavis pressing a finger against her lips and a meaningful look. Derek turned back towards the pile of clothing and the now abandoned dog and gasped.<br />
<br />
There, sticking out of the fancy collar of the woman&#39;s pink dress was the familiar shape of a a dog treat. <br />
<br />
&quot;Did you just turn her into--&quot;<br />
<br />
Mavis nodded, a wicked grin on her face.<br />
<br />
Derek&#39;s eyes went real wide. She wasn&#39;t messing around.<br />
<br />
The dog crept out of the purse, enticed by the smell of the newly present dog treat. It sniffed at the collar for a moment before licking its chops and snapping the former woman up in its mouth. Two bites later, and it disappeared down its gullet. The dog looked around for a moment before leaning back and scratching its ear with a back leg.<br />
<br />
&quot;You just killed her!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mavis shook her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like I said, no killing. I&#39;ve got her. She&#39;ll come back, one way or another.&quot;<br />
<br />
Derek was a little wary of that statement, but he let it slide for now. What else could he do?<br />
<br />
But Mavis wasn&#39;t done yet. She moved onto the stressed looking man. Her eyes turned blue as she focused down on him. He cried out as the blue glow overcame him. He grew shorter (of course), curvier (no duh), and his hair grew down to his shoulders. It also turned pink...what? Unlike the previous transformations Derek had observed, and his own, the man&#39;s clothes changed with him-- from a t-shirt and jeans to what appeared to be a maid&#39;s dress. Something, or rather, two somethings, twitched at the top of his head. Cat ears! And there was something jutting out from just above the new girl&#39;s skirt. A tail, just as pink as her hair.<br />
<br />
The former man looked down at himself, horrified by the sudden and massive change.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you do to me nya? My voice? You&#39;ve got to be kitten me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A cat-girl maid? Why a cat-girl maid?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mavis shrugged.<br />
<br />
&quot;This place is filthy. It could use a good cleaning.&quot;<br />
<br />
The girl&#39;s wide eyes watered.<br />
<br />
&quot;B-but I&#39;m nya-ot on staff, nya!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mavis shrugged again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Figure it out. And now for you,&quot; she said, immediately refocusing in on the man in the trench-coat at the back of the line. He held up his hands, scared stiff.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think you&#39;re a man. You&#39;re not even a boy. All you are is three little girls stacked on top of each other, pretending to be older than they are.&quot;<br />
<br />
The man only had the chance to look confused for a moment before he too was enveloped in the blue glow. When it cleared, nothing seemed different, at first. Sure, his face looked a little rounder, his hair a little softer, but it wasn&#39;t until he started to move that Derek realized just how much had changed.<br />
<br />
He looked confused as his body beneath the collar of the trench-coat began to shift-- and then he fell apart. He flopped backwards, off the shoulders of a blonde-haired girl  and a much shorter girl with glasses and brown hair. Both of them looked just as confused as he did, taking a quick look down at their hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you do to me?&quot; All three chorused at once.<br />
<br />
Mavis shook her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s gonna get annoying real quick. Let&#39;s get a bit of individuality here, shall we?&quot; <br />
<br />
Another snap of her fingers, and the girls seemed to be quite a bit less coordinated. <br />
<br />
&quot;This is... oh my god, how is this happening? Who are you girls?&quot; The one who had been the head asked the others.<br />
<br />
The blonde shook her head, gaping in horror at the pink dress she was clad in. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m... I&#39;m you...&quot;<br />
<br />
Glasses nodded too.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, me too... oh my god, this is so strange. I&#39;m myself, but I&#39;m remembering things about being this girl... and about you two...I&#39;m Daisy... and you&#39;re Jennifer,&quot; she said, pointing towards the blonde, &quot;and you&#39;re Matilda. But you prefer Mattie.&quot;<br />
<br />
They seemed to realize and accept this at around the same time, which was a marvel to see. Mavis was really, really freaking powerful. It was frightening and... slightly arousing? <br />
<br />
*Man, what is wrong with me?*<br />
<br />
Mavis turned her attention back towards the receptionist, a mischievous glint in her eye.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, any questions?&quot;<br />
<br />
The receptionist shook her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope, here&#39;s your room key, enjoy! Have a nice day, you two!&quot;<br />
<br />
She practically pressed the room key into Mavis&#39; hands before sprinting off into the employee&#39;s-only door behind her. Probably wise, although Derek doubted distance would do anything to stop Mavis&#39; powers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, what a nice young lass. Shall we head upstairs?&quot;<br />
<br />
Derek nodded, dumbfounded.</p>
