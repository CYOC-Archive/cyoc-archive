<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff’s computer was moving at its normally slow rate. He made a mental note to see if the new device could change his computer into something better as well. But he now sat naked in front of his computer, slowly changing into something else. <br />
<br />
Not wanting to fall again and make noise, Jeff rolled his chair back in front of the mirror. He was just in time to watch, and feel, his ears start to move up to the top of his head. No cap will hide the triangled, fur covered ears. Brown fur continued to cover his body, becoming just a few shads lighter on his stomach and thighs, and just a few shades darker going up his back, from his hair down to his butt crack.  <br />
The cramping feeling came back, and Jeff almost dug his new claws into the seat of his chair. His eyes squint from the pressure as his muscles start tensing up and growing. He felt stronger as his muscles grew, but also restricted in this half-transformed body. <br />
<br />
Jeff looks over at his computer, and it has just barely come back up. He starts to roll his chair back to the computer when his feet started to stretch out. He lifts them both up and pushes them out as his feet lengthen and thicken. Still in view of the mirror, he sees pads grow on the balls of his feet as they stretch out and his toes inflate. His toenails turn claws as fur covers everything up.  Jeff thinks, from what he looks like so far, that he must be some sort of canine, hoping it was the wolf option that he pressed.<br />
<br />
Then Jeff feels cramping in the one spot his should have thought of first. He looks down at his young man hood, seeing in and his balls twitch as the cramping surged through it. He wraps his changed hands around the handles of his chair, to try and not damage them, as his balls start to stretch and inflate. Jeff lets out a small moan, barely audible, as they grew several sizes. A much finer layer of light brown fur covered them and went up his penis. His penis itself, soft from the thought of being seen by his mother or sister in this state, starts to thicken at its base. His cut foreskin seemed to grow back and encase his member’s head before the whole cock starts to inflate. Almost like watching a balloon be inflated, the three-inch-tall penis thickens wildly as fur starts to cover it, growing to look like an inflatable soda can.<br />
Jeff’s eyes then grew wider as the unseen changes inside the new sheath started to happen.  No longer able to sit in the chair, Jeff does his best to gently fall to the floor on his hands and knees. His hips start to thrust in and out as the changes to his manhood take place inside the sheath, thinking and lengthening. Now breathing heavily, Jeff feels and hears as the skin on his new sheath stretches to release the creation within.  He looks under himself to see a red tip slowly push out. He grits his sharp teeth to hold back a moan of pleasure as the new rod makes its way out. Thick as the sheath, new red cock pulses with veins as it grows out. <br />
<br />
But when it reaches what Jeff would think is halfway, his faces tremors and looks forward. His nose turns leathery and black, as the rest of the light and dark brown fur grows in. His nose and mouth start to push out, to the beginning of a muzzle, stopping about midway. As the changes slowed, Jeff looks back down at himself, seeing a six-inch monster now out of his sheath, his new knot still hiding in the sheath, but stretching it to its limit. <br />
<br />
Jeff does his best to stand up, wobbly on his new footpads. He looks himself over, seeing more beast then boy. He carefully walks over to his computer, moving his chair a safe distance from him if he would fall due to more changes. He quickly brings up the Chronivac app, waiting for it to load. When it does come up, it reads “transformation in progress” and gives the option to return to the page. He clicks on in and reads the stats on the page. <br />
<br />

<br />
Jeff leans his hands on his desk as he reads as the transformation percentage jumps. His fingers, the last of his human features, cramp as they start to thicken. He watches as they both simultaneously gain muscles and grow paw pads. He watches them stretch and widen, growing larger and more paw like, but retaining their dexterity. <br />
<br />
 That was when Jeff felt a pull on his tail bone. Jeff arches back, pushing his large cock onto the desk all the way up to where his tip touched the screen. His body pulses as his tail starts to stretch out and become full of fur. At the same time, his muscles ripple again, all parts of him bulking out. His thighs, calves, and arms thicken with new strength. His chest pushes out as his abs grow under the fur. Even his neck thickens as the tip of his tail reaches the floor. <br />
<br />
Breathing deeply, Jeff looks down to see that he was only at 95% completion. As sone as he thought to himself what else was needed, his face started to push out again. Jeff bears his growing teeth, now becoming fully canine. His small muzzle pushes out more, become more definitely of a young German Shepherd. <br />
<br />
As the computer reads 100%, Jeff felt an urge start to come from his groin. He faces himself to the corner of his room where he keeps his dirty clothes as his knot finally pushes out of the sheath. The raging member expands and stretches out one last time as Jeff grabs hold of its base with his right paw. Soon, a flood of seed rushes out, all over his pile of clothes. <br />
<br />
Jeff holds back a howl with his other hand as even his tail becomes erect from the new sensation of the large werewolf cock. As the gusher slows down, Jeffs breathes slowly as his tail starts to lightly wag. He walks over to the pile of dirty clothes and pics up a towel to wipe off his new penis before he hears a gasp at the door. <br />
<br />
Jeff turns around to find his mom standing there with a plate of food.</p>
