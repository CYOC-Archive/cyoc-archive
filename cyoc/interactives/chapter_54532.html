<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You are Alba Arriola and you're a seventeen year old girl. You wore glasses and people constantly called you Four Eyes. &quot;They can be so immature,&quot; you said angrily as you mixed a couple of chemicals and thinking about the two girls who had called you Four Eyes just a little while ago. You were smart which served to isolate you from most other people and right now you were trying to determine how super beings did what they did. It had to be some sort of chemical reaction that allowed them to fly or whatever else they did. The super beings had just started appearing a few days ago and you had become fascinated by them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey this is the illegal's place,&quot; a male voice said outside your house.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look at them flying the flag trying to look like Americans,&quot; another male voice said.<br />
<br />
Your hands began to shake with anger. You were born and raised here as was your mother. Your great-grandparents had immigrated to the US the legal way when your grandparents were young. It really made you angry when people assumed that you were here illegally just because you had a Hispanic heritage. &quot;Arrogant bastards,&quot; you muttered under your breath putting down the chemicals you were holding.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well well well Four Eyes,&quot; the first male said directly behind you.<br />
<br />
You whirled around and asked, &quot;How did you get in here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The door was unlocked,&quot; the second male said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well get out before I call the cops and have you arrested for trespassing,&quot; you said reaching your hand under the table for the panic button you had there.<br />
<br />
&quot;We're not the ones trespassing,&quot; the first male said with a scowl, &quot;but I think you can do a little something for us and maybe we won't call immigration.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not an illegal alien,&quot; you said angrily searching for the panic button.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's what all you illegals say,&quot; the second male said grabbing your hand just as you found the panic button and pulling you toward him. &quot;You should go back to Mexico where you belong or better yet you can go to hell. Though before you go we'll screw you because we can.&quot;<br />
<br />
You struggled in his grip but he was stronger than you were. The first guy began taking your clothes off while you were being held. You kicked as hard as you could and yelled for help but it didn't do any good. Soon they had stripped all your clothes off of you. &quot;Only an A cup,&quot; the first guy said reading the tag on your bra. &quot;This proves you're not an American since American girls have at least D cup racks to play with. Oh well it's not like I'm going to go out with you I just need to screw something.&quot;<br />
<br />
You struggled harder as the first guy unzipped and pulled out his erect dick. He cleared your table in a sweep of his arm not caring what may happen when the chemicals mixed together. The second guy placed you on the table with your ass on the edge and made you lay down. The first guy grabbed your legs and forced them open lining up his dick with your pussy. With no regard for you he thrust into you tearing your vagina and causing you pain. You cried out for him to stop because he was hurting you but he didn't and he kept thrusting in and out. After about ten minutes he finally came inside of you and pulled out. He smiled and said, &quot;Well look at that, I popped her cherry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You lucky bastard,&quot; the second guy said chuckling. &quot;Now hold her down so I can screw her.&quot;<br />
<br />
They switched and the second guy began to screw you. This wasn't what you thought your first time would be like. You had wanted a guy that would be considerate and make sure you were ready before entering you. Instead you get gang raped by a couple of guys who thought you weren't quite human. Finally the second guy finished and said, &quot;Well we're almost finished here.&quot; The first guy stood you up and held you while you watched the second guy take out a knife and say, &quot;You may have been a good screw but now it's time for you to die. Can't have you taking a job or food from an American.&quot; With that he plunged the knife into your gut and wiggled it around then withdrew it.<br />
<br />
You started feeling light-headed within a few seconds. The first guy said, &quot;In a couple of minutes you'll be dead bitch. Cherish the last moments of your pathetic life.&quot; With that he threw you down on the ground into the puddle formed by the chemicals. They laughed and walked away as your vision faded.<br />
<br />
The last thing you heard was your mom yelling, &quot;Alba no!&quot;<br />
<br />
It was sometime later when you regained consciousness. You were laying on something hard and it was dark. Somehow you sensed that you were in a rectangular space a bit bigger than your body. Given what had happened that could only mean that you were in the morgue. You wondered if they had performed an autopsy on you yet then you had to wonder how long you'd be staying in here. If the autopsy hadn't been performed yet then it could be soon.<br />
<br />
You heard a door opening close by and someone say, &quot;This one will fetch a good price.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes she will,&quot; another guy said. &quot;This one says Alba Arriola.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds like a stripper,&quot; the first guy said chuckling.<br />
<br />
You became furious that they thought you were a stripper because of your name. You heard the door to the locker you were in open and felt the table being pulled out as the second guy said, &quot;Well if she's in good shape she'll bring us some good money.&quot; The sheet was pulled off and the guy shined a flashlight on your face then exclaimed, &quot;What the hell?!?&quot;<br />
<br />
Both men backed up as you sat up and faced them. It was then that you noticed something strange. You could the men in front of you, the lockers behind you, and your own ears in part of your vision. You hopped off the table and spotted a mirror in the dim light. Walking over to it you were shocked to see you had one eye right above your nose, an eye on either side of your head just in front of your ears, and when you turned around an eye in the back of your head. You literally had four eyes now.<br />
<br />
You ran out of the morgue into the night leaving the two guys staring after your naked form. Finally you stopped and took stock of your situation. You needed clothes and the best place to get them would be from your house. However your family certainly thought that you were dead and you couldn’t blame them since you had been dead. Looking down you saw no sign of the knife wound or autopsy incisions. &quot;So I can regenerate even after death,&quot; you muttered. &quot;I wonder what else I can do.&quot; After a little experimenting you found you were stronger than before and maybe a little smarter. Other than that it didn't look like you had any other powers. You didn't run across any weaknesses in your experiments and that worried you. Trying to put any weaknesses you may have to the back of your mind you headed home hoping that your family didn't freak out.<br />
<br />
As you approached your house you wondered how you should enter. Aware of your current state of nudity you didn't think it would be a good idea to go in the front door. That left your bedroom window on the second floor. Going around back you found the tree that grew close to your window and jumped up into it. You peered into your bedroom and were glad when you found no one in it and everything as you had left it earlier including your window being unlocked. You jumped to your window and grabbed the sill. You lightly thumped against the wall and opened your window. You climbed inside and went to your dresser where you took out a pair of pink cotton panties, pink bra, tight jeans, and a red tee. You were about to put them on when your door opened and your dad stepped in with a gun. &quot;Hi Dad,&quot; you said blushing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alba?&quot; your dad asked with a shocked look on his. &quot;It can't be. You’re dead.”<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I'm alive now,&quot; you said still blushing. &quot;Uh could you leave so I can get dressed?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh sure,&quot; your dad said stepping out and closing the door.<br />
<br />
You dressed and went downstairs to face your family. Your mom and dad were sitting on the couch, your nine year old brother Jose was sitting in a chair, and your thirteen year old sister Lupita was sitting in your favorite chair. They looked at you and you said, &quot;I'm home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But how and why do you look like that?&quot; your mom asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not sure,&quot; you said shrugging your shoulders. &quot;I think that it might have something to do with the chemicals that I was working with.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you see out of your eyes?&quot; Lupita asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I can and it's a little weird to be seeing out of four eyes,&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where's your other eye?&quot; your dad asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;In the back of my head,&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You really are Four Eyes now,&quot; Lupita said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you still need glasses?&quot; Jose asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't seem to,&quot; you said kind of missing your glasses.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well now that you're alive you need to go to the police,&quot; your mom said.<br />
<br />
&quot;The police can't do much Mom,&quot; you said shaking your head. &quot;As you pointed out I'm alive so charging them with murder is out. I don't have any cuts or bruises so assault is out and I'm sure there are no signs of rape anymore so that's out too. The only thing we might be able to get them on is trespassing and vandalism.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They recovered semen from you and they've already written the Death Certificate,&quot; your mom said. &quot;They have to be able to prosecute the ones that raped and murdered you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't think they'll be able to do anything,&quot; you said shaking your head. &quot;There's no procedure for someone dying and then coming back to life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They have to be able to do something,&quot; your dad said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe but I have something in mind for them,&quot; you said. You had been thinking about what you could do to make those guys pay on your way home.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're going to kill them?&quot; your mom asked shocked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not going to kill them,&quot; you said with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you going to do with them then?&quot; your dad asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm pretty sure I can make something that will transform them,&quot; you said smiling, &quot;into what I haven't decided yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you're going to take the law into you own hands,&quot; your dad said sounding a bit disappointed.<br />
<br />
&quot;If I'm right they won't get much jail time and then they'll be free to do what they did to me to another girl,&quot; you said looking down. &quot;I'll do whatever I can to make sure that doesn't happen. If the law can do that then I won't do anything but I believe that I'll have to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm going to get an orange,&quot; Lupita said. &quot;Anyone else want one?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do,&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
No one else wanted one so Lupita got up and went to the kitchen. While she was gone Jose asked, &quot;Can you give me powers Alba?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I might be able to,&quot; you said, &quot;though I don't know if I can give you specific powers or what form you'd have if I can give you powers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're not going to experiment on your brother,&quot; your mom said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wasn't planning on it,&quot; you said rolling your eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alba catch,&quot; Lupita said as she tossed an orange your way.<br />
<br />
You caught the orange and once it touched your skin you collapsed to the floor unable to move. You stopped breathing and it was like you were dead again. &quot;Alba!&quot; your mom said coming over to you. She took the orange from your hand and you immediately started breathing again.<br />
<br />
You sat up with a smile and said, &quot;I guess I can't touch an orange now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your mom hugged you and after a bit everyone went to bed.</p>
