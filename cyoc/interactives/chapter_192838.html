<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There wasn’t a chance to tell Michael who she really was as they got out of the taxi. After Michael had paid the driver, Tom found herself following Michael as he sought the meeting spot with Bill. Because of the short steps she had to take (Caused by the leather pencil dress) she struggled to keep up with her brother who had finally stopped and turned to see where she was. <br />
<br />
Michael chuckled inwardly as he watched his wife hurry after him in her short steps. The things women did in the name of fashion. He was amazed actually that she wasn’t in particularly high heels. Usually Kerry favored the bigger heels. However, the ones she was wearing did look good. They must be relatively comfortable. He pushed open the door to the club and held it for Kerry. He was aware he shouldn’t have outpaced her as he sought the correct door. He should have stayed and held her hand. It was little things like that which could annoy her and potentially blow his chances for later in the night. Hopefully holding the door open might retrieve some of the brownie points he had just lost.<br />
<br />
Tom found herself in a foyer of a grand old hotel. She knew there had been a change of venue but hadn’t paid attention when Michael had spoken to the taxi driver. She did not see Bill or Margie and did not know which direction to head.<br />
Then to her horror Michael took her hand and led her to the reception desk. She had no choice but to follow. “We are here to meet with Bill Windsor” <br />
<br />
“Off course sir. He is waiting for you in the Charleston bar” The man pointed to a glass doorway. <br />
Michael, still holding Tom’s hand, led her through the doorway and immediately they spotted Bill seated on a comfy lounge. Bill arose and approached the couple. Before she could react Tom was given a kiss on the cheek by Bill who commented “All dressed up like a Tigress. I like it” He then turned and shook hands with Michael. “Sorry for the change in venue. We got caught up at a luncheon. Margie will be down in a minute. This is a lovely quiet bar. I find the pubs near the ground so noisy. Take a seat” <br />
<br />
It was certainly quiet at the moment. They were the only patrons. Tom realized the men were waiting for her to sit first. She did so as elegantly as possible on the lounge Bill indicated. Michael then sat beside her and Bill sat in the single seater he had been seated in when they had arrived. <br />
<br />
“I’ve never actually been here before. Hasn’t this been converted to a private club?” asked Michael<br />
<br />
“It is. We have a suite that we use as our city base. I have to be in town a lot for business” He turned to Tom. “We live down on the peninsula but it’s such a long drive back home. Now what drinks would you like? I noticed you were drinking bubbly the other night”<br />
<br />
That was one of the drinks Kerry had told Tom her taste-buds would like. “That would be lovely please” she replied.<br />
<br />
Bill clicked his fingers and in seconds a waiter was at his side. “Two glasses of Moet and a scotch for me. What’s your fancy Michael?”<br />
<br />
“A scotch would be nice”<br />
<br />
The waiter left just in time for Margie to make her entrance. Margie was a tall woman of about 40 who was an ex model. Tom estimated she was probably 20 years younger than Bill. She looked like she was dressed for a night at the opera rather than a night at the football. She was in a long gown which would have been apt for Kate’s dinner dance and was dripping in jewels. Bill stood up upon noticing her, approached her, greeted her with a kiss and led her across. Michael also got up and greeted Margie with a kiss on the cheek. Tom didn’t know how to greet Margie. She stood as well. Margie came across and gave Tom a hug and a pretend kiss on each cheek. Her lips didn’t actually touch.<br />
<br />
Tom stammered out something perhaps Kerry might say “You look gorgeous. I feel under dressed”<br />
<br />
“No dear, I think what your wearing is most appropriate. I’m totally overdressed but Bill wants me to make an impression on some potential business collaborators who we should meet. Everything we do is about impressions” Tom didn’t quite understand the nuances of what Margie was saying. She realized the men were waiting for the ladies to sit down. Eventually she resumed her seat.<br />
<br />
The drinks arrived almost as soon as Tom had resumed her seat. Sipping on the champagne gave Tom the excuse to just listen to the conversation, mainly between Michael and Bill about the team selection. She clearly was not going to get a chance to tell Michael who she really was. Best just to try and continue the charade. Eventually though Margie aimed a question at her. “Do you go to the football often?”<br />
 <br />
Fortunately, Tom knew the answer. “Michael attends most home games with his brother. I probably go about 3 or 4 times a year. I am a lifelong fan though and can get a bit excitable” Tom thought she would have to explain in advance that she would likely get absorbed in the game. It would be hard not to yell at the players and umpires as was her usual habit. It would not be appropriate to do so in Kerry’s body. Nor in the corporate box where apparently there might be other guests.<br />
<br />
“I’ll admit I get excited myself watching those young athletic bodies running around the field. That’s an aspect of the game I don’t think the guys get” Margie tittered as she spoke quietly to Tom so her voice did not carry to the men. Apparently, Margie assumed that Tom’s use of the word ‘excitable’ was in a sexual way. Tom found herself blushing. “Did you know I attended the 2008 best and fairest awards as Richo’s date. That was the night I first met Bill”<br />
<br />
That sparked Tom’s interest. Not only was Richo a past club champion he was also Tom&#39;s childhood hero and Kerry’s heart-throb. She knew exactly how the real Kerry would have responded to that statement. “Now you have made me very envious. I loved Richo. He was always my favourite. I grew up with posters of him on my wall” That was certainly true for Tom. He suspected it was also true for Kerry who had always been a Tiger supporter. <br />
<br />
“It was the night he met Jackie the girl he eventually married. I was heartbroken when he abandoned me to dance with this brunette. Well I wasn’t really dumped as it was an arranged date. We were not actually an item. And it was a date that my manager arranged to try and reignite my modelling career. Did you know such dates could be organised?”<br />
<br />
“I have to plead my ignorance” Tom replied. “Had I known you could buy a date with Richo, I might have pawned my life savings. Not that Richo would have wanted an 11 year old date” That was the sort of comment the real Kerry would have made.<br />
<br />
Margie laughed. “Well it didn’t turn out so bad. Like I said that was the night I met Bill and life has been pretty good since then”<br />
<br />
Tom waited to see if Margie was going to elaborate further. It seemed not.<br />
<br />
The waiter put another glass of champagne in front of Tom. She had not realized the other glass she had been holding was empty. Margie’s original glass was half full.<br />
<br />
“So what business is Bill involved with?” Tom wasn’t sure if that was the sort of thing women asked each other.<br />
<br />
“He has many different types of investment. The corporate box and sponsorship is part of the insurance business. Do you know AJG? But he also has stakes in many other pies. He was left a fortune by his father and has done very well”<br />
<br />
“I know I shouldn’t pry but who are the people we are meeting tonight? The other guests in the box that you are wanting to impress?”<br />
<br />
“A Chinese businessman Han Soo and some of his family. One daughter has been studying over here and we found out she has become a Tiger’s fan but never been to a game. Bill is looking to get Han Soo to invest in one of our companies. Evidently the whole family is over here for the daughter’s graduation.</p>
