<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Keith had just finished his gym class at school. Though he had turned 18 the month before, he looks like he is 15. He is skinny with no muscles at all, a bit of baby fat around his stomach, hardly any hair on his body, and a cock that, when fully erect, is only 2 inches long and not much thicker than a pencil.<br /> <br /> He had purposefully dragged behind the rest of his classmates on their way back to the lockerroom. He avoided them as much as possible but was always tormented by his peers because of his body. He hoped that most of the boys would be gone by the time he got in, so he could just grab his clothes and duck into a stall to change.<br /> <br /> Before he could get to his locker he felt someone grab him from behind, while someone yanked down his gym shorts and underwear. All the boys in the locker room stood around him laughing at his tiny cock, shouting insults. Adam, the boy who was holding him had his friends, Steve and James, hold Keith's arms so that he couldn't try to cover up.<br /> <br /> &quot;Look at the little baby-dick!&quot; yelled one boy in the crowd.<br /> <br /> &quot;Better be careful Adam, wouldn't want to accidentally snap it off!&quot; cried another.<br /> <br /> &quot;Hey that gives me an idea,&quot; said Adam. He reached between Keith's legs and grabbed his diminuitive cock and balls, and pulled them behind him, so that Keith now looked like he had nothing at all.<br /> <br /> Someone cleared their throat, the coach had entered the room. &quot;Now boys, knock it off. You may be on the lacrosse team, but if you don't hurry you'll be late for you next class.&quot; The coach smiled, showing no concern for Keith's predicament. &quot;And I'm not writing any passes, so you boys get a move on&quot; then the coach turned and walked back to his office.<br /> <br /> The boys started to move back to their lockers quickly to finish changing, however before Adam, Steve, and James walked away, they grabbed Keith's gym clothes and walked away with them.<br /> <br /> Keith stood there not sure what to do, he walked to his locker, but somebody had opened the lock and taken his pants and underwear from inside. Keith felt defeated and sat down and cried as he thought of what he could do, his next class was in 5 minutes and he had a major test, he couldn't afford to miss it. He heard noises, and realized that the next gym class was coming in to get changed. Keith quickly darted into one of the bathroom stalls and lifted his feet, hoping no one would notice.<br /> <br /> A couple minutes passed, and as the noises died down, a pair of blue briefs fell right outside the door to the stall he was in. Keith couldn't believe his luck, he waited a moment to make sure that nobody came back for them, then quickly darted his hand out and snagged them. He took a good look at them, they appeared to be fancy designer briefs, but there wasnt any logo on the waistband, there wasn't even a tag to tell what size they were. However Keith was desparate, he had to get to class, he'd just figure out some way to return them later.<br /> <br /> Keith pulled the briefs on, at first they seemed to be too big, but after shifting them a bit, they seemed to fit snugly on his slight frame. Unbolting the door he slowly opened it and seeing no one around he dashed for his locker. He realized he still didn't have any pants when he noticed a discarded pair of shorts of the floor. He grabbed, them and they happened to be in his size. He pulled them on and pulled on his shoes, and made a dash for his class.<br /> <br /> Keith made it to class, but he was 5 minutes late. Mrs. Bartlow, his math teacher gave him a nasty look, as the rest of the class had already started the test. She handed him a copy, along with a slip for detention. Adam and Steve were in the back of class snickering at Keith as he came in.<br /> <br /> Keith sat down with the test and started to work on the questions. As he worked he felt some strange tingling coming from his groin. &quot;Oh, no!&quot; he thought, &quot;they must have put itching powder in here! It was their plan all along!&quot; Though he didn't feel any itching yet, he thought it must be a matter of time. He tried to finish his test quickly, but the tingling had spread up to his stomach and down to his legs. His crotch had started to itch a bit. He was able to finish his test, distracted as he was, with 10 minutes left before the end of class. Keith turned in his test and asked Mrs. Bartlow for a pass to the bathroom. She gave him on and he left the class fighting to keep from scratching the whole time.<br /> <br /> He made it to the bathroom and went into a stall. As he lifted his shirt he felt some hairs on his stomach. He looked down and he had a vague trail leading into the shorts, where this morning there hadn't been anything. He pulled the shorts down, and saw, to his suprise, that his legs now had hair on them. Curious as to what else was going on, he tried to pull the underwear off, but found he couldn't. It was like the waistband was stuck to his skin. He tried the openings for his legs, but they were the same way. He felt the front of the pouch, but the briefs had no fly on them. Paniced he tried to think of what he could do when . . .</p>
