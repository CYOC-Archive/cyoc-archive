<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Miss L sat at the table her fingers overlapping each with her elbows on the polished surface. &quot;You know, as soon as soon as our Michel Fox talks with his friends and relations who have been getting on in years like him. We'll be facing a stamped of the elderly wanting another life time. While I doubt the government will be able to order us to re-age those who had already been youthened, they might order us to close the doors the age reduction part of the technology. Society wasn't designed with immortals in mind after all.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;That might actually work to our advantage.&quot; Said Mr. A pushing up on his colored glasses. &quot;Elderly as a rule always vote in record numbers. And have a powerful swing on some opinion polls. It'll bring us one step closer to having our true forms among humans as equals.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr. M spoke, &quot;There is of course the very real chance that most will be scared away when they realize that the fur and the second lease on life is a package deal. Some the shock wave might not be too damaging legally, but they'll still support it for the sake of their friends and family.&quot;<br />
<br />
Miss L snorted, &quot;Or try to stomp it out from sheer petty jealousy.&quot; <br />
<br />
A Mr. D said, &quot;You worry too much.&quot; <br />
<br />
Miss L said, &quot;And you don't worry at all.&quot; <br />
<br />
Juanita, or Miss J as she was referred to at the meetings, sighed. The code names were rather pointless since most of this collection of the rich and powerful knew most of the other's names and it wouldn't take much trouble if any to find out the names of the rest, but it was a left over from when the group now known as the Management had started out. <br />
<br />
&quot;We can't blindly assume the worst case scenario, though I'll admit we have to be prepared for such things. Our five other parks in Japan, Europe, Africa, South America, and Australia are already under construction.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr A was pleased at the news, &quot;Good. We shouldn't have all our eggs in one basket.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;The bioengineering phobics have always been our greatest fear. But if the market of hyper-genetic altering gains a foot hold on any of those continents, other large business won't ignore the smell of cash.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And we'll be able to hold onto our prestige and -still- be able to at last live our lives in our true forms.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Ironically where the management had failed, the new hound lynx siblings had succeeded, in keeping very precise details on Leticia, even this early stage. She was a public figure in the park now after all, she -was- the doe of the top buck after all. Her pregnancy had boosted her status almost to super stardom in the park confines. Monty Mongoose surprised everyone by NOT putting out a alien pregnancy theory. <br />
<br />
Jeremy did his best to make sure that he and Leticia still had their privacy, but the disarming smile of the younger Lynx always made it easier for them to answer any number of questions. <br />
<br />
At the same time, the foxes, Jasmine, Mike, and Laurie, knew their vacation time in the park was coming to it's close. But the teenagers promised to give one big show before their vacation ended, their gift to their fellow evolved animals. And of course, it would also be when Mike would chose his successor to take control of the foxes once he and his family left the park. The newshound Harrison made sure they would have a very well sized audience. <br />
<br />
As for Keith and Jackie, Jackie and Keith had been.... decidedly trying... of course there was no way to know for certain until Jackie's period came around again. Though their staked out piece of territory had earned the nick name, 'The Kitty's Love Nest.' <br />
<br />
Ever since the tournament had ended, Drake and Lance had proven to be no trouble at all. Causing no damage and not bothering any of the does. With Leticia clearly Jeremy's alone, Jenny had found once again lining themselves up if she would have them. Both Robbie and John had tried the new, mysterious, radical 'gentlemen' approach with Beauty Queen Hannah, but they had failed to win her approval and had tried again with Jenny. Who seemed to be perfectly willing to string them both along like puppets on a string. Truth was though, Robbie and John subconsciously didn't mind being Jenny's puppets, at least she was paying attention to them. <br />
<br />
Hannah meanwhile had yet to find a new buck coming out of the gene splicer. However the other does, Su Yin, Jenny, and Lateisha, were always around her to keep her company. Heh. How many times had she dreamed of the fantasy of having three naked women around wanting to be her friend as Harry? Oh well. <br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Sally, not Samantha, not Sam, Sally.&quot; Sally said to herself for the third time that day since she had come out of the transformation room. She really did wonder how they did it. There was no beam of light, no sliver blob of nanites that engulfed you, you simply selected something and you changed, no special effects beyond your own transformation. And the transformation back into a female human was just as frill less. She had entered the room, told to wait while they brought up her DNA profile, (meaning female and human), and was changed back as with as little fan fair as she had become a buck in the first place. <br />
<br />
Her clothes and personal belonging she THOUGHT she would have been using on her vacation had been perfectly well kept. She hadn't met a single anthro in the building since changing back to human. Made you almost wonder if it was all just some grand mass hallucination. But Spike's screams were far too real for Sally. <br />
<br />
She was given a questionnaire after a complimentary shower/bath and other little tidbits that came from being part of civilization. The questions were simple enough, how much she enjoyed the park, what could be done to improve it, what could entice her to come again, if she was estranged, tempted, or accepting of anthros because of, or before or after visiting the park. And of course, the twice repeated question of if she felt any instinct or gender behavior side effect. For all truths, Sally felt like herself. She was herself. She just wish the time as Sam hadn't had to end on such a awful note, but she needed time away, away from naked furry bodies, antlers, hooves, bucks, does, and instincts that felt as reasonable as human reason when you had them. <br />
<br />
Putting on a conservative dress, she walked out of the giant building that acted as the looking glass between the outside world, and the inner world of TF Park America. <br />
<br />
&quot;See you around Hannah. I hope you find someone. But right now, I just need to be back with my someone.&quot; <br />
<br />
Her car had, also, been perfectly kept for her. She thought about Hannah, and how she planned to stay a doe when she returned to the real world. Sally wondered, had any other former humans already come to that decision? And if so, had any of them already left? It wasn't like there was any law against dramatically altering your DNA. Though she was pretty sure the anthros were gonna have to learn how to wear clothes again when they returned to civilization. <br />
After all, if they wanted all the rights of humans, these hyper evolved animals would have to accept all the rules of humanity as they had when they were human themselves.<br />
<br />
Sally's family was surprised to see her back early, not that her kids complained, nor did her husband, now he didn't have to be the only one to drive the kids to the video arcade. And of course, he wanted to know what the mystery vacation park was all about. Heh. She knew how the kids would react at first, then react again when they learned there weren't any video games inside the park. <br />
All the same, in all truths and realities, it was very good to be home. <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
The line of new huskies, both male and female, stood 'not naked' in a line in front of a slightly raised stage. Most of them were still covering themselves and wondering why the rest weren't. The rest felt strangely liberated. Nearly all of them were glancing this way and that in an overwhelming feeling of awkwardness. <br />
<br />
They had each stripped naked, entered the chamber, and come out with fur, a tail, muzzle, all the other canine details. They had each been made to sign this contracts -before- being allowed near the transformation equipment. <br />
<br />
Some where job hunters, others thrill seekers, and of course the random odd ball who was sure even now that this was just some super complex joke. But they all fell in line at the end. Naomi knew this truth easily. A voice boomed over the load speakers to their left and right, made precisely to carry the sound directly to their new ears. <br />
<br />
&quot;Greetings new Staff to Transformation Park North America, it is a pleasure to have you working with us and we hope that this is the beginning of a long term employment with us. It is assumed that you have read your contract, non-discloser agreement, and waver before agreeing to your genetic modifications. To those of you feeling embrassesment at your unclothed state, you will find that your sense of modesty should vanish within Twenty Four Hours with Ninety Five Percent of you. For the remaining five percent, you are free to mail order clothing, but you are to intereact with the guests only unadorned except with equipment. Please remember that your senses had been greatly increased in areas, most particularly smell. So do not be alarmed if you sense things in greater detail.<br />
<br />
However the modification to your DNA are only the first step in preparation for your employment with us. We shall also be including an in-depth corse on self defense, first aid, and in autonomy, and certain stealth techniques so as not to spoil the experience for park guests. You shall be assigned weapons, all non-lethal, only in extreme circumstances. Now to great you is head of park interaction staff Naomi Husky.&quot;  <br />
<br />
A husky, muscular, and with the slightest hint of scars under some of her fur, and as naked as any of them, marched onto the stage. She put her hands on her hips and barked at them. <br />
<br />
&quot;All right you mongrels! I'm your pack leader Naomi! And until your service contract expires you belong to me! I own you! Any of you mutts have a problem with that?! No? Good doggies!&quot; <br />
<br />
The new huskies stood glued to their spots not saying a word. <br />
<br />
&quot;And for some of you who might have some misconceptions about still being human. Let me clear them up for you. You're NOT human right now. You used to be human, and you'll be human again once your term of service expires. But right now you're dogs! Just like me! My dogs! If any of you think you can do a better job of running this neck of the outfit than me, I'll be glade to discuss it with you!&quot;<br />
<br />
The new huskies merely nodded and shook their heads at Naomi's statements as she hammered in her position as pack leader to the new pack members.  Their ears subconsciously flattened against their heads and their tails between their legs. <br />
<br />
&quot;If none of you caught it the first time. I'll say it again, you do not have a human brain right now. You also don't have a brain that's a strange mix of monkey and doggie. You've got a dog's brain as if it was given eight million evolutionary ride towards sentience! And me and your new pack members have a lot to teach you and not so long to teach it to you. The lives of guests could, and WILL depend on YOU knowing what to do, and knowing what NOT to do! Your job to see they don't kill themselves from their own stupidity or each other! Until the only fur is the hair on your heads again THAT is your purpose in life! Do you hear me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Mam!&quot; The new huskies all stood straight at attention. <br />
<br />
&quot;MAN! Did you see her go! She has that lot like a bunch of puppies in her paws.&quot; Said Zack laughing. <br />
<br />
&quot;If you ask me, she seriously over does it.&quot; Katie said, she, like the others, had observed the entire introduction incredibly close to the new huskies still trying to figure out their new senses and hiding themselves perfectly. &quot;I think she thinks we're all in the army!!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe,&quot; Harry said, &quot;But you gotta admit it was cool!&quot;</p>
