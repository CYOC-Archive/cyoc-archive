<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Josh rode atop Andrew&#39;s head, eyeing the crowd.  So far, he had transformed two random people that were passing by each other -- a man and an old lady -- into a mother and child, respectively.  He wanted to focus on non-animal transformations so the Animal Wing wasn&#39;t likely to immediately undo his transformations, though that didn&#39;t stop him from transforming the new mother and child into anthropomorphic kangaroos.  Of course, he kept them aware of their transformations, so they&#39;d have a chance to get to know each other.<br />
<br />
Before Josh could transform anyone else, Andrew turned and made her way into a toy store.  It was surprisingly not a large one, considering the popularity of the resort.  It was moreso about the size of a toy store in a shopping mall (for anybody who remembers those).  Unlike other toy stores, though, this one catered to all species... and ages.  There were your typical toys, such as beach toys and stuffed animals and toy cars.  Behind the counter, there were sex toys.  And there were also pet toys, such as squeaky toys, tug ropes, and that round thing with the ball inside that cats knock around.<br />
<br />
Although there was a counter with an attendant, there was no cash register, implying that like everything else in the resort, toys came complimentary with the resort.  Josh wondered, if they were all free, what was stopping anyone from just taking them all?  Then, Andrew spoke up.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know what?  I should indulge in being a tiger.  I want a rubber mouse.&quot;<br />
<br />
At those words, Josh suddenly lost his balance, falling off of Andrew&#39;s head.  He attempted to hold on using his grabby bird feet, but couldn&#39;t even sense them, anymore.  He landed on the floor with a light bounce, upside-down.  Though a little jarring, the landing didn&#39;t hurt.  Instead, the landing sent light vibrations through his body.  A body that could feel the texture of the floor, thanks to Josh no longer being covered in feathers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Josh, are you okay?  ...Oh.  I guess I got my rubber mouse.&quot;<br />
<br />
Josh was surprised.  After changing various guests at his own whim, the resort finally transformed him at its whim?  It must have, because he now remained completely motionless, and not just because he no longer had any limbs.  Thankfully, Andrew was willing to lend a paw and flip him right-side-up.  Andrew leaned down, looking at his face, and smiled.  &quot;You know, you&#39;re kinda cute like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
The rubber mouse didn&#39;t answer.  How could he?  He was just an object.  Josh wondered if perhaps *all* the toys in the toy store were guests.  Behind Andrew, he spotted a tennis ball, a scratching post, and a chew toy shaped like a squirrel.  He focused on transforming them.  Sure enough, he now found himself in the VIP&#39;s white void, with profiles providing the identities of all three toys.<br />
<br />
The next question is, how does Josh exit the void?  He&#39;s still a rubber mouse!  He tried to will the &quot;exit&quot; panel to be pressed, and surprisingly, it registered his press, and he found himself back in the real world, with the white tiger still smiling at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess you won&#39;t be doing much now that you&#39;re inanimate.  Come on, let&#39;s head back to our room.&quot;  Andrew opened up her maw, and picked Josh up by his tail.  She left the toy store, and began padding her way out of the Animal Wing.<br />
<br />
All the while, Josh dangled limply from the side of Andrew&#39;s mouth.  It was just a little gross, feeling his tail inside her mouth, resting on her tongue.  And the dangling was a little disorienting.  Inanimate and without limbs, Josh could only stare at the floor as it went by, and Andrew&#39;s paw coming in and out of view as she walked.  He twisted and turned a little from Andrew&#39;s motions.  If he wanted, he could use his VIP powers to immediately become animate again, but he decided that he&#39;d let the resort have its way with him just this once.  The experience wasn&#39;t too bad, so far.<br />
<br />
Upon arriving at their room, Andrew held Josh against a scanner that had been added onto the door.  Although she could&#39;ve used the identifying tag on the collar she now wore, she had noticed that Josh&#39;s belly now had a bar code printed on it.  As she expected, the bar code was his ID, and the door opened automatically for the two.<br />
<br />
The room itself had now been drastically altered, looking more like an animal&#39;s enclosure.  The walls had been painted to resemble a jungle.  The carpet had been removed and was now bare concrete.  Potted trees now lined the walls, with a few more clustered in the middle of the room.  A heated stone now sat where the bed once stood.  The bathroom was now an open area, with a pool of water featuring a small waterfall, and a pit beneath the wall for using the bathroom (thankfully with plumbing still included).  The only remnants of human accomodations were the balcony, the floor-length mirror, and a wall-mounted TV with a large remote to accomodate for Andrew&#39;s paws.<br />
<br />
Notably, the enclosure was just for a tiger.  Aside from the TV, there was nothing here for a man or a bird, nor a rubber mouse.  Although Josh would still be registered as Andrew&#39;s twin brother (unless Josh decided otherwise), his is now functionally just a toy belonging to Andrew.  A fact that Andrew was all too eager to take advantage of, as she dropped Josh on the floor and started batting him around with her paws.<br />
<br />
At first, Andrew was gentile with her play, but she became more rough as she learned the durability of Josh&#39;s rubber body.  She would pounce on him, and knock him across the room.  He would get knocked into the wall, and bounce helplessly onto the floor.  She&#39;d pin him down, and gnaw at his tail.<br />
<br />
For Josh, it was like the most insane roller coaster ride, but without a stomach with which to throw up.  However, it was not a painful ride, as his rubber body was made to take the abuse.  In fact, it actually felt good to be treated this way, like some sort of wild massage.  And feeling the pressure of Andrew&#39;s massive weight was kinda relaxing.  The pulling at his tail had the same pleasant effect as a morning stretch.<br />
<br />
Then, there was a beep.  Andrew just received a message on her phone, which was now in a satchel hanging from Andrew&#39;s shoulder.  She turned her neck to pull the phone out.  It was notably different than it was before, now much longer and featuring a durable case and screen protector.  She pawed at the screen, opening the message.  Upon reading it, she looked to the rubber mouse underfoot.  &quot;Hey, guess what?  Yuki, Sasha, and Maya just arrived!  They&#39;re on their way to registation right now.  So that&#39;s three down, one to go!&quot;<br />
<br />
Josh had been so distracted with being Andrew&#39;s personal plaything, he had almost forgotten about Andrew&#39;s friends.  With his VIP powers, he was looking forward to getting to know them on a more personal level.  However, that might be a bit difficult with him being an inanimate object.  Heck, Andrew&#39;s a male tiger, now!  Would Andrew&#39;s friends even recognize them?</p>
