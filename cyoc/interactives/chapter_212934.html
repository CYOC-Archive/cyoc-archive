<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff woke up early in the morning. He realised he wasn&#39;t lying on his back, but rather curling like a dog. He could hear the city comes to life-birds chirping, cars driving and people walking. He waited like this for an hour, barley noticing the passing of time. Seems like his transformation, even though he setted mind change to 0%, did gave him some basic instincts and feelings.<br />
Dean woke up, and Jeff barked happily, jumped on the bed, and with no thought, started licking Dean&#39;s face. Dean groaned. &quot;Lucky, what are you doing?&quot; He asked in a sleepy voice. &quot;Get down!&quot;<br />
Jeff jumped off the bed, feeling ashamed. What have he just did? Did he really let dog insticts take over?<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Said Dean as he woke up. &quot;Your second day as a dog has begun, Lucky. Sadly, I can&#39;t take you to school with me... you&#39;ll have to stay home while I&#39;m off. Don&#39;t worry though, I&#39;ll leave you bowls of food and water, and I don&#39;t think you&#39;l get bored-dog&#39;s perception of time is really different than human&#39;s.&quot;<br />
Jeff barked sadly. He didn&#39;t wanted Dean to leave! He whimpered and positioned himself on Dean&#39;s legs, preventing him from moving. Dean laughed. &quot;Already missing your master, Lucky?&quot;<br />
&#39;Master?&#39; Thought Jeff. &#39;I mean, he kinda is now, but he shouldn&#39;t say it, it&#39;s really humiliating, thinking about myself as &#39;his&#39; dog.&#39;<br />
Dean pulled out his legs off Jeff&#39;s body, and walked to the kitchen. He made himself breakfast, and when he was done, he returned to his room, finding Jeff waiting for him with sad puppy eyes. He petted his head. &quot;Oh, don&#39;t be sad, Lucky. I&#39;ll be back in no time, and than we can go on a walk together! And meet Ray and Kyle! Isn&#39;t it sounds nice?&quot;<br />
It does sounded good. The walk tommorow, although a bit embarresing, was really fun. And meeting Ray and Kyle is always a joyful activity-though now the meeting will be very different. He sat down and nodded. &quot;Fine, but do it quick.&quot; He barked.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll try,&quot; Chuckled Dean. He took his keys and left the house, leaving Jeff alone.<br />
Jeff ate and drunk, and than sat on the living room&#39;s carpet, and started thinking. How will Kyle react for him being a dog? Will he, like Ray, forget that Jeff the human ever existed? And what will Dean and him do afterwards? And what will they do after the month ends, and Jeff will transform back? Will they do another transformation? Maybe this time Dean will change?<br />
A sudden snapped him out of his thoughts. It was Dean&#39;s smell! Why have he returned so quickly?<br />
Jeff looked at the kitchen&#39;s clock, and his mouth fell open in astonishment. It was 5 P.M already! How come time passed so quickly?<br />
Dean opened the door, and Jeff jumped on his, eager to great him. Again, he felt the urge to lick his friend, and he gave in to the instincts, wagging his tail and barking in joy. Dean laughed. &quot;Easy, boy! You have&#39;nt been bored all this time, have you?&quot;<br />
&quot;Not at all, actually. It&#39;s really strange.&quot; Barked Jeff. <br />
&quot;Told you so!&quot; Said Dean. &quot;Time passes quickly as a dog.&quot;<br />
&quot;Are we going to Ray&#39;s now?&quot; Barked Jeff in question. &quot;Besides, I really need to... go out,&quot; He whined, ashamed.<br />
&quot;We&#39;re going right now, and you can relive yourself on the way.&quot; Replied Dean. He lifted up Jeff&#39;s collar and leash, and attached them to Jeff. <br />
&quot;Heel, boy!&quot;<br />
Jeff&#39;s ears perked up, and he ran to Dean side, eager to go out. Dean closed the door behind them, and they started walking towards Ray&#39;s house.<br />
On the way there, Jeff smelled a smell that made him want to bark. He sniffed the air. &quot;Found a squirrel? We don&#39;t have time for this now, Lucky. We can try and catch &#39;em later.&quot;<br />
Jeff continued walking, disappointed. They got to the same tree he saw tommorow, and Jeff could smell his own urine, recognizing it. He lifted his tail and peed again, marking the tree as his. Than he looked up at Dean, who was looking at him. &quot;Good job, boy. I knew you&#39;ll stop being so embaressed in no time.&quot;<br />
As they arrived at Ray&#39;s house, Jeff could hear they voices inside-Ray and Kyle were there, playing a video game. He wagged his tail in excitment. He could smell their familiar scent, but there was something else there... The smell of another dog? He growled in question, but Dean coulndn&#39;t smell it, so he just looked at him confused. &quot;What is it, boy?&quot;<br />
Before he could answer, Ray opened the door, smiling from ear to ear. &quot;Dean! I&#39;ve got a new dog!&quot;<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Asked Dean in amazment. Ray has never been quite the &#39;dog person&#39;. Seems like the Chronivac really altered everything so Jeff&#39;s change will seem normal.<br />
&quot;Yeah! His name is Rex, and he&#39;s the cutest german shepherd in the world! No hard feelings, boy,&quot; He said and petted Jeff.<br />
They entered the house, and saw kyle holding a big german shepherd on his knees. &quot;He&#39;s gonna crush me,&quot; He complained. &quot;Oh, hey Dean! And Lucky!&quot;<br />
&quot;Wow, that&#39;s a big dog. I thought you&#39;ll get a puppy.&quot;<br />
&quot;Nah, Rex is already trained, and my mom didn&#39;t wanted that I&#39;ll train a dog. Besides, he&#39;s 4 years old, just a little older than Lucky, so I thought they can hang out together!&quot;<br />
The dog jumped from Kyle&#39;s knees, approaching Jeff. He growled at him, and Jeff realised he can understand him-the dog asked him who is he. &quot;My name is Je-I mean, Lucky,&quot; Barked Jeff. Rex got closer, and started sniffing him. If dogs could blush, Jeff would&#39;ve defenitly did when Rex stuck his nose under Jeff&#39;s tail, and started sniffing. Jeff gave in, and did the same, sniffing at the dog&#39;s butt. He got so much information on him, and felt that the dog was eager for company. &quot;Wanna play?&quot; Asked the bigger dog eagerly.<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; Replied Jeff. He barked at Dean, &quot;Dean, can we go outside?&quot;<br />
Dean smiled. &quot;Seems like they like eachother. Let&#39;s release them outside while we play, shall we?&quot;<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Said Ray and opened the garden&#39;s door. The dogs ran out, and started chasing each other. Dean looked at them from the window. &#39;Jeff&#39;s really having fun as Lucky,&#39; He thought. &#39;But I know how to make him enjoy it way more.&quot; He smirked and searched for the Chronivac. &quot;Are you coming?&quot; Shouted Kyle from the basement. &quot;We&#39;re starting!&quot;<br />
&quot;Just a second!&quot; Shouted Dean back. He clicked some buttons and closed the Chronivac, giggling, and walked downstairs.</p>
