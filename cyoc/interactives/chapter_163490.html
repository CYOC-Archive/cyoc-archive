<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Arianna was confused. It sounded like Kyrenna had been expecting her, and not only that, she didn&#39;t seem at all annoyed or upset that her men had been slaughtered. Was this some sort of trap? She braced herself, baring her fangs at the bandit queen, ready to rush over and tear her throat out.<br />
<br />
But Kyrenna, a smile on her face, simply got up and drained the rest of her glass. &quot;It took you long enough to find my orchard. I really was concerned that you&#39;d get eaten, or starve to death before you tasted the fruit of my people. And what&#39;s more, you made the right choice to eat enough of it. Now I can finish what I started all those years ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
Arianna snarled angrily. &quot;Talk sense, you filthy elf!!! What fruit? Your people are nothing but half-breeds and mongrels. They are no threat to me, my father, or our great nation!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But that&#39;s exactly it. All this time, you&#39;ve let your eyes deceive you. Did it ever once occur to you how strange it was that a horde of men accepted me as their queen when, as you so eloquently put it, I am nothing but a mongrel? Have you ever wondered why my band has never once been caught, no matter how many knights or bounty hunters your father sends after us?&quot;<br />
<br />
Arianna thought it over. She remembered her father and his generals arguing about Kyrenna&#39;s men, how her father would yell at them for failing to capture her and the generals yelling back that she must be a sorceress or a witch, because every attempt they made to catch or kill her came to nothing. But something still bothered her.<br />
<br />
&quot;How does a elf like you know how to use such powerful magic?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyrenna smirked and picked up the knife laying on the table. Calmly and with no hesitation, she started cutting into her face. Arianna was shocked until she realized something. There was no blood from her wounds. But aren&#39;t elves supposed to...<br />
<br />
The answer came when Kyrenna, grabbing the edges of what had been her face, tore her skin and hair off, tearing her clothes and letting bits and pieces of leather, cloth, white hair strands, and soft golden skin flecks scatter around her. By the time she finished pulling off her pointed ears, the real Kyrenna stood before the young demoness. <br />
<br />
Like Arianna, she had leathery skin, rounded breasts with blue-tinged nipples, clawed feet and hands, a vagina that was the same color as her breasts, biceps and thighs bulging with muscle, a torso that rippled with an impressive six-pack, a long tail with a spade at the end, and a pair of wings, which slowly unfolded as she stretched out. The only difference was that Kyrenna had clearly filed her teeth and horns down to make them less noticeable.<br />
<br />
Seeing that the former princess wanted answers, Kyrenna gave her the truth. &quot;I am the last of the great Demoness race, which once ruled over this land centuries ago. I&#39;ve lived my entire life in secret, sleeping in caves and fields, and stealing food to survive. But then I figured out a better way to survive. A young female elf stumbled across my cave one day, and died from shock upon seeing my true form. I removed her skin and fit it over my body, and became Kyrenna the Bandit Queen by using my powers to attract all manner of scum and villainy. Since then, I&#39;ve been searching for a way to restore my kind to power. And the first step is to create more of us. You, dear princess, are the first of many more to come.&quot;<br />
<br />
Arianna didn&#39;t know what to feel. She realized then and there that Kyrenna had been manipulating her from the moment she captured her, all to make her into a demoness. All her suffering, her pain, it was just a game to this evil creature. At that moment, all she could think of was that she wanted to kill Kyrenna, or whatever her real name was.<br />
<br />
But before she could act on her anger, she felt the older demoness&#39; touch on her arm. &quot;Dear sweet Arianna, you should feel proud of what you are. We Demonesses are far stronger than anyone, be they men, elves, or orcs. We have powers beyond their comprehension, beyond their power to fight against. This whole world will belong to us, our sisters, and our descendants.&quot;<br />
<br />
As she spoke, she began to rub Arianna&#39;s nipples, pulling and poking at them with her claws, while using her tail to slowly push into her vagina. Arianna felt things she had never felt before as fluid dripped from the demonesses&#39; tail. Thoughts of revenge faded from her mind, replaced with an understanding that Kyrenna was all she had now. She was no longer human.<br />
<br />
&quot;But what now, sister Kyrenna? How can we make more Demonesses?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Patience, Arianna. First, we will need new skins to wear, so that we may mingle among the humans and elves without being seen. The first step will be to remove your horns and file your teeth. And as for our skins, these will suffice.&quot; She managed to find two bandits whose bodies had not been consumed by flames and started to skin their bodies with the thin edge of her claws. Both were handsome men, and their flesh would be more than enough to allow the two demonesses to wander about while they bided their time. <br />
<br />
Arianna grinned at her new companion, pointing at a man with long black hair and a fair complexion not unlike her old human body. This would be her new face.</p>
