<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">One bright sunny morning a Freightway truck pulled into the main drive of the Agriculture Departments of the university. A frantic call was placed to a Professor Simmons from the Dean of that department.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning, this is Professor Simmons....&quot; said the Professor as his desk phone sprang to life.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dave, what in the world did you send me from Brazil, goats?&quot; asked Myron Fuller.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Myron, two Nannies, and one buck! We captured them and thought since they were so rare you.....!&quot; said David Simmons Professor of History.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright true enough they are nice and healthy specimens, but there is four not three. A pair of Nannies, a pair of bucks, both are fine! I had Scott Murry unloading them this morning. The shipping crate must have been the one used by you to ship them here and then transfered to the University. Scott reported he had to crawl into the mire filled crate to coax one of the bucks out. Well I do thank you for thinking of us while you were on the dig!&quot; said Myron.<br />
<br />
A short silence on the phone and then Professor Simmons blurted out, &quot;The crate, don't let anybody enter the crate if it's filled with the mire of those goats! The, the, Ahhh, it has strange properties and can cause certain illness' to happen, I suggest you burn the crate, and soon!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure, I... well yes I'll have the crate torn down and burned for safety if think it authorized?&quot; asked Myron.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, do it, do it now, this morning, quickly, now!&quot; said Professor Simmons sounding of panic.<br />
<br />
As soon as Myron hung up he called to building 3735 and asked for Scott Murry, the Professor's prized assistant. Yet the phone at the unloading dock rang and rang without an answer, a Professor Fuller grabbed his car keys and headed out the door.<br />
<br />
It was a terrified thirty minutes as he drove to building 3735. A dash into the building, past the information desk and down the long hallway to Animal Husbandry and Life Science. Almost tripping over his feet when he ran down the stairs leading to the unloading area and the sorted pens for animals awaiting their use and dispersement.<br />
<br />
Bursting open the door to the unloading dock he saw the mire filled crate the goats were shipped there in and over in the near pen four goats peering out the openings in the fence.<br />
<br />
&quot;SCOTT, SCOTT MURRY, S.C.O.T.T.....!&quot; yelled the Professor.<br />
<br />
At first nothing, then from the feed shack came some giggling as if someone was feeling rather giddy. Professor Fuller walked cautiously to the small building and peered around the open door.<br />
<br />
There sitting with his back to the door was Scott. The young man's body looked slumped over as he faced away from the door. His head hung low and the odd giggling continued, till the Professor said Scott's name.<br />
<br />
Suddenly Scott stiffened up but continued to giggle after each phrase or sentence he would say. Scott did not turn around, but kept his low hung over posture.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was worried you might be injured, you didn't answer the dock phone!&quot; said Myron.<br />
<br />
&quot;Phone! Giggle giggle, phone what need shall I have for a phone!&quot; said Scott as another silly giggle rattled out of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I talked with Professor Simmons and he told me that the goat's mire might have some sickening effects!&quot; replied Myron as he stood into the small building's doorway.<br />
<br />
&quot;Professor Simmons, huh, giggle, I can see his worry! Giggle, I did as you asked and removed all four goats, goats, goats, giggle, to their pen, giggle. You need not worry I'm sure what has happened will without a doubt be of some good use to the University, giggle! I just don't know how I'll explain it to Jean or my parents, giggle? I...I.. just....this is making me feel sick to my stomach, giggle, but it also makes me feel so neat too, giggle, laugh, laugh, giggle.....!&quot; said a disturbed young man.<br />
<br />
&quot;Scott, what's wrong, turn around and tell me what's wrong with you!&quot; demanded the Professor.<br />
<br />
As the young man straightened up and began to turn around he said, &quot; I saw in the crate clothes, jewelry, and shoes mixed with straw and muck! One would wonder what those human trappings were doing in the crate till one would see this!&quot; said Scott as he completed his swing around and faced the Professor.<br />
<br />
The Professors gasp a breath as he saw Scott's rapidly changed form.<br />
<br />
Sitting still on his crate he looked up at the Professor and continued to have that silly nervous giggle. Lifting his Head up he gave a thin smile. Scott's face had taken on much of the appearance of a Mountain Goat. A shaggy gray wool covered the top of his once crew-cut brown haired head. A full pair of long and pointed goat's ears stuck out and with another small grin they wiggled as he giggled.<br />
Sprouting the top of his forehead was two sandy colored short horns, A pair of very pointed and about three inches high the horns showed ribs of what might be age rings.<br />
<br />
A blink of his eyes made the Professor take note that the brown pupils that Scott would flash to show questioning, now were bright yellow and square like those of a goat.<br />
<br />
The shaggy hair thinned as it covered the face till the hairs looked as long feelers around the merged nostrils and narrow mouth. A black and well silkened beard hung below his chin making him look all the more striking of appearance. <br />
<br />
Scott still was wearing a shirt but the buttons had all popped off leaving his chest open to view. As the Professor looked down, so also did Scott to his chest and started another round of silly nervous giggling.<br />
<br />
The shaggy wool hung in thick curling rolls. As Scott sat back he took a deep breath and his chest flared huge with solid muscle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Neat huh, I'm gaining the muscle I never could at the gym! There's more Prof', much more!&quot; said Scott.<br />
<br />
Leaning forward Scott put his arms out toward the stunned looking professor. A wide eyed man looked at Scott's wool covered upper arms and then looked down to his wrists now becoming a fore knee and his metacarpals growing to be the cannon bones of the forelegs of an animal. Scott's fingers too were locked together and some secretion was covering the finger tips.<br />
<br />
In a jump Scott stood up but as he did the Professor took a step back. Scott's height before was a good six inches shorter than the Professor. Yet now as Scott stood up he towered a fair two feet taller than the scared and grown man.<br />
<br />
&quot;Neat, huh!&quot; said Scott as he shook from head to toe like some bestial body shake. His shirt flopped around as his pants dropped down to gather about his feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you think, will Jean my girl be interested in having a roll around with someone hung like this? Giggle, laugh, laugh!&quot; chided Scott.<br />
<br />
The young man stood hung well as a Mountain goat should, his abdomen covered his thick wool and sporting a long narrow sheath. Hung far below the sheath was a ball sack filled with enormous testicles, like those of some wild species of goat. <br />
<br />
A slight turn to the side as if modeling his form in front of a camera, Scott motioned to his pouty long goat tail sprouted out his lower back. &quot;You think it didn't hurt as it grew out, but it did! The tail feels so neat now even though it spread wide my butt cheek and left the anus open to the air. Quite bestial, but since I'm looking ever so bestial anyway I might as well get used to the fact, right Prof'?&quot; said Scott with another giggle.<br />
<br />
Professor Fuller just looked on, his eyes wide, mouth open, he could not believe the effects happening to his prize student.<br />
<br />
Scott leaned one changing hand on the crate he was sitting on and lifted up his right leg. &quot;See here Myron, the thigh is now the hind flank of one well muscled goat. See here too the leg and what was once a heel is now a beast's hock. My foot is longer and the toes changed first, they can wiggle a little and will help a goat cling to the rocky crags. I don't know how this happened, but I do know that the goats in the pen were at one time human. The clothes I found in the crate were both male and female of nature, now I can add mine to the crate as an epitaph!&quot; said Scott as a note of sorrow tinted his voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ill work to revert your changes!&quot; spouted the Professor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get real Prof' this isn't a common Flu bug, I'm changing species! Even the guys in the Gene Lab won't have the foggiest of idea's how to revert me back in the least. I ask you for one thing, please, don't let them use me for some drug experiment and then when dead dissect me into small bottles of yellow fluids. If I become a goat then let me live as full a life I could as that goat, promise me?&quot; asked the youth soon to join those in the pen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Scott, I will take control and have you sent to some farm!&quot; said the Professor as his head bowed in sadness.<br />
<br />
&quot;I looked up one before my hands changed, Winter's Goat Farm and Petting Zoo!&quot; said Scott as his voice crackled and the lips now lost the agile manner for speech.<br />
<br />
&quot;Agreed!&quot; said Myron.</p>
