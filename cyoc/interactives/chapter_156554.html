<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Stonewood&#39;s original teachers couldn&#39;t stay they were confused when they ordered by the Dean to come to her office. She&#39;d already magically modified it to her size, and had pictures now of ponies, and various old time cowboy puppet shows, what might have been a pink diary covered in stickers, a giant tiger stripped teddy bear that looked like it could spring to life at any moment. <br />
<br />
They weren&#39;t too surprised when they saw the janitor, the lunch lady, and the nurse were also present. <br />
<br />
All of them knew what was coming, and to be honest... they were used to it. In any magic school it was a matter of survival, either become good at magic, or end up end up one of the professor&#39;s experiments, the wealthy of courses were able to pay for &#39;protection.&#39; It wasn&#39;t slavery of course, once you were, say, a figurine, you were no longer legally a person. <br />
<br />
There were always people who passsionately protested this gross inequality, but they tended to disappear soon enough, a lesson to the rest of the rabble. The more powerful used the less powerful as raw material, that was everything but written law! <br />
<br />
The Dean hopped onto her desk, kicking her legs in the air. <br />
<br />
&quot;To recap, Stonewood Maho Shojo Training Facility, as we&#39;re now legally known, is to become a closed system for the safety of our new little sisters. Untrained magical girls are like baby lambs, and we&#39;re in a world of wolves... &quot; Her eyes narrowed. &quot;A lot of you here are wolves, students who vanished with no investigation. Your predecessors were wolves, and your successors would&#39;ve been wolves. We were part of the problem. <br />
<br />
&quot;I won&#39;t insult your intelligence. You know why you&#39;re all here. Don&#39;t do anything foolish. I haven&#39;t lost any of my power, and if anything I&#39;m more magical than ever. If I was weak enough that you could have combined your efforts to usurp me before, you would have.&quot;<br />
<br />
The various staff shuddered. <br />
<br />
&quot;The Resident Advisors were crystal clear on this. But I want you all to know first, I&#39;m proud of you for being dedicated to your duties, your work, and your responsibilities. And I know we&#39;ll be a great team! And we&#39;ll mentor our little sisters to be the great and loving magical girls we know they can be! I might be a magical girl now... but this is still my school. And I&#39;d still rather have sisters I know helping me than outsiders where I can!&quot; <br />
<br />
Her toy prop looking white pistols appeared in her hands, and she let loose a barrage of magic, a few refused to go out without any resistance and brought up shields or prepared to magically blow themselves up to spite her and take the school with them, but none of them were as fast on the draw as her, she&#39;d been right, she&#39;d survived as Dean for a reason. <br />
<br />
It took less than thirty-seconds, and the Dean blew away imaginary smoke from her pistols before dismissing her weapons (though all it took was a thought to resummon them). <br />
<br />
She smiled at her squadmates, her family. Her sisters stood at attention smiling back at her. Fourteen new magical girls, ready to handle the mundane parts of their little sisters education (on this world, magic was mundane!). <br />
<br />
Prof. Magica, was utterly adorable in her little top hat and tuxedo dress. Her top hat actually now hiding a pair of rabbit ears.<br />
<br />
Astronomi wore a slightly oversized sparkly blue robe with floppy pointed hat with glitter stars, her round glasses just made her cuter as she blushed. <br />
<br />
The physics professor wore a long white coat, worn over a short purple dress, with (short) hair and eyes to match, and high heels. <br />
<br />
The math professor wore large square glasses, and a brown graduation camp, her cross button blouse and folded skirt just adding to her mousy appearance in spite of not having animal traits. <br />
<br />
The history professor, wore a red bandana, a huge grin on her face, gold earrings, a cutlass covered in runes, a couple band-aids on her face and knee, and white leggings underneath a red skirt (if magical girls had one part that was part of the uniform, it was the skirt), and was bare foot, but never seemed to mind. She also had an obvious black cat ears and tail. <br />
<br />
Computer science had fizzy green hair, and wore a digital green visor, with a puffy yellow and green dress with a circuit board pattern, looking like she could barely stand staying still. <br />
<br />
The english professor wore a red victorian era style dress, a thick book floated next to her that contained her spells and the complete works of Shakespeare and Christian Anderson and the Brothers Grimm fairytales. <br />
<br />
The dancing instructor wore a pristine white puffy ballerina costume, her blond hair in a seemingly impossible number of curls.  <br />
<br />
The PE instructor wore a stereotypical blue school swimsuit, on her back were a pair of fins that gave the impression of wings, her hair was short, dark blue, and had spiral curls that should have been impossible for any lass to have. She also wore a short skirt and mini-jacket, her hands and feet having hints of being webbed. She formed a ball of water out of thin air and began to bounce it between her hands, realized she was supposed to be paying attention and hid it behind her back (the Dean giggled at this). <br />
<br />
The drama professor had dark eyes, long black hair, and a feathery black dress. Around her neck was a comedy/tragedy mask. <br />
<br />
The art professor wore a dark red beret, and a tie-die puffy dress that made it impossible to tell what were splashes of paint and what was part of the pattern, she also had a giant brush as her wand. She also had stars painted on her pale face.<br />
<br />
The lunch lady wore a perfectly clean chef&#39;s uniform made to resemble a dress with puffy shoulders, and a ladle. <br />
<br />
The janitor, was dressed as a mind-meltingly cute little maid with white hair, armed to the teeth with half cleaning supplies, and half ninja gear hidden on her person. <br />
<br />
Finally there was the music professor, holding a white recorder. Her blond hair reaching her ankles, while her frilly pale yellow dress ended just above the knee. <br />
<br />
This all takes time to write down, within seconds, they were all in a massive group hug. <br />
<br />
Stonewood&#39;s old emblem of a winged snake biting its own tail was taken down, replaced with its new one: a winged heart crossed with a pair of wands. And the former saying &#39;Knowledge is Power, Power is Claimed, Power Makes Right&#39; below the emblem was replaced with &#39;Fight for Justice, Protect Love, Give Hope.&#39; <br />
<br />

<br />
While it was nice to have her and the rest of the faculty now on the same page, the Dean still had paperwork to do. Like writing out to Sabrina now Zitrona&#39;s parents that their daughter had been caught trespassing, and had been formally drafted into the magical girl training program. She needed to speak with Prof. Penumbra with being trigger happy with intruders. Even if she was the newest magical girl when compared to the outsiders who would be handling the magical girl oriented courses, this was still her school, and her big sisters showed her the respect expected of that. But she had a minor issue to deal with in front of her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Prof. Olibia...&quot; The Dean said. &quot;Some of our little sisters have expressed confusion over your terms used.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh? Really? That wasn&#39;t my intention,&quot; she said politely. <br />
<br />
&quot;I asked for your profile, and it seems to be just a matter of culture class. In your world, the term &#39;witch&#39; just means females with magical ability.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What does it mean here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;&#39;Female demon contractor&#39;.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Also, in your world, yokai and demon are used interchangeably, referring to mythical beings... Here, demon usually refers to &#39;fallen angel&#39;, so calling a mythical a &#39;demon&#39; is considered a GRAVE insult.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;OH! Thank you for warning me!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No problem. These culture clashes happen when outside teachers are brought in. Good luck with getting our sisters up to speed. We only have three years to turn them from a buncha collage boys into superpowered little girls who can take down monsters in one-on-one combat!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s just front line fighters, you said so yourself, there&#39;s also healers, law enforcement, social workers, DISASTER RESCUE!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;True, but everyone thinks of the front line fighters with magical girls.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, shame that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which is why it&#39;s our job now to help them become the best magical girls we can!&quot; <br />
<br />
The two hugged. <br />
<br />

<br />
&quot;Hi Mikey,&quot; said the blue haired girl. Her hair was short for a magical girl, barely neck length. She wore a half-skirt over a pair of black shorts. She wore a pair of sneaker instead flat tops or high heels, and had petite breasts just enough so she couldn&#39;t be mistaken for a male, she was carrying a large sword.<br />
<br />
Mike looked around the black void. &quot;Where am I? And who are you? What&#39;s going on?&quot;<br />
<br />
The blue haired girl stuck a thinking pose. &quot;I&#39;m pretty sure we&#39;re in your subconscious, I know we&#39;re dreaming. And I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;m the magical girl you&#39;re going to become. What&#39;s happening? I think you&#39;re suffering from mild identity dissociation disorder, I think it said in the pamphlet we read that can happen in rare cases like ours. I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s happening because you spent a good amount of savings on that instantaneous &#39;female to male&#39; spell that made being a male your natural state. And the idea of being dragged back kicking and scream what we tried to get away from.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So... do we fight now or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t wanna fight you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you seem nice enough. I&#39;m not interested in fight you either. So what happens?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... I think I&#39;ll slowly be assimilated into your psyche as you become me. I&#39;m Miki by the way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cute.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks. Oh! Wait! I think this is where we wake up!&quot; <br />
<br />
Mike woke up, to find a little girl with impossibly bright red hair in a sailor uniform bouncing up and down on his bed. &quot;Hiiii! I&#39;m Rosa-chan! I&#39;m your new roommate! Nice Tho meeth you!&quot; <br />
<br />
Mike sighed. <br />

Professor Erlkin checked on her students. Zitrona and Calce were playing patty cake. She had to stop Fern from accidentally cutting herself bald when she tried to give herself a hair cut, future magical defender, bad hairstylist, at least it kept Fern&#39;s mind off of whatever rivalry she and Rosarie had had in their former incarnations. Rosarie was playing with Tesssa. Leyla was doing a lot better than before, confident her friends would soon be little like her, and then could all be friends again, she now had doggie ears on top of her head and a fluffy tail (like her pet had had) that was making her the star of the classroom! Hazel, Chrysanthemum, and Tempesta had formed their own little club. At least there no new former trouble-makers today.</p>
