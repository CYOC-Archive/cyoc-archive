<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Half an hour later, Luke called Mark down for dinner. It wasn´t anything special, just spaghetti Bolognese, but Luke had made sure to make enough for the whole house, including himself, like Mark had ordered. Mark had some problems eating them, though. Not because he himself had any problems with his hands, but to keep his laughing inwards.<br />
Chris sat on the ground and was already eating like a dog would, without Mark doing anything. But Chris couldn´t use cutlery with his paws, so he was stuck eating like that. Justin, while sitting at the table, also mostly inhaled his food, face right on the plate. Dean used both his clawed hands to lift the plate up between them, before slightly tilting it to slurp it like a soup. Theo used his wings in a similar way to raise his plate to eat. Rick was the only one changed of the friends who could eat normally with the cutlery, but like always since the changes alternated in using his hands and his feet, making his place as messy as the others. Only Luke himself ate normal, ignoring their problems, as even knowing Mark had changed them, to him they did what they would do normally in a way, therefore it was not interesting to watch.<br />
After the five friends returned to their game, Mark finally could eat in peace, while Luke already started to clean the mess left behind by them. When Mark returned to his room, he relaxed a bit, having a small idea what he would do later that night.<br />
Beside one time hearing someone, most likely Justin, come up and move into Chris´s room, Mark wasn´t disturbed until the friends went to bed. It didn´t take them long to get to their sleeping arrangements, and soon there was mostly silence from the room.<br />
Mark used the chronivac´s text input to make sure all five would stay asleep until around six in the morning before walking over, looking inside to see their arrangement in the room. It was similar to the night before. Chris on the ground, laying alongside his bed on his side. Rick at the foot of the bed, head hanging down above Chris hind-paws. Justin laid on his chest, diagonally across the bed, his head drooling onto Rick´s feet, while his own feet dangled above Chris head, getting licked from time to time.<br />
On the other side of the room, in the new bed, Dean laid on his belly, facing towards the foot of the bed, while Theo laid on his side the other way around, hugging Dean´s legs with his wings, while his own feet laid beside Dean´s head, an arm from him draped over them.<br />
Mark laughed a bit, before he applied his little plan. Standing in the middle of the room, he said clearly: “Now, for a bit of fun in the morning. Reawake Chris, reawake Justin, reawake Rick, reawake Theo and reawake Dean. I hope for some commotion in the morning. Hehe”<br />
With that, he looked over at the sleeping friends faces again. Each had scrunched up in disgust, as they all smelled someone´s feet, or better, someone´s stinky shoes. Chris was worse, shuddering every time he licked Justin´s hooves, Justin scrunched disgusted while still drooling on Rick´s feet, and Rick was twitching over his wet feet. At least neither Dean nor Theo did anything like that.<br />
Mark went to bed, grinning evilly at what would be a show in the morning, that´s for sure. He set his alarm to five fifty, just before the group would wake, not to miss it.<br />
<br />
It was around six in the morning, shortly after Mark woke to his alarm, that the commotion started like planned. Mark had used the chronivac so he wouldn´t be noticed for an hour, so he could enjoy it, and Luke wouldn´t leave his rooms until then as well.<br />
The second the clock hit the appointed time, five pairs of eyes flew open, and not a second later, all five friends screamed in shock. Justin rolled away from both Rick´s feet and Chris´s face, escaping more licks from Chris. Rick curled up, trying to shield his feet from the drool of Justin, while Chris tried rubbing at his tongue with his hands, wanting to get the taste of Justin´s hooves away from it.<br />
Theo unwrapped from Dean´s legs, scooting back in horror, not being the affectionate type. And Dean nearly fell out of the bed as he distanced himself from Theo, stopping not even an inch before the end of the bed.<br />
Theo was the first to voice his apology to Dean, only to get a better look at his hands. “I´m sorry, Dean~. I don´t hug~ other´s normally~. What´s wrong~ with my voice~? AND WHAT HAPPENED~ TO MY HANDS~?” he exclaimed in shock, looking down at his wings.<br />
The commotion from him made the other´s look at him in shock, before they all looked at themselves, even more shocked at their own changes.<br />
“WHAT THE HELL? WHY DO I HAVE PAWS FOR HANDS AND FEET? AND IS THAT A TAIL?” Chris screamed, panicking at the sight. He tried jumping up, wanting to see if his face had changed, only to instantly on his instincts drop to all fours, running towards his wardrobe.<br />
“ARE THOSE *OINK* HOOVES? WHAT HAS HAPPENED *OINK* TO MY BODY *OINK*? AND WHY *OINK* AM I OINKING *OINK OINK* LIKE A PIG *OINK*? Was heard from Justin, who couldn´t look away from his former hands in horror.<br />
Rick looked at his hands, black skinned as they were now, in shock, but also in wonder. But something else freaked him out more than his hands. “WHY AM I NAKED?” He tried to hide himself, turning bright red in embarrassment.<br />
Dean was slower and quieter, the first through his changes, the later from his own character. But he too, screamed in his shock: “WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED TO ME? WHAT KIND OF MONSTER HAVE I BECOME? AND WHERE ARE MY CLOTHES?”<br />
It was much moving around Mark, who leaned back against Chris´s desk, only slightly annoyed by the volume these five had. But it was expected to be loud, after all, they only noticed their changes now.<br />
Each of the friends tried to get to the mirror, shoving Chris aside, who sat there in shock about his dog-like position on the ground. Theo, being the nearest to the mirror beside Dean, jumped over his friend while swaying his arms, as if ready to lift off and fly any second. He stopped in front of the mirror, bouncing and swaying, shock written over his face.<br />
Rick pushed Theo aside, and seconds later had his mouth hung open, seeing his missing private parts. Justin reached the mirror next, nearly toppling over on his hooves, balance being thrown off by them, but he managed. Dean, while nearest to the mirror, was last to reach it, being slow and crawling the way he did.<br />
Mark was by now nearly rolling on the ground, laughing his head off. That was so hilarious to watch. He would soon switch them back, as they still needed to get ready for school. He was tempted to use the chronivac to force them to go while their minds were normal, but still being stuck in their changed bodies and mostly naked, but for now, that would be too much for them. But getting a good laugh from their panic was always good.<br />
Chris was whimpering in his horror, not able to move after being pushed over by his friends. That was when Mark made use of his set input about being able to be heard, even if he whispered to them. “What´s the matter, Chris? You are an adorable little puppy, aren´t you?”<br />
“No, I´m not” Chris screamed in panic, not recognizing his brother´s voice in his shock. “I´m not a puppy, I´m not a dog.”<br />
The other´s were in shock themselves, mentally trying to “wake up” from this nightmare, but Chris´s scream let them come by. “Clearly not. You are human, Chris. Why did you think you needed to clarify that?” Rick asked first.<br />
Before Chris could really answer that, Mark whispered: “Oh, you are a puppy, Chris. Submerge Chris, become my puppy again.”<br />
Chris shuddered as the command worked it´s way on his mind, sending him back to all the made changes. As he answered to Rick, it was from the puppy Chris, who didn´t know what he had thought about before. “Yeah, I know. It was just running through my head, that´s all.”<br />
Mark used the same approach with the other´s, one after another. “Why are you in such a panic, Rick? Is the little monkey upset about something?”<br />
Rick looked around wildly, trying to see where the voice was coming from, but not saying anything. “I´m not a monkey, whoever you are” went through his head, but stayed there.<br />
A little disappointed that Rick didn´t voice anything, Mark laughed at him. “Well, calm down, little monkey. Submerge Rick, become the monkey again.”<br />
Like Chris, Rick shuddered as his mind was set back to be Mark´s monkey, not that he viewed himself that way.<br />
“Want to sing something for us, birdy? Come on, Theo, you are such a good birdy, aren´t you?” Mark targeted Theo next, who went rigid as he heard the voice.<br />
“Who´s there~? I´m not~ in the mood~ for singing~ right now.” Theo said, looking around the room as well. “And I´m not a bird” went unsaid by him.<br />
Before either of the others could ask, Mark set him back as well: “That was a good start, birdy Theo. Submerge Theo, and enjoy your wings.”<br />
Theo relaxed after a shudder went through him, seeing no problem with his situation anymore. When they went to school, he would stretch his wings, that was for sure.<br />
“Say, little piggy, aren´t you hungry? Would you like some breakfast, Justin?” Mark whispered to the boy, who even without being in his pig persona, was slightly drooling.<br />
Just as Justin was about to answer, his stomach growled loudly, disrupting any comment about not being hungry. Therefore, he only said: “Hungry *oink* yeah, but *oink* I´m not *oink oink* a pig.”<br />
Mark laughed a little. “Aren´t you, piggy? Submerge Justin, and then raid the bin by the desk for breakfast.”<br />
Mark had to laugh when after the shudder went through Justin´s body, he instantly turned around, nearly jumping into the bin. There were only a few balled up pieces of paper inside, but to the hungry Justin, that was good enough for the moment.<br />
Dean, being the only one not back into his created mind, had his eyes wide open as he watched Justin eat the paper from the bin. That wasn´t normal for his friend. Just then, he also heard Mark whisper to him: “What do you fear right now, Dean? Is our little lizard afraid of his friend’s behavior?”<br />
Dean was the only one to recognize the voice of Mark. “What have you done to us, Mark? We aren´t your pets or anything like that, turn us back.” He said slowly, not screaming in his raising fear. If Mark had done this, what would stop him from making him whatever he wanted him to be? Lizard? Was that what he should represent?<br />
Mark laughed as Dean tried to flee the room, crawling his way out slowly. He let him reach the open door, but before he could cross it, he said: “I have my fun with all of you, Dean. You aren´t full pets, but I´m also not finished with you all. But let´s finish for now, little lizard. Submerge Dean, be my slow and cold lizard again. We need to get down to breakfast.”<br />
Dean had mentally tried to block Mark out in his attempt to flee the room, but couldn´t, and so was forced back into his lizard mindset just as his feet crossed the door, making him stop with a shudder.<br />
Mark laughed as he left the room, still invisible to his pets, climbing over Dean and heading into his own room. He got ready for the day half an hour later, before heading down to breakfast, seeing Luke had set the table for it already. The others soon joined them, and after finishing, headed out to school. Mark and Luke would bring the friends to theirs before getting to Aidan.</p>
