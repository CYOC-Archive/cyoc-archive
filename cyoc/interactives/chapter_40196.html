<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Wake up sweetie, I have your clothes for you&quot; Lucy's mom said as she gently shook her new daughter awake.<br />
<br />
Lucy woke slowly hoping that what had happened last night was a dream. It had to be a dream because things like that could not happen. It had seemed so real though. She had even felt the changes that happened. She was thinking of herself as a girl even. She had to stop that. Her name was Luke, not Lucy, and she was a boy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on Lucy get up&quot; her mom said. &quot;It's noon already and you need to eat lunch.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her mind must still be addled from sleep. She thought her mom had called her Lucy. &quot;I'm getting up&quot; she said. She had to be half asleep still since she heard a girl's voice come out of her mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hurry and get up then&quot; her mom said. &quot;I'll need to help you when you go pee. You're not used to going pee as a girl. You also need to take a bath before you eat and I need to help you wash your hair. Now get up!&quot;<br />
<br />
Lucy felt the covers yanked off of her and felt the cool air against her naked body. She opened her eyes and sat bolt upright. She looked down at her body and knew that it hadn't been a dream. She was a girl and she hadn't reverted. &quot;I'm... I'm a... a... GIRL!&quot; she shouted. &quot;IT WASN'T A DREAM! WHY WHY WHY!?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Calm down sweetie&quot; her mother said. &quot;It isn't that bad. Uncle John will do his best to get you back to normal. You have to have a little faith. Besides, you had told me once that you wondered what it would be like to be a girl. Now you have the opportunity.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I DON'T WANT TO BE A GIRL THOUGH!&quot; Lucy wailed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it really so bad being a girl?&quot; her mom asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;YES IT IS!&quot; Lucy wailed.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can't know that so soon!&quot; her mom chided her. &quot;You haven't been a girl long enough to know that!&quot; The stern look on her face softened as she said &quot;I know it must be difficult for you. You've been a boy your entire life and to suddenly be changed like you were must be messing with your head. Just try to adjust to being a girl for now. Can you do that for me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lucy could see the pleading in her mom's eyes. She really wanted her to try to make the best of this situation. &quot;Ok Mom&quot; she said. &quot;I'll try to adjust but I want to become myself again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you do&quot; her mom said. &quot;Now I'm sure that you need to pee and you need to take a bath. Your father is downstairs and I told him to stay down there for the time being. You don't need to worry about him coming up and seeing you naked. Now let's go to the bathroom.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Lucy and her mom made their way to the bathroom Lucy couldn't help but feel a little embarrassed that she was naked and her mom saw her naked. She knew that she shouldn't feel that way since they were both girls now but she still felt like that. The feeling grew as her mom reminded her that girls needed to sit to pee and they had to wipe afterwords. Once she was in the tub her mom had said that she shouldn't use her old shampoo. She said that it was too harsh for a girl's hair and that her shampoo and conditioner were better. Once her bath was over her mom showed her how do wrap her hair in a towel to dry. With a towel wrapped around her Lucy and her mom went back to her room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok time to get dressed&quot; her mom said. &quot;I'm not going to make you wear anything too girlie unless it's on special occasions, like for our pictures. Now put these panties on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do I have to?&quot; Lucy asked as she took the panties her mom handed her. They were red with snowmen on them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Girls wear panties&quot; her mother said. &quot;I tried to find some plain panties for you but the store didn't have any.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do I put them on?&quot; Lucy asked. &quot;The tag is on the side.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The front is a little narrower than the rear&quot; her mom said. &quot;If you lay them down you'll be able to tell how they go on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lucy did as her mom suggested and found that she could tell the front from the back easily. When she had pulled them up she felt a little uncomfortable with how snug they were against her crotch. She was used to wearing boxers after all. They only thing that made it bearable was the softness of the panties.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now put these socks on&quot; her mom said. &quot;I know that they're shorter than you're used to.&quot;<br />
<br />
Once Lucy put the socks on she found that they came up just past her ankles. At least they were white. Her mom handed her a red long sleeve shirt which she put on. Next her mom handed her a pair of pants that looked like regular pants though they had a button fly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Make sure that you tuck your shirt in&quot; her mom said. &quot;You want to look nice. Come back to the bathroom and I'll blow dry your hair.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lucy followed her mom back to the bathroom. It didn't take long for her hair to be dried. Then her mom said &quot;You know, your hair would look good done up in a braid. Would you allow me to braid your hair?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lucy thought about it for a minute. Her hair was long now. Perhaps if her hair was braided it would help to keep it out of her face and food. She sighed and said &quot;You can braid my hair Mom.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you sweetie&quot; her mom said.<br />
<br />
It didn't take long for Lucy's mom to braid her hair. When she was done she asked if she wanted a bow or just a regular hair tie put in to keep the braid in. She chose to have a regular hair tie to keep the braid together.<br />
<br />
They went downstairs to go out for lunch. Lucy noticed that the shoes her mom had bought her were white with pink laces and piping. &quot;Those were the only shoes they had that were your size sweetie&quot; her mom said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess it's ok Mom&quot; Lucy said. She figured that these things couldn't be helped. She knew that her coat would more than likely look really girlie and she was right. Her coat was pink with white faux fur on the hood running down the front on either side of the zipper and on the cuffs. The mittens her mom had bought her were pink as was the hat. There was no question that she was a girl in them.<br />
<br />
As they piled into the van Lucy noticed that her mom had bought a booster seat. Her mom buckled her into the booster seat and they were off to lunch.</p>
