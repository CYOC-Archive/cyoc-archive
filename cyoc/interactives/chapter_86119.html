<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mary awoke, groggy and alarmed.  Sunlight poured in from her window, basking the room in a faint glow.<br />
<br />
“My clock!” she cried.  “Not on the nightstand.”  She looked down and saw it laying on the floor.  The alarm disabled when it fell, the numbers 9:35 glaring up from the carpet.  She was late for school.  In fact, she was so late that she decided she&#39;d just skip.  She was a straight A student, so faking a single sick day before the weekend wouldn&#39;t hurt.<br />
<br />
She slowly turned over to grab the clock, her stomach groaning with the pressure.  The sensation made her stop.  Her heart skipped a beat, and several more as she realized that she couldn&#39;t easily get into a sitting position.  She couldn&#39;t just pull herself up with a situp like she wanted to, and was instead forced to push herself up with her arms.<br />
<br />
Slowly lowering her eyes, she nearly cried when she saw the state she was in.  Her stomach was huge!  Beneath her one-piece pajama suit sat a large orb.  Cradling it in her lap caused the heavy weight to sit on her legs, nearly strangling the circulation.  Horrified, she tentatively prodded it with her finger.  Not only could her finger feel the bulge, the bulge could also feel her finger!<br />
<br />
Tears began to well up in her eyes.  Turning her head away from the sight they began to spill softly down her fine features.  “I just ate a salad!” she moaned.  Habit dictated that she hug her legs for comfort, but her belly was never going to allow her knees anywhere near her chest.  Instead, despite the screaming in her brain, her arms wrapped around her globe-like belly.  It&#39;s firmness held, cementing itself as a feature that couldn&#39;t be hidden.<br />
<br />
“I have to do something!”<br />
<br />
Mary stood up, her back straining slightly as her stomach settled into a lower position.  She started towards the closet, but the motion of walking put incredible pressure on her bladder.  She headed to the bathroom, waddling under the weight and supporting her belly with her hands, her face flushing red with embarrassment.<br />
<br />
She hastily unzipped her pajamas, fearing that she wasn&#39;t going to make it.  Her eyes slammed shut before she could see her new gut and she sank onto the toilet seat just as the urine began to fall.<br />
<br />
Again she felt the new weight resting on her thighs.  She breathed deeply and counted to three.  Slowly opening her eyes, she saw the bulbous mass that had just been a flat washboard yesterday.  It stuck out obviously and awkwardly, hanging precariously on her otherwise small frame.  Her belly button stuck outward.<br />
<br />
What had really caused her to catch her breath in her throat, though, was the abundance of small hairs poking up around the mass.  Her belly button was like a small hill in a fledgling forest of soft, downy hair.  She rubbed her small hands over it, feeling the firmness of her belly and softness of the tiny hairs that now called it home.  <br />
<br />
Her eyes stung, but all her tears were spent.  All thoughts fled from her mind, now overcome with confusion, horror, awe, curiosity, and self-loathing all at once.  She needed help, but she was glad she was alone, her parents gone.<br />
<br />
“First things first,” she said in spite of her dry throat, “I have to get dressed.”  She still had some larger clothes from when she was overweight a few years ago, but even at her heaviest she never sported the belly she did now!<br />
<br />
With some effort she returned to a standing position and waddled back to the dresser.  It took some digging, but she finally fished out the largest pair of of pants and underwear and shirt she could find.  She had to sit on the bed to get dressed, seeing as her stomach made it impossible to do while standing.<br />
<br />
As she slipped the underwear up to her waist, she noticed a small nub right above her buttocks.  It was weird, like a tiny, bony growth.  Her finger rested on it only for a moment, though, before she breathed a sight of relief that her underwear seemed to fit.<br />
<br />
Her pants were another matter.  They refused to be pulled up any higher than her butt, her stomach destroying any chance of buttoning or even zipping them.  Her shirt didn&#39;t go as planned, either.  Her fuzzy belly button was still prominently visible.<br />
<br />
“Okay, stay calm.  I have to Google this and see if there&#39;s any expla-” She stopped.  “The vials!”<br />
<br />
She ripped open the drawer and pulled the box out.  She&#39;d taken one that said &#39;Bear&#39; not believing that it could actually change someone, yet it sat in the box filled to the brim with liquid.  It was open, but that was the only evidence that it had even been touched.<br />
<br />
A small card poked out between the collection of bottles.<br />
<br />
Warning: Effects can be reversed, but it&#39;s recommended to wait 2-4 days after changes complete to reverse.   New effects can be added in the meantime, but the wait period also applies to each new vial.<br />
<br />
Mary felt as though someone had knocked the wind out of her.  How long before the changes finished?  And she&#39;d have to wait that long before looking for a way to get back to her old self?  The only consolation she could think of was that she hadn&#39;t taken the entire vial.  She hadn&#39;t even drank half of it!  Yet the effects were still as horrible as she could think of.  She had a fat, firm belly that couldn&#39;t hardly be squashed or hidden that was growing fur.  She knew it was fur now.  Brown hairs that poked up everywhere, too numerous in number to be like normal body hair, even for the hairiest of men.<br />
<br />
She lowered herself on the bed, her hands idly rubbing her stomach, feeling each small strand of fur brushing against her palms.  Her legs were spread apart, causing her bloated belly to sit low, completely pushing aside her jeans and resting against her clitoris.  It jolted her from her thoughts as she realized how good the new sensation felt.  She could almost grind herself against the oversized globe that had once been her stomach.<br />
<br />
Up and down it slid, rising and falling against her genitals and she went, her tiny hairs prickling them and enticing them.  Could she even slide her hand down there?<br />
<br />
Her curiosity stopped suddenly with a sharp pang accompanied by a loud growl.  She needed more food, and now she knew that there was no chance of resisting it if she wanted to get these changes over with.  Instead of another salad, it was time for some steak!</p>
