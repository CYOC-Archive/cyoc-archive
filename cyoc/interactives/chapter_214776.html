<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I-I guess so...&quot; shyly replied Christian, or rather, Christina. She didn&#39;t understand why she suddenly felt so self conscious and shy all of a sudden, but no matter what she tried, she couldn&#39;t shake the feeling. She followed Mike over to the counter and paid for the boots, but was then asked a question by Mike.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, you wanna get some dinner or something? You&#39;re quite the hottie, and definitely my type of woman.&quot;<br />
<br />
Christina blushed, not sure why she was suddenly feeling happy and a little embarrassed. Was she always so weak to compliments? &quot;Thank you for saying that, but I couldn&#39;t possibly-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No? Then how about taking a part-time job working here then as my assistant?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I don&#39;t-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;ll be fine. Here, just sign your name here if you could.&quot;<br />
<br />
Swept up by the quick paced conversation and movements of Mike, Christina couldn&#39;t think straight and just wrote her name down on the line. She was surprised with how well she wrote, never having this kind of penmanship before. She even dotted her I&#39;s with tiny upside-down hearts. <br />
<br />
The moment she finished, Mike pulled the paper away and it vanished behind the counter. Christina then felt something happen to her entire body. Her head began to ache as new knowledge flooded in. Causing her to close her eyes in agony. Meanwhile, her body was undergoing a physical change too. <br />
<br />
From her head, a pair of horns grew out and curled around towards the front of her forehead, ending by curling the points upwards, just above her eyebrows. Her ears lengthened into a pair of long points and stuck out to the sides a little more, but mostly ran up and backwards instead of poking out to the sides. <br />
<br />
From the base of her spine, a thin tail grew out, ending in a spade shape m, and was black. A pair of tiny black bat-like wings poked out from her upper back. Her crop-top adjusted its design to a backless one, in order to allow her wings to pass through without getting in their way. <br />
<br />
Finally, the white in her eyes turned dark, as her Iris became a deep, maroon color.  Her pupils turned into black hearts, though didn&#39;t impact her ability to see whatsoever. In fact, she felt her vision had been greatly improved upon opening her eyes. The dark corners of the room were much more visible now, hinting towards her now possessing some kind of inhearent night vision. And yet the brighter areas were not any less clearer for her to see despite this.<br />
<br />
With her knew knowledge, Christina regained her composure and looked down at her body. Noticing her footwear, she scoffed and snapped her fingers, changing the shoe portion of her thigh boots into platform heel with a very thin but tall heel spike. &quot;That&#39;s better.&quot; <br />
<br />
Christina turned her focus towards Mike who was watching with a satisfied smile on his face. &quot;That&#39;s quite the smile for someone who&#39;s now on my bad side.&quot; She threatened, causing the temperature in the room to suddenly drop to below 0 degrees. Mike suddenly went from happy to nervous, as an ominous chill ran down his spine that was unrelated to the zub zero temperature. <br />
<br />
Christina took a step closer towards him, and he tried to back away, but couldn’t remember how to move his body. &quot;Turning a customer into a demon with quick actions and deceitful trickery is quite a foul practice. But thankfully in your haste you made one crucial error. Did you know that if you don&#39;t precent it, turning a human into a demon will provide that person with both the knowledge and ability to properly make the most of their new form?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike barely had enough control to shake his head no. Christina reached her hand out and held his chin, touching his lips with her thump. &quot;Wanting a succubus as an assistant was a foolish choice if you don&#39;t also control her thoughts and abilities too. We succubi are quite powerful demons. Especially when up against human men. Now then, what to do with you. Should I just kill you? Let you freeze to death maybe? Or perhaps you could become my servant? Or maybe you wouldn&#39;t mind it if I sucked you dry?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike was terrified, but his body was going numb from both the cold and fear. He couldn&#39;t move a muscle, let alone speak with his chin being held. All he could do was to helplessly stare into the heart shaped pupils of the demoness before him.<br />
<br />
Their staring contest grew more and more intense as Mike slowly began to slip out of consciousness. He was just about to pass out when warmth returned to the room and the soul crushing pressure was released. Christina released him and took a step back with a satisfied smile and closed eyes. Her entire aura and personality seemed to have shifted into that of a cheerful young woman. &quot;Just kidding&quot; she said happily.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hehe, I was just messing with you since you were doing the same to me before. Now we&#39;re even, so let&#39;s try and get along.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike stared dumbfounded at the complete 180 that Christina had just pulled. &quot;You&#39;re no longer mad at me, or going to kill me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not at all. I wasn&#39;t being serious. I truly don&#39;t want to end your life. In fact I really don&#39;t like the idea of killing things, despite being a demoness.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What, the fuck...?&quot; Was all Mike could say as he rubbed his head. Christina continued to beam with a cute smile as her tail swished from side to side, contently. Despite her appearance and outfit hinting towards a more sex oriented or darker mentality, he was surprised with how kind and bright her personality actually was. The contrasting looks and personality was somehow weirdly cute. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I am glad you are no longer mad. So what now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know. You&#39;re the manager, so I guess coukd you tell me what I am supposed to do as your assistant?&quot; Suggested Christina. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, you are seriously accepting the offer? That wasn&#39;t a serious proposition. I was just tricking you into signing a contract that would turn you into a succubus and was planning to make you my girlfriend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... I see. So does that mean that I can&#39;t work here? I actually could really have used the money...&quot; replied Christina who was now a little disappointed. Seeing her become like this, Mike couldn&#39;t just let it end here. &quot;Haaa.... fine. You can work here. But it&#39;s going to be boring you know. This store isn&#39;t all that popular actually. Today we actually peaked with 2 customers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s OK. I will take to job! Not many other places would likely hire a demoness afterall, and those that would, would probably be sketchy at best...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... I can see that being the case. Well, congratulations. You&#39;re hired. There isn&#39;t exactly a set uniform, but...&quot; Mike looked up and down at Christina&#39;s rather revealing outfit, especially her crop-top that was held in front by nipple ring piercing. &quot;Well, it&#39;s fine. Not like anyone is here to complain anyways. So to begin with, I was looking to branch out into a different market, as from what you can see, business isn&#39;t exactly booming. Do you have any suggestions?&quot;</p>
