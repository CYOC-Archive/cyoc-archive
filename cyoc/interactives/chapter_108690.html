<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You roll into cover, shooting the girl that was aiming at you. You heard beams flying everywhere, and you heard some of them land on people. &quot;This match is pretty intense!&quot; You thought. You peeked over the corner, and shot a metal rod sitting in the middle of the sky, it bounced around everywhere, dodging it when it came right at you, until it shot a girl who wasn&#39;t paying attention. She became taller, more muscular, and she lost her chest and when she-, now he put his hands down his pants, he felt a penis instead of a vagina. He screamed in a more masculine tone as you chuckled, moving on to find more cover. From each hour to hour, you dodged beams, beams flying over your head, and missing them so they would get someone else, turning them to a girl overtime, but overtime, you started to get tired. You shot a girl and turned her into a boy as you rolled over into cover. You looked at the scoreboard. It said: Males: 2 Females-8. &quot;How... the heck... am I.... supposed to...&quot; You said, panting while frustrated at the same time. You didn&#39;t want to change into another gender, and the males were losing. Unless you came up with some miracle, there was no way you would win.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like i&#39;ll need to survive the match, not win...&quot; You sighed as you got up, you were sprinting around, when you heard a lazer blast. You looked behind you, and dodged pink beams, left and right, and you jumped up and down, and ducking. You kept running and ducking, until you noticed a nearly transgendered male. &quot;Not another one!&quot; You said in frustration as you ran away. Six girls ran and looked at the nearly transgendered male. You heard them call out: &quot;Our newest member is almost finished.&quot; You kept running, and running, looking for cover, until you couldn&#39;t take it anymore. You waited for them to come, and when they came, you rapid fired at them, as they did the same, you jumped and ducked and dodged, as they just moved their head while shooting. You were panting intensely. You ran away, and rolled over, you shot at that metal rod, and you heard some girls scream as you heard them run away from you. You had delayed them for now. You ran to the end of the lazer tag room, and sat down and looked at the game time. One minute left. And you were really tired. You prayed to God that you would survive the match as you took a breather. But after ten seconds, three girls were nearing you, as you looked. You decided to hide a little longer. They neared closer, and closer, and your heart started beating faster, and faster, until you decided to fire ten shots at the metal rod, and three shots straight towards them. They were dodging, but they were still near you, ten pink beams flew torwards you in every direction. You tried to shoot, but you were too afraid to make a terrible mistake. You were dodging and jumping and ducking, but then you got tired and fell down and panted.<br />
&quot;He&#39;s tired, call everyone else.&quot; The girl said as she ran torwards your direction. <br />
&quot;Crap.&quot; You thought. You looked at the timer again, thirty seconds left. You heard footsteps run towards you. You felt like you were gonna die of a heart attack. You peeked at the window, but you saw twenty pink beams bouncing on a metal rod, as they came torward you. You were rolling and ducking for your life. You ran toward them and rapid fired lots of beams as they dodged and shot at you. You were ducking and dodging, wishing for this match to end, until you decided to roll your way out. You looked at the spinning time. Ten seconds. And the girls were literally one meter away.<br />
&quot;Ten... nine...&quot; <br />
You rolled over and dodged a beam, shot a beam, blocked a beam with your beam, and kept rolling.<br />
&quot;Eight.. seven...&quot;<br />
You jumped and dodged one, and a beam just went near your hair. You attempted to rub it off, but it showed no signs of transformation.<br />
&quot;Six.... five... four..&quot;<br />
You jumped, but since you were tired as ever, you hit your head on a wall, and decided that would be good cover for three seconds.<br />
&quot;Three...&quot;<br />
The girls started running torwards you.<br />
&quot;Two...&quot;<br />
They were already in front of you, as your heart beat as fast as a jet.<br />
&quot;One...&quot;<br />
They almost pulled the trigger.<br />
&quot;Game over. Males- 1, Females- 9. Girls win this match. Please head to the Lazer Gun room to unpack your gear. Have a nice afternoon.&quot; The referee announced.<br />
The girls that were about to shoot him moaned as they went to the door. You had survived, but not won. You felt a sign of relief as you got off your hiding spot, rubbing your head as you limped all the way there.</p>
