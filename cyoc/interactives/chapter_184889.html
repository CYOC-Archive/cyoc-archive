<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">YOU HAVE BEEN MATCHED WITH LOGAN.<br />
The window read. ITEM WANTED: SLEEPING BAG. Re-adjusting time: 12 HRS. Thank you for using Chronivac Item Placement Services.<br />
<br />
Matt recoiled from the screen and looked around the room. His bedroom began to fade from existence, and were replaced by trees, foliage and shrubs. He smelled something burning, and turned around to see a campfire and tent. <br />
<br />
“Hey,” said a deep voice from inside the tent. Matt walked towards it as a burly young man climbed out.<br />
<br />
“My name’s Logan,” the man said.<br />
<br />
“Holy shit,” said Matt.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I’m glad you’re here,” Logan said, gesturing around. “It can get lonely up here some times, and it took me all day to hike up here. I really don’t feel like climbing all the way down. I got another guy… I think his name was Travis… as the tent over there.” He gestured to the tent. The tent swayed in the wind, or was it moving slightly on its own?<br />
<br />
“So we won’t be by ourselves,” Logan continued. “I hope you’re feeling tired, I’m absolutely exhausted.”<br />
<br />
Matt was starting to feel sluggish, and a strange feeling of emptiness growing inside him. It was weird.<br />
<br />
“Oh shit man, I guess you’re starting!” Logan exclaimed. Matt looked down, and realized he was suddenly naked. <br />
<br />
A slight scrunching sound started to fill the air. Matt felt a warmth wash over his body. He looked down, and saw his legs getting wider. They were merging. His toes were singing into his feet. Matt held up his hands, and saw his fingernails sink into his fingers. Then, his fingers began to sink, pulling into the palms of his hands. Matt let out a sigh, as he felt himself start to sink. Crunches filled the air as his skeleton shifted, his organs dwindling and shrivelling. His body was simplifying itself. <br />
<br />
Matt held up his hands to his hair, feeling the bizarre sensation of it slowly sucking into his head. His ass sealed up, and began to squeeze into his torso. His legs were thickening still, his feet pulling up into them. Matt suddenly felt his centre of gravity change, and he almost fell over.<br />
<br />
“Whoa bro,” Logan ran over to Matt. “Don’t fall in the dirt.” He grabbed Matt, effortlessly holding him in his muscular arms. Matt could smell Logan’s sweat mixed with Axe dry shampoo. He didn’t hate it. Logan unzipped the tent, and set Matt down on the clean Lycra base of the tent. Logan rubbed his hand along the side of the tent the way a human might caress their lover. The tent definitely shivered this time. <br />
<br />
Now that Matt was protected from the elements his transformation accelerated. His nose glazed over, and Matt groaned with pleasure. He felt that he didn’t want to close his mouth, so he just left it open. In fact, it felt better to open it even wider, so he did. As he did, his head began to stretch, merging with his torso. His torso, which had also absorbed his legs, was stretching out to accommodate Logan’s large body. Matt’s mouth deepened, as it sunk lower into his body. Matt could feel the draft permeate deep into his body. He was feeling very empty.<br />
<br />
“Looks like you’re almost done,” Logan said. He saw the young man’s eyes look up at him longingly, then slowly shrink into two dimensions on the side of the sleeping bag and glaze over. <br />
<br />
“I hope you don’t mind, but I like to sleep commando. Makes me feel closer to nature… and my company.”<br />
<br />
Logan began to peel off his tank top, revealing broad shoulders and a muscular, hairy chest. His thick legs stepped out of his dirty jeans. The mouth of the sleeping bag stretched wider in response.<br />
<br />
Matt continued to open up as his human skin thickened into soft, warm fabric to protect his owner. The hole stretched down until it reached Matt’s former feet, now stretched and altered beyond definition as the base of the sleeping bag. Matt shivered at the cold wind, as his insulation thickened. <br />
<br />
“Time for a good night’s rest.” Logan said, satisfied. A muscular hand gently but firmly gripped the side of Matt’s mouth and pulled him open. Matt could suddenly taste a huge, hairy foot, then muscular legs, a thick uncut cock and firm ass sliding inside him. He could taste every inch of Logan’s body, tired and sweaty from a long day’s hike. Logan pushed deeper, eliciting a faint groan from the sleeping bag. Once he was all in, the sleeping bag began to tighten around him.<br />
<br />
Matt was in euphoria as he felt himself wrap around the rugged outdoorsman. He began to absorb the masculine sweat and stink from the man’s body. Matt hugged his body tighter around the muscular frame.<br />
<br />
“Ugh, that’s fantastic,” mumbled Logan. “There’s nothing more comfortable than a human sleeping bag after a long day.” Logan blew the lamp out, and pulled the sleeping bag up.<br />
<br />
Logan fell asleep in a matter of minutes, rubbing the sleeping bag into his crotch as he did. He came in the night, and when he did Matt lovingly absorbed the cum into his fabric body, relishing every bit of it. Logan, his sleeping bag and his tent had a warm, relaxing evening.</p>
