<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sunlight played through the window of the nursery as morning came.  Drake and Tommy began to wake up, twisting about in their matching beds, pushing at the Sesame Street covers and yawning.  The two young men were spending the weekend together, as often happened, because of their close age, at least in the eyes of their mums.  <br />
 <br />
The two young men each wore only a thick white diaper.  Each was well used and there was a familiar sticky wetness to them that gave the boys a sense of normality and comfort.  As they woke more each became aware of the morning stiffies they had, showing as a prominent bulge in their toddler diapers.  Elmo and Big Bird were being stretched quite a lot.  Drake nursed his thumb and plucked at the bulge in his delightfully wet diapie with his other hand.  Tommy rolled out of his bed, grasping a small, dog-eared blue blankie tight to his cheek and plucking at his sagging diaper as well.  The eighteen year old former athlete blinked innocently at his cousin and then climbed into bed beside him, tugging the blankie up between them and chewing at it much the way Drake was nibbling on his thumb.  <br />
 <br />
The lay side by side for a few moments, just gazing into one another’s eyes until Drake adjusted his position and their diapered crotches rubbed up against one another’s.  Both young men smiled at the pleasant sensations this caused.  Neither had any idea what that was caused by, but they wanted more of it.  Soon they were tightly embraced, grinding back and forth and revelling in the pleasant sensations.  No words were needed, neither had more than a few anyway.  They just grunted and giggled in pleasure until the inevitable eruptions came.  <br />
 <br />
By the time their babysitter Molly poked her head in the door there were two wet, sticky diapers laying abandoned on the floor.  The two young men were stood naked on Tommy’s bed, crayons grasped awkwardly in their fists, scribbling all over the wall.  Tommy looked back at the older teen girl who was once his girlfriend, held out the red crayon in his hand to show her and declared, “Pwetties!”  <br />
 <br />
The tears he’d shed at the party were long forgotten now.  Once he’d finished that sulk he couldn’t even recall why he’d been upset.  He’d been back to romping naked in the sprinklers with his cousin with a smile on his face just moments later.  He had no memory of Molly as anything more than a friendly babysitter who he really liked.  <br />
 <br />
Molly just shook her head, knowing that the crayons were water soluble and the wall needed scribbled cleaned off it regularly.  “Is that your masterpiece?” she asked him.  <br />
 <br />
Her former boyfriend gaped back, totally uncomprehending.  Her language was now way over his head, thanks to the big wet kiss from Drake.  “Bwue!” he shouted, eyes wide.  <br />
 <br />
“No silly-billy, that’s red.  Can you say red?” she corrected, walking over and pointing at the crayon.  <br />
 <br />
Tommy’s eyes flicked down to the crayon and back to her.  “Bwue!” he shouted again, hopping on the bed so the springs creaked loudly.  <br />
 <br />
Molly chuckled. “What a cheeky monkey you are.”  <br />
 <br />
Tommy chortled and then returned to scribbling on the wall.  <br />
 <br />
Molly climbed up behind the two nude men and pecked a kiss on the back of each of their necks.  “Are my boys hungry this morning?” she asked.<br />
 <br />
Drake twisted around, dropping the crayon on the bed. “Eats!” he said, blinking.  <br />
 <br />
“Yum-yums?” Tommy asked, ceasing his colouring as well.  <br />
 <br />
Molly nodded.  “That’s right. We can have some yummy bananas and cereal!” she enthused.<br />
 <br />
“Nanas!” chirped Drake.<br />
 <br />
“Ummies!” screeched Tommy.  <br />
 <br />
“Yes, very yummy indeed,” she agreed, rubbing her tummy.  “Now let’s get going, we have a full day.”  <br />
 <br />
**<br />
 <br />
The young men made a normal sized mess of their breakfast, but most of the food got in their mouths.  Molly had to reprimand Tommy for climbing on the table at one point and Drake had to stand in the time out corner for dumping half his bowl on Tommy’s head.  There was a lot of laughing and a few tears but at the end Molly had the boys fed and cleaned up.  <br />
 <br />
Getting them dressed for the day was another matter.  Neither young man would keep a pull-up on while she tried to dress the other.  Finally she decided a trip to the mall was going to be too difficult with this pair.  They were just too rambunctious.  Instead it would have to be a trip to the park.  It was only just down the block and had a playground and sand pit.  So she got out the double stroller and called Tommy down off the couch he was scaling like a mountain and buckled him in, carefully holding his penis as she did the buckle to avoid pinching him there.  She found Drake spinning around in circles with an old cardboard box on his head.  She lifted it off him and took his hand, leading him to the stroller as well.  <br />
 <br />
“Since you two can’t keep your clothes on we’ll have to go someplace nakey boys are okay,” she explained.  <br />
 <br />
“Dwakie nakie!” the young man shouted happily, repeating one of his favourite phrases.  <br />
 <br />
Molly just nodded and strapped him in, careful to guard his penis as well.  Soon they were out on the street, Molly pushing the nude young men along the footpath towards the park.  Drake pulled his foot up between him and Tommy, wiggling his toes and admiring them. Next to his penis they were his favourite body part.  Tommy looked at his buddy’s wiggling toes and smiled.  Though he couldn’t recall the wet smooch that had made him a big naked toddler he felt an incredible sense of companionship with Drake, something he didn’t have the vocabulary to put into words anymore.  Occasionally he had the odd feeling that his happy life was all thanks to Drake and he was having just that sensation right now.  He pulled his foot up too, mirroring Drake.  They batted their feet together playfully, then side by side they slipped a big toe between their lips and began to suck.  <br />
 <br />
Molly wheeled the toe-sucking young men into the park looking for a good spot to sit and wait while they played.  She settled on a park bench facing the sand-pit.  There was a sizable group of little toddlers and pre-school aged kids playing there, with parents and older siblings watching on.  Molly undid the boys’ straps and let them loose.  Some parents shook their heads but most just shrugged or even cooed at the sight of two naked toddlers scurrying into the sand-pit.  Molly sat down and began reading her book.  <br />
 <br />
Drake had just emerged from the sandpit when he noticed a teen boy sitting alone at the edge of the playground area.  He looked to be about Tommy’s age and he didn’t look very happy.  He was wearing a black t-shirt with a white skull insignia at the middle and a pair of tight black pants with combat boots.  His hair was oiled up and combed straight.  He looked like a goth kid, probably forced to watch a younger sibling play.  <br />
 <br />
Drake toddled over to wear the young man sat in the shadows.  <br />
 <br />
Jack watched the naked toddler approach him from the sandpit.  He couldn’t believe some people let their kids run around like that.  At least his little brother Josh was more modest than that.  This kid walked right up to his side, then dropped to his hands and knees to see him up close.  For a second it seemed like the toddler’s size was out of proportion to Jack’s but he forgot about that after only a second.  <br />
 <br />
“Go away kid, I’m not here to play with you,” he said sternly.  <br />
 <br />
Drake pouted. “Pwayin’ fun,” he insisted.  <br />
 <br />
“Find another stupid little toddler to play with,” he ordered. “Look for someone else with their pee-pee hanging out.  I’m sure they’ll be keener to play some silly little game with you.”  <br />
 <br />
Jack was surprised when the boy’s reaction to his rebuke was to lean in and plant a big wet toddler smooch on his cheek.  Jack pulled backwards as though burned. “Ugh! Baby germs! That’s disgusting,” he complained.  <br />
 <br />
Drake giggled and got back to his feet, toddling away.  <br />
 <br />
Jack watched the little jaybird toddle off and just shook his head, wiping away the spittle on his cheek with his shirt.  He hated getting exposed to germs like that.  He looked around for Josh, wanting to just get the kid and leave.  But as he stood up he felt an odd, light-headed, giddy sensation in his head.  He pushed the feeling aside, focussing on what he needed to do.  He had to find Josh.  <br />
 <br />
Jack started walking around the edge of the play area, feeling this growing fuzzy, foggy sensation in his head.  What was he doing again? He wanted to leave of course.  He looked back at the kids before him.  Why did he want to leave? That looked like a lot of fun.  Why was he sitting off the side all this time while the others played?  <br />
 <br />
Jack headed for the sand-pit.  Sand was always fun.  He remembered having lots of good times at the beach.  He stopped at the edge, remembering to take off his shoes and socks first. He didn’t want sandy boots.  He left them at the edge and walked into the sand. It was warm and soft around his toes.  There was a toy Tonka digger truck sitting unused there. That would be lots of fun to push around, making pretend he was a construction man.  Jack started to pick it up when something hard smacked the side of his bare foot, making him yelp.  <br />
 <br />
He looked down to see a little boy in shortalls had driven his toy car into his foot.  <br />
 <br />
“Sowwy,” said the little boy, meekly.  <br />
 <br />
Jack suddenly realised where he was.  Why the hell had he come into the sand-pit?  Jesus, he was about to play with some pre-schooler Tonka truck!  He needed to clear his mind, and that started with leaving the sand-pit.  <br />
 <br />
Jack hastily turned to get out, smacking right into a woman holding an ice cream cone for her little girl while she played.  Orange ice cream was now smeared all over his t-shirt!  Jack felt embarrassed and flustered.  He just stood there gaping at the mess, feeling a sense of helplessness, as though he might actually cry over the silly little mistake.  Why was he getting so overly worked up?  <br />
 <br />
“Oh I’m sorry,” the woman with the cone apologised.  “Are you okay sweetie?” she asked.<br />
 <br />
Jack thought it was weird the way she was talking to him, almost like he was the same age as her little girl playing in the sand.  <br />
 <br />
“I… I’m okay,” he stuttered.<br />
 <br />
The woman looked his shirt over. “Oh no, we’ve made quite a mess. Is your mummy here? She may have a change of clothes.”  <br />
 <br />
Jack was feeling very confused now. He shook his head. “No… no, I’m here with my brother,” he explained.  <br />
 <br />
“Is he nearby?” she asked.<br />
 <br />
Jack looked around.  “No, I don’t see him.”<br />
 <br />
The woman gave him a compassionate smile.  “It’s okay honey, I’m sure he’s around.  But I think we better take this shirt off before it gets any worse.”  <br />
 <br />
Jack blinked, not sure he’d heard her right.  “What?”<br />
 <br />
The woman was already grasping the bottom of his ruined t-shirt, pulling it up to expose his stomach.  Jack managed to grab the shirt and hold it down.  “No, I can’t take my shirt off,” he managed to say, shocked she’d even suggest it.  <br />
 <br />
“Oh don’t be a silly-billy,” she chided. “There are other boys with no shirts on, and some with much less,” she chuckled.  “You’ll be much more comfy,” she assured, lifting again.  <br />
 <br />
Jack looked around to see the other teens without shirts on. But all he saw was a couple little pre-school aged boys wearing just their shorts, one in just underoos and two little toddlers who were completely naked. No one his age was undressed at all.  But before he knew it she had the shirt up over his head and suddenly he was bare-chested.  <br />
 <br />
“There, that’s much better isn’t it?” she cooed.<br />
 <br />
Jack wanted to tell her no, scream at the bitch to give him his shirt back right now.  But actually it did feel good, really good.  The sun was warm on his skin and the breeze was just right.  The sand was still delightful on his feet, it was just like the beach.  He found himself nodding instead.  <br />
 <br />
“Would you like to use the digger?” the woman asked.<br />
 <br />
Jack squinted, feeling confused.  <br />
 <br />
“Here,” said a little voice below him.  He looked down to see the four or five year old girl in the pretty pink dress offering him a Tonka digger truck toy like the one he’d just seen.  She wanted to share with him.  That was so nice of her. She was such a big girl, sharing and all.  And it did look like a lot of fun.  <br />
 <br />
“Okay,” Jack mumbled, taking the digger from the girl and getting down on his hands and knees, shirtless in the sand.  He pushed the digger into the sand and watched it make a little path.  It was very rewarding.  A hand patted the top of his head.  <br />
 <br />
“That’s a good boy,” the mum with the cone cooed to him.  It made him feel all warm inside.  <br />
 <br />
Jack pushed the digger in a big circle, creeping after it on hands and knees, enjoying the warm sun on his back.  He looked up at a little boy who was doing just what he was, wearing only his shorts in fact.  Jack smiled at this similar boy and then realised that the child was probably only three or four years old.  What the fuck was he doing?!<br />
 <br />
Jack pushed the toy away and started to stand up.  As he did this he became aware of the warmth spreading down the insides of his thighs.  He looked down and saw the dark stain around the crotch of his skinny black jeans.  He gasped.  “What the hell?!” he exclaimed.  He hadn’t felt the urge to pee, hadn’t even felt himself peeing.  <br />
 <br />
“Oh dear. Have you had an accident honey?” came a familiar voice.  <br />
 <br />
Jack looked up, beet red with shame, at the ice cream woman.  She looked concerned for him, and that made it even worse.  What kind of teen wet his pants while playing shirtless and barefoot in the sandbox with toddler toys?  <br />
 <br />
“He’s done pee-pee in his pants mummy,” the little girl who shared her toy with him declared, pointing for all to see.  <br />
 <br />
Her mother shushed her.  “It’s okay honey, little boys have accidents, it just happens sometimes.”  <br />
 <br />
She’d called him a little boy. He wanted to curl up and hide under a log.  <br />
 <br />
“I’m not little,” he managed to squeak out pitifully.<br />
 <br />
The woman knelt before him and put a reassuring hand on his shoulder. “No, of course you aren’t sweetie. We understand that.  Big boys have accidents sometimes too.”  <br />
 <br />
It felt condescending at first, but then her words seemed to sooth him. Big boys did have accidents now and then, it was okay.  He was feeling so lost, so foggy in the head, it was good she was here to help think for him.  She’d make it okay.  <br />
 <br />
“We need to get you out of these wet clothes.  You still don’t see your brother?”  <br />
 <br />
Jack shook his head.  Not that finding Josh would help.  How could his 7 year old little brother help him now? He was the last person he wanted to know he’d wet his pants in public.  <br />
 <br />
She frowned. “Well honey these pants are soaked.  You’ll get sick staying in them all afternoon.  We need to let them dry out.”  <br />
 <br />
Jack was confused.  How could they dry out if he was wearing them?  Then he felt her thumbs sink into the side of his waist, hooking themselves under his underwear as well.  What the hell was she doing?  <br />
 <br />
She saw his look of shock and said in a calm voice.  “It’s okay honey-bun, you won’t be the only bare bum in the park.  See those two little ones over there. They’re about your age. You should just go play with them until your brother finds you,” she suggested, nodding at the two naked little toddlers climbing on the playground slide, showing off their bare bums to everyone.  <br />
 <br />
Jack realised with horror what she meant.  But it was too late.  He felt the breeze as she yanked his pants and undies down to his ankles, exposing his flapping penis to the whole park.  Jack froze in shock.  He felt her lifting his feet to slip the wet garments off them one at a time, but he didn’t fight it.  He was too stunned to do a thing.  And what stunned him most of all, was that no one seemed to be staring.  Parents on benches glanced right at him, right at his exposed penis, and then went back to flipping through their magazines or texting on their phones.  This woman was treating him like he was really a toddler, the little girl was too and now it seemed everyone saw only another naked tot in the sand box.  <br />
 <br />
“There we go, I’m sure that’s much nicer isn’t it?” she asked.  <br />
 <br />
Jack looked back at her and his head felt like it was swimming.  His brain just wasn’t working.  He was naked, in the park, and it felt… good.  <br />
 <br />
“I… I naked,” he managed to state.<br />
 <br />
She nodded, a smile on her face. “Yep, you’re just a jaybird now.  I hope your mummy doesn’t get upset.”  <br />
 <br />
His mummy.  Feelings of love and happiness filled him.  Everything before he came to the sandbox was starting to get fuzzy.  He tried to focus and found he couldn’t recall what school he went to or what he was studying.  It was a scary feeling.  He felt utterly lost.  Then it came back to him. He was eighteen, he was watching his little brother play.  How had he forgotten that?  He needed to find Josh now.  <br />
 <br />
Jack rushed past the woman.  The sand was so soft, so nice on his feet. Then he was on grass and it was even nicer.  There were so many children playing here and they all looked so happy.  He wanted to play too.  All the happy feelings were getting so strong now and as he looked down he saw the huge stiffy between his legs.  As he rounded the playground, the soft matting now under his bare soles, his erect penis bobbed against his tummy and the lovely feeling grew stronger by the moment.  <br />
 <br />
He had to find Josh, even if it meant his little bro saw him naked like this.  He’d be able to help him, get mummy maybe.  He could picture mummy, but not her real name.  In fact he could picture his house but the street name and number were gone, just a blank space in his mind.  He tried to think hard.  He was Jack.  But what was his last name?  So many things were suddenly missing and with each thing he forgot his stiffy got more engorged.  Why was it so pleasant to forget?  It only made him yearn to forget even more, to forget it all.  Forget why he was embarrassed about being naked, forget he was really a teenager who shouldn’t be nude in a park or playing with toys in the sand, or looking for his little brother to help him.  <br />
 <br />
He saw him! Josh was riding down the really long slide, still wearing the stupid little SpongeBob t-shirt and baggy green board shorts. He was barefoot, because he was a silly little kid, that’s how Jack had thought of it before. But now he saw Josh’s dirty bare soles emerge from the tunnel slide and he felt a sense of kinship.  He was barefoot too now.  The ground felt lovely on his soles.  They could be barefoot brothers now.  But then Josh was so big, wearing his t-shirt and shorts.  Jack had nothing on at all.  <br />
 <br />
Jack stopped in his tracks.  Josh was walking off the slide.  He looked so nice, so happy.  Being his big brother wasn’t fun. Being a big teen wasn’t that fun.  And it felt so, so nice to forget.  Maybe it would be nice to forget it all.  Was that even possible?  Jack gripped his stiff penis and gave it a nice hard stroke.  It was all it took.  Warm sticky goo splattered across his tummy, launched in ropes through the air, splashing the ground.  Jack grunted as he felt an overwhelming orgasm and the wonderful sensation of forgetting.  <br />
 <br />
**<br />
 <br />
Josh smiled as he slid down the plastic tube slide again, bouncing around the corners.  As he emerged back into the daylight he saw Jacky standing naked in the middle of the playground drawing on his tummy with some kind of white goo.  <br />
 <br />
“Jacky what are you doing?” he called, walking over to the naked teen.  <br />
 <br />
Jacky looked up from painting his tummy with cum.  His face was relaxed now, content.  “I fowgets!” he announced cheerily.  <br />
 <br />
Josh giggled. “You forgot what?”<br />
 <br />
Jacky gaped slack jawed a moment, then shrugged. “Dunno,” he admitted.  <br />
 <br />
“I guess you forgot everything then,” Josh joked.<br />
 <br />
Jacky nodded eagerly. “Uh-huh. Eberyding fowgetts.”  <br />
 <br />
“You even forget what happened to your clothes?” he asked the nudist.<br />
 <br />
Jack toyed with his now soft penis.  He looked around and then declared, “Dem go bye-bye.”  <br />
 <br />
“Well I’m not ready to walk you home yet. So why don’t you play with those other naked babies,” he said, pointing to Drake and Tommy.  <br />
 <br />
“Notta baby,” Jack huffed, frowning as he popped a thumb in his mouth.  <br />
 <br />
“Of course not. You’re just a naked big boy,” Josh taunted.  <br />
 <br />
Jack didn’t understand the mocking.  He smiled and nodded now.  “Jaybiwd!” he chirped.  <br />
 <br />
“Okay, well go run off and play nakey jaybird.”  <br />
 <br />
Jack did just that.  When the naked young man toddled over and knelt next to them Drake instantly recognised the teen from earlier.  He was a lot more fun now, and a lot smilier.  They were very sad to part ways when Molly put them back in the stroller and Josh took Jacky by the hand and walked him back to their house a few blocks away.  <br />
 <br />
They didn’t see each other again.  Drake’s kiss got him a playmate for a couple hours that day and that made it totally worth it for him.  It didn’t bother him that Jacky’s mind was left at toddler level for the long term.  <br />
 <br />
A few weeks later Jack attended what should have been his senior prizegiving at the local college.  But instead of sitting with the prizewinners he was back in the audience.  Instead of wearing his school uniform he was in an Elmo t-shirt and pull-ups.  While his friends and classmates processed across the stage he nibbled at his binkie and watched his toes wiggle along the top of the seat in front of him.  <br />
 <br />
Then as his best friend was called to get his prize something in the back of Jack’s mind flickered to life.  His eyes lit with intelligence and the binkie dropped from his mouth as he recognised where he was and what was going on.  There was a wave of revulsion and awful shame that made him wince and lean forward like he might vomit.  Josh saw this expression and thought he might have gas.  He reached out and lightly tickled the sole of Jack’s bare foot.  <br />
 <br />
“You okay jaybird?” he asked, using the boy’s new nickname.  <br />
 <br />
Whether it was the tickle or the nickname, he wasn’t sure. But something wonderful happened when his brother said that.  Jacky instantly creamed his pull-ups.  There was a wave a pleasurable relaxation and release.  He leant back in the seat, smiled at his big brother and grabbed his foot to give his tootsies a better examination.  Soon the toes were in his mouth, a big grin or oral satisfaction on his face and Josh knew it was okay again.</p>
