<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Justin stepped through the door to the huge house his mother owned and kicking off his shoes, thought, &quot;That was really weird,&quot; as his mind went over the events that had just taken place.<br />
<br />
After the swim meet, and meeting Paul, he and Nadine had walked down to the mall together and went window shopping. Afterward, the got a bite to eat in the food court and started to walk home. It turned out that both him and Nadine were practically neighbors as she bid him goodbye one block before his house.<br />
<br />
Bothered by all that was happening, he listened and breathed a quiet sigh of relief as he could not hear his mother anywhere. Upstairs, he could hear a radio playing and knew his sister to be home. Sighing, glad that it was just Amanda that was home, he began to make his way up to his room. Inside, he drops his backpack on the bed and then stops when it becomes apparent that something about his room is different.<br />
<br />
Looking at the bed, he takes in the large, fluffy green, blue and pink stripped comforter and the blue sheets with white polka dots beneath it. Standing next to bed, Justin looks around the room.<br />
<br />
White walls covered with posters of cute looking guys, popular bands, Twilight Themed posters and other decorations cover the walls. In one corner is a tall, full body mirror with a couple of medals hanging off one side. Next to it is his desk and a vanity. Turning in the other direction, Justin sees a fancy looking dresser, complete with a jewelry box atop it.<br />
<br />
Confused, he opens the closet and steps in. Were he normally kept his clothes for formal occasions, Justin finds a couple of dresses, nylons and a couple of slips.<br />
<br />
Thinking, &quot;This is getting out of hand,&quot; he closes the door and walks out of his room and down the hall.<br />
<br />
Knocking on his sister's door, he waited as she turned down the music and then when she answer, he asked, &quot;Has mom been in my room. Because something about it looks different.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amanda looks thoughtful for a moment and then shakes her head as she tells him, &quot;Not that I am aware of, Jupiter. You know mom and her rule about a teenage girl needing her privacy and how this is an important time in our lives when out bodies begin to enter womanhood.&quot;<br />
<br />
Justin nodded, bothered by how she addressed him and then without thinking about it, he says, &quot;Yeah. I kind of forgot. That, Amelia,&quot; and turned to go back to his room...not realising he had just addressed his twin sister by her first name rather then by her first name.<br />
<br />
Back inside his room, Justin thought about removing the bra, but changed his mind and instead laid down on the bed. Inside his mind, a jumble of thoughts moved about and he tried to sort out what was what. As he lay there, his hand absently drifted toward his chest and without giving it much thought, he began to rub his chest and nipples...which had suddenly become sore and tender.<br />
<br />
As Justin lay there doing this, one thought remained constant and kept cropping up. This being a worry about whether it was getting close to that time of the month or not.<br />
<br />
A knock on his door suddenly distracted Justin and sitting up, he answer with, &quot;Come in.&quot;<br />
<br />
Standing, he turned as the door opened and his sister entered. Looking at Justin, she asked a very personal question...a question that was just on Justin's mind.<br />
<br />
Shaking his head, he explained, &quot;No. I was wondering the same thing. I think we should ask mother if she has any.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amanda nodded at this and replied, &quot;I'll ask when she gets home,&quot; and then excused herself from the room. As she left, Justin turned back to the dresser, wondering something about its contents.<br />
<br />
Walking toward the dresser, he opened the top drawer and heaved a worried sigh as he saw that the contents included more bras, underwear and socks fitting for a young girl. Lifting up one of the brassieres, he read the tag, which stated that the cup size was an A and the band size was a twenty eight.<br />
<br />
Dropping the bra back into the drawer, Justin opened the next drawer. Inside was a mixture of both girls and boys shirts. The next drawer down contained pants fitting for either sex and gender and in the final drawer, Justin found a mixture of male and female pyjamas.<br />
<br />
Shutting the drawer, Justin laid down on the bed, and then immediately jumped up as he noticed something was off.<br />
<br />
Walking over to the mirror, he looked into the reflective object, blinked and then turned sideways. Reaching down, he grasped the hem of his shirt and proceeded to remove the garment. Standing in only the bra his mother forced him to wear this morning...&quot;Did she? Or did I put it on myself because I normally wear undergarments like,&quot; Justin asked himself...he looked into the mirror.<br />
<br />
After a bit, he reached up and undid the clasp in the front. Bra hanging loosely, Justin saw exactly what he feared. Looking at the swell of the two A size cups that now made up his chest, Justin commented, &quot;Great. I've got boobs. What else can wrong and why is this happening.&quot; Before him, his nipples grew hard and as he watched this, he realised that not only was the areola was also bigger then before, but also his breast had taken on a milky white appearance and his nipples and the surrounding area where now bright pink.</p>
