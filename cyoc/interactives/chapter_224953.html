<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">after Olivia grabbed her bag she headed to the bathroom. Alex soon noticed his bag had tipped over causing the mask to slide out. getting up he grabbed it. &quot;Bet I&#39;d she&#39;ll be surprised if I jump out at her with this&quot; he grinned as he grabbed it. turning it he saw the inside had some flesh color to it.  <br />
<br />
he placed it on his head and went to a mirror. he grinned then found the mask doing the same thing. he felt the mask and could feel his fingers underneath the scales. his eyes started to hurt causing him to blink. once he opened them he found he no longer saw the mask&#39;s eye holes in his peripheral.  <br />
<br />
what he did see was a blue muzzle dotted with dark blue spots. his ears moved into the second set of horns on his head as white spikes grew down his neck. he blinked his large red eyes as he tried in vain to pull it off. All he did was pull the original latex of the mask. this soon turned to goo and covered his hands and neck.  <br />
<br />
he found himself unable to scream as his hands shrank. callused fingers soon became thin and dainty while small claws adorned them. the blue goo moved up his arms. As it did his muscles seemed to vanish. his body now gave off husky feminine grunts as soon as he could speak again.  <br />
<br />
the front of his neck became white like his lower muzzle. now the goop on his arms and neck connected on his shoulders. white covered his front and blue with dark blue spots on his back. his hair and muscles vanishing beneath the goop before it hardened into scales. once his waist was covered he gasped as his genital s felt wrong.  <br />
<br />
his hips changed as a long tail grew out of his larger ass. he felt the goo go inside him. In reality, Alex was gaining a vagina and womb. She soon felt a gush of fluids and began massaging her new opening. her legs got covered in scales. unlike the rest of her body, her legs didn&#39;t lose much muscle.  <br />
<br />
her feet became three toes with white claws. the kobold woman soon found herself looking up at the mirror. then she found it out of her view entirely. She cumed as she shrank 2 and a half feet tall. &quot;what the heck?&quot; she said shocked by this.  <br />
<br />
suddenly she heard what sounded like a howling and a thud repeating. She ran remarkably fast to the bathroom door. knocking on it she asked, &quot;Honey are you okay?&quot; before a red light surged outwards from the bathroom. the door opened to reveal a giant fluffy wolf man. &quot;I&#39;m fine I guess,&quot; he said.  <br />
<br />
Alex began to stumble as the house shook. quickly Oliver grabbed his wife with a speed that almost rivaled her own. They both realize that despite the massive shoulder length of the werewolf he was able to get through the door. glancing at it they saw it expanding. how it was just wide enough for both his shoulders.  <br />
<br />
the height had increased to allow him to be able to pass through without ducking. new memories came to their minds about remodeling the house for themselves. a smaller door appeared inside the bigger one. this was due to the fact Alex couldn&#39;t reach the doorknob now. a draining sound could be heard as the cum went down the new drain.  <br />
<br />
glancing around the room they noticed more pet products for snakes and dogs. memories came forward of them being the only health products to help them in day-to-day life. scratches littered the walls as Oliver liked it that way, at least the wolf did. Oliver suddenly remembered he could shift to a human and back anytime he wanted. except for a full moon that is.  <br />
<br />
which is why he was stuck in wolf form. they both looked out the bathroom window to see a full moon. time seemed to skip forward as it was still daylight when these changes happened. suddenly a ding-dong was heard. memories of it being their night came to them.  <br />
<br />
old-looking bandages wrapped around Oliver as fur dye made him completely black for this one night. Egyptian clothing soon covered him. Alex soon found a dress covering her body as plastic elf ears adorned her head. &quot;well &#39;Anubis&#39; I&#39;ll get... the candy?&quot; memories of getting candy popped into her head. As they headed to the door, they found just how much their house changed.  <br />
<br />
claw marks littered the walls, floor, and ceiling of every room. some of the furniture had scratches too. Alex grabbed the blood-red candy bowl and approached the door. she opened it to find two kids and their parents. one was dressed as a superhero and the other a fairy.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Happy Halloween kids,&quot; she said as she gave them candy. they thanked her as they left. both of them glanced at the yard. it was covered in tombstones and pumpkins.  the trees outside gave the musky scent of Oliver causing his ears to go down in embarrassment.  <br />
<br />
They then looked around their house some more. any pictures of Olivia and Alex were replaced with Oliver and his kobold wife, either in his black and white werewolf form or in a human bodybuilder form. a check of their closet revealed a lack of clothes, for Alex at least. Oliver found many human clothes that couldn&#39;t contain his wolf body. &quot;guess these are my human clothes&quot; he said before noticing a necklace with a human figure on it.  <br />
<br />
grabbing it he was suddenly a human man that appeared in their pictures. &quot;whoa how&#39;d you do that?&quot; Alex asked. &quot;it&#39;s this necklace,&quot; he said as it now showed a wolf. &quot;let me try it!&quot; Alex exclaimed as she grabbed it from him. he was now back in his werewolf form.  <br />
<br />
Alex on the other hand looked like a female version of his former self. &quot;cool at least I can look human&quot; she said. however, she weirdly found herself uncomfortable. as if this wasn&#39;t her true form. taking it off it went from a dragon to a human. &quot;what&#39;s wrong?&quot; Oliver asked crouching down to get eye level with his wife. &quot;it works but this feels like the real me&quot; she said sighing.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I know what you mean. I feel fine even now I&#39;m a giant fluffy wolf man. before you ask the shorts won&#39;t work the other way. see?!&quot; he said pulling down his shorts. his red rocket poking out.  <br />
<br />
Alex suddenly licked her lips. &quot;um Alex what...&quot; At an unfathomable speed, she closed the distance. She began rubbing and licking the red shaft. Oliver soon found himself moaning as pre-cum escaped the tip. a new instinct of mating came to him.  <br />
<br />
he picked up Alex with one hand and threw him onto their bed. As if she knew what he had planned she lifted her tail and took in his cock. her belly bulging even though it barely took in a fourth of the cock. he slammed into her over and over. soon he cumed into his mate.  <br />
<br />
after a while, they would get up smiling. it had been the best sex ever. soon more trick-or-treaters came. they repeated giving candy till they were all out.  <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
the kitsune smiled as he watched them. &quot;ah, so wonderful when they accept it. of course, denying it is fun too&quot; he laughed. he smiled as he went to the front of the store. this was his busiest day.  <br />
<br />
he&#39;d replaced an empty store at a strip mall this time. the number of customers was through the roof. he didn&#39;t even have to shift locations. of course, he also had to check in on his latest shoppers. soon however the greatest night would end. still, he was having the time of his life.</p>
