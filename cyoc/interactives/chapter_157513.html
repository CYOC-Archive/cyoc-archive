<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After some consideration, Jenny decided to stay female for now, but thought that she may want to change herself some more.<br />
<br />
Jenny thought about how short she appeared near her new mom. She knew she herself was tall, taller than most women and many men, and that she was likely to grow even taller as puberty continued, but she wanted to be taller, and now.<br />
She opened her height tab and changed her height from 5’10” to 6’6”, the same height as her mom. It would have made her extremely tall for any woman, let alone for a 14 year old. After consideration she declined the option, thinking that if she’ll get taller, she’ll go all out, towering over her mom her mom. No, not just taller than her mom, taller than every person on earth!<br />
She slid changed the height to a clean 9 feet tall, taller than any human that ever walked the earth.<br />
Going for a bit more advanced options, she changed it so her legs take to take an enormous 65% percent of her upcoming height.<br />
<br />
After typing that, she looked at her small chest and wanted to improve her curves right now, even though they were likely to grow more as she matured farther.<br />
She looked at both her breast tab and her butt tab and the tab for her hips and increased them farther, to what she thought would still be a large size even at 9’.<br />
<br />
Jenny then saw a strange slider which said “How much relatives change to suit the new reality”. She assumed that it meant that the more the slider went to the right, the more her mom and grandparents would also grow to suit her genetics.<br />
After some hesitation, she placed the slider at around the middle, thinking that she would still tower over her mom if she did so while having her mom tower over anyone else.<br />
<br />
Jenny saw several check boxes:<br />
X Keep current memories<br />
X Keep current skills (skills, education, names, etc...)<br />
_ Add memories of new life<br />
_ Add knowledge of new life (skills, education, names, etc...)<br />
<br />
Wanting to discover her new life while still not being completely confused about it (knowing what to do, who are her friends and other things), Jenny only checked the addition of the new knowledge, while keeping the addition of new memories unchecked.<br />
<br />
After some hesitation, she clicked enter, and immediately felt her body rise upwards and outwards as it grew in all directions.<br />
She felt the most notable part of her rising height being her legs.<br />
Looking up, the ceiling appeared to have a race with her rising height, though her height growth seemed to be catching up.<br />
<br />
The changes then suddenly stopped. Looking up, her room’s ceiling was about 10 feet tall. About two feet taller than it was before, but it felt unusually close. Raising her hand up, it quickly touched it.<br />
Jenny then looked around her room and saw that her door was about as tall as her height, presumably made when she was younger without the assumptions that she would be as tall as she is now. Looking at her bed, it was enormous and extremely long. Lookout at her computer, it looked like both the table and the chair next to it were drastically higher, with the chair also being wider. She noticed how the actual difference between the sitting point of the chair and the top of the table wasn’t too drastic, presumably due to most of her height coming from legs, making her sitting height tall, but not nearly as drastic.<br />
<br />
Jenny then looked down at herself, or at least tried to as her was blocked by a large pair of breasts. She didn’t know their exact size, but they sure seemed for a 14 year old, even for a one of such height.<br />
She lifted her leg, loosing balance for a bit, and saw an impossibly long and elegant structure in front of her, standing far forward.<br />
“That is amazing” Jenny said as she noticed her voice feeling different. Deeper and louder than before.<br />
She went to the bathroom to check herself in the mirror when she felt a very painful hit on her forehead.<br />
“Ouch” she said as she rubbed the hurting place, only to come to the realization that she was taller than her doorframe.<br />
She ducked and went through.<br />
Aside from a higher ceiling, the structure on the hallway felt the same, she noticed how much fewer steps it took for her to get through.<br />
She once again ducked under the doorframe (thankful that door also changed) and went inside.<br />
Inside the bathroom, the shower head because much higher, literally coming from the ceiling.<br />
In addition, the bathroom’s mirror became a full length one.<br />
Looking at said full length mirror, she finally saw herself fully.<br />
She was thin, and extremely elongated, with a lot of it coming for her extremely long legs, each as long as her height a few minutes ago, taller than most people by themselves. They were thin and elegant, but still muscular and powerful.<br />
Looking a bit higher and turning to the side, she saw wide hips and large butt.<br />
Continuing to raise her view, she saw her torso, quickly replaced by a huge pair of breasts. Had she been normal height, they would have probably still been an E cup or an F cup, but who knows how large they are on that body. These sizes were enormous considering she was still 14.<br />
<br />
After the examination, Jenny went down the stairs, careful to not stumble on the steps with her huge feet, and met her mom.<br />
She towered over her mom, but not as much as she expected.<br />
Her mom looked curvier and much taller than she was before, presumably due to Jenny making the change partially affect her relatives, but she wasn’t nearly as tall as her daughter. Her curves were about the same as her daughter’s when compared to her height, but she was a mature woman that had given birth (it was still weird for Jenny to think that she was originally his little sister when he was an average boy).<br />
Jenny’s curiosity got the best of her, and she asked her mom her height.<br />
“Don’t you remember sweety? I just reminded it for you today...” replied Emily. “I am 7’9”.<br />
“Thanks, I don’t know why I forgot that...” replied Jenny.<br />
<br />
Jenny was in a very strange situation and she loved it. She was the tallest person to ever walk the earth with amazing curves while she was still only 14. Her mom was gigantic while still dwarfed by her daughter.<br />
The real question was what to do next.</p>
