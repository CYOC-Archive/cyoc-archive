<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Todd, Mark, and Xarxos hopped out of the car they had rented to get to the airstrip. Waiting for them on the runway was a sleek black private jet that could hold about ten passengers. <br />
<br />
“Woah…this thing looks nice!” Mark said, admiring the design of the jet. “How much did it cost you to rent this thing Xarxos?” <br />
<br />
Xarxos laughed and shook his head. “I didn’t rent this jet,” he said. “I own it! Perks of being the CEO of a sex toy empire and getting most everything that I could steal from Sebastian’s mansion before the FBI raided it.”<br />
<br />
Mark cocked his head in confusion. “Sebastian?”<br />
<br />
“The former owner of the Book of Myth,” Todd explained. “He was a dick.” <br />
<br />
“Duly noted…” <br />
<br />
The trio of foxes boarded the jet. Upon seeing the luxurious inside, Mark’s eyes widened. He quickly set his bags down in one of the seats near the front before plopping down on the large couch, looking at the TV that had been built into the wall near the back of the plane. <br />
<br />
“I’ve always wanted to fly in a private jet before!” he said, kicking his paws up and sighing in relaxation.<br />
<br />
Todd looked to Xarxos. “Is this the same jet we took to LA?” he asked. <br />
<br />
The muscular fox nodded. “Yeah, when reality shifted, it came into our possession,” he said. “Pretty sweet, huh?” <br />
<br />
Todd nodded his head. “Yeah,” he said, looking at the curtains that hid the back of the plane. “Sweet…” <br />
<br />
Xarxos sat down on the sofa across from Mark, and Todd sat down next to him. “So, while we’re waiting for the pilot to get here, we should start discussing our strategy for dealing with Time,” the muscular fox said. “I’m opening the floor for suggestions.” <br />
<br />
“Well, I’ve got a question,” Mark said. “What the hell can Time do? You’ve been talking him up this entire time, but you’ve never actually told us what he can use his book to do.” <br />
<br />
“Oh…right,” Xarxos replied, scratching the back of his head in embarrassment. “I suppose that is rather important to explain. Dolan, aka Time, can use his book to manipulate the flow of time. He can make you older, make you younger, revert you to a fetus, freeze people in time, and freeze time itself for everyone but him. In addition, he’s also able to jump timelines and take the place of any one of his multiverse equivalents. If you killed one version of him, another version would come right back to take his place.” <br />
<br />
“So…he’s basically Funny Lover and GIO from MoJo’s Strange Adventure?” Todd asked. <br />
<br />
Xarxos gave him a confused look. “He’s who now?” <br />
<br />
“Characters from an anime,” Todd explained. “Well, technically one of them’s only in the manga because that part hasn’t been adapted into an anime yet.”<br />
<br />
“Oh yeah!” Mark exclaimed, sitting up. “Now that you mention it, he does sound a lot like a mix of Funny Lover and GIO!” <br />
<br />
“Who the hell are Funny Lover and GIO?!” Xarxos asked, sounding a bit annoyed. <br />
<br />
“Oh right, we should explain,” Todd said, laughing nervously. “So basically, GIO is the big bad guy from MoJo’s Strange Adventure Part 3: Stardust Knights. He’s a vampire with something called a “Spirit” that allows him to stop time for 11 seconds at a time. During that time, he can freely move and interact with the world around him.”<br />
<br />
“Okay…and who’s the other guy?” <br />
<br />
“Funny Lover is the villain of MoJo’s Strange Adventure Part 7: Platinum Ball Sprint,” Mark explained. “His Spirit gives him the ability to jump through timelines and switch places with other versions of himself, just like Dolan can.”<br />
<br />
“So you’re telling me that this anime and manga has two villains that have the same abilities as Dolan?” Xarxos asked, his eyes wide. “Well, that’s great news! We can use how they were defeated to defeat Dolan!” He paused a second before asking “They were defeated, right?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, they were,” Todd confirmed. “I guess you could say that they ‘bit the dust?’“ Mark groaned and Xarxos just looked at the smaller fox in confusion. <br />
<br />
“I’m going to assume that was another MoJo reference that I don’t understand,” the muscular fox said. “Anyways, tell me how these guys were defeated!” <br />
<br />
“Well, GIO was defeated when the main character of Part 3, Mosake Joesun, realized that his spirit, Star Titan, was the same type of spirit as GIO’s spirit, The Earth. That meant that Mosake could also stop time and move when GIO stopped time. Then he punched GIO so hard his head exploded.”<br />
<br />
Xarxos looked to Mark in confusion, and the white-furred fox just nodded in confirmation. “It’s called MoJo’s Strange Adventure for a reason,” he said. <br />
<br />
“Okay, so then how was the other guy defeated?”<br />
<br />
“One of the spirit users used their spirit’s power to destroy every single alternate version of Funny Lover in every timeline at once, save for the original. That allowed the hero, Montana Joesun, to kill the original without any of his alternate versions coming to replace him.”<br />
<br />
Xarxos groaned in frustration. “Well that’s just great,” he said. “We can’t use either of those options! There’s no way for us to move through stopped time or stop time ourselves without the Book of Time, and there’s no way we could kill all those versions of Dolan at once, even if they are all in the same place!”<br />
<br />
“Wait…every version of Dolan is in the same place right now?” Todd asked, his eyes widening. <br />
<br />
“Yeah, they are,” Xarxos confirmed. “The Dolan from our timeline summoned them all here to work at his casino, from what I remember. Narcissistic fuck.” <br />
<br />
“So then that means that all we need to do is figure out how to kill all of them at once, then kill the original,” Mark said. “A difficult task, but I don’t think that it’s impossible.”<br />
<br />
“When you put it like that, it does sound simple,” the muscular fox said. “But then you need to account for the fact that each one of them has a book or books. In their timelines, they’ve already beaten at least one or more of the other book users.” <br />
<br />
“What if we tried summoning something from the Book of Myth to help us?” suggested. <br />
<br />
“The only things that could do that are either divine or legendary beings, and both of those require a large amount of energy to summon. Trying to summon the latter risks you going into a coma, and even if you somehow manage to get the energy to summon either one, they’re nearly impossible to control.”<br />
<br />
“Then what if one of us turned into something from the Book of Myth?” Todd asked. <br />
<br />
“No, out of the question,” Xarxos responded quickly. “Those spells require a large amount of energy as well, and they’re fairly dangerous. I’d prefer if those spells either go completely unused or are only used as an absolute last resort. Do you both understand me?” <br />
<br />
“I understand,” Todd replied, climbing into the muscular fox’s lap and resting his head on his pecs. “I don’t want to make you worry about me.”<br />
<br />
“Well I can’t help but worry about you two sometimes,” the muscular fox replied, scratching behind Todd’s ears and kissing him on the cheek. “You two are my boyfriends after all. I want to make sure you stay safe.” Mark got up from his couch and moved over to sit next to Xarxos, stroking the heavily muscled fox’s large biceps. <br />
<br />
“Todd and I are so lucky to have such a big, strong, sexy fox to protect us,” the white-furred fox said, leaning in and giving Xarxos a passionate kiss. <br />
<br />
“And I’m lucky to have two adorable foxes to call my lovers,” the muscular fox replied, reaching down to stroke Mark’s emerging erection…<br />
<br />
“Ahem…”<br />
<br />
The sound of someone clearing their throat made the three foxes turn their heads toward the front of the plane. Standing near the entrance to the cockpit was a tall, anthro-eagle wearing a pilot’s uniform and aviator shades. <br />
<br />
“Oh! Sorry about that Ace!” Xarxos said, gently lifting Todd off his lap before getting up to approach the eagle. “I guess we got a little carried away there…”<br />
<br />
“You&#39;re fine, boss,” the eagle replied. “I just wanted to make sure things didn’t escalate too far before we even took off. Besides, the back of the jet was fitted with a large bed for a reason.” <br />
<br />
“Oh…right…” Xarxos chuckled nervously and scratched the back of his head in embarrassment. “Wouldn’t want to make a mess of your pride and joy.” The muscular fox then turned around to face his boyfriends. <br />
<br />
“Todd…Mark…this is Ace,” he said. “He’s going to be our pilot.”<br />
<br />
“It’s a pleasure to meet you both,” the eagle said, waving to the other two foxes. “I promise I’ll get you to Vegas safely and sound within a few hours.”<br />
<br />
“Well if Xarxos trusts you, then I trust you as well,” Todd said, smiling at Ace. “When will we be departing?”<br />
<br />
“In just a few minutes,” Ace replied. “The jet is in tip-top shape and ready to fly. I ask that you all fasten your seatbelts until we’re airborne.” <br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-==-<br />
 <br />
The jet took off smoothly, and before the trio knew it, they were able to unbuckle their seatbelts and walk around the cabin. Xarxos went to the back to nap in bed, and Mark had turned on the TV to watch a movie. Todd, meanwhile, wasn’t entirely sure what to do. He had started watching the movie with Mark, but after a while, he started to lose interest. <br />
 <br />
Todd got off the couch and stretched before looking towards the back of the plane. “Might as well go check on Xarxos and make sure he’s doing okay…” he said, looking over at Mark. <br />
 <br />
“Okay, I’ll be here,” Mark replied. The white-furred fox stretched a bit on the couch before turning his attention back to the movie. <br />
 <br />
Todd walked through the curtains in the back of the plane to reveal a small corridor with a bathroom, a storage closet, and the door to the bedroom. The fox quietly opened the door to see a small room with a reinforced bed for the three of them to sleep on and a large TV mounted on the wall. Xarxos was sleeping on his back on top of the covers, snoring slightly. Smiling softly, Todd turned and got ready to go back to watching the movie. <br />
 <br />
“Mmmm…Todd…”<br />
 <br />
The fox twunk turned around upon hearing his name. Was Xarxos awake? He looked over at the muscular fox, only to find that he was still fast asleep. <br />
 <br />
“You have…such a cake Todd…” Todd’s eyes widened and he tried to stifle a laugh as he realized what was going on. <br />
 <br />
Xarxos was talking in his sleep. <br />
 <br />
“Mmm…wanna eat that ass…dirty fox slut…” It was then that Todd noticed the muscular fox’s growing erection. He watched as Xarxos’ massive foot-long cock slowly emerged from its sheath, dripping with pre. The twunk couldn’t help but lick his chops upon seeing the wonderful piece of meat before him. Surely a little taste wouldn’t hurt anyone…<br />
 <br />
Todd carefully got into the bed with Xarxos and climbed on top of the larger fox, looking at the large cock hungrily. The small fox leaned down and took the massive slab of meat in his mouth. Immediately, Xarxos let out a soft moan in his sleep, and a bit more pre shot out of his cock. The small fox savored the salty taste before beginning to slowly bob his head up and down the length, making sure to drag his tongue along the shaft. <br />
 <br />
The smaller fox was so engrossed in his work that he didn’t hear the door slowly sliding open and someone entering. It wasn’t until he felt a pair of hands grab his ass and a tongue begin to rim his hole that Todd realized someone else had entered the room. He didn’t have to be a psychic to know who it was though. <br />
 <br />
The tongue stopped rimming Todd’s hole for a second. “I’m a bit hurt that you were in here having some fun without me,” Mark said, giving the smaller fox’s ass a firm squeeze. “So why don’t we change that?” <br />
 <br />
Before Todd could say anything, he felt the weight of the bed shift as Mark climbed on. The white fox put his hands on Todd’s ass and spread his cheeks apart, gently prodding the tip of his cock against the smaller fox’s hole. The twunk moaned as his hole was teased, pushing back against the other fox’s cock to entice Mark into entering him. <br />
 <br />
“You want me to put my cock inside of you?” the larger fox asked coyly. Todd nodded his head, continuing to suck Xarxos’s thick cock. Mark smirked before beginning to push his length into Todd’s hole, causing the smaller fox to let out a muffled moan. <br />
 <br />
Xarxos let out another moan before slowly opening his eyes. The muscular fox was a bit confused as to what was going on at first, but his questions were answered upon seeing Todd’s head bobbing up and down in the corner of his eye. <br />
 <br />
“Well this is a rather nice way to wake up,” the muscular fox said, getting both Mark and Todd’s attention. He put a large hand on the back of the smaller fox’s head, making sure that his dick wouldn’t be leaving Todd’s muzzle any time soon. Of course, Todd didn’t seem to mind at all. The young fox bobbed his head lower on the larger fox’s member, taking more of it in his muzzle. Xarxos moaned in satisfaction, bucking his hips to get his cock even deeper into Todd’s maw. <br />
 <br />
Mark let out a grunt of pleasure as his thrusts began to pick up both speed and force. “Fuck, I want to knot this little slut so bad,” he moaned. “What do you say we knot him from both ends?” <br />
 <br />
“I like the way you think, hun,” Xarxos replied, a grin on his face. The muscular fox began to pick up the speed and force of his thrusts, his large knot hitting the tip of Todd’s muzzle each time. The small fox soon understood what he needed to do, and he opened his mouth a tiny bit. With that little extra space, Xarxos shoved his knot into Todd’s muzzle, letting out a gasp as his cock began to slide down the fox’s throat. Todd’s throat muscles began to reflexively gulp, squeezing the muscular fox’s cock as he tried to push it in deeper. <br />
 <br />
“Fuck that feels good!” Xarxos moaned, pushing Todd’s head down further. The small fox’s nose was pressed into Xarxos’ crotch, allowing him to smell the muscular fox’s musky crotch fur. The scent made his cock jump, dripping pre as if it were a faucet. This feeling was only made better when Mark forcefully shoved his knot deep into Todd’s ass, tying them together. Grabbing the smaller fox’s hips, the white-furred fox made short, fast thrusts against Todd’s g-spot, causing the younger fox’s body to shake with pleasure each time. <br />
 <br />
“Not much longer now…” Mark growled, his orgasm rapidly approaching. “You ready to flood this slut’s holes?”<br />
 <br />
“You better believe I am,” Xarxos replied, panting slightly. <br />
 <br />
The two larger foxes thrust as hard and fast as they could, the muffled moans of their smaller lover only making them go faster. Todd’s eyes rolled back, the pleasure becoming too much for his small body to handle. Then, without warning, his mouth and ass were both flooded with hot vulpine seed. The smaller fox moaned as he swallowed rope after rope after rope of cum from Xarxos’ cock while his ass was filled to the brim by Mark. The pleasure became so great that he came all over the bed sheets beneath him. <br />
 <br />
Their orgasms seemed to go on for an eternity, but they eventually died down. When he was finally able to, Xarxos pulled his cock out of Todd’s mouth. <br />
 <br />
“You like that, you little slut?” He asked, putting a hand under Todd’s chin and lifting it. The smaller fox simply let out a shaky moan, completely overwhelmed by the pleasure he’d experienced. <br />
 <br />
“I’d say we did a good job,” Mark said with a grin. Just then, the speaker system in the plane came to life, and the three of them could hear Ace’s voice. <br />
 <br />
“Alright, the Las Vegas Airport is in sight,” he said. “We’re going to begin our descent now. If you aren’t already, please sit down and stay seated until the plane has come to a complete stop.” <br />
 <br />
-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-==-<br />
 <br />
By the time the plane landed, Mark’s knot had “deflated” enough that he could pull it out of Todd’s ass. Once they’d gathered the things they’d need while at the casino, the trio thanked Ace for the safe flight. Upon getting off the plane, they found a car waiting for them to take them to the casino. <br />
 <br />
“Booked the car in advance,” Xarxos explained to Todd and Mark. “Time doesn’t expect us, or else he’d have sent an invitation.” The three of them got into the car, and Xarxos instructed the driver to take them to the Mag Mell Casino. <br />
 <br />
Upon arriving, the driver pulled under the porte cochere. As the trio got out of the car, Xarxos gave the driver a tip before standing in front of the casino doors with Todd and Mark.<br />
 <br />
“Okay, it’s very important that you two listen very carefully to what I’m about to say,” the muscular fox said, looking at the other two foxes. “Upon entering this casino, you have three chips: a Body Chip, a Mind Chip, and a Soul Chip. They look like regular poker chips, but they essentially contain your body, mind, and soul respectively. If you lose even one of them, the casino owns you. Lose all three, and you belong to either the owner of the casino or another player, depending on who you gambled and lost to.”<br />
 <br />
“So then…what do we do?” Todd asked nervously. <br />
 <br />
“Well, in an ideal scenario, I would tell you not to gamble at all, but to get to Time and challenge him for his books, we need to gamble our way to the top. We’ll eventually come up with a better plan, but until then, don’t gamble or take any kind of deals from anyone. Am I clear?”<br />
 <br />
“Crystal,” Mark said. <br />
 <br />
“Alright then, let’s head inside.” The trio walked towards the front door, and Xarxos pushed them open, revealing a site that made Todd and Mark’s eyes go wide in amazement. <br />
 <br />
The inside of the casino was <i>much</i> larger on the inside than it was on the outside. Behind the lavish-looking reception desk at the front was a large, ornate fountain with gold statues. A pair of large staircases curved around the fountain, leading to an upper level where most of the action seemed to be happening. From the entrance alone, the three of them could look up and see balconies in certain suites that looked out over the casino. <br />
 <br />
“Holy shit…” Todd said in amazement. “This place is…” <br />
 <br />
“A fucking trap, that’s what it is,” Xarxos said, cutting the smaller fox off. “This is what Dolan wants. He wants you to get distracted and gamble away either your books or your chips. Resist the temptation to gamble. Now come on, let’s get checked in.” <br />
 <br />
The three foxes approached the reception desk. Behind it, a lamia was typing something on a computer. When she saw the three vulpines approaching, she stopped whatever she had been doing to greet them. <br />
 <br />
“Welcome to the Mag Mell Casino!” she said, smiling. “How can I help the three of you today?” <br />
 <br />
“Hi, I’m Todd,” Todd said. “I’m the owner of the Book of Transfiguration.” <br />
 <br />
The receptionist looked up at a window near the top of the casino. Todd followed her gaze and caught a brief glimpse of a man quickly moving away. Could that have been…?<br />
 <br />
“Uh, .02% deviation from Prime, sir.” Todd looked back and saw that the lamia was now talking on the phone with someone. He had a fairly good idea of who it was, though.<br />
 <br />
“Sir?” The lamia had a slightly confused look on her face for a second before she hung up the phone. <br />
 <br />
“Well, it appears the boss has taken a very special interest in you, Mr. Todd,” the lamia said. “I’ve been instructed to give you VIP accommodations and send you to see him. Here are your room keys.” The snake woman handed them three keycards. <br />
 <br />
“Head up the stairs to your right and enter the elevator,” she instructed. “Swipe one of your cards in the card reader located inside, and you’ll be taken to the VIP suite. The boss expects to see you soon, however, so don’t keep him waiting too long.” <br />
 <br />
“Uh…thanks!” Todd said, giving the lamia a smile before moving away from the desk. The trio walked up the stairs and found the elevator rather easily. Once inside, Todd swiped his keycard, and the elevator doors shut before it began to rise. <br />
 <br />
“There’s no way we’re actually about to meet Dolan,” Xarxos said, shaking his head in disbelief. <br />
 <br />
“Well, I think you better start believing, because that’s exactly what’s happening,” Mark replied. <br />
 <br />
“I only hope that I’m ready to fight him…” Todd said quietly. What happened next would either go really, really well or really, really bad.</p>
