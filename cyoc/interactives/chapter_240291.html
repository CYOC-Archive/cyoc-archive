<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tracey fed and changed Crystal and put her down in the playpen with Janet, Fred, and Tommy in the living room. Around lunch time April, Tracey&#39;s sister, arrived at the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;So sis, did you think about my offer?&quot;, asked April.<br />
<br />
&quot;Offer?&quot;, asked Tracey as she put a small sandwich in front of her older sister.<br />
<br />
&quot;For me to move in and help you with the quad. I know you&#39;re getting child support from the bastard who knocked you up, but you&#39;ve got to be running yourself ragged&quot;, said April with some concern.<br />
<br />
Tracey rapt her fingers a quick second before an odd idea popped into her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;April can you watch the quad for me? I need to go use the bathroom&quot;, said Tracey.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing. You&#39;re so lucky to have babies. I wish I had some.&quot;, said April sadly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll find someone special April, don&#39;t worry&quot;, smiled Tracey while heading up the stairs.<br />
<br />
Tracey headed to the nursery where the computer was. She booted up the computer and started the program. She saw herself, April, Crystal, Janet, Fred, and Tommy all on the screen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now what to do? I could be the older sister or should I bring back Tom?&quot;, Tracey asked herself. While Tracey was staring at the computer screen and her belly, an idea popped into her head. If April really wanted to move in and help with the babies, perhaps she could fill the void in the family she&#39;d created.<br />
<br />
Tracey selected April&#39;s character and looked through all the settings beyond age that were available to alter. There was a new setting Tracey noticed labelled &quot;Familial Relations&quot; which when clicked on listed April&#39;s relationship to Tracey (user): Full Sister to user. The relationship was part of a drop down menu which listed several different options, many of which were variations of sister: Half Sister, Step Sister, Adoptive Sister, etc. Eventually she scrolled down to find the relationship she wanted to select for this first part of her twisted plan: &quot;Unrelated&quot;.<br />
<br />
After selecting Unrelated a pop-up appeared on the screen, asking her if she really wanted to make April unrelated to her, to which Tracey took a moment&#39;s pause before selecting Yes. Safe in the knowledge that her awareness was on and she could always change everything back later. <br />
<br />
Tracey felt a shiver run down her spine but otherwise nothing else seemed different. She poked her head downstairs to see April still playing with the babies, but now in a slightly more awkward manner not of a relative, but a good friend holding their friend&#39;s kids.<br />
<br />
Knowing that this was just the first part of the plan, Tracey switched back to the main profile for April and knew that transforming her into her babies&#39; father would require a few other shifts. First she picked an age. She watched as April&#39;s character started to regress in age.<br />
<br />
Downstairs the former 28 year old was slowly growing younger as she bounced Tommy. Not much changed in her appearance as she grew younger by seven years beyond a few fine worry and laugh lines disappearing--smoothing away as if they&#39;d never been there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tracey is so cool to be a mother already.&quot;, said April as she rocked Tommy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now onto the next part of my plan&quot;, said Tracey as she selected April&#39;s gender and switched it from Female to Male.<br />
<br />
Tracey watched the screen as April shifted and started to grow from her feet up. First her feet outgrew the low-heels she&#39;d been wearing as her feet grew in size and became big and hairy. The destroyed heels then shifting into socks and sneakers. Next her legs burst out of the stockings and skirt she&#39;d worn as her legs grew longer and thicker with muscle, and regrew their hair before disappearing beneath a pair of grey sweatpants that hid the transformation her panties took changing into boxers and readying for her clitoris to engorge itself into a rather decent sized rod, soon accompanied by her labia growing loose, sealing back up and her ovaries descending down into the sac her former formed to become her new testes. Her butt and hips shrank in width, but plumped up with muscle. From the waist down, and in the most important place that counted, April had become a man, but that change did not stay confined to below as his torso stretched up a few inches adding to his height and his shoulders stretched wider in response. His breasts shrank into his widening chest--all of which destroyed the blouse and jacket that April had come in with, exposing his well-muscled abs and pecs before the items shifted transforming into a white t-shirt with a gray zipper hoodie left open. His arms grew longer and like his legs before him thicker with muscle and hair--filling out the sleeves of the hoodie. Fingers grew bigger along with his hands and well manicured and polished nails were replaced with the rough hands of a man. His neck thickened to match the build of the man he was becoming, and then all that remained to change was April&#39;s head as his long black hair pulled into his head until it was as a little longer than a buzz cut. His chin altered slightly, eyebrows grew thicker as well, and all signs of make up disappeared. The last thing to change was April&#39;s name, which now read: Arlen Smith.<br />
<br />
Tracey rather liked the looks of Arlen and switched back to the familial relationship part of the profile and made the change from &quot;Unrelated&quot; to &quot;Husband/Spouse, Father to Children&quot;.<br />
<br />
The way Arlen held baby Tommy changed from that of an awkward grip to that of a proud father, happily holding his son. All the photos in the house shifted to show Arlen and Tracey as the parents and happy couple. Tracey thought a moment then before selecting the babies in the living room and selecting a new age for them. They all grew younger until pop they disappeared from the living room and Arlen&#39;s arms as Tracey&#39;s belly grew large with the quadruplets of two boys and two girls, which then began to shrink back in months until she didn&#39;t look pregnant at all and another shiver ran down her spine and from what she could hear elsewhere in the house, Arlen had felt it too.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey babe, I&#39;m horny,&quot; called out Tracey as she made her way to the bed and readied herself to reconceive her quadruplets as she heard Arlen rush up the stairs and burst into the room, already trying to strip as he ran in.</p>
