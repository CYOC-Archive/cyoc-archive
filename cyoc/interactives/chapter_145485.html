<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Marcus finally decided that enough was enough. He wasn’t going to let Jeanie keep on changing him. While she chanted her spell, Marcus got up and grabbed her. “Hey!! Fool! What are you doing?! You’ll ruin the spell if… you… do…” It was too late. A suddenly blast of magic emanating from Jeanie knocked Marcus back onto his big butt. <br />
<br />
He felt dizzy and a bit confused, like he didn’t know where he was anymore. But he did know, he was at his camp. He and the principle had gone off to have sex in the woods. He shakily stood up. Everything felt the same, and for a moment, Marcus thought Jeanie’s spell didn’t work, until he looked up. <br />
<br />
Standing in front of him, where Jeanie had been, was another huge, hairy man. The man was a massive, lumbering mix of muscle and fat, with a big butt, and thick thighs and arms. He had nice, big, hairy feet and a gigantic pair of moobs. All covered in lots of thick fuzz. He also had a beard, and unkempt, curly hair. And, as with all men in this world, was diapered, though his was a big, poofy, purple and green colored one with genie lamp pictures on it. The man grunted and farted as he looked around.<br />
<br />
The man was standing where Jeanie had been, and it took Marcus a few moments to realize that this man WAS Jeanie. But what happened to her?<br />
<br />
The man groaned for a bit, before speaking “Huh? Whuh happun…? M-Me….Me feel… good…” He grinned stupidly, a trail of drool leaking out of his mouth and onto his beard as he rubbed the front of his diaper. Marcus stared, confused, “Jeanie? Is that you?” The man just stared blankly, “J-Jean…ie? W-Who dat? I dunno…Who me?” <br />
<br />
Marcus’ eyes widened in surprise. “So, you don’t remember anything?” The man just shook his head and looked down at his big belly, which he shook a bit and giggled. Suddenly, they were interrupted by the principle, who had gotten up and come over. At some point time must’ve unfrozen. “Hey! Boy! What are you doing over here?”<br />
<br />
Marcus stammered, “Nothing sir, just…” A thought raced through his head and he grinned, “Just talking to my friend, uh, Gene here.” The man, or “Gene” looked at him, “Me…Me Gene?” Marcus nodded at him. “Yeah, he is new, but between you and me, he’s even dumber than I am!” Marcus chuckled. Gene looked, and acted, like it. Marcus didn’t even know what 5 x 5 was because he couldn’t count that high.<br />
<br />
“Hah! Let’s see! Boy, what’s 2 + 2?” He asked Gene, who looked at him dumbly, his mind struggling to understand the question. “D’uhhh… One, two, t-three…” He scratched his head as he attempted to count on his fingers. Marcus and the principle laughed. “It’s okay boy, you really don’t need to know. All we boys need to know is how to get stronger.” Gene grinned and nodded. Marcus guessed Gene didn’t know anything. <br />
<br />
“Alright boys, I think we should head back soon. You’re lucky you came Gene, we were down a camper.” The principle sniffed the air and chuckled, “But first it smells like someone needs a diaper change.” Marcus patted his own butt before realizing he wasn’t wearing a diaper, before looking at Gene, who blushed and crossed his legs sheepishly. The principle smiled as he went over, laid Gene on the ground, and undid his diaper. “Boy, you sure are a stinker! But don’t worry, your friend Marcus is one too!” Marcus blushed “I-I don’t smell that bad!” He yelled. The principle just laughed as he changed Gene’s diaper “You know I’m just teasing.” <br />
<br />
While he changed Gene’s diaper, they both got a good shot of Gene massive erection, almost as big as Marcus’ was, but definitely thicker. “Oho! Seems like some little boy is excited!” The Principle grinned while Gene giggled and clapped his hand. A perverted look crossed the principle’s face. “Alright Marcus, want to “play” with Gene like we did earlier?” Marcus was a bit shocked, but somehow, he felt less gross about doing it now. In fact, he actually felt pretty good about doing it now. He nodded excitedly. <br />
<br />
As the principle got Gene onto all fours, his dick was leaking pre, which he used to lubricate his dick with. Eyeing Gene’s hairy butt, the principle inserted his sausage between Gene’s buns, causing him to moan in pleasure. Marcus instinctively got in front of Gene’s face, and placed his own throbbing erection into Gene’s mouth. “Go ahead boy! He seems hungry.” Gene looked at him expectedly while Marcus slid his dick inside and down Gene’s throat. It just came so naturally for him.<br />
<br />
The principle pounded Gene’s ass while Marcus fucked his mouth, Gene greedily sucking on Marcus’ cock. It was amazing, Marcus had never felt like this before. The two of them were spitroasting Gene. And, although he felt a little jealous that it wasn’t HIS ass taking the principle’s cock, he didn’t mind as just seeing the man across from him filled him with intense feeling of passion.  <br />
<br />
The principle pounded hard against Gene’s thick butt while Marcus did the same up front. The lovers built up a steady rhythm, as Gene became their dumb, horny toy. They fucked him passionately. Gene was also enjoying it, and moaned around Marcus’ cock. Finally, as the buildup of pleasure became too great for the men, the principle yelled, “Fuck!!! I can’t contain it!” And pulled Marcus in for a deep kiss as they simultaneously came inside Gene, filling him up with their seed.<br />
<br />
After they had orgasmed, they took their dicks out of Gene, who happily lay on the ground rubbing his cock. Marcus and the principle cuddled up as they watched him, kissing and jacking each other off. Marcus knew he should’ve been disgusted by all this, but for some reason didn’t. He was in heaven. <br />
<br />
After a while sitting like this, the principle finally stood up. “Alright, that was fun, but we really should be heading back to camp.” Marcus pouted but the principle just grinned, “Don’t give me that look. Tonight is bean night. I know how you love it.” Marcus reluctantly agreed and stood up. Even though he wanted to keep cuddling with the principle, he was pretty hungry, and he did like beans. “Alright, fine, but what about our diaper?” Marcus asked. “What about them?” The principle replied.<br />
<br />
“We are all three men in the woods. We can do as we please. In my day, we used to be naked around the camp all the time.” He proudly stood up, showing off his giant erection. ”Besides, the other campers should already be in bed, and there are more diapers back at the camp.” Marcus felt like he should’ve been ashamed at walking back to camp naked, but had to agree with the principle. There was just something about men, so strong and powerful. He finally felt proud of his big, brutish body. <br />
<br />
“Alright boys, let’s go.” The principle said as he started walking back. Marcus pulled Gene up, “C’mon Gene, tonight’s bean night! We don’t want to miss that.” Marcus lifted his leg and let out a big fart, making Gene laugh, “Okay! Okay!” Marcus ran after the principle, with Gene following lazily behind.</p>
