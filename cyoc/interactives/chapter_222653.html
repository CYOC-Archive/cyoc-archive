<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The large stone doors slid apart at Antonio&#39;s command, disappearing into the midnight black walls of the keep, the statues eyes now illuminated with ghostly light, like spotlights as Antonio led the way to the new heart of his territory. Stepping into a large rectangular room Antonio gazed around in pride at his creation, the walls of either doorway on both sides angled towards the ceiling, before angling back towards the wall near the top, a pulsing flame glow connecting the angled black wall with the ceiling, crystal like stone pillars lining both walls, creating an archway over both doors, the walls lined with ridges as if the walls were ribs, small sharp spines protruding from the ridges erratically, then Antonio the left, the way to the throne room, along the wall was a raised platform, large stairs on either side in semicircle shapes, the center of the platform coming forward in a half circle, a large rectangular door behind it, it&#39;s frame touching the ceiling, the walls within the door constructed of thousands of individual bones.<br />
Either side of the door were lined with what looked like large stain glass windows, the hazardous black frames connected by the same pulsing glowing membrane in the large window in the front, however these windows all seemed to have the extremely long appearance of a eye in the center, the pupils stretched from top to bottom, unblinking and unmoving, the sound of a beating heart reverberating around them as they walked into the throne room.<br />
<br />
Antonio marched towards the throne before him, steps leading towards the large black throne, a ring of black obsidian floating above, jagged spikes erupting from the top in various heights, almost like a crown, drapes of a strange woven fabric hanging down on either side of the throne, the large window and beating sun at its back, large pillars lining the road to his throne, with a balcony and stairs leading to the rest of the keep in it&#39;s gaze, the walls lined with similar windows to the ones in the entrance, spaced between each pillar, spider webbing arches connecting the pillars to the ceiling as it angled towards a narrow flat top high above.<br />
<br />
Antonio had finally reached the throne, wordlessly staring at it, his hand stroking along the chairs cold arm, Lilith then waddled up behind him &quot; kitty, this is yours, you&#39;ve earned this, you built this, take the throne and lead us, make us strong&quot; she whispered before kissing his cheek, this stunned Antonio, her lips were so soft and delicate, he instinctively brought his clawed hand to his cheek, as if trying to feel her lips on his feline face, he turned to look at her with a warm smile before holding her face in his hands and brought her to his muzzle, kissing her deeply, pressing her heavy brood filled pregnant form to his body, the moans she let escape her occupied lips were music to Antonio&#39;s ears, then he released her from his loving embrace, looking into her lust filled eyes before giving her a nod, letting out a breath like sigh she waddled down to join the others as Antonio took his place upon the black throne, his sword in both hands with its tip slotted into a slit on the floor, it&#39;s ghostly flames building with each pulse if the solar heart above.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ladies, my subjects, your lord and master now sits before you, this empire will start with the Hellmouth, sinking deep into the earth of this realm, until the depths of the darkness in the pit are so strong it swallows up the twisted crown and any who oppose us!&quot; He declared, watching as Lilith Heleli and Helen looked at him in awe before bowing their heads before him. &quot;But first, to ensure our raign is everlasting, the roots of our bloodline must be strong, our subjects even stronger, so I shall take from the pit, i shall take from the world itself, and give to each of you in turn&quot; he spoke, his gaze falling on Lilith with a warm smile &quot; my demon hunter, step forward&quot;<br />
Lilith smiled and waddled to stand in front of Antonio&#39;s throne<br />
&quot;You carry my brood, but your body struggles without my aid, therefore i shall reshape you in the image of the Hellmouth, reborn into a new species, into, THE BROOD QUEEN&quot; He roared as all the built up energy in his sword cascaded like a waterfall of fire, encircling Lilith as Antonio set to work.<br />
<br />
SKILL: Chronivac ACTIVE<br />
INFLUENCE: The Hellmouth blade: evolve target into new species: brood queen<br />
<br />
Lilith&#39;s eyes whent wide as she doubled over, her mouth open in a wordless scream as her skin and form began to bulge and shift, as if something was underneath trying to break free, her pregnant swell alive with movement, making her belly jolt and shake, the flames surrounding her attacked her skin, strange runes and symbols appearing in their ghostly light wherever the flames touched her, her clothing burning away to a pile of ash as she was lifted into the air &quot;be reborn anew, be reborn as the strong, awaken my queen, JOIN THE HELLMOUTH!&quot; Antonio roared, Lilith&#39;s scream of agony releasing at the same time before her body erupted into a shower of crimson red.<br />
<br />
What lay suspended in the air was something unlike any of them had seen before, floating where Lilith once was, now lay a powerful new being, some of Lilith&#39;s features remained, however the rest was new, almost alien.<br />
Lilith&#39;s lips and chin remained it&#39;s purple toned normality, however the upper half of her face was completely changed, almost as if her horns had overgrown over her face, the top half of her head and eyes were now covered in a obsidian black and shiny bone like plating, the crevices between the two plates connected by green fire, two solid green glowing eyes could be seen inside two eye holes in her new natural armor, and a third in a large diamond shaped opening in the center of her head, revealing more of her natural skin underneath, the third eye no bigger than the other two, her horns had stretched outwards, now making her head appear as a large T shape, each horn ending in a flat straight end, her pointed ears emerging from underneath her large new horns, retaining their original shape, then hanging from the bottom of both horns was a material similar to that of the drapes above the throne, resembling that of a spiders web, yet woven and uniform like fabric.<br />
<br />
Her feminine neck lead down to her new armored collar bone and shoulders, the crystal like stone making the necessary cracks and indents to make movement as fluid as possible for her, each space filled with her green flames, a long piece of the black bone like armor traveled between her new breasts, hanging naked and open for all to admire, their purple roundness having grown to at least the size of prize winning watermelons, yet remaining perky and firm, looking soft to the touch, her nipples almost black, a creamy white liquid visible escaping from her Mellon tits tips, her arms remained the same if only a bit longer, but then there was her most prominent feature, as if it was leading her way, her midriff and thighs were dominated by a gargantuan pregnant belly, her purple skin as tight as a drum as it struggled to contain her brood, the sides of her orb of life lined with horizontal layered plates of black crystal like stone, stopping as they approached her belly&#39;s front and top, ,her hips wide enough to be seen from behind her brood as the crystal like growths clung to the sides of her hip and upper thigh, creating a flat rim around the top, lined with various sized spines, each connected by bowing threads of stone, her legs and feet seemed to stay the same as well, her pussy obscured from view however the hot, sweet dripping nectar from her lips easily seen dripping down her inner legs, it was then that she spread her now much larger wings, beating them twice before she came to the floor, folding them behind her back, looking up at Antonio, her hight now looking to be at least seven foot, before she took in a deep breath at the sight of her new form.<br />
<br />
She chuckled and grinned as she began caressing her drum tight womb &quot;well shit, this is certainly not what I expected, but I have to admit this form has its perks&quot; she lustily growled, her voice echoing as if there were three of her talking at once, lifting her milky tit in her palm before letting it slap against her belly, cooing in excitement at the feeling before letting out a full moan as she took a handful of her new wide ass.<br />
&quot;My king&quot; Lilith purred &quot;surely you intend to include the others in this glorious transition, unless you want to keep giving me special treatment&quot; giving Antonio a wink as she began waddling up to his throne as the platform extended on both sides, a throne fit for someone in Liliths condition to his left, which the Brood queen happily took, taking her place next to her king.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now then, who will be next to evolve, and become a species of the Hellmouth with us&quot; Antonio chuckled, rising from his throne and placing his sword into the slot at his feet, the walls and floor once again coming alive as ghostly blue energy was drawn towards the sword from all directions, igniting the blade in a cold inferno before he pointed the black blade at...</p>
