<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When she didn&#39;t give a response started to come into the bathroom. That was enough to galvanize her into action. She hurried back into the shower stall and pulled the curtain across the door, terrified of what he would say if he saw her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, go away,&quot; she fought back tears.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Jack stepped farther into the room, closing the door behind him, &quot;Could you not get it all off or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No...I...&quot; she was trapped. What was she supposed to do? She couldn&#39;t leave the bathroom covered in hair the way she was.<br />
<br />
&quot;How much is left?&quot; Jack continued, stopping a few feet from the shower stall.<br />
<br />
There was no choice, she had to tell him the truth, &quot;All of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
He inhaled sharply, &quot;What kind of glue do you think they used? You can stay in my room while I go out and buy some sort of solvent, or I can take you to the doctor. Then we&#39;re going to reoprt this to the housing director so they can find out who did it and deal with them before me and the guys on the team do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Despite herself Lisa smiled. That was how Jack was, and he did have a point. If it wasn&#39;t his roommate who&#39;d done it, and she was getting increasingly doubtful that it had been him, then it meant that someone had come into the room, something that had been a big problem last semester. Supposedly there were extra copies of some of the room keys that had gone missing a year ago and maintenance hadn&#39;t gotten around to changing all the locks yet.<br />
<br />
Her smile fell as she considered what she was about to say, &quot;It&#39;s all still there and I don&#39;t think solvent or a doctor is going to do any good,&quot; she pulled the shower curtain aside slightly, just enough to look out at him, &quot;It&#39;s not glue.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what is it?&quot; Jack took a step forward and she forced herself not to retreat back into the shower.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s,&quot; she took a deep breath, &quot;It&#39;s like it&#39;s grown on it&#39;s own.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But that&#39;s impossible,&quot; Jack continued towards her, &quot;Hair doesn&#39;t grow like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; she held out her arm for him to look for himself, &quot;What am I going to do?&quot;<br />
<br />
Without hesitation he ran his hand up and down her arm, trying to rub the hairs off, staring in disbelief as they remained in place. He leaned in closer, feeling the thick strands between his fingers, carefully testing and finding that they were, as she had said attached. As Jack examined the hairs Lisa fought back a shudder of disgust. Not only was it terrible to look at, having his fingers brush against the hairs on her arms felt strangely disconcerting.<br />
<br />
When he finished his examination Jack frowned, &quot;I&#39;ve got a spare razor you can borrow. Shaving it off will help at least and maybe it&#39;s just a one off thing. You can shave it away and it probably won&#39;t grow back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How can you take this so well?&quot; she was shocked, &quot;I mean it&#39;s terrible!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jack shrugged, &quot;It&#39;s just hair. Besides, you know Mike?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think,&quot; Lisa wasn&#39;t sure where the conversation was going, but she was pretty sure that Mike was one of the guys on the football team.<br />
<br />
&quot;The guy shaves his whole body at least once a week during the season, claims it makes him sweat less during games. You haven&#39;t seen body hair until you&#39;ve seen Mike. The first time I walked in on him shaving his legs it was like seeing a gorilla,&quot; Jack laughed, &quot;He was standing one leg up on the sink, a whole pack of disposable razors next to him, towel on the floor. It was crazy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa had no clue what to say to that. She could imagine it easily enough though, thanks to some of the things she&#39;d run into in the girls&#39; bathrooms. Like how last semester she&#39;d walked in on two of the girls on the cheerleading squad sharing a shower stall and washing each other with the door open. They&#39;d yelled at her to get out, like she was the one doing something inappropriate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; she said at last.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t mention it,&quot; Jack shook his head, &quot;Unlike Mike you should only need one razor. For his first shave of the season the guy would go through a whole back of them to get himself totally hairless.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jack left and a few minutes later returned with the razor. She thanked him and then began the long, arduous task of shaving.<br />
<br />
She started with her face, doing the best she could to get every last trace of the beard and sideburns gone. Her eyebrows were horrible, but they were going to have to wait until she got back ot her room so she could get tweezers to pluck and shape them properly. Next she took care of her legs, which was easy despite the amount of hair since she did them every few days and was used to it. Her arms took a bit more effort and a lot of twisting and turning to be sure that everything was gone. Again she was going to need tweezers to deal with the hairs on the backs of her fingers, but they weren&#39;t so bad.<br />
<br />
As for the rest of her body...she looked at the dark hairs covering the sink and clinging to the disposable razor, as much as she wanted to take care of it right away, she was going to have to wait. She&#39;d already spent long enough hiding in the guy&#39;s bathroom and she&#39;d die of embarrassment if someone were to walk in on her.<br />
<br />
At least Jack was able to handle the situation. She wasn&#39;t sure what would have happened if he hadn&#39;t thought quickly and been so willing to help.<br />
<br />
The hair that was left would be covered by her clothing once she got dressed and then the two of them cold figureo ut what to do next.</p>
