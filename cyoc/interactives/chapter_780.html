<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">An older gentleman, a little over 40 perhaps, stepped up to the stage. Stephan could now see 
<br>
 he had peppered hair, and despite his flabbiness, was actually quite thin, given his age. The 
<br>
 man came up and stood up with Randy. He had no beard, and was smooth skinned. He 
<br>
 actually looked like a typical high school teacher. And indeed that was what he was, if 
<br>
 Stephan's telepathy was accurate. The man, although not unhandsome, was balding, and 
<br>
 stood a good deal shorter than Randy, who practically towered a good number of inches 
<br>
 above him; Owen came up to his shoulders, barely. He had lighter, firm at the sides, graying 
<br>
 hair. He looked like he enjoyed humor, and knew how to go with the flow of a joke. Although 
<br>
 what he was about to witness was anything but a joke...He wore a plaid shirt, slacks. He was 
<br>
 opposite in many ways from the flashy Randy. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;And you sir...can you tell us your name.&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Owen.&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Well, Owen,&quot; said Stephan, &quot;Would you like to tell me a little bit about yourself...&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Well...I'm a teacher at the local high school...I've taught for several years...&quot; Owen talked a 
<br>
 little more about his life, as the audience looked on, curious as to what was turn this new 
<br>
 trick was going to take. Owen had wrinkles at the side of his eyes, that were not unattractive, 
<br>
 thought Stephan. The older man was a perfect candidate. Neither too ugly nor too good. He 
<br>
 was rather weak, physically speaking. 
<br>

<br>
 Stephan thanked Owen for introducing himself and turned back to the audience. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Here, we have two grown men...opposite in many ways...the mysteries of the soul are 
<br>
 nothing new to the Madame Illusia, and she is very good at recognizing the secret desires 
<br>
 among men. Who among you has never considered the delicious possibility of transforming 
<br>
 your own body?? For the Madame, for whom many things are possible, this wish is 
<br>
 something which she can certainly intercede...&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 Randy looked on with a bemused and somewhat condescending look, summing up the uglier, 
<br>
 older looking haggard men in the room. Now, Stephan removed the cage from the stage...and 
<br>
 walked back from it. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;If the gentlemen will be so kind as to approach the front of the stage...&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 Randy and Owen walked over and stood side by side. Randy on the right, Owen on the left. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Now...&quot; began Stephan...&quot;to ensure that you won't recklessly try and run out mid-act...&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 A murmur of laughter arose from the audience. Surely just a scare tactic. Stephan's words 
<br>
 though, were not meant in humor. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;A spell of securement...&quot; said Stephan. The Madame Illusia spilled sand in a wide circle 
<br>
 around the two participants. She warbled in her mysterious language, her eyes dark and 
<br>
 appraising the two men. Randy for once looked like he didn't know what was going on, and 
<br>
 Owen arched his eyebrows. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;And now...&quot; said Stephan. &quot;We will perform a trick you shall see in no other part of the world, 
<br>
 and on no widely seen of your popular mediums...the Madame Illusia shall now turn your 
<br>
 bodies into a shape of her choice...&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 The woman walked over to the right of both men, and began to wave her arms in fluctuations, 
<br>
 reciting verse after ancient verse. Randy and Owen both in deep curiosity now. 
<br>

<br>
 Suddenly something began to shake at the tent flaps...a wind started up and howling...the 
<br>
 audience aghast as something tugged at both men...making them reach for their stomachs, 
<br>
 as if something had just passed by them. Light from the lamps fell on them, illuminating their 
<br>
 faces and muscles very well. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Ow!&quot; said Owen, bracing his neck suddenly and stooping slightly. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Hey..what..lady.&quot; began Randy as he walked toward Illusia's direction. But Randy walked no 
<br>
 further than the sand barrier, as he smacked into it. &quot;What the! Hey! HEY!&quot; Randy knocked 
<br>
 against the invisible barrier. The wind knocked off Randy's hat and he didn't bother to pick it 
<br>
 up. 
<br>

<br>
 In the back, several men tried to get out of the tent. But the same sand had managed to 
<br>
 snake its way across the entire interior of the tent. No matter how hard some of them 
<br>
 immediately tried, they could not get their hands on the tent flaps and exit to run away. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;I think you will all find this an effective deterrant,&quot; said Stephan. Your attempts are futile, you 
<br>
 might as well just watch. And now we come to the catch of why you are all here...the 
<br>
 Madame Illusia prides herself on her ability to change men. It is an ancient talent, and she 
<br>
 sometimes does use her command of this rare and beautiful talent for her own financial 
<br>
 benefit. Of course to be convinced a demonstration is of course necessary...&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 As he spoke the Madame thrust forth her arms, and a light green glow shot out from her, 
<br>
 separating into two rotating light green spheres, that began to revolve around Randy and 
<br>
 Owen, like two small swirling parts of a celestial body. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Now...now just wait here,&quot; began Owen trying to instill reason &quot;but just what do you intend to 
<br>
 do to us?&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 Randy simply looked at Illusia as if she was an alien stepping out from the mother ship. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;What we intend? To make a slight...alteration&quot; said Stephan. &quot;Nothing that will harm you. 
<br>
 You need not worry about that... 
<br>

<br>
 The Madame Illusia waved her arms again. The audience, much in shock, and not about to 
<br>
 mess with a woman who was, however she was, that powerful, simply remained where they 
<br>
 were, apprehensively watching. 
<br>

<br>
 The green comets stopped rotating around the two men, and in an astonishing sight, plunged 
<br>
 right into each of them, respectively. Randy and Owen both glowed slightly green for a while...like aliens in some sort of clich&eacute; science fiction show. The green
<br>
 glow covered them. 
<br>
 Owen simply shook his head to Randy that he had no idea what was going to happen. 
<br>

<br>
 Then, the green glow subsided. The audience looked on. Owen felt another surge of pain, and 
<br>
 fell on his knees. The light played on his balding head. Randy simply started sweating 
<br>
 profusely. Before he looked up at the audience Randy could already tell something odd was 
<br>
 happening. The sand around them, for instance, was now glowing green. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Aaaaah.&quot; Randy felt some sort of clamminess all over his body. It was like his back and front 
<br>
 were both being covered in some sort of heavy metal coating. It felt so...so...heavy. Randy 
<br>
 soon fell to his knees as well. 
<br>

<br>
 Owen felt himself feeling itchy and light. His face felt like something was being poured on 
<br>
 it...like a thick cream...the kind he saw women use on their faces... His hair shone over his 
<br>
 bald head...strands now growing over where there once weren't any, and he noticed that as 
<br>
 he ran his hand across his head, looking back at his hand in astonishment. 
<br>

<br>
 Randy felt so overpowered. He felt like he was lifting more weights than he possibly could... 
<br>
 he wasn't this strong...he noticed his hands were shaking and his arms...his arms were 
<br>
 thinner than they used to be! And his arm hair was half as short as it used to be! What the 
<br>
 hell???! 
<br>

<br>
 Owen grunted a few times. He was now sweating too, and someone suggested he take off his 
<br>
 shirt.. He did so, and noticed right away the change. He was now growing dark chest hair. 
<br>
 The little chest hair he did have was gray, not like the kind that crowded the bottom of 
<br>
 Randy's pecs...wait! Randy's pecs were smaller than before! Randy, moaning, now looked 
<br>
 like he once did several years before...thinner, less of the buff stud that he was...well, Owen 
<br>
 couldn't say now! Owen felt his own chest. There was a fullness there that wasn't there 
<br>
 before. His skin and entire body glowed green as did Randy's. Now, as the green subsided, 
<br>
 Owen noticed that his belt was tightening. 
<br>

<br>
 Randy was miserable. He looked up from where he was, still unable to stand up. He felt a 
<br>
 piece of his hair, and horrified, it fell off his head in a slick clump. Panicked, he looked to the 
<br>
 audience. There was nothing they could do. 
<br>

<br>
 Owen felt now better, although his heart was pounding and hair now crowded up half-way 
<br>
 across his head. It was darkening, too. The audience looked on. Owen felt his body. There 
<br>
 was certainly more tone to it since he came. He felt like he hadn't in YEARS! His chest was 
<br>
 now bordered by a faint line of dark chest hair. He noticed that for some unknowable, 
<br>
 unexplainable reason, he and Randy now had the exact same tone and definition to their 
<br>
 bodies. Owen stood up. Hell, he might as well enjoy this! He began feeling himself. His skin 
<br>
 was now darker...it was more tan! And Randy's was pale now...they had switched skin tones! 
<br>
 A frustrated Randy was finally let go of the wave of weight that held him down. He felt his 
<br>
 cheeks and they were sweating and hairless. No! he thought. No no no! He clenched his 
<br>
 head, and his fingers were now streaming with hair as he pulled it away from his head. 
<br>

<br>
 Owen felt hair suddenly flip out of the folicles as if this was a hair commercial on TV...but it 
<br>
 was real and so much better! The hair swept across his head...still shorter than Randy's once 
<br>
 was. The mirror behind him, on the wall, revealed what he had turned into. Owen now looked 
<br>
 like a twentysomething stud. And his belt was killing him. His pants outstretched. They were 
<br>
 chafing his pants! 
<br>

<br>
 Randy stood up. He and Owen looked at each other. Randy had shrunk to Owen's 
<br>
 height...and Owen was now an inch taller! And growing. Owen looked like a cross now of 
<br>
 Randy and himself. Like himself, but younger! And his muscles were growing. It seemed like 
<br>
 every minute or so they swelled slightly bigger than before. Like two weeks at the gym with 
<br>
 every minute...or more! 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;We're switching ages...aren't we?&quot; asked Randy. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;It...it looks that way, son,&quot; said Owen. &quot;Whoa!&quot; His voice was so much different now! It was 
<br>
 deeper and louder! Randy could only squeek. 
<br>

<br>
 Randy tried to keep his pants up. The sides were clumping up along him now. Owen had to 
<br>
 release his belt. His legs streeeeeetched against them. He could feel the fiber. His legs were 
<br>
 like a frikkin lumberjacks now! 
<br>

<br>
 Owen felt himself sweating more than ever. He wiped at his hairy arms, his sweat drenched 
<br>
 head, which now extended another inch. He breathed heavily and started punching the 
<br>
 air...vainly trying to exercise. He felt like he was going the speed of a freight train! 
<br>

<br>
 Randy was now bald across much of his head. His chest and body were like that when he 
<br>
 was fifteen...only paler. Wrinkles were now making their way across his thin, thin stubble. 
<br>
 Owen he now had to look up to. 
<br>

<br>
 Owen and Randy were covered with the green glow one more time. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUHHH!!!!&quot; screamed Owen, after the green glow was gone. Randy 
<br>
 sounded like he was sobbing. 
<br>

<br>
 Owen's guns were now big. Real big. He looked at the reflection in the mirror. He stumbled 
<br>
 and fell on the ground. His heart throbbed and his skin felt great! He had seen a rich dark day 
<br>
 old beard on his cheek before he fell. 
<br>

<br>
 He fell past the sand. He struggled to get the slacks off...they didn't fit...he felt like they were 
<br>
 cutting off his circulation. He wriggled out of his pants...now less sweaty than he was before. 
<br>
 He looked at the mirror. His face..his body...he was like Randy in every detail...the same 
<br>
 slightly flat nose...the dark, flat, glistening hair. He looked Italian almost! Wait..he probably 
<br>
 was now! 
<br>

<br>
 Randy had to get rid of his pants too. They no longer fit him. His hair was all around him now, 
<br>
 except for the dsrk, short gray sides. 
<br>

<br>
 In his own turn, he had seem his skin loosen, his face become smaller..the bones in FRIKKIN 
<br>
 LEGS shrink!!!! He now stood as he did when he was a young teenager. Only about as old as 
<br>
 his dad was. He was now an older man. He could feel it. He could feel the skin and 
<br>
 muscles...his muscles...weakening! 
<br>

<br>
 Both men stood in their underwear. Owen was now looking like a goddamn underwear model. 
<br>
 And he knew it. He stood looking at his stud body, in shock. He still felt bad for Randy, 
<br>
 though. 
<br>

<br>
 Randy shook out of his jeans, which wasn't hard. Now he knew what he was. He was Owen, 
<br>
 but only in a dark black leather vest. He wasn't fat at least. But he was...old! He had gray 
<br>
 hair! 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Now you see what the Madame Illusia is capable of doing...&quot; said Stephan. &quot;As for you 
<br>
 do...do not fear. What is done can be undone. As a matter of fact it can be done with more 
<br>
 speed as well. But perhaps you'd like to...savor this experience for now. We know for a fact 
<br>
 that each of you has wondered what it would be like to say...become a muscular young 
<br>
 man...&quot; he said motioning to Owen, in his studly near nudity. &quot;Or perhaps what it would be 
<br>
 like to have sex as an older, more submissive man...&quot; he said 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Like role play, only the absolute unequaled!&quot; declared Stephan proudly. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;It's true,&quot; said Randy &quot;All my life I've been the big one...I can have anyone I want...&quot; he 
<br>
 stopped short. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;It's alright, we both know,&quot; said Stephan. &quot;We find that gay men are usually more apt to 
<br>
 enjoy the delights we offer. And we are able to arrange it so that during these performances it 
<br>
 is only or mostly gay men in attendance.&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Well...I was about to say,&quot; continued Randy, &quot;that...I've never known what it's like to just...let 
<br>
 someone do what they want with me...to be so much more...powerful. Not just powerful, 
<br>
 but...the danger that might come with me being smaller, unable to defend myself...it is kind of 
<br>
 a turn on....&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Then...you don't mind??&quot; said Owen. You don't mind me having your body, son? Owen never 
<br>
 felt happier. It was like all his erotic dreams come true. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Hell, why the fuck not?&quot; said Randy. I feel like I could take you on...if you're willing to allow 
<br>
 it...&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 A broad grin crossed Owen's face. He reached down onto the ground. He was practically 
<br>
 giddy! He shuffled into Randy's tough-man jeans. God, this felt great! He felt like he could 
<br>
 take on the world! Everyone would want him now! He could just walk into a bar and not have 
<br>
 to rely on small talk at all! He could just pick someone! But...he would keep Randy close to 
<br>
 him...if Randy chose to remain this way...&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;How long will..will we remain this way?&quot; asked Owen, fingering the leather vest that Randy 
<br>
 still wore. Randy got the idea and reluctantly took off the vest, and handed it over to an eager 
<br>
 Owen. He shirked it, pulling on it like he was a kid again...not even believing some gift given 
<br>
 to him at Christmas. He rubbed Randy's shoulders comfortingly. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;That is up to you...Madame Illusia can talk to you later about whether you...&quot; he said 
<br>
 motioning to Randy, the old 40-ish gray haired Randy, &quot;want to remain this way or not. But I 
<br>
 assume...that you would like to stay as you are...&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 Owen replied enthusiastically. &quot;All my life I've dreamed of being this tall stud. I want people 
<br>
 lookin' up at me when I'm on the street. Oh man...&quot; Meanwhile, Randy pulled on Owen's 
<br>
 stretched out slacks. They fit him easily. He also realized his gut was a little bit more 
<br>
 rounded than he was before. Not fat, but that area was limp. He actually had some love 
<br>
 handles! Small though they were...he was astounded at how turned on he was...how exciting 
<br>
 it all was! 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Now as for you two...the barrier is down and we won't force that upon anyone again...this 
<br>
 was after all, simply a demonstration,&quot; continued Stephan. &quot;Now the time has come for 
<br>
 magic! We are not limited to making people's bodies look like each other. We can also make 
<br>
 it so that you switch bodies entirely! The clothing issue won't have to come up, you see...&quot; A 
<br>
 small number of laughs from the audience. &quot;Yes, this was rather dramatic, but we wanted to 
<br>
 make an excellent show for you. To prove our point as it were. We will not harm any of you or 
<br>
 force you do to anything forcefully. We can make any man make any way he dreams...any 
<br>
 age, any shape, any color...who will be next? I imagine there must be any number of people 
<br>
 wanting to step up...&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 Owen and Randy stepped off to the side...now dressed in one another's clothes, now placed 
<br>
 in each others bodies...they talked silently as the crowd started talking...the rush of talk filled 
<br>
 the room. A number of people lined up to tell Stephan what they wanted. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Yes, yes...it is a dream come true...there are no strings, but I must add...any donation you 
<br>
 can make to our cause would...probably intensify the effectiveness of the results you 
<br>
 desire...&quot; said Stephan like the expert marketer he was. 
<br>

<br>
 Who will be next and what will happen?? thought so many members of the crowd...</p>
