<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You suddenly have a short migraine and started rubbing your head.  After the migraine passes, you note that there&#39;s still a slight buzzing sensation going on inside your head.  <br />
&quot;Weird, even for me.  Either I hit my head harder than I thought, or this place is giving my bizarre-crap-o-meter some seriously bad vibes.&quot;  Before you can dwell on it any further, you hear a voice beside you.  <br />
&quot;Well, well, what do we have here.  So you&#39;re the one who left that stuff near the entrance.  I knew someone would follow me eventually, though I never imagined they&#39;d be as interesting as you.&quot;  <br />
As the voice spoke, you turn and see The White Rabbit standing a few feet beside you.  You note that he&#39;s smaller than you, with the top of he&#39;s ears reaching the rim of your skirt.  After he&#39;s done talking, you decide to speak to him in a confident tone.  <br />
&quot;Hello there, I&#39;m Marcia Caldwell: Paranormal Private Investigator and your invasion of my world ends here.  I presume your suppose to be The White Rabbit?&quot;  <br />
&quot;Indeed I am.  It&#39;s a pleasure to meet you Alice.&quot;  The White Rabbit responded.  <br />
&quot;What?  No, I just told you.  My name&#39;s Marcia.&quot;  You try correcting him.  <br />
&quot;But then why are you are you wearing Alice&#39;s clothes?&quot;  The White Rabbit said, pointing at the outfit you were currently wearing.  <br />
&quot;Surely the only person who would be wearing an outfit like yours would be Miss Alice herself, right?&quot;  The White Rabbit tried to reason, but you weren&#39;t buying it.  <br />
&quot;Look here bugs, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s any of your business.&quot;  You snap back at him.  <br />
&quot;Hey there, no need for rudeness.  All I&#39;m saying is that if a curious young woman like yourself followed me down a rabbit hole and was wearing Alice&#39;s clothing, then logically that young woman would have to be Alice.  Am I correct?&quot;  <br />
For some strange reason, a part of you seemed to be agreeing with The White Rabbit&#39;s logic.  But you ignored it since you knew it was wrong.  <br />
&quot;Well your wrong, it&#39;s Marcia.&quot;  <br />
&quot;Really then.  Are you sure?&quot;  <br />
&quot;... YES!  Now quit your B S and take me home right now and never come back or else!&quot;  You yelled at him.  At this point you were ready to kick White Rabbit ass.  But before you can, he&#39;s watch goes off again.  <br />
&quot;Sorry my dear, but I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ve run out of time.  T T F N, Ta Ta For Now.&quot;  And just like that, The White Rabbit took off like a bullet down the corridor on the left.  <br />
&quot;Oh no you don&#39;t!  Get back here!  I&#39;m not finished with you.&quot;  You yelled as you ran after him.  You kept a good pace with him, but The White Rabbit was still ahead of you.  Eventually he entered a door at the end of the hallway and you tried to follow suite, only to be greeted by another smaller door and hitting your head.  You land on your rear and rub the front of your head.  You feel slightly dizzy, but you shake it off rather quickly.  The buzzing you felt in your skull before had now gained strength, not that you cared as you were hellbent on catching that rabbit.  You pull yourself off the floor and opened the door, only to find an even smaller door behind it.  You open that door up and find an even smaller door behind that one.  After opening that one, you open another door and are finally able to enter it.  <br />
&quot;Ugh, finally.&quot;  you say to yourself.  It&#39;s a tight squeeze, but you are able to fully get inside as the doors behind you are sealed off.  You were now in a massive rectangular room with doors of different shapes and sizes along the walls, but The White Rabbit was nowhere to be found.  <br />
&quot;Curiouser and curiouser.&quot;  You found yourself saying, though you didn&#39;t know why.  You walk over to the doors and find that each of them is locked.  You try the smallest door at the end of the room and the knob yells out &quot;Ow&quot;, startling you.  <br />
&quot;Oh, sorry about that. I do beg your pardon.&quot;  You said to The Doorknob, being more polite than usual.  <br />
&quot;Oh it&#39;s quite alright my dear.&quot;  The Doorknob spoke with a feminine voice.  &quot;But you did give me quite a turn.&quot;  <br />
You try to speak, but then The Doorknob comments on the pun she just made and laughs.  <br />
&quot;Rather good one, eh. Doorknob, turn.&quot;  <br />
&quot;Excuse me ma&#39;am.&quot;  You said.  Unfortunately The Doorknob wasn&#39;t listening, annoying you.  <br />
&quot;One good turn deserves another.  {coughs} But now then, what can I do for you my dear?&quot;  The Doorknob asks you.  <br />
&quot;Well first off, my name is Marcia Caldwell: Paranormal Private Investigator.  And secondly, I&#39;m looking for a white rabbit.  Did he come this way?&quot;  You ask.    <br />
&quot;You mean The White Rabbit?  Ohhh, so you must be Alice.  He metioned that you were were coming.&quot;  <br />
&quot;No, no, no.  My name is Marcia, not Alice.&quot;  <br />
&quot;But if you aren&#39;t Alice, then why are you wearing her clothes?&quot;  <br />
&quot;Well, it all started yesterday when I got a-  Look, it doesn&#39;t matter.  I&#39;m telling you, my name is Marcia Caldwell.  I am definitely not Alice.&quot;  <br />
&quot;Really, are you sure?&quot;  The Doorknob asked.  You hesitate for a second, but then continued talking.  <br />
&quot;Yes, I&#39;m sure.  Now can you please tell me where The White Rabbit is already.&quot;  <br />
&quot;Why he went through this door of course, but I&#39;m afraid your much too big.  It is simply impassable.&quot;  <br />
You sigh for a moment.  Having read the book and seen the disney film many times, you knew what was coming.  <br />
&quot;Alright, I&#39;ll bite. How do I shrink myself?&quot;  You ask the The Doorknob.  <br />
&quot;Try the bottle on the table.&quot;  <br />
You turn around and see a glass table appear out of nowhere with a tiny glass bottle with a tag on top of it.  You get up, walk over to the table and pick up the bottle.  <br />
&quot;Read the directions, and directly you will be directed in the right direction.  {laughs}&quot;  The Doorknob tells you.  You read the tag and it says DRINK ME.  You also notice there&#39;s no key on the table.  <br />
&quot;Before I drink this, I was wondering if you were locked.&quot;  You ask The Doorknob.  <br />
&quot;Indeed I am.&quot;  She responds.  <br />
&quot;I was afraid of that.  Well, looks like I have no other choice.  Bottoms up.&quot;  <br />
You then bring the bottle to your lips and drink all its content.  You actually found the liquid to be very refreshing as you placed the empty bottle on the table and waited for the shrinking to start.  You didn&#39;t have to wait too long as you felt your body shifting its proportions as you slowly shrank in size.  This wasn&#39;t the first time you&#39;d been shrunken, but at least this time you were prepared for it.  You looked down at yourself and see the Alice in Wonderland outfit shrink with you, much to your relief.  You then look around the ever expanding room and table and find yourself smiling.  When you shrank before, it had been a really quick experience.  But now with your whole body slowly shrinking, you could actually enjoy getting smaller for a change.  The Doorknob watches you with amusement on her face as you shrank.  Eventually you stopped shrinking at around 10 inches tall, just the right size for the door.  <br />
&quot;Well, you seem to have handled that rather nicely my dear.&quot;  The Doorknob said.  You blush a little when she tells you that.  <br />
&quot;Thank you, it was the first time I could actually enjoy being shrunken for a change.&quot;  <br />
&quot;Oh, so this wasn&#39;t your first shrink?&quot;  <br />
&quot;Unfortunately no, I&#39;ve been tiny a few times before and it wasn&#39;t fun at all.&quot;  <br />
&quot;Hmm, I see.  So in that regard, you are Alice.&quot;  The Doorknob suggested, though this time you agreed with her.  <br />
&quot;I suppose in that regard, yes, I am Alice.&quot;  You admitted.  <br />
You&#39;re then suddenly overcome with another migraine, one stronger than last time.  After that&#39;s over with, the buzzing in your head has gotten much stronger as well and makes you dizzy.  Eventually you shake it off and come back to reality.  <br />
&quot;My goodness.  That was quite an unusual experience, even for me.  Wait, did I really just say that out loud?&quot;  You look over at The Doorknob and notice her having a slight grin on her face.  <br />
Um, why are grinning at me like that?&quot;  You ask her.  The Doorknob then shakes her face a bit.  <br />
&quot;Oh, I&#39;m very sorry about that my dear.  I just thought of another good pun, that&#39;s all.  Say is that the key up there.&quot;  <br />
You look up on the table and indeed see a golden key laying on edge.  <br />
&quot;Oh, that won&#39;t be a problem for me.  Because unlike Alice, I have the gift of telekinesis.  I&#39;ll just pull the key down to the floor, quite easily I might add.&quot;  You tell The Doorknob, noting that your words got a little weird at the end.  You try using your telekinetic powers to move the key, but found the it to heavy to move.  Eventually you give up trying, realizing that your diminished size has also affected some of your abilities.  <br />
&quot;Oh dear, what am I going to do now?&quot;  You tell yourself, this time noticing that you had slightly developed a british accent.</p>
