<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“You don’t suppose he went to rub his Alicorn against a tree?” Elva inquired after a moment as he thought about how his friend’s fledgling horn had been bothering him some since it had started growing in.<br />
<br />
Unaware that his bedroom had started to morph into something more common for an eleven-year-old girl, Alyssa reached over and up and took a brush down off his dress and began idly running it through his hair. Feeling concerned for Aurora and what his friend might be going through, he asked, “You think we should go check on him,” as he finished with the brush and put it back on his dresser.<br />
<br />
His tongue starting to look like a dog’s tongue, Elva started to pant. After a minute or so he shifted and replied, “Perhaps we should give him a bit longer.”<br />
<br />
Alyssa, nodding, absently started tapping a finger against a nearby book. After a couple seconds, Elva barked out, “I can’t take this. I’m going to go look for Aurora,” and standing, he took a couple tottering steps and dropped to all fours.<br />
<br />
Confused, he looked at his hands, then back at his feet, both of which still appeared human. Tongue lolling out, his face also still pretty much human, Elva tried to figure out why he’d tried to walk about on two legs. His spine, hips, shoulders and legs silently realigning, changing him from a bipedal to a quadruped, he started to pant as he was sure something was off. As his genitalia shifted slightly to accommodate his new stance, Elva gave a slight barking laugh and muttered, “I’ve always gone about on four legs. How else would I walk,” to which Alyssa asked, “You say something?”<br />
<br />
A quick shake of his head, Elva told him, “Just mumbling to myself,” before lowering his head and sniffing the carpet. Picking up Aurora’s scent, Elva gave an excited yip and started in the direction it went. Wanting to finish the character creation so that they could get to the actual game, he started to quickly move through the trailer, unaware that his tailbone was extending into a tail.<br />
<br />
Inside his room, Alyssa hoped that Elva would be able to find Aurora and it wouldn’t take the two of them too long to return. Reaching for the note, wanting to re-read his last response, and forgetting that it had already vanished, he turned the blank sheet of paper over. Expecting to see his answer, he was shocked to instead find something else printed that was longer than the normal questions, as well as longer than what he had wrote. Reading the print, he stopped, shook his head and muttered, “This can’t be right,” and re-reading it, Alyssa leapt up and tore out of the bedroom in search of his friend.<br />
<br />
Tail finishing forming and starting to wag back and forth, his balance shifted a smidge, but Elva didn’t really notice. Rather, he was overwhelmed with all the scents he smelt on floor, with the carpet providing more than the linoleum. Reaching the front door, he paused and stared up at the doorknob. The most recent smells indicated that he friend had gone outside, but he was confused on how to open the door and get out. Leaping so that his front legs left the floor, he began scrabbling at the door until quite by accident one of his hands hit the knob and caused it to jar, which in turn caused the door to pop open.<br />
<br />
Excited by the open door, Elva dropped his front legs to the floor and as his fingernails fell out and claws began pushing out of three of his five fingers, he thrust his face through the opening and forced the door open. The fingernails he lost vanishing the instant they hit the floor, Elva didn’t even notice as he ran out the open door, smells and sounds beckoning him, the prospect of play and other activities foremost on his mind. Reaching the open door shortly after his friend had gone through it, Alyssa called out, “Elva, come by,” in an attempt to get his friend to heel.<br />
<br />
His friend failing to respond, Alyssa became slightly worried that Elva might have taken off again and quickly searching the surrounding area, he located his friend sniffing at a tree. Calling out, “Elva, come by,” he started toward his friend, listening as Elva said, “I can smell him. Aurora was here. But not recently,” ran to another tree, looked up it and exclaimed, “Do you smell it. There’s a squirrel,” before taking off to a flowerbed close to a neighbour’s trailer, were he proceeded to squat down and mark his territory.<br />
<br />
Worried about what he read, feeling frustrated that Elva was once again not focusing, Alyssa called, “Elva, come by,” a third time, then added, “We need to finish the character creation. If we don’t, I think something bad will happen.”<br />
<br />
“Nothing bad will happen,” Elva barked as he sniffed a patch of grass.<br />
<br />
A huff of agitation escaping him, Alyssa replied, “Yeah, but listen to this,” and holding up the note, he read aloud, ‘Don’t worry about Aurora. Your friend is fine and shall finish the “character creation” portion of this game all in due time. In the meantime, the next question will be in the same vain as the previous question, with you answering it like you were rolling a stat and then answering with a number. So, shall we continue? I don’t need to remind you of the consequences of what shall happen if you don’t, do I?’ Lowering the note slightly, Alyssa exclaimed, “I think the note really is serious and that something will happen if we don’t continue.”<br />
<br />
To his chagrined, Elva still didn’t heed him, or the note, and instead continued to mark his territory, sniff areas, run after small things only he could see and generally behave like a dog. Glancing down at the note, wondering what he should do, Alyssa was surprised when he saw the words, ‘I warned your friend’ had appeared. Wondering what this meant, he was startled out of his thoughts when he heard a barking noise and looking in the direction of the sound, he grimaced when he saw one of the neighbourhood dogs, a lab named Edison, had gotten loose.<br />
<br />
Elva, having heard, and smelled, the dog, stopped for a moment as everything went sideways and, for the life of him, he couldn’t figure out why he was behaving the way he was. Confused, certain that something was off, he became alarmed when it dawned on him that he was walking about on four legs, but then it scared him even more when Edison took a keen interest in him and began play bowing, scampering about and sniffing in an area he considered private. Bothered by this, and the fact that he was starting to feel really weird about the male dog, Elva stared at the Labrador and felt that maybe he should ignore him, tuck his tail between his legs and hold himself in a certain way that indicated he wasn’t interested. But, to his alarm, he did the exact opposite as he lifted his tail, turned and presented himself to the other dog.<br />
<br />
Edison, needing no other cue, did exactly what was in his natural. His penis starting to slide out of its sheath, he mounted Elva and began moving about in an effort to penetrate the other dog. Scared and horrified by what was happening, how right it felt and that he was enjoying it, Elva missed what was happening to his body as his tried to tell himself to pull away, but instead shifted to better accommodate Edison. As his feet and hands morphed into paws, Edison finally secured his purchase and began to grab Elva tightly. As the lab pressed his penis up against Elva and started probing, Elva’s body began to adapt to what was about to happen as his scrotum started to shrink and pull tightly against his body, forming the rest of the exterior female genitalia, which caused his testicles to draw up into his body and became fully functional ovaries. Whimpering not so much from discomfort, but from enjoyment at the feeling of having Edison stick his penis in her vagina, the sensation of it growing erect and the plunging sensation from having a knotted penis stuck in him, the last of Elva’s humanity slipped away, leaving behind a bitch that had been magically altered, then banished to another realm.<br />
<br />
From where he stood, unsure of what he should do, Alyssa watched the two dogs for a couple seconds before turning away. Missing the last of his friend’s transformation, Elva&#39;s nose and mouth fusing to together then pushing out into a muzzle, Alyssa walked slowly over to the steps leading up the front door of the trailer he called home and sat down. Curious to know if this was the note’s way of punishing his friend for not continuing, knowing that Elva couldn’t get pregnant because Edison was neutered, Alyssa shivered and considered what would happen to him if he failed to go on with the character creation. Drawing a blank, hoping that Elva would be all right and might change her mind about continuing, Alyssa eventually looked down at the note and read, ‘Question 11. If you were a girl, how intelligent would you be? Think of it as ten being average, anything below it would be considered a mental deficiency and anything above it would be considered gifted, genius if you will.’</p>
