<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As much as Tomoyo wanted to visit her new mother, she knew what she had to do. <br />
She looked down at the plastic gun in her hands.  She could hear Curt-Dono’s every thought, past or present, and her maid’s instinct to meet his every want and need, combined with her self-made backstory incorporating him into the role of the goddess’s reincarnating lover, made it SO hard not to simply teleport right to him, return his gun, and ease his worries in every and any way she could.  She knew he already felt deeply uncomfortable with three goddesses calling him “Master,” not feeling worthy of such a high level of importance to them, and knew that making even MORE goddesses would just amplify those feelings.  <br />
<br />
But she also knew from her understanding of the functions of the universe, that the world now required the existence of multiple gods and goddesses to function, even if it had, supposedly, started without one.  She was powerful yes, overwhelmingly so, but she couldn’t manage the whole world on her own. And no god in this universe could create a being of greater power than itself, and creating an equal would be difficult even for her on her own.  No, she needed to hang onto the gun.  It was the only way to create a new pantheon.  For the safety of her Master, and the universe he lived in.  She could try to make it up to him later.<br />
<br />
First, she reached out for any traces of the divine already out there, Ammy-Chan and Issun-Chan aside.  To her surprise, she found one; the little dragon girl, Simone, had a spark of the divine coursing through her.  In time she could grow to become a goddess of dragons and justice.  But Tomoyo decided to let her enjoy her childhood for now, rather than retconning her into being the right age right now.  With only three dragons in the world at the moment, including Simone herself, that was a lower priority.<br />
<br />
With no other divine sparks out there, Tomoyo begant to consider what roles needed to be filled.  Her first two goddesses already covered life, death, the sun, and darkness.  A moon goddess would be a handy counterpart to have.  She’d also need to at least cover the four classical elements of earth, air, water, and fire.<br />
<br />
She looked down at her own blazing body, and mentally checked “fire” off the list.<br />
<br />
Other “elements” could be given some consideration too; electricity, ice, plants.  And of course, a divine over the non-anthro animals would be needed, too.  Then, for the human experience, while friendship had already been covered, love, family, knowledge, and creativity, would be a priority.<br />
<br />
With the “must haves” on the list, she could get to work.  She’d focus on minor gods for agriculture, industry and the arts after that, and perhaps go further in making goddesses for more specific niches when they were finished.  Issun-Chan had become a goddess of paperwork after all, so no task was too small.<br />
<br />
Teleporting back into the mortal world again, she mused on how poorly this would thought of gods; regarding them as cosmic bullies and final bosses for JRPGs when they were acknowledged at all.  And their followers were treated even worse, seen as weak-minded simpletons or conniving schemers.  Hopefully, they could work to change all that.<br />
<br />
The first place she arrived was an old observatory on the opposite side of the planet from Curt, where a man in his forties was alternating between looking at a telescope, and writing down his observations on a crowded notebook.<br />
<br />
‘Hmm,’ Tomoyo thought, ‘should we keep to the Japanese theming and choose a rabbit, or would the wolf&#39;s association work better here… No, actually…’  She adjusted the species setting, left the unaware option selected (a step she’d continue for all other goddesses,) letting the remaining options be “target’s preference,” and fired.<br />
<br />
The man’s plain button-up shirt and khakis wove together into a black dress, with a hint of a gothic design to it.  A white apron and lace headband appeared around the man, as black fur spread over his face, then his arms.  His body became thinner, and his chest and hips expanded dramatically, as her body took on feminine curves.  Her ears grew longer, larger, and took a triangular shape as they migrated up the sides of her head.  They twitched slightly, then she turned around, revealing her jaws slowly pushing forward, her nose becoming a stumpy end to her snout, while little fangs poked out of her mouth.  Her fingers grew longer, a webbing forming between each digit, as well as the sides of her body, forming a pair of wings that somehow still managed to function as hands.<br />
<br />
“Goddess Tomoyo?”  The bat said, shaking her head slightly as her mind, and very world, was altered.  Her old family, friends, and history was drastically altered, having been alive for several centuries at this point.  She could tell from memories shared with Tomoyo that she had been human in a previous timeline, and that their Master had been indirectly responsible for her upgrade, but the nature of her old life just felt… wrong to her somehow.  She was the moon goddess Lucielle, and Master Curt’s humble maid, now, and those facts were what was important to her.   “Tomoyo, thank you, and Master Curt, for awakening me to my calling.”  She bowed.  “I will not disappoint.  The moon will keep its phases perfectly, and its orbit will keep the tides in the needed ebb and flow, and Master will be tended to.”<br />
<br />
“Thank you, Lucielle-chan.”<br />
<br />
Lucielle spoke simply and seriously.   “I know you have more goddesses to make for our world.  I won’t keep you.  Good luck.”<br />
<br />
“See you later.”  Tomoyo waved, and teleported away.<br />
<br />
Truth be told, the person’s original background didn’t make a difference to their role.  Once they’d been zapped, they’d have a new life story, due to being made several hundred years older.  Still, Tomoyo wanted to keep things on theme.  <br />
<br />
She landed on a small boat off the east coast of America, where a trio of fishermen had cast their nets, waiting for their catch.  One zap later, and one of the fisherman’s clothes began to shift into a blue, waterproof maid uniform, as his body became a bit thinner.  Then, she started to grow taller, her neck becoming longer as turquoise scales appeared all over.  A long, thin tail, ending in a broad fin slipped out from under her dress.  Her shoes vanished, revealing webbed, scaly feet, with long talons.  Her hands, similarly, lost their nails, claws growing through her fingertips in their place, as webbing formed between each digit.  Her eyes became wide and cute looking as they turned yellow, her jaws stretching forward into a short, rounded snout, that displayed cute little fangs.  Her ears grew wider, fanning out like fins, while her hair grew down the reach her back, turning green.<br />
<br />
Finally, she instinctively jumped in the ocean, as her body, (and the dress, as well,) began to grow bigger, doubling in size within seconds, then surpassing the boat, then towering over her mortal friends like a six story building, even with the lower half of her body below the waves.  Yest despite everything, the water around the boat was gentle, the cute new leviathan water goddess’s power keeping the sea calm for her little friends.<br />
<br />
Normally, such a massive creature would fall prey to the square-cube law, on top of the logistical difficulties of finding enough food to keep her body going, finding places to rest that fit, etc.  But such things were no issue for goddesses<br />
<br />
“Oh, Tomoyo!”  The leviathan cheered.  “Didn’t see you come in!”<br />
<br />
The two fishermen turned around quickly, startled as they saw the fiery fox before them.<br />
<br />
“Hello Derya-Chan!  Just checking in on the other goddesses.”  Tomoyo winked, before teleporting out, freaking out the two fishermen again.<br />
<br />
Her next stop was a retirement home.  Making herself invisible and noiseless to avoid disturbing the residents, she found an elderly woman and former pilot for her next target, and let loose transformative bolt.  <br />
<br />
The woman’s wrinkles began to smooth over as the upper half of her torso was covered in black feathers, while brown fur sprouted from her lower half.  Her clothing disappeared as her back straightened out, her body becoming toned and athletic in build.  As fur spread down her legs , her toes bluged larger, pads forming on them and the bottoms of her feet, giving her a set of lion paws.  Her forearms and hands, in contrast, grew yellow scales, sharp talons emerging from her fingertips.  An eagle’s beak stretched from the woman’s mouth,and her nose shifted down into a pair of nostrils on said beak.  Her ears shrank back, while her green eyes grew sharper.  A lion’s tail stretched out behind her, and finally, a pair of broad, feathered wings sprouted from the Griffon’s shoulders.<br />
<br />
The woman’s room came to be occupied by another as reality shifted the remnants of her old life away.  The air goddess, whose name was now Sora, was now here just visiting some mortal friends of hers, completely oblivious to her old life.  Every step she took seemed to radiate confidence.  She waved to the invisible Tomoyo, and returned to speaking to her friends.<br />
<br />
This left just one of the classical elements unaccounted for; earth.  For that, she visited a construction yard.  Finding a burly man moving equipment, she sniped him from a distance, watching as his skin turned grey, his colthes disappearing as he grew steadily taller and broader.   Her chest swelled to an impressive size as her sex changed, though her muscles were even more stunning.  Her feet shrank back, her toes looking like little white-bumps on her tree-trunk like legs.  And speaking of trucks, her nose began to grow longer and longer, draping down past her chest, becoming completely flexible.  From her mouth, a pair of white tusks grew, and her ears fanned out inot the broad ears of an elephant.  The power to reshape the mountains themselves filled the new goddess’s body, and she teleported away to the divine realm as the remnants of her old life were removed from existence, her new life as Terra taking its place.<br />
<br />
The classical elements taken care of, Tomoyo next teleported to a power plant, zapping a female worker.  The woman’s clothes disappeared, orange fur with black, jagged, bolt-like stripes taking its place.  Her feet became a set of feline paws, and a thin tail grew out behind her.  Her fingers and toes grew retractable claws.  Her mouth and nose pressed out into the short, broad muzzle of a tiger, her teeth sharpening, her ears becoming round and moving to the top of her head.  Despite her fierce species, she looked oddly cute.  The laid-back new thunder goddess, Kari, then vanished, as history was changed, she was now out in another part of the world, casually resting on top of a raging storm cloud.<br />
<br />
Tomoyo’s next stop was out in Alaska, her burning fur melting the snow around her.  Sneaking up on her next victim, a woman in the middle of ice-fishing, she took her next shot.<br />
<br />
The woman’s fur coat changed to a white fur dress, a black apron and headband appearing as well.  Her face became rounder, her nose turning black and wet.  Her eyes became big and black.  Her mouth pushed out into a little round snout, while her torso got a little rounder as well.  Her hands and feet flattened out, looking almost like flippers.  Whitish-blue fur that glistened like fresh snow covered her entire body, little whiskers forming at the sides of her muzzle.  A thick tail, ending in a fin, stuck out from under the cute seal maid’s dress.  Her fishing rod disappeared as her old life was erased, and replaced with the life of Krystal, the ice goddess. <br />
<br />
Noticing Tomoyo, Krystal smiled, and bowed, before diving into the hole in the ice in front of her.  “Hey there Tomoyo!  Wanna go for a swim?  It won’t take too long.”<br />
<br />
“Sorry, gotta take care of business for Curt-Dono, you know how it is.”<br />
<br />
“I’ll be sure to bring him some fresh fish when I head back.”  <br />
<br />
Tomoyo giggled as she teleported away.<br />
<br />
<br />
The burning vixen arrived in a greenhouse, where an old man was tending to his flowers.  Another bolt fired, and the man’s skin began to smooth over, green scales with a leafy texture spreading all over his form.  His clothes vanished as his sex inverted, and two mounds larger than her head grew from her chest.  Her legs began to shrink as her spine grew longer and longer, becoming a thick, flexible tail, much like Janet’s, the snake-woman from Skyla’s old office.  Her figure became slender and lithe, and her jaws stretched forth into a triangular snout.  Her sense of taste grew far sharper as her tongue forked, and her teeth extended and sharpened into fangs.  Her ears shrank back into little holes in the sides of her head, while her eyes turned bright red, her pupils narrowing.  Flowers grew in odd spots all over the snake’s body, making her look something like a vine herself.<br />
<br />
The greenhouse expanded to become the new plant-goddess’s temple, the glass and steel becoming polished marble as every plant’s color became bolder and more vibrant.  Virdencia, the serpentine new plant goddess watered each plant gingerly.  She enjoyed the chance to tend to her personal garden between aiding in the growth of every tree, flower, and blade of grass around the world.<br />
<br />
Tomoyo’s next target was a young man volunteering in an animal shelter.  Another pull of the trigger, and the man began to grow gold fur in place of clothing.  Her hips grew wider as her sex changed, and her body a little shorter, giving her a cute appearance.  Her toes clenched into thick hooves, the rest of her feet arching up to give her a digitigrade stance.  A short tail, trailed by a lot of much longer, shimmering hair, drooped down just over her rear.  Her fingers merged, creating three-fingered, hoof-like hands.  Her face grew into the long muzzle of a horse, her ears pointing up as they became a little longer and narrower.  Her hair became a gleaming yellow mane, and a pair of bright, golden-feathered wings sprouted from her back.  <br />
<br />
The pegasus goddess of (non-anthro) animals was receiving far more cooperation from the sickly cats and dogs she watched over, and she spoke lovingly to each of them (even if they didn’t truly understand her).<br />
<br />
“Have fun, Lisa-chan,” Tomoyo whispered before teleporting away.<br />
<br />
The next target was a woman freshly out of college, waiting tables while trying to find a better job.  Tomoyo pulled the trigger, and thick, fluffy wool, in a pure, pristine white color began to grow all over the woman’s skin.  Her clothes disappeared as she gained a petite figure, her feet shifting into little hooves, and her hands changing in much the way the pegasus’s had.    A short little tail poked out above her rear, while her face grew forward a few inches.  Her hair became curlier and fluffier, just like her wool, while her ears grew longer and wider, flopping down the sides of her head.<br />
<br />
As the world changed around her, the reason for the adorable little sheep to be at the restaurant changed, as well.  She’d currently made herself invisible, and was looking over various people in the resteraunt, occasionally nodding as she spotted a couple that fit what she was looking for.  When she did, she plucked a strand of wool from her body, which quickly turned red.  She’d then tie one end of the invisible strand around one person’s wrist, and the second around the wrist of the other half of the couple<br />
<br />
Tomoyo decided not to interrupt love goddess Yoko as she worked (looking adorable while doing it), and simply moved on.  <br />
<br />
Tomoyo soon arrived in the home of a woman nursing her newborn.  Another bolt of lightning flew, and within moments the woman started to grow brown fur, her chest swelling significantly in size.  Her legs grew stronger, and her feet far longer, as she gained leathery pads on their underside.  Her clothes began to disappear as a thick, powerful tail extended behind her.  Her mouth extended into a somewhat narrow muzzle, and her ears moved to the top of her head, becoming shorter and narrower.  Finally, the kangaroo’s signature pouch formed, her baby slipping into it as she was changed to match her divine mother’s new species.<br />
<br />
The house around the new goddess of motherhood and family began to an impressive temple made of marble.  Hannah smiled, listening carefully to the prayers of mothers across the globe.<br />
<br />
Her final stop was made in a college campus.  A shot was fired from the ray gun, striking a middle-aged woman who had been handing out tracts at an event.  She began to grow shimmering blue scales, her legs joining together into a long serpent’s tail as her clothing vanished.  Her body became thin and streamlined, her hair being replaced by a crest of rainbow feathers.  Her jaws extended into a serpentine snout, her tongue forked, and her teeth turned to long fangs.  One her back, a pair of majestic wings, with feathers shimmering like the sunrise appeared, marking the appearance of a new Quetzalcoatl goddess of knowledge, who many students were eagerly lining up to meet, as history shifted.<br />
<br />
Tomoyo invisibly wandered between the booths at the event, eventually finding a young man displaying his collections of art.  One more zap, and he’d begun to grow dark feathers, interspersed with sliver markings in strange and intriguing patterns. Scales and talons grew from his hands and feet.  His figure became hourglass as he turned female, his clothes becoming a pleasant yellow maid uniform, hand-crafted, with all sorts of intricate and unique patterns in the frills.  A pair of black wings grew from her back, and her mouth stretched into a pointed beak, her ears and nose shrinking back.  Her booth vanished, as Rasha, crow goddess of creativity took to the skies, seeking out humans to inspire.<br />
<br />
‘Excellent!’  Tomoyo thought to herself.  ‘That checks off the last of the ‘Must-haves.’  Not only that, but we’re at 47 anthros created, a mere three from reaching the next upgrade for the gun! Now for some minor goddess, and maybe a few mortal maid worshippers, then we-’<br />
<br />
The gun gave off a harsh buzzing sound as a giant red X appeared on the hud, followed by a message:<br />
<br />
“Due to an unexpected issue, all units of our Furry Transformation Ray Gun product, in each universe it has been released in, have been granted a free update. This update features a new “ID lock” to the Security Options menu, unlocking that as well if it has not already been unlocked. Additional miscellaneous safety measures have also received updates.<br />
<br />
“The ID Lock is “On” by default, and can be switched off with the entry of a password, exclusively by the product’s owner. If the owner wishes for only a select set of individuals to use the gun, they may add each individual&#39;s name to the ID Lock ‘permitted’ list. We have have automatically added the names of any individuals currently given explicit permission to use the product by its owner to the list with the update.<br />
<br />
“This feature, and all others under the Security Options menu, can be altered only by the product’s designated owner. Even if the ID lock is off, or an individual on the permitted list attempts to change these settings, they will not respond.<br />
<br />
“As a safety measure, the ID lock will automatically release, regardless of holder, if the product is used with the intent to avert clear and immediate peril to life or limb, whether it is the life of the holder, the target, or another individual. The lock will re-activate once the danger has passed.<br />
<br />
“Stay safe, and have a nice day.”<br />
<br />
Well, Tomoyo certainly hadn’t anticipated something like this, even with all her power.  For all she could do in this universe, it seemed there were still other universes and timelines out there, and the makers of the gun must have altered their policy based on the happenings in another world.  How frustrating.<br />
<br />
‘At least I hit all the important stuff,’ she thought.  ‘Perhaps I’ll be able to persuade Curt-Dono to let me use it just a little more…  Or maybe I should use this time to take a break, and catch up with mother…’</p>
