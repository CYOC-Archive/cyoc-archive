<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chris slowly woke to his mother calling him. &quot;Get up Chris! Breakfast is ready! You're going to miss breakfast if you don't get up!&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris groaned. His mother always yelled at him to get up for breakfast. Though he noticed a change in her voice. It wasn't the demanding voice she had always used and she didn't threaten to paddle his ass if he didn't get up. It wasn't like her. He reached a hand up to his face and that's when he felt something weird. As he lifted his arm up he felt fabric move across his legs. He knew that it wasn't his sheets as the fabric felt smoother. Plus there was unfamiliar weight on his chest that pulled sightly as he raised his arm.<br />
<br />
Chris opened his eyes and quickly sat up. As he did his hair swung into view. There was definitely something wrong. His hair wasn't long enough to swing into view. He looked down and saw that he was wearing a pink shirt. He didn't wear any pink as that was a girl's color. There were two mounds in the shirt and he threw the covers off of his lower half revealing that he was wearing a pink nightgown. He noticed that his arms, hands, legs, and feet where slimmer than they should be. He lifted the hem of the nightgown and saw that he was wearing pink cotton panties. There was no bulge in the front and he reached down to between his legs. To his surprise he felt something he shouldn't have. &quot;What the hell?!&quot; he yelled.<br />
<br />
Soon after his outburst he heard his mother say &quot;Chris, I'm coming in.&quot; He knew that he was in trouble for swearing. He couldn't let his mother see him like this so he quickly laid back down and pulled the covers back over him covering his head. He knew that it was in vain since his mother would yank the covers off. Instead of doing that she said &quot;You must be confused right now and hungry. Come down to breakfast and I'll explain. There's a robe on your computer chair and slippers by your bed.&quot; She left without another word or doing anything.<br />
<br />
Chris wasn't sure how to respond but he was hungry so he got up. He slipped his feet into the fuzzy pink slippers and put on the pink robe. As he headed down to the kitchen for breakfast he wondered how this had happened. Maybe he was still asleep and dreaming. That had to be it. This was a dream. At the bottom of the stairs he concentrated on floating a little off the ground which he had done many times in his dreams. Unfortunately he didn't float like he was supposed to if this was a dream. The only conclusion he could come up with was that this was real.<br />
<br />
As he entered the kitchen he saw his mother feeding his baby brother, his father reading the paper while eating, and his seven year old sister eating her breakfast and staring at him. He sat down and started eating his breakfast. After a few moments his mother broke the silence by saying &quot;You look pretty as a girl Chris.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;H-how did I become a g-girl?&quot; Chris asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You wanted a new life&quot; his father said. &quot;We were able to give you one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I didn't want to be a girl!&quot; Chris said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you had told the people at New Life Technologies that you didn't care what your new life was as long as you weren't yourself&quot; his mother said.<br />
<br />
&quot;We knew that you weren't happy with your life but we didn't know you were that unhappy&quot; his father said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wanted out of this family!&quot; Chris said. &quot;You've treated me like dirt all my life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We know&quot; his mother said quietly. &quot;We went overboard on the discipline trying to make you a good person. We didn't know that too much discipline could be detrimental. We paid for your new life and the people at New Life Technologies said that you should give being a girl a chance. If you want they will change you back or into anything you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I want to be changed again&quot; Chris said. &quot;I don't want to be a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Give it a chance&quot; his mother pleaded. &quot;Stay a girl for the summer. Then if you still want to change you can. Will you do that for us?&quot;<br />
<br />
She had a sad look on her face that Chris could never say no to. &quot;Alright&quot; he said with a sigh. &quot;I'll stay a girl for the summer. Though I'll want to transform again at the end of summer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll see if you change your mind&quot; his mother said. &quot;Today though I'm taking you to get a manicure and pedicure. Finish your breakfast and then I'll help you with your clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Have I been asleep since yesterday?&quot; Chris asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes&quot; his mother said. &quot;Don't worry. They fixed it so you wouldn't need to go to the bathroom until a couple hours after you woke up.&quot;<br />
<br />
This gave Chris some comfort. He had been afraid that he had accidents while he slept. He finished his breakfast and went back up to his room.</p>
