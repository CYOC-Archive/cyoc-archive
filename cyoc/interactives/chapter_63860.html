<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>Jen was still gazing at her reflection when a knock at the door broke her concentration. Turning, she saw 
her mothers head peeking into the room. "Time for bed honey. School tomorrow." Jen looked at the clock, and 
saw that it was past 10 already. Where had the hours gone? <i>Guess I lost track of time with all this messing 
around</i>. Jen turned back to face the door. "Alright mom just gimme a few minutes to get ready." Jen's 
mother smiled indulgently, as if to say <i>I've heard that one before</i>, before turning and walking to the 
bathroom. Jen sighed, and reluctantly began clearing the items off her bed. <i>At least mom still didn't 
notice any changes in how I look. Guess I'll just have to pick it up tomorrow </i>. Or maybe not. As Jen's 
hand touched the watch, she suddenly felt the urge for one last experiment before the night ended. Quickly 
grabbing the manual, she flipped hastily to the correct page and read: 
<br />
<blockquote>The Wonder Watch<br />
The Wonder Watch is meant to allow its user to precisely control the world around them through advanced 
hypnosis. Used in the same manner as any other hypnosis aid, the user need only hypnotize any person to gain 
complete control over both mind and body. To do so simply wave the watch in front of the desired targets eyes 
to induce a trance like state. After, that, exerting control over the targets mind and body is simple. Just 
hypnotize them into repeating a hypnotic suggestion about themselves. The statement should be in the first 
person i.e. "I am ...". As soon as the words are said, the changes will begin. Be warned that hypnotizing more 
than one person at a time is not recommended. Also, unless specifically ordered not to, the target will 
remember both the changes made and who caused them for a short period of time until the reality altering 
protection spells placed on all Spells R' Us products have time to take effect. This can of course be very 
inconvenient, so it is recommended that you plan your hypnotic suggestions wisely.</blockquote>
<br />
<p>It sounded simple enough, and Jen decided better now than never. Her siblings were all probably asleep by 
now, and she guessed the woman who used to be her father was in her parent's bedroom. That left just her mom, 
still busy in the bathroom down the hall. Watch in hand, Jen crept stealthily down the hall until she was 
right outside the bathroom. Right as she reached the open door Jen's mother finished washing her hands, turned 
toward the door, and spotted her daughter. Jen's resolve almost faltered right then, but deciding she'd come 
too far to turn back, she smiled nervously and tried to act like nothing was wrong. Her mother smiled back, 
her brow furrowed quizzically as she picked up on the fact that something was not quite right. However, never 
once did the thought of imminent magical entrapment cross her mind, and thus Jen had no trouble bringing the 
watch to eye level and starting the slow rhythm of back and forth swings to bring her mother under the watch's 
spell. As it swayed to and fro, all expression left her mother's face and she became completely still.
<br />
<p>Jen hadn't realized she had been holding her breath until her lungs began screaming at her. Heaving a sigh 
of relief, Jen put her plan into action. She'd considered a number of options on the walk down the hall, from 
adding another sibling to the family to making her mom speak only pig latin, but she had finally settled 
finishing what she had started earlier. Jen chose her words carefully before saying "Repeat after me: 'I am 
now Jen's father. I will become male and forget ever being female. No one except Jen will remember me being 
anything other than Jen's father.'" Once her mother had finished repeating her command, Jen hid the watch 
behind her back and waited, moving closer to the doorway in case she suddenly needed to make a run for it. 
<br />
<p>Jen's mother snapped out of her stupor abruptly, and began looking around in confusion. Spotting Jen, she 
smiled again and said "Something the matter honey?" Jen didn't answer because at that second, the first signs 
of physical change appeared. As Jen watched her mother's face for signs that she noticed anything amiss, Jen 
saw a coating of stubble appear on her mother's face. Looking down Jen noticed that more hair was sprouting on 
her mother's legs, which looked thicker than she remembered. When she went to look back up at her mother's 
face, Jen found her mother now reached her nose, where before she had been only a little past her chin. As she 
watched, her mother's head rose until they were eye to eye, and then for the first time in four years, Jen 
actually had to crane her neck to look up at her mother's face. As Jen found herself level with her mother's 
chest, she saw that she had grown out as well as up. Her mother's shoulder's had broadened, and her frame had 
a good deal more bulk to it, some of it fat but there was some muscle too. Gone were and sign of feminine 
breasts and when Jen looked back up at the face above her, she saw a square jawed visage topped with close 
cropped salt and pepper hair. Last of all her nightgown blurred and became a pair of blue sweatpants and a 
white t-shirt.
<br />
<p>When her mother spoke again, it was in a deep baritone register. "I said something wrong honey?" Jen 
managed a weak smile and said "Nope. Nothing." Her new father, seemingly unaware of anything that had 
transpired, smiled disbelievingly, but only said "Ok, well don't stay up much later" before kissing her on the 
forehead and walking out of the bathroom. Elated at her success, but deciding she had pressed her luck enough 
for one day, Jen decided to follow her dad's advice.</p>
