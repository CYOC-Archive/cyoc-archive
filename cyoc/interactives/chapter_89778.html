<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jamie advanced into the third room. This whole experience was just crazy to her, she couldn&#39;t believe that over the last few hours she had become both a mouse and a turtle. Jamie found the lack of control she had over her body scary but knew she had to press on in order to save Brad. The new room resembled a long hallway which Jamie could not see the end of. Every so often in the floor were gaps roughly one foot long which Jamie looked into, they appeared to be bottomless pits. &quot;Well I better get a move on&quot; Jamie said walking down the hallway being extra careful to mind the gaps. After ten minutes of walking Jamie notice the gaps starting to become slightly larger and after and additional ten minutes of progression the gaps had become two feet long. Jamie made a short jump across a gap and felt a weird feeling in her feet when she made the landing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ouch&quot; Jamie yelled as she inspected her feet. In the last few minutes Jamie had felt her shoes get much tighter until the point were they almost felt like they were going to burst out. Jamie removed her shoes and revealed the her feet had in fact grown at least three sizes. Even though she saw this coming Jamie was still upset. &quot;Oh no. I don&#39;t want to be an animal again&quot; she said as she wiggled her enlarged toes. Jamie looked up as continued down the hallway.<br />
<br />
As Jamie walked down the hallway she struggled moving with her new feet. She looked down at them &quot;they&#39;re getting bigger&quot; at this point they grown and additional two sizes. The gaps in the floor had also grown and were now at roughly three feet each. Jamie had to get running starts for most of them with her awkward feet. Jamie was also starting to feel her overalls getting tighter on her but didn&#39;t pay it that much attention.<br />
<br />
After another half an hour Jamie&#39;s overalls were so tight on her she couldn&#39;t take it.&quot;What&#39;s happening to me?&quot; she said as she unbuckled her straps and discarded her overalls on the ground. Jamie looked down and saw that her legs and hips had grown beyond human size and her feet were now lengthened. Traces of brown fur were also spreading and the beginning of a tail was starting to appear above her butt. Jamie already knew what she was becoming but grabbed for her make-up mirror anyway for a quick inspection. From above the waist Jamie still look completely human wearing her tee-shirt but from waist below she was an naked animal covered in fur. &quot;I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m becoming a kangaroo&quot; Jamie continued down the hallway.<br />
<br />
As Jamie progressed the gaps became wider once again now extending four feet. Jamie found it much easier to hop across gaps with her new legs and soon found herself hopping instead of walking as well. &quot;This is actually kind of fun&quot; Jamie laughed. She was so busy hoping about she didn&#39;t notice the changes her body had made over they last hour. Jamie checked her make-up mirror once again and saw that the brown fur had reached up and covered the top half of her body. Jamie also noticed that her nose had become black and snout like while her ears had become pointed and migrated to the top of her head. Jamie&#39;s hands also now resemble paws and her tail grew an additional two feet. Jamie noticed that she now had feelings in her tail and the nerves were installed as she gave it a small shake marveling at how she could control it. &quot;This is so wild&quot; Jamie said looking behind her.<br />
<br />
It only took another ten minutes for Jamie&#39;s transformation to complete. Her tail grew another foot long and her legs filled out to full size kangaroo legs. Jamie also noticed a flap of skin on her belly and played with it revealing it to be a pouch. &quot;Wow I even have a pouch&quot; Jamie said as she tossed her make-up mirror in there &quot;Might as well improvise&quot;. Jamie hopped down the hallway and it wasn&#39;t too long until she could finally see the key in sight. The last few gaps reached almost six feet long but Jamie clear them no problem with her powerful hops. She reached the key and grabbed it with her paw and hopped on the spot with glee. &quot;Yes three down two to go!&quot; Jamie said as a bright light engulfed her and brought her back to the main hallway.<br />
<br />
Jamie looked over herself and saw that not only she was returned to human but her discarded shoes and overalls were back on her as well. &quot;Don&#39;t worry Brad&quot; she said as she put in the third key. &quot;We are almost done.&quot;</p>
