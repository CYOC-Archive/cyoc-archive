<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was around 8:30 when the girls finished trick or treating. Laughing with joy the group ran into the living room to empty their pillow cases that were overflowing with candy.<br />
<br />
The girls happily began to go through their candy Kellie and Judy looked on. &quot;Okay girls,&quot; Judy said. &quot;Let&#39;s make sure none of the candy has been tampered with. After that, Sammy and Jacob I&#39;m going to bring you back home.&quot; &quot;Same holds true for you and Mary,&quot; Kellie said looking at her daughters. &quot;If Claudia is sick we should probably hold off on the sleepover this weekend.&quot; The girls nodded glumly as Kellie and Judy began to help Tricia and Karen look over their candy.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are we going to do now,&quot; Samantha asked. &quot;Our moms are going to take us home if we don&#39;t think of something quick.&quot; Katie turned to Claudia. &quot;Claudia you&#39;ve already thought of something haven&#39;t you.&quot; Claudia nodded. &quot;Follow me into the kitchen so we can talk privately.&quot;<br />
<br />
The five ten year olds slowly crept into the kitchen making sure no one saw where they were going. When they were finally alone Claudia spoke. &quot;Okay my idea is this,&quot; Claudia said. &quot;Kellie and Judy aren&#39;t going to let us go out and Tricia is stuck at seven until at least tomorrow. I think we should make Kellie and Judy seven. This way they&#39;ll think they just got back from trick or treating and are having a sleepover.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a good idea but their&#39;s one problem,&quot; Mika said. &quot;Whose going to watch a group of seven year olds. We can&#39;t leave them here by themselves.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I can help out on that,&quot; Sammy said. &quot;When we grow back up, whether it&#39;s high school or college me and Jake will babysit.&quot;<br />
<br />
The girls looked at Sammy. &quot;Are you sure Sammy,&quot; Mika said. &quot;I mean it would be just you and Jake with a bunch of.....oh i get it.&quot; &quot;What,&quot; Katie asked. &quot;What am I missing?&quot; Claudia shook her head and sighed. &quot;Sammy here is going to put the kids to bed and hook up with Jake.&quot; Sammy tried to suppress a grin. &quot;I never said that,&quot; she said. &quot;I jus think it would make the most sense. When my mom becomes a kid she&#39;s probably going to view me as on older sister. Plus I&#39;m not looking to hook up with anyone at the party, I&#39;ve already got Jake.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Samantha,&quot; Claudia said. &quot;If you an Jake hook up in my bed I&#39;m going to kill you.&quot; &quot;Come on Claudia,&quot; Sammy giggled. &quot;Your mind is always in the gutter. I won&#39;t hook up with Jake in your room. Besides that couch looks so much more comfortable.&quot;<br />
<br />
Claudia gritted her teeth and was about to say something before Mary interceded. &quot;Claudia,&quot; she said calmly. &quot;If Sammy doesn&#39;t watch them then were out of options. If we want to go out this is the only option we have.&quot; &quot;Fine,&quot; Claudia sighed. &quot;Just remember this is still my house. Don&#39;t mess it up.&quot; Sammy smiled and patted the ten year old girl on the head. &quot;Don&#39;t worry Claud,&quot; she said. &quot;I&#39;ll keep your house nice and clean. By the way anyone ever tell you your adorable when you look angry.&quot; Claudia could only snort.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay so what should we do go to high school or go to college,&quot; Mika asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well I think we should make our moms younger first,&quot; Mary said. &quot;Katie, Sammy, you going to be okay with this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Katie said. &quot;I haven&#39;t made my mom this young in a long time. We just need to be careful. What about you Sammy?&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha paused and looked towards the living room where the others were. &quot;I guess,&quot; she said. &quot;It&#39;s going to be weird though. A couple of months ago my mother was dead. Now I&#39;m about to turn her into a seven year old. It&#39;s going to be really weird watching her grow younger. I&#39;ve never seen any pictures of her when she was a kid, I&#39;m a little scared and a little curious.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright,&quot; Katie said. &quot;I guess this is it.&quot; Katie stared down at her ring apprehensively. Closing her eyes Katie made a wish for Kellie and Judy to become seven years old. The girls peaked into the living room out of view and watched as their mothers began the slow journey back to childhood.<br />
<br />
Kellie and Judy were both 34 years old. In this reality they had been friends since Samantha, Katie, and Mary Elise were in preschool. Both women shuddered as the spell began to take affect. Judy brushed her light brown hair out of her eyes and looked around. Judy went and checked to see if the door was open. Now 31 she quickly checked the windows to see if there was a draft.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you feel something,&quot; she asked. Kellie looked at Judy and nodded. &quot;Yeah,&quot; the now 30 year old woman said. &quot;That was weird is the window open.&quot; &quot;No,&quot; Judy said as she reentered her twenties. &quot;I checked the windows and the door, there&#39;s no draft.&quot; Judy walked over to the couch and took a seat as Kellie followed. Both women were now 28 and gazed down at seven year old Tricia and Karen.<br />
<br />
&quot;I miss going trick or treating,&quot; Judy said as she slipped to 27. &quot;I used to have such fun wheni was there age.&quot; &quot;Me too,&quot; Kellie said as she slipped to 26. The honey hair woman said as she brushed her bangs out of her eyes. &quot;You ever wish you could go back and relive your childhood for a night.&quot; She asked. Judy shrugged and looked at her friend. &quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; she shrugged as the two women became 25. &quot;It wasn&#39;t easy being a kid can you imagine becoming a kid again. Losing everything that made you an adult....being so small and innocent.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie shook her head. &quot;No but it would be fun for a night&quot; she said. &quot;I enjoyed my childhood.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not saying I didn&#39;t enjoy my childhood,&quot; Judy said as she became 24. &quot;I had a great childhood, but having to relive puberty...I think I&#39;ll pass.&quot;<br />
<br />
The women laughed and began to chat about their childhood as their regression continued. &quot;I&#39;m sure you were adorable as a kid,&quot; Kellie said as she reentered college becoming 22. &quot;Me,&quot; Judy exclaimed. &quot;Look at you I&#39;m sure the guys absolutely drooled over you with a body like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie and Judy continued to laugh and talk as they traveled backwards through college. Their curvy figures began to melt away as they reentered high school. Their c cup breasts slowly began to rise as they began to lose their fullness becoming perky. Both women&#39;s faces changed as the maturity the girls had grown accustomed to was replaced with delicate teenage features.<br />
<br />
Judy paused and looked at her friend. &quot;Kellie,&quot; she asked. &quot;Did you do something with your hair. You look years younger.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie looked at her friendl her eyes widening in surprise. &quot;I was going to say the same thing about you Judy,&quot; she said. &quot;You look like your old enough to be in college.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Katie what&#39;s going on,&quot; Sammy whispered. &quot;How come their noticing their changes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Katie exclaimed. &quot;The ring is affecting them differently for some reason.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think it&#39;s because of what happened to mom when you regressed a couple months ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened,&quot; Mika said. Katie sighed and quickly told the story of unbirthing her mother. &quot;So that first night you actually unmade your mom,&quot; Claudia exclaimed. Katie nodded. &quot;That got to be it,&quot; Claudia stated. &quot;What&#39;s it,&quot; Mika asked. &quot;When Kellie was unbirthed she had to be brought back by the ring, for all intents and purposes she was dead.....same as Samantha&#39;s mom. The ring must have a different affect on the dead.&quot;<br />
The girls now watched as Kellie and Judy left college and reentered high school.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god Kellie,&quot; Judy exclaimed clearing her throat. &quot;You look like a high school student.&quot; &quot;Me,&quot; Kellie stated. &quot;Look at you!&quot;<br />
<br />
The two girls ran to the hallway mirror in time to watch themselves go from 18 to 17. Both women now watched as their womanly features began to diminish. &quot;Look at us,&quot; Judy squeaked. &quot;Were kids.&quot; The girls continued to stare in the mirror as they began to shrink going from 17 to 16. Their curves were rapidly melting away as their breasts went from c cups to b cups.<br />
<br />
&quot;How is this happening,&quot; a 16 year old Kellie asked. Kellie winced at the sound of her voice, she couldn&#39;t believe how young she sounded. &quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Judy whispered as she held up her jeans. &quot;Maybe it has something to do with talking about our childhood.&quot; &quot;Well any IDEa on how to stop it,&quot; Kellie asked. The girls watched as they became 15 taking on a an innocent teenage appearance. &quot;I don&#39;t think we can stop this,&quot; Judy said. <br />
<br />
Kellie huffed and watched as the girls went form 15 to 14. Their breasts continued to diminish becoming small b cups. Both women had slightly annoyed looks on their face as they gazed at their dwindling teenage bodies. &quot;So what do we do now,&quot; Judy asked. Kellie shrugged and carefully begAn walking towards the stairs. &quot;I  don&#39;t think theirs anything to do except deal with it.&quot; She said . &quot;If were going to be kids we might as well make the most of it so come on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Where are we going,&quot; Judy whined as she became 13. Judy couldn&#39;t help but wince at the sound of her voice. She had that annoying teenage pitch in her voice. Kellie smiled as she kicked off her overly large boots. &quot;Let&#39;s go to Mika&#39;s room and find some fitting clothes,&quot; she answered. &quot;Our clothes are getting way to big. In a couple of minutes well probably shrink out of them.&quot; Judy looked at the honey haired 13 year old and sighed. She had to admit the girl was  right. Judy slipped off her boots and followed her friend upstairs in her overly large socks.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is crazy,&quot; Judy said as she shrunk to 12. Absentmindedly she grabbed her chest and winced, her once proud breasts had been reduced to a pair of small mounds. Looking up at Kellie she could see a now 12 year old Kellie&#39;s breasts were a little larger than hers. Childish feelings of self doubt began to drift into her mind, which she quickly shook off. &quot;Kellie wait up,&quot; she cried. &quot;My pants are too long I&#39;m having trouble walking.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie turned around and looked at her diminutive friend before looking at herself. Judy was a beautiful child with light brown hair and wide blue eyes. Judy was desperately trying to maintain her modesty in her overly large cloths. Looking at her own body she could see her clothes were now way too big for her as well. The pant legs now half covered her sock covered feet. Wiggling her toes she could see the socks were at least three sizes to big.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think we should leave our pants behind Judy,&quot; Kellie said as she became 11. &quot;Are you crazy,&quot; Judy yelled. &quot;I&#39;m not running around this house with no pants.&quot; &quot;Judy look at us were kids now we can&#39;t be older than 11.&quot; She said. &quot;Besides our sweaters pretty much cover us like dresses at this point.&quot; Kellie let go of her jeans and let them fall to the floor. Stepping out of her overly large jeans Kellie noticed her socks had slid half way down her feet. &quot;Come on Judy,&quot; she said as she kicked her socks off. &quot;Their only going to slow you down.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sighing Judy let her jeans fall to the floor as she became 10. Leaving her jeans and socks behind the two 10 year olds raced up the stairs and found Mika&#39;s room. &quot;What should we wear.&quot; Judy asked. &quot;Let&#39;s just put on some night gowns for now.&quot; Kellie said as the girls became nine. <br />
<br />
Kellie and Judy began to rummage through Mika&#39;s closet looking for something to wear. Although they were not watching their regression as closely as before a thought in the back of their mind told them they weren&#39;t done regressing yet. &quot;I think these will work,&quot; an eight year old Kellie said producing long night shirts from the closet. &quot;Which one do you want,&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve always liked blue,&quot; Judy said. The girls changed quickly and looked in the mirror. The regression had finally stopped at seven and the girls gazed at their youthful appearance. Judy was a skinny girl with long light brown hair that framed an innocent face with wide blue eyes. Kellie was a honey haired girl with a cherubic face. Both girls stared in awe of what had just happened to them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Next time let&#39;s not wish for our youth back,&quot; Judy said with a smile. Kellie returned her friends smile and gave her a quick hug. &quot;Sounds good,&quot; she answered. &quot;So now what do we do?&quot; &quot;Well there&#39;s a couple of girls our age downstairs with a ton of candy. We might as well have some fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two girls giggled and raced downstairs to join Tricia and Karen.</p>
