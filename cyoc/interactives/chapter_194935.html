<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kevin felt oddly relaxed as he passed into the commissary. The room was already somewhat busy and chattering filled the air. Some had already begun breakfast, taking advantage of the free vegetarian entrees. Others lounged, relaxing after a night of drinking. <br />
<br />
Head still pounding, Kevin eyed the buffet and contemplated grabbing something to help tame his lingering hangover. Crossing the room to approach the spread he paid little mind to his state of undress. His thoughts still felt sluggish and somehow his brain found it easy just to accept the freedom of partial nudity. <br />
<br />
As he reached the buffet, Kevin was struck with an oddly intoxicating array of scents. While the table featured the same offerings as before, for some reason today&#39;s spread seemed incredibly fragrant. The mellow smell of bananas seemed to pop with previously unnoticed floral notes. The mangos burst with saccerine scents. And the greens, a low, earthy aroma. His mouth began to water unbidden while his hands worked almost autonomously to fill his plat to the brim with the now delicious looking fruits and vegetables. <br />
<br />
Plate full and stomach now eager to dig in, he turned slightly from the buffet only to find himself face to face with a tall mirror affixed to the far wall. Forgetting the food for a moment, he paused.  While he would never have dreamed of wearing a Hawaiian shirt on the outside, for some reason the look gave him an unexpected confidence. Unbuttoned and worn with abandon he found it gave him a more relaxed vibe, not to mention the tasteful way it seemed to frame his toned form.  A toothy grin crossing his face. <br />
<br />
&quot;Damn, I make this shirt look good&quot; he said aloud with booming confidence. The room grew noticeably quieter as a few conversations paused and heads turned. A scarlet blush crossed Kevin&#39;s face as he realized just how loud he said that. A sense of confusion managed to push its way through his syrupy thoughts.  He&#39;d never been boastful before.... especially about his looks. Looking back up at himself, he again felt the same cocky confidence well up in him. He couldn&#39;t help but flash that toothy grin once more. <br />
<br />
Shaking his head a bit, he turned from the mirror. The confusion was back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do I feel so...cocky? And my looks...since when do I care so much?&quot; He thought as mental gears slowly turned. His attitude was changing, he was oddly hornier, and for some reason he couldn&#39;t stop thinking about Marcus. &quot;These changes...they&#39;re more than just physical.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lost in thought he hardly noticed as he set his plat down, joining two others at one of the commissary&#39;s many tables. <br />
<br />
&quot;Someone had a good night&quot; came a voice, breaking Kevin from his thoughts. <br />
<br />
Looking up, Kevin matched the voice to its source.<br />
<br />
&quot;Names Kyle&quot; A light furred hand suddenly appeared in Kevin&#39;s face. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...Kevin&quot; He replied, grasping the hand and giving it a quick shake.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, I couldn&#39;t help but notice you and Marcus disappeared last night. Do anything...fun?&quot; Kyle said with a grin, flashing his own set of now well-developed incisors. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck of bro, we just hung out and shot the shit&quot; A blush hit Kevins face, followed quickly by a slight stiffening of his cock as he remembered Marcus&#39;s tight muscles. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sure......&quot;  Kyle replied, rubbing his hand through his hair. &quot;Just thought you might have been up to something a little more...interesting.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kevin tried his best to ignore the subject while simultaneously working to make it seem like he didn&#39;t care. He wasn&#39;t gay after all. He had Samantha and she was a fucking 10/10. Marcus was just...temporary. Guys have needs, the past few days had been stressful, and with no girls around he had to find some way to blow off steam.  Besides, Last night, well, he was just drunk. And this morning, that was just a favor. The memory of Marcus&#39;s face twisted in orgasmic bliss as his hot, salty load filled Kevin&#39;s mouth flashed through his mind. His cock was more than just a little bit puffed up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Earth to Kevin&quot; Came Kyle&#39;s voice once more. Kevin couldn&#39;t help but notice a slight hint of an Australian accent flowing through the words. Something about the way he spoke sent even more blood to Kevin&#39;s cock. The blush deepened and Kevin scooted his chain in slightly to make sure the others didn&#39;t notice his erection. <br />
<br />
As his cock pulsed, Kevin felt his eyes begin to study Kyle&#39;s form. Clad only in a floral bathing suit and a shark tooth necklace, Kyle&#39;s torso was on full display. While his build had nothing on Marcus&#39; Kevin couldn&#39;t help but appreciate the hint of muscle that seemed to be developing on Kyle&#39;s body. He had the look of someone who had only recently gotten into body building but could have an excellent set of muscles in a year or two. Kevin&#39;s eyes strayed to his hair. Ear length and somewhat wavy it was mostly brown but seemed to be developing a hint of blond just at the tips.  <br />
<br />
Seeing this, Kevin remebered he had briefly spoken to Kyle on the first night.   The Kyle he remembered, however,  was certainly different than the person who sat before him. Reserved, noticeably shorter, and skinny as a bean pole *that* Kyle was honestly kind of a nerd. And his hair, hadn&#39;t it been only about an inch long? And there certainly wasn&#39;t any blond in it before. Kevin remembered that the conversation they&#39;d shared that first night had been brief, and awkward. The flow stalled out because Kyle didn&#39;t know how to talk about anything besides the weather and the economy. Dude was boring.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kyle seems  a bit more confident&quot; Kevin thought &quot;Again, these changes definitely seem to be more than physical&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;*Earth* to Kevin&quot; Kyle repeated, evidently annoyed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dude&#39;s hung over, give him a break and chill out&quot; Came the voice of the table&#39;s other occupant. While Kyle seemed on the cusp of being &#39;muscular&#39; this guy certainly had spent some time in the gym. His torso was tall, stacked and masculine. Arms bulged and his pecs seemed to heave with each word, their girth accentuated by the thick chest hair (fur?) that graced his chest. <br />
<br />
Kevin noticed that he too was bottomless, wearing only a drug rug. Definitely not the type of clothes you&#39;d expect to see on such a guy.  Looking to his face, Kevin&#39;s eyes couldn&#39;t help but trace his jaw line which was a bit thinner in a way that belied the overall masculinity of the man&#39;s torso. This out of place feminine note was accented by the green tips that graced his short blond hair. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yea, yea Sam, whatever. Dude can zone out, hell If I care&quot; Kyle replied &quot;Anyway, as I was saying before &#39;Hawaii 5-O&#39; here showed up, I was looking over the block chain last night and found that if you click on each image stamped into the chain a bio for each character pops up. I certainly didn&#39;t write mine, but I have to say it matches my character&#39;s aesthetic perfectly.&quot; Kyle flashed a somewhat cocky grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ya don&#39;t say&quot; Same replied as he looked down at his phone and clicked a few times &quot;Let&#39;s see here...got it...Okay I&#39;ve pulled yours up.&quot; The face that appeared on Sam&#39;s phone was a somewhat dumb looking smiling ape clade in Kyle&#39;s flower swimsuit and shark tooth necklace. The figure had long, flowing blond surfer hair and was practically stacked with muscle. A body that was a far cry from both Kyle&#39;s original diminutive form and even his current more muscled body. Completing the look, the character was holding a surfboard. &quot;It says Name: Kai.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam looked up a slight grin of amusement crossing his face. Kyle flashed his increasingly common grin once more. <br />
<br />
&quot;Bio: Gregarious and chipper. Kai is very sexually forward and all too willing to chat about his and others sex lives. Sexually he is bisexual and certainly willing to hop into bed with whomever propositions him. He doesn&#39;t discriminate, he just likes sex.  As his look suggests, Kai loves surfing and the beach and wants nothing more than to spend time in the water. He spent much of his life in Australian and has an accent to match.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Australian mate!&quot; Kyle said with amusement, laying on the accent extra thick. &quot;Heh, its super weird because I&#39;m nothing like &#39;Kai&#39; but for some reason I&#39;m finding myself increasingly thinking how I&#39;d expect him to.<br />
<br />
&quot;Same&quot; Replied Sam &quot;I&#39;ve noticed myself feeling much more relaxed and just...chill lately...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam pulled up his character, flashing it to the others. <br />
<br />
 The ape was lithe and thin and almost twinkish clad only in the thick drugrug they saw on Sam. His general vibe was much more feminine than Sam&#39;s and his head was topped by short bright green hair.  A far cry from Sam, yet a detail they could begin to see manifesting in the green tips that he now sported. The ape appeared to be a total stoner, a join hanging loosely from his lips and his eyes lazy and bloodshot. <br />
<br />
Kyle let out a loud laugh that bled into an apelike shriek. &quot;Dude you&#39;re gonna become a total stoner twink!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck off&quot; Sam said forcefully, his mellowness fading in order to defend his masculinity. &quot;There&#39;s no way I&#39;m becoming this twink ass monkey. I&#39;ve worked too hard on my muscles to let them melt away in favor of ...that. besides, I&#39;ve never touched marijuana and I&#39;m definitely not some gay twink.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude settle down, it was just a joke you don&#39;t need to get so defensive.&quot; Kyle said, his grin still just as big &quot;Though...if you do give into the twink stoner life....I wouldn&#39;t mind playing with that tight ass I know you&#39;ll have&quot; Kyle shot Sam a suggestive wink <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, I&#39;ve had just about enough of you&quot; Sam said, standing with a huff. &quot;Kyle, you can fuck right off&quot;  <br />
<br />
Sam turned and stomped out of the room. &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can&#39;t wait for the dude to loosen up, I&#39;m gonna much prefer &#39;stoner&#39; same. Dudes gonna have such a nice tight ass...&quot; Kyle said to Kevin &quot;So anyway &#39;Kev,&#39; have you looked at what your bio says? Anything juicy?&quot;<br />
<br />
Having just learned about the &#39;bio&#39; feature of his NFT Kevin was certainly in the dark about what kind of personality traits he&#39;d inherit from &#39;Kev.&#39; <br />
<br />
His changing sexuality once again crossed his mind, but he quickly brushed it off. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...I haven&#39;t. Just learned about this frankly...&quot; He replied<br />
<br />
&quot;Well dude&quot; Kyle said, sliding his chair up next to Kevin&#39;s and placing his arm around Kevin&#39;s shoulder. &quot;No time like the present!&quot;<br />
<br />
A shot of nervous fear crossed through Kevin&#39;s chest, mixed with an odd arousal at Kyles proximity. His erection had yet to fade and the form arm on his shoulders wasn&#39;t doing it any favors. <br />
<br />
Taking out his phone, he accessed the blockchain and scrolled to his NFT. Clicking it, he pulled up the bio.</p>
