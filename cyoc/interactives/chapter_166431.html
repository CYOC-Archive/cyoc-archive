<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tim was as hard as he could be, which admittedly wasn&#39;t very much. His cock stood out at a little over three inches long and 2 inches thick. Barely bigger than his pinky finger. Richard saw it too, his embarrassingly small head barely pushing out past his untrimmed bush.  <br />
<br />
Tim was feeling his stolen chest with one hand while working the monitor with the other, barely aware that he was sporting a hard on. &quot;If this man&#39;s chest was sitting in the reject bin, maybe the rest of him is here too...&quot; Tim murmured as he swiped through the screens. <br />
<br />
There they were, sitting in the exact same spot on top of the heap, two long muscular legs with the same tan. Tim didn&#39;t even notice the thin calves, let alone cared. This man&#39;s legs were just as perfect as his torso in Tim&#39;s eyes. Tim quickly switched the settings for multiple swaps as he selected the legs and went looking for the rest of his new body.<br />
<br />
One by one he found each part. Muscular legs, check. Massive arms with bulging shoulders, biceps, triceps, and forearms, check. Thick neck with a movie star face and a full head of hair (unlike friar Tim&#39;s hair line which was massively receding), check. And lastly, an ass to die for. Tight yet toned, Tim could also see the huge balls and fleshy tube lying under his dream groin, check. <br />
<br />
Richard watched as Tim&#39;s little cock twitched. The thought of taking these body parts as his own had pushed Tim&#39;s cock over the edge. He came hands free as he pressed the swap button. Just as quickly as the first time, the blades dropped and separated Tim&#39;s limbs from his torso. <br />
<br />
The exception this time was the added blade that separated Tim&#39;s face from his skull. Before he knew it, the light had receded, leaving team with his nearly acquired parts. <br />
<br />
Tim couldn&#39;t believe it as he looked in the mirror. He had the body of a hunky 25 year old stud. He admired his thick quads, tight ass, bulging biceps, and full head of hair, before his cock and trimmed groin had pulled him out of his trance. <br />
<br />
Half hard, he reached down with one of his massive hands to grab his growing cock. The fleshy tube would have looked out of place in his old puny hand, but his proportions were now perfect as he brought himself to full attention. Tim stood in awe at the size of his new cock. At least nine inches long and 7 inches thick, he cock was easily 50 times the mass of his old one. Tim didn&#39;t understand why anyone would risk giving up a body like this, but he didn&#39;t care as began to jack off right then and there reveling in his luck.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Meanwhile Richard had watched the entire transformation. He had no choice but to keep his eyes glued to the monitor as the robot tried to fix the error. Watching Tim select his body parts piece by piece filled him with rage. And last of all, watching Tim grip his cock like he owned it was enough to make him cry.<br />
<br />
The robot chimed in &quot;Good new Sir, our system has located each of your parts and we are working to retrieve them immediately.&quot; <br />
<br />
Richard thought to himself &quot;What are they talking about. Of course they can locate my parts, they&#39;re attached to Tim!!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
He looked on, expecting the arms to drop at any moment and pull his parts off of Tim&#39;s body. Except they didn&#39;t. The arms dropped but they were off in the distance. Tim was oblivious to the movement as he continued to masturbate with his new cock. Being a 1 pump chump, he&#39;d never been able to last this long before and wasn&#39;t even close to cumming yet.<br />
<br />
The camera angle changed as Richard watched the arms reach into each bin. &quot;Wtf are they doing. My body isn&#39;t even in there anymore!&quot;<br />
<br />
The first piece one of the arms pulled out was a pasty, fat, pathetically short torso. The second arm pulled out pasty, skinny, underdeveloped legs. &quot;Oh no&quot; Richard thought. Tim had picked only Richard&#39;s body parts from the bins. After Tim swapped, the blades placed each of Tim&#39;s body parts exactly where his had been. &quot;Oh god no, there must be lag between the systems.&quot; His robot had failed to realize that a swap had taken place. Reaching into each bin, the system believes it is actually retrieving Richard&#39;s body.<br />
<br />
Before he knew it, Richard was again bathed in the red light. He tried to fight it as Tim&#39;s body parts were lowered in front of his face, but it was no use. The blades attached each part exactly as they should be. And just as quickly as it had started, the light subsided and Richard was once again standing. <br />
<br />
The robot chimed in, &quot;I&#39;m happy to inform you sir that we have retrieved your body! We&#39;re sorry about this whole ordeal, but I bet you are relieve to be standing in place again. I regret to inform you that our system does have limitations. Whenever an unauthorized swap takes place, the red light and unique blades create a bond between your limbs that make a second swap impossible. Once again, we are thrilled that were able to restore you to your original form and apologize for the mishap. Good day!&quot;<br />
<br />
Richard could have died right there. The system thought it actually gave him his body back, it couldn&#39;t tell that he was nearly a foot shorter and 100 lbs lighter! And worst of all it&#39;s permanent! Richard looked down to take inventory. His fat stomach, pencil thin arms and legs, and hairy crotch. His new cock was overcome with emotion, just happy to be attached to a full body again, as his knees buckled and his cock twitched. He produced the most pathetic load he&#39;d ever seen, that settled in his cum stained crotch, as he fell on the floor.</p>
