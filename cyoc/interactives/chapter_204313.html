<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Right? Or is that just a movie thing? Girls get knocked up all the time in those. With how little either of us knew about the process, despite being present for a bunch of required sex ed classes, we were sure to screw this.<br />
<br />
At the same time, we both had that promise and nothing could shake that. Still, the responsibility in front of us was manyfold even though the whole thing is simple. People had been doing this for untold thousands of years, possibility millions depending on who you ask. <br />
<br />
I don’t know but, sitting there and physically being like that, I appreciated Ty’s reluctance, reticence, and forethought to not just jump into this. Meanwhile, I wanted to jump his bones. I already started the engine, cleared it, gave it a few good revs, and it was raring to go. <br />
<br />
As far as I could tell, at least. I was a new owner and it all took some intuiting. Some chick with decades of living with this sort of thing under her belt would probably have better control. But that’s where I was after whatever voodoo occurred to me and the other guy by the billiards table. <br />
<br />
I kinda wanted to make sure he was all right as a goth girl and commiserate. See what was up. We just talked in passing around the dorm, but I felt like we had a good rapport. I know he did a lot of thinking and walking and was some sort of artist who put too much worry and thought into stuff instead of actually doing it. I could understand, as it was like I was in the same spot now. <br />
<br />
As Ty talked to himself and tried to work through everything, I leaned over and placed my big, soft butt on his lap. I know he was a gifted man. He should’ve been the cock of a walk in high school. But the ladies never figured it out and they only talked about other guys. Maybe he could’ve worn tight pants every so often? <br />
<br />
The sensation was unusual but not bad. I could only describe it as a rising, warm sausage with a landing pad. Alarm hit me first. This was the kind of stuff which the locker room and your grandfathers told you was wrong. A part of me was shocked, startled, and wanted to escape. <br />
<br />
In the same moment, there were a whole lot more parts realizing “this is fun!” and that now I got the right slot to go with that adapter. Rubbing through our clothes, with him in thick sweatpants and me in a curtain-like skirt, took a bit of finesse. I had to push and grope, hunting for his warm flesh. He definitely seemed to feel my crotch. It was like a mouth I couldn’t control, hungrily salivating. And it felt like it was whispering ideas in my ear and each of them sounded great.<br />
<br />
Feeling mounting frustration that rubbing against one another through our clothes wasn’t enough, I followed an impetuous notion and squeezed a hand under Ty’s boxers. He nearly screamed while squirming. I stroked that flaming torch.<br />
<br />
I reminded the rebellious parts of me that a woman’s long, soft fingers were rubbing along that expanse of meat. But before they could properly travel from sweaty base to quivering tip, Ty slipped away, “I’m about to pop off, please please. Oh jeez, slow down! I can’t take it.”<br />
<br />
Begrudgingly, I let him go, as he scrambled with his pants nearly off to the other side of the bed and caught his breath. Softly, he said, “Holy crap, Matt.” It sounded between breaths like he had more to say about that but he ultimately just let those words stand.<br />
<br />
I had plenty to say. “I’m not really a Matt anymore. More of a Megan. Courtney is a cute name too. But not a Matt. Look…”<br />
<br />
The ideas kept coming as I worked to remove this sort of skirt. I found a slight zipper and several buttons towards the front. With some finagling, I soon stepped out of it and laid it against the end of the bed. Underneath, were a pair of lacy blue panties. They were simple to pull down. The color didn’t do much to hide a darkened oval developing at the bottom. I could feel it more than I could see it and when I had them off, I spun them around on a finger and flung them against the bed. <br />
<br />
He could probably see better than I could with my jutting chest. I widened the gap between my legs and let my fingers roam down there. Stretching and bending, I glimpsed the slope of my new sex. Instead of the decorative shrub around the tree and hills, so to speak, this felt like an alluring track leading out of sight with a hint of dark shine. I wanted to spread the folds and feel what it did. <br />
<br />
Ty’s mouth dangled and it didn’t look like he was going to pick it up anytime soon. For the next step, I reached down to the hem of my ribbed, gray sweater, slipped my narrow arms through the sleeves, and worked it up and over. Ty sat up with his arms out, as though grasping for how to help me. He almost retreated when his hands accidentally grabbed my soft shoulders. But he wasn’t getting away that easily.<br />
<br />
I clung to his arms like a trap when the sweater fell away. I guided his hands up to the pink, sleek contours of my bra. Slipping them out of the cups brought an imbalanced, added weight on my shoulders and pits. They weren’t quite as heavy as I was expecting though and squeezed and shifted, not so much like dough, as like a set of those premium memory foam pillows just coming out of the dryer. My aunt had those. In both respects.<br />
<br />
And I was giving Ty a hands-on demonstration. The bra otherwise was hanging around for the moment because I didn’t see any clasp in the front. It didn’t take him long to find my big hard nipples and an expanse of sensitive flesh around them. At my encouragement, he not only tweaked them but squeezed and started to play with them with his tongue. That got him going but didn’t seem quite on the same level for me. It was good, kind of ticklish, warm, and made me squirm but not as intense as what I indulged in by myself<br />
<br />
However, it helped Ty cross a boundary. He had been, no pun intended, pussy footing it a little. After that, he took charge. A certain hesitancy still lingered in his eyes, but he took a deep breath, swallowed, and announced, “I take full responsibility. Let’s do it.”<br />
<br />
I couldn’t blame him. The possibilities of a tit job along with going down on him still felt like an obstacle tinged with alarming tones. I was prepared, but still feared I might hesitate. As his pants and boxers came off and we stood before each other without anything holding us back down there, everything but that moment faded away. <br />
<br />
Kissing him jolted me for before some programming kicked in that his scent was what this body wanted. His hot, fiery length at the center of everything teased my soft legs and eased gently against my flesh. Just as I could imagine it spreading the folds and sinking inside me, it retreated.<br />
<br />
It didn’t take me long to realize that something was happening to Ty and that something was the same thing that happened to me. His uneven blonde hair, with more on the left side, erupted into shoulder spanning bunches thicker than mine. His face smoothed out and took on daintier features with a lean brush mark eyebrow instead of his bushy ones. His cheekbones looked especially prominent with decorations of red blush and light freckles. He managed one last, “Dude…”, as his voice shot up to girlish heights.<br />
<br />
Since his pants were off, I had a really good look as erect cock slid and shrunk against the developing folds between his legs, punctuated by a bold, puffy accent of bright blonde pubic hair. She had especially wide plush hips with legs that almost made me feel jealous. When it came to the chest department, she also gave me a challenge. They were huge and her feminized top clung to the contours and the arousal-erect nipples. When the change settled down, the first thing she did was bounce in place to jiggle them. <br />
<br />
“Dude, I mean…Courtney. It got me too. Holy cow, I just… Wow, you felt like this? Oh ohhhh… I’m gonna need a moment.”<br />
<br />
I could tell. Leading her over to the bathroom, she didn’t seem sure whether to shut the door. I noticed that her dorm area had turned into a strangely different space between blinks. The same with the restroom and all the unusual new accoutrements. But that wasn’t all, as I noticed the main dorm area and our roommates’ space also seemed significantly different. It was all a bit too much to process. I needed a moment as well and maybe a few more to fully come down from where this had left me.</p>
