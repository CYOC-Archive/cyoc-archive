<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After the resounding shout, Jen and the other cheerleaders went into the locker room to change. So busy was Jen staring at the legs and shoes of the girls in front of her, that she didn&#39;t notice that some of the girls still had arms around each other&#39;s shoulders, or were holding hands.<br />
<br />
Within a few minutes of entering, the girls were laughing and chatting. They started by talked about boys like they always did, laughed about funny events, moaned about teachers, all while slowly changing into their normal clothes. Jen saw a few rolling down the their thigh high white socks from under their short pleated cheer skirts. She found her mouth watering as bare feet were exposed, their owners wiggling their toes and stretching their soles in the open air of the locker room.<br />
<br />
FEET <br />
<br />
The word played about in her head for the umpteenth time that day. Her eyes hopped from foot to foot, ogling her continually cuter teammates with an increasingly lustful gaze.<br />
<br />
With all her willpower, Jen tore her eyes away from the beautiful sights. She quickly opened her locker, grabbed her backpack, then rushed back to one of the locker room&#39;s shower stalls and started to change. Jen took a moment to breathe, her back pressed against the stall&#39;s wall as she fought to calm herself down. After a couple minutes she was breathing normally, but an increasingly larger portion of her brain still remained devoted to the soft soles parading about the room outside the showers.<br />
<br />
She slipped her feet out of her cheerleading shoes causing her to gleefully wiggle her toes in their socks. Her feet enjoyed their freedom from the confining shoes as Jen kicked them out of her way. She clenched and unclenched her toes against the tile floor, feeling the fabric of her striped toe socks rub between each dainty toe. She thought about removing the socks, but wasn&#39;t sure she could handle even her own bare feet at the moment.<br />
<br />
Jen then removed her cheerleading top. It managed to snag on the underside of her breasts before finally being pulled off, causing Jen&#39;s breasts to bounce when released. For some reason Jen became fascinated with her own breasts. <br />
<br />
My chest feels so much hotter than usual thought Jen, surprised at how sensitive her nipples had become. They rubbed up against the fabric of her bra, creating a pleasurable current between her chest and twitching soles. Reaching behind her, Jen soon found the latch which kept the garment secured. With a flick and a pull, Jen&#39;s breasts were free of the aggravating object. Overcome with relief, she threw the bra over the stall wall, on top of her backpack.<br />
<br />
Jen was about to continue changing when she heard a moan come from the main part of the locker room. Curious, Jen straightened up before stepping out of the shower stall. Walking into the room she peered around the corner, one part of her brain trying to make sense of the strange behavior that was taking place, while the other fizzled and said all was normal.<br />
<br />
Some girls were giggling happily, talking animatedly about the cute girls in their classes as they slid girly dresses over their feminine forms. Others were hungrily admiring another girl&#39;s delicate arches and adorable toes as she showed off her new nail polish color, one spectator even licking her lips unconsciously. Two girls were discussing which would be cuter; white ruffled ankle socks or neon pink and black striped knee socks they had worn to practice. <br />
<br />
Jen found herself sliding out from around the corner and standing stock still, uncaring that her breasts were completely exposed to the room. Like a kid in a candy shop, she was unable decide which delight to rush to first. She bit her lip even as the word of the day bounced around her skull yet again.<br />
<br />
FEET<br />
<br />
A wave of energy crashed through her as the word insistently squashed out other thoughts, and her knees buckled as she scanned across each foot-based fantasy.<br />
<br />
FEET<br />
<br />
She was biting her lip hard, still unable to make up her mind. &quot;Feeet...&quot; she half-mumbled, half-growled to herself. However, the sounds of a commotion at the far side of the room caught Jen&#39;s attention.<br />
<br />
Snapping her hungry eyes away from the Hispanic girl sliding the ruffled ankle socks over her feet, she walked over and peered among the rows of lockers.<br />
<br />
Three girls were huddled together among the back row. Bree, a red haired girl with a fiery attitude had Jen&#39;s good friend Jade, a lovely Korean-American girl with long black hair, by the arms and was holding her. Stephanie, a short but stout brunette who often stood by Bree even during her more over the top moments, was trying to undo Jade&#39;s bra. Jade had a strange look on her face, half-scared and embarrassed, yet half-enjoying the moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s going on here?&quot; shouted Jen, cheer captain instincts beating out her lust as she ran over and stamped her foot, which turned the attention of all nearby girls to her. Startled, Bree turned and Jade let go just as Stephanie managed to unhook the bra, causing the Asian girl to fly forward directly onto Jen. The two girls fell to the ground in a heap, Jade landing on top while Jen took the brunt of the fall.<br />
<br />
As the two slowly came out of the pain, Jade was the first to speak, &quot;Oh I&#39;m sorry Jenny! I didn&#39;t mean to fall on you. I was just trying to... to... well I don&#39;t know.&quot; She gushed quickly at Jen. &quot;The girls I guess were trying to get me out of that bra. It was funny at first but I was scared when she grabbed my arms cause that felt odd but good...and I can&#39;t stop flexing my toes...and I&#39;M SORRY!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s alright,&quot; said Jennifer as she looked up at her almost crying friend. &quot;There&#39;s no need to cry. Think of it this way; thanks to Bree and Stephanie, you&#39;ve just experienced your first time of being on top.&quot;<br />
<br />
The other girls watching laughed at this and so did Jade who then moved off Jennifer. Jennifer then also stood up and hugged her friend tightly. They shuddered as their bare nipples rubbed against each other, and Jen&#39;s foot was quickly rubbing against the other girl&#39;s foot.<br />
<br />
Jennifer turned to Bree and Stephanie, glaring at them. &quot;Go on you two, and don&#39;t mess with my friend again unless you want Coach Hendricks to tan your hides!&quot;<br />
<br />
The two other girls sheepishly slunk off, Stephanie muttering that she wouldn&#39;t mind some time alone with the coach.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Jenny,&quot; said Jade as she turned kissed the cheer captain on the cheek. &quot;S-sorry&quot; she stammered, realizing what she just did. She suddenly blushed and looked down, only to be entranced by the colors of Jen&#39;s toe socks as the cheer captain rubbed insistently against Jade&#39;s arches. &quot;I really need to get some socks that are just as beautiful as yours.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; said Jennifer, not caring that Jade&#39;s hand was slowly sliding higher and higher up her thigh. With the situation defused, the insistent part of her brain devoted to girly feet was quickly taking over again.<br />
<br />
FEET<br />
<br />
She glanced down at the soft white ankle socks on her friend&#39;s tiny feet. She watched, unfazed, as they crept up higher on her legs, becoming crew socks. &quot;Yours are super cute as is. Like the feet in them!&quot; Jen gasped out, barely able to form the words as her mind pulsed with the urges again. <br />
<br />
FEET<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-you think so?&quot; said Jade, biting her lip before she hugged Jennifer again, pressing Jen more tightly against her slim body. The two topless girls breathed heavily as they embraced one another.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-you can see them if you&#39;d like...&quot; Jade whispered in her ear, and Jen felt her knees wobble.</p>
