<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">{{Okay. Once again, life and work has had other ideas about how I should spend my time of late, but I&#39;m back!—tmw.}}<br />
<br />
It was a pretty boring day at school for Nate Anderson. Other than the warning text from his younger brother Eric about lunch being chili, he had no other contact with anyone via his cellphone.<br />
His classes as a high school Junior were pretty standard, for Nate would never deny Eric was the brains of the family.<br />
Mercilessly tease him at times about it yes, but never would deny the fact.<br />
After the school officially let out for the day, Nate served his second detention of the week that Tuesday, for playing hooky to have a threesome with Liv Robinson and Jean Talbot last Friday.<br />
The horny werewolf didn&#39;t regret having sex with the wereleopard and werelioness. Nate just wish he didn&#39;t have to skip school and get in trouble for it, let alone that Liv would tone down her more &quot;kinkier&quot; tastes.<br />
It was kind of lonely in the school room, because Alex Ramsey only had detention Monday for lovingly slapping his boyfriend Ben Twist on the rump, something that was frowned upon in school, regardless of the circumstances.<br />
Now with detention and most of his homework done, Nate headed home, but stopped first at his next door neighbor&#39;s house.<br />
<br />
Knocking, Nate waited until his friend Ben answered the door, but wasn&#39;t surprised to see his fellow werewolf only in what was probably a hastily donned pair of &quot;tighty whities&quot;.<br />
&quot;I assume Alex is here,&quot; said Nate, knowing more than likely what was going on between the lovers. <i>Upstairs linking lupines again,</i> he surmised, although Ben was currently in his human form.<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; said Ben with a smile. While Nate&#39;s acute senses confirmed the smell of heavy sexual activity, Ben&#39;s current state of dress, and Alex coming down the stairs in just his underwear were more than enough clues to solve that mystery.<br />
&quot;Can I talk to both of you for a moment?&quot; wondered Nate.<br />
&quot;Sure. Come on in,&quot; offered Ben, closing the door after his friend entered.<br />
<br />
The two lovers sat on the couch together as Nate stood before them. While there was no nudity hang ups among weres, seeing two guys just sitting together in their underwear didn&#39;t do much for Nate, so he got right to the point of his visit.<br />
&quot;Do either of you know anything about this?&quot; he asked, pulling a folded slip of paper out of his shirt pocket and handing it to them.<br />
Ben took the paper from Nate, looked at it, then handed the slip to Alex so he could examine it more closely.<br />
All it said was <i>HELLO CUTIE</i>, with a red lipstick print on it.<br />
&quot;No,&quot; answered Ben, while Alex shook his head negatively before handing the paper back to Nate.<br />
&quot;Found it in my locker after last class, before I went to detention. It wasn&#39;t there any earlier, so I guess someone slipped it through the air vents of my locker door, because it was just laying on top of my stuff. But here&#39;s the thing, I took a good sniff of it, and there was absolutely NO scent on it! Neither were or normal.&quot;<br />
&quot;Odd,&quot; agreed Ben, while Alex confirmed he only smelled Nate&#39;s presence on it.<br />
<br />
&quot;At first I wondered if either you of two might of been trying to pull some kind of a prank on me, but quickly ruled that out because neither of you would stoop to something that low,&quot; said Nate.<br />
&quot;You&#39;re right. We wouldn&#39;t do something like that to you. Maybe put cat food in your werewolf kibbles,&quot; Ben said jokingly, &quot;but nothing like that.&quot;<br />
&quot;Then any idea who sent it?&quot; wondered Nate, while sitting down in a chair across from them.<br />
Both of Nate&#39;s friends shook their heads negatively.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m officially through with Kenya and neither she, Liv, or Jean have direct access to the school. So I&#39;m stumped,&quot; admitted Nate.<br />
&quot;So you have a secret admirer. What&#39;s the big deal?&quot; asked Alex in return.<br />
&quot;I have enough problems with women right now without adding to them,&quot; pointed out Nate.<br />
&quot;Who said whoever sent that would be a problem?&quot; wondered Ben. &quot;Even if your mysterious admirer turns out to be a Senior, at least she&#39;s someone you might have more in common with than the women you&#39;ve already dealt with.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, and unless she&#39;s a crazed stalker and wants to go all <i>Basic Instinct</i> on you, you might wind up having some fun,&quot; said Alex.<br />
&quot;Yeah. You&#39;re right guys. It is too soon to get all worked up over what might turn out to be nothing,&quot; agreed Nate. &quot;And if it turns out to be something...&quot;<br />
&quot;Just take it one day at a time,&quot; advised Ben. &quot;After all, even if you knew who sent it, you still have to finish detention this week before making any plans.&quot;<br />
&quot;And from my brief time in there, that&#39;s boring as hell. Besides, from your perspective, there were no girls in there, only guys,&quot; observed Alex. <i>And considering Nate isn&#39;t gay*, I hope it wasn&#39;t a guy who sent it, because he&#39;ll be SERIOUSLY disappointed.</i><br />
&quot;Well, it does give me a good head start on my homework. Speaking of which, my parents have told me they&#39;re reserving the basement for the night, since Eric&#39;s out at his werepanther induction ceremony. So at least I&#39;ve got the upstairs and the Internet all to myself tonight,&quot; said Nate, thinking about keeping his headphones on and not having to worry about slow bandwidth and buffering.<br />
<br />
&quot;Knowing your folks the way I do, the basement means there&#39;s at least one other couple involved. I know it&#39;s not my moms, because they&#39;ve already told me not to take my shower until morning so there&#39;s plenty of hot water for their candle lit romantic bubble bath tonight, so any idea who?&quot; wondered Ben out of idle curiosity.<br />
&quot;Other than the fact it isn&#39;t the Lawsons, because I overheard Eric and Spencer talking that her mother is taking a <i>couple of days off</i> because they want to try and create another little Lawson, no idea,&quot; said Nate. &quot;But with the basement soundproof and Eric out of the house, I&#39;m just looking forward to some peace and quiet.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, I hope you get it man,&quot; said Ben, standing. &quot;But unless there&#39;s anything else, Alex and I only have about another hour before my moms get home, so...&quot;<br />
&quot;I understand. Hope you two have more fun. See you in school tomorrow,&quot; said Nate, before Ben walked him to the front door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Take care Nate,&quot; said Ben, before closing the front door behind him.<br />
With that Ben Twist turned to see a furry werewolf approaching.<br />
&quot;Now, where were we?&quot; asked Alex, as he started using his paws to remove Ben&#39;s underwear even as his lover was starting to go furry again.<br />
&quot;MMMM.... right there handsome,&quot; growled Ben, as Alex was slowly engulfing his lupine rocket within his muzzle. &quot;By the way, you didn&#39;t have anything to do with Nate&#39;s...&quot;<br />
&quot;No,&quot; answered Alex, between loving licks. &quot;You?&quot;<br />
&quot;No,&quot; replied Ben, urging Alex onward. &quot;I just hope for Nate&#39;s sake that whatever&#39;s going on doesn&#39;t go badly for him,&quot; he added, before giving his boyfriend a hot load of werewolf cream.<br />
