<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Part 4.<br />
<br />
When Jake awoke, he was on the massive couch that engulfed his small frame. His body was walking in front of him, confusedly touching his temples and walking around the room naked.<br />
<br />
“I couldn’t find any underwear, dad.” His son was of course still inhabiting his body. <br />
<br />
“It’s in the small drawer inside my closet.”<br />
<br />
“Oh. Dad, this is too weird. I don’t like it, I don’t like going to work. Can’t I just stay home today?!” <br />
<br />
“I know this is difficult, but…maybe today you can fake getting sick. You had to go to the meeting, but if they just use the notes I’ve created for the new changes in the department with the merger I’m sure things will go fine and you won’t have to worry about having to impersonate me anymore.”<br />
<br />
Aaron came over and sat on the couch. Ever since he’d swapped with his dad he’d been asked to walk around his dad’s work, with dozens of people telling him different things. It was fast paced and he hadn’t had too much time to think about things. He moved a large hand over his chest. <br />
<br />
“I shouldn’t be in front of you like this, I’m sorry.”<br />
<br />
He left the room while his dad in his son’s body laughed, saying it wasn’t anything he hadn’t seen before. Aaron walked over to the mirror by his dad’s bed. Before him was such largeness. He wasn’t used to it still and he felt momentarily dizzy. Yesterday felt like a dream. It had been fun for a minute, then panic for the rest of the day. Now that the panic and confusion and distractedness were over he had time to pause and really look at his reflection. He cupped a hand over his chest, smoothing over the strangeness of it. <br />
<br />
“I’m an adult” he said in an adult’s voice. “But I’m not, I’m just a little kid.” He began to whimper and cry. He walked over to the bed and hugged himself, tears starting to stream down his face. He wanted his body back! He couldn’t be his dad. He couldn’t deal with the pressure of having to be depended on to do something he had no idea how to do! What if he lost his dad’s job? His dad would be so mad at him!<br />
<br />
He cried for a time, felt the new hair on his legs. After crying he felt a little bit better. There was a knock on his door. <br />
<br />
<br />
“Hold on, I’m naked, I’ll be out in a sec!”<br />
<br />
It’s so weird that I sound like dad now. I’m tall, though, and that’s pretty cool. He smiled. Looked down on the bed. Stroked his dick. That felt pretty good, like last night…he’d never played with his dick like that before. Maybe he could do it again later. He felt his muscles and got down on the floor, doing some push ups. Somehow it just felt like he needed to do them. After doing so for about ten minutes he got up and went to his dad’s shower and turned the water on.<br />
<br />
Showering, Aaron seemed to forget about his problems. It just felt so good, the soap over his hairy chest, his legs…his entire body just had a pleasure to it now, the large curves of muscle…back and front he was a different person now. It felt strange still, but enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Coming out of the bathroom, he found Jimmy waiting for him in the living room, trying to talk to his dad. Of course Jimmy didn’t know he was talking to the real adult. He thought dad was him! Which meant…<br />
<br />
So, ready to go? <br />
<br />
Aaron pulled his towel around him tighter.<br />
<br />
“Uh…”<br />
<br />
“It’s okay, dad. I understand you can’t stay home to take care of me. I’ll be fine.”<br />
<br />
“Kid’s right, man. We gotta get in, so hustle it up. Rottmueller says that his presentation is all set to go, all he needs is the right back up. Our presentation is tomorrow. It got bumped up, so we’ll be working late tonight.”<br />
<br />
Jake’s hands crumpled the couch reflexively. He was incredibly nervous about letting his son parade around at work for even one day, now it was all sliding downhill. Why was Jimmy here again? Why was he picking up Aaron here?”<br />
<br />
“So, uh…Mr. Stout, why isn’t my dad just driving to work?”<br />
<br />
“Cause I was in a hurry and besides which he told me yesterday his car has a flat.”<br />
<br />
Good thinking, Aaron. At least the kid is thinking on his toes.<br />
<br />
Aaron felt his rough beard coming in and wanted to shave, but there wasn’t enough time to learn. He hopped around in his pants, trying to get in, remembering what his dad had told him. The shoes felt funny. That was one thing he hated, they were so loose feeling compared with sneakers. Why couldn’t he just wear jeans to work? Next came the shirt, and tie. He chose them carefully, and then stumbled with the tie for a while. It was hard to remember exactly how it went, and he didn’t get it right the first few times. He looked at the mirror. Dad never looked this helpless, he thought.<br />
<br />
He was breathing fast and scared so he took a few deep breaths. <br />
<br />
Jimmy was talking to his dad about baseball when he came out.<br />
<br />
“Alright, champ,” Jimmy said to Jake. “Me and your dad have to go save our company. Time’s a wastin’”.<br />
<br />
“Bye, uh…champ.”<br />
<br />
“Bye…dad.”<br />
<br />
After the two grown ups left, Jake felt like he was going to go insane. There was nothing he could do or say which could change this and his control was spiraling. After making breakfast that morning, which took him much longer than it usually did, on account of having to climb up on the counters to get things down, he managed to open his email, parouse the newspaper, flip on the TV to see if anything good was on (there wasn’t) before he noticed his son’s video game console.<br />
<br />
Well, heck, I know lots of guys who play video games. No point in wasting money, he thought. Let’s see what this puppy can do.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, back at work, Aaron settled into a routine. First, coffee to wake up. He had never needed coffee before but his brain did. He passed the coffee in the break room and suddenly his reflexes kicked in. He found himself feeling like he’d done this before, and he hadn’t! It just felt familiar.<br />
<br />
“Hi, Jake”<br />
<br />
“Hi, Alice” he said to the woman who had popped into his office as he sat down.<br />
<br />
“Hi, Jake.”<br />
<br />
“Morning, Gloria.” Aaron smiled. He somehow knew people’s names when he met them. Part of that was he’d been introduced to his dad’s co-workers a couple of times and another was they all felt familiar. Almost as familiar as kids at school. <br />
<br />
Aaron had to give a presentation today. He had given presentations to his 6th grade teacher so this should be easy, he thought. Only this was a room full of grownups that weren’t his teacher! They looked so serious. And he was getting paid to do this job. He had to do a good job for Dad! <br />
Dad had gone over the basics the night before. They had practiced for a few hours before Jake was convinced Aaron could do it on his own. It had been very stressful for both of them. Aaron had to get used to adult business terms he knew nothing about previously. It was like studying for a really important test right before the day of the test and you didn’t know anything about the subject! <br />
<br />
When Aaron had to get up in front of all the adults and talk about MorphCorp, he was nervous for only a few seconds before he realized they all thought he was an adult! I can totally do this and they’ll pay attention to me, he thought. I am a grown up MAN! I look so tall and cool in my suit! <br />
<br />
“Gentlemen, ladies. We have an opportunity to really further our company and take it to the next level. We have a lot of different markets that could open up with this new merger and it could be the best possible thing that ever happened to us. I know a lot of people think ‘merger’ can be a scary word but let me assure you, we have mutual interests that can be met with this venture…” <br />
<br />
Wow, I sound just like Dad does! I sound so smart and cool and confident! I sound just like a businessman! HOW do I know so much!? It’s like I know everything about how to be Dad and he didn’t even have to tell me and stuff!  <br />
<br />
Before he knew it, Aaron found he had tons of suggestions as to how the merger could be beneficial. Some of them were Dad’s ideas but he found that he had a few of his own that Dad had never even considered.<br />
<br />
A few hours later, he found himself being approached by some of the guys in the office concerning visitors from some clients who had dropped by just to get a demonstration of some of the newer products. Things were moving so quickly! <br />
<br />
“Jake, we have a problem. I was wondering if you could help us out.”<br />
<br />
“Shoot.” Aaron was doing a pretty good impression of his father. He found himself saying dad-like things without intending to. Maybe that was just part of knowing dad so well that he picked up on his personal lingo.<br />
<br />
“The bodybuilder that was supposed to model out the designs for the new weightlifting equipment couldn’t show up. Broke an ankle the other day while surfing. Tripped over a board when he stumbled, he was so big he couldn’t get through a door, poor thing, anyway we were wondering if you could just pop on over and give a demo since you’re so athletic.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, sure, no problem. It’ll be a vacation compared with this pile I’ve been dealing with.”<br />
<br />
“Come with me, Mr. Athletic Scholarship.”<br />
<br />
In the demo room, a few execs waited patiently. All good looking men, in their mid twenties and up, six of them had shown up all in suits. Aaron shook their hands one by one, flashed a smile at each one. Being his dad had meant he was now at eye level with adults and he still found it somewhat jarring. Nervously he crept over to the bench.<br />
<br />
“So, tell me again…this new line of yours, how is it different and why should we give you our contract, Jake? We’ve been looking at other companies, they all tend to have relatively the same stuff, but your boss told us you guys definitely have something different.”<br />
<br />
“Well, that has to do with a new alloy we’ve been using, it’s cheaper to produce than the others, and so the coating on the weights is more easily shipped and allocated. It’s high tech and it’s designed to be more ergonomic than schools might be used to, all in the name of saving medical costs for back injuries but without the expense of well to do ergonomic factories that overcharge.”<br />
<br />
Sometimes there was a buildup in Aaron’s mind of new info but it didn’t feel new, it felt like it was simmering, waiting to be let loose, but really he just had to open the right door.<br />
<br />
“So can you demonstrate for us?”<br />
<br />
“Sure, sure…” Aaron loosened his tie and collar, and got under one of the first machines, and exercised his back and biceps with an upward motion of his arms. Aaron definitely liked it and as he talked he could feel his body’s relief. Dad’s body needed to work out, he thought. I should go to the gym later. Luckily there was one in the building so he wouldn’t have to go far.<br />
<br />
After the demo was done, Jake was sweaty and it shone through his business shirt. One of the shorter, younger men looked up at him rather wistfully and said “I guess that’s one of the on the job hazards, right Jake?” <br />
<br />
“Huh? Oh, sorry. I didn’t mean to. I got my shirt all wet.”<br />
<br />
“I’ll say you did,” the man whispered so only Aaron could hear. Did he just wink at me? Why would he wink at me? The others were grouping around at the other end of the room, before walking over to congratulate him.<br />
<br />
“Well, I’ve seen enough here,” said the oldest one. “We’ll talk to your people later, Jake, but I like what I see.” Aaron couldn’t believe how..how..how IMPORTANT he felt! Aaron shook hands with each man one more time, and the last was the one he’d been talking to. His name was Geoff. Geoff was blonde and young, maybe twenty two. Just recently graduated from college. Geoff squeezed Aaron’s hand a little longer than the others had. They smiled at each other. <br />
<br />
“We should get together sometime. For drinks. Hanalua Bar. My treat.” <br />
<br />
“Oh. Okay. Uh…I was gonna workout tonight. And Jimmy said I might need to work late tonight.”<br />
<br />
“Isn’t Jimmy the same floor as you? C’mon dude, he’s not your boss. We should go out. Look, I’ll call you later, okay?”<br />
<br />
“Sure! That’d be fun.”<br />
<br />
Aaron got a thrill out of the fact he was now allowed to go to bars. Bars were the one place he was definitely not ever allowed to go as a kid. Before he could only peer through windows occasionally. See the amber toned lights and festive atmosphere. Pubs always seemed so fun, he always wished he could go to them and last night he got to. But he was so worried he hadn’t really had as much fun as he thought. Maybe with Geoff they could be friends. He didn’t really have adult friends of his own, he thought, they were all dad’s friends.<br />
<br />
This is fun, he thought on the way back to his office. I get to go to, like, all the places I wanted to before. I can even go to R rated movies! I didn’t even think of that before! Though it’s not like I haven’t seen tons of those over the decades. Huh. That was an odd thing to think. I’ve only been alive one decade!<br />
<br />
He shook his head and started going through papers. Eventually Jimmy joined him to talk about the presentation. It was pretty straightforward facts and figures. It was like going up in front of the teacher at school. Only he didn’t feel as nervous. This was more like talking to friends, and no one in class would be laughing at him for saying something smart. In fact, they expected it! He smiled as he got out a protractor.<br />
<br />
Hours later, the evening was near and he told Jimmy he was gonna hit the gym. Jimmy said he’d stay behind a little while to finish up, but he understood. <br />
<br />
“Oh and I’ll be going to the Hanalua bar afterwards.”<br />
<br />
“So you sure you don’t need a ride home? Guess you can take a cab later. Or uh get a ride from Geoff. Yeah, I saw you two talking earlier. You dog,” Jimmy said winking at him. <br />
<br />
“Kay. Bye, Mr. Stout.”<br />
<br />
“Bye, Mr. Bentley,” Jimmy said laughing<br />
<br />
Man I keep forgetting to use first names. I gotta remember that.<br />
<br />
He went to the gym to change. His shirt had dried but he felt like he was gonna go crazy unless he stretched his body. Aaron had been working out for a full half hour before he realized he hadn’t had to read any of the instructions on the machines like he thought he would have to. His tank top stretched over his pecs, massive shoulders, his bare biceps straining. Veins marked the outsides of the thick limbs. He wiped himself down, and eventually couldn’t contain himself. Hopping over to the bathrooms he went into one of the stalls and hurried to get his pants off.<br />
<br />
He couldn’t wait. He just was glad no one came in as he was thinking about all the men he had seen today, in their suits, and all the muscles they had underneath. He smiled when he was done and wiped off his brow. Cupped a pec with his heavy hand and felt his heart beat. He still couldn’t believe he was doing this. He wiped himself off, and zipped up. He looked in the bathroom mirror and scratched his very darkened face. The stubble had grown thick and quick, he noticed. I’ll have to learn to shave tonight. Although what’s to know, you just lather up and work down with a blade. Nothing to that, it isn’t rocket science.<br />
<br />
Which, as it just so happened, he also knew something about. Which was funny. He couldn’t remember ever reading about it. His mind was so full of new information.<br />
<br />
At the Hanalua Bar, the entire pub was decorated with a Hawaiian theme. He walked in and noticed Geoff right away. Short, wavy blonde hair neatly cut, enjoying a fruit juice drink. Geoff stood up right away, extended his hand. Aaron thought he was going for a handshake but then Geoff hugged him and patted him on the back! He felt a thrill go down his spine. <br />
<br />
“Please, sit down. Take a load off. You want one of these, man?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, sure.”<br />
<br />
Geoff made the order and started talking about how smooth Aaron was in front of all the execs. “They went for it hook, line, and sinker, man. You were awesome.”<br />
<br />
“It was nothing,” Aaron looked shyly down.<br />
<br />
“No. No, man. I mean you have got talent. Natural instinct man. Experience. I wish I had those things. I just feel like I don’t even know what I’m doing half the time!”<br />
<br />
“No..um. I feel that way, too!”<br />
<br />
Geoff laughed. “Yeah, right. You’re just saying that to make me feel better.”<br />
<br />
After his drink came, Aaron noticed it tasted somewhat sour. “What’s in this?”<br />
<br />
“It’s pineapple juice and vodka, man.”<br />
<br />
Wow, he thought. I’m drinking vodka. Why not? I am an adult after all! <br />
<br />
One drink turned into two and then three. The two men stumbled outside and it was now dark. <br />
<br />
“I think we better take a cab, man.”<br />
<br />
“Okay.”<br />
<br />
The rest was sort of hazy. Aaron was really enjoying the freedom he felt while slightly buzzed. He found himself with a hand on Geoff’s leg. Before he knew what was happening, Geoff was locking lips with him. He tasted Geoff’s tongue, and was too uninhibited to care. He felt Geoff’s suit rile against his own shirt. He felt the other man’s stubble, kissed him continuously. They didn’t say anything and Aaron just wanted to keep going. But finally the cab stopped at his apartment building.<br />
<br />
“Oh. I guess I have to go home now. I have to check on dad.”<br />
<br />
“Your dad is staying with you, huh?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, for a while,” Aaron said kind of confused as to why someone would ask him that. “Dad’s lived with me my whole life. I mean…uh…it feels that way sometimes. He…grandpa…he doesn’t. I have a son. My son lives with me.”<br />
<br />
“Okay, I get it. But we’ll continue this later, I promise. C’mere, gimme a kiss for the road.” They locked lips again. Aaron couldn’t believe that he was getting to do this, it was like all his wildest fantasies he’d never told anyone about, but it felt so good. “I really connect with you, Jake.”<br />
<br />
The cab sped off. Aaron stumbled into the building, got on the elevator, and ecstatically leaned against the wall and wore a grin ear to ear. He got off the elevator, did a happy dance over to the door to his apartment, and unlocked the door.<br />
<br />
“Hey, dad!!”<br />
<br />
“Son? It’s about time you got home. Where’ve you been?”<br />
<br />
“I went to the bar with a client.”<br />
<br />
“Son, you need to take this thing seriously!” Jake was now standing in front of his son, looking up. “I know you’re having fun, but as long as you’re pretending to be me, you have to keep appearances but at a minimum. We don’t want anyone to suspect!”<br />
<br />
“No one does expect, dad. You worry too much. Geoff…and all the other guys from MorphCorp were blown away by my demo!” Aaron was really excited and jumped up and down and extended his hand for a high five. Then he realized dad couldn’t reach and lowered his palm. His father accepted it. “Alright! WooooOOOO! Yeah! MorphCorp! I got a presentation tomorrow and we are gonna kick ASS! What?”<br />
<br />
“Nothing, I just…I guess things are going way better than I expected. You’re sure you can do this? I mean, you understand everything? I better go down the list of things and explain it to you.”<br />
<br />
“Oh man, can I eat dinner first? I’m starving!” Aaron walked over and started popping some things together for a quick meal. “Have you been eating cereal all day?” he asked, noticing the bowls all lined up that hadn’t been washed. <br />
<br />
“Yeah, I guess I just didn’t feel like making anything complicated.”<br />
<br />
“Man am I beat. Going to work is tougher than I thought it would be but I’m good at it. It’s weird, dad. Maybe it’s just like going to class only it’s different.” Aaron held his face in concentration. “It’s like sometimes I need to know something and I just dig around and there it is.”<br />
<br />
“Well whatever you’re doing just keep it up. Tomorrow is Friday and it’s the last day you’ll have to go to work. You can fake being sick after the weekend. Once the big hooplah is all over with.”<br />
<br />
“Oh it’s not that big a deal. They just needed to see it all in person to know we have the best product. Just talking with them in person…it was like I was confident. I got to show them how to lift weights on the new models.” Aaron said, and drew at his lapels in a rather grown up gesture.<br />
<br />
“Well uh…okay. I guess I’d better go down the list then. Actually I copied it all down for you. But if you have any questions…” <br />
<br />
“Nah. I’ll read it before I go to bed.” Aaron said. The microwave dinged and he took out his chicken parmesan. “You know you should have something more than cereal. Something with more…protein. How bout’ a sandwich?”<br />
<br />
“Uh…sure. Yeah, I guess I should.”<br />
<br />
The two ate dinner in front of the TV. It was on the news but Aaron flipped it around until football came on. He never really liked football but for some reason the scores seemed interesting tonight for some reason. <br />
<br />
“So…how was your day, dad?”<br />
<br />
“Huh? Oh I uh…well I did some reading. You know.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, more like you were playing video games,” Aaron said, still rather happily intoxicated. He shoved his dad in a friendly manner. “You were totally playing video games, dad. Admit it.” Aaron was in a really good mood, and gobbled down more of his meal.<br />
<br />
“Okay, okay. I got into the cartoon ones. Something about the Sonic one I really liked. And the other sword battle ones.”<br />
<br />
“You should play Halo, dad. Halo is totally awesome. It’s way better than the other ones. Actually I think I should get more military games. Like the combat zone ones, or the WWII ones.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I don’t know that much about WWII.”<br />
<br />
“What are you talking about? You have all those books on WWII on your shelf.”<br />
<br />
“Huh? Sorry, can we change the channel?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, what do you wanna watch?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know. Just keep going.”<br />
<br />
“Let’s see…we got Seinfeld.”<br />
<br />
“No.”<br />
<br />
“Uh…I Dream of Jeannie.”<br />
<br />
“No.”<br />
<br />
“Basketball…Cops…Spongebob.”<br />
<br />
“Oh hey, keep it there.”<br />
<br />
“Really?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I mean…it’s a kids show but it’s got adult humor in it.” <br />
<br />
Aaron smiled good naturedly, and nodded. “Okay. Spongebob it is.”<br />
<br />
Jake watched TV contentedly. Aaron switched off the TV and went back to his new room to read over dad’s notes. Once he got through some of them he noticed some inconsistencies that he wound up crossing out. Dad actually confused the Peterson account with the Steelcat account! Those were two entirely different companies! And on this page he’d confused Gold’s Gym with a local, smaller independent gym that only had like three outlets! Man, dad must be pretty tired. Either that or too many video games! It took him an hour before he finally read through the entire thing. It was funny, dad should have known better than to make the mistakes he did, and there were a lot of them. On a couple pages dad had even drawn a couple of doodles of guys fighting aliens. Man, dad must be really bored here in the apartment, he thought. Maybe we should go out this weekend. <br />
<br />
Aaron didn&#39;t tell his dad about all the mistakes he made on the reports because he didn&#39;t want to stress Dad out or hurt his feelings. <br />
<br />
Dad made dinner. It was lasagna night and Aaron helped. His dad was pint sized now and only Aaron could reach certain things from the cupboards! <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, this is so cool! Dad, I can reach everything!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know. Don&#39;t remind me.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, Dad. It&#39;s just...well...it&#39;s neat bein tall for once. You&#39;re always saying I&#39;m gonna grow like a weed one day and now I have! I mean I love being tall. I&#39;m having a lot of fun bein&#39; you, Dad! I felt like such a grown up today when I was giving that presentation. Everyone thought I was so cool. I finally know what it&#39;s like to be a MAN! That&#39;s crazy! I can&#39;t wait to grow up for reals and get a job. It&#39;s way more fun than school is!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, well...I&#39;m glad you have an appreciation now for what I do. And I&#39;m proud of you. You remembered everything I told you and you did the presentation just like an adult. I&#39;m going to allow you one cookie tonight for your dessert.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Gee, thanks, Dad,&quot; Aaron said, rolling his eyes. &quot;How about you let me watch an R rated movie?!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...what were you thinking of watching?&quot;<br />
<br />
Aaron turned the TV on to an action movie with lots of killing and explosions. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve been wanting to watch this for like, forever, but you said I wasn&#39;t old enough!&quot; Aaron gushed with his father&#39;s deep voice. It sounded so odd still, speaking in his father&#39;s deep voice. &quot;Now I&#39;m totally an adult so you can&#39;t tell me that I&#39;m not old enough!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well I can&#39;t argue with that logic,&quot; Jake agreed. He was entertaining his young son but in many ways he felt he had to. Aaron was huge now and Jake didn&#39;t want any...problems. Better to keep the kid happy until they could switch back! Jake couldn&#39;t wait. What a horrible thing to have to go through. It&#39;s humiliating. Aaron jumped up and down on the couch in excitement. <br />
<br />
Dad konked out pretty early and Aaron turned the TV off. He covered his dad&#39;s puny body. Am I really that puny?? he thought. Gosh he&#39;s so small compared with me now! Aaron felt protective towards his father. He now knew how it must feel to actually be a father and take care of someone so much smaller than yourself. <br />
<br />
Suddenly he remembered about shaving. That was very important.<br />
<br />
He got to the bathroom, groggily looked for his tools and went at it, just like he had done a thousand times before. He changed into a wife beater T-shirt and was in bed before he realized that he hadn’t done it before. Man, it just had to be the alcohol, he thought. It sure makes you feel funny sometimes… <br />
<br />
Aaron got onto his dad&#39;s computer and started rooting around for the porn. He had never seen porn before and soon he was stroking his new, huge dad sized cock over and over again. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah...oh yeah...ooooohHHHHHHHHHOOOOHHHHHHHH&quot; <br />
<br />
He stroked his dick over and over and over and cum erupted once more out of his adult cock. He couldn&#39;t believe how amazing he felt. He had never felt anything like this when he was a boy. He wanted to put his dick inside a woman&#39;s vagina...or maybe a man&#39;s ass. He wanted to FUCK, he thought. <br />
<br />
I bet having sex is awesome. It looks so much fun! he thought. I mean...it makes sense! I am an adult now! <br />
<br />
Aaron wondered if he should tell his Dad what he was doing in his new adult body but then decided against it. Aaron jerked off a few more times, reveling in his wonderful new adulthood. <br />
<br />
Aaron drifted off to sleep, perfectly content. <br />
<br />
I could really get used to this whole being an adult thing! he thought before drifting off to dreamland.</p>
