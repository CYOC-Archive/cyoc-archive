<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Roni gazed into the mirror at the young woman she had all but become in one area. Her height she pegged at to be about five foot five, which her mind insisted was what it was normally. The two C cup breasts that dominated her chest shifted gently as she breathed in and out, drawing her attention to them and as she ran a hand through her shoulder length hair, she let her gaze drop as she adjusted her stance so that her legs were spread.<br />
<br />
Tiny, pinish-red to a dusty rose hue, and barely an inch or so in length, her dick was now a barely-there nub. Staring at it, knowing that if she positioned herself so that she could see between her legs she would also find her lips, a smidge of hair surrounding them, and the opening to her vagina, she straightened and clamped her legs closed. The thin strip of pubic hair the only thing she had out front, she had shave most of it off, she thought about what had happened almost a week ago and shivered, as it, combined with what she was thinking of doing, screamed that, along with the naked body she saw in the mirror, there was no use denying she had become a young woman.<br />
<br />
A sigh escaped her and trying not think about how she had discovered almost a week ago she was bleeding, the panic that had threatened to overwhelm her, then the memories resurfacing, reassuring her this had happened sine she had been somewhere between the age of thirteen and fourteen and that she knew how to deal with it, that it was normal, and she examined her shoulders, feet and hands.<br />
<br />
No longer larger, masculine, but small, feminine, there was no doubt of what she was to become. Leaving her with a twisted feeling, Roni thought about what she planned to do tonight, thinking, &quot;If I like it, that settles it. I can deal with just about everything that comes my way. But the urges, the need,&quot; and trailing off mid-thought, she turned away from the looking glass. Slipping across her room, she returned to her vanity and began to once again work at making herself up.<br />
<br />
She had a date with Ted tonight. And as it was their one month anniversary, there was plans for dinner at a nice restaurant, followed by an evening of dancing, then, &quot;Well, will wait this we get that far,&quot; Roni told herself as she worked at her hair.<br />
<br />
After she had finished with her make-up and had her hair primped, she turned away from the vanity and headed for her bed. There, she picked up the small cotton undies and slipped them on. Barely covering her in front, riding high on her hips, she noted that the remains of her penis didn&#39;t even register a bump as she reached for and began to pull on her nylons.<br />
<br />
From the back of the bedroom door she took off the hanger a dress that would come down to just shy of her knees, would hug her body in the right places, had thin shoulder straps and two hidden zippers on the side. Stepping into the garment, she pulled it up, adjusted herself in a couple areas, zipped up one side, worked the dress so it sat better, then zipped up the other side, pinching the garment tightly, but not so much it was uncomfortable. Spritzing herself with a hint of perfume, Roni returned to the mirror and peered at her reflection, thinking that not only did she look pretty, but that she also felt so and liked hos she looked. Heading toward her jewellery box, she selected a necklace, noted the amulet was still amongst her things, and as she put on the necklace she had chosen, there came a knocking at her apartment door.<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s early,&quot; she thought giddily, and not bothered by it, Roni collected her shoes and left her bedroom.<br />
---<br />
<br />
Dinner, dancing, a long walk afterward to clear their heads from the one of two glasses of wine each had with dinner, their talk had ambled easily until Ted, who had been holding her hand all the time, stepped in front of her to kiss her. And as she returned the sign of affection, she listened as he nervously breathed out, &quot;I, um, want to spend the rest of my life with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sure of herself, Roni whispered, &quot;As do I,&quot; and as the unspoken line that each was ready to take the next step, Roni took a deep breath and thought, &quot;Moment of truth,&quot; as she allowed herself to be led back to Ted&#39;s car.<br />
<br />
From there, the two headed back to Ted&#39;s place where, after they had kicked off their shoes, they began to kiss, which led Roni to allowing herself to picked up and carried to the bedroom. As as she felt herself laid down on the bed, and Ted&#39;s weight atop her as they continued to kiss, she felt a fleeting moment of doubt at what she was about to do. Knowing what it would mean, she almost told him, &quot;No,&quot; but instead gently pushed, causing them to roll over. Straddling the man, dress hiked up, feeling through his slacks her erect member, Roni again felt a moment of hesitancy before reaching for the two hidden zippers on her dress and undoing them. Leaning down, she began to kiss the man beneath her as she fumbled with the buttons on his shirt.<br />
<br />
Again, they twisted and as he ended up atop her, Roni found herself be helped out of her nylons and panties. Arousal growing as a warmth slipped over her and a moist feeling could be felt, she did nothing to resist as Ted slipped her out of her dress. Another shift and this time, finding herself on top once more, she began working his pants off him as the two kissed, leaned down, ran their hands over each other&#39;s body, and then, as she felt his fingers teasing her nipples, they again rolled over. Panting, she felt him shift and looking at his face, down at his erect member, then back to his face, she reached out and ran her hands down his body, enjoying his smell and the way he felt as he fumbled with a condom. Knowing what was going to happen, Roni tensed for a moment, then relaxed. Telling herself, &quot;This will be the telling moment,&quot; she had a brief flash of worry that he&#39;d say something about her dick, but then shrugged it off, figuring if he was going to say anything, he would have already.<br />
<br />
Unaware that at some point between their stroll and their return to Ted&#39;s place that her cock had shrunken even more, Roni was blissfully oblivious as it split. Part of it forming her clit, as the other part shrank down into her lips, she moaned in pleasure and shifted to that she was in a more receptive posture as Ted because to rub his covered dick between her legs. Moaning, panting, their movements adjusting to match the other&#39;s, Roni spread her legs as Ted continued for a moment to stimulate her before starting to tease her vagina opening with the tip of dick. As when he finally plunged inward, she gasped and grasped his shoulders, pulled him closer as she felt him beginning to thrust.<br />
<br />
Understanding slipped over her and as she gasped, panted, and breathed heavily in time to the sounds Ted was making, Roni had an awakening to a truth. As her body finished its transformation and the last bits of what made her a guy vanished, the man-turned-woman knew that, no matter what, she was never going back to being a dude. She was happy for the first time in her life, with more friends than she had before, a guy who would always be there for her, no matter what, and a future that looked more promising, brighter, than what it had seemed when she had been a man. Hearing Ted grunt as he climaxed, and gasping as she found herself climaxing at about the same time, Roni smiled, not only in enjoyment, but also that she was certain that she had made the right decision.</p>
