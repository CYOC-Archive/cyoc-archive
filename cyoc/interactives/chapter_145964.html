<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Backtracking some...<br />
<br />
Moe and Nichole Charleston went up to the master bedroom of Tara Strange&#39;s cabin, leaving their daughter Karen alone on the first floor.<br />
Once they were behind the closed bedroom door, Moe turned to his wife and asked, &quot;So, how much of Karen&#39;s story do you actually believe?&quot;<br />
Nichole thought about her answer before replying. &quot;I&#39;m not sure exactly when, but I think Karen already decided upon becoming a weretigress before she finished talking to all the feline weres on her list, but knew she had to keep her promise to us before joining were society,&quot; she added, not knowing that her only daughter was already on her way to becoming a member.<br />
&quot;Probably,&quot; agreed her husband. &quot;Karen&#39;s always had a thing for that one comic book character. What&#39;s her name? Teegra?&quot;<br />
&quot;Tigra,&quot; Nichole corrected him.<br />
&quot;I remember, every time she found out that character was appearing somewhere, Karen wouldn&#39;t rest until she tracked down a copy of that issue somehow. But if she&#39;s happy...&quot; and with that, Moe simply just shrugged his shoulders.<br />
&quot;Well, at least our daughter is being responsible. When Tara comes back, Karen will have her proper were birth control pills, so we won&#39;t have to worry about becoming grandparents prematurely,&quot; added Nichole, not knowing the prescription was already in her daughter&#39;s possession.<br />
Then Nichole paused, thinking over how to phrase the question before she asked, &quot;What did you think of that werelioness?&quot;<br />
&quot;She seemed nice, if a little aloof,&quot; was Moe&#39;s first response.<br />
&quot;Err... that wasn&#39;t what I meant. What did you think OF her?&quot; Nichole asked again.<br />
&quot;Oh!&quot; said Moe, realizing what his wife was getting at. &quot;Well, I was a bit shocked at first when she started stripping in front of us, but her reason for doing so made sense. After all, when Samantha Twist changed in front of us to prove that weres do exist before revealing we&#39;d have to comply with the town&#39;s Mandatory Were Law, she was able to stay dressed because of her smaller size even when furry.&quot;<br />
&quot;But what did you think of Abbigail Tyeree as a lioness?&quot; Nichole wanted to know.<br />
Moe was contemplating a verbal response, not knowing his first instinct was more physical.<br />
&quot;You were interested in her,&quot; realized Nichole, looking at the tell tale bulge between his legs.<br />
&quot;Perhaps. It was definitely a sight to see,&quot; admitted Moe, thinking once again about how Tyeree went from normal human female to seductive werelioness in less than a minute.<br />
&quot;Would you like for us to become werelions too?&quot; Nichole wanted to know.<br />
Moe thought about that for a moment before saying, &quot;That I really don&#39;t know. Whichever were pair we do become, provided we still go through with this after Karen becomes a tigress, remains to be seen. There&#39;s a lot of possibilities to chose from,&quot; he conceded, pointing to the were guide book Nichole still held in her hands. &quot;But I do know one thing,&quot; he added, moving closer to his wife.<br />
&quot;What?&quot; she asked.<br />
&quot;That we are certainly going to have a lot of fun discussing the possibilities...&quot; Moe said with a seductive smile, before he wrapped his arms lovingly around his wife and kissed her passionately, hinting of what activity was in their immediate future.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
Having taken her very first weretigress birth control pill and changing into something &quot;more comfortable&quot; (sweats) for the evening,* Karen Charleston ventured out into the woods of Moon Lake behind Tara Strange&#39;s cabin, where her adventure first began.<br />
It was easier to pick out the well traveled trails in what remained of the daylight, although Karen knew that once she fully became a were, seeing better at night would be just one of the many benefits of her new life as a weretigress.<br />
Yet the further she went into the forest, the more she had trouble deciding upon exactly where she wanted her induction to actually occur.<br />
<i>It has to be some place nice. After all, this will be both my first transformation and losing my virginity, and such a special occasion should be held in a special place,</i> was her feelings about impending events.<br />
More thoughts wondering about what sex was actually like, let alone life as a weretigress, raced through Karen&#39;s mind when suddenly she clutched her stomach and bent over, cramping in pain.<br />
Leaning against a tree, she paused to catch her breath.<br />
Then, when the pain subsided, Karen started to straighten up when she noticed her hands.<br />
The fingers had started to assume a paw-like shape, even as her finger nails showed greater length and a claw-like pointiness.<br />
&quot;I thought I&#39;d have more time!&quot; Karen exclaimed to no one in particular. &quot;Where&#39;s Rich?&quot; she asked, looking around frantically for the weretiger she &quot;experimented&quot; with last night more than she should of that exposed her to the were virus and started her journey to becoming a tigress.<br />
But all Karen saw was trees, trees, and more trees.<br />
Frantic, she started going deeper into the woods.<br />
Exactly how much farther, she didn&#39;t know, for Karen was now lost.<br />
Then she heard a twig snap.<br />
Frightened, Karen turned in the direction of the noise and snarled, her front teeth now showing more of a feline nature with their pointed, meat rending fangs.<br />
At first, Karen was deathly afraid it was either Marcus or another member of the Gamboni family who had found her.<br />
Then a familiar voice called out, &quot;Karen? Is that you?&quot;<br />
Karen looked and saw a furry were come out from behind a tree to greet her, but it wasn&#39;t exactly who she was hoping for.<br />
&quot;Olivia?&quot; said Karen, recognizing Rich&#39;s friend.<br />
&quot;Yes. Oh my,&quot; commented Olivia, taking a closer look at Karen. &quot;You&#39;re starting your first change. Soon you&#39;ll be a beautiful weretigress like me. Did you get your weretigress birth control pills?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes. I took my first one before coming out here. Where&#39;s Rich?&quot; Karen demanded to know, feeling a deep need to be with him to complete her first transformation.<br />
&quot;He asked me to meet you out here to celebrate your joining were society, and then called to say that he had a flat tire but would be with us as soon as possible,&quot; explained Olivia.<br />
&quot;How soon?&quot; Karen wanted to know, shaking as if she had a bad fever.<br />
&quot;Soon,&quot; promised Olivia, pulling Karen closer to her furry body. &quot;Soon you will become what you are meant to be.&quot;<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; was all Karen said, taking comfort being held by someone who cared.<br />
&quot;You do realize that you and Rich must have full intercourse to complete your first transformation, and then again to ensure your weretigress status. Are you ready to give up both your virginity and your humanity?&quot; asked Olivia.<br />
&quot;Y-yes,&quot; said Karen, holding Olivia close for both emotional and physical support as her whole body quivered again.<br />
&quot;After the very first time, every moment of your new life afterward will be wonderful,&quot; swore Olivia, &quot;and then Rich and I shall show you how great it is to be not only a were, but a tiger too.&quot;<br />
&quot;Promise?&quot; asked Karen, not realizing or caring that her head was resting on Olivia&#39;s bountiful, furry breasts.<br />
Olivia moved one paw until it was underneath Karen&#39;s chin.<br />
Gently, she raised her new friend&#39;s face so that they were looking at each other.<br />
&quot;Promise,&quot; said Olivia, before she brought their lips together and tenderly kissed Karen.<br />
