<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Walking alone in the rain, Michael felt a sense of sadness wash over him. His boyfriend, as a dog, was now at the mercy of a powerful wizard and his daughter who had tried to have her way with him. His father grounded him and now he was going to be stuck in his room all weekend and into next week; though the weather wasn’t ideal to be outside anyway. Worse, he didn’t know 100% whether this plan was foolproof. It had lots of room for error, something that Michael thought about before deciding that he had to try it. There were a million ways this operation could go wrong, but he had hoped that it would somehow find a way to work out in the end. <br />
<br />
Getting home, Michael stepped into his house, drenched from head to door. He stood inside and waited a moment for the water to drip off of him. Michael’s father was not facing him, but could hear him come in.<br />
<br />
“Go to your room” his father said calmly. <br />
<br />
“Give me a minute to dry off” Michael responded. “I didn’t get a chance to get a raincoat or an umbrella before leaving, so I want to dry off first.”<br />
<br />
“You can dry your clothes upstairs. Go.”<br />
<br />
Sighing, Michael took off his soggy shoes and socks and went upstairs, as a puddle formed off of him along his path on the floor. As he headed upstairs, Michael’s father yelled out to his mother. <br />
<br />
“Irene!” his father yelled. “Get a mop and clean up the floors, please!”<br />
<br />
“Clean them yourself!” she yelled back to him. “I’m done cleaning for the day.”<br />
<br />
Sighing, Michael’s father got up to go to the linen closet to grab a mop to wipe up the floor. <br />
<br />
Upstairs, Michael got to his room to put his stuff down. From there, he ran to the bathroom and shut the door behind him, valuing the little privacy he had in his own home. He thought to spend some time in here alone masturbating, but he thought against it. He wasn’t that horny anyway. Wanting to take another shower, Michael stripped off his drenched clothes and hung them over the shower rail. He stepped inside and briefly cleaned up, before drying himself off and heading back to his room.<br />
<br />
Once there, Michael sat at his computer and loaded it up. It took a minute as he didn’t have the fastest model around. His parents were tight on money, so he couldn’t afford to upgrade to a newer and faster one just yet. <br />
<br />
“I wish I had the money to buy myself a new one” Michael thought to himself as he waited patiently for his computer to load. <br />
<br />
When it finally loaded, Michael took a USB stick from the box where the bugs came from and plugged it into an outlet on the side of his computer. After a moment, a screen loaded with a warning. It specified that this software was intended for use by US government officials only and that any unauthorized use could result in criminal prosecution. <br />
<br />
“Jesus” Michael thought to himself. “Where does Diya find these things?”<br />
<br />
Freaking out for a moment, Michael ignored the message as he went into the program and saw a log in screen. Unsure of what to do, he called Diya and asked for her advice. <br />
<br />
“How do I log into this thing?” Michael asked after she picked up the phone. <br />
<br />
“Oh, I forgot to give you the details” Diya responded on the other end. “Can I send you an encrypted message? I don’t want to talk about it on such an open line.”<br />
<br />
“Sure.”<br />
<br />
Michael hung the phone and waited for a message from Diya. After a minute passed by, a message popped up on his phone’s screen:<br />
<br />
“Confidential Message from Diya Ramesh”<br />
<br />
Michael opened the message and typed in a quick passcode before he could read it. It said:<br />
<br />
“L - DRSTFW<br />
 P- IaMh3lP1nGm1cHa3l”<br />
<br />
“Is that really so discrete?” Michael thought to himself, but figured that it was code and should be vague enough to avoid detection by the authorities.<br />
<br />
“Thanks Diya” he texted back.<br />
<br />
“You’re welcome” she responded literally seconds after. <br />
<br />
Michael looked back to the login screen and typed in the username and password that Diya sent him. A ding confirmed that it had been successful. After a moment, the program automatically went into full screen mode and took over the computer to give a brief introductory message.<br />
<br />
“Welcome to the Nano 5000 Bug Analysis Program. Please read instructions before use. Contact 202-925-0000 EXT:2 for technical assistance.”<br />
<br />
“This seems like the real deal” Michael thought to himself as he briefly read the instructions over before clicking on a section called ‘Audio Analysis.’<br />
<br />
The page featured six distinct sound wave sections with various buttons to rewind, record and playback. Michael assumed this was in regards to the bugs and the audio feeds they picked up. On the top of the page, Michael minimized the program so it no longer overtook his entire computer screen. From there, Michael briefly scanned the section before finding a button that said ‘Live.’<br />
<br />
“That must be what activates the bugs” he thought to himself.<br />
<br />
Clicking on the button, Michael saw the blank audio waves light up with a large bit of movement before they settled down into active sound waves. Most of the waves were relatively small, but one in particular was starting to pick up some noise. <br />
<br />
“That must be where Freddy and Sofya are right now” he determined. <br />
<br />
Michael clicked on a button near the wave that said ‘Listen Live’ and heard noises coming from his computer’s speakers. <br />
<br />
“Shit” Michael thought to himself as he got up and ran to find a pair of headphones. <br />
<br />
Michael managed to snag a pair and set up the wireless Bluetooth settings to connect to his computer before he heard a knock on the door. <br />
<br />
“Michael!” he could hear his father yell from the other end of the door. “No movies!”<br />
<br />
“I’m doing my homework!” Michael yelled back. <br />
<br />
“It better be your homework or you’ll be in big trouble.”<br />
<br />
Michael groaned as he heard his father walk away from the door. Putting on his headphones, Michael could hear voices coming in loud and clear. <br />
<br />
“I’ll get it!” he could hear a voice yell in his headphones, not realizing yet that it was Sofya’s. <br />
<br />
Michael continued to listen as he heard Freddy’s friends coming in and chatting amongst themselves. <br />
<br />
“Oh I bet Freddy loves this” Michael sarcastically thought to himself. “He must be absolutely thrilled.”<br />
<br />
He heard the remainder of the conversation leading up to where Daniel asked about the dog lying down next to the couch in the living room.<br />
<br />
“Uh oh” Michael thought to himself as he listened intently. “I hope Sofya doesn’t blow this for us.”<br />
<br />
Returning to the scene at Sofya’s house, Daniel, his friends and Sofya gathered around as they looked down at Fido lying nervously on the floor. <br />
<br />
“Uh….” Sofya replied to Daniel, who had asked about where it came from. “I just got it today.”<br />
<br />
“Cool!” the boy from the baseball team said excitedly. “It’s a pretty cool dog if you ask me. Just the type of dog that a man should have.”<br />
<br />
Fido barked as he happily wagged his tail, appreciative that one of his friends liked him as a dog, as well as a person. <br />
<br />
“Maybe Michael is wrong about them” Freddy thought to himself. “I think he’s just upset, but they’d never say anything bad about me at least.”<br />
<br />
“It doesn’t look like it’s particularly healthy or well trained” Daniel replied dismissively. “Sofya, where’d you find him?”<br />
<br />
“Uh” she replied. “Well he was a stray.”<br />
<br />
“See, a street mutt.” <br />
<br />
Fido growled as some of the other boys shifted in their seats nervously. <br />
<br />
“It seems like a smart dog” a boy from the football team said to Daniel. “It knew you were insulting it.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah right, that dog isn’t so smart. I bet it’s really stupid. Who had it before you did, Sofya?”<br />
<br />
“Uh….” Sofya replied, unsure of whether to be honest or not. <br />
<br />
Though she thought for a moment, she determined that, well…<br />
<br />
“Why should I help them out any more than I already have?” she reasoned in her head. “Especially Michael.”<br />
<br />
After making her decision, Sofya spoke up. <br />
<br />
“Michael Scavolini came over earlier this afternoon and gave me the dog. His father is allergic, so he couldn’t keep it around his house anymore. He didn’t say much about where the dog came from. All he said was that he doesn’t know if it has an owner or not, so I’m going to hold on to the dog until we determine that one way or the other.”<br />
<br />
“Wow” Daniel replied sarcastically. “Well, I’m not that surprised, honestly. I mean, we all know that Michael Scavolini needs to feel in control of his man at all times, so I guess he wanted someone more docile to him than Fred.”<br />
<br />
The boys laughed loudly in their seats. Fido growled, but held back, not wanting to draw too much attention to the fact that he was Freddy Benson.<br />
<br />
“I know” Sofya replied as she sat in a chair. “Tell me about it. That boy is one of the weirdest mother fuckers in the entire world. I mean, he’s so OCD that he kept asking me about when the plumbing was done on this house. I mean, who the fuck cares that much?”<br />
<br />
The boys laughed at Fido whined on the floor. <br />
<br />
“Man” Freddy thought to himself. “If only I were human, I could show Michael that I intend to keep my promise to stand up for him from now on. I hope he’s not mad at me…or too upset if he’s listening in on this.”<br />
<br />
Unfortunately for Freddy, Michael had heard this through the bug&#39;s audio feed and began to internally seethe with rage in his room.<br />
<br />
“Those sons of bitches” Michael angrily thought to himself. “I really hope they trash Freddy so he stops hanging out with those douchebags.”<br />
<br />
Back in Sofya’s living room, the conversation continued. <br />
<br />
“Wow Sofya” Daniel said to her as sat down and looked to her from an opposite chair. “I knew Michael was a little bitch, but I didn’t realize he was OCD as well.”<br />
<br />
“It’s so bizarre” she replied. “And then he kept asking me about where I got the mirror in the dining room from. Like, after I tell you I don’t know one or two times, you don’t go and ask me three more times in a row. Like, really, no one gives that much of a fuck about a stupid fucking mirror.”<br />
<br />
Most of the boys laughed raucously while Fido whined and Duane froze for a moment. <br />
<br />
“Hey Sofya” Duane addressed her. “Are you going to take us around the house so we can see what your dad did with the place?”<br />
<br />
“Later” she responded, while waving her hand to him. “Let’s chat first.”<br />
<br />
“I agree” another boy from the football team replied. <br />
<br />
“Yeah” the rest of the boys on the couch said in unison. <br />
<br />
“Glad it’s settled, then” Sofya replied. <br />
<br />
Duane looked at her warily as Daniel smirked and spoke up. <br />
<br />
“Yeah, that Michael. He’s a freak alright. He hangs out with these nerdy kids who are a bunch of wannabe school shooters. Like, no offense, but, like, they better not go all Parkland on us.”<br />
<br />
The boys continued to laugh as Duane started to get quieter. He felt that this conversation was going too far. Freddy noticed this too and appreciated that at least one friend was willing to hold in their laughter, even if he didn’t stick up for his boyfriend. <br />
<br />
“I know!” Sofya replied with enthusiasm. “And that best friend of his. What’s her name?”<br />
<br />
Sofya snapped her fingers, pretending not to know Diya’s name. <br />
<br />
“You know, Danny. You know. The nerdy girl. The Indian one?”<br />
<br />
“Dinah?” Daniel asked sarcastically, knowing what her actual name was as well.<br />
<br />
“Something like that. Who cares, right?”<br />
<br />
The boys roared with laughter as Michael seethed in his room overhearing this. Diya, listening in on her computer at home, started to sob at hearing this conversation turn to outright bullying of her. She had been listening in for a couple of minutes and couldn’t take anymore. She closed her computer and went to the bathroom to splash water on her face. She left the program running in the background, hoping to have an extra copy recorded in case Michael needed it to send to the police.<br />
<br />
Back in Sofya’s room, Fido looked up at the scene above him; feeling an intense amount of guilt and sadness. <br />
<br />
“You know?” Freddy thought to himself. “Michael kind of has a point. These boys are mean. I mean, I guess I thought it was all in good fun before, but this is going over the line into outright bullying.”<br />
<br />
Fido turned his head to see Duane sitting in a chair, watching the room laugh while showing an expressionless face. <br />
<br />
“At least someone else here agrees with me that this is going too far” Freddy thought to himself. <br />
<br />
After the laughter died down, a third boy from the football team spoke up. <br />
<br />
“That girl Dijah or whatever. I heard her entire house smells like curry and shit.”<br />
<br />
More laughter ensued. <br />
<br />
“I heard that her brother wanted to come to the United States” the boy from the baseball team recalled joyfully “so her parents wanted her to marry him so he&#39;d get a green card. What a fucking weird ass family.”<br />
<br />
Even more laughter followed.<br />
<br />
“And I heard that when she found out that Michael was gay” the first boy from the football team spoke up “she was so depressed, that she wanted to commit suicide. He was the only half way decent looking person who even bothered to give her the time of day.”<br />
<br />
The laughter lasted for over a minute this time as Duane looked to say something, but held his tongue. Fido shed a tear as he looked on in shame at the sad state of affairs of his supposed ‘friends.’<br />
<br />
“What a bunch of jerks” Freddy thought to himself. “After Michael and I break this curse, I’m not speaking to these assholes ever again.”<br />
<br />
“Which is hilarious” Daniel said after the laughter died down “because he’s way out of Freddy’s league.”<br />
<br />
Fido growled again as he looked angrily at Daniel. <br />
<br />
“Yeah about that” Sofya replied “I have some stuff to tell you about Freddy Benson that you’re going to want to know.”<br />
<br />
“Ooh spill” the second boy from the football team said. <br />
<br />
“Yeah, spill” the boy from the baseball team concurred. <br />
<br />
Chants of “Spill!” filled the room as Sofya began to bang on an arm of her chair. <br />
<br />
“Guys guys guys!” she yelled to get them to quiet down. “I’ll spill.”<br />
<br />
Daniel and the other boys eagerly watched her as Duane began to put his hands on his face. <br />
<br />
“So I met Freddy and Michael the day after I moved in. That was, what, Tuesday?”<br />
<br />
“Hey!” the second boy from the football team shouted. “Wasn’t Freddy supposed to be home sick that day?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah!” the third boy from the football team concurred. “He’s been absent all week! What was up with that?”<br />
<br />
“Oooh!” Daniel replied with a tone of excitement in his voice. “Fred’s been playing hooky!&quot;<br />
<br />
He clasped his hands together, gleefully thinking that he could use this information to get Freddy in trouble at school. <br />
<br />
Fido growled again, before being scolded by Sofya.<br />
<br />
“Bad dog! Stop doing that!”<br />
<br />
Fido whined as he continued to listen. <br />
<br />
“I guess that makes more sense” she continued. “I mean, he is a bit of a player.”<br />
<br />
“Liar!” Michael yelled out in his room as he heard a knock on the door. <br />
<br />
“Michael!” his father yelled at him as he banged on the other end of the door.<br />
<br />
“Sorry dad!” he yelled back.<br />
<br />
On the floor in Sofya’s room, Fido had to summon all the strength he had not to growl in that moment. <br />
<br />
“She better not say it” Freddy angrily thought to himself. “I know she’s a lady, but I don’t think I’d be able to restrain myself from biting her.”<br />
<br />
“Fred’s a player?” Daniel asked, excited at hearing this revelation. “That’s so unlike him.”<br />
<br />
“What do you mean?” Sofya asked, curious as to why he would say that.<br />
<br />
“Well&quot; he confessed &quot;normally, Fred’s a bit of a big pussy.”<br />
<br />
Fido quietly growled at hearing this comment. <br />
<br />
“We all call him Michael’s little pet” Daniel continued “because that man is on a leash at all times. I guess unlike this dog down here, Michael neutered his boyfriend a long time ago.”<br />
<br />
Fido growled as Sofya went to sush him.<br />
<br />
“Don’t say that, Daniel” Duane replied. “Fred’s a good guy.”<br />
<br />
“He’s a big pussy, that’s what he is” Daniel replied.<br />
<br />
The boys laughed at this comment, but Sofya remained silent. <br />
<br />
“He’s not that big of a pussy” Duane replied. “He nearly choked your life out on Thursday at lunch.”<br />
<br />
The boys pointed and laugh at Daniel as he became embarrassed and began to blush.<br />
<br />
“Shut up, Duane!” he scolded. “I could have taken on Fred any time, any place. I just got caught off guard, that’s all. Fred is not stronger than me.”<br />
<br />
“You think so, huh?” Freddy thought to himself as he glared at Daniel while Fido quietly growled. “I’m twice as strong and five times as fast as you are. I could catch up to you before you sprinted a foot away from me and beat your sorry ass into the ground where it belongs. And if you don’t shut up, I have it on good authority to bite your face off right now, tough guy.”<br />
<br />
“Sure Daniel” Duane replied sarcastically. “You think what you want.”<br />
<br />
Chuckles and giggles commenced as Daniel told them to stop it. <br />
<br />
“Well regardless of whether or not Freddy is stronger than you” Sofya said “he’s certainly a bit of a repressed ladies man.<br />
<br />
“Fred?” the first boy from the football team asked. “A ladies man?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah” the boy from the baseball team added. “I thought Fred was gay.”<br />
<br />
“I am gay” Freddy thought to himself. <br />
<br />
“Well he may not be straight” Sofya replied “but he’s not 100% gay either. As I was trying to tell you before, the first time I met him on Tuesday, he was ogling me like most boys do. Michael, I could tell, was furious at him as he kept nudging him with his elbow while he stared at my breasts. So on Wednesday, he came over here on his own during when you were all in school and I took him on a tour of the house. We sat down on the couch down right here and started getting to talking. He confessed to me that his relationship with Michael isn’t going so great right now.”<br />
<br />
Fido growled at her, beginning to bear his teeth. <br />
<br />
“So I told him” she continued “that, well, I can give him what that little bitch Michael can’t.”<br />
<br />
Sofya got out of her chair to sit on the lap of one of the football players. The other boys looked on in fascination and lust as she began to rub her fingers through the scruff on his face. <br />
<br />
“I said” she continued as she moved to grab his hands. “That Michael can’t give you these.”<br />
<br />
Sofya took the hands of the burly, hairy football player and placed them onto her breasts. She could feel his penis starting to stir as soon as he spotted an erection in his pants. <br />
<br />
“I told him” she continued as she moved herself onto the lap of another smoother, baby faced football player, grabbing his hands and signaling him to move them into her shirt. “I told him to feel what a woman could give him.”<br />
<br />
The boy started sprouting an erection as he played with her nipples, noticing the hairy football player sprouting wood as well. <br />
<br />
“And so” she went on, moving herself onto the lap of the all American looking baseball player “I leaned in and….” <br />
<br />
Sofya went to lean in to the baseball player and gave him a kiss. He kissed her back as his own erection began to sprout. <br />
<br />
“I kissed him” she finished as she pulled away and got up from the couch to go back to her seat. <br />
<br />
The two football players and the baseball player looked down in their laps, blushing at the sight of their big erections on display. <br />
<br />
“You guys sure are lucky” the third football player said to them, jealously. <br />
<br />
Sofya blew him a kiss as he smiled and slouched in his spot on the couch. <br />
<br />
“Man oh man” Daniel said, with an impressed look on his face. “Fred managed to get with this? Maybe he’s not such a pussy after all.”<br />
<br />
“Well” Sofya said to correct him. “I would have, had Michael not come barging into my house to interrupt him.”<br />
<br />
“Woah! Two boys playing hooky. Maybe they aren’t as straight laced as we all thought.”<br />
<br />
More growling could be heard from Fido. He had to use all of his might not to lash out right there on the spot. This conversation was eating him alive and he was sure it was eating away at Michael as well. He hoped that Michael knew what was being said wasn’t true. He hoped that he knew how much he cared about him. More than anything else, he hoped to avoid having an ‘I told you so’ moment when Michael inevitably would point out, correctly, what a bunch of jerks his friends really were. <br />
<br />
“Well” Freddy thought as Fido looked up to Duane. “Not all of them, at least.”<br />
<br />
Duane saw the smiles on the faces of his friends as they giggled and laughed at Sofya’s gossip. He felt bad about what they were saying about his friend, Freddy. Sure, they had sad similar things about him the past when he wasn’t there, but it never got to the intensity of what was being discussed now.<br />
<br />
“Oh who am I kidding” Duane thought to himself. “It’s always been this bad. For some reason, this time at least, I feel bad about it. I can’t shake the feeling that Fred’s going to find out about this. That girl looks like she has a pair of loose lips on her.”<br />
<br />
Duane didn’t know how right he was, as Fido continued to stare at him. Freddy was appreciative that at least one friend of his didn’t join in on the revelry at his expense, even if he’d wished that Duane would speak up for him more. <br />
<br />
“Well” Freddy thought to himself. “Considering I never did it for Michael, I’d be selfish to expect that Duane would do it for me. Serves me right.”<br />
<br />
“Serves him right” Michael thought to himself as he listened in on the conversation from his room. “I hope Freddy has learned a valuable lesson from all of this. His ‘friends’ are assholes and he shouldn’t be hanging out with them anymore. Especially Daniel, the ‘tough guy’ who thinks he could take him on in a fight. Ha! What a joke.”<br />
<br />
Back in Sofya’s living room, she continued the conversation.<br />
<br />
“So anyways, Michael comes barging in, totally unannounced and uninvited, and spots me about to have the best sex I’ve had in weeks. His dick is poking at me and I know he’s ready to go. I’m about to take off his pants when Michael just has to ruin the moment for us. I guess Freddy sensed he’d be in trouble with Michael, so rather than owning up to the fact that he’s bi and wanted to fuck me like a man should, he ran out of my house screaming like a little bitch.”<br />
<br />
The boys laughed at this revelation, totally unsympathetic to the fact that it had technically constituted rape. <br />
<br />
“He was screaming at the top of his lungs” she continued. “He was like ‘Michael help me!’ like a little girl. I mean, did he really think Michael was going to do anything to protect him?”<br />
<br />
“No way!” the second football player said. “Michael is so weak, even you’d overpower him.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah!” the baseball player concurred. “He’s such a pussy, that you could totally kick his ass!”<br />
<br />
The boys laughed as Sofya smirked at the compliment. Fido growled loudly, on the verge of losing his last nerve over what he was hearing his supposed &#39;friends&#39; say about him and Michael. Sofya went over to the all American baseball player and got back on his lap.<br />
<br />
“You don’t know how horny that comment made me” she said as she put her hand on his still throbbing cock.<br />
<br />
“Woah” the hairy football player replied as she began to grab and play with the baseball player’s dick.<br />
<br />
“Dude nah!” Duane yelled as he got up from his seat. “Uh uh, nah! I’m not participating in no orgy on your couch. No way!”<br />
<br />
“Why?” the third football player asked. “You gay or something?”<br />
<br />
“I’m gay?!” Duane responded incredulously. “Look at you, freaks. You’re the ones sporting erections in front of each other, ready to whip out your dicks and jerk each other off.”<br />
<br />
“They’d be jerking off for me” Sofya replied lustily, as she turned to face him. “Come on. Don’t you wanna join?”<br />
<br />
“On a one on one basis, hell fucking yeah I’d fuck you in a heartbeat! But with other guys around? My dudes? My amigos? My homies? Nah, Sofya. I’m good.”<br />
<br />
“Suit yourself.”<br />
<br />
Sofya turned to the baseball player as she passionately made out with him. <br />
<br />
“I’m going in the kitchen” Duane said as he turned to leave the room. “Anyone else wanna join me?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah man” Daniel replied as he got up from his chair as well. “I’m with you. I’d love to get some of that sweet puss, but not in front of a bunch of other dudes. I’m not like Fred.”<br />
<br />
Fido growled as he watched Daniel and Duane leave to head into the kitchen. He had a decision to make. He could stay and watch the orgy unfolding before him on the couch. Or, he could walk into the kitchen and continue to listen in on what his friends from the track and field team had to say about him when they thought he wasn’t around.<br />
<br />
After thinking about it for a moment, he chose….</p>
