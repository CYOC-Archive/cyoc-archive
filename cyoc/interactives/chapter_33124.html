<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Just when Tracey thought it was over, she saw two more people leaving the house and entering the backyard.  Turns out those two people were in fact Heather and Jennifer’s husbands.  The first husband is named Ralph, a 29-year-old with an athletic build.  His skin was a bit tan, curly body hair on his chest, arms, and legs, and he was showing a little beer belly on the waistline. He had lightly brown hair on his head, a pair of dark brown eyes, and a bit of peach fuzz on his chin.  He was also wearing a pair of black swim trunks, a large white T-shirt, and a pair of strap on sandals.  The second husband’s name is Carlos, a 28-year-old with lightly peach skin.  He has the same build as Ralph but was a little skinny.  He had curly blondish brown hair that goes down to his top neck and blue eyes.  He was sporting dark blue swim shorts, another white T-shirt, and a pair of slip on sandals.<br />
<br />
As the two were outside, Tracey listens in on their conversation.  “I don’t know Ralph,” said Jennifer’s husband Carlos, “I’m still rooting for the Patriots know matter what.”  “Oh c’mon Carl!” Heather’s husband Ralph said, “I don’t understand why you’re on the Patriot’s side and not the Ram’s.  I mean not only you, but everyone in this neighborhood is on the same side.  Our neighbors love the Patriots, my friend’s want the Patriots to win, even the mailman that delivers the mail everyday has a Patriot pin on his mail cap.  Why is everyone want the Patriots to be victorious?”  “Because the Patriots have an incredible winning streak.  That’s why.” answered Carlos; “Maybe you should jump on the Patriot band wagon and respect them for what they’re doing.”  Ralph turned his head away from his friend, crossed his arms, and said, “Oh I’ll respect them, when the Rams beat their sorry asses next game.”<br />
<br />
When Ralph looked at the backyard, he noticed something odd.  On the pool like chairs, two people were missing.  And those two people were in fact Heather and Jennifer.  “Hey, where did our wives go?” asked Ralph looking for Jennifer.  Carlos looked at the chairs and noticed no one was there too and looked around to find Heather.  “Don’t know.  You thin they went back in?” Carl asked.  “If they were coming back in, I would’ve seen them in the house.” Ralph answered.<br />
<br />
As he was looking for his wife, Carlos saw something else strange in the kiddy pool.  In the pool where Emily and Ricky were where two girls the same age as them that he haven’t seen before.  On had short black hair while the other had an orange color type of hair.  In fact, they almost look strangely familiar.  “Hey,” he then said, “who are those kids in the pool with my son and your daughter?”<br />
<br />
Ralph looked at the pool and saw the same thing too.  Rubbing his chin, he thought about it and answered, “You know what, I have no idea who these kids are.  Maybe they’re from the new neighbors we met a few days ago.”  “Really?” asked Carlos, looking more confused then before, “I never thought they had some kids.  The couple we met looked close to their forties and they don’t look like they want to have kids.  Besides, if they were going to take their kids here to play with ours, they would’ve called or something.”<br />
<br />
It was then that Ralph headed back in the house and wanted to do something.  “I’m going to call the new neighbors and see if they have kids.” He said, “Then find our wives.”  That was when Carlos turned his head to see him and wanted something from him.  “While you’re at it, can you get me something to drink?” he asked, “Like a beer or something?”  “Yeah, yeah…” said Ralph, as he reenter the house and get a telephone to call the new neighbors.  As he was doing that, Carlos decided to rest on the lawn chair and take a bit of a tan.  He took of his shirt to show his physic, applied some sun tan lotion that was left behind by his wife, and slept on the chair to get his tan.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Tracey was watching on and discovered she made the biggest mistake she made.  “Oh man…” she said in realization, “I totally forgot to make those two unaware of everything around them.  If they find out those two kids are really their wives, they’ll know something isn’t right.  Gotta fix this quick before it’s too late.”  She went back on her laptop where the reality game is and started fixing this.  As she use the toggle option to make Ralph and Carlos unaware, something just came up in her head.  Tracey looked back at Carl still on the chair and had a devilish smirk on her face.  “Hmm…  Wonder what would happen if I change one of the husbands?” she asked herself.  She turned her head back to the game and clicked on Carl’s character, showing the many options on the menu.  She then moved the pointer to one of the options, but instead of clicking age, she picked gender.  “This should be good.” Tracey said as she clicked on the gender icon.  When she did that, she looked back at the backyard next door and sees Carl’s transformation.<br />
<br />
In the coarse of a few seconds, Tracey noticed he lost a few inches in height.  It was obvious to her that women are a tad shorter then men at their age.  Though it was the most noticeable change, it will be a matter of time before the rest takes place.  In another few seconds, his frame started to diminish, as his muscles began to thin and become a little feminine.  The body hair on his arms, legs, and chest thinned and was shrinking into his skin.  His six pack ads he worked on so proudly faded away as why smoothed out and become a little toned.  He might be a little skinny now, but soon, he’ll be a whole different person.<br />
<br />
Within another few seconds, Carlos was really starting to take some feminine shape.  The nipples on his chest started to grow and poke out.  Soon after, the flesh around his nipple began growing out, making his chest less manly and looking more femalish.  His hips then flared out, making his waist showing signs of being curvy.  All the hair on his body vanished without a trace, leaving his skin completely smooth.  His arms and legs thinned at an alarming rate, loosing all of its muscle tone of a man and replacing it with all the muscle tone of a female.  His hands and feet were now getting small and dainty, as his fingernails grew long and delicate.  And his rear plumped up and rounded to a sexy shape.<br />
<br />
But not only Carlos’s body is changing, his face was changing as well.  His skull structure was rearranging itself and was loosing all its masculine shape.  His nose thinned and grew a little smaller while his lips begin to get a little puffy.  His eyes changed color from dark blue to light green as they look more innocent and girlish.  His Adams apple was receding in his throat and the peach fuzz on his chin vanished without a trace.  His curly hair then grew out and was coming down his neck as his pigment lightened, removing the brown color and gaining the blonde.<br />
<br />
Tracey watched on and was impressed at the fact that she was watching a man turning into a woman right before her eyes.  She couldn’t help but to feel sexually aroused by the metamorphosis that’s happening.  She watches on as the transformation was almost complete.<br />
<br />
Carlos’s breasts continued to grow big, becoming As, to Bs, straight up to CC cups.  His hips and butt was all wide and curvy, making his waist a perfect hourglass shape.  His arms and legs were long, but have a sexy shape of a woman’s.  His hair cascaded down to his back, while the curly style began to straighten and his color was now lightish blonde.  His face was finished the changed as Carlos looked more like a she then a he.<br />
<br />
Soon after his/her body changed, her clothes changed to match her look.  The bottom hem of her swim trunks was rising up to her calves as the top part was lowering down her waist.  Once the two sides here nine inches close to each other, the shorts changed color, lightening from dark blue to bright neon pink.  That was when her swimming shorts have become a pink spandex swimming thong.  Suddenly, a swimming bra with the same pink color appeared around her top part of her body and covered her modesty, making it a complete.  Red lipstick was then magically applied on her supple lips at the same time red nail polish appeared on her nails.  And to finish it off, a wedding wing was on her right index finger.  Within the course of a minute and a half, Carlos had become Carla.<br />
<br />
Soon as her transformation was complete, Ralph came back out of the backyard with a martini in his hand.  So far nothing has changed in his appearance, except for the fact he too has a wedding ring on his finger.  “Well I called the neighbors and they said they never had kids before, so I called the police and told them we got some kids that are lost.  In the meantime, I think we should let them have fun with our kids until the cops arrive.” He said as he placed the drink on the circle table next to Carla, “Here’s your drink honey.”  Carla picked up her drink and then said, “Thanks dear.”<br />
<br />
What the two didn’t know was that Tracey put the toggle option on, making them unaware to the changes.  Their minds have also arranged themselves, altering their realities.  Thought they have no idea who those kids swimming in the pool with their twin son and daughter, they thought they were a married couple.<br />
<br />
When Carla was done drinking, she placed the drink aside and rests on the chair.  That gave Ralph the opening he needed.  Quickly, he approached the chair his wife was on, laid on top of her, and gave her a warm passionate kiss.  That surprised Carla as first, but returned the favor and deepened the kiss.  Once they let go of their lip lock, the stared at each other in loving eyes.  “Oh Carla, I’m so happy that I married you.” Ralph said.  Carla starred at him love gleaming eyes and said back to him, “So do I Ralphy Po, so do I.”<br />
<br />
The two kissed each other for a while longer then stopped again.  That was when Ralph came up with a clever idea.  “You wanna make out right now?” he asked as his wife had his eyes wide in shock.  “Are you sure you want to do it?” she asked him, looking at the kids in the pool, “Especially when our children and these strangers watching?”  “Don’t you worry about that.” Ralph said back, calming Carla, “The kids are too busy to know what we’re doing.  Besides, it’s going to take a few minutes.”  Carla thought about this for a moment and wondered what it would be like to have an orgy outdoors.  After half a minute in thought, she guided her hand down her husband’s crotch and gently rubbed it.  When Ralph felt it, he looked at her very sinfully and said, “I’ll take that as a yes.”  Soon enough, the two made a lip lock and was on the verge on some major groping.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Tracey watched the make out begin soon after Carla’s change took place.  When she saw all that go down, she tapped her finger on the her chin and said, “Hmm…  Not bad for a gender change.”  She then looked at her laptop and saw all the other options she could pick on the reality game.  “Wonder what else I could do?”</p>
