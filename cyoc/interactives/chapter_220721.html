<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Looking out the window of his how, Max sees a man and a young girl get out of a moving truck and start to move thinks into the old house that been For Rent forever. With the type of neighborhood they live in, most people outright buy their homes, not rent, so the house been empty for a while. Max’s mom calls him over, as she was making him breakfast, to eat and not spy on the new family. <br />
<br />
“I am not spying; I am just keeping an eye on my surroundings.” Max replies, quoting a line that his father always says. <br />
<br />
“Right?” His mother replies. “Well, then you can go over after you shower and say hi for us. Your father and I have a meeting with a client today to go over next weekends job.” <br />
<br />
“Why so early?” Max asks. “A lot could change over a week.” <br />
<br />
“He is only able to be in town on the weekends. So, we are going to do a dry run of his plan meetings beforehand.” Max’s mother replies as she plates some eggs and bacon for him. “We will be running all over town, so if you need us, it could be a while before we get back.” <br />
<br />
“Mom, I can handle being on my own. I do it all the time now.” Max replies back. <br />
<br />
Max’s mom lets out a deep sigh as his father comes walking downstairs. He walks over to Max and rubs his hair before taking a seat. “Oh, Laura, our little puppy is just growing up. Don’t be to depress about it.” <br />
<br />
Max gives his dad a “you are weird” look before starting on his breakfast. Though, in Max’s mind, he wondered why his dad called him a puppy. He doesn’t usually talk like that. <br />
<br />
“I know.” Laura replies. “But David, he is still young. And you know I hate leaving him like this.” <br />
<br />
“Hey, just a few more good gigs like the one today, and we can fully retire.” David replies. “Just remember that.” <br />
<br />
“They are paying that good?” Max asks as his father receives his eggs and bacon and his mother sits down with her own. <br />
<br />
“Yeah!” David replies. “He is an old commander of mine and buddy. He is working on some projects and was given a pretty sizable amount for his own security budget. When he heard we worked out here, he called me up and asked if we wanted the job. I mean, he has his guys that follow him everywhere, but it is always good to have locals that know the area. Besides, he is already sending us new clients too from his backers.” <br />
<br />
Max hadn’t seen his father so excited about work in a long time. His father usually hated talking about work, as most of their clients were rich snobs. But Max guesses working with an old friend changes that. <br />
<br />
The three finish their dinner and Max’s parents head off to their job for the day. Max hops in the shower, making sure to change into his wolf form to wash his fur, before cleaning the rest of his body. Once out and dressed, he looks out of the front window again to see that the girl was removing some old-looking weapons from the truck. Some bows with arrows, swords, and other items that he couldn’t even guess what they were. Everything looked to be out of museum. <br />
<br />
He decides that it was time to walk over and say hi. Leaving his house, the girl notices him right away and sets what she has in her hands down. Max looks her over as he crosses the street. She had long black hair, tan silk skin, and seemed to be in shape. Her green eyes stood out to Max most of all.<br />
<br />
Max walks up, waving awkwardly. “Hey, I’m Max. Can I guess you are going to be our new neighbor?” <br />
<br />
The girl snickers at the awkwardness. “Yeah.” She replies. “I’m Julie. Me and my dad are moving in here for a while.” <br />
<br />
“For a while?” Max asks, confused. <br />
<br />
“Oh, my father is a professional hunter. We usually move around a lot to wherever the next big game is. But he wanted to take some time and write a book on his recent exploits.” Julie replies. “It gives me a chance to go to a real school for once and not just learn online.” <br />
<br />
“Oh, where are you going?” Max asks. <br />
<br />
“Riverside Middle School.” Julie replies. “I’m twelve.” <br />
<br />
“Same here.” Max replies happily. “Guess we will be in the same classes. It is a small school, as most of the kids around here go to the private school own my Mr. Leokum.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, my dad met him when we were registering with the HOA.” Julie states with discuss. “He seemed like an ass.” <br />
<br />
“Language.” A man says from the inside. The man walks out, his hands on his hips. He was a white guy, built like a tank, and had the ex-military look to him. Trim hair and beard, clean shoes, nothing on him was out of place. <br />
<br />
“Julie, I know I let stuff slip, but that was uncalled for.” The man scolds. <br />
<br />
“But dad…” Julie starts to protest. <br />
<br />
“I know, he is an ass, but still...” The man replies to his daughter. “You could act a little more proper around new people.” The man then walks over and places his hand out. “Name is Hayden, young man.” <br />
<br />
“Max.” Max replies as he shakes Hayden’s hand. <br />
<br />
As he does, Max feels the Big Bad Wolf power start to recoil. It was as if the power itself was trying to hide. Max didn’t understand this, but also didn’t have time to think about it. <br />
<br />
“I saw that your parents left already?” Hayden asks before returning to emptying out the moving truck. <br />
<br />
“Yes sir.” Max replies. “My parents work as private security. They have a big client this weekend and needed to meet up with them early.” <br />
<br />
 “So, they left you alone for the day?” Hayden asks. <br />
<br />
“It’s all good.” Max replies. “With the trails just on the other side of the neighborhood, there is plenty to do. Julie said you are a hunter; you may like that there is both a state hunting and federal hunting lands out there too.” <br />
<br />
“That’s good to know if I get board from writing my book.” Hayden replies as he takes another box into the house. <br />
<br />
“I would love checking out these trails.” Julie replies. <br />
<br />
“Maybe after we finish the house.” Hayden replies. <br />
<br />
“Then I will leave you two to it.” Max says before turning to return home. “It was great to meet you two.” <br />
<br />
“Great to meet you too.” Julie replies before returning to the truck. <br />
<br />
As Max left and was safely in his home, and Julie walks inside her house with a box, her father walks up behind her. “Hey, before you go off making to many new friends, just remember, we have a job to do.” <br />
<br />
“I know dad.” Julie replies, placing the box on the floor. “We have to find the new Big Bad Wolf and kill it before it can do anyone harm.” <br />
<br />
“Yes.” Hayden replies. “As Huntsman, we are dutybound to bring down all evil magical beasts. Once our job is done, then we can return to our world.” <br />
<br />
“I know dad.” Julie replies. “Just… Let me have this one friend. He is awkward but seems fun.” <br />
<br />
“Fine, but just remember your duty.” Hayden replies.</p>
