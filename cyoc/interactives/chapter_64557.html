<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;... high school football player&quot;<br />
<br />
....<br />
<br />
Mitch was sitting at his desk typing away a memo to some of his <br />
coworkers. The first one in the office, others were beginning to <br />
trickle in.<br />
He glanced at his computer's clock. &quot;Damn. Only 8am. I'm already <br />
hungry,&quot; he thought to himself. As he kept typing the memo, he became <br />
more and more distracted by the clock. He spent five minutes on two <br />
sentances - yet it seemed more like an hour. &quot;Fuck I'm getting <br />
hungry!&quot; <br />
<br />
Just then, Mitch noticed that it was becoming difficult to type. He <br />
kept hitting keys to the sides and above the ones he aimed for. &quot;What <br />
the hell?&quot; He became frustrated as he had to constantly backtrack. He <br />
looked down at the keyboard, where he was surprised to find nothing <br />
different... except for his hands. His hands appeared swollen, fattier <br />
even. He held them up to look at them. His fingers were stubbier, <br />
shorter; there were fatty deposits around his nails that made them <br />
look almost sunken-in. Then they began to grow. The diameter of his <br />
palms increased significantly, slowly, almost as though they were <br />
being inflated. They retained their fatty-ish texture somewhat, but <br />
now a very prominent, strong musculature and bone-structure were very <br />
visible. The nails themselves were now very different. Mitch had <br />
always manicured his fingernails delicately, but these were jaggedly <br />
cut, and very short such that a deposit of skin and fat sat beyond the <br />
nail's end.<br />
<br />
Mitch felt like he was going to vomit. <br />
<br />
In the time it took Mitch to run to the floor bathroom and discover it <br />
empty, the growth had spread up his forearms and into his biceps and <br />
upper back. Mitch tore off his clothing and locked the door. He <br />
watched in the mirror as his arms inflated, seemingly tripling in size <br />
from his former skinny arms. His back simultaneously gained girth, and <br />
his new broad shoulders began to preface two, thick meaty pecs. The <br />
inflation and expansion of his chest was the most disturbing sensation <br />
to Mitch this far; it sent a chill up his spine and a surge of <br />
adrenaline throughout his body. Suddenly his penis was at the ready. <br />
<br />
The growth left two very square, full pectorals on Mitch's upper <br />
chest, with two perfect - if larger - nipples facing forward, and was <br />
now making its way down his torso. His abs pulsed with each heartbeat <br />
as they became visible, his small love handles disappearing, giving <br />
his torso a v-shape. Mitch's mind had already adapted to some of the <br />
changes - he had a teenager's disappointment when the growth did <br />
little to his dick, leaving it at a relatively paltry length, and only <br />
giving it a minimal amount of new circumference. The growth Mitch felt <br />
was surely destined for his beloved rod went straight to his legs. <br />
They exploded with new size and sinewy definition, with calves <br />
powerful enough to be described by the old part of Mitch's mind (still <br />
the majority) as Herculean. <br />
<br />
His feet were the last in this preliminary change. They expanded in <br />
girth so quickly and heavily that his dress shoes gave away to them. <br />
His feet were hairier now and very powerful in appearance. At least <br />
size 13's Mitch concluded.<br />
<br />
Mitch's face had transformed without his attention. He looked into the  <br />
mirror to a face he didn't recognize. He was a shaven head now, with a <br />
protruding brow topped with thick eyebrows. His eyes were the same, <br />
but his nose was now much larger, surrounded by prominent cheek bones. <br />
His lips were thinner now, but only slightly. His face showed little <br />
evidence of hair - much to Mitch's surprise. He was not handsome, but <br />
rugged perhaps. His next change would take that away somewhat. <br />
Suddenly his whole body began to convulse. His definition was <br />
lowering. His pecs began to sag ever so slightly, and his abs <br />
disappeared under a thin layer of fat. His arms were no longer <br />
defined, but were now huge cylinders of mass. His body now matched his <br />
hands. He discovered that his muscles' definition was still visible <br />
when they were activated, so he was not disheartened too much. He was <br />
a high school football player now, but he didn't know it yet. His name <br />
was Mikey, he worked out most days, but still consumed too many <br />
calories to retain the definition that Mitch would currently like. <br />
Mikey doesn't care about definition. Mikey cares about power on the <br />
field. Mikey doesn't care about many things except football. He is not <br />
terribly bright, and does not have any work ethic for anything but <br />
football either. All of this  Mitch was about to learn.<br />
<br />
He stared at his new face in the mirror, a cloud of confusion still <br />
hovering beneath his eyes. Suddenly and overwhelming urge overtook <br />
him. Mitch reached down and took Mikey's dick into Mikey's fat hand. <br />
He began massaging it. A wave of euphoria overtook Mitch as the <br />
confusion began to lift. The cloud in Mitch's eyes changed from one of <br />
confusion to one of simplicity in Mikey's eyes. It was if the jerk-off <br />
session were expelling all of Mitch from Mikey. Mikey was slowly <br />
forgetting Mitch. Mitch was slowly becoming Mikey.<br />
<br />
When Mikey blew his load into the sink, he stared into the mirror. He <br />
flared his nostrils and flexed his muscles to take his mind off the <br />
guilt. He turned around and saw his clothing on the floor next to him: <br />
a pair of gym shorts, a tank, and cross-trainers. He dressed himself <br />
and made his way out of the building. He wasn't going to be their <br />
floor delivery boy anymore now that his senior year of school was <br />
starting. No more time for anything but football. Mikey sauntered out, <br />
not even bothering to wash out the sink.</p>
