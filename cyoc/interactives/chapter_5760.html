<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It took us about 10 minutes to get to Sherman's.  On the way we just chit-chatted about this and that, nothing of any real substance.  Most of the time I was focusing on her incredible body.  She had the perfect hour-glass figure, with a flat stomach and finely toned arms and legs.  She looked like she worked out a little, which was more than I could say for myself, but not so much that she was muscled.  <br />
<br />
Her face was angelic.  There was not a blemish to be seen.  Her cheeks had a slight reddish hue, and her lips were full and inviting.  She wore a light red lipstick that she had put on perfectly.  What I was also surprised by was that she only wore one pair of earrings.  It seemed like every other girl anymore had at least 5 small pieces of metal embedded in their ears.<br />
<br />
Most of all my eyes were focused on her breasts.  I couldn't help but be shallow in this regard.  I mean, they were right there in front of me, swaying slightly from side to side with each step.  That would grab the attention of any male my age.  <br />
<br />
I realized that I had too much of a good thing here.  It wouldn't be right of me to take advantage of her in this way, even if she didn't know about it.  So I wished that her clothes would reappear the way they were before I made them disappear, and that she and no one else besides me would notice they reappeared.<br />
<br />
In an instant her clothes returned and she continued like nothing had changed.  Out of curiosity, I looked down at her feet and saw that the sandals I had wished on her were still there.  I guess my wish didn't specify footwear, so her normal shoes didn't return.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well here we are,&quot; she said.  We had made it to the diner.<br />
<br />
&quot;After you,&quot; I said, holding the door open for her.<br />
<br />
She smiled and added, &quot;Such a gentlemen.&quot;<br />
<br />
We walked into the diner and looked for a couple of seats.  &quot;Let's just sit at the counter,&quot; she said.  This was surprising.  I didn't think any girl would want to do that.  We sat down and waited for the waitress to take our order.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you going to order?&quot; I asked her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you ever had their Monte Cristo sandwich?  It's great,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I haven't,&quot; I confessed.  &quot;I'm surprised you would eat something like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
She flashed her pearly whites at me once more and said, &quot;There's a lot of surprising things about me.  Come on, let's both get it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OK,&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
The waitress walked up to us and said, &quot;Hi, I'm June.  What can I get you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We'd like two Monte Cristo sandwiches with fries, and two large Cokes,&quot; Kelly ordered.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK,&quot; the waitress said, &quot;Coming right up.&quot;<br />
<br />
June had waited on me a couple of times in the past, but not enough for her to remember me.  I always thought she seemed to good to be working in a diner.  She looked rather young, mid-20s at oldest, and still attractive even though her hair was tied up and her uniform was dirty.<br />
<br />
I looked over at Kelly to see that she was looking at June as well.  &quot;Makes you wonder,&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
Kelly snapped out of her trance and agreed, &quot;Yea.  I always wonder why she's working here.  She's waited on me before once or twice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me too,&quot; I added.  &quot;I've never had the nerve to ask her why she works here.&quot;<br />
<br />
June came back with our Cokes and placed them down in front of us.  While she reached under the counter to pull out two straws, Kelly said, &quot;I hope you don't mind, but you've waited on me before and I've always wondered, why are you working here?  You seem too young to work here.&quot;<br />
<br />
June picked up the straws, lifted up and looked at us.  With the straws still in her hand she said, &quot;You're the first people to ever ask me that.  To be honest, it's because I couldn't afford college.  I tried to save money but it became impossible when my father died.  Now I work to pay the bills.&quot;  I could see tears well up in her eyes.  She put the straws on the counter and did not move away.  &quot;I can tell you two are still young,&quot; she said.  &quot;Make sure you don't waste this time you have.&quot;  She walked back to the kitchen, quickly covering her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;That wasn't good,&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel horrible now,&quot; Kelly said.  &quot;I didn't mean to make her upset.  Sorry for being such a drag.&quot;<br />
<br />
I put my hand on her arm and said, &quot;It's not your fault.&quot;  She seemed to smile with the small bit of comfort I offered.  This situation got me thinking.  I could easily help June with this ring.  But at the same time I wanted to make Kelly feel better.  I had to involve her in this, too.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kelly, I have something to tell you that's going to seem weird.  Very weird,&quot; I added.  She turned in the stool to look at me, an inquisitive look at her face.  I quickly told her the story of the old lady and how she gave me the ring.  I wasn't willing to tell her that I wished her clothes away, though.  So I lied and said I had made something else happened.<br />
<br />
Finally she burst out laughing.  She stopped a little and said, &quot;Joe, that is the biggest come on I've ever heard.  Couldn't you have just come up with something less childish?&quot;<br />
<br />
A little upset that she thought I was hitting on her, I knew I had to prove it.  &quot;OK, then.  I'll prove it.  We ordered only 5 minutes ago, right?&quot;  She nodded.  &quot;So there's no way it could be done right?&quot;  She nodded again.  &quot;Well I wish that our food was ready now and is being brought to us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice try, Joe,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
Just then the kitchen door flung open and June appeared carrying two plates of food.  She set them down and said, &quot;Two Monte Cristos, two sides of fried.&quot;  She looked at the utterly dumbfounded expression on June's face and said, &quot;Is something wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kelly shook her head and said, &quot;No.  I-I...I'm sorry I upset you before.&quot;<br />
<br />
June scoffed and said, &quot;Don't worry about it.  I just let my emotions get the better of me.  I was actually happy to know that there are people who care.  I'll check back in few minutes.&quot;  She returned to the kitchen.<br />
<br />
With a smile on my face I picked up the sandwich and said, &quot;Better eat before it gets cold.&quot;  I bit into the sandwich and liked the taste immensely.  I turned back to look at Kelly, swallowed and said, &quot;Mmm.  Really good.&quot;  She still had the same frozen expression.  I picked up her sandwich and beckoned her to eat it.  Without changing the look on her face, she took it from me and started to eat.<br />
<br />
June stopped back and saw we were OK.  When she retreated into the kitchen again, Kelly was finally able to find the words.  &quot;You were telling the truth.  That's--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Amazing?&quot; I interrupted.  &quot;Unbelievable?  Unreal?&quot;<br />
<br />
This time she interrupted me.  &quot;Yea, all of them.  What else can it do?&quot;<br />
<br />
I told her, &quot;I don't really know.&quot;  Of course I was partially lying.  &quot;Anything you want to see happen?&quot;</p>
