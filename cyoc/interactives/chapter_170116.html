<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Looking at your naked body in the mirror, you notice first that your body hair is receding. Your Scottish heritage had you coated in a dense layer of hair from head to toe, but now your body is left smooth other than a neat dusting under your arms and a small treasure trail leading from your navel to your neatly trimmed blonde pubes. You then feel a pulling in your groin as your dick starts to swell, it was sizeable before but now it is swelling to porn-star proportions-- absolutely massive. Finally you feel a sharp stinging feeling on your large left bicep, and are startled to discover a tattoo fading in-- what looks to be a small star coloured with red, white and blue stripes. You continue staring into the mirror, sure that more changes must be coming... but nothing else happens. You reach down to pick up your towel, but it has disappeared and in its place is a small piece of red fabric. You hold it up and realize it is a red speedo. With nothing else to cover up with within reach, you have no choice but to put it on if you want to avoid Ronnie checking out the changes he wrought. Hm... you get a strange, warm feeling when you think of Ronnie but can&#39;t quite put your finger on it. You pull on the speedo and it fits perfectly, although your insanely large packages leaves little to the imagination in the tight red speedo that hugs your crotch and muscular bubble butt. You thought you liked the hair but without it you can really see just how amazing your muscles look.<br />
<br />
You leave the bathroom and return to confront Ronnie. He is still sitting as his desk, looking at you with anticipation, but as he sees you his face drops. &quot;I thought crushing the beans and mixing them with your protein powder would work, but you look the same. But what&#39;s with the speedo?&quot; But then his eyes move to your bulge and his jaw drops open. You reply &quot;I don&#39;t know what beans you used but the changes were pretty small.&quot; Ronnie smiles wide as you say that. Wait... did you hear yourself correctly? You repeat: &quot;the changes were pretty small&quot;. Yep, you heard correctly. Your Scottish brogue has been replaced with a pretty basic American accent. As that realization clicks, some new memories come flooding in. You are an American exchange student studying politics in the UK. Still 19, still not doing all that well academically. You guess that since soccer isn&#39;t as popular in America, this reality has decide to make you a swimmer. You glance up at your side of the room to see that your football posters have been replaced with images of men in pools, swimming and... often shirtless or... even just men standing in speedos? You&#39;re getting a funny feeling looking at these men. Your eyes go next back to Ronnie and you see him in a new light. Your attention is drawn to his inflated ass. You feel an uncomfortable tightness in your groin, and at first you think another transformation is starting before you realize that it&#39;s just your first erection with your monster cock, and the speedo wasn&#39;t really designed to contain it. You peel the speedo off and allow your cock to stand at full mast while your boyfriend looks on eagerly. Wait... boyfriend? No that is your best friend Ronnie... the kid who you barely even knew yesterday... but the more you look at him the more you feel your memory flooding with fond feelings for him. Now you realize Ronnie&#39;s plan, and it worked. You are a gay American and Ronnie is your boyfriend.<br />
<br />
Before any more words are spoken your instincts take over and you pull Ronnie into a deep kiss. You start to unbutton his skinny jeans and pull them off while he removes his crop top, revealing his lithe frame and pierced left nipple. You found it repulsive moments ago but now it is really turning you on and you use your tongue to circle the nipple and it&#39;s silver ring. His pants and underwear now off, you see the tiny cock that Ronnie was looking upset with earlier. It&#39;s also fully erect, but looks like a tiny nub compared to yours. But you know that his dick size is irrelevant, and you turn him around and press him up against your desk, revealing the full juicy glory of the twink&#39;s bottom. You open a drawer in your desk, unwrap a size XXL condom and slide it tightly onto your own shaft, all without taking your attention away from Ronnie and the tongue job you&#39;re performing on his nipple. Once the condom is securely in place and a generous amount of lube applied, you enter Ronnie&#39;s ass for the first time (even though your new memories tell you this is far from the first). His massive ass is clearly used to penetration from your cock, and you begin to slide in and out with ease, surprising yourself with how naturally this is coming to you. Somewhere in the middle of all of this you have a moment of clarity, realizing just how much the jellybeans have changed you for this to be happening, but the moment passes quickly as you enter a powerful moment of climax and you and the ginger twink both finish at the same time.<br />
<br />
After you and Ronnie have recovered and cleaned up a bit, you both sit close, still naked on your bed as you ask in your new American voice &quot;so what beans exactly did you use, have we learned anything about them?.&quot; Ronnie responds in posh high-pitched British &quot;well you seemed really happy with your new life and I didn&#39;t think you&#39;d want to eat more beans willingly, so I found three beans and crushed them into your protein powder so that I wouldn&#39;t have to be left out while you lived your great new life.&quot; Wait... THREE beans? &quot;Do you have any idea what eating three at once could have done to me? What did they look like?&quot; He looks frightened by your angry tone (is that how I sounded before? Maybe Americans really are louder...) but instinct takes over again and you place a hand gently on his thigh, smiling and encouraging him to answer you. &quot;Well, one was the same as the bean that turned me gay, and one was the opposite of the last bean I ate. It was aubergine shaped but the arrows pointed upward&quot; Ah, so his made him a bottom and yours made you a top. That explains your new package. &quot;Then, I knew that you were a little annoyed with your Scottish accent, so I found a red and white striped bean that I thought would turn you English again, but I guess it must have actually been an American bean... sorry.&quot; You were finding it very difficult to stay mad at him, even though you knew you wanted to be... but his cute face and puppy dog eyes were really melting your heart. &quot;Well, let&#39;s just make an agreement now, okay? Neither of us will force the other to eat any beans they don&#39;t want to. Deal?&quot; Ronnie nods as you embrace again and cuddle together for a while before drifting off to sleep in each other&#39;s arms. Maybe this change wasn&#39;t so bad?</p>
