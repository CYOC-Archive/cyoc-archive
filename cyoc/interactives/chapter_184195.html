<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">4 hours since Kyle&#39;s call<br />
<br />
Just as Jake were about to go ruin the bathroom, he felt a sticky note between his hand the bathroom doorknob. Jake sighed as he remembered that the freshman from Calculus II who he teased with his 1 1/2 foot cock wanted to &quot;make some worldwide changes&quot; or something from the town curse. He took a quick look around to see if anything about the house he, Fred, and Kelly bought and Felix + Kaid moved into changed, or if anything about his sexy, alluring, anus-destroying body had changed. Everything looked normal, so he began reading<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Jakey, how&#39;ve you been doing? I know you don&#39;t recognize any of the changes to you or your &#39;roommates,&#39; but I&#39;m more than confident that you _felt_ it. Honestly, my new memories of you flopping and hitting me with your giant man pole is giving me a boner- one that both you, Fred, and &#39;Felix&#39; will be mad at not having. If your still confused, then try smelling the grass. Man, rewriting the world is soooo fucking hot.&quot;<br />
<br />
You backed away from the door and thought for a moment. Is this why Kyle never stopped you from pouring your crotch all over him? Looking back, your football bros actually got more mad at you then Kyle ever did. Back up though, how did he know about the 3 of you being jealous? Like, everyone was jealous of the fact that his small body had a masterpiece as tall and wide as a person and beanbags that dragged across the sidewalk, but it seemed like it was only you three who were actually mad at how much the slut ignored it and dedication to subbing.<br />
Still, the weirdest part was definitely him apparently already have &quot;felt&quot; the changes. Other than being hornier than usual, he didn&#39;t actually feel any different today. Maybe it was... Felix? The wording was like an innuendo- &quot;felt inside&quot; than feel an emotion or bodily change -and Felix was (surprisingly) the only person he&#39;s fucked/&quot;felt&quot; since the call. There was also the quotation marks around &quot;roommates&quot; and &quot;Felix.&quot; It&#39;d be one thing if all 4 of them were like that, but Fred&#39;s name was clear.<br />
So what is Felix? Is Fred cool? What about Kelly and-<br />
<br />
&quot;Jakey?&quot;<br />
The bathroom door opened, and out came Kaid. Unlike the jock Jakey, the bottom-heavy &quot;Felix,&quot; the bear Fred, and the stoner Kelly, there wasn&#39;t really a physical stereotype Kaid had under his belt. He had a healthy chub, not-to muscular limbs, a complete 6&#39; height, and an average face. The most notable things about him were his average penis- just 8 inches -and his award-winning oral. Despite his shyish nature, he was an underground celebrity that won medals, trophies, plaques, and dildos for his wide mouth and smooth throat. He even had medication that makes stomach acid less painful in the common event of a judge getting too into it and dipping their penis too far in. Even he was so accomplished, he was bashful and didn&#39;t like others mentioning them.<br />
&quot;J-Jakey? Are you alright?&quot;<br />
Jakey abruptly stopped thinking about face-fucking Kaid and was brought back into reality. He remembered the situation at hand and tried to end the conversation before it began.<br />
&quot;U-Um, yeah I just need to go on a walk.&quot;<br />
&quot;H-Huh? But what about your dick?&quot;<br />
Jakey looked down and saw that his 20-inched tube had began leaking. He noticed that his cum bulge shrunk a little and felt around his butt, taking note that &quot;Felix&#39;s&quot; cum had already made his butt bigger.<br />
&quot;Eh, I&#39;ll just get some foxy slut to suck it. Just keep showering.&quot;<br />
Left confused and maybe even disappointed, Kaid walked back into the bathroom and drew another shower.<br />
<br />
Jakey wasn&#39;t trusting of anyone at the moment- well except Fred, but he&#39;s doing DILF shit. He walked back downstairs and saw that &quot;Felix&quot; was making out with some guy&#39;s chest. He soon made the common household discovery that the guy was just his deity-like dick. The hung-af twink loved licking and sucking his 40 inches of Zeusian meat when no one else was. Just as common as the make-out masturbation, Jakey&#39;s boner flexed between his pecs and came a little on his face and his milkers. He wiped the juices away and faced a battle with himself.<br />
On one hand, he was quickly getting sick of Kyle&#39;s bull and wanted to find out what&#39;s going on; but on the other he wanted to sensually suck the cum off, play with the cute Adonis in the living room, and later put Kyle &quot;in his place.&quot; It was a hard call, but eventually logic won over emotion and he shook the sperm off. The trial, however, was just a prelude to how much Jakey&#39;ll have to hold in.<br />
&quot;He~e~ey Jake~ey, cum back for moar~?&quot; breathed Felix through the musk-filled floor, he and his Apollo-ian syringe chaining Jakey to the spot like an obedient dog. In comparison, his measely 2 feet of bliss started to leak precum all over his pecs and neck, draping the shadow of the stud&#39;s bull cannons like a sticky waterfall. His tongue fell out of his mouth and tried to get a taste of his own salty flesh, his own musk keeping his mouth a wide o-face. His legs, barely functioning at this point, took a decade to escape the sex sauna, but eventually they ran into the front door. His cocktail of white smut mix was near bursting. His hand flicked the handle until the door open and he was freed of the powerful, horny aura.<br />
&quot;...Sucks to be him,&quot; said Felix as he yelled for Kaid&#39;s fuckholes.<br />
<br />
He stepped outside and pulled his dick out of the chest pocket. Trying abstinence in that house was a fool&#39;s game, and now he had to be relieve himself his masochism. He gripped tightly with both hands as the veiny fire hose doused the entire front yard with pure, salty white cum. Each ejaculation was like a blob of slime being spawned into creation. Soon, after 5 minutes of loud moans and intense thrusting, the front yard was a sea of salty goodness and the daze of euphoria began to wipe away.<br />
Jakey let go of his cock, letting the 18 flaccid beau slap against his knee-low balls. He was definitely not gonna properly smell the grass, but he knew that that was just a condescending way of telling him where to go. He looked around the outside world and...</p>
