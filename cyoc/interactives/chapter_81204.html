<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When morning broke, Matt was the first to wake. He stretched his arms and stood out of bed. He noticed the <br />
room was smaller, then remembered the events of yesterday. Looking down, he had definitely gotten younger. He <br />
was probably 15 years old again. His broken back was a thing of the past, now as good as new. He would of <br />
jumped for joy if he hadn't turned around to wake Jake. His friend was still an old man, peacefully slumbering <br />
on his back with drool in his white beard. He nudged Jake awake, who swatted at him with his hands, saying he <br />
wanted 5 more minutes. Matt pulled on his beard, which certainly woke the man with a yelp. &quot;Ow! What did you <br />
do that for? It's attached to my face!&quot;. He rubbed his sore cheeks, then saw his friend was young again. He <br />
hopefully looked down at his own body, only to be saddened to see his fat body coated with white hair. He laid <br />
back down in bed, hoping it was a dream, but Matt's continued attempts to keep him awake proved it wasn't. &quot;I <br />
knew whatever that man said was too good to be true. Of course I'd be unlucky enough to be stuck at 60. Oh <br />
man, I'm the oldest person in my family now!&quot; He put his head into his hands, ready to cry.<br />
<br />
Matt rubbed his friend's furry back and tried to comfort him. &quot;Well look on the bright side, you don't have to <br />
go to school. I think you might even be old enough to be retired. Plus you're still pretty attractive for your <br />
age&quot;.<br />
<br />
Jake smiled at his friend's comments. &quot;Figures you'd be into older men. But I don't want to be retired. I want <br />
to be a kid. School wasn't that bad&quot;. He twisted his body to get out of bed, groaning as he stood up and felt <br />
that pain in his knee again. &quot;Well I can't mope about in sadness. I have to go back to that man to see if he's <br />
found anything in his research that could make me younger again&quot;.<br />
<br />
Matt stopped him and said &quot;First, I think we should get ready and have something to eat. It's only 6 in the <br />
morning, I doubt he'd even be awake&quot;. <br />
<br />
Jake nodded, his belly growling. &quot;OK, I'll go make us breakfast. You go and find some clothes to wear. I think <br />
my dad has a pile of his old clothing that he's been saving for me for when I was old enough, but I don't <br />
think they'll be of use to me now. They should be under the bed&quot;. Jake made his way downstairs, hoping it <br />
would be over soon. He'd left the clothes he'd borrow from his neighbour on the armchair, thinking he wouldn't <br />
need them again. He put them on, a little tighter than they should be, and almost threw his back out as he <br />
yanked his pants on. He was starting to get used to his weird body quirks, and wondered whether he wanted to <br />
get younger. The stray thought scared him. Of course he wanted to be younger! He didn't want to be fat and <br />
hairy for the rest of his shortened life. But maybe being old wasn't too bad. He certainly liked his beard, <br />
and he was getting used to his bare scalp. And as his friend said, he was still attractive, in a faded beauty <br />
type of way. Even if he could get younger, maybe he'd only stop at 45 so he could continue his friendship with <br />
Graham next door. The clock man did mention something about a token that could change reality to make him fit <br />
at whatever age. He opened the fridge door and grabbed some bacon, fishing out a frying pan to put it in.<br />
<br />
Matt found the clothes his friend was talking about, and while going through them, his hand felt something <br />
hard. It was the clock! He thought Jake had left it at the clock shop. He knew he shouldn't tamper with it, <br />
but he didn't want to be a teenager again, not with all those awkward growing phases. He wanted to be on the <br />
other side of puberty where he was tall and hirsute. He remembered once using a timer in the home when he and <br />
Jake would make cakes. He dug through the drawers until he found it. He always wondered why it was kept in his <br />
parents' room instead of the kitchen. He set it for 10 minutes, then turned on the clock, still set at its <br />
position at 1 year a minute. He left them next to each other, knowing he'll turn the clock off once the timer <br />
stopped. He stuffed the second-hand clothes back under the bed and started looking through the wardrobe, <br />
trying to find something suitable for his potential adult body, as he went through another growth spurt.<br />
<br />
Jake had cooked a large breakfast with all the works. He left some aside for Matt to have when he came <br />
downstairs and dug into his own meal. It wasn't long until his hunger had been satisfied. Rubbing his belly, <br />
he started to wonder why he wanted to be a kid again. He had a nice body, big and round but not soft. He was <br />
bald, but the amount of body hair he had more than made up for it. He did have that pain in his knee, one that <br />
he'd probably need to get a cane for so it didn't hurt as much when he walked, but it built up character and <br />
he'd look classy with a cane. And maybe a pair of glasses would be nice, his vision slightly blurry. He was <br />
stirred from his weird thoughts by a loud buzzing from upstairs, followed by loud thumping as Matt ran to turn <br />
off the noise. He wondered what was going on, trying to keep his unwanted desire to stay old at bay, then he <br />
heard footsteps come down the stairs. He turned in his seat to greet Matt and to tell him food was on the <br />
side, but he was shocked when a man came in, wearing his dad's clothes. He had a short beard covering his <br />
handsome face and he stood much taller than Jake, and definitely more toned. His shirt barely reached the band <br />
of his jeans, and the top buttons were undone to show off the hair coating his chest. &quot;Hey dude, check me <br />
out!&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god Matt, you made yourself older again? Haven't you already learnt we shouldn't be doing that?&quot;.<br />
<br />
Matt laughed and said &quot;Chill out, I found a timer in one of the drawers. I didn't want to be a teenager, so I <br />
set the timer for 10 minutes and forced myself to turn off the clock once it went off, and it worked. I'm 25 <br />
years old now. Look at my beard! And my chest hair! I didn't get to experience being a young adult yesterday <br />
because I went straight to elderly, so this is just awesome&quot;. <br />
<br />
Jake was disappointed in Matt. But he could see why he wanted to be older, given his own worrying thoughts. He <br />
just put his hand to his face and slid it down, mumbling &quot;OK, there's some food on the side. I'm going to find <br />
out where this guy lives so we're ready to leave straight away&quot;. He got up from his seat while Matt greedily <br />
grabbed his food, and went to find his computer. He may be old, but he certainly hadn't forgotten how to use <br />
the machine, getting directions to the man's house in minutes. It was all the way on the other side of town. <br />
How were they going to get over there? He didn't know how to drive, and besides his parents had taken the car <br />
with them. They could of used public transportation, but a quick search found the buses didn't run on Sundays. <br />
There was no way they could walk there because it would take hours. He could call a taxi, but he had no idea <br />
where his parents kept the spare money. He rubbed his forehead in thought. Surely there was a way to get to <br />
the man's place otherwise he wouldn't of told them to meet there. <br />
<br />
Matt had come into the room now, scraps of food stuck in his beard. He looked cheerful and walked up to his <br />
old friend. &quot;What's up? You getting too old to understand how the internet works?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, no. I found the guy's place, but he's close to where that bowling place is. It's ages away. I can't <br />
drive, there are no buses, and I have no money for a cab. Can you think of any ideas?&quot;.<br />
<br />
Matt stroked his chin, realising how messily he'd eaten, then said &quot;Maybe we could use my dad's car. He's <br />
shown me what different things do in there&quot;. <br />
<br />
Jake thought about this, then realised something &quot;Dude, your parents haven't left for the weekend like mine <br />
right? Why haven't they tried contacting you about where you are?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I dunno man, we never really talk anyway. Hey, what about that guy next door? Grant? He could give us a lift <br />
if we explained our situation&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Graham, and that's an option I guess&quot;. Jake glanced at the address again, then noticed the paper it was <br />
written on had a phone number on the back with 'CALL NUMBER IF STUCK' next to it. Maybe it was the clock man's <br />
phone number. He could come to them with the solution instead.</p>
