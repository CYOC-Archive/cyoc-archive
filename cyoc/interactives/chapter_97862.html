<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Time passes quickly when you spend most of it sleeping. Days became weeks, weeks became months and months became years. While your adult mind might have once resented your new life you&#39;ve now come to except your werewolf parents as your true family. You still have memories of being an adult and being human, but the idea of being anything other than a werewolf now seems absurd to you. Your old adult life was something alien to you now, something that sometimes came to you in dreams and you tended to forget about soon after waking. Though, it did give you some advantages. You learned a lot faster than any of the other kids this age. After all, you already knew the material you just had to relearn it. This early in your life it just meant things like learning to talk and walk again. Of course there was also one other lesson you had to learn, changing form.<br />
<br />
For the first two years of your new life you spent 100% of your time in your new wolf form. It wasn&#39;t until after your second birthday that you had started to learn to change forms. It was awkward at first, and sometimes you&#39;d make mistakes like forgetting to give yourself thumbs or forgetting that humans don&#39;t have tails. You also started to gain a real dislike for human ears since it made it harder to hear. Eventually though you could become a human 100% at will, and even learned to change into a normal four legged wolf instead of the bipedal wolf form you had lived as for so long.<br />
<br />
One advantage to being a werewolf you were far more physically capable in both your human and wolf forms than any normal person would have been at your age. You were walking way earlier than you should have been able to, and able to run on two legs easily while a toddler. By the time you were old enough to attend kindergarten you were capable of a wide variety of athletic stunts.<br />
<br />
 Five years had passed and you were the very image of a healthy and happy werewolf cub.<br />
<br />
But today, today things were going to be different. Today was your first day of school. You had been enrolled in kindergarten and were starting today.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you ready for school yet?&quot; Your mom called to you from downstairs. You were upstairs in your room you had been packing your new backpack of everything you could possibly need. This mostly included snacks, as an after thought you managed to stuff a few pencils and pieces of paper in there before heading downstairs to let your mom know you were ready to go.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m all ready!&quot; You shouted happily as you got down the stairs with your backpack slung over your shoulder. You had already shifted into human form. One thing your parents had stressed to you that was very important was around other humans you had to stay in human form no matter what. This was... usually pretty easy but on occasion if you got really excited you couldn&#39;t help but wolf out; and being a five year old meant that you got really excited a lot.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahem.&quot; Your mother replied as she looked at you. &quot;Aren&#39;t we forgetting something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Awwww okay.&quot; You had actually been mostly human form, but still had a gray wolf tail extending from the back of your spine that was wagging happily. With a sigh you willed the tail to shrink away into nothing until you were 100% better.<br />
<br />
&quot;Better, but you&#39;re still not quite ready.&quot; Your mom said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eh?&quot; You reached up to touch your ears to make sure they were human and checked your body, as far as you could tell everything was human and you didn&#39;t have any wolfish qualities.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Your mother seemed to think what as wrong was obvious. &quot;Clothes Blackpaw. Humans wear clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Werewolves didn&#39;t have have any form of nudity taboos, nor was nudity by itself enough to make anyone of your species feel awkward. You were human once and you probably should have found running around naked more awkward but after your regression it had been two years before you ever wore clothes again. Even then, 90% of the time regardless of what form you were in your ran around naked. Clothing was something that you wore only when going out among the humans. Apparently, most humans didn&#39;t run around naked and doing so around them was a good way to get in trouble. You used to know why that was but you couldn&#39;t remember anymore. Now, nudity felt normal and with even your human body being far more durable and stronger than normal you didn&#39;t have a physical need for clothes. They just felt awkward and heavy on you. Still, despite that your parents were insisting that you had to wear clothes to school, and you didn&#39;&#39;t really understand why.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I do just a shirt?&quot; You asked hoping that would be enough.<br />
<br />
&quot;No. Fully dressed. Shirt, trousers and shoes.&quot; Your mom replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;SHOES!?&quot; Shoes you had come to conclusion were now the devil. All they did were hurt your feet and make you run slower, but you recognized your mom&#39;s tone of voice and knew this wasn&#39;t up for debate. You returned upstairs and came back a few minutes later fully dressed for the day in a plain t-shirt, shorts and a pair of shoes. Your clothes weren&#39;t the most expensive things in the world. When you belong to a species that doesn&#39;t actually usually wear clothing, and tends to sometimes wolf out and destroy what outfit they were wearing for you tend to buy the cheapest outfits available.<br />
<br />
&quot;Better.&quot; Your mom said. &quot;Your dad should already be in the car let&#39;s go.&quot;<br />
<br />
She helped you into the car and on the drive to school your parents went over things they had been going over for the last few months. Reminders that you had to stay in human form, had to keep your clothes on, and you couldn&#39;t tell any of the other kids about being a werewolf. One thing they did remind you was that your teacher was aware of your species, and there were a few other kids in the class who were non-human. This was arranged so that if any student felt they were going to transform and couldn&#39;t stop the teacher would do her best to get you out of sight of everyone else in the school so you could change forms safely. You were told if you had any emergencies to go through your teacher instead of anyone else at the school since her and a few of the administrators were the only ones that knew the truth about what you were.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t long before you were at the school, the first day tons of kids and parents were there as children were being escorted to their first class. It was a little overwhelming just in terms of stimulation. You tried to calm yourself and tried to tap into your own adult memories that you knew you could handle this. Still, you found yourself clinging to your mom&#39;s side as she escorted you into the building before a large desk where there was a receptionist.<br />
<br />
&quot;The student&#39;s name?&quot; The receptionist asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Blackpaw.&quot; Your mom answered. She saw the receptionist give her a look and immediately corrected herself. &quot;That&#39;s last name Black first name Paul.&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul Black. That was the name you were to go by at school. You didn&#39;t understand it to much you just had it explained to you that humans had different naming conventions and so you had to pretend your name was Paul while in school and around humans.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I see.&quot; The receptionist replied. &quot;Huh another one in Ms. Beldam&#39;s class. She&#39;ll be in room 14A.&quot; With that your mom took your hand again and led you down to the classroom to meet your teacher and new classmates.</p>
