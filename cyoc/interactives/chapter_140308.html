<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With Kumiko and Lisa happily admiring their transformations, Mary turned to Katie and Kellie; a triumphant smile plastered on her childish face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty cool huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah you did great Mary,&quot; Katie giggled. &quot;But dont get too cocky. I think its my turn now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary Elise, Kellie, and Karen now curiously gazed at the girl, wondering what she was planning. &quot;So what you thinking Katie,&quot; Karen asked. Katie rubbed her chin thoughtfully, she wasnt quite sure. She had already turned the entire group into seven year olds, complete with matching nightgowns. &quot;Not sure,&quot; she sighed. &quot;I mean we just became seven. I dont want to grow the group up just yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you could make us mentally younger,&quot; Kellie offered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh no thanks,&quot; Mary Elise said quickly. Karrn turned to her friend, curious why she seemed so quick to dismiss the idea. &quot;What is that anyway,&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Mary Elise sighed. &quot;Right now we only look younger. The spell Kellie suggested would make our minds younger. You would actually think you were seven years old.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow,&quot; Karen stated in awe. &quot;That sounds incredible. I didnt know your ring could do that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie nodded as she looked at her ring. She hadnt tried that spell yet, even thoughKellie had told her about it. &quot;Yeah I guess it can,&quot; she answered. &quot;But I havent tried it yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
Karen smirked, stepping forward to face Katie. &quot;Well no time like the present,&quot; she said happily. Katie and Mary Elise gaped at the mousy raven haired girl. &quot;Karem you camt be serious,&quot; Mary Elise exclaimed. &quot;I mean you would actually think and act like a kid. Do you really want to do that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well its a matter of trust,&quot; she answered. &quot;I trust that Katie or Kellie will make sure nothing bad happens. Besides, I wont be alone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How would you not be alone,&quot; Mary asked, slightly confused. Karem smirked as she pushed her glasses up her nose. &quot;Cause my best friend would be with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Seriously,&quot; Mary Elise groaned. &quot;Karen, Ive experienced this spell before. I really didnt like it. I forgor everything about being a teen or being in high school. It felt....icky.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cmon Mary please,&quot; Karen begged. &quot;It wont be for very long and we ask that Katie or Kellie turn us back immediately. So what do you say, want to be a kid with me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary Elise bit her lip, the idea of actially thinking she was just a child was somewhat frightening to her. As much as she wanted to just say no, she found it hard to say no. Groaning in frustration she removed her ring from her finger and handed it to Kellie. &quot;Probably best you hold this,&quot; she grumbled. &quot;Dont think its a great idea having a first grader with the ability to transform people.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure about this Mary,&quot; Kellie asked, noticing the concerned look on the girls face. &quot;No,&quot; she moaned. &quot;But Karen has always been there for me. Can&#39;t let her do this alone. Just make sure were not kids for too long okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I promise Mary,&quot; Kellie said. &quot;It wont be for very long.&quot; Mary Elise turned to her friend, seeing a goofy smile spread across her face. &quot;What are you so happy about,&quot; she grumbled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just wanted to say thanks,&quot; she smirked. &quot;I appreciate this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I cant believe you want to be mentally younger.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just want to experience it,&quot; Karen shrugged. &quot;And besides, in another sec we probably wont remember this conversation.&quot;<br />
<br />
Before Mary could respond, Katie cast her spell. Karen and Mary Elise felt slightly light headed as the magic began to regreds the two mentally.<br />
<br />
At first Mary Elise and Karen found they were unable to remember the past couple of minutes. Slowly but surely the two girls found thos minutes become hours, then days. As they tried to concentrate they fiund themselves believing that they were now 4 monthes into their sophomore year of high school. Four months quickly became three months, then two and suddenly the two believed they were just starting out their sophmore year.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa weird,&quot; Karen said quietly. &quot;Mary? How. How old are we?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dont be weird Karen,&quot; Mary Elise snorted. &quot;We&#39;re 15. I mean 14. I mean...hmmm.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary Elise trailed off. She knew she and Karen had come to Kellies house for a sleepover. She remembered that the girla had magic and were practicing it on one another. The only thing she was having trouble remembering was her age. They were just starting high school. No wait, they were about to finish eighth grade. They were finishimg eighth grade in a month. No wait two months.<br />
<br />
Katir and Kellie watched as the two girls mentally began to regress. Katie had specifically put into her spell that Karen and Mary Elise would remember them, as well as remember all the details of their magical abilities. Curiously she now wondered how far the two had gone back.<br />
&quot;Doing okay you two?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah fine,&quot; Mary Elise answered, a slightly more cheerful tone in her voice. &quot;Sorry kind of got lost in thought, really cool your dad is letting us practice magic Kellie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No problem,&quot; Kellie answered. &quot;By the way, how old are you two.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Duh 12,&quot; they answered. &quot;No wait, we&#39;re 11? Wait that doesnt seem right.&quot; Kellie and Katie smirked as they looked at one another, the spell seemed to be wirking perfectly.<br />
<br />
Karen now tried to think about why her friends would ask such a weird question. They were all 10 and in the fourth grade. Karen paused, memories of fiurth grade now seemed to be vanishing like soap bubbles in the tub. Leasons from classes seemed to drift away like smoke as she tried to hold onto them. History, multiplication tables and science lessons vanished from her thoughts she grew steadily younger. Although puzzled by this she wasnt alarmed. Kellie knew magic and Mary Elise was with her.<br />
<br />
As the two girls completed their mental regression they blinked as they looked at Katie and Kellie.<br />
<br />
&quot;So did the spell work,&quot; Mary Elise asked, a newly found tone of innocence permeating her speech.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not sure,&quot; Katie asked. &quot;How old are we supposed to be?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re seven silly,&quot; Mary giggled. &quot;Guess it didn&#39;t work. Good try though.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie now tried to conceal her smile as she looked the two girls over.  Gone was the teenage anx and worries, instead replaced by their innocent seven year old personas.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guess Ill keep practicing,&quot; Katie answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Kellie can we jump on the bed,&quot; Karen asked. Kellie nodded causing the two girls to squeal in excitement. <br />
<br />
Katie and Kellie watched as their now seven year old friends kicked away their slippers as they happily jumped up and down, giggling with childish glee.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great job,&quot; Kellie said quietly. &quot;Not only did you make them mentally seven. You did it without freaking them out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie could only blush. &quot;Thanks, it was harder than I thought. Had to make them younger but make sure they didn&#39;t forget about any of us or why we were here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you did it better than I could of,&quot; Kellie replied warmly. &quot;Hopefully when they turn back they have some fond memories.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Katir and Kellie now happily gazed at their friends, they tried to decide what ti do next.</p>
