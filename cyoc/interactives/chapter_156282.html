<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In the morning Braden woke up with an erection. He realised why, his wish had worked. With some help he freed his appendage from his constrictive Pajama. Gazing at it almost feeling threatened by the mighty arching appendage. It barely lifted up from his crotch, it&#39;s sheer size making it impossible to stand straight up. Had it grown? No, not yet, he hadn&#39;t seen it erect yet that&#39;s why... Braden was overwhelmed with pride. He wanted to touch it... but his mother knocked on the door. &quot;Time to get dressed.&quot; Braden murmured to himself and got up supporting his might. It to Braden felt like it almost touched the floor.He brushed his teeth and washed himself careful not to hurt himself. <br />
<br />
They left in the car and Braden asked where they were going. &quot;Your cousins.&quot; Was the short answer apparently something Braden had forgotten. They were a somewhat weird bunch immigrating a bunch of times to countries where in the end they didn&#39;t like living due to various reasons mostly due to how easy it is to live here in comparison. While his parents where stuck talking to the eldest family members he was stuck with a bunch of teens talking slightly weirdly due to how much they travelled. The eldest cousin named Jake had his former girlfriend with him she was quite a bit older than him but still in her late teens which seemed a little odd the younger one name Brad was just a pervert openly commenting on how nice she looked and she jokingly saying he&#39;s got to grow up more first. <br />
<br />
Things escalated this time and he said. &quot;I&#39;ve grown enough, look.&quot; As he pulled down his pants relieving a rather impressive appendage which was clearly already aroused.  &quot;His brother laughed.&quot; &quot;That&#39;s nothing, yet.&quot; and he looked at his former girlfriend slyly. She gazed at his younger brother then at him. &quot;He&#39;s probably going to be bigger than you later.&quot; The older brother looked Embarrassed a little. &quot;Maybe if he&#39;s lucky.&quot; I just stared at them as I walked in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! Braden&quot; Jake said faking surprise. &quot;Braden meet Anike&quot;  The girl raised her hand. Anike was impressive no doubt about it and far too good for both brothers she probably knew that. Anike had a pleasant soft face which was more &#39;&#39;cute&#39;&#39; than &#39;&#39;sexy&#39;&#39; but her attitude made up for that. The same went for her figure with a mild hourglass figure with narrow shoulders and reserved hips with a perky but not very voluminous rear, all her excess volume had settled on her chest which was very large. Her current top seemed to push them down as much as possible causing some bulging flesh if she even leaned a bit forward. <br />
<br />
&quot;Anike you&#39;ve heard me talk about Braden, right?&quot; The younger brother didn&#39;t need to much spurring on. &quot;Show her Braden!&quot; Braden obliged and Anike gasped, her leather top creaked. &quot;&quot;Holyshit.&quot; Braden grinned. &quot;How long is it.&quot; Braden shrugged. &quot;Haven&#39;t measured.&quot; Anike Jumped down causing her chest to jiggle. The brad opened a box and took out a tape measure. &quot;Time to measure then.&quot; Braden held his dick out. &quot;Holy shit.&quot; Brad uttered. &quot;How long?&quot; Anike leaned in her vest creaking even louder. &quot;13.4 inches&quot;  She was so startled that she stood of straight causing her vest to creak in a way that sounded dangerous. Jake slapped Anike on the shoulder. &quot;A monster isn&#39;t he?&quot; Anike recovered her breath. &quot;Can you even get erect.&quot; Braden grinned. &quot;Yes.&quot; Anike looked surprised and so did Jake. &quot;It doesn&#39;t get that much bigger, right?&quot; Braden&#39;s penis flinched. &quot;It does.&quot; Brad behind him suddenly muttered &quot;No way, show us!&quot; Braden looked at Anike. &quot;I want to see it too.&quot; She said, breathing heavily. &quot;I have an idea, follow me&quot; Jake said and he took them to a tree house in the tree house there was a tv and enough space for all of them. He grabbed a dvd and inserted it into a disc player and pressed play. Moments later breasts bounced on the screen. &quot;Undo your pants again Braden. Show us.&quot; Surely enough all of them watched except Anike who mostly watched Braden and tried to stop Jake from clutching onto her. Brad took at the after 7 minutes. &quot;14 inches... not much change...&quot; Braden stared at him. &quot;It&#39;s barely getting started &quot; Brad measured again 15 minutes later &quot;14.7 inches, it&#39;s...&quot; Anike stared at it with great interest. &quot;That&#39;s so...&quot; Braden interupted. &quot;It&#39;s not fully erect yet.&quot; Jake gasped. &quot;What? Really?&quot; Braden shoved Brad away a few more times after 40 minutes brad had had enough and pushed his hand out of the way. &quot;16.2&quot; that&#39;s ridiculous&quot; Anike looked at Braden. &quot;It&#39;s still not fully there.&quot;  20 minutes later Bad measured again. &quot;16.4&quot; it&#39;s not growing anymore.&quot; Braden looked at the movie. &quot;It&#39;s just not good enough, I can get bigger! Really!&quot; Anike leaned forward and crawled over Jake. &quot;Now maybe this helps.&quot; She undid a zipper. Braden&#39;s dick was literally between her legs. &quot;Hope you like big tits.&quot; She undid her top and her chest came bouncing out he looked at them bounce perky and round as they were borderline unnatural much bigger than he even thought they were when she was dressed then his attention was drawn to her nipples which where actually way too small for her chest size but somehow fit her really well. &quot;Come on, touch them.&quot; Braden felt a tingle running down his rod. He touched them and the tingle became stronger. Suddenly there was noise outside. &quot;What?&quot; Anike said, Brad gasped. &quot;We need to measure him now!&quot; &quot;17.6 holy damn, is that even possible.&quot; Brad looked at Anike and grinned. Jake eyes stood wide open. His parents could be heard nearby. &quot;Wait, I can still get bigger.&quot; He looked at Anike. &quot;I promise it get&#39;s bigger.&quot; Anike looked flabbergasted. &quot;Even bigger?&quot; Braden nodded. &quot;Yes... I...&quot; His parents where downstairs and Braden was called down shoving his appandage down his pants and walking slightly comfortably albeit it became flaccid really fast.</p>
