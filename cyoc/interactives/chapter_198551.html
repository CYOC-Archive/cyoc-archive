<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ben reached for his phone to call his friend Joe. His bigger fingers gave him some issues with selecting his number but he eventually managed to dial his number.<br />
&quot;Heyo, it&#39;s Joe.&quot; came his friend&#39;s energetic voice.<br />
&quot;Hey Joe, it&#39;s Ben. Do you wanna come over? I have a new game I want to show you.&quot; Ben smiled to himself as he reached down to pick up his shredded clothes.<br />
&quot;Are you sure buddy? You voice doesn&#39;t sound to good. Sounds like you might be sick.&quot; Joe asked concerned. <br />
Shit! Ben had forgotten that his voice was deeper. &quot;Uhhh... yeah it&#39;s just a sore throat. Nothing contagious.&quot;<br />
&quot;Okayyy.&quot; Came the slightly suspicious reply. &quot;I&#39;ll be over in 45 minutes.&quot; <br />
&quot;Perfect, see you then.&quot; He hung up. <br />
&quot;Well now it&#39;s time to clean up.&quot; Ben said as he took in the mess he made with a sigh. He grabbed some towels and started to clean. <br />
___<br />
Joe arrived at Ben&#39;s apartment a little early. The fit wrestler jogged across the parking lot to Ben&#39;s apartment, his muscles bouncing with each step. He was a little worried about his friend, because he didn&#39;t sound like himself on the phone, but he didn&#39;t sound sick. Well he was about to find out.<br />
He and Ben were friends since middle school when Ben defended him from a group of bullies. They bonded over their mutual love of video games and horror movies. Eventually Joe hit a growth spurt and grew to be the jock he was today. He worked out to keep the growth going and it showed. His chest stood at a nice 48 inches with a nice covering of hair that could be seen through poking out the sides of his tank top along with his large 22 inch bicep. He had a round muscle gut that led down to a pair of toned hairy thighs. <br />
He raised his hand and knocked on the door.<br />
What answered the door was not Ben, or at least not Ben as he knew him. Ben was a short nerd that was a little on the pudgier side. What stood before him was a large 8&#39; Anthro Horse that was leaning down to fit his face in the doorway. The muscles on him made Joe look like he had just started working out. He gazed down and saw a large grapefruit sized sheath and two melon sized balls. It was definitely a he.<br />
&quot;Hello Joe.&quot; Came the deep sultry voice, followed by a sly grin. &quot;Come on in.&quot; The horse stood to the side gesturing for Joe to come inside.<br />
He nervously took a step inside peering up at the horse. &quot;B-Ben? Is that you? What happened to you.&quot; He asked dumbfounded.<br />
Ben smiled. &quot;Like I said I found a new computer game.&quot; He gently scratched at his balls.<br />
Joe took in a whiff of the air and it smelled sweet. Like salted caramel. He took in another larger whiff, his thoughts becoming a little foggy. <br />
Ben took a step closer, the large flared head of his cock poking out of the sheath as he grew harder and harder. He rested a hand on Joe&#39;s shoulder as he took in another deep whiff, the scent growing stronger.<br />
Ben sat down on the couch, it groaning under the weight of his bulk. &quot;Before I show you. I thought you could help me out with something.&quot; He said as he flexed his groin his cock spilling out more, his musk growing stronger. Joe looked at the cock, drool starting to form at the sides of his mouth. Ben pulled him closer, spreading his legs so that Joe had a comfortable spot between his legs.<br />
Joe got on his knees, his respectable 10 inches tenting out his shorts as he stared up the still growing magnificent pillar of virility. He let out his tongue to lick at the turgid shaft which caused it to pulse, pre spilling out from the head and running down the shaft. He licked it up his mind getting even foggier, the only thought being to please the shaft before him. He started to lick up and down it like a man possessed, eliciting deep moans from Ben above him.<br />
Joe move up to the head of the shaft swirling his tongue around it. His mind wanted to take the head into his mouth but it looked logistically impossible. Ben saw this and let out a sigh of frustration, before remembering the computer program. He stood up, his cock pushing into Joe and knocking him off balance.<br />
&quot;Be right back. I just have to go get something. Why don&#39;t you get undressed while I&#39;m gone.&quot; <br />
Joe nodded slowly before stripping himself of his clothes.<br />
Ben made his way down the hall and into his room. He pulled up his profile and made so that his musk would make anyone who breathed it in stretchier, so they could take him but still be snug around him. He also made it so that their gag reflex would be suppressed and they would still be able to breathe with him in them. He smiled and picked up his laptop, bringing it into the living room with him. He smiled as he entered taking in each hairy inch of Joe&#39;s body. The sculpted wrestler was big but had just the right amount of fat that it made his muscles look even bigger and softer. <br />
He set the laptop on the table near the couch and took his seat again. &quot;Now where were we?&quot; He smiled his cock throbbing hard in front of him. <br />
Joe got on his knees again and began fervently licking Ben&#39;s shaft. He moaned as he swallowed more of that delicious pre. Ben reached forward and gently cupped Joes head, bringing it up to his oozing cockhead. &quot;Open wide.&quot; He didn&#39;t give Joe a chance to complain before he shoved the flared head into his mouth with a loud moan as it hit the back of his throat. Joe gave a moan of surprise as it hit into the back of his throat. He breathed in deeply, his throat opening up as inhaled more of Ben&#39;s musk. <br />
Ben pushed him down more, the bulge of his cockhead bulging out Joe&#39;s throat. The pre oozing from the head increased and Joe gulped it down greedily. Ben continued to push the shaft down Joe&#39;s throat, until Joe was snug with his crotch. They both moaned. Ben doing his best to hold his orgasm back. <br />
&quot;God Joe, you really are a natural at this.&quot; He huffed breathlessly, his cock throbbing in Joe&#39;s throat, shooting pre directly into his stomach. He slowly pulled himself out to the medial ring. A wet pop echoed around the room, before he slammed his head back into the crotch. Joe sputtered, pre and saliva shooting out of his mouth. Ben rammed him up and down his shaft his hips thrusting with the motion. <br />
He slammed Joe&#39;s face down to his sheath and let out a loud neighing moan and unloaded into Joe, his throat bulging out as shot after shot of cum race down his shaft and directly into Joe&#39;s stomach. Ben held Joe&#39;s head tight to his crotch. Joe let out a long moan and loosed one of his many loads into the carpet below him. Joe rested a hand on his stomach that began to bloat with the cum that continued to fountain into him. He smack a hand on Ben&#39;s thigh trying to get him to let up as his belly continued to bulge bigger. <br />
Ben ignorant to the smacks, held Joe his tongue lolling out of his mouth. Eventually his orgasm died down and he let go of Joe&#39;s head. Joe pulled of the dick with a loud gasp. A rope of cum and slime connected him to the cock that had penetrated him so thoroughly. Joe looked down at his belly that made him look 9 months pregnant with the amount of cum in him. He heard his bell slosh full of cum. He tried to stand up but fell back on his ass as the weight unbalanced him. <br />
Ben&#39;s cock slowly retreated back into his sheath and he sighed contentedly. He reached down and picked Joe up and holding him close to his chest. He moved into his bedroom and laid down with Joe wrapped in his embrace.</p>
