<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I&#39;m late to gym!&quot; Kyle exclaimed in panic.<br />
<br />
He sprinted from the bathroom as quickly as he could. His hair kept falling in his face and his tight pants made movement somewhat difficult, but Kyle moved as quickly as he could. The halls were practically empty. He must&#39;ve taken longer with Austin than he&#39;d realized.<br />
<br />
At last, Kyle burst through the door to the locker room, only to find that most of his classmates had already gone out to the field and the remaining few were already dressed out. &quot;This is good,&quot; he thought to himself, &quot;I can get changed quickly and maybe nobody will notice me.&quot; <br />
<br />
Kyle made his way over to his locker, but found his eyes wandering as he did so. The other guys were all suddenly so... attractive. How had he never noticed his classmates&#39; sexy physiques before? Chris&#39;s abs, Jake&#39;s broad shoulders, the way Nick&#39;s ass filled out his compression shorts. It was becoming very difficult to focus on getting to his locker and getting changed with so many... distractions. How had he been oblivious to all of this for so long?<br />
<br />
When he got to his locker, Kyle just stood there, mouth hanging agape, his firm resolution to get changed quickly now long forgotten. His only thoughts were about the guys, how hot they looked... what they could do to him...<br />
<br />
While scanning the room, Kyle noticed that two of the more athletic guys, Jake and Nick, had cornered Corey, a shy, gay theater kid. &quot;What&#39;s the matter, fag?&quot; Nick asked tauntingly, &quot;Why don&#39;t you get dressed out? Too busy checking us out to focus?&quot;<br />
<br />
Corey tried to back away but his back was up against the lockers. Jake and Nick were blocking all routes of escape. &quot;N-n-no,&quot; he stammered timidly, &quot;I just wanted to wait until you were all gone...&quot; Corey&#39;s frightened eyes landed on Kyle, who was standing just behind his two tormentors.<br />
<br />
Jake glanced over his shoulder to see what Corey was looking at. A broad grin spread across his face. Soaking wet and sporting a massive boner, Kyle must have been quite a sight.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, well, well,&quot; Jake said with a smirk, turning from Corey and approaching Kyle instead, &quot;Here&#39;s someone you could take lessons from, fag. Hey Nick, you still got that video?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah,&quot; Nick said as he pulled out his phone and started playing the viral video. Kyle felt his cheeks turn red as the sounds of his own moaning echoed in the empty locker room. He was still embarrassed, although the shock was starting to fade. What he mostly noticed now was that he did, admittedly, sound pretty hot...<br />
<br />
The two larger guys started closing in on Kyle. This momentarily shocked him back to his senses. &quot;Oh no,&quot; he thought, &quot;They&#39;re going to make me lose control again, just like Joshy did. They&#39;re going to bend me over and spank me and fuck me like a good little slut and.... and I can&#39;t let them do that because. Well... I don&#39;t know why, but. I just can&#39;t.&quot;<br />
<br />
He started to back away but tripped over a nearby bench and barely twisted around in time to catch himself before his head hit the ground.<br />
<br />
Behind him, the two jocks laughed. Nick spoke up, &quot;Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re trying to get away, slut. We all know how much you want this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well duh, I want you to give it to me,&quot; Kyle responded automatically. Realizing what he had just said, he slapped a hand over his rebellious mouth. Part of Kyle, a weakening, fading part of him almost gagged in revulsion. He scrambled, fumbled, tried to push himself up, stop what was about to happen but at that very moment he felt a loud smack. One of the two guys, Kyle didn&#39;t know which, had just struck his swollen ass.<br />
<br />
Instantly, the part of Kyle that was still resisting vanished. In the blink of an eye he was sitting up on the bench, a dumb grin on his face, his hands fishing the two boys&#39; meaty cocks out of their gym shorts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow,&quot; he thought to himself, &quot;they&#39;re so big. Not as big as me, of course, but I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll still be a mouthful.&quot;<br />
<br />
Before he knew it, he was giving Jake a blowjob, moaning and mewling with delight. Not wanting Nick to feel left out, he began giving the other guy a hand job to get him ready for his turn. Kyle was so happy these two guys had stayed behind to let him service them like this. It was so sweet of them. He resolved to do his best to pleasure them and make them cum as many times as possible. They really deserved it!<br />
<br />
For several minutes Kyle sat there, taking turns to suck each of the delicious cocks in front of him. He made sure to give Nick and Jake equal attention like the good little slut he was, blissfully alternating between licking up and down the shafts and swirling around the juicy heads. For their part, the two larger guys seemed to be enjoying it quite a bit. They would take turns pulling Kyle onto their cocks, forcing him deeper with each thrust. And Kyle, to his delight, discovered that deep throating was no longer a problem at all! He&#39;d changed so quickly?<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, why am I changing, again?&quot; Kyle suddenly began to wonder. He strained to remember... was there something about Jen and a curse...? But it was as if a haze had descended over his mind. Within a moment he was lost again in savoring the delicious flavor of Nick&#39;s engorged cock in his mouth.<br />
<br />
Out of the corner of his eye, he could see that Corey was still standing there in the corner, frozen, his eyes fixed on the scene unfolding before him. Despite the boy&#39;s look of horror, Kyle couldn&#39;t help but notice that he was sporting a small but undeniable boner.<br />
<br />
Kyle giggled as he pulled Nick&#39;s rigid dick out of his mouth with a slurp and popped in Jake&#39;s to take its place. Why Corey didn&#39;t come over and get a turn? Kyle certainly had no problem sharing. He did envy Corey&#39;s petite and slender frame, but Kyle didn&#39;t hold that against him. He&#39;d be happy to suck off a tiny dick as eagerly as a big one!<br />
<br />
His thoughts were interrupted as Jake slid his cock out of Kyle&#39;s mouth and sat down on the bench next to him. Kyle shrugged and turned to give Nick another turn. But instead of offering his dick, Nick grabbed Kyle and picked him up off the bench. The puzzled look on Kyle&#39;s face was soon replaced by a dopey grin as he realized what was going on. &quot;Yay!&quot; he thought to himself elatedly, &quot;I&#39;ve been a good little slut!&quot; <br />
<br />
Jake pulled Kyle&#39;s pants down while Nick positioned him right over the other boy&#39;s swollen cock. Kyle felt his hole quivering in anticipation. He was sooooo ready.<br />
<br />
Kyle couldn&#39;t resist letting out a little giggle as Nick lowered him down onto Jake&#39;s waiting member. The giggle turned into a gasp and then a long, slow, moan as Kyle felt himself sliding down onto the massive cock, feeling it fill him up inch by inch. As he slid down, his own enormous member raised to attention in front of him. His toes curled with delight. This was amazing.<br />
<br />
And then Jake began to pump. Kyle was soon lost in ecstasy, riding up and down on Jake&#39;s cock. His head rolled back, messy hair in his face. His mouth lolled open. He moaned uncontrollably. Through the haze of pleasure  and mess of hair in his eyes, Kyle could vaguely make out something just in front of his face... another cock.<br />
<br />
It was Nick! He&#39;d come back to let Kyle give him another blowjob. How sweet of him! Kyle happily grabbed the other boy&#39;s dick and began bobbing up and down it, working every inch of the shaft. He savored the incredible sensation of being fucked in both of his holes at once. This was incredible. He felt so... full. Why hadn&#39;t he ever done this before? Why had he let his holes go so empty for so long? This was just... natural for Kyle now.</p>
