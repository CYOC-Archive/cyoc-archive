<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As lunch completed Lynne found herself in study hall with Gloria, Tricia and the others. Despite the girls beckoning Lynne over she decided to join Gloria’s bully Bethany and her friends. Gloria sighed sadly as she watched her little sister whisper with the mean girls before giggling.<br />
<br />
“You okay Gloria,” Tricia asked. Gloria nodded sadly as she turned back towards Lynne.<br />
<br />
“Yeah I’m okay,” she sighed. “It’s just, I don’t know. What did I do to make her so mad at me. I mean she was out of control. She changed Principal Jenkins without any concern of the consequences.”<br />
<br />
“Lynne is a prankster,” Tricia stated. “The magic she uses is more for fun than anything else. Chances are she would of turned Principal Jenkins back at the end of the day. She’s probably mad she got detention though, she usually is able to get herself out of trouble.”<br />
<br />
“Wait,” Sasha said quickly. “Are you telling me that she’s pissed at us because Gloria got her in trouble? That’s stupid.”<br />
<br />
“Not to Lynne,” Tricia answered. “She hates getting in trouble. Her mom and dad hold her to a high standard. She wants to be just like her sisters, she idolizes you and Katie. I think...I think she might be feeling a little let down.”<br />
<br />
Gloria glanced at the girl, understanding that in her time she had a lot of expectations placed upon her. For her getting in trouble and letting the family down was a big deal. “And now Mom and dad are going to find out she has detention,” she moaned. “Ugh no wonder she’s so mad. I got her in trouble.”<br />
<br />
As Gloria now stood she felt Tricia grab her by her sleeve. “What are you doing,” she hissed.<br />
<br />
“Well I’m gong to apologize to her,” Gloria stated. “I mean she is my sister.”<br />
<br />
Tricia shook her head sighing at Gloria’s idea. “Geez you really don’t know her huh,” she groaned. “If you go over their and apologize while she’s still mad it’s only going to make her angrier. She’ll see it as you trying to show her up. Just sit back and relax, you two can talk when you get home.” Gloria shrugged as sat down, for now she would take Tricia’s advise.<br />
<br />
Lynne had been watching her sister and her friends carefully. She had seen Gloria about to come over before Tricia pulled her back down. Tricia was smart, talking was out of the question for the moment. “Besides it’s payback time,” Lynne thought wickedly.<br />
<br />
Talking with the girls around her, she realized her sister and her friends weren’t exactly the most popular girls at their school. Bethany and her crew thought of Gloria as a teachers pet and a kiss ass, something Lynne was beginning to agree with. “Ugh she’s such a suck up,” Bethany groaned, as she glared at Gloria. “All of her friends are. I still can’t believe Adam is actually going out with her friend Felicia.”<br />
<br />
Lynne now listened intently as the mean girls spit venom about Felicia and Gloria. They believed Gloria was a geek while Felicia was dating outside her social circle. While Lynne had no animosity towards Felicia, she definitely wanted some payback on Gloria. As Ms. Dean entered the class the girls watched as Gloria went up to assist the teacher.<br />
<br />
“Christ she’s such a kiss ass,” Bethany’s friend Nicole groaned. The others nodded in agreement as they watched the young teen help to clumsy teacher pick up some folders that had fallen from her arms. As Gloria was bent over Lynne got a devilish idea.<br />
<br />
Focus her magic Lynne now concentrated on Gloria’s jeans. Slowly but surely she could see the mAterial seemingly shrink. Gloria fidgeted slightly as she now found her jeans to be tight on her waifish waist and theighs.<br />
<br />
“Are you okay Gloria,” Ms. Dean asked. “You look like your in pain.”<br />
<br />
Gloria looked around anxiously, something was certainly wrong but she couldn’t put her finger on it. The pain along her waist and legs was beginning to become unbearable. Looking down at her jeans her eyes bulged, it almost appeared as if the material was shrinking. “Lynne,” she thought in alarm.<br />
<br />
Gloria now tried to smooth her jeans out, noticing the hems were riding up higher on her legs while the waist continued to constrict her. Gloria’s eyes were beginning to well up with tears from the pain. When she thought she couldn’t take anymore she heard the unmistakable sound of the material ripping.<br />
<br />
“Oh no!”<br />
<br />
Gloria’s eyes bulged as she felt her jeans ripp into shreds, falling down in tatters around her shoes. The young teen now turned crimson as she listened to the class erupt into thunderous laughter. “Nice panties Gloria,” Lynne laughed.<br />
<br />
Gloria could feel warm tears begin to fall down her cheek as she tried to cover her panties with her hands and the hem of her shirt. Looking at her sister she felt crushed. “Why,” she mumbled, as she burst into tears of embarrassment.<br />
<br />
Lynne sighed, she had wanted payback on Gloria. Looking at the embarrassed girl she watched as her friends ran to her aid, while her friends glaredangrily at her. The girl had taken it too far Nd was now regretting her decision. Looking at the girls she had begun to consider friends she could see them mocking her poor sister, her bright pink panties exposed for the entire class to see.<br />
<br />
“I’m...I’m sorry,” Lynne whispered as she looked at Gloria and her friends. <br />
<br />
Gloria and the others watched as Lynne now sprinted from the classroom. Lynne appeared close to tears as she fled. While Ms. Dean and the others now attempted to maintain Gloria’s modesty, they realized they would need to talk with Lynne. A talk they would have to approach carefully.</p>
