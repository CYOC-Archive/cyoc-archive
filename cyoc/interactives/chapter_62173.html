<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;It's been a long time since any human summoned me.&quot; Said the entity from beyond. <br />
<br />
&quot;You're not a demon, you're not an angel, that's why I chose to bargain with you.&quot; Said the master of the empty house. &quot;So we're in agreement?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The power to write and seal Contracts is yours, in exchange, you can no longer directly defend yourself or others from any sapient being who <br />
intends you physical harm. Most would think you mad for this bargain.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There's always trade offs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then this deal is made and can not be broken. And my role in things is complete.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
'Life seems like it won't stop giving you lemons? Sign this lifetime contract and we promise to give you happiness and purpose.'<br />
<br />
 'This Contract is unbreakable once signed. By signing you agree to modifications to your DNA (including gender and anthro species). And you <br />
agree to having your psyche adapted to your new job. You have formal and legal protection against any and all unwilling and/or modification <br />
encouraged sexual relations and remains within your sphere of freedom of will and may not be forced upon you. This contract may only be <br />
signed totally of your own free will. . As a fringed benefit you will not age a day after your adjustments and will have full medical and dental.'  <br />
<br />
Carlson had followed strange the want ad, posted outside the relatively large house.  He had no job. He had tried to get into a collage for a year <br />
and no luck and his family made it crystal clear they had no intention of supporting him any longer. <br />
<br />
A few minutes later Carlson read the contract the obvious owner offered to him, &quot;Huh, i think it is legal, no problems with it... I should sign?&quot; <br />
Most of it sounded like some cheap gage thrown in, people who had money to burn tended be a little screw loose anyway. <br />
<br />
&quot;That's totally of your free will to sign. Just remember, the contract is unbreakable once signed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This isn't going to turn me into a robot is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There's nothing in the contract about your submitting to having your biological combatants mechanized.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok! I sign!&quot;<br />
<br />
Carlson signed. <br />
<br />
 &quot;And now your destiny is bound. As a fringed benefit you will not age a day after your adjustments and will have full medical and dental.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok. The full medical seem a good extra. What about vacations?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What vacations? Your modification will have you LOVING what you'll be doing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Before Carlson's eyes the world become bigger as he age regressed to fourteen years old. His clothes were baggy on him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh, ok? Uh oh...i begin to has regrets about sign theeeeeee? My clothes!&quot;<br />
<br />
He feel his face blushes as he felt his Y chromosome exchanged for another X one and his biology changing to fit.<br />
<br />
His normal ears vanished replaced by a pointed pair on top of his head with black and orange strips. Followed by an orange and black stripped <br />
cat tail.<br />
<br />
His clothes then morph into a cliche anime style french maid outfit.<br />
<br />
<br />
 &quot;The mental changes should kick in after a minute. Don't worry about not loving your job, you will in a bit. In fact serving as a maid will be <br />
your reason for wanting to live. Which according to the transformation of fate done by the contract signing, it is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Give me the contract, meooow! I change my mind, I want break the contract, meow!&quot; She reached out for him. <br />
<br />
The Contractor took several steps back. &quot;I told you -twice- it can't be broken before you signed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; I don't want be a... cleaning all the day,&quot; She purred and shook her head, &quot;No! No... Yes? Cleaning all the day, meeeoow... while I am dressed <br />
with a cute maid outfit... &quot;<br />
<br />
 &quot;Now dear. Stand attention for the master of the house. Your master, legally and in your heart and mind. What is your name. What do you do? <br />
What do you want to do? What is your job? What makes you happy?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
She stood up at attention with her legs together and her arms at her sides, Smiling. &quot;I am Carlson… I guess, don't sound like a maid name, <br />
meow... I'm Kupochu! I clean! I want to clean your house, Master! Because I am your maid!&quot; She hugged him, &quot;Silly Master, of course i am <br />
happy!&quot;<br />
<br />
He observed her for two weeks. She didn't strangle him in his sleep or call a lawyer or police so that was a good sign. She had moved of course <br />
directly into one of the servant bunk rooms. <br />
<br />
Finally, on the fifteen day he chose to put her to the ultimate test.  In his own room he summoned her. <br />
<br />
The contractor handed her the contract putting it in her hands. &quot;Now. If -you- rip your contract in two. You're free. You go back to the way you <br />
were. I won't stop you. What shall you do?&quot; Of course the contract was already sealed, legal, blinding, and completely unbreakable for either <br />
party, but he needed to see what look loopholes there were. <br />
<br />
&quot;I am free?&quot; The kitty maid blinked, confused &quot;Well, now as I think about it, I work hard all the week and i need some vacations... At least, one <br />
or two days.&quot;<br />
<br />
 &quot;Dang. The idea was that the work was supposed to feel like a vacation. And if that's what you want you should find some people to sign a <br />
contract to become your sisters to carry your work load. And I meant you're free if your rip up your contract. But only this one time. Right now. <br />
At this beginning. Otherwise, this is you, the you who is you.&quot; <br />
<br />
Kopuchu looked sadly at her master, &quot;Sorry for hear it Master. But, even if I love to clean, it was very hard work. But if Master give me a free <br />
week, I promise return with a lot of news maids to help me with the job.&quot; She smiled at him, eager to prove how she could help her master. <br />
<br />
&quot; . . . &quot; He took the indestructable contract from her. &quot;That shall be recorded by the gods as a acceptance of your fate. And I grant you <br />
permission to leave the grounds to recruit 'lots' of new maids to--&quot;<br />
<br />
She leapt up and hugged him, &quot;Thanks! I will return with a lot of maids, I promise!&quot;  She kissed her master on both cheeks, &quot;See you later, <br />
meeeow!&quot; She made a playful gesture and bounded out the door eager for her new task. <br />
<br />
&quot;--run the estate. This place perhaps is foolish to be cleaned by one servant. You have temporary authority to bind contracts to willing signers. <br />
But they are drafted by me to function as yours are.&quot; The contractor finished. <br />
<br />
The appointed cat girl maid after a month&nbsp;in her master's service and request is a vacation, is told to contract more victims, er, staff, to take up <br />
the work load during her down time.  She leaves the house promising to bring back 'lots' of new maids Contacted. <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
It was dangerous doing his own shopping for the week Kopuchu was out. But it was either that or starve to death. It just to be raining too. <br />
Badly. Very badly. He was wearing a full jacket and a hat and gloves and he was still wet. <br />
<br />
He really needed to exercise more, it was now evening and almost no cars were on the street and for good reason. Driving in this weather was <br />
dangerous. Sadly, not everyone had a choice. <br />
<br />
The contractor was caught completely off guard when the small family car crashed hard. And it wasn't into him. It was into a street lamp.<br />
<br />
There would be no one else on the street of course.<br />
<br />
Morbid curiosity overcame the contractor as he looked at the wreck. A man and a woman at front, through the windshield, and very clearly <br />
dead. <br />
<br />
He picked up a cellphone to call 911 as any citizen would do. He found out they wouldn't be there for another ten minutes. <br />
<br />
He also finally noticed the much smaller shape in the back, with a piece of glass through through the neck and arms and legs all going in the <br />
wrong directions with bones sticking out a side of his neck. <br />
<br />
'Ah dammit.' The contractor thought. Not amused at the least at this sadistic twist the fates seemed to want to use to punish him with. <br />
<br />
The little boy's overalls were covered in blood. The contractor actually had some basic medical knowledge, the boy was going to be dead five <br />
minutes before emergency services arrived. <br />
<br />
The lad's eyes rolled over to him, &quot;M-mr, mom, d-daaa.. ack, where arre-&quot;<br />
<br />
He didn't have time to write a new contract. All he could use were the ones he already had on them. <br />
<br />
Cursing himself utterly and completely the contractor took out a contract and summoned a phantom pen that floated into the boy's fingers and <br />
he slipped the contract under him. <br />
<br />
&quot;I can make it better. Or at least a little better. If you'll be my helper. Please . . . just put a little 'x' on the paper there . . .If that is your choice.&quot; <br />
The contractor asked, almost pleaded, a horrified and sick feeling rising in his gut. <br />
<br />
Confused and scared and his little mind racing and his heart shutting down, the boy complied. <br />
<br />
At once the glass was forced out of his throat and bones and muscles and internal organs healed himself, and quick rearranged themselves. His <br />
black hair turned light green, his brown eyes turned blue, his tanned skin became paler.  Green cat ears grow from the top of his head as his <br />
old ears vanished and a cat tail grew out of his pants that were quickly becoming a blue and white maid uniform perfectly fitting to his size. <br />
<br />
Making a short 'Meow!' she leapt out of the broken vehicle and curtsied at him, &quot;Meow! Master! I'll help you any way you want Master!&quot; <br />
<br />
The contractor wanted to kill himself, but that sadly wasn't an option now. He had intended only those who deserved to be contracted, or <br />
wanted to be or had not choice but to be . . . but this . . .  He put his coat around her. <br />
<br />
Of course the paramedics wouldn't connect a little girl (with a reaction filter in place so even if they noticed she was a cat girl the fact cat girls <br />
weren't supposed to exist wouldn't trigger in their minds) with a missing dead little boy, they let him go. <br />
<br />
His new little maid at eight years old skipped happily next to him. They made it back to the house without trouble.</p>
