<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You were heavily surprised at the discovery that you were lactating. Though Head Sister Julie had commented that she thought you might be pregnant, as a result of ovulating after becoming Michelle and then eating two jerks the siren way, you didn&#39;t think it would be that fast. You admitted to yourself that you really didn&#39;t know much about female things... other than the things men were attracted to, and at present two of those things you had were leaking milk. You might be pregnant, but Selene really didn&#39;t start lactating until she was further along in her pregnancy than where you were... if you were in fact pregnant.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your lactating is more than likely the result of your bond to me and thus your bond to our daughter,&quot; Selene smiled to you, as she held Lea in her arms, &quot;It&#39;ll be as we explained before I went into labor... you were there to conceive Lea as Michael. The fact that you&#39;re a siren doesn&#39;t remove that bond... and thus, Michelle, you&#39;re producing milk and magic as a result of your &quot;fatherly&quot; bond with Lea...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Assuming I&#39;m not pregnant,&quot; you said slowly, puzzled on how you could be lactating so early pained slightly by the added weight of the milk in your breasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;As sirens... while we may produce more &quot;pregnancy hormones&quot; and will produce them faster than human women... pregnancy wouldn&#39;t make you lactate until you&#39;re closer to your third trimester... IF you are pregnant,&quot; Selene assured you.<br />
<br />
&quot;But what about what Florencia did?&quot; you asked, looking at the baby mermaid in her mother&#39;s arms. Lea was an extremely beautiful baby and to you looked very much like her mother. Other than her tail, you figured Lea would be an exact duplicate of Selene. Lea&#39;s tail had two tones to it. The underside of her tail matched Selene&#39;s silvery colored tail in her mer form while the top half of Lea&#39;s tail matched your own tail&#39;s scarlet shade. You then reached out with one hand to caress Lea&#39;s cheek. The infant actually cooed when your hand touched her, &quot;what if she botched her transforming Michael into me... thus leading to my separating from Michael... and my magic might hurt her...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That won&#39;t happen,&quot; Selene came forward on the bed and pressed her free shoulder to one of your shoulders. It left your left breast pressing against Selene&#39;s right breast. The bottom of your engorged nipple was rubbing against the top of her engorged nipple. It made you moan slightly and lead to more milk being dripped onto the sheets of the bed from both you and Selene. &quot;The method Florencia used may be unorthodox, but only in the sense that it was used on you alone. The council even told us that it was a method more typically used to transform several humans... it isn&#39;t something that hasn&#39;t been used before...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But... but... my separation from my male personality... that&#39;s something you&#39;ve all said you don&#39;t know about,&quot; you glanced to Michael who was on the other side of Selene and looking at both of you in surprise and confusion, &quot;I don&#39;t want to hurt our daughter in case there is something...&quot;<br />
<br />
The thought of Lea in pain or altered because of what Florencia had done to you made you very nervous and a lump formed in your throat.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love her too much,&quot; you said to Selene.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can always find out tomorrow,&quot; Michael offered after a moment, &quot;Selene wasn&#39;t in labor that long...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Only because you know I&#39;m a siren and I was able to give birth under water,&quot; Selene told him, &quot;if you didn&#39;t... I would have given birth in the hospital in human form and that would have taken the roughly twenty hours of labor human women go through...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But why did it go so fast while in mer form?&quot; you asked, &quot;Lena looks to be as big as any other human baby... just with a tail instead of legs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Our magic is stronger when we&#39;re in water and have our tails,&quot; Selene assured you, &quot;It not only helps strengthen the baby but speeds up the process of giving birth...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; you said slowly and rubbed your own belly for a moment, wondering about what would happen if the tests came back that you were pregnant.<br />
<br />
&quot;Things will be fine, Michelle,&quot; Selene assured you.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure... but I&#39;d like to wait until Head Sister Julie or Councilor Sally who seem to have studied into siren magic can assure me that there is nothing that could hurt Lea or anyone else,&quot; you said to Selene. &quot;Just to be safe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Though that&#39;ll have to wait until tomorrow,&quot; Michael reminded you and Selene. &quot;I think most everyone else went to sleep...&quot;<br />
<br />
You and Selene nodded. Selene carefully lay Lea in her specialized crib and the three of you laid back down, though you tried to stay on your back, as you didn&#39;t want to leak milk all over the bedspread.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
You slept fairly well, all things considered, but morning still came early. You awoke to find Sally and Jenny standing in the doorway with the call of &quot;reveille.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning, there sleepy heads,&quot; Sally spoke, &quot;there&#39;s a lot to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
You, Michael, and Selene all gave an exhausted groan. As if you wanted more time to sleep.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I know you&#39;re all tired,&quot; Sally spoke, &quot;but the council session today is still scheduled and the three of you will need to be there in order to get any justice for what Head Sister Florencia did... that&#39;s the rules.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ungh...&quot; you gave a groan as you then sat up. Which got Julie to take notice...<br />
<br />
&quot;My...  Michelle... you&#39;re... you&#39;re rather heavily engorged at present,&quot; Julie said in surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;And lactating besides,&quot; you added, &quot;we found out about this last night when Selene and I joined Michael...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s nervous that it&#39;s something to do with what Florencia did to Michael to make him her and then &quot;botched&quot; it to the point that Michelle and Michael became separate beings,&quot; Selene added.<br />
<br />
Julie looked to her daughter and then sighed heavily. Sally gave a nervous shrug in response.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve never heard of siren magic being so altered...&quot; Sally spoke, &quot;but I&#39;d suppose that the unorthodox nature of what Head Sister Florencia has done would make checking the nature of your magic might be worthy... we can get a breast pump and mom can run her tests during the council meeting...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My magic?&quot; you said nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, your magic,&quot; Julie answered, &quot;how do you think infant sirens get their magic from their mothers?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d thought it&#39;d be like how we feel love from our brothers or in Selene&#39;s case her lover,&quot; you said blushing.<br />
<br />
&quot;No... that sort of thing won&#39;t come into play for your daughter until she matures,&quot; Julie answered, &quot;she may feel Michael&#39;s love... but it won&#39;t feed her in anyway until she&#39;s an adult.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And while the magic that we use to transform humans or feed on them is in our vagina... with specialized set of inner &quot;lip&quot; to hold a man&#39;s penis inside us,&quot; Selene said to you, &quot;but our magic is generated in our breasts...&quot;<br />
<br />
You looked down to your breasts. Their tanned and D cup forms stood soft, yet firm, and with engorged nipples, and now felt rather heavy on your chest. The milk in them was beginning to weigh them down. You either needed to be in water to let the water help support your breasts or you needed to get the milk out of them. Selene&#39;s comment then raised a new question.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that why sirens seem to be a C cup at the smallest?&quot; you asked to Selene.<br />
<br />
&quot;In a way, I suppose,&quot; Selene chuckled, &quot;Though some may be smaller depending on how well fed they are.&quot;<br />
<br />
You nodded and looked to Julie, &quot;Can we run the tests before we go? I don&#39;t want to be a threat to my own daughter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Both the one Selene gave birth to and the one you&#39;re carrying?&quot; Julie questioned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Carrying...&quot; you gasped.<br />
<br />
Julie nodded, &quot;Yes... carrying... I&#39;m sure this is all fast for you, Michelle, but the tests did come in... You are indeed pregnant.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m pregnant,&quot; you said a hand floating to your stomach.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;ll be okay, Michelle,&quot; Michael said to you, &quot;Selene and I will be there...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you&#39;ll give Lea a sibling,&quot; Selene gave you a hug.</p>
