<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Today was Cyrus's first day of summer vacation and he was super <br />
excited. Then a moving van pulled up 5 people stepped out. One was <br />
about 20 another about 17 and the other two looked like they were in <br />
their thirties. They were all guys except for one woman which he <br />
guessed was the mom. He walked outside to say hi to everyone. The 18 <br />
year old which was named Tom was going to be going to his high school <br />
this fall which Cyrus thought was cool until the 20 year old, John <br />
came out. John:&quot;Hey quit talkin to my brother kid!&quot;. Cyrus:&quot;Sorry I <br />
just found out he was going to go to my high school so I wanted to get <br />
to know him&quot;. Tom:&quot;Well leave us alone alright kid!&quot;. Cyrus became <br />
confused because Tom seemed kind until John came out. All the guys <br />
were muscular and wore fancy clothes so he figured they were rich. He <br />
went inside and watched as they unloaded the last few boxes off the <br />
truck. He went upstairs and saw his 12 year old little brother, Aaron <br />
messing with the action figures he got from his friends on his last <br />
day of school. He went to his room and stared out his window. Suddenly <br />
the doorbell rang and Cyrus went downstairs to open it. It was his <br />
friend Taylor from school. Taylor: Cyrus there's a comet heading for <br />
the neighborhood! Get your brother out of here!&quot;. Cyrus ran upstairs <br />
and picked up his little brother ignoring his endless complaints and <br />
questions and ran outside. His muscular arms were sore from gym <br />
yesterday and his brothers weight didn't help at all. They ran by the <br />
nearest hill and hid. The impact of the comet shook the earth under <br />
them causing them to lose balance and fall down. After everything <br />
calmed down he noticed the big crater behind his house and ran over to <br />
it. There was a weird bluish acid at the bottom and suddenly he fell <br />
in. He had a chance to look up before he fell in the acid and saw John <br />
standing at the top. When he hit the acid pain shot through his body <br />
then everything went black. He woke up next to the crater and looked <br />
around. Cyrus:&quot;How did I survive that?&quot; Then he looked behind him and <br />
saw his new neighbors having a barbecue. Cyrus:&quot;I wish I was their dad <br />
so I could see what's going on in that family&quot; His eyes began to shut <br />
and 3 seconds later he was standing in front of a barbeque. <br />
Cyrus:&quot;Whoa how did I get here?&quot; He turned around and found John, Tom, <br />
and their mom sitting at a table. She was in a uniform that read <br />
ELIZABETH on it. He ran inside to a bathroom and saw that he looked <br />
like the dad of those bratty kids. He felt his new face and felt a <br />
thin mustache above his lip. Cyrus:&quot;Whoa this is so weird&quot; he flexed <br />
his huge muscles and walked back outside. He saw his body panicking as <br />
it looked at its reflection in a metal fragment from the parked semi <br />
truck the comet crushed. Cyrus:(Oh My Gosh I body swapped!). He ran <br />
over to his body spun it around. Cyrus:&quot;Mr.Bannel?&quot; Mr.Bannel:&quot;Yeah, <br />
why am i looking at myself?&quot; Cyrus:&quot;I don't know how but we body <br />
swapped&quot; He ran off panicking which gave me time to figure out why the <br />
kids were so mean. Mrs.Bannel had gone inside so he sat down and <br />
talked to the kids. Once he got all the information he needed he <br />
walked around the corner. Cyrus:&quot;I wish i was myself again&quot; his eyes <br />
closed and he opened them to find himself at the police station. <br />
Police Officer:&quot;yeah we need you to come pick up a kid&quot; Cyrus:(Stop! <br />
No you don't!). Suddenly the police officer cancelled the order and <br />
hung up the phone. Cyrus:(Whoa, that was really weird it was like i <br />
controlled his mind just to make sure i'll have him slap himself). The <br />
police officer did as he commanded and slapped himself. <br />
Cyrus:&quot;cool&quot;&quot;(I wish I was the police officer)&quot;. His eyes shut and he <br />
found himself staring at himself. He flexed his muscular arm and dug <br />
through his pocket for the police car keys. He found them and decided <br />
to take it for a ride. He blasted the radio and sang along to rap <br />
music. He pulled up in front of a strange house that he pictured in <br />
his mind. He got out and walked inside. Woman's voice:&quot;Hey honey!&quot;. A <br />
woman walked in and gave him a kiss. He walked up the stairs to a room <br />
and noticed it was the officers room. He layed down on the bed and <br />
turned on the tv. Suddenly he realized that he had to swap back before <br />
his parents got home. He thought about swapping back and his eyes <br />
closed. He was in front of his house and decided to watch the <br />
neighbors for a while. He felt tired and blurted out&quot; I wish I was <br />
John. Suddenly his eyes closed and when he opened them he found <br />
himself in someone else's bed. and it was morning. He got up and went <br />
to the bathroom he realized he swapped with John and didn't really <br />
care now. He got in the shower and realized his muscles ached. After <br />
he got done He wrapped a towel around himself and the doorbell rang. <br />
Some one opened it and yelled&quot;Johnnie you here honey?&quot; (He has a <br />
girlfriend?) After he got dressed in a black tank top, jeans, and <br />
sneakers he walked downstairs. &quot;Hey swettie!&quot; a girl yelled. &quot; Have <br />
you been working out?&quot; she said feeling his muscles. &quot;yeah&quot; he said <br />
trying to resist the pain. He looked at their calender and read todays <br />
date and it said wrestling match. (They're wrestlers!) &quot;I hope you <br />
win&quot; she said as she kissed him.(Back off) suddenly the girl back <br />
away. Later on it was time for the wrestling match and Cyrus hated <br />
fighting. (I wish I-) at that moment he was punched by his opponent. <br />
(I wish I could fight) suddenly he felt a burst of energy rush through <br />
him. He took out 3 opponents in less than 5 minutes which was fast. <br />
After he finished he thought about his family and decided he better <br />
switch back. (I was I was myself again) and he found himself in his <br />
room again but this time he was playing with his brother.(Thanks) he <br />
thought.</p>
