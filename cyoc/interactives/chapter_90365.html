<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer decided to try something more experimental, but much more awesome if it worked out. To avoid suspicion, since there would be not possible way to explain this, she bolted the door, pulled the blinds and readied herself. She tried to turn into a liquid mass of her flesh, since her molecules of her flesh are closely packed together, but if she were to detach these molecules, yet still attach the intermolecular bond between each flesh molecule, she might just be able to turn into a liquid! She focused her mind, trying to loosen up her body. She felt a loose feeling on her wrist, and found that her hand has detached from her. She re-attached her hand, and tried again on melting. She tried for at least 5 times, and was about to give up, when her hand fell off again. But instead she just left it there, and continued to try and melt. Suddenly, she felt as if her hand was gripping on the wooden ground, but she still ignored the feeling, until she felt as if her whole hand was touching the floor. &quot;But thats not possible, the stump of my hand shouldn&#39;t be touching the ground...&quot; She opened her eyes, and saw her hand, liquified into a puddle of her flesh. She squeaked in triumph, knowing that she can now change between a solid and a liquid being, albeit being still composed of flesh.She poked at the puddle, and it was warm. She felt a tickling sensation on her melted arm, and even more so when she swirled the puddle with her other arm. She stood up, and stared at the mirror, hoping to get a better look of her body melting. She concentrated on her body melting, but she felt that where she was isn&#39;t very good for melting. She took the mirror into the bath room, and also scooped up her melted hand, and plopped it into the bathtub. She went outside to get some duct tape, and sealed the tub&#39;s hold up, and plugged it shut. Jennifer then sat in the tub, and to enhance her concentration and become more relaxed, she sat in a lotus pose inside the tub. She relaxed herself, and concentrated on letting herself simply melt. She looked at the opposing mirror at the other end of the tub, and saw her D-cup breasts start to show a bit of sag, as her left breast drooped lower towards her navel, the scene was getting more and more erotic. Jennifer kept her lotus pose, and tried to push her left breast up, but instead squished it slightly, leaving hand marks on her breast. She smoothed it out, feeling her breast which had a warm clay-like texture. She found that she had stop melting, and she realized that her body now had a lopsided breast if she were to stop melting. She realized that there was a slight increase in her amour of flesh, deduced by the increase of mass in her when she left the tub and stood onto the balance. &quot;How much mass can I create?&quot; Jennifer wondered on as she returned to the tub and back into her lotus position, continuing the melting session. But this time, she sped it up, hoping to try out another thing until she got to complete melting.<br />
<br />
Jennifer continued to melt, and concentrated on the area of her chest and downwards, not including her hands or arms. The lotus position started to loose its shape, and Jennifer looked at the mirror to see her things starting to sag towards the bottom of the tub, and her legs starting to defy the structure of the human body, bending towards the bottom of the tub. Her left breast dropped off of her chest with a splat as her right breast followed, now she had two mounds of clay-like flesh sitting on the tub, she held them up and rubbed them together, until it was one ball of flesh, but she melted that too and became a puddle. Jennifer was now sitting in a puddle of her flesh, and her legs finally melted into the puddle of flesh. All that remains is her torso, sans breasts. She tried to generate more mass, since she could basically by &quot;stretching&quot; more of her breasts and legs, she continued doing so until she almost filled the tub with her flesh, the scene so erotic it was turning Jennifer up. She tried to slide across the liquid mass, and did that, since it was still her flesh. She looked into the mirror and saw that whilst she was melting, it was as if a waterfall of flesh was pouring from the area of her chest, covering up her naval and towards the bottom of the tub. She dunked her head into the liquid flesh, and had a fun time blowing bubbles inside herself, which felt like a tickle on her belly. If anyone were to enter the bathroom now, they would see a naked girl without breasts and a lower body, and see a tube filled with flesh-coloured liquid, slowly filling out, pouring out from the naked girl that is slowly gliding on the surface of the flesh. Jennifer decided to rest for a while in this state, and leaned her head on the wall. <br />
<br />
After a few minutes, she rose up. Yet, Jennifer forgot she was melting, so what she experienced was the liquid in the tub, rising like a column with Jennifer on top, producing more and more of her liquid flesh. She looked at the mirror in awe, since she could still move as a liquid. She tried to form shapes from the torrent of flesh, and formed semi-solid objects out of her flesh, such as cubes, spheres, knives. She even formed limbs, with hands and legs forming. She melted all that back into her, and continued to move in her liquid state, but only her lower body. She tried to flow out of the tub, and successfully flowed out of the tub, the liquid flesh pouring out of it. She landed on the floor, and found that her liquid body was at least a 8 inches thick. She shut the door, and remained inside the bathroom. She poured more and more of her flesh from her body, which was really and easy task now that she had gotten the hand of it. It was extraordinary, being able to experience what a liquid would experience normally, and to become liquid, and to act and react like a liquid, it was truly unique, all thanks to Kyle. Jennifer started to take up more of the bathroom, until her head touched the ceiling. She stared at her naked body, the torrent of flesh pouring from her, as she slowed her melting and producing down. She swirled her finger around the flesh, made toy boats out of her liquid flesh, and even tried to make a new torso out of her flesh, which was fun since she spent a few minutes talking to herself. Finally the time has come, for her to melt completely. She looked at the mirror (which was just able to show her head), and melted. She saw her arms droop, the underside of her arm dripping flesh, until her arm broke off, leaving her with just a chest and a head. Her chest sunk into the mass, and her head bobbed on the surface. Her nose and eyes slid across her face, and her ears drag low towards the liquid flesh, and her hair fell off with her scalp, her mouth falling off, until every part of her has melting with her liquid body. She could now see in every direction of her liquid body, and felt everything in the room. Her liquid flesh touched the ceiling, and she felt amazing, she could touch every part of herself on everywhere. But she felt that she had more room to move towards, which was the crack of the door, leading to her room. <br />
<br />
She braced herself, and her squeezed herself through the thin cracks between the door. It was very smooth, the way she flowed out of her bathroom. The liquid flesh started to leak towards her bedroom, slowly stretching towards the bed, as the volume taken up in the bathroom decreases. She felt no pressure on her body, and knew she was exactly a goo girl, although made out of her flesh. She sped of the process, and her flesh squeezed of the frames of the door, slightly bursting on the edges, the top of the door dripping with her flesh, the bottom of the door with the grates, as she made her way through, it poured and poured, until the bathroom was emptied of her liquid flesh. She pooled in her bedroom, which rose to the sides of her bed. Jennifer decided to do something very weird, and tried to form body parts on the liquid flesh. She first formed something like a stick, then a slit appeared, then an eyeball. She looked from it, and concentrated. She then saw a mouth form, and it opened. She peered in it, and saw the insides of a mouth, although they were aligned with razor sharp teeth. She then formed limbs of different animals, hooves, wings, you name it. She then formed human parts, some which had certain changes to it, like a pussy with a thrashing tongue in it. She experimented for a while, until she felt that she wanted to try more things, and she returned to her liquid form. She rose from the liquid, first a large pillar that slowly poured liquid flesh, until it stopped, then arms pushed from the inside of the pillar, strands of human flesh dangling, then the bottom thinned out, forming 2 legs, then a torso with her navel, afterwards her chest balloons out to form her plump breasts, although Jennifer imagined it to be a bit larger than she was previously, and it ballooned out a bit more. Finally her head formed with the surrounding flesh around her head dripping off, revealing eyes, nose, mouth and ears. She tugged at her skin and peeled her skin, changing that into her hair. She had a lot of fun, and thought of more ways to exploit her powers.</p>
