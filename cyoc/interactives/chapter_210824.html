<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Matt watched with just as much despair and horrid fascination as you as the blue scales spread. Matt&#39;s eyes bulged in fear as he rubbed his skin in a panicked and frantic, but ultimately futile, way so as to make them disappear. Alas, they spread just all the more and very soon they reached his forehead and descended down his back. They were of a clear blue color but if you thought their hues were indeed beautiful, your surprise did not end there. Moreover, you doubted a compliment on Matt&#39;s scales would assuage his plight. The poor man barely had time to understand he was covered in reptilian scales that more changes arrived abruptly. With a sharp cry of pain, he ended up on all fours and wings and a tail forcefully made their way into the world outside of his body. Shreds of dead skin littered the bed and Matt was left, panting. He lied down, staring up at you with pleading eyes, asking for help and a solution. <br />
&quot;I... I don&#39;t know what is happening... I&#39;m sorry...&quot; you stammered. <br />
And it was the truth. You did not know why Matt had changed into a dragon. Was it the fact that you both had intercourse? Did you carry the transformation curse like a virus? Like a sexually transmitted disease? Was there a way to change the poor guy back?<br />
And then the next transformations occurred, not letting poor Matt a single moment of reprieve. He groaned in pain as waves of spasm racked his new body. You could only watch, entranced by the alterations taking place right before your eyes. Matt was getting smaller with each spasm of his body. Not only smaller, his features were changing too. His limbs became shorter yet younger. His muzzle became flatter and softer in its edges. His belly became chubby and lost its leanness. His eyes of a very clear blue color were much wider now. He was getting younger. And, fascinated by the regression of what had ben an adult dragon, you did not notice the hard shell slowly but surely recovering the lower body of Matt. So you jolted back when you saw something white encasing little bit by little bit Matt who indeed started to curl up and amazingly appeared to fall into a deep slumber. In the end, you were left with a shiny white egg in front of you. Matt had been transformed into a little dragon, now in an egg. An egg that started to move. It rolled towards you and you were so startled that you were completely unprepared when it shot towards you vagina and settled into you womb. It was heavy and uncomfortable, even if the discomfort receded quite rapidly.     <br />
&quot;Looks like you&#39;re expecting a joyful event,&quot; said a voice you knew and dreaded.<br />
It was the witch, who had appeared a few feet from you. She was smiling widely.<br />
&quot;What did you do to me?&quot; you shouted.<br />
&quot;You are now pregnant with the foetus of the man you had sex with. I thought it&#39;d be obvious.&quot;<br />
&quot;Change me back! And him too!&quot;<br />
&quot;Would you rather I change you back to a human? Really? You&#39;d be a pregnant woman expecting a baby Matt. Do you really want that? Because I think he was a lot more handsome as a dragon. But if this is what you wish for...&quot;<br />
Her eyes twinkled mischievously and you backed away, mortified.<br />
&quot;No! No! Anything but that!&quot;<br />
The notion of being a woman, pregnant with a man he had just had sex with, was just too horrible to imagine in all its details and to its fullest extent. <br />
&quot;Fine,&quot; sighed the witch in an exaggerated way, as if she was being most generous. &quot;I&#39;ll give you a choice. Either I change you into a woman pregnant with that man, or I teleport you away in the Draconic Realm to live amongst your new kind. You&#39;ll lose your old memories fast and be left to lay and hatch an egg, which you will consider your own. Matt will have lost all of his memories by then too, of course. You will be a dragoness, a full one, without any notion of ever having been human but a happy one. And I&#39;ll make you super hot. For dragons, of course.&quot;<br />
Her eyes twinkled and you hesitated. Both seemed awful options. Which one was the least worse? Hard to tell and...<br />
&quot;Hurry,&quot; yawned the witch. &quot;If you cannot decide in time, I&#39;ll do it for you...&quot;<br />
&quot;The dragon! I choose the dragon!&quot; you shout in fright.<br />
This option looks like the lest worse. Being a pregnant human woman, having to raise a baby that you didn&#39;t ask for and who was the man you had sex with, was too horrible to even contemplate. Being a female dragon with no memories seemed much less of a hassle. No rent to pay or child support, or lack thereof, to considerate and worry endlessly about. It looked like a better life. And having males attend on you if they found you super cute might be fun, or good to consider as it would mean raking in advantages, you think with still a lot of apprehension.<br />
&quot;As you wish!&quot; laughs the witch.<br />
She chants out a spell and you are wrapped in powerful gusts of wind. The world becomes out of focus and you feel yourself falling. As you plummet down, you can feel your bones and muscles snap in new positions. When you finally feel the ground under your paws, you notice that you can only go on all fours now. No upright walking for you from now on. You have wings and a tail that feels happy to feel the wind and the breeze and the soil beneath it. The skin and nerves are new and eager to feel more of the world, hence its lashing back and forth in anticipation of what the world had to offer, new muscles dying to be stretched and tested. However, you see that other things require your immediate attention.</p>
