<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The boxing tournament of the IAC will be starting soon. As such, there were a lot of people in the gyms waling on sandbags. Some sandbags had to be a lot heavier than normal to compensate for the large Animalians who were punching them. Of course, there were different brackets for weight classes and genders. It would hardly be fair to pit a rhino against a kangaroo...though the match would be very interesting to see. But the boxers still devoted a lot of time of building up the power of their punches.<br />
<br />
Sometimes, rivals were very good for pushing each other. Such as the case for Trevor and Riley. &quot;C&#39;mon, is that the best you can do?&quot; taunted Trevor as Riley punched the sandbag that Trevor was holding steady. &quot;I&#39;ve seen old deer that could hit harder than you. I&#39;m not even feeling it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Riley sent a solid punch that sent a small shockwave through the sandbag and managed to buffet Trevor back. &quot;Felt that one?&quot; asked Riley smugly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I felt it tickle,&quot; said Trevor. Though the wolf and Rottweiler did talk smack to each other, they were actually pretty chummy outside of competitive circles. The main problem is that they was still one thing they were both competing over.<br />
<br />
&quot;You boys better save that fighting for the actual tournament,&quot; said Jamie as she walked over. Jamie being near either of them was enough to get the two canines&#39; blood racing. It was particularly enticing since Jamie was wearing her wrestler&#39;s uniform that clung tightly to her large curves.<br />
<br />
&quot;Getting ready for the wrestling tournament?&quot; asked Riley, his eyes drifting between Jamie&#39;s face and her exposed cleavage.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it is coming up really soon,&quot; said Jamie pointedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? It is?&quot; asked Trevor in surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;You two didn&#39;t notice?&quot; asked Jamie. Then she let out a scoff and said, &quot;Of course you didn&#39;t. You red-blooded men were so focused on pummeling each other that you barely paid attention to my event.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe if you signed up for boxing, we would have noticed,&quot; said Riley.<br />
<br />
Jamie let out a bark of laughter and said, &quot;No way I&#39;m squaring off against her.&quot; She pointed to where Beth was hammering at her own sandbag. The way it was bouncing showed her punches packed a lot of force.<br />
<br />
Beth&#39;s ear twitched in their direction before she stopped punching. She then sauntered over to the trio and said, &quot;That&#39;s right. Nobody&#39;s getting in the way of these guns and the gold medal.&quot; She emphasized this by kissing her bulging biceps.<br />
<br />
&quot;Overly masculine, much?&quot; asked Jamie, &quot;And I thought my boys were loaded with testosterone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Testosterone is baby milk,&quot; said Beth, flexing her muscles, &quot;Estrogen for the win, baby.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We don&#39;t really act like that, do we?&quot; asked Trevor.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know I&#39;m less obnoxious than you,&quot; said Riley.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just like you&#39;re less stronger than me,&quot; said Trevor smugly.<br />
<br />
Jamie groaned and said, &quot;Beth, please don&#39;t start them up on it again or they&#39;ll be at it all day.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;ll probably think you&#39;re not worth all the fighting when you lose to a cat,&quot; said Beth teasingly.<br />
<br />
&quot;What makes you think I&#39;ll lose?&quot; challenged Jamie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lizzie&#39;s been watching wrestling for years. She knows more about it than you do. Plus look at her.&quot; Beth pointed across the room where Eliza was lifting a barbell that had to be at least 50 pounds. Eliza stopped her reps for a little bit to sit up and drink from her water bottle. She spotted Beth across the room and waved to her. Beth waved back before turning back to Trevor and Riley, &quot;What do you boys think of that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m hearing a lot of barking, but I don&#39;t see any biting,&quot; said Trevor.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll believe Lizzie&#39;s stronger than Jamie when I see it,&quot; said Riley.<br />
<br />
&quot;Care to make a bet on it?&quot; challenged Beth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Boys, you don&#39;t need to fight over me,&quot; said Jamie in a tired voice that clearly stated she&#39;s said this countless time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, they&#39;re not fighting, you&#39;ll be,&quot; said Beth, &quot;I say that Lizzie can kick your butt in the arena. And then they&#39;ll have to lick her feet.&quot; Beth paused a moment to think before adding, &quot;Wearing nothing but dog collars.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But when Jamie wins, you&#39;ll be the one licking her feet,&quot; said Trevor.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you&#39;ll be wearing a girly dress,&quot; said Riley.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooh, nice one,&quot; said Trevor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, men!&quot; said Jamie, throwing up her arms in mock-disgust before walking off. Though to tell the truth, she was eager to pit her strength against Eliza&#39;s. And it might be nice to take Beth&#39;s boastfulness down a few pegs. On the other hand, seeing Trevor and Riley lick Eliza&#39;s feet while practically naked was a rather funny image in itself.<br />
<br />
Jamie was about to head back to her own workout session when a poodle girl nearly bumped into her. Once she saw the blonde curls, he knew who she was dealing with. &quot;Hello, Tiffany,&quot; said Jamie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, Jamie,&quot; said Tiffany. She was also dressed for working out, namely tight gym shorts and a sports bra that was little more than a bra. &quot;Are Trevor and Riley here? I brought them new water bottles.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamie chuckled and said, &quot;There are other canines to go after. Just because they&#39;re fighting over me doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;ll show interest in you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, when one of them lose their match, I can comfort the loser,&quot; said Tiffany.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tiffany, you don&#39;t really think I&#39;m shallow enough to choose which one of them I want for my mate just by which one wins the match, do you?&quot; asked Jamie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course not,&quot; said Tiffany, &quot;I know you&#39;re a far deeper person than that. In fact, I bet you&#39;ve already thought of who you want whether or not  he wins the match.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;ve certainly had enough time to think it over,&quot; said Jamie, her wolf face not betraying the blush that she was feeling.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just hope you&#39;re thinking about the one that I like,&quot; said Tiffany, &quot;Then we&#39;d be starting all over only with the two of us competing over him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, if you think you can take me in the ring...&quot; said Jamie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, God, no,&quot; said Tiffany, &quot;I bruise like a peach. There&#39;s no way you&#39;ll catch me boxing or wrestling.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what are you doing?&quot; asked Jamie.<br />
<br />
&quot;The volleyball tournament, of course,&quot; said Tiffany, &quot;Me and Princess did so well back at Mieni Atoll that we&#39;re gonna play for the IAC too. Besides, if Princess wants to be on the UNLV&#39;s volleyball team, she has to really well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, are you doing indoor volleyball or beach volleyball?&quot; asked Jamie.<br />
<br />
Tiffany laughed and said, &quot;Beach volleyball, duh. I can&#39;t wait to head back to Mieni Atoll for it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Make sure you talk to Susan and Tzan while you&#39;re there,&quot; said Jamie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course. The ratings for their webshow is gonna skyrocket when I show up on it,&quot; said Tiffany boastfully. With that, Tiffany headed towards where Riley and Travis are. Tiffany may seem conceited, but Jamie knew that was mostly good-natured humor. Tiffany had grown a lot from the insecure girl who felt that she needed to be on top to matter. She was learning to accept herself and her new way of life. Jamie hoped she and Princess would do well at the volleyball tournament, but she was pretty sure Princess would get on the UNLV volleyball team where she won or not.</p>
