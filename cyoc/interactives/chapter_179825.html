<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;So, that&#39;s pretty much the routine we normally go through for practice.&quot; Brian said, as he and Seth began showering off after their impromptu drills.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, I guess there is one more little tradition.&quot; He went on to say with a shit-faced grin. &quot;We jocks like to jack off in the shower after a long hard practice, it&#39;s a kind of team building, stress relieving thing...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did the jacket make you gay too?&quot; Seth asked flatly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I still like girls... But... Yeah.&quot; Brian said smiling with a bit of color coming to his cheeks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe a jockified Max would want to be my boyfriend.&quot; Seth considered for a moment before turning on the shower.<br />
<br />
Brian started working his meat, the sight and sound of which got Seth instantly in the mood, but he was given slight pause at the prospect.<br />
<br />
&quot;What if I change more? What if this is my last time? What if I go all the way and become a complete Jock?&quot; He asked worriedly<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know what to tell you man. It&#39;s either accept your new life and give in to the changes as they come or stick with celibacy, if you can manage it...&quot; Brian replied<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope.&quot; Seth said laughing, he began massaging his sudsy, erect member and turned his thoughts to buff, hairy, jock bodies. He thought about Max being compelled to work out and putting on muscle against his will. He imagined his body maturing and growing hair, having to deal with the concomitant smells and changes in appearance. He imagined him growing dumber and dumber until he wasn&#39;t any smarter than Seth. He&#39;d have to join him in remedial classes... He imagined him becoming helplessly attracted to Seth&#39;s manly body as Seth would be attracted to his. Images of them working out together and sporting together flooded his mind. They&#39;d work up an enormous sweat together and wrestle each other in bed and they&#39;d never clean the sheets. They&#39;d wear each other&#39;s gear, each other&#39;s clothes, they&#39;d each long for the other&#39;s scent, they would be a perfect couple, forever content with one another. He could see the two of them lying side by side in bed, sporting massive jock meat hard-ons, tenderly stroking each other&#39;s prize, and suddenly it felt as though his hand were not his own. It was Max&#39;s hand; he could feel it gripping him lovingly, and the penis in his own hand belonged to Max. They were in perfect sync, Seth could no longer tell where one of them began and the other ended, he didn&#39;t know what limbs were real or imaginary, and suddenly his body shuddered and contorted involuntarily, he was overcome by a sudden sense of falling as his legs gave out from under him. His cock was spewing forth burst after burst of creamy jock jizz as his body flailed weakly, out of his control. <br />
<br />
He opened his eyes momentarily unable to move. He found himself lying on the floor underneath the shower stream, basking in profound, transcendent ecstasy.<br />
<br />
&quot;You really took yourself for a ride that time.&quot; Brian said looking down at Seth from his shower as he finished his own ministrations.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d never done it standing up before.&quot; Seth admitted with a relieved chuckle. &quot;It&#39;s not so safe... Kind of a dumb tradition.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, you get used to it. You can practice at home if you need to... Don&#39;t want to be the only one sitting down to bate in the shower.&quot; Brian said teasingly<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. I&#39;ll get the hang of it... Thanks Bry.&quot; Seth replied getting back to his feet and looking himself over for changes.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I look the same.&quot; Seth said with a bit of relief<br />
<br />
&quot;Yup, you must be fully cooked, bro.&quot; Brian replied happily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, bro... Oh shoot. What time is it?&quot; Seth yelled, suddenly remembering he was supposed to be writing that paper with Max.<br />
<br />
&quot;6:15&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shoot... I gotta go... And I need the jacket; where did you leave the jacket?&quot; Seth said frantically.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s in my car.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s OUR car, Bry.&quot; Seth said firmly, rolling his eyes. &quot;I&#39;m gonna head home right now and try it out. Don&#39;t tell mom about me joining the team, she&#39;ll just blab to Dad. Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll tell her all about it when I&#39;m ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
Seth scurried quickly out of the shower in a panic leaving Brian alone and confused. <br />
---------------------------<br />
<br />
Max was furious. He came over as quickly as he could once he finally got the call from Seth that he was ready to get to work.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey pal. Sorry about the late start, but - &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Where is your half of the paper, Seth?&quot; Max demanded, cutting to the chase.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s in my room. Let me take your coat and and I&#39;ll show you the way. My computer is in there too.&quot; He said eager to continue their visit.<br />
<br />
The room was spacious and made up for two boys of about the same age. The place was littered with sports equipment and memorabilia and a powerful teenage odor hung in the air. Seth started poking around in places, seemingly trying to find his work...<br />
<br />
&quot;Not finding it?&quot; Max asked with irritation.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, but it&#39;s here... My brother might have moved it, he&#39;s always touching my stuff. I wrote it last night and I did a really good job... I think I left it on the skateboard rack?..&quot; He said distractedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t even see a skateboard rack in here.&quot; Max said losing patience.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. I&#39;m not sure we own one.&quot; Seth said confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my God, I don&#39;t believe this.&quot; Max said starting to flip out. &quot;You don&#39;t bring the paper to school, then you wait after dark to call me, then you can&#39;t even find the paper in your house and to top it all off, you can&#39;t even find the place in your own house where you think you left it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, sorry. But I can probably remember what I wrote, it was really good stuff... Remind me what it was supposed to be about.&quot; He said earnestly.<br />
<br />
&quot;David Copperfield&quot; Max said with reluctance and exhaustion.<br />
<br />
&quot;The magician?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;AAAAAHhhh! I don&#39;t believe this! Why did I have to get stuck with you again of all people? My grade is already tanking thanks to you!&quot; Max said, shuddering with anger.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m really sorry man, but it&#39;s alright. We can write something up real quick right now.&quot; Seth said, tossing Max&#39;s jacket on his bed and taking a seat in front of the computer. <br />
<br />
The office chair had a soft, well worn jacket draped over the front of its backrest, the arms poofed out to the sides looking sporty and fun. Seth pulled up a word processing program and began hunting and pecking on his keyboard.<br />
<br />
D-a-v-i-d- -C-o-p-e-r-f-e-e-l-e-d- -i-s- -<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me do the typing&quot; Max grumbled, dismissing Seth from the driver&#39;s seat. &quot;In fact, let me do everything, just pay attention while I explain to you every facet of our SHARED literary analysis... You know what? Just watch the movie on your phone... I&#39;ll explain our analysis to you when I&#39;m done.&quot;<br />
<br />
Max got down to business, he wanted to go home and work from his own computer but he wasn&#39;t going to leave and let Seth totally screw around. If nothing else he was going to be sure the guy watched the movie and absorbed at least the most perfunctory understanding of the material.<br />
<br />
About a couple hours later Seth heard the door open. &quot;Hey Bry. How was school today?&quot; &quot;Hey, uh... Mom? Uh, good I guess. Where&#39;s Seth?&quot; &quot;In your room, but he&#39;s working with a study buddy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bry leaned around the corner peaking his head into his room for the first time. He got a look at Max and gestured for Seth to pull the jacket onto his shoulders.<br />
<br />
Seth tried pulling the left shoulder gently up onto Max but he was clearly in no mood to have his personal space violated.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing? Go back over there and watch your book. I&#39;m almost done&quot; Max snapped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, bro.&quot; Bry said, entering the room. &quot;You wanna protein shake?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure. Thanks Bry.&quot; Seth replied<br />
<br />
&quot;How about you kid?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Max. No.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bry returned shortly after with a liter of frothy chocolate colored protein product. Seth took it from him and began to drink it happily. Bry gestured to Max&#39;s jacket, indicating he wanted Seth to spill the drink on it through pantomime. Seth complied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, shit... Sorry dude. I spilled all over your jacket.&quot; Seth said, feigning acting chops.<br />
<br />
Max turned to look at the jocks with a furious expression on his face that melted into tired, worn, pitiable despair . &quot;I can&#39;t. I can&#39;t. I can&#39;t. Not anymore. I can&#39;t. That&#39;s it, that&#39;s all I can take. I&#39;m done. I can&#39;t. I can&#39;t. I can&#39;t.&quot; Max blathered, as though he were arguing with himself. He got up from the desk and started heading to the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait it&#39;s cold. Take this jacket.&quot; Seth said, offering him the Jock jacket. &quot;I&#39;ll get yours cleaned and bring it to school tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
Max walked out the door into the freezing air ignoring Seth&#39;s words. He&#39;d rather wear nothing than don that knuckle dragger&#39;s clothing... But then, it WAS terribly cold... He turned back and grabbed the jacket with irritation and foisted it over his shoulders. He began to trudge his way home when he heard Seth shout from his porch that he&#39;d email him the stuff he&#39;d written on his computer and that he&#39;d see him tomorrow.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Can&#39;t wait.&quot; Max thought</p>
