<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sarah sighed, pinching the bridge of her nose in frustration. The last few days proved to be trying.<br />
<br />
It started with an attack on the Morelands. Sources relayed to S.P.E.A.R stated that the Moreland&#39;s son, Connor, was viciously attacked by a vampire. Those same sources then told Sarah that said vampire was an elite advisor to the Tepes family. Sarah immediately understood what that meant. Serious issues were about to transpire between the current hunter, Caleb Moreland, and the vampires.<br />
<br />
Sarah&#39;s concerns became reality after Caleb breached security. She still wasn&#39;t quite sure how he had accomplished that, but it led to a diplomatic crisis. Caleb brutally assaulted Wyatt Tepes, murdering two vampires in the process. Sarah was able to stop him yet the damage was done. The Tepes family barred any hunter from entering their domain and the Morelands were not returning her phone calls.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sarah, you wished to see me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah glanced up, a weary smile on her face as she gazed at Aoloa. &quot;Yeah, take a seat.&quot; she said. Aoloa did as she was told, the Hawaiian woman giving her a concerned look. &quot;Aoloa were you able to visit Connor?&quot; she asked. Aoloa shook her head no, a glum expression on her face. &quot;I couldn&#39;t get within 50 feet of the Moreland boy,&quot; she sighed. &quot;Nina and Caleb&#39;s girlfriend both stopped me. Neither looked very happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just what I need,&quot; Sarah groaned. &quot;Wizards pissed off about this too.&quot; Sarah sighed, the entire fiasco was proving to be a nightmare. Unfortunately, Caleb left her no choice. Despite working with hunters and the church, she couldn&#39;t sanction the execution of a powerful lord within the vampire nation. S.P.E.A.R needed to remain neutral, protecting all under its auspices. She couldn&#39;t pick sides in this conflict, even if evidence showed that Caleb maybe right. An official investigation needed to be conducted, after that if Wyatt was shown to be guilty, he would face consequences. &quot;I just hope I&#39;m not making a mistake.&quot; Sarah said wearily.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re not,&quot; Aoloa counciled. &quot;You&#39;ve taken a measured approach. We can not take sides, we need to be an arbiter of justice.&quot; Sarah nodded a small smile cracking across her weary face. &quot;Do you think Wyatt did it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Aoloa paused, taking a moment to compose herself. &quot;I&#39;ve always been distrustful of vampires,&quot; she stated. &quot;Up until recently I wouldn&#39;t have believed a word that came out of their mouths. However, something feels off about this. I&#39;ve seen how Wyatt has governed since retaking his home. He wouldn&#39;t put his family in danger to settle a score with the Morelands. I believe we&#39;ve done the right thing.&quot; A small smile now cracked across Sarah&#39;s face, the woman thanking Aoloa for her honesty. It was the first bit of good news she had received in days.<br />
<br />
&quot;Director McMillan you have visitors,&quot; a voice called over the loud speaker. Sarah answered, saying she would be right there. Hopefully this wasn&#39;t bad news. As she exited her office, a feeling of dread washed over her as she gazed at a very angry looking Nina Moreland. &quot;Nina I...&quot;<br />
<br />
SMACK<br />
<br />
Sarah gawked, her cheek stinging from Nina&#39;s slap. &quot;You pulled a gun on my son?!&quot; she exclaimed angrily. &quot;After everything my husband did for you? This is how you honor his memory?!&quot; Sarah rubbed her cheek, shocked by Nina&#39;s actions. &quot;Nina I don&#39;t know what Caleb told you..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He hasn&#39;t said a word,&quot; Nina replied, cutting off Sarah mid sentence. &quot;Obviously you didn&#39;t pay attention to what Jacob does. Hunters always have a way of finding out.&quot; Sarah had no answer, noting the look on Nina&#39;s face. It was a mixture of rage and disgust. Sarah could tell that Nina felt S.P.E.A.R had betrayed her family. &quot;I came here today to tell you we&#39;re done,&quot; Nina said. &quot;Stay away from my children! I&#39;ve also come to tell you that anything Jacob gave you is leaving with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nina I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Sarah stated. &quot;I was doing my job, but everything Jacob gave to our agency, he gave of his own volition. I&#39;m not turning over the hunters records. We need those to do our job effectively.&quot; That should have been the end of it. Jacob&#39;s diary on the supernatural was an invaluable resource. A resource provided to S.P.E.A.R that greatly assisted in their duties. The sinister smile on Nina&#39;s face though made Sarah&#39;s blood run cold. Nina simply beckoned to a figure behind her. A figure Sarah had only met once. Archbishop Peter Castignoli.<br />
<br />
&quot;Director McMillan,&quot; Peter stated. &quot;We received word from our sources about the confrontation between the young Moreland and the head of the Tepes family.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Sarah said slowly. &quot;However, Caleb acted rashly. I can&#39;t support a hunter that&#39;s acting as a rogue agent, trying to assassinate a head of state.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In the eyes of hunters and the church, vampires have no rights.&quot; Peter said firmly. &quot;For centuries, long before this agency or this country existed hunters protected humanity from creatures of the night. You interfered in matters that do not concern you. In matters such as this, the hunter code states that the aggrieved party may seek retribution.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah was flabbergasted, her anger rising. Not her concern? S.P.E.A.R was founded to police and protect the supernatural. She was within her rights to protect the Tepes family from Calebs vengeance. &quot;As of now,&quot; Peter continued. &quot;The church and the hunters will no longer cooperate with this organization. All records Jacob Moreland bequethed to S.P.E.A.R shall be returned to the Morelands.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Sarah was about to answer, she noticed several agents now stand. &quot;Archbishop Castignoli,&quot; one agent said. &quot;We&#39;ve got the Moreland files.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very good,&quot; Peter replied, turning to an obviously confused Sarah. &quot;Did you think that the hunters and the church wouldn&#39;t have individuals working within your agency,&quot; he asked. &quot;Our people have been here since the very beginning. We&#39;ve been keeping an eye on you the whole time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah simply gawked, watching as Nina, several of her agents, and the Archbishop turned to leave. &quot;One last thing princess,&quot; Peter called, Sarah&#39;s stomach churning in alarm. The church knew about her heritage. &quot;I would suggest calling your mother. Your other mother to be precise. Hunters have taken this offense very seriously. Quite a few of your....people may find themselves unemployed. The queen is about to have an unemployment crisis on her hands.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah could do little more than watch as Nina, the Archbishop, and close to a dozen agents now departed. All Sarah could do now was wonder what was next for not only the fae but for S.P.E.A.R as well.</p>
