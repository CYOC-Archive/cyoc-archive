<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jim hurries over to the athletic wing of the high school. Figuring he could use a restroom there to change into the jockstrap, he passes the football locker room and goes into the general restroom. The door didn't lock, Jim knew he should probably hurry if he wanted to see what he looked like in this thing.<br />
<br />
Jim threw his backpack into a corner and looked at himself in the mirror. A skinny kid with barely any hair on his body and a light dusting of acne on his face. Jim removes his collar shirt and t-shirt, revealing his skinny chest. He unbuckles his belt and kicks off his shoes and socks, stripping down to his boxers. Jim tries to do a muscle pose but his skimpy body barely shows anything. Just a skinny kid.<br />
<br />
Reaching into his backpack he unfurls the jockstrap and examines it. The white strap also has a glistening glow to it, as if there's something extra embedded in the cloth, not like a normal substance. It's almost supernatural. Jim sighs, wondering why he's doing something so ridiculous, and slides his boxers off, kicking to his small pile of clothes with his backpack. Standing back up and looking at his small dick and shriveled sac, his underdeveloped and unathletic looks causes him to frown. &quot;Well, maybe this will accentuate what I have at least...&quot; and Jim slips his feet through the strap and pulls it up his hairless legs to his crotch. He pullt he back part over his ass, noticing there's no ass cover, just a strap to wrap around it, and pulls the jock over his crotch.<br />
<br />
Throwing his arms down to his side, he looks at his nestled package. &quot;Hmm, seems a little bigger in this thing&quot; he tells himself, looking in the mirror.<br />
<br />
Upon closer examination, though Jim notices the jock give off a slight spark of electricity, tickling his package. &quot;Huh?&quot; he asks as he notices his package start to stretch out inside the jock strap. &quot;Holy shit...&quot; Jim whispers, &quot;what's happening to me?!&quot;<br />
<br />
The strap knocks Jim back toward the urinals as he feels his waist spasm in uncontrolled movements. “Oh shit!” he shouts as it rumbles across him. Jim looks down in horror and fascination. He notices the cloth start to liquify around his pecker and ass crack. He feels it reaching in for him, trying to get into his body, an oily substance moving out of the cloth and into Jim.<br />
<br />
Jim involuntarily tilts his head back and up toward the ceiling as he stretches his back, bending it backwards as he lifts his feet off the ground, balancing on his toes as he stretches his entire body. “Ohhh, yea!” he shouts. Looking at the cloth he sees the emanating blue glow of electricity become brighter as what appears to be streaks of electricity circle and stretch itself over the cloth, around the sides of his ass cheeks and to the back of the garment. “Fuck yea, I can feel it!” Jim shouts as the acne disappears from his face and it grows into muscular handsomeness.<br />
<br />
Bending his shoulder muscles back to their relaxed position, muscle starts to grow over his shoulder blades, protruding out, then wrapping down and into his biceps. They were becoming refined, strong, and assured. Looking down at his lower arms Jim notices veins begin to protrude and additional muscle warp itself.<br />
<br />
Then, grabbing his abs, Jim chuckles as they begin to expand. His abs contort and slim liquifying into almost a puddle of water, then began to grow outward: even, defined muscles forming an eight pack. They harden as the creases grow deep grooves into his body. As the muscle growth hits his waistline, new muscles begin to form on his quads and under his cloth, creating tight contours pushing against the garment.<br />
<br />
He grabs his butt as it starts to grow. His rear forms hard muscle on itself, growing outward, strong, further tightening the garment. His ass moves outside the straps as a deep and strong bubble forms. As the side ass muscles flex and lock in place, rounding to become a tight bubble butt, hair wraps around and onto his legs, creating a new thick layer of blonde hair over him. His thighs snap tall and grow, becoming refined and strong as he gains height. They then begin pecing outwards and matching the growth of his ass. They became like footballs as rock hard muscle grows into them. Hair also begins to grow on his legs, then up and around his man package. His pubes began to grow over his waistline, wrapping itself around his belly button and up, in a thin line toward his chest. There, hair begins growing, slightly but evenly, over his new man-pecs and chest. His arm hair grew and darkened and his arm pitts tuffed additional hair underneath.<br />
<br />
Looking down and checking out his growing body, Jim begins to chuckle at the pleasure. But even as he continues to transform into this musclular football star, becoming more and more intimidating, Jim becomes happier at the atheltic endurance rushing over him. Admiring himself as he continues to grow, Jim feels his package begin to fill out as it pushes hard against the cloth, his cock and balls becoming large and clearly defined behind the garment. Jim moves his hands to check out his new enormous package before more electric bolts spark out and over his growing, muscular body. “Oh fuck!” he shouts. “I can feel it...I can feel...powers!”<br />
<br />
If it wasn't enough for the jockstrap to turn Jim into an athletic champion, the blue cloud from within the garment starts to form outward and consume the body that's growing. Jim looks up at the mirror and smiles. He felt he was gaining something more than human. Something supernatural. Powers. The powers only the gods of ancient times could have held. The cloud quickly envelops him, violent, like a tornado, wrapping around his newly formed body. The transformation was still physical: his body slimmed to an even and proportionate mix of muscle; but Jim could feel he was also gaining supernatural powers. Electric bolts started forming within the clouds and gracefully running over his skin. Jim gained the power of transformation, the power to turn into anything he wanted, the power to read or control other peoples minds, to leave them at his will. The power of immortality and invisibility. The power to spread own power to others, if he wanted, or to enslave them. He began laughing as he gained the knowledge of all of this, realizing the liberation of becoming something so incredibly superhuman. His laughter grew louder while still under the cloud, all of these powers and more depositing into Jim.<br />
<br />
Still under the electric cloud of power Jim felt the jockstrap literally absorb into him, he became the jockstrap and the jockstrap became him. The now naked-Jim felt truly one with his godly body and abilities. His new identity complete, his naked and now natural form absorbing the last of his power acquisition. “Yes...” he shouts under the bolts of power, “I am power!”<br />
<br />
As the cloud of power poured and evaporated itself back into Jim's body he now stood there, complete with the transformation of the football god. The former shrimp truly became the master. Lifting his arms to reveal his naked self, Jim examines himself in all his naked, godly splendor. His package was huge but still proportional to the massively built and muscular body held within. Looking up at the ceiling, relishing in his power acquisition, Jim curled his arms in muscular relief. Looking down at his naked godly body transformed, Jim relished in his newfound existence. He flexes his arms and runs his hand along his chest and abs feeling his newly defined body. He turns to see his ass, tight and refined, a beauty even to the gods.<br />
<br />
Jim wonders what to do next with all his newfound power. He orders his jockstrap to grow over his crotch again, allowing the strap to find its place over his body. &quot;What do I do now?&quot; Jim asks in excitement.</p>
