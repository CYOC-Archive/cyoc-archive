<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff tried, but he couldn’t sleep at all that night. His mothers body that he now possessed made everything feel 10 degrees hotter. He wasn’t used to having all of that hair on his head, not to mention those “things” dangling from his chest. His body was sweating, and he was so tired. He had to get some kind of sleep so he could deal with this situation in the morning. Jeff typically slept naked in his old body, but he was sharing a bed with his dad for now, who happened to sleep in just his tighty whities. Jeff groaned to himself, but decided “Fuck it, he’s on the other side of the bed, it’ll be fine, he’s already sound asleep.” So he slipped off the night gown and climbed into bed naked, already feeling much cooler than before. Suddenly, a fart squeaked out from his dad’s side of the bed, along with a soft grunt. Jeff paused for a moment, then shuddered. He drifted off into sleep, praying that his dad would stay away from him.<br />
<br />
MIKE’S POV:<br />
<br />
Mike woke up the next morning, and stretched his arms out to stretch as he let out a yawn. He looks over, and saw Jane was still asleep, lightly snoring. “Huh, that’s strange. Jane never snores.” Mike looked a bit closer, and noticed that Jane wasn’t wearing any clothes. Little did he know, “Jane” was actually his own son in his wife’s body. Mike lifted up the covers to look down at his penis pitching a tent in his tighty whities, fully attentive to start the day. “Well,” thought Mike, “I can’t let this morning wood go to waste, not everyday you see these things at my age.” Back in Mike and Jane’s younger days , they’d always start off the morning by waking the other up with sex. Mike thought it’d be romantic to turn back the clock, just for today, especially with the changes he made last night to the chronivac to loosen Jane up. “Maybe after this she’ll relax a little, she seemed so tense yesterday.” Mike climbed over “Jane” and slowly started kissing her neck. It was at this point that “Jane” woke up.<br />
<br />
JEFF’S POV:<br />
<br />
Jeff opened his eyes, and to his horror, saw his dad on top of him in his tighty whities, harder than a rock. But just as Jeff was about to throw his dad off of him, he thought back to last night and the kissable lips he noticed his dad possessed. His curiosity got the better of him, and he thought “one kiss can’t hurt right? This is the only chance I’ll have to kiss them. But I DEFINITELY won’t take it further than that, that would be DISGUSTING.” Jeff kissed his dad’s lips, and his body filled with butterflies. Something he had been suppressing since last night started to boil over, and he had to stop now before he lost full control of his body’s instincts. Just as Jeff was about to push his dad off, his dad pulled down the waistband of his Fruit of the Loom’s, and the tip of a throbbing 5-inch penis stared right at Jeff. That same warm feeling in his stomach he had gotten earlier in the shower had reached a fever pitch. At that point, he couldn’t control himself as his body’s instincts started to take control, even though his mind was trying its hardest to protest.<br />
<br />
Jeff had never had sex before. He always thought that the first time he had sex would be with some cute girl from his class. He wanted to cry as he realized it was going to be with his dad instead. <br />
<br />
He thought back to the time his dad had given him “the talk” when he was 13. He was so embarrassed at the time, hearing his dad talk to him about sex. Now here he was, not only talking about sex, but about to actually have sex with his own father.<br />
<br />
The words his dad said to him all those years ago started to ring back to him, as his current body’s instincts began to take over. &quot;Alright son, now that you’re becoming a man, it’s time to talk about the birds and the bees. When a man and a woman love each other very much, they show it to each other by making love.&quot;<br />
<br />
Against his mind’s better judgement, Jeff rubbed his dad’s fat butt with his now feminine hands, struggling to grip it as his father’s entire bum was slippery with sweat.<br />
<br />
“Remember to always wear a condom. You don’t want to get a girl pregnant and have kids too early, like me and your mom did” his father words echoed in his mind.<br />
<br />
Jeff looked at his dad’s naked penis and noticed it had a slight curve upwards, just like his own used to have. There were wiry black hairs sticking out in every direction along the shaft, with a large black/gray bush right above the base. His dad clearly wasn’t the type to shave, as his balls were also covered in those same curly pubes that were all over his genitals. Mike’s penis dripped with precum, as he guided Jeff’s hand to stroke it up and down.<br />
<br />
“Sex is a beautiful gift from God, son. You should treat it as such. Sex isn’t filthy Jeff, it’s the purest form of love with someone” Jeff remembered his dad saying. <br />
<br />
Jeff watched in horror as his dad turn around on all fours. Mike presented his fat, pimply, pale butt right in Jeff’s face. Jeff experienced a mixture of excitement and disgust as his dad asked “Jane do you think you could eat my ass, just this once? I ate yours last time remember.” Before Jeff was able to respond, his dad let out a sigh and turned back around. “Thought it was at least worth a shot” said Mike, as he started to lower down onto Jeff. <br />
<br />
“Jeff as a man, you have to take charge. But at the same time, be gentle,” his dad told him when he was younger.<br />
<br />
Jeff’s vagina started to get wet, as he laid naked on his back. His dad was slowly moving towards him, grabbing onto Jeff’s boobs in the process. He was so shocked he couldn’t speak as his father slid his hairy penis gently into his pussy. The only thing he could muster out of his mouth was a soft whimper. <br />
<br />
“And remember Jeff, don’t do it with just anybody. You want it to be somebody you really love,” said his dad during their talk all those years ago. Ironically enough, this was someone that Jeff loved. Just not in the way he or his dad had in mind. <br />
<br />
With each thrust, his father’s huge hairy balls slapped against Jeff’s thighs as his dad moaned. He felt his dad’s hot smelly breath in his ear say “I love you so much Jane.” His caught a whiff of his dad’s BO from his armpits, and surprisingly thought it smelled… good? With a large thrust, his dad then let out a loud fart that immediately filled up the room with a foul odor. His dad laughed, “Heh, sorry. You know I get gassy in the morning sweetie,” his dad said in between grunts. To Jeff’s surprise however, the odor that had come from his dad’s rump only drove him crazier, as his body happily soaked up more of the pheromones.<br />
<br />
The last thing his dad told him during what was, up until right now, the most embarrassing moment of his life, was “Don’t worry about size, son. Trust me, it’s not the size of the ship, it’s the motion in the ocean.” <br />
<br />
Jeff’s mind was internally screaming for his body to stop as he felt his dad’s naked penis pounding against the walls of his vagina. While Mike thought he was having a romantic love making session with his wife, in reality he was unknowingly having dirty unprotected sex with his only son. <br />
<br />
Jeff experienced his first female orgasm during sex as wave after wave of pleasure poured over him, his vagina clenching around his dad’s beer-can-shaped shaft. Finally, with the moans getting louder and louder, his dad pulled out of him as he unloaded his seed. Rope after rope of cum sprayed out of his dad’s penis like a water sprinkler, and covered Jeff’s entire chest in hot semen. <br />
<br />
Jeff laid there in shock as his dad kissed him on the lips once again. “I love you Jane.” His naked father got up out of bed, snapped his old tighty whities up around his waist, and went into the bathroom. A fart echoed in the bathroom as his dad called out, “I’m gonna take a dump really quick, then we can go for round two. If you eat my ass this time, I’ll eat you out. Does that sound like a fair deal sweetie?”</p>
