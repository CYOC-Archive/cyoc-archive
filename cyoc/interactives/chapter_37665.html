<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Guy stood back, looking at the bottle, while Cray reached down with one big hand, to help Matt up off the floor. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dammit Cray, that stuff tasted like crap! What the hell is wrong with you?&quot; Matt asked angrily. <br />
<br />
Cray grinned a bit, and patted Matt on the shoulder, his huge muscles bunching and rolling as he did so, drawing Matt's eye. <br />
<br />
&quot;And how the hell did you get so big?&quot; Matt asked suspiciously, eying Cray's huge pecs. <br />
<br />
Cray chuckled, &quot;I told you, bud, I drank some of that stuff I just gave you. It makes you bigger, man. It's so fucking awesome!&quot; As Cray spoke, he raised his huge arms and flexed, his big biceps rising up high and hard and thick, big balls of muscle. As he did so, Guy walked up behind him, and mirrored the pose, his 500 pound body even bigger and freakier than Cray, his arms nearly twice the size of Cray's big guns. Matt's eyes were as wide as saucers as he looked at the two huge men flex, and he felt a stirring in his pants. He'd always admired Cray's gym-built physique, but he was surprised by how turned on he was by his buddy's new size.  Even more surprising to Matt was how much Guy's monstrous physique was turning him on. The 500 pound freak was making Matt a bit hot under the collar. Sweat began to trickle down his temple as he watched the two huge men, and he felt a little light headed. <br />
<br />
Then his entire body began to feel strange, tight and heavy at the same time, like his skin had shrunk. Matt felt his clothes tighten around him, cutting off his circulation, molding to his body like a second skin. With a shock, he realized that he was growing!<br />
<br />
Guy and Cray lowered their arms, watching with interest and anticipation as Matt slowly began to grow, right in front of them. Their broad grins got even wider as they watched Matt slowly fill his clothes, thick muscle swelling beneath the fabric, his face a mask of confusion and... desire? Cray in particular was surprised, as his friend had never shown much interest in becoming bigger before. Guy, who didn't know Matt, nonetheless recognized the look that was growing in Matt's eyes: the desire to be a freak. <br />
<br />
Matt's shirt began to tear, his now-large and still growing arms pushing through the sleeves, as his big chest and back slowly forced the seams of the shirt to pop, one at a time. Matt began to pant, his big pecs heaving, as the shirt slowly tore off of his growing body. He reached 250 pounds in less than a minute, and threw his head back and groaned, as he tore the last shreds of shirt from his body, revealing his rippling, muscular torso. Cray and Guy grinned, and approached the growing man, groping his thick pecs, pulling on his erect nipples. Matt moaned loudly, as pleasure shot through him due to the attentions of the huge men. His rate of growth increased, and his already-large muscles began to truly swell impressively, becoming thicker, harder, more massive with each passing second, as he reached 350 pounds, the same size as Cray, his jeans slowly tearing apart as his meaty legs forced the tough fabric to yield to their size and power. He brought his arms up to flex, his biceps big and hard and powerful. He looked at them with wonder, watching them get bigger and bigger, as Guy and Cray began to run their hands over Matt's huge arms, admiring the huge biceps and thick triceps. Lower, Matt kicked the ruined remains of his jeans and shoes aside. He was standing there in only his underpants, which stretched so tight over his thick glutes, powerful hips, and mighty cock, that they were nearly transparent. Still Matt grew, until he was Guy's size, at a whopping 500 pounds of massive, hard muscle. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh fuck yeah...&quot; Matt groaned, looking at his huge arms.  When he realized he was the same size as Guy, it sent him into overdrive, his cock swelling prodigiously, tearing through his underwear, leaving him utterly nude. &quot;Fuck, so hot...&quot; he murmured, his voice several octaves deeper than when he came in. Guy and Cray were going nuts, pulling, pushing, and groping his huge body, feeling the massive muscles that rippled hard and huge, running their tongues over his hard ridges, exploring the deep cuts between his huge muscles. And Matt grew, even bigger than Guy even, his body growing taller and broader to accommodate his monstrous size. He reached 600 pounds, then 700, laughing maniacally in an ever-deepening voice, huge cock leaking precum as his oversized balls churned with excitement.  At last, as he reached 800 pounds of freaky muscle, Matt's growth slowed and then stopped.  He looked at the huge freaks worshiping him, and noted how much bigger, how much freakier he was, than either of them.  He chuckled, and strode across the room, the floor shaking with each step. Guy and Cray looked after him, lust in their eyes, as Matt approached the mirror on the wall. Matt filled it completely, just with his huge torso. He flexed, admiring the mass of muscle that was reflected in the mirror, frustrated that he was unable to see every bit of his magnificent new form, yet also turned on that he was too much man for even a rather large mirror. Guy and Cray came up behind him, their hands on his powerful glutes, running across his massive back and enormous arms.  Matt smirked. &quot;So boys, what do you think?&quot;</p>
