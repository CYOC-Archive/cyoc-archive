<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Clover pointed out &#39;That&#39;s where the guys will be&#39; then trotted off towards the kitchen. She told Bill that she would see him in their room at 6.45.<br />
<br />
As soon as Bill rounded the corner he was beset by people he knew and some he didn&#39;t and was continually asked &quot;How are you feeling?&#39; Everyone assumed he would be nervous and consequently he was. He was happy when his soon to be brother in-laws rescued him from the crowd, passed him a beer while they watched a makeshift soccer game. He didn&#39;t know how to take the repeated assurances from the others. As Charlie said: &#39;Don&#39;t be concerned. We&#39;ve all been through this. You will be a better man for the experience&#39;<br />
<br />
Time passed pretty quickly and he was surprised to see it was nearly 7. He quickly made excuses and hurried back to his room. There he found Clover tarting herself up. She was still in the &quot;Christmas Dress&quot; and back in her heels and was applying make-up. &#39;What do you think?&#39; she asked Bill &#39;Have I done a good job?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;You look sensational&#39; was Bill&#39;s response.<br />
<br />
She had Bill put on his suit and have a fresh shave. he didn&#39;t understand why. He had only shaved that morning but it was her family so he didn&#39;t argue. As soon as he finished she took his hand and led the way to the dining room.<br />
<br />
They entered and Bill couldn&#39;t help but notice the huge smile on Clover&#39;s face. He felt chuffed that she seemed to be so pleased to be on his arm. They took two seats next to Jim on what turned out to be one of two adults tables. Another table was dedicated for kids. They ranged from Oscars toddlers to some older teenagers. Clover explained &#39;You move to the adult table when you are 18&#39;<br />
<br />
Bill&#39;s table was filled with people of Clovers generation. Her parents sat at the third table with her Grandparents and Uncle Eric sat together at the head. The way the tables were arranged the grandparents could see the whole room.<br />
<br />
Jim told Bill that Clare was breast feeding young Jack and join them as soon as she could get the little fellow asleep. <br />
<br />
Across the table from him were Oscar and Rose his wife. Oscar and Jim began talking about babies. Evidently Oscars twin girls, like Jack were too young to participate, even though unlike Jack they were sitting in high chairs immediately behind Rose.<br />
<br />
Clare arrived telling everyone that Jack was &#39;Asleep. Keep your fingers crossed. I didn&#39;t let him nap this afternoon, so I&#39;m hoping he will sleep for at least the next few hours&#39;<br />
<br />
No sooner had Clare taken her seat she had to get up again. All the woman under about 30 in the room became waitresses and went through a door returning with a meal in each hand which was placed in front of each guest. Clover gave Bill a curtsy as she placed a roast dinner in front of him. &#39;Enjoy your meal sir&quot; she said with a cheeky smile on her face. <br />
<br />
Everyone waited until the women had retaken their seats before &quot;Ma&quot; said Grace then asked everyone to dig in.<br />
<br />
Bill was had just cleaned up his plate and was talking footy with Jim, when he heard a tapping on a glass. The room became silent, Even the kids table.<br />
<br />
Bill followed everyone else gaze to the front table where Uncle Eric stood. <br />
<br />
&#39;Welcome everyone to another Williams/Wilson Christmas. Most of you want me to sit back down so we can get on with business but we do have one new member of the family so I would like to say a word of welcome to Bill, who is going to marry our very own Clover. I hope everyone welcomes Bill into the family over the next week&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;So for Bill&#39;s benefit I will explain the proceeding for the night. &#39;Our annual Christmas tradition is that every year, we spend some time walking in another person&#39;s shoes...literally. Over the next week, you&#39;ll be swapping bodies with someone else&#39;<br />
<br />
The room gave a cheer. Half the room had turned and were looking at Bill. Had he heard right?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Yes Bill&#39; Uncle Eric continued &#39;When you leave this room you will be someone else&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;As usual we will start with the kids table then proceed to the adults&#39; So kids one at a time starting with Lori at the end there, I want you to come up, select a present from under that tree then proceed to the bathroom. Bill for your benefit there is an article of clothing in each present. Once you&#39;ve picked it, you&#39;ll go to the bathroom, unwrap it, and touch the sparking stone that&#39;s hanging on the wall. Your body will then be changed into the owner of the clothing you received&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;This is a joke right?&#39; said Bill to Clover. &#39;He can&#39;t be serious&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;You think so? Watch Lori&#39;<br />
<br />
Bill watched as a blonde girl of about 9 or 10 in a red dress went up to the Christmas tree. She bent down and picked up a present. Bill noticed that all the presents were wrapped in the same patterned paper Clover had given him to wrap his hat in. <br />
<br />
In front of everyone she unwrapped the present to find what appeared to be a set of pink girls tights. A woman who was by the tree and apparently supervising asked her &#39;Are they your own?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Nope&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Well proceed. You know what to to&#39; <br />
<br />
Lori went through a door behind the tree. Meanwhile the boy of about 12 who had been sitting to the left of Lori had approached the tree. the tree. He too selected a present. The woman didn&#39;t need to ask the boy if the clothing he revealed was his own. He held up what appeared to be a a white and green cheerleaders uniform. There were shrieks of laughter from the kid&#39;s table. A 15 year old girl was cackling with delight. Clover explained to Bill &#39;That&#39;s Stephen, he has just picked out his sister&#39;s cheer-leading uniform&#39;<br />
<br />
Stephen was flushed red but he had a big grin on his face. He waited by the door, not entering. There was about a minute wait before the door opened and a little girl of about 5 or 6 stepped out. There were gasps from the floor. The girl was in a a simple dressing gown and she kicked out a leg to show she was wearing pink tights. Bill recognised the girl. She was one of Charlie and Michelle&#39;s. &#39;That&#39;s Nicky&#39; he explained to Clover&#39; <br />
<br />
&#39;For the next week she is. But if you look at the kids table you will see the real Nicky down the end&#39; replied Clover<br />
<br />
Bill looked and sure enough a twin of the girl out the front was laughing at the kid&#39;s table.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile Stephen had entered what must be the bathroom Eric had referred to and another older boy of maybe 15 got up and chose a present. He opened up what appeared to be a Spiderman costume. The older teenagers laughed at him. <br />
<br />
After another wait a teenage girl who amply filled out her cheer-leading uniform emerged from the door. She had a big smile on her face and did a pirouette. That got some of the adults standing up and clapping. Someone yelled out &#39;Way to go Stephen&#39; <br />
<br />
Meanwhile the boy with the Spiderman costume had entered the bathroom and the next person who walked up to the tree was the twin of the cheerleader. Bill was starting to believe.<br />
<br />
The proceedings continued. One by one the kids went to the tree, selected a present, revealed what was inside then entered the bathroom. A different kid emerged always wearing the present. To Bill it didn&#39;t make sense. One very large teenage boy who looked 18 to Bill had unwrapped his present to reveal a pink dress. The girl of about 4 who emerged looked very pretty in her party dress but didn&#39;t seem to be particularly happy.<br />
<br />
When the kids finished the evening paused. Those kids who had emerged in dressing gowns went back to the tree and were presented with clothing by the woman who had been supervising the present choosing. Most just went to the the corner of the room to dress. They didn&#39;t appear to be worried about being semi naked in front of their family. Meanwhile the used plates were cleared by the young women and dessert bought out. Bill was happy to see it was Christmas pudding and custard. Once more Clover acted as his waitress with a big smile on her face.<br />
<br />
Bill asked Jim &#39;How did they do that? What&#39;s in that room?&#39;<br />
<br />
Jim replied. &#39;It&#39;s real Bill. You will soon find out&#39;</p>
