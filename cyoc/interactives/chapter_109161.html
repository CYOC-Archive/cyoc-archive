<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Benton was about to help tear down the large open buffets tent when; to his surprise the entire catering staff was able to complete the task within minutes. Watching the cooks as well as John Shaffer, who clearly had a noticeable spring in his step take the remaining food, covering it in tin foil and placing it in the kitchen. After noticing Frieda and her friends devour a nearly whole quarter of roast beef; Benton figured it would be best to leave the leftover food available as a quick means for breakfast. He understood that weres get extremely hungry after intense sex; the fact that Frieda was right in catching him raiding the fridge a time or two after an intense session with Amanda, proved that she was not wrong in her and her friends feeling the urge to eat like no tomorrow.<br />
<br />
“Well, that’s just about it,” Franklin approaching Benton Knight; “hope this gathering met your expectations.”<br />
“It is what it is,” Benton looking up at windows to Frieda’s room; “your staff did an excellent job. You can be sure of more work in the future. Oh and the guests did love the croquembouche tower John made earlier.”<br />
“Well the kid does have a deft paw when it comes to pastries,” Franklin beams; “hell give him ketchup and he’ll figure out a way to turn it into spaghetti sauce that would make any Italian chef envious.”<br />
“And I can’t even make toast,” Benton snorts; “I’ll be glad when Ethel our cook comes back. She is on her honeymoon.”<br />
“Congratulations then,” Franklin responding; “her husband must be a lucky person.”<br />
“John our chauffer is happy,” Benton sighing; ‘and so am I’, Benton thinking to himself. With Amanda taking it upon herself to try and get the staff back, despite recovering in the hospital from injuries sustained in a car wreck and a hookworm infection form tainted civet coffee; Benton was feeling lucky in that regard.<br />
“Well,” Franklin extending his paw out to Benton; “it was a pleasure.”<br />
<br />
Benton silently nods as he accepts the were-dogs paw and watches him and the staff leave his estate. Knowing that there are still were-panthers in the surrounding wood; the fact that he can hear a few still yowling as they rut; Benton heads back inside and locks his doors. “The stragglers know they need to leave before sunrise,” Benton speaks to himself. Grabbing a bottle of water he heads to his study but stops at the stairs to listen.<br />
<br />
After listening for a moment and satisfied that the Eric, Spencer and Frieda are asleep; Benton is about to pad to his study when he hears joyous yowling as the three were clearly still rutting.<br />
“I hope you three are going to go to sleep soon,” Benton mutters; “I don’t want to be forced to sit in Frieda’s room and watch you three.”<br />
<br />
Heading to his study; Benton inserts the USB Drive lance gave him earlier. Reading the articles detailing John’s family tragedy was just as John described earlier when prepping in the kitchen. Lance was also right; what John stated was a sanitized version. Closing the files and removing the drive; Benton takes a sip from the water bottle he grabbed when his phone rang. Seeing it is Lance he answers it.<br />
“Alright what is it now.”<br />
“Liz Baker,” Lance answers; “she knows through Jack Crawford that you have a medical issue. She wouldn’t elaborate, but she does know that Jack Crawford is planning to force a vote of confidence at the next shareholders meeting.”<br />
Benton swore; “over my dead body. What’s Liz angle on this, why tell you?”<br />
“Her answer,” Lance responds; “better the devil you know. She would rather have you in charge then Jack. And since the meeting is in New York after New Years Day-“<br />
“I can’t attend thanks to the council’s edict,” Benton feeling enraged; “Just fucking great!”<br />
“What if you changed the date of the meet,” Lance asks; “can you not do that?”<br />
“No, nor relocating it here” Benton thinking; “but perhaps I can have a proxy there in my place.”<br />
“Oh no,” Lance knowing full what Benton was thinking about; “I’m not heading to New York for you, I don’t even own stock.”<br />
“Frieda does thank to the trust you have kept safe;” Benton speaking.<br />
“She is still a minor,” Lance answering; ”and you are forgetting the fact that she has to remain in Moon Lake for her training to take over as were-panther rep in the elder council.”<br />
“Amanda would do it,” Benton thinking; “but she would probably get distracted shopping up and down Fifth Avenue.”<br />
“Her favorite street I take it,” Lance chuckling; “but getting back on track, I could talk to the council but I doubt they’ll change their mind in regard to letting you leave.” Lance thinking for a moment and sighing; “I might know someone who could help. But before I tell you Benton, you need to promise me you won’t flip out and go on a tear.”<br />
“Okay,” Benton answering; wondering who Lance might be asking about, “who did you have in mind?”<br />
<br />
Lance is silent while he contemplates the possible ramifications with what he is about to say.<br />
“Who did you have in mind Lance,” Benton getting impatient.<br />
“Far Houjin,” Lance answers; “he got a hold of me earlier today, wanting me to kill the story regarding him and his grandson’s disappearance.”<br />
“Well fuck me sideways,” Benton sounding surprised; “how did he do that?”<br />
“By E-mail,” Lance lying; “but he did contact me just before you called me in regards to John Shaffer.”<br />
“Well that explains why you were testy with me when I called,” Benton answering; “what did the man want from you?”<br />
“What I said,” Lance answering but omitting the real reason and the fact Far and Kai are in Moon Lake; “to kill my story. I told him no.”<br />
“Good,” Benton smiling; “if it forces him out of what hole he is meditating in then great. Look I got to get some sleep. But I’ll look into what you suggested. If worse comes to worse, I’ll get Amanda to act as my proxy and get premature grey as she racks up a massive credit card bill.” <br />
<br />
Benton hangs up and thinks on what Lance just said. &quot;why do I have a feeling Lance isn&#39;t telling me everything;&quot; Benton thinks to himself as he leaves his study, turning off the lights and heads off to bed.<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Lance was heading back to bed after making efforts to keep Lila from overhearing the phone call he just made. Lance quickly composes a text to Tachibana.<br />
&#39;Please advise your house guests that an outsider by the name of Jack Crawford is making great efforts to interfere with their plans. Request a face to face to discuss.&#39;<br />
Hitting send Lance heads back inside from his backyard. Getting into the hallway of his small bungalow Lance gets a response from Tachibana.<br />
<br />
&#39;Please come to my estate for lunch tomorrow.&#39;<br />
Lance reading the message, closes his phone and heads back to bed. Observing the sleeping were-tigress that was his girlfriend; Lance climbs back in and goes back to spooning her.</p>
