<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff awoke to the familiar sensation of his morning wood. When light started being processed in his brain, he saw and remembered that he no longer lived in his old room. Having his father as a boyfriend seemed like a daydream he’d had yesterday, but sure enough, his naked dad was right to the left of him, under the sheets. <br />
<br />
Jeff couldn’t resist taking another look. He lifted the sheets, and his mouth dropped when he saw that Matt also had morning wood. His dick looked a lot more substantial hard, standing at six inches. <br />
<br />
Judging by Matt’s hard nipples, he was a bit cold. “I can fix that,” thought Jeff. Jeff then turned around and backed up his cute little butt to his father’s erection, separating his cheeks to give it somewhere to go. He could feel the head of his dad’s penis on his hole. Matt must’ve started to have a sex dream, because he unconsciously grabbed Jeff’s hips and started thrusting a bit.<br />
<br />
Matt hadn’t had sex since the chronivac had accidentally made him Jeff’s girlfriend/boyfriend. It’s not like his former wife had sex with him every day, far from it truth be told. But whenever he needed to bust a nut he would just jerk off. The reason he hadn’t done so yesterday was because he was now at a honeymoon stage with Jeff. Jeff had been with Jessica for a while, and for her, the sexual tension had been building up. Now, that sexual tension was a trait inherited by Matt, and consequently he was waiting to have sex with his boyfriend.<br />
<br />
Jeff laid there and accepted his dad’s thrusting. His hole wasn’t being penetrated but with a little lube that probably would’ve been different. He still enjoyed the repeated pressure, and his prostate was still being stimulated to a degree without the penetration. And there was the kinky aspect that Jeff was being pounded by his formerly straight father.<br />
<br />
Matt woke up and realized what he was doing. “I’m sorry Jeff, I must’ve been having a good dream! I don’t wanna pressure you into taking things any faster.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t apologize Dad, it actually felt really good. I instigated it by grinding on your morning wood. Guess I couldn’t help myself, sorry,” said Jeff apologetically.<br />
<br />
“Don’t ever apologize for that, it felt really good for me too,” explained Matt.<br />
<br />
“Well as far as I’m concerned, you can wake me up the same way. Your ass is heaven, dad,” said Jeff.<br />
<br />
“It must be, because it took me an hour to fall asleep last night and your cock was hard against my ass for the whole time. It felt amazing...it kind of made me curious to bottom for you. You know, when you’re ready to have sex,” said Matt, blushing.<br />
<br />
“I think today is that day. But I don’t think I’m ready to bottom yet. Do you think your hole could open enough to let me in?” Asked Jeff.<br />
<br />
“With how badly I want you right now, I’d be surprised if it didn’t,” said Matt, who was clearly excited that Jeff was ready for sex.<br />
<br />
Matt got on all fours on the bed and told Jeff that there was a bottle of lube in his nightstand. Jeff retrieved the bottle and was told to start lubing up Matt’s “pussy”.<br />
<br />
“Of course babe,” said Jeff, giving his dad a kiss. It was nothing like kissing Jessica. His dad’s face had all this stubble that brushed against him, and he had a lot more experience in making out than Jessica ever did.<br />
<br />
Jeff spent a good fifteen minutes lubing his dad’s hole and gawking at it. His free hand kept his dad’s dick hard by playing with it. He could hardly believe that this manly man was offering his hole to him. He was really gonna penetrate his father!<br />
<br />
Jeff told Matt to get on his back, giving his lower back a pillow for support. Jeff began to descend into his dad’s hole. It was tight, but not as tight as Jeff’s would have been. In a minute they had gotten Jeff’s six and a half inches buried completely in Matt’s hairy bubble butt. Jeff played with his dad’s cheeks while his hole relaxed more for the actual fucking bit.<br />
<br />
A minute later they were cleared for take off. Matt’s dad-pussy was feeling looser, and could now taking a pounding. Jeff took the cues and started to fuck him.<br />
<br />
The men moaned in joy for an hour, when all of the sudden Matt stopped moaning. He looked concerned.<br />
<br />
“Jeff?? What are you doing inside me— uhhhn—,” that moan Matt had tried and failed to hold back.<br />
<br />
“What do you mean, dad? Uhhhn— You’re my boyfriend, you’ve been waiting so long for me to be ready to have sex with you,” Jeff said as he continued to pump, almost ready to cum.<br />
<br />
<br />
“I’m not your boyfriend, I’m your father! Now get out of me this— instan— Ohhhhhh godddd,” moaned Matt. His body had taken to much stimulation, he couldn’t stop the prostate orgasm he was having with his own 16 year old son’s dick still inside him. His legs buckled and his whole body shook. This was easily the most intense orgasm that Matt had ever had.<br />
<br />
Jeff realized that the chronivac operators must’ve fixed Matt’s inappropriate relationship with him, but he looked down on the straight man he knew as his father, who was having the best anal orgasm ever, and he didn’t want to be the one who didn’t cum, so he kept on pumping despite his dad’s wishes. Within the minute he moaned and came hard into his dad’s hole. His dad made a funny shocked face as he felt the warm liquid coat his insides. Jeff was in so much trouble, and it was so worth it.</p>
