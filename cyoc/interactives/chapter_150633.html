<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Katie stretched as the light now began to shine through her hotel window. Gloria, Thankfully, had fallen asleep relatively quickly and did not throw up again. The two college age women had experience with this kind of thing though and placed Gloria on her side with a trash can strategically placed close to her head. As Katie now got out of bed she quickly checked on her sister.<br />
<br />
“How’s Gloria?”<br />
<br />
“She’s okay,” Katie said quietly as she turned towards her fiancé. “She’s gonna have one hell of a hangover though. Hope she remembers that the next time she wants to drink.” Kellie chuckled softly as she brushed some stray hairs away from the Gloria’s face. “So you want to get her something to help with the hangover?” Katie nodded as she dressed quickly. “Yeah,” she said. “Was going to head downstairs. See if they have Gatorade and Tylenol, that usually does the trick.” Kellie smiled, giving her fiancé a quick kiss before watching Katie exit the room.<br />
<br />
Exiting the gift shop in the hotel lobby, Katie smiled. She had found everything she was looking for, now hopefully she would be able to get Gloria and Sasha back on their feet.<br />
<br />
 “Katie is that you?” Katie paused, turning , before a small smile spread across her face. “Hey Derrick,” she said. “Thought I saw you last night.” Derrick smiled as he now approached, the young teacher looked happy as he now struck up a conversation with his sisters friend. “Yeah Morgan and I checked in last night,” he said. “We’ve been planning on a little get away for awhile.”<br />
<br />
“Sounds nice,” Katie said. “Any reason or is it just a chance to get away?”<br />
<br />
“Definitely needed to get away,” Derrick chuckled. “Still looking for a place and lately the house seems like more of a daycare than anything and it’s about to get worse.”<br />
<br />
“What do you worse,” Katie asked. Derrick smirked as he now leaned in towards Katie. “We just found out yesterday that Kumikos pregnant again,” he said. “My folks are thrilled there getting another grandkid but it means any alone time for me and Morgan is going to be limited.”<br />
<br />
“Wow congrats,” Katie said happily. “I’ll tell Gloria and the others when I get upstairs.”<br />
<br />
“Gloria and her friends are here,” Derrick said curiously to which Katie nodded. Derrick rubbed his neck nervously as he began to glance around. “Hmm not sure how Morgan will take that? We usually try to keep things professional around your sister and her friends.”<br />
<br />
“Seriously Derrick,” Katie laughed. “The girls already know about you and Morgan so stop worrying.” Derrick frowned before sighing. “Okay good point,” he sighed. “Say listen, why don’t you and the others join us for breakfast. My treat.” Katie nodded, it was hard to pass up a free meal. Agreeing to breakfast she now headed upstairs to get the others. As Katie entered the room she could see Gloria slowly exiting the bathroom, holding her head as she groaned loudly.<br />
<br />
“Hey party girl,” Katie teased. “How you feeling?”<br />
<br />
“I am never drinking again,” Gloria groaned as she collapsed onto the bed. Katie smirked as she approached her sister. “Yeah next time drink In moderation,” she said. Taking out a couple of Tylenol and opening the Gatorade she now handed them to her sister. “Take these and finish this,” she said. “Trust me you’ll feel a lot better after.” Gloria nodded swallowing the Tylenol as she began to drink. “So I ran into Derrick in the lobby,” Katie said. “He’s invited us to breakfast with him and Morgan.”<br />
<br />
“That sounds nice,” Kellie said. Gloria took a swig if Gatorade as she now looked at Katie and Kellie. “Mr. Harris and Ms. Morgan are here,” she asked. Katie and Kellie giggled as they remembered seeing them last night. “We kind of spotted them last night when we were brining you upstairs,” Kellie giggled. “You weren’t exactly in the best shape when we saw them.”<br />
<br />
Gloria could only nod as she continued to drink, her head was still pounding but the Gatorade was helping. “Well I’m starved,” Gloria said quietly. “Let me just shower before we head down, pretty sure I still smell like vomit.”<br />
<br />
“About that,” Katie said sheepishly. “You see, Derrick May know about the ring but Morgan doesn’t. Do you really want to try and explain that to her right now?” Gloria groaned, now would not be the best time to try and explain that. “Ok fine,” she sighed. “But we should get the others too.” Katie nodded as she now went to wake the others while Gloria showered. <br />
<br />
Twenty minutes later, Katie, Gloria, And their friends now stood in Katie and Kellies room. Gloria’s friends, aside form Sasha, seemed to be none the worse for wear. Unfortunately Sasha seems to be nursing a hangover, almost as bad as Gloria’s. “Can you us some magic to make it darker please,” Sasha groaned. “It’s too bright.”<br />
<br />
“It’s the sun Sasha,” Naomi stated. “I don’t think we want to blot out the sun.” Sasha groaned loudly as she nursed a water bottle. “So what are we doing today,” Jackie asked.<br />
<br />
“Was thinking we all have breakfast,” Katie said. “I ran into Derrick Harris in the lobby, he said he would treat us to breakfast.”<br />
<br />
“Awesome cause I’m starving,” Diane said. Katie rubbed her neck sheepishly as she looked at the magically grown teens. “There’s just one problem,” she said. “Morgan is with him and while he knows about the ring, she doesn’t.”<br />
<br />
“What Katie is trying to say,” Kellie interrupted. “Is that unless you girls want to let Morgan in on the secret, it would probably be best if you became your old ages once again. If only for a little while.” The girls frowned as they looked between one another, the girls all liked being a bit older, but their hunger was winning out. “If it helps,” Katie said quickly. “Gloria and Sasha, your hangovers should vanish if you go back to your original ages.”<br />
<br />
“Oh hell yea then,” Sasha said as she took another swig from her water bottle. “My head is killing me right now. If becoming 15 again will change that then sure.” The others looked at one another before agreeing. “Hey Jackie you think you can manage,” Gloria asked weakly. “Really not in any kind of shape to use magic right now.” Jackie gazed at her ring before nodding. She had never tried changing this many people at once, not without help. Taking a deep breath she now focused on making her friends 15 again.<br />
<br />
Katie and Kellie watched as Gloria and her friends began regressing once more. The five college aged women began to journey back into their teens. Gloria and her friends faces began to become more innocent as they retreated into their teens. The girls frowned as their curves began to recede, losing the maturity of young adulthood as they became waifish teens once more. Thankfully though the process was quick as the girls went from 21 to 15. As an added bonus for Gloria and Sasha they found that their hangovers vanished as they once again became teenagers.<br />
<br />
“Whoa that’s wild,” Gloria said quietly. “How did that happen.”<br />
<br />
“It’s the Ring,” Katie said. “It rejuvenates you, heals your body as you grow younger. All it did was speed up the process of the hangover going away.”<br />
<br />
“So you can do it all over again tonight,” Kellie smirked.<br />
<br />
Gloria and Sasha looked between eachother before emphatically saying no to drinking. The others laughed as they now made their way out of Katie and Kellies room, it would definitely be awhile before Gloria and Sasha drank again.</p>
