<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sam squealed as Colin's enhanced dick punched into his virgin hole. Like he was programmed to do, he enjoyed his brother's cock as much as any gay man would, wriggling and pumping back and moaning in hot lust.<br />
<br />
Colin reached around, cupping Sam's chest with one hand and his crotch with the other. Colin began grunting and pumping harder, hard enough to bruise Sam's backside. With a groan, he came in his brother's ass.<br />
<br />
Sam cried out as his chest expanded and a sudden stabbing feeling came in his crotch. Colin's hand now held not a 14-year-old boy's flat smooth chest, but a well-rounded breast. His finger in Sam's crotch, instead of pressing into a boy's groin, now sank into a moist girl's slit.<br />
<br />
Colin let Sam fall to the floor and sat down on his bed. Sam, dazed, got up and looked into the mirror. Reflected, he saw a gorgeous 14-year-old girl with short shining red hair and big blue eyes. Her groin held a red peachfuzz. Her tits were perfectly shaped and pert, not large, and her waist and hips gave her a suggestion of an hourglass shape. Sam thought she looked familiar.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like it?&quot; Colin said. &quot;You look exactly like Mom did when she was your age. She was hot, too - found pictures of her posing naked.&quot; He didn't bother to mention the Maker-created computer archive he created of every sexual encounter his mother ever had.<br />
<br />
Colin snapped his fingers, and Sam (now Samantha) rushed to his side, kenalt beside the bed, and began slurping on her brother's dick. The fact that it had last been in her own backend was irrelevant.<br />
<br />
Colin caressed his former brother's head as she eagerly sucked his dick. &quot;Don't worry - everyone will still see you as the snot boy you used to be. The only ones who see the real little fuck-toy are me and those I pick, and I can change my mind. So I can get your girl-ass fucked by people and then make you look like a boy again. A secret identity - 'The Amazing Slut-Girl'! Swoops out of nowhere, drains strangers of their cum, and vanishes. Only her brother knows of her secret identity as Sam the Wonder Twerp. I've ... 'arraanged' it,&quot; he said, looking at the computer with the Maker program running, &quot;So any guy you're with will be a real stud, fucking like a piston and ready to go a minute later. Cool, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam moaned in happy agreement.<br />
<br />
Colin felt himself hardening again. &quot;Remember last week? When you caught Josh and his buddy playing in the shed?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam moaned in sad agreement. Catching their little brother Josh and his friend with their pants down around their ankles had given Sam fuel to relentless yease and persecute his little brother. Now his rebuilt personality felt regret.<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Colin explained, &quot;You're going to make it up to him, but good! He's one of the ones who can see the real you, and you're going to be his special friend. You're going to go to his room tonight, and you're going to get royally laid. You'll tell him you're a magic girl and anyone in your bedroom can see her. You'll talk him into bringing all his buddies over, and you'll go 'around the world' with all of them. Won't that be fun?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam 'mmm-hmm'ed in agreement.<br />
<br />
Colin smiled so hard he almost hurt himself. Having had to put up with Sam's disgusting 'queer' and 'fag' jokes, not to mention seeing Josh cry because of Sam's teasing, the thought of Sam becoming Josh's slut appealed to him. Not only that, but being slut to the entire fifth grade. Besides, it would be a nice thing to do, letting all those 10-year-old boys get a taste of a real whore.<br />
<br />
Colin's dick was hard, and Sam tried to climb on board, eager to get her brother's cock into her newly-minted virgin pussy.<br />
<br />
Colin shoved her to the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Master?&quot; she whimpered, her eyes flooding with tears. &quot;Don;t you want me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn right I do - but my way!&quot; He got up. &quot;Josh is going to take your cherry - go to his room and when he gets home, go into the act like I told you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Master!&quot; Sam cried eagerly, dashing out of the basement to wait for her 10-year-old brother.<br />
<br />
Colin had a thought and went to his computer. A few commands, and he made Sam very fertile, but only for Josh. She could be raped by a platoon of Marines safely, but her first fuck from Josh would make a baby in her almost immediately. After being an insensetive asshole for so long, a bit of maternal instinct would do Sam good.<br />
<br />
Now Colin came to the hot part of his plan - to lose his own cherry by fucking a real live girl! Not just any girl, either - but the sexiest one he knew - his own mother!<br />
<br />
The question was - how? The possibilities were endless? Mom as she was now, as she was in her twenties, when she was a foxy teenager? Have her come to him, a loving seduction, jump her and do her? Should she remember, or forget? Should she get pregnant or not? Have her with her own mind, or a slave like Sam? So many choices!<br />
