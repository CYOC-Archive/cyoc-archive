<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sam looked around the sea of partygoers, a huge grin on his face. He’d been to parties before, but none of them were as wild as this one was. Quite frankly, he was impressed that the party hadn’t been shut down yet. But that didn’t matter right now. He had taken a hit of ‘nip and felt more relaxed than he had in a long time. <br />
<br />
He found himself wandering over to an empty couch at the end of the room opposite the sound system and sat down. He began to stare off into space, letting his mind wander as the full effects of the catnip began to kick in. At one point, he held his hand up and began to flex his claws, watching in fascination as they went in and out. Sam knew he had retractable claws ever since his hands and arms changed, but now he found himself fully taking it all in. <br />
<br />
Sam noticed the couch shift slightly as someone else sat down next to him. He didn’t pay them any attention though, as he was too entranced but his claws. It wasn’t until he felt someone grab his crotch and give it a squeeze that he lowered his hand and looked over to whoever sat down next to him, about ready to smack them until he realized who it was. <br />
<br />
Todd was laying on his stomach, a dopey grin plastered on his face as his paws dangled off the arm of the couch. As he lightly groped Sam’s growing bulge, the wolf noticed Sam looking at him and moved himself so his chin could rest on Sam’s thigh. <br />
<br />
“Hi Sammy…” Todd said, a slight slur in his voice. The wolf was clearly a little tipsy (much to Sam’s surprise). <br />
<br />
“Hey Todd…” Sam responded, an amused look on his face. “What’re you doing buddy?” Todd laughed a little before squeezing Sam’s bulge again. <br />
<br />
“I wanna tell ya that I loooooooove you…” The wolf brought his muzzle closer to Sam’s bulge, sniffing it slightly. “You smell nice…” Sam couldn’t help but laugh a little and began to pet his intoxicated boyfriend’s head. <br />
<br />
“How much did you have to drink, bud?”<br />
<br />
“Only that much.” The wolf pointed to a cup on the nearby end table before laughing a little. “It was fucking groooooooooss.”<br />
<br />
“Okay, I think you need to lay off the booze if you’ve only had one drink and you’re this tipsy. And you should really stop groping me. We’re in public.”<br />
<br />
Todd’s ears flattened and he let out a whimper. “But Sammy…” The slight hint of desperation in his boyfriend’s voice made Sam feel a bit guilty, but he did come to a realization: they were in a house, and houses had bedrooms. And after all, it wasn’t truly a college party until a couple was fucking in the bedroom, right? <br />
<br />
“I’ve got an idea. Work with me, okay?” Lifting his boyfriend’s head, Sam stood up and quickly picked Todd up, holding him bridal style. The wolf seemed to enjoy this judging by his tail wagging rapidly and him beginning to lick the tiger’s muzzle. As they walked towards the stairs, Sam saw Milo and Dare dancing together, and he couldn’t help but grin. He made eye contact with Milo and gave the boar a wink before carrying the wolf upstairs. <br />
<br />
Sam found the guest bedroom with little to no effort, as it was the first open door on the right at the top of the stairs. He peeked inside to make sure the room wasn’t occupied before carrying Todd into the room. He closed the door with his paw and quickly used one of his hands to lock it so no one would barge in on them. As soon as they were alone, Sam put Todd on the bed before jumping onto the bed with him.<br />
<br />
“Now we’re alone, so we can have some fun,” the tiger said in a sultry tone, making the wolf shudder in excitement before slowly stripping down to his boxers. Sam quickly did the same thing before pinning Todd down and passionately kissing him, pushing his tongue deep into the wolf’s muzzle. As their tongues intertwined in each other’s mouths, Sam began to thrust his crotch against Todd’s, making the wolf moan into their kiss. When they broke their kiss, Sam moved his head and began gently nibbling at Todd’s left ear, taking great care not to hurt him. <br />
<br />
“It’s cute seeing you all worked up like this,” Sam said in a soft, seductive tone. “Though as much as I’d like to keep grinding against you, I think I have a better idea.”<br />
<br />
“And what’s that?” Todd asked, a slight slur still in his speech. The tiger simply gave him a wink and laid down on his back before pulling his boxers down and letting his erect feline cock flop out. Todd quickly took off his own boxers and tossed them into his pile of clothes. He brought his muzzle close to Sam’s cock and took a deep whiff of the tiger’s scent before running his tongue from Sam’s balls all the way up the length. Sam let out a moan of satisfaction as his cock was eagerly taken into Todd’s eager maw. He tightly gripped the sheets beneath him as the wolf began to bob his head up and down the feline’s length. Sam reached down and placed a hand on his boyfriend’s head, encouraging him to take more. <br />
<br />
Feeling Sam’s hand on his head made Todd try to take more of the rather large cock in his mouth, with the tip getting ever closer to the back of his throat. He could feel his gag reflex starting to kick in, but the wolf was determined to fight it off. Seeing how Todd was beginning to struggle a bit, Sam removed his hand from Todd’s head. <br />
<br />
“Babe…you don’t have to take so much,” he said scratching behind the wolf’s ears. Todd reluctantly backed off, taking his boyfriend’s cock out of his mouth. The wolf was absolutely determined to deepthroat that cock one of these days, but today wasn’t going to be the day. <br />
<br />
“So what now?” Todd asked. “Do you wanna fuck me? ‘Cause I’d loooooooove for you to fuck me.” Sam couldn’t help but laugh at how different Todd was when he was tipsy. He seemed to lack any of the inhibitions that were usually present, though that was kind of a given when alcohol was involved. <br />
<br />
“Actually, I was thinking we could try…mixing it up a little?” Sam suggested. <br />
<br />
The wolf tilted his head in confusion. “So, me…fuck you?” Todd asked, laughing a bit. “You’re a silly kitty, but imma do it for you.” Before Sam could even respond, Todd had moved back down to his crotch. He thought that the wolf was going to start giving him another blowjob, but he was caught off guard by feeling his boyfriend’s tongue rimming his hole, preparing it for what was to come. <br />
<br />
After a few minutes of rimming, Todd carefully lined the tip of his member with Sam’s eager hole. He grabbed the tiger’s hips and slowly began to push his length in. Sam inhaled sharply and held his breath, wincing slightly as his hole was stretched for the first time. Despite being tipsy, Todd could clearly tell his boyfriend was in pain. He reached down and gently cupped the tiger’s cheek in his hand. <br />
<br />
“It’s okay babe…just breathe…” Sam nodded in understanding, taking deep breaths as Todd pushed his cock in deeper. When Todd finally got to the knot, he gently patted Sam’s head before beginning to pull his cock out. Sam knew exactly where this was going as he braced himself for what would happen next. As Todd was about to pull the tip of his cock out, he thrust back in, earning a rather loud moan from Sam. <br />
<br />
“You like that babe?” Todd asked, building up a rhythm with his thrusts. Sam simply moaned in response and nodded his head. <br />
<br />
“Yeah babe…you can go a bit harder…I can take it…”<br />
<br />
Todd nodded and began to pick up the pace, earning moans of satisfaction from Sam. His thrusts began to get harder and faster, with each moan from Sam bringing the wolf closer and closer to release. The tiger wrapped his legs around Todd’s waist, trying to keep the wolf’s cock as deep inside of his hole as he possibly could. Sam now understood why Todd wanted to be fucked so bad. He wasn’t sure how things could feel any better, but he quickly learned how when the wolf grabbed Sam’s throbbing cock and began to jack it off. <br />
<br />
Sam threw his head back and cried out in pleasure as his orgasm began approaching faster as Todd’s thrusts got more aggressive. “Fuck me harder, you big bad wolf!” Todd complied, letting instincts take over as he wildly thrust into Sam’s hole, letting out a few barks of pleasure every now and then. He could feel his orgasm on the brink of arrival. There was just one last thing he had to do.<br />
<br />
With one more aggressive thrust, Todd shoved his knot inside of Sam’s hole, causing the tiger to let out a yowl of pleasure before crying out as his insides were flooded with hot, canine seed. Unable to resist, his own orgasm came not long after. Todd leaned forward with his mouth agape to try and catch as much of the tiger’s cum in his mouth as he could, and while he was mostly successful, a fair amount ended up painting his muzzle.<br />
<br />
Todd collapsed on top of Sam’s chest, panting heavily as he gave Sam’s muzzle a few short licks. The tiger breathed in unison with his wolf, enjoying the privacy they had. <br />
<br />
“Did…did I do good at topping?” Todd asked in his drunken stupor. His boyfriend simply laughed and scratched the wolf behind his ears, making Todd’s tail wag rapidly. <br />
<br />
“You were amazing, you big bad wolf.”<br />
<br />
Todd tried to pull out of Sam, only to realize they were stuck together. “Oh right…I forgot about…about the thingie…You know the thingie that makes me stuck to you?”<br />
<br />
“You mean your knot?” Sam replied, stifling a laugh. <br />
<br />
“Yeah…yeah that thing…you’s stuck to me now.” The wolf hiccuped before licking his lover’s muzzle. “I like being stuck to you Sammy.”<br />
<br />
Sam chuckled and scratched behind Todd’s ears again. “I love being stuck to you too babe.”</p>
