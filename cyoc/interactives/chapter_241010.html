<br />
Gazing out the window of the cabin, Lilith sighed in contentment. A snowstorm the previous night had left a foot of fresh snow, canceling school for both Alyssa and Rebecca. This now gave Eliana and Lilith a quiet morning drinking coffee before enjoying the winter weather.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, what&#39;s for lunch?&quot; Alyssa asked.<br />
<br />
Lilith turned towards her daughter. Alyssa was obviously enjoying her snow day, the teen still adorned in pajama pants and a t-shirt from when she went to bed. <br />
<br />
&quot;I was thinking chicken noodle soup,&quot; Lilith replied. &quot;Or would you rather have grilled cheese?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Grilled cheese works.&quot; Alyssa shrugged.<br />
<br />
Nodding, Lilith stood and stretched, she needed a shower. Eliana was currently taking one after the pair shoveled the walkway. Once that was done maybe they could take the girls outside for some fun. The sound of someone knocking now drew Lilith&#39;s attention. <br />
<br />
&quot;Who would possibly come visit in weather like this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll get it,&quot; Alyssa called, racing towards the front door. &quot;I&#39;m expecting a package.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Package, what package?&#39;<br />
<br />
Alyssa fidgeted slightly, turning towards Lilith. &quot;Umm well, I asked Eliana if I could buy something for Valentine&#39;s Day,&quot; she said. &quot;You know...for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lilith smiled, her heart melting at the idea that her daughter was buying her a Valentine&#39;s Day gift. This was after all their first Valentine&#39;s Day together. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; she smiled. &quot;And thanks, just be careful please.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon mom, it&#39;s just a delivery guy,&quot; Alyssa scoffed. &quot;How dangerous could it be?&quot;<br />
<br />
Opening the door, Alyssa gasped, her eyes going wide as she locked eyes with the massive creature taking up her doorway. The thing stood at least 8 feet tall, rippling with muscles. For a moment, Alyssa believed it was a minotaur but this was different. Minotaur didn&#39;t have a zebra pattern or a massive zebra head to match. The creature&#39;s black eyes locked with Alyssa&#39;s, it&#39;s lips parting to reveal a set of fangs.<br />
<br />
&quot;LILITH?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Alyssa and Lilith screamed as the creature burst through the door, leaving a gaping hole where the door once stood. Scooping Alyssa up in it&#39;s massive arms the creature now squeezed Alyssa in a massive hug. All the teen could do was offer a muffled scream into the creature&#39;s furry chest. Lilith gawked, ready to attack until she recognized the creature. A demon she hadn&#39;t seen in years.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bob?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lilith?&quot;<br />
<br />
The zebra demon Bob now paused, holding Alyssa at arms length as he looked between mother and daughter. &quot;Wait, there are two Lilith&#39;s?&quot; he asked in confusion. &quot;But there&#39;s only one Lilith. I know there&#39;s only one Lilith...unless? Is this a Lilith clone? Lilith, did you make a second Lilith? A Lilith Junior?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s my daughter Bob, can you put her down!?&quot;<br />
<br />
Bob nodded, the massive zebra demon gently lowering a petrified Alyssa. Sighing in annoyance Lilith studied the zebra demon carefully. Thankfully Bob was wearing shorts, Lilith remembering the demon&#39;s penchant for wearing far too small thongs provided by his anthro zebra girlfriend and Lilith&#39;s English teacher Ms. Warner.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom?&quot; Alyssa whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay Alyssa he&#39;s a friend,&quot; Lilith sighed. &quot;His name&#39;s Bob.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck is going?!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Lilith turned, watching as both Rebecca and Eliana bolted into the room. The sound of Bob&#39;s arrival had shaken the cabin, causing Eliana to end her shower early. The woman dripping wet with only a towel wrapped around her. Rebecca now stood at her side, the teen previously listening to music in her room. Now both gawked at the zebra demon standing in their front foyer, the door and wall obliterated by the demon&#39;s entrance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bob?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eliana?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bob,&quot; Eliana exclaimed. &quot;What the hell are you doing here? And what the hell happened to my door?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I came to see Lilith and saw two Lilith&#39;s,&quot; Bob explained. &quot;I am....still confused how there could be two Lilith&#39;s?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I got pregnant in college, remember?&quot; Lilith sighed. At this Bob&#39;s dark eyes seemed to widen, the zebra demon&#39;s memory jogged from this revelation. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; he gasped. &quot;Now I remember, but Lilith how did you come back from the dead? I was there when we scattered your ashes. I held baby Lilith because she was crying, she fell asleep in my arms.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a long story Bob,&quot; Lilith sighed before pausing. &quot;Wait...Bob...how did you get here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;LILITH!!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Lilith turned just in time as a petite woman with numerous tattoos and and white blonde hair tackled her. Falling in a heap as the woman knocked the wind out of her, it didn&#39;t take Lilith long to figure out who this was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jolie?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it&#39;s me. I know...I look a little older now, but hey, so do you. Don&#39;t take it the wrong way or anything, you still look great.&quot; Jolie complimented with a smirk as she then looked over towards Alyssa.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alyssa! Oh, look at you, you&#39;re the spitting image of your mother at your age.&quot; Jolie said as she grabbed Alyssa and gave her a great big hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh....thank you?&quot; Alyssa thanked not totally unsure who this woman was, but she knew her mom, so she must have been an old friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, who do we have here? Eliana, Rebecca, it&#39;s been years since I&#39;ve seen either of you two and my Eliana, the years have been kind to you.&quot; Jolie said looking over Eliana chuckling while winking at her humorously. Eliana blushed bright red out of embarrassment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway, Lilith, I&#39;m still curious how the hell are you alive again?&quot; Jolie now asked Lilith who sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well.....it&#39;s a little complicated but....&quot; Lilith began to explain before she noticed dark shadows engulfing over Jolie and Bob&#39;s necks and both of them struggling to breath.<br />
<br />
Lilith and Alyssa were shocked and looked over to see Misery slowly stepping into the room with her arms up around controlling her shadows around Jolie and Bob&#39;s necks.<br />
<br />
&quot;You two shouldn&#39;t have invaded my home, you do not want to make an enemy of me.&quot; Misery threatened.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, no!&quot; Lilith shouted out to Misery putting her hand on Misery&#39;s shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Grandma, please, stop! They&#39;re friends of my mom.&quot; Alyssa also shouted as Misery/Mary looked closer at the two of them and gasped letting go of the two of them and letting Jolie and Bob breath easily again.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m....I&#39;m sorry....I thought....oh god, I thought you were in danger.&quot; Mary said trying to hold back her tears as she dropped to her knees.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit, is that Misery?&quot; Jolie asked in surprise looking at the woman who Lilith and Alyssa were helping up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, it&#39;s her. But please, don&#39;t call my mother that. She doesn&#39;t like that name anymore.&quot; Lilith said as she and Alyssa helped Mary up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mother? Oh right, I almost forgot she was sort of like a mom to you.&quot; Jolie remembered now tapping her finger against her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m so sorry. I was just trying to protect you both.&quot; Mary said.<br />
<br />
&quot;We know, thank you grandma, but we promise we&#39;re fine.&quot; Alyssa said as she kissed Mary on the forehead. &quot;Why don&#39;t you go sit down? We&#39;ll be alright.&quot; Alyssa suggested Mary smiled at her granddaughter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, so back to our previous question: Lilith, how are you back from the dead?&quot; Jolie now asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like I said, it&#39;s a complicated story. But to put it simply: Alyssa was the one to save me and bring me back from the dead and ever since, we&#39;ve been making up for lost time.&quot; Lilith explained as best as she could to Jolie and make it easy for Bob to understand as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Brought your mom back from the dead? That&#39;s awesome. You ever thought about going into necromancy? I guarantee you it can be pretty fun.&quot; Jolie said to Alyssa with a little smirk nudging her on the elbow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jolie, I&#39;m not having my daughter go into the necromancy business. She&#39;s already a Solar Guardian just like me.&quot; Lilith said proudly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You sure about that? She could learn a thing or two from me. I am the coven mother of the Coven of Hortus now.&quot; Jolie explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, do you think I could....?&quot; Alyssa began to ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;The answer is no, absolutely not.&quot; Lilith quickly replied as Alyssa moaned.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought you&#39;d want her to join Lilith, it seems like something you would&#39;ve done at her age.&quot; Bob said joining in the conversation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bob, I&#39;m trying to have my daughter make good choices, not some of the choices I made at her age.&quot; Lilith explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Would she really have done that at my age?&quot; Alyssa now asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well....your mom wasn&#39;t exactly the perfect example of a model student at your age.&quot; Jolie admitted as she and Alyssa giggled a little at this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway, Bob, how are you doing now? Are you still dating Ms. Warner?&quot; Lilith asked Bob now wanting to change the subject.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you have missed a lot Lilith, I&#39;m actually married to Cynthia now and the two of us have three children now. Ah, I remember our wedding night,&quot; Lilith and Eliana&#39;s eyes shot wide open as they both covered Rebecca and Alyssa&#39;s ears as Bob started talking about his wedding night. &quot;Cynthia caressed my testicles before I mounted her. We then made love for several hours. After that, she was pregnant.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Jesus Bob, we have kids here! I mean, I didn&#39;t think demons could procreate!&quot; Lilith said startled.<br />
<br />
&quot;I like him mom, he&#39;s kind of funny.&quot; Alyssa said chuckling at Bob.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bob is nice, but he sometimes doesn&#39;t know when there are....CHILDREN IN THE ROOM.&quot; Eliana said loudly reminding Bob both girls are still in their early teen years.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, sorry, I forgot.&quot; Bob said with a little blush.<br />
<br />
Before anyone could say anything else, they heard a door slam as Alyssa realized it was probably her delivery now that she was initially expecting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mister Bob, Eliana, Miss Jolie, hide!&quot; Alyssa said to the three of them as they all quickly realized that it would look really weird for the situation.<br />
<br />
Alyssa went up to the door to get the package she had ordered thanks to Eliana.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi there, are you Alyssa Kane?&quot; The delivery guy asked looking at Alyssa and Alyssa slightly confused why he didn&#39;t ask about the zebra demon or the woman with all the tattoos on her arms.<br />
<br />
Alyssa turned to look to see that the house looked normal and Jolie, Bob, and Eliana were dressed nicely and all looked very normal. Jolie put a finger to her mouth and winked at Alyssa as the young girl understood what she meant. <br />
<br />
Alyssa confirmed who she was and took the package from the delivery driver as he went back to his vehicle and Jolie dropped the disguise spell she had used. Alyssa now went over to her mother and held out the box to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Happy Valentine&#39;s day mom.&quot; Alyssa said a little smile.<br />
<br />
Lilith opened the box to see two rings inside of it. One was a ring with a large heart on it, while the other ring was a little smaller with a smaller heart on it.<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re mother daughter rings. I thought you might like it.&quot; Alyssa said with a hopeful smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alyssa, I love it. Happy valentine&#39;s day.&quot; Lilith said as the two of them hugged each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s so sweet, well, it&#39;s been nice seeing everyone. But Bob and I really should be getting back home, so we&#39;ll....&quot; Jolie began to say before Eliana stepped in front of the two of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no, you two aren&#39;t going anywhere. You&#39;re both staying here and fixing my front door that I already had replaced before.&quot; Eliana said tapping her foot as the two of them rubbed their necks in slight embarrassment before getting ready to fix Eliana&#39;s front door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rebecca, watch them to make sure they do a good job. I&#39;m going to put on some dry clothes.&quot; Eliana said shaking her head as she headed to get dressed.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile Lilith finally went to go take her shower while Alyssa showed her grandmother the rings she had gotten for herself and her mother.</p>
