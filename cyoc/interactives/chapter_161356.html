<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Joe&#39;s afterlife after talking to Sim Julia about normal Julia became better. Joe would occasionally watch Julia on earth alone or with Sim Julia when their daughter was off doing something else in heaven. It for sure was interesting seeing Dustin basically take over most religious institutions in the world, and to see how many faiths either called Ty the devil, reincarnation of the true god, some really powerful alien and not divine, or something that would make sense in their faith. <br />
Joe and Stew had been help perfecting heaven as well as two random guys could, but with them having direct access to Ty most of the time they noticed how Ty was handling everything. It seemed like Ty could become omniscient but wasn&#39;t. The way he described it was he was putting his subconsciousness around several spots, usually in shrines or churches dedicated to Ty in some way or another. The years passed and generations were born and raised knowing that Ty was around and if they ever really needed anything all they needed to do was make Ty happy and ask for just what they needed. It didn&#39;t always work, but it worked enough that people who were truly in a pinch were saved. People still died and heaven wasn&#39;t quite open yet, so most everyone was stuck in a nothingness purgatory. Once heaven was open they&#39;d get in and it would seem like they died and went straight to heaven, but Ty was waiting for one thing in particular. <br />
One of Ty&#39;s subconsciousness was in a hospital room as a beautiful woman was lying in one of the beds slowly dying. Julia was now in her late 80&#39;s and while Ty was generous enough to keep people looking pretty he still allowed the years to take a toll on people&#39;s bodies. Julia did have a lot of friends, and adopted two kids however she had a feeling Joe was waiting for her in heaven. She kept her faith in Ty and knowing her heartbeat was getting weaker was at peace that soon she would be with her beloved in heaven. <br />
<br />
Joe and Sim Julia were watching and seeing Julia slowly die in her bed. Sim Julia was close trying to comfort Joe as he went through so many different emotions. Joe had spoken to Ty about Julia and Ty had told him that Julia for sure would be coming to heaven to spend the rest of eternity in paradise. So it made no sense that Joe should feel sad about kinda of a copy of his wife was dying but... I mean Julia was dying expecting that she would be with him forever and... Well Joe already had Sim Julia and a biological daughter, plus he wasn&#39;t sure he was fully in love with who Julia turned out to be. Sure he didn&#39;t hate her but Julia and Sim Julia had diverged. Then there was Sim Julia&#39;s feelings to consider. <br />
&quot;So, would you two please come with me?&quot; said the voice of a teenage kid. Joe and Sim Julia looked and it was Ty. The god kid never aged and seemed to enjoy the form he had when he vanished himself from existence. Ty didn&#39;t need to say any more as the couple knew what Ty had meant and allowed themselves to be transported by their god. They were now at the beach resort that Joe had entered heaven and looking out at the waves. A voluptuous woman with long straight red hair wearing a white bikini was waiting on a towel as she stared out at the sea. Joe and Julia looked to Ty as he said &quot;We&#39;re here Victoria.&quot; <br />
The woman turned to look and said &quot;Hi mom, dad, and Ty. Umm... You may want to meet that mom alone but... I kind of want to meet her and... kinda wondered what she would think of me. Plus it&#39;s just one more person out of the... 5 of us here in heaven to meet and interact with.&quot; The child of heaven for sure didn&#39;t have a lot of play mates and during her rebellious phase and not seeing anyone for years she had made a habit of just watching the world while lazing around. Wishing she had someone who wasn&#39;t an adult to interact with. Now she just wished she had some more real people to interact with and... Well Julia was a real person. <br />
Joe said &quot;That&#39;s fine, she&#39;d probably learn about you sooner or later and... I think it&#39;s better she learn sooner.&quot; <br />
Julia smiled and said &quot;I think that&#39;ll be for the best my darlings.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Her heart has stopped, she will be here soon.&quot; the teen god said. Everyone stopped talking and just watched the waters as a form shimmered into existence. Julia&#39;s form solidified, all the years of wear and tear to her body gone. She wasn&#39;t in her hospital gown but a classy one piece swimsuit. &quot;Welcome to Heaven Julia. It&#39;s not exactly open yet but I felt that Joe here would want to see you as soon as possible.&quot; <br />
Julia blinded a bit and guessing the scrawny kid may have been Ty or some angel ran straight to Joe in tears of joy and said &quot;JOE! It&#39;s been so long! I was right you were here. We can get to be together forever an-&quot; Julia looked up to see Joe&#39;s face and while some blemishes were gone, a little bit of dental correction and imperfections were buffed out... It hadn&#39;t really changed since the day he disappeared. Then she noticed someone in the corner of her vision and saw.... herself... kind of. She focused on the woman and it was her but the way she carried herself was a bit different, and she was... Julia wasn&#39;t exactly sure how to describe it, but it wasn&#39;t her. <br />
Joe said &quot;It has been a long time. I&#39;ve been watching over, but when I was first kinda poofed away from earth Ty put me and Stew in different simulations of earth. They were identical and the people were people and... Well that was the you from the rest of my life I lived. I&#39;d still like to be with you as well, it&#39;s just... even I&#39;m not sure how I feel about this.&quot; as Julia looked in Sim Julia&#39;s eyes Julia felt a little bit of relief as when Julia looked in her duplicate&#39;s eyes she saw a conspiratorial ally. Sim Julia seemed to not mind real Julia the least bit and if anything wanted to have some fun together with her. Julia needed time to think about whether or not she wanted that, but-<br />
&quot;Um... Excuse me!&quot; Victoria said<br />
Julia saw the unfamiliar grown woman although there was something about her that was familiar and said &quot;Um... yes miss?&quot; <br />
Victoria took a deep breath and said &quot;I know you have a lot to take in with just... Joe and Julia and you but... There&#39;s one thing I have to tell you or I feel like I&#39;m going to run from you in heaven forever!&quot; <br />
Julia looked to Joe and Sim Julia and then back to the woman and asked &quot;Umm... What is it?&quot; <br />
&quot;I&#39;m your daughter!&quot; <br />
Julia thought for a second and blurted out &quot;What Elise!?! When did you die before me!?! Did you get into a car accident with David? I knew he was a-&quot; <br />
Victoria said &quot;No... Although I hope I can be friends with Elise once she gets here but,&quot; She pointed to Joe and Sim Julia and said &quot;I&#39;m their child... which kind of makes me your child as well... sort of... am I making sense?&quot; <br />
Julia looked at the woman and saw some of her own features in the woman and said &quot;I think so,&quot; she chuckled looking at Victoria who was turning bright red &quot;Mind introducing yourself?&quot;<br />
Victoria said &quot;My name&#39;s Victoria.&quot; Ty looked at this weird family seeing what was going well and what wasn&#39;t. This family would need to settle before he introduced the Joe and Julia from Stew&#39;s simulation. He figured that would throw them for a loop, but unless they wanted to interact the Stew simulation Joe and Julia could just live in heaven happy without having to think about those other Joe and Julias. Still thought he should intervene a bit. <br />
Ty snapped his fingers and a small enclosed booth appeared as he said &quot;Alright, I think the initial introductions have occurred but front loading everyone at her at once may be too much if we continue this much further. So I have a proposition.&quot; Everyone stopped talking and looked at their god who continued &quot;I have set up a nice room inside, feel free to materialize snacks, games, whatever you need but on the stipulation that Julia from earth here only go in with one other person at a time.&quot; <br />
Victoria said &quot;But I just met her! I want t-&quot; <br />
Ty glared a bit at Victoria which silenced the woman and said &quot;Don&#39;t worry you&#39;ll only be waiting a few seconds. I&#39;ll speed up time inside the booth super crazily so Julia will get one on one time with everyone and no one will really have to wait.&quot; <br />
Julia sighed and said &quot;Yes... this is a bit too much all at once, but... maybe some one on one time would be nice.&quot; <br />
Ty said &quot;Great, now I suppose since you just got here. How about you choose who you talk with first?&quot; <br />
Julia a little mentally exhausted looked at everyone currently there and thought it would be best to start with...</p>
