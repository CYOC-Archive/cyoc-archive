<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
Damon thought for a moment, could he say goodbye to Monica, could he stand seeing her cry as he told her that they could no be together after promising to be together since 4th grade and dating officially since 9th grade. He didn’t know if his heart could take it but he knew he couldn’t just leave her without saying goodbye.<br />
“Monica.” whispered Damon as Vicki nodded her head and sent out the text, followed moments later by another text message. “Who did you send your text to, please tell me it wasn’t dad.”<br />
“God are you crazy?” inquired Vicki “I texted Jill.”<br />
Damon nodded his head as he looked toward his mother, wondering how to say this. Vicki had hidden her sexual orientation for years only her close friends knew. No one else because it would set off their father and be unwelcomed in their conservative city.<br />
“Ah…Jill is Vicki’s girlfriend.” Explained Damon<br />
“That is fine by me, it may not be normal by land walkers but same sex relationships is common among mermaids and merman.” Said Princess Corine as Vicki’s phone vibrated. <br />
“They are on their way, about 10 minutes.” said Vicki<br />
“Well we could turn you while we wait.” Offered Princess Corine<br />
“No, I want to change with Jill.” Said Vicki <br />
“You are sure she will change?” inquired Damon as Vicki smiled. <br />
“I have known Jill since we where in preschool, she will has always loved mermaids since we where kids.” Explained Vicki as she took a breath and looked at Princess Corine “Question do all mermaids go without a top?”<br />
“Some do, somewhere land walker tops a lot of the younger generation does but it is traditional for those of royal blood to go topless.” Explained Princess Corine as she looked at her daughter. “Scarlett can where a top if she wants.” <br />
Damon looked down and really noticed that he was a she and now had large breasts, while not as large as Vicki’s breasts she was a good C cup. Reacting on instinct Damon slammed his hands over his breasts covering them only to face plant into the water and the sand. This caused his mother and his sister to laugh. <br />
“Hold on, I think I left on swim bag in your car.” Said Vicki as she walked back to Damon’s car and after a few minutes pulled out a gym back. <br />
“We are actually in luck.” Stated Vicki as she sat down in the beach pulling out a red bikini top from one of the many swimsuits his sister had.<br />
“This is weird and wrong.” Stated Damon as he slipped on his sister’s own bikini top.<br />
“It’s clean, I could have thrown you a used one but that was too far.” Explained Vicki with a grin as she watched her brother struggle with the top, finally it was done. <br />
“How do I look?” inquired Damon as he looked at his sister, the red X shape top really worked well with the red and gold tail and her red hair. The top was slightly too small for Damon or Scarlett but it was better then nothing. <br />
“Very good.” Confirmed Vicki as they began to wait, while they waited Vicki changed into the second suit in her bag, Damon looked away as his sister changed into her yellow and white swimsuit and took the time to pull her long blonde hair up into a pony tail. She had just finished when the sound of a bike coming down a small path could be heard as they turned and looked. <br />
“Hide.” Ordered Vicki as Damon and his mother ducked their head under the water, to Damon’s amazement he could see Vicki standing on the shore in her suit with almost no distortion.<br />
“Jill.” Said Vicki with a smile as she embraced her girlfriend, giving her a passionate kiss.<br />
“So a midnight swim?” inquired Jill with a smile as she looked out over the water. “I like it.”<br />
“In a way, we need to wait for a little bit.” Explained Vicki as Jill looked confused and then spotted Damon’s car.<br />
“Ah… so where is your brother?” inquired Jill<br />
“You will see.” Said Vicki with a knowing smile as another car arrived, a beat up junker and out stepped Damon’s girlfriend Monica. She looked tired, likely coming from her second job at the gas station. <br />
“Vicki? Jill?” inquired Monica, tired but warmly as she looked around. “Are we doing a swim? I could use one.”<br />
“In a way.” Stated Vicki <br />
“Where is Damon?” inquired Monica <br />
“Well, lets me show you something.” Said Vicki “Lets hope she can see us and hear us, Princess Carine?”<br />
Damon stayed under the water as his mother surfaced and for a moment nothing happened.<br />
“Oh my God a mermaid?” inquired Jill in total amazement.<br />
“That can’t be a real?” inquired Monica <br />
“It is.” Confirmed Carine “I am Princess Carine, third daughter of the late King of the Atlantic and widow to the Duke of the Caribbean Sea. You must be wondering why I am talking to you land walkers.”<br />
“Yes.” Confirmed Monica<br />
“Well, long ago I had child with a land walker and my father took her away from me and changed her. I reclaimed her tonight.” Explained Carine as she looked down at Damon. “Scarlett.”<br />
With a sigh, Damon slowly surfaced and looked at his sister’s girlfriend and his own girlfriend.<br />
“Hello, Jill, Hello Monica.” Stated Damon<br />
“That is Damon.” Explained Vicki as Monica and Jill’s eyes widened.<br />
“You’re a mermaid?” inquired Monica<br />
“Thanks to her and I can’t turn back.” Explained Damon with sadness in his voice. “I am sorry she snuck up on me and changed me without me knowing until it was too late.”<br />
“So you are leaving?” inquired Monica with pain in her voice.<br />
“No, we are leaving.” corrected Vicki as she turned and looked at Monica, the love of her brother’s life and Jill the love of her own life. “She can transform people into mermaids, I am going to become one and escape this death trap of a life here.”<br />
“And merman should you choose.” explained Carine <br />
“Monica, Jill would you like to come with us?” inquired Vicki as everyone waited to hear what Monica and Jill would say.</p>
