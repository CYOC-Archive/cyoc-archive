<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ethan woke up surprisingly refreshed. It&#39;d been a long time since he&#39;d slept this well. And even longer since he looked forward to the day. The other guys would already have started changing and he was curious to see how it was going. Even if it was only one day, he knew something had to be up. At least something small. He quickly went to take his morning shower.<br />
<br />
However, his eyes couldn&#39;t help but stop on his own body. &quot;Damn,&quot; he purred as he ran his fingers over himself again. &quot;Look what Margie&#39;s missing out on.&quot; Ethan made himself stand tall and puff out his chest. There were two pecs that looked like they were slowly in development and his arms were a tad bit thicker. He flexed one, watching the muscle bulge under the strain. More surprising was the fur that was running up his arms and down his chest. Just a sprinkle of hair that seemed to have grown overnight and given him a more adult look. &quot;Puberty is finally doing me some good,&quot; he smiled as he ran his fingers through the hair. <br />
<br />
It really made his body pop. Instead of the flat and bare chest he was looking at, the hair seemed to be centered on his chest giving his pecs more reason to be noticed. The developing muscles didn&#39;t have a ton but that didn&#39;t stop Ethan from flexing what he had. He grinned wildly as he as they moved. &quot;Yeah fuck that bitch,&quot; Ethan bragged. &quot;I could have anyone I want...&quot; However, his thoughts still returned to Ash&#39;s sister. The crush had been going for a pretty long time and hard to give up. <br />
<br />
He made sure to finish his shower quickly and change for school. Energy seemed to be wound up inside him and he couldn&#39;t let it all out. He practically sprinted from his car to the cafeteria to meet up with Ash. &quot;Yo!&quot; Ethan practically slid to a stop as he pulled out a chair, turned it around and sat down like a cool guy. &quot;I miss anything?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really sure...&quot; Ash said. &quot;I&#39;ve only seen Marcus. It looks like he&#39;s sporting a new beard. But other than that I&#39;m not really sure what all&#39;s supposed to change.&quot; He gave Ethan a look. Almost like he was looking something on him.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing,&quot; Ash said. &quot;You feeling alright?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah man! Better than ever!&quot; Ethan held up his arm and flexed it. &quot;Seeing your sister always gives me energy to get through the day.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t say things like that,&quot; Ash scolded.<br />
<br />
Ethan doubled down. &quot;That I think your sister&#39;s hot? C&#39;mon man. It&#39;s the truth.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Doesn&#39;t mean I want to hear it,&quot; Ash ignored the comment. &quot;Let&#39;s just go to class.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two headed towards their first period class making sure to sit in the back. But Ethan was surprised when he noticed Mrs. Wilkins walk in the room. Suddenly he felt a chill run down his spine as the smell of the room seemed to change. He sniffed air and could smell her sweet perfume. But there was something else there too. Something he couldn&#39;t quite place as the young teacher made her way to her desk and sit down. Not to mention her jeans seemed exceptionally tight around her hips. Her ample body somehow still stayed tight and firm in all the right places.<br />
<br />
Ethan let out a loud, &#39;Hungh!&#39; and gripped onto his desk. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dude!&quot; Ash whispered. &quot;What the fuck?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know...&quot; Ethan gasped. His grip only tightened as another smell entered the room. Gabe Brandson. He gripped his desk harder as his dick seemed to throb. &#39;What the hell?&#39; he wondered. The realization hadn&#39;t quite hit him. Consciously he knew he could smell the deep jocky musk of the other man. But subconsciously something else was working for him. An almost animalistic urge overcame him as he watched the large bumbling mass make his way across the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you okay?&quot; Ash leaned in.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know...&quot; Ethan felt his finger gripping the desk even tighter. His dick throbbed with excitement. &quot;Mrs. Wilkins? May I go to the bathroom?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Already?&quot; she was a bit surprised. &quot;Just make it quick.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes ma&#39;am!&quot; Ethan sprang from his seat and rushed out of the room. The smell of Ethan and Mrs. Wilkins hit his nose stronger as he passed by. He lurched out of the room and rushed towards the bathroom outside the offices. His hands shook as he locked the door. &quot;What the hell!?&quot; he dropped his pants and watched his dick leap for joy at the freedom. He quickly grabbed it, trying to tame the beast, but was only met with more arousal. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck man!&quot; he moaned as he started to stroke his dick. It was harder than it&#39;d ever been before. His breathing quickens. Then becomes more erratic. He&#39;s not thinking about anything. Anything other than sex. His body craves it. It needs it. &quot;Oh fuck. Fuck. Fuck,&quot; he pants with each stroke. All the while not noticing the hair on his body is growing just a tad bit more thicker. And his teeth just a bit sharper. Finally he let&#39;s out a loud guttural moan as he releases onto the walls of the bathroom. &quot;Finally...&quot; he breathes. It&#39;s a long and quiet breath. He leans over trying to figure out what just happened. It was still a bit hard to think in the afterglow.<br />
<br />
And the knock on the stall didn&#39;t make it any easier. &quot;Hey! what do you think you&#39;re doing in there?&quot; Officer Shepard banged on the door. &quot;Don&#39;t make me get the key.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ethan looked around and quickly tried to clean up the mess he made. &quot;Sorry sir,&quot; he tried to sound innocent. &quot;I think I had something bad to eat last night. I&#39;ll be out in a minute.&quot;<br />
<br />
He could almost hear the resource officer cringe. &quot;Alright. But don&#39;t take too long...&quot; Officer Shepard ordered. <br />
<br />
With a couple of pieces of toilet paper, Ethan got the bathroom cleaned up. He made sure to flush a couple of times and then wash his hands. As he did so he couldn&#39;t help but notice the start of a beard growing on the bottom of his chin. Not to mention his jawline looking a bit more defined. &quot;19 and finally feeling the testosterone flowing,&quot; he rubbed it with his fingers. &quot;Yes!&quot; adding a bit of a celebration. However, his mood quickly changed as he stepped outside to see Officer Shepard staring him down. He quickly sunk his head and headed back to class.</p>
