<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ryan’s friend Vinnie seemed like one of your average dorky nerds. You know those types, always seeming to be almost boney skinny, slender looking face with freckles, big dumb teeth, and braces to top it off. He looked like the kind of kid I would have picked on when I was back in school but something about him clicked with me. He was actually a pleasure to be around, I actually think I connected with him on some level just during our short hang out tonight. <br />
<br />
Of course always with my brain rushing to judgements that always trip me up, did I really blurt out to him “You can even take me home tonight and use me as a cum rag.”?<br />
<br />
As I was rushing to pack my bags I noticed my face getting really hot, yeah I was cringy at how I let my guard down and acted around Vinnie. I mean, I have a lot of hot girls and guys who are always hitting on me, and yet here I am acting the fool around some younger average dork. Not just that, but someone who most would consider below my level. I am leagues above this nerd, so why did I blurt out dumb stuff so readily around him. I mean we just met, yeah why do I rush head first into things without thinking of consequences. <br />
<br />
As I gathered my clothing into a duffle bag I went into the bathroom where Vinnie was in the middle of his shower. I put the cover down of the toilet next to the show and sat down with my naked butt hitting the coldness of the toilet. I figured I would regret that but I started to transform into a flurry white towel. <br />
<br />
I looked at my right hand as my fingers merged together and took on a bright white hue. The sensations in my fingers were a feeling of numbness as my flesh and muscles were replaced with cotton threading. <br />
<br />
It’s a form I have taken many times before, mostly when I just wanted to relax, clear my mind, and just take a temporary break from human life. But I think this is the first time I offered to willingly be used as a bath towel for somebody. Was this a dumb decision? It feels like a step down. I mean I am a powerful shapeshifter, I could take on powerful forms and overpower any other human, so why am I talking on such a… servile form. Not just a towel for anyone, not some hot chick but for some wimpy looking nerd. <br />
<br />
My brain is obviously not in the right place tonight but I already was almost done with my transformation by now. I was so caught up wondering what I was doing that I didn’t notice the center of mass of my body change and I tumbled forward onto the floor below. Luckily I was mostly towel now or else that would have hurt. <br />
<br />
I finished my transformation on the floor, as always with the last part of any inanimate transformation my entire towel form gave a shutter then fell limp and lifeless in a crumple heap on the bathroom floor. There I was, a lifeless ordinary bath towel on the floor near the toilet waiting to be used by some nerdy kid. What have I gotten myself into.<br />
<br />
Vinnie seemed to be taking a long steamy shower. The waiting felt so long. By now my former human body heat had long since left my fabric form. I felt so cold, unable to produce any body heat, unable to shiver. Even the steam from the shower floated upwards giving me moist chills without the heat. I wanted to turn back, but after transforming into something as alien from a human body as a towel it drains a lot of energy leaving me unable to revert back for a few hours. Now the only way to get warm is from another source, I was now longing for Vinnie to finish up and use me. <br />
<br />
The cold tile floor was unbearable, but just as I was going to drift off to an unconscious state I heard the shower turned off and the rustling of the curtains. I felt pressure on the lower part of my body, it felt wet yet warm. Vinnie’s foot just stepped on me. <br />
<br />
“Oh, Dylan is that you?” Vinnie said looking down. “Did I change you mentally while I was in the shower?”<br />
<br />
I guess he still thought he had these abilities.<br />
<br />
He carefully removed his foot to pick me up. Gently holding me in his hands he held me up to his face. There I could get a better look at him. His big teeth stuck out awkwardly with his braces. He had a bit of a long long and slender face, slightly long and curly bangs, and light freckles dotted his cheeks. But it was his brillants eyes close up that mesmerized me. Yes, to most other people he looked like an average guy most people wouldn’t give a second look but for some reason I found him oddly cute. <br />
<br />
“Wow, this towel is so fluffy,” Vinnie said, slightly feeling me all about.<br />
<br />
“Um, thanks,” I said mentally to him.<br />
<br />
“Oh wow I can hear you,” Vinnie said with a shock. “I am guessing as long as I am touching you I can hear you in my mind?”<br />
<br />
“Yes,” I said trying to nod by instinct but realizing I couldn’t really move in this form. <br />
<br />
“So, I know we just did the whole massage thing, but are you sure you are okay with me using you? I mean I will have to use you to dry… you know.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, it’s okay with me,” I replied, “it’s a new experience for me as well, so just treat me as you would any other towel.”<br />
<br />
I really can’t believe I said that.<br />
<br />
“Well, we can chat a bit while I dry off to make it less awkward if you like,” Vinnie said with a smile as he started to use me to dry his upper body.” <br />
<br />
Vinnie continued talking as he stretched and pulled my body in twisted contortions around his arms, over his head, and under his armpits. I was trying hard to focus on what he was saying but it felt like my brain was also being twisted all about and it was difficult to pull my mind together to think coherent thoughts. <br />
<br />
“So, are you in college?” Vinnie asked as he flipped me around to dry his back. I tried to continue the conversation as not to leave him hanging.<br />
<br />
“Um, I was but dropped out after my first semester, wasn’t sure it was for me,” I said, each word took all my mental strength to focus on getting out right. <br />
<br />
“I see,” Vinnie continued, “you look just a few years older than Ryan, so thought you would be in college.” <br />
<br />
“Maybe I will go back, perhaps their football team needs a new towel boy,” I tried to joke back. <br />
<br />
Vinnie laughed then not sure if intentional since there was no indication where my face was in this form, he grabbed what equates to the back of my head and pressed my face hard right against his junk.<br />
<br />
He began rubbing my face up against his crotch area. I dried the underside of his balls, then he used his hand in a cup motion to rub me up against the length of his cock which was surprisingly big for someone of his slender size. I think Vinnie was still talking to me, trying to act like nothing was out of the normal but I couldn’t focus on what he was saying, having my entire face wrapped around his cock was the only thing flooding my mind. <br />
<br />
Vinnie took great care using me to dry this area, kept stroking himself with me, harder and harder with each pass until I realized I could taste something a little salty. Yes, little dribbles of precum started to ooze out of his tip and my moist face would just soak it up. I am not sure he realized that he was hard until he stopped. <br />
<br />
“Oh,” Vinnie said looking a bit embarrassed, “oops, didn’t know I was getting excited down there,” he said with a nervous chuckle. <br />
<br />
He then brought me down to his legs and used me to finish drying off in silence. That was probably one of my more awkward moments but I would be lying to myself if I didn’t admit that I was curious what it would have felt like if he did end up releasing his load while using me. I know I did joke with him previously about being a cum rag but now I honestly wanted to be just that. <br />
<br />
“So I guess I will get changed and I will go to him,” Vinnie said, holding me with one hand as most of my body dangled midair. <br />
<br />
“Yeah if you want,” I started to say, “but…” I knew I would regret embarrassing myself more but I was a towel now how more embarrassing of a state was that, “I was serious when I said you could take me home tonight.” <br />
<br />
Vinnie stood still staring at me like I was some strange alien artifact. <br />
<br />
“Yeah you did,” he said, “I don’t mind, you are fun to chat with and in this form I don’t think my parents would notice.”<br />
<br />
Vinnie carefully folded me up into a nice square, apparently he didn’t know where my face was because half of my face was folded against my body while the other part allowed one free eye to look up at him as he rested me on the bathroom counter top.<br />
<br />
“I will grab Ryan and your stuff then come back to grab you when I am changed and ready to go,” Vinnie smiled as he left the bathroom.<br />
<br />
I gave a sigh of relief, did he remember me joking about being used as a cum rag? I am not sure. That is the problem I have, even with my abilities I have a hard time reading people. Like were the feelings mutual, did he like me in the same manner I liked him. I wasn’t sure and started to worry that this night could either be amazing or one of the most awkward experiences of my life and after it was over would have to avoid Vinnie for the rest of my life to purge this cringe experience from my mind. <br />
<br />
Before I could continue worrying further I was snatched up by Vinnie in an instant and held under his arm as he carried my duffle bag in the other over his shoulder. <br />
<br />
“I have Ryan in the bag,” Vinnie said as he made his way out of the house. “I live a few blocks away so it will be a little bit of a walk back home, but it’s a nice cool night.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah it is,” I said trying to continue a conversation, “perhaps a night like this would be perfect for a romantic date.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah it would be,” Vinnie said.<br />
<br />
“So, have you dated before,” I probed not sure if I was coming off as too obvious.<br />
<br />
“Not really,” Vinnie said, “I haven’t really thought about dating, been too concerned with school and what not.”<br />
<br />
I laughed and we continued talking about whatever crossed our minds.<br />
<br />
We walked for a good half hour and during that time we talked about everything from sports to philosophy to different animes we liked. If it wasn’t for the fact I was just some towel being held under Vinnie’s arm I would say this was just a nice normal walk with someone I was growing to like more and more. <br />
<br />
“So, do you have any relationship advice,” Vinnie asked me.<br />
<br />
My metaphorical ears perked up. <br />
<br />
“Oh, what did you want to ask?”<br />
<br />
“Well,” he began, “there is this girl in class I like…”<br />
<br />
My heart sank, I didn’t even catch any words that came out next. Of course he’s straight, that’s just always my luck. Here I am a stupid guy who could have anyone but I turned myself into a towel to get with this dork only to humiliate myself with all this work that’s not going to pay off. <br />
<br />
“...and so I am not sure if I should ask her out for prom or if I should go with the first girl who asked me out,” Vinnie continued. “Ummm… Dylan, are you still here.” <br />
<br />
He shook me like I was a broken radio.<br />
<br />
“Oh, I am going to be honest I am not sure,” I said trying to not show any change in emotions. “I didn’t even go to my high school proms.”<br />
<br />
“Well I normally don’t go, but this is the last year to get that experience,” Vinnie said.<br />
<br />
“So is it just girls you are looking to invite as your prom date,” I asked, wanting to get a clear answer.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, just girls. Don’t get me wrong, I have some great gay and bi friends, but I think it’s only girls for me right now,” Vinnie said.<br />
<br />
If I could limp more lifeless I would. I didn’t think my emotions were that obvious but I think Vinnie picked up on it.<br />
<br />
“Oh, Dylan, sorry if I gave the wrong impression,” Vinnie said somewhat nervously, “I like you, and thought that massage was a nice way to explore myself, but I probably should have said no.”<br />
<br />
I didn’t say anything.<br />
<br />
“But I do really really like you, as a friend right now,” Vinnie said sort of pleading while holding me up to him, “you are an awfully cute towel and I did admit I got hot drying myself off with you knowing that you weren’t just some ordinary towel.” <br />
<br />
I was still silent, not sure if I wanted some pity right now, even more of an awkward situation that I am in this form right now.<br />
<br />
“Did you want me to take you back home,” Vinnie said as he stopped. “I was still sort of excited with the idea of using you as a cum rag.”<br />
<br />
“Wait you remember I said that,” I asked in shock.<br />
<br />
“Of course silly,” Vinnie chuckled, “that was why I held back when drying off with you, I wanted to save it for when I had you back in my bed. I was really liking that idea.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, well glad you took my little joke well,” I tried to play it off.<br />
<br />
“Listen,” Vinnie said more seriously, “maybe not a dating relationship, but if you want to be sort of friends with benefits, I use you as a towel, I turn into a jock cup for you, then that would make me more than happy.”<br />
<br />
I gave another pause and mentally smiled, “sure, let’s try that out.” <br />
<br />
Vinnie gave a chuckle and continued walking back home, “I am going to really get some use out of you my precious little cum rag.”</p>
