<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After a couple hours of this, Dan was doing pirouettes and walking on his front paws balancing the water bowl on his nose, or would if he could. Dan of course knew all these commands, and it was really his dog side that had to learn. However, Dan&#39;s brain was also now conditioned to obey and not fight any. It was actually having the effect of merging the two sides of him more. Occasionally he could sense this and would concentrate hard to remember his humanity.<br />
<br />
 Miss Thromborne also used her voice to make a point of good and bad by changing the pitch so good always seemed to be feminine and anything bad that happened came because of a deeper male voice. She was so good at this that Dan now felt obliged to obey any female who commanded him because that sound would always lead to good results, but a man&#39;s voice he would not trust.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Danny, you&#39;ve been such a good pupil so far, I think it&#39;s time for a special reward. Pass this little test, and you get an A+ and not have to worry about failing.&quot;<br />
<br />
 Dan panted and wagged his tail. He sat and waited patiently as he had been taught. Miss Thromborne wandered into another room. Shortly, she called &quot;Heel.&quot; and Dan trotted into the room. It was her bedroom, and there on the bed was Miss Thromborne. Dan instantly smelled something very good. It made him salivate and drool even more as he panted. It was food, some kind of very smelly, must-be-good-tasting food. He wanted to jump up and get it, but behaved as trained sitting on the floor at the end of the bed waiting for her command.<br />
<br />
 As he looked up at her through the dim light, he saw her bare feet and legs. Then he noticed that wasn&#39;t all that was bare. She was sitting up with her shirt gone, and he could see she was now wearing some sort of harness like the frame of a huge bra that let her breasts hang free and down. She no longer looked overstuffed as she did with the clothes she normally wore, but she was a full-bodied woman and very shapely. Her arms looked more muscular where the clothes had stretched that had Dan originally think she was fat. Not so. More of an Amazon. Well, a sixty-something Amazon, a bit wrinkled in the face and greying hair.<br />
<br />
 It was weird. He had never seen an outfit like she had on except in a porn magazine. &quot;Why is she dressed like that?&quot; Dan thought, but sat very still just staring as his stomach began to churn from the sight and being anxious about what would happen.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Up, boy.&quot; and Miss Thromborne waved him towards her.<br />
<br />
 Dan jumped up easily and stood there as she wiped something from a bowl on one of her breasts. Dan thought her doing this was disgusting. An old woman and his tecaher to boot was quite a turn off, and spreading a dark slime on herself, ... ugh. He started to feel nauseous and began to turn away when ZAP.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Snack time.&quot; She patted the smeared mound that was jiggling down between them and giving him the signal of what to do to not get zapped again.<br />
<br />
 Already having the smell of it driving his hunger, Dan gingerly moved forward not wanting anything to do with this but instincts and training forced him to proceed. He tentatively lapped at the paste clinging to her. Oh! It was very good, and Dan began to lap quicker forgetting his trepidations even when he noticed flashes of light. He didn&#39;t care. He moved his tongue down and soon felt a rough nub on the surface. It seemed to grow as he licked. He was about to grab what must be a giant morsel when Miss Thromborne patted his head and pushed him sideways indicating her command to move onto the other large flesh balloon covered in the tasty goo.<br />
<br />
 Dan felt the quiver and warmth on his sheath as he continued to run his tongue all over her delicious mound, both the taste and the stimulation under him joined the smell to overwhelm any control he could muster. More flashes went off as his tongue came across another solid nub. Miss Thromborne moaned tenderly, &quot;Good boy, Danny.&quot; Even though he was totally grossed out by what he was doing, he thought this meant it was a treat to be picked up, and Dan licked the protrudence harder making Miss Thromborne moan even more. When he couldn&#39;t pick it up, he nibbled, Miss Thromborne screeched, and ZAP ZAP ZAP. Dan feel back on his butt and sat quietly on the bed between her thunderous thighs of taught muscle waiting for her next command or punishment which he wasn&#39;t sure would not be both.<br />
<br />
 The jolt was just enough to free Dan&#39;s mind from the animal side. The repugnance to the act ate at his mind. He wondered if his sister knew what terrible things this woman was making him do. He was licking his senior citizen teacher&#39;s breasts, giving her pleasure. Dis-gus-ting! He knew Kat would approve or even cheer if she witnessed this and was glad she wasn&#39;t here to see and would never see or know. Even though he was mostly a dog, he pictured himself as a boy, a student, playing naked with his leather harnessed teacher. He began to feel dizzy and sick at this thought, but then she put one of her fingers with the goo under his lip and rubbed it on his teeth. He struggled to hold still even as she coaxed with soft, &quot;Good boy&quot; and &quot;Come on, Danny. You know you want it.&quot; But he couldn&#39;t resist and sucked it from her finger with his tongue and mouth following her hand as she moved it forward.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Noooooo.&quot; Dan thought. &quot;Got to stop. Hold back.&quot; but the warmth and vibration started again with the food. He pushed his nose between her thighs with tongue reaching out to ... He could not bare to think what he was doing. Miss Thromborne&#39;s hands were on his neck scratching in that sensitive spot to relax him. They ran down his back and under the harness pulling him forward as the harness fell away Dan closed his eyes and concentrated. &quot;I&#39;m human. I&#39;m human. I&#39;m not a dog.&quot; but his tongue plunged in. It pulled the delectable glop from her and ran all over her lips going deeper to get every last bit including the rich juice that began to flow.<br />
<br />
 &quot;KAT, I&quot;LL GET YOU FOR THIS! I SWEAR!&quot; Dan thought as his head was engulfed by Miss Thromborne&#39;s clutching thighs squeezing it tightly while Miss Thromborne&#39;s moans heightened to a scream. A scream that terrified him enough that he tore himself loose tumbling off the bed just in time to see this aging dominatrix shake her muscular curves so much it caused not just the bed but the whole room to move as if an earthquake.<br />
<br />
 Frightened and upset, Dan raced from the room and towards the back door, but it was shut. He was still holding a full erection as he dashed through the house terrified looking for an escape. He panicked both as dog side and human which made the terror even more. He could take no more torture. He could only think he was going crazy. This couldn&#39;t be happening, none of it. He wasn&#39;t sure what he was or what he is. Again he screamed for his mommy which is probably the only thing that saved him from turning completely right then and there.<br />
<br />
 Finally, he saw a window open and managed to reach up and jump through. Into the night&#39;s darkness he ran not caring where as long as he could get away from here and maybe from himself and what he had done</p>
