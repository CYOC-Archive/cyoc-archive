<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chaz was frantic. He was angry at how cruel Mara had been to him but at the same time strangely turned on by how dominating she was. For whatever reason the gene sequence had somehow altered her personality in the process and he had to fix it so her immediately went to work in the basement once more to create a new sequence of genes.<br />
<br />
Mara was out and about in her car knowing excatly where she wanted to go. There was a local gym that she caught Josh, Chaz&#39;s best friend, at often. She infact used to go there when she was still over weight which honestly felt like a dream to her. How could she ever have been so short and over weight? She&#39;d pity any girl looking like she used to, but now she was a 10, no, more likely a 12 at this point. There was no woman in town who could match her charm and prowess and she liked it. After grabbing some clothes at a local shop, which resulting in her becoming the wet dream of a few teenagers here and there, she pulled up to the gym ready to make her move. She was not dressed in full gym attire. Tight yoga pants which were being eaten alive by her enormous ass and a work out bra that hardly seemed to do much more than contain the monsters she had on her chest which were still leaking milk little by little. As she entered through the glass doors, everyone in the gym took notice. She was a giant, not a single person in the place was her height. She smirked and made her way over to the machine next to Josh. He was currently benching 120lbs so Mara pulled up next to him and proceeded to bench 200lbs out right, not sweat. Josh couldn&#39;t help but stare so she closed the distance. &quot;Im sorry but... do I know you?&quot; Josh couldn&#39;t help but smile his big wide smile at this goddess before him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh don&#39;t you remember little ole me Joshua? Its Mara!&quot; She spoke slyly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mara? Wait as in Chaz&#39;s girlfriend!? Wow what you... Wow you look totally different!&quot; Josh wasn&#39;t really sure if this Amazonian goddess was telling the truth to him or not but at the same time he could see Mara&#39;s face in this heavenly body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah I&#39;ve been working out, but honestly Josh it gets boring doing so by your lonesome, I was hoping maybe you could spot me?&quot; She bit her lip and fluttered her eyelashes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uuuuhhh, yeah sure I suppose so...&quot; Was this the experiment that Chaz was talking about because if so? It must be an incredible success Josh thought. As he walked over to the bench he was suddenly pulled in by Mara who drew him close her her thick lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;Josh, I want you to fuck me. Right. Now.&quot; Her voice was commanding as if he really didn&#39;t have a choice in the matter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mara Im not really...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh come on, don&#39;t be a chicken I know you&#39;ve got a big cock, Chaz told.&quot; She was aching for it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mara I&#39;m gay!&quot; Josh tried to push her away, but at these words she let go. &quot;And what are you-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve got to be fucking joking, UGGGHHH, fine. You!&quot; She pointed at a random mountain of a man. The bold hunk of meat just pointed at himself slightly confused. &quot;Yeah you, I want you to fuck my brains out, so get outside and wait for me.&quot; The man looked her up and down, shrugged, and headed out the front door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mara and what about Chaz!?&quot; Josh said beyond flabergasted.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about him!? His dick is useless, he can&#39;t please me so I don&#39;t need him, I mean just fucking look at me. You think he&#39;s anywhere near my level? As if. I don&#39;t know what I was thinking with that child.&quot; She seemed to be stretching taller before Joshes very eyes. &quot;Now shut up and fuck off.&quot; She stormed out of the gym having to duck slightly to get out the door without bumping her head.<br />
<br />
Josh stood frozen, he couldn&#39;t believe this harlet. After all the love he knew Chaz gave her, he was heart broken to think this could happen. And how she turned out? That&#39;s it, he had to see Chaz. If things had only been different, he wouldn&#39;t have done something like this to Chaz if he were his lover. Josh threw his towl to the floor and ran outside as fast as he could. With his toned legs, it was a simple feat, not a breath strained through the whole parking lot.<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Just as Chaz was finalizing the alterations to Mara&#39;s genetic sequence he heard a banging on the door upstairs. He rushed up hoping that Mara had come back to make this easier on him but instead it was Josh. &quot;Josh!? Uh sorry but Im really busy-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Busy trying to fix Mara&#39;s genome?&quot; He wasn&#39;t going to let Chaz slide this time, he had to help in any way he could.<br />
<br />
&quot;How did you-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I ran into her at the gym, she tried to get me to have... sex with her. Im sorry that you have to hear it from me.&quot; Josh was nervous, the last thing he wanted to do was break Chaz&#39;s heart.<br />
<br />
&quot;No its ok... Its my fault, I believe the sequence had inadvertently affected her brain causing agression, hypersexuality, and a major superiority complex. I think I have the fix right here, I just need to administer it, where has she gone?&quot; Chaz was trying his best to look steadfast and unaffected but to be honest, hearing this was a major blow to his heart.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well she went with that guy Dale from the gym but I don&#39;t know where they actually went from there.&quot; Josh could see Chaz&#39;s hands were starting to shake a little.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I have an idea.&quot; Chaz sighed looking at Mara&#39;s instagram. Before all the changes had hit, she hardly had a folloing but within a matter of days, as she became sexier and sexier, she gain a fervent fan base. She had taken a picture of a hotel inviting her now many followers to &#39;come get some if they dared.&#39; He put the name in Google and found the address. &quot;Ill be back, I need to get this in her system as soon as possible, she might very well grow to a dangerous point if Im not careful, or even worse, get a major STD with how many people she plans on sleeping with.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me come with you!&quot; Josh wanted to support the boy he had loved his whole life but could never tell of his love.<br />
<br />
&quot;No I have to do this alone, its my job to make it right, besides since you&#39;re here, I was hoping you could take a look at my work til Im gone. Might as well double check and call me if anything is off that I don&#39;t know about.&quot; Chaz pulled out a syringe and injected himself with it. &quot;I need to be better equipped this time.&quot; He rushed out the door without another word. Josh stood there but only for a moment and headed through the basement door where he knew Chaz&#39;s lab to be. There he was met with a machine with &quot;Genodoc&quot; stenciled upon the top. Aftwr scanning through the many options on Chaz&#39;s computer on how to alter people Josh couldn&#39;t help himself and pulled a hair from his head. He had always felt different from what people called him. Infact Josh felt less like a &#39;him&#39; and more like a &#39;her&#39; even if &#39;she&#39; still liked to dress or do boyish things. The reason Josh got into gene editing in the first place was in the hopes of making people into who they truly were. The opportunity had come, and soon the changes would too. Maybe this would be Josh&#39;s chance to show Chaz who she really was.</p>
