<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With the front door of the Andersons&#39; residence currently closed, Regina Talbot rang the door bell as her husband fidgeted in position on the Andersons&#39; front porch. Leon Talbot, especially since he was the werelion king of Moon Lake, considered himself more of a doer than a talker, although the werelion representative of the Elders&#39; Council did know there was a time and place for words too.<br />
As a beautiful woman opened the front door, Regina said, &quot;Mrs. Anderson. You may not remember me, but I&#39;m Regina Talbot and this is my husband Leon.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh yes. Nice to see you again,&quot; said Martha, holding out her hand.<br />
As the ladies shook hands, Leon could smell that their hostess was a werevixen, which was odd considering her eldest son Nate was a werewolf.<br />
&quot;And pleased to meet you Mister Talbot,&quot; said Martha, turning to greet him.<br />
&quot;Leon, please,&quot; he replied, holding out his hand. <i>It may be a bit awkward once Jean and her son marry, but if I ever see this lady at The Were Club and she&#39;s willing...</i> he thought to himself, before getting back to the business at hand. &quot;Our daughter called about what happened, and we brought a fresh change of clothes for her.&quot;<br />
&quot;Jean&#39;s upstairs cleaning up at the moment. Under different circumstances I would ask if you&#39;d like to stay for dinner, but I&#39;m afraid our dinner got burned during the fracas and we&#39;re all about to go down to the hospital to check on our son Nate. How&#39;s your boy Peter?&quot; asked Martha, knowing their son was there too.<br />
&quot;A slight hitch in his recovery, but nothing serious,&quot; replied Leon, as the Talbots spotted their daughter coming up behind Martha.<br />
&quot;Hey Dad! Mom! Thanks!&quot; said Jean Talbot, as the werelioness grabbed the bag from her father.<br />
&quot;Is everyone all right? I saw the Bronco outside. Who owns it?&quot; wondered Leon.<br />
&quot;My other son&#39;s girlfriend Spencer Lawson,&quot; replied Martha.<br />
&quot;Well, the deputies already explained to me what happened, and I&#39;ll be glad to make full restoration to it for her part in apprehending the werepanthers who ambushed my daughter&#39;s fiance,&quot; offered Leon.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll be sure to tell Eric when he comes down from Skyping his other girlfriend Frieda Knight,&quot; promised Martha.<br />
Leon wanted to ask, <i>&quot;Other girlfriend?&quot;</i>, but instead latched on to the name. &quot;Frieda... Knight?&quot; knowing who Benton and Amanda Knight&#39;s only daughter was.<br />
&quot;Yes. She, Spencer, and Eric have some kind of special arrangement that I&#39;ll be the first to admit that I don&#39;t fully understand. But they&#39;re all in love and really happy together, so who am I to question it?&quot;<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; was all Leon could say, just as they heard someone coming up behind them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mrs. Anderson?&quot; said Jack Johnson, as he approached the group. &quot;I just wanted to let you know that there are additional arrest warrants and Elders&#39; scrolls out for Jack and Kenya Adaeze-Crawford. The Sheriff&#39;s deputies are tracking them down now for their part in the assault on your son.&quot;<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Martha, relieved that all the guilty parties involved would not escape justice.<br />
&quot;This case was important enough to bring out the District Attorney on his day off?&quot; asked Leon in disbelief.<br />
&quot;No. My parents live next door,&quot; replied Jack Johnson, pointing to the house on their left. &quot;My father&#39;s the one who initially called the Sheriff&#39;s office. By the way, he wanted to know if your son&#39;s going to be all right.&quot;<br />
&quot;When the paramedics left with Nate, their initial diagnosis was yes, but they still wanted to take him to the hospital to fully check him out,&quot; replied Martha.<br />
&quot;I understand. Well, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll want to be going down there as soon as you can, so I won&#39;t keep you much longer. But my dad also wanted to invite you and your husband over for tea sometime,&quot; said Jack.<br />
&quot;We&#39;d love to. We&#39;ll call him tomorrow and make arrangements.&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll be sure to tell him before I leave their place. Despite what happened here, I hope you folks have a good evening,&quot; replied the District Attorney, before he left to walk back to his folks&#39; house.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay. I&#39;m ready,&quot; announced Jean, as she came back downstairs now in her human form and fully dressed. &quot;William wanted me to tell you that as soon as he freshens up and picks out some clothes for Nate, he&#39;d be right down.&quot;<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; said Martha. Then she suddenly realized, &quot;Where the hell are my manners? Would you two like to come in and sit a bit before we take off for the hospital?&quot;<br />
Yet before Regina could reply, they heard more footsteps approaching their position, but this time from the opposite direction that Jack Johnson came and went from.<br />
&quot;Martha! We just heard! Is Nate all right?&quot; asked Mayor Pro-Tem Samantha Twist, as she, her wife Doctor Frances Twist, and their son Ben drew near.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your Honor?&quot; said Leon, acknowledging Samantha. &quot;Is the situation with the Crawfords <i>that</i> bad?&quot;<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not good,&quot; replied Samantha, formally greeting the werelion king and his wife, &quot;but we would have been here anyway. We live right next door,&quot; she added, pointing to the house to the right of the Andersons.<br />
<i>Just how influential are these Andersons?</i> wondered Leon, surprised that they already knew so many important people even before his daughter started dating their oldest son.<br />
&quot;When I get my claws on him,&quot; hissed Frances, flexing her hands while doing her best to keep her anger and her werecat fursona in check.<br />
&quot;Do I dare ask?&quot; said Leon.<br />
&quot;Tachibana no Akane informed us that Jack Crawford had Frances&#39; office bugged. You can imagine how my wife the therapist feels about that in regards to the sanctity of her patients,&quot; answered Samantha, as Ben put a friendly arm around his mother, ready to restrain her again if necessary.<br />
&quot;I see. Hence the Elders&#39; Council meeting tomorrow morning,&quot; realized Leon.<br />
&quot;Originally, yes,&quot; confirmed Samantha.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure the authorities will capture them soon,&quot; said Regina.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
The leased stretch limo drove out of Moon Lake, headed back to Seattle.<br />
Inside the back, cut off from the chauffeur by the tinted, sound proof partition, Kenya Adaeze-Crawford was complaining to her husband, &quot;Shouldn&#39;t we have heard back from your men by now?&quot;<br />
&quot;Not necessarily,&quot; said Jack Crawford, holding her hand in his. &quot;Last I heard, they were lying in wait for Nate Anderson near his place, but with the Labor Day Picnic he might not have come home yet.&quot;<br />
&quot;It&#39;s bad enough that cow of a reporter spoiled our plans for me to become Mayor,&quot; bitched Kenya, referring to the confrontation with the star reporter* of the <i>Moon Lake Gazette</i> exposing both Kenya&#39;s past as a professional escort and the Crawfords&#39; dirty schemes for the town, &quot;but I&#39;m getting horny,&quot; she added, as Kenya started rubbing the area in front of and between her husband&#39;s pants legs.<br />
&quot;Again?&quot; Jack said in disbelief. <i>No wonder she took up with a werewolf before me. Kenya needs a hard cock as often as a were-mer needs water!</i> &quot;We can do it here in the car,&quot; he whispered in her ear, &quot;but we can&#39;t assume our fursonas. The limo driver is a normal from the car service and not one of my men.&quot;<br />
&quot;Damn!&quot; cursed Kenya, as flashing lights began to light up the passenger compartment.<br />
<b><i>What the fuck?</i></b> Jack looked out the back windshield, and through the tinted glass just made out the outline of a Moon Lake Sheriff&#39;s Department vehicle with their roof lights flashing.<br />
&quot;Sir? Should I pull over?&quot; asked the driver over the limo&#39;s intercom.<br />
&quot;NO! Back to Seattle as ordered!&quot; said Jack, wondering what the hell they could want.<br />
Although both he and his wife had been served scrolls by Tachibana no Akane herself after the confrontation at the Labor Day Picnic, neither intended to appear before the Elders&#39; Council tomorrow morning.<br />
