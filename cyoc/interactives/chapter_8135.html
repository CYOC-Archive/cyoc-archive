<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sarah had a sudden pain in her hands and the lower part of her spine. The strange ache moved as if it were a snake winding about the bone in her arms. That ache in her back spread around her waist as it spread up into ribs and chest.<br />
<br />
Her knees became weak and she fell to rest on them. As arms wrapped her chest and moaning Sarah wondered what was happening the Medallion glowed with intent.<br />
<br />
Weaker and weaker she felt as the aches drained her strength. Crumpled down she fell to her right shoulder and then rolled onto her back as the colors of the room dimmed.<br />
<br />
Groaning now she looked straight up, her eyes fixed on the bright light attached to the ceiling. A strange thought began to work in her mind as if she should lay out and feel it's warmth on her belly. <br />
<br />
The ache move up her neck as then a mouth filled of pure human teeth ached of pain. Sarah's tongue strained out of her mouth as her face felt worse yet.<br />
<br />
A sniff of the air made new thoughts come to her that she'd never wondered about before. Scents, like the waste basket and yesterday's rotting Banana. A roll of her head to one side she could smell her rain coat and the dusty scent of aged museum artifacts.<br />
<br />
Sarah reached her right hand out to push herself up but found the concrete floor slippery. She thought this odd but remembered when she walked into her office some months back she slipped when wearing new shoes.<br />
<br />
The ache in her spine had calmed and her back felt as if it stuck up and out as never before. A sniff of the air brought thousands of scents, as one by one her mind sorted them out as some to ignore and others to fear.<br />
<br />
Even as she lay there still feeling many aches and some sharp pains Sarah could hear Boris moving around in his room. The shuffles of his shoes as he walked were new sounds she' never noticed till now. The nasty smell of his heating plastic burned in her nose.<br />
<br />
Taking a deep breath Sarah strained to call out for help. &quot;Ahhhhh!&quot; she moaned. Again she took a deep breath, &quot;Murraaaaaah!&quot; came out as her tongue would not obey her wish to form the name Boris.<br />
<br />
At last the pains dimmed and then they were gone. Rolling over Sarah found herself laying on her belly, legs to one side, head up and alert. Her left arm was folded up and tucked under her dull feeling body. Sarah's right arm was out straight, but as she looked down her thoughts studied what she saw.<br />
<br />
Cocking her head seemed oh so natural when trying to reason or think.<br />
Wondering seemed easy as many things interested her inquisitive mind.<br />
Yet too, her wonderment was cut short by a very much shorter attention span. This puzzled her but only for a short moment before something else took firm hold of her increased senses.<br />
<br />
Then the voices of those painters coming closer turned her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;My oh my look'e here what Sarah found for us as a model!&quot; said the one rather silly sounding painter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yup, Sarah is always thinking of us in one way of another. Here, take this length of twine and make a noose, slip it over the head and we'll tie it up near where we are painting, a fine model indeed.&quot; agreed the other painter.<br />
<br />
As the twine graced her neck she was urged to stand. A tug on her neck, she followed willing and inquisitive to see what these men wanted of her.<br />
<br />
Soon the sound of Boris saying something and then the three men started to laugh. Sarah looked up at them and feeling as if she was the butt in some joke began to give them a piece of her mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Muurraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!&quot; Sarah bellared. The very rough sound made the men laugh all the more as Sarah blinked in wild eyed terror.<br />
<br />
&quot;One willing little heifer, she'll make some bull happy in a year from now!&quot; said Boris as he reached down and squeezed one of Sarah's teats.<br />
<br />
&quot;Muurraaaaaaaaaaaah!&quot; bellared Sarah in response to having her udder yanked.<br />
<br />
Suddenly Sarah stood rigid, her thoughts returned to human reasoning long enough to bring the knowledge of her and those around her. Boris was always shorter than Sarah but now towered high above. The Painters both were the same height as her but they too were now taller. <br />
<br />
Sarah's dull tongue and the odd sound she'd roar out was a singular word, one word and only one word could her funny lips and thick tongue pronounce.<br />
<br />
Now she was feeling very nervous about the surroundings. Sarah shook her head as the feeling of larger ears slapped the sides of her neck and cheeks. A slap to her thigh, the to the other thigh made her turn to see if Boris was getting fresh again.<br />
<br />
Boris and the painters stood way off near their painting of the pasture scene. Yet the slapping continued as Sarah turning took a half step around only to have one question answered and ten thousand more appear.<br />
<br />
A bony tail was swatting her thighs as it stroked her butt. Her light tanned skin was now covered in light and dark toned patches. Wishing to reach out a smooth her hands over the oddness she saw her head bent ever so far around and that thick tongue slurped at the broad thigh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Muurraaaaaaah!&quot; said Sarah as the sights and sounds began to make sense and much more fears.<br />
<br />
Seeing the dark glass of her office, Sarah began to wander closer to see her reflection and learn why she did as she did and felt as she was.<br />
<br />
YANK! The twine drew up tight and stopped Sarah's movement. Turning around she began to yank back at the twine only to feel her throat becoming wrenched tighter by the twine. <br />
<br />
&quot;This won't work!&quot; she thought to herself. Then she cocked her head and saw something which might be of interest. Laying on a short stack of lumber for the stable scene was one extra window for the barn wall.<br />
<br />
The twine gave no resistance as Sarah climbed the wood stack on her hands. The black tar paper backing of the downside made the glass a good mirror as Sarah looked down.<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; thought Sarah as she turned to look back at the painters. Then looking down she moved ever so close to the glass. Looking back at her was a young cow. &quot;A pretty young and nice looking cow!&quot; thought Sarah.<br />
<br />
&quot;Muurraaaaah!&quot; Sarah bellared at the reflection. Her voice and exhausted wind caused the glass to steam over. As the steam dried and the glass again cleared Sarah jumped away from the terrible sight.<br />
<br />
&quot;Muurraaah!&quot; she bellared again as the real thought of her wish came rushing back to her shortened memory. &quot;I wished to be incognito about the barn for one week, to look, listen, sniff, and do what comes natural! I'm a cow, a heifer, an animal! Nobody know's this is me, I'm me I'm Sarah, no I'm an animal, an animal, a animal, animal, animal, a, a, a, ah, Muurraaaah!&quot; said Sarah till her thoughts slipped away and the one sound she could make issued her mind into the animal world.<br />
<br />
Now time had no meaning and as the afternoon worked onward the painters finished. They packed up and then called for Boris to dispose of their model. <br />
<br />
Boris looked around but no Sarah to give the problem to! Walking into Sarah's office he ruffled through her papers as an interested heifer looked on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, this is good!&quot; said Boris as he dialed the phone number.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes we have a runaway cow here at the Museum downtown, could you send someone to pick it up and take it off our hands? Good, one hour, great!&quot; said Boris as Sarah's ears heard the words but his actions seemed so vague.<br />
<br />
It wasn't long before Sarah's twine lead was being tugged along the museum's basement hall to the loading dock and a truck which smelled of friends.<br />
<br />
So much rolled by Sarah's large eyes she could not keep it all straight. Sights, sounds, scents, all came as a rush over her short attention span and thinner mental ability.<br />
<br />
Then at last the truck stopped and two hardy men lifted her off the truck. Looking up the men dressed in black and white paid the driver some money and taking her twine lead they tugged her along up a dusty road. As the men talked Sarah's mind was directed to the dusty road and the scents which touched her broad nose. The rustling of tall green grass made her tug to get at the sweet scented blades.<br />
<br />
The more she wanted to wander the harder the twine tightened about her neck. At last her will gave in and she obediently followed the men to one interesting smelling corral.<br />
<br />
Now her week as a heifer was to begin in earnest. The sights were all farm and a working farm too. The smells were as a waterfall of scents pouring into her weak mind and telling her to wander all the more. The sounds of men working, children playing and the moaning of beasts doing labor gave Sarah new insight as to what a cow's day was like.<br />
<br />
The mire of the corral, the dank smells from a trough filled with water and floating globs of cow saliva, Sarah was learning. She looked around as cows, huge cows walked near and some with their udders full would slap against poor Sarah standing alone.<br />
<br />
Standing as a cow can, like a statue, not a move just being alive and waiting for some reason to move. The hot sun baked down on Sarah as her thoughts and mind for the first day were captured in bovine dullness to wit.<br />
<br />
Evening came and the Farmer's son swatted her behind with a stick. A yelp of fright and Sarah found herself being worked into the barn. The cows, udders full were being milked as Sarah stood calmly by and watched.<br />
<br />
A friendly pat on her neck from the young Farmer he said, &quot; You watch close, a year from now we milk you too!&quot;<br />
<br />
The words played on Sarah's mind as the thought of being there next year and being milked as a cow gave her a shudder. &quot;One week, one, one, was what I wished! I hope to say if I'm here next year as a cow, oh no, please no!&quot; thought Sarah looking around her.<br />
<br />
The day turned to evening and with the loss of the Sun the wind died down and Sarah knew the sting of insect bites. Whipping her tail with the others she fended off the host of flies and nasty bugs which flocked to her and the other cow's behinds. <br />
<br />
As dawn broke a sweating heifer driven half crazy during the long night by those insects stood Moooing for release to the wide open pasture.<br />
<br />
When the barn door was opened the herd took off on the trot to high grass and open air. Sarah stood looking back at the barnyard and her time there. &quot;I hope to say I don't want to go back there tonight!&quot; she thought to herself.<br />
<br />
Grazing once mastered turned into a time of little or no use of her mind. Grab with lips, chew and chew, swallow, and grab with lips! again and again the pattern worked into her brain till no thoughts were needed. A totally learned action and reaction to a desire which filled her need.<br />
<br />
Now Sarah had joined the herd, joined the farm, joined the world of animals. Patterns and actions now filled her days as the life of a heifer took over her every thought. A calm feeling, a safe feeling from the herd was her's enjoy. Alone at first she feared for her safety, the herd filled her needs. Hunger was met with learning to graze, no hands to get in the way she groped her lips to gather grass and sometimes chucks of sod.<br />
<br />
It was during her week that she was angered when a young bull calf tried his best to bring her into his future herd. Kicking at him and a short bounding trot or run she tried to get away fro his strange attentions. At last he was so persistent that Sarah thought to see and watch his wonder at wishing to climb up and ride her back.<br />
<br />
Interested was Sarah until the young bull's forelegs clamped down around her girth. The probing feel of something hot about her privates made Sarah bellar at the young animal. Then her soft lips of sex were pressed apart and the entrance on a hot, stiff, rod moved ever deeper into her body.<br />
<br />
Sarah stood feeling fear mixed with wild sensual passion for more and more of this instinctive desire. The young bull being a little older and some bigger drove his shaft deeper into Sarah's hot sex than if he and she were of similar size. Then his thrusting began, it felt like a violin's bow being drawn of sensual strings of sexual passion.<br />
<br />
Sarah bellared in sweet satisfaction, this was a learning experience which till now she'd not partaken of as a human. The huffing and snorting bull soon had sweet Sarah huffing and enjoying their moments together. The ultimate rush of the bull's flood of hot semen into her sex was the last straw. Sarah looked back to her suitor and bellared her affections.<br />
<br />
As the bull dropped off his lover's back he stood feeling the retraction of his bovine tool. Sarah stood still feeling the heat of his semen working about in her body and the hope mixed with lust for him to start all over again.<br />
<br />
Looking to her rear she spread her hind legs and groaned a soft moan to her lover. Sarah's eyes closed tight shut as the feeling of her wet sex was licked clean by the new and loving bull friend. A cool afternoon breeze dried her sex and as the sensation faded she was again of the mind to graze.<br />
<br />
Day two, and three, and four, and five, and six, became as her first. Grazing and sensual play filled her thoughts and the warmth of each day. The flies of the barn worked Sarah's disgust till she would scream her agony for the return of the Sun.<br />
<br />
The afternoon of her seventh lovely day as a heifer came with a surprise. As Bullyboy humped her rump, his semen filling her void, the Medallion's power again began it work. The young Bull's weight soon seemed far too heavy for her back to support. The stiff rod was so deep and spread her sex so wide it caused real pains.<br />
<br />
Sarah looked back at him seeing her broad thighs now looking as light tanned flesh. Looking down she was resting on human elbows. As the Bull dismount his cock ripped out of her sex making the girl scream of rank pains.<br />
<br />
Unbelieved pains and the rank smell of cow dung piles about made Sarah faint into a deep sleep.<br />
<br />
The chill of night brought Sarah to sit up and look down the hill to a softly lighted barn. She sat there for a moment till her mind cleared and seeing her naked human form again she began to cry.</p>
