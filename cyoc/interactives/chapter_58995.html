<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">We walked through the door to our house laughing about Melissa's fate but our <br />
laughter died when we saw our mom standing with an angry scowl on her face. &quot;You <br />
girls are late,&quot; she said her anger coming out in her words. &quot;The meeting was <br />
supposed to start five minutes ago. You two had better have a very good excuse why <br />
you're late or I'll bind your powers for two months.&quot; She was very big on punctuality <br />
and would get mad if you were even a second late.<br />
<br />
&quot;We had to test the ring Richelle received Mom,&quot; Brie said doing a good job of being <br />
brave but I knew she was scared shitless.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what ring is this?&quot; Mom asked her tone making it plain that she didn't think much <br />
of the excuse.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Ring of Mordroch,&quot; I said lifting my hand so she could see it.<br />
<br />
When Mom saw the ring her face turned from one of anger to one of surprise. &quot;But <br />
that's impossible,&quot; she said shaking her head, &quot;the Hag of the Shadows was <br />
imprisoned within the shadows over three hundred years ago when the Salem witches <br />
found out it was she the children had been seeing and having a reaction to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It does grant wishes though,&quot; Brie said trying to convince Mom that I did indeed have <br />
the ring.<br />
<br />
&quot;What wishes has it granted?&quot; Mom asked looking a little pale.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I made the clothes of a woman disappear then I caused Melissa Thompson to <br />
need diapers,&quot; I said smiling. &quot;Her purse changed into a diaper bag. Also that she <br />
would have an irresistible compulsion to have someone change her and made sure <br />
that she couldn't kill herself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mom became stern and said, &quot;You better not be lying to me about this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn't Mom,&quot; I said my voice a little whiny. &quot;Try to take it off if you need more <br />
proof or I could make another wish.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't you dare use any power on me without my permission,&quot; Mom said her face <br />
becoming red and me and Brie shrank back. Mom calmed down enough to say, &quot;If I <br />
can't get it off then that will be enough proof.&quot; She took my hand and tried pulling it off. <br />
When she couldn't get it off she mumbled, &quot;De Lapsus,&quot; and tried again. I knew that <br />
spell was to make something slip off of something else but the ring stayed on my <br />
finger. Mom's eyes went wide and she said, &quot;It's true then. The ring has finally found <br />
it's way to where it belongs.&quot; Her face broke out in a huge smile as she said, &quot;This is <br />
fantastic news. Come we need to tell the coven about this. We can finally rule the <br />
world as we should have been all along.&quot;<br />
<br />
As we entered our basement we saw the members of our coven sitting in chairs <br />
around the room. There was Elijah Banks our headmaster at school, Carla Hades the <br />
librarian at the public library, Douglas Wood and Tim McQueen detectives on the <br />
police force, Gina Frost who had just turned nineteen, Michael and Rachael Frost <br />
tellers at the largest bank in town Gina's boyfriend Mark Galloway, Brie's boyfriend <br />
Damien Wools, and my boyfriend Daniel Faust. They looked up as we entered and Mr. <br />
Banks asked, &quot;Why are you smiling Annabelle? You're usually in a foul mood when <br />
anyone's late.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I was but now I'm in a good mood due to some news I just received,&quot; Mom said <br />
almost jumping for joy. &quot;Before I tell you though this meeting will come to order.&quot; Brie <br />
and I sat down on either side of Mom as was our custom and everyone straightened <br />
up. &quot;Now as you know our coven is dedicated to ruling the world to make it a better <br />
place. This was the vision of my ancestor Mordroch. He created a ring to help him <br />
achieve that goal but the fool Brondich and the Avalon elves deemed him evil and <br />
killed him before his vision could become a reality. His ring was taken by the Hag of <br />
the Shadows and has passed into the possession of several individuals since that time <br />
until the Salem witch trials when the Salem witches trapped the bag in the shadows.&quot; <br />
She smiled before continuing with, &quot;That has changed though. The hag is no longer <br />
trapped and has given the ring to my daughter Richelle.&quot; There was a collective gasp <br />
at this news.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't mean to be rude,&quot; Ms. Hades said, &quot;but we need to know. Are you sure that <br />
she has the Ring of Mordroch?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mom nodded and said, &quot;I tried getting it off her finger myself and it wouldn't budge. It <br />
matches the description of the ring. We all know that fakes have popped up from time <br />
to time granting wishes but they never matched the description, were never unable to <br />
be removed from the wearer's finger, and were never given to them by an old woman <br />
after returning something she left behind. Those rings were never able to transform <br />
something within minutes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's true,&quot; Mr. Frost said nodding. He looked at me and asked, &quot;Could we have a <br />
demonstration?&quot;<br />
<br />
I looked at Mom and she said, &quot;It's your decision. By rights you now lead the coven.&quot;<br />
<br />
I smiled and said, &quot;Well then I guess a little demonstration is in order.&quot; I looked around <br />
to gain some inspiration on something to transform. I wasn't going to transform a <br />
member of the coven so it would have to be something else. I would need to make <br />
sure that it couldn't be explained away as a glamour either. The problem there was <br />
that my glamours were so good that my mom had trouble seeing them for what they <br />
were. I looked down at the ring and an idea started forming. &quot;The ring's powers aren't <br />
dependent on the wearer's powers are they Mom?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not according to the stories,&quot; Mom said nodding. &quot;I think I know what you're thinking <br />
and if you're sure I will do it.&quot; I nodded my head and Mom pointed a finger at me <br />
saying, &quot;Alligo sua opis nam duo&nbsp;horarium.&quot; I felt the binding power of the spell and <br />
knew that I wouldn't be able to use my powers for two hours.<br />
<br />
I smiled and said, &quot;I wish that the chair in this room that Mr. Banks is sitting in would <br />
turn to lemon jello for two minutes and then reform as it was as soon as I finish <br />
speaking this wish and that every member of my coven present here is exempt from <br />
any mental change that may happen as a result of this wish.&quot; I watched with a smile <br />
as the chair changed to lemon jello starting from the bottom and working it's way up.<br />
<br />
The jello spread out as Mr. Banks fell through it and everyone looked at the chair in <br />
surprise. Mr. Banks took a piece of the jello and first sniffed it then licked it. &quot;It's really <br />
lemon jello,&quot; he said in surprise. &quot;It's not a glamour but a real transformation. Richelle <br />
has to have the Ring of Mordroch on her finger. This is great news indeed.&quot; He stood <br />
up and waited for the chair to reform before sitting back down.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know there's more on tonight's agenda so I'll let my mom continue to run the <br />
meeting,&quot; I said with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you sweetie,&quot; Mom said with a smile. Turning back to everyone she asked, <br />
&quot;Are there any possible converts who may join our coven?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There are a couple girls who like my stories about Mordroch and are interested in <br />
magic,&quot; Ms. Hades said. &quot;I've spoken with their parents and they are willing to let the <br />
girls explore their interest. When I told them that I might know a coven that would be <br />
willing to teach them they seemed interested but want to check us out first.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are their parents like?&quot; Mom asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;They are big on capital punishment,&quot; Ms. Hades said. &quot;They do want a better world <br />
for their daughters and said they would sell their souls to the devil if it would bring <br />
about that world.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mom looked at me and said, &quot;Since you lead the coven now you get to decide if they <br />
can be brought in.&quot;<br />
<br />
I thought for a moment then said, &quot;Bring them here tomorrow and I'll interview them <br />
myself. Anyone else have any possible converts?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Michelle Barns wants to see the end of war,&quot; Brie said. &quot;Her brother was recently <br />
killed in an ambush.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just the type we can use,&quot; Mom said with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll talk with her tomorrow after I talk with Ms. Hades' people,&quot; I said nodding. &quot;Any <br />
others?&quot; Everyone else shook their heads so I asked, &quot;Is there anything else Mom?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes there is,&quot; Mom said looking grim. &quot;Yesterday Elijah and myself caught one of the <br />
students listening in on our conversation. She ran when we noticed her which gave us <br />
cause for concern so we called Douglas and Tim to talk to her. They've brought her <br />
here to be questioned by the coven.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then bring her out,&quot; I said a scowl on my face. No one would run if they just <br />
overheard an innocent conversation so there was more going on here.<br />
<br />
Douglas and Tim left through a secret door and were soon back with who I recognized <br />
as Allison Rhodes between them. She was naked as was custom for those being <br />
brought forth before the coven. It was usually symbolic of one having nothing to hide <br />
but in this case it was done to emphasize our power over her. &quot;Let me go,&quot; she was <br />
saying as she struggled in Douglas and Tim's grasp. &quot;This is kidnapping and you can't <br />
treat me like this.&quot; Her eyes fell on Brie and she asked, &quot;Why are you here Brie?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's not important,&quot; I said before Brie could respond. &quot;What is important is why <br />
you're here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why am I here then?&quot; Allison asked looking at me.<br />
<br />
&quot;You tell me,&quot; I said with an icy tone to my voice which made Allison shrink back a bit. <br />
&quot;You overheard a conversation between Mr. Banks and my mom then you ran when <br />
you noticed them. Why would you do that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Allison looked around and said, &quot;I was afraid.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would you be afraid overhearing a conversation?&quot; I asked frowning.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well because of what I've heard,&quot; Allison said looking down and looking like she really <br />
was scared.<br />
<br />
&quot;What have you heard and how?&quot; I asked not liking where I thought this was going.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well a man came to our house last week,&quot; Allison said looking back up. &quot;He said he <br />
was with the FBI and he wanted to talk to us. My mom and dad invited him in and he <br />
started telling us a story. He said that a long time ago there was this sorcerer named <br />
Mordroch and that he tried taking over the world until one of his ancestors stopped <br />
him. He said that there was a group today that wanted to continue where Mordroch <br />
stopped and that people tended to end up dead around them. He said that they have <br />
a suspicion that Mr. Banks is one of these people.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; I said nodding. There was no sense that she was lying to us. &quot;This puts us in <br />
an awkward position. We can't just let you go after what has happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I say we behead her,&quot; Mr. Frost said.<br />
<br />
Allison went pale and said in a tiny voice, &quot;Please don't kill me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;See she knows too much,&quot; Mr. Frost said.<br />
<br />
I looked at Allison trembling and then glared at Mr. Frost saying, &quot;Well she didn't know <br />
so much before you opened your mouth.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can't talk to me like that,&quot; Mr. Frost said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh Dad,&quot; Gina said in a fearful tone, &quot;Richelle has the ring.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr. Frost didn't back down saying, &quot;The chair was just a glamour. Annabelle knows <br />
that some of us have been getting tired of her leading the coven and came up with <br />
Richelle getting the ring so they can keep control. You all fell for their trick. Come on <br />
Rachael, Gina we're leaving the coven.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Honey you know I love you but I'm not leaving the coven,&quot; Mrs. Frost said. &quot;I want a <br />
better world for Gina and our grandchildren.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not leaving either Dad,&quot; Gina said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You both will do as I say,&quot; Mr. Frost said. He then pointed at Gina and said, <br />
&quot;Especially you. You're still living under my roof and as long as you do I forbid you to <br />
be in this coven.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then as of this moment I no longer live under your roof,&quot; Gina said glaring at her dad.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are free to leave the coven of course but you can not make others leave,&quot; Mom <br />
said looking coldly at Mr. Frost. &quot;Just remember what betraying the coven means.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr. Frost glared at my mom and said, &quot;That's just something to keep you in power <br />
through fear.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know that it was established after our coven was nearly wiped out by someone <br />
betraying the coven,&quot; Mom said her gaze turning cold.<br />
<br />
&quot;We just have your word for that and I don't believe it,&quot; Mr. Frost said his face getting <br />
red. He then made the stupidest move any member of the coven could. He raised his <br />
hand toward me, Mom, and Brie saying, &quot;Incendo.&quot; His face became filled with <br />
surprise as nothing happened and he was seized.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have betrayed the coven in front of the coven,&quot; Mom said her tone icy and her <br />
face red.<br />
<br />
I was just as angry as my mom was and since I was leader of the coven now it was <br />
up to me to pronounce the sentence though I could tell my mom really wanted to. <br />
&quot;There is but one punishment for betraying the coven,&quot; I said my voice icy, &quot;and that is <br />
death. I sentence you to be beheaded immediately. Remove his clothes.&quot; I looked at <br />
Gina and her mother saying, &quot;Since he is related to you I won't force you to watch but <br />
I will need you two to reaffirm your oath.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm staying,&quot; Gina said tears running down her cheeks but otherwise she was <br />
controlled. &quot;Oh and I was the one that bound your powers Dad. I thought you would do <br />
something like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Mr. Frost's clothes were removed Mrs. Frost said, &quot;I'm staying too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How can you just stand there and let them kill me Rachael?&quot; Mr. Frost asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's the law,&quot; Mrs. Frost said. &quot;I can feel it. It's real.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please don't kill him kill me instead,&quot; Allison pleaded and meaning it.<br />
<br />
&quot;That is very noble of you Allison but we can't do that as you're not a member of the <br />
coven,&quot; Mom said as the chopping block and ax were brought out.<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll do anything to stay in power,&quot; Mr. Frost said venom dripping in his voice. &quot;I <br />
knew you would do this so I took precautions. I will return soon and have my revenge.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't think you will,&quot; I said through narrowed eyes. &quot;How would you like a daughter <br />
Gina?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I would like one,&quot; Gina said with a nod obviously catching on to what I was thinking.<br />
<br />
I looked at Mr. Frost and said, &quot;You obviously planned on possessing someone if you <br />
died by our hands. Well you will be reborn instead and have no memory of this life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't have the power bitch,&quot; Mr. Frost growled as his head was secured to the <br />
chopping block.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's where you're wrong,&quot; I said in a low voice. I pointed at Mr. Frost and said, &quot;I <br />
wish that your soul will remain in your body until you die and when you do die your <br />
soul will immediately be transferred into your daughter's daughter who was recently <br />
conceived with no memory of this life of yours.&quot; I lowered my hand and said, &quot;Proceed <br />
with the execution.&quot;<br />
<br />
I saw Allison just sitting there in shock evidently unable to move as Douglas raised the <br />
ax. Before he brought the ax down Mr. Frost said, &quot;You'll all see that they have been <br />
lying to you. I will be back in the body I had planned on and then we'll take control of <br />
the coven from these tyrants.&quot; Douglas brought the ax down slicing through Mr. Frost's <br />
neck cleanly. His body jerked and convulsed as blood flowed from his neck.<br />
<br />
I went over and released Mr. Frost's head. Holding it up I smiled and said, &quot;I takes six <br />
minutes for a person to die so I'll let you watch the rest of the meeting from my lap. At <br />
least as much as you can see before you die.&quot; I sat back down and looked at Allison <br />
asking, &quot;Now what do we do with you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Allison screamed and tried to run but was caught by Tim. &quot;Please don't kill me,&quot; she <br />
pleaded tears streaming down her cheek.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh but you were willing to die for him just moments ago,&quot; I said petting Mr. Frost's <br />
head and watching Allison shake with fright and pee where she was standing. I smiled <br />
and said, &quot;I'll tell you what. I'll give you several options I'm considering and I'll let you <br />
pick which one will happen to you. The first one I'm considering is making you part of <br />
the coven. The second one is transforming you into a statue. Third is transforming you <br />
into a doll for Gina's daughter. Fourth is transforming you into a self-cleaning diaper for <br />
Gina's daughter. Fifth is transforming you into a swimsuit for me. Sixth is transforming <br />
you into a necklace. Seventh is being executed like Mr. Frost was. Pick which one you <br />
want or I'll pick for you.&quot;</p>
