<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The moment Katie touched the book started glowing a dark red color. Katie managed to say :&quot;hey Tiff look at this&quot; and the moment Tiff turned to look at Katie the books glow had spread to her hand and she let out a shriek. That got Tiffs attention as she quickly ran over to her friend but it was far too late as she saw that the light had not only spread from her hand but all the way up to her elbow.<br />
<br />
Tiff placed her hands on her friends glowing hand in a desperate attempt to pull her free from it but it only resulted in both of them being stuck. Tiff gulped and said with a shaking voice: &quot;What do you think will happen to us?. &quot;I think we are about to find out&quot;. Was all Katie managed to say before the glowing light enveloped itself around both of them. The first one to change was Katie as her uniform started to morph and became a single peace of clothing. After that her uniform turned into latex and her skirt tightened up, in fact the skirt tightened up so much that her knees was touching each other.<br />
<br />
Then the skirt started to grow downward past her knees down her angles then it finally stopped. What changed next was her top as it changed into a tight corset that tightened so much she would barely be able to breath nor bend in any directions whatsoever. The magic quickly moved up to her head as a latex veil was the next thing to appear covering her hair and grew all the way down to her ass. As a final gesture the magic changed her shoes into a pair of 9 inch thigh high stilettos making her moving around almost completely impossible.<br />
<br />
Now the magic started to gather it&#39;s attention to Tiff and the first thing to change there was her shoes as they turned into latex and gained a 4 inch heel. Here though the magic was different as it moved upwards it was clear that a pair of stockings was appearing but when it reached her ankles a chain appeared and connected her legs not tight but it was 10 cm long. The magic kept moving upward and upward the stockings climbing along with it, the moment they hit her thighs they stopped.<br />
<br />
When the magic reached her skirt it did also change into latex but instead of growing down it grew up more and more until it barely covered her ass of course her panties had disappeared and been replaced by a chastity belt that included a dildo going deep inside her vagina. Finally the skirt stopped moving up and the magic started to change her top. Instead of turning into latex her top transformed into the same metal as her chastity belt and slowly grew upward until it hid nothing but her breasts though those were firmly covered as she would have no access to them. <br />
<br />
The magic moved even more upward and as it reached her neck a tight collar with a chain hanging from it as a final a veil appeared in front of her face just like she was an Arabian belly dancer and final the glow stopped. They both looked at each and Katie slowly moved her hand away from the book and Tiff removed her arms from Katie.<br />
<br />
They looked at each other for a long time and finally Katie broke the silence: &quot;what the fuck?!&quot; and Tiff simply nodded and said: &quot;looking at the bright side we can hopefully take this crap off&quot;. She started with her skirt which surprisingly felt straight down then she wanted to bend forward but finally she felt the giant dildo inside her and she let out a huge gasp as it pushed on her private parts. &quot;What happened?&quot;<br />
Asked Katie as she heard her friend gasp and saw her friend face change to a worried look.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think i might have something inside my vagina&quot;. she said right after and moved her hands down to the chastity belt and started to pull it down too but it would not move! Then she moved her hands around looking for an opening to it but when she found none she sighed and said: &quot;let me help you instead hopefully not all of it is permanent&quot;. The first thing they tried to remove from Katie was her veil but when nothing happened there they moved to her dress and incredible enough they could undo her corset to Katies relief the dress felt down without much issues just like Tiffs skirt.<br />
<br />
They both looked at each other when the dress felt to the floor and Katie took a deep breath thanks to the corsets restraints. Then they moved to her boots and luckily they came off easily too as the only thing that seemed permanent on Katie was her nun veil. &quot;Thank you Tiff we must find a way to get you new underwear off and find some new clothes&quot;. They both nodded at that but Tiff nodded and felt her own Arabian veil touch her and tried to remove it and luckily for her it felt off.<br />
<br />
&quot;thank god let&#39;s get some clothing i can always cover myself up though this thing pushing inside me might be problematic and&quot;. She pointed at her chains: &quot;those&quot;. Katie just hugged her but when she moved in close they both realized that she still had that damn collar and chain too after fumbling a bit they did find a lock that thankfully opened it and it felt to the floor. Both of them then continued to hug each other for a while. <br />
<br />
When they finally moved away from each other they started to freeze as the adrenaline from the experience was used up and the cold started hitting them after all they were almost naked now. They then finally agreed upon finding some new clothes and Tiff said: &quot;where shall we start?&quot; and Katie said:&quot;how about the..</p>
