<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">On any an afternoon, much of what you see and hear happens just that way day, after day without much change. September that year and on the first day after a Labor Day weekend, what might have happened turned into an beguiling and evil situation.<br />
<br />
Two good chums walked from the city bus stop nearest the house and home of Cody Jarret, we walking and talking about that our first full day of continuing education, college that is!<br />
<br />
Nearing the corner where I needed to turn and head for home, we heard the barking of one exceptionally large dog Miss Agnes Smyth kept as her very private pet.<br />
<br />
“Come! Come here, big boy,&quot; urged Cody, seeing the always playful giant Airedale frolicking about her lawn. Cody always tried to be very friendly to the pets belonging to people he serviced on his evening newspaper route.<br />
<br />
Miss Smyth and her big dog, Bunsen, were where things in that neighborhood tended to get rather strange. The seemingly old woman by how she acted, but by some bequeathed reason she retained the form and figure of one “Knockout” younger looking of a female. This led us who had any dealings with her to consider her as if some perverted person.<br />
<br />
She seemed and acted as if older but when seen she looked the part of a woman in her early thirties. She often stood or just sat in a rocking chair on the sun porch that began at the front of her house, taking a turn and stretching the length of the home ending where it joined a wood deck she recently added onto her house.<br />
<br />
This time we failed to take note of Miss Smyth, she sitting in her porch rocking chair, watching us both like a Hawk seeing its prey.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cody Jarret, you stay away from my pretty pet,&quot; yelled Miss Smyth, she using her sometimes nasty, but on that time she used an alluring and sexy sounding tone of voice.<br />
<br />
Cody used his common newspaper delivery smile toward the woman, waving a hand at her as if to reply in a friendly agreement to her possessive attitude concerning anyone coming close to her pets.<br />
<br />
The two of us continued our walk home from the bus stop, we each giving an occasional and cautious look over our shoulders to see if the ole bitchy woman might be coming after us.<br />
<br />
We both took note of her using then that ruddy evil stare she so often glared at trespassers on her property, or certain people, like Cody and me she seemed to despise.<br />
<br />
I saw it first, making note to Cody as we stopped our walk and turned to see an uncommon sight. It was our turn to gawk, seeing the giant Airedale dog standing upright on its hind legs and fawning over the shoulders of our Miss Smyth.<br />
<br />
The large dog stood upright on his two hind paws. He almost nose-to-nose with the woman, his forepaws hung over her shoulders, as the woman and her pet rubber noses.<br />
<br />
I think seeing that drew our attention first, but with then the appearance of the big doggy producing an erection in its fullest possible state of ready, we gawked with youthful male jealousy, seeing that dog with his long, red colored, pointy shaft and his knot.<br />
<br />
Seemingly, the dog felt something special for that mean tempered old woman, even at a distance his manners toward her held two young men wishing they had something as fine as did her big dog.<br />
<br />
I knew from many a summer spent at Camp Rogers, that dogs there and horses alike, often would show their personal feelings, wants, or desires for food, and/or other pleasures, gaining a colossal erection.<br />
<br />
The sight of that big dog and the manner that it and his master acted on a “Spur-of-the-moment,” tended to make me feel to aroused and slightly squeamish to ignore it all and look away.<br />
<br />
Bunsen was just doing what most any happy mutt might. It was of Miss Smyth and her showy ways that made us uneasy.<br />
<br />
Praising her big doggy, she reached down her hand and took a firm grip to that engorged tool that stuck out, elongated, rigid in the extreme, and showing a male dog eager to please.<br />
<br />
&quot;Weird,&quot; I said, saying loud enough to Cody next to me that my voice carried and Miss Smyth looked at us and sneered.<br />
<br />
&quot;You sexy old slut,&quot; Cody shouted, as then we both turned and walked away.<br />
<br />
I went on home, but Cody had his evening paper route and was soon putting through the neighborhood seated on his Cushman scooter. He having a good throwing arm could toss the daily news mostly on front porches. As he rounded the corner towards home, he readied his last paper, but remembering the subscriber preferred it walked respectfully and properly placed in the mailbox, to save him from another nasty phone call, he stopped, walked quietly, and did place it on the front porch instead.<br />
<br />
Leaving his scooter running at the sidewalk, Cody walked up the long brick walkway to the house and steps of the Smyth Victorian styled house.<br />
<br />
&quot;Paper,&quot; Cody called like clockwork and turned to exit her property in haste.<br />
<br />
He was nearly to the front gate when the woman emerged and stood in the doorway. This time a broad smile clung to her face, like patience on a monument.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cody, come here.&quot; she called out in her most seductive sound, requesting and as much a demand at the same time.<br />
<br />
Cody, used good manners for most people, did turn around and stood looking up at Miss Smyth standing there on her large front porch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Ma'am,” I am sure was that respectful reply Cody so often used when addressing any female customer.<br />
<br />
I suspect that took the sexy slut by surprise, as she would have expected worse from anyone she had so recently scolded.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see you like Bunsen,&quot; she half-asked, trying to change the subject and lure some young person into a scolding or worse.<br />
<br />
&quot;He is a fine big and well endowed doggy and very friendly too!&quot; Cody said, remarking and as well chiding her commenting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes he's very special, being he is an exceptionally virile stud male Airedale with a loving attitude. Yet he is still mine, and I deem whom he gets to be around; do you understand me, boy?&quot; Miss Smyth saying, she wanting to make a point and maybe try to start an argument.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Ma'am!&quot; My friend Cody would respectfully reply, he knew that saying it that way would goad the ole woman.<br />
<br />
The woman stood at the head of the steps coming up to her porch; she said nothing for a long moment, maybe thinking what to do or say next. As then, without a change of expression, she requested Cody come to where so few ever she allowed to step, he became welcomed to step up onto her porch.<br />
<br />
Acting as if blatantly obedient, Cody stepped up and onto the porch, he said later of feeling what felt as if a light electric shock on his feet. The feeling danced up and down his legs, making them tingle.<br />
<br />
He stood there at the top ready to run for his life, as Miss Smyth, renown to the neighborhood for her being as some witch and a bitch.<br />
<br />
Memories of when he saw another of our friends, a Jay Winslow met Miss Smyth on her front porch, ushered inside her house as for some reason, and then vanished. Now that all happened a couple years ago, the police were seen at her house questioning Miss Smyth at length.<br />
<br />
Jay mowed her lawn faithfully every Friday afternoon and after seen entering her house, our friend failed to return home that night. We were all convinced she had eaten him alive. The entire neighborhood turned out to help in the search, but days passed without a trace of him, and we eventually gave up hope.<br />
<br />
As Cody cautiously stood before Miss Smyth, he ready to run, the Airedale pranced eagerly out of the house, passing by Miss Smyth, and walking out onto the porch as if to guard her and greet Cody.<br />
<br />
Bunsen looked excited at Cody, seemingly happy to see him, and then jumped up to stand on his two hind legs, fawning on Cody. Bunsen hugged him with doggy embraces, licking his face, and, like before, he gained another of his massive erections.<br />
<br />
As then Miss Smyth spoke and did then give her dog a demanding order to &quot;Speak.&quot;<br />
<br />
Instead of a common bark, as one might expect, out came pure American English words.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Cody, this is the new me, Jay Winslow! Oh wow, but from one friend to another we were all so right about her, she is really a witch. See here, she changed me, she did, to her personal and very private pet, but she is such a nice person. I get to play, and…we make love! She is a lot of fun. I like it here being this doggy for these past few days. She offered me this, me being her happy dog lover and spending a week feeling how she can thrill me. You come now, you and I we can play fetch, run, leap, and have some good fun.&quot; Bunsen spoke, that name as an alias name given him in place of what his parents named him, he as my friend Jay Winslow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jay, you're a dog! She made you her perverted big lust-loving stud Airedale dog! Moreover, hey nothing, you speak as if she recently did this change to you. How long do you think it was since she changed you, Jay, days, weeks, try years, Jay! We all considered you another missing person two years ago! Your mother went plum nuts and divorced your father, he since, moved away and lives in Arizona.&quot; Cody said, he astounded to discover Jay alive and as a dog belonging to Miss Smyth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn kid, too blasted truthful,&quot; grumbled Miss Smyth.<br />
<br />
As if suddenly snapping back to reality, the huge Airedale blinked and whipped his head around, giving a stare at Miss Smyth, her dog and pet did growl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Two years, you said it was just for a few days! Look what you made of me, take a good look at me; I am a full-grown dog! You fooled me, made me lose track of time, and kept me as this sex loving private playtime stud!&quot; Jay seethed with anger, speaking his mind, turning spitefully with hatred toward the woman that made him as her bestial lover.<br />
<br />
&quot;Enough, already,&quot; ordered Miss Smyth, she then ordering Bunsen to return to all fours, and become again as his doggy obedient self.<br />
<br />
Like an obedient dog, Jay returned to being as Bunsen, falling forward, and became again her pet and pleasure toy. Standing on all fours, his ability to talk diminished almost immediately, returning to the demeanor of an overly friendly pet.<br />
<br />
&quot;You could not have just greeted your friend. No, you had to tell everything! You tried to ruin my, our relationship, and for your act of aggression toward me, this shall not go unpunished, newspaper boy Cody.&quot; Said Miss Smyth, as she walked up close to a very scared Cody, in her hand she held a black and red beaded necklace.<br />
Cody remembered this well, he said his eyes went crossed. He stood there, held in a trance, and watched a hand coming closer to his face. Miss Smyth took and pressed some ancient looking charm against the center of his forehead.<br />
<br />
Cody says he remembers little of what happened next. He has dreamy recollections of watching his arms twist, muscles cramping and contorting, as they became the thick forelegs of what for some reason he understood was of a Mastiff dog.<br />
<br />
He told about feeling waves of some electric sensation, as hairs sprouted through his skin, and the terrible pain that woke him from his trance: the announcement of his long bony tail. However, all of his very descriptive notations told how the change encircled him. He stood there and did nothing, could do nothing, but stand and watch while his human male self became that of a mature male Mastiff dog.<br />
<br />
Cody would smile, saying how the change did not terrify him, but felt rather enjoyable. Sated, thrilled, he watched as the transformation from human to dog was, for the most part, enjoyable!<br />
<br />
His teeth falling out, replaced by those of a canine offered the only sensation of any pain. The pain he quickly forgot, when at the same moment the wave of change affected his maleness. He remembered swooning at the sensations, his balls getting bigger, furry covered, tucked tightly between his then hind doggy legs.<br />
<br />
Cody goes almost starry-eyed, when he speaks of what if felt like, as his human male organ did burrow up into his groin, it weaseling upward and sprouting out as a furry sheath and the prong he felt was his new trademark.<br />
<br />
He speaks so much about what it felt like, as if by being like a dog his male organ increased mightily in sensation. The sensation held him away from thinking of his dehumanization, of becoming then, as is a dog, and of what Miss Smyth might want of him to do.<br />
<br />
He says he does remember being inside a chain-link enclosure. Nervously he waited her returning for him; he feeling the urge to vanquish his doggy bladder, instinct took over shortly, him sniffing a post and lifting his hind leg anointed a spot marked by his scent.<br />
<br />
To me the exploits of when Cody was as a dog were disgusting. His need to urinate proceeded the cleaning with his tongue the remaining residue clinging about the end of his furry sheath. He made note how with some want and sense of urgency he tried to probe his tongue up and inside the sheath, loving the new sensation.<br />
<br />
He also remembers her coming out and fetching him to join with Bunsen, both of them thinking happy thoughts, tails wagging and Bunsen drooling.<br />
<br />
She needed little effort in coaxing Bunsen to follow her upstairs and into her bedroom. Cody followed them but had a feeling or thought form learned morals that doing this made him a bad dog.<br />
<br />
Cody stood at the doorway to the master bedroom, as inside the woman stood scantily dressed, beckoning Bunsen to fawn on her as he had done before with such gusto.<br />
<br />
Jay, or as then Bunsen obeyed his mistress, he leaped upright, fawning with his forepaws over her shoulders. He became then excited at coming prospects to a sensual situation. Tail wagging, Bunsen (Jay) bounced from standing on one hind paw to the other, dancing as he did, his maleness protruding, growing, expanding, becoming erect and rigid.<br />
<br />
Happy and as much willing to obey his master, with a long tongue lolled out a wide mouth, he licked his jowls with anticipation and likely some bestial lust.<br />
<br />
Miss Smyth, as we all knew of her, looked every bit the part of a mature and well-endowed woman. Yet from what Cody remembered, she was more a voluptuous female, seemingly much younger, more slender, with long legs, and from where he stood on all fours, his eyes seemed to remain focused, looking, staring at a crotch that seemed to keep captivated his small brain.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come to me my pets. Enjoy, and find why I changed your puny peckers to something hotter, and more willing,&quot; she beckoned.<br />
<br />
Bunsen was the first, he already standing upright, his shaft at full ready for pleasuring her and him. Cody remembers it as if frozen second by second in his mind. She guided the shaft engorged red shaft of Bunsen, pulling him forward until the point of his male organ did press into her body. Jumping about, Bunsen strained to thrust as the two slowly fell over onto her big bed.<br />
<br />
Cody remembers sitting like an obedient big dog, watching his master lay on the bed, apparently enjoying the molestation by her giant Airedale. Both lay stretched out in the missionary position, Jay worked hard, lifting his rump and dropping as he made each thrust. Cody sat and listened with an increased sense of hearing as the one did do panting and she only moaned.<br />
<br />
A thrust and the sound of something sloppy turned an ear. Watching Bunsen pump back and forth, Cody felt his own new maleness suddenly pressing out past the tickling hairs of his sheath, he reminded as of it wanting to be uncorked.<br />
<br />
Once she was thrilled enough from Bunsen, the offer turned to beckoning of Cody to take his turn. Bunsen flopped to the floor, exhausted from his hour-long romp, still sporting a stiff. He stood longing to be on his mistress again, but finished as according to her; he let drip some his juices on the rug.<br />
<br />
Cody, a fine and righteous fellow, felt embarrassed. He was not too sure, what she expected. His close watch of the orgy suggested the woman deemed her actions as if proper, but he still had some human morality remaining. He felt reminded of things taught as he had to sit there looking at her. She climbed off the bed, her near naked body looking near a decade younger than he could remember. Beckoning Cody to come close, she was urgently in need of more pleasuring and walking to him, she took hold to his muzzle and tried vigorously to position his nose into her still sloppy,<br />
dripping wet female sex.<br />
<br />
Startled, Cody let loose a bark, spun a quick turn and ran out the bedroom, down the grand stairway, and out the back door to his doghouse. His instincts told him the place that he had marked with urine was home, but with the pen door standing wide open, the time was perfect for an escape, but where could he go?<br />
<br />
Miss Smyth came storming out of her house, her voice and tone indicating to even a dog that he was in for some trouble. She handled him roughly and cursed him for being a coward. Soon locked into a small crate inside the big house (which Miss Smith kept for visiting victims), Cody stood looking at his new body. Even in his reduced mental state, he knew the breed he saw. He was even bigger then Bunsen from ears to tail, covered from top to bottom with a smooth coat of thick coarse black and brown fur.<br />
<br />
He sat and eyed his groin, the only part of him with almost bare skin. His big doggy sheath the tight bag of two big balls kept his mind busy. The sheath looked as long as had his human penis. The thought of Miss Smyth, she naked before him, her body began to bring on an erection marbled with veins and arteries. The scent made him sniff it and swoon.<br />
<br />
Day after day, Cody came to live in the crate. Miss Smyth would regularly come to feed him and fill his water bowl. One day, the police came about looking for yet another missing person, along with the worried parents of Cody.<br />
<br />
I formed a group of concerned friends and neighbors, as we walked around every city block of houses, checking in the bushes, scavenging the neighborhood.<br />
<br />
When Cody with those doggy ears of his heard my voice, he barked and barked, whining pitifully, crying as if in need of help, or until Bunsen came to his rescue.<br />
<br />
Bunsen knew the other big dog to be Cody from the scent, and his strong jaws and sharp teeth had the latch opened in short order, allowing Cody to run out from the crate. Cody saw me walking outside and, with a mighty lunge, crashed through the window. Barking and jumping about, Cody the monster Mastiff of a dog went to greet his friend, me!<br />
<br />
I know he knew me, as I felt some inkling that the dog was Cody.<br />
He acted as if near thrilled to death, similar as how Bunsen acted on various other times when I and friends came searching for Cody.<br />
Cody apologized to me later, he coming to fawn on me felt such a sense of excitement, he did pee a yellow hot stream and soaked the leg of my pants.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess, you belong to him now, or so he must belong to you,&quot; said my dad, he walking to come and see this new dog in our neighborhood.<br />
<br />
I just stood there appalled at my wet pants.<br />
<br />
Miss Smyth heard the barking excitement too and came running out her front door looking for the cause. Finding Bunsen had released me from the crate, she argued with my Dad over ownership, but he held his ground.<br />
<br />
After all, the big dog obviously did not want to be part of the Smyth household and he wore no collar or a license.<br />
<br />
Miss Smith stood watching the Mastiff dog, she had named as Cody too, (ironically named after my lost friend, a name to which the dog did answer to it right off), she seemed to reconsider and let me keep him. In the end, she looked as if she had something more to say, but she just stood on her front porch looking stark as I walked on with my new pal.<br />
<br />
A couple of weeks later, Cody came to me with his leash in his mouth and panting heavily. Taking this as a sign to walk him, I linked him up and off we went hastily, as if Cody had some direction already in mind. We ended up at the house belonging to Miss Smyth. Cody pulled me up onto her porch, where my feet felt a constant static shock. Cody began barking frantically.<br />
<br />
Hearing him, Miss Smyth stepped out of her house to give a warm greeting to us both.<br />
<br />
&quot;Speak, Cody,&quot; said Miss Smyth ordered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh buddy, it is me, Cody, I am inside this big dog body of what she made from my human body. Careful, she is as we thought, a witch, her ways evil and alluring.” Cody spoke, he speaking and moving his mouth so oddly, but quite intelligible.<br />
<br />
A bark of anxiety, and Cody warned me to take care for if she pulled from some pocket a chain of red and black beads with some charm attached, I should turn and run away.<br />
<br />
&quot;He would not pleasure me, and then Bunsen here let him run loose,&quot; she explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cody, you may come here as often as you feel the urge to talk.<br />
<br />
This porch is the only place where you can.&quot; Miss Smyth announced, as if in some devious and friendly fashion she had a plan cooking.<br />
<br />
My understanding of Cody being as my pet seemed a bit unsettling.</p>
