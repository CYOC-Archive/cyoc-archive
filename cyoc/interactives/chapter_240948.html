<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jay and Claws shrug, “dunno, really,” they say.<br />
<br />
Jeff thinks for a while, he then grins, he turns to Claws, “Claws, would you mind leaving me and Jay alone for a few minutes,” he asks.<br />
<br />
Both Jay and Claws look confused, “why,” both ask.<br />
<br />
Jeff’s grin widens, “I have a great idea,” he says, “however… I’d like it to be a surprise for you, Claws. Trust me, you’ll love the result, you can wait in Jay’s room, we’ll meet you there in a few minutes”.<br />
<br />
Claws looks at Jay who just shrugs, “do it, Claws,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Alright,” Claws says, turning and heading out of the room, closing the door behind him with his tail.<br />
<br />
Once Claws is gone and they hear the door to Jay’s room close, Jay turns to Jeff, “so, what is this… idea of yours,” he asks, still sounding confused.<br />
<br />
“I kinda like what you did to Claws,” Jeff says, “seeing him how he is now, I feel like, even though he seems to enjoy it, he must feel a little… well… out of place”.<br />
<br />
“Right, because we are human and wearing clothes,” Jay says, “while he’s a anthro lizard and… naked!”<br />
<br />
Jeff nods his head, “right,” he says, “before I tell you the idea, tell me, is Claws transformation permanent?”<br />
<br />
Jay shakes his head, “only 48 hours, until Sunday evening,” he says, “why?”<br />
<br />
“Make it permanent,” Jeff says.<br />
<br />
“Why,” Jay asks.<br />
<br />
“Do it, and I’ll tell you what I have in mind,” Jeff says, grinning, “trust me, you’ll LOVE it and so will Claws!”<br />
<br />
Jay frowns a little, “how I hate it when you are so secretive,” he says, before sighing and taking out his phone, opening the app and changing Claws transformation duration from 48 hours to permanent, then confirming it, “there… done! Now tell me!”<br />
<br />
Jeff grins, “so, basically, the idea would be, that you and me become anthro lizards aswell… permanently,” he says.<br />
<br />
Jay’s eyes widen, he then grins, “you know… I LOVE that idea!”<br />
<br />
Jeff grins, “I told you so,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Hehe… Claws will be so freaked out but happy,” Jay says.<br />
<br />
“I’m sure of it,” Jeff says.<br />
<br />
“But… since we’ll be… well naked,” Jay blushes a little, “which we’d have to get used to..., I mean you are my big brother… it will feel so weird and wrong being naked around each other”.<br />
<br />
“But FUN,” Jeff says, grinning.<br />
<br />
“Yeah… hope so,” Jay says, “anyway, what I’m trying to say is, that I’d have no way to store my phone and I don’t wanna wear a backpack all day!”<br />
<br />
Jeff grins, “I thought about that,” he says, “You could use the app to transform your phone into a device that looks like a wrist watch, and when you tap the screen a hologram screen will appear, showing all your apps. You’d also be able to call anyone and answer calls”.<br />
<br />
“That does sound cool,” Jay says.<br />
<br />
“And to be fair to Claws, I think he should get his own Chronivac-watch!”<br />
<br />
“Really,” Jay asks.<br />
<br />
Jeff nods, “I think we can trust him to not do anything stupid”.<br />
<br />
Jay nods, “yeah, defiantly!”<br />
<br />
Jeff smiles, “then, let’s do this,” he says, “I’d suggest, to be able to tell each other apart, we should have different scale coloring and patterns”.<br />
<br />
“What have you got in mind,” Jay asks.<br />
<br />
“Well, for me I was thinking maybe have my main scales be orange with black stripes and my under scales white”.<br />
<br />
“Like a tiger,” Jay asks.<br />
<br />
“Yup,” Jeff says.<br />
<br />
Jay grins, “you’d look so cool, Jeff,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Hehe, what about you, Jay,” Jeff asks.<br />
<br />
“Hm… I think… I think I’d like ALL my scales to be white,” Jay says, “but with light blue stripes”.<br />
<br />
Jeff grins, “so, a “white tiger lizard”? Hehe… you’ll look so cool!”<br />
<br />
Jay smiles, “thanks!”<br />
<br />
“You know… I think another big surprise would be to make Claws… our brother!”<br />
<br />
Jay’s eyes widen at this, he then smiles wide, “heck yeah! He’d be so happy!”<br />
<br />
Jeff smiles, “so, you in?”<br />
<br />
Jay grins, “hell yeah!”<br />
<br />
Jeff chuckles, “then, let’s get to work,” he says, “why don’t you work on yourself and Claws, and transform you phone into a Chronivac-watch, while I work on myself and create the Chronivac watches for myself and Claws?”<br />
<br />
“Will the watches be linked or independent, and how will Claws get his Chronivac-watch, he doesn’t own a phone,” Jay says.<br />
<br />
“I think each of us should have his own independent device,” Jeff says, “I mean, we trust each other, and I’m 100 percent sure we can trust Claws not to do anything stupid! And I still have my old phone, Claws can have that, I’ll just erase the contacts of my friends, but add my new phone number and leave yours, mom’s and dad’s in the contacts”.<br />
<br />
“Awesome, thanks Jeff,” Jay says, smiling, “alright… here it goes… hehe… he’ll be sooooo surprised!”<br />
<br />
“And happy,” Jeff adds, smiling.<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Jay says, smiling himself as he and Jeff begin to type away on their devices.<br />
<br />
Jeff smiles to himself, ‘it feels so nice seeing my brother so happy and excited,’ he thinks to himself, before turning to his laptop and begins setting up his own transformation, after transferring the program onto his phone, he starts by designing his new lizard form, and decides to make himself a 14-year-old. Jeff then sets the app on his phone to transform his phone into a Chronivac-watch. The teen then rummages through one of his drawers and soon finds his old phone, he unlocks it and erases all contacts, leaving only Jay’s and his parents numbers in tact and adding his own. Jeff then copies the app from his new phone onto his old one, which by the way is only a year old, making sure that the copy is its own and independent app, before setting up the transformation for the phone to become Claws’ Chronivac-watch.<br />
<br />
“Jeff, how shall the watches be secured and unlocked,” Jay asks.<br />
<br />
“How about with our eye colors,” Jeff asks, “Claws eyes are bright orange-yellow, so his Chronivac-watch will only unlock with his eye color”.<br />
<br />
“Cool,” Jay says.<br />
<br />
Jeff nods, smiling, “I decided to change my eye color to an electric blue”.<br />
<br />
“That’ll look so cool with your tiger-lizard look,” Jay says, “hm… I think… I’ll change my eye color to red”.<br />
<br />
“Hehe… that’ll look creepy, but also darn cool with your white scales,” Jeff says.<br />
<br />
Jay grins, “ya! By the way, what lizard have you chosen?”<br />
<br />
“Alligator lizard,” Jeff says, “what about you?”<br />
<br />
Jay smiles, “same,” he says, “after all, we are brothers, we should at least look the same, sooooo since Claws will be our brother, I decided to change his species to alligator lizard, I just hope he doesn’t mind”.<br />
<br />
Jeff smiles, “hehe… once he sees us he’ll understand and be over the moon!”<br />
<br />
Jay smiles wide, “yeah, I hope so!”<br />
<br />
“Alright, I think I’m all set,” Jeff then says, “how about you?”<br />
<br />
“Yup, Jeff, I’m all set,” Jay says.<br />
<br />
Jeff nods, “sweet,” he says then turns around, “on three, we both confirm at the same time. One… Two… Three! Go,” they then confirm their inputs, both shivering at the same time as the tingling rushes through their bodies.<br />
<br />
Jay smiles, “welp, time to strip,” he says, blushing.<br />
<br />
Jeff chuckles, “yup, this’ll feel weird and wrong, but we’ll get used to it,” he says as he starts taking his clothes off.<br />
<br />
“Y-yeah,” Jay says, beginning to take his own clothes off.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile in Jay’s room, Claws is sitting on Jay’s bed, ‘what is taking them so long,’ he thinks to himself, ‘what secret do they have,’ he then feels the familiar tingle rush through his body, he then starts to feel his body shift a little. Claws looks at his reflection in Jay’s mirror and tilts his head in confusion as he watches himself morph from a Chinese water dragon to an alligator lizard, “what the hell,” he asks out loud, “is this the secret? Changing me into an alligator lizard? Couldn’t they have done it while I was with them?”<br />
<br />
Claws stares at the door of Jay’s room, “I feel compelled to head back to Jeff’s room, but I was told to wait here,” he mumbles, “I hope they have a good explanation”.<br />
<br />
Back in Jeff’s room, Jay’s and Jeff’s own transformations are on the way, both already covered in their desired scales.<br />
<br />
Jeff smiles, “I must say, you are already looking pretty good, little bro,” he says.<br />
<br />
Jay grins, a little nub above his butt signaling the growing of his tail wriggles a little, “thanks, Jeff,” he says, “you look pretty darn good yourself!”<br />
<br />
Jeff chuckles, “thanks, Jay,” he says.<br />
<br />
Jay tilts his head, “is it just me, or do you look shorter and younger than before?”<br />
<br />
Jeff grins, “hehe, I was wondering when you’ll notice,” he says, “yup, I decided to regress myself to 14”.<br />
<br />
“Why,” Jay asks, his face starting to push out into a muzzle.<br />
<br />
“Well, I figured since you are 12, Claws is 13, I decided not to want to be age wise so far apart from my two brothers,” Jaff replies, “don’t worry about my friends and school, I altered the reality so that we all visit the same school, and I’m sure I’ll make new friends quickly”.<br />
<br />
Jay’s eyes widen, he then grins, “awesome,” he says and giggles, “it’ll be so much fun! I assume the reality alteration includes everyone, except me, you and Claws to think we have always been like this?”<br />
<br />
Jeff nods, “yup,” he says, as both their genitals change, their cocks taking on a canine appearance and their balls popping back into their bodies as a slit forms at the base of their new cocks.<br />
<br />
Jay grins, showing his pointy teeth as both of their hairs reside back into their skulls, their long tails swishing behind them as their transformations come to a close, “you really are the best brother ever,” Jay says, “I already feel more bonded and closer to you than before”.<br />
<br />
Jeff smiles, “same here,” he says.<br />
<br />
Jay smiles, “well, I think our transformations are done,” he says.<br />
<br />
Jeff nods, “yup, let’s go and surprise Claws,” he says, taking his Chronivac-watch and putting it on his wrist, then grabs the watch which is meant for Claws, turning around he sees Jay fasten his own watch onto his wrist, both then grin at each other.<br />
<br />
“Let’s go,” Jay says, “hehe… I can’t wait to see his face!”<br />
<br />
Jeff and Jay exit Jeff’s room and walk over to Jay’s, the two stop in front of the door, grinning at each other, before Jay reaches out and knocks on the door, “Claws, you ready for us to come in?”<br />
<br />
“Of course,” they hear Claws call.<br />
<br />
Grinning at each other, Jay opens the door, the two stepping into the room, “heya, Claws,” they say.<br />
<br />
Claws turns to face them, “what too… THE HELL HAPPENED TO YOU GUYS,” he then shouts, his eyes wide as he sees the two anthro alligator lizards grinning at him.<br />
<br />
“Hehe, surprise,” Jeff says.<br />
<br />
“Jeff? Why do you look… younger and shorter,” Claws asks, “and… why did you transform into alligator lizards… and WHY am I one?”<br />
<br />
Jeff grins, “well, I decided to regress myself to 14, so that we aren’t so far apart age wise… little brother”.<br />
<br />
“Wait… WHAT did you just call me,” Claws asks.<br />
<br />
Jeff grins, turning to Jay, “you wanna explain,” he asks.<br />
<br />
“Yup,” Jay says and begins to explain.<br />
<br />
Claws listens intently, and the more he listens, he can’t help but feel overwhelmed and happy, tears form in his eyes, “y-you… you did all that for… me,” he asks, a tear rolling down his face.<br />
<br />
Jeff and Jay smile, “yup, welcome to the family, brother,” they say.<br />
<br />
“You are no longer a pet,” Jay says, “you are our brother!”<br />
<br />
Claws is unable to utter a word, “one more thing,” Jeff then says, “here, this is for you,” walking over to Claws and holding out the watch.<br />
<br />
“What… what is that,” Claws asks.<br />
<br />
“You must have noticed that Jay and I are waring the same watches,” Jeff says.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, and,” Claws ask.<br />
<br />
Jeff smiles, “the watches were once our mobile phones,” he says, “now they are Chronivac-watches, but also able to receive and answer calls”.<br />
<br />
Claws eyes widen, “but… I don’t own a phone, how…?”<br />
<br />
Jeff grins, “I still had an old phone of mine,” he says, “I’ve deleted the contacts, except for OUR parent’s and Jay’s, and I added my number to the list, you can unlock it with your eye color, just tap on the screen once, look directly at the screen and it’ll scan your eyes”.<br />
<br />
“B-but… but why would you trust me with… this,” Claws asks.<br />
<br />
“Because we know you won’t do anything stupid,” Jay says, “you are our brother, so we just figured it would be only fair if you too would have a Chronivac-watch”.<br />
<br />
Claws takes the watch and fastens it onto his wrist, “I… I don’t know what to say,” he says.<br />
<br />
Jeff and Jay smile, sitting down on each side of Claws, “a “thank you” would be nice,” Jeff says, grinning, “we can tell how happy you are, and that makes us happy”.<br />
<br />
Claws looks at both, he then smiles wide, “wow… this is just… wow,” he says.<br />
<br />
Jay and Jeff chuckle, “wow… indeed,” they say.<br />
<br />
Claws looks over at Jay’s mirror, his smile widening, tears rolling down his face as he sees himself sitting between his two brothers, no longer a pet, but a real member of the family, he had brothers and parents, something he never even cared about or considered, but now the former feral water dragon lizard-turned-alligator lizard couldn’t be happier.<br />
<br />
“I… I think… I think I’ll enjoy my new life,” he mumbles.<br />
<br />
Jeff and Jay smile, Jeff lies an arm around Claws, “we’ll be here to support and help you with whatever,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Jay says, “we’ll have so much fun!”<br />
<br />
Claws smiles, looking between Jeff and Jay, “thanks… bros,” he chuckles.<br />
<br />
Jay and Jeff chuckle, “you are welcome, brother,” they say.<br />
<br />
“Brother hug,” Jay then asks.<br />
<br />
Claws smiles, “ye-yeah,” he says.<br />
<br />
Jeff and Jay smile as Claws lies an arms around each of their bodies and pulls them close before they wrap their arms around their new brother, holding him close, their tails wrapping around each other’s.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes they separate and grin at each other, “I have one last little surprise for you, Claws,” Jeff says.<br />
<br />
“Oh,” Claws asks, “I don’t think I can handle more!”<br />
<br />
Jeff chuckles, getting to his feet, “you’ll manage,” he says, “follow me!”<br />
<br />
Claws looks at Jay, who shrugs, “I dunno, I’m just as curious as you!”<br />
<br />
Jay and Claws follow Jeff out of Jay’s room and towards a door that Jay doesn’t remember, Jeff opens the door, “this is your room, Claws,” he says.<br />
<br />
Both Jay and Claws gasp as they step into the room, the entire room is in a boy’s design, with posters of anthro lizards on the walls, a desk with a laptop, a bed and a comfortable chill area with some bean bags and a table, and since a anthro lizard doesn’t need clothes, there is no wardrobe, just like in Jeff’s and Jay’s room, and due to the reality alteration, no one will mind them running around naked.<br />
<br />
“So, what do you think,” Jeff asks.<br />
<br />
“I LOVE IT,” Claws says, hugging Jeff tight, “th-thank you, Jeff!”<br />
<br />
Jeff hugs Claws back, “my pleasure,” he says.<br />
<br />
Jay smiles, wagging his tail, happy that all three of them bond so well, he then walks over to Jeff, hugging him too, “th-thanks, Jeff… for… for doing all this,” he says, tears rolling down his scaly face.<br />
<br />
Jeff hugs both back, kissing each on the cheek, “my pleasure,” he says.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes they separate, “so, what shall we do now,” Jay asks.<br />
<br />
Jeff shrugs, “I’d be fine with anything,” he says, “Claws, what would you like to do?”</p>
