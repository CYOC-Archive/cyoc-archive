<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Celine woke up when it was already beginning to dawn, thanks to that there was some lighting. She remembered having a weird dream in which Mary and her cousin fucked her using very realistic strap-ons, but seeing that she wasn&#39;t in her room and that she was naked she remembered the night before when she was talking with both and drank a few glasses of wine. She was lying on a mat placed beside the bed, on which Mary was sleeping with her cousin.<br />
<br />
Not wanting to disturb anyone, Celine got up and silently left the room, looking for the bathroom where she pissed before going back to get her clothes. By this time the room was already brighter and she noticed that Pearl had moved while she was sleeping, which made the blanket that was over her slip off. By this time the room was already brighter and she noticed that Pearl had moved while she was sleeping, which made the blanket that was over her and Mary slip, uncovering the two.<br />
<br />
Celine saw that the two women were both naked and the hard cocks between their legs, which she still believed were strap-ons. &quot;Celine saw that the two women were both naked and the hard cocks between their legs, which she still believed were strap-ons.&quot; she thought and moved closer, looking at the dicks more closely and amazed at the skill of whoever had made the fake diﬂcks so realistic! The lighting in the room increased and little by little she could see the shape and other details better, she then noticed Pearl&#39;s cock throbbing and found it strange, so she touched the girl&#39;s male member, which brought her to orgasm immediately. Fucking Pearl messed up her stomach and breasts, yet she didn&#39;t wake up even after she came. <br />
<br />
Celine was a little surprised and tried to remove Pearl&#39;s &#39;strap-on&#39; to see how it worked, but was surprised not to find any border for her body. She then tried to take Mary&#39;s, but she ran into the same problem and, while touching her neighbor, made her come too and getting her hands dirty with cum.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait a minute, they&#39;re not wearing strap-ons, these things between their legs are real dicks.&quot; Celine thought, then went back to the bathroom to wash her dirty hands. While she cleaned herself she spoke to herself in a low voice &quot;I can&#39;t believe they did it, they made me believe they were using strap-ons to fuck me. They were transsexuals this whole time and I didn&#39;t know it. Wait a minute, I don&#39;t know about Pearl, but you can see the inside of Mary&#39;s room from my bedroom window and I&#39;ve seen her change clothes once and I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ve seen her vagina. Aahhh, that just doesn&#39;t make sense.&quot;<br />
<br />
Celine then decided to drink some water, believing that she could think better of it, so she went to the kitchen where, opening the cupboard doors looking for a glass, she found a strange box with texts around it that said:<br />
-----<br />
This is The Vials<br />
<br />
To activate, press the button on the top of the box.<br />
<br />
Inside you will find many vials with pictures of animals and humans on them. When drank by a person or animal they will transform to the picture that is on the vial.<br />
<br />
The person or animal must drink the whole vial for full effect. When done place the vial back to where it is and it will fill itself.<br />
<br />
Enjoy!&quot;<br />
-----<br />
<br />
&quot;But what is this? From what it says this box is full of potions that transform people. Did Mary and Pearl take any of them and that&#39;s why they have dicks now?&quot; And now that I think about it they fucked me up being shemales, and they did it without any protection. Now complicated, How functional is their male reproductive system? What if I get pregnant? I better not take any chances, there&#39;s only one way to solve this, I&#39;ll have to become a dickgirl like them. If I don&#39;t have my female reproductive system for a few days I believe I can avoid any unwanted pregnancies, and my husband won&#39;t be coming home for the next few weeks so I don&#39;t have to worry. After a few days I send Mary to let me take the potion so I can get back to normal.&quot; Celine said to herself alone in the kitchen. She then opened several compartments of the box at once and looked at the vials, she took one that she recognized as having &#39;balls&#39; drawn on the label and, as it would only be temporary and only she herself should know, she decided to venture out and took a vial with a horse dick drawn on the label. Celine drank both potions and waited, not sure if anything would actually happen, until a few seconds later an effect totally different from what she expected.<br />
<br />
Celine felt a very strange sensation inside her breasts, which were getting bigger and heavier. When her breasts reached triple their normal size, stopping at that size, pressure building inside it soon after. Then her nipples open and a hard meatbar, which she recognizes as horse dicks, comes out of each breast through them.<br />
<br />
Celine was shocked to have horse dicks sticking out of her breasts now, mostly because it wasn&#39;t what she expected with the potions she drank. She looked again at the labels more closely and noticed that there were some very clear spots in what she had thought were &#39;balls&#39; and recognized as indicating nipples and that that vial was for breasts. She was ashamed for the mistake she had made and she didn&#39;t want to be seen like that, but...</p>
