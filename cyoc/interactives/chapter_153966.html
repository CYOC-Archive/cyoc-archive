<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A light popped in through a closed window shade as Freddy and Michael continued sleeping. Michael was resting comfortably in his bed, while Freddy had managed to get some sleep on the air mattress on the floor, albeit not easily. Freddy was the first to sit and wake up as he looked around the room for a sign of what time it might be. Not knowing how early it was, but suspecting that Michael’s parents had already left for the day, Freddy stretched for a yawn and then got up to use the bathroom. <br />
<br />
When Freddy looked at himself in the mirror, he saw a handsome young man with a slight bit of scruff on his face. He felt that it made him look sexy. He felt that it made him look manly. He felt that it was unfortunate that all of that would be nothing as Fido would have his way with Michael this morning and not him. Finally, after doing his business and washing his hands, Freddy peered across the hall to discover that Michael’s parents had left for the day. Relieved, he made his way back to the bedroom and stood over a sleeping Michael.<br />
<br />
Michael looked peaceful in his sleep. Despite how rough their week had been for the both of them, he seemed to be sleeping with a smile on his face. Smiling above him, Freddy was happy that his lover’s dreams were peaceful at least. Leaning down, Freddy gave Michael several kisses on his forehead. Stirring in his sleep, Michael turned on his side as Freddy moved into the bed to spoon from behind him. Freddy began to press himself into Michael’s back as he tried to doze off again. Finally, after a couple of minutes, Freddy could see Michael wake up and turn on his other side to look at him face to face.<br />
<br />
“Morning sleepy head” Freddy said with a smile, the first thing Michael saw as he woke up. <br />
<br />
“Hmmm, Morning” he responded, stirring as he began to become aware of his surroundings. <br />
<br />
Unlike Freddy, Michael wasn’t much of a morning person. <br />
<br />
“Look who wants you?” <br />
<br />
Freddy pointed to his penis as it began to stir in his boxers. <br />
<br />
“Freddy, I don’t know.”<br />
<br />
“Fido wants a play date. Can I bring the dog out to play? Please Michael?”<br />
<br />
Freddy leaned into to Michael as he began to kiss him gently on the lips. <br />
<br />
“What time is it?”<br />
<br />
“I’m not sure.”<br />
<br />
Michael sat up as Freddy followed. He looked around the room before finding his phone on his dresser. It was a little after 9. <br />
<br />
“I think my parents have already left for the day” Michael said as he put down his phone. <br />
<br />
“I know” Freddy replied. “I peaked at their room while I was using the bathroom. They weren’t in there.”<br />
<br />
“Freddy…”<br />
<br />
Michael sat down quietly as Freddy looked at him longingly before sitting beside him, waiting to hear what he had to say. <br />
<br />
“I decided” he continued “to let you have this opportunity to fuck me as a dog.”<br />
<br />
Freddy beamed as he enthusiastically hugged Michael and kissed him all over his head and neck.<br />
<br />
“Michael! he exclaimed. “I promise you, you won’t regret this.”<br />
<br />
“I hope not” he replied nervously. <br />
<br />
Freddy stood up as he began to strip off his boxers and t-shirt, leaving himself fully nude in front of a still fully clothed Michael. Michael sat on the bed as he intently looked up at Freddy. <br />
<br />
“Come on!” Freddy urged Michael. “What are you waiting for? Take off your clothes already so we can get down to it.”<br />
<br />
Michael paused for a moment, before he sighed. He slowly stood up and began to take off his clothes. He took off his t-shirt and then paused for a moment. <br />
<br />
“Michael?” Freddy asked cautiously. “We don’t have to do this if you don’t want to. I know I might be eager to, but I’m not going to force you to do it if you don’t want to.”<br />
<br />
“It’s fine, Freddy” he responded as he slowly shimmied his pajama bottoms off of him. “I know you’ve been dying to get at my ass all week, so I think it’ll good for the both of us to have a little fun before this real dangerous operation begins.”<br />
<br />
Michael grabbed at his underwear and slowly moved it down his legs before kicking it from his feet. Freddy thought that this little strip tease show was hot. His boner was getting bigger than ever. He could feel the dog inside him ready to emerge from beneath him. He wanted to make sure Michael was prepared before Fido came out to play. <br />
<br />
“Let’s see how that dildo is doing” Freddy continued as he motioned Michael to turn himself around.<br />
<br />
Presenting his backside to him, Freddy pushed Michael onto the bed as he took the loosening black dildo out from the butt before him.  He gently pulled it out, but it seemed to be almost falling out on its own without any prompting from him. Freddy placed into his hand as he looked it over briefly, before looking down at Michael’s quivering pucker.<br />
<br />
“Your asshole seems about as ready as it ever will be” Freddy noted as he put the dildo on Michael’s dresser. “Still, just to be on the safe side, you should probably wash up and take an enema.”<br />
<br />
“Good idea, Freddy” Michael replied. <br />
<br />
Michael got himself into the bathroom as he took an enema and waited several minutes while sitting on the toilet. Feeling the urges in his butt, he did his business and then took a shower. Michael took extra time working his fingers into his asshole, wanting to make sure it was as loose as possible before Freddy, or rather Fido, stuck his penis up there. The expanding knot was going to be a challenge. Hopefully, it wouldn’t make his colon erupt. That would be a difficult thing to explain to a doctor if a medical emergency arose. <br />
<br />
After Michael felt rejuvenated and refreshed, he stepped out of the shower to dry himself off before he went back to his room. He knew he’d be in here again after this was done, but it was always nice to have that fresh, clean feeling from getting rid of the night sweat that accumulated on his person as he slept. <br />
<br />
Michael stepped back into his bedroom as he saw Freddy waiting patiently for him on the bed. Freddy’s erection has softened slightly, but it began to grow again as he saw Michael standing before him. Like with Freddy last night for Michael, Michael’s near nude state, with only a towel around his waist, was a sight for Freddy’s sore eyes, who was getting very turned on by his boyfriend.<br />
<br />
“You’re the sexiest man I know” Freddy said lustily as he got up and began to make out with Michael. <br />
<br />
Lost in the moment, Michael’s towel fell to the floor as the two naked boys made out with each other in passion and lust. They both needed this. They had both waited for so long to do this. It felt like the right time, even if Michael dreaded in the back of his mind what would happen when Fido’s knot made an appearance in his asshole. <br />
<br />
Freddy gently eased Michael onto the bed as he got on top of him. As Michael looked up from his laid down position, he saw Freddy smiling, almost panting in anticipation.<br />
<br />
“Michael…” Freddy said as his tongue licked his lips. “I can feel myself about to dog out now. Can Fido come out to play?”<br />
<br />
“Yes boy” Michael responded, knowing his decision was already made when he could feel Fido’s sheath tickling at his leg. <br />
<br />
Knowing a decision was made, Freddy was apt to just let his changes happen. He began to grow fur all over his body as he reshaped to fit into the stance of a dog. This was a different experience for Michael as he watched his boyfriend transform before his very eyes up close and personal. He could see the transformation happen in full detail, something that fascinated him as Freddy lost himself in the changes. In a fit of lust, Michael began to rub Freddy’s back as he felt black fur growing there, tickling his fingers. Freddy smiled as he looked at Michael with lust in his eyes, happy that his boyfriend was as eager to please him as he was to please him in return. <br />
<br />
Michael could feel Freddy’s feet mutate into paws, but began to feel discomforted when Fido’s claws poked at his skin. Noticing the discomfort, Freddy apologized with his growly voice as he shifted into a hands and knees position. His legs then shifted to become a dog’s hind legs, with his tail slinking out and wagging happily behind him, swinging back and forth. The fur finished growing on his stomach as his upper body shrunk to fit the stature of a dog. Freddy briefly placed a hand on Michael’s face before it shrunk, grew furry and mutated into a dog’s paw. His other hand followed seconds later as his arms shrunk and turned into a dog&#39;s front legs. Freddy placed them on the bed to keep himself steady, now standing exactly like a dog. <br />
<br />
Freddy looked into his boyfriend’s eyes as his own began to change. Michael noticed this as Freddy’s last bits of changes took place before him. Freddy’s face became furry as his nose and mouth expanded out into a muzzle. His nose became cold and damp and his ears raised themselves to the top of his head. After a few more shifts, the changes were complete. Soon, where Freddy had stood mere seconds ago was Fido, the German Shepherd dog, happy to see his master again. <br />
<br />
Fido began to pant before he licked Michael’s face. Michael gave him a hug as the two began to embrace. Michael could feel Fido’s pointy red penis scraping itself across his leg. He wanted to get this over with. Might as well try to ease Fido away from the foreplay so they could get on with it. <br />
<br />
“Alright Freddy” Michael said as he got off from the bed as Fido hopped off to join him. “Let me get myself into position so you can fuck me, ok?”<br />
<br />
Fido looked up at Michael as he got back on the bed and placed himself on his hands and knees. Freddy didn’t think this scene before him was very sexy. He wanted to engage in some foreplay first before he took Michael’s cherry for the first, and likely only time, as a dog. Still, he knew in the back of his mind that Michael was anxious to get this over with, so considering he had offered himself up to him freely for his sexual desire and release, he was eager to oblige, if only reluctantly.<br />
<br />
Fido hopped back onto the bed as he sought to steady himself before looking at the sight before him. There, exposed him in all its glory, was what he had been waiting patiently for since Michael had given him head earlier in the week. More than Ellie or the stray bitch in heat at the park, this was the hole that Fido, not just Freddy, wished to breed most. This boy had sacrificed himself for him and showed him unconditional love and affection. It wasn’t just his hormones talking. There was genuine sense that, for the first time, Fido was going to fuck someone who seemed to love him. At least, that’s what the dog instinct thought. <br />
<br />
Gently, Fido stuck his snout into Michael’s cute little pucker as he sniffed at the butt a few times. It smelled clean, like freshly scented soap. He could also smell a little musk linger between Michael’s butt cheeks. It didn’t give off the sorts of information that a dog’s butt flaps did, but it was erotic to Fido and turned him on nonetheless. <br />
<br />
Satisfied with his sniffing, Fido got to work on licking Michael’s asshole clean. He wanted to give Michael some pleasure of his own before he got to work on pounding him from behind. Feeling the slobbery tongue work its way on his asshole, Michael let out a loud, involuntary moan. As much as he hated to admit it, while Fido’s nose sniffing him uncomfortably tickled Michael a bit, this licking, this foreplay, was turning him on greatly. <br />
<br />
Michael could feel his own dick rising as he sprouted wood right there on the spot. Fido noticed this too and reached his head under Michael’s thighs to lick at his balls and cock. Michael moaned even louder now as he moved a hand to his dick to begin jacking himself off. Fido was happy to oblige Michael’s need to masturbate as he wanted him to be in a good mood before popping his dick into his asshole. Fido continued to lick at Michael’s thighs as he he saw his boyfriend jerking off his cock, quietly moaning in pleasure above him. <br />
<br />
Finally, after a couple of minutes of this, Fido noticed Michael’s balls contract into him as he heard his lover let out a loud moan above him. <br />
<br />
“Freddy!” he yelled in excitement. “I’m gonna cum! Ah! Ah!!!!”<br />
<br />
Soon, Michael began to shoot his load on the bed sheets as Fido whimpered in surprise. Ropes of cum soaked the bed, some of it getting onto Fido’s nose, which he licked off with his tongue. When Michael was done gripping every ounce of semen from his dick, he laid down on the bed. Fido moved his head down and proceeded to continue licking at the asshole stretched out before him.<br />
<br />
“Oh my God!” Michael exclaimed, as he panted in excitement, while squirming in ecstasy. “That felt incredible!”<br />
<br />
Fido growled as he nudged at Michael with his snout. <br />
<br />
“Oh right” Michael answered back as he struggled to get back onto his hands and knees. “You haven’t gotten your rocks off yet.”<br />
<br />
Fido nodded as he hesitated for a moment.<br />
<br />
“Should I really be doing this?” Freddy thought to himself. “Although I think this is as loose as he’s going to get, I’m still worried about hurting him. Maybe I should just lick myself off to orgasm instead.”<br />
<br />
Before Fido could leave to hop off the bed to go pleasure himself, Michael called out to him.<br />
<br />
“Fuck me, Freddy! Make me your bitch! Breed me like that stray bitch in the park!”<br />
<br />
This did the trick as instinct took over and Fido steadied himself before hopping onto Michael’s back. He began to poke around, trying to find his hole, overly excited at the prospect of breeding his bitch. Sensing an issue, Michael reached his hand back to grab Fido’s flailing sheath with its exposed red dick. Michael managed to move it into position as Fido inserted itself into his waiting asshole.<br />
<br />
When contact was made, Michael let out a load groan as Fido began to jackhammer himself into him wildly with reckless abandon. Canine instinct completely took over as Freddy was temporarily gone. All that was there was Fido, gripping his front legs onto Michael’s flanks, his back legs holding him up steady as he pounded into his bitch back and forth at a rapid pace. <br />
<br />
Michael was already starting to feel a mix of sensations wash him as he yelled out and moaned in both pleasure and pain. Fido ignored this, determined to see his seed enter his bitch that he so longed to mate with. The sensation of fucking was driving him mad as lots of color popped into his monochrome vision. It felt better than that time he smoked marijuana with his friends. His panting became rapid as his tongue flapped about and into Michael’s ear. <br />
<br />
Michael could hear his lover panting behind him, as his felt his wet tongue slapping at his ear. He already had sprung another boner that jerked back and forth in time with Fido’s fucking motions. His moaning grew louder as Fido became more intense in his pounding, feeling himself on the verge of release. <br />
<br />
Fido began to feel his knot expand as he knew he was close. Michael felt this too and began to scream out in agony and horniness. Finally, at the apex of orgasm, Fido’s vision whited out as his dick began to contract and he shot huge loads of cum into the hole of his waiting lover. As Fido’s cum attacked Michael’s colon and prostate, Michael moaned loudly as he began to ejaculate a second time onto the bed, this time without touching himself. <br />
<br />
As Fido’s orgasm began to subside, he began to pant rapidly into Michael’s ear. Coming off of his own orgasm, Michael began to scream as the knot began to feel painful lodged into his asshole so tightly. <br />
<br />
“Ow!” Michael yelled loudly as he felt intense pain in his colon. “Freddy! This hurts! Get off of me!”<br />
<br />
Michael tried to get Fido to jump off, momentarily forgetting about a dog’s tie to his lover. As he tried to push him off in vain, Fido began to whimper and then growl as Michael was beginning to hurt him. Resigned to their situation, Michael briefly tried to compose himself before Fido finally hopped off of him and stood with his butt to him.<br />
<br />
“Ow!” Michael cried. “Stop moving, Freddy! It hurts! It hurts!!!!”<br />
<br />
Fido began to whine as Michael tried to stop Fido’s shifting and moving. Remembering they were now stuck like this for several minutes, Fido began to pant nervously as more cum oozed out of his dick and into Michael’s hole. Michael was livid as the pain continued to wash over him unabated. Despite his cries of agony, his boyfriend seemed to ignore them. Michael had hoped that Freddy, or rather Fido, hadn’t damaged something inside of him during their intense fucking session. He’d have to wait to find out. Until Freddy’s penis shrank and popped out, he wouldn’t know for sure. <br />
<br />
Michael didn’t have to wait long to find out as his long desired relief came about. Fido began to shift back into Freddy, with his fur receding into his skin rapidly and his features re-shifting back into his human ones. The last thing to change was his dog sheath as it turned into a flaccid, human penis. Seeing it plop out of Michael, Freddy collapsed onto the bed as Michael fell on the other end. <br />
<br />
The two laid down as they sought to catch their breath. Finally, after a moment, Freddy got up to look at Michael’s asshole. He could see some of his canine cum bubbling up as it leaked from his lover’s behind and onto his leg and the bed below. He smiled, knowing that he had finally bred his bitch. <br />
<br />
“Why am I thinking like that? Freddy thought to himself as he gently pet Michael’s leg to try to calm him down.<br />
<br />
Freddy could hear Michael sobbing as he tried to reassure his lover that everything was ok. After a moment, Freddy got up and went to look over Michael. Putting his hand to Michael’s face, Freddy quietly called to him. <br />
<br />
“Michael?” he asked. “Are you ok?”<br />
<br />
Michael looked up to him and said….</p>
