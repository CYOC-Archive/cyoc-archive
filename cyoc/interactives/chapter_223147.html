<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As soon as she came to, she couldn&#39;t even begin to get her bearings, as there was nothing for her see. Nothing but excruciating amounts of sensory input, sights, smells, but no sound, curiously.<br />
She turns around, and she felt skin slapping on skin, and unknown parts of her body scream in pain at the new pressure, as she probably sat on some of them.<br />
Just what has her body turned into?<br />
She tried to &quot;open&quot; her &quot;eyes&quot;, but there were no eyes to open, not even her new clitoral eyelid. Ah, but she could feel something similar to the latter, and she focused on it, ignoring everything else...<br />
Well, at least her legs haven&#39;t changed... much. Michelle observed her new green-greyish legs, her skin covered with some form of camouflage, which seemed to ripple and subtly change as she watched it.<br />
She then realised she wasn&#39;t seeing just a flattened view of her legs anymore, but a three-dimensional depth. Her previous pussy-vision could only give vague distances, the limitations of a single &quot;eye&quot;, but here it seems she has more...<br />
She tried to look &quot;inside&quot;, but immediately backed off as a fragmented mess of tunnels and areas confused and overwhelmed her. It was like watching all cameras in a CCTV room, but without any idea of the overall infrastructure of the building she&#39;d be &quot;watching&quot;.<br />
Arms? Yes, ...no, she could feel something else pulling along, did she have more arms? Okay, let&#39;s not try that one yet.<br />
Mouth? ...also too complicated for now, she could vocalise, but it feels like she&#39;s harmonising with something, herself?<br />
Legs? Functioning normally, it seems, as if her Pussy Vision Deluxe is any indication.<br />
She could still feel the outside world bombarding her with light, and touches, and senses, and more and more smells.<br />
She tried to sit up, but to her horror she then realises she has no sense of balance anymore, seeing her body flop over on the forest floor. She had no warning that she had just fallen over, were it not for her vision, and a dozen more things going &quot;ow&quot; as she dumped herself on top of.<br />
She spread her legs, and tried to establish an horizon to sit up with. It went pretty poorly, as every time she tried sitting on her bum, she could feel... <I>something</I>, hurting a lot, poking into her tailbone.<br />
She then gets distracted from this new revelation with another, as she spotted her feet, which have turned into hoofs. Well, not quite, she saw a thin &quot;heel&quot; strut out the back of her raised feet, the tip of her &quot;heel&quot; being on the same level as her &quot;hoofs&quot;, making it almost look like she was walking on horseshoe heels.<br />
Michelle spends a minute or so trying to move the &quot;shoe&quot; and the &quot;heel&quot;, eventually succeeding, oddly perplexed by seeing her move her new bodyparts this way.<br />
Something moved in the bushes next to her, and yet she didn&#39;t feel the need to turn her head, as she was already looking at that bush. Wait, what?<br />
Taking a moment to &quot;look&quot; at herself, she realised she was now sitting up, relatively uncomfortably, angling her tailbone away from the ground, which was now a... tail?<br />
No, it was a <I>snake</I> tail, she realised, as it slowly came into view of her pussy vision.<br />
She could see it, entirely black, she wouldn&#39;t even know it was a snake if she hadn&#39;t seen the tongue emerge from its mouth, tasting the air, tasting herself.<br />
Smelling her own arousal made her horny, and she secreted some fluids on the inside and outside of her pussy, which she felt the instinctive need to clean up, to lick dry.<br />
And so she did, feeling a familiar-yet alien sensation of her tongue filling her pussy, reaching out.<br />
Michelle then quickly realised several things in succession.<br />
She realised she had no longer a clit. Not because it was gone, but because she no longer needed it, because her lips had become just as sensitive.<br />
She then also realised that her tail was able to watch her, from the outside, showing a grey-darkened pussy, a gaping black hole, from which a dark-purple tongue emerged, cleaning her moisture in one circle-sweeping lick.<br />
She felt like moaning, but she didn&#39;t think she had anything to moan with. Or anything to hear with. She felt for that tongue, and pulled it out one more time.<br />
And almost licked the head of the snake.<br />
Ah, it has become a tiny bit longer, it seems.<br />
Michelle then also took the opportunity to open the snake&#39;s mouth, it seemed she could also &quot;see&quot; very well with the tongue itself.<br />
All of this added to her ongoing awe and appall, but she couldn&#39;t help but go on, and reach out, taste it.<br />
Yup, that&#39;s a pussy.<br />
She has a snake-tail that has a pussy inside, and she has a vagina that has a long tongue inside, and is able to see with its vaginal lips.<br />
She then retracted her tongue, and commanded the gaping pussy shut. But then Michelle kept &quot;staring&quot;, as additional folds of skin kept creeping over her crotch, making it almost entirely invisible.<br />
Right, and her pussy can camouflage itself too.<br />
She mentally sighed, and used her tail to see further up her body, and almost wishes she hadn&#39;t, seeing how much she had changed.<br />
The first thing she saw was that her head was gone. It wasn&#39;t damaged, it was just plain <I>gone</I>, there was a gash where her neck once was.<br />
The second thing she saw was that she had multiple arms, four, one of which was supporting her weight on the floor, while two more were hiding her breasts, and the last one was hovering a finger around the area her lips would occupy if she had a head still, an old habit of hers.<br />
She saw that all over her body, black tattoos spread out, interlacing her now-mossy-green skin with a fractal pattern.<br />
Her hands also had &quot;gloves&quot;, entirely black, almost-glossy ones. She used a hand to grip and rub fingers against its own palm, and realised this wasn&#39;t a glove, this was skin.<br />
She realised then that she was still seeing her snake. How? She had hidden her pussy, and she had also risen the tail-head, so how...?<br />
She then realised that the black &quot;tattoos&quot; all over her body were suspiciously familiar, and after some bit of coordinating, by moved her one free hand to behind her snake-tail, she realised she could see through then, watching the back of her snake-tail.<br />
So anything that&#39;s blackened on her body, she was now seeing through? Was this the immense amount of light she experienced earlier?<br />
This light was lessening, if only because now she was experiencing the outside world more abstractly, she could &quot;focus&quot; on any single item, a tree, a nut, a blade of grass, and wherever she was, however she turned, she could still &quot;see&quot; it, as long as some blackened part of her was exposed to it.<br />
Insect eyes, incredibly overpowered...<br />
She looked &quot;inside&quot;, and even though she had completely hidden her vagina, there was still some light to &quot;see&quot; through. Maybe her own infrared warmth?<br />
She felt for her tongue again, which now saw a &quot;sack&quot; that it was hidden in, on the &quot;under&quot; side of her vagina. She felt it emerging and filling her tunnel.<br />
Michelle could see the backside of that tunnel, what if...<br />
She poked her tongue inside, and felt it slide along a rather strong, sensitive muscle, forming itself into a tube-like structure.<br />
Michelle could also now &quot;see&quot; another &quot;camera&quot; show her tongue. Maybe she could explore herself like this, and find every nook and cranny of those &quot;cameras&quot;?<br />
Feeling for the muscle she just hit, she felt a lot of strange churning in the lower part of her abdomen. Not her womb, as that seemed often to be the thing churning, but something right below it.<br />
She kept looking and feeling, and was curiously drawn at how every single time she &quot;poked&quot; it, it would churn, and then she felt a part of her relax. Ring muscles, which she then expanded and contracted, to see them on the &quot;camera&quot;. She then kept on churning, absentmindedly, seeing how every time, a different set of muscles was relaxed, how many of them had she?<br />
The vagina her tongue was in was just a pouch now, the ring-muscle was &quot;locked&quot;, for a better sense of the word, and she could not &quot;unlock&quot; it by herself, her abdomen controlling it, seemingly, by reflex.<br />
She still wanted to speed this up, and poked the ring muscle with her tongue. She could maybe churn until she had a pair of muscles involving her vagina, unless... ah, she could have just opened a path to it in the first place.<br />
Her tongue spilled in the tight in between-space, the tight tunnel from one ring-muscle, to another. She pushed through the other muscle, and then more and more, and... wait, where is it going?<br />
The pain on her tailbone flared for a moment, as she felt her tongue go around a very tight corner, squeezing itself before then spilling into a tight tunnel. She saw a bulge travelling up her tail, and meet her opening. She didn&#39;t know her tongue was this long, but it had stretched itself to a limit. She could now &quot;see&quot; its tip poking from the entrance, together with the snake-head&#39;s own tongue.<br />
Alright, so it looked like she could connect her internal tubes however she wished. Sounds pretty useful, but how many of them does she have?<br />
Michelle realises this internal exploration might take a while, she so she tried to multitask a little, continuing her external exploration first.<br />
She held the tail up to her breasts, while her tongue explored another internal tube, which looked like a holding pouch.<br />
Her breasts didn&#39;t look different at first, but only when she removed her hands from her nipples, did she realise how much they had changed.<br />
She had lips on her nipples now, and she could <I>move</I> them. She saw how they licked their lips in unison, and then open up. Not gaping, singing, she saw tongues inside sing a lullaby she was trying to hear, but she couldn&#39;t hear anything.<br />
She then kept experimenting, separating the pairs, and at a silly thought, using them to vocalise a horny couple. After a few moments, she felt her abdomen churning again, tingling the entirety of her skin, piercing her non-existent skull with a loud tinnitus.<br />
When that settled, she realised she could <I>hear</I> herself now, but instead of any ears, she was fairly certain her skin was doing the job now.<br />
And that job they did, she heard herself, two of herself, a high-pitched womanly voice, and a low-pitched... manly voice?<br />
&quot;Oh my god, oh my god! I&#39;m gonna cum, huff, huff, please make me cum!&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh yeah baby, oh yeah, you wanna cum, hmm, you wanna cu-&quot;<br />
She shut herself up, cringing, she wasn&#39;t even really conscious of how she sounded, until she heard herself. Michelle felt that her mouthes could &quot;run their course&quot; fairly easily, maybe even coordinate something. She tested the range, and she seemed she could sound whatever she wanted like.<br />
She decided to put this to the test, by voicing &quot;Who&#39;s on first&quot;, with her own breasts.<br />
After a moment she realised that yup, she could definitely do two different manly voices very convincingly.<br />
&quot;Staring&quot; for a few moments, her tongue then found the <I>third</I> internal pouch, or the same one, she wasn&#39;t sure. She then continued her external exploration by raising her tail to her shoulders, which showed... another pussy.<br />
She mentally sighed, how many does she have by now? Three?<br />
Michelle let the &quot;nose&quot; of her tailsnake bump it, and she then felt for the sensation, seeing it gape open a moment later.<br />
However, she then has a revelation, as she sees a tunnel suddenly receive light, and she&#39;s fairly sure she knows the &quot;configuration&quot; to &quot;reach&quot; that tunnel.<br />
A churning later, and her purple-ish tail peeks from this new hole, licking it masterfully as it has its counterpart below.<br />
She couldn&#39;t hide this pussy, it seems, but it also didn&#39;t look all that impressive, being just a slit.<br />
Michelle then explored her body further, standing up to provide her tail a full degree of motion around her. Her sense of balance was still gone, but it was brought back with a 360 degree vision &quot;lock&quot; on her horizon at any time.<br />
Standing up, her changes were a bit more prominently displayed. She had an extremely wide thigh-gap, easily able to put a flattened hand between, and not touch her inner thighs.<br />
Michelle also had vents on the back of her torso, which softly breathed in and out. She guessed this is where her new breathing equipment went to, able to convert into gills if required, with her &quot;nose&quot; now being this snake-tail&#39;s tongue.<br />
Meanwhile, internally, she discovered more and more; she found a &quot;pouch&quot; full of her old tentacles, able to be extended out and used to be &quot;plumbed&quot; to any hole, if desired.<br />
She also realised that she could &quot;plumb&quot; two connections together at once, independently.<br />
This, together with her tentacles, made the exploration session much quicker.<br />
She then found a cylindrical vagina-like pouch, showing a ring muscle at the back, going to her old womb. She realised this is her old &quot;kill and digest&quot; chamber from before she changed, undoubtedly upgraded.<br />
She found a pouch that didn&#39;t look like much, except for the small holes riddled along. She flexed, and realised that this is where her pheromone glands went to, <I>all</I> of them, to be released through a single hole.<br />
Her lipples could swallow too, and she found the connection for that.<br />
The last chamber she found was one that frightened her; a few long stinger-tentacles, coiled up and ready to be unleashed from any of her holes, with undoubtedly potent venom inside.<br />
Absentmindedly, musing about her changes, she had started eating rocks with her tail, plumbing them to her kill-chamber, shaving off the edges until they became smooth rocks, and then letting them fall in one of her pouches. It was soothing, and satisfying, and helped distract her from her changes.<br />
Concurrently, she kept licking her lower lips, while fingering her upper ones. She added on, letting her breasts speak and moan as if two lesbians were going down on eachother, all concurrently, pushing her new abilities to the limits.<br />
She came, and she was relieved as she did not squirt fluids anymore at this, making her orgasm just a bump in the road of pleasure.<br />
She came again, and again, and again, while she walked, while she ran, leaped, her vagina never stopping self-pleasuring, her hand never stopping to finger herself, while the others were used to vault over objects in her way, her breast not stopping moaning and screaming, scaring away animals in her wake, her tail never stopping trying to find a &quot;good rock&quot;, picking up a few crunchy biological ones on the way.<br />
Then, as she felt her pouches become heavy, and her abdomen churning its new food, she stopped running. She didn&#39;t know what time it was, but again, she became lost in her body.<br />
Michelle was sure she could focus fully on self-pleasuring for a month straight, while her body would feed itself along the way, whether realised it consciously or not.<br />
She then laid against a tree, taking in her new body, her new abilities, and finally relaxed for a moment, bemused at her changes.</p>
