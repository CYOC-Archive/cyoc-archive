<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Hey Medit and all others,<br/>
I hope you all enjoy my chapters, especially Medit!<br/>
I also hope I am not destroying your story...<br/>
Looking forward to what you come up with next.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While giving yourself some time to think, you look around and notices that the decision is not that easy as you thought it would be. You see two kids, a boy and a girl, not older than maybe eight or nine, playing with the garden sprinkler. Both kids were naked, at first the thought of how wrong it was of their parents to let their kids play in the garden in the nude all by themselves comes to your mind, but then you realize that the hedge surrounding the garden is pretty high and thick, so no passersby would notice the naked children.<br />
<br />
In a second, much larger garden, you notice a group of four teenage boys between the ages of 16 and 18, riding their skateboards in the large and empty pool. The thought of having one of the boys become water to fill the pool, while one other boy becomes an inflatable animal float or cause his body parts to become various types of pool toys and the other two boys become beach or pool chairs seems to feel exciting.<br />
<br />
The sound of barking draws your attention to a third garden, where a man is playing fetch with his Labrador Retriever. You know the neighbour well, he loves his dog Max over everything else, at sometimes you get the feeling that the man loves his dog more than his wife. If that is the case, why not give him what he wants, by transforming him into Max&#39;s bitch?<br />
<br />
Your ears twitch as you hear the squeaking of wheels, when you turn your head you spot the mailman, pushing his cart filled with the daily mail. You remember that some new folks have moved in to the house down the road a couple weeks ago. They still are settling in and have not seem to be able to get themselves a mailbox, it would be wrong for the mailman to just dump the mail on the ground or porch, someone might steal the mail. The thought of having the mailman become a mailbox, until the new family would get a mailbox of their own, pops into your mind, not thinking about the consequences. When the new neighbours notice the mailbox, they probably won&#39;t consider buying a mailbox.<br />
<br />
You notice your tiny head start to hurt from all the thinking, when you smell something, you sniff the air, causing your tiny black nose to twitch. Turning your head you spot your neighbour Charles in his back yard in front of his coal grill. Your mouth starts to water when the image of a nice juicy steak pops into your mind, but you notice something which causes you to tilt your head: Charles does not seem to have grill tongs and uses his hands to turn over the meat and veggies on the grill.<br />
<br />
You then hear giggling and turn your head, noticing two women sunbathing on the lawn of a house, their skin a dark brown color, you can&#39;t help but give a Raccoon smirk and chuckle as you think that, if they&#39;d stay in the sun much longer, that they&#39;d soon look like dried fish. You don&#39;t notice as you lick your lips, your Raccoon part seems to crave for a nice juicy Koi.<br />
<br />
You then feel a something poke your side, causing you to let out a squeak and turn around, you find yourself staring into Keith&#39;s grinning Raccoon face. “Hurry up and decide,” he chitters, “we don&#39;t have all day.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, yeah,” you say, you even pout a little, which makes you look even more cuter, “it is not an easy decision.”<br />
<br />
Keith chuckles, “poor wittwe waccoon,” he teases, causing you to give him the “evil eye”. Keith laughs, “oh come on, Jared,” he says, “just tell me who we should test the keys on.”<br />
<br />
You let out a sigh and turn around to look once again at the options, running the ideas which you got for each “test subject” through your tiny mind once again. You finally manage to decide, you turn back to Keith and say, “there are these four teenage boys in that big garden. They are currently using the empty pool as a skateboard ramp,” pointing your tiny Raccoon finger towards the garden you are talking about.<br />
<br />
Keith nods as he looks over to where you are pointing your tiny Raccoon finger, “so, what have you thought off doing to them,” he asks.<br />
<br />
You look at Keith, “um… something… kinda crazy.”<br />
<br />
Keith raises an eyebrow, “oh? What kind of “crazy” are you talking about?”<br />
<br />
You hesitate a little before answering, “well… one boy could become water to fill the pool, another could become various types of pool toys and the last two could become pool chairs.”<br />
<br />
Keith tilts his head, “where do you get those crazy ideas,” he asks.<br />
<br />
“I… I don’t know,” you say quietly, looking away.<br />
<br />
“And here I thought, after transforming me into a fire hydrant and leaving me being pissed on by dogs for a week, you’d think of something less… let’s say… crazy.”<br />
<br />
You blush under your fur, and stay quiet for a while before you burst out, “I knooooow,” you then cover your face with your paws, “wh-what is wrong with me,” you ask as you begin to sob.<br />
<br />
“Jared…,” Keith starts, but you continue, even starting to pull hard at your head fur.<br />
<br />
“I should be locked up in an Lunatic Asylum,” you cry, “only psychos have such thoughts… I am nothing but a psycho… I… .”<br />
<br />
“JARED,” Keith yells and slaps you hard across your face, you blink and reach up a paw to the area your friend slapped you. You look at Keith with a mixed expression of “what the hell,” and confusion. Keith lets out a sigh, “look Jared,” he says, “you are not a psycho, I may still be a little pissed about the whole hydrant thing.”<br />
<br />
“So why not use the keys on me instead,” you ask, “I am the one you should take revenge on and not… .”<br />
<br />
“Jared, let me finish,” Keith interrupts you, “you made a mistake, you said you are sorry and I KNOW you did not do it on purpose. I am not someone who holds a grudge against someone, especially against my best pal since Kindergarten.”<br />
<br />
You turn your head when hearing this and you find yourself staring at the smiling muzzle of your friend, “y-you mean it?”<br />
<br />
Keith nods, he then gives you a huge and long hug, “I do,” he whispers into your ear. He lets go of you and takes your hands… paws into his while booping his black Raccoon nose against yours, “now, let’s go and have some fun with the keys. We do need to still learn how to use them, and as I said, better test them out on random people than on ourselves.”<br />
<br />
“Um… haven’t you transformed us into Raccoons earlier?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah… but only to be able to hide in plain sight while testing the keys out on other people,” Keith says, “now, come, let’s do this. By the way, I kinda like the idea,” he adds with a smirk.<br />
<br />
Seeing the smirk on Keith’s face makes you gulp, for some reason you suddenly have a bad feeling that something is very wrong. As you follow Keith down the tree, across the road and towards the garden, where the teens are playing, you can’t shake the feeling that it seems, the more a person uses the keys, the power of them seems to corrupt the user. This thought terrifies you, but since it’s just an assumption, you decide to not tell Keith, you can stop him and take the keys if it should get out of hand.<br />
<br />
Both of you arrive at the garden and hide under the hedge surrounding it, for a while you watch the teens continue to play. You hear them laughing and whooping each time one of them does a trick or funny move on the skateboards. You then notice Keith aiming the keys at the group and press the button.<br />
<br />
Keith first zaps the three boys, who are standing by the pool’s edge, watching their friend showing off his skills, he then aims the key at the other boy and again presses the button.<br />
<br />
The boy, who has short black hair and an athletic body, has just jumped into the air on his board, when suddenly he just seems to freeze, floating on the spot right above the empty pool. His board falls into the pool and you both hear it clatter as it hits the floor of the pool. “WHAT THE HELL,” you hear the boys yell in unison.<br />
<br />
“Dude, since when can you fly for real,” on boy with spikey blond hair asks.<br />
<br />
“Bro, I think I smoked the wrong weed today,” another boy, who has brown chin length hair says, “I am tripping.”<br />
<br />
“Crazy dream,” the third boy who has smooth blond hair says.<br />
<br />
“SERIOUSLY GUYS,” the boy, floating on the spot, asks loudly, “QUIT STARING AND TALKING BS AND GET ME TH FUCK DOWN,” he then shouts.<br />
<br />
The three boys let out a chuckle, but suddenly their expressions become confused, “um… I can’t move,” one boy says.<br />
<br />
“Neither can I,” the other two say.<br />
<br />
“YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING ME,” the boy, dangling in the air says.<br />
<br />
“Um… we are not kidding,” one boy says.<br />
<br />
“Dude, what the hell is going on,” one other asks.<br />
<br />
The others stay silent, none of them seeming to come up with an explanation, you and Keith are both laughing quietly under your hedge, “their faces and reactions are priceless,” you say.<br />
<br />
Keith nods and grins, “and the fun isn’t over yet,” he says as he aims the key at the boy who is dangling in the air.<br />
<br />
You can’t help but notice the excitement in your friend’s voice, to you he sounds as if he were giddy of what he is about to do to the boys. ‘What if he is already slipped to far,’ you ask yourself, ‘what if the keys have already corrupted him,’ but you then think it is simply your nervousness of the power of the keys. You also tell yourself that you both still don’t know enough about the keys, its power and limits, unaware that Keith has already figured out how the keys work and that he is starting to succumb to the power of the keys.<br />
<br />
The way the keys work is for the user to think of or imagine what the target should become, the keys will do the rest. Before pressing down on the button, Keith looks at you out of the corner of his eye, ‘if only he knew that I figured the keys out already,’ he thinks to himself, ‘he’d try to stop me from using them. THAT will never happen though, these keys are to cool to give up, besides they make me feel so powerful, and I love it,’ he then pushes down on the button.<br />
<br />
The boy&#39;s body suddenly illuminates and glows in a bright white light, “WH-WHAT... IS... GLUB... HAPPENING,” you hear the boy yell, “I... GLUB... FEEL... GLUB... WEIRD!”<br />
<br />
You and Keith both watch as the glowing body of the boy starts to warp and morph, changing size and appearance. The boy&#39;s yells soon die down and you can hear what sounds like rushing water coming from the light in the sky as it continues to expand. Soon the glowing stops and you see a huge amount of water floating right above the pool, before it falls into the pool with a loud splash, some of the water even splashing outside of the pool and soaking the other three boys.<br />
<br />
“JAKE,” they yell, “WHAT THE HELL,” but there is no answer.<br />
<br />
“Did Jake just turn into freaking water,” one boy asks, “impossible!”<br />
<br />
“Dude,” another says, “what the fuck is going on?”<br />
<br />
“Man, what a trip,” the third boy simply says.<br />
<br />
“Well, that worked,” Keith says, he then turns to you, “next up the chairs or toys?”<br />
<br />
“Um... I forgot to ask...,” you say, “are we going to change them back?”<br />
<br />
Keith rolls his eyes, “dude, remember, we still are not sure how the keys work,” he lies, “that is why we have to continue to test them. As soon as we figured them out, we&#39;ll transform everyone, who we transformed, back to normal.”<br />
<br />
“Okay,” you say, “because I want to be back to normal soon, I have work tomorrow.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, yeah,” Keith says, “don&#39;t worry,” you are unaware that Keith plans to not transform back so soon. He enjoys being a Raccoon, a mischievous one at that, &#39;I need to think of something to make him stop ruining the fun,&#39; he thinks to himself.<br />
<br />
“Okay, I decided,” you say, unaware of your friend&#39;s train of thought, “the toys should be next.”<br />
<br />
Keith nods and aims the keys at one of the other boys, who stand there terrified, and pushes down on the button.<br />
<br />
Suddenly one of the boy&#39;s body falls apart, his clothes seemingly to vaporize, and tumbling to the ground, his head bouncing, but seemingly not being harmed, a few times, “WHAT THE...,” all of them yell.<br />
<br />
“Hey man, you okay,” one boy asks.<br />
<br />
The boy&#39;s head scowls up at his friend, “do I LOOK okay?!”<br />
<br />
The others don&#39;t say a word, “now I feel weird,” the boy says, you watch as his head suddenly seems to bloat, “what the fuck! This is fucked up! I... MMMMH,” his mouth suddenly vanishes, as do his ears and eyes. The boy&#39;s hair falls out and you notice that his head becomes transparent becoming the thin poly-vinyl chloride resin material, which beach balls are made of. The boy&#39;s nose transforms into the valve, then you watch as blue and white stripes appear on the “ball”.<br />
<br />
“Woah,” one of the boy&#39;s friends says, “his head has become a beach ball.”<br />
<br />
You continue to watch, with a emotional mixture of amazement and horror, the body parts transforming.<br />
<br />
One of the boy&#39;s legs and arms lengthen, the foot and the hand falling off, as the leg and arm become pool noodles, a pink one (leg) and a turquoise one (arm). The hand and foot morph into bathing caps, while the other leg and arm become two towels, the hand and foot both become blue speedos. The boy&#39;s torso is the last to change, it grows wider and longer, riffles appear as the boy&#39;s dick becomes a valve, soon a pink float is lying next to the pool.<br />
<br />
Keith grins wickedly, “next, the chairs,” he says and without hesitation presses the button. The last two boys yell as their clothes too vaporize and their bodies bend painfully backwards, their bones cracking in their bodies as they rearrange themselves. Their legs and arms merge with the feet and hands, taking on the shape of chair legs. Their cocks vanish as their bodies and heads widen, becoming the seats and head rests of the chairs. Their skin changes color from white to a nice sky blue nylon cloth, while the “legs” turn into white plastic.<br />
<br />
You and Keith both stare at what has happened, you turn to Keith, “man, those last transformations sounded painful,” you say, “I kind of feel bad about it.”<br />
<br />
“It just sounded painful,” Keith simply says, shrugging, “let&#39;s find some more people to use as guinea pigs,” and without waiting for a reply, he starts to scurry off. After hesitating you let out a sigh, &#39;I can&#39;t let him out of my sight,&#39; you think to yourself before scurrying after him.</p>
