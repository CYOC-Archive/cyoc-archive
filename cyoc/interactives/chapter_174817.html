<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Well what type of cut are you looking for?” Sarge asked. <br />
<br />
The twins looked at each other for a second and the one of the right said, “Well, we’ve always kind of wanted to have flattops. We love the movie Top Gun, so maybe one like Ice Man.” <br />
<br />
“Yeah. Or maybe a bit shorter of a flattop that that, at least for me. I want it to be shaved on the sides, just like my big bro,” the one on the left said.<br />
<br />
That was close enough to horseshoe flattop to decide it for Sarge. <br />
<br />
“Well let’s get started on you first,” he said to the twin on the left—Mark, “Maybe when we get your sharp flattop with the shaved sides, we’ll convince your twin to match you in hair as well as looks.” <br />
<br />
“Works for me, Sir.”<br />
<br />
“Actually, Sarge. I’ll take the same shorter flattop as my brother here. Might as well stay matching. If that’s OK with you.” <br />
<br />
Sarge, smiled. They already were so much more polite than they started out with. “Of course, no problem whatsoever.” <br />
<br />
Sarge quickly caped up the twin—Mark— and got to work. He took an Oster clippers with no guard and went to work attacking the sides of his head all the way up to the crown. Bit by glorious bit he sheared down the sides of his head until there was just a fine stubble. <br />
<br />
As Sarge began to seriously shorten the top of Marks head with scissors, little did Will, the other of the twins, realize that as he sat in the other chair, as his twins hair was cut, his was being cut, snip-by-snip and cut by cut in exactly the same way. It was as if an invisible Sarge was cutting Will’s hair perfectly in sync. And of course, Sarge ensured Will wouldn’t think anything amiss. Now both Will and Mark’s hair was totally shorn on the back and sides and only about an inch remained on top. <br />
<br />
Sarge then crouched down to put the line of his eyesight perpendicular to the top of Mark’s head. He then grabbed the guardless Osters and very carefully sheared a severe landing strip to give a horseshoe shape to the flattop. <br />
<br />
Now with the hard part done, Sarge then took the flattop comb out to perfect the look. Cutting the front of the flattop to a ½ inch length, with the back blending out until nothing. Lastly, Sarge got a shaving cream into a nice lather and coating the entire sides and back of Mark’s head with shaving cream. And he carefully applied the lather to the landing strip, without getting it on the hair itself. <br />
<br />
He then took out a straight razor, attaching a fresh blade, and sliding it against the razor strop attached to the mirror and then went to town carefully shaving the back, sides, and landing strip to a perfect smoothness. He then grabbed a big fluffy brush, and wiped all the excess hair stuck to the back of his neck. Lastly, he used a comb and some butch wax to make the very short haircut stand perfectly at attention. Using some of his magic touch, he made sure that both Mark’s and Will’s, identical, flattops would always be kept impeccably rigid like this. No matter what they did, they would always look this immaculate. They would wake up from sleeping and from morning til morning not a hair would be messed up. That was his gift to the two boys. Once everything was perfectly styled Sarge beamed at the two boys, the haircuts were a total beauty, and they screamed military. No civilian would have a cut so intense. <br />
<br />
Sarge had been engrossed in the cut, he just had reminded himself that he still needed to carry out the rest of his plan for the boys, or really young men now. As he uncapped Mark, Mark reached up to feel the smooth back of the scalp and commented, “wow, Sarge, you outdid yourself. It feels as if I’ve never had hair back there ever.” <br />
<br />
“What can I say, I just have them magic touch,” Sarge joked. Though the joke rang of the truth as well. <br />
<br />
Sarge then directed the twins to get out of the chair and stand up so he could get a good look at them. <br />
<br />
“Parade rest!” Sarge commanded. The twins immediately stood erect, with their hands clasped behind their backs. <br />
<br />
Though he had already changed the two slackers into some well-muscled twins. They still were wearing the trashy clothes they had walked in with. Well not for any longer. First, their white ankle socks changed to black. They slowly began to crawl up until they reached mid-calf where they began to thin out and change to a more sheer fabric of a dress sock. Their sneakers began to change fabric to a leather and began to darken to black finally converting to a standard black military issue dress shoe, polished to a beautiful mirror shine. For good measure Sarge added metal taps to the bottom of the shoes to ensure everyone could hear the perfect precision they would be marching at.  <br />
<br />
Their shorts began to lengthen until the bottom of the now pant reached the top of the heel. The baggy nature of the “shorts” then began to change as the now pants began to tighten around the crotch area until they became more classically tailored pant. They began to change color from bright orange and navy blue to a restrained and uniform khaki. Lastly the fabric changed so that the end result was a impeccably tailored and starched pair of khaki pants. Next their T shirts began to split down the middle. The fabric changed to become that of a starched, but slightly rough on the skin dress shirt with short sleeves. On the split shirt khaki buttons began to form and holes for the buttons open on the other side of the split and the buttons smartly buttoned themselves correctly. The short sleeve dress shirt then changed to an identical shade of khaki.  The lose canvas belts they previously were wearing changed to a more military webbing canvas and turned black with a brass belt clasp with some engraving. The newly formed short sleeve dress shirt then tucked itself into his pants and the belt tightened and aligned itself perfectly to be square. Lastly a neat khaki garrison cap formed, and smartly inserted itself through the belt to be held. <br />
<br />
Now that the physical transformation was complete, he stared proudly at what he had done. He had taken to long haired skater teens, and made them into respectable young men. They both looked perfectly identical now—identical horseshoe flattop, identical uniform, identical faces, identical height, identical musculature. But now he needed to lay out their lives in front of them before he could send them out into the world. <br />
<br />
“Atten-hut Cadets.” The two twins snapped to attention. “You two, are starting your Sophomore year at Texas A&M university in the Corps of Cadets. You are both in Naval ROTC as marine option cadets with plans to go to pilot school and be USMC pilots after you complete your officer training.” <br />
<br />
As he said that, some patches began to populate the shirt indicating their company in the Corps of Cadets at Texas A&M and their participating in Naval ROTC. Also, a name plate with their last name “Sargent”, which Sarge though would be slightly amusing, appeared over their right breast. As this happened, Sarge continued to think on his feet. He thought these two deserved a choice. Maybe he was just in a good mood that his twin idea worked out so fantastically. <br />
<br />
“However, as sophomores you have one more year before you have to officially commit to being a USMC officer. So at the end of your sophomore year I want you to come back and find me. If you both decide to continue with your dream of being Marine Pilots then I will continue to freshen up your beautiful flattops. But if you both decide that marine pilots aren’t what you want, then we will work together to decide what path, and haircut, you both should have moving forward. But if you both don’t agree, than you both will have to stick with the pilot path. I will not break you set up. Than understand?!”<br />
<br />
“Sir, yes, sir” they both replied smartly. <br />
<br />
“Good. Now cadets, dismissed!” Sarge ordered. Sarge also ensured through his mental conditioning that they would try their hardest throughout the year and be truly engaged in the Corps and to do well in school, but he did not force the military mindset so thoroughly on the two twins, especially compared to their older brother DI or their former friend who had entered before. Enough military bearing to be a cadet, but not too much wear it will be all they could choose. He thought that was immensely fair—maybe even a little soft, but he could always fix that in a year as well when the twins returned. <br />
<br />
The two cadets did a smooth about-face and began to march smartly towards the door, with perfect posture. You could hear the smart clicking of the metal taps Sarge had put on their shoes on the tile floor. Their brother the DI then stand up smartly and, marching in step, led the twins on their way out of the shop. <br />
<br />
The last thing Sarge saw was the twins careful pull their garrison caps from their belts and place them on their heads. You couldn’t see a single sign of hair at all when the cap was one—they could have been completely bald for all anyone knew. The DI also smartly put on his campaign cover, which also erased any sign of hair from his head. The trio of new brothers smartly marched past Sarge’s window and that is all he saw of them for a while.</p>
