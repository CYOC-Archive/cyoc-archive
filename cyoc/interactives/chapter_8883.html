<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The night had passed once again.  Dustin was stuck in bed with his 98 inch dick, but it didn't seem to bother him.  Breakfast was quick, and Peter and Ty were off to school.  The day shaped up to be ordinary, other than the fact that almost every guy in school had a huge bulge going on.  Peter guessed the average to be 15 inches.<br />
<br />
  The afternoon came once again, but not after Peter's fair share of body contact.  By the time the swim practice rolled by, he was keeping pace with the school at 13 inches.  The locker room was stale and moldy, but it wasn't different than any other locker room, other than the fact that every guy in it had to be at least 16 inches.  Peter forced his dick into his speedos, then chuckled at how weird the bulge looked.  A slight pat on the back startled him as he felt his dick swell another inch.<br />
<br />
  Steve stood there smiling again.  &quot;Glad to see you could make it!&quot; he said with a congenial grin.  Peter nodded slightly, catching a glimpse of  Steve's bulge as well.  His was HUGE, the speedos were barely containing it!  Peter thought that it had to be 18 inches.  &quot;And I'm glad to be here.... so do we start?&quot;<br />
<br />
----------------------------<br />
<br />
  Peter stood among the swim team at the edge of the pool.  The guys were psyching each other up, Steve of course patting everyone on the back.  His little 'session had taken a toll on everyone, along with each of the 4 other guys coming in contact with one another.  Steve stood with a glaring 24 inch bulge forcing his fabric, and most of the other guys were in their low twenties as well.  Peter had caught up in spades, now with 26 inches shoved down there. They had all been patting his back, probably because he was 'the new guy.'  Just as Steve got ready to jump in, the pool doors swung open.<br />
<br />
  A lean guy, probably around 5'11&quot;, 160 pounds sauntered in.  He looked pissed.  &quot;Don't even try it, fag!  You aren't the starter, I am!&quot;  Peter looked at the guy, obviously Steve's rival in more ways than swimming as his bulge was even bigger than Peters.  'Whoa, he must have been huge already..' Peter thought.  Steve looked a little annoyed &quot;Maybe if you were as fast on land as you are in water, you'd get here to start us.&quot;  A slight chuckle came from the group.  The guy was Allen, as Peter understood.  He was a champ for the school.<br />
<br />
  &quot;I swear, fag!  I'm not in the mood!&quot;  He shoved Steve into the pool, just adding to his cock again.  'That's not right.' Peter thought 'That's like giving this jerk a present for being such an ass!'  Allen laughed &quot;There you fuck!  You started!&quot;  His inane laughter was enough for Peter 'Oh no, that won't do.  Going to fix this situation.'  Peter made a silent command as Allen laughed at his own immaturity.  'Every time you and Steve race, you will lose.  If you get upset in any way, you'll lose 3 inches off your dick which will only stop at a quarter inch, and gain 5 pounds of fat. If you win and gloat, you'll automatically go to a quarter inch, and you'll gain 250 pounds.'  Steve suddenly sputtered &quot;You think you're tough huh?  Maybe I should be the starter!  Let's go!&quot;<br />
<br />
  Peter could barely hide his grin as the race started, both the boys cut through the water with astonishing speed.  Allen was out in front, flooring it down the row but he lost concentration and swallowed a lot of water.  He coughed as he got to the other edge after Steve.  He looked at Steve with a complete look of disgust.  He climbed out of the water, and made his next ingenious statement &quot;You got lucky, fag.&quot;  Peter grinned as he watched the 30 inch bulge of Allens speedo seemed to loosen a bit, and his defined abs slowly smoothed over a bit.  &quot;We're going again.&quot;<br />
<br />
  This wish was working out well on the next three passes.  Allen was too mad to win, and too proud to shut his mouth.  Peter took satisfaction in seeing Allens midsection swell, it was funny to Peter that he hadn't noticed yet it usually isn't hard to notice 20 pounds.  Steve had been congratulated over<br />
and over by the other guys, who must've hated Allen.  A 32 inch bulge was almost bursting from the fabric, Peter could hear it strain with every step that Steve took.<br />
  <br />
  Pass number four began.  180 pound Allen climbed into the pool, Steve did as well.  The two were psyched up, ready to go.  Allen seemed calmer now, which made Peter wonder about the outcome of the race.  They began.  Allen forced his way out front, he was clearing his way out from Steve, who seemed to be having trouble from his immense bulge.  The water splashed and swooshed as Allen brought his arms through, he had a gargantuan lead on Steve.  In what seemed to be an instant, Allen had won.  Steve climbed out of the water to accept his defeat.<br />
<br />
  Allen stood there, grinning.  He patted Steve on the shoulder, making the fabric of Steve's speedo cry once again.  He seemed like he was being nice about it until &quot;Ha!  I bet you thought you could win, fag!  Now that I have my concentration back, you can't touch me out there!&quot;  He pushed Steve back into the pool.  &quot;Just go home already.&quot;  His last words echoed in the room, then the other guys booed him, except for Peter who awaited the result.<br />
<br />
  Allen started to feel funny, or more specifically, his cock felt funny.  It had started out at 30 inches that afternoon, but over the meet had slowly crept back to 19, but to Allen's horror it began to shrink like a balloon letting out air.  15, 12, 10, 8, 6!  Allen's speedos looked baggy in the crotch as it fell to 4, then 2, then ultimately seemed to just dissappear.  He was freaking out, all the other guys were laughing as the pulled Steve out of the pool.  He compared his now 36 inch cock to Allen's non-existing one and began to laugh.<br />
<br />
  Peter's wish wasn't done yet.  Allen had finally located the small stomach he had accumulated during the race, but only because it had begun to swell.  His weight climbed to 195 in only an instant causing his panic to escalate.  He was swelling out at a crazy rate, his chest softened into curved boobs, his sides bunched with rolls, his ass grew into the speedos, tightening them once again.  His stomach forced out in fron of him in one burst, it stood against gravity for a moment at 225 pounds, but inevitably lost and creased down onto his groin with a loud wet slap.<br />
<br />
  The guys had stopped their laughter, and were enthralled by this event.  Peter was even able to spot a few 26 inch erections, and noticed Steve trying to hide his hardening cock as it pushed out of his speedos and climbed up his chest.  I erected itself, then fell downward from gravity forcing itself on it's 43 inches.  Allen was busy trying to keep himself from 'exploding', at 260 pounds, the speedos had become as tight as they did when he still had a 30 inch cock.  In a few more seconds Allen had surpassed 300 pounds.<br />
<br />
  He slipped on the wet tiles landing on his generous ass, his whole body jiggled like a jello mould.  He screamed out loud as his speedoes became unbearably tight, and then they burst.  His monstrous ass was free from it's confinements, it spead across the cold tile in only seconds.  He struggled to get up at 350 pounds, the whole swim team still caught in awe. Only an hour ago was Allen the thin, well endowed stereotypical swimmer, but now his was a mound of jiggling flesh and love handles, with almost nothing south at all.  He quickly passed 380 pounds, his huge stomach was nearly reaching his knees. His huge ass bounced as he waddled toward Steve, &quot;What did you do to me?!&quot; he cried.  Stumbling as his stomach draped down his thighs.  Steve backed away from 400 pound Allen &quot;Nothing, I swear I don't know what's happening to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
  His stomach touched his kneecaps in only a few seconds,  and then the growth stopped.  Allen stood in front of the swim team, round, unendowed, ashamed.  He waddled away almost in tears.</p>
