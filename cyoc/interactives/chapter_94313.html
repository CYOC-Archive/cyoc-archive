<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I stood nervously in the spot that Rager had made me stand in. I had spent much of my time privately thinking over some way to try and get even with the Lycothans for what they had done. My story was certainly an odd one. I had been picked up for petty theft as a teenager by a young police officer, likely just out of the academy. The officer, Brenda Teller, had at first taken a rather protective motherly interest in me and thus took it upon herself in being my parole/probation officer. For a while after things had been quiet, but I still saw her around and I did my best to turn my life around from there. I did odd jobs for her, ranging from house repairs, mowing her lawn, being a friend. Thankfully by that time my period of parole and probation was over, as it would have run the risk of ruining her career. In time I got a job with an organization that worked with my state&#39;s Department of Corrections as a sort of councilor to help teens like myself who had ended up on the wrong side of the law.<br />
<br />
It was from there that my relationship with Brenda began to go beyond officer and parolee or even between friends. She was beautiful and had seen more in me than most others, and once I was on the &quot;same team&quot; as it were, we&#39;d begun casual dating. I had thought things would go great and we&#39;d get a happy ever after, at which point the Lycothans invaded. I thankfully didn&#39;t get turned into a Thrall by the green mist, but the both of us ended up being captured and taken in some sort of flying bus, was the best way to describe it, to a prison on the outskirts of a relatively rural town. The last I had seen of &quot;Brenda&quot; had been just as we were lead through the gates where we promised to get out together, but that didn&#39;t last. <br />
<br />
We were separated into male and female wings of the prison and set on different paths. I and many of the male prisoners had been assigned to labor gangs that began dismantling the town that prison was built outside of and then planting new trees. The trees themselves looked sort of like spruce trees, but not quite. It was almost as if the trees themselves were alien to Earth, just as the Lycothans were. And as I, and several of the other male prisoners were being lead out for the first day of work, I&#39;d came across the sight that filled me with despair and rage. I saw Brenda, but only she wasn&#39;t Brenda. She was almost a foot taller than she was before, the sides of her head had been shaved, leaving top of her head covered in long black hair with a silver streak in it. She also wore a black loin cloth and tank top that fit tightly around her enlarged musculature that very much gave her the appearance of a body builder yet still athletic and feminine. They turned Brenda into a Warrior on her arrival and she didn&#39;t recognize me in the line of humans being lead out to work. From there I really hadn&#39;t seen her. The Lycothans did their best to keep males and females separate, even among their guards.<br />
<br />
From there, I simply began to think over ways to get even with them for all that they&#39;d done to me. Even as the work we had been assigned to do was completed and the few male prisoners that had been with me were drafted into their ranks. By now, there were few of us left in the male wing and the work outside the prison had largely run out. They now kept us inside and made to eat in ways that we found to be less than civilized. Though, it now seemed that it was his turn to be turned into one of them and the ways he had been thinking over how to get at them had come to nothing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Simplicity... yes,&quot; Rager snorted, &quot;but we&#39;d still be giving a fresh recruit a mate. You should know the rules the Alphas have for us Warriors here in these transformation prisons. We are to train new recruits and they won&#39;t get the option of taking mates... or at least looking for them until after they&#39;ve graduated and are assigned to their permanent unit.&quot;<br />
<br />
Doctor Kruss looked at Rager with a bit of disdain evident in his eyes, &quot;you forget Captain Rager that the very purpose of this facility is to transform humans into Lycothans and complete the conquest of this planet. And based on all reports that we&#39;re starting to get to the point where there aren&#39;t many humans left and we can move from the military confrontation with Earth to actually colonizing it to be the New Lycothos.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rager lowered his ears and looked down from the Alpha.<br />
<br />
&quot;I will also remind you, Captain Rager, that the policy you refer to came about at your insistence when Captain Lartara refused your advances,&quot; Doctor Kruss answered, &quot;a rather petty bit of revenge against a female of our species... It is your right to push for that policy... but in a matriarchy such as ours where the females generally have more power than the males... you&#39;re outvoted.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rager only grumbled something which made me think that there were at times struggles between males and females. Rager had always struck me as a sort of man&#39;s man that was little different from the various &quot;macho men&quot; that had often become tough guys that ultimately found themselves in prisons anyway. Yet, Lycothans put more power in their females according to everything that they had presented to me, which now made me figure that there might be some resentment of Lycothan females by their males, based on Rager&#39;s behavior. And based on what the doctor had said, that some of it was personal for Rager regarding this other Captain.<br />
<br />
&quot;As she wishes,&quot; Rager said in a way that made it painfully clear that he didn&#39;t want to.<br />
<br />
The two then turned back to me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Human 2101964, it would appear to be your lucky night,&quot; Doctor Kruss said with a smile, &quot;Our schedule for the moment has been rather booked, so we do not have the syringes ready to give you an injection of Lycothan blood to begin your transformation tonight... but it would appear that one of the night shift guards in the female wing is in heat and apparently lacks some self control in that regard. So, you will get to join us tonight and will actually get your first mate...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;First,&quot; I said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Doctor Kruss smiled again, &quot;we allow lone males to take multiple females as mates and they will stay together for their very long lives. From a sexual standpoint, it can be very good for the males... though don&#39;t think that this would advance you in our society. You will need to care and support your mate or mates, regardless of where she is assigned. Which means if she&#39;s assigned to a spot that you wouldn&#39;t necessarily fit in, too bad for you. You will go with her. You will also be responsible for doing a lot of the work for raising whatever pups you sire tonight... more than what human males are responsible for.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re nothing but a pimp then,&quot; I said to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;A pimp?&quot; Doctor Kruss asked, &quot;what... never mind. That&#39;s probably some human euphemism that your transformation will take out of you. And you will be pleased to know that you&#39;ll likely make a fine warrior. You certainly have the build to become one.&quot;<br />
<br />
Doctor Kruss then pointed to Rager and motioned with one hand to me. &quot;Take 2101964 the male wing&#39;s guest room. He can join us there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Rager said obediently.<br />
<br />
He came forward and grabbed me by an arm. As strong as I was, I was no match for a male Lycothan. He&#39;d practically pulled me along through the facility, giving me no time to grab my clothes. I stumbled behind him doing my best not to be drug behind him and have my shoulder dislocated. I was lead to a lone room that was actually decorated like a hotel room rather than the gray and uniform rooms that made up the prison.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll wait here,&quot; Rager answered, &quot;She will be with you shortly.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that he tossed me into the room and I tumbled through it. Rager then shut the door, and I heard it close and a heavy latch then clicked shut. It left me alone and with no way out. The room had no windows and while it was better furnished than the prison cells, it was still impossible to get out of. It left me with no options. The bed had nothing I could rip off to use as a weapon and from what I&#39;d remember seeing of Brenda after her transformation... even from a far, a female Lycothan was physically stronger than a Human male. I knew that I wasn&#39;t going to get out of this human and likely all my plans for revenge on the Lycothans would be ended. I&#39;d end up being another one of them.<br />
<br />
I looked down and sighed, &quot;Brenda... I&#39;m... I&#39;m sorry...&quot;<br />
<br />
I sighed again when the door behind me clicked open. I&#39;d turned to see the female Lycothan enter, wearing her uniform, a black tank top and a black loin cloth.  Her tank top had two red bars on her right shoulder. She carried the same musky scent that all the other Lycothans had, though hers was different from Rager&#39;s. I guessed that was a means to identify the gender of the Lycothan. She stood taller than I and had her hair in the standard warrior&#39;s crest that Warrior Lycothans had. The silver streak in her hair was there and noticeable. However, that wasn&#39;t the most surprising thing. It was Brenda, or at least the Lycothan formerly known as Brenda. Her eyes were different as gold flakes had crept into her blue eyes and she had far more muscle than she had ever had. Her finger and toe nails were slightly sharper. They weren&#39;t quite claws, but definitely more predatory than human fingernails. <br />
<br />
Her facial expression also carried a degree of predatory nature in her, but she also seemed to look through me. She looked at me like she was rancher buying cattle at an auction. There was no recognition or love in her eyes that I remembered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; she said slowly, her voice was the same, though slightly deeper than before. There was also a degree of arousal in her voice, &quot;I suppose you&#39;ll have to do for a mate... and you know your place...&quot;<br />
<br />
I found myself giving a nervous gulp.</p>
