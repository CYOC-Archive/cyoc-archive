<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In the Stovall house, the family of three were having a rather uncomfortable dinner. Melissa had come home with Martin in tow, almost dragging him by his tie. She’d found him in the hotel bar, chatting up some bottle blonde. And when she got home, Julie was nowhere to be found and the pool smelled like sex. Long story short, Melissa gave both lectures on their behavior.<br />
<br />
What’s more, both Stovall parents were a little disheartened to learn Julie and Eric had decided to take a break from each other. Julie’s promiscuity bothered Melissa more than Martin. She hoped Julie wouldn’t take after him in that regard. <br />
<br />
“So, um, what’s going on tomorrow?” Julie asked, trying to cut the tension. Her mother hadn’t stopped glaring at her father ever since she brought him home. And she was cutting her meal into tiny pieces. She’d made baked ziti, and while cutting the sausage, was giving Martin a very, VERY dirty look. And now Melissa was cutting those pieces into smaller pieces. Martin sat with his legs crossed. <br />
<br />
“I’m not doing anything. What about you dear?” Melissa asked, straining her voice on the “dear”. <br />
<br />
“Uh, nothing planned. Business things can wait until Monday. Wouldn’t want to ruin anyone’s Sunday.” he said. Melissa almost blew her top at that. <br />
<br />
“Ruin anyone’s Sunday my ass. You’re perfectly fine ruining our marriage.” she thought angrily. <br />
<br />
“Would it be alright if I went out with some of my girlfriends? They want to go shopping in the city?” Julie asked, wanting nothing more than to leave the dining room. <br />
<br />
“Sure. But be home before dark. I don’t want a group of teenage girls wandering the streets of Seattle at night.” Martin said, with no regard to his wife’s opinion. She wasn’t okay with it, and more to a point found it quite interesting he didn’t want his daughter wandering the city at night. Lord knows he’d bedded his fair share of free weres, barely of legal age (by normal standards) themselves. <br />
<br />
“Never though to consider my feelings on the matter did you?” she muttered.<br />
<br />
“What’s you say Mom?” Julie asked. <br />
<br />
“Nothing sweetie. How are you getting there?” <br />
<br />
“Lisa’s mom is going with us,” Julie said, alleviating some of her mom’s concerns, “Can I be excused? I have some homework left to do.”<br />
<br />
“Of course.” Melissa replied, glad to be alone with her husband.<br />
<br />
Julie cleared her plate and then sped off to her bedroom. There, she texted Brian that she was free to come over in half an hour if he was still willing to meet up again. <br />
<br />
“DINNER IS OVR. RDY IN 30 MIN.” she wrote. Brian quickly responded. <br />
<br />
“MOM’S HOME. CAN WE MEET SOMWHR ELS?” he said. Julie thought about it for a second before replying.<br />
<br />
“THE LAKE IN 30?” she offered. Moon Lake naturally had a small lake on the outskirts its border. It was pretty risking going there, since casual hikers often crossed its path. But it would be later at night, and Julie doubted anyone would catch them. <br />
<br />
“C U THR.”<br />
<br />
Julie smiled and then started her homework (she really did have some work to do). It took less than fifteen minutes to finish. The real problem was how to get out of the house without her parents noticing. She packed an overnight bag and crept downstairs. Her parents were in the kitchen, not arguing really, but nothing having a pleasant after diner that either.<br />
<br />
“…know. And it would appear Julie has unfortunately inherited that part of your DNA.” Melissa sighed. <br />
<br />
“Why is what she did so bad? She needed someone to relieve some of her need, and she couldn’t very well do it with Eric. Not while he was still human and refused to make the change.” Martin said.<br />
<br />
“See that’s the problem, you two both think it’s alright to just have sex with whoever you want. Regardless of the other person’s feelings. You justify everything because weres have more needs. Did it ever occur to you to exercise some self control? The rest of us make do without cheating left, right, and sideways.” Melissa snapped. <br />
<br />
“It doesn’t mean anything. I love you. It’s just…”<br />
<br />
“For fun?” Melissa interjects. Martin hangs his head in shame. He mutters something about going to his study. Melissa sighed, and continues to wash the dishes. Julie takes the opportunity to dash out the back, and into their garage. Then she exits through the garage door, and heads to the trail behind their house that leads to the lake. <br />
<br />
While walking, she thinks about what her mom said. Her sex with Brian didn’t mean anything either. It was all to, as her father said, to relieve some of her need. And she did love Eric. He seemed to reciprocate the feelings. At first anyway. Maybe she ruined everything by seeing Brian. If he hadn’t caught them, if Eric had agreed to be her weremerman, and the two got married one day, would she still see Brian? She didn’t want to end up in a marriage like her parents, but she didn’t want to lose Brian. Julie really did enjoy his company. <br />
<br />
“No point in wondering what could have been.” Julie thought. She starts walking faster, in anticipation of her evening with Brian. <br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Brian finished his own homework before slipping out the front door of his home. His mom and grandmother were sound asleep, even though it was still relatively early in the evening. He’d left a note that he would be going out to the movies with some friends. It was a highly plausible lie, And it kept his mother from calling to check. <br />
<br />
Twenty minutes after completing his paper for English, Brian threw some stuff into a bag and left the house. He rode his bike into the woods, and then onto the dirt trail that led to the lake. He was running a little late, as his house was farther from the lake than Julie’s. He caught the scent of another couple having sex somewhere in the woods, and it increased his own desires. <br />
<br />
Brian stopped once he saw the water catch the darkening sky. He parked his bike beside a tree, and locked the handles around a low hanging branch. Then removed his clothes, stuffed then into his backpack, and changed. <br />
<br />
Since otters were small animals, he remained the same height. As his otter form was based on the North American river otter, his tail was smaller than that of some other species of otter (a little over two feet), and his ears were closer together. His muzzle is short, more like a cat’s than a dog’s, with long, thick whiskers. His neck thickens some, and he hands and feet gain webbing and short claws.<br />
<br />
His fur is made of short, dense guard hairs. Light brown fur covers his arms, chest and back while gray and cream colored fur is on his chin and throat. His eyes adjust to the dark, and he dives into the lake. His ears and nose close up instinctively, so he can swim without worrying about sucking in water. He surfaces after a while, looking around for Julie. <br />
<br />
“You couldn’t wait for me?” She appears behind Brian, still in her normal form. But treading water completely naked. A sight that tugs Brian’s otter penis out of its hiding place. <br />
<br />
“Just got here.” he replied. Julie brushes her hands against Brian’s whiskers, something that excites him even more. He brings her close to him and kisses her neck. Julie sighed, and slowly begins to change herself. Brian’s kisses move down her body as she transforms. His lips touch skin, and eventually scale as he reachers her stomach. He talks a breath before submerging himself. He licks at where her vagina is hidden. <br />
<br />
Above the water Julie moans, and takes Brian’s head in her hands. She gives him subtle pulls forward, telling him to continue. Her outer slit opens, and Brian’s tongue slides in with ease. The taste of freshwater and Julie’s girl fluids mix in the water. Brian resurfaces for air, but mostly so he can stick his otter-cock in. <br />
<br />
They both moan, and then lean back into the water. Julie tail flicks back and forth in pleasure. At the surface of the water, bubbles pop from below. Their sounds of lust lost in the lake, only heard by the native fish and other aquatic life. Brian lifts his head up to get air, but Julie grabs his head and breathes air in while kissing him. He greedily sucks it in, also enjoying the long kiss.<br />
<br />
He bursts into Julie shortly after, and the cum that escapes her folds hangs suspended in the water. The pull away from each other for a moment, smiling at each other. Then continue their night, with Brian running his rough tongue across Julie’s chest, and down to her slit again.</p>
