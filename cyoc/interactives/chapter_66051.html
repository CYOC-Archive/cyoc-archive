<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Goeff sat and thought about what had happened. He spent a lot of time as his sister Lucy and in a way, perhaps he missed being a woman. He really loved the sex, but then again he loved being a man. He spent about a half an hour as a squirrel. Getting chased by Bobby B's dog. That asshole had been bullying Geoff since Geoff was 11 when Bobby B moved into the neighborhood. Now, Bobby B was a huge 6'4&quot; football player for the high school football team. About 80% of the high school loved him, after all they got as far as losing the state finals last year. The other 20% hated Bobby B as he tended to bully his way through school. Now Geoff had a machine that could even the score. But how?<br />
<br />
Geoff sat at his computer, ignoring his phone as it chirped to a dozen or so texts. Who knows what Lucy started when she had his body, what his friends thought, what his girlfriend thought. <br />
<br />
Geoff started to research about getting even with bully's. After fifteen minutes, he came to what he thought was the Jackie Chan &quot;Karate Kid&quot; movie, but it had Ralph Macchio and Pat Marita, neither of which Geoff had heard. He watched some clips on U-Tube and decided then and there he would use the machine to make him a karate expert. He spent more time looking up various karate and other martial arts experts.<br />
<br />
First wanted some physical strength. He spent some time researching different male bodies that were in good shape. He entered in the characteristics he wanted into the machine and started the process. This change was just painful. Up and down his chest and back, through his arms and legs, and up his neck. He yelped out in pain, but kept it quiet enough so his mom or Lucy didn't hear. After 3 minutes it was over. He stood up and he felt stronger. He took off his robe and looked at himself in the mirror, wearing only his boxer shorts. <br />
<br />
His arms were sculpted. He had a nice, but not overly obvious six-pack abs. He flexed his arms and his bicepts responed in a way he had never seen. He wasn't strong enough to tak on Bobby B, but he could probably take on a typical bully. <br />
<br />
Next was the karate. He spent time carefully entering into the machine exactly what he wanted, stopping from time to time to do a bit of research. Then he started this process. He was expecting something painful, but it was just a mild flash of light he saw in his mind and that was it. Geoff felt no different, but he knew he was different. One unexpected thing he found was he no longer was interested in taking on Bobby B. He knew he could take out this thug, but he had other things to worry about. <br />
<br />
He wanted to spend some time with Vicki. She would love his new body, but he would have to spring it on her. Maybe tonight. School started on Tuesday, two more days and he wanted to get back to being himself. <br />
<br />
Goeff got dressed, headed to the kitchen, grabbed an apple, and headed to the garage. He munched down the apple and then found what he was looking for. His dad's old dumb-bell set. He picked up one and it was so light. His new muscles were not even stressed.<br />
<br />
Goeff then sat and checked his texts. Most from his friends saying where they were and wondering where he was. The most interesting was the last one from Vicki. He sent Vicki a text and she responded that she was at home bored. Geoff replied he be right over. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, I'm heading over to Vicki's,&quot; was all Geoff said as he headed out the door. Bobby B's dog was sitting at the base of the tree in his yard. In the past, Geoff would chase the dog away, but he didn't care. He had to get together with Vicki to see what damage Lucy had done to his relationship.<br />
<br />
Vicki was waiting and the two walked down the street. Whatever Lucy had done was good. Vicki was wearing her jeans that just showed off her body and a very tight sweater. The kiss Vicki gave was long and deep. &quot;Good sign,&quot; Geoff thought. As the walked down the street, Vicki had her hand on his ass, pressing tight. Nice.<br />
<br />
As they walked, Vicki said, &quot;you feel great, what'ya been doin.&quot;<br />
<br />
Geoff replied, &quot;lifting weights, workin' out. Just now starting to see it workin.&quot;<br />
<br />
The headed over to the park where they liked to hang. Some friends and a few others they didn't know were there. They headed over and just hanged out with them. Nothing interesting, but nice to be with a few others. But Geoff noticed that Vicki was just hanging on a bit tigher than normal. Once it got dark, they found a nice isolated spot behind some trees.</p>
