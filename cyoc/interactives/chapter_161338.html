<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Following Mandeep&#39;s lead, Harpinder entered the Student Services building. As the name suggested, the building was dedicated to services that improved students&#39; quality of life on campus. This included study spaces, meeting rooms, and offices for each of the student organizations. The offices were smaller than the rooms where organizations held meetings with their members, but they did have enough space for organization leaders to meet and store supplies. Mandeep unlocked the door to the office with the &quot;Sikh Student Coalition&quot; plaque and a khanda decal in the window.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here we are, feel free to take a seat&quot; Mandeep pulled out a chair for Harpinder near the office desk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you&quot; Harpinder said as he sat. &quot;So this is the Sikh Student Coalition&#39;s office? Not too bad&quot; He had a skeptical expression. The office was very standard, just like every other organization&#39;s office. The only differences were items used during meetings that were specifically related to Sikh culture. &quot;This is what was so important? Is this where you ask me to get more involved with the SSC?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what if it was?&quot; Mandeep unlocked a cabinet and searched its contents.<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you already, I joined the organization for my grade. If I&#39;m going to secure a position in a global corporation before I graduate, I need to concentrate on my classes. I can&#39;t let extracurriculars distract me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a shame you feel that way. Do you realize how good being the leader of a student organization will look on my resume? It&#39;s real leadership experience. I&#39;ll be on the fast track towards management. I think a serious person like you would be perfect to be elected for a leadership position  next year&#39;s board.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harpinder twisted his mustache between his index finger and thumb, clearly intrigued by this prospect. &quot;I like the sound of being fast tracked. Perhaps I&#39;ll steal the presidency from you next year.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mandeep chucked, &quot;I would welcome the challenge! It&#39;s been too long before I found a worthy rival.&quot; Finding what he was looking for, Mandeep pulled a large cardboard box from the cabinet and set it on the table in front of Harpinder. &quot;Anyways, when I said I had something important to show you, I wasn&#39;t talking about the office, but what&#39;s inside it. Take a look.&quot;<br />
<br />
The box had some kind of branded logo on it. Opening the box, Harpinder saw many fabrics with a variety of colors and patterns, ranging from plain to detailed designs. &quot;Are these turbans?&quot; Harpinder pulled one out and felt the fabric in his hands. &quot;They&#39;re so smooth! These must feel amazing to wear. My own turban feels about as stiff as paper compared to these.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m glad you like them, Harpinder. These are the first products in my new business venture. You see, I was recently inspired by a fashion blog I saw on social media. I believe the handle was something like @sikhstyleguru ? I haven&#39;t been able to find it lately.&quot; Harpinder nodded, that somehow sounded familiar to him. &quot;Anyway, seeing a Sikh man promote himself as a fashion influencer inspired me to create a Sikh clothing brand. My entrepreneurship professor connected me with design students who helped me create the turban patterns, and I special ordered the fabric to get the exact feel I wanted. Now all I need is a business partner.&quot;<br />
<br />
 &quot;You want me to be your business partner?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t think of anyone better. Today, while discussing our project, you proved yourself to be an excellent partner. With the two of us working together, I know this brand will be a success.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, running a successful brand is sure to impress future employers.&quot; Harpinder considered.<br />
<br />
&quot;And if this all works out, I&#39;ll give you so much credit on your cultural studies project that you&#39;ll have over a 100% in Professor Martinez&#39;s class.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know how to negotiate. I&#39;ll do it&quot; the two shook on it. &quot;But getting this thing off the ground won&#39;t be easy. How do you propose we promote these?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now you&#39;re asking the right questions&quot; Mandeep handed Harpinder a flier titled &#39;Turban Day&#39;. &quot;I spoke with the other SSC leaders and we agreed to host a Turban Day on campus. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve heard of it being celebrated in major cities with large Sikh populations. Sikhs will tie turbans on non-sikhs and teach them about our culture. If we use our Brand&#39;s turbans for the event, we&#39;ll get plenty of exposure.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m impressed Mandeep, you&#39;ve thought of everything. In that case, please allow me to assist you and the rest of the SSC in tying turbans on our classmates.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We would be happy to have your help&quot; Mandeep grinned. &quot;Please, take that box home with you. It will be your supply for turban day.&quot; Harpinder nodded and lifted the box of turbans as he stood. The two exited the office and Mandeep locked everything up. &quot;Thank you, Harpinder. I look forward to working together.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is the least I can do as your partner, Mandeep&quot; Harpinder briefly broke his serious persona to flash a genuine smile. He then turned his attention to a well dressed man in a bright yellow turban walking towards them. &quot;Harri?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi roomie!&quot; Harri said with a big smile. &quot;Did I hear someone say &#39;partner&#39;? I&#39;m not interrupting a date, am I?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Strictly business partner, nothing more!&quot; Harpinder blushed and scowled at Harri. &quot;Mandeep, this is my room mate, Ha-&quot;<br />
<br />
Harpinder was interrupted by Mandeep greeting &quot;Harri!&quot; And giving Harri a hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;You two know each other?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Duh!&quot; Harri said. &quot;Since we&#39;re both leaders in student organizations, we spend a lot of time passing by each other in these offices. As soon as I saw this sexy Sikh, I new I had to get to know him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Harri, we missed you at the last Sikh Student Coalition meeting.&quot; Mandeep said, &quot;You missed your room mate&#39;s first meeting.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, I wish I didn&#39;t! But I&#39;ve been so busy with the Queer Student Union. That&#39;s actually why I&#39;m here, we just finished our executive meeting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see, I hope I&#39;ll catch you at our next meeting then, Harri. You two take care.&quot; Mandeep left on his own as Harri and Harpinder walked together to their dorm.  On the way, Harri told Harpinder about everything that happened at the Queer Student Union&#39;s executive meeting and again tried to convince him to join the organization. Harpinder turned him down, explaining the many projects he and Mandeep would be working on together. Once home, Harpinder stored the contents of the box in his wardrobe for storage. He place a few of the turbans in his book bag in case he met some potential buyers before turban day.<br />
<br />
The studius man sat at his study desk and opened his International Marketing notebook. &quot;I&#39;d best review today&#39;s notes while they&#39;re fresh in my memory&quot; He thought to himself. Though the longer he looked at his own notes, the less he recognized his own handwriting. &quot;Oh...&quot; Harpinder grabbed his head. The notes were getting blurry, he grabbed his dizzy head. Harpinder&#39;s turban fell off, turning back into pages of Mandeep&#39;s notes which inserted themselves into Harvey&#39;s notebook. The world became clearer as the man became Harvey once more. &quot;No!&quot; Harvey shouted when he finally came to, &quot;not again!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah! Where&#39;s the fire?&quot; Harri asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah!&quot; Harvey yelled in fright when he heard a Punjabi accent behind him, then calmed when he realized it was only his transformed room mate. &quot;Sorry Harry- er, &#39;Harri&#39;. I just made a mistake on my notes.&quot; Harvey closed his International Marketing notebook without realizing Mandeep&#39;s notes were inside. He then opened his religious studies notebook to the list of things he knew about his transformations. He looked at number 4, &#39;When I transform, my personality changes a little bit and my memory gets a bit foggy.&#39; thit time was different, his personality and memories changed completely. The last thing he remembered was the pages from Mandeep&#39;s notebook hugging his face, everything after that is blank. He hoped Mandeep hadn&#39;t convinced him to do anything stupid while transformed! He wrote in his notebook, &#39;5. Sometimes the personality and memory changes are stronger. Happened when I was around Mandeep. Don&#39;t trust him.&#39; Harvey sighed. If Mandeep was the mastermind behind his transformations, it made sense that he would be able to make it stronger. Still, he would have to try and avoid all of the organization&#39;s members just to be safe. <br />
<br />
Harvey closed his notebook and got ready for bed. He was happy that he&#39;d finally get to remove the patka, if only while sleeping, before it&#39;s magic made his tie it back on tomorrow.</p>
