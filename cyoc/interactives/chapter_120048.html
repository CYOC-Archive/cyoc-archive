<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the guys talked to each other, Jae could tell Kai was different.  This version of his brother was definitely more laid back and kinder.  He was head over heals for Solomon, you could just tell by the way he was with Solomon.  They both were sitting on the floor but Solomon was sitting between Kai&#39;s legs, as he leaned back against Kai&#39;s chest.  Kai gently stroked his hair or held him tight. <br />
As for the rest of his crew,  he had noticed the subtle changes.  Luca had buffed out a little and now looked like an Olympic gymnast.  Ty had toned up a little.  The two of them still over the moon for each other, Ty sitting on the couch with Luca laying, resting his head on Ty&#39;s lap, while Ty ran his hand up and down Luca&#39;s chest.  Tristan and Silas now had a seemingly permanent tan and spent all their type with Marco, who now had a physique to rival theirs.  Jae didn&#39;t exactly know what the relationship was there, but as long as they were happy.  Hakim had developed a slightly alternative look, his hair now a fade with red highlights that accented it, a chin strap beard, both ears pierced, tongue and eyebrow all pierced.  Kenji looked just as he remembered.  He sat in the recliner, chatting with everyone. Park was busy already going through the former coach&#39;s computer.  After some time everyone went home, Park offered Kenji the guest room until things were figured out.<br />
<br />
The next morning Jae was up early.  He grabbed a change of clothes and put them in his bag.  As he headed out, the door to Kai&#39;s room was halfway open and he could see Solomon laying on his back, while Kai was on his side right up against Solomon, his head resting on Solomon&#39;s shoulder, and arm resting on his chest.  Solomon held Kai as their legs intertwined, content looks on their faces.  It was adorable, and he was sure that it might be hot had it not been his brother.  Jae grabbed his board and went out.  He ended up at Park&#39;s house.  He knew that it was just Kenji and Park, but he wanted to have a little fun.  He climbed the tree outside Park&#39;s bedroom.  He climbed over to the window, opened it and climbed into Park&#39;s bedroom.  Park was sound asleep as Jae crept into his bed and rolled back the covers.  Park lie there in just his boxers, his hard cock rising through the boxers.  Jae crawled over and slowly took Park&#39;s cock into his warm, wet mouth.  He started slowly so as to not wake Park.  He looked up at Park as his head went up and down, admiring how sexy Park looked, every part of him was defined.  He had this face that both filled with boyish mischief and rugged manliness.  Jae started to use his tongue more, licking the shaft or teasing the tip, causing Park to writhe in pleasure.  He found it adorable when this happened because, whether he was awake or not, Park would curl his toes.  Jae was so good at blowing Park, he could do it without waking him.  Finally between what Jae was doing with his tongue, the way he sucked and the speed, Park, twisting them blanket in his hand and arching his back, let out a loud moan of ecstasy as he came into Jae&#39;s expecting mouth.  Park opened his eyes, saw Jae trying to look innocent and smiled.  He reach over and pulled Jae on top of him, kissing him.  The two lay there holding each other as the room filled with the morning light.<br />
&quot;That was an amazing way to wake up.&quot; Park said with a smile.  &quot;What did I do to deserve that?&quot;<br />
&quot;You never gave up on me, or any of us.  You saved me, Kenji...and well everyone.  You never lost hope.  You...you just amaze me...and that&#39;s why I love you.&quot;  Jae said, trying to hold back tears of happiness.<br />
Park was filled with such joy.  Even though Jae had said it before over the course of their relationship, this was one of those times where he could see how deep that sentiment was.  &quot;I love you too!  I don&#39;t ever want this feeling to end.&quot; The kissed.<br />
<br />
Park rolled on top of Jae.  He continued to kiss Jae, their tongues dancing.  Park held Jae&#39;s wrists and arms down as he made his way over to Jae&#39;s neck, teasing it, then up to his ear, nibbling it, which drove Jae crazy.  After doing this to both ears, Park made his way down to Jae&#39;s pecs.  Jae tried to move his arms but Park made a noise that sounded like &quot;uh uh.&quot;  Park paused on his left nipple, teasing it with his tongue, sucking on it and gently biting it, which caused Jae to moan and writhe a little.  He then worked his way up to Jae&#39;s left shoulder, then ran his tongue along the left bicep and arm.  He quickly did the same in the right side making his way down to right nipple.  Park ran his tongue over Jae&#39;s abs.  He pulled down Jae&#39;s shorts and in one quick motion, threw them to the side. He ran his tongue up and down and around Jae&#39;s cock.  He put his mouth around the head and sucked and teased, which made drove Jae absolutely nuts.  He quickly sat up,pulled Park&#39;s face up to his and just started devouring each other&#39;s mouths.  Park sucked on Jae&#39;s lower lip, running his teeth over it as he pulled his mouth away.  He gently pinched Jae&#39;s nipples and lay him back down.  He grabbed Jae&#39;s legs and put them on top of his broad shoulders.  As he was doing this, he felt Jae&#39;s hand grab his cock, guiding it to his waiting hole.  Park slowly and gently entered Jae&#39;s tight ass.  Once his entire cock was in, he started to buck his hips.  As he slowly entered and withdrew, Jae pulled Park down and again they made out.  Shortly there after, Jae tight gripped Park and in a fluid motion, rolled Park on his back.  As Park continued to thrust, Jae helped by bouncing up and down.  They both moaned in pleasure throughout.  Park reached down and grabbed Jae&#39;s cock, jerking off.  The went faster and faster, getting closer and closer.  Park grabbed Jae&#39;s head pulling him to his waiting mouth, thrusting his tongue into Jae&#39;s mouth, while jerking Jae off ever faster.  Jae&#39;s right arm, which had been been at Park&#39;s side, moved, his had rubbing Park&#39;s left bicep and pec, and starting teasing his nipples.  Finally, they both gasped at the same time, let out loud moans, and came.  Jae looked at Park, smiling, Park pulled him down on top of him and the kissed and just held each other, content .<br />
<br />
After an hour they both sat on the edge of Park&#39;s bed.  Park couldn&#39;t help but notice the changes up close.  Jae was now 6&#39;0, his arms had grown an inch or two, his pecs were a little bigger as were his legs.  His boxer briefs clung to his waist and thighs like a second skin.  Park wondered if this size change would cause problems on the field or while boarding.  He also wondered why everyone&#39;s memories had been slightly altered, except for Kai and Solomon.<br />
Jae looked over to at Park, &quot;You look a million miles away...you ok?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah just admiring your body...wondering why our memories were changed except your bro and his bf.  <br />
&quot;If you like it so much, I&#39;m sure we could make some cosmetic changes to you...&quot; He grinned.  <br />
Park looked appalled and hurt, &quot;Why would you say something like that??  What&#39;s happened to you?  You never would have even had a thought like that before.&quot;<br />
&quot;I was just going off what you said babe&quot; he said defensively.<br />
&quot;After everything we have gone through these past few months, what our friends have gone through...just get out...I don&#39;t know how these changes affected you, but right now...right now I just can&#39;t handle it!&quot; Park said, tears streaming from his face.  <br />
Jae put on his clothes in silence, looked at Park hurt not because he had been asked to leave but because he had hurt Park, and climbed out the window.<br />
Park paced his room looking aggravated.  He then went over to his computer and decided if Jae wanted someone closer to his size, that&#39;s what he would get.  He put in all the physical parameters.  He made it so he would have a separate personality but Park would retain knowledge of what happened.  He set the ethnicity to random and the changes for a week, he didn&#39;t want to become someone else entirely but this person was their own individual.  He also set it so there was one thing that would reverse the changes before the week was out.  Lastly he made it so he would be easily absorbed into the group.<br />
Park hit transform and prepared himself for the changes.  He felt his hair grow, reaching the middle if his back, but remaining black.  His skin tone took on a more bronze tone.  His musculature shifted, he had a runner&#39;s build but with a little more muscle packed on.  He could feel the muscles in his legs and thighs grow slightly.  He was waist remained small even as his abs became more defined and his pecs grew a little.  His biceps grew to 20 in.  His facial features shifted.  Tattoos started to appear on his arms, chest, upper back and just above his groin.  A pair of Nike Flyknit racers appeared where his soccer clears were.  A necklace with an eagle claw charm appeared around his neck and a leather bracelet appeared around his left wrist.  As his room shifted to reflect the new him, he felt his personality fading to the back as the new one emerged.  He tied his hair back, put on a tank top, some nylon shorts and his running shoes.  As he left his room and headed downstairs, he saw Kenji.<br />
&quot;Hey man, I&#39;m going for a run, you want to join?&quot; He asked.<br />
Kenji looked up at him, and for a moment didn&#39;t recognize him, until a flood of new memories came in.  &quot;Oh hey!  Morning bro!  Yeah sure!  Just give me a sec to change.&quot; Kenji said, running up the stairs to change.</p>
