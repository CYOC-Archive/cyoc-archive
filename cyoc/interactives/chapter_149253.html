<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Henry&#39;s mouth opened and closed in shock several times. He had no idea how to react to this. His wife, the mother of his children, was sporting a fat cock and balls. <br />
<br />
True he knew that this was a possibility, or rather, Jess had said that going bi-gendered was part of the cabin&#39;s curse. <br />
<br />
Jess... He was suddenly very aware of the balled up wet panties he held. He shifted uncomfortably in his seat, sticking his hands to his sides and revealing his lap.<br />
<br />
Joan&#39;s eyes widened and her mouth slowly turned to a beaming smile as she looked at his lap. &quot;Oh Honey!&quot; She beamed, elated. &quot;I&#39;m so happy you&#39;re okay with this!&quot;<br />
<br />
He looked down; he was still sporting a ridiculous erection from when Jess had... oh no... he had to explain. His mouth opened and he stopped. What was he going to say? &#39;Oh no Honey, that erection wasn&#39;t from you, that&#39;s from when I was about to fuck our daughter, after she seduced me.&#39; He closed his mouth and nodded at her instead. Best pretend this was always for her.<br />
<br />
Joan, assuming now the erection was for her was delighted. Her husband was okay with this. More than just okay it seemed. She wasn&#39;t quite sure what to make of his reaction, but all her fears and self-doubt from the last few days vanished. She felt well. She felt confident. <br />
<br />
She felt very sexy too. She stepped forward, closing the distance, pudgy cock bouncing with each step. She stopped right in front of Henry. Where Jess had stood, Henry&#39;s cock jumped again at the thought of her. Joan took it as a sign of excitement. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow... Well. I was so scared you&#39;d reject me for this.&quot; She momentarily looked vulnerable. Henry&#39;s mouth opened and closed again. He had so many questions, when had this happened? Why hadn&#39;t she told him earlier? <br />
<br />
&quot;Do. Do you want to touch it?&quot; Joan asked, biting her lip coyly, swaying from side to side. Henry watched transfixed as the stiffened cock swung from side to side. &#39;No time to back out now&#39;, Henry thought nodding and reaching out, brushing it with his fingertips. It was warm, and surprisingly silky. Joan gasped at the touch, and then giggled.<br />
<br />
This was perfect. Henry was okay with the changes, and...<br />
<br />
...and that meant she was okay with the changes too. No longer afraid of rejection, the lusty part of her mind began to rise again. She wanted to seduce him. Maybe, maybe he did deserve a little reward for how good he was. She could suck him off perhaps? But where was the fun for her in that, they deserved better.<br />
<br />
She stood back a little as his hand left her cock. &quot;I think someone has earned a little reward.&quot; Firs Slowly she lifted her dress fully over her head, full breasts falling free, hanging down, nipples hard and thick. She wanted to fuck, she wanted to be mounted more specifically.<br />
<br />
She spun once fully on the spot, letting Henry see all of her. Cock or no, he did genuinely enjoy the view of his wife&#39;s body. His cock finally twitched for her, though there was a whiff of something strange. She smiled and leaned down, unbuckling his belt and fishing out his cock. Playfully she gave it a lick, then a quick slurp; Henry moaned.<br />
<br />
&#39;Good&#39; she thought. Joan stood again and turned around. Slowly she knelt down, then lowered herself onto all fours, presenting herself to her husband. Henry could see she was dripping wet as she waggled her ass at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;The changes?&quot; He asked. Joan looked over her shoulder. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, it only locks once I cum, I&#39;ll stop it long before then.&quot; she laughed, she knew as the words left her mouth it was a lie. She was terrifyingly excited to be mounted. &quot;Besides, you look far more ready to explode than me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Henry was still confused though. Joan had never really been one for doggy-style, she always liked missionary or cowgirl. He opened his mouth to ask why she wasn&#39;t going cowgirl, but caught himself in time. His heart jumped. He&#39;d almost said an animal. The same animal as Jess...<br />
<br />
&quot;Why facing that way Joan?&quot; He asked instead. Joan stopped. Because she wanted to be mounted. By her man. Her big buck. It just felt right. &quot;Oh just to hide this for now.&quot; she turned, grabbing her package and shook it. &quot;No need to expose you too it all at once.&quot;<br />
<br />
That seemed reasonable to Henry. Accepting it he leaned forward, and slipped off the sofa, kneeling behind his wife. She shook with excitement at he aligned his cock with her sopping folds. The smell was strong now. his cock aligned and Jess instantly jerked back, impaling herself with a squelch and moaning loudly.<br />
<br />
A wave of the musk hit him then, and it finally clicked. The smell was the smell of goat, and it was coming from Joan. His wife stank of goat. His nose hairs curled at the smell, it was too overpowering. He couldn&#39;t back out now thought<br />
<br />
He began breathing through his mouth, the smell disappeared, and he began moving back and forth. Joan responded in kind by rocking herself back into him with every thrust, heavy breasts swinging pendulously underneath her.<br />
<br />
Joan was in heaven, her big strong buck had mounted her and was giving her a good fucking. As she moaned from thrust after thrust, drinking in the smell of sex in the room. It was the smell of herself, the shameful smell, it was making her so much more horny. It made her lower abdomen tingle. &#39;The Changes!&#39;, she instantly thought, afraid and excited. What was it this time?<br />
<br />
She propped one hand to take her weight and hold her steady, the other slithered down her stomach and felt around. She came in contact with her hard cock first, giving it a few delighted tugs, until a jolt of pleasure pulled her free again. Her hands roamed around her stomach, finding two identical bumps low down. She knew what they were instantly. She stuck her head down staring at herself upside-down. Between her heavy breasts she could see the one-eyed, dribbling face of her cock, along with her two pendulous balls, rocking with every thrust. Slowly, however, her cock was being obscured from view, as her new breasts grew out from her crotch, falling around her cock. <br />
<br />
&#39;Holy fuck that looks hot&#39; She thought, this was such a sexy change. She breathed deep. The smell was heavenly. Eyes rolling, she needed more. But Henry!?<br />
<br />
Fuck it, there was no way he couldn&#39;t smell her; and if he was okay with this he must be enjoying it too. Some muscles within her unclenched.<br />
<br />
Henry, however, was very much overwhelmed by the smell and had taken to completely blocking his nose. He was completely shocked then when Joan bellowed loudly, he felt her clench and unclench, then felt something warm flow around the base of his cock and his balls.<br />
<br />
The patter of liquid on the wooden floor drew his eyes down, which widened in shock as he realised what Joan was doing. She was pissing herself. Momentarily forgetting to breathe through his mouth he caught the overwhelming scent of goat. He almost gagged. Not wanting to shock his wife he instead did the only thing he could think of to cover the smell. He took the balled up panties in his hand. Jess&#39;s panties, and shoved them against his mouth and nose. Breathing deeply.<br />
<br />
That was it. The smell was indescribable in comparison. Fire pumped through his arteries and down to his cock. Which quickly exploded inside his wife.<br />
<br />
Joan squealed in delight as she felt Henry explode inside her. Her hands shot to her cock, mushing it against her growing breasts &#39;He likes the smell too!&#39; she thought, this was the best day ever. All of her shameful acts the last few days were totally vindicated. He was totally fine with her cock. He liked her new scent. Her body was good! But it could be better.<br />
<br />
As Henry slumped back, spent, Joan scooted forward, turning and spreading her legs, revealing a growing juicy breast either side of her cock. Before Henry had time to recover and protest, he watched as his wife grabbed one crotch-boob in either hand and squashed her cock between them. Two thrusts is all it took for her to grunt and her seed to spill onto her stomach folds. She beamed proudly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look Honey, twice the fun now!&quot; Inside her the force of the hairy man from the painting roared in triumph. Idly spun her finger around a pool of her own cum on her stomach. As she brought it to her lips she winked at him, before dipping it in for a taste.<br />
<br />
Not wasting time, she then stood, moving to both doors, and locking them.<br />
<br />
&quot;If Jess is upstairs, and James is in our room, then I guess we&#39;d better stay the night here.&quot; She suggested, just as a glob of cum rolled off her leg and plopped to the floor.<br />
<br />
Henry gulped</p>
