<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In the end, no genius ideas come to mind. You figure that you&#39;re just going to have to get out there, flap your flippers, swim your wiggly merman ass off, and try and make as many of the mermaids happy as you can manage. And if you can&#39;t, well, it&#39;s a small matter—you only really care about making sure that Yasmin&#39;s eggs get fertilized. Because you want her to get what she wants and be happy. Your mate.<br />
<br />
Yasmin called you her mate. And not in a British, &quot;You&#39;re my friend,&quot; sort of way. She meant something more akin to spouse, or as close as one could come in a wild and mystical place like Mermaid Island. The connotation was primal; animalistic; and kind of a turn-on.<br />
<br />
Which made it doubly annoying that you&#39;d managed to get Yasmin off that morning, but she hadn&#39;t returned the favor—and wouldn&#39;t, not until there were eggs in the water. You suspect that every other mermaid on the island is going to be feeling pretty much the same way, so you decide that you have some time to kill before the big showdown. You start by trying to cool yourself off with a shower under the lagoon&#39;s waterfall; then swimming out past the sandbars, seeing how high you can leap out of the water dolphin-style when you really get up to speed; and finally, after that, a nap on the beach to recover your stamina.<br />
<br />
At some point when the morning was still young, you lost track of Yasmin. She mentioned something about wondering where Alex went before swimming off. You tried not to think too much about what would happen if Alex was around for the egg-laying. Hopefully nothing untoward.<br />
<br />
At about an hour before midday, with the sun creeping high overhead, Sally and two other mermaids that you don&#39;t know as well spy you on the beach and resolve to drag you out to the deeper waters a couple of miles away from the shore of the island, out to the spot where, in Sally&#39;s words, &quot;all the girls are out syncin&#39; up their eggs together.&quot; You cannot tell whether she&#39;s joking or not.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, you follow, and you are led out to a place that truly feels like &quot;the middle of the ocean&quot;—or the middle of nowhere. You&#39;re at least a hundred meters, maybe more, below the surface; you certainly cannot see the seabed here. Instead, there is nothing but ocean in all directions, and a vague sense that things are dark if you look down and bright if you look up. <br />
<br />
And then you see them: the more than thirty sirens that populate Mermaid Island, suspended in the water together and looking for all the world like a swarm of ghostly spirits. But they make for beautiful spectres, all: long hair floating in graceful clouds, naked breasts offered out to you as tribute, long and powerful fishtails with scales that still glitter even at this depth, and gauzy tail-fins that swish and sway in the currents.<br />
<br />
Now you realize that they&#39;re all singing. It&#39;s a wordless tone that rises and falls, many voices in harmony, like a whale-song but much more pleasant and alluring to your ears. A few of these sea-goddesses part at your approach, and you see Yasmin in the middle of the crowd, her arms stretched out to you, her face flushed red with the onset of the mating-season. <br />
<br />
You go to her, fall into her arms, and kiss her softly. There is no urgency now: whatever is going to come will come at its own pace, in its own time. Right now, you just want to be with your beloved, and the mermaids around you watch and wait, just as curious about what will soon take place.<br />
<br />
When it starts, there is little fanfare. One moment, you and Yasmin are kissing and petting each other, just enjoying the sensation of being together and floating with your lover in this empty pelagic void; the next, she gets a fierce cramp somewhere below her waistline, causing her to keel over and grunt. The muscles in her fishtail&#39;s loins suddenly begin contracting rather violently, and her egg-vent starts expelling little orange orbs a little smaller than golf-balls, one after another, in a great mass.<br />
<br />
It&#39;s clear that expelling the eggs is taking some sort of toll on Yasmin; at the very least, she seems to be exerting herself, however involuntarily. She tries to hold onto you, to tease your erogenous zones and perhaps trigger your own release, but there&#39;s really nothing for it: laying takes up too much of her energy and concentration.<br />
<br />
And so a couple of the other mermaids nearby who have not yet begun to lay jump in to help you along: it doesn&#39;t take much stimulation at all before you too are ejaculating, your seed a white cloud in the water that diffuses everywhere. You can only hope that your effusions and Yasmin&#39;s find each other in the waters between you; but there is no way to be sure.<br />
<br />
There is also no rest for the weary: many other mermaids are now also undergoing the same process as Yasmin. You see Sally in one place, Xiuying in another, and Nyah in still another. You swim over to each of them in turn, and to your surprise, you continue to release cloud after cloud of merman semen. With each new burst, there is a sort of relaxing feeling in your loins, but no orgasm. And you realize that it&#39;s exactly as Sally had said earlier: this is not sex; it&#39;s just mating. A simple biological function so common to the animal kingdom, and nothing more.<br />
<br />
Nothing human, that&#39;s for certain.<br />
<br />
On it goes, minute after minute, as the noonday sun hovers far, far above. It becomes a blur to you of beautiful faces contorted in mild pain, blushing breasts, gaping egg-holes with trails of slime still dripping from them, and glittering scales and fins. Eventually, you don&#39;t even notice where the eggs are anymore; there are too many, all over everywhere, to possibly care. Eventually, you notice that this near-constant ejaculation is taking its toll your your body as well; the passage between your vent and your gonads is dull from the pain of excessive use, and your testes themselves are overworked and swollen. Eventually, you realize that some of the mermaids are starting to leave the area, to swim back towards the island.<br />
<br />
And that&#39;s when you see Alex, one of the last few mer-girls in the crowd, doubled over and filling the waters around her with eggs of her own.<br />
<br />
Before she&#39;s even quite done, she makes an awkward attempt at swimming over to you. It isn&#39;t pretty; so you meet her half-way. You&#39;re more tired than anything else, but you manage. &quot;Hey,&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, John,&quot; says Alex, along with one final grunt as the last of her eggs fall free. &quot;Figured I&#39;d find you out here with every girl on the island. Way to go, Casanova.&quot; She&#39;s trying to keep her tone light, but she doesn&#39;t quite succeed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think I had a choice,&quot; you quip.<br />
<br />
To which Alex replies, &quot;I don&#39;t think I did either. Something *made* me want to swim out here. I don&#39;t like it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just then, as if the universe is trying to set a new record for maximum awkwardness, you release again, for what must be at least the twenty-fifth time in as many minutes. Alex stares at the cloud of jizz diffusing outward in all directions away from your midsection. Then she one-ups every joke you&#39;ve ever made at her expense by saying, &quot;Uncle Jack&#39;s gonna be pissed if you knocked me up just now.&quot;<br />
<br />
You&#39;re so mortified, so physically and emotionally spent, that you can&#39;t help the fit of laughter that overtakes you. <br />
<br />
Alex doesn&#39;t join in. You wonder whether she wasn&#39;t being halfway serious after all.<br />
<br />
It&#39;s not long after that that the last of the mermaids have done their business—that&#39;s how you&#39;re thinking about it now, clinically, mechanically—and Yasmin finds you and Alex awkwardly hanging out together, neither speaking nor looking each other in the eye.<br />
She grins at you, kisses you, and then does the same to Alex. A very short while later, the three of you are swimming hand-in-hand back to the island.<br />
<br />
That evening, once the sun is set and everything has stopped aching, you and Yasmin and a couple of other girls make love on the beach. Alex is rolling around on the sand with Sally and their customary bevy of five or six others. The mermaids are all very excited about the possibility of mer-babies, perhaps huge numbers of them, swimming around the island in great schools. You doubt very much that there will be too many children hatched, if any. But the mermaids don&#39;t care: they just look forward to having a fish-tailed little infant in either arm, each suckling at a breast, and they start coming up with ideas for names.<br />
<br />
Then you wake up in your bed in the costume-shop, Yasmin still next to you in her new melusine form, still fast asleep.</p>
