<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
After nearly an hour of teasing and purposeful edging, Spencer managed to get his dicked friends to blow their loads right before each of their timers ended, letting their spunk splash over his chest to mix with Nick’s own load. The pleasure was so intense he damn near passed out, but the series of flashes that ended with three other guys on their knees around him and their cocks flopped on his abs, he couldn’t allow himself to fall asleep just yet. <br />
<br />
The only dicked guy left in the room was Nick, who sputtered out a few drops of cum. Spent and soft, attached to Spencer’s crotch. <br />
<br />
In the haze of their afterglow, the four men stretched and rubbed their aching balls. Slowly, they picked themselves up and their phones, the dicking app still open and ready to use. <br />
<br />
“Fuck, that was nice,” Spencer said, the last of them to be standing. <br />
<br />
Rob scratched his neck, but his dick stood ready and leaking already. “Shouldn’t we try to undick Nick? He didn’t look happy about it earlier.”<br />
<br />
Sam almost agreed, but then remembered he hadn’t been warned about the possibility of being a penis for a year. “I mean, he’s kind of a dick.”<br />
<br />
The rest laughed, and Spencer teased Nick by rubbing the tip of his head. “That’s one way to put it, yeah.”<br />
<br />
Joe took one look at Nick, then shrugged. “Do whatever you want. That last round wasn’t enough for me.”<br />
<br />
Nick suddenly hardened, and Spencer blinked at the few mental words flashing in his mind. Something about being paired with Joe. Huh. Weird intrusive thoughts. Spencer hadn’t much desire to be dicked for now. It was too much fun being alone in a pile of dicks. <br />
<br />
Without another word, Joe fiddled with his phone, only to fist pump when he got his results. “Hell yeah! I got seven weeks as a disembodied dick!”<br />
<br />
Sam, Rob and Spencer all grinned at him. Rob even slapped his ass playfully. <br />
<br />
Bowing in triumph, Joe thanked them theatrically, then started pumping his cock. “Let’s start this off the right way. Hard.” He winked at them as he made sure to thumb the tip of his dickhead, the timer approaching zero when he accelerated. “See you fuckers in seven weeks then.”<br />
<br />
In a flash, Joe disappeared, only his eight inches of man meat left on the floor. Cum drizzled out of his slit and soaked up the carpet. Sam picked him up with a rueful sigh. “I’m gonna have to do so much cleaning after this.” Then, with a fake harsh tone, tugged on Joe’s balls. “You’re going to be a pain in the ass, aren’t you, you prick?”<br />
<br />
As a silent response, Joe twitched in Sam’s grip, and Sam teased him with a kiss. Salty. <br />
<br />
Now, it was just Sam, Rob and Spencer as the humans in the room, and the three of them were still exhausted from their fun time. Without bothering to dress up, the three of them sat down on the couch and Nick’s gamer chair. As Nick’s owner, it felt right for Spencer to be the one to use it. Slowly, the men sipped their beers and talked about the dicking experience. Rob had shot his phone looks every time dicking had been mentioned, his tongue sometimes poking out of his lips as if he was thirsty. <br />
<br />
“Still, it’s kind of weird,” Sam said eventually, “I didn’t know you could dick someone else without them participating.”<br />
<br />
Spencer shrugged. “Neither did I, but apparently yeah.”<br />
<br />
“Hmm, think Nick knows something about it?”<br />
<br />
There was a pause. “Oh, yeah, you could talk even when you were a dick, right?”<br />
<br />
“Nick showed me, there’s a toggle option for dicking communication.”<br />
<br />
The moment Spencer had clicked it, Nick’s voice rang from his loin.  “Damn it, Sam! I’ve been trying to tell you to do that for half an hour!”<br />
<br />
“Sorry, sorry. I didn’t think you’d mind being a penis this much, seeing as you used the app by yourself a bunch of times on your own.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, but I don’t like being a stranger’s dick,” he said, his head pointing at Spencer’s face. <br />
<br />
“I kind of want to be offended by that. I have a great jerking off technique, you know?” he said, grabbing Nick with a lazy hand. “And it’s not like you can do anything about it.” <br />
<br />
“The app has tech support actually,” Sam said, fiddling with his phone. “Maybe we can look this up.” <br />
<br />
When it started to ring, he brought his phone to Spencer’s crotch.<br />
<br />
“Dicking App, tech support, how may I help you?”  “... Nick Altman, again? Oh, you decided to take a turn being a sexual organ. Seven and a half inches, thinner than average. Good for you.”<br />
<br />
“What? No! I didn’t decide anything. This guy dicked me by accident. The app says you can’t be dicked without your consent!” Nick yelled. “You can’t dick someone else without them agreeing to it. There’s the fingerprint identification and everything. So how’d Spencer dick me on his own?”<br />
<br />
The voice on the other end of the line remained infuriatingly calm. “Ah. I see you haven’t read all our Terms of Service articles. Our dicking app uses ‘inferred consent’ when it comes to users currently benefiting from our dicking program. After all, a dick couldn’t use fingerprints to agree to a new roll of the roulette, correct?”<br />
<br />
Nick faltered, his shaft softening. “Well, y-yeah, but, but I wasn’t a dick at the time!”<br />
<br />
“Our app makes no distinction between dicked and dicking users. This was part of the agreement you signed when you downloaded our program, sir.”<br />
<br />
“Fuck...” he swore under his breath. “So someone else has to dick Spencer so I can change back?”<br />
<br />
“Well, that would work, but I would advise not to abuse this trick to circumvent a dicking timer. It merely pauses them and overlaying too many of them might cause problems down the line.”<br />
<br />
“You’ve got to be kidding me!” Nick shouted, and Spencer winced. Deciding that was enough, he muted him for the time being. <br />
<br />
Sam looked down, thinking of what he’d just heard. “Sir, is it possible that the app is broken?”<br />
<br />
“It would be very unlikely,” Hugo said, clipped, “none of our servers detect any problem with it. What seems to be the issue, Sam Kelly, eight inches and a quarter in length, six inches of girth, large balls? ”<br />
<br />
Sam ignored the creepy details about his penis and started talking, a bit hesitant. “Well, after I got turned back, the app got locked on this screen. It asks if I want to go back to being Nick’s cock for 364 days. It’s not letting me do anything else.”<br />
<br />
There was a sign on the other end of the line. “Humans,” Hugo mumbled. “This is also part of the Terms of Service, sir. By using the dicking roulette app, you agree to the result and transfer information about dicking to our servers. The app is conceived to firstly collect data on dicking and men’s psychology once transformed into their own penises. By design, we want you to spend as much time dicked as possible. ”<br />
<br />
“But that’s way too long. I wouldn’t mind being dicked for a few hours or days at a time, but a year is… like, would I even remember how not to be a cock.”<br />
<br />
“Of course, if you do not wish to be a penis for a year minus one day, you may try to uninstall and reinstall your dicking app. After which, the app’s memory storage will be cleared and you may the dicking roulette once more. Be forewarned however that this carries a risk of interfering with the app’s algorithm and could result in a glitch.”<br />
<br />
Sam, Rob and Spencer exchanged worried looks.<br />
<br />
 “A glitch? Like… what?” Rob asked. <br />
<br />
“Oh, nothing worrisome, sir. Rob, twelve inches long, seven inches thick. Grade A cock. Congratulations, by the way.”<br />
<br />
“Err, thanks?”<br />
<br />
“You’re most welcome. We do hope you continue using our dicking app.”<br />
<br />
Spencer punched Rob’s shoulder. “Focus, dickhead. Sir, what glitches?”<br />
<br />
“Like I said, nothing to worry about. At most, one of you might get a false timer with the wrong number or become someone else’s dick instead of the other way around. There shouldn’t be any permanent transformation into a cock. We worked that kink out during the alpha testing.”<br />
<br />
Rob’s penis throbbed almost painfully. Oh damn… he had felt so goddamned good the entire time he’d been his own cock, he didn’t want to imagine what it would be like if the experience was permanent. Just thinking about it made his dick leak pre over the floor. <br />
<br />
“Dude!” Spencer said, flinching away. <br />
<br />
Sam however gulped, pretending he hadn’t had the same kind of thoughts. He glanced back at his phone, and the frozen timer. A year… man, a year was a long time, sure, but it wasn’t like he’d be a dick *forever*, right? Being a penis felt like heaven, his whole skin so sensitive to touch, his body stiff, always ready for one thing… <br />
<br />
“If that is everything, sirs, I will be taking my leave and wish you a good time with our dicking app,” Hugo said before hanging up. <br />
<br />
Nick jolted up and down worryingly. “Damn it. I hoped that guy would just undick me. Okay, fuck, Spencer, start another round of the roulette with Sam or Rob then.”<br />
<br />
“Fuck no! You heard what he said.” Spencer locked his phone and put it on the living room’s table. “Dicking someone else on top of dicking could cause glitches.”<br />
<br />
Nick stiffened, trying to move but only managing to jolt and spit pre. “Hey, that didn’t seem to bother you before.”<br />
<br />
“I didn’t know. You should have just explained that shit to me first instead of playing it cool and mysterious.”<br />
<br />
“I wasn’t playing it cool. I didn’t want to just come out and say ‘turn yourself into a dick’! But I should have, considering there’d be no difference with right now, dick!”<br />
<br />
Spencer flicked him off, before wincing at the pain. “Dude, it was your idea. Relax.”<br />
<br />
Angry, desperate, Nick focused his attention elsewhere.  “Sam, come on, just resume the old thing. You loved being my cock. I’ll take good care of you, promise.”<br />
<br />
Sam froze, like a deer in a headlight. He looked at the cock speaking to him as if he hadn’t known what the app did. <br />
<br />
Luckily for him, Spencer grabbed Sam’s hand before he had to reply. “No, don’t do that. That Hugo guy just talked about not overlaying the dicking uses.”<br />
<br />
Nick was starting to feel dizzy, the pulse of blood in him strong and his mind hazy with fear and excitement. “Rob’s not dicked or dicking anyone, he can try it.”<br />
<br />
“For the last time, Nick, we’re not messing around with the app.”<br />
<br />
“Fuck you, man! You dicked me without asking! Fuck-”<br />
<br />
Nick’s tirade cut short as Spencer finally muted him on his phone. The other two shot him an uncertain look. The playful, lazy atmosphere from before had long gone, dried out, evaporated, in favor of the heavy air of consequences they now dealt with. This was supposed to be just a moment of messing around!<br />
<br />
“It’s just two weeks,” Spencer said weakly. “He’ll be fine.”<br />
<br />
Though silent, Nick showed how annoyed the statement made him by jolting twice. With a wince, Spencer pulled up his pants and shoved him down so he could zip his jeans. <br />
<br />
“So, what do we do then?” Sam asked.<br />
<br />
“I got four months.”<br />
<br />
Sam and Spencer turned around, seeing that Rob had activated the roulette and gotten a self dicking result. Before they could say much of anything, his phone’s timer reached zero and blinded them with a flash of light. <br />
<br />
And Rob’s massive cock flopped on top of the couch’s cushions.</p>
