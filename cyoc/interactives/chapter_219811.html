<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Hmmmmmm,” Rachael mumbles as she is rousted from her slumber; with bleary eyes she sees the culprit of what woke her. Pawing her left arm is Shadow, her’s and Maisy’s cat from earth; Racheal soon found out that it was a hell cat in disguise. Shadow’s attention on Rachael’s arm was her tattoo of a Gorgon. Made of a special ink, the tattoo adopts the mood of its wearer and will at times move about of its own accord or at the command of its wearer. Right now the gorgon was displaying irritation as it tries to keep Shadow from tormenting them both.<br />
<br />
“Is this your way of saying you’re hungry,” Rachael picking up the cat as she disentangles herself from Maisy’s tight embrace. Getting up and out of the large bed, Rachael places shadow on the ground as she stretches herself while still a bit groggy. Feeling her wings twitch jars her awake as she sees she can start flexing them.<br />
“Cool,” Rachael nearly shouts as she manages to get them to flap before resting; “I can’t wait to tell Maisy.” Rachael then unfurls her wings, expanding them to their maximum length before quickly bringing them back end. Wanting to head outside and test her appendages, she is soon reminded by a certain black furred critter as it paws her leg.<br />
“Oh that’s right,” Rachael grinning; “breakfast. But first,” Rachael muttering as she makes a bee line to the bathroom; “this demon needs to pee.”<br />
<br />
<br />
***************************************************************************<br />
<br />
Maisy soon walks into the kitchen after waking up to see Rachael sitting on a stool sipping coffee; Shadow not far off, savaging his breakfast as the cook prepares breakfast.<br />
“Why didn’t you wake me,” Maisy sitting next to Rachael and pouring herself a coffee.<br />
“I wanted to,” Rachael looking excited; “but I want to surprise you!<br />
“Surprise me with what,” Maisy sipping her coffee; watching Rachael getting off of her stool and taking a few steps back.<br />
<br />
Viewing Racheal, Maisy is getting a good view of her blue labia being guarded by her equally blue clitoris. Rachael’s blue scales running up and down her body, the blue areolas with blue nipples and a tail with a spike thrashing about with glee. All parts Maisy has seen in many a pleasing angle; yet see was intrigued a Rachael’s excited grin. Maisy was soon sporting that same grin when Rachael started unfurling and furling her wings.<br />
“They finally kicked in,” Rachael sounding excited; “I really want to try them out.”<br />
“And try them out we shall,” Maisy smiling; “I know a wonderful spot on the volcano we can check out later. It has one hell of a view of Dis.”<br />
<br />
Maisy was about to speak further when a polite cough could be heard behind her. Turning around, Maisy finally notices the cook putting down two plates of eggs with what looks like to Rachael a slab of ham. Along with the meat was some toast with a bowl of mixed fruit.<br />
“Thank you Gunther,” Maisy taking a knife and starts cutting into the meat. “Spikey boar, rich in protein,” Maisy manages to add as she shovels a fork full into her mouth.<br />
“Isn’t all meat rich in protein,” Rachael also tucking into her breakfast; enjoying the gamey taste of the cooked meat; “and bad for you?”<br />
“We have fruit to balance it out,” Maisy pointing to the bowl; “try the cabbage apples, they taste nothing like apple or cabbage.”<br />
“Alright,” Rachael feeling adventurous. Taking one of the odd pieces of fruit, she bites into it and is surprised at the taste.<br />
“Tastes like a honeydew melon,” Rachael quickly polishing of the strange fruit; leaving behind a core full of seeds.<br />
“The cook another of the house staff,” Rachael taking a bite of scrambled egg; “What is his story?”<br />
<br />
**************************************************************************<br />
<br />
“I was once attached to the first German west Panzer division,” the cook speaking solemnly as Rachael quietly eats; “we were the crack unit that ran through Europe back at the start of World War Two. I originally volunteered as we thought we were given a raw deal when the Treaty of Versailles was forced on us. Hitler had a way of words,” The cook sounding sad; “he could whip a crowd into a frenzy over how it was the fault of this group or that group,” the cook gesticulating his words “and that we needed to take back what was stolen from us. So I volunteered just as I got out of culinary school. I figured I could remain behind the lines and help morale of my fellow solders with good food. And for a while it was good,” The cook pausing as he wipes a tear from his eye; “but that changed real quickly. Once we annexed France, I was soon stationed to assists the engineers as they built up the fortifications in Normandy. I think you can figure out where this is going,” the cook staring at Rachael.”<br />
<br />
“D-Day,” Rachael putting her fork down; “My grandfather told me of that day.” Rachael remembering the few years she had with her grandfather before he passed away from a stroke. A man her mother missed deeply, as he was the only family member who was not afraid to stand up to their domineering and later, abusive father.<br />
“He fought on Utah beach,” Rachael holding back tears; “he said that was the most scary day he ever endured.”<br />
“It was worse for us,” the cook sighing; “The weather was bad and I was struggling to keep up after the first salvo. I had to abandoned the mess hall and assist a machine gunner in one of the pill boxes,” the cook looking visibly pale; “apart from the training I received, I never fired a rifle or a side arm. At least not at a target shooting back. The officer got killed by a stray bullet and I had to man the gun emplacement soon after,” the cook now unable to hold back tears; “I unloaded a clip into a boat that just landed and opened its doors. I ended up killing ten Americans before an artillery shell landed and I wound up here.”<br />
<br />
“Gunther is here because he committed murder,” Maisy comforting the distraught man; “he has a sentence of a thousand years.”<br />
“Why so high,” Rachael looking concerned.<br />
“He killed several people;” Maisy answering; “his sentence would be higher, but he was only following orders from higher ups.”<br />
“From what I hear,” the cook calming down; “they got a worse punishment.”<br />
Rachael just nods; knowing that the man Gunther admired is suffering a punishment as a tree of woe in Lucifer’s garden.<br />
“You think I could talk to you father about him as well as Nigel,” Rachael asking as she helps clean up the plates.<br />
“It couldn’t hurt,” Maisy nodding; “but dad has a bit of an issue with Nazis; so don’t be surprised if your concerns fall on deaf ears.”<br />
<br />
***************************************************<br />
<br />
Maisy’s warning to Rachael about Lucifer’s ire towards Nazi’s was soon forgotten when they arrived at the court of Lucifer. Both seeing Enoch by the lord of hell’s throne as announces everyone who enters. Rachael notices how Maisy giggles as she watches her older brother pad back and forth along the raised dais. His furry tail swishing back and forth as he points to where each court petitioner should stand. It was soon a short murmer could be heard as Lady Astoroth and Rachael’s mother now Lady Atargatis. Both sporting matching neon green pasties that are covering their nipples and barely hiding their feminine entrance. While that alone in hell wasn’t out of the ordinary, what most demon’s were commenting on was the fact that Lady Astaroth had her hair dyed green and was styled into a punk rocker Mohawk.<br />
“Looks like my mom convinced your aunt to go with a new look,” Rachael whispering quietly.<br />
Maisy just nods as Belial enters the court in his usual fashion by barging in while eviscerating a human soul who managed to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.<br />
<br />
“Silence,” Enoch shouting; “His lordship Lucifer Morningstar commands your loyalty!” Enoch also shouting as both Lucifer and Lilith enter the court. Lucifer sitting on his throne while Lilith just sat on her snake tail as she wrapped it into a coil; ready to strike in defense if warranted.<br />
“Lucifer Morningstar shall now hear your petitions,” Enoch booming; his glare at the crowd implying that he was not liking being the Grand Chamberlain to his father.<br />
<br />
“Out of my way worm,” a shrill voice could be heard as Lamashtu kicked a small toad demon as he tried to approach the throne.<br />
“I am Lamashtu Morningstar. Duchess of Irkalla and I come to petition for the duchy of Malebolge,” the irate demon practically shouting.<br />
“You’re out of turn,” Enoch snarling; “get back and wait like everyone else!”<br />
“Muzzle it you flea bag,” Lamashtu snarling back; “just because dad foisted power on you doesn’t mean you can relegate me with the half breeds out of spite!”<br />
<br />
“Same old Lamashtu,” Maisy shouting; “always thinking she can win a fighting with bigotry and insults!”<br />
“You watch your tongue,” Lamashtu glaring at her younger sister; “Dad’s favorite or not, I will thrash you if get lippy with me.”<br />
“Do so at your own peril,” Enoch getting between the two; already holding a couple throwing blades and willing to use them if anyone dares to draw a blade in Lucifer’s court; “back off sister. Now!”<br />
“Just like you to come to Miasma’s defense,” Lamashtu spitting at her brother’s forepaws; “as well as the defense of everyone else who isn’t a pure demon!”<br />
“You go too far Lamashtu,” Maisy shouting; “everyone here knows you have an issue with just about everybody. Whether they took a human as a mate or they are the offspring of a human demon bonding. News flash you stuck up bitch,” Maisy shouting; “we are offspring of a human demon bonding. Or have you forgotten that our mother,” Maisy pointing to Queen Lilith; was once human. And the first human to become a demon! Does that mean she is also a half breed as you so like to spout with you usual venom of hate?”<br />
“Truer words have never been spoken,” Belial snorting in approval; “Some of the best demon’s I know were once human. Last I checked once a human agrees to the vows after going through the ritual, they are demon like everyone else here in hell.”<br />
<br />
“If all you came her for was to pick a fight over personal beliefs,” Lilith speaking calmly; “then I am disappointed in you my daughter. Please leave before you force your father to do something he will no doubt regret,” Lilith staring at her daughter with a look of disapproval.<br />
“This is not over,” Lamashtu spat; “I am owed more than just running some filthy kennels.” Lamashtu glaring at Enoch as she storms out of the throne room.<br />
<br />
<br />
Court soon resumed as soon as Lamashtu left. Belial helping up the toad demon who was stunned at the outburst soon managed to stumble through his complaint. Being a small affair, Lucifer was quick to defer it to Enoch as he was Chief of Justice and the manner of a few stolen spiked boars was best suited for him. Court droned on like this for a few more minutes. Neither Maisy nor Rachael noticed the small kobold demon slinking his way to Rachael. When he got within reaching distance for his short stature he tried to place a three clawed hand on Rachael’s scaly rear end, muttering about wanting to ‘tapped dat ass’.<br />
<br />
When out of nowhere, either it being a sixth sense or something else; Rachael quickly whips around and in one swift move snaps the kobold’s arm; breaking it at the elbow. Its screams quickly caused court to be interrupted as Rachael then grabs the demon by the throat.<br />
“Who said you could touch me,” Rachael screaming; “I am Lady Tenebra, betrothed to Lady Miasma Morningstar. So I say again,” Rachael bringing the small frighten creature closer; her prehensile tail pressing on his abdomen, the spike ready to pierce skin. “Who are you?”<br />
<br />
“Braxis,” Enoch shouting; “you want to get banished back to sulphur mines?”<br />
“No my lord,” the Kobold squeaking; “please let me go lady, I have been duly chastened.”<br />
“We’ll see about that,” Rachael tossing the Kobold towards the center of the room; the demon inadvertently hitting a human waiter serving refreshments. Both the kobold and human tumble to the floor in a heap, causing several demon court petitioners to erupt with laughter.<br />
“Touch me again,” Rachael glaring at the Kobold as he gets up holding his broken arm, her tail thrashing aggressively; “and I’ll perforate your liver!”<br />
“Leave now Braxis,” Enoch booming; the kobold needing no other encouragement just scampers out as he tries to hold back tears.<br />
“Court politics in hell is never dull,” Maisy embracing Rachael; “someone always leaves with a broken limb, bleeding or worse.”<br />
“I wanted to kill him,” Rachael looking serious; keeping her voice low so as no one could hear.<br />
“You warned him and that was enough,” Maisy quietly whispering; “Aunt Astaroth or any of my sisters would have just snapped his neck for the stunt he tried to pull on you.”</p>
