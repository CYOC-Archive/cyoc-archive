<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen would spend the next few months swapping legs around the school, and pushing the limits of what she could play with. She&#39;d been both male and female, short and tall, she&#39;d even come into school as a centaur, both male and female. Hell if she could find an elephant she&#39;d even try that, just for kicks, but by now she had gotten board, her ever revolving lower half wasn&#39;t interesting anymore, so she decided to try something.<br />
<br />
The curse that Kyle had lain upon her was the cause of this, but he&#39;d made himself immune to swapping, or did he? She wasn&#39;t sure, saying he was immune to the effects of the curse was smart of him, but also very vague, so did it stop her from swapping with him. She figured that she could at least try, but just swapping legs with him wasn&#39;t enough for her.<br />
<br />
She started watching him, quietly and intently, who could she swap with him that would make him uncomfortable? She could always go after his mom, but that would be too cliché, she could go after a really fat girl, or some big jock guy, but she wanted to make it really awkward for him. So she watched and waited, looking for a target that she would swap with then try to swap with Kyle.<br />
<br />
Kyle wasn&#39;t very subtle about what he liked in girls in the school, but there was one woman in particular that he really couldn&#39;t stop staring at. He had a particular obsession with one of the faculty, Mrs. Durand, the French teacher, she was cute as far as Jen was concerned, but she wasn&#39;t the &#39;hot&#39; teacher, that was Mrs. Lorenza, the spanish teacher. Kyle seemed to be attracted to tall women, Mrs. Durand stood at an above average seven feet, a tall and imposing woman, she had a beautiful face, but wore her hair and a pair of glasses that showed she meant business. She hid her curves, a subtle hourglass, under modest plain dress that was purposely chosen to hid them, so she would be taken more seriously, and it worked.<br />
<br />
Kyle wouldn&#39;t take his eyes off her, and Jen could tell he found her attractive, so she set to work. She swapped out Durand&#39;s legs, she found their height nice, but she didn&#39;t want to stay that tall, during a restroom she would check out her temporary lower half, her hips were a little wider than her original ones, but her legs went on for days. Jen smiled, hoping that her plan would work, she would get even with Kyle for his curse this afternoon.<br />
<br />
Jen spotted Kyle after school and walked over to him. “Hey Kyle!”<br />
<br />
“Oh, hi Jen....” He sneared. “Nice legs.” <br />
<br />
“Oh, I do enjoy the height.”<br />
<br />
“You should put those back.”<br />
<br />
“Why so you can stare at them more?”<br />
<br />
“That&#39;s not the point.”<br />
<br />
“Oh but it is, see I know you want Mrs. Durand, so I figured I would give you a show.”<br />
<br />
“How is this?”<br />
<br />
“Well, I do know you want these legs, so I think you look pretty with them.” Jen said, in an instant Kyle shot up, he had been only five feet tall, but with his new lower half he now stood at six foot six inches, not that he was happy, in fact he was shocked as he looked down at his new lower half, then back at Jen, then back to his new lower half. “HOW?” <br />
<br />
“Oh, you said you&#39;d be immune to the curse, but not that you couldn&#39;t be swapped, I just had a hunch. Now, Transform or Dare.” Jen said. “I was right once, we&#39;ll see if I&#39;m right twice.”<br />
<br />
“DARE!” Kyle reacted quickly.<br />
<br />
“Okay then, for your dare, first you&#39;ll curse me back, when I say transform you&#39;ll transform me so that all of your curses affects, both on myself and everyone I swapped are reversed, except for you, and so that I no longer carry that curse, you won&#39;t do anything else, second, from now on, you&#39;ll dress your lower half in very tight or revealing clothing, and only the high heels, usually in stilletos, no one will ever go after you for violating dress code. Third, if you get the curse again, you&#39;ll find yourself very reluctant to get rid of that lower half, even if you want to.” <br />
<br />
Jen looked at him as he turned red with frustration, he complied, the only thing he could do, spitting out the curse as Jen demanded of him, after Kyle was done, Jen&#39;s body returned to normal. <br />
<br />
“Now, since you liked the idea so much, you can walk around with a copy of those sexy legs you wanted so much! Who needs Mrs. Durand when you can look at her legs on yourself?” Jen laughed and walked away from a very upset Kyle as he stood with his new long, luxurious, female legs. He eventually turned to walk home, hearing the clopping of the heels that Durand always wore, feeling her hips sway back and forth, he tried to walk differently, but his new lower half&#39;s natural motions kept reminding him that he was now a woman. <br />
<br />
Kyle seethed with rage as he tried to figure out how to get back at Jen, but he didn&#39;t have the curse anymore, and he&#39;d just have to live with the fact that he may never have the curse again. He was now officially stuck with the legs of the woman he had fantasized about dominating him. He shuddered as he walked home, the constant rhythmic motion of his new lower half bothering him the entire way home.</p>
