<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was the first day of October, and Colin was going to school. He had a flu last week, and he still felt a little bit weak, but he did not want to miss too much from the classes. He was 14 years old, with a slim and athletic body, light brown hair with brown eyes, and he was the smallest guy in his class. As he was going through the city, he passed near to a great building. Colin did not knew, but this building was the headquarter of GenLab inc., where the ape virus was developed. Today as he passed near to it, he saw that someone ran out of the building naked. He seemed like someone who is trying to escape from somewhere. The guy was a handsome young man about 20 years old. The naked guy did not looked around just ran, and he bumped into Colin. They both fall to the ground, and from the closer looked, Colin could establish that there is something wrong with the naked guy: he was too hairy for a young man. The guy’s shins, feet, hands and forearms were covered in a thick layer of hair, and some pelt was covering his chest. The other parts of his body was hairy too, and his face was covered in a thick stubble as well. He had a little stub at his rear, almost like a little tail. The naked guy was panting heavily, and looked straight into Colin’s eyes:<br />
&quot;Pl...please he-he-elp mmee&quot; he said, than he started to cough, straight on Colin’s face.<br />
That was when men in white lab coats ran out of the building &quot;There he is, get him&quot; they shouted. The naked guy looked back, jumped up and ran away. <br />
<br />
Colin was shocked, he did not knew what has happened. He took out a handkerchief from his pocket, and cleaned the spittle of his face. Than he looked at his clock, he was late, so he started to run to school, thinking about what happened.<br />
<br />
Two days later...<br />
<br />
It was the last class, math. Colin was just copying the formulas, he wanted to leave as soon as possible. Today he was wearing jeans and a yellow polo shirt. As the minutes passed, he started to feel a bit strange, a bit warm, and he felt he was sweating. The guy who was sitting next to him, his best friend, Mark, realized it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Colin, are you okay?&quot; He whispered, as Colin looked at him. Mark was surprized when he looked at Colin: long wavy hairs were poking out of Colin’s shirt, that were going up until his friends&#39; Adams apple. &quot;Woah man, you are an early bloomer, I just realise now how hairy your chest is&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you talking about&quot; asked Colin. He never had a hairy chest, and he did not expected it, as no one had any chest hair in his family. He touched his neck, and he felt it with his hands &quot;What the...&quot; he whispered. <br />
<br />
That was when the bell rang, so Colin could rush to the toilet, where he saw the hair creeping up his throat. He buttoned down one more button of his T-shirt, and examined his chest: the hair started between his pecks, and was started to cover his upper chest, almost reaching his shoulders. What shall he do now, what is it? Shall he show it a doctor? Colin decided to run home for now, and first he wanted to shave it off. He buttoned up his shirt, to hide his chest, but as he was rushing home, he felt it sweating, itching, and warm as hell, so he had to release at least three buttons. He knew people were staring at him, and he felt ashamed. As he arrived home, he run into the bathroom, and looked into the mirror. That was when he saw the horror of his life: his chest hair was turned into fur, and covered his whole neck. He could not believe his eyes, as he realised the between his shirt and his jaw he is more animal then man. He touched the soft brown fur on his neck, it felt silky. He took off his shirt, and he saw, that the same fur was growing between his packs and on his upper chest and shoulders, partly covering his upper back as well. He took his fathers&#39; razor in panic, and started to shave with a trembling hands. When he finished, he saw little stubbles stayed behind, and to his horror he saw them growing. After a minute his upper chest and neck was darker from the regrowing hair, and as five minutes passed he looked like a hairy guy. After half an hour, he looked like he never shaved the hair off. Colin started to cry...</p>
