<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Gorge and Norman arrived at the control room to a very unusual sight; Frank Marshall and Mac Blocker were wrestling on the floor.  No, on second glance, that was what it looked like from behind the ring of bears and Anton and Billy.  Mac and Frank were fucking.<br />
<br />
George whispered into one of the bear’s ears, “What’s happened here?  Last I knew, Frank wanted to tear Mac’s head off.”<br />
<br />
Ian Scott, the bear George was talking to whispered into George’s ear.  “They went at it.  They were viciously beating the tar out of each other.  There was a lot of biting and clawing and as you can see, there are bits of fur everywhere.  We started to separate them, but they both told us to stay out of it.  <br />
<br />
Marshall finally wrestled Mac to the ground just a few minutes ago, he was on top of Mac and was growling and cursing in his face and then Mac just up and kissed him.  For a minute there, Frank looked really confused and got a dumb look on his face, then Mac wrapped his arms around him and kissed him again.  Then they started getting really passionate; rubbing and licking and talking dirty to each other.  You arrived just as Frank started humping Mac.”<br />
<br />
Gorge softly chuckled, “I guess they’ve worked their differences out.  I notice you boys all seem just a bit turned on by the show.”  George looked around; a couple of the black bears were breathing hard and fisting their cocks rapidly. <br />
<br />
“Yeah, that’s the weird part; since we’ve been changed, sex seems to just be sex.  It’s like our brains have been rewired.  I get just as hard thinkin’ about fuckin’ men as I do thinking about fuckin’ women.”  Ian said as he fondled his cock unconsciously and looked at George with desire.<br />
<br />
“Later, Ian.  You me and ‘The Big Guy’ Norman over here, OK?”  George motioned his thumb behind him indicating the Kodiak who was embracing George from behind and watching, raptly, the show before him with his big furry head hung over George’s right shoulder.  George flashed the cub, Ian, a wide grin.<br />
<br />
Ian grinned back.  “OK, later.”  Ian said.  “I think I’m beginning to see it Mac’s way.  I wasn’t too thrilled to be changed, but now that I am…” Ian was now stroking his cock.<br />
<br />
George rested a big paw on Ian’s right arm and stopped him from masturbating.  <br />
<br />
“Ian, try to focus, I know it’s hard with all the male pheromones in this tiny room.  Hell, I’d like nothing better than an all out orgy right now, but we’ve got work to do and we can’t allow sex to distract us.  I think we should leave these two alone, we’ve got someone we have to rescue.   Pass the word and let’s go.”  George said.  “Oh and grab the emergency battering ram from the storage room over there.”  George indicated a small closet that had emergency fire equipment and other emergency supplies.<br />
<br />
Reluctantly the bears with Billy, Anton and Norman filed out of the room, most of them taking a last peek at the writhing coupled pair as they went.  Ian propped the battering ram on his shoulder like a rifle.  George reflected that the solid steel bar with the square steel plate and handles usually took four to six strong men to lift and Ian casually carried it.  What powerful beasts they had all become!<br />
<br />
The bestial, lustful grunts, growls and groans from the room faded as the crew moved down the corridor.  The bearmen were all talking about the sex and the smell of his brother bear’s pre-come was making George horny again.  He shook his great shaggy head to clear his thoughts; he had work to do.<br />
<br />
Soon the group reached the door.  The badger man was pacing back and forth, growling.<br />
<br />
George came to the door.  “OK, buddy, stand back.”<br />
<br />
The badger responded with a nod and moved away from the door.<br />
<br />
“Billy, Anton, keep watch on the both directions of the corridor.”  George said and the squirrel and the puma moved in opposite directions, about fifty feet from the door and stet up a watch.<br />
<br />
There were six handles on the ram and six burly bears, including the biggest pair being George and Norman at the back, swung the battering ram at the door.  Within minutes the door bent and then broke, freeing the trapped badger.<br />
<br />
The small group cheered and the badger was suddenly surrounded and was being hugged. <br />
<br />
“You saved me!  You saved me!  Thank you!”   The badgerman said.<br />
<br />
“What’s your name, son?”  George asked.<br />
<br />
“Name?  I don’t have a name.”  The badgerman said.<br />
<br />
“Can we call you Rusty?”  George asked.<br />
<br />
“Mmmmmm… RU-sty…” The badgerman pondered.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, Rus-ty” George repeated.<br />
<br />
“Rus-ty… Ru-sty… I like Rus-ty… what does it mean?”  The badgerman asked.<br />
<br />
“Well, your black fur is kinda a little reddish brown, sort of the color of rust.  I thought it was a good name, do you like it.”  George said.<br />
<br />
“Yes… my name is Rusty!”  The badger seemed happy to have the name.<br />
<br />
“Then Rusty it is!”  George smiled and then, feeling the absence of his huge cub, looked around for Norman.<br />
<br />
Norman had wandered off and when he returned a few minutes later, he had in his huge paws George’s ripped uniform pants and his wallet.<br />
<br />
“Here, Papa, I was taking this to you and dropped it when I was changing.”  Norm said and handed George the wallet.  <br />
<br />
Norman kept the pants and snuffled at the crotch.  George smiled at the big kid, what a handsome bear he was; the change seemed to have given Norman something more than he had as a human.  Norman seemed more confident, more adult and certainly far sexier; not that George had ever noticed how sexy men were before this last evening.  In retrospect, thinking about the pimply, twenty something kid Norman had been compared to the great sexy hunk of a bear he was now, George could see the benefits the change had given both him and Norman.  George was truly a lucky bear; Norman would be a good lover.<br />
<br />
George looked through the tiny wallet, well, tiny in his huge paws.   Credit cards, money, licenses and ID cards; all useless now, but he’d keep it; it was a link to who he used to be and reminded him of his promise to Francis.  If he could reach an ATM, he’d transfer all his funds into an account.  Hell, he didn’t need the money anymore, perhaps even Norman could help him with that.  Norman was probably some kinda genius with computers, like the ‘Stephen Hawking’ of computer hackers.<br />
<br />
“Well, I don’t seem to have any pockets, so I’m gonna have to improvise.” George said with a chuckle. <br />
<br />
George looked around and found security guard belts in the lockers in one of the shower rooms on this level.  He linked three of them together and was able to fit them around his huge waist.  He stuffed his wallet into one of the leather cases attached to the belt.<br />
<br />
“OK, listen up guys.  Our first priority is getting out of here.  Whether you believe Blocker or not about us all being rounded up for experiments, the fact of the matter is that there’s no food and very little water here and the air is gonna get just a bit stale soon.  We’ve got to get out of here, our lives depend on it.”  George said, his old command presence returning to him as if he’d never laid it aside.  The cubs took to his command as easily as they had to Marshall’s.  “How we’re going to get out of here is something I think we need to discuss.”<br />
<br />
Norman shambled over to George and whispered in his ear.<br />
<br />
“Oh, is that so?”  George said in response to Norman.  “How about you explain that to the guys, perhaps this is going to be easier than I thought!”<br />
<br />
Norman stepped up to address the others, shyly.  Being a computer geek means that usually you don’t really develop good communication skills.  You interact with the computer more often than you do with actual living beings.  Norman could be quite eloquent in e-mails, but in talking he was quiet and timid, he only spoke well with those he knew and loved, like George, of course. <br />
<br />
Norman loved George more than anyone in his whole life and if George wanted him to speak, he would.  Taking a nervous glance back at George and George returning his glance with a fanged smile, a wink, a reassuring pat on the shoulder and a whispered, “Go on, Son, you’ll do just fine” Norman cleared his throat and began to tell everyone what he had in mind.</p>
