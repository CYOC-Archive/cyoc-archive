<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The first thing that made itself apparent was the difference in the world around you. Where before you had been of average size, you now felt dwindled compared to everything else around you. That pool full of chocolate beside you had once looked like any sort of indoor pool, but now? It was like some sort of wide, stretch of mocha colored sea. As you stood in bewilderment,the taste of chocolate came to make itself known in your mouth despite nothing currently being inside. You stood in a bit of confusion as it would slowly start to make sense what had happened to you. Reluctant to face the truth of the current events, you slowly allowed your vision to gaze down.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the...&quot;<br />
<br />
The sight of a pudgy child&#39;s body awaited you, your smaller arms feelings around your younger body before noticing that they to had turned a dark brown color. But you had to know one thing at the expense to yourself. With a quivering arm, you shoved your thumb in your mouth and began to suck. The tongue explored every side and angle of your digit while wanting to cringe at the taste. It was chocolate. That woman hadn&#39;t just given birth to you, but made you into a chocolate person just as she was! The sudden reduction in age was enough to make you want to scream and shout but fought back against it. You needed a mirror, something to see if this was real or not. The pool wasn&#39;t much help as you would look around for something else. <br />
<br />
Even getting around in this new body would take some getting used to. While you could thankfully stand upright, your legs not only took much shorter steps than before but lacked the fine balance that most adults had, as if to mock what had once came so naturally. The room around you was pretty barren save for the obvious pool, but your chocolate eyes had caught a reflection of light coming off of a mirror a little ways west, near the entrance of the room. It was on the wall, but that nearby stool and table that were nearby could provide you with a way up. You removed your thumb from your mouth, a feat done more easily said than done, and would begin your journey there.<br />
<br />
Your little feet waddled away, unable to shake this feeling of carrying extra weight despite nothing being present. God, you were getting winded just by thinking of how you were going to get the stool to the table. Eventually you would sit down and have to take a break despite being so far away from your destination. The frustration in you was slowly getting to you, fists beginning to ball themselves. This wasn&#39;t fair! How were you supposed to get there like this? A thought crossed your mind while noticing that chocolate taste again, your thumb having returned to your mouth. You again removed it while doing your best to ignore the taste and carefully dropped on all fours. The cold ground felt nice against your warm body, although it wasn&#39;t like you had a real choice if you wanted to get there within the hour. You placed one hand outwards and the opposite leg in the same direction while you moved across the pool floor.<br />
<br />
After arriving at the stool, your arms pushed themselves up onto two feet again, wobbling all the way, and would slowly begin to force the loose stool across to the lip of the table. Your reduced strength had made this go from an effortless job into something that took most of your strength to do so. The sound of the bottom of the legs scraping across the floor could be heard for a minute or so while you pushed it into place, then quickly would begin to climb up the steps one at a time.<br />
<br />
Somehow, the table had managed to hold you, legs dangling while you used what little strength you had left and rolled into the table, trying to catch your breath. Your eyes moved over to the mirror and would catch a glimpse at what you wanted to see, or rather what you had so desperately not.<br />
<br />
Staring at you was a baby boy, maybe a few years or so old. His messy, curly hair was kept in a wavy yet controlled poof that seemed to never stray far. His face would be one of amazement, his cute fingers balled as a thumb, once again, had been forced into his mouth. Below that tummy  would be a chocolate diaper, the innate details almost like something from a master sculptor as the folds and material felt soft despite the hardened texture. Yet something would stir within, your hands trembling before something else would catch your attention as they would slowly unfurl from your back.<br />
<br />
A pair of beautiful wings would remain at the boys side, every quill almost lifelike, as if it had been an actual feather dipped in chocolate. As if to confirm your fears, a hand reached to brush against the left most wing as a pleasing sensation made itself known to you. It reacted to your touch as your eyes would begin to fight against the warm tears that were beginning to spill. <br />
<br />
This couldn&#39;t be real...You weren&#39;t some chocolate freak like this! Out of instinct, you realized there was one last way to check if you weren&#39;t in some lust driven hallucination. You looked back down to your diaper and would slowly undo the latches by your sides until it gave away. And what a surprise that would be in store.<br />
<br />
Underneath the diaper, twitching at the cool air as it felt the difference in temperature, would be a large cock and two balls resting behind it. They had appeared larger than what you had possessed before, much larger. It was almost cartoonish at how it was almost half of your own height. Your hands gentle teased it out of awe and soon would come to regret such an action. It would upset your balance as you felt wave after wave of pleasure cause havoc in your smaller body. In your chocolate addled mental haze, the fact would make itself true to you:<br />
<br />
You had become some kind of chocolate baby freak with wings!<br />
<br />
You couldn&#39;t fight back against what came natural and would feel your bottom lip quiver. &quot;Wh-Wha...Ah-I DON&#39;T WANNA BE A BABY!&quot; You screamed, tears flowing down your cheeks as you sat and allowed yourself to wallow in your ruined state. You wanted to walk like normal, to do things that somebody your age did, anything but be stuck like some infant with a huge chocolate cock. Your tantrum would cause your arms to lash out at anything nearby. The decorations of the table being pushed off and crashing onto the floor with a sudden noise.<br />
<br />
As your tantrum continued, the mirror would show a silhouette of somebody approaching the table, like who had heard the sounds of various things breaking and the noise of a baby crying.</p>
