<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Colin paced his dorm, his mind a maelstrom of anger and sadness.  This technology promised to answer all of his problems; he need only pick a solution.  He could exact his revenge on Logan for abandoning him and bring all the popular guys down to size maybe even enhance himself in the process to further their humiliation.  He envisioned them all as wimpy, timid kids and himself as the big man on campus.  He could have power, popularity, muscle and chicks.  He drooled at the thoughts, the potential, and the possibilities.  He couldn’t forgive the other students for what they did to him but he could forget.  With the chip he would be able to alter his mind and memories, perhaps erase all memory of being friends with Logan to quench his rage, loss and desire for revenge.  He could change Logan back to the way he was so they could be friends again but is that a true friendship, controlling your friend in such a way?  Alternatively he could even, and he gulped at the thought, transform himself into someone like Logan and the others, then he would have his friend back without needing to mess with Logan’s mind or body.  <br />
After hours of staring at the stolen technology and considering the possibilities Colin reached a decision.  Revenge was beneath him he decided and drinking from Lethe to escape his pain was cowardly.  He couldn’t change Logan in such a way either.  He decided friendship was what was most important to him and made plans to change himself into someone Logan would want to be friends with.  Scouring the dorms like a ninja Colin managed to find trace samples of DNA from the usual partygoers including Logan.  Still aghast at what he was doing he returned to his dorm with the spoils.<br />
He set to work immediately splicing a sample of his DNA with some of Logan’s and the others.  He altered the physical appearance to be more masculine with some features stolen from Logan and his new friends.  He lowered the intelligence, the inhibitions and changed the activities from studying to parting, flirting, working out and of course having sex.  He increased social skills and energy to near max, heightened libido and wildness and with a few final clicks and touch ups the blue print was complete.  By the time his deliberating and preparing were finished it was very late just around the time Logan would be ready to party, perfect.  So eager to be with his friend again he wasted no time calling Logan and asking him to come over to his dorm to hang out in about 15 minutes, he promised Logan that he would find a Colin to be a new man and they could do whatever he wanted even drinking until they blacked out.  Hanging up the phone, Colin picked up the freshly made chip and swallowed it, then waited.  And he waited.  No growth spurt, no overpowering urge to party, nothing.  The chip must be a dud.  Colin hung his head, torn between tears and relief before realizing that Logan would still be knocking on his door any second now and expecting the ‘changed’ Colin.  He quickly hid all the stolen devices and readied himself; even if the chip didn’t work he was still going to try to be the friend Logan wanted.<br />
*Knock knock!* Colin jumped up and opened the door letting a stumbling Logan in.  He was wearing only tight shorts exposing a sizeable package and a backpack.  His exposed chest was moderately tan, with the slight outline of a 6 pack poking through a developing beer belly covered in a decent trail.  His pecs bulged out, smooth and firm.  He had broad shoulders ending in powerful arms and long thick legs covered in a dusting of dark hair that carried him up to a little over 6 foot.  His face was sculpted, angular but relaxed with a goofy expression and blue-green eyes that alternated between seeming vacant and teeming with uncontrollable energy.  This was topped off by a slight brown shadow and a short matt of light brown hair.  He plopped down on a chair putting his size 14 feet in the adjacent seat before opening his backpack revealing two bottles of Jack Daniels one already looking a bit used, the question as to where it went answered by Logan’s face.<br />
“Shit man!”  Logan bellowed in his deep, slightly drunk voice.  “Place still looks prissy.  You said on the phone you was over the pussy shit?”  Colin frowned, Logan was no stranger to putting Colin down, he had always been overly opinionated and critical but lately he was just sadistic when it came to him.<br />
	“Fuck man, I know, this ain’t fit for me, but I’m jacking it up soon bro.”  He responded to his amazement as he felt a slight tingle.  Where had that come from?  He never cursed, never used slang and never spoke in such a laid-back tone… it changed the sound of his voice altogether, made Colin sound like Logan.  The tingling intensified a bit and for a moment he saw a panorama of party images flashing through his mind but it was over before he could really analyze them.  Still, he was left with a tight feeling in his shoes especially and itchiness all over.<br />
“Sweet bro.”  He nodded approvingly and pulled out the bottle from before, opening it and pouring two small glasses; glasses that he found in Colin’s room but he didn’t remember ever getting shot glasses.  He dismissed it as maybe him or his friends came in at some point and left them.  Logan downed his glass quickly, belched and handed Colin one.  Normally he’d refuse but he swore to himself he tried to make this work.  There was more to it though, he wanted to drink that glass, craved it somehow in a way he never had, it was as if the switch that everyone else already had on finally clicked for him.  The moment the alcohol touched his lips it was ecstasy, his body went into autopilot, he put down the glass and momentarily gave a very Logan-like goofy grin not feeling the stubble poking in along his chin or that his eyes were glazing over, becoming a familiar blue-green.  Colin let out a deep belch unlike any he had ever managed before but he just grinned and him and Logan laughed like the good friends they once were and poured two more shots.  Logan was just happy to have his friend finally enjoying himself.<br />
In his arrogance Colin assumed he understood the chip as well as the creators, he never programmed a trigger into the chip so it should have been dormant indefinitely but Logan’s tainted personality had corrupted the chip and the more he acted like Logan the more the blue print, slightly modified, began to overshadow him.  Colin failed to notice that with each sip his hair grew a shade darker, the stubble thickened and his body began to change taking his mind with it.  <br />
“Fucking sweet poster bro!”  Logan exclaimed seeing several posters of hot girls on the walls and ceilings that Colin didn’t remember.  However, as Colin looked at them he realized they were his perfect vision of sexiness, he vaguely even remembered picking them up and hanging them up even thought he couldn’t reach the ceiling, yet.  As he stared at the posters he felt himself getting more than a little turned on, letting out a suppressed moan that caused Logan to laugh and slap his friend on the back.  “C’mon man, what you really think of her?”<br />
“She’s fucking hot bro, I’d tap that!”  Again Colin was caught by surprise by his own words but Logan was thrilled his friend was finally seeing his side of things.  A little scared of what was going on Colin tried to draw his friends attention away from the posters and back to the bottle which they resumed empting.  <br />
Gradually Logan and Colin started to twiddle away at Jack, which was in turn twiddling away at Colin.  Colin was becoming more and more relaxed and at ease even though by now he had realized the chip was kicking in after all.  He thought of trying to switch it off before the changes progressed but part of him was determined to see this through and a growing part of his mind was loving what he was becoming, he was getting the attractiveness and the freedom he always envied.  His attention was grabbed by his feet which were now aching; he quickly removed his shoes and socks and watched in fascination as his feet developed before his eyes, creeping across the floor as they expanded into size 14.  He pulled up his jeans enough to see that his toothpick legs weren’t so thin anymore, in fact he watched as they continue to swell bulging into the respectable legs of someone who runs on a regular basis.  The calves were firm and toned and his legs were now covered in a coat of brown hairs that extended up into his pants where he knew another transformation was happening or would soon happen.  “Sweet!”  He heard himself blurting out.  Logan gave no response, he wasn’t drunk enough to not notice his friend becoming a true college boy before his eyes but he was drunk enough not to care and as the night progressed his memories of his friend seemed to blur.  The chip was modifying reality and in this timeline Colin and Logan never grew apart.  All around them the dorm changed little by little, Colin’s wardrobe changed, even the jeans he was wearing became baggy cargos giving his growing package room to breathe and letting the world see his thick legs.<br />
“It’s just us guys man lose the shirt, show off a little, when we go get the babes later they wanna see your muscles not your ugly face.”  Colin hesitantly obliged, revealing his slim chest.  But as they watched his chest rippled like rough waters.  The surface of his skin almost seemed to boil as a tan spread across his body, almost identical to Logan’s, maybe even darker.  His chest lurched out, two bulging pecs appeared from no where and his abs squeezed into a six pack.  Colin groaned, the pain was intense and the sounds of his body reshaping made it worse.  One by one little brown hairs appeared on his stomach, Colin tried to pluck them at first but they sped up, exploding out in rapid succession until he had a thick, happy trail of brown hairs around his belly button, nicely accenting his new abs.  He found when he recovered that he was staring up at the poster and felt a wave of hormones wash over him, all the horniness and thrill the other guys felt just hit him.  His body was wracked with pleasure as his equipment rapidly expanded to 8 inches hard.  At the same time he felt a suction in his mind, like someone pulled the plug off the drain, he tried to hold on to his vocabulary, his intelligence, his rationality but it was like sand through his hands sliding into oblivion, the new him wouldn’t need any of it.  At the same time knowledge of how to gives chicks the ride of their lives, how to avoid hangovers, how to be a guy was pushing in and nothing he could do could stop the invasion as a flurry of curses and sex positions rushed to fill the void his big brain left behind.<br />
“Fuck, I changed my mind bro I don’t want… don’t want to be… oh God… ughhhhh!”  Colin was cut off by his deepening voice and changing arms.  The change brought him down to all fours where he quivered feebly as Logan looked on with curiosity.  The wave broke from his chest shooting down across both arms warping them to ridiculous proportions, far larger than even Logan’s.  His biceps popped out like spring daisies, covered in a good amount of hair and bulging veins.  They flexed and unflexed uncontrollably as his arms extended across the ground widening his stance.  When Colin stood up and the pain dulled down he was now standing at 6”2.  “Logan I’m scared get me… get me… another fucking glass bro!”  Colin shouted in his booming voice.  Logan quickly complied but instead of drinking it Colin splashed it over his own face than walked over to the mirror, a new swagger in his step.  The images of the parties, the images that included the new him were now overwhelming, the old Colin sat in a dark corner of his mind, watching his body but not in control, all he could do was hold on to what he had.  He wiped his face in the mirror watching as he seemed to almost be wiping away the old him, his eyes were now a bright blue-green, his face angular and attractive in masculine way and his hair was pulling in and darkening.  He felt with a twinge of satisfaction the goatee growing and rubbed it, loving the feel.  The old Colin was losing but he finally had his friend back, if this is what it took, he gladly make the sacrifice.  With a final mental smile horridly mirrored by the dopey smile on his flesh face, Colin submitted.  The room twisted all at once, the bed was replaced by two, the books replaced by photo albums showing him and Logan making fools of themselves at the parties, even the stolen chips and computer were replaced a hidden cache of beer making a reversion impossible.  Colin was no more.<br />
“Corey get yo ass up bro we gotta meet our dates soon!”  Corey, shook his head, a dream of being some dorky kid quickly fading from his inebriated mind.  He slid on some sandals and an unbuttoned shit before looking himself over in the mirror one last time.  Him and Logan could be brothers except Corey was a little taller and bulkier, some assumed they were and to each other they were like brothers.  He shook his head to get his brown hair into that perfect messy look and gave himself a cocky grin and a thumbs up.<br />
“Wait bro one last thing!”  He grabbed two shot glasses, filled them and handed one to Logan.  “Bottoms up, to best friends!”  They downed the glasses and burped in unison.  “Sweet!”  They both yelled before running out into the night to meet the girls…</p>
