<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Not liking what he was hinting at and feeling overwhelmed at him grabbing my hand I yelped “I have to go!” turned around and ran out of the hut and back to the bar.<br />
<br />
With tears steaming down my cheeks I stormed over to the bar hut and swiftly went into the back room where we as employees kept our changes of clothes. Going to my locker I opened it and got out my black workout shorts and black t-shirt that I knew from implanted memories I had worn to work that day. Slipping the outfit on as more tears streamed off my face I wiped them away and looked at myself in a small wall mirror with a smile. I still looked like a beautiful woman and heck I was a beautiful women but now it would be harder for men to objectify and ogle me in this outfit.<br />
<br />
Coming into the locker room was my friend Claire who wanted to check on me after seeing how distraught I was going back from the drink delivery. Seeing me in my shorts and t-shirt and with tears running down my face brought a look of surprise to her face. “Penny what are you doing you can’t go out looking like that the management won’t allow it” What followed was an emotion driven back-and-forth between the two of us as I relayed what had happened to me at the hut and even though Claire sympathized with me she knew and told me so that those types of situations came with the job and that I would have to get used to them. She also knew that I didn’t like wearing bikini’s and that I was more of a tomboy then a girly-girl but again it was part of the job and I according to her really needed this job. After a hug shared between the two of us Claire informed me that I needed to get back to work and that included being in my uniform as she exited the room. I cried the whole time as I took off my shorts to reveal the bikini bottom and  female anatomy that I wished wouldn’t be there and then took off my shirt with slow trepidation wanting above all else to have my male chest back but it was not to be as the female hips, abdomen, and bikini top over my breasts slowly revealed themselves to my muffled sobs. As I pulled the tight shirt over my breasts it became stuck in the curve and I had to yank it hard to dislodge it. My breast finally free shot upward then a hard yank downward towards the floor followed by jiggling in the cups which caused my wails to become louder at the alien and unfamiliar body I now inhabited. I went back out to the bar after calming down and fixing my makeup. Back to a piece of eye-candy as I get nothing in return.  <br />
<br />
Don’t get me wrong I loved observing the other women in their bikini uniforms not to mention the many young college-aged girls who flocked throughout the pool areas dressed in even skimpier swimsuits then mine. I struggled to contain my feelings about the women coming up to the bar as the constant wetness between my legs, my hardening nipples, and my constant blushing and stares couldn’t be solved just through deep breaths alone. I occasionally had to go into the back room feigning requests  for extra supplies where I caught my breath, sensually rubbed my breasts and cleared my mind before going back out to work but the feelings would begin again in earnest as more beautiful women came up to the hut. I thanked the genie wherever she was many times throughout the day that she hadn’t changed my sexuality with the wish and the new identity it created. Thankfully I was still a man where it counted but not by much. Throughout the day several women I felt immediately attracted to came up to the bar and I tried flirting and dropping hints to them of my inner feelings but none of them favorably returned with their own flirts. Even giving them additional alcohol in their glasses or less ice seemed not to endear any of these knockouts to me. I was a man in a beautiful bombshell of a women and none of these women could see that of course so they treated me like any other hired skank. Only Ashley from earlier treated me like a human being and even though I was extremely attracted to her she didn’t return the feelings or at least did it outwardly.<br />
<br />
With the day at its end I helped clean up the bar from the day shift preparing it or the night crew then with excitement slipped on my workout shorts and shirt and began to leave the pool area with my pocketbook slung over my shoulder. I walked towards the place I had seen my genie earlier and too my surprise she was laying on the same lounge chair as earlier many hours after the fact. My genie on spotting me waved ecstatically as I quickened my pace towards her but was blindsided by the appearance of Ashley stepping into my path. She now wore a denim skirt and blue t-shirt with sandals adorning her feet and appeared to smile radiantly as she focused her blue eyes in contact with mine “Hey Penelope its Ashley from earlier. I know what Colin did was unacceptable and I wanted to apologize as his friend for him doing that. Even though he seems like a big dork hes actually a kind man and even he wants to apologize to you after I made him realize his mistake. Still I personally couldn&#39;t leave what happened just to apologies so I wanted to know if you wanted to go out to dinner with me now that it seems your off work?” I was taken aback by this revelation and I already felt a little better at what had happened in the hut earlier but a dinner date was not something I expected. Ashley continued “it would be my treat” with a genuine smile on her face and a pep to her voice. Dinner with this wonderful women who I had just met sounded lovely and I was in fact famished but at the same time my genie and a return to my male self was so close and I was being forced to chose only one of them.</p>
