<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rick went to sleep that night feeling distinctly...odd. Not unwelcome, not uncomfortable, but odd. When he went ahead and took his shirt and pants off, he noticed that his thighs, back and shoulders weren&#39;t fitting the normal way in his bed. He pondered it briefly before deciding it was just all the swimming he was doing for high school that was finally paying off. Heck, maybe he could get muscular enough soon to attract a woman IRL outside of these chat roulette and such sites. Still, it was unreasonably turning him on, knowing his back was wider now, enough that he couldn&#39;t really fit the way he did before. Fuck, he could feel his lats pressing against the mattress...!<br />
<br />
Rick tossed and turned while he tried to sleep, not knowing he was nineteen now, and heading toward a very fortunate period in his life. His dedication toward swimming due to pay off in a big way. His features if anything were more angular than before, more handsome, and as he turned he felt his pecs pushing more, having a greater amount of tone than prior. Rick had no idea WHAT was going on here, but he figured he could just figure it out in the morning.<br />
<br />
Eventually however he managed to get to sleep once he calmed his nerves - though he felt hot enough that he abandoned his sheets and blankets, resting on top of the bed in his underwear.<br />
<br />
And as the perverted young man went off to sleep, he could perchance dream.<br />
<br />
At first he just saw himself drifting through a sleepy, empty landscape, and then he was leaving the pool, evidently having practiced today. His hair was trimmed down to a buzz cut, his body hair removed to a great degree, and he was wearing a speedo to make sure he eliminated any drag on his form. A young woman approached him apropos of nothing.<br />
<br />
He noticed she was beautiful, athletic but slim and with generous breasts, her features almost too perfect (well, it was a dream after all). She started making out with him then and there, and Rick didn&#39;t even think twice about it. He just went for it, kissing her deep and passionate, and following her as she led him off toward the back of the pool. He spoke in a deeper voice than he remembered, &quot;Babe? You sure we can do this back here? What about everybody watching me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll be fine. We always do it back here...&quot; She said, distant but so alluring.<br />
<br />
Rick in real life pumped his hips, gripping his bed in his hands, lightly biting his lip as Rick in the dream felt her pull his speedo down and start kissing his abs all the way to his masculine organ. Fuck this made so little sense, but then, he was a ripped fucker, and the best swimmer on the whole team. Sure he wasn&#39;t as huge as the guys on the football team, but he more than made up for it in sheer tone and aesthetic form. Rick groaned as he felt her hands pinch his nipples in between licking and sucking on his dick.<br />
<br />
As she led him to move to put his hard cock into her pussy, she being suddenly undressed, Rick in real life gulped and felt his muscles flex. His ass tightening, and his hips left the bed as he thrust upward with passion. In the dream, after all, he was merrily fucking her. Whoever &quot;her&quot; was. He didn&#39;t recognize this woman from any of his fap logs or any of the porn he watched. She was just so beautiful though he didn&#39;t mind.<br />
<br />
But she was tight, and she was touching him in all the right ways, and ohh fuck her boobs were so big! Were her boobs always this big? The scenery seemed to be shifting...<br />
<br />
And then Rick was at home with her in some sort of apartment. After all, by this point in the night, Rick was 25. His body was primed, in the best shape of his life, and he was a designated and celebrated Olympic Swimmer. His features were if anything more handsome and less in a boyish way. His jaw was stronger, his muscles tighter still, more toned and a little bigger - but not too much so as to affect his swimming. Five gold medals materialized on the bedside bookcase his mother gave him when he was 10.<br />
<br />
Rick had no idea why she was suddenly calling him &quot;My Olympian&quot; and referencing his medal-winning. He just figured this must be some sort of advanced roleplay. His body was also foreign to him. Definitely not a teen any more. But with her pussy around his cock, her breasts under his hands, and his thighs working to push his dick in there, he didn&#39;t mind. He felt strong and right now, Richard loved that. The shift was imperceptible to him - somewhat. He did feel...a little less immature, even though his love for sex persevered.<br />
<br />
Everybody in the Village knew about Richard and his prolific sexual escapades.<br />
<br />
Whuh? When did he think about some village? Richard felt his head ache a bit. But he decided not to worry about it. He had a woman to fuck. She was urging him on and he did not want to disappoint! Besides, he could always figure out what was going on later. He felt something starting to shift again as the night went on, even as it seemed not much time passed in the dream. Richard just kept fucking, kept thrusting, feeling his body just if anything get STRONGER.<br />
<br />
35 and Richard was gonna cum. Fuck, fuck! She was really gonna drive him over the edge! Sponsorships and advertising gave Richard the home in his dream he currently lived in, and around him in his home a few more hints of his new fortune showed themselves. A set of fitness weights, a bench press bar and bench in the corner, some awards, and photos of him. At 35 Richard left Olympic Swimming, but he had stayed fit, strong, and if anything took the opportunity to bulk up a bit.<br />
<br />
35 year old Richard was still cleanshaven across the body except his head hair - which he combed back to avoid making the slight hairline decline too obvious. Not that most babes cared. Not this one, at least. His body was brawnier than it had been before, retaining its tone and maintaining the interest of his &quot;date&quot;. She kept on, wrapping her legs around him as he thrust away. She loved him! She kept on calling him a star, referencing some athletic achievements Richard barely recalled in his dreamy state.<br />
<br />
But then she pushed him too far, and Richard grunted, &quot;I&#39;m...! Stop! I&#39;m gonna cum now! Stop!&quot; But she urged him on regardless, even as the ring stopped glowing per Richard grunting &quot;stop&quot; in his sleep - and then the orgasm that hit him finished off his incredibly strained underwear, ripping them under the pressure of a sustained emission of his semen.<br />
<br />
Richard was jolted awake by the sensation of orgasm, and propped himself up on the bed. Something was...something was definitely different. He looked at the clock by his bed, seeing 3:25 in the morning...and just as well seeing the gold medals by the alarm clock, resting in a small container. His eyes widened, and Richard gulped, realizing something intrinsic about him was off;<br />
<br />
&quot;What...the...fuck?&quot; His voice! His voice sounded so different! Richard stumbled to his feet, feeling so much bigger and so very different from how he usually felt. Bleary from the sudden awakening, Richard ignored the many brand name clothes now littering his room. For all that he changed, he still lived with his folks to support them with his earnings - not that he realized that right now.<br />
<br />
Richard stumbled into the bathroom and saw himself in the mirror. Saw his 35 year old body. And he had to clamp a hand over his mouth to stop himself from waking up everybody in the house. Richard with great trepidation started touching his new body, wondering what brought this on. &quot;I-I have gold fucking medals...what the fuck?&quot; He whispered to himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did this to me?&quot; He pondered, &quot;I am...am I a different guy now? I&#39;m still Richard Alston. ...Right?&quot; <br />
<br />
When his hands touched his biceps, his chest and his abs, he whispered in an awestruck tone, &quot;And...I&#39;m really, REALLY jacked.&quot; Despite himself he felt the corner of his mouth tug toward a smile. This was weird, no questions asked, and he needed to figure out what happened. But fuck, if he wasn&#39;t a stud for it...<br />
<br />
What to do now, he pondered. He could just try and go back to bed. He could...get to know himself better. Or he could head out and see if anyone around at this hour recognized him at the local gym. He usually used it for just swimming when he couldn&#39;t use the pool at school. But he figured he probably had some mileage with it now, and the gym WAS open 24 hours a day...</p>
