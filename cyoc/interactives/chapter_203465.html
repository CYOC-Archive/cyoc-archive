<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Thanks for the ideas JT</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Try as he might, he didn’t see anything that might stop the robot. He wasn’t standing near any of the traps Troy had set up. He tried to think of something that he could say that might convince the sexy dog who was strangely replacing Rusty in Troy’s memories.<br />
<br />
“W-what about Paradox?” Troy said, exasperated.<br />
<br />
“Right. Didn’t you hear? We’re a matched pair on my packaging. The only thing out of place here…is you, Troy.” Randy kept moving forward. “Ah, it starts.”<br />
<br />
“What are you-” Troy looked down and gasped.<br />
<br />
When had he worn a Letterman’s Jacket? That damned reality auditor!<br />
<br />
Troy spread his arms, noticing only now his black stripes spreading out, covering the orange fur on the backs of his arms and their creamy white undersides. His claws flexed and popped one last time before becoming un-retractable. He barked in surprise, paw covering a muzzle that seemed blunter than he used to have. He looked back up at Randy, and realized he was staring at his chin.<br />
<br />
Was he shrinking?<br />
<br />
“There we go. I was afraid I’d need to get the Book of Beast to shift you into a Rottweiler, but it looks like an Auditor is doing it for me.”<br />
<br />
“N-no!” Troy whined, tiger ears shifting to canine ones, softening and lopping over themselves. “I’m a tiger!”<br />
<br />
Too late, he stumbled over his lawn chair. Randy caught him before he could fall. Troy gasped, feeling the thick muscles of his former boyfriend flex and squeeze him. Randy’s paws trailed down his shoulders to his arms.<br />
<br />
“Nah, you’re no tiger. You’re my dopey doggy fuck buddy!”  Randy gripped Troy’s arms tight and squeezed hard, motors whirring.<br />
<br />
Troy yelped and dropped the Book. Randy kicked it away in the grass, out of reach. Now there was nothing standing between Troy and a rather ignoble end. <br />
<br />
Randy chuckled.<br />
<br />
Troy looked up at Randy’s cruel face, realizing he was at nipple height now. He whined, long tiger tail receding to a pathetic nub that wriggled at the base of his spine.<br />
<br />
 Randy reached into his back pocket and produced a scuffed white baseball cap that contrasted with his black one and firmly placed it on Troy’s head, then turned it backwards. Abruptly, Troy’s shirt disappeared, exposing his black furred midsection.<br />
<br />
“You are just the cutest Rottie I’ve ever seen.” Randy purred, unzipping his jeans, exposing his thick red rocket, the tip dripping lube onto Troy’s belly. “But I’m gonna make you cuter.”<br />
<br />
Troy gulped and felt a tingling sensation where the lube had fallen on him. His fur seemed less lush, more…artificial. Randy moved closer, his cock smearing lube all across Troy’s stomach. The tingling intensified, and Troy groaned. The abs Troy had worked so hard to achieve disappeared under a layer of silicone chub. <br />
<br />
Randy grabbed Troy’s chin and jerked him up into a rough kiss. He struggled against it, teeth clamped shut, but the lube spread more tingles in his mouth and his sharp teeth gave way, becoming rubbery. Tory moaned as a long, well-lubed tongue snaked down his throat. The moan didn’t stop, in fact it became more intense as it became a mechanical whir. His throat began to undulate and clench rhythmically around the intruder. <br />
<br />
Tingles were spreading up from the back of his throat into his head. Troy had to fight off a pleasurable lull as the whir of the motor and the clench of his throat mellowed his thoughts. While he did, Randy managed to unbutton Troy’s jeans and pull them down. Troy’s hard canine cock wobbled freely in the air, dripping precum.<br />
<br />
Randy rubbed his own ruby rod, coaxing a stream of lube into one paw, and jerked Troy off. Troy was dimly aware of tingles there, but it was drowned out by the wash of pleasure that tongue was giving him. His cock began to feel less fleshy, less of a give to it as it transitioned from flesh to rubber and latex. Randy applied a liberal amount to Troy’s balls and they expanded heavily, strange sensations of movement and whirring briefly caused Troy to take a deep breath through his increasingly rubbery nose.<br />
<br />
Randy lowered Troy to the ground as his arms and legs began to disappear. Troy tried to struggle, but he could only manage to buck his hips, torso almost completely converted. Randy withdrew from his mouth with a *shlurp* and studied Troy thick doggy cock.<br />
<br />
“Should be ready.” Randy bent over, tongue wrapping around Troy’s cock, and sucked.<br />
<br />
His balls heated up and the sound of bubbles churning came from his balls. Troy was suddenly hit with a euphoric sensation that had him giggling over the lube in his mouth. Randy pulled his mouth off Troy’s dick and blew a cloud of skunky smoke in Troy’s rapidly slackening face. He breathed in, inhaling the cloud of pure CBD smoke.<br />
<br />
“There we go. Chill bro, relax.” Randy took another hit off Troy’s cock-turned-bong.<br />
<br />
Troy struggled to fight through the drug fueled haze, but it was getting harder, especially as the tingling reached his brain and his whole mind was engulfed in tingles as it began to alter into a complex CPU.<br />
<br />
More silicone chub filled out his body, belly spreading and pecs sagging. Nights ripping bongs with Randy and stuffing his face with snacks after football practice. Practice he showed up for less and less, filled his mind. .<br />
<br />
Randy grinned, watching Troy’s eyes redden, and gripped the chubby dog’s torso. He circled Troy’s entrance, spreading lube and tingle and then plunged his big thick rod into his ass. Troy moaned happily, too stoned to realize how bad it was for him. Randy fucked him deep and hard, like he was determined to get lube in every nook and cranny of Troy’s asshole.<br />
<br />
Tingles built and soon Troy’s ass was whirring, clenching and undulating and working that big red bone out.  Troy’s mind started going-it was a miracle it hadn’t already. Randy grinned.<br />
<br />
“You wanna hear your backstory?” Randy asked, fucking his hole roughly. “Master let me come up with it myself. You’re a tubby ex-jock who got kicked off the football team when you started getting high all day, chowing down on munchies instead of working out. You started hanging out with the wrong crowd and got turned out like the chubby slut you are. And that’s how you met me.”<br />
<br />
“W-why t-tubby?” Troy muttered, feeling the motor in his ass clench and squeeze around Randy’s thick bone, memories coming in whether he wanted them to or not.<br />
<br />
“Part personal preference, part contrast. I’m muscled and you’re thick.” Randy slapped Troy’s big silicone ass cheeks and admired them as they wobbled and grew slightly. “Just like I like it.”<br />
<br />
Troy nodded, vaguely aware something was wrong but not sure what. It all felt good. He was high, his fuck buddy was pounding his ass. What could be wrong? His mind floated on a cloud, lube dripped from his slack jaws.<br />
<br />
“Looking tuckered out there, Troy.” Randy paused. “Yeah, Tucker. That&#39;s a good name for you.”<br />
<br />
There was a *pop*. Thick Fucker Tucker, the Dopey Doggy Fuckbuddy engraved itself on the brass plate inset in Troy’s lower back.<br />
<br />
Randy felt reality snap into place. His beloved Rottweiler was finished. He snarled and his cock bucked, spraying Tucker’s increasingly mechanical insides with cum. The effect on the lightly struggling fucktoy below him was immediate.<br />
<br />
Trucker…Tocker…Tucker gave up on remembering his name. Too much work. He let go, mind floating away. His cock juddered and THC-infused cum splattered his belly. Tucker’s eyes rolled in head head, doggy tongue flopping out of his mouth, dripping lube. The blissed-out stoner dog’s expression froze in place as his face turned to sculpted silicone.<br />
<br />
“Mmm, tastes like butterscotch.” Randy chuckled and leaned in, knowing Tucker could still hear him. “Mine tastes like caramel.”<br />
<br />
He reached into his pocket and placed a blindfold and ear muffs on Tucker’s head. Then he filled his orifices with dildos and encased his cock in an undulating sleeve, making sure to turn “gooey orgasms” off. Soon, Tucker would be properly reprogrammed like he was. With the state he was in, he probably wouldn’t make the drive without breaking.<br />
<br />
Randy picked up Tucker with no effort and carried the fucktoy to where he’d parked Sam’s car. He set Tucker gently in the back, next to the Bull sex doll. Master had searched all over town and Randy had found one sitting in a lawn chair near where he found Tucker. Master would be delighted that he’d brought home a Book AND a Bull.<br />
<br />
The truck sputtered and set off back to the warehouse.<br />
