<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was close to an hour later that the two women pulled up back at Kate&#39;s house. Kerry wearing Kate&#39;s body had driven Kate&#39;s car. Kate did not think she would be able to drive in the 5 inch heels Kerry wanted her to wear. <br />
<br />
After parking the car Kerry handed Kate the suit she had selected for Michael to wear. Kerry had her hands full with the shirt, tie and shoes for Michel. The girls had decided that if they were dressing up the guys would as well.<br />
<br />
Tom and Michael were engrossed in the footy game which had arrived at a nail-biting conclusion. Kate had hoped for at least some acknowledgement of how sexy she now looked from Tom but he had not even glanced her way. She understood in a way as the Tigers were leading by a point in the final minute but she couldn&#39;t help but feel disappointed as she stood at the back of the lounge room and observed her husband and her brother in law. At least Michael had called out &quot;Hi ladies&quot; even if his eyes did not leave the screen. Tom had not even acknowledged their return.<br />
<br />
It was only after the siren had sounded, with the Tigers hanging on, that the guys looked at Kate. Tom did do a double take and Kate did detect that look of lust in his eyes, she was pleased. It was Michael however who vocalised &quot;Oh wow Hun! You look sensational&quot;<br />
<br />
Kerry, in Kate&#39;s voice and body replied to Michael. &quot;We bought your suit. If we are going to dress up for dinner you two can as well&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure! Anything to be seen with such a hottie!&quot; Michael replied. His eyes were not on Kerry but on Kate who was wearing Kerry&#39;s body.<br />
<br />
Michael moved across the room quickly and before she could object was giving Kate a hug. He went to kiss her but Kate squirmed away.<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t! You&#39;ll ruin my makeup&quot; Kerry had just spent 15 minutes perfecting Kate&#39;s new face. <br />
<br />
A puzzled looking Michael pulled back, he took the suit Kate was proffering. &quot;Sorry. I have very fond memories of the last time you wore that dress! You look sensational!&quot; <br />
<br />
Kate found herself blushing. She had elicited the response she wanted but just from the wrong brother. She had not failed to notice how toned Michael&#39;s body was as he had hugged her. How he smelt so nice and how he either had a gun in his pocket or was very pleased to see her. She looked across to Tom who had watched the exchange between herself and Michael. Tom seemed so short and pudgy in comparison to his brother. She was at a loss for words. <br />
<br />
It was Kerry who broke the silence. Addressing Kate &quot;Come on! I need to get dressed as well. Come and help me choose an outfit&quot; she then turned to Michael. &quot;These are for you as well&quot; handing him the other clothes she had selected for him to wear. &quot;Why don&#39;t you have a shower in the other bathroom&quot; She could smell Michael&#39;s body odour. He definitely need a shower. What had he been doing? He usually had a nice scent.<br />
<br />
The two women disappeared into the master bedroom. Several minutes later the person Tom thought was &#39;Kerry&#39; came out and handed him his own suit and a clean shirt &quot;You need a shower as well. Use the other bathroom when Michael is out&quot;. Tom was slightly miffed. &#39;Kerry&#39; may well look a million dollars but he didn&#39;t like the way she inferred that he stank. Only Kate should be telling him such things.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile Kerry and Michael showered and changed. Kerry wore the all the clothes Kate had suggested without question. Kate told her &quot;If I&#39;m going bra-less you are as well&quot; It was different being so much smaller in the bust but it made being bra-less much easier. Her breasts didn&#39;t wobble nearly as much as usual and she didn&#39;t feel she was at risk of exposing them even though the pale blue silk dress was low cut. <br />
<br />
Kate had Kerry wear her tallest heels. She did not possess anything with 5 inch heels such as Kerry was making her wear but she had Kerry wear three inch white pumps. Kate had only worn them once before and had found them quite uncomfortable. Thinking about that she was amazed at how comfortable Kerry&#39;s shoes were. She had almost forgotten she was wearing them.<br />
<br />
It was 7 pm by the time Kate was satisfied with Kerry&#39;s look. She had spent time putting a curl in the blonde hair and fussed over jewellery.  She had ended up applying a bit more make-up than usual. She thought Kerry looked very sexy. She had been unaware of just how much her nipples showed in that dress until seeing it from this perspective. Michael would like that she decided. She sprayed her cologne onto Kerry and said &quot;Let&#39;s go and do the big reveal&quot;</p>
