<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Richard Van Direstag ran from the Jenkins home towards the hospital. His mind was focused on finding where his daughter was, and he didn&#39;t notice that he could run faster and longer than before.  Instead, he kept his eyes forward and made his way to the hospital.  It wasn&#39;t long before the hospital came into view and he made his way in.  It was the third time that day since he&#39;d been there, and he wasn&#39;t looking forward to it.  He made his way to the receptionist desk and talk to the woman who was manning it.  &quot;Excuse me,&quot; he said getting the receptionist&#39;s attention, &quot;Have you seen a girl, about fifteen years old, black hair, olive skin?&quot;<br />
<br />
The receptionist examined the man as she processed his request.  &quot;Oh...um...&quot; she started to answer, &quot;I think so...&quot;  She shuffled through her notes before continuing her response.  &quot;She came in here about an hour ago.  Asked about birth control pills.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Richard responded as his eyes widened.<br />
<br />
&quot;Unfortunately, the pharmacy was closed for the day,&quot; the receptionist continued, &quot;So I told her to come back tomorrow.  With her parents.&quot; The receptionist stopped there as she figured who the man was.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Richard replied, &quot;Did you see where she went?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I saw her go out back through the door,&quot; the receptionist answered pointing to the door.  &quot;From there, I&#39;m not sure where she went.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Richard said while taking a deep breath, &quot;Thank you.&quot;  He then walked out the door and tried to get his bearings.  He figured that Rachel might make her way home, but why would it take so long?  He grew worried as his mind with possibilities, each grimmer than the previous.<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
&quot;Oh....wow....that....&quot; Rachel panted as she came off her orgasmic high.  Rachel managed to lift herself up as Megumi sat back with a bit of a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m glad you enjoyed that,&quot; Megumi said as she licked her chops.  &quot;You have a very...unique taste.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; Rachel said with a bit of a smile, &quot;That&#39;s something that I don&#39;t think I want to hear from someone who has sharp canines.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, Rachel,&quot; Megumi answered with a giggle, &quot;It&#39;s just...let&#39;s say that I enjoyed it as much as you did.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel laughed and said, &quot;And I never knew that I could have felt...that good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;s thanks to being a woman...and a werevixen.&quot;  By that time, both girls were sitting up and looking at each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah,&quot; Rachel said remembering something, &quot;Aaron said something about that.  That werefoxes know how to...um...pleasure their partners.&quot;<br />
<br />
A smirk formed on Megumi&#39;s face as she said, &quot;Aaron-san did say something about enjoying himself with you.  I&#39;m surprised you aren&#39;t a werevixen yet.&quot;  She paused and said, &quot;He talked about you quite a bit after you left.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; Rachel said as she could feel her face warming up, &quot;And what did he say?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That he felt something about you...especially after you two went all over each other.&quot;  Megumi rubbed the back of her neck as she continued.  &quot;I think he feels a bond with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel&#39;s eyebrows shot up when she heard that, &quot;What does that mean?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
Megumi took a breath as she continued, &quot;Well, sometimes werefoxes form a bond with the people we have sex with.  A bond that can get stronger with every encounter.&quot;  She took a minute to think, &quot;And I think that encounter you had with him...when you jacked him off...might have started that bonding with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel blinked and said, &quot;Well, I mean...I never meant things to go that far.  But...&quot;  She paused as she smiled a bit.  &quot;To be honest, I&#39;m not sure what came over me.  I just looked at him and well...I think my baser instincts took over.  It started with me asking to see his were form, but if I&#39;m being honest...&quot; She put her arms behind her as she thought about that night, &quot;I think I was just hot for him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Megumi giggled and said, &quot;That&#39;s something that&#39;s completely normal here in Moon Lake.  It doesn&#39;t help that most of us weres are born like this, and we do tend to attract what we call normals.  Add in being teenagers with both teenage hormones and were instincts...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I know,&quot; Rachel said,&quot; I&#39;ve heard the rumors around school.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, the question is, Rachel-san,&quot; Megumi started to ask as she laid back and opened her legs a bit, &quot;What will you do now?&quot;  Rachel noticed that Megumi was offering herself to Rachel.  Rachel looked at Megumi as she tried to decide what she wanted to do.<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
It was fully dark by the time Richard made his way out of the hospital.  He looked around as he got his bearings.  Having been to the hospital twice before, he knew the general direction of home.  He could follow the path home in the hopes of running into Rachel.  But if she was in the woods...  He shuddered at the thought.  At best, she&#39;d still be normal and hopefully still in place.  At worst, she could be eaten by predators, much like his wife before her change.  In either case, how would he know how to find her.  It was then that he had an idea.  <br />
<br />
He moved to the back to the hospital where he could get some privacy.  He looked around to make sure that no one was around before he started to take off his clothes.  Once he was fully nude, he closed his eyes and willed himself to shift to his lion fursona.  He couldn&#39;t help but notice that this transformation was painless, even a bit normal for him.  If anything, this was the real form of him.  But he knew he couldn&#39;t spend too much time wondering on it as his daughter might be in trouble.  He took a whiff of the night air, and his nose was assaulted by a large number of scents.  Try as he might, he couldn&#39;t distinguish Rachel&#39;s scent from the others that were in the hospital.<br />
<br />
He decided to start to walk in the direction of his home.  As he did so, the number of scents started to go down and it became easier to distinguish one scent from another.  He was halfway home when he picked up on a human scent.  A normal human scent.  And it was coming from the woods.  His eyes widened as he knew who it was and he bounded into the woods following the scent.</p>
