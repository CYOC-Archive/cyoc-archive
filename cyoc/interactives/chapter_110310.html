<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">as you thought of what to do first while figuring out what kind of circus this place is that you thought you just saw a large looking cat walking into one of the caravan tents. feeling something strange about it that you secretly sneak after it near to the tent while staying out of sight only to hear some talk in there. moments later as you were still hiding out of sight that you noticed the cat was actually a jaguar as it came out with a young female ringleader as they made their ways.<br />
<br />
still following the jaguar as you thought it should be in a cage as it passed a few signs along the way that some of the signs were interested while still following the big jungle cat. you followed it to a trailer as it then enters, but it then somehow spoke in a feminine voice to you without looking to you.<br />
<br />
&quot;if your going to sneak up on someone, then you better find someone that doesn&#39;t know your coming.&quot;<br />
<br />
you came out of hiding as you placed a hand behind you in embarrassment. &quot;eh, sorry! it&#39;s just that, i thought you were suppose to be in a cage like most animals. but i guess you get your own trailers, but then how come i can understand you?&quot;<br />
<br />
the jaguar&#39;s head lowered its head with a sigh while dropping its tail on the ground with a thud. &quot;it&#39;s because i&#39;m not really a jaguar, i&#39;m actually someone inside this realistic jaguar suit. it makes me look, feel, and act like a real jaguar. it even lets me sound like one.&quot;<br />
<br />
you were surprise to here her suit could do all of those things as she turn its body around to face you that you were face to face with the jaguar.&quot;now what do you want boy, i was almost ready to get out of this hot, sweaty suit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;oh, that reminds me! i would like a job here as it said in your circus fliers that your looking for help on work, and i&#39;m interested in the job.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;well don&#39;t just stand there with shock, please come on in.&quot; she said as she got up on her hind legs and went back into the trailer. not wanting to make her mad that You walked in and found the was a mass to see. several stacks of papers to the side as there were a bunch of woman&#39;s clothes laying all over the place from tight leather pants and a red cape, to lady&#39;s underwear that it almost made you have a nose bleed with blush.<br />
<br />
the jaguar was now sitting on the bench while removing her paws to revile two human hands as she asks you to help her out of it that you wast no time helping her out of the suit. while she was removing her hind paws boots to show her feet that you found a zipper behind her mask and unzipped it. when she removed her mask to show a young, beautiful girl as she was panting for air whit sweat on her face that she had nice, silky, long brown hair going pass her shoulders as she had aqua blue eyes. she was so beautiful to look at that when she asked you for a bottle of water is when you snapped out of it and got her some after she told you where it was.<br />
<br />
after she gulped down some water from the bottle she had in hand that you asked her if she was alright while unzipping her suit. &quot;i&#39;ll be fine. it&#39;s just gets to hot in this suit when i&#39;m wearing it for all day.&quot; when she was almost ready to slip out of the jaguar suit is when she was looking at you in a way that she wanted some privacy to do what needs to be done. turning around so you don&#39;t see her get undress that you see her getting out of the jaguar suit naked in the mirror near you.<br />
<br />
it took her a moment to get out of the costume and put it nicely away in a closet that she then got herself ready to get dress as she slipped on some red panties with a matching bra set of underwear. as the moments gone by that when she was fully dressed that when she told you it was ok to look now is when you did as told as she was in a daisy duke outfit, mines the shorts as they covered the legs well as she was wearing a tear jean style. &quot;Well, how do i look?&quot; she asked as she was now blushing when she realized about the mirror.<br />
<br />
you were too stunned to even say a word as you try to giver her your best answer. &quot;wow! you look great!&quot;<br />
<br />
moments later after the talk and gathering her stuff out of the way that you both made you way to the ringleader&#39;s trailer tent. when she knocked on the door is when the door opened up to show the ringleader that she looked liked she just came out of a shower not too long ago. &quot;hello ma&#39;am. it seems like we have someone here that wants to work here at our circus.&quot; the lady said that was in the jaguar suit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello ma&#39;am.&quot; You replied back as You should of have been shocked while confused, but Wait... hadn&#39;t you SEEN her on posters for the circus?<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, my name is Elizabeth and don&#39;t be so worried, it&#39;s just the nature of the circus and If you haven&#39;t fainted or run away while helping one of my own members a hand, then that just means everything is normal and you have what it takes for this job. Let me give you our introductory speech, it feels better if we give it personally rather than a recording. People have been growing and getting some jobs else where while some were against the circus as we have animals for years... but there was a way to go around it. What if the circus had jobs for both humans and animals, wild beasts who could perform for the joy of the audience, but This circus was on the verge of collapse when the animals we had were begging to feel ill as some of our mundane animals were ever released or bought by the zoo and took care for while some of the actors here as you seen took their place that it&#39;s now starting to become part of our circus act.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And... if I want the job?&quot; you asked the ringleader.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s rather straight forward really. You&#39;ll be at the ticket booth selling tickets as you&#39;ll also be cleaning up the animals of both real and fakes cages. you&#39;ll become bound to the circus as a part time contract. they&#39;ll all be unconsciously aware that you&#39;ve chosen this of your own free will. if you do your job really well that you&#39;ll soon get to be in show business as everyone here will welcome you as if you were part of our family that you&#39;ll soon get You&#39;re entitle with equal share of ownership of the circus. does that sounds alright to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... It&#39;s only part time?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What part of part time contract don&#39;t you understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So eh, i&#39;ll slowly get to help out on shows if i do my job well right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In a word: yes, but Trust me, the job gets harder when you get done with rookie jobs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... so when do i start and where do i sleep?<br />
<br />
&quot;you can start in the morning rookie. as for where you&#39;ll sleep, you can sleep...</p>
