<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ryan walked happily to the back of the Muscle Beach gym next to his muscular, anthro tiger best friend. <br />
<br />
At first, the gym seemed relatively large – at least until you realized that all of the walls had mirrors on them.  Then you realized that you were just looking at the reflection of the relatively small work out area, and that what little space was available was filled with weights and a smattering of treadmills. . It was mid-day, so the place was basically empty, Jeff and Ryan had the machines all to themselves. <br />
<br />
Ryan glanced at his reflection as he walked, admiring the way his pecs, ass and cock-bounced with every step he took. Pausing to puff his chest up in front of a mirror, Ryan flashed a smile, glad he’d decided to keep lifting even when his best bud in the world, Jeff, outgrew him. <br />
<br />
As Ryan continued to admire himself, he couldn’t help but notice how natural the lion beanie looked on his head.  The shaggy mane and soft fur accentuated his otherwise tough face.  Ryan kept smiling and struck a pose as he flexed his biceps, still focused on the lion beanie.  It certainly was starting to grow on him…<br />
<br />
The ears twitched and Ryan did a doubletake.<br />
<br />
Had he really just seen that?  Had the beanie’s ears really just twitched?  <br />
<br />
<br />
“You ready, bud?” Jeff’s deep, growly voice pulled Ryan’s attention away from his relfection.<br />
<br />
“Hmm? Oh, yeah, yeah,” Ryan replied, his voice deeper than he remembered.<br />
<br />
“I’ve got our routine for the day.” Jeff pulled out his phone, “Fifteen minutes on the treadmill, five minute cooldown, then we go to the chin-up bars. We’ll do three set of 10 chin-ups, 10 pullups, 10 leg raises. After that, five minute cooldown, then finish it off with bench pressing to muscle failure.”<br />
<br />
“Not very balanced.” Ryan pointed out.<br />
<br />
“It’s just a quickie to burn off all that extra energy you have.” Jeff smiled and slapped Ryan’s ass, making the human yelp. “Meet you at the bench press in thirty minutes or so.”<br />
<br />
Ryan rubbed his rear, scowling at the tiger as he sauntered off. <br />
<br />
Man, Jeff was getting handsy lately. He hadn’t said anything when the tiger had tweaked his nipples over in the corner, but it was a little invasive. Maybe very invasive. But there was no denying that his cock had gone rock hard when the tiger had done it.<br />
<br />
It was confusing. He thought he was straight, but with the way his cock stretched his jock, maybe not as straight as he thought. Jeff was his best friend, getting horny over him was just weird – and awkward. He lifted weights because he admired Jeff’s massive body, not because he was in love with him. <br />
<br />
Wait, now that he thought about it, was Jeff gay? He’d never seen the tiger with any girls. All he did was hang out with Ryan and grab his ass all day. <br />
<br />
Ryan frowned. He wasn’t sure how he felt about that.<br />
<br />
He found a treadmill in the corner, did a few quick stretches and then hopped on. <br />
<br />
There was an array of buttons and Ryan found himself floundering as he stared at the complex device. For some reason, he had no idea what his settings were, which was ridiculous since he’d been going to the gym for years now. <br />
<br />
That’s when he noticed the sticker on the side explaining how it worked. He chose the beginner’s course, since his mind was blanking on what his usual settings were. Besides, even if it didn’t challenge him much, it would still be a good warm-up.<br />
<br />
The treadmill started up and Ryan began to walk. As soon as he got used to the pace, the machine started to speed up. He started to jog, then the incline increased and he started panting. <br />
<br />
The incline went up again and the speed increased.  It wasn’t long before Ryan was having trouble keeping up as his heart raced and sweat beaded down his face. <br />
<br />
His lungs burned, but Ryan found the experience strangely refreshing. The treadmill hit the top speed and incline and he found himself grinning. His pecs bounced as he ran, the feeling oddly novel to him. As he wondered why, a memory bubbled up from deep in his mind unbidden.<br />
<br />
In the memory, Ryan was running on a treadmill just like this one, only he was a fat. He could see himself in all his chonky glory in the mirror in front of him. He remembered just staring at himself, fascinated by his obesity. Floppy moobs slapped against the front and sides of his torso as he ran-waddled. His belly swayed with each step, forcing him to constantly correct his balance. Ryan’s obese form was drenched in sweat and his lungs burned and-<br />
<br />
Ryan stumbled and managed catch the bars on the sides of the treadmill to keep himself from flying off. His heart pounded in terror. What the hell was that? He’d never been fat and his face had never been so effeminate. But the more he thought about it, the more it seemed like an old, bad dream that was getting conjured up from some forgotten part of his memory. <br />
<br />
He shook his head and resumed his run. The constancy of the treadmill made Ryan feel energized, though unlike before, this energy brough on a pleasant feeling as he channeled it to the muscles in the his body. This must be the runner’s high he’d heard about! <br />
<br />
As he savored that feeling, his legs thickened and toned with even more muscles. His shoes flew apart as his heels rose, forcing Ryan to run on his forefeet. Then his forefeet grew, enlarging into a more rounded shape, toenails transforming into retractable claws. Tawny fur covered them and traveled up his legs as his new paws grew thick black pads that softened the impact of every footfall.<br />
<br />
The machine beeped and the treadmill slowed down.<br />
<br />
“Whoa, already?” Ryan asked, peering at the screen as *workout complete* flashed. <br />
<br />
He was barely out of breath. <br />
<br />
Maybe the beginner’s routine was below his standards? The young man pressed the *ok* button to officially end the workout and paused as it displayed his workout details. At the top of the screen, it said he had done the ‘Gutcheck Hill Sprint’. No wonder the treadmill was so fast and steep! He was pretty sure he’d chosen the beginner’s course, but maybe he’d fat-fingered the keys.<br />
<br />
Looking through the options, he realized it was the absolute hardest preprogrammed routine, which was weird, because it hadn’t seemed so hard.<br />
<br />
Oh well. He glanced around and spotted the pull-up bars. Normally, he would have done a cooldown and drank some water, but what was the point when he was barely out of breath? His ears twitched in irritation. He was almost certain the gym he and Jeff went to regularly had a machine that could give him a proper challenge.<br />
<br />
Ryan reached the pull-up bars and chose the ones that were about a foot above his head.<br />
<br />
He hopped up and caught the bar, letting himself hang. The metal bar was thicker than he’d expected and he had to reposition his hands to get a proper grip. He lifted himself up, his body starting to burn after only the first two reps. As he did the chin-ups, his arms began to bulge with each pull. <br />
<br />
Then he switched his hands for pull-ups. The burn hit different and his chest deepened further. His torso starting to bulge with muscle and his shoulders broadened, muscles spreading across his back like wings. The beads of sweat had, by this time, turned into a steady trickle that ran down his brow. Next was the leg raises. He grunted, this one harder than the others, making him feel a bit nauseous as his abs burned and swelled into thick cobblestones.<br />
<br />
The bar creaked ominously as he finished his leg-raises, a bolt popping from the wall.<br />
<br />
He let go of the bar, landing lightly on his paw-pads and glanced at the clocks. There was still a few minutes left to go until he’d meet up with Jeff at the bench-press. He scratched his chest as a thick pelt of fur spread over it. <br />
<br />
Maybe he should do another set?<br />
<br />
When he reached to grab the bar, he found that he had trouble wrapping his thick paws around the thin metal bar. Weirder still, it was only as tall as his chin. He could barely fit his huge body through the space between the bar and the wall. How the hell had he managed to do a full set on this little thing? <br />
<br />
He sauntered over to the bench press and found that Jeff had already beaten him there, repping almost 500 pounds.<br />
<br />
“Hey,” Jeff grunted, tail twitching, “Can you spot me?”<br />
<br />
Ryan nodded and hustled over, helping the tiger settle the bar into place.<br />
<br />
Jeff’s fur was wet with sweat and he was panting, musk rolling off of his body in waves. Ryan’s nose twitched, darkening, whiskers extending from his cheeks as he inhaled that deep, masculine scent. The tiger rolled out from under the bar and started taking weights off and setting them back in their places.<br />
<br />
“Alright,” Jeff pointed at the sweat-slicked bench, “Your turn.” <br />
<br />
Ryan made a face but lay down on the moist bench, the tiger’s scent soaking into his clothes as he wriggled himself into place beneath the bar.<br />
<br />
“Alright, let’s start you off with 150.” Jeff said, adding a few weights to the bar.<br />
<br />
Ryan took a breath and started doing reps. It was obvious the bar was too light, his pecs and biceps not feeling any burn from the weight. For some reason, Ryan recalled barely being able to lift the bar, which was what had made him quit coming with Jeff to the gym out of embarrassment. But that was silly. He’d pushed through that shame and kept at it, losing weight and getting fit. What kind of loser quit on a friend?<br />
<br />
Jeff added more weights, bringing the total to 250.<br />
<br />
This time he kind of felt it. As his muscles strained and he started breathing through his nose to steady himself, he noticed the tiger’s heavy musk hanging in the air around the sweat-soaked bench. The tiger moved around to spot him, his crotch bringing with it a wash of fresh musk. Ryan sniffed a bit, mouth and nose starting to protrude forward.<br />
<br />
“Feeling the burn yet?” Jeff asked as Ryan settled the bar into place.<br />
<br />
“Nah. Stack another fifty on.” Ryan said, his voice growing even deeper.<br />
<br />
“Now that’s what I’m talking about!” Jeff grinned and added another 50 pounds.<br />
<br />
Ryan strained with this set, finally feeling the weight. It was so exhilarating, not just to lift a barbell with such a large load, but to do so as easily as Jeff did. His muscles pumped up with every rep that he did, then firmed and toned when he relaxed.<br />
<br />
He finished the last rep and panted, nose filling with musk. Ryan must have bumped his spine sitting down, because his tail bone was aching. As he shifted to rub his butt, a long tawny tail slithered out of his pants, a dark tuft of fur tipping the end of it.<br />
<br />
Ryan held his tail in his paws, blinking stupidly at it. He could feel his body extending out much further back than it had before, and when the tail flicked, he realized that the new extension to his body and the tail in his paws were one and the same.  He looked up at Jeff and noticed that his friend was clearly erect, his cock tenting his workout shorts. <br />
<br />
“May I?” Jeff asked as he stared down at Ryan’s tail.<br />
<br />
Ryan nodded, holding out his tail to the big tiger. Jeff leaned forward, his musky crotch pressing against Ryan’s proto-muzzle. As the jock sensuously stroked his tail, Ryan found himself nuzzling deeper into the moist, musky confine of the tiger’s crotch. <br />
<br />
“You like my scent, huh bud?” Jeff purred.<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Ryan said, huffing the tiger’s package happily.<br />
<br />
Jeff leaned further forward, his package resting heavily on Ryan’s muzzle, his hard cock twitching against the lion’s face. Ryan took that as all the invitation he needed, suckling Jeff’s fat cock through the fabric of his shorts and jockstrap. The tiger moaned and ground his genitals into Ryan’s face.<br />
<br />
“You done lifting?” Jeff asked.<br />
<br />
“No.” Ryan replied. “More!”<br />
<br />
The tiger pulled away, Ryan’s flaring nostrils following after him. <br />
<br />
“Tell me when to stop.” Jeff said, panting as he loaded more and more weights to the barbell.<br />
<br />
Ryan stayed silent until the tiger brought the total to 700. “Stop!”<br />
<br />
Jeff looked at the barbell, the ends of which were sagging from the sheer weight. “That’s a lot. Are you sure?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah. I can do it,” Ryan replied, speaking with confidence.<br />
<br />
“Okay, then.” Jeff said. “Let’s make a bet. If you can do three reps, I’ll give you my used jockstrap.”<br />
<br />
“Deal!” Ryan said immediately.<br />
<br />
Jeff grinned and stepped into position to spot, his paws under the barbell to catch it if Ryan’s paws slipped.<br />
<br />
Ryan took a breath, then he reached up and grasped the bar with his thick paws. Then the lion braced his feet against the floor. With a mighty heave, he lifted the barbell up and slowly, shakily lowered it down to his chest. Gasps escaped him, his breath hard and quick as he once again slowly lifted the bar.<br />
<br />
“One!” He gasped, arms trembling.<br />
<br />
A pressure began to build in his head, right between his eyes. He clenched his jaw as the beanie on his head began to fluff into real fur. Ryan took a few quick breaths then lifted again, grunting and growling as the bar rose into the air. <br />
<br />
He held the bar as high as he could, then began to slowly lower it again.  Ryan could feel his arms begin to ache as they grew tired from the massive weight currently bearing down on them.  It wouldn’t be long before he’d be forced to drop the bar onto himself, and Ryan realized that he needed to finish this,<br />
<br />
Ryan took a few more breath, the ruff of hair surrounding his head growing ever longer. The pressure in his head built and built. He took a deep breath, then pushed upwards with all his remaining strength. <br />
<br />
He grunted deeply, massive arms shaking as he struggled to lift the 700-pound barbell. Ryan grit his sharpening teeth, the pressure in his head reaching a crescendo as he reached the apex of his lift. Then there was a *pop* as his face pressed out into a leonine muzzle, his mane falling past his shoulders. <br />
<br />
Jeff caught the barbell and pulled it back onto the holder as a euphoric wave of relief struck the lion.<br />
<br />
Ryan yowled as his massive cock unloaded in his pants. His tail twitched as he experienced the most amazing orgasm of his life. The lion’s cock continued to twitch and pulse, his hips bucking for almost thirty seconds, long after the last of his jism had been shot into his jock.<br />
<br />
The orgasmic twitching finally subsided and the lion collapsed, panting heavily on the bench.<br />
<br />
“So, how does-” Jeff began before an unfamiliar voice interrupted him.<br />
<br />
“Boys?” A clerk shouted as he wandered over to them, “I know there aren’t many patrons right now, but could you please keep the volume down?”<br />
<br />
“Sure, sorry about that, my friend is a lunk.” Jeff chuckled and patted the lion’s heavily muscled thigh, “Come on, we’re done for the day. Let’s hit the showers and have some fun.”</p>
