<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I opened the book and instead of the usual stats and figures I was met with a single line.<br />
<br />
“Error! Too many anomalies detected, changes restricted for 24 hours for reality realignment and synchronization.”<br />
<br />
I swore loudly. If I wanted it to shrink back down I’d have to hang around that bastard of a landlord and his massive tasty erec- BAH I was having a hard time ignoring the horny intrusive thoughts brought on by Larry&#39;s dictation. I debated bringing the book with me but decided it would be devastating if Larry found out what it was for. My dick cage was already starting to feel extremely tight so I didn’t have time to get dressed. On the way out I grabbed my wallet out of habit. Larry was easy to find as his cruel laughter was still echoing down the hallway.<br />
<br />
“Larry! Wait!” I called out catching up to him. As soon as I rounded a corner I could feel my dick shrinking back down to a perfect fit inside the chastity cage.<br />
<br />
Larry was just about to enter his apartment and paused smirking at me. “Wow here I thought you’d at least take a few minutes to write our latest little encounter in your jerk off diary. But you’re so thirsty for my cum you couldn’t even put some clothes on before running after me.”<br />
<br />
“Please, Larry, give me the key!” I pleaded, “I’ll do anything. I’ll suck your cock!”<br />
<br />
“Your ears filled with cum or something?” Larry growled. “Like I said I don’t know where it is. My apartment is a mess and I’m not going to waste time cleaning up to look for it when your pathetic dicklet is just a useless nub of flesh anyway. As for sucking me off, I&#39;d be doing <i>you</i> a favor by letting a jizz guzzler like you slobber all over my hog.”<br />
<br />
“Please I’ll look for it myself.” I continued desperately trying to persuade him, “I’ll even clean up your appartment for you!”<br />
<br />
He took a brief moment to think about my offer.<br />
<br />
“You wanna tidy the place up and make it all sparkly? I won’t stop you.” He laughed and let me through the door. The place was an absolute sty. Beer cans everywhere with trash strewn all over the floor. “You can start by cleaning up the bathroom. And be sure to scrub the toilet while you’re in there”<br />
<br />
“The <i>toilet</i>? How is <i>that</i> going to help me find my key!” I asked incredulously.<br />
<br />
Larry flopped down on the couch and turned the football on.  “Well if you’re not going to make yourself useful you can just get out.”<br />
<br />
I felt myself give a little squeak realizing if I wasn’t an obedient little slave he was going to kick me out. “Sorry Larry, I’ll get right on it!”<br />
<br />
I placed my wallet on a stand next to the entrance since I didn’t have any pockets and made my way to the bathroom. As I scrubbed the piss stained porcelain and unclogged hair from all the drains I could hear Larry talking and laughing on the phone from the other room. Snippets of conversation made it’s way to me. “Faggiest fairy I’ve ever met”, “Snivelling little Microdick loser” and so forth. Despite it all my minuscule hard on was straining against my chastity cage the entire time.<br />
<br />
After an hour the bathroom was squeaky clean and hadn’t seen any sign of the key. I went out into the living room and saw Larry at the door collecting a pizza and paying the delivery driver from <i>my</i> wallet without even asking me. I wanted to protest but knew I needed to stay on his good side.<br />
<br />
I continued to collect all the trash around his apartment into a large plastic garbage bag, carefully examining every piece of junk to make sure I didn’t accidentally throw away the key. Meanwhile Larry just laid back, ate pizza, drank beer and watched TV.<br />
<br />
I had cleared away maybe a quarter of the living room when he called me over to him.<br />
<br />
“You hungry?” he asked and I saw there were three slices of pizza left. I nodded and he rubbed the bulge in his pants with a knowing smirk. “Well you’re going to have to work for your dinner.”<br />
<br />
I sighed, got down on my knees, and undid his pants for him. Larry’s giant throbbing erection sprang free slapping me in the face. I hesitantly stroked it up and down for a bit, hoping maybe I could get away with just giving him a hand job.<br />
<br />
“Stop playing with your food” he growled, and grabbed the back of my head and shoved his giant cock down my mouth. I sucked up and down the length of his manly shaft, trying to get this over with and make him cum as quickly as possible but I knew it was futile. His stamina was unmatched by any man I had ever met and he would last as long or cum as soon as he felt like it.<br />
<br />
After half an hour or so I felt the tension change in his dick and knew he was about to unleash his thick seed into me. Even being prepared I was barely ready with the vast quantities of viscous salty semen that exploded from his virile manhood. I was all I could do to keep up and at one point I started choking on his cum, but he placed a hand on the back of my head to stop me from extracting his cock out of my throat.<br />
<br />
As his orgasm abated I was finally able came up for air. The pizza box was empty, he had finished it off while I was pleasuring him and hadn’t even offered me a slice of garlic bread..<br />
<br />
“Okay time for you to fuck off.” Larry said switching off the TV, his wet cock once gain slapping me in the face as he stood up. “I’m going to sleep and I don’t want to hear you clattering around all night.” <br />
<br />
“No please!” I pleaded, crawling after him on all fours, “Let me finish cleaning up, I’ll be super quiet, I promise”<br />
<br />
“Geez princess if it means so much to you then you can come back tomorrow.”<br />
<br />
“N-No! I-I...” I swallowed my pride, and started telling him everything I thought his giant ego wanted to hear. “The truth is I want to be around you as much as possible. You were right I’m obsessed with your big muscles and your enormous cock. Please let me stay by your side tonight.”<br />
<br />
“Get stuffed,” Larry snorted, “I’m not sharing my bed with a fucking flaming homo.” <br />
<br />
“Please! I’ll sleep on the floor if I have to.” I could see my pathetic grovelling was starting to make the bulge in his pants grow despite having just blown a sizable load, “And I’ll make you breakfast.”<br />
<br />
“Fine. I guess you might come in handy tomorrow morning” he finally relented as he headed for his bedroom. I quickly followed before he changed his mind.<br />
<br />
There were clothes strewn all over the hardwood floor of his room. Larry pushed a few buttons on a control panel and the air-con turned on to full blast. He then walked over to the bed and crawled under the covers. God how wasteful.<br />
<br />
“L-Larry” I shivered as I was completely naked. “Can I g-get a blanket?”<br />
<br />
“Fucking needy little bitch, this ain’t a hotel” Larry growled, turning over in his bed and facing away from me “There should be something for you to use under the bed.”<br />
<br />
I crawled down and pulled out a crusty beach towel. Trying no to sob and knowing I shouldn’t push my luck, I crawled into a little ball and wrapped myself in the old stained piece of fabric. Larry immediately began snoring loudly as I fitfully tried to fall asleep with the scent of stale dried cum wafting through my nostrils, making my unruly little dicklet push hard against it’s cage.</p>
