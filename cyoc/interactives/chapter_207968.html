<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The Cerberus pair once again found themselves cuddling on the floor, their fur sticky in some places due to all the intense rutting they&#39;ve been doing the whole evening. Hailey and Lou shared a contented sigh as they snuggled up onto each others&#39; fat, bloated figures, their closest heads nuzzling each other. Still, Hailey&#39;s middle head stared at the ceiling, pensively. Lou&#39;s milk wasn&#39;t enough for her little scheme, and their supply was low enough already. Just where was she to get more, especially now that she was a fat Cerberus woman? It&#39;s not like she could just head to the supermarket like this, she&#39;d cause panic. There had to be some other way to bring her plans to fruition. Plus, she had Lou to consider as well, she may be a lot more intelligent than before, but even then she wasn&#39;t experienced enough to bake anything, she&#39;d been a stray mutt a few hours ago! Hailey needed someone with the necessary know-how and... she held her breath as it dawned on her.<br />
“Hmm... Oho! Y&#39;know, I think I figured out what we need, or rather, WHO we need to get this done.” she muttered to Lou, scritching her belly and chuckling when Lou&#39;s leg reflex began to kick instinctively. Or wiggle, what with how fat they were. After a few more seconds of this, Hailey patted Lou&#39;s belly a couple of times, then wobbled herself to sit back upright, struggling a bit with her bulk. Lou ogled her hungrily, but refrained from giving in to her more base instincts. She watched as Hailey walked towards a nearby counter and picked up the phone. After dialing and waiting for a few seconds, she spoke.<br />
“Hello? Hi, Mr. Cameron! Sorry for calling you so late, but I came back after closing to check on something, aaaand it turns out, we have a bit of a serious issue, sir... hmm? Uhh, oh no, no! It&#39;s not THAT serious, no! It&#39;s the oven, sir.” Lou stifled a giggle at that, and Hailey raised her finger to her lips, silencing the stray. “Yes, it&#39;s busted, it must&#39;ve short-circuited after the last batch, and I didn&#39;t realize it at first... yes, I&#39;m sooo sorry, Mr. Cameron, but you need to come down here to have a look. Plus,” Hailey added, her lips curling into a smile. “there&#39;s also one other small matter I would like to discuss with you... Yes, yes, again, sorry for the trouble, I&#39;ll see you soon.” and with that, she set the phone back in its base with a triumphant smile. She clapped her hands and rubbed them, Lou tilting her heads at the gesture. “C&#39;mon girl, we got a trap to prepare...”<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Joseph Henry Cameron, a middle-aged man in his mid forties, was in a sour mood. <br />
Nursing an intense migraine was already bad enough, but getting a call from his young assistant telling him one of the ovens had broken down and that he needed to drop by the bakery was far worse. Still, Hailey insisted she needed to speak to him about some other matter, so the sooner he got this resolved, the sooner he&#39;d get back home to rest, he thought to himself, as he rode his bicycle to the bakery.<br />
Fortunately, he lived close by, so it didn&#39;t take him long to get to his workplace, the mostly-empty streets giving him plenty of room to cruise along, as he neared the bakery. When he arrived, he frowned, as the shutters were more than halfway down, with a gap that was just high enough for him to crawl under to get inside.<br />
Parking and locking the bike around the closest street lamp post, he made his way to the bakery entrance, tapping the shutters to let Hailey know he had arrived.<br />
“Hailey? It&#39;s me. Could you please raise them a bit more so I can come in?” he announced, but all he got in reply was silence. He tried again. “Hailey! Raise the shutters a bit more, my headache&#39;s pretty nasty and I&#39;d rather not crawl on the floor right now!” he yelled.<br />
Still no reply. Sensing something was amiss, Cameron sighed and got down on his knees. He wasn&#39;t as spry and fit as he used to be back in college, and with a grunt, he crawled under the shutters. The door was open, oddly enough, but the lights were off.<br />
“Hailey?” again he called, and again, no response. Where the hell was that girl? Squinting to see in the darkness, he couldn&#39;t make out much, and it didn&#39;t help that the light switches were near the counter. As he slowly made his way towards the switch, he realized several things that fed his unease.<br />
One, the air was hot and heavy with a musky smell. Two, the floor was oddly slippery, like as if someone had spilled several drinks and then forgot to clean the puddles after a while. Three, he felt his feet touch something damp, like a piece of cloth. Bending down to pick it up, he realized that the cloth was actually a torn bra. How did this get here, he wondered. Then it hit him, it couldn&#39;t be, could it?<br />
Was this Hailey&#39;s bra? What was that girl playing at?<br />
His train of thoughts were interrupted, as he heard the whirr of the shutters behind him go all the way down, further drowning out what little light made it inside the bakery. He did catch a glimpse of someone&#39;s feet standing near the door before the bakery was plunged into total darkness, but he couldn&#39;t make out anything else.<br />
“Hailey, this isn&#39;t funny. I&#39;m tired, my head hurts and all this isn&#39;t helping me feel any better.” he grumbled, frowning. He heard a giggle in the dark, followed by two more. Hailey wasn&#39;t alone? “Who&#39;s there with you?” still no response, which only aggravated the man. He turned around again to reach for the counter, and look for the switch, but ended up bumping into something.<br />
Something with lots of fur.<br />
He froze as his face and hands touched the odd fur, realizing that he could feel it move, and heard it breathe. A bear? Hailey brought a BEAR into his bakery?<br />
The lights flickered on at that moment, as the thing he was touching flipped the switch on. Blinking his eyes at the sudden brightness, the colors drained from his face when he saw what he was in contact with: three dog-like heads stared back at him, their expressions a mix of amusement, innocence and curiosity visible under a mane of messy, wild brown hair; below those, were the biggest pair of boobs he&#39;d ever seen in his whole life, they were even bigger than basketballs; and the furry surface he was touching, a prodigious and soft gut, it was no wonder Cameron had thought it was a bear at first. <br />
“Hhhhaaii!” she said with a wave of her paw, in an awkward but friendly tone. He made to back away from the she-thing, but she was quicker, her paws grabbing hold of his arms in a firm grip.<br />
“It&#39;s alright, Mr. Cameron, she doesn&#39;t bite.” Hailey said somewhere from behind him. He frantically looked back, only to freeze once more: where he expected to find his waifish assistant, stood instead a creature almost identical to his captor, the differences lying in their figure (being more pear-shaped, as opposed to her more top-heavy counterpart), fur color and hair. Her three heads were smiling coyly, as she waddled closer, the man finding himself caught in the middle of the two fat things. His head was surrounded by boob fat, and try as he might, he couldn&#39;t break free.<br />
“Now now, no need to struggle, I promise you sir, you&#39;ll enjoy this...” Hailey murmured, alternating between her three heads, as she licked her muzzles and nodded to her counterpart. The two slowly leaned closer, their collective muzzles barely an inch apart and right above Cameron&#39;s head. His eyes bulged as he witnessed the six heads begin to make out, hurriedly and rather messily, drool dripping from their canine tongues right onto their soft bosoms and his head, matting his hair. He kept struggling, but if anything, it seemed as if his efforts were urging them to continue, as they kept trading kisses with even more gusto.<br />
The man felt completely intoxicated just by being pinned in the midst of the two monstrously fat females, his attempts at escape becoming more sluggish as arousal clouded his mind. They were so horny that it was starting to affect him, too, only he couldn&#39;t begin to realize just how badly he was affected.<br />
Cameron was hot and bothered, yet the migraine that had been bothering him the whole day was also gradually fading away, why was that? And why did his loins feel weird? He wanted to reach out into his pants, which felt oddly tight... in fact, so did his shirt, and his shoes...<br />
Haley and Lou were getting increasingly horny, as their tongues explored each other&#39;s mouths, twisting and feeling their canine teeth, their libido was like a drug, addictive and difficult to ignore. It was only when their faces were starting to have a harder time reaching their partners&#39; that they looked down, noticing that their &#39;prisoner&#39; was pushing them apart with his own swelling bulk and was gradually growing taller, too. With a nod and wink towards Lou, Hailey took a few steps back to better appraise their handiwork: Cameron&#39;s clothes were ripping apart in order to make enough room for his new curvy form, soon laying on the floor in tatters. Hailey whistled, ogling at the developing breasts, is that what it had looked like a few hours before, when she transformed? She licked her chops, drooling as her boss&#39; chest continued to swell, eventually shifting her gaze to his behind. Unlike Hailey or Lou, Cameron seemed to be developing a more extreme hourglass figure, the breasts and butt already matching Lou&#39;s and Hailey&#39;s, respectively, where, out of the three, Cameron seemed to have the smallest gut, just big and soft enough to partially hide his groin. Speaking of which...<br />
“Hmm, my, you look absolutely gorgeous, Mrs. Cameron...” she cooed, Lou eagerly nodding in agreement. This seemingly caught his attention, and groggily, he turned to look at her, confusion plastered on his still-human face.<br />
“W-wuh... wut? Whaa... didju cahll mee?” he slurred, taking a couple of unsteady steps on wobbly legs towards Hailey. Everything felt wrong, his body jiggled with every movement, his clothes were in tatters, yet at the same time, felt good to him. Hailey approached him, laying a paw on his exposed chest.<br />
“Well, would a &#39;mister&#39; have a pair of tits like these?” she chuckled, Cameron&#39;s eyes widening in shock as he finally realized how much he&#39;d changed. Try as he might, he couldn&#39;t even hold the things, they were just so large and heavy, plus there was this odd tightness in them, like they were full. As Hailey gently caressed them, her paw briefly touched one engorged nipple, and that alone was enough to make Cameron shudder with a yelp, feeling an intense heat between his legs. Hailey smiled knowingly and leaned forward, eyeing the very moist slit that was almost hidden away by Cameron&#39;s fatty thighs and belly. “Would a &#39;mister&#39; have such a womanly voice like yours...or such an inviting pussy like this one?” she teased, Hailey&#39;s three heads taking in the musky aroma.<br />
Cameron had no words. He, no, she had been so shocked by this development, that she hadn&#39;t even noticed her two new heads staring (or trying to do so) in disbelief at the expanse of her chest.<br />
It was time to break her in, Hailey mused. She signalled Lou to come over, and guided her stunned but aroused boss over to the counter, Cameron panting as the tightness in her bosom flared up.<br />
“Now now, Mrs. Cameron, me and Lou here are going to take care of you, but we&#39;re gonna have to work together, okay?” she cooed, as Lou got on all fours, her belly and boobs brushing the floor. Lou then turned and sat against the counter, giving Hailey a thumbs up. The latter smiled, and positioned herself behind Cameron, once again keeping her in their middle as she pushed her onto Lou. “Could you help me lift your boobs? They need to be emptied into the pot, there&#39;s something I wanna do with the milk.” the younger Cerberus instructed.<br />
Cameron obeyed, her mind desperate for a carnal release, she didn&#39;t even question the arrangement of their positions: Lou sat on the floor, her paws on Cameron&#39;s hips with her heads taking in lungfuls of the new woman&#39;s musky scent; Hailey placed herself behind Cameron and reached under her armpits, kneading the soft and full breasts, whispering sweet comments and kissing her heads; Cameron was panting, gasping and moaning, as she also squeezed and played with her bosom, feeling the milk squirt into the pot, as well as Lou hungrily giving her new pussy the care it needed...<br />
<br />
By the time the last drop of milk had fallen into the pot, Cameron had orgasmed three times, with Lou greedily lapping up her carnal emissions. <br />
“There we go, we finally got enough for tomorrow&#39;s batch!” Hailey cheered, looking over the two pots filled to the brim with Lou and Cameron&#39;s milk.<br />
“Yu-you want to bake something using our milk? Wuh-why?” asked the older Cerberus woman, trying to catch her breath as she lay on the floor, with Lou cuddling up to her, their massive breasts smooshed together.<br />
“I thought it&#39;s pretty obvious, Mrs. Cameron...” replied the young assistant, beaming. “...didn&#39;t it feel good to change? Isn&#39;t it nice to feel warm, soft, and fuzzy?” she cupped her gut, rubbing it in a sensual way. “Wouldn&#39;t it be great if we could spread this to everyone, make them feel good, too?” <br />
“Hmm...” Cameron looked hesitant, and Lou started giving her the puppy eyes. “...uhh, who is this?” she said, pointing. Lou&#39;s heads whined a little in response, while Hailey giggled.<br />
“It&#39;s Lou, the stray that comes by every day! I dunno why, but he turned into a Cerberus female, and, well, lovingly did the same to me, too.” she came closer to the duo lying on the floor, clasping her hands together and likewise making puppy-eyed expression. “Pleaaaase? We&#39;re just trying to do good by others!”<br />
Try as she might, the more mature Cerberus woman soon caved in to their begging, sighing and patting Lou&#39;s heads. “Alright, fine. This is gonna be an all-nighter... But before we get to work, one more thing: how do you plan on selling the goods when we all look like this? We&#39;ll scare away the clients.”<br />
“Uhh, that&#39;s easy, we&#39;ll just wear aprons to cover our tits, the guts can easily cover our pussies, and we can just pretend to be furry suits and play a voice recording for the free samples on my phone, easy.” Hailey said, a confident grin plastered on all three of her heads. She really had thought of everything, Cameron mused. With a grunt, she heaved and wobbled herself back up, also helping Lou as well, and rubbed her paws. As she made to walk past Hailey, she teasingly slapped her assistant&#39;s massive rear, who yelped in surprise. With a playful smirk, the baker began to get things ready.<br />
<br />
“Oh, and Hailey? You can call me Josie.”</p>
