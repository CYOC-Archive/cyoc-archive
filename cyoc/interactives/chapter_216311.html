<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff tapped the TransDem ‘watch’ a couple of times, looking back up at the braying Scott-donk.  “So you were saying?”<br />
<br />
“You don’t understand,” Scott continued.  “I really do love you,” he said desperately, his big, blue sparkly eyes starting to turn more brownish in color.<br />
<br />
“I’m listening,” Jeff said, holding the small black device and keeping his voice neutral.  The naked football jock just considered Scott-donk, his darkly handsome face completely composed, still sitting on the edge of the bed.<br />
<br />
“My family…” Jeff reached for words, apparently struggling with horniness, judging by the very large and increasingly animal-like donk-dong rising higher from between his legs.  “Please, it’s getting hard for me to think.”<br />
<br />
“I understand,” Jeff responded, brushing his bushy black hair from his eyes.  “Take your time.” He sighed, almost sadly.  “Just do the best you can, and most importantly, be honest, okay?”<br />
<br />
“I am being honest,” Scotty pleaded.  Grey started leaking into the blonde of his increasingly thickening and dense fur-like hair, except where his Mohawk-like mane was darkening.   “I swear… my family… they are a partner in TransDem Labs.  They may seem nice, but they’re horrible… they do horrible things… forced me to do horrible things.”  Tears started running from Scotty’s sad, glossy brown eyes.<br />
<br />
“Why did you lie to me?” Jeff asked directly, putting the ‘watch’ on his own wrist for safe keeping.  “You made me feel like I was going crazy… do you have any idea how bad that feels?”<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry, I’m so very sorry,” Scotty sobbed now, crying openly.  “If I didn’t go along with them, they would have made me kill you.  But I wouldn’t do that to you – I would sooner die myself HAWWW.” Scotty broke down into braying sobs, and Jeff sat quietly, thoughtfully.<br />
<br />
“Just please be honest with me,” Jeff encouraged the donk-jock.  “That’s all you need to do, and I won’t let anything bad happen to you.  I can help you. I promise.”<br />
<br />
“You don’t know how bad they are,” Scotty continued.  “How ruthless.”  He gathered his emotions, his cock bobbed up higher, even bigger, but he took a moment and willed himself to simply be calm. “The truth is, I’m gay – I always have been, and I don’t care about any of this TransDem stuff HEE HAW.”<br />
<br />
Jeff watched as the cock rose right up to Scotty’s mouth, and the donk-jock lost it, simply braying and bucking wildly for a full minute.  Jeff looked away, he didn’t get the pleasure he thought he would out of it.  As long as Jeff had him confined by the limited motion security feature of Scotty’s watch-emitter, he was in no danger of donk-boy rushing him.  Finally Scott quieted down, and Jeff looked back over at him.  “I know this is hard for you, Scotty.  It’s not exactly fun for me.  Just go on, just please be honest, please,” He almost begged.<br />
<br />
“Appearances are everything to my family.  They have their hand in so many things, and know some very powerful people, people who you don&#39;t hear about in the news - but who control the headlines.  Having a gay son was unacceptable to them.”  Scott’s voice got emotional.  “They actually made me straight with that damned thing, made me forget who I really was.  They didn’t like something about me, they would use that to fix it, make me their perfect little son, obedient in every way.” His expression darkened with bitterness and hatred.<br />
<br />
“So if they used this to change you,” Jeff nodded at his wrist, “how did you get your memories back, and how did you restore yourself to gay?”<br />
<br />
“I have an aunt who works at TransDem.  She’s one of the programmers, works with the code.  She knows the units inside and out, as much as any one person can understand them anyway,” Scotty explained.  “She always liked me, and I liked her.  One day she came to me secretly, and restored my memories and real personality and sexuality.”  Scotty’s cock started softening, retreating from where it bobbed in front of his face.  Scotty’s voice broke, “A week later, she was caught helping someone else, and my family killed her.”<br />
<br />
“Damn,” Jeff shook his head, horrified.  “That’s cold.”  Jeff looked back up at Scotty, his body looked completely like a donkey now – it had been changing nearly the whole time he had been talking.  Fur covering his body, abdomen expanding to a barrel-like chest and belly, hind legs and now proper forelegs, even his size had changed to match the real, genuine animal.  But as he started talking about his aunt, his now big fully-donkey penis started relaxing and retracting into the sheath attached to his belly.  “I guess I shouldn’t be surprised you lied to me, with parents that cold.”<br />
<br />
“You don’t know how terrifying it is being in this family,” Scott the talking donkey said, looking at Jeff hopefully.  “I never wanted to hurt you.  I mean, I truly, deeply love you.”  His ears flattened and head looked down, shaking sadly.  “I can’t possibly expect you to believe that now… after the hard time I gave you with the ChroniVac and pretending not to believe you… but you have to understand I was only trying to protect you.”  He looked up with conviction in his brown eyes, which was quite a feat for a donkey.  “If I had told you the truth, you would be dead now.  In fact, I don’t even know how we’re both still talking – I can only assume you somehow managed to disable the security feature on the watch.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I did happen to see that,” Jeff confirmed.  He watched as the donkey’s cock and sheath grew smaller, to human proportions.  Pinkish hide started showing as the donkey’s fur started thinning out.<br />
<br />
“Thank God,” Scotty breathed in relief.  “At least we can figure something out to get you safely out of here.”<br />
<br />
“I should tell you in all fairness, I’m not gay, Scott.  I like girls,” Jeff said honestly.  “I was able to revert myself with this thing, and I have no intention of ever going back.  When I think about last night, it’s like watching someone else’s memories.  It’s not me, and I don’t feel anything when I think about it.”<br />
<br />
Scott looked quite wounded, considering his face was that of a donkey now.  “I… understand.”  Then, reassuringly, “It’s okay.  The important thing is, you’re alive and I just want you to be safe and happy.”  The donkey looked right into his eyes with sincerity – it wasn’t the same as when the human Scott did it, but it was still quite poignant somehow.  “You would be safer without me.  I can stay here and protect you, cover your tracks and erase the records of you.  If they kill me too… at least I can die peacefully, knowing you escaped.”<br />
<br />
“It’s okay, you’re safe here.” Jeff got up, walking around the bedroom.  “We’re not actually in your real bedroom any more.  I activated one of the safety protocols I found, and this is a – I think it’s called a ‘bubble construct’ – a recreation of your room in another place or dimension or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
The donkey looked surprised.  Then, “That’s great!  But how could you have possibly had time enough to find that?”<br />
<br />
Jeff shrugged his broad, muscular shoulders.   “Dumb luck?”  He walked over Scotty.  “There’s still a few things I don’t understand.  Discrepancies.&quot;<br />
<br />
“Like what?” The fur was retracting from Scotty’s face as the pink color warmed It up.  Jeff couldn’t see the long donkey tail at all now.<br />
<br />
“Like back in my room before I was brought to the locker room, the brain pattern setting for the ‘Chameleon Clothes’ was at the recommended setting of 50% - I checked all the initial settings before starting it.”  Jeff walked back to the bed, picking up his shorts off the floor.  “I never changed that setting, yet when my transformation was complete, somehow it was set to 80% and I was transported to the locker room before I could change it.”<br />
<br />
“The unit could have been defective, had some issues,” Scotty offered.  The sheath was gone now, and the fur had withdrawn significantly.  “It doesn’t happen often, but there is the occasional defective unit.”<br />
<br />
“Also, when I first appeared in the locker room and took my gear off, I was ripped.  But I had a good layer of fat over the muscle when I transformed in my bedroom.  It was all gone – as if I had changed further as I was transported there.  Yet that transformation package had already completed, so it indicated.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, definitely sounds like a malfunctioning unit,” Scotty said, his torso starting to reshape itself now.<br />
<br />
“I think you must be right,” Jeff agreed, “because when you kissed me that first time in the locker room and went to shower, the next thing I knew, some of my gear was back on even though I had already taken it off. Like a glitch.”<br />
<br />
“Definitely.”  Scotty’s body continued to shift.  “What else?”<br />
<br />
“I got so emotional when you came back.  I cried, I gushed.  I don’t do that,” Jeff said plainly.  “The real me doesn’t, and the memories of the linebacker me doesn’t either.  Sure I have emotions, and sometimes cry... but not like that.”<br />
<br />
“Considering the dramatic changes and being thrown into a new environment, it’s been known to happen sometimes,” Scott suggested, his ‘Mohawk’ mane gone now.  “It’s been known to happen on occasion, overstimulation.”<br />
<br />
“And I was sooo fucking horny,” Jeff slid his shorts on, grabbing a t-shirt and walking over to join Scotty again.  His dark features were like chiseled granite, his brown eyes shouldering.  “I may have been a couple of years younger, but I had already been hit by puberty – so I had some idea of how horny I should get and how quickly.  Same with the linebacker memories.  Yet as the day went on yesterday,  my horniness ramped up way beyond anything I ever experienced before.”<br />
<br />
“I know,” Scotty confessed, “It was my fault.  I wasn’t trying to mess with you, honestly, but I had to keep you distracted so that you wouldn’t start questioning things too quickly while my parents were watching.  This was a training exercise that everyone has to go through, and I couldn’t afford to give anything away.”  Scotty held his arms open as if in surrender.  “I didn’t want them killing you.  I’m sorry, but I was just protecting you - I had to buy us some time so I could figure out how to get you out of there.”<br />
<br />
“Okay… I have to admit it worked quite well.”  Jeff slipped into the t-shirt.  “It was so overpowering that I had to give in when we were in the shower, just to shut my hormones up so I could think straight.”<br />
<br />
“Sorry,” Scotty said meekly, his body shifting more quickly now, having changed nearly back to his previous height.  “I won’t let them hurt you.  But at least you found the watch emitter and was able to get us out of there.  When did you find it, anyway?  You must have had it for at least a good ten minutes to do all you did, and that’s with extreme speed and luck.”<br />
<br />
“It was on your wrist when you finally started snoring last night.”<br />
<br />
“But I didn’t wear it to bed,” Scott said, confused.<br />
<br />
“Actually, you did.”  Jeff held up his wrist, and with his other hand tapped a control.  The black emitter watch vanished.  He tapped the air next to his wrist where it had been, and it reappeared.  “You just didn’t want me to know you were wearing it.  You’re very protective of it.”<br />
<br />
Scott shook his head, embarrassed.  “You’re right.  And I am protective of it.  Can you blame me?”  His body started filling out, muzzle more than half receded, his teeth a more normal size.<br />
<br />
Jeff grabbed his sneakers off the floor and sat back on the bed.  “What really got me is how the memories of my real life kept fading in and out.  I noticed the watch right away yesterday, because most people don’t wear them to the showers – even if they are waterproof.”<br />
<br />
“Well, now you can understand why I did,” Scott said.<br />
<br />
“Yes.  I also noticed how often you looked at it.  It wasn’t like someone watching their heart rate or checking the time… It seemed more akin to someone with a cell phone, almost like an addiction.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, considering I’m up against my own family, and the stresses involved – that thing is the only leverage I have against them, so I guard my power carefully.”  Scotty’s body started feeling heavy, and he started sweating.<br />
<br />
“Jock sweat sure does stink,” Jeff commented.  “That’s one of the first things I changed after my sexuality, when I got ahold of this.  It’s nice to have the body without the stench.” Jeff smiled.  “Hygiene, and all that.  Girls like it.”<br />
<br />
Scott looked up at Jeff, her body expanding fast.  Her voice was higher.  Her eyes gazed into his, with a love-sick gleam.  “You are so handsome.”<br />
<br />
“Thank you, Scott, but I don’t date pigs.”  He put his sneakers on.<br />
<br />
“Oink?” Scott asked, confused once again.<br />
<br />
“I realized you were using the football play last night not so much to relax me as to reinforce my 80% dominant new personality – I started realizing the more that was active, the harder it was for me to access my real life memories and thoughts.  In fact, it was all manipulation, the cards were stacked against me from the beginning. Seemed like every time you touched your watch something new would happen to keep me off-balance.”<br />
<br />
“Oink told you I had to protect you, buy time,” Scott said, wiping some snot from her snout.  Her new sow sex dripped, and she was once again having difficulty thinking.  Her corpulent body had two neat rows of sow teats going down her very large belly.<br />
<br />
“Yes, you did,” Jeff conceded.  “And you sealed your fate more and more with every lie you’ve told me this morning.  “I call it the Pinocchio Variation.”<br />
<br />
The Chronivac watch beeped, and the pig got a puzzled look on its snout.<br />
<br />
“Oh, that,” Jeff looked at the watch.  “That just means you’re done.”<br />
<br />
“Oink?” Scott asked.<br />
<br />
“Instead of making your nose grow every time you told a lie, I programmed something I thought would be more…interesting.”  Jeff stopped right in front of the fat sow, and looked it in the eye, knowing that Scotty was still in there.  “For every lie you told, you would take on more and more properties of a donkey, until you were an anthro donkey boy.  Then if you continued lying – which I hoped you wouldn’t (but I always leave room), for part two you would lose your masculinity and turn into a jenny.  If you were a hopeless liar and kept going, you would then turn into your final form… a big, fat, greedy pig who only cares about herself.”<br />
<br />
“Oink?” Scott gulped.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I gather you noticed the word, ‘her’.  No more ramming for you.”<br />
<br />
The pig squealed in agitation.  When it finally settled down, Jeff continued.<br />
<br />
“Yes, your family is indeed a partner in the Chronivac experiments.  You asked me yesterday what kind of a person would use such a device, much less sell it.  Let me show you.”  He pressed the Chronivac emitter and large mirror appeared in front of the sow.  Jeff peeked around from behind it, the sow gaping with her big snout hanging open, little eyes wide with fear.<br />
<br />
“One of the first things I did when I found this on your wrist was increase my IQ, making myself the smartest man on the planet – probably even in history.  Not for vanity, but because I realized if you were the scumbag pig I hoped you weren’t, I would need to learn this little device super fast, and have the presence of mind and intelligence to get ahead of you very quickly to survive.  See, you were sus, and I couldn’t take chances.”<br />
<br />
The pig squealed, trying to lunge at him, but enable to move her piggy hooves from where they were planted on the floor.<br />
<br />
“I know you don’t truly care about anyone but yourself - I basically sat back and watched you literally make an ass of yourself, proving you&#39;d kill me without hesitation. I know you only brought me here for sport, you arrogant bastard.  I know who you really are, Maximilian Von Schmidt.  I know you’re not gay at all, and not a kid by any stretch of the imagination… that you were pulling the world’s strings from the shadows before the Nazis rose to power in Germany, before the British Empire enslaved much of the world, and that your name won’t be found in any history books because the most precious commodity of your legion of doom is anonymity.”<br />
<br />
Jeff got right up in the sow’s face, his dark features and brown eyes suddenly instilling real fear in the sow.  “I know you’re a member of a nameless organization that’s only whispered about or laughed off as fairytale, and that’s by design… a shadow group sometimes tied to the Freemasons or the Illuminati, but that actually predates both of them.  I know you’re all entitled, one-percenter pigs who think the rest of the world exists to serve you, and that you had your great granddaughter killed for helping your great great grandson when he fell in love with a girl you didn’t approve of.  I know you have him tucked away in a dresser as a hat, and that you turned his love into a dude, then recycled him in one of the Chronivac narratives as a prince.  How very green of you.  I also know she later got captured by a witch and turned into a sow… the one you’ll soon be replacing, Max.”<br />
<br />
The pig snorted and squealed some more.<br />
<br />
“I know you made me gay so you could better control me – you probably hoped I would have chosen being a woman so you could have exploited that, but you had to improvise – and you were sloppy, because I know those weren’t glitches - you&#39;re just old and having a hard time keeping up with all of the new conventions of your organization.”<br />
<br />
Jeff pointed his finger in the sow’s face.  “You think you can do whatever you want with impunity.  You think you’re above the rules, and that you’ve subjugated the world, feminizing western culture and encouraging the whole LGBTQ movement as part of your plan to lower the world’s population and to create enough social chaos to have one more thing distracting people from noticing what you’re doing in the shadows.  Get everyone drunk, get everyone addicted, sexed up and tuned out so you can have your way and fuck us all over.”<br />
<br />
&quot;At least I gave you a chance,&quot; Jeff said sadly, leaning away for a moment, pensively.  &quot;That&#39;s more than you gave the rest of us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff leaned back in until he was only a few inches from the mastermind sow’s snout, his face a study in controlled rage, his body so hot that steam actually came out the big jock’s nostrils.  “I’m here to tell you there are still a few raging bulls left who’ll see through your shit storm.  It’s over, Max.  You lose.”  Jeff growled, “I’m not taking over your empire.  I’m going to dismantle it.  I’m going to take the technologies you squandered on fear-mongering and controlling the population, and see that it’s used to save lives instead – to cure cancer and disease.  And I’m starting now, by sending you to the pig pen you deserve.”<br />
<br />
“Time to bring home the bacon, Maxy.”  Jeff pressed a button, and in a fraction of a second, the sow that was responsible for the inception of the Chronivac experiments appeared in a muddy pen, and splashed down on all fours into the grime.  A few seconds later, a very large, curious boar came up from behind, sniffing Max’s sex, before mounting her, driving his large corkscrew cock deep into her pussy, impregnating her.  Max simply squealed in pleasure for a half hour, somehow knowing she would be nursing piglets with her big fat dugs in no time.</p>
