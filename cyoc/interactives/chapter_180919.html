<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff wasn&#39;t sure what was going on. The wish he&#39;d made back at the fair was supposed to bring them closer, but with this kind of age gap he wasn&#39;t so sure. The more he thought about it the more he worried about it. A teacher and a student. Even if Paul was 18, the idea just felt like it wasn&#39;t right. &quot;Damn it no. I&#39;m 18 too.&quot; However another glance down at his body made him woefully aware that wasn&#39;t the case. He was a good 100 pounds more than he had been. A lot of it was muscle, but the bulk was starting to come with it. <br />
<br />
&quot;We need to go back to that fair,&quot; Jeff said. He stepped inside the weight room but stopped. &#39;Shit...&#39; His mind wouldn&#39;t register anything other than the massive sweaty hunk working out. Paul had removed his shirt and the definition in his body only seemed to have grown. Every bit of him bulged. Jeff tried to keep his eyes above the other man&#39;s waist, but that was the most impressive. Even with shorts on, there was a clear outline running down the side of Paul&#39;s leg.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey coach. I think you were right!  I can barely believe it, but look at me!&quot; Paul throws up a flex. His arm looks to be 20 inches around. Even with all that extra height, he&#39;s somehow able to keep that muscle big and full. &quot;And I&#39;m so much stronger too!&quot; he moves down to the 100+ pound weights. Some of the heaviest in the gym and then lifts them with ease. Not 6 reps. Not 8. Not even 10, but a full twelve reps. &quot;I&#39;m not even tired!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh-huh...&quot; Jeff stares in disbelief. His body is sending him all kinds of mixed signals and he can&#39;t make out the correct form of action. It didn&#39;t help that all his blood seemed to be going to his wrong head, making it even harder to think. &quot;You&#39;re huge...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah! I can&#39;t believe it! But...&quot; Paul lowered his voice a bit. He swiftly moved closer to Jeff. &quot;You know something else got way bigger too.&quot; One of his big hands moved to his cock, giving it a nice tug. Blood rapidly flowed to the large member. It quickly hardened. &quot;Wanna see?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff nodded. He couldn&#39;t help but wonder what it looked like. Never had he been one to be curious about another man&#39;s dick, but this one seemed so interesting. But was it the dick? Or Paul? &quot;Woah...&quot; his mouth hung open as he saw it&#39;s thick long size. Had to be at least 10 inches long and looked to be as thick as a beer bottle. Jeff felt his mouth starting to water. &quot;It&#39;s huge...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh-huh,&quot; Paul was moving closer. More stalking like an animal than anything else. His entire body hovering over Jeff&#39;s, blocking any escape. &quot;I also wanted to apologize...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Apologize?&quot; Jeff swallowed, hard. His mind was on that cock. He wanted to please it so bad. Feel it in his hands. Taste it. He licked his lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. I lied to you earlier. I said that I didn&#39;t want to have sex with you.&quot; Paul started grinding up against Jeff&#39;s body. His hard cock, only grew harder. &quot;That was a lie. Actually, I can&#39;t stop thinking about it. Ever since last night I&#39;ve been having these strange thoughts of your naked body and wanting to plow it so hard,&quot; Paul said. His body seemed to be acting on it&#39;s own. &quot;Can I?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff felt his ass tingle with excitement. &quot;I&#39;m not gay,&quot; he declared, almost trying to convince himself as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Neither am I,&quot; Paul smirked. His body only moved closer. He used his strength to easily turn the other man around. The tip of his penis poked at Jeff&#39;s asshole. <br />
<br />
Jeff brought in a heavy breath. The feeling rocketed through him. &quot;Oh God,&quot; he cried out as the pleasure overtook him. His knees went weak and body felt helpless, yet he loved feeling the strong body behind him hold him up. Jeff made eye contact with Paul and nodded. His body craved this feeling. He couldn&#39;t get rid it. <br />
<br />
Paul eagerly obliged. He thrust into Jeff&#39;s back and to both their surprises it slid right in. That didn&#39;t deter Paul at all. The feeling of his cock being gripped by Jeff&#39;s asshole was better than he even expected. It seemed to shift and form over his penis, grabbing it in all the right places then loosening up again. It was such a wild experience yet he didn&#39;t want it to stop.<br />
<br />
On the other end Jeff felt his body invaded. The weird feeling of being whole brought him peace, yet the pain of having something deep inside him unsure. He gasped and gripped onto Paul&#39;s arm as his dick throbbed with excitement. He gave into the pleasure. His body fell limp against the wall and his body released.<br />
<br />
The warm feeling filling his ass seemed to bring him back down to reality. He stared up at Paul. &quot;Need a hand?&quot; the big burly jock asked.</p>
