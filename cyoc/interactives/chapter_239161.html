<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer quickly reached down and plucked it from the floor. No one took notice save for Rose, who cocked an eyebrow. Jennifer sheepishly smiled, giving Rose a thumbs-up. They turned back to their notes, Jennifer&#39;s hardly with any writing. Her cocks were distracting her, and now she was worried about what a ten would do, especially in the classroom. She didn&#39;t want to leave again but knew she may have to.<br />
As she sat there wondering what would happen, she became aware of her wedgie. She hadn&#39;t noticed before, but her panties were tighter than before. and her twin slits were almost exposed now. She tried to adjust her seat, finding little relief as she did so. She tried again and still no resolve. She looked down at her hips and saw what the issue was.<br />
Her hips and backside were growing. She saw the skirt fabric riding a little on the side, slowly inching up. Her butt had always been a decent size, but now it was getting bigger before her eyes. &#39;Great. That roll is influencing my ass,&#39; Jennifer thought. She stared as her butt began to lift her more and more. The skirt was getting tighter, mostly in the back, and Jen wondered how far the growth would go. She still wanted to hide her cocks, but this growth was limiting her chances. As her butt continued to expand, Jen couldn&#39;t help but wonder what she was going to do to Kyle&#39;s face the moment she saw it. He had caused her so much discomfort, and he did it in less than two days. Maybe she could use it on him, make him unable to speak and flatten him into a pancake, or make him disappear forever. She realized that one was a little over the top, but all the same, she wanted to kick his ass.<br />
Her thoughts of vengeance distracted her from how high she was in her seat. Her previous measurement was 42 inches around her butt, just above decent, but now she seemed to be encroaching on something closer to 50 inches. It didn&#39;t take long to connect the dots. Her transformation was adding ten inches to her waist and hips to give her a 53-inch butt. She had rolled a ten, which Jen had thought gave a random transformation. Now she realized that was half of it; sometimes it will use that factor to grow or shrink something, maybe even use that as a total count number, like four would give her four arms, or eight would give her 8 cup sizes. Jen smiled in triumph at her discovery, though only for a moment. Once her ass was done its growth, she settled down again. She copped a quick feel of her thighs with one of her lower arms, which were tucked away under the shirt and skirt. The skin there was squishy and soft. She could feel the curve of her ass as it went out further than it should have. It filled the skirt a lot, pulling the hem up nearly two-and-a-half inches. Which thankfully still hid her cocks, but if Jen were to bend over, it could spell trouble.<br />
Class ended on cue, thankfully getting everyone else out of the room first. Once most of the classroom had left, she went to stand. Jennifer immediately felt her rear weighing down behind her as she stood straight. Looking behind herself, she saw the large cheeks pushing out into the skirt&#39;s fabric. They had increased significantly, and her grown hips made her gait slightly wider. She looked stunning from the front and the back now. Except if she were seen fully in the front, then the back wouldn&#39;t be nearly as eye-catching. She tried to move and felt her whole lower body stumble a moment before she caught herself. It was like lugging around two weights on her lower back. Another step proved fruitful, and soon she found her footing. She almost had a sway to her walk, which she felt was kind of sexy. She continued out into the hallway, catching eyes left and right, including some of the girls. Her cocks were still dormant, not poking out from the hem. Her second pair of breasts were still crunched in by her second set of arms, but she almost seemed to forget she had them to worry about.<br />
She waltzed around the school, her last class coming up soon. Passing her locker, she dropped off some items before carrying on. The D20 still sat in her jacket pocket, clutched even tighter than before. &#39;Not letting this go rolling, not around here,&#39; she thought to herself. As she walked by the main lobby, she became aware she had to use the bathroom. It was confusing, as it felt like she had to use her cocks rather than her usual methods to go this time around. Without much else to do in the ten-minute break, she rushed herself to the stairs. There was a bathroom that no one really used as it was down a thirty-step flight of stairs and hidden around a corner. It had been there when labs were held in the basement until about six years prior. Now, it was usually vacant save for the janitorial staff and some local traffic.<br />
Jennifer stepped into the space and went to use the toilet. It was very weird, especially considering she had to bend one of her hoses around to make it work. She got it in the end with a lot of difficulty. She exited the stall and used the sink, placing the die on the counter. Scrubbing her hands, all four, vigorously and then her face, she felt relieved that she could handle the situation so well. She wiped a bit of soap from her face and dried her hands off. The die was still sitting there, almost looking up at her in anticipation. She stared back at it, wondering how such a feeble object could bring her so much chaos. It was designed to inconvenience her thanks to Kyle&#39;s curse, but she still felt like it was more than a punishment.<br />
Suddenly, she heard a noise from the doorway. The hooded figure from earlier was there, peeking around the corner before suddenly peeling away. Jennifer went to go after them, as they had just seen her with four arms out when she suddenly heard talking. What stunned her was both voices were familiar. One was Abby, who had yet to see Jen&#39;s changes and would probably freak out the moment she was seen there. The other voice was even more stunning, especially to Jennifer.<br />
It was Kyle&#39;s voice. <br />
She knew it! He had been watching from afar the last two days just to see how she was progressing. He was blending in with a disguise and an excuse he was sick. But now Jen had confirmed it was him. His cover was now blown, but she was uncertain if he knew she could hear them or not. &#39;Safe to assume he doesn&#39;t know, as these walls are still pretty thick,&#39; she considered. &#39;But what am I gonna do about Abby? She&#39;ll flip if she finds me. Maybe... Aha!&#39;<br />
Beside the corner stall designed for wheelchairs, ironically in a bathroom down a flight of stairs, was a maintenance panel. Jennifer had spotted it several times but never considered looking at it that closely. No one had been in there to conduct maintenance for a while, so it was safe to say it would stow a person. Giving a little push on it with all arms, she pushed it inward, the door revealing a small storage area beside the room. A good place to hide, and Jennifer would use it. Slipping in carefully, she closed the door in time as Abby, of all people, entered the bathroom.<br />
One thing that Jennifer had forgotten to notice was she left the die on the counter by the middle sink. She couldn&#39;t see anything from her angle, just the middle and closest sinks. She spotted the D20 close to the edge. Jennifer listened as she heard her sister enter a stall, taking a minute before standing to wash up. Steps were heard as Abby came into view. She was at the far sink from Jennifer&#39;s position, just out of the line of sight. The water turned on, the soap dispenser spurted, and then another moment before the water shut off. It was quiet as Abby towelled off her hands, but then it got way too quiet for Jennifer&#39;s liking.<br />
Abby had noticed, next to her at the middle sink, there was a D20. It looked oddly like hers, with a discernable mark on the side with a 4 in the shape of a C. She had misplaced her die a month prior and had pestered Jennifer to help her find it. Considering she had bumped into that strange kid walking out of the woman&#39;s side of the bathrooms, whom she had confronted for being a possible pervert, it could very likely be theirs. Or that they had somehow obtained it. Regardless, it looked like hers, so she saw fit to make it hers again.<br />
Jennifer holds back a gasp as Abby appears at the middle sink, picking up the die to inspect it. Then, to her absolute horror, Abby lets it roll across the counter, accidentally jumping to the floor.<br />
Within her line of sight, not five feet from her position behind the panel door, Jennifer watched the D20 spin and land on a...</p>
