<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Hazelnut, the former human, was getting used to his new life the stork had dropped him into, albeit begrudgingly. He hated being the son of two male fauns but felt even worse when his infantile instincts took over. When he came back to himself, he recalled with horror the bathing and sweating in a sauna with his two supposed daddies and how as a baby he felt very happy there. The idea of being naked with two men with no underwear or loincloth, showing off everything, was so repulsive! Maybe other cultures did that, but he had never, thank you very much! Or at least until he become a faun. As an oblivious baby, he splashed and gurgled joyfully amongst the goat-men, basking in their touches, hugs and attention. In his ignorance, Hazelnut thought to himself that it was only a miracle that these homosexuals had not done any worse than cuddling and nuzzling him with kisses. He was also unaware of how much effort the two fauns had put into providing a good environment for their new son. Hazelnut had his own nursery with a rocking crib and playpen, filled with toys. The two fauns were always happy to rock him to sleep and their baby was fed abundantly with milk, vegetables, ripe fruits and a little minced meat. Bread with cheese was now a staple for him and his healthy appetite promised a young strapping goat-man for the future. Perfect to dance, hunt and help with wine-making!  Of course, when Hazelnut was in his Jonathan headspace, he just sourly missed his video games and tried to forget how engrossed he became with his blocks, pacifier and favourite teddy bear when he was back to thinking as a baby. <br />
<br />
However, one day he was happy to have stayed in his human mind when the black-haired centaur announced that he and his husband could indeed go on a little vacation for some together-time as their two female had agreed to take care of their little Hazelnut for a half-moon. That got Jonathan&#39;s attention. The two goat-chicks with the multiple breasts!?! Well, one of them, the one with the four big human breasts, anyway. Now that really looked like fun! A wet dream come true with more boobs than he could grasp! It was through his anticipation and excitement that he managed to retain his human mind as he counted the days with impatience. When Sunray, the blond centaur, placed him in a wicker basket to take him to the two females, Hazelnut was wide awake with anticipation. <br />
All fauns laughed as they arrived to the house of the two females, Peach and Citrus, for in his basket Hazelnut was already reaching out with his arms towards the two goat-women. Citrus giggled and picked him up, and Hazelnut wasted no time to grab her breast, obsessed as he had become. Alas for him, his baby instincts had taken over and he aimed his mouth towards one of the goat teats of Citrus. He inwardly yelled in frustration. He wanted Peach! The one with the four human boobs! Not the one with the two goats teats and eight udders in all! But no, one of her teats had started twitching and leaking drops of milk and he had latched onto it, as if famished and submerged by an irrepressible desire to feed off that lactose beverage that promised such a delicious taste.  And he had suckled as if his life depended on it, while all four fauns gushed and Darknight, the black-haired faun, chuckled as he said that when it came to food and in particular milk, their little cutie was always fast. <br />
<br />
Indeed the ten days swept by in a blur of boobies, delicious no matter which mind Hazelnut felt. His infantile urges be damned, nestling amidst the more than ample breasts of Peach was heaven! Like the most comfortable pillows in the universe! And for once the advantage of his small size meant that the boobies appeared enormous to him! And of course not a bit of silicone! And the milk! First choice! It filled him and it was too bad that he fell asleep right after. As for Citrus&#39; teats, they appealed so much to his babyish mind that he always woke up from his cuddles with her with a full belly. Full belly that the two fauns tickled and kissed and patted, congratulating him on his healthy appetite. Hazelnut could bask in the warm glow of their love that made him feel so fuzzy and which prompted him to wonder which one was his mommy and then deciding it was not important in the end. He could touch Peach&#39;s comfy boobs as much as he desired and he got to see them totally in the nude during their communal baths. So much better than his two so-called &quot;daddies&quot;! Why could it not be those two females that adopted him instead? He was the luckiest boy he knew. Everyone in his class and acquaintances would kill to see so much ladies&#39; bosoms and have a privileged access to them! It&#39;s too bad they treated him like a stupid baby instead of a muscular virile guy...  When they go out for strolls, every faun around cooed at him and poked him like all adults love to poke babies but they pretty much ignored him. Seeing the packages of male fauns, Hazelnut with Jonathan&#39;s mind could only hope that he&#39;d be as endowed when he grew up. It would be the sole consolation he could see. In fact, the idea of a harem of female fauns with big chests seemed the most appealing fantasy he could day-dream about. Alas, female fauns said he was adorable and cute, but not in the romantic way he so desperately wanted. He wanted to be an adult powerful man, not a silly baby every faun tickled and gushed over with coos and sweet compliments! Besides, he could do without the stench of faun perspiration once they exercised enough to work out a sweat. Especially the males. Their armpits were too prone to smelling strongly. Females were better but after a long day picking out fruits and dancing outside, they had the good idea to wash often. Hazelnut feared smelling as bad as he grew up. Problem was, the more time passed, the more his baby mind associated the strong bodily smells with the fauns that took care of him, so with home and a sense of security. The more he indulged in staying close to his mesmerizing and precious faun breasts, the more he associated the smell with comfort, pushing him into a daze that favored relegating his human thoughts in the back of his mind, plunging him deeper into his new mindset.<br />
<br />
As a result, when his two fathers arrived after their vacation to pick their son up, the sweet baby was calmly sleeping and when he awoke in the arms of his two male carers, even if he missed the rich milk coming straight from tits that could be reached on the spot, the smell and  warm chest reassured him instantly. They perspired the smell of fauns that were loving to him and that he recognized as such from past experiences, from before the other fauns with the warm filling milk. And the body hair added a layer of warmth that was truly welcome and not disgusting or repulsive at all. As a male faun, Hazelnut hoped to grow such an impressive pelt of animal and body hair in the future. One day, because for the moment he was happy resting in the arms and against the body of a loving member of his own species.</p>
