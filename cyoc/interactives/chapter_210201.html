<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Aidan was already crawling around his flat, getting ready for his classes after his morning routine. With his cum-filled socks on his feet, stiff sock gloves on his hands, and pacifier one in his mouth, he opened the door for Mark and Luke, surprised that Luke was there as well.<br />
“Morning Aidan. Slept well?” Mark asked him, before heading inside. He could see Aidan was finished changing into his clothes this time, but that could be him being late.<br />
“Morning Mark, Luke. Yeah, slept like a baby. Luke, why are you here?” Aidan answered to Mark, crawling back towards the kitchen for some coffee.<br />
“Mark hired me to help him out at home, and we decided to have me move in with his family. Now, as we have the same way to school, we came both to collect you.” Luke explained. It was what his mind created as an alibi for being forced into servitude for Mark, without being able to say that.<br />
Aidan´s eyes widened in surprise, but nodded anyway. He didn´t comment on it, it was Mark´s choice, after all. And if Luke had accepted, who was he to say anything.<br />
Mark set up his laptop on the table, making sure again the changed bullies at his brother´s school were set up right. It wouldn´t do if he made a mistake, and he hadn´t had the time to check it through completely while there with them.<br />
Satisfied by their profiles, he copied Aidan´s flat over to his house, above Luke´s flat, with the same rules as not being seen from outside, and without the kitchen, as he wouldn´t need his own anymore. Just the needed electronics would be in the normal kitchen, so he could prepare his drinks. As soon as Aidan left the building, his things would move over to his new rooms, leaving his old flat behind empty. It wouldn´t be his much longer, but stay empty and clean, if Mark ever sent him back to life there.<br />
Luke used his time to clean a bit for Aidan, as Mark had asked him to do before ringing the bell. It was both part of a distraction for Luke, as well as making sure the new part of his house would be tidy.<br />
Ten minutes later, the trio left for their classes, Mark helping Aidan walk. Mark sent Luke into class, telling him to keep notes, as he would first help Aidan reach his classroom.<br />
But similar to his brother´s situation, just as they turned around the corner to Aidan´s classroom, one of his classmates decided to comment from the sidelines. “Oh, look at that. Baby Aidan found some idiot to help him move around. How can a grown-up man be that depended on others? Can´t walk, can´t use a toilet. Just a big, dumb baby, aren´t you, Starns?” said the slightly bigger, unknown man with a sneer.<br />
Mark was fuming in seconds. It was the same as with his brother, he made changes to them, making sure nobody noticed the changes occur, and then they were bullied for being not normal.<br />
“I can´t do anything about it, Ben, and you know that. If I weren´t sick, I would love to life without needing so much help, thank you very much.” Aidan answered him calmly, and it seemed that this had happened a few more times, at least in their memories.<br />
“Pah, sick. You are just too lazy to work your legs like a man. I don´t buy all that “I´m sick and can´t help it” shit, and you know that, too.” Ben said, sneering still.<br />
Mark let go off Aidan at the door, seeing that Aidan could support his body with the tables inside, before turning to Ben, who had followed them. “And who are you, his new caretaker?” he asked Mark with his sneer still on his face.<br />
Mark didn´t answer directly, but put up his laptop on the nearest desk, quickly adding his signature comment into the text input in Ben´s profile, “Mark rules”. Then he answered: “I´m Mark, a friend of Aidan, who has no problem with helping his friend.” And after a short pause, he continued: “And I´m also your worst nightmare, idiot.”<br />
Ben looked annoyed by being insulted by Mark. “Who are you calling an idiot?”<br />
“The one who called me that first, you. But it doesn´t matter. You said Aidan should work his legs like a man, right? It´s funny, that you say that, seeing as your legs don´t work normal either. They feel as if they are glued together, and you are unable to separate them, right? Not only that, but you also can´t jump around, seeing as there isn´t enough strength in them to do so.” Mark explained with his own sneer.<br />
Just as Ben was about to answer to that, his legs and feet snapped together, and without that Mark mentioned it, his jeans, boxers, shoes and socks all shred themselves, so his legs and feet could really be glued together, with nothing in between. His eyes widened in fear, not understanding what just happened to him. He put his hands down to hide his cock and balls, the first already starting to get erect from being seen by others.<br />
“What the hell did you do to me?” Ben nearly screamed at him, trying not to get the attention of the whole room. Lucky for him, beside himself, Mark and Aidan there were only two others here, and both were talking and not turning to him.<br />
Mark grinned evilly at Ben. “Just showing you what it is like to be dependent on others. But you could still help yourself with your arms, so let´s fix that, too. Your arms will also feel as if glued to your body, along your front, with your hands glued around your cock and balls like a cocoon, without any opening beside at the very lowest point of it, right by your fingertips. Wouldn´t want for your piss to be stuck, right?”<br />
Ben´s eyes widened even more in fear, as his shirt ripped away for his arms to be “glued” to his front, leaving him completely naked. With his hands cocooning his genitals, he was unable to do anything himself anymore. Turning slightly, he opened his mouth to shout for help.<br />
But Mark intervened before he could do so. “Ahh, no, you are unable to scream for help. You can only ever speak at a volume of a whisper. The only exception will be if you are in any kind of mortal danger. But as you aren´t a statue, you will need to a form of possible movement. Seeing as you can´t use either your legs nor your arms for that, let´s say you can only slither like a snake or a worm, a fitting punishment, don’t you think?” Then Mark laughed loudly.<br />
Ben´s eyes were impossible wide in horror, staring pleadingly towards Aidan, then to the other two students, but no one looked his way, so they didn´t help him. He toppled forward and fell, hitting the ground with his cocooning hands first, making him yelp quietly. He started sobbing quietly, turning his pleading look towards Mark, the only person he could see from his position on the ground. “Why?” he whispered.<br />
Mark grinned evilly at him. “I hate it when someone is insulting my friends, or annoys me. You did both. Maybe a few days like this will show you what problems Aidan has in another way. Now, I´m not a total monster, I see how being naked is troubling you. Maybe your shred clothes can form something new around you, robust enough to not rip when you slither around, like a second skin? That should work, don´t you think?”<br />
All off the sudden, what shreds laid around Ben´s feet levitated up in the air, separated by what they had been before. His former shoes merged around his feet into a single, bigger shoe, covering up his glued together feet. His socks, together with his boxers, wrapped around his hands, crotch and ass, forming something similar to a diaper around him. It wasn´t as big and puffy as a real diaper, but it would be enough to keep him from leaking.<br />
His jeans wrapped around him from the top of his new shoe to the top of his boxers, forming a cocoon around his glued legs. His shirt did the same around his torso and arms, trapping them underneath. But as he couldn´t move them anyway, it wasn´t more restricting than before. Now, instead of being naked, Ben looked like he had before, only that the clothes made him a worm instead of a human.<br />
Ben was still crying in misery from the ground, only slightly thankful for not being naked anymore. “Please, I won´t do it again. Just turn me back.” He sobbed quietly at Mark.<br />
Mark quietly laughed at that. “No, I don´t think so. That wouldn´t be a punishment then, would it. At least you are still able to move. Another reason I´m this angry with you is that my own little brother, who had his own problems, was also bullied right before my eyes. His wrongdoers have it worse than you, as they will be stuck in their place until I decide to let them move again. Useful to all the others, something I guess they weren´t before. Now, as a final touch towards you, Ben. Just to cover my tracks, you can´t ever speak about what I did to you or others, and everyone will see your current form as normal, not believing you if you say otherwise. Now, I must be on my way to my own classes, so be good. And I will ask Aidan if you bully him again, so be warned, Ben. This can become much worse for you if I think you don´t learn a lesson. Bye.” Without waiting for a response, Mark left the room, winking towards Aidan, who just reached his seat and unpacked his supplies.<br />
Ben, shocked about Mark´s warning, cried some more, but his arriving classmates ignored him mostly, not helping him. So, after being ignored by about half of them, he slowly wiggled and slithered around, towards his seat, noting that the clothes-cocoon was stopping him from getting hurt by rubbing the ground. It was some work for him to get up into his seat without limbs to help, but after a few tries got in. Only to realize that now, he had no way of taking notes or work on anything while being a worm in every way but in size. His bag, which he had set on his table before encountering Aidan and Mark, was useless to him, as he couldn´t open it, nor use what was inside. So, he cried even more about his now miserable life.<br />
Mark reached his course just in time, slipping in next to Luke, who was already focused on their professor to keep detailed notes for Mark and himself. Mark had enough time to check over Ben´s profile, making a few, small edits to it.<br />
First, still being a bit angry at him, he made Ben incontinent, so he would use his diaper-like underwear. He also raised the sensibility of the inside of his hands, so he would know exactly that he pissed himself. On the other side, Ben wouldn´t be able to cum from anything but being embarrassed, which would raise the embarrassment even more. At the same time, the diaper-like underwear would clean itself, making sure he wouldn´t need to put on a new pair.<br />
Then, Mark made sure Ben wouldn´t need to take of his clothes for the time being, he would be able to clean them like he would his naked skin normally. To make sure he didn´t try to remove the clothes, Mark made them stuck to his body, and only others would be able to help him out or into clothes. Not that it would have been easy to do so without being able to use his limbs.<br />
Lastly, he made sure that if Ben asked anyone for help, that wasn´t in any way insulted by him before, he would receive the help he asked for. For anyone insulted, it would be their own decision if they wanted to help the worm out.<br />
Saving the profile with a password, just as he had done with his brothers bullies before, Mark turned towards a better thing to do, namely, thinking what he could change next for either Aidan or his pets, namely Chris and his friends.<br />
Ben, still in tears, suddenly felt his piss shoot out into his hands before dripping down into his underwear, making him turn beet red. The embarrassment, even if nobody noticed, was enough for him to cum next, making his hands fell even more dirty to him. That he also had lost the content of his bowels was not noticed by him, to distracted by the other two accidents he had. And he had no idea why he just had done any of that.</p>
