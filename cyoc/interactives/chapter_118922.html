<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The High School seemed to be even busier than Jen remembered it being, even during a school day or some other major event, though she had to admit that when she was going through High School Moon Lake&#39;s population was likely lower than it was now. And since the the town as a whole had latched onto the dance, Jen figured it made some sense. A larger city population would mean more students in the high school and more people that had likely come to dance or keep an eye on their own children. Having the dance in the school gym was also a safer means for those attending to be in their respective were forms, as most people outside Moon Lake wouldn&#39;t go cruising around the schools and being indoors, even if they drove buy the school they wouldn&#39;t see much. And even if they did, the common explanation was that it was a costume over a costume.<br />
<br />
&quot;Things still seem to remain busy here,&quot; Jen commented to Samantha and Frances from the back seat of their car.<br />
<br />
&quot;Halloween always seems to do that,&quot; Samantha commented, &quot;Especially in the way Halloween is celebrated these days. It&#39;s the perfect holiday for weres... our difference from humanity is easily hidden.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen nodded to that, as she did remember enjoying the Halloween Dance a lot when she was in High School as well. The dance had the same ideas back then, which meant that not much had changed. In fact the only thing that Jen seemed to notice that had changed was simply the size of the dance, which cycled back to Moon Lake having a larger population than it did when she went to school there. She supposed that&#39;d equal a positive for the city. They slowly exited the car and made their way toward the High School and it&#39;s gym. They entered through a set of metal double doors that were closest to the gym itself. The gym itself was a bit bigger than what one expected for a town the size of Moon Lake, but it provided for plenty of room and made things comfy when the stands were extended for graduation. In theory they could also do it for games, but since Moon Lake&#39;s sports teams really only played skirmishes within Moon Lake, games weren&#39;t something that they had. Playing other schools might not necessarily expose the were population, but it would potentially draw attention to how fit everyone in Moon Lake was, which could lead to greater investigations.<br />
<br />
Some soft music was heard as they came in through the doors, which clearly sounded more romantic than anything else, though it was likely only just a pause from the typical Halloween themed music that was often played. They made their way toward the door that directly lead to the gym only to see it swing open to see an adult male werefox exit the gym with a brown furred werecat, which to Jen&#39;s nose was familiar.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, Martha, William,&quot; Frances spoke politely as she took the lead.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, Samantha, Frances, ... and Jen, nice to see you again,&quot; Martha smiled and then ushered the werefox forward, &quot;this is my husband, William.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pleased to meet you,&quot; the male werefox, William, spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure,&quot; Jen answered as she took William&#39;s hand, though as they shook hands, she noticed that he wrapped his other arm around Martha to hold her to him. It wasn&#39;t possessive and looked rather loving, which had to mean that he was bonded to her and seeing Martha smile at the contact was enough to make it clear that she was presently happy. It was a reminder of all that Jen had lost though, and that made her sigh and look down slightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is everything...?&quot; William began to ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m just getting over some issues related my husband&#39;s murder,&quot; Jen said slowly, &quot;but I am doing better. The killer was caught and ultimately got what he deserved.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... hopefully the party brings you some joy then,&quot; William said slowly and sounding a bit unsure, but he did a bit better.<br />
<br />
By this point Jen did recover and nodded. She thought she saw Frances give a small smile as she nodded, but that wasn&#39;t her focus. In many ways seeing Tad being happy and being safe was something that did give her pride. She didn&#39;t really mind if she remained a wallflower in her role as chaperone with the Twists, she just wanted to see Tad do well. What caught her a bit by surprise was when William and Martha then slowly moved around them to head out into the night.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re not staying?&quot; Jen asked to Martha, &quot;Moon Lake has sorta turned the school&#39;s dance into something the whole town gets involved in. You&#39;re free to stay if you like...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It looks nice,&quot; Martha gave a small smile, &quot;but we&#39;ve generally liked giving out candy on Halloween. I&#39;d actually like to see what costumes little weres dress up in...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Most costumes aren&#39;t that much different from what you&#39;ve seen before,&quot; Samantha gave a small chuckle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe... but we bought candy after the wedding,&quot; William commented, &quot;it&#39;d be a waste not to give it out to kids who&#39;ve put up with a lot the past couple of weeks between a rogue and other nonsense.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha and Frances both nodded as William and Martha headed out. Jen waved politely to one of her pride-mates and then looked over to Frances and Samantha who smiled and nodded to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;You did well there,&quot; Frances smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... with Lionel Ulysses caught and dead, I&#39;m better,&quot; Jen answered. &quot;Tad is safe and I know Jeff will be proud of him... Though they mention this wedding... I trust it went well?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All things considered and the situation... it went rather well,&quot; Samantha said slowly, &quot;not without some drama and not without some issues that will continue on for the next few days, BUT things did go well... given the situation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that&#39;s good,&quot; Jen said, &quot;every young couple deserves the right to be happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that they made their way into the high school gym. Some small things had changed since her time in high school, but there was a lot that had stayed the same. By the door ran a like of specially designed rubber shoes that looked more like they were to fit over a cow or horse&#39;s hoof, which made sense. Since the Halloween Dance was a costume party/dance and one were Moon Lake&#39;s weres sometimes came in their fursonas, it was entirely possible that a werecow or werehorse would wear an over-sized costume that fit their bodies that were much larger than other weres and would need something that would prevent their hooves from doing damage to the gym&#39;s wood floor. It was something that Jen remembered. That hadn&#39;t changed. One thing that had changed was the music. She remembered that the High School band commonly played at least SOME music at the dance with an occasional Halloween themed song picked out and played on a boom box. That had changed, as they had an actual DJ and a series of speakers to play the music.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Skulk forwarded the money for it and allowed for the town to have fun with the Halloween Dance,&quot; Samantha said to Jen, noticing Jen&#39;s surprised look to where the DJ was at, &quot;and it&#39;s provided plenty room for people to have fun and not having to devote time to play the music... and offers more room for actual requests on music to be played.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is certainly a change,&quot; Jen noted.<br />
<br />
She looked across the gym and noted Tad and Amy dancing at one point in the crowd on the center of the floor. There were a few that were likely adults also dancing and there were a few in their were forms. Which was something that showed how the Halloween Dance had gone from a high school dance to something for the whole town.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let us get a drink,&quot; Frances said to Jen, &quot;and move on from there.&quot;</p>
