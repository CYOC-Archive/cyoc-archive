<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">John sat patiently on the counter in the bathroom as Katie removed the makeup from his face.  Katie continued to wipe his eyes.  &quot;You know, you&#39;ve been a good sport about this tonight.  I&#39;ve had a lot of fun hanging out with you as &#39;one of the girls&#39;.&quot;<br />
<br />
John smiled with his eyes still closed.  &quot;Thanks.  It was actually a lot of fun.&quot;  He thought for a moment.  &quot;I wanted to say it&#39;s like wearing a costume, but it&#39;s more than that.  I can&#39;t really come up with an analogy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Katie agreed while moving to wipe John&#39;s other eye.  &quot;My body was only changed slightly compared to yours, so I think I know what you mean, but yet I can&#39;t imagine what it must have felt like to essentially be inside the body of a totally different person for a few hours.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In the morning, we need to go back to that shop.  I know we&#39;ve been saving for a vacation, but imagine how much more amazing that vacation would be if we went as different people.  Maybe we could even change every day!&quot;  John started to think of the possibilities.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, the prices were a lot cheaper than I expected.  Maybe I can get some everyday wear there and I&#39;d be able to keep that great figure.  It&#39;s cheaper than a gym membership and it&#39;s faster without creepers watching me work out too.&quot;<br />
<br />
John reached out to put his hand on Katie&#39;s waist, but with his eyes closed he missed slightly.  &quot;I like you just the way you are.  Please don&#39;t feel like you have to make yourself thinner for <i>my</i> benefit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no,&quot; Katie disagreed.  &quot;I know I&#39;m a bit overweight, but not &#39;fat&#39;.  I&#39;d prefer to be a little thinner for my own self esteem and health.  Although would changing my body to be different via magic clothing actually make me healthier?  ...or am I the same and it&#39;s just re-shaping how I look?&quot;  She finished wiping John&#39;s eyes and he opened them to look at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s done more than simply re-shaping how we look.  I think what I&#39;ve got happening between my legs is evidence of that.  This magic didn&#39;t simply flatten my penis.  It re-wrote my anatomy down there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie rubbed John&#39;s thighs.  &quot;I know I promised you sex tonight.  We can still try and find out exactly how that anatomy of yours works.&quot;<br />
<br />
John leaned forward and wrapped his arms around Katie and started kissing her passionately.  She reciprocated and held his body close with her right arm behind his back and her left hand sliding up under his skirt.  Passionate moans and groans filled the bathroom until Katie suggested they move to the bedroom.  John hopped down from the counter and they hurried hand-in-hand to Katie&#39;s room and shut the door behind them.  Although they were the only ones in the house, it gave them piece of mind that nobody would walk in on them.<br />
<br />
Katie quickly dropped her skirt, pulled off her shirt, and laid down in the center of the bed.  John pulled off his T-shirt and tried to climb on top of her, but discovered that the skirt restricted him from straddling her.  He stood up, unzipped and dropped the skirt, and climbed back on top of Katie.  Katie couldn&#39;t help but laugh at the sight.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; asked John.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Katie apologized.  &quot;Seeing your body that&#39;s half male and half female struck me as funny.  Your top is the gorgeous man I&#39;m used to, but below the waist you look like a woman.  It&#39;s an odd sight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it is weird,&quot; confirmed John.  &quot;Normally about now my dick would be fully erect.  Maybe it&#39;s some kind of phantom limb feeling, but I feel like it actually is...until I look down and see absolutely nothing.  I want to be inside you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie ran her hands down the sides of John&#39;s torso.  &quot;And I want you inside me, but there are other things you can put in me...or I can put in you.&quot;  She pulled at the sides of the panties John was wearing and pulled them down.<br />
<br />
John adjusted his balance and kicked off the panties.  He gently laid his body down on top of Katie and started moving his body in a thrusting motion as he normally would have.  He lightly latched onto Katie&#39;s left earlobe between his teeth and pulled gently.  He placed his left hand on her right breast and rubbed her nipple between his fingers.<br />
<br />
Katie took her hand and slid it down John&#39;s body to his pubic hair.  Slowly running her fingers through until she found a fold in his skin, she carefully inserted two fingers causing John to gasp.  Katie smiled at his reaction and instructed him to roll over.  He rolled off of Katie and laid down beside her.  Without removing her fingers, she repositioned herself so she was closer to John&#39;s crotch and pushed her fingers in further.  John was quite wet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god,&quot; groaned John.<br />
<br />
&quot;You like that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s so different than anything I&#39;ve felt before.&quot;  He breathed heavily.  &quot;Wow!&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie smiled.  &quot;I haven&#39;t even gotten to the good part!&quot;  She kissed him on his stomach and then found his clitoris.  John let out a deep moan and grabbed the bedsheets with his hands.  Katie continued making small, pulsing movements while pushing gently on his clitoris.  She then made small circles around his clitoris, alternating directions and changing pressure.  It didn&#39;t take much effort for her to make John climax.  She slowly pulled her hand out of his vagina and rested it on his chest while snuggling up close.<br />
<br />
John rolled onto his side and put a leg over Katie and an arm around her.  &quot;That was amazing!  Thank you for that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My pleasure.&quot;  Katie smiled and looked into John&#39;s eyes.  They kissed briefly.  &quot;The best part is that you can go again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I should return the favor first.  Now that I&#39;ve felt it from the other side, maybe that experience will help me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe, but every woman is different.&quot;<br />
<br />
John climbed down to Katie&#39;s waist.  &quot;Well let&#39;s find out!&quot;<br />
<br />
They took turns pleasuring each other several times and finished by fingering each other at the same time.  Eventually, Katie spotted the clock on her bedside table and suggested they get some sleep.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose,&quot; said John, rather disappointed.  &quot;I guess I was enjoying this new sensation and trying to make the most of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t blame you.  You&#39;ll be back to normal in a few hours and then maybe we can try it the old fashioned way.&quot;  Katie kissed him on the cheek.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m looking forward to it.&quot;  John gave Katie a squeeze and got up from the bed.  &quot;I&#39;m going to go clean up before bed.&quot;  John grabbed his toothbrush he kept in Katie&#39;s room.<br />
<br />
Katie pointed to her dresser.  &quot;There&#39;s some pajamas in my fourth drawer down.  You can borrow them if you&#39;d like.  Take a satin pair and enjoy how it feels on your legs.&quot;<br />
<br />
John said nothing, but took out the bottoms for a navy blue pair of pajamas and took them to the bathroom.  He returned a few minutes later wearing the pajama bottoms with his T-shirt.  &quot;Yeah, they do feel nice.  They fit good too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And they&#39;re a little stretchy in the waist so you won&#39;t tear them when you return to normal while you sleep.&quot;  Katie got up and grabbed her own toothbrush and some pajamas and headed to the bathroom to get cleaned up.<br />
<br />
After she left, John took the opportunity to explore his new anatomy.  He didn&#39;t attempt to pleasure himself, but did feel around and try to become familiar with himself knowing that in the morning he&#39;d be back to normal.<br />
<br />
A few minutes later, Katie returned in pajamas that matched the pair which John was wearing except hers were a deep red.  They laid down together with John spooning her.  Before long, they were asleep.</p>
