<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">John ran over to help his soaking wet wife but something seemed a little different about her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you alright Carrie?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm fine John it's just a little *Hicump* water. Oh excuse me! I guess the surprise gave me *Hicump* the hiccups!&quot;<br />
*Hicump*<br />
*Hicump*<br />
&quot;Whats wrong John?I'm *Hicump* fine!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No you're not Carrie, you're blowing up!&quot;<br />
Carrie looked at herself and saw he was right. Every time she hiccuped, she grew a little.<br />
<br />
*Hicump* Carrie could feel her chest try to press up a bit. She didn't feel bigger, but...lighter. She slowly began to place her hands upon her chest.<br />
<br />
*Hicump*Her hands shot outwards, Carrie was having difficulty moving. She began to wiggle her fingers and noticed their resistance to movement was steadily increasing.<br />
<br />
*Hicump* Carrie could feel a tightness within her bra now. Her breasts had begun to spring forward this time. Her pants began to feel more snug around her waist. She was just now starting to realize what was happening to her.<br />
<br />
*Hicump* The growing pressure began to make her feel uncomfertable. It was a feeling of tightness that scared her into thinking she would pop, but it only meant her skin was just beginning to stretch.<br />
<br />
*Hicump* Her chest seemed to bounce as air began to jump around in her body. She tried lifting her arms up to her breasts to examine them, but was just unable to bend her arms far enough to reach, and her puffy fingers couldn't move much anymore.<br />
<br />
*Hicump* She began to notice her butt began to feel pretty big against her tightening pants, and she was starting to feel like human blow-up-doll.<br />
<br />
*Hicump* She could feel the curves of her legs straightening out as they too began to stiffen with air, as well as her arms being pulled up, all the while her chest continued to develop into something a little more generous.<br />
<br />
*Hicump* She could no longer move a muscle. Every inch of her skin felt tightly pumped.<br />
<br />
*Hicump* Carrie felt her skin stretching, and her clothing tighten. <br />
<br />
*Hicump* *Hicump* Carrie was starting to grow faster than before.<br />
Carrie let out a muffled groan as she felt the pressure multiply.<br />
It was becoming too much to handle.<br />
<br />
*Hicump* *Hicump* Her pants began to tear as her hips widened graciously, and her butt inflated like two round balloons,<br />
her underwear skin-tight against her bulbous bum. Her breasts gently lifted out, giving her a new set of c-cups. The feeling of her breasts inflating was a pleasing one, but mixed among the several other emotions she was experiencing, she could only stare off blankly, trying to ignore the powerful sensations building up inside her as she became an overinflated  blow-up-doll.<br />
<br />
*Hicump* *Hicump* *Hicump* Carrie could barely hear anything over the sound of her hiccups and the air bouncing around inside her body. Each new hiccup caused her fillings to cycle around inside her as it continued to make room for more. It massaged her from the inside, which was calming as well as pretty ticklish. Her breasts had grown another cup size, and her legs had billowed outwards beautifully, giving her an all new, ridiculous curve.<br />
<br />
*Hicump* *Hicump* *Hicump* Carrie's body was getting huge. Her shirt rode up her stomach as it made room for her enormous chest. Her arms, legs, and torso inflated to match her growth, but her curves had more give, and continued to grow faster. Her shirt was now tightened against her torso, her bra squeezed into her body uncomfortably. A ripping sound began to ring out as her underwear began to reach it's limit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry Carrie, I'll go get help!&quot; Said John as he rushed back to the information center to explain what was happening.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh that's all?&quot; said an employee that he found.&quot;Your wife only has a case of the Hicumps. It's a type of hiccup that causes macro inflation. Anyone can get it just by drinking from, or falling in certain ponds or rivers. She'll be fine once she pops, she may even get a new body out of it!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;POPS?!? Oh no.&quot; With that, he ran back to where he left his parade balloon wife.<br />
<br />
*Hicump**Hicump**Hicump* more inflation hit Carries body just as John arrived and her features exploded outwards once more. She heard a soft snapping sound, but immediately recognized the feeling of her breasts freeing themselves from her bra which fell to the ground limply, although her shirt still battled to keep them maintained. A ripping sound continued to ring out in the park as her panties began to tear, unable to keep it's composure around Carries amazing bum and extremely wide legs that would give Jessica Rabbit a run for her money.<br />
<br />
*Hicump* Carrie's shirt was now skintight and somewhat transparent as it stretched around the orbs beneath, each were about the size of beach balls. Her pants was tight around her waist, although they looked more like shorts as they rode up against her enormous rear, simply revealing her bits free to the world as her underwear finally ripped in half.<br />
<br />
*Hicump* Carrie was starting to realize how big she was. More so, she began to feel the pressure in her mount as her skin began to tighten. She could feel he body become a little less soft and a little more taut. She was becoming full.<br />
<br />
*Hicump* Her shirt now revealed an undercleavage as it rode up to make room for her squished, weather-balloon-sized breasts, with an exposed lower curve to match. Now about ten times as tall as normal, Carrie was quite a sight to behold.<br />
<br />
John's face began to express worry, but Carrie continued to slowly inflate like a blow-up-doll, pushing her towards twice the size of a parade balloon. Her breasts began to round out, too tight to grow outwards any further. Her skin began to smooth outwards greatly, showing that every part of her body was now occupied by air.<br />
<br />
*Hicump* Her breasts jiggled as more air found it's way into them, her nipples puffing out to make space. <br />
<br />
*Hicump* Her fingers and toes began to overinflate.<br />
<br />
*Hicump* Carrie's body was trying desperately to make room, and quickly running out of options.<br />
<br />
*Hicump* Her butt stretched outwards further. Her skin began to actually kind of hurt.<br />
<br />
*Hicump* Her breasts pushed out slightly. Her shirt suddenly popped up, now only wrapped tightly around her neck, fully exposing her two titanic globes.<br />
<br />
*Hicump* Her face began to feel a bit puffy. She was filled to the brim.<br />
<br />
*Hicump* She wasn't sure air even entered her body. Creaks and groans rang out from her balloon-like skin until finally, BOOM!</p>
