<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The tall, lanky, vaguely-Asian man known as Mister Akemi flicked his short black bangs aside, straightened his business suit and hovered ominously into the small college town of Fort Lance. As one of Ty&#39;s newly created reps for the Hundred of Port City, he was assigned to help with finding magical boy candidates and tinkering with the resulting powers to ease the effort on Ty&#39;s part. Oh, sure, many of the other representatives were stock anime critters, but wasn&#39;t being a guy who could bang as-is just good foreshadowing?<br />
<br />
Flicking his magic toolbox into existence and activating the time stop (invisibility was one thing, but actually getting to observe busy scenes with any sense of leisure another), he contemplated the flows of magic that Ty had established. Searching out a wish from within a heart, he found something alarmingly blatant from this far away. Excited for the great work to begin in earnest, he flowed across the line of power in the stilled world like a cloudy black water droplet.<br />
<br />
The words &quot;I wish to be a fairy tale hero&quot; were whispered to oneself, and &quot;(so I can corrupt all these stories the way I want)&quot; was hidden behind it, the stirrings of sexual desire in that boy&#39;s honest hope.<br />
<br />
Compressing shadowy cloud-form into a younger boy in overalls and a yellow hardhat (just a quick theme, for now), Mister Akemi resumed time while standing next to his potential new hire.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey there mister!&quot; Sam said, the blonde generic white kid with sparkling princely blue eyes turning aside in a mildly disturbing display of prescience. &quot;Are you here to grant my wish?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty had not provided (sufficiently detailed) special instructions about what to do if the children knew they were coming. But maybe the big historical firsts are supposed to be special in magical boys material, even if they get surpassed by protagonists, so the Mister rolled with it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah!&quot; Mister Akemi responded immediately, briefly lifting to tiptoe in excitement. &quot;Is that wish what you really want?&quot;<br />
<br />
No further than had he said it Sam was up in his face, breathy and hopeful, and giving the nod of an unambiguous destroyer and a whispered &#39;yes&#39;, disastrously intimate. The contract was sealed, and Sam began a fairly conventional magical boy transformation. His generic t-shirt and jeans faded into a soft white light, and the pinkish princely pantaloons of Prince Charming popped into puissant existence. Glassy blue slippers, white gloves (oh, those&#39;d be coming off for a transformation cycle just you wait) and of course that blue-puffy-shouldered pink mess of a barely-buttoned shirt.<br />
<br />
What came next was the soft whirling of light and flowers that was a barrier world forming.<br />
<br />
&quot;So this is...Solver Reflection.&quot; Prince Charming said, looking down at his hands and watching throwing-roses form and vanish as instinctive use of magic more or less caught up to him. &quot;Mister, are you getting this?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mister Akemi&#39;s turn to rapidly nod back came, and he said &quot;Oh, definitely. An overlayed world type, designed to impose fairytale principles and allow for reality translation when necessary to enact story for...&quot;<br />
<br />
The rep rummaged through his bag and pulled out a sparkly gold-rimmed magnifying glass. He stared around at random things that weren&#39;t Prince Charming and finally Prince Charming&#39;s bulge, before putting the glass away and going &quot;Oh, this&#39;ll be good. All according to the plan. We&#39;ll need you to fight sins and stuff, standard deal. Should be pretty instinctive, just go with the flow and do what you see fit.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam grinned creepily, the Prince Charming facade indescribably tending toward passion.<br />
&quot;And what if I do you?&quot; a question posed seemingly jokingly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, sure, we can do that.&quot; Mister Akemi answered immediately. &quot;Uh, go ahead and touch me, I&#39;ll be fine. Fun fact, don&#39;t worry about needing to be anywhere, look behind you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Prince Charming turned around, and saw a (slightly translucent) ordinary untransformed Sam wearing the clothes from before, kicking back and reading a book of fairy tales in a nearby chair. Translucent Sam waved hello.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s a Daydream.&quot; Mister Akemi explained. &quot;It&#39;s like, you, but as a respawn point if you lose a fight. Also, a substitute for when you need to be doing something else. Everyone will think he&#39;s the normal you, he&#39;ll go around doing whatever you should be doing automatically, and you&#39;ll fuse with him and gain whatever experiences when you transform back. If you&#39;re close enough, no one will notice magical boy you if it&#39;d raise questions. No more having to worry about getting out of class or away from family when an emergency happens. You can even control him remotely if you want, try it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Daydream Sam gently put down his book, stood up, and joined Prince Charming in being overly invasive in Mister Akemi&#39;s personal area before pulling him into a group hug, boners obvious. Mister Akemi demurred fake-embarrassedly at being squished between two bodies of a shiny new magical boy...but affection or not, corruption could use pacing!<br />
<br />
&quot;So, uh...&quot; he said, resisting the urge to melt into a blob to escape the power of hugs, &quot;You wanna blow this joint and we&#39;ll go fight some monsters?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thought you&#39;d never ask.&quot; Prince Charming said with a giggle, releasing the hug of doom and letting Daydream Sam go back to idly passing the day with books. &quot;Let&#39;s go on patrol and take this stuff for a test drive!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mister Akemi and Prince Charming left Sam&#39;s house in the suburbs without any attention from Sam&#39;s boring single father Mike Charming. His mother Brunhilde Rione and Mike weren&#39;t that compatible and separated once Sam was old enough to take care of himself and financial matters with the Charming and Rione families&#39; arrangement had been dealt with. The two boys floated over rooftops for a bit, before Mister Akemi was pretty sure nothing alarming was trying to stand around in the regular world.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guess most of the stuff&#39;s hiding.&quot; he said as they circled back to above Sam&#39;s house. &quot;I&#39;ll show you how to sneak into the metaphor world real quick, see if there&#39;s any sin of note. Just feel the flow of magic, then try to &#39;open&#39; it right where you&#39;re standing. If you aim too far away you&#39;ll get one of those inexplicable anime scene transitions, but if you aim close enough you target the abstract instead.&quot;<br />
<br />
Prince Charming pulled open the air, and then he was suddenly in a dark green pine forest, floating above the podzol and looking at an ominous castle. Mister Akemi stepped in alongside him.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, here we are.&quot; the rep said, rummaging about his toolbox. &quot;Most of this is just imaginary junk made up to fill the scenery, meaning you can do whatever you want to it and not worry about collateral damage. Drop nukes, pound some other prince into the dirt, plow every farmboy that walks on stage, and most of it will either bounce right back or just repop somewhere else appropriate later. Nobody will be harmed except explicit enemy targets, and you&#39;ll know what those are. One&#39;s hanging out in this castle, go prune &#39;er. I&#39;ll make up stuff that&#39;ll be useful to help with the storytelling, but your power is to be really, really good at that too so you can just pull it in. Bash her with magical boy powers and she&#39;ll dissipate into harmless metaphors. Good luck sport, I&#39;ll be cheering you on from the sidelines.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right.&quot; the prince confirmed, manifesting a large rose to use as some form of mace and approaching the castle. A large black dome of stormclouds crackled into existence over the castle courtyard, so he approached the large wooden gate covered by an iron portcullis.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am Prince Charming, let me in!&quot; he demanded of the gate, just to see what would happen.<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot; the gate said, denying responsibility. &quot;I&#39;m a gate. Ask the gatekeeper.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, fine,&quot; the prince said. &quot;<i>Gatekeeper</i>, let me in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nuh-uh.&quot; some ambiguous man said from vaguely above and to the side of the gate, behind heavy stone walls and some grate thingy. &quot;I know how these stories go, if I let you in you&#39;ll destroy the queen. Now I&#39;m rooting for you cuz she&#39;s an evil queen, but she&#39;s cast a control spell on everybody here and we can&#39;t do anything that&#39;d directly oppose her, so we&#39;re stuck doing irrelevant stuff or nothing. She&#39;s even put up an unbreakable storm and hired a bunch of mob agents.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trying not to think too hard about what the mob was meant to be metaphorical of right now, Prince Charming had another idea. &quot;Okay, but what if I just go around somehow?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t tell you,&quot; the gatekeeper said, &quot;but me not telling you should tell you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s a dumb riddle.&quot; Prince Charming said, planting his rose-mace-thingy into the ground near the wall and attempting to dig a hole.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot; the gatekeeper acknowledged.<br />
<br />
Prince Charming abused the power of anime transitions and dug for what seemed to be a long while under the castle wall, piling up a very obvious dirt pile outside.<br />
<br />
Elsewhere, the evil queen shouted &quot;Guards, guards!&quot; and rallied a bunch of stereotypical Roaring 20s gangsters. &quot;There&#39;s a magical boy digging a hole into my castle!&quot;<br />
<br />
She pointed at a magic mirror she had standing around for some reason, which showed some mildly-filtered video of Prince Charming shoveling dirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do something, go on, shoo!&quot; she ordered, pushing along several mobsters out of her ominous throne room slash battle arena. &quot;Open the gate, open the gate!&quot;<br />
<br />
Somehow hearing this order from all the way over there, the gatekeeper guy shrugged and pulled the gate-opening lever so the guards could get out and run down Prince Charming&#39;s tunnel or something.<br />
<br />
Mister Akemi, who had been sitting around outside on a rock while eating popcorn, shouted down &quot;Hey, Prince Charming, they opened the gate to send guards after you!&quot; to which the prince frantically ran out of the hole and proceeded to rush past the mobsters running out the open gate, prompting much confusion and random poorly-animated gunfire. He sprinted through the castle halls, gratuitous levels of tommygun bullets bouncing off his frantic throwing of magical roses, only for him to trip on an electrical wire inexplicably creating a carpet bump (why wasn&#39;t he flying again?) causing him to faceplant into the carpeted ground and end up surrounded by mobsters.<br />
<br />
Instinctively, he corrupted the story. Instead of finishing him off where he stood...the mobsters secretly wanted to bang him! Two of the burlier men grabbed him by the arms, and hauled him off to the dungeon in another transition that didn&#39;t really describe what was happening beyond a blurry sense of being carried down stairs and into a jail cell, still being held in place.<br />
<br />
A smaller mobster pulled down the prince&#39;s trousers, revealing a rock hard boner.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw, so the upstart invader finds this hot, huh?&quot; he said, gently gripping it and starting a handjob that almost immediately had Prince Charming thrusting. &quot;We&#39;ll really have fun breaking you in.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shifting into a blowjob for a bit, the mobster swallowed the cum he almost immediately milked out of the boy, then another orgasm&#39;s worth, and another...the boy moaned with joy and a side of relief as his plan was working.<br />
<br />
&quot;Seems like magical boys sure have some crazy stamina.&quot; he said. &quot;Men, let&#39;s see if his behind&#39;s up to no good.&quot;<br />
<br />
The strongmen hefted the prince up again, grabbing his legs and giving the small man a chance to pull down his own pants to ready his cock for the prince&#39;s hole. Despite the mobsters being intentionally rough, Prince Charming was inexplicably lubed up, tight yet accessible, cleanly warm, and very happy with all this. Jerking off the prince constantly until pounding brought his own cumshot, the mobster thoroughly soiled the prince&#39;s clothes with sticky white fluid.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, you guys have at him.&quot;<br />
<br />
With those words, the mobsters carrying the prince finally grinned, forced him to a bunk, freed their raging boners, and hauled him back up for a feat of double penetration that drove the prince to an almost continuous fountaining of cum. Eventually after swapping out with some others, the guards had been thoroughly exhausted and left the very fucked Prince Charming in his firmly locked cell...<br />
<br />
To which Mister Akemi walked up and unlocked it with a key he&#39;d filched from somewhere on the way in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, you alright?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Better than ever.&quot; Prince Charming said with a thumbs up. &quot;You wanna have one more go with me before we go for the queen?&quot;<br />
<br />
The rep shrugged and dematerialized his overalls, revealing a quickly hardening cock that Prince Charming knelt down to start sucking like the insatiable slut he was rapidly turning out to be. Some inclement bukakke later, Akemi pulled a temporary raincloud from his toolbox and showered the now-naked prince off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y&#39;know, maybe we can just skip the clothes for now.&quot; Prince Charming said. &quot;Not like they were that protective.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll work &#39;actual armor&#39; into an upgrade later.&quot; Akemi said. &quot;You&#39;re currently more a dodge-tank than a defense-tank, especially if you count <i>charming</i> as a dodge.&quot;<br />
<br />
Prince Charming rolled his eyes at the probably-shoehorned pun and marched out through the dungeon past the exhausted guards sleeping things off. Flaunting some floaty roses around him as he walked into the throne room, he announced &quot;It&#39;s me, Prince Charming, here to put an end to your reign!&quot;<br />
<br />
The evil queen put down a newspaper she was reading and stood up dramatically. Large black block-text floated behind her.<br />
<b>MOB QUEEN</b><br />
<b>SIN OF FINANCIAL EXPLOITATION</b><br />
<br />
She pitched an apple at Prince Charming like a fastball, and dived into her mirror. While he dodged that, the mirror floated off the wall, creating several other mirrors that hovered in an ominous circle. The prince took one down explosively with an exploratory rose throw, prompting the queen to dive slash between the mirrors repeatedly and forcing him to block with a wall of briars. Spinning into the air, he began firing twin spirals of flowers from his hands to start shooting down reflections, only to rapidly clap and parry one of the queen&#39;s icy black swords. Dropping the stabby thing like a hot potato instead of a cold one, he floated aside and was bonked on the head with an apple, crashing to the ground as well. Rolling over, he shot more flowers into the sky where they exploded and revealed the rather stereotypical matriarch had drawn her storm into herself, creating a barrage of lightning arrows that she fired down at the prince. The prince once again dodged, then as his counterattacks appeared to do nothing dramatically ran down the entrance hallway when several dropped apples began exploding in response.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, a little help here?!&quot; he shouted to Mister Akemi, who had redressed and was sitting on a randomly occurring ottoman nearby. The rep grabbed his hand and leapt up, pulling the two into a twirl that concluded with linked hands pointing fingers at the rapidly approaching oncoming storm/queen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Spiraling Dark Flower: Storm Break!&quot; Mister Akemi shouted, followed by a more gratuitous &quot;Yeah, what he said!&quot; from Prince Charming.<br />
A massive black rose unfurled in front of the two, who kissed each other. The rose released a beam of white light as a finishing move that blasted the queen through her unbreakable storm, causing her to fail shortly followed by the spell.<br />
<br />
As the storm lifted and the flower flickered away, a mature man floated down from the shadows, the purified king left behind in a peaceful sleep that vaguely resembled Sam&#39;s father. He rolled over a bit, said something to the effect of &quot;five more minutes, please&quot; and that was that. A few celebratory shouts could be heard throughout the castle as various servants were liberated from an inability to rebel.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, mission accomplished.&quot; Mister Akemi said with a grin, unclasping his hands and leaning back in order to cross his arms. &quot;You can untransform and head back now, I&#39;ll take things from here and get you that powerup. No guarantees it&#39;ll be any good though, a lot of the good it does is gonna be in the non-metaphorical world.&quot;<br />
<br />
Speaking of that world, Daydream Sam was shelving some book he&#39;d finished with when he suddenly heard a cry of joy from his father.<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s come through for me!&quot; Mike shouted. &quot;He&#39;s got a job and we don&#39;t need to pay him alimony anymore!&quot;<br />
<br />
Apparently, Sam&#39;s mom was now a second dad, and a fairytale happy ending had come to some unwelcome convoluted sin.</p>
<hr/><h3>
What does Sam go for next?</h3>
