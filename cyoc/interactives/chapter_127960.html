<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
&quot;Megan just stand still for a second,&quot; Kelly commanded her former little sister.<br />
<br />
Megan was still busy looking at her sister&#39;s things and marveling in her perspective change. The girl was wearing blue jeans with rhinestones shaped to form a butterfly on the back pockets. Her light pink blouse had a picture of a kid sticking out her tongue, with the words &#39;Little Brat&#39; under it. As they had when she shrank, Megan&#39;s clothes had grown to fit her 8 foot tall form. <br />
<br />
Kelly turned the switch to reduce and aimed at her sister. Megan was now going through her sister&#39;s underwear, giggling like this was the funniest thing she could think to do. As Kelly took aim, Megan decided to get up and knock over her now little older sister. With a smile on her face a mile wide she charged her sister. Kelly&#39;s finger slid up, flipping the switch and hitting her sister with a full blast. Kelly could feel the weight of her expanding sister.<br />
<br />
Megan stood up again, hitting the 13 foot ceiling of Kelly&#39;s large room. <br />
<br />
&quot;I think you made a big boo boo, Kelly,&quot; Megan said looking down at her sister.<br />
<br />
She was still growing and now the foundation was shaking. Megan crouched down, still staring at her now dwarf sister. <br />
<br />
&quot;Megan!&quot; Kelly screamed as her sister filled her personal space.<br />
<br />
Before Kelly had a chance to react Megan stood up, her head pushing the ceiling out of its way with little resistance. White dust and plaster hit Kelly&#39;s floor. <br />
<br />
Megan was now 20 feet tall and still growing!<br />
<br />
Kelly had been knocked down from the force of her sister. All Kelly could see of Megan was her now huge white and baby blue sneakers and her legs. If she wanted to look up to Megan&#39;s face she would have to walk under her. And Kelly knew that was a BAD idea!<br />
<br />
Kelly looked down at the device in her hand. It was taking longer than before to charge. <br />
<br />
Now Megan was 42 feet tall. She started laughing out loud.<br />
<br />
&quot;I must be dreaming,&quot; Megan exclaimed.<br />
<br />
Megan lifted her left leg high, stepping out of the hole she made in her sister&#39;s ceiling and the roof it was attached to. She took no time in finding something fun to do (in her own opinion) now that she was monstrously large. She picked up the family car with no real effort and examined it. Megan sat down Indian style. She knew this was still her Mom&#39;s car. So, when she was bored, she carefully set it back down, got up and decided what she wanted to do.<br />
<br />
Her best friend Jessica was her first thought. Jessica was always talking about how much she wished things were like they were in movies and cartoons. This was too weird not to show her. <br />
<br />
So Megan got up and took off in the direction of her friend Jessica&#39;s home.<br />
<br />
Kelly was under a large piece of ceiling. It was not heavy but the sudden jolt of her giant sister leaving had sent a piece down on her head. Kelly was chalky white from the dust. She got up and examined herself. No cuts, but she noticed what might become a bruise. <br />
<br />
Kelly was furious; her brat sister had literally destroyed her room! It was not her room anymore, it looked nothing like it. Everything she called her own was now caked in white powder and tiny chunks of plaster. It would take days to clean!<br />
<br />
Kelly was kicking herself for letting this happen. But she still had the device and still could fix this. <br />
<br />
Kelly had two choices. She could use the thing on herself and chase after Megan as a giantess. But her friends might see her and she would be labeled a freak forever. Or she could take after Megan in her mom&#39;s car. She knew Megan would go see Jessica. The two of them were best friends. Kelly cared enough about Megan to know where she was most of the time, but what she had done had made Kelly very angry. Her thoughts raced about what to do. She really did want to use the device and take her sister down. But she was also worried that if she tried to do that other people might get hurt. <br />
<br />
As Kelly tried to decide, Megan took no time getting down the 5 blocks to her friend&#39;s 3 story house. Megan excitedly ran into Jessica&#39;s yard and realized she was taller than her best friend&#39;s house. The realization made her go &quot;Whoa...&quot; <br />
<br />
A moment later the hyperactive child decided to knock on Jess&#39;s window. She knocked 3 times, shattering Jessica&#39;s window in the process. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oopsies!&quot; Megan exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Megan?&quot; <br />
<br />
Jessica was awestruck. Megan used to be shorter than Jessica. Jessica was a 10 year-old red head with freckles. She didn&#39;t think of herself as pretty and got made fun of at recess. But Megan would always stick up for her. Jessica knew Megan was more popular and cuter then her, but that didn&#39;t bother either of them. <br />
<br />
Seeing her friend now insanely bigger then her blew Jessica&#39;s mind. She asked the only thing she could. <br />
<br />
&quot;Megan, what happened?&quot; <br />
<br />
Megan explained everything in her own words. <br />
<br />
&quot;Helly-Kelly got this weird remote that makes stuff big or small and I accidentally got shrinked.  And then Kelly made me bigger again. But guess what? I got like way bigger than I was before ...&quot; Megan stopped to giggle. &quot;.... and then she tried to shrink me again. But instead it made me even bigger. And I totally killed Kelly&#39;s room. I went all &#39;Attack of the 50 ft Woman&#39; on her room&#39;s butt.&quot; <br />
<br />
Megan and Jessica were big movie fans and had seen that movie together at a sleepover when they were 6 and 8 respectively. Jessica laughed at the reference. <br />
<br />
&quot;So what are you going to do?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know. I wanted to come get you and go hang out. I was thinking you would have some cool ideas.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, if I was as big as you I would go to like Wal-Mart and take all the toys and bikes and food and stuff I wanted,&quot; Jessica fantasized. <br />
<br />
&quot;Or we could go find those bullies that keep calling you rich bitch and get even with them for all they did to you,&quot; Megan suggested.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, while we decide, you should go in back and we can watch TV on the back patio,&quot; Jessica said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good idea.&quot; <br />
<br />
And Megan went into the back yard. <br />
<br />
Kelly knew she would be a outcast if anyone saw her big, but Megan could overpower her easily if she missed and was little. She knew her little sister was generally an okay girl, but she also liked attention and mischief. That could be dangerous given her current size.</p>
