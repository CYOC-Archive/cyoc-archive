<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">(parts from the the other author's threads in a pathetic attempt to bring the best parts <br />
together). <br />
<br />
&quot;With the splicing of fate, events are occurring at different pacing, meaning that eventually <br />
the world will fall behind itself.&quot; Ami observed looking at the sun with no damage to her <br />
eyes anymore than one would be harmed at looking at one's own reflection. <br />
<br />
&quot;We had better work fast then...&quot; Amy nodded. &quot;Or rather... they need to. You know these <br />
are abilities far beyond any Shinto Miko.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You're right, they are.&quot; <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
Jensen began roaming around the manor. He had new memories but he needed to see for <br />
himself. Kaylee had gone to check on the pups. They needed to be separate right now. <br />
They both had a sense of loss and being together just brought that to the fore.  <br />
<br />
He and Kaylee had united, one and the same, in a consummation so pure and absolute <br />
Jensen wouldn't have minded in the least if it had lasted till the end of time.  Now the <br />
mantle of responsibility so alien to him as Jennifer now weighted heavy on Jensen again. <br />
Making him -know- he could never willing abandon his pack even for the sake of the pure <br />
absolute bliss of being simply one with Kaylee. It had taken all their will power to leave <br />
separately instead of having Kaylee Transform or Dare them back into a mating statue on <br />
the spot! <br />
<br />
Not that they were sure Kaylee had her turn or not, they had grown to distrust the game <br />
so utterly that they had forsaken keeping track. And Jensen now wouldn't be sad to see it <br />
gone when the cure was put into Glendale's water supply and blessed. He had the pack <br />
now, and they had him, he had his mates, and the four of them had him, he had his pups, <br />
and they had their father, nothing else should matter. <br />
<br />
Jensen looked at the picture, confused by them, yet the same time they felt right, like there <br />
were memories unlocking as he beheld them. In nearly all the pictures the wolves and <br />
some lions were in the fur, apparently being completely different species from humans <br />
meant that technically there could be no sexual attraction between species thus <br />
eliminating the major reason for the taboo in the first place, and clothing and fur in this <br />
weather would be horrendous hot, and their pads were build for broken glass and pet <br />
leavings. <br />
<br />
There was a photo of Kaylee in a graduation gown... looking ready to die of heat stroke. <br />
There were even some photos of the pups playing with one or two humans who were as <br />
naked as they were .... and fainting mothers in the background. 'Society is full of <br />
contradictions, what are a few more...' Jensen thought. And still Jensen felt odd, as <br />
memories he didn't remember remembering emerged in his mind, of hosting a visit by the <br />
Pride to the Pack Manor... He knew that had never happened. <br />
<br />
There was a high school mass group picture of teenage versions of the wolves Kaylee, <br />
Jensen, Zack, Pearl, June, Hope, Grace, and Isabelle.  Jensen didn't think about how the <br />
transformation before had made them all into adults.<br />
<br />
Thinking about all this, Jensen wondered, and he wanted to know badly, &quot;Do the rest of <br />
my pack still have families on the outside who simply don't remember them? Or are they <br />
all now wolves too, or are we all known vaguely related to each other?&quot; Jensen felt a <br />
headache, but he desperately needed to know.  There was one other question he wanted to <br />
know, &quot;Do my eldest son and daughter still have the IQ of child prodigy for the business <br />
world?&quot; <br />
<br />
Fran in the brand new medical meanwhile, using the medical skill he had inheriented from <br />
her empathic and nearly mystical connection to her triplet Julie looked at the long line of <br />
injured, maimed, and in some rare cases multilated but still alive lions and wolves... 'I'm <br />
going to be at this for a while... looks like curing Chiyoye, Eri, Umeko, and Akane of their <br />
literally beach ball double-sized problems are going to have wait a bit...' <br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
Kaylee found the pups in the library reading. Martha was standing guard over them <br />
keeping an eye on any reflective surface. What surprised her was the fact that there six <br />
human children, sadly they were still in the nude due to the lack of human clothing <br />
available at the manor but Kaylee would learn they had gotten used to it after ten minutes <br />
of screaming, turning beat red, and being shown everyone else at the manner was naked <br />
anyway. Jenny looked up from her book and ran to her yelling, MOMMY,&quot; at the top of her <br />
lungs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello my precious,&quot; Kaylee said as she hugged Jenny then her other pups. As she did she <br />
shivered remembering that Kurse had twisted her mind so much that the only thing in her <br />
mind was being with Jensen and a statue. And she had loved it! The sheer union of it! The <br />
sheer perfect combination of self she and Jensen had forged. If she could, she would go <br />
back to that perfect, simple existence. But she couldn't just abandon her pups, not now, <br />
not ever! Her pups didn't know they were the only reason she hadn't chosen to reunite in <br />
Marble with Jensen on the spot. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you ok Mommy?&quot; Marcy asked evidently feeling Kaylee shiver.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I am now that I'm here with you,&quot; Kaylee said smiling and giving her pups a lick on <br />
their faces. She never wanted to leave them again. They were just as big a part of her life <br />
as Jensen was. &quot;Who are your friends?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They were the ones that came through the mirror with Samantha,&quot; Her eldest child and <br />
only one to bear her father's black fur Jenny said. Then gesturing to each in turn she said, <br />
&quot;This is Jose, Dennis, Pedro, Mark, Amanda, and Candice.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaylee noticed that all the human children were cringing back from her and Martha. She <br />
could guess why and said, &quot;We're not going to hurt you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But we wanted to take your pups and kill Amy,&quot; Candice said her voice quavering.<br />
<br />
&quot;You weren't yourselves,&quot; Kaylee said with a smile. &quot;You weren't responsible for what you <br />
did. So don't blame yourselves as we don't.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I want my mommy and daddy,&quot; Amanda said and the others nodded their agreement.<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll see them just as soon as we can arrange it,&quot; Kaylee promised.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why can't we go through the mirror?&quot; Jose asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because you would be changed if you did,&quot; Kaylee said, &quot;and we don't want that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We didn't change when we came through the mirror the first time,&quot; Mark pointed out. <br />
&quot;Why would this time be different?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because it's part of the glass pup's power to change anyone they take through the mirror,&quot; <br />
Kaylee said. &quot;Anyone that they take who isn't part of the pack or whose form isn't locked <br />
would become a little glass wolf pup girl. Now I don't think the boys will want that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jose and Pedro both shuddered and said, &quot;No.&quot; Mark however looked like he wouldn't mind <br />
becoming a girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then you can't go through the mirrors,&quot; Kaylee said. &quot;But I promise that you will be <br />
reunited with your parents. No child should be deprived of their parents. Now what are you <br />
reading?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wizard of Oz.&quot; Jenny explained. &quot;You won't believe what they left out of the movie.&quot;</p>
