<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Peter half expected to be called over to Joce's house as soon as he put down his gym bag.  But a voice in his head told otherwise.<br />
*I'd be mean of me to keep you all to myself.  We'll have fun in a bit, but your not my slave.  Relax for a while, then we'll have some fun experimenting!*<br />
<br />
Peter grinned at the idea.  It wasn't so bad, having a girlfriend to look  after you.<br />
<br />
A few hours later, after finishing any homework he had due for that weekend and a quiet dinner, Joce's voice drifted back.<br />
*Want to come over now?  My parents are gone for the weekend, so we can do as we please.*<br />
<br />
*Sure! But give me a few minutes to get ready, and then you can teleport me over.*<br />
<br />
Peter put on his loosest clothing, and packed a small bag of extra clothes.  He raced downstairs, calling out &quot;I'm going out!  I'll be sleeping over at friend's! I got my cell phone if you need me!&quot;<br />
<br />
After hearing approval from another room, he walked outside, over to a set of tall bushes.  As soon as he was out of sight, he felt the sensation of magical transportation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot;<br />
He opened his eyes as Joce grabbed him in a fierce hug.  &quot;Hey yourself.  So...Wow!  Nice house!&quot;<br />
<br />
It was.  One of those new modern houses, with tall cieling and generally too much space to deal with, it was still nicely decorated and felt inviting.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks.&quot; Joce blushed.  She had to admit she liked this attention from such a cute boy, but it was something to get used to.  &quot;Anyways, I was thinking, since we were a little preoccupied earlier...&quot; Both of them blushed at the memory of their wantoness in the locker room, &quot;We never got to test out how far we could transform you.  You up for a little expermintation?&quot;<br />
<br />
Peter couldn't hide his excitement.  &quot;Sure!&quot;<br />
<br />
Joce led him to the far side of the house, where he was surprised to find a room that looked very much like a dance studio.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is; my mom usually teaches classes here during the week.  But she and dad are off on a cruise this weekend, so its ours for the time being.  And I figured you were just as interested in the results as I was.&quot;<br />
Peter nodded absentmindly.  This room was a lot bigger than the locker room!<br />
<br />
Joce handed him a pair of shorts.  &quot;These were the largest I could find.  You don't need to ruin more of your clothes for me!&quot;<br />
<br />
Peter didn't mention that the idea of bursting out of his clothes had excited him.  Instead he goggled at the size of the shorts- he could fit his entire body into one leg!  Joce directed him to the bathroom to change, and soon returned, embarassingly hold the huge amount of material up, but excited at the prospect at filling these monsters.<br />
<br />
Joce closed her eyes and concentrated.  Peter felt the tingle of change start in his feet, pushing them out in preparation.  For a moment, he looked like a clown with feet twice their original size before the tingle rose upwards to his calves.  He gaped as in a couple of seconds his calves ballooned to the size of first soccerballs, then  basketballs, with the muscles below swelling as well to comfortablely support them.  The magic rose upwards, and expected to watch his quads expand.<br />
<br />
Instead, he felt his hip bones widen and thicken to twice its original size.  He no longer had to hold the shorts up so desperately, they were filled a bit better.  But they still need him to hold them up.<br />
<br />
Then he felt his quads engorge.  It was nothing like he'd ever seen before- his thighs seemed inflate, growing to one, two, almost three feet in diameter, nearly engulfing his knees. Up the tingle travelled to his buttocks, and each grew first to the size of basketballs, then even larger.  He didn't need to hold up the shorts anymore, but they were still slightly loose.<br />
<br />
That began to change.  A blush appear on Joce's face, her eye now open to watch as the muscle she so craved appeared.  Peter understood her red cheeks as he felt his member fill out like first two beer cans stacked end to end to a entire soda bottle and then some.  His scrotum stretched to encase the now grapefruit sized balls, ready to fill up his gun when needed.<br />
<br />
But the transformation was far from over.  Each ab began to rise like bread, then like cobblestones, stretching the waistband of the now nearly tight shorts.  <br />
<br />
But the most inpresive transformation were his pectorals.  Each one bulged out like they were inflating like balloons.  But instead of rounding out into parodies of breasts, they kept their strong angular cuts, forcing his shoulders out.  it seemed to Peter that as if someone had welded a refridgerator sideways to his chest.  His delts and lats expanded to keep up, creating the distinct v-shape of a muscle god.  Even he tried, he doubted his arms would completely encircle the pratically four feet of muscle in front of him.<br />
<br />
Speaking of his arms, it was their turn.  His shoulder ballooned match the standards set by his chest.  first bowling balls, then basketballs.  then his biceps and triceps followed suit, pushing his arm to practically a 60 degree angle from his body.  His forearms joined in, completing change.<br />
<br />
Peter twisted as best he could to see all of himself in the mirrors.      First running his hands over the biggest chest in the world, he then flexed, admiring what must surely have been 80 inch guns on either arm.  He felt so strong, so heavy and big, like a instinctual dream come true.  Any superhero from the comic books would have been helpless against him, he felt that powerful.  He must have at least 700 pounds on his 6'1&quot; frame.  Any more and he'd truly been immobile. <br />
<br />
Joce, reading his thoughts, commanded him to lie on the his back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha-What?&quot; Peter wondered what she was doing, snapping out of his muscled daze.<br />
<br />
Acting like a rock climber, Joce scaled his chest and situated herself on his massive pectorals.  He groaned as he felt the transformation hit him again.  Turning his attention to the mirrow, he could see his  chest expand even more, his biceps creak as they ballooned to twice their current size!  In a few moments it was over, and Peter realized he was truly immobile now, his biceps so large they forced his arms straight where they touched.  His abs were boulders now, and each of his legs could make their own muscle god alone.  He had to weigh at least a ton!<br />
<br />
&quot;Be careful what you wish for!&quot; Joce giggled, hugginh one of the pectorals.<br />
<br />
&quot;I dunno, just knowing I'm this big could be enough for me!&quot;  Peter laughed, kidding.<br />
<br />
Joce slapped the side of the pectoral she was perched on.  &quot;Spoken like a true muscle god.  Let make you a bit more manageable, though.&quot;<br />
<br />
Peter watched as he shrunk back to the first set of proportions.  However, when he thought Joce was done or going to shrink him some more, he felt the tingle of growth all over.  When he stood up, he realized he was at least a good foot taller.  The new muscle now fit much more comfortably over the larger frame.  Nobody could ever try and say he was small, however.  He grinned at Joce, before picking her  up with one hand to kiss her and coddle her in his big beefy arms that made her so happy.<br />
<br />
She grinned, and slipped out of his grasp, turning to the pile she had brought with her.  She threw something at him, which turned out to be a t-shirt.  What once would have been a tent on Peter now fit perfectly, barely encasing his muscles so that each was visible under the taught fabric.<br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; Joce said, grinning, &quot;what do you want to do now?&quot;</p>
