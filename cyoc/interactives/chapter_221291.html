<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Well, there is a transformation I&#39;d like to try on you…&quot; Jeff mumbled. <br />
<br />
Venus perked up and lifted them both to their feet, bringing the Chronivac close. &quot;Can I have some more strength? Or do you want to evolve me more?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, it was something else. A little bit different to what we&#39;ve done before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Different how?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I… I have a certain fetish I&#39;d like to explore with you.&quot; Venus raised her eye-ridges, and Jeff flushed under her gaze. He quickly rushed to assure her, &quot;It&#39;s nothing too bad! And it&#39;s not that I don&#39;t think you&#39;re great the way you are - because of course you are, you&#39;re strong and powerful and beautiful, and I&#39;m rambling here - but it&#39;s just something else I&#39;d like to try.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, love, I don’t care what it is, just tell me-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I want you to have muscles.&quot; Jeff blurted out. &quot;Look, I love how powerful you are, but your body is so lithe and trim, I can’t even fathom how strong you truly are. I just want to make your power more apparent to the outside world.&quot;<br />
<br />
Venus purred. &quot;Oh, I do like the sound of that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But there’s more. Um, I’d also like you to get more… monstrous? I want you to be a beast. Something people have nightmares about. You’d act ferocious and primal and dominant-&quot; his dick was starting to stir again, just from talking about it, &quot;-but I don&#39;t want you to completely lose your mind. You&#39;ll still be intelligent, and deep down you&#39;ll still be the same old Venus. You&#39;d just act a little more feral.&quot; Finally finished, Jeff looked to Venus expectantly. The plant-being was simply frozen solid, her mouth hanging open.<br />
<br />
&quot;Venus? Honey? What do you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
She snapped back to her body. &quot;Jeff, I&#39;m going to be honest with you, that sounds like the hottest fucking thing I&#39;ve ever heard. Do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff grinned and turned to the Chronivac, quickly switching the settings to suit. Firstly, muscle growth and definition had to be pushed to the max, and set to increase every second. That meant she&#39;d be backed into an exponential explosion of growth, each one larger than the last. He also upped her strength, making her immense power even greater. Then, he stood back and let the first wave of changes commence.<br />
<br />
Venus keeled over, falling to her knees as the changes began. Her fingers dug deep into the soil, desperately clutching at anything to stabilize herself. It felt as if her body had turned to jelly, yet she felt strength and power pouring into her. Her body throbbed, pulsating like a heartbeat. Each pulse saw her muscles expanding, each second growing larger and larger. Her womanly body, lithe with thin, athletic muscles was a heavyweight champion&#39;s in moments. Tendrils sprouted from her back, flailing wildly as they too grew, from thin, whip-like appendages to vines as thick as Jeff&#39;s leg. They plunged into anything they could find, stabbing straight through trees, smashing through rock, burrowing miles deep underground, until suddenly they all flexed as one, drawing Venus&#39;s body aloft. She floated there, above the ground, and threw her arms wide and her head back as she relished the transformation.<br />
<br />
Jeff watched her ascend from his place on the ground. It was simply surreal and so erotic to watch Venus&#39; body become a pillar of musculature, her stance widening just to make room for the thick slabs of meat - or in this case, plant - that piled higher and higher on her frame. He was sure she&#39;d grown taller as well, but even a few feet couldn&#39;t hide how absolutely mammoth her body had become. Her arms looked like the tires he&#39;s seen on mining trucks, her calves were the size of refrigerators, and even her tendrils were beginning to dwarf tree trunks. <br />
<br />
&quot;More,&quot; Venus growled, too lost in the pleasure. &quot;Give me more!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff obliged, upping the definition and strength even further. Each striated muscle looked carved from marble, he could see every vine-like fibre as they pumped in time with her growth. Even the smallest fibre was as thick as Jeff&#39;s neck. Venus gritted her teeth as her tendrils thickened. Her body felt utterly weightless, but she knew just a step and she&#39;d crush a car flat beneath her hyper-dense muscle. She let out a yell, until suddenly, all feelings of transformation suddenly left her.<br />
<br />
Her eyes snapped open. Jeff flinched as two huge vines stabbed into the ground on either side of him, missing his head by mere millimetres. Venus lowered herself down towards him, baring her teeth in a snarl. &quot;I thought I said to give me more.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, well, you did,&quot; Jeff stammered nervously. &quot;But, I thought we could start the next phase of transformation.&quot;<br />
<br />
Venus sighed and backed herself up a little. &quot;Fine,&quot; she said. &quot;I did agree to it. Do what you must, but know I want everything you&#39;ve got.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff nodded and got to work. First, the mental transformation. He upped a few sliders to the max - aggression, dominance, willpower - but lowered some others. Just to be safe, he increased her loyalty and love for him tenfold. Who knows what she&#39;d do to him otherwise? He increased her animalistic tendencies, but also her intelligence, set to grow more powerful every second. He pressed go.<br />
<br />
There was a subtle shift in Venus&#39; eyes. Her pupils dilated, swallowing them whole into a dark, glittering black gaze. Her sharp teeth jutted out of her jaw as her expression changed to something more dark. She seemed to loom over Jeff, no longer a gentle giant but a huge, dangerous predator. <br />
<br />
As her mind changed, Jeff added some physical changes as well. A dark colour swept across her skin, turning every inch of her into a shadowy purple-black. Ebony spines shot out of every vine she had, and her hair, once a collection of thick, green foliage, became a mane of thorns. Two crooked branch-like horns poked through.<br />
<br />
Her legs became digitigrade, her newly minted feet turning into wicked talons. Once again she howled in delight as strength and power poured into her, muscles surging as she grew even bigger. Her posture leaned and became hunched, and her jaw split into four, opening to show rows and rows of fangs, along with five thick, spike, tongue-like vines. Venus hissed; an animalistic sound that shook the trees around them. Her eyes split into something akin to a spider&#39;s, ten black dots that gleamed in the light. Her neck grew long and winding, and her arms split into three each, giving her six, huge arms down the sides of her impossibly wide, muscular body. Behind her, the sun was blotted out by four large wings unfolding, each like a gigantic leaf. They beat the air with powerful strokes. <br />
<br />
Jeff stepped back a little as he watched this unfold, hand still on the button. Venus caught the movement easily in her eyes, and her new heat sensor, and cocked her head to look at him. It was unsettling, being put under her gaze. Jeff found himself almost anticipating getting snapped up by her jaws. Quick as a flash, Venus was awfully close to him, licking her lips with those thorny tongues. She continued to grow as veins stood up across her body, thick as Jeff&#39;s thighs. Her pussy growled, Jeff&#39;s eyes wandering down to it, and realizing in horror it too had changed, full of teeth and tongues, just as her mouth was. Sets of eyes opened down her chest too, along with more breasts to match her arms. Each areola was like a dark petal, spraying sickly sweet poisons to entice someone in only to suck the life out of them.<br />
<br />
He stopped the transformation. Venus cocked her head, but didn&#39;t say anything. Instead, she moved around him, never letting her feet touch the ground, relying only on the hundreds of tentacles on her back for movement. Her neck slithered around Jeff&#39;s body, studying him from all angles the way a predator regards her prey. A tongue snaked out, licking across his cheek, leaving a line of blood where the knife-like thorns grazed the skin. Jeff trembled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you afraid of me, little one?&quot; Venus hissed. A tendril came to tip his chin upwards, meeting her dark eyes. Her wings fluttered. &quot;Good. You should be. Though I would not hurt you, of course, you are mine. My little human pet, my &#39;boyfriend&#39;, in your terms. But I can hurt you, and I can bring the whole of your little town to their knees if I want to.&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly, arms were wrapping around him, bringing him close to the twenty-foot behemoth&#39;s chest. &quot;I love you, Jeff,&quot; Venus said, her lips wrapped around his ear, tongues snaking inside. &quot;But you have made me so, so powerful. You have no idea what I have become.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then tell me,&quot; Jeff whispered back, and suddenly he was on the ground, a grotesque monster leering over him. Her tendrils dug deep into the ground, keeping her only just suspended. Suddenly, the earth began to move, as if it were alive. Trees twisted and bent, and suddenly hundred and thousands of vines were bursting through the ground, stretching from him to miles away.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am smarter than any living being. I know everything about you, Jeff, I can read you like an open book. I know what settings you used in the Chronivac, and I know exactly how to use all that you&#39;ve given me to its full potential.&quot; The trees tied themselves in knots. &quot;Look at these. I used to be that. Pathetic. Now I can control them as if they were my own body. I can stretch my vines underground halfway around the world. I see and hear everything, your thoughts, your heartbeat, your every move!&quot;<br />
<br />
The grass around his feet suddenly clamped tight, and vines shot upwards, holding him in place. &quot;I&#39;m strong enough to end the world in a single blow. I know you think you made a monster, but let me tell you, fragile, puny thing, I am no monster. I am a god&quot;<br />
<br />
She came close. &quot;And I am yours.&quot;</p>
