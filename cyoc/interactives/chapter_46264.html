<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;This can't be happening. This can't be happening. This can't be happening. This can't be happening.&quot;<br />
<br />
Over and over Richard told himself this as he looked down at the Mons Pubis and the area where his penis and testicles used to be. The urine leaving his body had finally ceased and Richard had a feeling that he was supposed to do something, but didn't fully know what that was he was supposed to do.<br />
<br />
After a minute of chanting over and over that this couldn't be happening, Richard finally took a deep breathe and reached for the toilet paper.<br />
<br />
As if on autopilot and watching himself from a great distance, Richard took some of the paper and proceeded to wipe himself dry. Afterward, he stood and flushing the toilet, he went to wash his hands...kicking away his shoes, socks, pants and underwear as he moved toward the sink.<br />
<br />
Afterward, he stood and looked down. &quot;It's kind of strange, but at the same time kind of funny,&quot; Richard thought as he stared past his shirt and at the smooth skin.<br />
<br />
Hesitantly he reached down and touched the smooth skin, wondering why he had no pubic hair and then reminding himself that it probably vanished to make room for the white fur he might be growing as the wish progressed ever onward.<br />
<br />
Wanting to make sure all of it was real and not some sort of dream, Richard let his hand drop even further. Between his legs he touched the small, button like nub that was his clitoris and was amazed when it became hard like his penis would. Turned on, Richard pulled his hand back, not wanting to go any further then what he already had.<br />
<br />
Turning around, he squatted down...making him looking like a girl more then ever...and picked up his underwear and pants. Draping his pants over the sink, Richard began to pull on his underwear. Shifting about, he eventually took the underwear off and threw them into the laundry basket when it became apparent that the female privates just weren't comfortable against the harsh cotton of a male's underwear.<br />
<br />
Sighing, he reached over and pulled on his pants, which he discovered where now kind of big...by at least two sizes...and also roomy in the crotch area.<br />
<br />
Stepping out of the bathroom, finding it odd and strangely arousing to have nothing but a pair of jeans brushing against his new privates, Richard returned to the table. Picking up the note, he started at for a while, reading and rereading what he had written. After a bit, he returned to the bathroom and collected the rest of his shed clothes.<br />
<br />
Pulling on the shoes, he thought that they also might be a little bit bigger, but in the end couldn't decide. Tucking the note into his pocket, Richard exited his domicile and headed back to the Middle School, hoping to find some answers.<br />
------<br />
<br />
Hours later, Richard lay upon his bed, attempting to get comfortable. His trip back to the Middle School had been a complete bust and afterward he had headed to the library. There, he began to search the internet for some information about notes that allow people to make wishes or anything that might be related. But that to had also been a complete bust and dejected he had come home.<br />
<br />
Home, he prepared himself something to eat and after a microwave dinner, he sat and surfed through the channels, looking for something to watch. At half past ten, he decided to go to bed and tomorrow he would look for more information on the note.<br />
<br />
It was while he was undressing that he realised that he had no idea where the note was suddenly...and turning out the pockets on his pants Richard realised suddenly that the note had vanished at some point. &quot;Or I set it somewhere and can't remember where,&quot; Richard told himself as he yawned and slowly undressed.<br />
<br />
Naked, he stood in the bathroom, facing the mirror. Something looked off...beside the fact that when he looked down he saw only flat, smooth skin...but Richard couldn't put his finger on what it was.<br />
<br />
Idly he pushed a strand of hair back and looked at his reflection. After a couple minutes of this, Richard told himself, &quot;Keep this up and you'll wind up just as vain as a woman,&quot; and exited the bathroom, making his way toward his room.<br />
<br />
Inside, he tried on several different pairs of pyjamas before finally settling on an oversized shirt and nothing more. Puzzled by the fact that none of his clothes weren't comfortable any more, Richard climbed between the sheets, experienced an odd sensation as his naked flesh came in contact with the cool, soft cotton sheets and the pushed the feeling aside.<br />
<br />
Lying in the darkened room, Richard tossed back and forth, trying to find a good place to rest. As he did, thousands of bits of information raced through his head. On top of all this, question after question popped up and then vanished before he formulate an answer. Finally, settling on his side, feet partially curled up close to his privates and butt...again not realising that he looked like a female laying like this...Richard drifted into a fitful sleep.<br />
------<br />
<br />
Somewhere an alarm clock buzzed and Richard mumbled sleepily. A woman's voice called out, &quot;Richard! It's time to get up. I don't want to find out you went back to sleep and missed the bus again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mumbling some more, Richard rolled over and slapped the snooze button. Lying on his back, he at first thought had all been a dream and then his room came into focus and Richard knew for a fact that it hadn't been a dream at all.<br />
<br />
Taking in the bright coloured wallpaper, the desk and the full body mirror next to it, Richard wondered briefly why he wasn’t in the basement and then remembered that this was his room when he still lived upstairs. “Only it wasn’t so bright,” he thought to himself as he took in the white walls and what appeared to be…very faintly…pink trim along the edge up by the ceiling.<br />
<br />
Pushing back the covers, he noted that the shirt that he’d worn to bed last night was bigger and stumbling toward the mirror, he peered into the reflective object and tried to come to terms with anything that had changed.<br />
<br />
But it wasn’t the mirror that caught his attention. It was actually a pink and purple backpack next to the desk. Squatting down, he pulled out a book, noted the name listed for ownership was Melissa and that the book was on loan from the Tom Landry Middle School. Thinking, “I’ve some how regressed back being a middle schooler,” Richard dropped the book into the backpack and looked back at mirror.<br />
<br />
As he did so, he lifted the shirt a bit and took in his now flattened stomach and looking at the area where he legs came together and the hint of what was between his legs, Richard, attempted to come to terms with what was happening and what his options where and what he could do.</p>
