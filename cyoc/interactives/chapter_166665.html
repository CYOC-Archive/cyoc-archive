<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mark finally with her envelope in hand was inundated with requests for help from his young charges. Two of the girls wanted to change their activity preferences. One girl Jessica was her name (Thank god all the girls had name badges) thrust her timetable under Mark&#39;s nose and said &#39;This isn&#39;t what I booked. They have made a mistake. I should be doing the music and dance options. How do I change it?&#39; <br />
<br />
Mark hadn&#39;t been listening to what girls had to do, but she did remember the boss man talking about it. &#39;Get a pen and write what you want to do and give it to the man in charge. There he is behind that queue of girls&#39; indeed the man who seemed to be in charge had about 10 girls waiting to see him. Jessica left to join the queue.<br />
<br />
However Mark did not get a chance to open the &quot;Anna King&quot; envelope. As soon as Jessica had gone, Sharni a small blonde girl was asking her: &#39;Can I change her preferences?. Dad put me down to do sailing but I can&#39;t swim and I&#39;m scared. Could I do horse riding instead?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;I guess so. Better join the queue over there&#39;<br />
<br />
Then there was Alison, a tall black girl &#39;I&#39;m supposed to be doing basketball but they have me doing specialist volleyball training instead. Can you fix this for me&#39;<br />
<br />
Again Mark told her to join the queue. Next was Holly, then Kate then Monique, all were sent across to the queue to talk to the man in charge. The man seemed to have other help there by now as well.<br />
<br />
By now Mark was busting to go to the toilet. Anna&#39;s bladder seemed so small. She told the remaining girls to &#39;Just join the queue over there. I can&#39;t change things for you&#39; Then dashed off as a howl of protests erupted. <br />
<br />
Fortunately Mark had noticed a toilet block just outside the hall. She trotted as fast as she could in the 2 inch heeled sandals she was still wearing. By now Mark had actually developed a level of competency with walking in heels. She was soon at the door but then was confronted with a queue of girls waiting for a cubicle. <br />
<br />
Mark had to use unfamiliar muscles to hang on as she slowly made her way to the front of the queue. While queued she actually had a chance to open the &quot;Anna King&quot; envelope. Of course she was confronted with Anna&#39;s preferences not those Mark had chosen. Anna had put down Sailing and Golf, those were fine with Mark but also on the list was musical theatre, dance, singing and of all things bracelet making. <br />
<br />
Getting to the front of the queue finally Mark got to a stall and of course had to sit down. Mark&#39;s days of standing up to pee were at least temporarily over. The flood gates opened as soon as she relaxed her muscles. At least this time she had not peed all over herself. She thought about the activities for &quot;Anna&quot;. Clearly she and &quot;Jennifer&quot; needed to swap bodies as soon as possible. The real Anna should be the one looking after these little brats and doing her girly activities. At least if Mark was in Jennifer&#39;s body she could do the sports activities Anna and Mark had put down yesterday.<br />
<br />
Relieved finally Mark washed her hands and made her way outside. Rather than swap &quot;Anna Kings&quot; activities. She would swap bodies with &quot;Jennifer&quot;. So she did not join the queue of girls changing their preferences. Instead she went off to look for the real Anna.<br />
<br />
Not knowing her way around the camp. Mark was soon lost. She ended up somewhere near the kitchens where a woman told her. &#39;Kid&#39;s are not allowed in here&#39; The woman at least showed Mark how to get back to the assembly hall.<br />
<br />
Back at the hall, groups were being organised for tours of the camp complex. With her very recent experience of getting lost Mark decided joining one of these tours would be a worthwhile investment of her time. With luck she would come across &quot;Jennifer&quot;. Mark spotted Alice the blonde girl who had vomited in the bus and several others of her young charges and joined that group.<br />
<br />
She was tapped on the shoulder and turned to see Heather &#39;No need for you to be here Anna. I can accompany our girls. You deserve a little time off&#39;<br />
<br />
But Mark really needed to learn the layout of the camp, thinking quickly she whispered to Heather &#39;I told Alice I would stay with her for a while just until she is comfortable. I can do this. You take the time off. I&#39;m sure you have paperwork to do&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Why thank you Anna, that&#39;s very considerate of you. I will try and do a bit of that paperwork&#39;<br />
<br />
Heather left. Mark went on the tour of the camp. Her tour was led by the woman who had been up on stage at the start. She was &quot;Mrs Strickner&quot; Evidently the man speaking had been Mr Strickner, her husband and they were the camp leaders. <br />
<br />
Mark was grateful he had joined the tour. There were more buildings than she had expected and the real Anna would have known her way about the camp. <br />
<br />
The tour came across &quot;Jennifer&quot; near the end. Jennifer was in the pool in a white bikini splashing around with some of her friends. She spotted Mark and gave a wave. Mark managed to get close enough to the pool to say &#39;We need to talk. I&#39;ll come back here as soon as the tour finishes&#39;<br />
<br />
That is what Mark did. The tour finished back at the hall where they had started. Mark sent Alice and the others from her group back to the dormitory than headed straight back to the pool. She spotted the real Anna now lying on a deckchair. She was with the Asian girl Mark had noticed earlier, also in a bikini. &#39;Hi Jennifer&#39; Mark remembered to call Anna by her apparent name &#39;Can I have a word with you in private&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Hi Anna&#39; said the Asian girl. <br />
<br />
Being in a bikini the girl had no name tag. Fortunately Anna was aware of Mark&#39;s dilemma. &#39;Anna, Abby here tells me you and she are old friends&#39; Anna turned to Abby &#39;Anna convinced me to give summer camp a try. We go to school together. I&#39;ve never been on camp before&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Hi Abby. Can we catch up later. I really need to talk to Jennifer in private&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Sure Anna, I gather I have a rival as you best friend&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;We can all be best friends&#39; said &quot;Jennifer&quot;. &#39;Maybe we could add Kate and we could be the four musketeers?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Ah, Yeah...&quot; said Mark. &#39;Do you know somewhere private Jennifer?&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jennifer&quot; got up and told Mark. &#39;Come to my room. If Kate&#39;s there we can ask her to leave&#39;</p>
