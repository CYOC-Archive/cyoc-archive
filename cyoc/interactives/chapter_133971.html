<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brenda didn’t even spend the night at the man’s house. He took her to his place and immoderately stripped her of her clothes, felt up her breasts, and banged her without a second thought. He had no regard for how Brenda felt and fucked her at least three or four times and made her blow him at least another two. Impressive for any man but completely dissatisfying  for Brenda. To him she was no more important than a cum rag and the only reason he’d used condoms at all was to prevent himself from having to pay any kind of child support. Then at six in the morning with her hair ruffled, her dress wrinkled, her body defiled, and her head throbbing, Brenda was thrown out of his house with no idea where she was or what she was doing. People were already up on the lazy Sunday and headed out and about. Most of the people up were elderly or shift workers and they stared at Brenda like she was some common slut as she walked home while rubbing her arms and hating her heels. Somehow she’d misplaced her purse and the feeling of helplessness only increased as time passed and the sun rose higher and higher into the sky. Early summer heat clung to the air and Brenda just felt more and more self conscious and sick as she walked. Her hangover was in full force and she began to forget things like her home address and where she lived in the city. Soon she had no idea where she was walking only that her brain hurt. The hangover was so bad she had to hold onto a lamppost and groaned in response to the alcohol. Eventually a new location popped into her head but it was all the way across town and she had no money, so like some sort of common slut she ended up in the back seat of a cab with some greasy guy giving him a blowjob in exchange for a ride. It was gross and disgusting but thanks to her misplaced wallet and dead phone it was her only option. The fat greaser left his scent all over her face and squeezed her breasts on the whole ride to her place and when she got out he squeezed her ass and wolf whistled at her. Brenda stumbled to an apartment building door and ran right into the glass door. It was stuck and she tugged on it again and again lacking any sort of key. By sheer chance her phone brushed up against the card reader and it beeped in acceptance. She stumbled backwards as the door locked again and pulled her dead phone out opening it to find a key card inside. She swiped it like it was a habit and opened the door walking in clumsily and making it to the elevator. She blinked at the numbers unable to recall which floor she lived on but number nine felt right so she pressed it anyway. New memories of living here began to flood in and on floor nine she stumbled down the hall to room nine hundred and five and used her keycard again. She opened the door and stumbled inside dropping her phone and card and kicking her heels off. She scurried to the bathroom and immediately threw up.<br />
<br />
Everything in her guts came out and she ended up lying on the floor groaning and shivering until she heard the door open again and footsteps come down the hall. A figure of the most beautiful girl Brenda had ever seen filled the doorway. A redhead with freckles all over her exposed chest, shoulders, and face. She had deep brown eyes and currently wore a green tank top and jeans, in her hands was clutched a takeout container and a keycard.<br />
<br />
“Oh geez,” the woman muttered before entering the bathroom with a cautious air. She knelt next to Brenda and brushed some hair out of her eyes and cringed, “How we doing today Brenda?”<br />
<br />
Brenda just groaned in response and the woman ended up picking her up and hauling her to a small bedroom. She was lain on the bed and stripped out of her cocktail dress by the girl. She lay on the bed groaning while the woman stripped her nude and slid her into a perfectly sized t-shirt and loose pajama pants with pictures of various smiley faces printed on it. She then lay her under the covers and walked out of the room.<br />
<br />
Brenda immidiately began to sweat and toss and turn. Her body was wracked with illness and she seemed to have no clear thoughts. Only emotions ran through her body and they were unpleasant ones. She quickly sweat right through her clothing soaking it so it clung to her body and feeling hot and uncomfortable. She began to recall where she was, it was an apartment she shared, but with who? It was that pretty girl, yeah that really pretty girl, she liked that girl, she knew that girl. It was her sister. Yes it was her sister Elizabeth. Five years older than her, Brenda had gone to the club with her because Brenda had turned twenty one. She was legally able to drink in her state now but her sister had lost track of her and she’d taken drinks offered to her, she wasn’t really experienced with clubs or that environment after all.<br />
<br />
Brenda tossed and turned as more details of her life became clear. It was summer right now so she was off from school, what was she studying to be again? She couldn’t remember. It was blurry in her mind but felt nice, comfortable, and familiar. She began to recall her family. Her mom and dad were both teachers. She could recall family dinners, a vacation to the west coast by car, and playing with her sister. She groaned as memories of watching girls around her get dates filled her mind and feeing lonely, memories of moving in with Elizabeth while she was at school, and memories of her various hobbies and activities.<br />
<br />
Brenda sweat so much that it began to soak into the mattress. Water built up around her soaking her hair and making her feel damp. Her body began to be surrounded by water, she wasn’t in her bed anymore. She was soaking in a hot bath. She knew how to handle a hangover, she’d gotten them in high school and at parties. She had a hot towel over her eyes while she soaked in the bathtub. Music played on a beat up radio and the throbbing in her head diminished as she reached to the side and took a swing of ice water. Some song from the nineteen fifties of something. She didn’t care at this point, she just needed noise.<br />
<br />
She didn’t even react when her sister opened the door with a loud and ear throbbing freak.<br />
<br />
“I see someone made it back,” Elizabeth commented.<br />
<br />
“Had to blow a guy to get here, not fun,” Brenda replied in a rather annoyed manner as she sister approached the bathtub.<br />
<br />
“So how bad did that guy fuck you last night?” She asked in a rather blunt manner.<br />
<br />
“He used protection,” Brenda replied rather softly while the song changed on the radio to a beach bum sound that was rather relaxing.<br />
<br />
“Look I’m sorry for not keeping an eye on you,” Elizabeth apologized. Brenda however just waved her hand in response.<br />
<br />
“You either learn the hard way or not at all. I learned the especially hard way,” Brenda muttered, “His dick was puny, you would not believe how microscopic that thing was.”<br />
<br />
Elizabeth just laughed in response and apologized another three times. If anything Brenda was more upset that her sister let her wander off with a microdicked wannabe cowboy than anything. Drunk Brenda didn’t exactly have good taste in men.<br />
<br />
Brenda soaked until her headache went away, then she got up and returned to her bedroom pulling on clothing to beat the ridiculous heat of the city. She tanned herself while she wandered around the apartment in her underwear. The AC unit was still broken and Brenda practically stuck to the couch when she lay on it trying to read her book. Eventually she got fed up with her clothing and rose to her feet, she stretched from side to side and out of the corner of her eye spotted a pair of eyes watching her from across the way. She could vaguely make out a young man, maybe a few years older than her staring at her body so she smirked and sensually took her clothing off. The man practically glued himself to the window to watch as she let her breasts free and her pussy breathe. Brenda smiled in response to the stare and began to play with herself while knowing full well he was watching her. She played with her tits and probed her vsgina until she orgasmed sweatily. Now even warmer she cleaned herself up from her little show and lay on the floor fanning herself to hopefully keep herself cool. This didn’t work however so she spent her afternoon nude on the living room carpet drifting in and out of consciousness knowing full well the guy across the way had likely jacked off to her hot body. She smiled at the thought of some hot guy getting off to the very image of herself and had a couple of horny dreams until her sister came home looking equally overheated. Elizabeth forced her to put clothes on though so Brenda just put a tight bra and thong on before pulling her her shortest short shorts and a crop top. The two of them lay on the couch together panting and sweaty, they guzzled down so much water they became over hydrated and panted.<br />
<br />
“We need to get out of here,” Elizabeth eventually commented while Brenda nodded. Lizzie turned to her sister and looked her right in the eye, “Where do you want to go?”</p>
