<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Cowritten by Real History <br />
<br />
<br />
Stepping through the portal, Fukushu inhaled free air for the first time in weeks. It was hard for the kitsune to describe, but the air of his homeland smelled fresher, cleaner than the cell within S.P.E.A.R.<br />
<br />
The paperwork for the kitsune release was surprisingly quick. Within an hour of meeting with Jackie, Fukushu found himself standing in the portal room within the S.P.E.A.R offices. The prison officers within S.P.E.A.R retrieved his hakama as well as his katana, Fukushu quickly stripping off his prison jumper. It felt good to once more wear his own clothing, yet he could detect a faint smell of mothballs. When he returned home, he would have to wash.<br />
<br />
As the portal closed behind him, Fukushu smirked as he saw Abolith and his children waiting for him. Raiden, his son, all smiles, the kits tail wagging furiously as he sprinted forward squeezing his father in a tight hug. Fukushu taking a knee so his son could wrap his arms around him.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re home,&quot; Raiden said happily. &quot;I missed you dad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I missed you too son,&quot; Fukushu replied softly. Fukushu now glanced to his daughter, the elf girl so much like him. Stella&#39;s face was stoic, despite her youth. The kitsune now wondered what the teenage elves response would be. &quot;Stella?&quot;<br />
<br />
Stella&#39;s face broke, tears streaming down her delicate cheeks as she sprinted forward. The elves red and black hair trailing behind like streamers as she buried her face in Fukushu&#39;s chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Daddy!&quot; she cried.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Fukushu said softly. &quot;I missed you too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Embracing his children, Fukushu now stood to his full, imposing height. At close to seven feet tall, his teenage children stood perhaps chest high, clinging to his waist as he gazed at Abolith. Although the elf remained expressionless, the kitsune could see a joyful light in her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;I take it you missed me beloved?&quot;<br />
<br />
Abolith frowned, Fukushu noticing the assassin trying her level best to hide a smirk.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am used to your absences beloved,&quot; she stated. &quot;However, our children are not. More importantly, if the realm knew of your whereabouts, I fear our children would be at risk.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you did miss me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Abolith sighed, marching towards Fukushu before pulling his vulpine face down, kissing it gently.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do not get cocky,&quot; she smirked. &quot;But yes, I did miss you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu chuckled softly, flashing the elf an impish grin. Despite the couples cold and standoffish demeanor, the love they felt ran deep. Both elf and kitsune lived a difficult life, enduring many hardships. Those hardships strengthened their bond, making them inseparable.<br />
<br />
&quot;Before you get too comfortable beloved,&quot; Abolith stated. &quot;Your brother wishes to see you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Takeo?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No Chisai,&quot; Abolith replied.<br />
<br />
Fukushu raised an eyebrow. Chisai rarely left the forge, if he was here it must be important.<br />
<br />
&quot;Judging by your expression you are concerned,&quot; Abolith replied. &quot;I assure you, everything is fine. Despite Chisai&#39;s penchant for remaining in the forge, it is good news. Just be prepared for a surprise.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know I hate surprises beloved,&quot; Fukushu grumbled.<br />
<br />
Abolith smirked, beckoning her children to her side.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you will enjoy this one,&quot; she said. &quot;We will be waiting for you upstairs.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu sighed, waving goodbye to his children as he trudged towards the area Abolith said his brother was waiting. As they marched onwards he began to ponder what Abolith was getting on about? He despised surprises. Perhaps,it was years serving in the army. Fukushu was meticulous in his planning. If one were surprised, it would cost lives and lead to possible defeat. The last thing he wanted was to be caught off guard.<br />
<br />
As he turned the corner, Fukushu could see Chisai standing in front of the library. Despite Chisai standing at six and half feet tall with a barrel chest, Fukushu stood a few inches taller. Surprisingly though, Fukushu could see Chisai standing with Lady Odayakana, the pair holding hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chisai,&quot; Fukushu stated. &quot;Lady Odayakana.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello brother,&quot; Chisai grinned. &quot;They finally let you out?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They did,&quot; he stated, studying the five and two tailed kitsune carefully. &quot;May I ask about...this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh right,&quot; Chisai said quickly. &quot;So...while you were away, Odayakana and I we um..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your brother and I have begun seeing each other,&quot; Odayakana finished. Fukushu raised an eyebrow, looking between the odd couple. Chisai, the blue collar forge master and Odayakana, the Lady of the Shimizu clan in the north. It seemed unfathomable that these two would have anything in common.<br />
<br />
&quot;How long was I gone?&quot; he thought.<br />
<br />
Composing himself, Fukushu gave the couple a small smile before bowing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Congratulations to you both,&quot; Fukushu stated. &quot;Abolith mentioned a surprise and this certainly is a pleasant one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh we&#39;re not the surprise,&quot; Chisai said quickly. Fukushu raised an eyebrow. If his terminally single brother dating wasn&#39;t the surprise then what was it? Chisai and Odayakana now opened the door to the library slightly, a wide smile spreading across their faces. &quot;Go on brother,&quot; Chisai said. &quot;I think you&#39;ll like this surprise.&quot;<br />
<br />
Taking a deep breath, Fukushu took an apprehensive step forward. If his family was planning a party upon his release from S.P.E.A.R custody, he would lose his temper. The last thing he wished was to reminded of his incarceration. As he entered the room, he feared the worse. Kiko, Takeo, Mika, and even Kari stood in front of him, smiling from ear to ear. Before Fukushu could utter a word, the group parted, completely shocking the nine tailed kitsune.<br />
<br />
&quot;It can&#39;t be,&quot; he whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jiro,&quot; Yomi asked nervously. &quot;Are you okay? Everyone said you were away, but no one would tell me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yomi,&quot; Fukushu asked. &quot;H..how?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jiro,&quot; Yomi asked once more, the eight tailed kitsune looking distressed. &quot;Why do you look so pale? Are you sick? Were you in the hospital and no one told me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu watched as his sister tugged on her purple kimono, a nervous habit she had since she was a kit. It was Fukushu who would always calm her whenever that happened, until he left. The memories of those times flooding back and overwhelming the none tail.<br />
<br />
Fukushu&#39;s expression broke, his lip trembling as his face twisted in agony. Tears fell from his eyes, a choked sob escaping from the kitsune as he rushed forward, squeezing his long lost sister.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yomi,&quot; he sobbed, his fingers entwined in her white fur.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jiro why are you sad,&quot; Yomi asked nervously. &quot;Did I do something wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Fukushu sniffed. &quot;No, you never did anything wrong Yomi. I&#39;m...I&#39;m so happy to see you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m happy to see you too Jiro,&quot; Yomi replied as Fukushu&#39;s crying resumed.<br />
<br />
No one said a word, watching as the stoic, vengeful, kitsune sank to his knees. Fukushu cried, his sobs almost childlike as he gripped Yomi. Everyone in the room understood the significance of the moment. After so many years, after silently holding onto so much pain, Fukushu was finally reunited with his beloved sister.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m so happy you&#39;re back brother, where were you this whole time?&quot; Yomi said looking at her brother.<br />
<br />
Fukushu wiped away his tears and composed himself as best as he could.<br />
<br />
&quot;It...it doesn&#39;t really matter. I was away, but I&#39;m back now, and so are you, but....Yomi, how are you back here?&quot; Fukushu asked as Yomi just shrugged.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahem, I believe I can answer that for you Fukushu,&quot; Mika said as everyone now looked to her and Chisai came into the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, I was just saying goodbye to Odayakana. She had other thing to do.&quot; Chisai apologized as he came up to them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway, Travis, the son of Life and Death made a deal with the Demon Queen Annie Pendragon to protect those she loves. Annie released Yomi for helping destroy the Superior Church.&quot; Mika explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now I understand why she took that vile woman.&quot; Fukushu remembered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, so....since then Aunt Yomi has just been readjusting to everything again. We&#39;ve all been helping her in our own way.&quot; Kari went on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I&#39;m just so happy to have you back home Jiro.&quot; Yomi said hugging her brother again as he hugged her back and smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I have a question I think we&#39;d all like answered: why does she keep calling you &#39;Jiro&#39;?&quot; Kiko asked as the others all now looked at him as well for an answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uncle, doesn&#39;t the name &#39;Jiro&#39; mean second son? Isn&#39;t that right?&quot; Kari asked.<br />
<br />
Fukushu looked around him as everyone was now looking at him for an answer. Fukushu knew his parents wouldn&#39;t like this if they knew he was doing this, but with Yomi back, it seemed he owed everyone an explanation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everyone, follow me and don&#39;t say a word until we get to where we&#39;re going.&quot; Fukushu instructed as they all followed him out of the library.<br />
<br />
Fukushu directed them to the outside of the palace, and then motioned them all to a side entrance of the palace before opening a heavy door. The corridor they traveled in was dark, only lit by a few oil lamps. Kari held onto her mother&#39;s arm as they all traveled inside further along while everyone looked around.<br />
<br />
&quot;I used to travel all over the castle, how is it I missed this place?&quot; Yomi asked nervously as they neared what seemed like the end.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because this area has only been traveled by myself and our parents.&quot; Fukushu stated. &quot;It can only be accessed by that door, Only the three of us have come here often to pay our respects.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Re-respects? Respects for who?&quot; Takeo asked as all of them had the same confused looks on their faces.<br />
<br />
Fukushu reached over towards the wooden door before taking a breath and slowly opened it. Inside the room was a small shrine, they saw a series of oil lamps illuminating the area. Fukushu approached the shrine, they all noticed three candles in front of a portrait of a silver teenage kitsune.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fukushu, who...who is that?&quot; Yomi asked sounding concerned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kari is right, there is a reason I was originally named &#39;Jiro&#39;. It was because I was the second son of Tatsu and Shizen. This was our eldest brother, Raiden.&quot; Fukushu answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Raiden?!&quot; Everyone save Fukushu said in surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait a minute,&quot; Mika suddenly realized. &quot;Your son, he&#39;s....he&#39;s named after him, isn&#39;t he?&quot; Mika asked holding back tears realizing why Fukushu named his son.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. My son is named after the uncle he never knew.&quot; Fukushu looked around at all of them as they all looked to him for more answers.<br />
<br />
&quot;A very long time ago, when our people still resided in the mortal realm, I was a very curious and adventurous child. Perhaps 6 years old by human standards , still very young, but still very naive. Raiden was a two-tailed kitsune, approximately 13 years of age, and like any little boy, I looked up to my brother. He was my hero, I wanted to be just like him.&quot; Fukushu said with a reminiscent smile.<br />
<br />
Fukushu then looked over towards Yomi and put a hand on her shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;You and Hikari had only recently been born. You were both driving mother and father ragged. Your sleep schedules were very chaotic and despite mine and Raiden&#39;s best efforts, we weren&#39;t very helpful.&quot; Fukushu said as Yomi gave a little smile and chuckle alongside her brother.<br />
<br />
Fukushu now grew quiet. The others waited for him to continue as he took a deep breath.<br />
<br />
&quot;One day, you both fell asleep at the same time allowing Raiden and I to do whatever we wanted. I decided to explore the human side and came upon some farmers. Like any child might do, I tried to make friends, but instead they tried to capture me believing my tail might allow them some magic power.&quot; Fukushu explained as he now took a deep breath.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fu-Fukushu, you....you don&#39;t need to go on, I think....I think we all know where this is going.&quot; Kiko urged.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, I will continue. You all must know.&quot; Fukushu said as continued on. &quot;Raiden arrived to save and free me. When he told me to run, I only cowered behind him forcing him to defend me. He fought with honor, but he was still only a boy like me if not a little older. The humans soon beat him to death. His last words will forever be etched in my mind.&quot; Fukushu said as he now hesitated.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? What did he say?&quot; Chisai said with tears in his eyes.<br />
<br />
Fukushu looked to see everyone either had tears down their cheeks or were trying to hold back their tears.<br />
<br />
&quot; &#39;Don&#39;t hurt my little brother&#39;.&quot; Fukushu said as he pinched his nose and took a deep breath before continuing.<br />
<br />
&quot;After that....father came looking for us. When he saw Raiden.....well, I don&#39;t think I have to tell you. You all can guess how he felt.&quot; Fukushu said as they all nodded knowing how Tatsu would&#39;ve reacted.<br />
<br />
&quot;We kept the knowledge of Raiden secret after that. Hiding away all his portraits, never telling Hikari and Yomi about their older brother. Eventually the rest of you came along.&quot; Fukushu finished.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think now I understand why there&#39;s such a huge age gap between you, Yomi, and the rest of us,&quot; Takeo said softly. &quot;Mom and Dad were devastated when he died.&quot; Fukushu nodded. After Raiden&#39;s death, Tatsu and Shizen would not give birth to another child for 200 years.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, every once in a while, one of us comes down here and lights a candle to remember him.&quot; Fukushu said as he lit one candle with a match near the portrait.<br />
<br />
Just as suddenly as he lit the canlde, the candle, along with all the oil lamps suddenly went out altogheter. Kari got a little scared and held on tightly to her mother who held her for comfort. Everyone watched as not just one of the candles on the shrine lit back up, but all three of them, and they all held their breaths seeing the image of a kitsune before them, the ghost of Raiden himself, just as he looked like all those years ago.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, it&#39;s so good to finally see you all together.&quot; Raiden said as he walked towards them, even though none of them heard his footsteps.  &quot;Was wondering when you would bring the others down here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Rai....Rai....Raiden?&quot; Fukushu said quietly.<br />
<br />
Raiden grinned, gazing at his siblings with a mischievous smirk. Each and everyone of his siblings were shocked by his appearance. &quot;What&#39;s the matter,&quot; he smiled. &quot;You look like you&#39;ve seen a ghost.&quot;<br />
<br />
Raiden first walked up to Fukushu and looked him up and down.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve really gotten big little brother. Those years in the army did wonders for you.&quot; Raiden smiled and chuckled.<br />
<br />
Raiden now looked over to Yomi and smiled kindly at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve become very beautiful woman Yomi. Don&#39;t give Jiro too much trouble now that you&#39;re back.&quot; Raiden said giving a big smile towards her.<br />
<br />
Raiden now walked over to Chisai, Kiko, and Takeo and looked them all over up and down.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s great to finally be able to meet you all in person. Well, mostly in person. Chisai, I bet I would&#39;ve rivaled you in the muscle department if I had put more effort into exorcise.&quot; Chisai said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kiko, I&#39;ve seen you light up practically any room you go into. You&#39;re really lucky to have a guy like Kenta.&quot; Raiden complimented as Kiko gave a confused smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Takeo, I&#39;m also glad you and Aiyo got together, I was worried you&#39;d never get out of your comfort zone. Frankly, I&#39;m surprised you beat old Chisai in the romance department.&quot; Raiden chuckled as Takeo chuckled a little bit too.<br />
<br />
Raiden now made his way over to Mika and Kari. Mika seemed unable to look directly at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I....I shouldn&#39;t....I shouldn&#39;t be here. I&#39;m not....technically your sister.&quot; Mika said shaking her head.<br />
<br />
Mika gasped as she almost felt Raiden&#39;s ghostly hand touch her chin and bring it up to his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re not technically my sister. You ARE my sister, you are my family, and I couldn&#39;t love you more.&quot; Raiden said as tears fell from Mika&#39;s eyes while she tried wiping them away but couldn&#39;t stop crying.<br />
<br />
Kari put her hand on her mother&#39;s shoulder while Kari held her daughter&#39;s other hand tightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You look just like her, you know? Hikari. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve been told that. But it&#39;s good to finally meet a niece of mine.&quot; Raiden said with a wink knowing he knew more than he let on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Raiden, how....how are you here again?&quot; Fukushu asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I never really left. I&#39;ve been watching you all in the afterlife. I&#39;ve watched all your ups and downs. But I&#39;m so happy to see how far you&#39;ve all come in your lives.&quot; Raiden said smiling at them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Raiden, I....I&#39;m....&quot; Fukushu now dropped to his knees and cried. &quot;I&#39;m sorry.....I got you killed....can you ever forgive me?&quot; Fukushu said through his tears.<br />
<br />
Raiden walked over and slowly lifted his brother&#39;s face to his own.<br />
<br />
&quot;There was nothing to forgive Jiro. I never blamed you once for what happened, and I&#39;m just glad I was able to save you. I know not everyone in our realm may see it, but I&#39;ve seen you become our peoples greatest protector. From your wife, to your children, to your nieces and nephews. You&#39;re the man I probably would&#39;ve become if I&#39;d grown up. I&#39;m proud of you little brother.&quot; Raiden said as he now wrapped his ghostly body around Fukushu who could feel the warmth coming off of him.<br />
<br />
Raiden now let go and walked back over to the shrine and turned to face them all as they all stood closely together.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll be around, even if you can&#39;t see me, I&#39;ll be watching over all of you and your children. Also, I know it might be hard for them, but....talk with mom and dad about me. I know they love and miss me, and I love them just as much. Just as I love all of you. Fukushu.....Jiro, welcome home.&quot; Raiden said as the candles slowly dimmed before going out entirely.<br />
<br />
When the candles lit back up again, Raiden was nowhere to be seen, but they all knew he was still watching over them all.<br />
<br />
Fukushu looked at all his siblings and smiled.</p>
