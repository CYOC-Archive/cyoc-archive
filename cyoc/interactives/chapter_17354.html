<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the wife retired for the night to sleep in passified slumber, I for one was now wide awake and scared to death. The infection, as the spirit within the specticles had called it, I having allowed Connie to suck me was seeing her infection now attacking me. I had to ask of the spirit why this was occuring, is this an infection or a curse?<br />
<br />
What seemed so odd about my afternoon romp with Connie was when her mother called for her to come into the house. Surely she saw Connie as did I, you can't hide that much difference of physical form under a sweat shirt and jeans. Besides even as she walked back up to the house her hocks and legs movement were not human, her strides and steps were like a hooves animal. Then too, Connie's head of hair was becoming infested with goat hairs of a much different color than her human hair. The thickness of it and as I saw also her ears were becoming longer and already had points.<br />
<br />
I went downstairs and getting the specticles from our home safe I proceeded to sit in the livingroom and placed them on my face.<br />
<br />
&quot;This place in the year my father was born, 1912!&quot; I said knowing this would direct the spirit to open up history and let me see what was back then.<br />
<br />
&quot;Spirit I need some questions answered, please!&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
As the spirit answered me I placed those questions which bothered me the most about this passing through ripples of time. My most urgent question was of course the mutations I was going through do to Connie sucking me. <br />
<br />
Like what I expected the spirit used the word infection not in the physical sense of the word. As like Ellen, and Cindy they were by effecting those life forms in the past their so doing was an infection of time itself.<br />
<br />
Ellen became as an equal part mentally of the stallion horse Seashore Run. Her compassions and sense of being with what learned knowledge she had attained to that point in life all added substance to what things the horse had discovered in life. As Ellen then infected the mind and from so doing the body of the animal, she in fact changed how he reacted to in his life and the way he interacted with humans and thus time.<br />
<br />
Each person who fell into the past or future events did some small change which caused ripples of change. As I surmised the changes of a person merging with an animal would make little ripples in time. Yet those having merged it other humans would easily effect the events which mattered most to the consistantancy of maintaining the grid of events. In like manner the events which transpire are each directly effected by other events, all make up a smooth movement of logical succession.<br />
<br />
When Cindy while moving in and about in a time long ago the current of time's river of events was as much a part making her as the infection. Her disturbance in the life pattern of that billy goat made the ripple in time. The reaching out to brace her falling over the animal and while being so... call it enhanced by the specticle she was as a mutation of the animal itself. If she had remained with the specticles still in place she was then able to return to her time. Had they become disloged and fallen off her face she like Ellen would have died here and merged into the animal's self in the past. It was the touching of the animal itself which caused her to become mutated here in her time and then passing on the curse to Connie and she to me.<br />
<br />
All this still had many questions coming to mind but with asking the specticles' spirit to answer me caused much aggravation and with it made my metabolism increase.<br />
<br />
The Spirit was more than just a creepy thing to answer question of its purpose and the rules which governed the things very existence, it saw me and made observations.<br />
<br />
One such observation was my physical mutation being caused be the oral pleasuring of Connie, as she was infected and herself mutating into a Nanny goat. It took note of my male organ's transition to the form and mannerism like that of a male goat.<br />
<br />
I was warned of my coming mutations and the ripple effect in time of a human being removed from the grid of common events. As I had by this time spauned my children and decentants the biggest part of those common events had been completed. The remaining part of my life was then making up small contributions to what others did and they in turn on others to make up that grid in time.<br />
<br />
The Spirit told me that if the mutation continued to its finality, I'd become Connie's mate and she one of my herd. Those events to which I caused effect would fall to my children.<br />
<br />
It was at that point I asked the Spirit if my dear wife would pick up the slack of me being mutated and gone from humanity. His answer terrified me even more as that from my changing penis I had then infected the wife and she too over the space of time was to become as Connie and onward into a nanny goat herself. The pattern there of common events was changing as a rip in the fabric of time widened. The wife's mutation to becoming a goat might infect others while she was feeling the rank passions of bestial form and beastly life. They were the rip in time as some would have more prefound places in the common events which made up our portion in rural history.<br />
<br />
Now I was really upset, I'd infected the wife too! Standing and pacing the floor I was reminded the specticles were in place and showing what this spot in which I stood was a part of the grid in the passing of time.<br />
<br />
Thinking I was made to look see and comprehend. Where way long ago my home was once a forest of massive old trees, by 1912 the city had begun to grow and spread out. The forest was chopped down and I stood in open pasture land. A slow turning of the head showed me I was standing near unto a farmer's herd of black Aberdeen angus cows.<br />
<br />
&quot;Spirit, Cindy became infected as you call it and then returning as such she caused the infection of her friend Connie. Why didn't the infection of Connie vanish when Joan and I put Cindy back into that time and holding her from falling caused her infection to cease?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
I was informed that the past was like something made of stone, it had happened and therefore was stiffly in place as a foundation for those coming events. As with Ellen her merging into the animal Seashore Run did little to change its meager life of running races and being at stud. Few animals make marked changes in human lives, while humans are the quint essential item to change who history unfolds.<br />
<br />
As to the future events they are very fluid yet and if one were lost to coming events there would be others who with little effort could fill in the gap. The crux to this all is when it effects future events due to one not having mated in proper succession and from this the children and their heritage and futures are effected.<br />
<br />
The Spirit mentioned of Connie in her future would have discovered she was gay and lesbian and from this would never have children of her own. It was from this she remained infected and her contribution to future and history was so small that becoming a Nanny goat to presidence. As then a Nanny goat she would produce young and make a difference in the well being of those who owned the goat herd.<br />
<br />
So it is of very random situations of which we all are a part which makes these transformations possible, but just for some! This is why such transformations are not reported, and as they happen thier meager contribution to history is filled in by others. <br />
<br />
My major contribution being now completed with the birth of our children I am able to be so infected and will in short time mutate becoming yet some different form of life. The wife too, like me has made her contribution to history and with us enjoying my changed penis tonight we are both on our way to new perspectives as goats.<br />
<br />
&quot;Spirit, may I ask if there may be a way for me and or the wife too, can we become say pony horses rather than as goats? I had for a long time wished to be as a Welsh Mountain pony and stallion. The wife I think knew this as living around anyone their patterns of attention is noticed. I would if it could be to take her along with me into my fantasy desire, we living as such a creatures.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was possible but I had to do it soon before too much of me had mutated to another totally different species. As my metabolism was older the changes would come on slower. It for me was to be within the space of a month that I would cease to exist as a human on the face of the earth. If I was to effect my change, the wife's mutations, and have us both become as ponies in the flesh, I'd need to act soon.<br />
<br />
Returning to that exact spot in the livingroom, I was able to remove the specticles and begin my search for the right place in time to commit both, I and the wife to lives of equine pleasures.</p>
