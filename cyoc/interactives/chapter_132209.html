<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The thing that most people were looking forward to was the Summer Mister and Miss Farmhand Pageant Games, the UFC-A maiden tournament, and the official opening of the Mesozoic Fight Club alongside Project Dinotopia. But that didn&#39;t mean that there weren&#39;t any other things going on, both before, during, and after.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Dr. Jones was looking over the applicants for Project Hermaphroditus, and their reasons for volunteering. It would help out some on which ones would qualify for discounts/reimbursements.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve thing I&#39;ve got six for the initial project.&quot; said Dr. Jones, after a while, &quot;Three each for both hyena and horse. These qualify for being first because they suffered at the hand of the Black Market.&quot; On seeing Judy&#39;s confused look, Dr. Jones, explained, &quot;The Black Market is basically illegal goods and services provided by organized crime, mainly drugs. These people, however, suffered at the hands of illegal gender reassignment surgery. The problem with that is that, with all black market surgeries, you&#39;re more likely to get a botched surgery rather than a complete one, which will also be more likely to being repaired to death. One of them is offering to be cooperative for revealing where the &#39;surgery center&#39; is and who the &#39;kingpin&#39; is as long as her old identity is erased.<br />
<br />
&quot;Happy to comply.&quot; said the scientist, glad that another part of organized crime was going down.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, there was a discussion in the offices of the PR-MD.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nessa is going to go back to Scotland for a week&#39;s vacation in July.&quot; said one member.<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s no problem in visiting the old homeland.&quot; said another.<br />
<br />
&quot;The problem is that National Geographic is going with to have her do a search for the Loch Ness Monster.&quot; replied the first.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why is that?&quot; asked the second.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because Nessa said she was going to spend that week at McDuff&#39;s Castle, one of the oldest, and most complete, Scottish castles in Europe. The reason for this is because she used to visit a friend there when she was a kid and swim in Loch Ness. It&#39;s now owned by her friend&#39;s granddaughter, Aggie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Be sure to let Nat. Geo. know that Nessa&#39;s primary reason for this is vacation, not a documentary.&quot; said the second member.<br />
<br />
&quot;Duly noted.&quot; said the primary contact for PR-MD.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
There was also a summer vacation planned for the members of Project White Lily and the Five Elementals. Though it had to wait until after the UFC-A tournament was over (or all the members of the group were eliminated in the tournament, whichever came first).<br />
<br />
For Buford and Aleta, this was their official first date, by spending a week at Mieni Atoll and Vilcabamba, each. It was also a chance for Buford to learn the differences of breathing underwater in both ocean saltwater and river freshwater.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
There was also the fact that there would be a group wedding as part of Project Dinotopia, while Jill would be having her own wedding in New Orleans. One of the big questions for that to be answered was the catering menu, as well as the activities of the receptions.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Later, Dr. Jones was reading the files of the first two men with &quot;Regressive Hypersexuality&quot;, as it was now officially known. The two men whose files were now in Dr. Jones&#39; hand detailed two completely different cases, but a somewhat similar theme.<br />
<br />
The first one, belonging to a man named Marvin, detailed on how he was originally recorded in the LVPD as a survivor of gang violence, but during the surgery to remove the bullet from his left bicep tendon, it was discovered that he was suffering from hypertrichosis, and the bullet that was used to shoot (but didn&#39;t kill, due to extreme luck) was made of sterling silver, which upgraded it to an organized hate crime. He had a rather successful career in the latter days of the &quot;circus freak&quot; era, but when it ended, he was able to get a decent job doing paperwork for the casino now known as Circus Circus. After he was converted into a wolf Animalian (his circus experience as a &#39;wolf-man&#39; being part of the reason), he still had what could now be described as a &#39;treasure trail&#39; (as it&#39;s now known) that was darker colored than his fur, while also being in the super-heavyweight category of musculature. The reason he had been reported to Dr. Jones because he was seemingly more sexually &#39;loose&#39; while working at the Meat Market during &#39;Beefcake Special&#39; days, which concerned his co-workers, but not his female customers. Dr. Jones&#39; general opinion was that it was PTSD due to getting shot at with a silver bullet, but he had to do his evaluation to make sure.<br />
<br />
The other was of Stuart, who was born with Down Syndrome in the 1930s, making him the oldest surviving male with Down Syndrome. Later in his life, he was initially diagnosed with genital elephantiasis as well as genital herpes (he didn&#39;t know he had it until it was too late). It was decided to send him to Project Phoenix to see if the Animalia Virus could treat all his conditions. He was now a Zebra Animalian that was a little taller than Marvin, but just as muscular. This was considered unusual because many Zebra Animalians, whether converted or uplifted, never got any heavier than heavyweight build. It was also contained in the file that, while he did have genital herpes and Down Syndrome, the usual symptoms/markers for genital elephantiasis were missing, which seemed to point to a similar condition that Jen had, except it was specific for males rather than females. He was also being reported to Dr. Jones due to the fact that Stuart was acting in a similar way to Marvin after they were both employed by the Meat Market. It was Dr. Jones&#39; opinion that the hormone imbalance that Stuart had had somehow &#39;turbocharged&#39; the virus&#39; capabilities, and it was now going to his head, but again he had to conduct his initial evaluation to make sure.</p>
