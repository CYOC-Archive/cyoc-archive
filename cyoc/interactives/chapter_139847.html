<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Although Lynne was gone and things were beginning to return to normal, Lisa and Gloria couldn’t help but be saddened by the girls departure (even if they would see her agiain in a few short months. As mother and daughter now sat in the living following school the two found themselves sharing stories of the girl that had I upended their life over the last month.<br />
<br />
“That sister of yours is something else,” Lisa chuckled settling into the couch with a cup of coffee. “I don’t think I was ever that much of a livewire when I was her age.”<br />
<br />
“That’s not what grandma told me,” Gloria smirked.<br />
<br />
Lisa frowned before smiling at her step daughter. “Remind me monitor your calls to grandma and grandpa from now on. Not exactly thrilled about them telling stories about me.” As the two laughed Lisa placed her hand on her stomach once more, feeling the baby kicking.<br />
<br />
“Lynne kicking,” Gloria asked. Lisa nodded, feeling the unborn infant kick furiously. “Ugh I’ll say,” she groaned. “Ever since you sped up my pregnancy she’s been non stop. She must think my bladder is a soccer ball or something.”<br />
<br />
“Guess we can try her out for soccer then,” Gloria laughed as Lisa got up off the couch. “Good plan Glo,” she said. “Hey listen Ill be right back okay, just need to use the bathroom.” Gloria nodded as Lisa raced off to the bathroom. Left alone she now smiled as she thought of her little sister. <br />
<br />
Surprisingly Gloria found she missed the girl terribly. Although the two did not see eye to eye for a good portion of Lynne’s stay they had begun to grow closer before she left. She admired how brave and straight forward the girl was. Lynne didn’t put up with any non sense, she spoke her mind, which is something Gloria herself wish she did more often. In a way she kind of looked up to the girl. Lynne’s personality was completely different from her own yet they did have something in common, they would do anything for their family.<br />
<br />
“Hey kid what’s on your mind?”<br />
<br />
Gloria looked up to see Lisa once again settling onto the couch. “Just thinking about Lynne,” Gloria sighed. “I miss her, we were starting to get close.”<br />
<br />
“I now Gloria,” Lisa said sadly. “I could see that, to be honest I wish I had grown a little closer to her when she was here. It was great that you two buried the hatchet but just think, pretty soon we’re going to have the opportunity to be with her all the the time.”<br />
<br />
“True,” Gloria said. “But it won’t be the same.”<br />
<br />
As the two women sighed they felt a tingle begin to spread over their bodies. After dealing with magic for as long as they had the two looked anxiously at one another. “Glo did you use the ring,” Lisa asked in alarm.<br />
<br />
“No Mom,” Gloria said quickly. “Look I’m not even wearing it today. I put it in my pocket see.”<br />
<br />
Lisa watched as Gloria reached into her pocket producing the Ring of Age. Confused the two looked over themselves puzzled as to what was happening. Gasping in surprise the two watched each other anxiously as they began to transform.<br />
<br />
Lisa watched as her very pregnant stomach began to shrink going backwards until Lisa found herself no longer preganant. Running her hands over her stomach, she could see that the flat, toned stomach she was so accustomed to had returned. While this would have been something to celebrate normally she found herself in a panic, what had happened to Lynne. Looking at Gloria her jaw dropped as she saw where Lynne had gone.<br />
<br />
Gloria had watched her step mother become unpregnant and felt as if her heart was being ripped in two. Where was her sister going? Was Lynne okay? Before she could answer that question she felt nauseous. Quickly grabbing her stomach Gloria was surprised that her stomach felt bigger. Nervously she glanced down and watched as her stomach began to slowly expand. Gloria was speechless as her stomach began to push out, snapping the button on her jeans. In only moments Gloria found herself to be very pregnant with her sister.<br />
<br />
“What the fuck, what the fuck, what the fuck,” Gloria whispered as she held her stomach. Gloria was near hyperventilating as she gazed at her pregnant stomach. “Mom why am I pregnant with Lynne?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know,” Lisa answered, still shocked by this latest transformation. “I have no idea how this could of happened. Are you sure your pregnant?”<br />
<br />
Gloria jumped as she felt her sister begin to kick inside her. “Ummm Yeah I’m pretty sure,” she mumbled. “Feels like she’s practicing karate in there.”<br />
<br />
“Welcome to my world,” Lisa smirked. “But why would this happen? I’ll take your best guess.”<br />
<br />
As Gloria rubbed her chin she felt another familiar tingle course through her body. “Oh shit,” she mumbled as she looked over herself.<br />
<br />
Lisa watched as Gloria began to grow older. The girl was quickly maturing through high school, her waifish figure began to develop curves as her breasts increased in size. By the time she became 18 Lisa was astounded by the woman Gloria was becoming, a gorgeous face with amazing curves and full perky c cup breasts. Gloria’s progression ended as she became a college coed of 20, a very beautiful college coed with long flowing blond hair.<br />
<br />
“Wow Gloria you look great,” Lisa said in awe. Gloria looked over at her mother still in shock that she was now 20 and preganant. As Gloria was about to answer she noticed Lisa gasp in surprise as she clutched her body. “Mom what’s happening?”<br />
<br />
Lisa had an idea what was happening, it was just more intense than she was used to, glancing down at her hands she could see they were already looking smoother. “I’m getting younger,” she whispered.<br />
<br />
Gloria watched as Lisa inched away from 39. Slowly but surely Gloria could see Lisa’s breasts begin to perk up once more as her face began to smooth. Lisa ran her hands over her body, noticing she was gradually approaching her athletic prime once more, the slight bit of extra weight around her hips and thighs melting away. As the regression completed Lisa let out an enormous sigh as she stood from the couch. “Shit I can’t be more than 29 now,” she exclaimed. “Gloria I’m open to suggestions here?”<br />
<br />
“Um mom,” Gloria said weakly. “I think me and Lynne are getting closer so to speak.” Lisa frowned throwing her hands in the air at this explanation. “Well that’s just perfect,” she grumbled. “Then explain why this is happening to me.”<br />
<br />
“Mom,” Gloria stammered. “I...I think your about to become Lynne’s sister....her twin sister.”<br />
<br />
Lisa gasped as she took this information in. Once again Lynne’s magic was causing chaos in the Turner house, chaos that could find Gloria preganant with twins very shortly.</p>
