<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“… a 2021 Chevrolet Impala,” the boy says, “they are one of the newest and fastest cars. It’d be so cool to be one of the most newest cars out there. I haven’t seen a lot of them driving around here, so it wouldn’t hurt to have one Impala more for a weekend”. Ethan giggles, feeling all excited and giddy.<br />
<br />
The boy taps on the file of the 2021 Chevrolet Impala, a window opens showing him ways to choose how the “car” should look like and which part of his human body should transform into. Ethan first chooses a nice metallic-blue color, he chooses black leather seats and a matching interior. He then chooses the time for the transformation to last an hour, so that he can really watch the transformation in detail, next he sets the duration of the transformation to 48 hours. Ethan sets the transformation to be painless, he then decides to have the Chronivac linked to his on-board computer, ‘in case something happens which makes me have to change back sooner,’ he thinks to himself. He selects to have inside and outside cameras, so that he can see what is going on and act if someone tries to steal him. The next thing he chooses, which causes him to giggle and blush, is to have his testicles become the fob/keys of the car and his tiny penis become the gear stick. Satisfied with his settings, the moves a shaky finger to the confirm button, he lets his finger hover over the button for a while, after taking a deep breath, Ethan presses down and confirms the settings.<br />
<br />
Ethan feels a pins and needles type tingling running through his whole body, starting at his feet and traveling upwards. The boy shivers a little at the feeling, ‘th-that feels weird,’ he thinks to himself. Knowing that the transformation has started, Ethan hurries to his window, looking out he sees that all of his neighbors driveways and garages are empty. “Good, looks like I am in the clear. I should be good for an hour before anyone returns,” the boy decides to strip out of his PJs, since a car does not need clothes, “good thing no one will see me and it seems to be a warm day,” he mumbles to himself. Once naked, the boy picks up his phone and hurries out of his room and down the stairs. As he reaches the bottom of the stairs, he feels his ears stretch and start to go numb. The boy hurries to a mirror, which is hanging in the hall and gasps as he notices his ears looking like the side mirrors of a car, turning into the color of the car he’ll soon be. The boy then lets out a laugh, “haha… I look silly,” he says, reaches up to touch his “ears”, “man, my ears… I mean mirrors feel weird. I can still hear though, which is good, I should get my butt outside onto our driveway,” he then hurries out the house and onto his parents driveway.<br />
<br />
The 10-year-old walks into the middle of the driveway and stops, ‘this should do,’ he thinks to himself, ‘I better put my phone out of harms way, I don’t want to destroy it, better put it on the lawn. I have the sense that I’d be taking over the entire driveway once I am a full car’. Ethan walks over to the lawn and puts his phone down, the gras is high, so he doesn’t care to hide it. “No one will see the phone, I am sure of it,” he says to himself, walking back into the middle of the driveway. Ethan feels a prickling on his head and feels as his hairs retreating back into his body, once every single body hair has resided into his body, he feels his skin harden and then go numb, his healthy peach color shining, he watches in amazement as his skin tone becomes metallic-blue. The boy feels his hands and feet start to inflate, he looks down and sees his hands and feet turning black with a rubbery texture, soon he has four tires. Strangely he is still able to stand upright, suddenly his arms and legs split into various joints, including shock absorbers and springs. His arms suddenly snap upwards, lining with his shoulders, the boy lets out a surprised squeak as he feels his legs split sideways, causing him to lose his balance. Ethan falls forward, fast, towards the ground, but before his face is able to smack against the concrete of the driveway, he feels himself bounce upwards, as his front tires catch him, the hydraulics hissing. “Th-that was scary,” the boy says, “at least I know that my hydraulics work fine”. Now standing on all fours, unable to move, Ethan is only able to feel the rest of the changes happen. He feels his body start to widen and grow, his nose flattens, becoming the Chevrolet emblem. His eyes fuse together becoming transparent, before his vision turns black. Ethan starts to panic a little, but then remembers that he had set the program to give him camaras, ‘guess I’ll have to wait until my camaras have developed,’ he thinks to himself. He feels his mouth stretch into a grin, becoming the grill of the car. As his windshield, which has been his eyes a moment ago, finishes his eyebrows move downwards, becoming the wipers. Ethan’s body continues to stretch and grow, his face pushing forward as it continues to change into the front part of a car. Four doors appears on his sides, while his butt widens, his hole sealing shut, he feels his bowles hollow out, as it becomes the trunk of a car. He suddenly realizes that he can’t feel his penis and ball sack any longer, he feels his insides moving and changing as they become the interior of a car. Suddenly his vision returns, he watches as the interior finishes forming, ‘w-woah, my lungs are the seats,’ he thinks to himself, ‘I can feel the transformation coming to an end’. Ethan senses that two registration plates appear on the front and back of the car he has become, the plates show his name “ETHAN”, with that the transformation ends.<br />
<br />
Standing on Ethan’s driveway is a brand new 2021 Chevrolet Impala, ‘I… I feel so weird,’ he thinks to himself, ‘I feel… strong and powerful, must be the horse powers. So this is what it feels like being a car, pretty sweet,’ he thinks with a internal smile. For the next hours, Ethan tries out multiple things, like switching from camara to camara, turning the radio on and off, talking through the radio, checking the Chronivac on his on-board computer. The only thing he is unable to do is move, ‘man… and I wanted to know what it would feel like to drive, but I guess a car driving around without someone behind the wheel wouldn’t be smart,’ he thinks to himself. Ethan then feels tired, ‘the transformation was tiring,’ he thinks, ‘I could do with some sleep,’ so Ethan shuts off his power and enters sleep-mode. He is so tired that he forgets that the keys, which were his testicles, are sticking in the ignition and the doors are unlocked.</p>
