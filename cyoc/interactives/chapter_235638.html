<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Your eyes widen. The creature...the <i>person</i>...your brain identifies as your mother is, um, a rabbit. Well, sort of. The rabbits <i>you&#39;re</i> familiar with don&#39;t walk on two legs, and while she&#39;s small, she&#39;s clearly larger than they are. Her face isn&#39;t exactly how you&#39;d expect, either; it&#39;s not really a human kind of face, but it&#39;s more expressive than anything you can ever remember seeing on an animal. It&#39;s framed by long, human-like hair, as well.<br />
<br />
The proportions of her body are also nothing like human; she&#39;s short and somewhat stocky, with powerful haunches and relatively short legs despite the fact that she&#39;s clearly adapted for bipedalism. But she has definite human-like breasts under her fur...and on top of everything else, she&#39;s visibly pregnant.<br />
<br />
She&#39;s also...not carrying pancakes. Funny, you could swear you smell them like they were practically right there...and you can smell <i>her,</i> too, as a distinct scent, there in the room with you.<br />
<br />
Your...mother...? glances to the window, and you follow her gaze. As if the situation weren&#39;t strange enough, you realize now that the room is much different than the bedroom you&#39;re used to. The low ceiling is braced with rough-hewn timber; the walls are earthen, and the window is little more than a hole dug into one, letting in light and a warm breeze and the smell of grass. The floor is covered in a layer of thin wood shavings...and, now that you think about it, the &quot;bed&quot; beneath you feels suspiciously like a pile of soft hay.<br />
<br />
She shakes her head, her long ears swaying gently. &quot;I don&#39;t know how you can stand being so open to the outside,&quot; she says. &quot;But...well, I suppose that&#39;s the woodlands in me talking. No wild predator would come so near a city, after all.&quot; She glances to the desk in the corner, not far from your bed, and then over to you. &quot;Did you fall asleep in your clothes again? Dear, I know you&#39;re interested in this...work...of yours, but you <i>really</i> ought to take better care of yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
She comes over to the bed, and something else strikes you funny. She&#39;s small - no more than two or three feet tall, depending on whether you count the ears - but the room is scaled to match, and as she approaches you, you begin to realize that - <i>somehow</i> - you aren&#39;t really any larger than her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s get these off you,&quot; she says, setting right to unbuttoning your shirt as if this is nothing unusual. &quot;I know it makes the big folk take you more seriously, but there&#39;s really no need for them in the warren.&quot; She shakes her head and gives you a <i>tsk.</i> &quot;Goodness, your fur&#39;s all matted. We&#39;ll have to brush you out later.&quot;<br />
<br />
...Wait, you think. Your <i>fur!?</i><br />
<br />
Your mind races as you try to make sense of it all, but there&#39;s no denying what you see when she takes off your shirt and you look down at yourself. Your whole body is covered in fur - dense and light chocolate over most of it, with a downy cream-colored &quot;underbelly&quot; down the front of your torso. Golden-brown hair hangs into your field of vision and brushes your shoulders, considerably longer than you remember it being.<br />
<br />
But even more surprising than <i>that</i> is the fact that you have <i>breasts.</i> And as she unfastens the skirt (which you were definitely <i>not</i> wearing when you went to bed) from around your tail (and you realize that you <i>have</i> a tail, now) and slips it off you, you can see clearly down to your pelvic region, which only confirms what you&#39;re just now realizing. Not only have you somehow become a rabbit-person like your new mother, you&#39;ve become a <i>girl.</i><br />
<br />
In a daze, you stand up, finding yourself at eye level with her; it feels strange with your altered legs, and you realize that, like her, you&#39;re standing on the balls of your feet, but your body handles it instinctively, as if this were natural for you. You feel your ears twitch and bob above your head; while your mother&#39;s stand straight up, your own feel like they fold under their own weight partway up, and hang forward. You have the nagging feeling that they&#39;re <i>almost</i> peeking into view, but you can&#39;t actually see them.<br />
<br />
&quot;There we are!&quot; she says cheerily. &quot;Now come on down to breakfast; your aunt Flopsy&#39;s come to visit.&quot;<br />
<br />
Not knowing what else to do, you go to follow her as she leaves the room - but, almost by reflex, without even thinking about it, you grab and don a pair of <i>pince-nez</i> from off the desk. Everything snaps into focus, resolving a blurriness you hadn&#39;t really noticed &#39;til just now.<br />
<br />
As you follow your mother through a narrow tunnel that winds down into what you instinctively recognize as a burrow dug into the side of a hill, you quietly marvel at the sensations of <i>being</i> this creature you&#39;ve somehow become. Your fur softly rustles as your arms shift against the side of your body; your ears bob and sway more noticeably than hers seem to, and you could swear you almost catch a glimpse of one; your tail twitches idly behind you.<br />
<br />
You wonder, with a glance ahead, if your own figure is as defined by your haunches as hers is. Your gait certainly has a bit of sashay to it; whether this is from your broader hips or your shorter legs, you don&#39;t know. (Probably both, you realize.) Oddly enough, although your new breasts aren&#39;t small proportionate to your frame, at your reduced size they don&#39;t weigh that much, and require no support to remain perky and keep from flopping around.<br />
<br />
As you go, the scent of breakfast becomes stronger - and so do some others. You know there are people - rabbit-people, that is - in the room ahead long before you actually enter it, and as you do, your brain instinctively connects scent to person. Of course, you can <i>hear</i> them, too, more clearly than you could&#39;ve as a human; there must be a dozen children of various ages running rampant around the room, and the resulting din is almost a little much to take.<br />
<br />
But the figure that most catches your attention is an adult, another rabbit-woman around the same age as your mother. She doesn&#39;t smell like her, though; there&#39;s a distinctiveness to her scent (and a number of the kids&#39;,) and you realize they aren&#39;t sisters. You wonder whether she&#39;s married to some sibling of your mother&#39;s, or related to your new father. (God, you haven&#39;t even met <i>him</i> yet...) She&#39;s lop-eared; her fur is white, splotched with gray (including her ears and the front of her face,) and she has long dark-gray hair, hanging all the way down to the base of her tail. She&#39;s also heavily pregnant, clearly farther along than your own mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, look who&#39;s up,&quot; she says, with a dry smile. &quot;Honestly, Heather, how long do you let this girl sleep? It&#39;s seven already; we&#39;re halfway through the morning!&quot; She gives you a knowing look. &quot;Up late reading again, weren&#39;t you...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s no helping it,&quot; your mother laughs. &quot;This close to the city, it&#39;s no surprise that some of us have to live on big-folk time. At least she&#39;s working with people who don&#39;t begrudge us our siesta.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your new aunt nods and sits down at the table, sipping at a cup of coffee. &quot;I&#39;ve heard that some in the <i>big</i> cities are real slave-drivers with our folk.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, those types are like that even with their own kind,&quot; your mother replies, motioning you to sit down and sliding over a stack of the pancakes you&#39;ve been smelling this whole time. &quot;Or so we hear from Digger.&quot;<br />
<br />
As you tuck into the pancakes, forgetting for the moment the <i>incredible</i> strangeness of all this and just letting yourself savor the taste and the texture, you take a look around the room. It&#39;s a large, open living area cut into the earth, with a large post supporting a great central beam and a ceiling of sturdy wooden boards. There&#39;s a fireplace at the far end, not currently lit, and a number of grates set into the walls for ventilation. At the near end burns a smaller cooking hearth, where your mother and aunt have been at work making breakfast.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, little Digger,&quot; your aunt chuckles. &quot;How&#39;s he doing, these days?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not so little anymore,&quot; your mother says, flashing you a knowing smile that you&#39;re more than slightly confused by. &quot;He&#39;s turned into quite the ambitious young buck; he and my Jack are off trying to talk the councilmen into letting us extend the warrens up into the crawlspaces of some of the houses in town - if the townsfolk are willing, of course. That&#39;d make it easier for us to get around the city without getting underfoot of the big folk. He even has plans to start a delivery service using the tunnels.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, seems like just yesterday that we didn&#39;t even know what&#39;d become of him,&quot; your aunt nods thoughtfully. &quot;It was <i>awful</i> when-&quot; She pauses and glances around, making sure none of the children are paying attention, and leans in, lowering her voice. &quot;-when that cougar got his parents. <i>Ugh!</i> Makes me shudder just to think of it.&quot; She straightens up and returns to a normal voice. &quot;Lucky you could make a place for him here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, he&#39;s been nothing but a help,&quot; your mother says, pouring you a cup of coffee. One of the kids - a girl who looks to be maybe four years old and the spitting image of your aunt - abruptly nuzzles under your arm. &quot;Aun&#39; Connie, up!&quot; she lisps.<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s your <i>cousin,</i> sweetie,&quot; your aunt chides, as you absent-mindedly shift the girl up onto your lap, where she begins braiding your hair without provocation or comment. &quot;And you don&#39;t have to indulge her,&quot; she says to you. &quot;She gets doted on enough by her papa.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;O-oh, uh, I d-don&#39;t mind,&quot; you say, stumbling over your words as you hear your new voice for the first time. It&#39;s logical enough, but it&#39;s still strange to realize that you sound a lot like your new mother.<br />
<br />
Your aunt smiles. &quot;Well, there&#39;s no harm in it, I suppose. Really, though, when&#39;re you going to have kits of your own? When I was your age I&#39;d already had my first litter.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your brain seizes up as you try to process <i>that</i> question; thankfully, your mother jumps in. &quot;Now, Flops, Connie&#39;s a grown woman. She can make her own decisions about these things.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She <i>is</i> a grown woman, that&#39;s what I&#39;m saying!&quot; your aunt chuckles. &quot;Well, Nature takes its course all in good time, I guess.&quot; She gives your mother a Look. &quot;And I imagine <i>you&#39;re</i> going to say she&#39;s busy with her work, like you mention in every letter you&#39;ve sent for the last two years.&quot; She cocks an eyebrow and turns an ear toward you. &quot;What is it you do, again...?&quot;<br />
<br />
It&#39;s no use even trying to think of an answer; you&#39;re still stuck on the last question, glancing between your mother and your aunt and boggling over the thought that <i>that</i> is now a possibility for you, too staggered by the realization to even process how you&#39;re supposed to <i>feel</i> about it, let alone think about the fact that you apparently have a job or try to remember what it <i>is.</i> Luckily, your mother is ready to assist once more...</p>
