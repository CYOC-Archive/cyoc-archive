<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kiki rubbed herself through her bikini, watching the lesbian orgy in front of her. She really wished Lindsey was here so she could have some fun too. But she was content to film the pussy fest in front of her to show her girlfriend later.<br />
<br />
Just then, Kiki heard something in the distance that was getting louder: the distinctive siren of a police car. She looked out the window to see a police car with flashing lights heading towards the diner. &quot;Hmm...&quot; said Kiki thoughtfully before putting two fingers to her lips. She enjoyed the taste of herself for a moment before whistling shrilly. The bikini dykes looked up from where they had been pleasuring each other on the floor. &quot;Have ya&#39;ll done something that would have gotten you in trouble with the cops?&quot; asked Kiki.<br />
<br />
The converted head biker licked her lips before pursing them. &quot;We kinda did do some speeding and, like, other stuff...&quot; she said in a vacant sort of way.<br />
<br />
Kiki wasn&#39;t particularly worried about the cops coming in. In fact, it could help the infection quite a bit. &quot;Ok, you girls need to go into the back and keep quiet,&quot; said Kiki, &quot;And Frankie?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes?&quot; asked the two Frankies.<br />
<br />
&quot;The first Frankie,&quot; said Kiki, &quot;You need to head into the kitchen and make some special pancakes, quick.&quot;<br />
<br />
The former bikers collected their bikinis and headed into the back of the diner. There was little doubt that they&#39;d keep fucking each other, but at least they&#39;ll try to be quiet. Frankie picked up her apron and headed back into the kitchen. It only took Kiki a little straightening to make herself presentable.<br />
<br />
Kiki waited until she heard the sizzle of pancake batter on the grill. By that time, the cops were knocking on the door. Kiki walked over to the door and unlocked it. There were two cops there. One of them was a very large black man with an impressive mustache and a police badge identifying him as &#39;Officer Smith&#39;. Behind him was a younger white man, much skinnier. His police badge said he was &#39;Officer Nestor&#39;. &quot;Hey boys,&quot; said Kiki, &quot;What can I do ya&#39;ll for?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Miss, we&#39;re looking for a group of bikers,&quot; said Officer Smith.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever for?&quot; asked Kiki.<br />
<br />
&quot;Speeding, vandalism, and theft,&quot; said Officer Nestor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm...well, there ain&#39;t any bikers like that in here,&quot; said Kiki.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then what about those?&quot; asked Officer Nestor, pointing at the parked bikes outside the diner.<br />
<br />
Kiki looked at them and said, &quot;Huh, how long have those been there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Miss, we&#39;re going to need to look around,&quot; said Officer Smith.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thang,&quot; said Kiki as she let the cops in. There wasn&#39;t time to clean up any mess, but Kiki said, &quot;Sorry about that. We had a little spill and we didn&#39;t want customers walking in on it.&quot; The two cops nodded absently. There was something strange about the smell, but they couldn&#39;t put their fingers on it.<br />
<br />
Then Frankie stuck her head out through the window into the kitchen and asked, &quot;Hey, what are our men in blue having?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Two stacks of pancakes,&quot; said Kiki.<br />
<br />
&quot;Coming right up,&quot; said Frankie as she ducked her head back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Miss, we really can&#39;t stay,&quot; said Nestor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, you do busy, important work. You deserve some pancakes,&quot; said Kiki. At that, Frankie brought the pancakes to the window and Kiki took them to a table.<br />
<br />
&quot;I really shouldn&#39;t,&quot; said Smith, &quot;But it looks so tasty...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess we could stay for a quick bite,&quot; said Nestor. The two cops sat down at the table and tucked into the pancakes. Neither of them suspected that the milk in these pancakes was not the normal kind.<br />
<br />
&quot;You guys want some coffee?&quot; asked Kiki, walking two piping-hot cups to the table.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, ma&#39;am,&quot; said Smith, &quot;You got cream with it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right here,&quot; said Kiki, bringing a pitcher of cream to the table. Both cops added a generous amount of cream to their coffee. Though they weren&#39;t sure why as they usually took it much darker.<br />
<br />
Kiki watched with interest as the cops started changing. Like Frankie, Smith started slimming down an incredible rate, though a good amount of that mass was redistributing to his butt and chest. Unlike Frankie, his uniform was also changing size, keeping up with the new shape of the policeman&#39;s body. Kiki watched as the shoes grew high heels before they started spreading up their shapelier legs, their pant legs shrinking up to make room for them. Their arms were losing their hair and mass, becoming slender limbs ending with dainty hands. The two policeman (or probably policewomen) gave grunts of this discomfort as their shirts became too small. The shirts soon altered themselves to be more comfortable, several buttons coming undone allowing their new cleavage to be seen. Their badges were also changed, becoming flashier and now saying &#39;Officer Smut&#39; and &#39;Officer Nasty&#39;.<br />
<br />
Officer Smut moaned as her face became more feminine, her mustache disappearing. Her lips become covered with dark blue lipstick as heavy eye-shadow appeared on her face. The black hair grew down from under her hat, going down to touch her E-cup breasts. Officer Smut felt a burning sensation as she looked at her new partner. &quot;Mmm...I&#39;d like to do a cavity search on you,&quot; she said in her vevelty voice.<br />
<br />
Officer Nasty licked her pink lips. Her brown hair cascaded all the way down to her waist. Her breasts had only gone up to a C-cup, but that just made her more flexible. &quot;I love a woman in uniform,&quot; she purred. Leaning across the table, the two of them started making out. Their police uniforms were a lot less conservative now, with exposed cleavage, tiny shorts, and thigh-length boots. The two of them looked more strippers in policewoman costumes than policewomen.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what about those bikers?&quot; asked Kiki.<br />
<br />
Officer Nasty gave Kiki a confused look, &quot;What bikers?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The one you were chasing,&quot; said Kiki.<br />
<br />
Officer Smut waved a hand dismissively. &quot;They don&#39;t matter,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Still, I think you should go back to the police station and file a report about them,&quot; said Kiki with a meaningful grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooh, yeah, everyone should see it,&quot; said Officer Nasty.<br />
<br />
&quot;There are people who really ought to know,&quot; said Officer Smut with a smirk.<br />
<br />
Kiki grinned as the two policewoman got up and headed for the door. Before long, the police force will be all be luscious lesbians. Then the infection can really spread.</p>
