<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
The next morning &quot;Hahh...&quot; Jack huffed as he looked up at Steven, slowly waking up with the lion still on of top him. He was still buried deep in his ass. It was a nice feeling, but it also left him a bit sore. He wasn&#39;t sure how many times they&#39;d done that last night.<br />
&quot;Good morning.&quot; Steven yawned as he slowly got up.<br />
&quot;Morning.&quot; Jack replied as he sat up. He felt the pressure from Steven&#39;s body as he did so. He was still rather sensitive from the previous night.<br />
&quot;So, what do you want for breakfast?&quot; Steven asked as he stretched.<br />
&quot;Well...&quot; Jack thought for a moment, his eyes wandered over Steven&#39;s leonine body, noticing how much bigger and stronger he looked even from last night. It made him even more painfully aware of his own small size but it seemed... perfect. This was how he was meant to. He was Steven&#39;s. He blushed and looked down, stammering, &quot;I..I dunno...&quot;<br />
Steven leaned down, pressing his nose into the rabbit&#39;s. The rabbit shivered as the lion&#39;s hot breath washed over him.<br />
&quot;I know what you really want.&quot; Steven whispered into his ear.<br />
Jack shuddered at the words. The lion could tell that he had been thinking of nothing but him. He looked back up, seeing the same passion in the lion&#39;s eyes. He couldn&#39;t say no.<br />
&quot;And I&#39;ll give you anything you like, lil guy,&quot; Steven said as he picked up the rabbit and held him close, leaning in to nibble on the rabbit&#39;s long ears, &quot;After all, you&#39;re mine.&quot; He growled softly, meaningfully. He wouldn&#39;t let anyone else have his little rabbit.<br />
Jack&#39;s little body trembled as he felt his cock stiffen up. He couldn&#39;t believe how much he was enjoying this. He felt so much more alive.<br />
Steven chuckled, &quot;Though first, we probably should shower. We can&#39;t spend the entire day having sex.&quot; He winked, &quot;That&#39;s what night time is for.&quot; Jack acked as Steven did the 180 on him and grumped. Damn it that lion knew how to get him! But he was right...it was starting to get on in the day...<br />
Steven carried Jack into the bathroom and set him down on the counter. He turned on the water in the shower and left it to warm up before stepping up behind Jack, wrapping his arms around the rabbit&#39;s chest. He kissed his neck, pushing his muzzle into the rabbit&#39;s neck.<br />
Jack squirmed, his back arching as the lion&#39;s tongue pushed against his skin. His hips ground into the lion&#39;s belly, his cock pressing against the lion&#39;s thigh. Steven took advantage of the situation, his lips pulling away from Jack&#39;s neck and slurping down on the rabbit&#39;s hard cock. &quot;Doesn&#39;t mean I can&#39;t tease you while the water is warming up though.&quot;<br />
Jack whimpered softly, &quot;y..You&#39;re mean....&quot; <br />
Steven grinned with a predatory expression that caused Jack&#39;s lil heart to skip a beat as the instinctive prey response heightened his body&#39;s reflexes and senses causing the sensations to spike. &quot;Maybe, but you&#39;re mine and I do what I want with you...right, lil guy?&quot;<br />
Jack nodded slowly, ears folding back. He couldn&#39;t help but admit that the lion could play him like a fiddle... And he loved it. He loved him. He loved being his.<br />
&quot;And what do I do to you?&quot; Steven asked as he released his grip on the bunny&#39;s body.<br />
Jack felt his heart flutter as he felt the lion&#39;s hands trail down his sides, caressing his fur. His breaths quickened as his cock throbbed, making the lion&#39;s claws tap against his ass.<br />
&quot;Y..y..Y..You make me feel like the most desirable thing in the whole world.&quot; Jack stammered, his voice slightly higher than normal.<br />
Steven leaned in, pressing his nose into Jack&#39;s neck. He let out a deep rumbling growl, then pulled back, &quot;I&#39;m gonna make you feel more than just desirable, little guy. You&#39;ll feel needed. Needed in a way you&#39;ve never felt before.&quot; He stepped back, &quot;But not right now. Let the water get warm, and we&#39;ll finish cleaning up...&quot; Jack let out a very rabbit like thumping whining sound as Steven drew away. Steven shivered but he was firm and in control. He wouldn&#39;t let the lil bunny&#39;s cute, sexy noises distract him again. They needed to finish their shower first.<br />
Steven watched as the rabbit walked off towards the shower. He felt his own body stirring. His cock twitched as he thought about what he wanted to do to his little bunny. He used his all his restrain to push those thoughts down. The shower was quickly getting warm. Steven waited for a few moments, letting the water get hot enough for the rabbit to enjoy. He stood behind the rabbit, enjoying the view of his toned body. Jack was quite a sight. His small body coated in that luxurious fur, soft and silky, and it clung to his body now under the impact of the steamy water. Steven could smell the musk coming from his body. The scent of his arousal.<br />
Jack let out a low whine as the hot water touched his body, making his muscles tense up. He rubbed his furred belly and let out a contented sigh. The steam had a calming effect on him. He closed his eyes and leaned back, resting his head against the wall. He could hear the running water. It was so soothing. Steven could see how relaxed the rabbit was and grabbed some shampoo from the rack. He started gently lathering up the lil bunny&#39;s fur, rubbing his clawed hands over every inch of his bunny&#39;s body.<br />
Steven smirked as he noticed much Jack was loving the attention, &quot;I&#39;m going to see if I can arrange for you to move in here with me. Then we can do this every morning... After what we did last night.&quot; He started helping Jack rinse off the shampoo. As the water and shampoo ran down the drain, the scent of the rabbit&#39;s own musk and body became stronger. Steven had to hold himself back from taking the rabbit again right there.  He ran his fingers over the bunny&#39;s shoulder, noting the deep bite on the rabbit&#39;s shoulder where he had marked and claimed him. He blinked slightly, surprised to notice that while the mark had mostly healed up, it seemed to have caused the fur in the area to take on a slightly different color... making the mating bite very visible. <br />
Jack noticed what Steven was looking at and blushed. He said softly, &quot;I..I kinda like it.&quot;<br />
Steven smiled at the rabbit, &quot;I like it too.&quot; He leaned in and kissed the rabbit&#39;s neck.<br />
Jack let out a sigh, &quot;You really are the best.&quot;<br />
Steven chuckled, &quot;I know. Now come on, time to get out of the shower. You&#39;re all clean and if you stay in here you&#39;re gonna get me all excited again. You go start breakfast while I finish up.&quot; <br />
Jack sighed as he got out of the shower, his fur still wet but nodded, &quot;Okay.&quot; He glanced back at Steven as he started drying off. His soft short fur would dry fairly quickly but he knew Steven was going to need a while to get all fur of his clean and dry. Especially once that mane was fully grown. <br />
It was odd. He felt almost compelled to follow the gentle but firm instruction his ma..mate? master? boyfriend? All the terms jumbled up in his horny mind and just decided they all had their application. He shook his head firmly, ear flopping softly around as he cleared his head. Jack asked him to start breakfast! He finished drying off and hopped off to the kitchen.</p>
