<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Oakmoss was searching for his Rider, Luka allowed the drake to stay with her and her family until a Rider decided to take him, during that time, Oakmoss got to know Karyu&#39;s Rider, at first he expected Luka to be strict with her dragon, making Karyu do her work, he expected her to be the type of Rider that forces his or her dragon to lick his or her shoes. But in reality, Luka was the complete opposite, she cared for Karyu, even if he suffered the smallest wound she would quickly make herself sure that he was completly fine, Oakmoss even saw at firsthand how much Luka wastes most of her free time to tend to Karyu by cleaning and buffing his scales and horns, making herself sure that no fungal infection developed in his claws, and so on. Luka allowed Karyu to do as he wished, as long as she knew what he wanted to do.<br />
<br />
After Kayu ascended, Luka was entitled &#39;The General of The Riders&#39;, meaning that she had complete control over every Rider, she could easily decommision any Rider and she could easily take the dragon of a Rider and give it to someone else. Luka instantly proved herself worthy to be entitled as a general, whenever she found out that a dragon was abused by its Rider, she would quickly decommision the Rider and take his or her dragon away, giving that certain dragon to a much better Rider. Luka even promised to Oakmoss that she would find the perfect Rider to suit his needs, and if that Rider proved himself or herself to be abusive towards him, she would instantly condemn that certain Rider to the guillotine.<br />
<br />
At present, Oakmoss spended time with Karyu&#39;s and Luka&#39;s children, who quickly developed, unlike ordinary children, Kilin children develop much faster, right now, Karyu&#39;s and Luka&#39;s children look like they are five years old, they can speak without any form of problem and have no problem walking, Oakmoss told the two Kilin children his stories when he lived in the wilderness.<br />
<br />
&quot;And that&#39;s how uncle Oakmoss protected a village from a renegade dragon!&quot; Exclaimed Oakmoss, finishing one of his many experiences as a wild drake, being applauded and cheered by the two Kilin children, eventually Luka arrived, &quot;Alright, Jack, Darius, why don&#39;t you two eat lunch? Uncle Oakmoss is pretty tired.&quot; said Luka, she was instantly replied with a nod from her children as both of them went towards the kitchen, &quot;I have good news for you Oakmoss.&quot; said Luka, by hearing this Oakmoss instantly looked at Luka, &quot;An old friend of mine says that he&#39;s searching for a dragon for his daughter, he&#39;s gonna arrive today.&quot; finished Luka with a smile, &quot;I see, could you tell me more about his daughter?&quot; asked Oakmoss with interest in his voice, &quot;Her name is Celestia, she barely turned sixteen and she is a scholar.&quot; started Luka, &quot;She&#39;s pretty shy, but she&#39;s patient, kind and understanding.&quot; finished Luka, this made Oakmoss more interested.<br />
<br />
After a few hours, Luka&#39;s old friend and trusted lieutenant, Willhelm, arrived with his daughter, Celestia. Luka welcomed both the lieutenant and his scholar daughter in her house.<br />
&quot;So this is the dragon you found in the wilderness?&quot; Asked Willhelm as he looked at Oakmoss, while also taking a small sip from a glass filled with red wine.<br />
&quot;Yes, he almost has the same nature as your daughter, i felt like both of them would be the perfect match.&quot; Said Luka as she patted Karyu, who laid his great snout on her lap, purring like a cat.<br />
Oakmoss kept looking at the lieutenant&#39;s daughter, Celestia, her hair was braided and had a beautiful light yellow color, her eyes had the same coloration as Oakmoss&#39;s scales, he watched the young girl swiping the pages of her book, containing ingredients for the creation of concoctions and flasks.<br />
&quot;The only problem is that he and Karyu became mates, and they&#39;ll have to...&quot; Paused Luka, &quot;They&#39;ll have to see eachother quite often.&quot; finished Luka, she was quickly replied with a laugh from Willhelm.<br />
&quot;I have no problem with that!&quot; Said Willhelm, &quot;My dragoness found herself multiple consorts, i have to let her see each one of them on a daily basis.&quot; continued Willhelm, &#39;Great, now i&#39;ll have to deal with a dragoness begging me for a clutch.&#39; thought Oakmoss, &quot;But, my little princess must be the one to decide.&quot; finished Willhelm as he looked at Celestia.<br />
<br />
After more hours, Oakmoss left Luka&#39;s house as he went with Willhelm and Celestia to his new house, which was in the middle of the kingdom in a busy street.<br />
The lieutenant lived in a mansion, just like Luka, but the mansion wasn&#39;t as big, but it will do, the walls had a beautiful red coloration and the floor was checkered, with colors of white and black, Willhelm showed Oakmoss around the mansion.<br />
Time passed and Oakmoss was with Celestia, the young girl of the lieutenant was sitting near her desk, using a mortar and pestle to crush special herbs for the creation of a potion, Oakmoss looked at the young chemist, expertly doing her work.<br />
&quot;What interested you about chemistry?&quot; Asked Oakmoss suddenly, with a smile on his scaly lips, this made Celestia pause a little, she looked at Oakmoss who was smiling at her, in embarrassment she quickly turned her head as she kept crushing the herbs, Oakmoss knew that his new Rider is shy, he didn&#39;t mind it at all, when he was just a whelp, Oakmoss was also shy, avoiding any form of verbal communication with his fellow dragons.<br />
&quot;If you could tell me more about yourself then we could get along much better.&quot; Said Oakmoss, &quot;Hobbies, interests, favorite locations.&quot; finished Oakmoss, Celestia paused again.<br />
&quot;...I decided to become a scholar of chemistry because i thought that i could help the sick and soldiers by creating potions and medicines.&quot; Started Celestia as she looked at Oakmoss who was listening, &quot;I like walking around the forest in hopes that i can find medical herbs and flowers to create potions or elixirs of a helpful nature.&quot; finished Celestia.<br />
&quot;I see...&quot; Started Oakmoss, &quot;If you want to i could join you when you go searching for flowers and herbs.&quot; suggested Oakmoss, &quot;After all, i lived most of my life in the wilderness, i know much about it.&quot; finished Oakmoss.<br />
&quot;R-Really?&quot; Asked Celestia as she looked at her dragon with wide eyes.<br />
&quot;Ofcourse, i am your dragon, i must always be with you when you need me.&quot; Said Oakmoss, after hearing this Celestia, placed the mortar and pestle on her desk, and quickly went towards Oakmoss giving him a bear hug, in response, Oakmoss carefully hugged Celestia with his forelegs, making himself sure that he wasn&#39;t harming her.<br />
Meanwhile, Willhelm leaned on the door frame with his arms crossed and with a smile on his lips, watching his daughter loving her dragon.</p>
