<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">From the moment Jeff’s fingers hovered over the &quot;Self-Inflating Raft&quot; button, a thrill coursed through his body. His excitement was almost palpable, heightened by a cocktail of nervous anticipation and raw desire. He was six feet tall, lanky, with shaggy brown hair that always seemed to have a life of its own. His deep-set green eyes were scanning the screen nervously, the screen’s blue light reflecting off his round, wire-rimmed glasses. He had the sort of face that was slightly too angular, always giving him an air of quiet intensity.<br />
<br />
Jeff swallowed hard and clicked the button. A countdown timer displayed on the Chronivac, digits steadily marching down from ten. His heart pounded in his chest, each beat resonating in his ears like a drum. Ten... nine... The excitement was unbearable, an electric ripple across his skin. His fingers twitched, still hovering over the mouse.<br />
<br />
Eight... seven... As the countdown continued, thoughts raced through his mind. *Will this hurt? What will it feel like to be inflated? Where will I be stored?* The questions only seemed to increase his arousal. He couldn’t help but imagine the sensation of air pumping into him, stretching him out. The mere idea sent shivers down his spine.<br />
<br />
Six... five... He closed his eyes, trying to calm his racing heart. He could feel his chest tighten, not sure whether it was anxiety or excitement. Possibly both. Four... three... two... This was it. No turning back now. One...<br />
<br />
The moment the timer hit zero, the transformation began at his feet. An unfamiliar warmth spread from his toes upward. Jeff glanced down to see his toes losing definition, melding together and changing their texture. His skin shone glossy and orange. The transformation started slowly, like honey pouring over the edges of a jar.<br />
<br />
Soon his feet were entirely covered by this bright, eye-catching orange. Thin, rubber-like soles appeared, securely gripping the floor beneath him. It felt like he was wearing special, high-grip socks, yet the sensation was coming from his own skin. The changes climbed up his calves, reducing muscle definition and fat, reshaping tendons into smoother, more unified structures.<br />
<br />
The unfamiliar sensation was almost serene yet deeply unsettling. It felt similar to the gradual compression of a vacuum-sealed bag. He could hear soft creaks and pops as the internal changes started mimicking the consistency of raft material.<br />
<br />
When the transformation reached his thighs, his usual loose jeans morphed into a tight-fitting diving suit. The orange continued up his waist, coating his hips in the slick, latex-like material. *This... this is actually happening,* he thought, his heart never slowing its frantic rhythm. He felt his groin become less distinct, the sensitive flesh melding seamlessly into the new material. His once-defined masculine form was being shaped and pressed into something smoother, more uniform.<br />
<br />
The transformation swept upward over his abdomen, causing his navel to disappear, flat and featureless as the orange material reshaped him. He could feel himself tightening inside, vessels and organs slowly modifying to one primary function—holding air.<br />
<br />
Jeff stumbled towards his wardrobe, driven by an urgent need to see his transformation for himself. His legs felt slightly awkward, almost bouncy, as if adjusting to their new, smoother textures. He reached the full-sized mirror and stared in awe.<br />
<br />
Gone was the slightly lanky figure he was accustomed to seeing. Instead, a reflection stared back that was strikingly robust. The bright orange suit clung to him like a second skin, showcasing an unexpectedly impressive physique. His normally angular frame now appeared well-toned, every muscle definition and curve of his body exaggerated to perfection under the suit.<br />
<br />
His feet, once clad in casual sneakers, were now encased in slick, rubber-like soles—an integral part of him. Every inch from his toes to his neck was covered in the vivid orange material, which shone under the room&#39;s light with an uncanny glossiness that hinted at its non-human nature.<br />
<br />
Despite the surreal transformation, Jeff&#39;s head remained remarkably untouched. His shaggy brown hair framed his still-familiar face, and his deep-set green eyes were wide with fascinated disbelief. He leaned closer to the mirror, inspecting the transition between the orange suit and his own skin where it met his neck.<br />
<br />
To his astonishment, there was no seam. There was no clear distinction where the suit ended and his skin began. The orange material was indeed his new skin. He reached up tentatively, running his fingers over the glossy surface. The texture was smooth and rubbery, possessing a faint elasticity.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow,&quot; he whispered, his voice trembling with a mixture of excitement and disbelief. The situation was both erotic and horrifying. The orange skin was cool to the touch, yet he could feel the warmth of his own hand through it. The sensation was intensely intimate, blurring the lines between clothing and flesh.<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s fingers traced along the line of his jaw and down his neck, feeling the gradient shift from familiar human skin to the sleek orange material. The Chronivac had done an impeccable job; there was no visible flaw in its craftsmanship, no evidence that he was anything other than a human-raft hybrid.<br />
<br />
His mind raced with possibilities. *What would it feel like to be fully inflated? Would his body continue to change?* The thought sent another shiver through him, this one laden with a potent mix of fear and arousal. He glanced back at the device on his desk, still humming softly as it completed its complex tasks.<br />
<br />
He couldn’t deny the weird thrill that coursed through him about what had just happened. Every breath he took seemed more shallow, his skin tighter, almost eager to fulfill its new purpose. His heart still pounded in his chest, not from fear, but from an odd, exhilarating sense of fulfillment.<br />
<br />
*This is just the beginning*, he thought.<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s hands trembled as they hovered over the strange opening on his groin. It was like an open fly, but more surreal. The smooth orange material didn’t harbor a zipper, just the semblance of one. Curiosity and fetishistic desire burned inside him, pushing him to explore further. He cautiously reached in, feeling an alien handle. It was a small, rubbery ring attached to a string—a pull cord.<br />
<br />
*This must be it,* he thought as he grasped the handle. His excitement spiked, and his breath quickened. He hesitated briefly, the reality of his situation sinking in. But the lure was too strong, too intoxicating. He wanted—no, he needed—to know what it felt like.<br />
<br />
With a determined pull, he yanked the cord, initiating the inflation process. Instantly, he felt a surge of pressure welling up inside him, originating from his core. The sensation was both foreign and electrifying. His body responded in kind, starting to expand.<br />
<br />
Air started filling him, his torso slowly puffing out. The tension was everywhere, spreading warmth through his chest and belly. His muscles and tissues gently stretched, snugly encased in the orange material that was now part of his body. The suit expanded, though more significantly on his front and sides, making him flatter in depth compared to his width and height as if gearing towards a form suitable for buoyancy.<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s eyes rolled back from the sheer intensity of the feeling. His body rounded out incrementally; his arms and legs puffed up, rounding at the edges and morphing into the contours of an inflating raft. He could feel the air pushing his limbs outward, making them stiff and full. Soon, his arms and legs were rendered immovable, his hands almost flattened as air filled them up. The alien sensation blanketed him in an erotic haze. His body grew against the restrictions of the furniture, audibly pushing them away, filling every available space his expanding body could touch.<br />
<br />
Each intake of air felt like a prolonged, smooth wave of ecstatic pleasure. He was caught in an uninterrupted state of arousal that permeated through every fiber of his being. The inflation felt like a continuous full-body orgasm, the kind that started deep within his core and radiated outward. His nerves were alight, overwhelmed by the sensuality, as if he were perpetually on the cusp of ejaculation.<br />
<br />
He couldn&#39;t move, only feel. His rounded body wobbled slightly with each breath, the air swirling inside him. His thoughts scattered, each one drowned in a haze of bliss. His room became smaller as he expanded, his orange body now an immovable, solid mass filled with air.<br />
<br />
Unable to do anything but feel, he surrendered to the intoxicating sensation. Each pulse of air brought with it immeasurable pleasure, spreading warmth and delight to every corner of his new form. His chest heaved in shallow, euphoric breaths.<br />
<br />
He indulged in his rounded form, every movement restricted yet filled with an overwhelming sense of completion. His consciousness floated in the sea of pleasure, riding waves of sensation that seemed endless. His once analytical mind reduced to a single overarching feeling of ardent bliss. Each creak and groan of his inflating body was akin to a lover’s whispered promises in his ear, heightening his arousal.<br />
<br />
Every inch of him was alive and pulsing with the sensation, the joy of being something solid yet utterly different. He was both terrified and inexplicably overjoyed. In his transformed state, the boundary between horror and ecstasy blurred, leaving him in a continuous, liquid state of bliss. The sensation of air filling him from the inside was unparalleled, unlike anything he had ever experienced.<br />
<br />
He reveled in his strange, ecstatic ecstasy, fully embracing the transformation as he became a human raft.</p>
