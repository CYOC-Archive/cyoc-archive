<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Morning Master.”  Was Ashlee’s cheerful welcome in the late morning as her rubber arms wrapped themselves tighter around Danielle.  <br />
<br />
“Morning Ashlee.”  Danielle slurred out, still in the process of waking up.  <br />
<br />
“Can I get you anything?”  <br />
<br />
“Hmm, a morning coffee would help.”  Danielle began to slowly work herself up to a sitting position, the duvet sliding down to her waist.  <br />
<br />
“On it!”  Ashlee cheerfully obeyed as she jumped out and raced to the kitchen, her body squeaking as its limbs made contact with the ground and from its movements.  <br />
<br />
While waiting for the coffee, Danielle couldn’t shake off a feeling that something felt amiss.  Like there was something important that she needed to remember, but couldn’t quite work out.  Rubbing the sides of her head, to work out the tiredness and try and wrack her brain to recall the details, she almost didn’t notice Ashlee returning.  <br />
<br />
“Here you are!  I’ll tidy up now!”  She handed Danielle the mug and turned to leave before being stopped.  <br />
<br />
“A moment please.  There’s something I’m trying to remember, but I can’t quite work out what.”  <br />
<br />
“Really?”  <br />
<br />
“Yeah, feels important, but I just can’t quite figure out what.”  She turned to look at Ashlee, a faint recollection of her returning.  <br />
<br />
“Is there anything I can do to help?”  <br />
<br />
“Something’s coming back, hold on.”  <br />
<br />
Since a prior use of the Pen ensured that Danielle could recall details after they were changed, she could remember Ashlee as a normal human.  Working from that, a hazy recollection made its way to her as she jumped where she sat, almost spilling her drink onto her bare crotch.  Quickly setting it on the bedside table, she thrust her hands into the bin next to it, pulling out note after note before one caught her attention.  <br />
<br />
“Is there something wrong, Master?”  Ashlee asked her.  <br />
<br />
“Yeah, I didn’t make this one very well at all.”  Danielle replied as she realised how poorly-worded her last use of the Pen had been.  Taking another post-it note, she wrote down on that one.  <br />
<br />
‘Ashlee has her personality from before she was last changed by the Pen.’  <br />
<br />
A shudder seemed to run through Ashlee, as her old personality came back to her.  <br />
<br />
“Danielle?  What’s going on here?”  She demanded to know.  <br />
<br />
“I, uh, didn’t write that last one down right, so I had to make a correction to it.”  She explained slightly hesitantly.  “And there’s something else I need to take a look at.”  <br />
<br />
Walking into the living room, the pad that Ashlee had used remained where it had last been set, on the coffee table, looking over what was written on it, Danielle worked something else out.  <br />
<br />
“Ashlee,”  She turned to face her.  “When I first got this Pen, I made a ruling, of sorts, to make sure I could recall what had been changed, but it hasn’t been properly extended to you.  So unless I make sure you‘re aware of it…”  <br />
<br />
“…I’ll be subject to whatever happens.”  Ashlee finished the sentence for her, even with a rubber face, discontent could be seen on it.  <br />
<br />
“Give me one moment please.”  Danielle had her next piece ready after a few moments to get the wording right.  <br />
<br />
‘Ashlee will not be affected by anything changed by the Pen whenever I use it unless that is specifically stated.  The reverse is also true, with myself unaffected by the Pen unless Ashlee specifically notes that fact down.  This will also apply to changes made prior to this one made right now.’  <br />
<br />
Another shudder seemed to pass through Ashlee, but it could have been in Danielle’s mind.  But she looked herself over, at her own rubber body before seeming to recall the fact that she had actually wanted to be that way last night.  <br />
<br />
“So?  Anything else that needs fixing?”  Ashlee demanded.  <br />
<br />
“Hey, until a minute ago, everyone still thought that I was a guy.”  Danielle countered.  “That one was you, remember.”  <br />
<br />
“And I was practically a Sex Slave to you.”  Ashlee returned the fire.  <br />
<br />
“Neither of us were really awake there, and after that ‘session’, I was kinda out of it.”  Danielle defended herself.  “Still, I think that’s everything fixed now, unless you wanna be flesh and bone again.”  <br />
<br />
“Yes, but I think, I’ll stick with this, for now.”  Ashlee decided after a moment of thought.  “But as long as we both know about the Pen, may as well enjoy it.”  Her rubber arms wrapped themselves around Danielle again, the squeaking of rubber against scales audible.  <br />
<br />
“Any suggestions?”  Danielle felt the need to ask.  <br />
<br />
“Not at the moment, but there’s time to work that out.”  Ashlee decided.  “Though I wonder what’s on right now?”  <br />
<br />
Turning the TV on and skimming the channels revealed the usual line-up of Saturday Late-Morning shows.  From rolling news, to music channels, sports highlights, documentary shows, and kid’s shows.  Danielle had one arm around Ashlee, and tended to pull them in closer from time to time.  <br />
<br />
“You know, as you are, the wind could be enough to blow you away.”  Danielle pointed out.  “I could lift you with one arm right now.”  <br />
<br />
“I know, I just wanted a little longer like this, could you pass me that Pen?”  <br />
<br />
Danielle complied with her request, as she wrote down what she wanted, trickier for her given her hands.  <br />
<br />
‘I will become a female lizard lady, but as a biological life-form instead of a rubber doll, maintaining my current size but my build being closer to what it was before becoming a living doll.’  <br />
<br />
Ashlee could feel her body becoming heavier, as a beating heart returned to supply oxygen-rich blood from her refilled lungs around her body.  The crest she’d had became more natural-looking feathers that ran a short way down her back before reappearing at the tip of her tail, while her hips and breasts shrunk slightly, but not to the point where they had been.  Moments later, it was done.  <br />
<br />
“Whew!”  She gasped out as her normal functions came back.  “Okay, so other than our Dinner tonight, at that fancy restaurant, any other plans for the day?”  <br />
<br />
“Well,”  Danielle began, working out a plan of action.  “It is starting to get close to midday, we could either head out for lunch or have it here.  The reservation is for half-eight, but we should be there a couple minutes early.  As for what to do between them?  The Mall?  The Park?”</p>
