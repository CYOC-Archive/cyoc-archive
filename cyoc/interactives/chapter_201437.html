<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ocean says &quot;What do you- woof!&quot; and he immediately got surprised that he had suddenly barked. He tried to speak again but every sentence he said ended up with a bark no matter how hard he tried. &quot;You must- woof - help me, John! Woof!! Something is- woof- happening with my mouth!! Woof!!&quot;<br />
<br />
He was so worried about it that he didn&#39;t notice that hair was growing on his body in places where it hadn&#39;t been before while his already existing body hair was thickening and spreading further through his skin. Ocean natural golden blond hair was now clearly visible on his arms and legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you remember when you told me I should get a dog so I wouldn&#39;t be so lonely?&quot; John said with a big grin on his face. &quot;Well, instead of taking a random dog from an animal shelter I decided to take you as my new dog!&quot; Ocean&#39;s eyes opened completely in fear before he desperately tried to take the collar off his neck.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t clear if it&#39;s because of his desperation or any kind of magic, but he can&#39;t take the collar off him. On the contrary, his fingers started to reduce, quickly morphing his hands into paws that were pretty much useless. The same happened with his feet and after a brief moment, he lost balance and fell to the ground.<br />
<br />
Ocean felt very helpless since then. His arms and legs were thinning and shortening until they didn&#39;t look different from dog ones. His face began to form a muzzle as long as his ear lengthening like a golden retriever. Ocean can&#39;t talk anymore but he was continuously whining and sobbing like the helpless dog he was becoming.<br />
<br />
John just smiled satisfied as he watched  his brother pathetically trying to take his now uncomfortable clothes off, however he can&#39;t as he had already lost a lot of his former human mobility. &quot;Let me help you, Ocean.&quot; John said as he abruptly take Ocean&#39;s shirt off. He smiled as he noticed the tears running down his brother&#39;s furry cheeks.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re not a full dog yet, but you&#39;re already pleading? What happened with my hippie and overconfident brother who&#39;s always chilling out.&quot; John said before Ocean let out a long whine and pointed down with his already grown muzzle. &quot;What&#39;s up, boy? Are those big boy pants too uncomfortable for you?&quot;<br />
<br />
He noticed a strange lump near to Ocean&#39;s rear and realized what could be bothering him. John quickly took position behind his brother and, as fast as he did with his shirt, he took Ocean&#39;s pants off. Almost immediately, a long and fluffy tail jumped out. It looks like it has a life of it&#39;s own, because it was happily moving side to side despite how sad Ocean was.<br />
<br />
&quot;It seems you&#39;re completely a dog now.&quot; John said as he watched his former brother still squirming on the ground. He still looked uncomfortable for something. It wasn&#39;t until John saw Ocean&#39;s boxers that he realized it. &quot;Huh? What&#39;s going on in there?&quot; He said while he tried to take Ocean&#39;s underwear off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop moving!&quot; John shouted as he struggled to take those underpants and when he finally managed to take them he didn&#39;t wait to pull them down. Ocean whined once again but John didn&#39;t know if it was in relief or shame. Despite his body was the one of a dog, his genitals still looked human.<br />
<br />
&quot;That hadn&#39;t changed yet... Maybe it needs some stimulation.&quot; John said as he carelessly held Ocean&#39;s still human testicles and started to rub them. As he did it, John noticed how dog fur started to replace Ocean&#39;s matted pubes. When he realized it was working, John used his other hand to start stroking Ocean&#39;s still human dick. The new dog can&#39;t stop moaning and whining in the meantime.<br />
<br />
With now fully developed dog balls, John began to use both hands to stroke Ocean&#39;s dick. Like ink on water, his pink hue was getting red at the same time it lengthened. The golden fur below it was extending and created some kind of bag that ended up as Ocean&#39;s new sheath. He was still whining, but it was impossible to know if it was of shame, pleasure or both.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t until his mushroom head turned into a pointy rocket and a bulbous knot grew on it&#39;s base that Ocean let a last moan before he shot his first dose of dog seed. It landed on his chest which John didn&#39;t care to clean up. Instead he just watched his former brother&#39;s new dogwood starting to hide in his new sheath.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, you&#39;re definitely 100% dog.&quot; John said and immediately noticed that Ocean wasn&#39;t moving awkwardly anymore. In fact, he was behaving like a regular. &quot;Are you dog in mind as well?&quot; John asked but the dog began to lick his cum which John assumed was the proof that he now has a golden retriever instead of a brother.<br />
<br />
John smiled while he petted Ocean&#39;s head and the dog responded with a enthusiastic lick which John didn&#39;t like too much after knowing Ocean had been licking his dog seed. He looked at Ocean&#39;s discarded cloths in the ground while he thought what he&#39;s going to do now.</p>
