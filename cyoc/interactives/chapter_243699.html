<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Aaron awoke that morning to the sound of a vacuum whirring across the floor just outside his door. His mother was going through one of her cleaning fits, frantically wiping down windows and dusting surfaces, tossing out the old newspapers that collected on the kitchen table before straightening out a kitschy portrait of Jesus Christ on the wall opposite the dining room table.<br />
<br />
She only did this when they had company, important company. His mom had done something like this two months back when a dinner party with their church’s pastor made her go on a week-long cleaning binge to make everything spotless.<br />
<br />
Aaron groaned. The thirteen-year-old had been planning on spending a relaxing Saturday night playing FortressCraft, but now it looked like he’d have to spend the evening helping to entertain a bunch of stuffy middle-aged suburbanites. He avoided his mom for the day for as long as he could, trying to keep out of eyesight lest she see him and recruit him into her cleaning-spree.<br />
<br />
He slunk out of his bedroom as he heard his mother pass his door, tiptoeing towards the kitchen before grabbing a granola bar as a snack. Turning around to retreat to the confines of his room, he saw a note written on the table written by his dad, the thing the incited his mom’s excessive tidying.<br />
<br />
“Wendy called this morning. She said she’d come to visit today.”<br />
<br />
“Wendy…!” Aaron gasped like he was just dunked into water, reading the twin sentences together a dozen times, wondering if it was real.  The word “today” was written in red marker and underlined six times to try to dispel the incredulity to what was happening. Aaron’s sister, the sister who left for college and he’d never heard from again for seven years. She was coming back.<br />
<br />
A day hadn’t gone by where he didn’t think about her. She was a staple of his life back when he was young, a pillar even. When his mom and Dad were busy working it’s just be him and her together. And that was how it went most the time, Wendy eschewing the raucous trappings of high school life just to spend time with him as a surrogate mother of sorts.<br />
<br />
She was special. She was the kind and nerdy type; the sort that cut through any challenge school threw at her like a knife through butter. Naturally she was top of her class, naturally she’d get a generous scholarship to an Ivy Leage school like Cornell… naturally she’d move away and leave him.<br />
<br />
Days away turned to months turned to years. He never heard from her and never knew how to contact her. His parents didn’t either, only occasionally receiving the odd one-way communications like letters with no return address, weaving a messy web of conflicting stories about her life. From what he could make out from his mom and dad’s worried arguments about her through the years, she’d started out at school with aspirations to become a medical doctor, then that changed to becoming a lawyer, … then it just kept changing.<br />
<br />
It seemed so unlike Wendy to do poorly in school, it seemed even more unlike her to be so indecisive. It was impossible to tell if these frequent swaps in aspirations were happening because she was bad at the field or just couldn’t make up her mind. As the last few years passed, the story’s details became even sparser. Maybe she graduated, but his parents couldn’t find any evidence for it. The vague letters she sent suggested she got a position at a biotech research lab or went out backpacking across the country or even joined some sort of cult. They just couldn’t tell. He letters become harder to follow overtime, less coherent. His parents gave up hope of ever seeing again, but today out of nowhere, she’d come back.<br />
<br />
“Ding-dong!”<br />
<br />
Aaron froze, looking towards the front door at the end of the hallways that peaked out from the kitchen.<br />
<br />
“Dingdongdingdongdingdongdingdong!”<br />
<br />
The person on the other end rang impatiently as the loud sound of rushing air from his mom vacuuming upstairs obscured the sound. Aaron sheepishly stepped out towards the door, hefting in a breath of air, bracing himself to see his sister, his own flesh and blood he hadn’t laid eyes on for over half his lifetime now. He turned the knob, standing there frozen in shock the moment he saw her as if he were staring at Medusa.<br />
<br />
His sister. She’d grown. The diminutive bookish girl he remembered had grown well over a foot in height, her previous flat chest and square physique having evolved to ridiculous proportions now.<br />
<br />
He could tell. He saw it all vividly. She was standing their naked right in front of him.<br />
<br />
Wendy shot him a dopey, happy smile as she closed the distance. There wasn’t the slightest inkling of embarrassment or shame of her nudity sullying her face as Aaron sheepishly backed away from the voluptuous Madonna that looked just faintly like he remembered Wendy looking. The once pale, nerdy girl looked like each inch and every inch of her body was tanned, toasted just slightly brown as if she’d been working out in the sun for the whole summer. A bush of pubic hair managed to obscure her immodesty for the most past, her smooth curves jiggled softly as she advanced, her huge form eclipsing his as she knelt down just enough to wrap her arms around her one and only little brother. The almost-Amazonian looking woman set her duffle bag down beside him to devote both hands to her embrace, it looked caked in mud like it’d been stewing in a puddle for months.<br />
<br />
She didn’t say a word at first. Aaron on the other hand had so much to say at that very moment but couldn’t manage even a grunt. He heard short, satisfied chuffs of air glid across the boy’s scalp as his shivering face dipped down between her breasts, giving him an up-close look at her hefty mammaries. Wendy’s skin was so soft, a lush cushion of chub making her tits feel like marshmallow against his face, at least on the surface. Her whole body looked so silky and soft but buried just below, she felt solid, deceptively powerful even. Wendy was able to easily keep Aaron immobilized as her arms wrapped around him and reeled him in closer, burying his face right in between her cleavage.<br />
<br />
“Missed you little guy…” She cooed, the first few syllables gurgling in her throat like an out-of-practice mockingbird trying to imitate human speech before it all suddenly clicked in at the last word. By the end, she sounded just like he remembered, just like she did back when they were together all the time.<br />
<br />
Aaron had to be dreaming. It was no different than a dream where he was caught out in public with his pants down, his cheeks now plunged in between her breasts. His skin anxiously jittered against hers as he tried fruitlessly to resist, a choppy breath from his nose imbibing against her moist, slightly sweaty skin, enough to taste her scent on his tongue.<br />
<br />
Something deep inside his reeling mind confirmed it. She smelled like Wendy did, but at the same time nothing at all like she used to. That sweet flavor of femininity had turned into a harsh, overbearing au natural perfume, not just sweet, but tangy, a complex of acrid, savory bitters burying the smell of the older sister he used to know… or was it enhancing it? <br />
<br />
He’d never been this close to her before, was this her true scent? His senses could have changed since he had gotten older. Why was she even doing this?<br />
<br />
Aaron pressed into the hug instead of resisting it, feeling her heartbeat back when he used to lay on the couch with her and watch cartoons. Tingling warmth swept through him, an unsure erection furrowing his jeans as he took in deeper huffs of her.<br />
<br />
Yeah. She smelled like Wendy, but Wendy as a woman, as Wendy as a lover… Wendy as an… animal…?<br />
<br />
As the thought burst into the boy’s mind the sound of the vacuum cleaner cut off. Aaron felt something ominous behind him, the thirteen-year-old boy turning to see his mother’s mortified expression as Wendy smiled obliviously at her, trying to invite her brother back into her embrace.</p>
