<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br>Brad bit down quickly on Deck's neck, moving as fast as a bolt of lightning, piercing Deck's flesh like a freshly sharpened scalpel. Deck yelled out in pain, but it wasn't intended to be for help, and even if it was it would have been useless since everyone else was at the party. Letting go of Deck's neck was somewhat of a challenge for Brad, since he hadn't tasted fresh, raw, bloodied meat in a while, but he did not want to kill his new found lover either. Once Brad released, Deck looked at him and was slightly shocked. Brad's entire maw was covered in blood, his teeth were dripping with a mix of blood and copious amounts of saliva. Brad smiled and Deck wanted to cover the wound, but when he placed his hand on this neck, the wound wasn't even there!</br>
<br>"Dude! Isn't there another, less painful way to give the werewolf gene to people... and another thing, you just bit me but there is no open wound... what is going on?"</br>
<br>"I know it sucks Deck, but there just isn't to ensure your complete transformation. We could have fucked and let you had my cum in you both ways, but that is never a guarantee of the spread, as well as as sore ass. I know you like'em big, but if I put my cock in your ass, you would be ripped open and bleeding as well as extremely sore. This way, my saliva enters your bloodstream directly, the saliva also holds the transmission gene. Instantly upon biting and releasing, the saliva goes to work repairing the tissue like new and then goes to work on the rest of the infected person's system. I don't want you to think what I have is a virus, but it is foreign to your body and it will react as such. Although, your body has no chance of winning because the first think to be attacked is the Hemoglobin and then the white blood cells, which go to town everywhere else."</br>
<br>"So what exactly is going to happen to me?"</br>
<br>"I don't know, I haven't bit another human before, but I have been told that it is different for everyone infected. You will either suffer from severe heat and pain, to no pain at all along with unimaginable pleasure!"</br>
<br>"Should I do anything right now?"</br>
<br>"Yes and no, it depends on you. I would recommend you to take off all your clothes pretty quick because you should start to feel something momentarily, as it only takes ten minutes for the infection to spread completely, all the way down to your double-helix DNA chain. You might feel pain, so you wont want your clothes to bind or rip. You might even feel pleasure and want to be naked with me. Whatever you do, it is your choice as I said once before."</br>
<br>Deck smiled, being extremely attracted to Brad, but felt sheepish because he didn't want Brad to see his current physique. Once he thought about it though, Deck began to take off his clothes, feeling a bit horny and knew that Brad would just get a before and after look this way. Yet as Deck removed his cloths, he began to feel even more horny, wanting to jack his cock off, but still feeling slightly sheepish about doin' it in front of Brad. Brad just looked on with intent eyes, knowing that Deck's transformation wasn't going to be painful as it was already pleasurable. Deck, out of lust, forcibly grabbed his cock which was already somewhat hard and began stroking. Precum begins leaking in copious amounts and lubricating the strokes, making them even more pleasurable. Deck stopped for a moment as a lustful thought comes into his mind, wanting to keep all his cum for his new mate. As Deck stands there, changes become apparent on his body, his whole body became slightly thicker, broader and meatier, all the way from his fingers, to his cock and balls, down to his toes. His body became covered in a thick, but minimal coating of his own hair. Brad walked over to the bed, sitting down carefully to ensure he didn't damage his tail, while watching the show that was slowly progressing.</br>
<br>Brad smiled as he sat down and Deck smiled back, which revealed his mouth had followed with the rest of his body. Deck's tongue was a bit thicker in width while being slightly flatter like Brad's tongue. Deck's teeth grew sharper already, slightly thicker and his bicuspids or k-9's were looking more like fangs already! Deck continued to smile, not even realizing that his face had begun to push forward, while his forehead slanted, his brow changed and his nose followed his newly forming mouth. His ears moved to the top of his head, lengthening and forming into a point. The hair on the top of his head remained human in appearance, while the rest that sprouted slowly became thicker, becoming his dark brown wolven pelt. Deck looked down his body, his eyes rolling in the back of his head, feeling more pleasure than he could have ever imagined. His cock was dripping precum, creating a pool on the wooden floor, and to Brad it looked like a faucet had been turned on slightly so his "stuff" could flow freely but slowly. Deck' hands and fingers changed even more, forming thick black pads on his palms, the fingers became slightly less independent from another along with the opposable thumb losing a slight bit of it's freedom. His fingernails darkened and lengthened simultaneously, becoming darker as it lengthened and curled. Brad even noticed that Deck's feet had change while his hands did. Deck growled as the pleasure moved from the whole of his body, down to his cock, balls and ass. Without warning there was a <i>pop</i> and his wolven tail jutted out from the base of his tail-bone. Skin and fur followed along while the bone grew out rapidly, becoming his furry and wolven tail. The last to change was Deck's cock and balls as it was the simplest part for the genes to manipulate. Lupin's kept the look, shape and feel of the human cock, but swelled with more blood than a human, was more sensitive than one, and could produce at a moment's notice... unlike a human that may have to wait. As the pleasure culminated in his body, Deck arched his body back, tilted his head up and howled while spurting several thick ropes of cum from his cock, landing on Brad's black furred chest.</br>
<br>Brad and Deck smiled at each other, happy with the turn-of-events. Brad sprung to his feet, held Deck in a warm and loving embrace and locked wolven maw with wolven maw in a passionate lover's kiss. As they broke off, they did so slowly and gazed into each other's eyes. Deck wanted to say something, but found himself caught in the moment and was without a word to describe how he felt at that moment. Brad chuckled, placing a clawed finger on Deck's Lupin lips.</br>
<br>"Shhh... my lover. There is no need to speak because I feel as you do! After the first time we make love, our bond as mates will be sealed, our thoughts and emotions will be linked together. No words toward our feelings would ever need to be uttered as we would feel it between each other. Now my mate... what shall we do?"</br></p>
