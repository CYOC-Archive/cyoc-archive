<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As soon as Sally had gone Connie began chewing through the string tied to her and Dili. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come on. We're leaving.&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
Dili just trotted about in the mud looking around, &quot;but... I'm not sure we should. Its nice and simple in <br />
here. Lots of yummy food for free and jumping about in the squishy mud is pretty fun. Sally and Bo Peep <br />
promised to play with us and stuff too so we won't get bored.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? How can you consider staying here in a pig pen for the rest of your days? Your a brave paladin aren't <br />
you? A gear-knight?&quot; squealed Connie in shock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah but I'm also a gnome and gnomes love fun. I can't think of anything more fun than playing in the mud all <br />
day and playing fetch with Sally. Being turned into a pig is pretty funny too. As a knight I had to do loads <br />
of scary quests just to earn enough for food. Here my meals are free! If we try to escape we might end up on a <br />
plate!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I'm not staying in this stinkhole another second longer than I have to and I'd like you to come with <br />
me. I don't think I can find help on my own. If you want to come back here after and wallow in filth then be <br />
my guest. But for now, please won't you help me?&quot; Connie begged and snorted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay. As a paladin it's my job to help the needy and I don't want you to get hurt because I wasn't there.&quot; <br />
Dili agreed.<br />
<br />
Soon they had dug under the fence again and Dili  began shoving the chubbier Connie bottom, through the hole, <br />
with her nose before squeezing through herself.<br />
<br />
Dili sniffed at the air &quot;I can smell the fishmongers! The town must be this way!&quot; she squealed and led Connie <br />
away towards town. <br />
<br />
Soon after Sally and Bo Peep discovered them missing and fearing Morgana's wrath decided to go to town and get <br />
some friends to help look for the wayward piglets.<br />
<br />
It took Connie and Dili a while to trot their way to town on their stumpy little legs but they arrived <br />
eventually yet somehow Sally and Bo Peep had arrived first. The couple of pigs spied their jailers talking to <br />
another couple of equally giant ladies. At ones feet sat 4 poodles of varying colors. She wore nothing but <br />
black leather lingerie. The other, a red haired beauty, stood nearly naked save for a long scarf around her <br />
neck that stratgically covered her bosoms and privates. At her side she carried a silver flute. They were <br />
doubtless more of Morgana's transformees. No self respecting townwomen would go out dressed like these two <br />
harlots. <br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like they're after us.&quot; Connie whispered as best as her piggy voice could manage. &quot;We'll have to be <br />
extra careful. We'll go to fathers place and see if Princess Sara can help us. If not we'll have to find one <br />
of fathers associates, Madame Majique, and ask her to change us back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This feels like a proper adventure now we're being chased!&quot; Dili giggled amused.<br />
<br />
They snuck through alleyways, stopping to poop often. Their baby piglet bellies were clearly all that big and <br />
when they got hungry they had to rummage through trash outside the market stores and nibble on discarded fruit <br />
that also didn't sit well and so they had to let out the little squirts often. It wasn't long until nightfall <br />
and they were forced to snuggle together in an overturned trashcan. Dili found it all exciting but it Connie <br />
felt it was far from the epic adventure Dili was making it out to be. No, they were more like scurrying vermin <br />
than the heroes of some legend or folktale. <br />
<br />
They carried on their journey the next day. It seemed that the short journey from the farm to the disused bank <br />
the King had used as a palace was much longer when you were a tiny piglet. As they were nearing the bank they <br />
ran into trouble. As they were stopping to drink water from the gutter a pink poodle came up the alley behind <br />
them sniffing at the mess they'd made earlier.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no!&quot; cried Dili, &quot;One of that ladies poodles has been following our... droppings... like a trail. We've <br />
led them right too us!&quot;<br />
&quot;I told you not to keep stopping to poop!&quot; Connie scolded<br />
&quot;You were pooping more than me! You shouldn't have ate so much fatty.&quot;<br />
&quot;I'm only a bit bigger than you!&quot;<br />
<br />
The poodle came closer while sniffing the air and realizing that the smell it had been tracking was emanating <br />
from the piggy bottoms ahead of it. The little dog started yapping and running in a circle. Soon the other <br />
poodles and their owner would be here.<br />
<br />
&quot;We have to run to the bank now!&quot; Connie half screamed, half squealed and the piglets began running. The <br />
poodle took a few seconds to realize the piglets she'd been looking for had escaped into the high street as <br />
she'd been yapping to call the others but gave chase a moment later. By then the piglets had disappeared into <br />
the crowd who were setting up a number of market stalls and other things. The piglets didn't notice how <br />
unusually busy it was today as they dodged between the towering peoples legs. An apple dropped to the floor <br />
ahead of Connie and the constantly hungry little piggy picked it up in her and carried on. &quot;Score!&quot; she <br />
thought as the child that dropped it started shouting at the little piggy thief that had stolen his apple and <br />
gave chase as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oi that's mine you little runt!&quot; the boy shouted.<br />
<br />
Connie and Dili snuck around the back of the bank and dove into Connies pet cats cat-flap and the boy ran <br />
straight into the backdoor quickly followed by a confused poodle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow! That was close.&quot; Dili squealed excitedly, &quot;Yum! Where'd you get that apple.&quot;<br />
Connie dropped the apple between them saying &quot;Quiet! You don't want Morgana finding us now do you?&quot;<br />
&quot;Sorry! ...Can I have some of that apple?&quot;<br />
&quot;Go on then.&quot;<br />
<br />
The piglets quickly chomped their way through the apple not realizing they were being watched. Their stalker <br />
licked her lips in anticipation, biding her time for the best moment to grab the piggies. When their bellies <br />
were full, they'd be tired and too heavy to run! Yes. Soon. The apple soon devoured and the stalker struck, <br />
leaping out from the shadows to land on Dili and pin her!<br />
<br />
&quot;No! Bad Mittens!&quot; squealed Connie to her pet cat which wouldn't have listened if she did recognize her <br />
master. &quot;Stop it you bad cat!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dili was squealing loudly in fear and made a mess on the floor. Not wanting Dili to get hurt anymore, Connie <br />
had to attack the bigger cat and quickly leapt forward to bite its tail.<br />
<br />
&quot;MEOW!&quot; Mittens shrieked and clawed at Connie's face before running out the cat flap only to be chased by the <br />
waiting poodle outside who confused it for her prey. That particular poodle had been quite dumb even before <br />
Morgana had transformed it from a man along with the others several days before and seemed to have gotten even <br />
dumber. <br />
<br />
Connie and Dili got away with just a few scratches and counted themselves very lucky that the noise hadn't <br />
attracted Morgana or her followers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry. Its all my fault! I forgot about Mittens,&quot; said Connie as she licked the scratches on Dili's back.<br />
&quot;It's okay. It was scary but adventures usually are! I never thought I'd be attacked by a house cat though!&quot; <br />
Dili laughed, <br />
&quot;The other paladins used to joke that a house cat could kill a commoner or peasant and now I believe them!&quot; <br />
Dili laughed again and licked the scratch on Connie's piggy snout.<br />
&quot;Haha yeah I believe it now too... Lets go look in the throne room for Sara and Maedel. I really want to get <br />
changed back now. Everything is so big and scary...&quot;<br />
<br />
The piglets continued sneaking through the kitchen and soon found their way into the throne room but what they <br />
saw surprised them. There were now three Jesters rather than the one they had seen earlier and they sat around <br />
a table playing with their food...<br />
<br />
&quot;Where's Sara and Maedel?&quot; Connie asked.<br />
&quot;I think that might be them.&quot; whispered Dili &quot;Yes, that one looks kind of like Sara.&quot;<br />
Connie looked and sniffed at the blue and yellow jester who sat shovelling beans in her mouth until her cheeks <br />
puffed out cartoonishly like a frog. She gulped them down and let out a tremendous fart.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pee-yew! She smells as bad as you do!&quot; Connie squeaked, &quot;Its hard to believe that's the Princess but I guess <br />
if she's under a similar spell as Queen Rachel it probably is!&quot;<br />
&quot;If your father and the Queen got married, doesn't that make you step-sisters now?&quot; Dili mused absent <br />
mindedly.<br />
<br />
The piglets trotted over to the jesters and squealed to get their attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh what a surprise. A couple of piglets have escaped from the stys!&quot; said the Jester Sara<br />
&quot;It's me, Princess Connie! and Dili too. You've gotta help us change back, Sara! Please?&quot;<br />
&quot;I'm not Sara any more. Call me Stinky the Jester, only Morgana can change you back but I wouldn't pest her!&quot;<br />
<br />
Another voice joined Stinky's, this one much higher, &quot;Let me see you buffoon!&quot;<br />
Stinky moved her hand to reveal a hand puppet likeness of Princess Sara, complete with her iconic blue dress <br />
and tiara. &quot;Oh Connie, it really is you! I pleaded with Morgana but she wouldn't change you back! And just <br />
look at what she's done to me and Maedel!&quot;<br />
<br />
Connie listened and watched the puppet Sara motion to where Queen Rachel, now Queeny the clown, sat unable to <br />
tell if the puppet really spoke or it was just that the jester Sara was a skilled ventriloquist. On Queeny's <br />
lap sat a wooden marionette that had a faint resemblance to Maedel.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn't let Morgana catch you, Connie. She's been even crazier since she became Queen or Empress or <br />
whatever she's declaring herself today.&quot; said Maedel the Marionette.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I'm not going to spend the rest of my days as a stinking hog!&quot; Connie declared.<br />
&quot;Being smelly isn't so bad...&quot; Stinky began before Sara told her &quot;Shut it!&quot;<br />
&quot;Sara, since father and your mother married it's both our Kingdoms at stake here. In fact, they are the same <br />
Kingdom now! You've got to keep fighting her so you or your brother can take over as heir... you're both older <br />
than me after-all and wiser... usually.&quot; Connie snorted as she stared at the jester. &quot;I won't stand in your <br />
way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll try but it's difficult when my body is, you know.&quot; the hand puppet Princess said disheartened. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay. Well me and Dili will try to find another way to change back in the mean time but I promise I'll come <br />
back for you!&quot;</p>
