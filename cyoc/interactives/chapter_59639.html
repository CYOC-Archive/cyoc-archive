<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>As Johnny was leaving the showers he literally ran into one of Jennifer's friends named Ariel Murphy. She had long fiery red hair and 
brilliant green eyes looking out of an oval face. She had nice c cup breasts that were perky enough to not need a bra to hold them up. 
Her ass was a small teardrop shape with nice shapely legs. Johnny grinned as his dick immediately sprang to attention. Before she 
could react he grabbed her and spun her around so her back was to him. He leaned in close to her ear and whispered, "It's your lucky 
day Ariel. Today is the day you get deflowered."</p>
<p>"Let me go you perv," Ariel said squirming to get away.</p>
<p><I>"Don't do this to her,"</I> Jen said trying to get some control over her body. <I>"She doesn't deserve to be raped."</I></p>
<p>"Oh you're going to love this," Johnny said talking to both Ariel and Jen. As Ariel continued to squirm Johnny reached a hand down 
to part her lips. He lifted her up and guided his dick into her pussy thrusting it into her. She let out a tiny scream then began moaning as 
he pumped in and out hitting her g spot with each stroke. He was also massaging around that area with his hand occasionally reaching 
down to play with her clit. He quickly had her shuddering in ecstasy and would have her cumming in no time.</p>
<p>Jen's mind was being overloaded by the new sensation of a dick in a girl's pussy. She had never imagined that this is what a guy 
felt during sex. <I>"No wonder guys want sex so much,"</I> she said then moaned. Johnny smiled and continued pounding Ariel.</p>
<p>"Jennifer, Ariel, what are you two doing?" Coach Williams asked looking pretty angry.</p>
<p>"Just having a little sex," Johnny said as Ariel shuddered in the throws of orgasm.</p>
<p>"I can see that," Coach Williams said with a frown. "You both know the rules. Get dressed and report to the principal's office."</p>
<p>"I'm not done yet though," Johnny complained.</p>
<p>Coach Williams brought out a small perfume bottle and sprayed it toward Johnny's face. Getting a good whiff of it he sneezed and 
immediately began to pump faster trying to finish before he no longer had control over the body. His body shrank down some while his 
hair grew out and changed back to golden brown. Breasts began to form on his chest and swell pressing into Ariel's back. He stopped 
and shuddered in orgasm as his hands became more feminine. At this point Jennifer was able to take over and backed away from Ariel. 
Ariel went down on her hands and knees panting and shaking from being raped while Jen looked on as Johnny's dick shrank down until 
it was her own clit again. She felt her lips, vagina, and womb reform with relief. The hair that had grown on her body during the 
transformation into Johnny disappeared leaving Jen's neatly trimmed snatch. Finally the transformation finished and Coach Williams 
said, "Now both of you get dressed and report to the principal's office." Jen opened her mouth to protest but Coach Williams cut her off 
saying, "I don't care if you were horny. You know there's no sex in school and we can't make exceptions for you because of your 
condition. Now get dressed and report to the principal's office. If you continue to stand there and argue it will be worse for you. Now 
GO!"</p>
<p>Jen knew better than to argue with Coach Williams when she used that tone so she helped Ariel up and over to her locker. By the 
time they got there Ariel was able to stand by herself so Jen left her to dress and went to her own locker. She couldn't stand to put on 
the undies she had been wearing when she had transformed. Fortunately she always carried a spare pair just incase she started her 
period during school. A few minutes later she and Ariel were in Mr. Adkins' office. He looked at both of them and shook his head saying, 
"Having sex in school. You both knew the rules and what would happen if you broke them."</p>
<p>"Don't suspend Ariel Mr. Adkins," Jen suddenly said interrupting him. "She didn't do anything wrong. I raped her." She hated to say 
that since it was Johnny that had raped Ariel but she didn't want a friend getting in trouble.</p>
<p>Mr. Adkins looked at Ariel and asked, "Is this true?"</p>
<p>"No," Ariel said stunning Jen, "I wanted to have sex with her."</p>
<p>"I see," Mr. Adkins said. After a moment he continued with, "Well I know that you wouldn't lie about something as serious as rape 
Ariel so I'm giving both of you two months suspension. You will not be anywhere on school grounds or at school events. If you are found 
on school grounds or at school events the next step will be expulsion. As you know being suspended automatically disqualifies you from 
extracurricular activities. Ms. Smith, I expect you to wash that uniform tonight and have one of your parents drop it off tomorrow. Ms. 
Murphy, if you have your jacket and shorts here and washed then I expect you to return them before you leave. If not then I expect one 
of your parents to drop them off tomorrow. Of course you can keep the swimsuit you were issued due to hygienic reasons. Now do you 
both have a way home?"</p>
<p>"I got a ride this morning," Jen said looking down. She didn't want to call her mom or dad and have them pick her up. She wanted to 
put off telling them about her suspension for as long as possible.</p>
<p>"I drove this morning so I can give you a ride home Jen," Ariel said.</p>
<p>"Good now take these notes home to your parents," Mr. Adkins said handing each of them a piece of paper. "We will be calling to 
confirm that they received them so don't try to hide them. You may go now."</p>
<p>Jen was seething with anger as she and Ariel were walking to Ariel's car a few minutes later. "I'm going to kill that little pipsqueak 
Kyle Perkins for this," she said through gritted teeth. "He ruined my life and you got dragged into it."</p>
<p>"You mean the freshman we pantsed last week?" Ariel asked. When Jen nodded she continued, "But I don't see how he could have 
ruined your life unless..." A look of comprehension crossed her face and she asked, "He asked you 'Transform or dare?' didn't he?"</p>
<p>Jen's face took on a look of confusion as she said, "Kyle said you wouldn't know what to think about my changing back and 
forth."</p>
<p>"Well if I only had to go on you switching back and forth I wouldn't have known what to think," Ariel said getting in her car.</p>
<p>As Jen got in she asked, "So you believe in the town curse?"</p>
<p>"Well I kind of have to believe having been transformed a couple months ago," Ariel said starting her car and driving away from 
school.</p>
<p>"How were you transformed?"</p>
<p>"Well before I came to Glendale I was a thirty-seven year old guy," Ariel said with a little shrug. "I don't want to go into it since I'm 
happy with my life now. Of course I'm not too happy about being kicked off the swim team but it can't be helped. You know that if I 
hadn't said I had wanted sex with you you would have gone to jail for rape."</p>
<p>"I didn't think of that," Jen said shuddering. "Thank you."</p>
<p>"That's what friends are for," Ariel said giving Jen a little smile. "Now about Kyle I have a few ideas on how to get him back but first 
we need to get you changed back. Did Kyle say anything about the transform being permanent? Think carefully as something like the 
transformation being unable to be undone would pretty much make it permanent."</p>
<p>Jen thought for a few seconds then said, "There was nothing that would indicate that it would be permanent."</p>
<p>"Good. Now ask me the question and give me a simple dare so it transfers to me. Unless of course you already passed it on."</p>
<p>"I didn't pass it on. Ariel, transform or dare?"</p>
<p>"Dare."</p>
<p>Jen had to think for a few seconds before saying, "I dare you to say you love Kyle Perkins."</p>
<p>"I love Kyle Perkins," Ariel said then shot Jen a look. "That wasn't real nice."</p>
<p>Jen shrugged and said, "Well you said to keep it simple and it was a way for me to test if I really did have the power. Now could you 
please change me back?"</p>
<p>"Jen, transform or dare?"</p>
<p>"Transform."</p>
<p>"Ok for your transformation you will transform into the person you were before Kyle Perkins transformed you except you will retain 
your memories and knowledge you gained between that time and now."</p>
<p><I>"Noooo!"</I> Johnny screamed as he disappeared from Jen's being.</p>
<p>Jen smiled and said, "I think it worked. Johnny's gone." She looked at the note and sighed saying, "We're still suspended."</p>
<p>"Well there's not much fun getting back at someone if you have no reason," Ariel said with a shrug.</p>
<p>"So what ideas do you have for getting back at Kyle?"</p>
<p>They discussed what to do with Kyle all the way to Jen's house.</p></p>
