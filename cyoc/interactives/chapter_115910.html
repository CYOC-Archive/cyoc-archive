<br />
As Mayor Pro Tem Samantha Twist started to walk off the stage at the Moon Lake Labor Day Picnic, the house band from The Were Club came on.<br />
But before they could even introduce themselves and start their first number to entertain the crowd, the band was interrupted by a woman from the opposite side of the stage rushing out and grabbing the microphone before the group&#39;s lead singer could strum her guitar.<br />
&quot;Hello everybody. For those who don&#39;t know me, my name is Kenya Adaeze-Crawford,&quot; began the stranger, dressed in an outfit that looked more like it should be worn at a fancy evening gala than a picnic. &quot;Now while Mayor Twist has done relatively okay in the short time she&#39;s been in office, let&#39;s not forget that she was part of Mayor Stovall&#39;s administration and... Geez, where IS Mayor Stovall now?&quot; Kenya asked rhetorically, considering everyone knew that he resigned following his daughter&#39;s trial before the Elders&#39; Council for violating Statute 1-A.*<br />
<br />
Backstage, Ben Twist and his mother Frances had to restrain Samantha from going back on stage and challenging that statement, because they knew what was about to happen to the upstart.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway, I&#39;d like to formally announce my candidacy for Mayor of Moon Lake,&quot; continued Kenya. &quot;I was the head teller at the Moon Lake Savings and Loan until I married my wonderful husband Jack,&quot; she added, as Jack Crawford came out on stage, but didn&#39;t completely approach her as he waved to the crowd, &quot;and I think I&#39;d do a MUCH better job as Mayor than the previous administrations,&quot; she said with a smile.<br />
&quot;Excuse me, ma&#39;am. Ella Alyn**, <i>Moon Lake Gazette</i>,&quot; began the newspaper reporter, as she worked her way forward toward the stage. &quot;Exactly what are your qualifications to be considered as a mayoral candidate?&quot;<br />
&quot;Besides working in such an administrative and financially responsible position for years, I&#39;ve lived in Moon Lake for a mighty long time and know this town inside and out,&quot; replied Kenya, while making a W with the fingers of both hands to silently indicate she was a fellow were.<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; said Ella, writing that response down dutifully. &quot;And does that also include your skills as a high price escort of the evening?&quot;<br />
&quot;WHAT?&quot; asked Kenya, flabbergasted that such a question was asked.<br />
&quot;You&#39;re also known as Kendra Smythe, a... shall we say <i>lady of the evening,</i> whose services are both not only in high demand, but rate a huge fee as well, hence only rich men like your husband were ever able to afford your services,&quot; announced Ella.<br />
&quot;Now wait a minute...&quot; began Kenya, as her husband came rushing forward.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll sue you and your newspaper for libel and slander!&quot; Jack shouted.<br />
&quot;That&#39;s only possible if I was lying, but I do have the proof,&quot; said Ella confidently, as suddenly the background image of the stage changed from a pastel color to a photo of Jack and Kenya at a formal event.<br />
&quot;Mister Jack Crawford, or do you prefer to be called Jack Ashford?&quot; asked Ella, pointing at the stage.<br />
<br />
The Crawfords turned around to look at what the reporter was pointing to as Ella continued speaking.<br />
&quot;That is a photo of the two of you attending a charity event last year here in Moon Lake last year, only you registered attending as Kendra Smythe and Jack Ashford. The same Jack Ashford who has been behind the scenes doing everything he can to slow down construction of the new elementary school here in town, while you have allegedly been supportive of the project as Crawford. Care to elaborate as to why you would do such a thing when the town needs that new school?&quot;<br />
Kenya leaned her head against her husband&#39;s shoulders and began to cry as Crawford said, &quot;I have absolutely no idea what you&#39;re talking about.&quot;<br />
&quot;Is your hatred of Benton Knight over past business dealings so great that you would do anything to ruin him, no matter who else was hurt in the process?&quot; asked Ella, standing her ground.<br />
<br />
Backstage Lance Knight, owner of the <i>Gazette</i> as part of Knight Media, and younger brother of Benton, thought that last remark might be a little too close to home, but trusted his ace reporter to be fair and balanced, because those words actually meant something to Ella.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you know the full history between myself and Benton Knight, then you wouldn&#39;t need to ask that question,&quot; replied Crawford, as his wife sobbed: &quot;Honey, I thought you said once I was mayor we could ruin the Knights and do whatever we wanted to with the town and Nate Anderson.&quot;<br />
&quot;And what do you have planned for Moon Lake? Let alone, why would you want to ruin a young man who&#39;s about to start his senior year of high school tomorrow?&quot; Ella demanded to know. &quot;Could it be because he was the only one who ever showed you genuine affection but then dumped you because you could never give up being a professional prostitute?&quot;<br />
<br />
Backstage, from the side that the Crawfords had occupied, disgraced former Town Councilman and campaign manager for Kenya Adaeze-Crawford  Arnold Steward Stevenson hastily tossed the campaign button that he was going to pin on his lapel after the announcement was made in the trash and started leaving the park as fast as he could.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honey,&quot; said Kenya, reaching out to grab Crawford&#39;s crotch, &quot;I&#39;m getting close to needing a good fuck again,&quot; referring to her ever growing heat cycle, &quot;but first I&#39;m going to fuck that bitch for fucking with us!&quot; as Kenya leaped from the stage, barely remembering not to change into her werepanthress form because of the Code W*** in progress.<br />
Ella waited until Kenya was committed to her leap, then at the last moment dropped her notepad and pen to bunch her hands together into one big fist and hit Mrs. Crawford in the jaw as hard as she could.<br />
Kenya, caught by surprise, crumpled to the ground at Ella&#39;s feet.<br />
&quot;Wow. A glass jaw. Who knew?&quot; commented Ella, as she bent down to pick up her notepad and pen.<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t bother getting up Mrs. Crawford, or whatever you care to call yourself,&quot; said Ella, as Kenya started to moan. &quot;My husband is both ex-military and a member in good standing with the Moon Lake Sheriff&#39;s department, so I know how to defend myself. Unless you have any further comments, I have no additional questions.&quot;<br />
Kenya just looked up at Ella and moaned again.<br />
&quot;In that case, you two can read my detailed expose on your shenanigans on the front page of tomorrow&#39;s <i>Gazette</i>. Enjoy the rest of the picnic,&quot; Ella said with a smile.<br />
With that she turned and began to walk away as the crowd started to cheer her actions.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re doing no such thing!&quot; yelled Jack Crawford, hopping down off the stage toward his wife.<br />
As Jack bent down and started to pick Kenya up, he was surprised to see a pair of silk sandals in his line of sight. He looked up and saw none other than Tachibana no Akane standing in front of him.<br />
&quot;Mister Crawford. Mrs. Crawford,&quot; said Akane, bowing politely to the now disgraced couple. &quot;These are for you,&quot; she added, handing each of them a wax sealed scroll. &quot;You are both to appear before the Elders&#39; Council at 10 am tomorrow morning to stand trial for your actions against Moon Lake, past and present.&quot;<br />
Without another word, Akane bowed again and left the scene.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE, behind a concession stand where they had watched everything in private, Benton Knight turned and hugged his wife Amanda.<br />
&quot;This has been one of the best days of my life!&quot; he told her, happily.<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; asked his wife, having enjoyed the moment and seeing the Crawfords get their comeuppance.<br />
&quot;After any milestone involving you and Frieda, of course,&quot; replied Benton, referring to their daughter while kissing her. &quot;Come on. Let&#39;s go enjoy the picnic some, and then maybe we&#39;ll go home early for some afternoon delight,&quot; he said with a smile.<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think anyone&#39;s used that term since the 1970s dear,&quot; pointed out Amanda. &quot;It&#39;s great to see you so happy, but why wait till this afternoon?&quot; she asked with a sly wink, before giving him another kiss.<br />
<br />
And on stage, now finally able to start playing, instead of whatever they had originally scheduled for their first number, the house band from The Were Club started playing &#9835;Happy Days Are Here Again&#9835;.<br />
