<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>Nicole strained to reach the dice, only to discover once again that she could not move them.  "Fuck," she swore.</p>

<p>James chuckled.  "Yeah, I imagine we have to," but the instant the words left his mouth, he realized the truth.  "The card's curse, how did it end?  Do you remember?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said softly.  "Each time anew select.  I have to have sex with someone different every time or I can't roll.  But ... we're still tied."  She tried again to free herself from James's knot, but to no avail.  She would hurt herself far too badly before she could force herself free.  "And there aren't many options, either."</p>

<p>Joanna showed some signs of movement, but was certainly not conscious yet.  Alicia had been changed into a sheep to slake Daniel's bestial lust.  Daniel...</p>

<p>"Daniel!" James called out.  "You're the only other person here who can help.  If Nicole can't fulfill this curse, she can't roll, and that means she loses.  Please!"</p>

<p>Daniel lifted hir head and looked about.  He was right, they were counting on hir. Hie might have let down Alicia, but hie couldn't leave Nicole a fox-woman forever.  Even if she did carry herself well that way.  "I wonder what sort of stuff counts," Daniel asked on the way across the room.</p>

<p>"The curse says I have to be 'laid'.  I'm pretty sure I'm going to need you ... in me, somewhere."  She shuddered a bit at the size of the instrument in question at it approached.  "Maybe ... I don't think sucking you off is enough to count, Daniel."  There was fear in her voice.  "Lean back," she whispered to James, whose wide eyes and distrusting expression made his opinion on this plan clear.  "I'm a big fox ... girl.  I can handle this.  Trust me."</p>

<p>The tied pair tipped back.  James eventually managed to work his feet out from under him, so that he was now on his back, the fox pressed down on top of him.  "Okay, Daniel.  This is the only way that we can do this, but ... go slow.  And for God's sake, don't try to press too far in."  She lifted her tail, and swished it about a bit, offering her tailhole to the massively endowment behind her.</p>

<p>Daniel pressed the tip of hir penis against the tight circle of the fox's tailhole.  Slowly, hie shifted slightly from side to side, working the powerful muscles open just a little bit ... then a little bit more.  "This isn't even my roll yet," she whispered.  "I don't know how much time we have.  Daniel, I'll be okay."  Daniel nodded and stepped forward, the motion putting increasing pressure against the unwilling opening, while Nicole did all that she could to relax the muscles and fulfill the curse.  Daniel was insistent, realizing the urgency of this union, while at the same time trying to make the experience as comfortable, maybe even as pleasurable, as hie could.  At last, the tip of the engorged shaft passed Nicole's ring and slid inside.  Daniel felt something firm against hir sensitive flesh as hie slipped the rest of the head inside.  Startled, hie realized what the firmness was - James's canine knot.  Both hie and the knot were large enough to press against each other through the walls between.  Nicole yipped and closed her eyes, as she felt the slow, steady motion of Daniel's manhood within her, filling her ass, and pressing against her boyfriend's love-knot.  It was too much, but as she felt James stiffen inside her, brought to arousal from the continued contact and the shifting motions of the threesome, her pleasure began to wash away the pain.  Daniel continued to work just the smallest faction of hirself within the fox, almost a foot away, while her still-human lover now pressed inside her with his own furtive motions.  She threw her head back, human moans and screams mixed with vulpine yipping.</p>

<p>When, finally, Daniel's hot seed shot through her, giving her a sensation of fullness and warmth unlike anything she had felt before, she collapsed down on top of James, nipping at his neck and shoulders, while continuing to work  his shaft with the firm muscles of her inner walls.  As Daniel eased back out of her tailhole, she stifled a cry - this <b>had</b> been too much for her, but she wished desperately to keep that a secret from her knot-bound lover.  She tossed the dice onto the board beside her without so much of a break from the rhythm.  She'd find out what this card did soon enough.</p>

<p><i>When everyone is different,<br>
your life can be quite lonely.<br>
Remove the changes another has,<br>
and grant them just yours only.</i></p>

<p>After a few minutes, just as Nicole was finishing letting her muscles milk James, the card she earned from landing on a yellow square flipped over, and Daniel read it aloud so the others would hear.  Nicole kissed James's lips and whispered thanks.  This time, at least, the cards had given her an easy choice.  She wouldn't let a friend be trapped as an animal - well, not as <u>just</u> an animal for any longer than she could help it.  "Be free, Alicia," she called out.</p>

<p>The sheep began to quiver.  Its wool began to fade away, until all that was left was fine coat of fur.  Hands regrew fingers, albeit not quite human ones.  And the ovine face was melted and molded until it was a very different sort of creature - one quite a bit like Nicole, and one which again had the fire of intelligence behind its eyes.  "What ... what happened?" Alicia asked, feeling out her new vulpine form.  "I remember Daniel pulling a card.  Something about a sheep?  But ... I'm a fox-woman now, like you.  Is everything okay?"</p>

<p>Daniel choked back tears of happiness.  She would never have to know.  As he went to embrace his new vixen, he offered an assurance, "Yes, my dear.  Everything is fine now.  Well ... as fine as it gets with the game still on, at any rate."</p></p>
