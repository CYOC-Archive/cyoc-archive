<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Vernon, known as Vern, was given the news he had prostate cancer earlier that day. Survival for the 74 year old was to be determined with an upcoming biopsy. Cancer made Vern angry because he had lost his wife 15 months earlier to another cancer. Vern had been mostly alone, except for the duck retriever dog breeding business he started when he retired as a banker. The magic shop looked like a good distraction from the day&#39;s bad news. Once inside, he strolled slowly up and down the aisles, and came across a rather large selection of dildos and butt plugs. The young nurse at his doctor&#39;s office suggested a prostate massager, or vibrating butt plug to help him work his prostate, she called it a &quot;home health aid&quot;. She said he would have increasing difficulty urinating unless he massaged his prostate. Vern like flirting with the young lady, she was kind to him. Vern left the aisle, only to return. Vern selected one that looked as if it would not be difficult to fit. The tag said, &quot;Canine, Large&quot;, looking like a very normal size red rocket from a Labrador retriever. Vern had a &quot;what the hell&quot; impulse, and went to the counter, paid for the dildo, let the attendant install the battery and show the instructions, and left. Vern&#39;s difficult urination is why he went to the doctor last week, but the test results came back today.<br />
<br />
The dildo sat on his kitchen table for several days, as urinating became increasingly difficult, as the nurse and doctor suggested. Vern would read the instructions from time to time, but parts did not make sense. Desperation sat in one morning, Vern was sitting on the commode, but nothing was coming out. Vern was in tears as he hobbled to the kitchen table to retrieve the dildo then returned to the bathroom. Vern put some petroleum jelly on the end of the dildo, then slowly pushed it into his rectum. Vern&#39;s pain was sharp and cutting, it hurt to relax and it hurt to push. Vern pushed the button on the dildo, as it slipped fully into his ass. Soon, the massager found it&#39;s resting place in Vern&#39;s ass, the vibrations now hammering his prostate. Vern cried out in pain, but that pain quickly abated, the sharp and cutting  pain from the urge to go also relented. Vern, now sweating, relaxed as the vibrations on his prostate were now quite pleasurable, and his cock slowly became erect. The prostate massage felt good, and Vern&#39;s first orgasm in a long time erupted inside him, nothing came out. The vibrations were too much for Vern. He could not reach the dildo, as it had slipped inside. Vern tried to stand up, but fell onto the floor, squirming and moaning from the relentless dildo. Vern&#39;s whole body was on fire, throbbing and out of his control. Vern lost consciousness, with his body spasming on the floor.<br />
<br />
Vern woke up hours later. The battery in the prostate massager had exhausted itself. Vern was a mess, as had emptied his bladder and prostate. Vern stood to clean himself off, and went to lay down on his bed. Vern felt a slight pleasant phantom vibration sensation just above his anus. Vern once again fell asleep and awoke the next morning. Vern woke up, and felt the canine dildo underneath him, no longer inside him. Vern stood up, grimaced at the canine dildo on the bed, then went to his bathroom were he noticed the mess he left from yesterday on his bathroom floor. Vern cleaned up his mess, and then sat down to urinate on the toilet. Vern was quite surprised that he had a steady stream, and no difficulty.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn,&quot; Vern thought to himself, &quot;...that nurse was right.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vern flushed and cleaned himself, feeling refreshed for the first time in weeks. That constant urge to pee that never would pass is gone. Vern then retrieved the dildo from his bed and cleaned it in his bathroom sink. Once clean, he opened it up, threw away the battery, and left it in two parts on the bathroom counter. Vern stepped into his overalls and went out to check on the dogs in the kennel. There was a lot of barking, since he missed the evening feeding. He reassured them as he gave them extra this morning to make up for it. Vern took his eldest male dog, Jake, back into the house. Vern cooked Jake two eggs every morning, and shared a strip of the bacon. A phone call from his doctor after breakfast gave Vern his biopsy appointment, five days from today. Vern spent the day with the dogs and their daily training and feeding program.<br />
<br />
Vern lasted two days before the difficulty returned. Vern put a battery in the canine dildo, put the petroleum jelly on the end, and slid it into his anus, again turning it on before it slipped entirely into him. Vern thought that perhaps this time he could avoid the sharp, cutting pain that never went away. Vern felt the discomfort and difficulty melt away as he stood at the toilet to urinate. Vern let out a soft moan of relief as he finished, and his cock hardened in his hand. Vern felt the need to massage his cock, and looked under the sink for some of his wife&#39;s lotion or hand creme to put on his calloused hand. Vern sat down in his shower chair, and used his lubricated hand to ride his building orgasm stroking his cock. This time, his orgasm took longer to build, but soon he was oozing a steady amount of semen and fluid. Soon he felt a powerful throb in his ass, and a sensation of being filled, his canine dildo knot had expanded, and continued to vibrate. The swelling of the knot served to magnify the vibrations on his prostate and Vern was breathing heavily now, his body&#39;s sex drive now pushed past his limit as he gasps in orgasmic pleasure. He slides down from the shower chair and onto the floor of the shower stall, his body shuddering in an orgasm that doesn&#39;t end. Vern&#39;s eyes become heavy, and falls asleep while still being kept in orgasm by the canine dildo in his ass.<br />
<br />
Vern felt the fullness was still inside him as he opened his eyes. The vibrations had stopped. Vern saw his cock was red, swollen, and sore from the lack of lotion in massaging his cock. Vern used the handrail, and got to his feet. Vern then closed the shower door and turned on the water, letting loose a good long urination stream. It felt....painless and effortless. Vern felt the dildo slowly deflate, as the fullness slowly went away. It only took a slight push for the dildo to slide out for Vern to grab it and clean it while in the shower. He never thought the device in his hands would allow him to do something simple as urinate without strain and pain.<br />
<br />
Vern lasted two more days and made it through the biopsy before the sharp pain returned the morning after. Vern had purchased a better lube at the drug store than years old hand lotion. Soon, Vern was in the shower, dildo vibrating inside, and milking his cock as it occasionally shot streams of semen onto the shower floor. Vern found that squeezing his anus and pushing as if he had to pee contributed to a stronger and longer lasting orgasm. Vern&#39;s cock was spent as he stood up, feeling the vibrations in his ass slow to a stop, but the fullness remained. Vern had to get out to the kennel&#39;s, so he finished his shower and went out for the morning feeding, then to bring Jake in for his eggs. Vern knew the knot should have already deflated by the time he gave the eggs to Jake, as that was over an hour. It was nearly two hours when Vern came back inside to review the instructions with Jake sleeping on the couch next to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Crap,&quot; Vern though to himself. He was not supposed to be around other dogs while using the dildo. Vern thought that since nothing happened, it didn&#39;t apply. Vern didn&#39;t notice the numbness in his cock for the last two hours since he went out to the kennels. Vern&#39;s hand found nothing between his legs but a scrotum with his balls, his cock was gone. The urge to go was strong, so Vern sat on the toilet and relaxed, feeling warm stream coming from under his balls. The instructions did apply, and he was cursing himself for not paying attention. Vern poked a finger under his balls and felt the wetness, then pushed further to his knuckle before pulling out. Vern cleaned himself and returned to study the instructions again. Two hours later, he felt the knot of the dildo shrink inside him, and he felt an emptiness in the pit of his stomach. Vern slipped off is overalls and returned to his shower,  to retrieve and clean the dildo. Vern didn&#39;t waste time after cleaning to then lube the dildo and slide it into his hairless canine vagina. Vern felt the smoothness of it all, noticing there as no trace of his balls or scrotum as the dildo slipped inside, but Vern waited to turn it on. Moments later, Vern was twitching as he frantically turned on the dildo, and pushed its entire length inside, before slowly lowering himself to the floor of the shower stall. Vern used his finger on his clit, rubbing it raw as he built to his first orgasm, with the popping of the knot in his pussy that sent him over the top of his first orgasm. It was wave, after building and crashing wave of orgasm. He tried pushing like he had to pee, and felt himself squeeze the swollen knot of the dildo. Vern is now breathing deeply and with difficulty, as his body throbs in orgasm. All Vern can do is try to push, as that is what the instructions said to do. The vibrations stop several minutes later, and a weak Vern just sits on his shower floor, too weak to move.</p>
