<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Calvin brought a grey hoodie and handed it over to Dave. He looked at it, unsure about the situation but Calvin's broad smile eased the situation so he thanked the man, who made sure to be around should Dave need anything more from him before leaving.<br />
<br />
Dave examined the clothes. The hoodie certainly didn't look like much. It was grey without a single word written on it. It looked bland so why would Calvin just give it to him? Another question was why was he even trying clothes? That damned Calvin. Sure he was extremely nice to him but the man probably just wanted to sell him something and nothing more. <br />
<br />
Anyway he shook those thoughts aside. As long as he was here he could check those clothes and who knows maybe buy them; he needed some warmer clothes after all and hoodies were usually comfortable. As he pulled the hoodie over his head he felt a weird sensation, like a small shock.<br />
<br />
He looked at himself on the mirror. Well, Calvin appeared to have made a mistake as the hoodie felt bad against his body. Dave wasn't sure why, though. It wasn't particularly large or small but it felt like it actually stung his flesh. Dave kept rubbing his torso, grunting as he did. Was it some sort of allergy? <br />
<br />
For a second Dave lost his balance and almost fell had he not bumped into a wall. Now his head started hurting. The boy remained still for a few seconds, remaining against the wall but slowly he rose on his feet. He shouted Calvin's name but there was no answer. Heck he couldn't ever hear anything anymore. It was like he was all alone in the building.<br />
<br />
His dizziness still affected his motor skills so he sat down, hoping for it to go away. He found that at least his torso didn't itch anymore. In his curiosity he put his hand into the collar to check his chest and figure out why it had been so itchy mere seconds ago. But as he did that he was surprised to find his fingers moving through hair. Hair on his chest? That didn't make sense; he barely had any body hair! However it indeed felt like hair but that was not his only surprize: he also found out that his chest felt better, more solid; like he was developing pecs.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's not right...&quot; Dave thought. He wasn't known for being athletic at all but he couldn't deny the thicker mass. Trying to confront the situation, Dave got up and he could feel a zap running through his head but he ignored it. Feeling a bit nervous of what he might find he revealed as much of his torso as he could. Hair had indeed grown over his chest and a dark treasure trail ran to his abdomen, which also looked leaner. Dave used to have a bit of a belly but now it  was gone, his abdomen was flat and despite the hair and remaining fat it was visible that his shy abs were starting to show up.<br />
<br />
His body hair looked black in contrast to... Dave looked puzzled at his own hair. It looked black. Wasn't it supposed to be brown? It also seemed shorter too. Dave was trying to rationalize all these strange events but another painful zap ran through him and once again he sat down. <br />
<br />
A sudden wave of acceptance calmed Dave. Perhaps he was overthinking. If the mirror showed him like that then it had to be true. He actually looked better than… before? Dave felt a little confused. Why did he think his body looked different? Still another zap hit him and this time his face started to itch. He scratched his face like crazy and as he looked at the mirror small hairs appeared over his face as he looked at his reflection. In just seconds his beard grew to the equivalent of weeks without shaving and it grew even more as Dave watched new hairs appearing in places where his immature beard could not claim. Beneath his skin his bones starting changing as well, changing his face. It became more angular, his nose became straight and his nostrils got smaller. He looked more mature and manly than before, not to mention attractive.<br />
<br />
Finally the itching and shocks stopped and Dave stood before the mirror. Dave could see that some black hair had also grown over his arms. <br />
<br />
He was confused at first. The mirror seemed to reflect someone else. There was an older man looking at him; about twenty-something. His face was no longer the one he had grown accustomed to. It looked like he had received a massive upgrade. He looked attractive, more beautiful than many men he had seen. He couldn't stop admiring himself and despite the whole mess he was starting to like what he saw. As he smiled his reflection showed him a white set of teeth. He found himself getting more confident just by looking at his own smile. But as he saw that bearded face and tried as many facial expressions as he could, Dave thought that his face became increasingly familiar and in no time he acknowledged that face as being his own.<br />
<br />
Another bizarre feeling swept over him but this time it was not shocking or painful. It felt like a warm breeze now. He could feel blank spots in his mind being filled with new information. He was 26 years old. He knew that to be true. Years of college and work came flooding his mind. He knew that he now worked at a small company, a fulfilling job that could provide well for him. Dave couldn't contest any of this new information, it was a part of him and he embraced these memories. More recollections came flooding his mind: getting his own house, his past girlfriends, holidays with family and friends... but why was he remembering all this stuff now? <br />
<br />
&quot;Calvin!&quot; Dave called with his deep voice. The man appeared almost immediately. &quot;Well, so what do you think?&quot; Asked the man with his open smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;I like it. It seems simple but somehow... I feel better with it. Strange, huh?&quot; Dave seemed immersed on his thoughts. &quot;But anyway I'll take it.&quot;<br />
<br />
“Wait, I still have some more articles you should see.” Dave agreed with Calvin’s suggestion and in no time the man presented him a pair of black trunks and a pair of brand new red sneakers.<br />
<br />
This time Calvin didn’t leave but Dave didn’t mind and he nodded at the quality of the clothes. He took off his shoes and without modesty he dropped his pants. The shorts fit him nice but the sneakers seemed slightly big. He was about to say something but Calvin anticipated him “They look great! Are they comfortable?”<br />
<br />
Dave was about to complain about the shoes being too big but as he wriggled his toes he found out they actually fit him. Dave didn’t catch the difference but his feet had also grown as did his legs, which now sprouted darker hair. Hidden by his clothes his penis also grew larger, as did his testicles. The years of puberty had left him. Dave was now a man. “Yes, they are. All this stuff looks great, it is all I need for now. I’m ready to go. By the way do you mind if I leave wearing these?<br />
<br />
&quot;Not at all, that’s actually a very good sign that you enjoyed our products! But let’s go then, this way!&quot; Calvin said pointing at the front bench but as Dave walked past Calvin he said: &quot;Wait! You almost forgot this!&quot; <br />
<br />
Dave looked puzzled for a second but as he saw the man carrying a gym bag he shook his head &quot;Thank you, Calvin! How foolish of me!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;There is no need to thank me at all&quot; He chuckled and handed the bag to Dave. Calvin was still impressing with his tall 6'5 frame but that didn’t intimidate the slightly smaller Dave, who was 6’3. As they walked through the store Dave once again noticed the beauty of the staff that worked at the store. A regular Joe would probably feel self-conscious about being surrounded by so many attractive people but Dave was no regular Joe and if looks were a requirement to work at that shop then Dave could easily pass for someone working there.<br />
<br />
“So, are you going to a gym?” Calvin chattered. <br />
<br />
“Yes, I’ve recently joined one. A friend of mine suggested it to me.”<br />
<br />
“Really? You know if you could bring this friend of yours or anyone else here I could get you all a special discount in your future purchases.”<br />
<br />
“That is a great deal! Sure I’ll tell them about this place.” Dave said as he gave Calvin the money for his new clothes.<br />
<br />
“Thank you. As you know we have just recently opened and we’re trying to get more people here.”<br />
<br />
“Well you sure deserve it. I know this may be weird but this place has made me feel better. I can’t even explain why!”<br />
<br />
“It’s not that weird. I’ve heard others say that before! Well, here’s the change. Have a good afternoon!”<br />
<br />
“Thank you! Good afternoon to you too!” Waved Dave. Such nice people. He walked down the street in a joyful mood. “I’m so glad this store opened” he thought. He would make sure to tell his friends about it but in the meantime he headed towards the gym for a nice workout.</p>
