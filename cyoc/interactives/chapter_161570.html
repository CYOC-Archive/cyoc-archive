<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The day had largely gone fairly quietly for Tad and didn&#39;t have too much that went along with the things that he&#39;d been most aware of. He was glad to learn that Connor had opened up to his parents on the fact that he&#39;d been having questions on his sexuality. For from what Connor had told him and Ryan when he admitted things to them, it seemed to Tad that Connor was bi-sexual. How or why Connor hadn&#39;t &quot;known&quot; about this was a bit of a mystery to Tad, as he&#39;d never said anything disparaging about gays those who weren&#39;t straight, and at the same time, Tad had known the Ross family well enough that he didn&#39;t think that Connor&#39;s parents would reject him for that. And Connor ultimately confirmed what Tad thought about that when Connor told him about how telling his parents went.<br />
<br />
The other big thing was shadow of the reveal, and more the negative responses to it. Tad could understand the fear of being exposed. His parents had always advised him to be careful, particularly after he&#39;d had his first transformation. But because of his father&#39;s military service, Tad was also taught a lot about discipline maintaining rational thought. That was enough for Tad to see the logic in Tom Herald&#39;s arguments, that given some of the events that Moon Lake may have dodged too many bullets purely by luck and that couldn&#39;t last forever. And while some might still be afraid, that didn&#39;t justify picking fights.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thankfully all this hasn&#39;t scared off the Ross family,&quot; Tad thought to himself as he came out of the bathroom at the end of the day and found Amy waiting for him near the doors that lead out of the high school.<br />
<br />
For the Ross family were good people, and Connor had been his best friend in Virginia. Tad had volunteered to help with their welcome and let things go better for them when they first arrived, and to be a friend for Connor, and their taking Moon Lake&#39;s secret so well had made him hopeful. But the fight that had broken out on the way into school was a symptom of the fear that came from the reveal and ran the risk of putting weres in general in a bad light, that they were just as prone to overly emotional reactions that could have bad consequences. So far, that hadn&#39;t been the case, but then things at school had also been a bit tamer since the fight on Monday. People were still on edge, but things had stopped short of actual violence. Tad could only hope things continued to get better from there.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... you ready to head home,&quot; Amy said to him as he approached with a small smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... I was hoping to at least talk with Connor for a moment... before... nature called,&quot; Tad managed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m afraid you probably missed him,&quot; Amy answered, &quot;I think I saw him with Ryan and couple of others out by the flag pole when you went into the men&#39;s&#39; room... they&#39;ve since left and are also on their way home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nuts,&quot; Tad grumbled a bit, &quot;well... hopefully he&#39;s had a good day... and that no one did anything that would make him nervous... given everything that&#39;s gone on over the reveal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... most people around here may be on edge over the reveal,&quot; Amy commented as she opened one door and Tad opened the one next to it as they made their way out, &quot;but as people have started calm down a bit... I&#39;d think that some of the hostility over the issue is going down a bit.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tad nodded as they made their way outside and found things to be a bit peaceful as they made their way toward the sidewalk in front of the school building. From there it was an easy task to begin the fairly standard walk home, and as they went, Tad did overhear a few things. There were some conversations here and there, but it was soft and what did relate to the reveal had calmed down a bit, and a fair number of it actually seemed far more in favor of the reveal than it had been initially, but Tad guessed that might have just been some of those that were younger and looking to be &quot;free&quot; more often. As they reached the school&#39;s parking lot Amy continued...<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s got you worried about all that?&quot; Amy wondered, &quot;Connor seems nice enough... possibly gay or at least bi, but there&#39;s nothing wrong with that. And admittedly he&#39;s been very open to Moon Lake and all things were. With the exception of cases when weres outside of Moon Lake move to town, my parents say that most normals tend to be more nervous over things related to weres, the secret, and the Mandatory Were Law.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Some of that is a bit of my own memories growing up,&quot; Tad managed as they walked along, &quot;with my dad in the Marines... while we could live on base when he was there or if he had a combat deployment, if he was transferred to a new unit or his unit had a new peace time deployment, we&#39;d have to move with him. And if he went on a combat tour and was deployed to a different base on his return, we&#39;d have to handle the move on our own. This could and often did mean meeting a lot of new people for a modest period of time. I got to see a fair amount of the country, but it also meant dealing with people who didn&#39;t always like the &quot;new kid&quot; as it were.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Moon Lake&#39;s never been quite like THAT,&quot; Amy assured him, &quot;sure the weretigers and werelions argue over who represents &quot;the king of beasts,&quot; and at times the werelion pride males may get into it over females, particular areas claimed by a specific pride, and the various werewolf packs may occasionally tally the success of their hunting forays... but it&#39;s never been rejecting new residents because they&#39;re normals.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Outside of the Mandatory Were Law...&quot; Tad finished, &quot;though, I suppose THAT is different... And so far as I can tell, the Ross family, while they were surprised about weres... responded rather well and were very accepting. That said... I&#39;d still wish to make sure Connor is okay. He is a good friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two walked along quietly as they passed into the park area in the center of Moon Lake. It was more orderly than the woods outside of Moon Lake and the forested areas on the outer &quot;spokes&quot; of the town, and things were quieter as they walked along. There might have been some out jogging or on their way home from work at the end of the day, and this was one of the things that Tad had come to like about Moon Lake. It was something more than just the fact that it was a town where most of its residents were weres of various kinds. It represented its own form of peace, and that was something Tad could respect very much.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure he is,&quot; Amy said to him as they walked along, &quot;given all that you&#39;ve done for him... It&#39;s something that makes me think you could do a lot for Moon Lake...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no... I don&#39;t want to get into politics,&quot; Tad shook his head, &quot;too much arguing... I&#39;m more content with video games... you beat a level and complete the story...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It wouldn&#39;t necessarily have to be political,&quot; Amy told him, &quot;I mean... you and your mom helped my family out... My transformation coming early scared my family... scared me... and we worried that it would hit my brothers too. But you and your mom were able to give us some tips and pointers... it really helped there. You could be like... a couch for those situations. You&#39;ve shown that you care.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tad only shrugged, &quot;Most of what went into helping your brothers was based on my own experience. My mom and I knew that could work because it is what I went through with my own fist transformation. I love my mom... but I&#39;m not going to have sex with her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy only responded with a short chuckle of her head as they walked along, &quot;You know what I mean. You&#39;re smart and caring... something that I think a good many people on both sides of the whole debate at present need.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A shame most people won&#39;t listen to high school seniors,&quot; Tad chuckled as they turned onto the street that Tad and Amy&#39;s homes were on.<br />
<br />
Amy only chuckled back at the humorous tone that Tad had given at the quip, though that didn&#39;t necessarily change her opinion on how helpful Tad could be. He might not lead either side of the debate over the reveal and he might not even play a direct role in how it would impact Moon Lake&#39;s future, but she had found him smart and sensible, which in turn was part of what drew her to him... aside from the fact that their werewolf forms made for a good pair, Tad&#39;s form being black and hers being white. She had been with him for the debate that had set the town on its present path, ultimately toward a fairly uncertain future. Even if Tad wasn&#39;t going to play the leading role in the reveal, and a part of her was more than happy to let Tom Herald play that part, she felt that Tad and his mother&#39;s experiences outside of Moon Lake would give them the knowledge needed to help Moon Lake adapt to the changes that would come.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... how do you think tonight&#39;s meeting will go?&quot; Amy asked as Tad&#39;s house came into view, &quot;since these reveal meetings are to be behind closed doors in that the general public isn&#39;t to allow anyone in...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Part of that is likely to let the city council and Mr. Herald work things out in peace,&quot; Tad commented, &quot;they may have to deal with protests and things outside the building, but won&#39;t be continually refighting the debate inside it... which given the tension that&#39;s gone on, even if it&#39;s going down now... from there, I think it will mostly focus on what the base plan will be. You know... does someone just go into the center of New York City and transform or is it more subtle... things like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think they&#39;ll release parts of it to Moon Lake before hand?&quot; Amy wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe... though, there could also be something that would relate to how my dad put things...&quot; Tad commented, &quot;there may be times where things have to be done. They won&#39;t be pleasant. They won&#39;t be fun... and the consequences will be painful, but better to do it and have surprise, that reveal things in small doses and have things be worse... Though, that&#39;d also be part of the stuff that will also tie into worries for a friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure Connor will be fine,&quot; Amy told him as they reached the door, &quot;Ryan isn&#39;t a bad guy... and if Connor is bi... Ryan will understand, and will be surprisingly open.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve been with him?&quot; Tad wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;No... but he has lived a life much like you with your mom,&quot; Amy answered, &quot;since his dad is bi... his mom has tolerated his dad being with other men, so long as it is HER bed that Ryan&#39;s dad returns to in the end...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Until we moved here... I don&#39;t think my mom has been with anyone but my dad,&quot; Tad warned, &quot;though she is happy now with Claire... though that&#39;s obviously different.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy nodded as Tad looked back to her as he opened the door and asked, &quot;Would you like to come in?&quot; To which Amy answered, &quot;I&#39;d love to.&quot;</p>
