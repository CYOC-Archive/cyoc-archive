<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Evan Lawson dreams. Sitting in the chair next to his wife’s hospital bed as she recovers from giving birth earlier; the werewolf dreams of his family gathering for dinner and a celebration.<br />
<br />
“Mom, dad, It’s me Spencer.”<br />
Spencer walking into her old home, the deputy and now a mother herself steps inside the front foyer to see her younger brother who is now fourteen barrel in and greet her.<br />
“Well if it isn’t junior,” Spencer looking at her brother; “where are mom and dad?”<br />
“In the back yard getting things ready,” Evan Junior answering looking excited; “tonight is the night I have my first transformation! I&#39;ve been having those dreams of hunting; taking down and eating a large buck!”<br />
“Well it’s a good thing we showed up as well,” Eric answering as he helps guide his four year old daughters Maggie-Martha and Bethany inside. Frieda will be here in a moment,” Eric kissing Spencer; “she is talking to Benton.”<br />
“So girls,” Eric looking at his daughters; “are you excited to see what your uncle is about to become?”<br />
“Furry,” Bethany happily answers.<br />
“Yes,” Spencer smiling as she picks up the two kids with ease; “but will Evan be a panther, wolf, or a feline? Or will he become a hybrid like me?”<br />
“Mom and dad suspect hybrid,” Evan answering; “they say I smell of both wolf and cat.”<br />
“Well lets head on to the back yard then,” Eric answering; “no sense in hanging out here.”<br />
<br />
In the Lawson backyard; Evan senior smiles as he see his daughter arriving along with his grand cubs in tow. Despite Spencer not giving birth to Bethany; the black furred werewolf has dotted on the little cub as if she was his granddaughter. Smiling as the two run towards him eager to hug him as he is already in his fursona; both eagerly grab handfuls of fur as Evan Senior laughs happily.<br />
“Now this is how a family gathering should be,” Mike Lawson flipping some burgers on the bbq; “it’s a shame Mindy couldn’t be here, but she is on jury duty still.”<br />
“Dad sends his regards,” Frieda entering the backyard; “he and mom are still vacationing in Cuba.”<br />
“Well the burgers are ready,” Mike speaking; “grab a bun and get your fixings.”<br />
<br />
Maggie Lawson finishing setting up the picnic tables as Eric, Spencer and Frieda already in their fursonas. Eric and Frieda each twenty eight years of age while Spencer a year older. Evan Senior and Junior look on as Eric a white furred were-panther sits in between Frieda and grey furred were-panthress with russet red highlights and Spencer, a black furred werewolf/panther/feline hybrid. The three made for a unique couple as they are followed by their cubs.<br />
“Now,” Evan senior speaking up; “we know Bethany will be a were-panther when she is older, but any ideas on Maggie-Martha?”<br />
“Dad,” Spencer smiling; “that’s not for another ten years at least. Let the girls have their fun.”<br />
“Is it true that Lance and Lila’s kid is a hybrid,” Maggie speaking; “were-panther/tiger hybrid?”<br />
“Yeah,” Frieda answering; “Arnold had his first transformation last week. Earlier than expected,” Frieda speaking between bites of the beef and venison patty; “Uncle Lance and Aunt Lila were not expecting him to first shift at thirteen.”<br />
“It’s rare for a were to first shift at that age,” Mike answering; “Almost as rare as the unexpected surge of hybrids being born.&quot;<br />
<br />
Evan Junior was hardly paying attention to the conversation. The brown hair kid was feeling unwell as he started feeling flush and extremely warm.<br />
“I think I’m starting to shift,” Evan Junior speaks up; “I feel itchy all over.”<br />
Take your clothes off son,” Evan Senior speaking; “it will help with the change.”<br />
“Don’t fight it brother,” Spencer speaking up; “it will only hurt if you do.”<br />
<br />
Evan Junior was breathing hard as he felt an uncontrollable and uncomfortable sensation surging forth. Quickly removing his clothes; the teenager felt a pang of embarrassment as every got a good view of genitals and visible discomfort. His body itching like mad as fur started to sprout. Wincing as his bones cracked and reshaped; he body growing in height and mass. He looks at his hands as they morph into paws with opposable thumbs; Fur enveloping them as thick calloused pads form; nails becoming retractable as Evan feels the need to flex them, watching them pop out and pop back in.<br />
<br />
His feet take on a similar metamorphosis. With one toe on each foot disappearing and his ankle growing out; Evan was forced to stand on the balls of his feet, now resembling more like paws giving him a digitigrade stance. A wolf like tail shoots out of his spine giving him the assistance he needs to maintain his balance. Whimpering as his face pushes out forming a muzzle; his mouth and nose merging to form a snout all the while his ears migrate and become triangular tufts on the top of his head. The last of his change to complete his transition is a furry sheathe growing to protect his ruby red lupine like shaft that also has feline like barbs as well as a lupine topknot.<br />
<br />
Moments ago where a brown hair blue eye boy stood; a gray furred werewolf/panther hybrid with auburn highlights and wolf like sky blue eyes now stands. Everyone was silent as they watch Evan Junior pant and heave as his ordeal is over.<br />
“Every time you shift from here on out,” Spencer speaking up; “will never be painful like your first time brother.”<br />
“You’ll find them,” Frieda chiming in; &quot;quite euphoric.&quot;<br />
“You have anything to say son,” Evan Senior speaking up; “a celebratory howl perhaps?”<br />
“Can we go hunting dad,” Evan Junior answering; “I’m craving more than just a burger and a salad.”<br />
<br />
Evan twitches and smiles as he enjoys the pleasant dream he was experiencing; witnessing his son’s first transformation and a family gathering dinner with his daughter and her growing family. The strange man smiles and beams as he observes from the shadows, happy to always give pleasing possibilities to a weres future. While the strange man does know Evan Junior will be a werewolf/panther hybrid; he however cannot foretell the exact date the newborn cub will experience the change and as thus took a few liberties in forming and shaping the dream that both Evan and now Maggie Lawson are experiencing.<br />
Smiling as he feels his work is done, the man shifts into his ethereal dragon form and heads off to visit another were in need of his guidance and possibly impart some wisdom.</p>
