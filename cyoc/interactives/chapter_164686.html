<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">MONDAY (AM) <br />
<br />
Peter and Lauren were awakened by the slamming of cell doors. They both sat bolt upright as they faced out of the cell. An officer stood outside of each of them. <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re free to go.&quot; They said. They were lead back to where they came in as Peter and Lauren were reunited. Their celebration cut short as they noticed the changes that each of them had undergone over the night.<br />
<br />
Lauren’s legs had changed, now looking much like those of a donkey, it was a surprise she could still walk on two legs. <br />
<br />
Peter on the other hand had grown. His ass had expanded like Lauren’s did just the other day, though thankfully to his loose attire, he was able to accommodate the extra mass. Regardless of their situation, they were still happy to see each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;So we can just go?&quot; Peter asked the officer who brought them there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah pretty much. We&#39;re not going to charge of something that minor. It was just a warning that&#39;s all. Don&#39;t do it again!&quot; He said, waving them off as they left the police station.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well. That was an interesting setback.&quot; Peter said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, you&#39;re right. So…&quot; Lauren said, changing the topic quickly. &quot;How about we go find a room and finish what we started?&quot; Peter stared down at her, with a look of shock in his eyes. She just stared back, biting her lip while shrugging. He fought with himself; instinctively he wanted to shout yes, but today they had more important things to do.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lauren are you mad? We have to find the gypsy! We&#39;re so close to give up now!&quot; He said, grabbing her by the shoulders, shaking her body in time with his speech. <br />
<br />
She just looked at him dully and replies &quot;Well if we must!&quot; Peter shook his head in response. The pair got their bearings and headed off towards the carnival. After traversing multiple streets and taking several wrong turns they finally arrived. <br />
<br />
The place looked much smaller than they had built it to be in their imaginations, probably due to it being empty; opening time wasn&#39;t until later that night. They walked up to the entrance, only to be blocked off by a big Russian man, seemingly the ring master of the show. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ooh!&quot; He laughed as he saw them approaching. &quot;It is you!&quot; He had thick black hair all over his face and towered well above Peter and Lauren. They looked at him confused.<br />
&quot;Ha ha, you are here to see Gypsy! She told me you will be back.&quot; His English was less than perfect, though he pronounced ever word with his great big smile. &quot;Please... Go on in.&quot;<br />
<br />
Peter and Lauren shared a concerned look as they slowly took a step forward, into the boundary of the fair. The booming voice of the man echoed behind them. &quot;TAKE THE LEFT! HAHAHA!&quot; He shouted from behind them, sending a shiver up their spines. <br />
<br />
Reluctantly they followed the man&#39;s advice, heading left down that row of stores until they saw it. The shining bright sign. It was the only one that was lit up and underneath stood the gypsy. She stared straight at them, beckoning them to come closer. Apart from her presence there was no one else around, not even the previous game attendant.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come closer!&quot; She said in broken English. Lauren was the first to approach and James followed directly behind her. <br />
<br />
Though the closer she got the more her hands began to feel weird, until she noticed they were changing. Her fingers clenched tightly into a fist as slowly the gaps between her fingers melted away. Her entire hand merged together with itself, all the while turning black. The new masses on her hands began to harden until finally they solidified themselves as hooves. She fell forward, landing on them as she supported herself on four legs, now with matching hooves.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is why we came! I want you to turn it ooooofff!&quot; Peter said as he lost balance himself. He looked down, only to find his legs had begun to change. His muscles bulged beneath his shorts as they grew to support a different style of walking. He quickly grabbed into a nearby railing to support himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;As I was saying...&quot; He continued, though the gypsy seemed more interested in Lauren. She circled around his girlfriend before she grabbed Lauren’s tail and lifted it up. Then she slowly running a finger up her ass, gently rubbing its tip along the slit of her pussy. Lauren started panting as they Gypsy teased her further.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing?!&quot; Peter called. &quot;Stop that!&quot; He yelled again, though the gypsy did nothing. &quot;I&#39;M SORRY! OKAY? IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT TO HEAR? NOW CAN YOU PLEASE CHANGE US BACK!&quot; He shouted, tired and desperate.<br />
<br />
The gypsy stopped immediately. Turning her sights on Peter. She shook her head before speaking. <br />
<br />
&quot;No. I can change you back. The girl has made up her mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean made up her mind?!&quot; He asked frantically.<br />
<br />
&quot;She wants to stay. She wants to be donkey. Ask for self.&quot; The woman replied calmly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Baby... Lauren, tell me she&#39;s lying!&quot; He said, looking directly at her, though Lauren was blushing now, continually breaking their stare. &quot;Say something! Please!&quot; he cried. <br />
<br />
Reluctantly Lauren turned around and opened her mouth.&quot;Heee-Haaaw! Heee-Haaaw! Heee-Haaaw! Heee-Haaaw!&quot; She shouted, blushing again as she shut her mouth. From this point her changes accelerated drastically.<br />
<br />
Her front legs buckled underneath her, straightening out and clicking into place, just as he hind legs had done. She bit at her dress with her mouth, tugging at it and pulling it over her head, tossing it to the ground. She trampled on it with her hoof as her body began to bulk up, connecting all of the strange pieces that had changed over the last few days. Her breasts were absorbed back into her chest and her neck stretched outwards, tensing and clicking as muscles grew to support her new head.<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; Peter said, defeated. He slumped to his knees racking his brain for answers. &quot;Change her back! Take me instead!&quot; he begged.<br />
<br />
&quot;I tell you what. I make a deal.&quot; The gypsy spoke, and Peter listened intensely. &quot;We play game. 1 round, 5 rings. If you win, you both go home. If I win you both stay. If we both lose then I&#39;ll take you instead. Sound fair?&quot; She said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I&#39;ll do it!&quot; He yelled. He knew the game was rigged, so at the very least he would get his wish. Neither of them would win and they could switch places.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good.&quot; The gypsy said smiling. She led Peter around to the front of the stall, where she had already set up their game. &quot;You first.&quot; She said.<br />
<br />
Peter stepped up to the plate, taking the rings in one hand and slowly tossing them, one after the other. Each ring was as unfortunate as the last, narrowly hitting its target before bouncing off again. Reaffirming his theory that the game was unbeatable. <br />
<br />
Next in line was the gypsy. She took her first shot, which veered off to the left, missing by a mile. Her second wasn&#39;t much better either. Her third shot went straight over the top of the board. She had two shots left. Peter was confident he could save Lauren, there was still a chance. <br />
<br />
Then the gypsy threw her fourth ring. It sailed smoothly upwards, before gently settling, landing dead centre on the bottle. She had won, with a ring to spare.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha ha, who&#39;s cheater now!?&quot; The gypsy said. <br />
<br />
Immediately after losing he began to feel the effects. His nose began to fill with the enticing smell of a nearby jenny. He looked to his side as Lauren was nuzzling up to him. <br />
<br />
Groaning he removed the last of his clothes, his pants and shirt. As more of Lauren’s intoxicating scent filled his nose, Peter became harder than he ever had in his life. He fell to his hands, as they changed beneath him, melting away into black putty before being reformed as hooves. <br />
<br />
He trotted over to Lauren, who was presenting herself to him, and mounted her, causing her to bray loudly. His thoughts became cloudy. His frame filled outwards, becoming thicker and more mobile as all of his changes quickly culminated into his current form. Soon he was indistinguishable from an ordinary donkey.<br />
<br />
He started thrusting, faster and faster, digging his four hooves into the ground as he fucked Lauren right in front of their new master. His ears stood tall on his head and his tail swung freely behind him. The sounds of pleasurable brays filled the morning air until finally Peter climaxed and Lauren along with him. Both his and Lauren&#39;s needs were fulfilled as his final human thought left him. <br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t believe she actually won. It wasn&#39;t a scam after all.  You know, I feel like.. I feel like... Such an ass.&quot;</p>
