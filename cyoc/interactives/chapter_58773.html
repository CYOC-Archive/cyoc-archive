<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The driver laughs at your question and instead of giving you a straight answer, she replies cryptically, &quot;You'll see.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frustrated, you sit back, going over your options, wondering what this has to do with your wish and whether you should have put in more details. Taking the note from your pocket, you unfold it and try to reread your wish by the light of the dash-panel, but give it up as hopeless and instead think about just ripping up the note.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nearly there,&quot; the driver announces, distracting you from your thoughts as the van slows and then turns onto a new road.<br />
<br />
Folding the note back up, you decide to go alone with everything for the moment and if things get to out of hand, you'll destroy the note at a later date. Glancing at the clock on the radio, you note that it is about nine forty seven and sitting back, you slip the note back into your pocket as you attempt to remember anything that might help you to understand what lead you to this point.<br />
<br />
Closing your eyes, you silently go over all that you can remember. You know your name, Shaun, and that it has not changed. Your parents and home are still the same. What seemed to have changed was that you have lost four years of your life and that you are being sent to a boarding school. And then you remember why.<br />
<br />
Your remember brother, Jack, daring you to break the greenhouse windows on Ms Sempkies property. You do as Jack had dared you to. The cops showing up about three fourths of the way of you exhibit of vandalism. Trying to plead with the cops, to no avail. Explaining that this was your brother's idea, which they do not believe. And then you are hauled home, in handcuffs, to your parents and you face a verbal lashing to them.<br />
<br />
And then, when you attempt to explain your side of what happened, you are horrified to learn that your parents don't believe you either as they explain that Jack has been home all evening and to prove it, they show you up to his room, where you see Jack relaxing on his bed.<br />
<br />
You remember being brought before a judge and tried as juvenile. Your sentence...three years community service and three years, six months at the local shelter. That, or attending Madam Yu's Boarding School, something you quickly agree to, thinking it would be better than the local shelter...and it would also expunge your record of this nightmare.<br />
<br />
Opening your eyes, you think, &quot;Damn you Jack,&quot; as the driver announces, &quot;We're here.&quot;<br />
------<br />
<br />
What happens next is all a blur, but as you lay on your bed several hours later, trying to get used to the underwear and nightgown you are wearing, you go over the events, wondering more than ever if you should have been more explicit in your wish.<br />
<br />
After being taken from the van, the driver showed you inside, where you are greeted by a formidable looking woman, who introduces herself as Mistress Yu. From there, she explains that she is the headmistress and that her great grandmother started this boarding school for little boys that found themselves in the situation you currently were in.<br />
<br />
Behind you, the driver is filling out some form and when she is finished, the next moment comes as a shock when she tells you, &quot;Strip!&quot; as she hands the forms to Mistress Yu.<br />
<br />
Unsure, you look at Mistress Yu and then at the driver, who tells you, &quot;If you do not strip, I will be forced to do it for you!&quot;<br />
<br />
Scared, you slowly begin to undress, stopping when you are down to nothing but your underwear, but nearly scream when Mistress Yu tells you, &quot;All of it,&quot; and hesitant, unsure what is going on, you remove the last article of clothing, handing it to the driver, who is holding the rest of your clothes.<br />
<br />
Naked, wanting to cry, you listen as Mistress Yu explained, &quot;Here, we have ways of curing boys of their masculine problems. From sun-up to sun-down, you will engage in activities that are suitable for a girl. You will dress and act in accordance with how a girl performs in her day-to-day routine. Failure to comply with any rules, and you will be sent to me for the treatment. Misbehaving or acting in a behaviour that is unruly or boorish with result in you being sent to me for the treatment. The rest, you will figure out as you go.&quot;<br />
<br />
Turning away from you, she marched across the hall and entered a room. Behind you, the driver has begun to fold your clothes and when she is finished, she began to fill out another form.<br />
<br />
After a couple seconds, Mistress Yu has returned and hands you a white nightgown and a pair of underwear suitable for a young girl. As you look at the articles of clothing that Mistress Yu has just handed you, you just barely register the words the Headmistress was saying to the driver.<br />
<br />
As you come to terms with the fact that Mistress Yu has just handed you a pair of cotton underwear, a nightgown and that she has told the driver to register you as nine years of age and under the name Saphira, you look at the Headmistress and wonder what she would say and do if you refused to wear the clothes she has just handed to you. And then it hits you that you will probably wind up doing the treatment.<br />
<br />
As you think over your options, Mistress Yu announced, &quot;You will get up a six. Breakfast is at seven thirty. That leaves you an hour and a half to prepare for the day ahead. From nine until three, you will attend school, with a break at twelve for lunch. From three until six you shall work on your homework. At six thirty, dinner will be served. From seven thirty until nine, you will engage in whatever programmes have been set up for you...varying from some sort of physical fitness to events of leisure. Tomorrow, when you wake, you see me first thing for the fitting of your uniforms. Do you understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
Scared, you nod, to which Mistress Yu replied, &quot;Dress and I will show you to your room. Amy, you know what to do with this boy's garments.&quot;<br />
<br />
Not liking what you am hearing, you think quickly, but are unable to see any way of retrieving the note and upset about the prospect of attending a school as a girl, you hesitate for a moment longer before you reluctantly begin to dress.<br />
------<br />
<br />
Now, hours later, you stare up at the ceiling, millions of possible ways of getting the note back circling through your mind; realising that each one is as ridiculous and not likely to work; understanding that you have no knowledge of where youy clothes might be and that if you were to be caught, you would surely be sent to Mistress Yu for the treatment.<br />
<br />
Sighing, you roll over and look at the wall, wondering what you can do to get yourself out of this situation. As you realise that there isn't much a ten year old can do, you feel myself beginning to drowse. Within moments, you are asleep.</p>
