<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jacob kept Kate asleep inside him all evening and until she awoke on Saturday morning. Jacob did his best to give hir a wake up orgasm, having kept hir on both sides of the edge all night. Jacob had remembered more about how to control Kate&#39;s male orgasm so he could use it to keep hir throbbing balls and prostate in a state of high output for an extended time. Jacob could tell had had made Kate sore, but knew from the past she would recover quickly. As Jacob withdrew from Kate, he left a couple of softball sized masses in Kate&#39;s ass. Jacob then went to the bathroom to release the unusable contents from Kate&#39;s body into the toilet. Jacob had finished and flushed when he could feel Kate making use of the masses he left in hir ass. Jacob came into the bedroom and saw Kate at work over in the corner with two mirrors. The material left behind by Jacob responded to Kate&#39;s telepathy as she willed them into a very comfortable skinsuit for their morning bike riding session.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks dear. I do like how you feel against my skin,&quot; Kate said aloud.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you prefer doing your own,&quot; Jacob replied aloud. Jacob stepped over to the bed and finished solidifying his form for the bike ride while Kate played with the various way she could cover hir body with Jacob&#39;s body remnants.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you go easy on the form changes until we get to Larry&#39;s place?,&quot; asked Kate aloud.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can do that,&quot; Jacob replied. Jacob felt the suit Kate formed start to feed on Kate&#39;s breastmilk and seminal fluid, but only slightly and asked, &quot;Did you mean to milk yourself with the suit already?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just checking thing are in place and ready. Thank you for doing that, this feels good. I like the nipple pressure,&quot; Kate responded, still gazing at hir form in the mirrors.<br />
<br />
&quot;I remembered that sometime during the night. I remembered how the Kate in this reality loved what your doing now,&quot; Jacob said, thinking of the orgasms Kate had in the past.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll be sure to pace myself. Those orgasms you remembered just now are quite intense,&quot; Kate thought inside Jacob&#39;s head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmmm, hmmm,&quot; Jacob replied inside Kate&#39;s head.<br />
<br />
&quot;And yes, I am good with Larry living with us, but I get final say on some changes he needs,&quot; Kate thought in Jacob&#39;s head.<br />
<br />
Jacob rolled his eyes, and stammered aloud, &quot;Did I, did, I...did I think anything about that anytime this morning?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why so defensive? Your more possessive than I am. Besides, your love for Larry and his for you is in your profile, so I have nothing to be upset about,&quot; Kate thought in Jacob&#39;s head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry...the old and new still are blurred for me. I want to make sure I do nothing to upset you willingly,&quot; Jacob said verbally, clearly and slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine, let&#39;s get going shall we? It&#39;s a bit of a bike ride to Larry&#39;s from the new place here,&quot; Kate said, ready to move on from the past.<br />
<br />
The two found the bikes in the garage did not have bikes seats. The rather expensive carbon fiber bikes had a steel  knob on a piston as a place to not exactly sit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just like I remembered it....but first time trying it,&quot; Kate said as she put hir hand on the knob and clenching hir ass at the same time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ehhh, it will fit,&quot; Jacob said dismissively as he straddled the bike and the knob disappeared into an indentation between his legs.<br />
<br />
Kate watched Jacobs seat knob slide into him, and straddled hir bike, and let the knob sink into hir ass, slowly. &quot;I know this should not work, but it does. I feel that I am one with the bike, even the pedals will be part of my suit,&quot; Kate said as she put a foot on a pedal, and the part of hir suit covering hir foot moved to cover the pedal and harden.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just like riding a bike, eh?&quot; Jacob said with a rather guilty grin.<br />
<br />
Kate said nothing, and then stepped on the other pedal and was off down the driveway, and onto the road. Jacob rode out of the garage, closed the garage door, and went to catch up with Kate.<br />
<br />
Jacob got a couple of pedal pushes before sitting and sinking down too far on the titanium knob. Jacob had to brake to a stop, stand up and harden the place the knob goes and around his legs, then sat down slowly, feeling the knob slip in with a little pop, and slowly pedaled after Kate.<br />
<br />
Kate was waiting at the end of the street as Jacob came riding up. Kate laughed as she replayed Jacob&#39;s oops moment in Jacob&#39;s head and turned to pedal out into the busier roadway. Kate and Jacob didn&#39;t really have a conversation, but more a sharing of memories and thoughts along the way to Larry&#39;s. Kate pulled into the park that was the meeting place for Larry and his wife, which Jacob close behind.  Larry waved from a picnic table by a smaller parking lot in the park. Kate was the first to pull up, and stood up to put hir feet on the ground as the bike came to a stop, hir ass still firmly gripping the knob.<br />
<br />
&quot;That doesn&#39;t get old,&quot; Larry thought. Kate smiled. <br />
<br />
Kate looked around and said aloud, &quot;Where is your other half, and I don&#39;t mean Jacob.&quot;<br />
<br />
Larry rolled his eyes to Kate and sighed, &quot;She didn&#39;t want to ride this morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kate responded quickly, &quot;You, the bike, or both.&quot;<br />
<br />
Larry didn&#39;t answer, but Kate knew both was what Larry was thinking. &quot;Sorry Larry,&quot; Kate said aloud.<br />
<br />
Jacob, only a few seconds behind Kate, finally stopped next to Kate and saw the long face on both Larry and Kate. &quot;What did I miss?,&quot; he asked. Kate just gave Jacob a strong side eye, and Jacob nodded saying aloud, &quot;Sorry Larry.<br />
<br />
Jacob watched as Larry got up, and smiled at his work husband and said, &quot;You really fill that suit out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Larry looked at Jacob and thought, &quot;For the lovers of fat men in spandex.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kate blew Larry a kiss and gave a long, slow stroke of hir cock through hir suit. Larry thought he would love to feel that in his ass, and it didn&#39;t matter it was too big for him. Kate shook hir head, &quot;Your such a tease Larry.&quot;<br />
<br />
Larry smiled at Kate, then straddled his bike and began to pedal toward his house, with Kate and Jacob close behind. The trio had been pedaling for over an hour total when they arrived at Larry&#39;s house. Larry&#39;s suit was shiny and wet from his sweat. Larry put his bike on a hanger in his garage as Jacob and Kate dismounted their bikes and Jacob went up to Larry, and hugged him into him. A few moments later, a dry and sweat free Larry emerged, with Jacob unzipping Larry&#39;s skinsuit. Larry hit the button to close the garage door then proceeded to remove his spandex cycling suit, showing the latex-looking full body suit that Jacob encased him in. Jacob then reached behind Larry, feeling his hand go between Larry&#39;s butt cheeks, and pressed into Larry&#39;s anus, then deposited a couple of smaller masses into him. Jacob pulled his hand away as a large plug formed inside Larry&#39;s ass. Larry clenched his ass as his cock throbbed, and smiled thinking to himself, &quot;Thank you Jake.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kate grabbed Jacob&#39;s arm, holding him back as Larry went into the house from the garage. &quot;It&#39;s an ambush, can you feel it from her?,&quot; Kate thought inside Jacob&#39;s head. Jacob turned and nodded yes. Kate and Jacob walked into the dining room, with Larry being berated by his wife, Sarah. The anger and hatred inside Sara&#39;s mind was very significant, a blinding rage at the least. Larry stood still as Sarah went into the bedroom, slamming the door hard. No words were spoken aloud, but Larry, Jacob, and Kate tried to work out a way to help Sarah. Larry knew Sarah would be gone if he left. Looking around, they saw she was packing. Jacob shared the hatred he felt from Sarah with Larry, bringing Larry to sobbing tears. Larry was finally coming to terms with the end of his fourth marraige. Sarah came back out of the bedroom, and continued to pack and load her vehicle in the garage. Larry tried to talk with Sarah, who said nothing to him, and with one last suitcase, she threw her house key at Larry. Larry followed her into the garage, where she loaded the suitcase, got into the driver&#39;s seat. Larry was standing beside the driver&#39;s door when the vehicle&#39;s engine started, and Sarah put it in gear and drive away, never looking at Larry.<br />
<br />
Larry watched as the vehicle drive away and then went over to the door switch to close the garage door. Larry went back into the house where Kate and Jacob were now sitting on bar stools. Larry said aloud, &quot;She has done that so many times, I never know if that is the last.&quot; Larry stepped over to Kate and gently slid his hand up and down Kate&#39;s shaft.<br />
<br />
Jacob broke the silence and asked, &quot;Why don&#39;t we have an afternoon ride, then come back here for the night?&quot;<br />
<br />
Larry, his eyes fixed on Kate&#39;s bulge nodded yes, as well as Kate nodding  yes, watching Larry&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
The threesome slowly went into the garage, picked up their respective bicycles, and pedaled off for a ride to anywhere and nowhere. This was Jacob and Kate&#39;s old neighborhood, so the threesome rode around until it was time to eat, and the three went into a local place they all liked. They all sat in a corner booth, with Jacob in the middle so he could eat while the other two ate solid food. The three ate in silence as they conversed in mostly Jacob&#39;s head.<br />
<br />
Kate thought, &quot;Come home with us Larry, as long as you want. We can stop by your place if you need anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
Larry replied inside Jacob&#39;s head, &quot;Yep. I&#39;m in.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both Kate and Larry gave Jacob hell for his thoughts on &quot;worlds colliding&quot; between his work and home husbands. Jacob simply let them both go over the edge with male orgasm at the same time. To an outside observer, the two twitching at the same time, while odd, did not stand out in a fairly busy and dimly lit restaurant. It was this reality&#39;s Kate that pushed Larry out of their bedroom after living with Jacob and Kate after his second failed marriage. Larry would find this Kate is a bit more dominant, and liking it. Jacob managed to get his two husbands back on the edge before a dry Larry was groaning, struggling as his balls were tight against his body. Kate patted Jacobs leg and soon both Larry and Kate crossed over into a throbbing orgasm, but only Kate&#39;s had any meaningful output for Jacob to drain. Larry paid the bill, and leaned on Jacob&#39;s arm until Kate said it was time to go. The two large breasted fuck buddies that Larry was going home with slowly slid out of the booth and Larry followed them back to the bikes.<br />
<br />
The three pedaled back to Larry&#39;s place, where they found Sarah had not returned. Larry put a few things in a backpack and locked up. Larry took the position behind Kate and Jacob in the back as they were off to Jacob and Kate&#39;s new house. Kate went back a different route, with less cars, but with over an hour of continuous pedaling. Kate opened the garage door as she was the first to arrive, with Larry and Jacob nowhere in sight, but about a minute behind. Larry pulled into the garage after seeing Kate standing in the doorway, with Jacob right behind. Kate took Jacob&#39;s bike after he dismounted and then Jacob took Larry&#39;s bike and hung it in the corner before going to the kitchen doorway and pushing the button to close the garage door. Jacob turned around and saw Kate kissing Larry, hir hands on each of Larry&#39;s large butt cheeks, pulling them apart and squeezing. Jacob gave a playful squeeze of both Kate and Larry&#39;s skinsuit covered asscheeks as they walked passed him into the kitchen. Jacob knew they needed to drink and rest, but he was already looking to having them both inside him at the same time.<br />
<br />
Larry stood next to the sink, drinking a glass of water that Kate had handed him, then looked over to Jacob and asked, &quot;Already? I thought it was the suit, but I can see how puffy they are under the suit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am a sucker for big tits Larry, but so are you,&quot; Jacob replied aloud.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok,&quot; looking at Kate, &quot;you know what turns me on, so turn me into that,&quot; Larry said, as his lust filled gaze locked onto Kate&#39;s tits as she drank hir glass of water.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your cock will serve me well Larry,&quot; Kate commanded to Larry with a sultry look.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes ma&#39;am sir,&quot; Larry replied as he saluted Kate, then laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right,&quot; Kate said seriously, and then pointed to Jacob, &quot;I&#39;ve been sharing my wife with you for years, respect my generosity and we will not have any problems. There is only one head in this household, and your looking at hir.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I won&#39;t mess this up again Kate. Thank you for the second chance,&quot; Larry replied gratefully.<br />
<br />
Jacob was already at work with some slow and slight changes to Larry. Larry was now sporting  a fairly puffy set of large female nipples, and his prostate was already growing in size and capacity, while working more like a forty year old prostate rather than a sixty year old one. Kate and Larry did several more rounds of drinks before taking a shower together. Jacob rested on the bed, still in his solid form from earlier, waiting for the two to join him on the bed.</p>
