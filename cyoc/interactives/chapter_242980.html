<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Johnny yawned and stretched, as he got out of bed.  He could immediately smell breakfast, which put a smile on his face.  His parents usually got up early for work, but his mom didn&#39;t always take the time to make breakfast.  This was good, because he had something to tell both of them that he wasn&#39;t able to the previous night.  He finally got a job.  It was just as a stock-boy at a local grocery store, but still ...<br />
<br />
Throwing on a T-shirt, he headed out of his bedroom, then down the hall.  He could hear his mom and dad having a conversation.  Good, they were both there.  This should make them happy.  They&#39;ve been trying to get him to get a job for a while now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Mom.  Hey, Dad,&quot; he said, walking into the kitchen.  &quot;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re both here.  I have some news to tell you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; his mom asked, turning away from the stove, just for a moment, before continuing making scrambled eggs in a skillet.<br />
<br />
&quot;I finally got a job,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;s about time,&quot; his dad said.  Still seated at the table, he slapped Johnny&#39;s shoulder.  &quot;My boy finally has a job.  So, where will you be working?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m working at ...&quot;  Suddenly, there was a FLASH.  &quot;Bangers,&quot; Johnny finished.<br />
<br />
Johnny&#39;s dad nearly dropped the spatula he was using to make the eggs.  His mom&#39;s smile went away.  &quot;Care to repeat that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you don&#39;t like that place, Mom.  But I can make a lot of money waiting tables,&quot; Johnny said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe you can, but I don&#39;t want you working at that place,&quot; his mom said.  &quot;You&#39;ll be treated like s sex object.  Do you really want to walk around in those tight orange shorts that exemplify your ... you know ...&quot; she said, gesturing towards her son&#39;s crotch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, you&#39;re being ridiculous,&quot; Johnny said.  &quot;You make it sound like I&#39;m signing up to be a stripper or something.  I&#39;ll be a waiter, that&#39;s all.  I mean, I&#39;m sure Dad had a job waiting tables back when <i>he</i> was in high school.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This isn&#39;t about your father.  This is about you,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honey, maybe you <i>are</i> being a little too ...&quot; Johnny&#39;s dad began, as he put a plate of the finished breakfast in front of his wife.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m a very important person in this community.  If people found out that my own son is working as a waiter at Bangers ... it&#39;ll put not just me, but this family, in a very bad position.  I can&#39;t have that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Johnny was not happy.  He stomped his foot, then headed back to his bedroom.  He fell back onto his bed, his long hair draping across it messily, before he pushed it aside, and continued to fume.  He finally got a job and his overprotective mother just shot it down.  So what if his bulge was being shown off in those super-tight shorts?  It wasn&#39;t like he didn&#39;t like to show it off normally anyway.  And being a waiter there would pay him good money, in addition to the tips from customers ... who might be horny women just coming there for the scenery, instead of the cuisine of sausages and hot dogs, but still ... he was a big boy now.  He could handle some perverted customers.<br />
<br />
So it was settled.  He wasn&#39;t going to quit before his first day on the job.  But could he lie to his own mother about it?  What if she found out what he was up to?<br />
<br />
------<br />
<br />
Lisa woke up in her dorm room and sighed.  Another day of college, trying her best to make strides.  She always felt like she was at a disadvantage, being a girl and all.  So she had to fight harder for the life and career she wanted.  It brought her here, to his prestigious university.  The courses were hard, but Lisa was ambitious.  She&#39;ll ace all these classes, get that degree, and make a name for herself in the field of ...<br />
<br />
FLASH<br />
<br />
There was a loud pounding on her bedroom door.  Just for a moment, Lisa was disoriented.  Wasn&#39;t she just in her dorm room?  What was she doing back at home?  But then that thought seemed ridiculous.  After all, where else would she be?  And dorm room?  As in college?  Yeah, she wasn&#39;t much of a school person.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lisa, I want you to wake up and come downstairs,&quot; came her father&#39;s voice.  &quot;Your mother and I have something to talk to you about.&quot;<br />
<br />
Groaning, Lisa pulled her covers back and swung out of bed, scratching her armpit hair.  As usual, her torso was bare, showing off her large fat breasts and equally-fat belly.  She was really letting herself go these past few years.  Not that it really mattered to her, of course.  After all, girls didn&#39;t really need to look good.  That was a boy thing.<br />
<br />
Opening the door, she was about to leave her room, but then decided to throw on a T-shirt.  She wasn&#39;t sure her parents wanted to see her pudgy body.<br />
<br />
Upon entering the kitchen, she saw her mother at the table reading a newspaper, dressed only in a T-shirt and boxer shorts, and her father grabbing milk from the refrigerator.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, what do you want?&quot; she asked, sounding annoyed and disinterested.<br />
<br />
&quot;You need to make some changes in your life, young lady,&quot; her mom scolded her.  &quot;Get out of that pigsty of a bedroom of yours, stop playing video games or whatever else you&#39;re doing in there, and get out of the house and find a job.  You&#39;re not a teenager anymore.  You have to start living your own life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your mother is right,&quot; Lisa&#39;s father said, sitting down at the table and crossing his legs beneath his nightgown.  &quot;This layabout attitude of yours has got to stop.  Make some life goals.  Try to strive for something better.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa frowned.  She didn&#39;t want anything better.  She liked living here, spending all day playing video games, watching TV, and all those things her parents didn&#39;t know about, like masturbating to porn on the internet.  They wanted her to strive for something more, but she just wasn&#39;t an ambitious person.  After all, she was a girl.  There was no need for her to fight for something better.  If she wanted a job, then she could just get one.  But right now, she just didn&#39;t much feel like it.  She was happy enough.  Why did this good life of hers have to stop?</p>
