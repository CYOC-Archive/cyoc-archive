<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I woke the next morning to the sound of Biddy scratching on the bedroom door. I heard Rod call out &quot;No&quot; and his footsteps as he came and collected the pup. <br />
I lifted the sheet and confirmed I was still in Sarah&#39;s body. It was only just light, 6.15 according to the clock. No need to get up except that my bladder was full. I didn&#39;t want to get up as I wasn&#39;t sure I could face Rod. I thought of the situation I was in. We had both wanted sex last night but I had stopped him at the last minute. Rod was a male who was attracted to this body, his fiancé&#39;s body. I was a man stuck in this body, ruled by female hormones. Rod was my best mate and right now I was attracted to him as a woman. I was so confused. Should I enjoy it while I could? If I did would I regret it later? I had already enjoyed sex in this body, but that had been with Sarah when she was wearing Rod&#39;s body. I had already cheated on Amanda once, why not do it again? Right now Amanda could be making love to Sarah who was wearing my true body, that of Zach. If she was having fun, and by the conversation we had yesterday, she was, why shouldn&#39;t I?<br />
I needed to go to the toilet, could I sneak there and back without Rod seeing me? All seemed quite outside now, I suspected Rod had taken Biddy back to his bedroom.<br />
I quietly slipped out of bed. Clad only in Sarah&#39;s nightie I peeked out the door. I only had to run 10 meters down the hall. If Rod was in the lounge he would see me. If he was in his room I would be safe. Damn I couldn&#39;t hang on, this bladder needed to be emptied.<br />
I made the dash and got to the bathroom closing the door behind me. Sat down on the toilet and emptied my bladder..... That certainly felt better. Feeling relieved I took the opportunity to change pads. I was happy to see that my period had slowed considerably. According to Sarah I could expect it to be over sometime tomorrow. Once it was finished we should be able to swap back. Urgent needs attended to it was time to go back to bed.<br />
I quietly opened the door, Rod wasn&#39;t in sight. I began to tiptoe back to the room. Suddenly there was Biddy jumping on my legs and whining with excitement. I bent down to pick him up and try to shush him. He quietened when I gave him a cuddle. <br />
I took Biddy back to the bedroom and couldn&#39;t help but start playing with him, 10 minutes of peekaboo, scratches and other puppy games and I was giggling with delight, all my worries forgotten for the time being.<br />
There was a knock on the bedroom door &quot;Morning Zach. I&#39;m going for a run, I&#39;ll be back in half an hour&quot;<br />
&quot;Ok, see you later&quot; I replied in Sarah&#39;s voice. I heard him leaving via the front door. I wondered if Sarah sometimes might go running with him. Certainly this body felt very fit. <br />
I had noticed a silky dressing gown amongst the clothes I had hung in the cupboard last night, I found it and put it on, tying the sash around my now petite waist. It felt very nice as it rubbed against the satin nightie I was wearing. <br />
I decided I felt like another shower and anyway needed to wash my hair as I had not done so in the bath last night. So I put Biddy out the back. Collected some shampoo from Sarah&#39;s toiletries and enjoyed a long hot shower. <br />
When finished I soon realized that long hair takes a bit more drying than my old short style. I hadn&#39;t thought to bring a hairdryer in with me and couldn&#39;t remember packing one either. I dried the hair as much as I could with a towel, donned panties and the dressing gown over an otherwise naked body. <br />
I thought I should have time for a coffee before Rod returned so decided to get some brewing whilst I got dressed. I knew the real Sarah had given Rod the machine for his birthday last August.<br />
Biddy had heard me in the kitchen and was crying at the door again so I let him back in. I was just leaving the kitchen when the front door door opened and Rod came in. <br />
He was wearing black shorts and a blue singlet and was soaked with sweat. He smiled when he saw me, said &quot;Good morning beautiful&quot; came over and gave me a kiss on the lips, then walked to the bedroom. I stood there like a stunned mullet. A minute passed then I could hear the shower in the ensuite running.<br />
I blushed as I realized my nipples were erect and pushing out the front of my gown.  Was I turned on by the smell of Rod&#39;s sweat? Or was it the kiss? Or him calling me beautiful? I hurried to the bedroom. <br />
Once there I concentrated on finding clothes to wear to work. Sarah had told me the dress code was a knee length skirt and a blouse with the dealerships name embroidered on it&#39;s pocket. Today I decided on a light blue blouse and a brown skirt. I wondered if perhaps I should wash some of the clothes I had been wearing over the last few days, as the supply of clean clothes was not endless. <br />
Once dressed I tried to brush the hair but it was still very wet. I would have to ask Rod if he had a dryer.<br />
I decided it was time for breakfast so went into the kitchen to help myself.<br />
Rod was already there eating a bowl of Weetbix, dressed in his work clothes.<br />
&quot;Umm... Sorry about before&quot; he said. &quot;I just forgot and thought you were Sarah&quot; <br />
I looked at him &quot;It&#39;s not everyday you get kissed by your best mate. It took me by surprise&quot; I smiled &quot;I enjoyed it&quot; He gave me a puzzled look. Did I really just say that?<br />
I said to Rod &quot;I&#39;m not gay, but right now I&#39;m in Sarah&#39;s body. This body want&#39;s to make love to you&quot; He took a step towards me. I shook my head and indicated he should stop. &quot;Tonight could be my last chance to make love as a woman. If I still feel this way tonight, we might experiment, however I am fearful you will no longer respect me when I&#39;m back to being Zach&quot;<br />
&quot;Zach or should I call you Sarah, you saw me making love in Amanda&#39;s body. I have been in your situation. I understand what you are going through. I would like to make love to you tonight but will still respect you whether we do or not&quot;<br />
We looked at each other for a full minute.<br />
I finally broke the silence by asking whether he had a hair dryer I could use and could I wash some clothes.<br />
&quot;Of course&quot;<br />
I put my dirty clothes into his machine then ate breakfast without saying another word. Rod had put a dryer in the bathroom. Again I was amazed at how I had acquired the ability to style Sarah&#39;s hair and apply make-up. I had time to hang the clothes on his line before heading to work.<br />
As I drove the car I wondered whether I had made the right decision.</p>
