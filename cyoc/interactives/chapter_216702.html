<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff has alway had a pension for red heads especially from Ireland he really appreciated their take no shit attitude, their high energy personalities and even their straight forward way of communicating that is borderline abusive Jeff really admired for not pulling their punches. Jeff thought what his father really needed was someone to give him a kick in the pants by someone who always peaked their mind to help him get out of his funk and start living his life. Now how should he make his Gaelic lass for his father he figured she should be younger than to help motivate him and keep up with two active teens but not too young as to be inappropriate so mid thirties. Now for personality Jeff wanted a feisty proud Irishwoman who alway spoke their mind and stood up to anyone and everyone, someone who call you out on your shit even those close to her while still protective of them. With mental done on to physical she was going to have fiery red hair no question, with plenty of traditional Celtic features such as a whole lot of freckles and emerald eyes, Jeff also thought it be fitting to make her a curvy muscular beauty so she could either intimidate or back her smack talk while also making her pretty short so the irony of a short stack beating drunks at the bar wouldn’t be lost on anyone, she would be a pint sized amazon. Next Jeff started placing in history for his future stepmom, having her be an immigrant straight from the Emerald Isle where are parents and older brothers live having moved to explore the world more before meeting Mike, hitting it off and actually getting married, he also gave her a brilliant mind for quick callbacks and creative problem solving and bilingual to give her more Gaelic flavor. With all the details filled he just needed a name for the woman he created and found an unique Irish name online with the final stats looking,<br />
<br />
Name: Aoife Kenwick<br />
Age: 35<br />
Gender: Female<br />
Race: Caucasian Irish <br />
IQ: 125<br />
Language: English, Gaelic<br />
Sex Drive: Moderate<br />
Build: Athletic Shortstack (5’ 1”, extremely curvy, well toned, E-cup breasts)<br />
Hair: Long Curly Bright Red <br />
Eyes: Emerald Green<br />
Occupation: Housewife<br />
Family: Mother/Father/2 Older Brothers (Ireland) Stepson/Stepdaughter <br />
Love Interest: Mike Kenwick (husband)<br />
<br />
With Aoife finished Jeff started thinking about the duration of his transformation instead of an hour long change for a 12 hour stay, Jeff was thinking of making the transition more like 10 minutes with Aoife staying round for a week that way Jeff could see when his father needed her the most and have his future transformation be set to those time. Also Jeff felt an hour long transformation was too much hassle so a 10 minute one was probably better with time management. As Jeff double confirm that his awareness would be off during his transformation but retain all the information he learned once he got back he decided it was time for Aoife to take the reigns.<br />
<br />
The first change Jeff felt was his body hair below his eyes vanished leaving his skin smoother than it has ever been before he suddenly felt his world getting smaller only realizing he was getting shorter and thinking how he was going to handle being so short, then thought why would he have to get used to being short this was alway his normal height. Next Jeff felt his muscles tingle as they expand and contrast into more feminine proportions as his frame compressed into well tone abs, smooth tough shoulders, an amazing thin waist and the rest of his muscles strengthen into beautiful tough organic fibers. As his arms were morphed into powerful thin pythons he began wondering where his breasts were until he sense the fat building up in his pecs the tissues turning into adipose, the nipples expanding the areoles becoming the size of silver dollars, Jeff started kneading the growing breast encouraging their growth while feeling the growing sensation of pleasure and sensitivity. Jeff has alway been proud of her bust considering it one of her most defining qualities. As her chest rested at a truly massive size for her small frame her legs started tensing up as the mass used in her previous height redistributed to form thick curvy legs with the muscles flowing like a river leading to her hips expanding into wide sexy feature causing her butt butt to plump up into a massive hard heart-shaped ass. At this point Aoife had two places on her body that had not change but not for long as her penis started to harden then shrink as her balls climbed into her body to form her womb and ovaries leaving the remains of once male appendage as a very female clitoris. Once Aoife was officially a woman her head finally changed as her neck lost it’s Adam’s apple leaving a high octave voice with a sweet Gaelic accent, her mouth then form lovely plump kissable lips to match her voice, her chin and brow lost its hard edges turning into smooth curves that now frame her softer cheeks, her eyes then brighten into a beautiful emerald color as they also form large round eyes and finally Aoife saw her most admired feature take shape as her dark short hair started lengthening into long thick curly locks the color brighten as a if it was lit aflame until a wild mane of bright red hair waved out of her head until gradually stopping midback. As her physical changes ended her clothes changed to fit her body her boxers shorten into a pair of black panties, her t-shirt shrunk around her breasts the fabric turning elastic the color darkening to form a tight fitting black sports bra with neon green highlights, her pants took a similar change to her shirt as the fabric became form fitting and elastic as her jeans turned into comfortable yoga pants same style as her bra. Now in a deep sweat Aoife has just finished her work out in her private gym (previously Jeff’s room) was now wondering what activity she should do with her husband since he has now just returned from work.</p>
