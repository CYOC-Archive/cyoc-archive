<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Looks like somewhere during the day the women started getting it, too, and the infection mutated to make some people pan, not just gay...!  ;)</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You picked a strange day to go to the beach.  You&#39;d expect to see <i>some</i> sexy bodies on display, but <i>this?</i>  Not only are more than half of the beachgoers scorching hot, every single one of the sexy beasts is dressed to show it off.  No board shorts, no unitards, just skimpy swimsuits stretched tight across well-proportioned bodies.  Was there an swimwear model convention in town you didn&#39;t know about?<br />
<br />
Even stranger is how obviously handsy they all are with each other.  It&#39;s like they can&#39;t be within arm&#39;s reach of each other without some kind of skin to skin contact, from something as simple as a brush of an arm, to lingering caresses, all the way up to overt gropes of chest or ass or bulge.  And they all look like they&#39;re into it.<br />
<br />
You mentally shrug.  They don&#39;t looks like they&#39;re bothering anyone, and if it makes them happy, you don&#39;t mind the extra eye-candy!  You try not to outright <i>stare</i>... but that&#39;s easier said than done.  Even as you claim your spot for the day and put down your bag, you see one man wave to another before walking up to casually grab a pec, first comparing its heft with his own chest, then running his thumb over the nipple.  The other man smiles, languidly enjoying the attention... before looking right at you as if he could feel your gaze.  His pleasure-drunk smile widens when his eyes lock with yours, as if you were some old friend he&#39;d been looking for, and he nods his head towards his partner in clear invitation.<br />
<br />
You quickly break eye contact and try not to blush, busying yourself with laying out your towel before slipping off your flip flops and fishing your board shorts out of your bag.  After taking a second to enjoy the sand between your toes, you head off for the restrooms to change, glancing back over your shoulder to see if the man is still looking your way.<br />
<br />
Which is why you don&#39;t see the off-white glob in the sand until your bare foot lands in it.  Turning back, you look at the goop now stuck to your skin.  At first you think it&#39;s sunscreen, but it&#39;s strangely sticky, and feels... eugh, did someone just... blow a huge load on the beach?  You quickly wipe your foot in the sand, but when you look to see if you got it all off, it&#39;s gone.  <i>Completely</i> gone, without leaving so much as a sticky residue.  You run your hand over the spot it had been, but it all either rubbed off or rubbed into your skin.  You don&#39;t see any signs of it in the sand, either, so... maybe it was sunscreen after all...?  You breathe a small sigh of relief, but you&#39;re <i>definitely</i> giving that foot an extra wash before you change.<br />
<br />
You&#39;ve only taken a few more steps towards when start to feel... strange.  Tingly all over.  You&#39;re not getting <i>horny</i>, exactly, but all the sexy people surrounding you are becoming more... distracting?  Obvious?  Just... <i>more</i>, as if the rest of the world is a little out of focus in comparison.  No matter where you look, your eyes snap from thick pecs to bubble butts to chiseled abs to generous tits, your vision refusing to settle on anything else.  You try not to pop a boner and pick up your pace a little, subtly unbunching your boxers to better cover your junk.<br />
<br />
It doesn&#39;t help that your pants are starting to slowly but surely slip down your hips with each step.  The knot in the drawstring must have come undone, and right now you don&#39;t trust yourself to stand here and re-tie it without ogling every hot passerby.  Instead you hold the waistband up at one hip, hiding your hand behind your board shorts and trying to make the pose look casual.<br />
<br />
The restroom is, thankfully, empty, but you stop short when you see yourself in the full-width mirror behind the sinks.  That&#39;s... something&#39;s off, isn&#39;t it?  You can feel yourself sinking further into a daze as you slowly approach your reflection, trying to put your finger on it.  <i>Was this t-shirt always this short?</i>  The fog building in your mind thickens.  <i>It wasn&#39;t... was it...?</i>  But whatever, you came in here to put on your swimsuit, so it&#39;s coming off anyway.<br />
<br />
&quot;Swimsuit&quot; sends your brain straight back to the hot, nearly naked bodies waiting just outside.  All those twunks, hunks, beauties, and bunnies, so tantalizingly close!  Just on the other side of the door....  The tingling builds, getting stronger the more your think about them.  You know, they all looked pretty approachable... maybe you <i>should</i> talk to one of them.  You could find out why they&#39;re all here.  Maybe they&#39;ll even share some of that casual contact.  Let you run your hands over their their tight, toned bodies....<br />
<br />
That thought sends a pulse through your dick, and you reach down to adjust it again.  Why are your boxer briefs so tight today?  <i>Wait, that....</i>  You concentrate.  Boxer <i>briefs...?</i>  Weren&#39;t you wearing boxers?  Do you even <i>own</i> boxer briefs...?  You try to remember, but thinking about underwear only brings your thoughts back again to the could-be underwear models all over the beach.  It&#39;s getting harder to think about anything else.<br />
<br />
You shake your head to try and clear it, and the room spins.  Staggering slightly, you grab the countertop with both hands to steady yourself, dropping your board shorts in the process.  A moment later your pants join them on the floor, your slimming waist too narrow to hold them up without your grip, and you stare in confusion at what they reveal.<br />
<br />
Tight against your skin is a pair of small red briefs.  You look down from the mirror, absently kicking aside your fallen pants as you run a finger across the material on your hip.  These... You... didn&#39;t remember putting on red today....  Even stranger, it looks like they&#39;re... shrinking...?<br />
<br />
More than just shrinking, though, the material is <i>changing</i>.  The as fly seals itself closed as you watch, the cotton fabric and elastic waistband merging to become a single piece of shiny red lycra.  You can feel the band on your hips creep lower while the leg holes creep up to meet it, revealing more and more of the smooth skin on your thickening thigh.  It&#39;s a speedo, you realize.  You&#39;re wearing a speedo.  At first that strikes you as odd, but a moment later you can&#39;t put your finger on why.<br />
<br />
The tingles you&#39;ve been feeling have built into a low, constant hum of arousal that permeates every part of your body.  It feels like a lover casually caressing all your erogenous zones at once.  Enough to make you half-hard, but not enough to push you further.<br />
<br />
Your gaze lands on the hem of your t-shirt as it starts to slowly rise up, your lengthening torso and broadening shoulders forcing it higher.  Slowly, it reveals more of your hardening abs and the beginnings of your Adonis belt.  At the same time, the speedo continues to creep lower, extending your new midriff.  The fabric on your hips stops at just under an inch wide, but the front continues down until it&#39;s <i>tantalizingly</i> close to the base of your dick, pulling the waistband into a slight curve and leaving no question that you&#39;re skin is smooth <i>all</i> the way down.<br />
<br />
You inspect your arms and find them as hairless as the rest of your body.  Your face, too, has not so much as a hint of stubble.  Your hair, though....  You hair is more full and shiny than you&#39;ve ever seen it, and long enough to frame your face.<br />
<br />
Your <i>very handsome</i> face.<br />
<br />
You look yourself up and down with new appreciation, taking in the brilliant aqua blue of your eyes.  Your high cheekbones and strong jawline.  The tightness of your shirt across your shoulders.  Your sexy new midriff.  Your powerful legs.  And that <i>bulge</i>!  Your arousal ratchets up another notch and you can&#39;t help but give yourself a quick grope, feeling how well your package fills out the pouch.<br />
<br />
As you take yourself in, you realize all at once that, holy shit, you&#39;re <i>hot</i>!  But... wait...  Why was that thought surprising?  You try to remember and come up blank.  Drinking in the sight of yourself in the mirror, it seems pretty obvious.<br />
<br />
The door opens and someone enters the restroom behind you.  You turn to see the man that caught you looking before you put down your towel.  He smiles that megawatt smile again when he sees you, and this time you make no attempt to look away from his hard, porn star body.  He&#39;s even hotter up close.  Seeing your obvious interest, he walks right up to you.  &quot;Welcome to the party, stud.  I was hoping you&#39;d join us...&quot;<br />
<br />
You try to form a coherent response, but only manage, &quot;I...  Who...?&quot;<br />
<br />
He quiets you with a gentle, &quot;shh...,&quot; holding a finger up in front of your lips.  &quot;Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;ll pass.  It&#39;s part of the change.&quot;  He gives you a second to you devour him with your eyes before he continues.  &quot;I saw you wiping off your foot.  Sorry about that.  Some of us,&quot; he laughs, gesturing broadly outside, &quot;don&#39;t know how virile we can be,&quot;  He makes a show of looking you up and down, and his smile turns seductive.  &quot;Can&#39;t argue with the results, though.  So,&quot; he moves a little closer.  &quot;How &#39;bout I help you along?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wh... what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve never had an orgasm like that one that&#39;s building in you now.  None of us had.  You can already feel it, right?  Well...&quot; he leans in, opening his arms to you, &quot;I want to be the one to take you there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your breath catches.  The lust in his voice is obvious, and it in an instant it pushes your arousal from a buzz to a blaze, a <i>need</i>, for the sexy beast in front of you.  Before you even realize you&#39;re doing it you crash your whole body into his, lips locking in a needy kiss.  He eagerly responds, grabbing your ass and pulling you against him to grind his bulge into yours.  His fingers grope and massage your cheeks as they firm and round, and the feeling of your hardening cock fighting for position with his is like nothing you&#39;ve ever felt before.<br />
<br />
Breaking this kiss, he turns you towards the mirror and stands behind you, leaning in to whisper, &quot;I want you to watch.&quot;  You shudder.  He licks up the shell of your ear, then continues.  &quot;I want you to see yourself change.&quot;  He starts to pull your shirt up, revealing your hardening body inch by sexy inch.  &quot;I want you to see just how much hotter...&quot;  He reaches your chest, ghosting his fingers over your nipples and sending a jolt straight to you dick.  &quot;...and harder...&quot;  He lifts it up and off.  &quot;...you get.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dropping the shirt with the rest of your clothes, he presses his chest into your back, getting as much skin-to-skin contact as possible.  &quot;Mmm, now isn&#39;t that better?&quot;  His hands come around, exploring your abs, and he makes a show of looking you up and down.  &quot;You wouldn&#39;t want to hide <i>all this</i> from the world, would you...?&quot;  He moans into your hair.  &quot;And you&#39;re still getting even hotter.&quot;<br />
<br />
He&#39;s right.  You look at yourself, all lithe power and sexy muscle, and you can see yourself changing.  Abs getting more defined.  Biceps swelling out.  Speedo bulging a little larger.  When his hands move to your nipples it&#39;s like they&#39;re hard-wired to your cock.  You moan softly as he circles your areola, watching as they grow to the width of his finger.  &quot;If you think <i>that</i> feels good,&quot; he says, &quot;just wait...&quot;<br />
<br />
Moving to your front, he plants a kiss on the pulse point just below your ear.  Then on the side of your neck.  Then just above your collarbone.  You gasp when he pushes his chest forward, raking his pebbled nipples across yours, before moving further down.  He takes his time, hands exploring the firming lines of your back as he slowly works his way towards your nipple.  When he finally envelopes it in his mouth, you moan more fully.  You thought you&#39;d been ready, but <i>this</i>....  You never knew a tongue could feel so good.  He moans too, clearly turned on by working you over.<br />
<br />
He flicks your nipple with the tip of his tongue as he starts kissing his way across one pec to the other, stopping to lick up and down the deepening ridge between them.  For a time he continues lavishing your chest and nipples with attention, moving back and forth between them as you chest slowly pushes further and further out.  Each time he swaps he licks along your cleft, and you can feel how much deeper, how much tighter its getting.<br />
<br />
You&#39;re lost to pleasure.  Gentle moans from you both fill the room as your world narrows to just the two of you.  His mouth, his tongue.  His skin against yours.  The slow growth of your muscles under his hungrily exploring hands.  The musk of sex you&#39;re each giving off.  He continues his journey down your torso, licking along each of the ridges in your now cobblestone 8-back.  His breath is hot on your skin when he says &quot;You taste...&quot;  Lick.  &quot;So good.&quot;  Lick.  &quot;Mnnf...,&quot; he nuzzles against you.  The sound you make when his tongue darts out to explore your belly button is somewhere between a moan and a gasp, which pulls a moan from him, too.  &quot;So good,&quot; he says again.<br />
<br />
When he reaches the speedo, he doesn&#39;t pull it down as you expect.  Instead he moves down and licks your balls <i>through</i> the speedo, working from one to the other before kissing and licking along the outline of your dick.  From there he presses his nose into the deep ridge of your Adonis belt and traces the line of it up to your hip, inhaling deeply and letting out a, &quot;Mmmmh,&quot; before licking his way back down.  &quot;You smell so good, too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Moving to your other side, he repeats the process, inhaling your scent on his way up and licking along ridge on the way back.  This time, though, when he reaches the speedo he pulls it down, letting your cock spring free.  It just misses smacking him in the cheek as he keeps following the ridge down past your waist, licking around the side of your cock and going straight to your sac.<br />
<br />
When your speedo stops you from widening your legs for him, he quickly pulls it down and off.  You&#39;ve barely stepped out of it when his hands find your ass, groping your perfect new bubble butt as he deftly pulls one of your balls into his mouth.  It feels incredible, as if each of his little sucks make you swell a bit more.  He moves between them, back and forth, and by the time he&#39;s done your nuts fill your sack, thick and heavy.<br />
<br />
Moving up to your shaft, he licks you from base to tip, only licking upwards, never back down.  Your moans come faster as he chooses a new stripe each time, working his way around you until he&#39;s covered every angle he can reach.  When he swirls his tongue around the ridge of your head, you make a desparite, needy noise.<br />
<br />
That&#39;s all the encouragement he needs, pulling you into his mouth with a moan that jolts through your cock.  One of his hands comes up to fondle your balls, and you love how fully you fill his palm.  The other closes around the base of your shaft, pumping in time with the blowjob.<br />
<br />
You&#39;re both moaning with almost every breath now.  Your dick plumps up a little more with each each bob of his head, gaining length and girth until it forces his fingers slightly apart.  Your partner&#39;s sexy sounds take on a new, needy edge that hits your right in your already supercharged libido.  He pops off your dick to lick around your balls again.  &quot;Please,&quot; he says, working his way around your base.  &quot;I need to taste you.&quot;  He starts working back up your shaft.  &quot;I need you to cum.&quot;  He licks around your head.  &quot;I need you to cum so bad.&quot;<br />
<br />
And then he takes you fully into his mouth, his lips to your skin as you slide against his throat.  Combined with his obvious lust for you, it topples you over the edge.  When he feels your balls tense up he brings both arms around you in a tight hug, locking himself against you as your hips writhe in ecstasy.<br />
<br />
You cum so hard you see stars.  He swallows around you, pulse after pulse, and not one drop escapes his talented lips.  The moment seems to stretch, each throb of your cock crashing over you with renewed force, until you finally come down.  Your partner slowly slides back, licking your tip clean as he slides off you.  The fog covering your mind burned away in the intensity of your orgasm, and you form what feels like your first complete sentence in what feels like hours.  &quot;That was amazing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was,&quot; he agrees.  When he stands, you see that working you over was enough to make him climax hands-free, the aftermath of his orgasm soaking his speedo.  He strips it off, cleaning up in the sink.<br />
<br />
Slipping your own speedo back on, you say, &quot;Nice of you to take care of my cleanup, too.&quot;<br />
<br />
He smiles at you in the mirror.  &quot;Anytime.&quot;  You smile back, gathering up your clothes while he slides back into his suit.  You wrap an arm around him to gently pull him against your side, and he leans into you.  &quot;Now...&quot; he says, &quot;How about we go enjoy the beach?  I have some friends who would love to meet you...&quot;<br />
<br />
You smile wide as you head for the door together. &quot;Can&#39;t wait!&quot;</p>
