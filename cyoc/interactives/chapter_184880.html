<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The demon hunter cursed under his breath as he was briefly bathed in the light of Niamh&#39;s amulet. That gemstone had been a gift to the girl from Adie, something to protect the little airhead as she stumbled through her training and work at the shop. It offered a great deal of protection against external magical forces, protecting her from such things as mental manipulation or transformational spells... but it could do little against anything which she willingly ingested. If something had been able to corrupt it, then the sheer amount of magical potential she might now wield was... <i>frightening</i>.<br />
<br />
Raize could take comfort in the fact that the gem seemed to have been turned towards a purpose besides endless destruction. What he could not find any comfort in was the surge of mystical energy that rocked his body, causing him to briefly cry out and stumble against a nearby shelf. The energy from the gem was cascading through him, embedding itself in his very being, and already he could feel its occult tendrils tugging and pulling at his flesh while Niamh and Terri stared in ditzy enthrallment. He held little ill will towards the Irish girl, but at times, he could understand why so many hated her.<br />
<br />
This magic was a powerful thing, and it attacked him first in the mind. Decades of psychic defenses found themselves under an assault far greater than any demon had subjected them to, the barriers in his head clawing and fighting against something desperate to get through, desiring to change him at his very core. With desperation, the walls in his psyche tried to hold back this force of change, and for the most part succeeded... except for one little switch it managed to pull. Raize felt it shift instantly before the force was banished from... <i>her</i> mind. Hers. Raize was... a woman. Had she always been a woman, deep down, trapped in the body of some grizzled demon hunter? Had this been forced upon her by the magical changes, or had it simply forced her to admit something she&#39;d always known?<br />
<br />
She was unsure of this, but it was impossible to deny a certain sort of... comfort, she supposed, as the magic turned its attention to her body. Her hair, a short-cropped gray mop, instantly began to lengthen, falling down to her shoulders and turning to a color every bit as silver as the bullets that she had once used to hunt maddened werewolves. She turned to a mirror behind the counter, watching as her face, angular, jagged, masculine, began to soften. Wrinkles smoothed out, her jaw just slightly shrunk, her blue eyes regained a certain youthful vigor. Her features became womanly, especially her lips, but they retained a certain rugged handsomeness, a sort of raw strength and roughness evident even though her scraggly beard had fallen out.<br />
<br />
The long trenchcoat she wore began to shrink around her as the muscles she so often employed also reduced themselves to something more slender. Strangely, she didn&#39;t feel as if her strength had waned - only that it was in a smaller package. Not even smaller, in fact, as she was certain she could feel her legs lengthening slightly, pushing her just a tiny bit taller. With the muscle that remained, still well-defined, she would have under the clothing a physique that bordered between athletic and amazonian, a perfect blend of natural grace with raw power, all covered by well-tanned skin that had lost all the wrinkles of old age.<br />
<br />
Yet she knew the greatest changes were yet to come. These occurred in her chest, the pectoral muscles once shaped into thick squares now rounding out, bulging and pushing against her shirt, redistributed muscle reforming into the fat of an ample, supple bosom. Compared to the enormity of the endowments on Terri and Niamh, they were miniscule, but by a normal human&#39;s standards, she was busty, pratically bursting out of her shirt - not to mention delightfully sensitive. Only years of discipline kept her from groping herself, tugging at her nipples and basking in the feeling of breast-flesh spilling out between her squeezing fingers.<br />
<br />
She did, however, falter into grasping at her rear end as it began to thicken, forming a noticeably bubble-esque shape. Her thighs remained thick - not with fat, but with muscle. She had the posterior and lower half of an olympic athelete, reflecting her former body&#39;s excellent physical conditioning while yet proving to be drool-worthy - literally, she glanced behind herself to see the two girls drooling over her body. It hurt her heart, seeing this girls reduced to slobbering creatures of pure lust - whoever was responsible for putting them in this state would be made to suffer dearly, Raize had already decided. <br />
<br />
From her rear the magic surged to the front for its grand finale, and instead of feeling something grow, she felt it shrinking. A moderately-sized member and accompanying balls that had always been described by others as being made of steel instantly was yanked within her, the flesh melting away as it was reshaped into a tight, welcoming entrance. She had felt pleasure at the other changes, excitement even, but this... this brought... <i>liberation</i>. As if a mistake in nature had finally been corrected, and for the first time in her entire life, she suddenly felt comfortable. At peace. Her body, she thought, matched her soul for the first time.<br />
<br />
As she stared at her reflection, basking in the comfort, Niamh was quickly upon her, hugging the hunter from behind. &quot;Oh shay begorra, ye&#39;re so hoooooooot!&quot; She grinned, making an effort to pull down Raize&#39;s pants that she had to swat away. &quot;Ye&#39;re like, such a MILF! I wanna taste ye so bad!&quot; Terri was right on her heels, practically climbing over the other girl to get at Raize before the hunter shoved them both back. <br />
<br />
&quot;We have precious little time for such things, girls.&quot; Her voice had softened - still powerful and authoritative, still rough, but the masculinity had vanished. Even the harshness towards the two had gone away, replaced by a sense of sympathy for these poor women. &quot;I must prepare a concotion that will cleanse your minds, and then, perhaps, we can get to the bottom of this.&quot; She couldn&#39;t help but sway her hips just a bit as she walked past Terri and Niamh to check the aisles for something useful. Deep down, she had to admit, this youthful viality now coursing through her veins... there was a part of her that was desperate to explore it, to throw away her vows to the Divine Orders and indulge in carnal pleasure with the mindless beings of lust these girls had become.</p>
