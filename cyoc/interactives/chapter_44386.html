<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I think I want to sleep on that tonight!&quot; I laugh, meaning without his undershirt, fingering Drew’s nipples as I continued to rub my hands through it all. I had been just teasing about calling him 'teddy bear,' but it seemed that he really was one hell of a bear. He smiled &quot;Wanna see the whole package then?&quot; He pulled his shirt back, exposing his body. Now in full view, I could see what Drew had been hiding under his shirt. ‘Unfortunately,’ he thought; ‘I had hair which went beyond my chest to my shoulders, some very light but visible hair on my back as well towards either side of the middle, but not on my spine.’ Drew’s lower back was also hairy, which blended into the fur I already knew was there. &quot;Wow..&quot; I said with the same awe in my voice that was heard when I opened the fridge, &quot;See? I didn’t I tell you, you were sexy?&quot; I grinned, tearing my eyes away from his chest up to his face. He grinned, he was the whole package then, he thought, ’Mountains of muscular beef and hair, everything I seemed to wish for in a boyfriend.’ He took my finger to my happy trail, &quot;And that’s all you got, twink?&quot; <br />
<br />
	&quot;Well... if you're my boyfriend, then I'd say I have a lot more.&quot; I grin mimicking Drew and putting my finger on his own happy trail. He chuckled &quot;I suppose you do now!&quot; He continued playing with the hairs on my stomach as he leaned forward to kiss me. I let go of him to grab his meaty bum, pressing up against him as we kiss. I was getting more and more comfortable around him and was starting to get a bit more daring. Drew copied me, grabbing my own ass as his hard on began to show through his boxers. My own boner was pressed up hard against Drew‘s, but that wasn't my intent, it was just impossible for me to not get hard with Drew so close to me. I only really wanted to hug you and I was loving how well he kissed. This was something I expected would happen a lot and never get old.<br />
<br />
	He kissed my neck, enjoying having someone to kiss as he slipped his hands down the back of my boxers leaving his thumbs out while he began to rub my ass cheeks like before in the bed. Once we stopped kissing for a moment, with Drew half a head above me, I smiled and whispered to him, &quot;Thanks... Sir.&quot; I smiled, deliberately saying 'Sir' this time. Drew just smiled and accepted my thanks with his hands still down the back feeling the heat coming off of my ass. &quot;You’re very welcome&quot; I pressed my face against him, looking up with a huge grin as I listened to his heartbeat. I never wanted to leave this house and I never wanted to leave Drew.<br />
<br />
	He slid his hands up my back, despite his familiar urge to fuck me again, he resisted as this is supposed to be a 'tender' moment. &quot;Are you this horny all the time?&quot; I smirk, moving my hands up to his shoulder blades. Feeling his stiff piece of meat against my own. &quot;Apparently only around you!&quot; He grinned pulling his chest away a bit to see my face but pushing his crotch further into mine. &quot;So I guess that means you like me, huh?&quot; I chuckle, holding Drew at arms length as well and keeping his gaze. &quot;Hell yeah!&quot; His hands slid back down, just above my waist band.<br />
<br />
	I smirk, &quot;Well good, 'cause I like you too. Even if you are a bit rough.&quot; I smile as we pull ourselves back into a tight embrace. &quot;Speaking of which...&quot; He grinned, &quot;You wanna bend over for me again?&quot; He was just gonna go for it. He wanted me so bad after feeling my ass, for God knows how many times now. I frown for just a second before smiling again, &quot;Sure, Drew.&quot; I say, putting a hand down at his waistband and looking up at him. He stopped me, holding my wrist from going further &quot;What’s wrong? You don’t want to?&quot; Drew had caught my frown, being able to read people well after all his time on the force. &quot;Yeah, of course.&quot; I grin, trying not to disappoint him. 'Better what he wants than what I want.' I told myself and I believed it. &quot;You don’t want to do 'it,' then I don’t want to do it to you.&quot; He smiled. &quot;But I am horny... so how are we going to fix this?&quot; <br />
<br />
	I look confused until what he had said registered. Blinking, I grin. Now that he had let go of my wrist, I kept just my thumb under his waistband and slowly slid across to his front, just above his crotch and making sure I was touching skin the entire time. Drew smiled &quot;Well... you have a sexual fantasy... so tell me what it is?&quot; though part of him is afraid of my answer and knows he didn’t like to go out of his box. The other half wanted to have fun with me either way. I grin and say, &quot;I wanna get you off without my hands…. Or your hands&quot; Deliberately, I left out the rest of the fantasy, feeling that he wouldn't want to do it.<br />
<br />
	&quot;So just jerking me?&quot; He joked &quot;You’re not very imaginative!&quot;  <br />
<br />
	&quot;I said, without using my hands.&quot; I smirked, putting my hand on Drew’s as he rubbed my arm.<br />
<br />
	&quot;Still..&quot; he moved down to my clothed member, feeling my girth through my underwear. <br />
<br />
	I smile back at you. &quot;Still what?&quot; I ask, a bit teasingly as I felt the intimate touch of a hand other than my own touching me once again, Drew’s hand.<br />
<br />
	&quot;What do you plan on using then?&quot; He grinned, thinking of only one thing could do the trick. <br />
<br />
	&quot;Well, maybe if I got you so excited...&quot; I grinned back, not wanting to directly say that I wanted to fuck him. Drew was so hairy, so masculine, he just made feel such a primal lust for him. &quot;Maybe .. like in the station holding cell?&quot; He was referring to how he felt when he popped that random pill. I smirk, &quot;Heh.. I dunno what you took, but you were pretty crazy in there.&quot; &quot;Yeah, I didn’t seem to mind that.&quot; He laughed, thinking about how in the shower he noticed that he now sported two bar shaped bruises from that night. &quot;What was it anyways? You were... different later, I guess when it wore off…&quot; I said, talking about his wild start and his tender end. &quot;I took a pill from the drug bag to calm down.... guess it had a different effect&quot; He was still playing with my package.<br />
<br />
	&quot;The drug bag...?&quot; I was surprised, but I was more turned on by his hand than I was shocked. &quot;Yeah, the drug bag.&quot; He chuckled, &quot;I’m a cop, but that doesn’t mean I can’t take a pill... it was just a pill…&quot; He seemed to be trying to justify his reasons. &quot;Uh, maybe we should take a closer look at those pills before we just randomly take some.&quot; I smirk, but worried if whatever he had took might hurt him later on. &quot;Well.. Alright. There, on the table.&quot; He pointed, guiding me there. When I turned around to go, he pressed his dick against my cheeks until I moved away. <br />
<br />
	I turned a bit just to give Drew a look, a grin, before accidentally bumping into the table. &quot;Oh shit!&quot; I jump, trying to catch what I can as the bags fall over, spilling their contents and pills everywhere. &quot;Ah! Look at what you did!&quot; even though Drew knew it was probably just as much his fault as it was mine, so he wasn’t angry. I bent down to scoop up what had spilled on the floor as he helped. Thankfully, his floors were hardwood in the kitchen and dining areas. Plus, he cleaned his floors a few days ago, so they were good. <br />
<br />
	We managed to get all the pills back on the table and into their bags, ignoring the pieces of paper that fell out of each bag for now since they all seemed to say the same thing. We had no clue if the pills were back in their proper bags, since all the pills seemed to be a random color; blues, reds, greens, yellows, whites. Giving Drew an 'I'm sorry' smile, I grabbed one of the pieces of paper and handed it to him as I got another to read for myself.</p>
