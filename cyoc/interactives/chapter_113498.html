<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">David wasn’t exactly what’d you picture when the word ‘surfer’ pops into your head but here he was out at sunrise on the beach, his wetsuit hanging off his 5’2” skeletal frame, short black hair dripping water over his plain face. He’d taken up surfing when he was 10 and now at 17 he had to admit he was pretty damn good at it… for his size. Not that anyone at school knew about his hobby, David was one of those guys who just blended in at school, average looks, average grades, little confidence. 6 months after school was over he doubted anyone would even remember he existed.<br />
<br />
A scientist peered down at David from a cliff above, this kid was perfect, certainly skilled, per documents they’d acquired surfing was his passion, as much as someone as bland as David could be passionate about something. He loved this job he thought to himself as he snapped 10 pictures of David and attached them to an e-mail filled with David’s personal information. One day he’d ask his boss how the reality altering side of things was handled but he wasn’t sure if he really wanted to know. As he heard the beep signifying the e-mail was sent the scientist looked through the scope of his modified tranquilizer rifle and fired.<br />
<br />
David yelped as he felt a stabbing in his back, his bony hand reached behind and felt a small cylinder sticking out his back, he yanked it out and stared at it, it was a glass tube, almost like a syringe and it was empty. He frantically looked around, spotting no-one around him, there were no marking on the cylinder at all either. Standing up he felt lightheaded, what the hell is this? More importantly what was inside it? He unzipped the top of his wetsuit and pulled it down to his stomach and began to feel around his back but there was nothing to be felt, just his shoulder blades jutting out like usual. If he’d been able to see behind him he would have noticed a small circle of darkly tanned skin where the dart had hit him which was slowly beginning to spread across his back.<br />
<br />
As panic began to rush through him his heartrate increased, the blood pumping faster and faster sending the serum coursing through his body. His eyes dilated as his panic subsided he felt almost… stoned. Not that he knew what that felt like, did he? Maybe if he got in the water, swam around a bit he’d feel a bit more clear headed. As he walked the 8 feet to the water the footprints he left in the sand grew with each step, his size 6 feet jumping up a size with each foot he covered until his size 14s plopped into the water, he let out another yelp as he stepped on a shell and looked down, grabbing his leg to look at the bottom of his foot and see if he’d cut it. Out of all the things that could be big on him why did it have to be his feet? He looked like a clown. A memory flashed through his head of himself at 15, Melissa, a girl he had a severe crush on had started asking him if “what they say is true” and pulled him off into a closet, “You show me yours, I’ll show you mine” she said, David had never seen another cock so assumed his 5 inches was respectable and his hormones were rushing so he did as he was asked. Melissa ran out of the closet laughing, they never spoke again.<br />
<br />
As he thought about this he began to feel a pressure from his groin and grabbed at his package as his cock began to snake down the leg of his wetsuit, a obvious 10” python hanging down to his knee…. His balls churned and doubled in size until what was a loose section of wetsuit was now skin-tight. He grinned thinking back to Melissa’s face when he unfurled his beast in that closet, her jaw almost cartoonishly dropping to the floor. That was when the casual sex began, not often but once ever few months, completely in secret of course Melissa didn’t want anyone to know she was fucking David the shrimp but she had to admit he knew how to use his appendage. Of course, David went along, his low confidence telling him that this was the best he was gonna get. <br />
<br />
He let out a moan as he rubbed his shaft through his wetsuit, thinking about Melissa’s perfect tits, precum leaking “Shit, gotta keep it under control, god knows who could walk onto the beach.” So he started to go deeper into the water, hoping a bit of cooling off would help him. He walked in until he was up to his torso and as he stepped forward again his body began to stretch upwards, his chest continually staying above the water as he took step after step, his wetsuit began to tear round his pelvis as he passed 6’. The tan had spread over the entire back of his body and was now spreading forward, as it covered his stomach small hairs began to push out, a treasure trail forming, his sparse pubes thickening. He dove forward and began to swim, his flipper feet propelling his now 6’5” body along rather quickly, as he kicked his legs the wetsuit gave way. He didn’t notice. <br />
<br />
David was still thinking about Melissa, their sessions were getting more and more common ever since he hit this growth spurt, he could tell she really had a thing for him towering over her 5’9” body, I mean he knew he wasn’t her ideal, he saw the fleeting look of disgust whenever he took off his t-shirt, his ribcage showing but she kept coming back for… what was it she called it? The beast? Last time though it all went a bit wrong, Melissa… no Missy, that was his pet name for her told him about a dream she had where she was fucking someone and they picked her up and rag dolled her around the room like a piece of meat. The idea didn’t exactly appeal to David but he decided to attempt it during their next &#39;fun time&#39;…. And he dropped her after 10 seconds, not able to support her for any major length of time. He didn’t really have it in him anyway, Missy clearly wanted an animal of a lover and David was just…. too nice.<br />
<br />
He began to swim harder, trying to push the memory from his head, with each rotation his arms did they pulsed slowly outwards, the tiny hills of his biceps beginning to rise. Faster and faster he swam as his shoulders cracked wider, his former pole like shape turning into a firm V. With each breath his chest shot forward as if someone was using an air pump. His whole torso began to thicken, his skeletal abs disappear and then 5 seconds later real abs begins to push out, first faint mounds and then harsh cobblestones. His flat ass began to inflate into a bubble butt of pure muscle as his quads and calves thickened, a dusting of blonde hair cascading down them as the two twigs became firms tree trunks. He turned back towards shore and shot off at great speed, I mean this was his morning routine, right? Gotta get a good pump going first thing, helps to wash some of last night off him anyway. Dave smirked as he thought about the hour that him and Missy spent last night, never staying in one spot for more than a minute as he carried her around her full house, her body bucking against his 8 pack. He had to admit they made a pretty good couple and thank god he had the height, muscles and the beast to make up for his face. His whole body widened by a few inches as he stood up on the shore, the sun glistening off ever firm curve of muscle. He waltzed over to his pile of shit with a newfound swagger, not even caring that he was naked, he worked for this body… might as well show it off, right? He looked down and rubbed his shelf-like pecs, tan was looking good… of course if he had a mirror he’d have noticed it stopped right at his still thin neck and uninspiring face. He heard his phone ring in the distance and quickly picked it up.<br />
<br />
“Hey Missy” On other end of the line Melissa flinched, sometimes she forgot just how nasally Dave’s voice was, there was a reason she said no talking during sex. “Hey handsome, you left without saying goodbye, I’m guessing you’re down the beach?” “Yeah of course I a…” Dave doubled over as a severe coughing fit overtook him, his bodyfat fell an extra few percent, his muscles popping out even more as the tan began to run up his neck, his traps rising like dough as his neck thickened, his non-existant Adam’s Apple surged forward as his vocal chords lengthened, the fit passed “Shit babe sorry, must have swallowed some crap in the ocean” his voice was now a silky smooth baritone with a slight lilt to it, you could tell just from his voice that Dave didn’t have many worries in the world. Melissa smiled hearing the sexy voice of her lover “You’re coming back today for round 2 right? My parents are away until tomorrow” she purred. The part of Dave that was still a shy tiny kid wanted to scream yes but something told him this wasn’t right…. “Nah Missy, me and my bros are gonna chill out on the beach tonight. ‘sides I thought we both agreed this wasn’t a serious thing, right? We both wanna fuck around and shit… right?” She hung up.<br />
<br />
Dave chuckled as he sat back on the beach, he didn’t exactly like having that conversation with girls but you know he was a free spirit and shit, didn’t wanna be tied down to anyone, who would looking like him? He pulled a pair of board shorts over his gargantuan quads and reached into the pocket pulling a blunt out, he smirked as he lit it, gazing out over the sun. As he puffed on the blunt his thin lips began to puff up, his round, childish face began to shift under the skin, his cheekbones pushing outward as his jaw began to sharpen, his circular face turning into a rectangle as his hair began to slowly grow out from his head becoming shaggier and shaggier. As the high hit Dave he could feel… something slipping away… he wasn’t sure what though… Eh probably didn’t matter, all that really mattered to Dave was his waves, his body and banging any dude or babe he could and…. And not much else to be honest. Shit there’s a reason he left school, well 2, when you’ve fucked every hot thing going (including some teachers) you’re best to leave before shit turns into a war over you and more importantly he just didn’t care, once puberty hit school just didn’t seem to matter all that much. He chuckled again as he stood up, throwing his finished blunt in the sand and running the other hand through his thick hair as lantern jaw stopped shifting. He rubbed his thick lips, blowjob lips he’d heard someone call them, he liked that… he liked anything that reminded him of just how fucking sexy he was though. He looked up at the sky and the sun blinded him for a moment.<br />
<br />
“Hey Dave, you with us?” Dave blinked and looked around, spotting the photographer on the shore with his camera, better stay focused, this modelling session was gonna pay for his next month. “Shit dude sorry kinda zoned out there huh?” “Its cool just give us a few more poses, these photos are gonna be a hit!”</p>
