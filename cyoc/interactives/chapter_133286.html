<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">She was as more eager than she has ever been for anything in her life that Gloria continued to stare at the app before it finally opened. Gloria loved the idea of being something she wasn&#39;t that thanks to the Transformation Resort, she was now able to with a passion. As it was loading up that a large red &#39;test&#39; popped up on the screen when she noticed the info of the nanites while she looked at what it said.<br />
<br />
“If operations are normal that you will feel another warmth internally as the nanites switch to active mode to receive instruction. Do not panic, this is normal as it will subside momentarily. For optimal operations that it is recommended for the user to test the app, before they are preformed in a transformation(s) in which may cause any modifications.&quot;<br />
<br />
Figuring the discretion was a better part of valor, (particularly where her ultimate fantasy was concerned) that after Gloria tapped the button is when A countdown timer appeared as it was counting down from five. loading up as it took A few minutes had passed, but when it reached zero that Gloria started to feel the full body warmth of the nanites as expected. soon after, A message appeared on the screen that More text appeared with the following down below it.<br />
<br />
&quot;All systems are fully functional. the Nanites are functioning normally. standing by.... ..... ... Standard form found.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gloria looked at the screen when it blipped for a moment. it wasn&#39;t long though when a silhouette of her body came onscreen. finding dropboxes with her body measurements in them that a Bright green text highlighted several of her factors on screen, which was also completed with helpful arrows.<br />
STANDARD FORM:<br />
<br />
Sex: Female<br />
Age: 31<br />
Breast Size: 32CC<br />
Hair:Black<br />
Eyes:Ice Blue<br />
Height: 5 Feet, Seven Inches<br />
Weight: 135<br />
Muscle Density: Low-Moderate<br />
Race: Caucasian-Hispanic mix<br />
<br />
Two tabs soon popped up below as they both said &#39;confirm&#39; and &#39;modify&#39;. Though she couldn&#39;t help but think what fun she might be able to have by altering her appearance that Gloria didn&#39;t want to take the risk of tampering any of the sensations to her first time by hurting herself of injuries later. with the allure of testing out something minor things was definitely real, like changing her eye color that she confirmed the info was correct and tapped on the &#39;confirm&#39; button and moved onto the next options, which took her to a new screen with more text.<br />
<br />
TRANSFORM TO:<br />
<br />
SPECIES: As she started tapping in the blank next to it that She first put down reptilian when her phone&#39;s keypad came up. Typing in reptilian brought up a second sub-tab that let her pick from being a bipedal, or quadrupedal. She quickly picked bipedal and typed it in to find herself getting somehow more aroused as Gloria felt her panties were damped and soaking in anticipation.<br />
<br />
shortly after, A quick bar text informed her the option she&#39;d picked out was a &#39;standard transformation subroutine with no additional nanites required&#39;. she felt a bit sad as she wanted more to be on the safe side, but that&#39;s not how they work as she understood and got over it. more texts soon after appeared before her.<br />
<br />
SCALE COLOR/DENSITY: Gloria thought long and hard and settled on shadow green (really dark green) as She saw that she could actually have given herself hair, but decided to leave it out and become hairless. even though she was born and raised with her hair that she thought it would be silly and unappealing to have it on a reptilian creature, so she didn&#39;t add it in to her Transformation as she also thought about feathers and decided not to add them ether. on her option for density as it ranged from none to ultra-thick that she chose the option of having it on a standard-thick level, instead of having a different type of density.<br />
<br />
EYE COLOR: Instead of simply letting her pick a basic color that soon A color wheel popped up. she spun around looking for an eye color for a while till she found the one she liked. she found a stunningly bright yellow with a hint of brown in them, to fit her reptilian theme settings<br />
<br />
TRANSFORMED HEIGHT: This option stun her in surprismant. She was amused as she could actually become smaller, or bigger that She didn&#39;t think this could be possible. most people in the world would want this to happen to them that so did a a part of Gloria, but chose to stay with her 5 foot as she slightly changed her height for 7 inches and lowers it down to a mere 5 inch shorter. to cut it short, instead of having her height stand being at 5&#39;7” that she was going to have her new height be at 5&#39;2&#39;&#39;<br />
<br />
TRANSFORMED WEIGHT: Gloria knew she works out as she weighed 135 pounds that she changed it and put it down as 75 lbs. heavier. She never thought she was that heavy as she wanted a certain amount of muscle mass, but weighing at 210 lbs. is where she then thought of having the same weight as one of those well fit WWE world diva wrestlers. She&#39;d found out a certain amount of her transformation artwork went to her muscles that she mostly stayed feminine, for her tastes.<br />
<br />
BREAST SIZE: this is where both &#39;primary&#39; and &#39;complementary&#39; popped up on screen with a text message. &quot;warning! do to becoming a reptilian creature, your complementary breast size (A.K.A) your teats as they&#39;ll be mostly covered by your scales that your options for it is restricted as none. we apologize for your misunderstanding and hope you have a wonderful day&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;well that suck.&quot; she thought, but didn&#39;t really care for them as she went strait to her primaries. She DID like the idea of her boobs around, however, she decided to make a big sacrifice with her breast size down to 00 AAs. She thought long and hard about this as she wasn&#39;t averse to the idea of female reptiles not having proper breasts, but It was a sacrifice she was willingly to making that Gloria was making herself ready by feeling the need to declare her manliness in her first change.<br />
<br />
KEEP TORSO/HIP/LEG/ARM RATIO CONSISTENT WITH STANDARD MEASUREMENTS?: She clicked yes as she was hopping to be out of her proportion overall. Being being manly was one thing on her mind, but having strong musculus arms and legs, or narrow hips would be moderately pleasant and possibly sexy to those who would try hooking up with her. if she would tried to hook up with someone that it was most likely to be a 90% chance woman that it would almost be a at least very small chance to be able on hooking up with any guy, if she wanted too. <br />
<br />
PLEASURE-PAIN RATIO: There was a bit simple as there were two sliders. One with pleasure on the left as pain was fully on the right that While Gloria didn&#39;t want to mush pain, she certainly didn&#39;t wanted a good experience of pleasure ether. with that in mind, she wasn&#39;t going to let it happen on her first time as she slid both pain and pleasure down till pain reached 65 percent and pleasure to a mere 35 that the screen made an issue about having it no lower then the percentage of 100. maybe later she&#39;d can change the settings later.<br />
<br />
GENITAL SENSITIVITY: She wondered if this applied only during the change, or only after the transformation in her  reptilian form, or some combination of the two. “well, i&#39;m not completely sure what this is about, but there&#39;s Only one way to find out.” she said to herself quietly. It didn&#39;t take a genius to figure out what the popular options were as the lowest setting were &#39;dulled&#39;, then &#39;normal&#39;, that it went all the way up to &#39;ultra-heightened&#39;. even though Gloria was intrigued on how just explosives her orgasm might be with the setting at there highest that she was a woman who already has the most powerful orgasms there is to begin with. naturally sensitive, She Gloria quickly decided to change that by setting it all the way down to normal for now.<br />
<br />
TRANSFORMATION ONSET CAUSED BY: This was another drop-down menu, featuring a wide array of options, from app-activation (presumably meaning using the phone to authorize it), to penetration, to stimulation, to beverage (specify) or light levels, or even &#39;spoken word(s)&#39; (self) as there was also &#39;spoken word(s)&#39; (outside party). Just seeing all the different ways she could make herself transform just made her juices keep on flowing that She couldn&#39;t help but rub the heel of her hands against the crotch of her jeans while her arousal surged along with her imagination. Even more intriguing to it was the &#39;other&#39; option.<br />
<br />
&quot;please type in keyword (s) implying that the program had the ability to figure out what you wanted, or could somehow facilitate it&quot;. it said as she soon decided the change option by choosing with a set of spoken word (s) on self. A microphone symbol appeared after on screen as she recorded her words, so that she could easily change into her reptilian form. though it may sound silly to some, but to her, it was perfect. &quot;reptilian life, activate!&quot;<br />
<br />
DURATION IN TRANSFORMED SHAPE BEFORE REVERSION: She had the option of setting a number of minutes, or she could leave it as &#39;until reversion triggered&#39;, or even both if she wanted to. She decided to set it under as, &#39;until reversion triggered&#39;. She wasn&#39;t sure on what she might be feel like doing after she&#39;d changed, but she figured she&#39;d play it safe as She could always alter things the second time around.<br />
<br />
REVERSION TO STANDARD SHAPE TRIGGERED BY: It was an identical menu to the &#39;onset caused by&#39; option she&#39;d encountered earlier as she paused that she soon after grinned. Gloria was already thinking about herself in her new reptilian form as she knew by now already that she&#39;d would most likely explore her body. setting in the reversal words that she thought of a good one, for a choice of words. &quot;Reptilian, power down.&quot;<br />
<br />
TAIL LENGTH/WINGSPAN: She always wanted a tail that she sets it to be 3 feet long. as for the wingspan as she didn&#39;t want wings that there was an option of not having wings and signed it up... hopefully she doesn&#39;t have to worry about flight as she&#39;s scared of heights.<br />
<br />
HANDS/FEET: focusing on her hands first that There were only two options as they show both &#39;Talons&#39; and &#39;Hands&#39;. It showed a picture of a hand first as it was all covered in scales with small like claws at the end of her fingers, instead of nails. seeing the other picture of her talons that it show three finger talons that there was one large finger like appendage, marking the end of what look like the claws of a raptor. not wanting to struggle with her talon hands that She selected &#39;hands&#39; and moved down the next part of the list. like before though, she selected feet instead of talons that she moved on to the next part of the list.</p>
