<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Marco soon came out of the shower area….stark naked and holding the towel in his hand.  He was a little shocked to see the four boys standing by his locker waiting for him.  While never an overly modest person, Marco felt a little strange being naked in front of the two teens he had just met.<br />
<br />
“Hey you still don’t believe that Peter is a Wizard, do you?” Ric asked Marco, in front of everybody.<br />
<br />
“There is no such thing as magic and there are no Wizards!” Marco shortly said back to Ric, as he was beginning to feel annoyed by all his questions and remarks. Then Ric walked up to Peter and asked the tall basketball player to bend forward so that Ric could whisper something in his ear.<br />
<br />
“You want me to do that to him?” Peter asked Ric.<br />
<br />
“Yes, please do it! Do it right now!” Ric answered with a wide grin on his face.<br />
<br />
“I hope you’re not getting me into trouble, Ric!” Peter wondered out loud.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry, Peter. And if they get upset, just use your power to control their mind and to make them forget all about it!” Ric replied. Peter just stared at Marco as he pulled his gym bag out of the locker and began to pull out his clothes.<br />
<br />
“You still don’t believe me, huh?” Ric said to Marco, who was now sorting his street clothes on the bench and throwing his wet Speedo and towel into the bag.<br />
<br />
“Look, Ric… There is no such thing as a Wizard! You only see Wizards in fairy tales!” Marco replied, as he stood there nude and slowly began to shrink down in height. Ric and Josh both giggled as they watched Marco slowly regress back from being a 25 year-old man to his late teens.<br />
<br />
“Nobody can be a Wizard these days. They don’t exist, and nobody has the ability to walk around and change people with their magic…” Marco continued to tell the boys, while he was unaware of the fact that he was now looking like a 16 year-old teenager.  His chest hair had regressed to a small patch in the middle of his chest.<br />
<br />
“Peter can!…I bet he’s even wizard enough to change your age!”, Ric said back to nude teen. Marco was so intent on getting Ric to stop with his wild story that didn’t even have getting dressed on his mind.<br />
<br />
“There is no such thing as magic, trust me, okay?” Marco said, as his arms and legs lost their muscle and became shorter and thinner. Both Josh and Ric chuckled at the younger looking Marco.  His chest hair was now gone.  His arm pit hair now consisted of small strands of hair in patches under each arm….and there was just a small patch of pubic hair above Marco’s penis.  His goatee was now down to just a few chin whiskers.  His 13 year old voice started to crack, but Marco didn’t notice…Peter had made it so he would not comprehend his change until Peter was ready for him to comprehend.<br />
<br />
“Nobody is so powerful that they can make someone grow older or younger…” Marco continued, as he now resembled a little 12 year-old boy, who was about as big as Josh…with a body just as smooth and void of hair…his goatee now non existent on his smooth chin. <br />
<br />
“Even in the old days… Magicians used potions and herbs to perform their magic tricks, but these were all based on myths…” Marco said, as his voice began to sound higher than before. He clearly began to sound like a little kid. He looked like he was about 8 years-old.<br />
<br />
“Wizards who can do these things with their minds don’t exist…” Marco announced, as he was slowly regressing into a 6 year-old as his torso, legs and arms had become considerably shorter than they were just moments earlier.<br />
<br />
“Now, will you guys let me get dressed?  Can’t a man have SOME privacy?”, Marco asked Ric.  Ric, Josh and even Salvador began to giggle….such a big statement from a little three year old little boy.  Ric looked at Marco, “A man might get some privacy, but what if Peter turned you into a little boy, Marco?”<br />
<br />
Marco was quickly passing the three-year mark down to toddler hood as Ric darted his eyes to Peter to signal that Marco should become aware of his fate.  Peter let Marco realize his fate just as he was heading into the last stages of his regression.<br />
<br />
“No Wizard can make me grow little, there is… I can’t… ME LITTLE BOY…NO…. no magic boy…magic boy no real…me turning into…Goo goo gah gah…gooooohh!” Marco said, as he was now a nine month old little baby who suddenly lost his ability to speak properly. <br />
<br />
Ric and Josh gasped in amazement and turned around to look at Peter, who was leaning with his shoulder against the locker room door, with his hands in the front pockets of his basketball shorts.<br />
<br />
“Isn’t it hard for you to do that?” Josh wondered.<br />
<br />
“Nope, it’s very easy for me to do!” Peter replied, as he slowly walked up to the little Marco, who was now sitting on the locker room floor, looking around the room with the curiosity and wonder of a little 9 month old baby.  Marco had his full adult mind, but the personality and abilities of a baby.<br />
<br />
Peter got on the floor on his knees, right in front of Marco. Then he extended his arm and gently grabbed Marco’s tiny hand with his own huge fingers. Peter began to play with the little baby, poking him in his little belly and in his sides, causing the little baby to laugh. And of course Marco couldn’t poke Peter back, since Peter’s arms were so long, and he was far out of Marco’s reach.<br />
<br />
“Hi there, Mister Marco! I’m Peter, the Wizard who just turned you into a little 9 month old baby, using only the magic of his mind!” Peter said to the baby boy with a smile on his face.<br />
<br />
Ric, Josh and Salvador began to laugh out loud! How funny, to see Marco as a little baby boy!<br />
<br />
“I guess I had better grow him back, huh?” Peter asked Ric. But both Ric and Josh replied at the same time.<br />
<br />
“NO!!! Don’t! Just keep him like that, until later on tonight, so we can show him to Mr. Mendes!” they both shouted back.<br />
<br />
“How are you kids going to get home?” Peter asked them.<br />
<br />
“If I show you Marco’s car, can you drive us home if we tell you where we live?” Ric asked Peter.<br />
<br />
“Sure, I can teleport all of us and the car back to your house. Just tell me where you live as we walk out to Marco’s car!” Peter replied. <br />
<br />
Baby Marco started to cry.  Peter used his powers to make Marco feel calm around him…at least for the trip back home.  Ric grabbed Marco’s gym bag with his adult clothes and Peter conjured up a cloth diaper…pins and all…for Baby Marco to wear.<br />
<br />
The four boys and the baby walked out to the parking lot and got into Marco’s car. Then Ric told Peter where they lived. Peter closed his eyes and concentrated and in a matter of seconds they found themselves sitting in Marco’s car, as it was neatly parked in the driveway of their house.<br />
<br />
“I can’t wait to introduce you to Mr. Mendes!” Ric said, as they got out of the car.<br />
<br />
“And I will show you the Book of Transformations!” Josh said to Peter.<br />
<br />
Both Ric and Josh were extremely excited to have met Peter and Salvador in the gym, for they realized that they could become life long friends.</p>
