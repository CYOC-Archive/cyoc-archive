<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">James,  who prided himself on his boyish good-looking charms, decided to browse around this store. As he was looking around,  he accidently ran into a male maniquin about the size of a young 12 or 13 year old boy wearing green and black running shoes, black basketball shorts, and a blue T-shirt underneath a very light grey zippered hoody. Knocking it over,  James fell on top of the maniquin and its blank head flew off and its right arm and leg both snapped in half.<br />
<br />
He heard someone click their tongue. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now, look what you did,  young man! You broke this here maniquin!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry!&quot; he said,  quickly getting up.<br />
<br />
Oh,  you&#39;re going to be! You&#39;re going to repkace this here maniquin!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry,  I don&#39;t have any money, &quot; James said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who said anything about money?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
As he stood there after standing back up, he noticed the stare seemed a little big larger. His legs felt still,  and his shoes suddenly turned into green and black running shoes. Identical to the ones that small maniquin was wearing! <br />
<br />
&quot;What the heck?&quot; He muttered,  and the podium he knocked that maniquin off of suddenly appeared beneath his feet. <br />
<br />
The world suddenly moved around. Or rather,  he did. James suddenly found himself standing in the location where that maniquin was! And there was a support pole that had a mirror attached to it. James was staring at himself. A younger version of himself. A 12 year old version of himself to be precise! <br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell!?&quot; He said,  looking at the cute boyish image of his younger face. He was now completely unclothed,  except the new shoes on his feet.<br />
<br />
He tried to approach the mirror,  but his legs wouldnt respond. Looking at himself in the mirror,  his body was completely devoid of hair. And his legs looked.....shiny! <br />
<br />
He bent over to touch them,  but he started falling. Thats when the black pole attached yo his new platform,  inserted itself into his tailbone. With a yelp,  it forced poor James to straighten back up. <br />
<br />
With growing fear,  he started calling out for help. <br />
<br />
&quot;Aw,  im afraid that isnt going to work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But. But. My buddy just got a job here, and he&#39;s around here somewhere!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure he did,  and i&#39;m sure he is.&quot;<br />
<br />
James continued trying to move his legs,  but they were stuck in a locked position. Never to bend ever again. <br />
<br />
His upper thighs turned the same shiny tan hue as his young boyish 12 year old stalks nelow the. He felt his thighs. Plastic! They were fake plastic! He could barely feel the pressure of his hands on his thigh. A barely registered slight pressure from his own hands. <br />
<br />
&quot;Please! I didnt mean to!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;oh stop! Begging will do you no good now, lad. Even if i wanted to,  i can no longer reverse the spell. I&#39;m afraid you&#39;re going to spend your existence as a faceless,  featureless humanoid maniquin model of a 12 year old boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What!? Please!&quot; He begged,  ters beginning to stream from his eyes.&quot; &quot;I dont want to be a manniquin!&quot;<br />
<br />
All the while, he was trying to hide his much-reduced boyhood with his hands. He felt it go hard,  but not in a sexual kind of way. He started feeling himself, and gasped.<br />
<br />
The store owner chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;You no longer have anything to hide. Look.&quot; <br />
<br />
Suddenly,  both of his arms locked into place at his sides. His young fingers slightly curled casually i ward. In tbe mirror,  his male organ balled up,  and turned to hard plastic. Just a vague indication that he was supposed to be male.<br />
<br />
James could now longer move his arms. They were forever stuck at his sides. Casually hanging there like two tan stalks. At least his hands, arms, and fingers were still anitomically correct,  even if they were now inanimate hard plastic. <br />
<br />
&quot;Pla-pla-please!&quot; He begged of the shopkeeper. He &quot;felt&quot; the hard plastic creeping up his torso from his thin waist. The black basketball shorts that naniquin was wearing,  was now around hus waist,  mercifully covering up his bulge. <br />
<br />
The plastic sheep rolled up his chest. He was now unable to heave his chest in and out. But he was still somehow able to speak,  pleading with her not to entrap him in such a cruel prison. He was looking up at her,  as his neck was turning to plastic,  forcing his head to look straight ahead. Locking it in place forever. <br />
<br />
James was now forced to stare at himself as his inanimate transformation finishes. The miniquin&#39;s T-shirt and grey hoody appreared on hus body. He was now fully wearing its clothes. <br />
<br />
&quot;Please. Stop thi-mmmmhppphhhhh mmmpphh mmhhpphhh....MMMMMMPPPPPHHHHH!!!&quot; Then fell silent. The plastic creeped up his chin and jaw, locking it in place. Then sealed up his lips for good,  forever to remain silent. It erased his mouth completely,  leaving behind nothing but a blank surface. His cute boyish smile never to be seen again.<br />
<br />
Jame&#39;s eyes went wide,  filled with fearful panic as he realized his thoughts are locked away forever. He watched his cute little nose be erased. Sealed away,  never to smell. His cheeks rounding out into blankness. It reached his eyes. He tried keeping them open,  but they were erased. Never to be opened. His eyebrows vanished. He felt his hair shrinking away into his head. The last thing he heard,  was his buddy:<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,  have you seen my friend Ja-&quot; as his ears zipped up for good. James wanted to respond. To shout. But James was now sealed away forever,  inside a blank featureless maniquin of a 12 year-old-sized boy.</p>
