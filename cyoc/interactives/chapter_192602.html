<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I was sitting on a stall looking at myself in the mirror wearing this stupid red blazer with St. Stephens crest on the pocked of it with grey thin shorts a cheap white buttoned shirt and a red tie, looking up at my face, I have gotten use to my long blond hair now, with me being in this body for the past month learning to be Luca, living in a house in Italy, with a woman who supposably looks just like Luca’s mom treating me like her son and making me do school work and pushing my child instincts more and more, what I started to feel straight away finding myself supposably talking  like Luca strat away, and the first morning I woke up with a small hard on seeing a small tent what my small dick was making, and felt a sticky substance around it realise Luca is a very early Bloomer feeling my hart pupping fast and my dick feeling very sensitive still, and I couldn&#39;t stop myself from wanking off then and there and for the last 30 nights, it just felt so good now, pulping it up and down in this now small and light body, it felt betting than all the time I have had  sex for Christ sake, and I also found myself getting bored easily and got invited to play football with the local kids what I found myself accepting and actually having a lot of fun and becoming friends with them in the last month,  <br />
<br />
Even the clothes I have been wearing has been feeling comfy and natural only wearing thin shirts/tank tops and shorts that are shorter than normal with this body what loves the sun, I never worn anything like this in my life but I found myself loving it, I even have started to feel a sort of obsession when I am near the woman who is playing my mom, wanting to be close to her and feeling safer and like nothing can hurt me when I am near her, I even find myself snuffling up against her in the evenings and falling to sleep with my head on her lap. <br />
<br />
But of course, there has been also a lot of studying Luca’s life and what I need to know and such with my part time mom correcting me when I say or do something what Loca or a kid would not do, what started out being corrected multiple times a day, but now I have not been corrected for the past 4 days, what I don’t know if I should be proud of angry from still not wanting to be in this body of a kid. <br />
<br />
But I was loving it in a way the young a fresh hormones what felt better and more intense than sex in my old middle age body, and the energy or running around playing games with other kids older and younger than me, and allowing someone to look after me for once and not looking out for myself, but me sitting here getting ready to swap places with the real Luca’s. <br />
<br />
Looking in to the mirror saying” I am Luca’s Russo, student at St Stephn&#39;s, and son of Hebrew Russo and Sofia Russo” putting on a smile and then letting out a sigh, and thinking am I really going to do this, sure I have been doing it for the past month, but that was with people who don’t even know Luca, and I am going to be in this kids house where he been raced in and his parents who know him the best, but I have no chose and I might as well accept it and try my hardest, looking at myself in the mirror one more time, seeing a cute looking kid wearing a school unform looking back what I have gotten used to being in the past month, and pushed the tie to the side so it swaging and headed out of the changing room. <br />
<br />
I could not believe how uncomfortable the uniform felt, it felt itchy and made me fill self-conscience not wanting anyone to see me in it, and wanting to have my nice loss and comfy clothes I have been wearing for the past month, and realized this is the first time I have worn anything like I use to in my own body ( normally only wearing suits everyday) not liking the heavy  and stiff the blazer felt and how this white shirt felt so tight, but I did not say anything out loud about it, being in front of the people who will be taking me to where I am going to swap places with the real Luca. <br />
<br />
One of the men what now toward over me looked down at me and said “are you ready to go?” I looked up at him suddenly feeling small and valuable and felt nervous talking to the man who was like the Holt compared to my small skinny runner&#39;s body, and said “yes” what came out quote I walked quickly to the car and got in the back, not wanting to be near the guy anymore, and sat there realizing have not been near any men above 14 years old for the past month, and was surprised of how nervous I go around that one guy what I use to be taller and bigger than, but then the back door opened and he got in not even looking at me and said to the driver what I have not even notist “let’s move out” and I felt the car start and move. <br />
<br />
The car finely stopped after 2h drive what I spent most of my time looking out of the window, not wanting to engage with either of men, the man who was sitting next to me said “it’s time, this is the last time you can ask anything about this mission, so? I looked at him and said “i know everything I need to know” still feeling nervous in front of this guy and feeling nervous about what&#39;s gonna happen next, and he just nodded to me and got out the car, and I followed suit, getting out. <br />
<br />
Once I got out I saw a limo and a man holding a unconscious body what looked exactly like myself, well what I look like right now, knowing that is the real Luca and then I knew guy he was much skinnier and smaller but still towered over me, came up to me and said “ok quickly take these” with him handing me a smart phone and a wallet what obviously came for the real Luca, and I put them in to my pockets, and the guy carried on “ and this” pulling out a gold neckless putting it around my neck, with me pushing it under my shirt, knowing it is a treasured gift Luca’s gran gave to him and what he never takes off, and then the guy said “ow one more thing, the smart phone code is 5511, ok it’s 5511” I just said “ok ,I&#39;ve got it” and he just said “good” and started to guide me towards the limo, on the way to the limo I looked at the real Luca and saw I did look just like him from his heir to his tand skin, to even the clothes we are wearing right now are even the exactly the same, and saw him being taking to the car I got here in and I carried on to the limo. <br />
<br />
Once I got there the guy pushed me in and said take off those trainers and hand them to me, your school shoes are on the floor, and I did what he said, and put on some scuffed but shiny black lever shoes knowing they could not replica these very worn in shoes what fit my small feet perfectly knowing they were Lucas, then the gay said &quot;good luck&quot;, slammed the door and I heard two hits on the top of the car and we stared to drive off, most likely towards Luca’s now I guess my new home an till I find what I am looking for, I felt oddly excited but very nervous, I know it was going to be another couple of hours until we get there so I pulled out now my phone taped 5511 to unlock it and spent one hour going through old texts and messages what I caught up on, what I have been talking to friends and family about, and opened a game what looked interesting and started playing that while replying to messages from now my friends, hoping I am replying like Luca would hopefully,  an till I get home where the real test begins</p>
