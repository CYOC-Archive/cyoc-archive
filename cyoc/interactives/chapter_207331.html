<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Conversions to become Animalians was something that came for various reasons. Most of those that became Animalians were largely from what many referred to as &quot;the furry fandom&quot; and just had an interest in anthropomorphic animals. Most of rest that converted either did so to recover from injury, disease, or because they had an emotional attachment to an existing Animalian. Though the physical strength that Animalians projected has also provided for other potential reasons for conversion, so far as governments had seen it, and that being for some military purpose and that Animalians would prove to be a great &quot;super soldier&quot; in combing certain strengths that animals had with Human sentience, but many ultimately found that in general, Animalians tended to be rather averse to military actions. Sure, there were many that had served as Humans, but most didn&#39;t want to go back, and as Henry found out, even those that did continue to serve soon found that conversion did not necessarily mean &quot;Captain America.&quot;<br />
<br />
For while he could fly as a Bald Eagle Animalian, he couldn&#39;t catch up to a jet flying at Mach speeds with his own wing beats, and while he could be &quot;defensive,&quot; getting hit by something going at potentially twice the speed of sound did not sound appealing. He might be bigger than the birds that occasionally got sucked into the engines of airliners, but he wasn&#39;t impervious to harm, which would then mean that if he were to be a fighter pilot, he would NEED to be in a fighter jet, which would essentially defeat the purpose of converting in the first place. The additional features, such as his wings and tail would also then mean that the jet would need additional modifications in the cockpit just to make practical for him to fly it, which even the previous US administration didn&#39;t want to spend money on doing. It then left Henry largely serving as a recruiting mascot for the Air Force and promoting those seeking to go to the academy. He liked it, as he got to keep his commission, but it was still something that taught him a lesson on the things that he had agreed to convert for.<br />
<br />
Though, there were apparently also those who converted to show their allegiance to a country or cause, which apparently applied to the Bald Eagle Animalian that Henry and Beatrice could see moving about the Meat Market. Several of her feathers had been dyed to carry a very &quot;red, white, and blue&quot; motif that had to play to American patriotism, given the Bald Eagle&#39;s status as the national bird. Henry respected the patriotism, and he generally played to that sort of thing with regard to the recruiting missions the Air Force had him do, but it wasn&#39;t on a level where he was going to dye his feathers. Though, from what he&#39;d been told, this Animalian, Antonia Soon had additional reasons for it, namely being someone who managed to escape and defect from North Korea, joined the US and apparently changed her name to &quot;Susan B. Anthony&quot; after converting and gaining case of Regressive Hypersexuality Disorder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello,&quot; Antonia said to Henry and Beatrice, &quot;you are here for the show.&quot;<br />
<br />
She spun and then flared her wings, which had also had some of those feathers dyed, and probably more so than the head and tail feathers, as the brown body and wings of the Bald Eagle would make holding a different color more difficult.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re here to talk, actually,&quot; Beatrice said slowly, &quot;if we could go somewhere more... quiet.&quot;<br />
<br />
Antonia turned back and both Henry and Beatrice noted the frown. But she did ultimately accept it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well,&quot; Antonia said slowly and motioned to ward some of the more office area behind the bar, which would be quiet from the action and antics on the stage and wouldn&#39;t interfere with the business of the club if they went into the locker room. She then led them along and Henry and Beatrice both followed. It was only once they entered the office that anyone spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for speaking with us...&quot; Henry began, &quot;um... what would you prefer? I&#39;ve heard both Antonia Soon and Susan B Anthony.&quot;<br />
<br />
Privately he wondered how the suffragette of the 1800s would feel about someone taking her name as a &quot;patriotic gesture&quot; to then dance at a strip club, but he wasn&#39;t a historian and at the same time, he figured that since the person Antonia had apparently named herself after died in 1906, it really wouldn&#39;t matter. He did, however, want to be polite and respectful.<br />
<br />
&quot;It could go either way,&quot; Antonia said slowly, &quot;those of my family that were able to escape and come here would prefer Antonia, and I cannot deny family. Though...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Personally, you&#39;d prefer Susan B Anthony?&quot; Beatrice surmised from the way Antonia answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; the renamed Susan B Anthony spoke, &quot;it contains parts of family&#39;s name in a way... and it&#39;s more American.&quot;<br />
<br />
Henry noted the way she finished with &quot;more American.&quot; It was understandable to move in that direction, and a part of him even respected and liked the idea of taking on an &quot;American&quot; identity, he also didn&#39;t want it to be projected and forced onto people. From what Horizon&#39;s agents had told him and Beatrice, he had to wonder if that was part of what had happened with this particular Susan B Anthony. After all, North Korea really wasn&#39;t a country that the US got along with all that much.<br />
<br />
&quot;Has anyone said you weren&#39;t?&quot; Henry wondered, trying to make his voice sound as comforting as possible.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not so much as an order,&quot; Susan B Anthony said slowly, &quot;but the pressure is there... People confuse me for being Chinese or Japanese, and then when learning that not only is my family Korean but escapees from NORTH Korea, there is the sense that people don&#39;t see us... or me as Americans, or at least not real ones.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry if anyone has done that to you,&quot; Henry spoke and looked down before looking up again, &quot;especially when you&#39;d also served the country.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It wasn&#39;t too bad in the military,&quot; Susan B Anthony admitted, also looking down, &quot;and for a time... I could handle it outside the service.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Something had to have made it worse,&quot; Beatrice said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Covid... or at least the response to it made it worse,&quot; Susan B Anthony commented, &quot;we came to this country to get away from tyrants who opposed freedom and then got told we were spreading Covid. That we&#39;d created it in a lab and didn&#39;t love the country...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s all nonsense,&quot; Henry spoke, &quot;and even if Covid was cooked up in a lab, YOU weren&#39;t responsible.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Doesn&#39;t stop people from being rude and even attacking me over it,&quot; Susan B Anthony answered, &quot;a group of them mistook me for the boogeyman they&#39;ve been conditioned to hate, and I was beaten up. Not something a veteran should get, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Henry nodded while Beatrice took Susan B Anthony&#39;s taloned hand and patted it in a comforting manner.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, I took a more American name and converted,&quot; Susan B Anthony answered, &quot;and chose a patriotic animal. Something American and shows I love this country... that doesn&#39;t have state driven policies to meet specific production quotas and then taking my food after it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing is ever perfect,&quot; Henry said slowly, &quot;and you never should have been treated the way you were here. Hopefully people will learn in time...&quot;<br />
<br />
Susan B Anthony nodded and accepted the reassuring grip on her hand that Beatrice gave. She knew and recognized Henry as one of the Air Force&#39;s recruiting agents, and a part of her felt reassured that both he and Beatrice were on her side. Though, there was soon a question that came up in relation to it.<br />
<br />
&quot;How has your family taken this?&quot; Beatrice asked, &quot;those that came to America?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They don&#39;t mind the conversion all that much,&quot; Susan B Anthony said slowly, &quot;they don&#39;t like my choice in species all that much. I think they would have preferred me being a Water Deer, like the two that have come to Animalia. They like my changing my name less. They feel like I&#39;m abandoning them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you aren&#39;t, I take it?&quot; Beatrice asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, they are family,&quot; Susan B Anthony answered, &quot;just because I want to show I am an American doesn&#39;t mean that I want to abandon my family.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you told them about the pressures people have put on you?&quot; Henry asked. There were things about coloring her feathers that took patriotism to a whole other level, but the more he and Beatrice talked with her, the more he got the sense that it was more to Susan B Anthony&#39;s situation than just wanting to prove a love of country, &quot;surely they would support you on that front.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;d be supportive... but also wanting me to be more... calm,&quot; Susan B Anthony admitted, &quot;not panicking or running away from something.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that can be understandable,&quot; Beatrice nodded, &quot;did, or can you, explain to them that your choice in conversion isn&#39;t about running away from something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure I can explain it,&quot; Susan B Anthony said, &quot;as well... there&#39;s pressure... and to some degree, I don&#39;t mind the attention here at the Meat Market.&quot;<br />
<br />
This was something that neither Henry nor Beatrice had an immediate answer for. They could provide some comfort, but they also weren&#39;t skilled in the areas that might be needed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... know that Animalia will welcome you,&quot; Henry managed, &quot;and with luck, others may welcome you as well. Though, your parents may well be right in that you can&#39;t just run from problems. They&#39;ll just remain there. And it might help you see someone that can help you work things through with your family... those that came to America, I mean.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean a shrink? I&#39;m not crazy!&quot; Susan B Anthony countered.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re not crazy,&quot; Beatrice spoke, &quot;but you&#39;ve clearly been under various stresses. Both from family and those outside your family. It might help just to get those feelings out. And might even help you explain your reasoning for your conversion&#39;s choice of species. That&#39;s all.&quot;</p>
