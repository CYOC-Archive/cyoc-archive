<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Few hours earlier, in Kayne&#39;s semi, Jaysen and Kayne were still looking for Chad. They managed to find Todd and Rick for the past few months. Todd was finally restored and moved on w/ his life, Rick decided to stay as a toilet w/ his new family, but his name was marked by Jaysen&#39;s permanent memento marker, the only problem is finding Chad. They went to several gay clubs and bars when Jaysen was finding the location of the three toilets in the Principal&#39;s room. They never mention what is the name of the location where Chad is. Almost giving up, they make one or two more stops that seems a bit farther from their town to the next town few miles away. After their first/last stop, where Chad is at, there was a suspicious car behind them, but they ignored it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, if we don&#39;t find Chad, thanks for helping me, Kayne.&quot; Jaysen says in a mope like tone. Kayne, still driving replies, &quot;Hey, we&#39;ll find him. Don&#39;t worry.&quot;<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve been searching him for months already! And we still don&#39;t know where he is.&quot; Jaysen said w/ a bit of anger and upset. They soon stop at the last and final gay bar parking lot. &quot;Why are you so intent on finding Chad?&quot; Kayne looks at Jaysen and notices him blushing after he said that. Kayne smirks, &quot;You have a crush on him don&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
Jaysen whips his head to look at him and tries to defend himself, &quot;I-I... I do not! I-It was my responsibility to turn him back after I came back from home.... That&#39;s all. I was honest of turning the others back, I swear!&quot;<br />
Kayne chuckles, &quot;It&#39;s cool dude. I knew you had intended on being his secret admirer from the get go.&quot;<br />
&quot;But, not into an object! Or at that date!&quot; he continues, still blushing, &quot;Besides, I wasn&#39;t expecting this to happen...&quot; he then moves his head away trying to avoid his truth. Kayne leans towards him and pats his shoulder, &quot;Hey, it&#39;s cool. You still care for that arrogant guy and hope he can change, I understand that. And I was just kidding about you loving Chad thing, no need to get defensive.&quot; he lightens up to Jaysen as he relaxes a bit, still blushing. &quot;S-Sorry... I didn&#39;t mean it that way.&quot; Kayne then gets Jayesn&#39;s attention about a straggler tailing behind him as he nods. Carrying his concealed fencing rapier and a taser in case he gets mugged or something. Kayne then realized something, &quot;Oh yeah, I&#39;m curious, what did you do to Bruno?&quot;<br />
Jaysen replied, &quot;Being a mannequin for my brother, who you already know is a living morphsuit permanently.&quot; Kayne awes, &quot;Fair enough. That guy is more of a prick than Chad from what I can tell.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jaysen then unbuckles his belt, &quot;I&#39;m gonna go find him. Just stay here and wait until I finally found him.&quot; Kayne nods as Jaysen then goes out of the truck and goes in the bar. He then asks the tender where&#39;s his restroom as he points to the corridor on the left and follows the directions given to him, followed by a male behind him... Finally finding Chad, he exits out the bathroom he then tells the gay tender that he was being followed and asks to stay behind the bar table, w/ a nod, he then hides as two or three guys entered, not giving a damn about Jaysen leaving and entered the bathroom. One man left the bathroom and out of the bar and away from his view and goes back to the bathroom. The bartender then asks him, &quot;Wait, you&#39;re going back in there? I thought you&#39;re hiding from them!&quot;<br />
&quot;I did, but I need to tie some loose ends.&quot; he replies w/ a smirk and goes back in the corridor to the bathroom.<br />
<br />
As the lone goatee man turns around the corner of Kayne&#39;s car, Kayne then opens the driver door to knock out the mysterious man as he falls on his back to the ground unconscious. Kayne then steps out of the car to look at the fallen person. &quot;Sorry, did I hurt you?&quot; he smugs as he drags him to the back seat tied w/ some extension cords.<br />
<br />
In the bathroom, the two plumbers were discussing how to remove Chad as Jaysen enters the bathroom. He then hears one of them say, &quot;We need to get out of here before Jaysen returns.&quot; With a bemused face, he then calls them out, &quot;Well that&#39;s rude, you don&#39;t want me around?&quot; The two plumbers look to the bathroom door and see Jaysen standing there. He then pulls out his school fencing rapier and points it at them. &quot;You have three seconds to leave that toilet alone or you&#39;ll be poked more than once!&quot; he warns them. One of the men slowly reached for the hacksaw in hopes to scare Jaysen; but to Jaysen, he knows how to disarm and parry his opponent(s), also show no fear. The man then grabbed the hacksaw and tries to attack him, a fucked scare tactic, but Jaysen then aims for his raised arm w/ the hacksaw in his hand as it swings down on him and immediately slide steps to the opposite of the swing bringing the rapier in his hand to slide to make some sort of parry and slide his rapier to his stomach, giving him a hard poke at the end, and w/ his free hand pulls out his taser and stuns his opponent as he falls by his hand. The other man, scared out of his mind, decided to leave the bathroom, only to be stopped by Kayne outside of the bar. Jaysen smirks and goes back to the Chad stall. <br />
There, he shows Chad the antidote. Internally, Chad smiled realizing he was his hero after all. Jaysen then realizes that he was nasty and needed a good cleaning, &quot;Aw geez, if I turn you back now, you&#39;re gonna be a stinky man again!&quot;<br />
<br />
And soon Jaysen then starts hard cleaning for almost an hour, trying to make him spotless as possible before turning him back to normal. Once done, Jaysen then uses the antidote on the Chad toilet as he then changes back to a human. &quot;I&#39;m human again!&quot; Chad yells, now back to normal, and naked, hugs Jaysen as a way of thanks. But Jaysen was blushing as he hugs back. He then thinks back on what Kayne asked him if he&#39;s gay for Chad. Yes, yes he is in someways. Then Jaysen realizes he&#39;s naked. &quot;Uh... Chad, you&#39;re naked...&quot; Chad, realizing his words stopped hugging him and backed up a couple steps blushing too. &quot;Sorry... So, now that you saved me, what are we gonna do?&quot; Chad asks. Jaysen looks at the unconscious man on the floor, and the sleeping man at the other stall... &quot;Well, for starters, one of these two will have to take your place.&quot; Jaysen says. Chad points to the man at the bathroom door, &quot;Take that guy, he tries to unscrew my nuts!&quot;<br />
&quot;Ditto.&quot;<br />
<br />
After the bathroom incident, and a &quot;new&quot; toilet is installed, Chad, wearing some other man&#39;s clothing that tried to uninstall him w/ Jaysen comes out of the bathroom and out of the bar itself. Of course, the bar tender didn&#39;t care who the other man was, nor did he care anymore, not his problem. They then enter Kayne&#39;s car, and Kayne smiles and asks, &quot;Mission accomplished?&quot; Jaysen nods and drive back home. Tossing the two men in a nearby dumpster w/ the inanimation spray beside them, they took Chad home. Once at his house, Chad then says, &quot;Hey guys, thanks for... Saving me, I&#39;m too prideful or arrogant, whatever you call it to say it, I am just glad this is over.&quot; Jaysen smiles calmly and replies, &quot;Hey, that&#39;s what friends are for right? And I was responsible for you and the others safety.&quot; Chad then realized what happened to the others. Jaysen and Kayne broke it down for him. Plus Bruno.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see. Todd is okay, Rick is still a toilet, and Bruno, is now a mannequin. Fine by me I guess.&quot; Chad says realizing their situation. He then steps out of the car, and says his goodbye. Tomorrow, maybe different, or not. Jaysen then calls him out, &quot;Chad!&quot; he turns back to him wondering what he is asking. &quot;If you want to... Want to see my fencing practice? Before your other practices tomorrow?&quot; Chad, thought about it for a moment, and nodded and smiled as the two then leave his house. Chad was then greeted by his family after he knocked on the door, glad that he has returned safely.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile/The next day....</p>
