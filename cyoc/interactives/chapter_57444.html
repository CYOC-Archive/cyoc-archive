<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">(AN: Someone please tell me how it's possible to catch two colds in one week.)  <br />
<br />
That Isabelle's cousin, was still her cousin, meant logically of course she was now also the <br />
cousin of Hope, Grace, and Kaylee. This of course created the paradox since Hope, Grace, <br />
and Isabelle no longer had the same parents before reality altered, and thus no longer had <br />
the same aunts and uncles, and therefore no longer had the same cousins. <br />
<br />
To make things even more confusing, Timothy before had been Isabelle's cousin, not her <br />
nephew. But this was somewhat logical in that Isabelle was now an adult woman, not a <br />
teenage girl while Timothy was still a little boy.<br />
<br />
This was likely due to there being a reason why Julie would hire Madam Serenity to find the <br />
parents of the gem wolves, and why she instead chose a PI whose investigations were <br />
always related to the curse and dabbled in fortune telling and alchemy to boot! <br />
<br />
So Isabelle's aunt had become her cousin instead, and her cousin her nephew. And the <br />
non-identical quadruplets' mother had gained a sister, a brother in law, and a niece, a <br />
nephew in law, and a great-nephew! <br />
<br />
And Isabelle's family tree was sliced and diced to make up for the rearrangements in ways <br />
that would have left any genealogist openly weeping!<br />
<br />
None of these lupman had even the most remote clue that a week ago none of them were <br />
even remotely related and did not even known each other! And Isabelle's family of course <br />
had no idea they had lost a daughter, and another chunk of their family as well. And reality <br />
didn't care. It was internally consistent, that was all that matter. Reality had no heart to <br />
appeal to with guilt, no mind to argue with impressive speeches, reality simply was. <br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
On the most eastern edge of the border between United States and Mexico, a small cabal of <br />
fairies resided, of course direct descendants and some members of the swam of fairies that <br />
the witches had brought into being three hundred years before though none had a clue to <br />
their previous human existence. <br />
<br />
There were creatures however that had never been humans, and were legally documented <br />
as extinct. The fairies only having limited knowledge of how much humanity had (relatively) <br />
changed in three hundred years, liked to keep it that way least these rare trees now the <br />
last of their kind were to truly go extinct...<br />
<br />
'Though,' Though the fairy who had picked up the nickname 'Lady MacBeth' from her real <br />
name, 'Sometimes I wonder if they keep their own numbers down better than even humans <br />
are able to.' <br />
<br />
To the sound of fiesta music, a two hundred and ninety year old American Boxing Tree, <br />
was punching it out with a Mexican Fighting Tree. 'Your nuts shall not cross the border!'  <br />
Declared the bold American Boxing Tree as it duke it with it's permanent neighbor a <br />
Mexican Fighting Tree (also considered extinct). <br />
<br />
And the two trees continued to use their two giant wooden fists to punch each other in the <br />
trunk. They had plenty of practice. They had been punching each other's nuts out since <br />
they were saplings... <br />
 <br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
The doctor slammed down a hammer they had found to act as a stand in gavel. And the <br />
trial began. <br />
<br />
Linus covered his arms with long sleeves to hid fleshy stumps of where his hands once <br />
were, he did have a little vanity. Kathrine looked at him as she sat next to him. 'I've known <br />
men who'd scream in terror and sob for months at such a tragedy. .. Linus, he's just going <br />
foreword. Like he almost doesn't -care-... or is he just hiding it that well?' It made Kathrine <br />
wish he knew how to read minds, it certainly would have made a lot of her life easily and <br />
make it much easier to understand people. <br />
<br />
&quot;Defense. Persecution. You may make your opening statements.&quot; Said the good doctor. <br />
<br />
Linus stood up with as much precision and skill as a soldier at war. <br />
<br />
&quot;The defendants have over the course of their lives had annihilated out of existence the <br />
identities, memories, and psyche of countless people to remake them as they see fit like <br />
they were clay to be sculpted leaving nothing of their previous selves behind!  The persons <br />
they were in any shape or form no longer exist, and they are directly responsible! I ask <br />
you, how can this -not- fit the definition of murder?  And I am certain if the witches slaves <br />
were all conscious and aware they would tell us how the witches had repeatedly harped <br />
their plans to tear down all the nations of the world.&quot; <br />
<br />
Marie Cruz shouted, &quot;Conjecture!&quot;<br />
<br />
The doctor nodded, &quot;Sustained. the jury shall ignore the last part of the prosecution.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Linus continued, &quot;Sorry your honor.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The defense may make it's opening statement.&quot; <br />
<br />
Marie Cruz spoke, &quot;I will remind the court that weather the witches are a danger to <br />
themselves and others are not what is being discussed with this trial. Nor is the point of <br />
this trial weather or not they are too dangerous to live or not. I hold that the point of this <br />
trial as said before, is weather the witches are truly in their right mind, and thus weather or <br />
not they can actually be held accountable for their acts of murder and treason. If they are <br />
truly lost in their own world, then there is no point in punishing them for they can not <br />
connect their actions with consequences.&quot;</p>
