<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Katie stretched as the Saturday morning sun peaked through her window. Last night had been a bit crazy with Shiro, Ashley and Jennifer. After the three of them had left the girls said their gooodbyes. Mika went with Kumiko while Claudia and Kellie went home. Katie decided after seeing how tired Lisa looked it would be best to go to bed without bugging her. As she thought about last night though one thought did linger.<br />
<br />
Katie had changed an entire group of people accidentally and had left them like that. After the fight she had with Kellie last weekend she decided it would be best to change them all back. Looking at her ring Katie wished that all the couples she had changed at the movie theater would return to their original ages. The ring glowed softly as Katie could see flashes of the couples at the theater returning to normal. Katie smiled, she had fixed her mistake and left the newly engaged couple from the restaurant together. <br />
<br />
Making her way downstairs Katie could see Lisa sitting on the couch watching t.v. and drinking coffee. “Morning mom,” she called. Lisa looked over smiling. “Morning kid,” she smiled. “How you sleep?”<br />
<br />
“Pretty good,” she said. “Me and the girls had a lot of fun last night.” Lisa nodded as she smiled at Katie. “Glad to hear and I’m glad you four were responsible last night too. Those two just, well.....it was a bit much.”<br />
<br />
Katie nodded as she thought about Ashley and Jennifer, the girls wild side could have led to big problems. Thankfully Lisa and Kumiko pulled the girls out, she just felt a little sad though seeing the two of them get in so much trouble. Oddly she also found herself feeling bad for Shiro, despite all of the nasty stuff he had said he genuinely seemed to like the two girls.<br />
<br />
“Yeah That was nuts,” Katie said solemnly. “I do feel a little bad for them though. I even feel bad for Shiro. I...I don’t know, did we do the right thing?”<br />
<br />
Lisa looked at Katie smirking. “Yeah trust me we did,” she said. “I used to BE Ashley and Jennifer when I was their age. Sneaking into clubs, hitting on older guys and drinking like a fish. Trust me when I say I wish someone had told my parents. You may not think it but that was the best thing for them.”<br />
<br />
Katie nodded solemnly as Lisa looked her over. “Hey kid listen,” she said softly. “I think it’s very sweet that you care about the three of them even after all the crap you had to deal with. It shows a a lot of maturity and an insane amount of heart. You can feel sorry for them, it’s good, but trust me they needed some tough love last night.”<br />
<br />
“Okay mom I trust you,” she said. “By the way any plans today?”<br />
<br />
“Me and Jason are going out to dinner later,” Lisa said. “I guess Kellie is babysitting. Other than that I just have a few errands and some laundry. How about you.”<br />
<br />
Katie thought about it for a moment as she planned her day. “I was thinking of giving Mary Elise a call,” she said. “It’s been awhile since we hung out so might be fun.”<br />
<br />
“Good a plan as any,” Lisa shrugged. “Just be careful and don’t do anything crazy with the ring Okay.”<br />
<br />
Katie giggled as she hugged her mom. “Promise mom nothing crazy.”<br />
<br />
Katie dressed and showered before giving Mary Elise a call. The girl had no big plans that day and thought it would be fun to hangout together. As Katie made her way outside she could see Kellie sitting on her front porch. “Hey Kel,” she called. Kellie nodded lazily from the porch as Kellie passed in front of the house. “Hey Kat, “ she said. “What are you up too.” Katie shrugged. “Just heading over to Mary’s how about you.”<br />
<br />
Kellie shrugged. “Just sitting here,” she said. “I’m babysitting later so no real plans today.”<br />
<br />
“You want to come hangout with me and Mary?”<br />
<br />
Kellie rubbed her chin thoughtfully. “Sure could be fun,” she said. “Let me just tell My folks okay.” Katie nodded as Kellie ran inside to tell her parents. Lee and Maggie agreed, telling Kellie to be back by 5p.m.<br />
<br />
The walk to Mary’s went quickly as the girls talked, as they approached Katie could see  Mary’s dad Ian working in the front lawn. Ian McKinnon was 40  with sandy brown hair and a thin build. He worked as an accountant for a small law firm. Although he liked his job well enough he was somewhat bored by it, wishing he could make a living working outdoors. This usually resulted in him doing a great deal of work on his home and yard despite a bad back. Watching the girls approached he waved from his position. “Hi girls,” he called wiping his brow. “Mary Elise is inside go on in.”<br />
<br />
Katie and Kellie thanked Mr. McKinnon as they entered Mary’s house. Mary’s house was tastefully decorated with older furniture and more books than either girl had seen outside a library. As Katie and Kellie gazed around the house Mary’s mom Shannon entered the room. Shannon was 39 and looked very much like her eldest daughter, with long auburn hair and full curves. Shannnon smiled as she looked at the girls. “Oh hi Kellie, hi Katie,” she smiled. “Let me go get Mary. She’s helping Megan with her homework.”<br />
<br />
Katie and Kellie nodded as Shannon called for her daughters. Looking up the stairs Katie and Kellie could see Mary and her 12 year old sister Megan. If Mary looked like her mom her sister looked like her father. Megan was a skinny 12 year old with a cute face and long sandy brown hair descending to her waist. “Hey guys come on upstairs,” Mary Elise called. “Just helping Meg out with her homework.”<br />
<br />
Katie and Kellie ascended the stairs entering Mary’s room. Mary Elise decorated her room much differently than the usual <br />
Teenage girl. Instead of boybands and music posters Mary’s walls were plastered with famous scientists, pictures of the solar system and female superhero’s. A queen sized bed and a high tech computer lay in the corner with an oak dresser on the other side, “Maybe you guys can help me out,” Mary asked. “Megan kinda needs my help with her art project and well....art has never been my best subject.”<br />
<br />
Katie and Kellie nodded approaching the desk where Megan had a painting spread across the desk. The young girl appeared to be making a painting of her family. The girls couldn’t help admiring the work she had obviously put into it. “Looks Great so far,” Katie said, Megan frowned as she gazed at the portrait. “I don’t know maybe,” she frowned. “The project wants us to paint a picture of the past or present. Kinda having a hard time visualizing either one right now.”<br />
<br />
Mary Elise looked at her friends with a look of anxiousness. She wanted to help her sister but wasn’t to sure about useing the ring on her entire family. Katie and Kellie now rubbed their chins thoughtfully as they weighed their options</p>
