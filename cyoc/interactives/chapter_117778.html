<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Darren thought it over and decided that he&#39;d would do a three way swap with Himself, Jonathan and James. James was also a P.E. teacher but he was the head of P.E. unlike Jonathan who was second in P.E.<br />
<br />
James had a decent amount of muscule but not quite as much as Jonathan and he was just a tiny bit shorter than Jonathan as well. James was also a very hairy guy. He had a lot of hair on his legs and the tops of his feet, arms and the backs of his hands. James also has a very thick coating of stomach and chest hair. James&#39; hair was a very dark brown and his thick stubble was a light brown. His voice was deep but not quite as much as Jonathan&#39;s voice but it could still sound scary when James gets angry and shouts. The clothes that James wore were very similar to that of what Jonathan wore. James wore a long sleeve blue shirt with his initials, JP, on it backwards. With that, James also wore either black, dark blue or grey shorts. He also wore trainers but the biggest difference between James and Jonathan&#39;s clothes was the fact that James wore football (soccer) socks that came up to beneath his knee where as Jonathan wears ankle socks which come just above his ankles.<br />
<br />
Darren knew just exactly where to find the pictures of Jonathan and James, on the P.E. section of the school website. The P.E. teachers are always having having picture taken of them with the football, rugby and basket ball teams so Darren screenshoted one with Jonathan in it and another with James in it. Then Darren put his phone on camara and put the picture on countdown so it would take a picture in ten seconds. After starting the countdown, Darren quickly placed down his phone on a stand then stood up straight in front of it while it took a picture of him. He then picked up his phone and smiled as the picture came out just the way he wanted it to. Darren then cropped all the three picture and printed them out. Once he did he shoved the picture into his coat jackets as he went out to buy some lemon juice.<br />
<br />
Darren got to the store where he bought some food aswel as the lemon juice because it would be weird if he just bought the lemon juice on it own. When he got home, Darren brought the lemon juice and a small but sharp knife to his room after putting the rest of the food away.<br />
Darren then entered his room and locked the door behind him. He was about to do the spell but then thought that it would maybe be a better idea to do it at school so he unlocked the door again and brought the pictures, lemon juice and the small knife inside the bag that he carries his work stuff in. Darren then spent the rest of the night wondering how the swap would happen. Will he not know until it&#39;s over, will it be and instant transformation or a slow gradual one or will he see his soul as it floats into another body. There was so many possibilities that Darren kept thinking on until he went to sleep<br />
<br />
Darren awoke feeling refreshed and excited but still a bit tired because he set his alarm earlier than normal so he could get to the school earlier. Darren didn&#39;t waste any time and got up from his bed and began to slip on his freshly washed uniform, knowing that if this spell works then this may well be the last time he wears this uniform.<br />
<br />
As he drove to the school, Darren couldn&#39;t help but once again think about all the different ways that the swap could happen. Then he suddenly realised how engolfed in this he was in this and began to think that this may just be all fake but he brought back his hope by saying &quot;I&#39;ve got nothing to lose by trying&quot;<br />
<br />
Most of the teachers get to the school at 7:00am but today, Darren got there at 6:30am so he could quickly set something up. He dashed into the school and first went straight into the boys P.E. office and set up a hidden camara that was connected to his phone and than he did the same thing in the head of P.E. office. Darren then walked to his technology room with a smug smile on his face.<br />
<br />
Soon, other teachers started showing up and before long, the camara showed that Jonathan had entered the boys P.E. office and James had entered the head of P.E. office already. Darren knew that the other P.E. teachers probably wouldn&#39;t be here until sometime between 7:30 and 7:45 so Darren decided to waste no time and get on with the spell.<br />
<br />
Darren took the pictures, lemon juice and knife out of his bag and placed them on the floor of his classroom. Luckily, Darren&#39;s classroom had a hard marble like floor so if the spell doesn&#39;t work then the blood will be easy to clean up before the students arrive. First, Darren placed the pictures in a circle which looked mor like a triangle without the blood. Then, he took a knife and cringed in pain as he cut his hand and dripped the blood into a small cup. Darren had come prepared for this and had somes bandages in his bag that he quickly wrapped around his hand before he lost too much blood.<br />
<br />
Next, Darren took one of his fingers and dipped it in the blood and drew lines between the pictures. Then he turned the lines into arrows by giving them heads. It went from Darren to Jonathan, from Jonathan to James and from James to Darren. The second step was complete.<br />
<br />
Darren then took a deep breath as the next step was the last one before the spell was complete. Darren opened up the camara on his phone and took a long hard look at his face. Then he began to check out his whole body as this may be the last time that he sees it from this point of view. Darren even goes as far as to stretch open his pants to look at his dick one last time.<br />
<br />
Darren took the bottle of lemon juice and if he remembered correctly, he had to put 6 drops of it in the middle of the circle in a three person swap. He unscrewed the lid and ever so carefully, he put 1...2...3...4...5...6 drops of  lemon juice in the centre of the circle. As soon as the sixth drop was placed, the lemon juice moved as if it were alive to mix with the blood arrows that were in between the pictures. Immediately after, the blood trail begins to glow a very bright red.</p>
