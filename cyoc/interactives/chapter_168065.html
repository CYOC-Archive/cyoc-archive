<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The roar of engines overhead once again met her hearing, and almost immediately, Jane knew what she had to do. More than anything she wanted, she <i>needed</i> to join them up there. An excited grin spread over her gunmetal gray face - this was what she was born to do. <br />
<br />
Of course, there was the conondrum of how to get out of her house. The new wingspan wasn&#39;t conducive to keeping the doorframe intact, nor was she inclined to rocket up out through the roof. She may have been a living marvel of engineering, but she was still making a salary that wasn&#39;t exactly the greatest in the world, and house repairs were expensive.<br />
<br />
Thankfully, a solution quickly presented itself, in the form of a shifting from her wings. Though she could still feel their mass, their shape compressed, folding back until they were cleanly integrated, flush against her back. The miniguns on her forearms quickly retracted inside her body as well - it left her in a pretty humanoid shape, albeit a steel-skinned one.<br />
<br />
All the more excited and not even caring that she was nude, the young woman rushed out the door, her patriotically-colored metallic hair winding itself into a bun as she went. Even the simple act of moving was exhilirating, as she felt the hydraulics that had taken the place of bones work, exacting inhuman amounts of force that nearly put dents in the floor. So much raw power rippled through her body, begging to be used, to be shown off and admired. Ohhh, was she ever going to show off.<br />
<br />
Out on the front lawn, a few pedestrians slowed their walks to watch dumbfounded as her wings unfolded, a satisfied moan leaving her mouth at the feeling of the additions locking into place. Her face began to reshape, new plates and additions folding out to cover her head completely with what seemed to appoximate a flight helmet. In her vision appeared a heads-up display, feeding an immense amount of data about her surroundings, and her own internal workings, directly into Jane&#39;s vision.<br />
<br />
She grinned beneath the mask as the thrusters at her hips began to roar to life. There was something incredibly pleasurable about the fire that now began to scream out of the nozzles - fuck it, it was downright orgasmic. She felt like she was in heaven as they spewed superheated gas, scorching her front lawn as they approached maximum thrust. Breath held, she very nearly reached down to massage her intimates, stopping just short as the thrusters hit maximum power.<br />
<br />
It was a feeling unlike any other to be propelled into the air under her own power, rocketing into the sky in a near-vertical ascent. A yell of excitement was bellowed as she felt air rushing past, her whole form tearing a line upwards as fire raged behind her. The radar she&#39;d felt pinging her room now allowed her to feel the outline for miles around, the shape of everything nearby - including the fighters that had taken off from the base, flinging off into the night. <br />
<br />
With an ecstatic &quot;WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!&quot; She flew off after the group, quickly gaining altitude and distance - her engines were magnificent, it seemed sending her hurtling through the sky at speeds she&#39;d never before imagined. A few maneuvers along the way, wide dips and turns, put her under immense g-forces, yet she hardly felt a thing. And maneuverable - god, she could turn on a dime even at a ridiculous velocity. She wasn&#39;t just a living fighter, she was a goddamn dream plane!<br />
<br />
Her skin rippled excitedly with the feeling of radar pings bouncing off her body. The other fighters had detected her; squinting, she focused on the radio signals that her brain could now detect, cycling until she found what seemed to be their frequency. Their reaction to her appearnce, rather unsurprisingly, seemed to be a confused one. &quot;McAllister Tower, this is FLAG-12 Lead, we&#39;ve got a bogey approaching at...&quot; She could have sworn she heard him mutter something obscene under his breath. &quot;Extremely high speeds... please confirm detection?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Copy FLAG-12 Lead, we see it.&quot; There was something unsettled in their normally monotone communication, as if they worried it was something attacking the squadron. Well, she could fix that uncertainity rather easily. Kicking in just a bit of extra speed, she closed the remaining gap, grinning behind her helmet&#39;s facial covering as she pulled up alongside the lead aircraft. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... lead, you&#39;ve got...&quot; One of his wingman spoke up over the radio, unable to properly describe what he was seeing. &quot;Lead, look to your left.&quot;<br />
<br />
The pilot turned his head, and then did a double take as he caught sight of the woman rocketing through the air a mere ten feet away. He had to pull one hand away from the controls in order to lift his visor and rub his eyes; when this confirmed that he wasn&#39;t hallicnating, he continued to stare, eyes only growing wider as Jane gave him a friendly wave.<br />
<br />
&quot;FLAG-12 Lead, we&#39;re showing bogey should be matching speed near you. Can you confirm visual contact?&quot;<br />
<br />
The man&#39;s gulp was audible even on the radio. &quot;Uh... confirmed, McCallister Tower, we... we uh... we have visual.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you identity?&quot;<br />
<br />
The man quickly shook his head. &quot;Tower, uh... you wouldn&#39;t believe me if I told you...&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a brief pause. &quot;Well... is it an aircraft, missile of some kind...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Would you believe me if I said it was a woman... with wings... and some real big ti-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is incredibly rude!&quot; She shot back playfully over the radio, her voice carried with tremendous clarity on their communication frequency. &quot;They&#39;re this big to store plenty of fuel, FLAG-12 Lead, not to get ogled by you!&quot;<br />
<br />
The pilot finally turned back to looking ahead, unsure of how to process any of this. &quot;Tower, please tell me you heard that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... confirm, Lead... uh...&quot; The operator trailed off, as it became evident that he didn&#39;t know how to handle any of this. &quot;Uh... bogey is on our frequency, then...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right, so I better not hear any more trashy comments!&quot; She&#39;d never felt so brazenly confident, but the immense power coursing through her gave Jane more of a spine then she&#39;d ever thought herself able to project. &quot;And you can drop the bogey part! Call me...&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh. Oh yes. That was good. &quot;Plane Jane!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...Tower, requesting permission to bail and blow my brains out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Denied, Lead. We suffer together.&quot;</p>
