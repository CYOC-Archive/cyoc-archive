<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Peter quietly hummed to himself as he placed books back on the library&#39;s shelves, stretching upward a little. The motion made his new and improve dick brush more strongly against his boxers (he needed to get looser clothes, seriously!) and he smirked. He really should thank the dude who&#39;d decided being a penis was a great future, because Peter loved it and he would fight Hugo to keep his new fat cock. <br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t hear any digital voice, and his cock didn&#39;t even twitch when others did all around campus. <br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Danny had been lying on a desk, attached to George and trying not to fall asleep during another board meeting. Half of the dicks were attached, the others prefering the completely independant style. Danny himself was of mixed feelings, both were fun in their own ways, so long as you had the right support machines to help you move and talk. <br />
<br />
Plus, the company&#39;s structure was shifting greatly in favor of dicks. The new department had commercialized their first line of products and it was turning in an incredible profit in the adult market. His dad or his dad&#39;s colleagues could hardly complain, especially when they&#39;d tested some of those things themselves. <br />
<br />
He was idly thinking that he should order George to get some of the prototypes for later when he heard static coming from his communication chip. In a few seconds, the noise started to focus in an impersonal, robotic male voice. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dicked human, if you can understand this message, know that you have been deemed more suitable for a continued existence as only a penis. Thus, effective immediate, your current form shall become permanent. You need not worry about ever becoming human again. If your cognitive functions ever deteriorate past the sapient stage, all implants are programmed to shut down, leaving you an authentic and completely ordinary cock. Enjoy the beginning of your new life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;Well,&#39; Danny thought, &#39;I hope Dad didn&#39;t get *that* message too.&#39; It&#39;d be awkward to explain why their conditions had just NOW become permanent when he&#39;d implied the same weeks ago. Otherwise, eh, it was what it was. He never really minded being a dick anyway. Though, he wouldn&#39;t like George to learn this, or he had a feeling George would try to make him devolve past that &#39;satient standard&#39;.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Ryder shouted from the confines of his mind when the announcement ended, turning into another bout of raging that left him stiff and uncomfortable inside the wrestling team&#39;s luggage. It was supposed to be temporary! He hadn&#39;t agreed to this! Just earlier this morning, he&#39;d been human, and maybe, maybe he&#39;d been looking forward to being dicked again for his teammates, but not forever! <br />
<br />
What was he going to do now? <br />
<br />
Despite himself, he felt cum bubble down his &#39;throat&#39;, and he longed for the next bump in the road that would rub him against the fabric. Fuck. He couldn&#39;t wait for the bus to stop and those bastards &#39;friends&#39; of his to use him again. It was the least they could do after getting him stuck like this!<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Jacob scoffed at Mint, who had been staring at him in glee. &quot;So what? I&#39;m your cock, dude, that never changed. You and me? We&#39;re gonna fuck our way to success, as long as you listen to your instinct.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mint rolled his eyes, annoyed and aroused by his unruly penis. Still, it wasn&#39;t a *bad* idea, per say. <br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, no, NO!&quot; James tried to scream, unable to move inside his new  owner&#39;s swimsuit. &quot;Liam, this is all your fault! If you hadn&#39;t stolen the dean, I wouldn&#39;t be here! I hope you&#39;re stuck too, you fucking dick!&quot;<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Thomas laughed from inside one of the new cock and improved electronic cockrings. He even felt Jonas stiffen to his right, inside the fleshlight with Eduardo. Why would he ever want to turn back into a human when his dicked state had led him to becoming a manager in a profitable business?<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Kyle had been sitting with Elliot, sharing their lunchtime before going back to class, when, without warning, his groin heated up and his dick began pumping like crazy! He choked out on his sip of gatorade, going red in the face as his pants grew extremely tight and constraining. &quot;W-whoa, shit, I&#39;m-&quot; he moaned, full out *moaned* in the middle of the engineering department&#39;s lunchroom. <br />
<br />
Elliot opened his mouth, looking concerned, before suddenly freezing too. Kyle&#39;s thought, as stupid as it might be, was that his new horny hairtrigger was contagious. It might be, judging by the discreet glance Elliot shot at his crotch. Kyle couldn&#39;t help it and went boneless against Elliot&#39;s shoulder, shuddering and just begging for any sort of human contact. He breathed far too heavily against his friend&#39;s ears, which had also gone pretty damn red from his erotic behavior. <br />
<br />
Through sheer force of will, Kyle manage to bit down the full out shout that built in his throat when he came right here and there. <br />
<br />
... damn.<br />
<br />
He&#39;d just creamed his fucking boxers. Out of nowhere! <br />
<br />
And Elliot looked seconds away from doing the same. Damn, again. They had to find a bathroom and take care of this. <br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Inside his lab, Hugo sank into his chair, sighing in relief at a job well done. Looking around himself at the cocks inside their tanks or strewn on the tables for measurements, he felt rather proud of his work. His research paper had been accepted and published in a major scientific magazine on his homeworld. It had been making waves in many circles, Mint had told him, grinning. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now, I don&#39;t even need to change you penises back to your more boring forms,&quot; Hugo chuckled, leaning over the closest table to rub Model #35&#39;s dickhead, just right. &quot;Not that you would want that, would you? Like you&#39;d want to be a... What were you again?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I mean... &quot; the helpless cock sputtered, twitching under Hugo&#39;s fingers. His dogtag had been wrapped around his balls to test simple anatomical principles. &quot;A PE teacher.&quot; The dogtag jingled, hitting the tables as Model #35 shuddered from one end to the other. &quot;But it&#39;s not... I don&#39;t care...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As you shouldn&#39;t,&quot; Hugo agreed. &quot;If you want to teach so badly, I hear the biology department likes live models. They could always use another one, showcase the different sizes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not too small?&quot; Model #35 asked with a tinge of hope. <br />
<br />
&quot;Five inches is perfectly fine, don&#39;t be so enslaved to your former species&#39; social constructions. Penises all serve the same function in the end. Here,&quot; Hugo pulled back the dick&#39;s foreskin and helped smear the clear pre over its head. &quot;diversity is important in genetics, you know?&quot; <br />
<br />
The soon-to-be sex-ed model couldn&#39;t find words to respond, his voice coming as breathless pants and whimpers, his twitching going so bad as to clink the dogtag some more. Then, after a few more strokes, the dick moaned and spewed cum in three milky white burst, covering Hugo&#39;s hand. <br />
<br />
&quot;See? You&#39;ll do fine. Here, let me save you the trouble.&quot; Hugo licked his hand clean, then pulled his chair toward his computer.  <br />
<br />
There, he began typing a message for the head of the biology department, pretending to be 35&#39;s former identity and volunteering as a model for the next class. He ended with a few lines about begging to be picked up at his apartment, with a PS telling the biology teacher to bring any students that felt the need to experience the same dicking state for good measures. <br />
<br />
As soon as he sent it, however, Hugo heard his computer ping with a new notification. His superiors had sent him another message. Curious, he clicked it open. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dear Hogo,&quot; it read. &quot;We, at Human Investigation Institute thank you for your amazing contributions in the fields of human psychology. It is now clear to us that being dicked is a fate that many human males learn to appreciate fairly quickly and thus cannot be considered inhumane treatment of a less advanced species. Our laws and procedures have been revised to exclude dicking as an illegal action when performed by homans. Thus, we have submitted a new proposal to our leadership regarding a possible futur mass dicking event on Earth. The data you have accumulated so far has been determined to be extensive and quite promising. As such, it has been determined that you will be the best scientist to conduct a new experiment regarding the dicking process and human mentalities. <br />
<br />
As lead researcher, you will be granted a single new piece of technology in order to observe the dicking of human males in a free-er environment. Your goal is to create conditions in which humans would be willing to dick each others without your direct intervention. <br />
<br />
Parameters that would be accepted but are not mandatory include: <br />
1- Knowledge or lack thereof of the dicking state being permanent<br />
2- Full consent of both or either parties<br />
3- Exploitation of the dicked party<br />
<br />
In your response, please state your intentions and which piece of dicking equipment you feel would be most adequate for new and exciting developments.<br />
<br />
Sincerely, Head of the Human Investigation Institute.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm, so many options... I need to think this through, and possibly consult some of my test subjects.&quot;</p>
