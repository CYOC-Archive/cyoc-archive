<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">For a long while we traipsed through the fog in silence. The gargoyle that used to be a demon scuttling along in front, then Runt making sure <br />
he didn't try to escape, then me, trying to get used to my new body. After what must've been an hour or two, we came upon the camp. Though <br />
it looked like less of a camp, more of a fortress made out of fencing, corrugated tin and chain mail.<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll have to tie us up,&quot; Runt told me, indicating the set of manacles hanging from my belt. I did as he said, putting one around his wrist and <br />
the other around the gargoyle's.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don'th know whath I'm doing.&quot; I complained.<br />
&quot;Just go in, get in with the other guards and try to find out where the nearest gate is.&quot;<br />
&quot;Buth they'll think I'm him.&quot; I pointed to the gargoyle.<br />
&quot;Yep,&quot; he nodded, &quot;You gotta blag like you've never blagged before. Ready?&quot;<br />
<br />
I sighed and we headed towards the front gate. There were two other guards standing there, each as ugly and pig-like as I was.<br />
&quot;Halt,&quot; one of them said, &quot;Whath thish?&quot;<br />
&quot;Prithonersh,&quot; I grunted, trying to imitate them, &quot;Found 'em wandering the dethert.&quot;<br />
The guard sniffed at Runt and the gargoyle. &quot;Mutht've eshcaped from another camp,&quot; he decided, &quot;You know the drill.&quot;<br />
<br />
I nodded. Though of course I didn't.<br />
They opened the door and I stepped inside. The place stank of sweat and I could hear the sound of rowdy crowds. This did not seem like a nice <br />
place at all.<br />
<br />
Another pig-guard walked up to me with a clipboard.<br />
&quot;New in-matesh?&quot; he asked. <br />
I nodded.<br />
&quot;Bet you've got a good hunt shtory to tell, huh?&quot; The guard chuckled a guttural laugh.<br />
I nodded and laughed back.<br />
He scribbled on the clip-board and presented it to me. &quot;Thign.&quot;<br />
<br />
Runt glanced at me. I took the board and the quill. I started to panic for a moment, as I had no idea what my name was supposed to be. But <br />
then I figured that bureaucracy was the same in any plane of existence. I scribbled any old doodle and handed it back.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll take ith from here.&quot; The guard said and took my manacles from me. Runt didn't look back at me as he was led away. I felt I was supposed <br />
to do something, to stop us being separated, but I couldn't blow my cover now. <br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; the guard turned to me as he reached the door, &quot;Heem wansh to thee you.&quot;<br />
He led Runt and the gargoyle out through a heavy metal door and shut it behind you.<br />
<br />
I felt lost. I was terrified whatever I did next would be suspicious and I'd be found out. But as I noticed a group of pig-men watching me, I <br />
suddenly realised standing still was more suspect that anything else, and quickly moved with no idea where I was going. <br />
<br />
Who was this Heem person and why did he want to see me? Being told the principal wants to see you is scary enough even when you know who <br />
he is and where to find him.<br />
<br />
I found myself in a sort of mess-hall, though want was on offer appeared by rancid slops peppered with fish heads and small rodents. It was <br />
packed full of ravenous pig-men, so I decided to do what everyone else was doing and got in line. I was handed a large wooden bowl and <br />
served my own brand of slops. Surprisingly it smelled quite good.<br />
<br />
I sat down on my own and poked at my food. I was quick to notice that nobody else was even using their hands to eat. I took a moment to <br />
prepare myself, took a deep breath, and did as the Romans did. Perhaps it was just my body talking, but it was very satisfying.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, I felt a hand on my shoulder. Slops dribbling from my snout, I looked up at who was behind me.<br />
&quot;Come.&quot;<br />
It was another pig-man, but much bigger and stronger than any of the others. He was wearing a sharp uniform, with a sash and a kilt and a <br />
sort of regal cape. His tusks were brightly polished. Was this Heem?<br />
He turned away and walked out the mess hall. Everyone was staring at me, as if I was in huge trouble. I gulped and quietly followed.<br />
<br />
He led me through the intricate, labyrinthine corridors, down stairs and deep underground. He never turned back to check if I was still <br />
following, but assumed that I wouldn't dare disobey. Finally, after a tense while of walking, he opened a large door and led me inside.<br />
<br />
There was a large desk and a number of attractive chairs, all lit by oil-light. I wasn't sure if this was his office or his private quarters. He turned <br />
to me and gave me a stern expression.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don'th need to tell you again, do I?&quot;<br />
&quot;No,&quot; I stuttered, before riskily adding, &quot;Shir.&quot;<br />
He didn't react.<br />
&quot;You know whath will happen if anyone knowsh?&quot;<br />
I nervously nodded.<br />
&quot;I thorry,&quot; he bowed his head.<br />
I was so startled I nearly said &quot;I forgive you,&quot;. But I kept quiet.<br />
&quot;I couldn't waith another shecond.&quot;<br />
<br />
He unclipped his cape and let it drop to the floor. Then he lifted his sash over his head and dropped that too. At first, I thought he was just <br />
dispensing with frivolity, but then he unbuckled his belt and let his kilt drop. I stared as his monster cock bobbed before me, intensely hard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on,&quot; He urged, &quot;Why are you waithing?&quot;<br />
<br />
He grabbed my loin-cloth and ripped it off my body. I flinched, no idea what I was supposed to do. Then he knelt before me and took my cock <br />
into his mouth.</p>
