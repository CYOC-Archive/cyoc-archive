<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You are Mike, you're thirty-four years old, and you've just been convicted and sentenced for a crime you didn't commit. You were supposed to have raped the friend of a friend. You didn't do it but genetic testing on the semen in her womb showed that it was you. Your lawyers tried to argue that because of Gen-Tech anyone could have raped that woman. Unfortunately the testing didn't show any anomalies caused by the use of Gen-Tech products. There was no argument that could be made to vindicate you.<br />
<br />
Now you're here at the Gen-Tech store that just opened in your city for your sentence to be carried out. Once Gen-Tech came out with their &quot;permanent&quot; line judges began to sentence convicts to be transformed. This relieved jail overcrowding. This naturally led to the need for parents to watch over the convicts that were sentenced to be age regressed to children. That was your sentence, to be age regressed to a child. The judge in your case also ordered you to become a girl.<br />
<br />
You're lucky in one respect, your girlfriend will be taking care of you. When you had heard that there would be a Gen-Tech store opening in your city you and your girlfriend had applied to become State Parents. Both of your applications were approved. You hadn't taken anyone in since you were approved. Of course you wouldn't be taking anyone in now with your conviction. Your girlfriend however could and she would be your mother. At least you'll be there to help with your child.<br />
<br />
The judge was a little lenient in your case and allowed you to pick your own age as long as it was under ten years old. Now you were standing outside of the new Gen-Tech to carry out your sentence. A female police officer was with you to make sure that you didn't escape and that the judges order was carried out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well what are you waiting for?&quot; the police officer asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just thinking about how I got here&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shouldn't have raped that woman then.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't rape her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's what they all say until the genetics prove otherwise. You're an odd case though. You keep maintaining your innocence where others confess in the hopes of getting a lighter sentence. Why do you continue to say you didn't do it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I didn't. I don't know how the genetics showed that I did but it's wrong.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Logic says you did but I have this gut feeling that you may be right. I guess the judge has that gut feeling too seeing as how she's letting your girlfriend be your mother. Well there's not much use in delaying. We'd better go in and pick out what you need.&quot;<br />
<br />
You sigh and go in followed by the police officer. You had been looking forward to coming in here with your girlfriend to try some of the animal parts. Now your first time in here was marred by your conviction. A girl who didn't look any older than eleven with demon horns, bat like wings, and a demon tail came up to you and said &quot;Welcome to Gen-Tech. How may I help you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We're here to carry out a sentence&quot; The police officer said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought I recognized you&quot; the girl said looking at you. &quot;You'll want to use the computers to get your new body together. Have you used them before?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is my first time in a Gen-Tech store&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, I'll walk you through using one&quot; the girl said and walked over to one of the computers. &quot;The first thing you want to do is place your hand on the scanner. Then you'll need to choose between &quot;permanent&quot; or temporary body modification. After that you need to choose either partial or full body modification. On the next screen you'll need to choose what sort of modifications you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
You did as the girl said. Of course you had to select &quot;permanent&quot; and full body modification. You then selected female for gender and eight for age. The image on the screen showed what you would look like. You were satisfied with what you would look like and said &quot;Ok, I'm done.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now you can print out a list of the parts you need&quot; the girl said. &quot;The print out will also have your new measurements on it so you can buy clothes. We don't want to be running around naked now do we.&quot;<br />
<br />
You sighed and printed out the list and went to get all the parts you would need. After checking out you went to a children's clothing store to buy your new clothes. The police officer helped you pick out the clothes since she had an eight year old girl herself. You ended up getting a pink dress, white tights, black Mary Janes, a package of panties, a pair of shorts, a pink short sleeve tee shirt, and a pair of sandals to get you started. After buying the clothes you head home to your girlfriend who would soon become your mother.<br />
<br />
You arrive home and your girlfriend is there waiting for you. She had taken the day off just so she could be with you when you change. That's just another thing about your case. Usually the convict is taken to an adoption center to be transformed. You were allowed to transform at home as long as a police officer was there. You go up to your girlfriend and give her one of your last kisses as her boyfriend. When you move apart you see tears streaming down her cheeks and ask &quot;Are you alright Allison?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No I'm not alright!&quot; Allison said. &quot;I'm losing you! It's not fair! You didn't do it!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We both know that but somehow the genetics were wrong and firmly identified me as the rapist&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
&quot;But you're not!&quot; Allison said.<br />
<br />
&quot;There's nothing we can do about it unless some new evidence comes to light&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't want to lose you though!&quot; Allison said. &quot;What about our baby!?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen to me Allison&quot; you said in a gentle tone. What you were about to say was going to hurt both of you but you needed to say it. &quot;I want you to find someone else. That way our baby will have a father.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I want you!&quot; Allison said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know&quot; you said. &quot;You'll have to move on though. I don't see my conviction being overturned.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I still don't like it!&quot; Allison said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is my room ready?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes&quot; Allison said in a small voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then let's go up so we can get this over with&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't want to see it!&quot; Allison said. &quot;It would be like watching you die!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Or it could be like watching me be reborn&quot; you said. &quot;I'm not going to force you to watch it but I would like you with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Does that cop have to watch?&quot; Allison asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm afraid that I do&quot; the police officer said. &quot;And my name is Harriette Hayes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do you need to though?&quot; Allison asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I need to certify that Mike has indeed changed&quot; Harriette said. &quot;For what it's worth I'd rather not be doing this. I don't believe he raped that woman. Unfortunately what I believe isn't evidence.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't do this!&quot; Allison said. &quot;I won't have anybody to help me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll still be able to help you as much as an eight year old can&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll offer my help too&quot; Harriette said. &quot;I'm sure my brother will help too if I ask him. You won't be alone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That makes me feel a little better&quot; Allison said. &quot;You better do this before I try to stop you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then let's go up to my room&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
You and Allison head upstairs followed closely by Harriette. You're grateful for her offer to help Allison, she's going to need all the friends and help she can get. You open a door and step into your room. Allison had it decorated like you had asked. There was a little girl's canopy bed, a few dolls on top of a white dresser with pink knobs, a nightstand with a Barbie lamp (you're surprised that Barbie is still popular with young girls today), a Barbie dollhouse in one corner of the room, and a white desk for you to do homework on. You are going to be an eight year old girl and the law said you had to go to school. It was highly debated whether or not the age regressed would be required by law to go to school. Eventually it was decided that the age regressed would be required to go to school under the law.<br />
<br />
You walk over to the bed and laid out your stuff. You sigh and get undressed. You weren't really comfortable with Harriette there but she had a job to do and you needed to be naked. Once you had your clothes off you picked up the body suit. It was small but you were assured that it would stretch to fit you. The body suit turned your body into a blank slate. You step into it and it did stretch to fit you. Once you finished getting the body part on you reach for the hood.<br />
<br />
Allison stops you and says &quot;Give me one last kiss before you put that hood on.&quot;<br />
<br />
You couldn't help but grant her that. Your kiss was long and passionate. When you finally broke apart tears were streaming down her cheeks again. You quickly put on the hood before you lose your nerve and Harriette would need to step in. As soon as the hood was on and in place the body suit tightened around you. It became so tight that you couldn't feel anything. You were still able to see through the hood and you saw everything growing. Of course everything else stayed the same size as before, it was you that was shrinking. After a few moments things stopped seeming to grow and the body suit wasn't tight anymore. In fact it seemed like it wasn't even there and when you touched your arm it felt like your skin.<br />
<br />
You pick up the eyes next and place them over your own eyes. It was a strange feeling. The eyes pushed themselves into your own and you momentarily lost your sight. Once you regained it you picked up the lips and they pressed themselves onto your own mouth. Next was the nose and then the ears. You put the eyebrows and hair on next. You decide to put on the finger and toe nails next.<br />
<br />
Now there were only two pieces left, the nipples and your new genitals. You pick up the nipples and place them on your chest. Finally you pick up the genitals, the final piece to complete your transformation into an eight year old girl. You hesitate but you know that you've come too far to turn back. You couldn't turn back anyway and you felt a pressure building up in your bladder. You knew you would have to pee but you needed to put this final piece on first. You look at Allison and put it on. You feel something burrowing into your crotch.<br />
<br />
You feel the pressure in your bladder rise and you run to the bathroom. You just barely make it to the bathroom and no sooner had you sat on the toilet than your bladder let go. It was strange peeing from between your legs instead of from a penis. You're sure that you'll get used to it in time. You finish peeing and was about to get up when you remembered that girls had to wipe when they were finished peeing. You grab some toilet paper and wipe. You get up, flush, and head back to your room.<br />
<br />
Once back in your room Harriette says &quot;Well there's only one more thing that needs to be done. You need a name now and your mother should be the one to name you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I'll name her Amy Lynn Harrison&quot; Allison said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why Harrison?&quot; you asked. &quot;Why not your last name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because Harrison was your last name when you were my boyfriend&quot; Allison said. &quot;It should still be your last name.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're sure you want her name to be Amy Lynn Harrison?&quot; Harriette asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I am&quot; Allison said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok&quot; Harriette said. &quot;I need to get back to the station to file my report. Perhaps I can stop by with my husband and daughter later. We'll go out for dinner. It will be my treat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds like a good idea&quot; Allison said. &quot;I appreciate this. I already miss the intimacy Mike and I had.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm missing it too&quot; you said. &quot;There's nothing we can do about it though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I'll see you two tonight then&quot; Harriette said. &quot;We'll pick you up if that's ok.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That'll be fine&quot; Allison said. &quot;I don't think I'll be any shape to drive anywhere tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We should be here around seven then&quot; Harriette said.<br />
<br />
After Harriette left Allison said &quot;You need to get dressed. When I agreed to be your mother I didn't realize how hard it would be.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know what you mean Allie&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please don't call me that&quot; Allison said. &quot;Hearing my nick name from my daughter is a little unnerving. Besides we have to get used to our new rolls. That means you should be calling me Mom or Mommy. Is that clear Mike, I mean Amy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Al... Mommy&quot; you said. It was going to take some getting used to.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go ahead and put your dress on&quot; Allison said. &quot;After that you can play but don't get your dress dirty.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok Mommy&quot; you said. You had almost said Allie but you caught yourself in time. &quot;I might need some help with my dress. I haven't worn one before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok I'll help you&quot; Allison said.<br />
<br />
It turned out that you did need help with your dress. After you were dressed you played with your Barbie dolls. You remember your sister and her friends playing with Barbies but they weren't like the ones you had. These Barbies were high tech robots that interacted with you and each other.<br />
<br />
After a few hours Allison called you downstairs to go to dinner.</p>
