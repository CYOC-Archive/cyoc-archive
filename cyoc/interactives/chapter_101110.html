<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Samantha and Frances Twist made it home in time to fix breakfast for themselves, their son Ben, and his beau Alex Ramsey.<br />
They didn&#39;t know how long the boys might have actually been there, nor never said anything about their whereabouts and activities the previous night. The four just accepted that they were all mature, consenting adults (at least as far as the Moon Lake laws governing weres said), and left it at that. The fact that all of them could smell the lingering aromatic odor of hot and heavy sexual activity remained unmentioned.<br />
After Alex left with Ben to attend his boyfriend&#39;s football practice, the Twists started cleaning up from breakfast and catching up on housework until there was a knock on their front door.<br />
It was Eric Anderson, briefly stopping by to return a book he borrowed from Ben.<br />
It was a spur of the moment decision to use Eric as a courier between themselves and Ben, to which the young Anderson agreed.<br />
When he left, Frances snuggled up to her wife and asked, &quot;Do you know how sexy you smell right now?&quot;<br />
&quot;As good as you honey,&quot;  replied Samantha, before they embraced in a passionate kiss. &quot;That Maggie is one hot bitch. If she already isn&#39;t part of one, we should invite her to join our pride,&quot; she added, leading her wife to their bedroom.<br />
&quot;Agreed,&quot; said Frances, as they started undressing each other hastily. &quot;But let me ask you something. Have you ever thought about maybe...&quot;<br />
&quot;What dear?&quot; wondered Samantha, as she started licking her wife&#39;s hard nipples while running a hand across Frances&#39; wet cunt.<br />
Frances steeled her courage and said, &quot;Doing it with a man?&quot; which stopped Samantha in her tracks.<br />
&quot;Are you serious?&quot; asked Samantha in return, staring directly eye to eye at Frances.<br />
&quot;Well... we certainly enjoy things like the double headed dildo and other... accessories. It took a while to get over our concerns, but we certainly enjoy licking out Martha&#39;s cunt after Willam&#39;s fucked her during our weekly get togethers.&quot;<br />
&quot;That&#39;s different. It&#39;s still Martha&#39;s creamy juices, just flavored differently,&quot; replied Samantha.<br />
&quot;Well, you were too busy 69ing Martha to notice I had a chance to eat out Maggie after Evan fucked her, and that tasted good too.&quot;<br />
&quot;So?&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not talking about changing our <i>relationship</i>,&quot; said Frances, assuming her werecat form while putting her now furry arms around her wife. &quot;You are the first, last, and <b>only</b> person I will ever love,&quot; she added, before kissing Samantha again. &quot;I&#39;m just suggesting the possibility of maybe expanding our fun times.&quot;<br />
&quot;Can we talk about this later? Right now I want to have some fun with my wife,&quot; said Samantha, assuming her fursona while pushing Frances back to their bed.<br />
<br />
IN SEATTLE...<br />
&quot;An ankle bracelet!&quot; exclaimed Mike Lawson, staring at his son. &quot;If anyone needed one of those, it was that bastard Jeremy. You should have—&quot;<br />
&quot;Trust me dad, if the local LEOs* hadn&#39;t of shown up when they did, we&#39;d be having all our conversations through the glass partition of a prison visiting room,&quot; said Evan Lawson, looking at the man who sired him. They were sitting in the living room of the older Lawson&#39;s Seattle apartment, sharing beers while watching college football on TV. His father&#39;s hair was now gray across the temples, and there were a few lines on his face around the eyes and mouth, but Mike Lawson looked pretty good for a man in his early 60s, which placed him closer to 300 as a werewolf.<br />
&quot;Well, you certainly pulled a few stunts in your day,&quot; his father reminded Evan, &quot;but your mother and I never had to go to such extremes.&quot;<br />
&quot;Spencer can be difficult at times,&quot; replied Evan.<br />
&quot;Well, she&#39;s also had it harder than you did too.&quot;<br />
&quot;How do you figure that?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, for one thing, your mother and I didn&#39;t have you until after I finished my military service, so you had the benefits of being raised by two parents in a stable environment. How much has Maggie had to handle on her own while you were deployed, let alone how much have you moved around between assignments since Spencer was born?&quot; his father asked pointedly.<br />
&quot;Are you saying this is all my fault?&quot; asked Evan, staring at his father.<br />
&quot;Hell no, but it&#39;s certainly your fault for not acknowledging the differences and adjusting accordingly.&quot;<br />
Evan Lawson took a good, hard look at his father; then stared at the living room carpeting some.<br />
Mike Lawson just sat there, sipping his beer while waiting for his son to say something.<br />
When Evan finally spoke, his father was surprised to hear, &quot;You may be right.&quot;<br />
Father looked closely at son, then said, &quot;This may also be your mother&#39;s and mine fault to an extent. We raised you to be a good man, but I&#39;m afraid we never did anything to teach you how to be a good father and parent.&quot;<br />
&quot;So, how do I correct this dad?&quot; asked Evan.<br />
&quot;First off, when you get home, take that damn ankle monitor off Spencer. Then, other than talking to Maggie to see where you two go from here with my granddaughter, I wish I knew.&quot;<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
Spencer Lawson eagerly welcomed Eric Anderson into her home, glad not only for the company, but for the chance to see him again too.<br />
Even though nothing sexual happened, their night together was still on her mind as they sat down on the living room sofa next to each other and started talking.<br />
Eric couldn&#39;t help staring at the girl in her tight shirt, form fitting pants, and walking around barefoot. Spencer loved <i>that</i> attention.<br />
But she didn&#39;t like Eric noticing the ankle monitor, which Spencer quickly explained. Then he saw how badly the bottom of her feet looked. While healed, there was evidence of multiple bite marks and scratches on the soles.<br />
&quot;WHAT HAPPENED?&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;Are you all right?&quot;<br />
Self conscious, Spencer quickly tucked her feet under her, Indian style, as she replied, &quot;Old wounds. Before we moved to Moon Lake. A word of friendly advice. Never date a were-rottweiler.&quot;<br />
&quot;Except for the fact I had a heated phone call with her this morning that resulted in us now officially on break for the time being, you know everything that&#39;s happened between me and Julie Stovall. If you&#39;d like to talk about it...&quot;<br />
Spencer Lawson was able to keep herself from smiling at the fact that the were-mermaid was at least temporarily out of Eric&#39;s life, but found herself unable to keep from talking about her past crush and interest in the 19 year old Jeremy Bower. Of how it seem good at first, but quickly deteriorated, before he &quot;marked&quot; Spencer as &quot;his and his alone&quot;.<br />
By the time she was done relating her past with Bower, Spencer was surprised to find her head lying on Eric&#39;s shoulder as he held her in his arms.<br />
She looked up, shocked to see the shoulder of Eric&#39;s t-shirt wet from her tears, for Spencer had vowed the last of them had been shed over that &quot;waste of space&quot; months ago.<br />
&quot;Eric, I...&quot;<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay Spencer,&quot; he said gently, while brushing the hair out of her face.<br />
Then Spencer Lawson was happily surprised when Eric Anderson kissed her.<br />
Sweetly, romantically, like a gentleman.<br />
It was their first kiss, but it would be far from their last.<br />
