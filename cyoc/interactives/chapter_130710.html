<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“What choice do we have,” Kaitlin whispered. Laura watched as her friend reached for the silver dice that layer upon the counter. “Kaitlin are you sure,” Laura said quickly. “Maybe we don’t have to do this, maybe there’s another way. You don’t have to get even younger.”<br />
<br />
“Laura,” Kaitlin said sternly. “Look at us. We’re already kids and I know you can feel yourself becoming younger. This is are only chance, if I don’t we’re going to end up having to grow up all over again.”Laura opened her mouth before closing it, Kaitlin was right. She didn’t want to admit it but she was thinking younger, acting younger. The power within the dice had returned their youth alright and was making them whatever age they became body and soul. If they didn’t fix this soon they would end up becoming 13 and 14 years old. “Your right,” she said. “Just be careful....and good luck.”<br />
<br />
Kaitlin smiled shyly as she looked down at the silver dice in her hand. She needed to roll a one if the two of them were going to end this nightmare. Failure to do so would make her even younger and then it would be up to Laura. If Laura failed the two could end up rolling themselves out of existence, what then. Kaitlin shuddered at the thought, closing her eyes she dropped the die, hoping for the best.<br />
<br />
“Fourteen years you have walked this earth. Now this number is but eleven. Each roll of the dice returns more of what you have lost.”<br />
<br />
“Nooooo,” Kaitlin moaned as her eyes flashed open. Already she could see her body glowing as orbs of light began to drift from her body. Kaitlin watched her body in horror as she could see her once proud breasts shrink away to nothing. Looking to her friend for support she was startled to see her slowly growing taller. Kaitlin was dumbstruck until she realized it wasn’t Laura growing taller, she was growing smaller. Kaitlin’s jaw dropped as she watched her body become younger. She looked down to see her feet shrink in the flip flops she wore, making them at least two sizes to big. Finally the girls sweatpants dropped from her narrow hips, pooling around her tiny feet.<br />
<br />
Laura had watched Kaitlin’s regression in shock. The girl had gone from a waifish and coltish teen to a child in only moments. Any teenage maturity she had in her face was wiped away instantly leaving a honey haired fifth grader in its wake. Looking down she could see the girl was now quite a bit shorter, perhaps 4’7”. Covering her mouth Laura shock her head in sadness as the young girl gazed up at her. “I’m so sorry Kaitlin,” she whimpered.<br />
<br />
Kaitlin sighed as she now tried to compose herself. The latest bit of regression had left her feeling even younger than before. She now tried to regain her adult composure, which seemed to be slowly slipping away from her. “Laura it’s okay,” she said in a childish tone. Reaching for the golden dice the girl now held it out to the teen in front of her. “It’s up to you now Laura you can do this.”<br />
<br />
Shakily Laura took hold of the golden dice, staring at it blankly. The last thing she wanted to do was to roll that thing again. It seemed unfair that she had to be reduced to a child after all of this. Being a near flat chested 13 year old was bad enough but if she was ever going to have any hope of regaining her adulthood she would need to become even younger. Silently praying she closed her hands around the dice before tossing it onto the counter.<br />
<br />
“Thirteen years you have walked this earth. Now this number is but eleven. Each roll of the dice returns more of what you have lost.”<br />
<br />
Laura let out a sigh of relief as her body began to tingle. As she watched the orbs of light float off of her body she felt the oddest sensation. Laura could feel herself growing smaller, the sensation felt like a gentle pulling on her body as if some invisible force was pulling her limbs downwards. Staring first at her hands and then her feet she stared in wide eyed shock as they became smaller. Reaching for her loosening sweatpants she now held them in place as the last of her adult curves vanished leaving her a child. Looking at her friend Laura was amaZed that Kaitlin only seemed a few inches shorter than her now. Gazing at her surroundings she estimated herself at about 5 foot even. Tall for an 11 year old but much shorter than she was used to.<br />
<br />
“You did it,” Kaitlin cried as she threw herself into a tight hug. Laura smiled in relief as she returned her friends embrace. As the two friends seperated they couldn’t help but marvel at their childish faces. While they were still recognizable to eachother any adult features they once had were completely wiped away. The two girls now standing before them were the childish shadows of their former adult selves.<br />
<br />
“Well done girls,” the old man said. “Now let me put these away for safe keeping.” Carefully the old man placed the dice back in the box. “You two just need to decide who to gift them to now. Once that’s done we can fix this problem of yours.”<br />
<br />
After much debate Laura and Kaitlin finally decided on who to send the dice to. As they carefully wrapped the package with the address the girls placed it in the shops outgoing mail. The two fifth graders watched as the mailman grabbed the package a short time later, taking it to its next owner. As the girls watched the package leave they felt an odd sensation course through their bodies. Turning they could see the old man nod. “Yeah the dice are no longer connected to you,” he said. “So you two have no fear of getting any younger.” Sighing in relief the two now approached the counter.<br />
<br />
“So you said you can give us what we want,” Laura asked curiously. The old Man nodded as he gave the two girls a small coin. “This right here is a wishing coin,” he stated. “All you two need to do is hold on to it and make a wish. Once that’s done it will give you whatever you wished for.”<br />
<br />
Laura and Kaitlin nodded as they handed the old man $20 a piece. “So you ready,” Laura asked. Kaitlin nodded and smiled. “Absolutely,” She’s said. “It wasn’t fun for a minute but I think Im ready to go back to being my old self.” The girls laughed together as they grasped the coin. Closing their eyes the two girls now silently made a wish.</p>
