<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I need you to come with me on a few errands,” Martha explained through an entire honey baked ham, “Nothing crazy, I just need you to get wherever I can’t reach.” Jason realized that with how enormous his mother was, she probably couldn’t bend down as easily anymore. That probably meant that he was supposed to help her with the lower shelves.<br />
<br />
“Uhh, totally,” he agreed timidly, still grasping the concept that this hulking parody of the American human was his mother. It wasn’t like he had any plans that day, and he was curious about how the world would react to seeing his transformed family.<br />
<br />
“Ooh, that reminds me,” Elizabeth added with bits of chewed up egg spraying over the table, “I need to restock on protein powder! I ran out the other day!”<br />
<br />
“Darcy and I need more panties,” Marcy piped up, “Ours all got broken somehow.”<br />
<br />
“Marcy,” the other twin blushed with embarrassment, “didja hafta tell the whole table?”<br />
<br />
“Hey, if we’re making requests,” Martin added to the list, “if you could find more of that Mexican beer, I’ll appreciate it!”<br />
<br />
“Already on the list, pork pie,” Martha replied with a slobbery kiss on her husband’s jiggling cheek, “and Jason, if there’s anything you want you can just chuck it in the basket, okay?”<br />
<br />
With a nod, Jason quickly excused himself from the table of voracious sweaty hogs and rushed back into the bathroom to scrub himself in the sink. By the time he was done, his new fat family had just finished eating and his mother was standing upright. She waddled towards the front door and motioned for him to follow. Jason had to crane his head upward to look at her face since otherwise he would be staring headlong into her exposed gargantuan gut.<br />
<br />
He joined his mother in the the front of the family van, which had gotten much bigger to accommodate his suddenly huge family. It was more like a small bus than a van at this point. The fat on her arms and the muffin top spilling out of her mom jeans jiggled and sloshed with the movement of the car as it trundled along. Of all the different things, why did the witch curse him with this crazy new life? He could have been turned into a newt or a slug, but why did she have to transform his family into giant slobs? If it was to make him suffer, well mission a-freaking-complished!<br />
<br />
Jason turned to ask his mother a question when he saw her jam a thick finger up her nose to take care of an itch. He froze when she dug out a huge, crusty green booger and then eat it without a second thought. His face turned green itself and he feared that he was suddenly gonna blow chunks. Is there anything this ham planet that replaced his mom wouldn’t eat?<br />
<br />
“You okay, Honey Bunch?” Martha asked him with concern, “You’ve been quiet the whole time.”<br />
<br />
“De-I... uhh,” Jason stammered, “It’s nothing. Just a lot on my mind.” He debated with himself over whether he should tell her about the witch’s curse. Would she even believe him? He figured she would think he was crazy, and he didn’t need that in his life.<br />
<br />
“Is it about your new girlfriend, sweetie?” Martha asked innocently, “I must say, for such a little thing Chloe is quite the cutie!”<br />
<br />
“I... I mean yeah, but I was thinking about something else.”<br />
<br />
“It’s okay, dear. You can tell me anything. Are you two doing okay?”<br />
<br />
“Uh, yeah, better than okay, but-“<br />
<br />
“You two, you know, done it yet?”<br />
<br />
“I... WHAT?!”<br />
<br />
“You know, sex. Have you two done it yet?”<br />
<br />
“N-no!” Jason was red in the face, “Why would you ask me about that kind of stuff?!”<br />
<br />
“Just making sure my baby stays safe,” Martha chuckled, “no need to worry! It’s not like I’m going to try to come between you two or anything. It’s only natural for two people in an intimate relationship to want to experiment.”<br />
<br />
“Mom, please! I don’t wanna talk about this right now! We haven’t even considered it yet!”<br />
<br />
“Alright, just wanted to be sure. If you like I could give you a few pointers... maybe a little hands on experience, too.”<br />
<br />
“Woah woah woah! WHAT?!” Jason squealed, “W-With you’re own... what the FUCK? T-that’s... that’s literally what incest is, Mom!”<br />
<br />
“Oh I wasn’t planning on going that far,” she chuckled as though Jason was the one being ridiculous, “I mean, if you were thinking that then I would be happy to-“<br />
<br />
“HEY! Look at that! There’s the store now!” Jason hastily redirected the conversation, completely prepared to crave death.<br />
<br />
“Oh, good eye!” Martha pulled into the parking lot, “It’s okay if you don’t wanna talk about this right now. You could have just told me.” Jason was flabbergasted at her nonchalant attitude, as though she was oblivious to how wild that conversation went. “Could you help me get out of the car? I seem to be stuck.”<br />
<br />
“Wha... I... sure?” Jason replied as he got out of the van. He opened the driver side door and grabbed his mother’s oversized arms. After a couple of hard tugs, he managed to dislodge her hips and belly from her seat and out of the doorframe with a wet pop. Suddenly she lost balance and stumbled forward. She was able to catch herself because she fell completely over, but Jason’s head wound up lodged in her watermelon sized boobs anyway.<br />
<br />
“Oh ho! Jason, you little card!” Martha giggles as she helps pull him out. His hair and face were drenched with salty breast sweat. “If you wanted to play with my tits, you could always ask! Now let’s get inside and tackle those groceries, okay cutie?” She planted a wet kiss on his forehead and set him down.</p>
