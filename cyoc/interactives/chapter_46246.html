<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Just then Chris's cell phone ring. Frowning in irritation that his moment with Tyler was interrupted, he flipped it open. &quot;What?&quot; He asked curtly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, you should come out here and see this!&quot; His friend Marco told him from the other end. &quot;There's some really hot looking monster thingie totally trashing the pier! You gotta come out and see this!&quot;<br />
<br />
Monster? Or Demon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dave!&quot;<br />
<br />
-----------<br />
<br />
Fuck, when will it ever stop? Sid had been jacking off his cock for what seems like ages already, having shot his load several times, but even so he couldn't get his raging dick soft! His poor foreskin was rubbed raw from his fierce assault to get off, his muscles were burning from all the hard flexing and his stomach had swelled and deflated a dozen times already, once reaching the size of a weather balloon! With all his new-found strength, even he couldn't match his even greater libido.<br />
<br />
Letting out another roar, Sid came again, slashing cum all over. Breathing deeply, he looked down and saw his cock wasn't standing as hard as before. It was still pretty stiff, but now it was in a somewhat bearable level.<br />
<br />
&quot;It'll have to do.&quot; Sid groaned, not having the energy to continue on. Standing up, he cleaned himself off with a shirt that had been tossed on the ground. His paw skimmed his huge body and unfamiliar curves, the fur so soft and yet his muscles were so big and hard...NO! Thinking about it was making his cock stir again. He couldn't think of that, not until he could change himself back to normal.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now what to wear...&quot; Sid looked in his drawers. After some searching, he found a pair of sweatpants that barely fit around his thick, bulging quads. His erection was extremely noticeable, but he didn't have much of an option left.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sid!&quot; Chris suddenly pounded on his door. &quot;Sid!&quot;<br />
<br />
Quickly Sid opened the door. &quot;What? What's wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's Dave!&quot; Chris told him. &quot;I got a call from a friend. He's down by the lake, and gone mad! He's wrecking chairs, tables, anything he can get his hands on!&quot;<br />
<br />
Immediately Sid pushed all thoughts of sex out of his mind. &quot;We gotta get down there and help him!&quot; Pushing past Chris, Sid rushed straight through the living room. However, he was unaccustomed to his wider physique and accidentally bumped into the table. The dice, which someone had left near the edge, fell off and landed with a face up one and two. Right away Sid's piece moved, causing the huge lion to stop and watched in horror as his piece landed on a red MYSTIC space.<br />
<br />
All three friends looked at each other. Sid knew he had to look, but Dave needed him. However, since the board probably didn't like to be kept waiting, he forced himself to look and read out loud.<br />
<br />
[i]&quot;A word can bring you lots of fame<br />
and a bountiful load of affection<br />
So now you possess the power to give one name<br />
And possibly take care of your erection&quot;[/i]<br />
<br />
&quot;What does that mean?&quot; Tyler asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know, but right now Dave needs our help.&quot; Sid said, brushing aside the riddle and marching out, followed by Tyler and Chris.<br />
<br />
They found the incubus still at the pier, a crowd of fellow dorm mates watching as the demon pounded the mailbox in a fit of rage. Without stopping the three pushed their way through,t he crowd parting for the huge bodybuilder anthro lion, with another anthro rabbit and a short man following closely behind. On their way there, Chris had devised up a plan in case they had to forcefully detain Dave. Tyler would shrink the demon to a more manageable size, and Sid would use his muscles to hold him down and drag him back to their dorm room, and Chris will deal with crowd control.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck are you doing!?&quot; Sid roared as they came into sight of the incubus.<br />
<br />
&quot;Leave me alone!&quot; The incubus cried as he continued to pound the mailbox.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dave, you g-gotta stop it!&quot; Tyler said shakingly, trying to keep his emotions in check and not shrink.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why should I!?&quot; The incubus yelled. &quot;What's the point of being a good little boy if I can't eat, can't have sex, can't even god dammit DIE?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dave, we can get through this!&quot; Chris said. &quot;You only got a few more turns before your changes wear off!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop calling me that name!&quot; The incubus yelled. &quot;I'm not Dave!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes you are.&quot; Sid spoke softly.<br />
<br />
Everyone fell silent as they looked at the big lion. &quot;What?&quot; The incubus looked at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are David Isaac Keene, otherwise known as Dave.&quot; Sid told him, finally understanding what the riddle meant. &quot;That is your name, because I'm giving it to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Incubus sucked his breath as the full weight of those words hit him. He was Dave...he had a name! All of a sudden he felt an explosion of emotion within his previously hollow self. Sadness, Joy, Anger, Anxiety; for once in what seemed like an eternity, he felt...ALIVE. As these emotions emerged inside of him, one of them swelled up as he looked at Sid. He didn't realize it before, but Sid had the cutest mane he ever saw. Then, Dave realized that he wasn't seeing Sid as a dead corpse!<br />
<br />
Amazed, Dave couldn't help but continue to stare. How the big lion held himself, how his muscles bulged out, how he looked at Dave...it made the demon's palm sweaty and face grow hot. He wanted to suck the big lion's cock, right there and then, already Sid's cock was bulging obscenely in the too small pants.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dave?&quot; Sid said cautiously. Oh, how sweet does his name sound on that deep, masculine voice! &quot;Dave, are you alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;More than alright now Sid.&quot; Dave couldn't help but bat his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yea, uh, maybe you shouldn't drink so much beer anymore!&quot; Chris said out loud for the crowd to hear. &quot;Damn, that costume party was really fun, but lay off the alcohol you two!&quot;<br />
<br />
The students murmurred, seemingly accepting the act as a fit of drunkeness.<br />
<br />
Letting out a sigh of relief, Tyler looked up at his friends. &quot;Let's get back to our room before the police comes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right.&quot; Sid nodded, feeling uneasy with the way Dave was looking at him. It felt just like when Dave first turned into an Incubus, but somehow different.<br />
<br />
Together, the four friends made their way back to the dorms. There, they...</p>
