<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mark got dressed again in his normal clothes, while Heidi put on just a purple maternity bra and lacey panties, making sure to not get her wagging tail caught up in the process.<br />
<br />
Stretching Mark got up, when he heard a knock at their door. Puzzled by who would be visiting them at this late hour in the evening, Mark walked over and cautiously opened the door. He had to be careful not to loose his balance as a swollen belly poked through the door at him. On the other side was a pregnant blonde woman, well into her 30s, with lots of long curly hair going down her back. Much like Heidi, she too wore a maternity bra, though green and also a pair of shorts  which clearly couldn&#39;t be zipped all the way up. Lastly Mark saw something new as around her neck was a collar with a tag; he could just about make out it read &#39;Daisy&#39;. Yet now with the porches light he could see the woman look a little flush and kept fidgeting on the spot as she occasionally rubbed her thick thigs together.<br />
<br />
Brushing a couple loose strands of her away from her hefty bosom she tried to compose herself, smiling back at Mark &quot;Hi Mark, sorry to bother you, but I was wondering if Heidi had a moment, I need to ask her something&quot; punctuating her sentence as she placed a hand to her hip and the other her naked pregnant belly. <br />
<br />
Still a little confused why this regular-ish woman would wear a dog collar, Mark heard Heidi get up from behind him and come over. &quot;Oh hiya Daisy! Would you like to come in and tell me what&#39;s up?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes, thank you. These little guys have been so restless recently&quot; laughed the two inflated women as they walked over and collapsed onto the sofa. Mark having a double take when he felt Daisies hair brush against his leg, what her saw instead was actually a short bushy tail gently swaying. Whilst the two women began idly chatting, Mark pulled out the device and read the screen for Daisy. *Daisy Smith a 36 year old Spaniel woman. Pregnant, exhaustedly expecting her second overdue litter of 5. She is Mark & Heidi Barker&#39;s close next door neighbour. Currently at the start of her weekly heat cycle.* Mark thought about his former neighbour, &#39;weren&#39;t they that larger family with 3 kids that always made way to much sound? Oh and there silly dog, what was it called again... Oh yeah wasn&#39;t it Dai-&#39;. Turning around Mark stared at the woman, seeing them side to side he really was amazed Daisy was able to stand even with one hand seemingly holding up her belly at times. Walking over Mark could now clearly see it wasn&#39;t just her abundant hair he had seen, but also her pair of curly ruffled dog ears framing the side of her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;So then Heidi, I was hoping I could buy some of those pills from you, being so busy recently and constantly exhausted I must&#39;ve forgotten to buy some after my last cycle.&quot; said Daisy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh that&#39;s no problem sweetie, we just finished up my cycle here before you came around. Let me go see if I can find some of my &#39;Break-the-Rut&#39; pills, I know it can&#39;t be easy like that so don&#39;t fret&quot; replied Heidi. <br />
<br />
&quot;Your so lucky you have Mark to hand always, you know? We really should schedule another play date again, before these fellas arrive.&quot; came the unphased response from Daisy, as his wife had just casually mentioned their sex to her.<br />
<br />
Getting his attention Heidi asked &quot;Mark baby, could you go grab those for me, please? They&#39;re in the bathroom on the side remember.&quot; ending her request by blowing a kiss to him as Mark left the women to go back to their gossip once more.<br />
<br />
Pulling out his phone Mark launched into a flurry of searches, curious to see what this new world was like as clearly the reset hadn&#39;t just affected his family this time. After awhile he found out that all woman had been replaced by these dog-women, who now made up around 80% of the world, with only 20% males like him.  Thinking this would reflect in a society where more women were in leading positions, Mark saw this wasn&#39;t the case because of their weekly cycle putting women into heat, making them unable to focus on other tasks till sated. Fortunately men and women still seemed to enjoy the same rights, since in the last decade or so a company had developed pills that could help sustain women over their heat. Since the turn of the last century though the modern world had come together to enact several human rights, including the law for all women to ensure pregnancy until they had at least one male. Centres had been setup to aid in collecting, duplicating and preserving male semen, so that women could attend in order to get their mandated pregnancy. Fearing what would happen to all these excess women from these large litters, Mark was relieved to see that unwanted children were taken care of by the government and sent to one of earth&#39;s space colonies. &#39;Woah this world is much more advanced from all the extra people across time&#39; thought Mark. Through his research Mark had also discovered that Heidi was actually a manager in the same company that had invented the drug to help women in heat. &#39;Glad to see she is still as intelligent and motivated as ever&#39; Mark sighed relief. <br />
<br />
Finding the pills where they were said to be, Mark returned to find the women both caressing each others extended bellies.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll be fine dear&quot; said Daisy &quot;I still remember my first litter around your age. The procedure these days is so smooth, your out in like a day or two.&quot;<br />
<br />
Handing the pills to Daisy, she leant over to receive them, planting an expected lick on his cheek. Mark&#39;s worry settled down as he saw Heidi smiling over at the two of them. &#39;This must be some sort of normal affectionate greeting in this world&#39; rationed Mark.<br />
<br />
Once Daisy had swallowed a couple of the white pills, her flushed complexion began to settle along with her breathing returning to a more controlled rhythm.<br />
<br />
Through Mark&#39;s increased awareness of the remote, he noticed there was a &#39;Preset&#39; button. Thumbing through the options he saw a bunch of terms like *Bimbo, Maid, Girlfriend, Slutty, Sister, Parent, Wife* etc. Pointing the device at Heidi he saw the preset option for *Pregnant Wife* appear and moving it over to Daisy it read &#39;Heavily Pregnant Neighbour&#39;.<br />
<br />
Mark kept the remote pointed at Daisy and pressed *Maid*<br />
<br />
The remote whirled into life as the changes took affect.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is everything alright Master?&quot; came the timid concerned response as Mark stopped rubbing his temple and saw the spaniel girl adorned in a long black and white classical maids dress, with a hole around the waist, letting her franticly wagging tail free. Her lower apron extending outwards as it curved around and hugged her still heavily pregnant belly, while her upper apron jutted out as her breasts rested on top of her belly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Do you need me to go grab you some aspirin or m-m-maybe a glass of water? H-h-how about you put your feet up! No wait maybe-&quot; Daisy rambled off, the worry clear in her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Easy girl&quot; Mark said rubbing the passionate girls forehead as she fervently reacted by leaning into it. &quot;I&#39;m fine, just a long day is all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Daisy&#39;s tail calmed down at last hearing this good news, causing Heidi to chuckle. &quot;You are still such an excitable maid after all this time. I thought the after the first time we had you bred, you&#39;d calm down more, though I see even with 5 nothing slows your passion down&quot; sighing, Heidi also reached over and gave Daisy&#39;s laden belly a few good scratches.<br />
<br />
Still squirming Daisy peered over to you, head bowed, her frilly headdress pointing towards you &quot;Master, if you have a moment now, then c-c-could you maybe help me as well now, *please*&quot; the last part came out as a hushed whisper tinged with something like desperation.<br />
<br />
Mark stared blankly back at his maid, not sure what to do next. &quot;Come on now baby, stop teasing her! She made us that great meal and sat patiently while you got me through my heat, so go and help her now while I make a bath.&quot; Getting to her feet in a surprisingly smooth motion, Heidi left to head up the stairs. Sensually walking with barely a waddle, considering the 3, 7 month olds she was carrying, Mark was impressed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait a second, what about the pills Daisy took for her heat earlier?&quot; asked Mark before Heidi got too far away.<br />
<br />
Staring confused back at Mark, Heidi replied &quot;What do you mean? The pills she and I take help strengthen our spines and help us with our pregnancies. If there were pills for our heat cycles then women wouldn&#39;t become maids, like Heidi, and join a man&#39;s house to be bred and control their heat cycle. Maybe Daisy should get you that aspirin...&quot; Shaking her head Heidi climbed the stairs, not even needing to use the hand rail as her muscular legs easily carried her up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh and just be careful! She&#39;s not as young as me and is due any day now so take it easy with her.&quot; came the voice from upstairs.<br />
<br />
Alone with Daisy, Mark could see how agitated the mature woman had been this entire time, beads of sweat sparkled in her hair as her panting heighten as she knew what was coming. Shaking her her heads sent her droopy ears flying back and forth, along with the jiggling in her breasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Master.... Please.... I can&#39;t wait anymore...&quot; came the only exasperated reply Daisy had strength to muster right now.</p>
