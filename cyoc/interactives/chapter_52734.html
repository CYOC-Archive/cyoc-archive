<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brian stared into the vanity mirror, wondering how his truly had arrived at this moment in time. Reflected back was a girl, that if someone looked hard enough, they would have sworn they were looking at an androgynous male.<br />
<br />
Sighing, Brian looked down at the red dress he was wearing and silently cursed the fact that he was so effeminate looking.<br />
<br />
Ever since he had been really young, his body had developed, until puberty, like that of a girl's. When he hit puberty, the only thing he didn't develop, like a girl would have, was breasts. Instead, he continued to grow to a height of five foot five, had really soft skin and a body that could not be mistaken for anything but a girl's...rounded butt, hourglass figure, waist and thighs looking much like a females.<br />
<br />
Sighing again, Brian thought of the events that had led him to his current predicament.<br />
<br />
A year ago Brian had been walking back to his apartment, unhappy with the ridicule he had just received from several of his coworkers, most having to do with what they considered the sloppy job he had done on the presentation and the fact that he had looked like a woman while giving the presentation.<br />
<br />
A gunshot distracted his attention and unsure, he had moved towards the sound.<br />
<br />
Peering around a corner, he saw several men standing in an alley. At their feet was a dead body, with another person on their knees, a hood covering their head. Watching, Brian saw one of the men step forward and level a gun at the kneeling person.<br />
<br />
A loud crack and the man fell over as a spray of blood exited the back of his head. Pointing at the soaked wall, the man barked out, &quot;Clean that up,&quot; as Brian backed away.<br />
<br />
Dashing back to his apartment, he hastily dialed the police and reported the crime he had witnessed. A day later, he was returning home when he saw that same group of men exiting his apartment building. Sure that they had connected him as being the one who had turned them in, Brian turned a fled.<br />
<br />
Six months later, dressed in woman's clothes, something he wasn't really happy about, he rented the current apartment he was now living in, wondering if he would ever get his old life back and taking a job as a secretary.<br />
<br />
And to make matters worse, just to shut the guy up, Brian had agreed to go on a date with a man, which was why he was now sitting in front of the vanity mirror, a red dress that just barely came midway down his thighs. Shifting the dress upward, Brian looked at his penis and testicles and thought, &quot;This is getting out of hand,&quot; and then pushed his dress back down.<br />
<br />
Looking back into the mirror, Brian teased his now long and full hair into something he hoped was pretty and then slowly started applying make-up to his skin.<br />
<br />
Next, Brian put on a set of earring that had magnets in them and standing, he moved over to his dresser and took out a thong. Walking over to his closet, he withdrew a pair of sheer pantyhose and began to dress himself in the final two pieces of his outfit, tucking his penis and testicles back.<br />
<br />
Looking into the full body mirror, making sure nothing that could give away the fact that he was wearing inserts as breasts, Brian slipped on a pair of boots that stopped just shy of his knees.<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel ridiculous,&quot; Brian thought as he looked in the mirror, taking in the five foot seven female staring back at him.<br />
<br />
Sighing again, he was just about to leave when he spied something on the floor. Walking over, he squatted down to pick it up, thinking that it must have blown in through the window at some point.<br />
<br />
Unfolding it, he read, 'Life out of control? Life not what you expected or wanted? Have you ever that you could change something? Ever wanted an outcome in your life to turn out differently? Wish you could alter something in your life that you think was unfair? Something that forced you to make a choice you found out you didn't like the outcome?<br />
<br />
'Well, if so, now you can. Imagine you could change something in your life...be it something about how you look or perhaps a choice you made in your past that you regret ever making. What's more is that you will be the only one not oblivious to the changes happening. The world around you will continue to act as if nothing out of the ordinary is happening. Just write your wish below, sit back and enjoy what is happening.<br />
<br />
'Unhappy with you wish? Just tear up the note and everything will revert back to before you ever made your wish. Note: You are allotted only one wish, so wish carefully.'<br />
<br />
Staring at the note, thinking, &quot;This is a joke,&quot; Brian folded the note and walked over to his vanity.<br />
<br />
Tossing the note on top, he stared at it and then thought, &quot;I have a date I don't want to go on to meet,&quot; and then, without giving it a second thought, sat down on the stool, staring at the note.<br />
<br />
After a moment, he unfolded the note again and reread what was written. Pondering over whether the note was some sort of joke or not, Brian selected an eye-liner pencil and thinking it over carefully, he began to write on the paper.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish,&quot; he began. &quot;That the world saw and knew me as the girl I am currently posing as, Heather Tamera. And it doesn't matter if I am clothed, disrobed, having sex or using a tampon...they would only see a normal female.<br />
<br />
&quot;While people are seeing a woman, I will be slowly turning into a girl, starting with some random feature of my body and ending with my penis and testicles reverting to that of the normal genitals of a woman. But, my wish doesn't end there.<br />
<br />
&quot;After one month, roughly about the time that my transformation to being a woman has completed, I will start regressing in age until I have regressed back to the age of four. From there I will grow up a normal and healthy girl, becoming one day the woman I had become after I made this wish.<br />
<br />
&quot;And to top it all off, I shall not be on the run, never having witnessed a horrible crime that set these events in motion. This is my wish. If this isn't a joke, please make it come true.&quot;<br />
<br />
Setting down the eye-liner pencil, Brian looked over what he had just written, picked up the eye-line, edited a bit here and there, and then folding the note up, he asked aloud, &quot;What am I doing? This is ridiculous,&quot; and standing, he strolled to the bedroom window and tossed the note out.<br />
<br />
Hurrying out of the bedroom, Brian grabbed the purse on he had left on the table by the front door and making sure he had his keys, he left, concerned only by the fact that he might be late and not the wish he had just made.</p>
