<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Trevor thought for a moment, and had a fun idea. What if he grew over at his friend&#39;s house! He wondered what it would be like to delay the growth substantially, and to slowly but surely grow out of his clothes.<br />
<br />
Mind made up, Trevor set the transformation time to 2 hours. Doing the math, he realized that would be around an inch every 10 minutes. He didn&#39;t know how his balls would grow, but he assumed they scaled in a similar way. Clicking start on the transmitter, he fired it at himself. Nothing seemed to happen. Quickly throwing on clothes, Trevor threw on a pair of briefs and then some basketball shorts, making sure to choose a larger size than he normally wore, just in case. He didn&#39;t know what space a cock the size of his arm would need, but just in case... he also brought a heavy jacket. As a last thought, he brought the transmitter. He couldn&#39;t reprogram it without his computer, but it was still configured to increase whoever&#39;s cock it was fired at.<br />
<br />
Practically running over to his friend&#39;s house, Trevor checked the clock. 10 minutes had already passed, which meant his cock should already be a bit bigger. In fact, now that Trevor thought about it, his briefs did seem a little tighter than before. He shivered with excitement at the thought of growing a lot bigger. He wasn&#39;t sure what would happen to his clothes, whether they would rip, stretch, or simply contain his new monster.<br />
<br />
Trevor was brought out of his thoughts by his arrival at his friend&#39;s house. Brady was one of Trevor&#39;s closest friends, and had been from the second grade. The two enjoyed playing Xbox together, so it was no surprise that pretty soon after Trevor&#39;s arrival, he found himself sitting on a beanbag chair in front of the TV with a controller in hand. Brady sat in front of him with a second controller in hand.<br />
<br />
The two started a game, but Trevor was having some trouble concentrating. The tightness in his briefs was more noticeable now. Glancing at his shorts, Trevor could see a small bulge. Even though it was barely visible, Trevor knew he had never had one before. Trevor checked his watch. It had been just past 20 minutes from the start of his transformation. He felt giddy inside, incredibly happy. It was working! As a last thought, Trevor placed a pillow over his bulge. He wanted to not see it until the end.<br />
<br />
Eventually Trevor finally managed to get his cock off his mind and actually did begin to do better. Brady and Trevor laughed about various school events along the way, other friends, and in general life. However, although Trevor&#39;s crotch was hidden from view, he knew it was still growing because he could feel his cock slowly moving, as if it were slipping downwards and around inside his briefs, which were really starting to feel tight. Yet strangely, the pressure felt good around his genitals.<br />
<br />
Brady and Trevor&#39;s game was suddenly interrupted by Brady&#39;s mother announcing the pizza that they had ordered had finally arrived. Brady quickly paused the game and left the room to get the pizza boxes. Trevor tried to think about anything else, the game, his friend, but no, the tightness in his briefs was too great to ignore. Trevor removed the pillow from across his crotch, and gasped. The small bulge from earlier had grown! Not only that, but it had become more defined. Trevor could see his cockhead through his shorts as it pushed outward against his briefs, searching for more space.<br />
<br />
Just as Trevor was about to release the monster and give it some much-needed room when Brady came back with the pizza. The friends munched on the slices. All Trevor could think of was the unbearable pressure in his groin, curled up tightly in his briefs. Finally, they finished the pizza and had just unpaused the game when...<br />
<br />
*rip*<br />
<br />
He heard a small ripping sound, out of nowhere. At first he was clueless but then he realized: his cock was actually ripping through his briefs! On that thought, he felt something begin to move down below. Trevor was confused, the growth shouldn&#39;t suddenly speed up? Then he realized - he was getting hard from the thought of busting out of his briefs. Of all the times to get an erection, he thought.<br />
<br />
Trevor heard another ripping noise, a much louder one this time. Then he felt a sudden loss of pressure, and knew that his cock had fully ripped through his briefs. Brady looked over curiously, having heard the noise and Trevor shrugged, pretending to not know. Then, after Brady looked away, Trevor lifted the pillowcase and his jaw dropped.<br />
<br />
Before today, the phrase &quot;pitching a tent&quot; had never applied to Trevor. His cock had never really been able to produce a sizable bulge and when it did, he could always hide it easily. What Trevor had now was almost impossible to hide easy. His manhood had managed to become fully erect in the loose basketball shorts and pointed skyhigh. It was clearly much bigger than his cock previously, if he had to guess, it would be a foot long. Trevor quickly pulled his cock down and through the waistband of his shorts. He could feel his cock pulsing on his stomach, but it was better than the huge tent. Flashing a smile at Brady, Trevor continued the game.<br />
<br />
As he continued playing, Trevor noticed it had been an hour and a half since he had first started the transformation. Doing the mental math, that meant his cock would be somewhere in the neighborhood of... 13 inches erect! Trevor was probably the biggest on the planet he couldn&#39;t believe it.<br />
<br />
Trevor could feel his cock slowly creeping up his shirt as it continued to grow longer and longer. It was also growing thicker, and becoming harder to hide. Thankfully Trevor&#39;s erection dissipated, though the bulge was still enormous. Thank goodness for the basketball shorts...<br />
<br />
Suddenly Trevor&#39;s alarm rang. It had been 2 hours. Trevor felt his cock seem to pulse one more time, then calm. He breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
