<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lancelot stood there amongst modern men and women of varying ages. The only person he recognized in the room was Merlin, yet he felt an air of familiarity with two other people somehow, a teenage girl whom he&#39;d never seen before and a toddler who looked familiar by the face to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Merlin, what is this about? You should not have brought me here, if Miro finds out what you&#39;ve done....&quot; Lancelot began. &quot;Miro is gone, his son, his other son is now the lord and ruler of the vampire nation.&quot; Nat informed the old knight.<br />
<br />
&quot;His...other son? I thought he had only one living heir? Duke, wasn&#39;t it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, well, the long short of it is, Miro found someone who was...a better fit for his family. Also due to a blood transfusion, the new lord also has Miro&#39;s blood in him.&quot; Spark explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;I...don&#39;t understand. You summon me here to tell me the lord I serve is gone and there is a new lord I must serve?&quot; Lancelot asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No old friend. Though your old master is gone, there is the matter of fixing an old mistake of yours.&quot; Merlin said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What I did at Camelot cannot be forgiven.&quot; Lancelot said shaking his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, your mistake with Miro&#39;s wife and child. Ezekiel Kane has come out of hiding and is wreaking havoc on these people&#39;s community.&quot; Merlin finally revealed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kane?! Kane?!&quot; Lancelot repeated as he punched his armored hand into the wall.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you were a real man, instead of a magician Merlin, you would have stopped Kane years ago!&quot; Lancelot shouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Magic cannot be relied upon for every solution. Wasn&#39;t it magic that made me betray my king and go behind his back?! Am I not to blame for the fall of Camelot?!&quot; Lancelot rhetorically asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It wasn&#39;t your...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No. Don&#39;t say that word sorcerer. Whatever happened all those years ago, I take full responsibility for it. As I do for my actions that night when I brought that....slayer into my new lord&#39;s home.&quot; Lancelot said with much regret.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, he&#39;s scaring me.&quot; Little Morgan finally said speaking up to Katie.<br />
<br />
Lancelot looked curiously at the girl for a moment then his eyes went wide only for them to return to normal when he looked over at Katie.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry little one. I&#39;m not scary, I&#39;m just scared of someone. Do you have someone who protects you?&quot; Lancelot asked politely to little Morgan as Morgan nodded back while not going too far from Katie&#39;s side.<br />
<br />
&quot;My mom and mommy, they protect me &#39;cause they love me.&quot; Little Morgan replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, a long time ago, I accidentally got someone hurt.&quot; Lancelot answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morgan, why don&#39;t we go outside a minute and let mister Lance here talk with grandma&#39;s friends.&quot; Katie suggested as she nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bye Mister Lance.&quot; Little Morgan said politely waving.<br />
<br />
&quot;She is...&quot; Merlin began to say.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know what she is. But she is not who I remember, and that&#39;s good.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;So, what happened between you and this Miro guy anyway?&quot; Miranda finally asked. Everyone including Lancelot looked at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well....we were all thinking it.&quot; Miranda commented to no one.<br />
<br />
&quot;After Camelot, I sought penance for my actions.&quot; Lancelot began.<br />
<br />
&quot;I read you just became a monk.&quot; Kellie Pendragon said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that what the legends say about me? No, that would never suffice me. After Camelot I wandered trying to repent for my sins. Nothing made me feel like I was really repaying for my actions until I came across Vlad Tepes. Yes he was a vampire and though it seemed to go what I had stood for, Vlad had some traits in him that I admired. Eventually his son, Miro, took over and I worked for him just as I had once done for his father. However any of you may feel towards him, know that even in his own twisted way, Miro wanted his own people to live. Yet for all the years we lived and worked together, Miro wanted heirs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m guessing this is where Ezekiel Kane comes in.&quot; Connor guessed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed it is. Miro Tepes found a woman to be his wife and they had his first child together. Though it may be hard to believe, Miro truly loved his first wife and he wanted his child to carry his legacy. Unfortunately, I made the mistake of trusting the wrong person at the wrong time. I was to recruit new members into our fold and back then, Ezekiel Kane was no more than a man off the street then. I brought him into my master&#39;s home where he tried to kill Miro, but when that failed, he settled for his wife and child. I cannot tell you the scream of agony he released that night. It was by a miracle that we fought against him and Kane fled knowing he was in over his head.&quot; Lancelot explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;So....that&#39;s why he locked you up?&quot; Miles asked as Lancelot nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. Though I could not know the assassin he would become, I still let him into my master&#39;s house, he killed my master&#39;s wife and child, and as punishment, he locked me away to where only he and two others in his service knew. Before he locked me away, I looked into his eyes and I saw he had lost the small part of love he had left in him that day after those two were killed. I spent the next few decades locked away for my crime. Now I must bid you all goodbye.&quot; Lancelot said as he stood up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, what?! We summoned you here to help us fight Kane!&quot; Spark said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You seem to have more than enough help here.&quot; Lancelot replied looking around the room as he began to walk away.<br />
<br />
&quot;My daughter and I are trapped in these bodies and can&#39;t rest until he&#39;s dealt with.&quot; Sylvia said pointing herself and Tanya.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are spirits, I presume, you&#39;ll find your way back to the afterlife soon.&quot; Lancelot said stopping a moment to look at the two of them before continuing.<br />
<br />
&quot;He shot my dad, he&#39;s still recovering in the hospital.&quot; Nat said.<br />
<br />
&quot;If he&#39;s recovering, he will be better. It does not concern me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He threatened all of us and our families.&quot; Connor said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That is what he does.&quot; Lancelot replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well....what about.....what about....MIRO&#39;S GRANDCHILDREN?!&quot; Nat shouted as Lancelot suddenly stopped at the door and turned to look at Nat as she looked like she was embarrassed by what she had just said.</p>
