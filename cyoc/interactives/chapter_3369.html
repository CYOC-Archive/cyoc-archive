<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You decide that you should follow the advice that the voice in your head gave you. You pant contentedly as you think of how much fun it will be when your friend will join you and how much fun it will be to have a dog buddy to play with. Tom sits on his knees in front of and looks at you. “Do you have any idea what we should do? It looks like it would be quite difficult to use the medallion on her, because you probably have to get it around her neck… and that will be almost impossible” He sighs and looks down at the ground. He looks so unhappy and you can’t understand why. But you hope he will be happy again when he too becomes a dog. You lower your upper body and let the medallion slide of your neck and with a quiet thud it hits the ground and you quickly pick it up with your mouth. Tom notices your activities and look up “What are you doing?” he asks. But you ignore him as you walk around him with the medallion hanging out of your mouth. When you are behind him, Tom tries to look back to see what you are doing. But before he can react you swing the medallion over his head and then pull it down around his neck. 
<br />

<br />
As the medallion has found its place around Tom’s neck you sit down and watch him and waits. Tom first looks down on the medallion and then he turns around and looks at you in horror as you pant happily with your tongue out. “What have you done?!” He shouts at you and reaches his hand for the medallion.  It looks like he’s going to take it of, but just as he is about to grab it he begins to scratch himself on his chest instead. “Oh, my god it itches! I’m going to be a WOOF, WOOF!” His human voice is suddenly replaced by dog barks. His body begins to shift and change. As Tom continues to scratch his body he begins to grow white fur on his arms, hands and chest. You can also begin to gain mass and become more muscular. As a tail begins to emerge from his tailbone Tom makes an awkwardly attempt to get up and succeeds. He has a hard time standing as he can no longer keep his back straight. He hunches forward and takes a couple of steps before he falls forward onto his hands and knees. As he sprouts more fur and gain more mass, his clothes begins to looks really uncomfortable and tight. You immediately take that as a signal that it’s time to help out of those clothes. As you walk up to him and begin to pull of his shoes. Tom seems to understand what you are trying to do and lifts his leg so his shoes and socks slide of easier. When his sock slides of it reveal a foot that is totally cowered by white fur and the toes have begun their transformation into dog paws. Tom’s big toe is already gone and his other toes have already grown claws. When you are done with his shoes you begin working on his pants. When you are about to pull of his pants with your mouth you can see that Tom is looking back at you. His nose has become that of a dog and his tongue hangs out of his mouth as he pants heavily. White fur have begun to grow on the area around his mouth and between his eyes and up on his forehead, and black fur covers the area around his eyes and brown fur grows on his newly formed hanging dog ears and the rest of his head. You are happy that your friend has come so long on his way of becoming a dog and your friend looks happy too. 
<br />

<br />
With a few tugs you realize that his pants are too tight and that you won’t be able to get them of by pulling them of. So you begin to tear the soon to be dog’s pants apart and while you’re at it you tear his underwear apart as well. When you do that his tail finishes its growth and now Tom has a light brown tail with a white tip on the end. His whole body seem to be cowered by fur. The fur on his legs and underbelly and parts of his side is white and the fur on his back and sides have the same light brown colour as his tail. His face begins to bulge outwards as he grows a short white furred canine muzzle. At the same time his hands and feet becomes the front and back paws of a dog. During the time Tom gets a muzzle his lips turn black and the lips on the sides of his muzzle begins to hang down and makes his gums on his lower jaw partially visible. Tom is no longer a little boy, now he is a young male Saint Bernard. He looks at you with his happy dog eyes and looks really grateful. But then he notices that he still has his t-shirt on and tries to get it of. You notice his problem and begin to rip the t-shirt with your teeth. It tears apart easily and soon falls to the ground. Tom barks a happy bark as if he whanted to thank you and walks up to you wondering what to do next.
<br />

<br />
Now both you and Tom can hear your mistress voice again. Good, now your friend truly knows what it means to be a dog. Now when you are both such very good dogs, return to me and you will be greatly rewarded. Come to your mistress!</p>
