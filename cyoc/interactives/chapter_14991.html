<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Megan clicked on Will's character on the screen, as he walked toward the back yard, she had plenty of time to figure out the perfect transformation for her boyfriend. The computer read off Will's basic information. &quot;Name: Bower, William H.; Gender: Male, Age: 25, Height: 5'11&quot;, Weight: 175 lbs, Species: Human.&quot; As she looked through the different types of transformations one of the options was an animal transformation. <br />
<br />
A slight smirk crossed Megan's face. &quot;It might be nice to see Will as the family pet for a few days.&quot; Megan wasn't evil or anything, but the thought of Will being helpless was exciting, besides she'd transform him back in a few days and tell him all about the Chronivac, and all would be all right. Punching in a few keys, she went through the different breeds and decided to pick a German Shepherd, it was Will's favorite animal, so why not. After a few more minutes the computer read off the new transformation stats. &quot;Name: Winston, Gender: Male, Age: 3 1/2, Species: Canine (German Shepherd).&quot; <br />
<br />
Megan selected a few special options, she set his memories to full, but his instinct was set at 50% of normal, so he couldn't resist doing simple things, but still having self-control in most aspects. She definitely wanted him to be aware of his transformation, it wouldn't be as fun if he wasn't. Megan also made it so that all of Will's personal items would disappear, to be replaced with Winston's things. She was going to be his master for the next few days, and the only one other than Will to be aware of what happened. One more thing she added for herself that she would spring on the new Will later on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Beginning Transformation, full effect in 4.8 minutes. Reality Shift engaging, please standby.&quot; The Chronivac automatically gave the immediate user full awareness of the changes, it was a fail-safe designed into the program's construct.<br />
<br />
Will was standing in the backyard, enjoying the fresh air, a smile across his face, he hadn't felt that good in a while. That's when he felt a slight shudder flow through his entire body, it was like nothing he'd ever felt before. &quot;What the hell was that?&quot; There was a slight itching sensation that crossed his entire body, starting from his stomach, he began to scratch himself everywhere. &quot;Must be something in the air.&quot; Pulling up his shirt, he saw that the hair on his stomach was becoming thicker by the second.<br />
<br />
Backing up against the wall, Will couldn't figure out what was happening, but it definitely wasn't about to stop. Taking off his shirt he realized that his entire chest and arm area had been covered with a coat of fur, it was familiar to him. What he hadn't noticed was that when he threw his shirt to the ground, it had disappeared like it had never existed. The remainder of his clothes were soon to follow, fading away into nothingness, he stood there stark naked, however getting an excellent view at the completion of his transformation.<br />
<br />
Will then noticed that his hand were changing rapidly, his fingernails had become shorter and black and his hands had developed some sort of pad on the palms of his hands. As his hands were completing their transformation he looked into a reflective window, seeing his face starting to push out into a muzzle right before his eyes. The ears on the side of his head started moving up toward the top of his head, his nose slowly became black and wet, like that of a common dog. All the while the fur on his body filled out to a nice even coat.<br />
<br />
Will couldn't believe what was happening, transforming into man's best friend right as he watched on. His feet started the same transformation, becoming much shorter and harder to balance on, as well as his shifting legs, causing him to fall onto his hands (now paws), but it became easier for him, his legs shifted in favor of walking on all fours, which came naturally for him to just stand there as such.<br />
<br />
There was no one Will could call, who'd believe a half man, half dog, then again, who wouldn't? He felt an odd sensation at the end of his spine, like something was pushing it's way through, he turned his head, which made most of his body shift, to look at his now fur covered tail, this entire situation was making him go nuts, he had no idea what he should do next, all he could do was watch it all change in front of him.<br />
<br />
Looking in between his hind legs, Will saw his human genitals start to transform before his eyes, that sent more shivers down his spine than anything else. His penis became slightly smaller, becoming completely red and cylinder shaped, a sheath covered it, completing it's transformation. The finality was that his muzzle pushed itself out completely, fangs filling his mouth. His size as oppose to length and basic mass, shrunk a good deal, stretching his neck in a classic dog format, he was now completely a dog. He let out a slight whine in dislike.<br />
<br />
Will yelled out for anyone to come and help him, but all that came out was a disgruntled woof type noise. His tail suddenly shifted it's position to between his legs, he wasn't sure what to do now. That was when he noticed some more changes, the backyard shifted, there was a dog house in the distance and a few chew toys spread across the yard. A red collar had appeared on his neck and throughout the house, all of Will's belongings disappeared, his clothes, even his favorite cereal had vanished.<br />
<br />
Megan heard Will (now Winston) barking from the backyard, she headed out back there. Biting her lip, she couldn't hold back the smile that crossed from her face, but by now Will's instincts should have kicked in and he'd only be happy to see his master and listen to every word she said with perfect understanding. Opening the patio door, she walked out, patting her thighs as she saw Winston. &quot;Come here Winston, Mommy's home.&quot;<br />
<br />
Will instinctively started wagging his tail in excitement, rushing toward Megan with joy, he thought it was because she could help him get back to normal, but it was really the happiness of seeing his master back. He knocked her down lightly, licking her face without end.</p>
