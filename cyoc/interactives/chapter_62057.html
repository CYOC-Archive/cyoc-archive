<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A teenage boy named Scott was walking down the sidewalk to his girlfriend Nikki's house. The wind was kind of chilly, and blew some of his black hair into his face. He stuck his hands into his jacket pocket and blew at his hair in annoyance. He stopped dead still and his mouth dropped open when he reached the house and saw a five and a half foot tall chicken running around in the yard.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Jessica began to sweat as the computer hooked up to the Chronivac displayed the message &quot;COW selected: Target: Jessica-- Y/N?&quot; Jessica's eyes widened and she quickly tapped the N key. The computer displayed the following message: &quot;Alternate targets in range: Nikki; Human Male-- Select Target--&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Human male?!&quot; Jessica practically yelled, frustrated. Unfortunately, the computer took this as an affirmative confirmation and sent out the Chronivac's electronic scan. It displayed the following message: &quot;Human Male Target Selected-- Transformation Commencing--.&quot; Jessica's eyes widened and she clamped her hands over her mouth. She couldn't believe how this day was turning out for her.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Ever fit and trim, Scott easily sprinted past his girlfriend (although he had no idea who it was) and was halfway up the walk and to the door when he felt an electronic tingle. It made his hair stand on end for a few seconds. The sensation caused him to stop running, and he felt suddenly sweaty. A pressure was beginning to build in his pants, between his legs. Blushing a bit, Scott looked down at his crotch but was surprised to see, and feel, a round, soft mass growing there. It began to strain at his pants, growing larger and larger. The pressure became so great that he was unable to undo his pants button.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have to get these pants off!&quot; Scott thought, worried. The Chronivac sensed his discomfort, and interpreted it accordingly. In a flash of energy, all of Scott's clothes disappeared, leaving him naked on the front lawn. Not knowing what else to do, Scott quickly put his hands in front of his... udder. The Chronivac had transformed his genitals into a smooth pink udder with four teats coming off of it. It grew until it was about a foot in diameter. Scott stood awkwardly on the lawn.<br />
<br />
Nikki the Chicken was beginning to stare.<br />
<br />
Scott's feet were the next to change. They grew a bit longer, and his toenails turned black and thickened until they had taken over his toes. The balls of his feet tilted up at a forty five degree angle, transforming the front of his feet into hooves. The proportions between his leg joints changed a bit, and his kneecaps spun themselves around, leaving him with a pair of cow legs to match his udder.<br />
<br />
Scott started shivering from the autumn cold. In response, the Chronivac supplied him with a thin white fuzz that grew out from every inch of his body, giving him back some cover against the cold. The fuzz ran up and down his legs, butt, chest, back, arms and neck, all the way up to his face and forehead. It became thicker and grew to be about an eighth of an inch thick. The teats of his udder lengthened and thickened a bit.<br />
<br />
Nikki had lost interest and was beginning to build a nest out of leaves and dried grass. She wanted to go help her boyfriend, but was unable to do so.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoooooo is doing this to me? mmmMMOOOOOOOOOO!&quot; Scott bellowed. He went to cover his mouth, embarrassed, but his arms had elongated about five inches and he missed his target, smacking himself in the face with a skinny cow foreleg. This threw him off balance and Scott wavered in his quest to stay upright. His chest soon became bulkier, though, and Scott was forced to abandon his human stance in favor of a quadrupedal one.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hnnnn!&quot; Scott moaned through gritted teeth as his chest became wider and more massive. &quot;Hnnnn! Hnnnn! Hnnnn!&quot; Scott's chest heaved and his udder swayed in the wind, his legs and arms spread out for balance. His abdomen and buttocks were doubling in size. Forced to stare face down at his hands, Scott had an excellent view of them as his fingernails turned as black as his toenails and fused together, just as his feet had done. He was forced to acknowledge the fact that he did not have arms anymore, just four legs like any other animal. He was forced to acknowledge the fact that he was not much of a human person anymore. He was becoming a big cow; not even a bull! He felt humiliated, but grateful that there was no one else outside to watch his slow, arduous transformation.<br />
<br />
Like Nikki before him, Scott's human mind was being taken over by an animal's instinct to eat. His skull became thicker and more bony as his soft black hair fell out and blew across the lawn. (Nikki was running after it, gathering it in her beak to help build up her nest.) Scott's fuzzy ears pointed and grew out to become his new cow ears. His neck thickened and elongated a bit, to facilitate movement to match his (still smaller than average) new cow body. A tail erupted from above his butt, and black spots appeared in various places on his new hide.<br />
<br />
Scott's human mind and animal instincts both told him he was hungry. Although he rationally knew that he wanted to eat a pizza, his cow thoughts stared intently at the grass. His human mind raged against the idea of eating it, but he could not control his body anymore.<br />
<br />
As Nikki gathered his hair, and as Jessica stared in amazement from the window in the house, Scott stuck his white, fuzzy, still-human face into the lawn and began to chew on the grass.</p>
