<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Even by the usual standard for new huskies, Goldie's sudden eagerness to please was clearly shocking to everyone, most especially Zack, but <br />
she could tell they still didn't really trust her. It was her 4th day as a husky now, but she still hadn't been transfered over to the traditional <br />
training program, and even the other new recruits were cutting conversations short anytime they saw her coming. The sense of rejection was <br />
driving her further and further into humility and causing her to look for new ways to somehow prove herself. At first, her motivation had been <br />
as selfish as they come, just trying to keep herself from once again being forced to leave the park. The in-built loyalty and pack mentality of a <br />
husky though had, over time, managed to correct a major character flaw she had always suffered from, and provided her for the first time in <br />
her life a proper sense of empathy. Every night since arriving, she had been losing sleep over how everyone must think of her. The opponents <br />
she'd verbally abused in all those games, her formal employer she'd constantly disappointed, all the people whose dinner she interrupted trying <br />
to push sales on them... and of course, coming here as a wolf had only made everything worse. All those people she'd terrorized... especially <br />
that little bunny girl she'd almost scared to death. That's exactly the sort of person she was here to protect now, why all the other huskies still <br />
clearly hated her even if they never said it, and in hindsight they had every right to. Several times she'd almost asked if she was still in the park <br />
somewhere, so she could find her and apologize, but she new she could never do that. The girl had looked catatonic the last time she saw her, <br />
and odds were she wouldn't let anything remotely canine close to her again. She'd probably fly into a panic if she learned the pack had <br />
accepted such a terrible person as her on top of that. Plus there was a chance that bringing the topic up would just reopen the wound for <br />
everyone else, and suddenly they'd remember what a monster she was and send her away again. She just needed to find another way to <br />
overcome the guilt.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's more than enough pushups Goldie,&quot; said Zack. &quot;Stop and go have a drink, you're panting so much you're going to run out of saliva.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sir, yes, sir!&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Chad had been jogging down the length of the stream, still trying to make sure he was in top fighting form, but also hoping he'd get an <br />
opportunity like this. There was a deer woman, trying to give a bath to her children, and so far as he knew, there was only one doe in the park <br />
with that many little brats. &quot;Well! What do we have here? If it isn't the top prize!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me?&quot; asked Leticia, gathering up her children to get away from this creep as soon as possible.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're that 'Lord Jeremy's' girl, right? The one he won the last time you all had a proper bit of sparring around here to see who was top stag? <br />
You still the choicest piece around here, or is there a younger model now?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lateshia ignored him, hurrying along towards home and wondering why this had to happen the day she sent off the other does who offered to <br />
help with the kids for some nice alone time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't get me wrong,&quot; said Chad, &quot;the kids are a turnoff, but you're still rockin' it. Anyway, if seeing a good fight is what gets you going, we're <br />
all gonna be set up for one in that big clearing downstream. Just 3 more days, and you can find yourself a way better stud-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey meathead!&quot; Zack shouted as he came across the scene with Goldie in tow. &quot;Clearly she isn't interested, and even if she was, how in the <br />
world were you raised that you think that's an appropriate way to talk to anyone in front of their children!&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad put his hands up backing away. &quot;Hey man, I'm sorry. You're right, that was over the line. Just trying to pay the lady a compliment, thought <br />
she'd like to see a show. Sometimes the ol' gums flap too much when a 10 walks by. You must know what I'm talking about there. I mean, if I <br />
were into dogs...&quot;<br />
<br />
Zack tensed up, Goldie looked over, clearly primed to spring into action the moment he said a word, but it was clear from his face what he was <br />
thinking. It just had to be Chad. The one Stag he couldn't toss out of the park without starting a riot, and probably taking some serious heat <br />
from management too. &quot;Look, I don't care how well connected you are, it does not give you the right to harass a married woman in front of her <br />
children... or anyone else for that matter. You are going to march yourself back to your little camp, with your little cronies, and you are going <br />
to stay there until you have finished your creepy little initiation ritual or whatever it is you're here for, and then you are going to leave. And <br />
until you leave, we are going to keep someone watching you, 24/7, and the next time ANY of you step out of line and harass another guest like <br />
this, we are going to toss every single one of you out of here, regardless of any sort of special deals you've cut for yourselves. Am I being <br />
clear?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad may have had some serious ego problems, but he knew when to pick his battles. &quot;Crystal. Again, I didn't really mean anything by it. We'll <br />
keep to ourselves out there. I'll just go right ahead and let everyone else now there'll be plenty of ladies for us to choose from after we crown a <br />
winner either way.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Naturally, Goldie offered to keep watch on Chad until a permanent rotation of huskies could be posted specifically to keep the stags corralled <br />
to one area. There'd even been some talk of fencing them in, but management had shot down the idea, and specifically disallowed any further <br />
action to be taking against them than the proposed segregation measures.<br />
<br />
The worst part of the situation, thought Goldie, was how closely it followed her own. She recognized the sort of tactic Chad was employing all <br />
too well. Find a nice vulnerable victim, put just enough menace in your tone to scare them without really making any sort of threat, and see <br />
how strong a reaction it produces. Her impression was that he didn't even have any real interest in Leticia. He was probably just trying to <br />
escalate things with the local deer in general, banding them together to defend her honor. The fact she could so easily follow the logic made <br />
her feel another strong pang of guilt.<br />
<br />
She couldn't help think about that offhand comment he had made either, implying she had some kind of romantic involvement with Zack. <br />
Obviously that would never happen. She wasn't really female, and every husky knew it, just like they knew everything else about her. They'd <br />
compliment her appearance now and then, but that was just to rub the way she'd tried to hide in her face. Odd that Chad was apparently in on <br />
the joke. Were they all just everyone in the park who she used to be?<br />
<br />
It was the twins Zack was actually involved with. Goldie always felt a little jealous of them for that. Zack was always happy to see them, trusted <br />
them completely, it was the same with Harry and Katie. To a lesser extent all the other female huskies seemed to be treated with love and <br />
approval but her. She supposed it really came down to seniority. Apparently, the previous pack leader was something of a man hater. There was <br />
a point when Harry and Zach were the only ones on the team thanks to her policies, and only because they were so competent. It was only <br />
natural for her to particularly seek out their approval in particular, since they'd risen to the top, and gave her all her orders. Otherwise, she was <br />
fairly sure all the males had joined up the same time she had. She wanted them to like her so she could make some kind of fresh start. That <br />
was the reason, she told herself, she didn't seem to care so much about winning the approval of the other girls. They all sort  of fell in the <br />
middle. Too senior to forget how she used to be, but not in any sort of position where winning them over would convince anyone else she'd <br />
really changed. That and the males were all a bit more powerfully built. She'd used to have a body like them, so it was only natural that she'd <br />
try and take in all the details when she had a close look at one of them. It was just something like envy, or pining for what she'd lost. She'd <br />
been teased for that too once or twice, when she'd been caught staring. Just more humiliation as obviously there was no way she'd suddenly be <br />
attracted to men.<br />
<br />
Goldie turned her mind to what else she could do to prove herself. So far, she'd at least done her part by naming everyone she'd seen in the <br />
park that followed her old patterns. None had quite gotten the treatment she had from the huskies over it, but then most of them didn't really <br />
act in such a predatory fashion as she had as the 'Lone Wolf' either. She was running out of people to turn in though, and worried that when <br />
she could no longer act as an informant, she'd be thrown out. The only one she hadn't turned traitor on so far was Max, but there was <br />
something... off about Max. Max never really bragged about scaring anyone like she did when they met up now and then, but clearly seemed to <br />
know what it felt like to stalk people and run them down. Apparently, nobody had made any complaints to the huskies about being frightened <br />
or harassed by any wolverines, but clearly Max had some experience bringing that sort of real fear out of people, she knew it.<br />
<br />
The next morning, after she caught her breath from her exercises but before setting out on patrol, she looked up at Zack and asked, just to <br />
rule out one of the darker possibilities, &quot;There haven't ever been any cases where any guests just went missing, have there?&quot;</p>
