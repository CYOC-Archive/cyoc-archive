<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Despite the fact that it was late summer and there was still a global pandemic going on, there was romance starting to bloom for Animalians. Some of it was only beginning to bud, like Huoxing who was going on a blind date with the older brother of one of the rescued girls. Some of it was only starting to bloom, like with Codey and Michiko. And some wasn&#39;t fully realized yet, like the UST between Mercy and Zack. But with a few others, love was coming into full bloom.<br />
<br />
Nelly had wanted to play hard to get with Reggie. It was mostly out of pride and a determination to prove that she was better than her brother, who fell head over hooves in at first sight, well, first insult. And yet Reggie had been able to win her over with his determination to keep up with her. And surprisingly, she found his humbleness to be very endearing. She had heard of the saying &#39;opposites attract&#39;, but didn&#39;t think that was a real thing until she got to know Reggie.<br />
<br />
There was another reason she was giving in to her emotions. She could feel her heat cycle starting. She was intending to one-up Meryl by getting pregnant first. The scientists at Horizon Lab confirmed she and her brother were now fertile after being uplifted. And that liger lady had a litter of cubs. And it would prove she&#39;s the superior mule if she could get knocked up first.<br />
<br />
Nelly had dropped more than enough hints for Reggie that she was ready to take it to the next level. He was a sweet guy, but he seemed a little slow on the uptake. So she decided to drop her heaviest hint yet. She was wearing her most revealing sports bra, which was little more than a bikini top as well as a pair of bootie shorts that revealed a lot of her ass. She wondered about putting on some perfume, but that seemed like too much. Presently, she heard a knock on her door. She opened it to find Reggie, in a sleeveless shirt and gym shorts. &quot;Hey there,&quot; she said in a breathy voice, leaning against the doorway and letting her breasts come level to his head, &quot;Are you ready for a workout? Because I can give you an extra-hard workout.&quot;<br />
<br />
Reggie looked both bemused and unamused. He rolled his eyes and said, &quot;Nelly, can we be frank?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;About what?&quot; asked Nelly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your blatant attempts at seducing me,&quot; said Reggie flatly.<br />
<br />
Nelly frowned and said, &quot;You&#39;re not supposed to call direct attention to it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Seriously, we need to talk,&quot; said Reggie, ducking around her and into the apartment, &quot;You don&#39;t need to keep acting like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nelly winced and asked, &quot;Are you breaking up with me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I&#39;m not. In fact, I&#39;m eager to convert,&quot; said Reggie.<br />
<br />
Nelly smiled and started lifting up her sports bra, &quot;Then I guess we should drop the foreplay-&quot;<br />
<br />
Reggie held up a hand and said, &quot;First, there&#39;s something we need to address.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nelly paused and asked, &quot;What&#39;s that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This silly one-sided competition you have with your brother and his mate,&quot; said Reggie.<br />
<br />
Nelly gave him an annoyed look and asked, &quot;How long have you been talking with him?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The day you &#39;accidentally&#39; let me collide with your chest,&quot; said Reggie, referring to how Nelly had suddenly stopped during their jog, turned around, and caused Reggie to smack his face into her cleavage. That was a week ago.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what were you telling my brother?&quot; asked Nelly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was mostly asking Olly&#39;s permission to get serious with you. And he and Meryl noticed that you were showing jealousy before they moved to Wisconsin,&quot; said Reggie, &quot;We didn&#39;t need to have Interpol training to figure out what was going on in your head.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nelly&#39;s ears lowered in irritation, &quot;I&#39;m that predictable, am I?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That being said, I&#39;m not against converting with you, I just had a few things to take care of first,&quot; said Reggie, &quot;For one thing, I needed to take care of clothes since I&#39;m going to outgrow everything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Olly lent you some of his?&quot; asked Nelly.<br />
<br />
&quot;He told me where he got his own clothes. He apparently lent enough to his nephew,&quot; said Reggie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah,&quot; said Nelly. She sorta forgot she was technically part of the extended Bowman family, which seems to keep growing and changing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Also, I have a few conditions about being your mate,&quot; said Reggie, &quot;One, I&#39;m not wanting to have foals, not before we&#39;re married at least.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that all?&quot; asked Nelly dryly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Two, even after we&#39;re married, we shouldn&#39;t have to be in a rush to have kids,&quot; said Reggie, &quot;I mean Meryl&#39;s going to be holding back so you shouldn&#39;t feel so competitive.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She is?&quot; asked Nelly in surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;Having a son means more to her brother than it does for her,&quot; said Reggie, &quot;She&#39;s going to wait until her sister-in-law is pregnant before she tries to conceive.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, if she&#39;s that eager for me to go first...&quot; said Nelly coquettishly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Her other sister-in-law and you know it,&quot; said Reggie flatly.<br />
<br />
Nelly snorted before saying, &quot;Fine... Is that all?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty much,&quot; said Reggie, &quot;So if you want to get started...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now?&quot; asked Nelly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, if you have something special planned...&quot; said Reggie.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, now&#39;s good,&quot; said Nelly as she finally pulled up her sports bra, letting her mule melons bounce out. She cupped them and asked, &quot;How do they look?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re...perkier than I expected,&quot; said Reggie.<br />
<br />
&quot;From what I hear, Animalian muscles mean that breasts don&#39;t sag as much as they would for humans,&quot; said Nelly, &quot;In fact, we could probably do without bras except they keep bouncing with every step.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can believe that,&quot; said Reggie.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, are you just going to stand there?&quot; asked Nelly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, I think I&#39;d like to lie down,&quot; said Reggie.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know where you can lie,&quot; said Nelly.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Nelly moaned as she felt Reggie&#39;s lips on her nipple and his cock between her lower lips. Reggie was a pretty decent size, for a human. It was still small for her equine snatch, but he was filling out nicely. A coat of light brown hair was thickening over Reggie&#39;s body as he bulked up. Becoming a mix of Ardennes and mammoth donkey meant that Reggie was putting on a lot of mass. Muscles that had been lightly defined were now becoming carved stone, sandstone in particular due to his new fur. It also meant some feathering was appearing on both his lower arms and his legs, which had become longer as the toes became hooves. Reggie needed to roll over a little as his new tail grew out, becoming long and full like a stallion&#39;s.<br />
<br />
Nelly gasped as Reggie&#39;s cock suddenly made a spurt in growth. It felt like it was finally starting to fill out the stallion-sized condom he put on. &quot;You&#39;re feeling like a jack-of-all-trades now,&quot; said Nelly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Reggie, though his voice sounded very nasal as his mouth was still in the process of growing into a muzzle, which made his nose heavily distorted. Nelly covered her mouth to cover her laughing. &quot;It&#39;sh not that funny,&quot; said Reggie, lisping a little as his teeth became more accustomed to a mule&#39;s mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I think I know why most people don&#39;t talk while they&#39;re converting,&quot; said Nelly. To show she didn&#39;t mean offense, she leaned down to kiss him. She could feel him pushing back as his muzzle came out more. She playfully batted at his longer ears as she started to thrust with more earnest. Part of her hoped the condom would tear. Not just because she&#39;d have an extra-large jack, but it could give a head&#39;s start in having her foal. It was definitely filling her up more as he thrust into her. Both of them were breathing hard before they both let out loud braying whinnies as they finally hit their peaks.<br />
<br />
Nelly panted and said, &quot;Well, looks like I&#39;ll be a mother first after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Afraid not,&quot; said Reggie as he pulled out. The condom held, but it was quite full. Not surprising considering the huge nuts he now had.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, well at least I know your cannon isn&#39;t just for show,&quot; said Nelly.<br />
<br />
Reggie got up to dispose of the condom, though he staggered on his new hooves. When he came back, he said, &quot;Well, I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ve got enough of these to keep us going.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, do we just go unprotected and take a risk?&quot; asked Nelly in a teasing tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can wait until you get some pills,&quot; said Reggie, &quot;Also, I&#39;ll have to do some fittings.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For your new wardrobe?&quot; asked Nelly, &quot;You look about the same size as my brother.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;ll also want to know size ring would fit on your finger,&quot; said Reggie.<br />
<br />
Nelly gave him a warm smile and said, &quot;You&#39;re going to make me a very happy mare.&quot;</p>
