<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Michael sat on a bench against one wall of the workshop. Eric still lay on the table, some pillows tucked under him for comfort while four reindeer argued nearby, one of them his nose glowing more and more red as he got more visibly agitated.<br />
<br />
Even seeing Rudolph up close couldn&#39;t bring him out of his stupor. Of course he had asked Tag what he meant by Eric being his brother. Michael had just assumed he meant bro and didn&#39;t know the proper English slang, but as he explained he felt like he got hit between the eyes with a hammer.<br />
<br />
All those years of &#39;Maybe I&#39;ll spend next Christmas with him&#39; or &#39;take him on a trip for his next birthday&#39; and never following through had finally caught up to him. He paid child support, he was even going to pay for Eric&#39;s college, but he was beginning to learn that hadn&#39;t been enough. He just thought Eric was a little bitter not being able to spend time with him, but now he realized he probably didn&#39;t want to, and the guilt was crushing. He had lost him. His eyes drifted to Bix, the man he had lost his son to. And he couldn&#39;t be mad at anyone but himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;He needs to be at home.&quot; One of the younger reindeer was saying. Clyde he thought it was. He was beginning to be able to tell them apart by their markings and size.<br />
<br />
&quot;You live alone. What is he supposed to so while you work?&quot; That was Bix. &quot;At my place, Tag and I can take turns.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Out of the question.&quot; Rudy chimed in, his nose flashing for a moment. &quot;I need all three of you up and active. Four members of team three are down with fox flu, and with me having to pull one up to fill Eric&#39;s spot till he&#39;s better team three is below half power. I can&#39;t meld two teams into one, it&#39;ll be a disaster.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s really quite an amusing disease in most cases.&quot; Came a sonorous but gruff voice beside him. He hadn&#39;t noticed Otso walking up to sit next to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is?&quot; Michael asked, grateful for some distraction.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fox flu.&quot; Michael&#39;s eyes slid to where Lars and Tom stood in hushed conversation in another corner of the workshop. &quot;Oh no, it&#39;s not named for them, it&#39;s for the fox lights.&quot; The doctor pointed skywards. &quot;Like most flus it comes with a fever, muscle soreness, the amusing part is the sneezing. You see, it can only infect creatures with magic, makes you shoot light out your nose when you sneeze. Looks like a mini-aurora.&quot;<br />
<br />
Michael arches an eyebrow as he looked at Otso. &quot;Honest. The sneeze is a rapid expulsion of magical energy. The problem is sneezing shuts off your magic for a bit. Not a problem for most of us, but when your main magic is flying.&quot; He nods to the reindeer. &quot;Needless to say they&#39;re grounded until we&#39;re sure its out of their system.&quot;<br />
<br />
No offense, Otso. Thanks for trying to distract me, but my mind is in knots. I just feel like I&#39;m in this rut where I can&#39;t do anything right.&quot; He sighed and looked over where Eric slept. Poor kid was probably going to be heartbroken over that antler.<br />
<br />
&quot;In a rut? Oh. Like a ditch. Be careful, that word has a drastically different meaning up here.&quot; Otso arched a brow, a faint smile playing across his muzzle, which actually did pull a laugh out of Michael. A small faint thing, but a laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel helpless. Those four can&#39;t agree on who gets to look after him while he recoups. Tom and Lars are too busy with the resort, and Tess has, well you know what it&#39;s like to get time off working in a hospital.&quot; He leaned back in the bench and looked over to the wolf.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think there&#39;s a pretty obvious solution.&quot; Otso said airly.<br />
<br />
&quot;He hates me.&quot; Michael retorted.<br />
<br />
&quot;He doesn&#39;t have to like you for you to look after him. He just needs you.&quot; Otso nudged him in the side and nodded towards the bickering reindeer.<br />
<br />
He sighed and stood up. At six foot two he wasn&#39;t used to having to look up at many people, but even Clyde, the shortest of the group topped him by a few inches as he approached. The antlers did not help. He cleared his throat and four sets of reindeer eyes turned and stared at him. &quot;I have some leave saved up at work. I can call them and tell them I&#39;ll be away longer than planned. I&#39;ll look after him.&quot;<br />
<br />
The four exchanged unreadable looks, though something seemed to pass between them. &quot;I have two spare rooms.&quot; Bix said as if that settled it. Clyde looked grumpy but nodded his agreement. Rudy&#39;s nose finally stopped doing an imitation of a stop light.<br />
<br />
--------------<br />
<br />
Bix&#39;s home was cozier than Michael would have expected. It had a rustic cabin in the woods feel, but also had a warm feeling to it that felt like a home. Not like Michael&#39;s apartment which was basically a place to live. This home spoke of family. It was also built for reindeer, which made him feel a bit on the small side. The tall doors and ceilings must be a requirement with antlers.<br />
<br />
They had found a wheelchair to get him here, and one of Bix&#39;s spare rooms was luckily ground floor. Tag moved him from the chair to the bed, being surprisingly gentle with him.<br />
<br />
&quot;How far is the bathroom?&quot; Otso asked, looking about.<br />
<br />
&quot;Out and to the left, just a few feet.&quot; Bix said, gesturing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perfect. Now, everyone out while I instruct my new nursing assistant.&quot; Otso ushered the three out the door with shooing motions then shut it with a sigh. &quot;Reindeer, try to separate one from the rest of the herd and they circle in closer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It won&#39;t be as terrible as it seems. I just want him on bedrest until I&#39;m sure everything is knitted up properly. Keep him in the bed. He can get up to go to the bathroom and for a short walk every few hours, short and slow to make sure his legs don&#39;t cramp up. Otherwise, bring him food and water as needed. I&#39;ll tell Rudy to have Clara send you some simple reindeer recipes. Can you cook?&quot; Having been living alone the last decade he had learned, so he nodded. &quot;Excellent. No meat, limited dairy. Some fish is okay. Lots of greens, especially reindeer moss, he&#39;ll eat it happily.&quot;<br />
<br />
Michael bobbed his head at the orders, looking over at Eric. It was hard to see his son in that shape, but his every instinct told him he was. &quot;Thanks, doctor. For taking care of him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you, Otso is fine.&quot; The wolf said with a genuine smile. &quot;I&#39;ll be by to check on him tomorrow. This is a good thing you&#39;re doing for him.&quot; Otso places a paw on his shoulder, squeezing gently and Michael found him putting his hand on that paw for just a moment.<br />
<br />
Eric made a sound and stirred. &quot;Ah, I&#39;ll let you two have a moment. I&#39;ll keep the others distracted by passing on my instructions.&quot; Otso headed out of the room and he could hear him starting up in the living room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eric?&quot; Michael asked as he sat down in the chair by the bed. He reached out and took that hand in his. It was bigger than his own hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where?&quot; Eric mumbled groggily as he looked around, then fixed his gaze on Michael. &quot;Dad.&quot; He muttered, he hadn&#39;t called him that in years. &quot;I&#39;ve been having the weirdest dream. I was up north, and there was this cute reindeer, but he was a cute guy, too, and we&#39;re gonna get married. Then this other reindeer became my dad, too. Nice dream.&quot; And then he drifted back off again.<br />
<br />
Michael just sighed and leaned back in the chair. After a while Bix came in carrying another chair and sat himself on the other end of the bed. The two men just sat in silence for a while, both thinking the same thoughts.</p>
