<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>I&#39;m stretching the rules for the Animalia virus, but I think this still works.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">One would think that someone like Steven Blair would have received more attention before now. He certainly had more than enough to draw attention to him. For starters, he is the wealthiest of all Animalian as he is Animalia&#39;s first, and currently only, billionaire. Steven is also a centenarian, which is always a notable thing. Unlike Daniel or Joshua, Steven didn&#39;t see any personal action during World War I. After all, someone had to run the factories that produced the weapons, fuel, vehicles, and other necessary tools. Steven Blair has started there but worked his way up. By the time that the war ended, Steven had started his own enterprise in the steel industry. That was where he made his fortune that had grown through the 20th century and into the 21st.<br />
<br />
Probably the most noticeable thing about Steven Blair was that he was now a fox. And what a fox he was. There seemed to be a rule of thumb that the older a person is before they converted, the more impressive they will be when they&#39;ve double-dosed. Steven certainly seemed to proof supporting that. Steven was both taller and more muscular than the average fox. And he certainly took delight in showing it off. Not only did he participate in the A-BC and the UFC-A, but he made regular appearances at both Claw Coliseum and the Meat Market. Not to mention Steven took advantage of the new tattooing techniques to get tribal designs on both his upper arms, back, and shoulders. On top of all that, he traded in his old limo for a custom-made bike.<br />
<br />
A person like Steven Blair, who was certainly a textbook case of Regressive Hypersexuality Syndrome, should have been a lot more heard of outside of Animalia. Probably the reason he had so unheard of was because his human family was doing all they could to keep his exploits from being spread. Part of this was because they were so embarrassed about such a venerable patriarch who had great-grandchildren in high school, acting like he was going through enough of a midlife crisis for three men. But there was also certainly a lot of resentment in how the old man who had just turned 100 was now in a fit, virile body and was hardly likely to pass on his wealth to his descendants any time soon. It was easy for them to imagine that his vulpine descendants would be the more likely heirs.<br />
<br />
But Steven Blair was becoming more prominent than his family could hush up. That recent broadcast from Animalia Ambassadoria was just a start of how famous he was getting. Steven was getting a little tired of how his old family was trying to repress him. He should have taught them to care more about family than money, particularly his grandchildren. It&#39;s not like he disowned them and left them nothing. They got plenty from when he sold his old mansion so he could build a new one in Animalia. It&#39;s not like he wouldn&#39;t give them money if they actually needed it. The problem with these new generations was they were too greedy and entitled. They think everything would just be handed down to them.<br />
<br />
Well, Steven was going to make people aware of him in a way that should offend their delicate &#39;sensibilities&#39;. Steven had been working on his memoir for years. He had thought he was getting to the end of it as he was nearing the end of his life. But now there were new chapters to write, literally. They were probably going to contrast with his earlier pages, but who cares? He could easily have them published as separate volumes. Steven was currently working on the first new chapter, which of course started with his conversion.<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;It all started on the eve of my 100th birthday. Most of my family was there. I wish they had been there to actually celebrate my birthday. Most of them were just wanting to ask for more money. I barely kept track of who was asking for what and why. Well, I could tell, but I don&#39;t think they&#39;d appreciate it. They weren&#39;t even really planning on staying tomorrow to celebrate my birthday properly, saying they&#39;ve got business elsewhere. But at least their attempts to curry my favor helped me become what I am now.<br />
<br />
&quot;We were having my old favorite for dinner: fox stew. Shocking, isn&#39;t it? Me actually liking fox stew. Well, I used to go fox hunting and developed a taste for fox. It&#39;s not bad if you prepare it right. Of course, you have to realize that at that point animals and people were completely separate beings. I never even heard of the Animalia virus outbreak which was already happening elsewhere. And before you ask, no, the stew itself didn&#39;t change. If it did, the rest of my family would also be foxes. But it did start things in motion. Before I went to bed, I drank a glass of tap water. Then I had my IV drip plugged into my arm and went to sleep, expecting to wake up to a disappointing 100th birthday.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, I only found out later how this chain of events ended up transforming me. Little did I know that the Animalia virus had gotten into the pipes. From what they tell me, the virus doesn&#39;t really affect humans unless it&#39;s already been bonded to animal DNA. And there was still some fox meat digesting in my stomach after I drank that water. Of course, that&#39;s not the ideal way to combine DNA. If the virus was already in the stew or I had drank the water closer to dinnertime, it would started my conversion right away. But the fox meat was already breaking down and the virus formed a weak bond to it. The fox strain was in my body, but it wasn&#39;t strong enough to actually start the transformation. I suppose that made me what you would call a carrier. I suppose it would have passed through my body completely if it hadn&#39;t been exposed to another dose of Animalia virus.<br />
<br />
&quot;What I also didn&#39;t know was that the IV bags that had come from Lyre&#39;s hospital had also been tainted by the virus. Don&#39;t ask me how that happened, I&#39;m just glad it did. Also, there&#39;s a funny thing about the Animalia virus being in that IV drip and it wasn&#39;t just the irony of it. Turns out this virus thrives in the sodium chloride and glucose solution they put in IV bags. Doesn&#39;t really sound like any virus I heard about, but this is science beyond my reckoning. Anyways, the IV drip was pumping virus samples that were hearty and ready to get to work. I don&#39;t think it would have reached my stomach on its own, though what do I know about the relationship between the cardiovascular and digestive systems. But the weaker virus sample was floating around my veins with a vulpine genetic blueprint. The strong sample interacted with that, copied the new sequence, and started rebuilding my body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, I was oblivious to all of this. I was fast asleep while those little miracle makers reshaped my body through the night. Did it affect my dreams? Oh, it certainly did. My dreams definitely took a turn for the saucy side. If I wasn&#39;t in the process of conversion, I&#39;d probably have asked why I was dreaming of vixens in that particular way. But I&#39;m not going to go into detail about that. When morning came, I awoke feeling better than I ever did in my life. A few things soon tipped me off on what&#39;s changed: how my bed felt a lot smaller, that I was in the nude when I distinctly remember wearing nightclothes last night, the feeling of a new limb, and the sight of my new muzzle in front of my face.<br />
<br />
&quot;I arose from my bed and the remains of my ruined nightclothes to soon discover that I was much taller than before and my feet didn&#39;t touch the floor like they used to. I stumbled quite a bit, unused to my new size and legs. Eventually, I managed to stagger to the mirror to behold my reborn self. Imagine my surprise when instead of an old man who looked ready for a coffin, I saw an Apollo-sized fox man looking back at me. If I hadn&#39;t just woke up, I&#39;d thought I was dreaming. But no, there I was, over seven feet tall, Herculean muscles covered in red and white fur. I certainly wasn&#39;t human anymore. For a while, I wondered if I had somehow become some sort of god. But then I learned about the rest of Lyre...&quot;</i><br />
<br />
&quot;Steven, it iz getting late. Will you to bed <i>s&#39;il vous plaît</i>?&quot; Steven looked up from his computer to where Fleur was standing. The French vixen looked particularly enticing in her lingerie, the kind that barely kept her privates covered and can be removed very easily.<br />
<br />
Steven grinned and said, &quot;I think I&#39;ve done enough typing for one night.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good. I &#39;ave been waiting for you to scratch ze itch zat &#39;as been frustrating me,&quot; said Fleur. She turned and waved her tail invitingly, showing off her shapely ass with only a thin strip of material keeping her pussy covered.<br />
<br />
Steven saved his progress, turned off his computer, and followed Fleur. The Frenchwoman had been pretending to be bi all her life, though only her flirting with other women was genuine. Now she was truly becoming bi, Steven had been helping her adjust to her new attraction, as well as all the sex she could have with a man.<br />
<br />
By the time they reached the bed, they were already naked. Steven&#39;s foxhood had already emerged from its sheath, the knot at the base engorged and throbbing. Like the rest of his vulpine body, his cock was large. It would have split a human woman in half, but Fleur&#39;s vixen vagina adapted quite well to it.<br />
<br />
Fleur lied on the bed and spread her legs. &quot;Do not be so rough zis time,&quot; said Fleur, &quot;Last time, you nearly knocked me out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Steven spread her legs further apart into the missionary position, &quot;Then we&#39;ll need to work on your endurance.&quot; But he slid the head of his cocks gently between her lower lips. Fleur moaned with pleasure before giving a gasp as he thrust in proper. Steven thrust himself back and forth, slowly adding more of his shaft deeper into Fleur. Fleur&#39;s moaning was getting louder and it took a bit of self-control to not plunge all the way in. He waits until his knot was touching her before he started putting more effort into it.<br />
<br />
Fleur was yipping like a fox in heat, though she wouldn&#39;t be for a few more months. But that drove Steven to plunge in deeper. In the back of his mind, Steven thought that his human family were right to worry about him passing over their inheritance to his future kits. He wouldn&#39;t straight-out disown them. He&#39;d give them the chance to show they deserve some of his fortune. But most of his brain was focused on his mating impulse. His knot pressed into Fleur more and more before it finally pushed in with a pop. Fleur let out a cry as she clenched hard around the huge knot. Steven was pushed over the edge himself as he emptied a sizeable load into Fleur.<br />
<br />
Considering they were tied together for a while, Steven lifted Fleur off the bed before lying down, letting her rest on top of him. Fleur cuddled on his chest, her large breasts pressing flat against his chiseled muscles. She was soon drifting off to sleep as Steven started to join her. As he closed his eyes, his thoughts were filled with saucy vixens again, though half of them were visibly pregnant.</p>
