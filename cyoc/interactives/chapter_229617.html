<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After registering his motorcycle and testing out the “AI-program”, Quentin is sitting in his living room, the teen lives by himself, having run away from home, he is able to pay all the bills for the apartment and supplies for him and his pet for doing shady businesses, earning handsome amounts of cash.<br />
<br />
Quentin has his Laptop open and is looking through “Andy’s” system, and watching Quinn through the “Android’s” eyes, ‘let’s cause Quinn’s parents to think their son is a eight week old Malinois Shepherd and treat him as such,’ he thinks to himself, ‘then I’ll shrink Quinn down to the size of an 8-week-old pup, tomorrow I’ll go and pick him up and pay his parents for the “puppy”! Haha… and Quinn will be “happy” and “excited” to see me “again”! This reality change better work,’ with that, Quentin sets the reality alteration the way he wants and confirms it. Next he causes Quinn to shrink until he is the same size of an average Malinois pup, without Quinn realizing something is wrong.<br />
<br />
“Being so small is dumb,” he hears Quinn whine, “I can’t wait to grow up into a big and strong Malinois! I can’t wait for master Quentin to pick me up tomorrow! I am so super excited,” the boy says, he even starts to shake his butt violently as if “wagging”, this causes Quentin to laugh out loud.<br />
<br />
“HAHA! He looks so damn stupid but also so damn cute,” he says to himself.<br />
<br />
“Andy” smiles at Quinn, “I’m sure he is just as excited,” he says, ‘good thing Quinn is unaware of the change master Quentin made me do,’ the “Android” thinks to himself.<br />
<br />
Quentin then types a sentence for “Andy” to “say”, “would you like me to come with you? You know, as support and comfort, you’re moving into a new and unknown home”.<br />
<br />
The tiny human nods, “y-yeah, that would be nice of you, Andy,” he says.<br />
<br />
Quentin makes “Andy” lean down and pat his head, “after all,” he then has “Andy” say, “I want master’s puppy to not be afraid and feel right at home!”<br />
<br />
“I must admit… even though I am excited, I’m also a little scared,” Quinn mumbles.<br />
<br />
“It’ll be fine,” “Andy” says, “besides, I’ll be always stay with you, even as a pup, you are still my owner”.<br />
<br />
“I… I just hope master Quentin doesn’t mind,” Quinn says.<br />
<br />
“I don’t think he will,” the “Android” replies.<br />
<br />
“Okay,” Quinn simply says, before rolling into a ball on his bed and falling asleep.<br />
<br />
Seeing Quinn lie down like a dog causes Quentin to laugh, “haha! This will be fun,” he says to himself, he then grins evilly, “this Android is truly amazing! With it I will end up ruling this world AND the universe! NO ONE will ever be able to stop me! HAHA!”<br />
<br />
After calming down the teen looks over at a shelve where he had put “Yuki the actionfigure”, grinning at it, “I think it is time to complete my female Lizard’s change,” he says to himself, turning back to his Laptop, Quentin types a short command into “Andy” and soon the “Android” is on its way to its master.<br />
<br />
Quentin leans back into his chair, “it’ll be an hour until “Andy” arrives,” he says, “enough time to think, I would need some dog supplies for my pup, but that I can deal with tomorrow when I pick him up,” he then decides to watch some TV to kill time.<br />
<br />
An hour later he hears a knock on the door, “that must be “Andy”,” he says to himself, getting to his feet and walking to the door.<br />
<br />
When he opens the door and sees the “Android” standing outside, Quentin can’t help but smile, “hello master,” the 10-year-old Hispanic boy says, “I have come as quickly as I could! I hope you are pleased with me for what I have done today for you”.<br />
<br />
“Welcome home, Andy,” Quentin says, “and yes, I am really pleased, but there is still some work to be done! Come inside and follow me to the living room!”<br />
<br />
“Andy” nods and follows Quentin inside, “now I understand why you have sent me to Quinn,” the “Android” says, unaware that this memory has been implanted by Quentin.<br />
<br />
Quentin smiles, “this world is so broken,” he says, “the humans are so miserable for not being what they were meant to be. But you and me, we’ll fix all the errors on this planet”.<br />
<br />
“Andy” smiles back, “I’ll be happy to help you in anyway I can, master,” he says, “after all, that is what I was made for. So, is there something you want me to do now?”<br />
<br />
Quentin nods, “we should finish fixing Yuki,” he says, “time to give him… I mean HER what she always wanted!”<br />
<br />
“Andy” smiles, “she’ll be the most happiest female Nile Monitor in the whole world,” he says.<br />
<br />
Quentin smirks inwardly, ‘hehe… and I’ll be a god,’ he thinks to himself, ‘hmm… I might have “Andy” make me immortal, and maybe make me younger… hehe two ten-year-olds ruling the world and universe would surely be wonderful!’<br />
<br />
The two enter the large living room and “Andy” spots the huge indoor glass terrarium which has exotic plants, sand and even a medium sized pool. “Rex and Yuki sure have a beautiful paradise,” the “Android” says.<br />
<br />
“They sure have,” Quentin replies, grabbing the shrunken boy from the shelve, “first, I want you to restore HER to her original size and have her clothes vanish. How long will she bet knocked out for after you restore her?”<br />
<br />
“About an hour… maybe two,” the “Android” says as Quentin lies the “figure” on the couch.<br />
<br />
“Good,” Quentin says, “I don’t want her to cause a scene”.<br />
<br />
“Andy” nods, “I shall complete the first commands,” he says and Quentin watches as Yuki starts to grow until the boy is back to his original size, then the boy’s clothes vanish, leaving him naked. “Andy” turns to Quentin, “what now, master?”<br />
<br />
“Now I want you to erase her memory of being a human boy, cause her to act and think like a female Lizard,” Quentin says, “the only physical changes I want you to make are: let her grow a strong and long Lizard-like tail, her genitals should be a female cloaca and cause her to have a functional reproductive system, otherwise I want you to leave her body like it is. Her skin should be rough and have the texture of scales, and I want her to only be able to walk on all fours! And finally I want you to make her go into heat and be fertile, also I want the transformation to take two weeks to complete!”<br />
<br />
“Andy” nods, “affirmative,” he says, then goes silent and after a few minutes he adds, “command completed!”<br />
<br />
“Great, help me carry her into the terrarium,” Quentin says, “Rex is dying to meet his mate!”<br />
<br />
“Andy” grabs Yuki’s legs and Quentin grabs the boy’s arms, they then carry the sleeping boy over to the terrarium.<br />
<br />
Quentin opens the door and they walk inside, lying Yuki near the pool on an area with soft sand, then both quickly exit the enclosure and Quentin locks the door, “I wonder what the first change will be!”<br />
<br />
“I thought to have her emit female pheromones first,” “Andy” says as the two stare into the enclosure, “having her emit those pheromones, Rex will not mistake her for a human. After all, we don’t want Rex to eat his female, right?”<br />
<br />
Quentin grins and nods, “right,” he says, “I hope he’ll like her!”<br />
<br />
“I’m sure he will,” the “Android” says, smiling, “after all, she IS the most beautiful Nile Monitor on this planet!”.<br />
<br />
Quentin smirks, “you have done great,” he then says, “there is one last thing I want you to do, before I send you back to Quinn,” the “Android” nods and leaves the apartment.<br />
<br />
“Whatever you need, master,” “Andy” says.<br />
<br />
“I want you to make me younger and immortal,” Quentin says.<br />
<br />
“May I ask why,” the “Android” asks.<br />
<br />
Quentin chuckles, “I see, giving you a free will caused you to start questioning some commands,” he says, “but I don’t mind. I like the way you are: more human than robot!”<br />
<br />
“I’m glad to hear that,” “Andy” says, “so, why do you want to be immortal and younger? And how much younger would you want to be?”<br />
<br />
“To answer your first question,” Quentin says, “I want to be immortal, because I want to rule this world and the universe for eternity! And as for the second change: I want to be a 10-year-old, because I prefer being a kid than a teenager!”<br />
<br />
“Andy” nods, “your explanations make sense,” he says, “please stand still, master”.<br />
<br />
Quentin does as told, “oh, and please make sure I have clothes that will fit my new body!”<br />
<br />
“Andy” nods, “I have already entered that into the changing process,” he says, “I also set an reality alteration, no one will question why a 10-year-old is living all by himself”.<br />
<br />
Quentin smiles, “good thinking,” he says, he then feels a tingle run through his body, “hu? That felt weird,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Did you feel a tingle run through your body,” the “Android” asks.<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Quentin says.<br />
<br />
“That is simply an indication that the change has begun,” “Andy” says.<br />
<br />
Quentin nods, grinning, “I already feel different,” he says.</p>
