<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Thankfully, there were no other incidents. I realized much to my puzzlement how nobody else had seemed at all phased by the giant animal woman in the theater. They couldn't all be natives, I thought to myself, but that was certainly possible. I'd have to ask Jess about it after.<br />
<br />
The young boys angered me for a moment more and then the previews began to play. My mind melted into amusement as some stupid coming soon cookie cutter rom-com assaulted the audience.<br />
<br />
I heard Jessica chuckle softly at a particularly cheesy piece of dialog in the trailer. &quot;These things are so lame.&quot; Another thing we had in common.<br />
<br />
This was followed by a macho shoot 'em up with a former WWF star turned &quot;actor&quot; and a CGI cartoon about a group of vigilante kung fu turtles.<br />
<br />
At last, our movie began to play. Jessica turned to me and smiled sweetly. &quot;I think you'll like this. It's one of my favorites.&quot;<br />
<br />
It film was unfamiliar, but it was about a girl named Penelope who had a pig nose as the result of some weird family curse. Predictably it was about the girl and society accepting her as she was, and in the end she finds somebody who loves her despite her bizarre appearance.<br />
<br />
By the end of the film I found myself snuggled into Jessica's side, with her arm wrapped around me. It was obvious why it was one of her favorite movies. It was her very own fairytale dream.<br />
<br />
As the credits rolled I found myself staring at the giraffe in wonder. Did I... was I actually feeling... I gulped and felt myself trembling.<br />
<br />
She looked down at me in alarm and blinked. &quot;You're shaking. Are you feeling well, Mark?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I'm fine. Just a little cold.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose it is drafty in this old theater.&quot; She rubbed my back. &quot;All right, we can go.&quot;<br />
<br />
We rose together and walked out with the crowd. This time, the people in the lobby did take startled glances at my escort, and more than one seemed ready to <br />
<br />
faint.<br />
<br />
We stepped out into the warm tropical night and were met with a few more glances and general shock. &quot;So, what did you think?&quot; Jessica asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was touching.&quot; I smiled. &quot;I suppose it goes without saying you identify with the girl, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
She laughed out loud, a pleasant sound, and nodded. &quot;Yes, of course. You can see why, I imagine. Singled out, ridiculed, but in the end she makes out okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
We stepped away from the theater and into the street, farther away from the &quot;red light&quot; district and closer to the resort. I conversed with Jessica the entire way, the both of us so rapt in each other's conversation we barely noticed the looks we were getting. By now, I was used to it.<br />
<br />
We walked through a small city block of delights and entertainment, and found ourselves stopping at a bar. We both took a stool.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have to try this!&quot; Jessica said enthusiastically. &quot;There's nothing else like it on the island. And all first timers get it eventually.&quot;<br />
<br />
I cracked my knuckles and leaned back. &quot;All right, I'm game.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jess whispered something to the bartender and he laughed before producing two glasses and pouring something orange from an unfamiliar label.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here we are. The infamous Pleasure Island Flamethrower. It's got a kick to it like a mule.&quot; She laughed at something distant I didn't grasp, and took her glass.<br />
<br />
&quot;You first.&quot; She giggled, pointing. I knew I was going to regret it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine.&quot; I picked up my glass, took a sip, and immediately went green. My mouth felt like it was on fire and I spat the liquid at the floor. The bartender burst out laughing and shook his head. &quot;That's vile!&quot; I coughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you it had a kick.&quot; She laughed, and winced as she took a sip of her own drink. &quot;The worst part is it burns all the way down. With the length of my throat that's a fair complaint.&quot; We both laughed and she set her glass down. &quot;There. Consider yourself initiated. Shall we carry on?&quot;<br />
<br />
We rose from the bar, now starting to loosen up, and shared a few laughs and jokes as we continued in each other's company. The night was still young, and there was so much to see.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm starting to feel a little peckish.&quot; I announced, rubbing my stomach. &quot;Do you feel like grabbing a bite?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, certainly!&quot; Jessica nodded. &quot;I know this little place a couple blocks down. Do you like Italian?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm starting to think we're kindred.&quot; I smiled, and again we exchanged that more meaningful gaze.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe.&quot; She smiled. &quot;You know, about the theater.&quot; The obvious blush returned beneath her cheeks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes?&quot; I leaned in, and again she put her arm around me.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't think I've felt that way for a long time. I like how you make me feel.&quot;<br />
<br />
I stopped, and we locked eyes in the middle of a cobblestone road, facing each other. &quot;How do I make you feel?&quot; I said gently.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like a lady.&quot; She returned softly, and smiled. &quot;You're the first one to actually treat me like a person instead of a sex toy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I find that hard to believe.&quot; I countered, imagining anyone abusing such a kind soul. &quot;You're not the typical-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's true.&quot; She placed a finger on my lips tenderly and traced it down my chest. My heart danced in my chest now as she continued. This was from her heart, I could feel it. &quot;This is the first time I've been myself with a client. My first evening out. A lot of firsts, really. The first time I've... cared.&quot; She gulped.<br />
<br />
&quot;You care about me?&quot; I felt myself shaking again.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've never met any man like you. Truth be told, I've seen the worst of men. The other girls... I see how they're treated.&quot; She was entranced now, and her knees were shaking. This was really happening! I couldn't deny my feelings any longer. I crept in closer and embraced her leg. Again, I felt so small... but... safe. &quot;You're special. You're like nothing I know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...&quot; I blushed myself now. This felt so right. My cheeks were burning and I felt my palms go sweaty. &quot;I think I'm falling for you, Jess.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jessica gasped and her grin broadened. She gulped nervously and seemed to stagger back, as if forgetting how to stand. She put her hands to her mouth and took a deep breath before standing straight and trembling. Like I had just hit her in the stomach. Her smile faded and I saw her eyes go teary.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I'm sorry. That was too forward. I mean... I'm sorry. I didn't mean to-&quot; I stopped and saw tears fall from her eyes, and felt my heart sink to my feet. &quot;I'll... I'll go.&quot;<br />
<br />
I turned around and sighed heavily. I had fucked it all up. Came on too strong. Scared the poor creature.<br />
<br />
The next thing I knew two hoof hands grabbed my shoulders and spun me around, and my eyes widened as a set of thick giraffe lips fell into my line of sight and locked with my mouth.<br />
<br />
I had been kissed by a few girls in my day, but the passion with which Jessica held her lips to mine was the single most exciting sensation I had ever felt. My hands rose to her neck, to her long mane of brunette hair, and I felt myself caressing and massaging her soft fur as I returned her affection with equal enthusiasm.<br />
<br />
At last we broke our embrace, both gasping for breath, and collected ourselves.<br />
<br />
&quot;What just happened?&quot; I gasped, the smell of her sweet perfume and the taste of her animal lips fresh in my senses.<br />
<br />
&quot;Those were happy tears, you silly man.&quot; She kneeled down and placed her arms around my waist. Her eyes said it all, years of pain and hopelessness melting away. &quot;Did you mean it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ye-&quot; Again, she cut me off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you really mean it?&quot; She asked, the tears returning. &quot;Be sure. Please.&quot;<br />
<br />
I looked at her, looked deep into her watery blue eyes. Like the ocean. So deep, so beautiful. The long dark lashes. The incredible personality and mind behind those eyes. Did I really care? Was I really falling in love with this beautiful giraffe woman?</p>
