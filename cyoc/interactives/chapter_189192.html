<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As it was a command, all 6 of them were now stuck there for who knows how long. The 12 heads of the cheerleaders swiveled around as they started having numerous conversations with each other at once. This of course bothered the nurse to no end.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright! That&#39;s more enough of that. Everyone back to having just one head again.&quot; Commanded the nurse as she watched 6 heads shrink away with 6 heads left behind. She sighed, thankful that now that she could hear herself think again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now then, grow a tail.&quot;<br />
<br />
All six girls clutched their lower backs as their skin started to protruded outwards. However each of them was expediencing different things. <br />
<br />
Jen felt as if her entire lower back was pushing out with it as her ass then followed along with her new growth. Her asshole and pussy pushed forwards until they both were on her front side fully, with her asshole below her pussy as her hips blended into her tail as well. She was forced forwards then and fell down onto all fours as her thigh and hip bones realigned to make more room for her new tail muscles and bones. Jen looked back over her shoulder at her tail and was shocked that it was nearly just as long as she was tall, and was very bulky. A few rows of spines then formed and the skin hardened into what resembled armored plates, thus completing the formation of her new alligator tail.<br />
<br />
Susan on the other hand, was watching as her tail was curling up over her head as a large spime protruded from the tip. Like Jen&#39;s, hers was also armored. Which made sense because Susan had just grown a scorpion&#39;s tail.<br />
<br />
Kimberly had to do a double take as her tail lump was just that, a lump above her ass. She was kind of insulted that that is all it was. That was until hundreds of feathers shot up out of it into a bright and colorful peacock tail which then fanned out behind her. The air head actually was really excited by this because it was so pretty.<br />
<br />
Anne watched as her tail, which was similar in shape to Susan&#39;s suddenly poofed out in bright red hairs with just a bit of white near the tip, giving her a large fox tail.<br />
<br />
Rachel was crying as she watched her tail lengthen to a point but stayed completely hairless, since it was the tail of a mouse.<br />
<br />
And finally Samantha watched as her legs merged together and became covered in shimering blue scales. Her feet then thinned, becomming almost transparent, and grew out into her tailfins in order to complete her mermaid&#39;s tail. Of course this also had meant that like Jen, Samantha had fallen forwards onto the ground as well.<br />
<br />
The nurse was surprised by this. All 6 of them grew a tail, but each grew their own unique kind. Maybe it was because she wasn&#39;t specific about it enough? And why these 6 tails? Did each girl influence her tail selection somehow? These and many other thoughts were racing in her head. There was so much to do here. So many things to try. And if wording was the key, then perhapse there were ways to effect each girl seperatly.<br />
<br />
It was only then did she notice that both Jen and Samantha had more than just growing their tail change about their body. Jen was now effectively quadropeddle, and Samantha had to be in water to go anywhere. Both of them had major bodily changes that had completely redefined how they had to live. <br />
<br />
Susan looked also terrified as her stinger loomed over her head. The nurse could only image the level of lethality contained within her stringer&#39;s toxin. <br />
<br />
Kimberly had grown the tail of the opposite gender. And while she was happily strutting around the room, wiggling her fully fanned out tail in front of the others, she didn&#39;t seem to comprehend that what she actually is doing would be considered an obvious mating dance if done by the male peacocks. Did this perhaps reflect a secret sexual desire for her squad mates? Probably not since it looked more like she was just showing off, but maybe.<br />
<br />
Opposite to that, Rachel grew one she definitely seemed to hate. While Anne was fully focused on combing her hands through her fox tail&#39;s long hairs as if she was grooming herself. <br />
<br />
Either way, the nurse concluded that she would need to run many more, interesting tests.</p>
