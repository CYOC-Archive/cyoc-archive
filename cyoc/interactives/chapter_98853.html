<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mark made his way across campus looking for his dorm. He was still in a daze after his dick was removed and then he was shaved and then he was made to rape himself. At least he was back in his own clothes again and beginning to feel normal, except for the absence in his underwear.<br />
<br />
He looked around at other students wondering about how they handled being dickless. It was hard to tell who was a student and who wasn&#39;t. It did seem that his fellow students seemed shyer and more passive. There were a few females on campus and Mark thought they must be girlfriends except that Mark couldn&#39;t tell which man went with which girl because the girls ordered all of the men around and none of the men acted like the man in the relationship. There were some men who acted like men and seemed completely confident but they didn&#39;t seem interested in the women. Mark wondered if they were also students and how they were able to be so confident. He figured they must be upperclassmen and had become more confident with time and that Mark too would get his confidence back in time. He decided to cut himself some slack since he had only just been raped by his own dick.<br />
<br />
When he found his dorm, the R.A. insisted on a strip search before letting Mark into the dorm. It wasn&#39;t good enough for Mark to just drop his pants. The R.A. wanted a picture of Mark completely naked to put in the records.<br />
<br />
&quot;While you are in the dorm, you must stay naked. We may make exceptions on some occasions but we don&#39;t want you sneaking anything under your clothes.&quot; The R.A. then escorted Mark to his room. &quot;Your roommates name is Keyshawn but everyone just calls him Key.&quot;<br />
<br />
The R.A. opened the door and on one of the beds there was a young smooth redhead who looked like he was suffering from a nervous tic.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is he okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Key said, &quot;I&#39;m good. It&#39;s just cleaning time. They&#39;re cleaning my balls right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
The R.A. said, &quot;Well have fun and good luck&quot; before shoving Mark in the door and shutting him in. Mark tried to open the door but it was locked from the outside.<br />
<br />
&quot;What gives?&quot;<br />
<br />
Key stood up. &quot;Don&#39;t worry about it. He&#39;ll let us out soon.&quot; Key wrapped his arms around Mark. &quot;They&#39;re washing my dick now and should soon be hosing out my ass. Yep there they go now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark tried to get away from this molestation but there wasn&#39;t anywhere he could go to and Key was relentless. Then they started cleaning Mark&#39;s cock too. It wasn&#39;t long before Mark molested Key back.<br />
<br />
The experience was not completely pleasant. The water was warm but not as warm as Mark would have liked. Also the brushes and metal hoses he could feel against his privates were unpleasant. But one thing that was pleasant was having someone to hold. He&#39;d never had someone to hold before because of his strict religious upbringing.<br />
<br />
After shooting his load again, Mark and Key lay in each other&#39;s arms basking. Key said, &quot;It&#39;s nice to finally have someone to hold during cleaning. I had to endure cleanings by myself all last week.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark lay there wondering if he had just had gay sex. He hadn&#39;t stuck his dick inside anyone and no dick was stuck inside him. But he had passionately entwined and been entwined by another man although it was easy to forget that Key was a man since he had nothing between his legs. Mark hadn&#39;t had sex before but imagined it would be very similar to what he and Key just shared. Then Mark realized there was only one bed in the room and that he was expected to share it with Key.<br />
<br />
The next morning, Mark had two missions. He wanted to find out more about the vault where they kept the genitals and he needed a part time job. Visiting the vault answered both.<br />
<br />
&quot;You need a part time job and we need another cock cleaner and we need you to start today.&quot;<br />
<br />
After filling out the paperwork to become a part time cock cleaner, his boss game him a tour of the vault. The vault was about the size of a closet.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re kidding me. How many cocks can you fit in that tiny space?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;d be surprised. There are about 1500 cocks in there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you shrunk them or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, they&#39;re normal size cocks. When you put them in small boxes and stack them side by side, they don&#39;t take up nearly as much room as you might think.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So I have to pull each one out one at a time and wash it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No that would take too much time. We have a different way.&quot;<br />
<br />
The boss led Mark to a room where a seven foot tall blue disc was attached to the wall. &quot;You step into that disc and it teleports you to a disc inside the vault where you&#39;ll only be four inches tall.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark gulped. He wasn&#39;t sure he wanted the job anymore.<br />
<br />
&quot;May I have some coveralls?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s best if you go in naked. It gets pretty messy in there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I bet, with all those assholes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The assholes are kept in a different vault.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark took a moment to steel himself for this, then he stripped and stepped through the blue disc. He found himself in a room surrounded by dicks that were bigger than he was. There were hundreds of cocks on this floor of the vault, all hanging down from the ceiling.</p>
