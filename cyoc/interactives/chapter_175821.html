<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chris danced in the middle of a ball room, his human body fit and in far better shape then it ever had been but none of that mattered right now. Instead all that mattered was the beautiful dark raven hair women dancing with him in a very revealing dress. It was the love of his life Barbara and she was beautiful in every single way possible. <br />
<br />
Yet something was wrong, he couldn’t place his finger on it as they danced, finally it fell into place, Barbara was a human. That wasn’t right the monster virus transformed her into a kitsune, then before his eyes a pair of black fox ears and a long fox tail appeared and he smiled even more. Yes, that was right, she was a kitsune, her dress was a black number which shimmered in the candle light as they danced. <br />
Yet something was wrong, not with Barbara, she was perfect…perfect in every way possible. Then she remembers he was not Chris anymore, no she was Christina. And as if a light switch was flipped, she was no longer Chris but Christina, a woman, a neko furry who loved Barbara. Like that the male dream body was replaced with her real body, a tall blonde hair neko with golden cat ears and a tail but the rest of her remaining human. She was disowned by her family, but she loved her friends and most of all Barbara. She was also no longer in a black suit but a white flowing dress with lace and other items. It was a beautiful wedding dress. <br />
<br />
Yes, this was their dream wedding as they danced with their friends. All their friends, all of whom where monsters aside from her sister who was the only family member of hers who had kept in touch and showed any care for her. Her father and brother where religious nut jobs, her mother was a coward who obeyed whatever her husband told her to do. Her sister-in-law, her brother&#39;s wife was if anything more religious then her husband and their children where being raised the same way and she hadn&#39;t heard a word form them since she transformed over a year ago. <br />
<br />
She opened her eyes as the dream drifted away as she opened her eyes and looked up the ceiling of her bedroom. Well to think a year ago, she was a human man answering calls in a call center explaining to people the government’s buy back policy for those who came down with the Monster flu. Now she was dating hopefully soon to be engaged to a wonderful woman and had a great job designing modifying buildings for the ever growing monster population. <br />
<br />
She turned her head a bit to see Barbara still asleep on her chest, she was wearing a black tank top and a pair of shorts while Barbara was in a night gown. She turned her eyes over to see the time, it was nearing 9 in the morning. Both of them had worked super late the day before and both had today off. They had plans but not until after lunch, an idea formed in her head as she moved a bit as if she was getting up to use the bathroom. Barbara rolled over freeing Christina as she made her move. Instead of getting up, she instead moved over and began to plan kisses on her girlfriend’s neck. <br />
<br />
Slowly Barbara opened up her stilted eyes and let out a moan of pleasure as she moved her head over to give her girlfriend more room to work with. Then she titled her head as so she could pull her blonde kitty cat into a kiss. Within moments Barbara was on top of her and it was her turn to have kisses up and down her neck.<br />
<br />
“Well someone is frisky this morning, maybe you are in heat?” joked Barbara, that was a common joke among furry’s and other type of monsters because it was true. Some of them did go into heat, Barbara and Christina both did, it was something both knew about and knew around what time it would happen and the sex during that time was amazing but this wasn’t mindless animal lust heat sex, this was passionate sex. <br />
<br />
“No, just wanted to wake you up in a special way.” Said Christina as she kissed her girlfriend’s nipples through the night gown. Earning a moan.<br />
<br />
“Well, Christina you have me awake now…lets play.” Said Barbara<br />
<br />
It was just before noon when a tired but happy Christina moved into the kitchen and sat down, all she had on was a sports bra and a pair of shorts. She knew that she and Barbara where going to miss their planned lunch but who cares, she had a wonderful breakfast. She thought as she whipped away a little bit of Barbara’s juices from her mouth. <br />
<br />
“I’ll start some coffee.” Said Barbara as she entered the kitchen in only a pair of panties and Christina’s top which was loss on her, Christina was tall for a women and had a much larger chest then Barbara but Barbara was far more flexible then she was. <br />
<br />
“Thanks.” said Christina with a smile as both their tales moved back and fourthly happily. She turned on the TV and to the news.<br />
<br />
“If you are just joining us the Monster Flu has spread to the point where 25% of population of the world is now monsters, that is almost 2 billion monster.” Said the news women herself a monster, an elf judging by the form. “While most of the growth in the monster population is in the 3rd world where attempts to stop the spread of the virus has gone unchecked. Even so the monster virus is still going up in the United States as the monster population crossed the 65 million mark, that is 20% of the population. The US government is considering lifting all restraints on the monster populous expect those monsters who are considered dangerous, other nations have already done this in Europe, Australia, South Korea and Japan. It is estimated that within 2 years the monster population will be at or near 50% of the world’s total population.”<br />
<br />
Both women knew what that meant, ever since the Monster flu started getting out of control the government had forced those who came down with the virus and transformed to move into reservations where they where contained and not allowed to leave. To the government’s credit they had made them extremely normal and for all purpose it was a normal city only with a population of only monsters. Still they where stuck behind walls unable to leave, over time those walls had pushed out as more and more areas was required to house the monster population. Some monsters like Dragons did rightfully require special communities, you didn’t want a fire breathing dragon to go anywhere unchecked. But for most monsters such as the two of them, they could move into a normal human house with almost no modifications. <br />
<br />
“Calls have grown from both sides, some wish to end the lock downs as a whole while others want to tighten them.” Said the reporter “We are joined now by Minister…”<br />
<br />
Christina almost spit out her coffee as she saw her brother appeared on the screen. She then felt like clawing out his eyes as he talked about not only keeping them in cages but even removing their rights to vote, he didn’t go as far as some in the extreme and call for them to be massed murdered but he seamed to dance around the idea.<br />
<br />
“Minster, isn’t it true your own sister came down with the flu?” inquired the reporter<br />
<br />
“No, my sister is totally human.” Countered her brother<br />
<br />
“No…maybe you didn’t under your brother who was transformed into a female Neko, public records show that she is….” started the reporter only to have her brother interrupt her.<br />
<br />
“My Brother is dead to our family; he died the moment he came down with the flu. Maybe it was God’s punishment on him or the Devil attacking our holy family but now we need to worry about protecting out children.” Said her brother “I have two children and my wife and I don’t want to raise them in a world with monsters.”<br />
<br />
Christina’s ears where down as the segment ended, apparently it was been recorded earlier during one of the early morning shows but still it hurt.<br />
<br />
“Are you alright?” inquired Barbara as she hugged her girlfriend from behind as she sat on at the table looking at the TV.<br />
<br />
“I have been better.” Said Christina as suddenly the her cell phone rang.</p>
