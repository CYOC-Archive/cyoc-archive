<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">He was human. He know what he had to do. He held his hand back and slammed it down on the button while screaming &quot;I am merciful&quot;. Suddenly the ring glowed as the locks began to clock anticlockwise. The gears unwound and the screws unscrewed themselves. The ring fell of and injected the demon with a substance for the pain. <br />
<br />
The man looked at the demon. He could see his face it had gigantic black horns coming out of it the size of spears. It was not just a demon anymore it was the devil itself. The demons eyes suddenly changed to pure crimson. The demon smiled at me &quot;Thank you&quot; he said. But then something weird happened. The demon&#39;s face turned from a smile to a face of agony. His face was ruptured in strain marks. <br />
<br />
&quot;UH WHAT HAVE YOU DONE&quot; The demon screamed &quot;WHAT HAVE YOU DONE!!&quot;. The Demon suddenly doubled in size, tripled, quadrupled. &quot;OH..I UNDERSTAND NOW&quot; The demon said in a loud booming voice. &quot;OF COURSE YES...YES&quot;. It was like he was talking to someone. Something in his mind which was telling him something. Whatever it was it did a good job he moved his hand towards the man and grapped him with his massive hands. The man thought he was going to be killed and for good reason. The demon had no mercy no compassion now that it was free it could kill him and wouldn&#39;t feel any sadness. <br />
<br />
But that the demons hands grew in size and turned anti-clockwise by 180 degrees. It made a loud popping noise and his hand retracted onto the wall. &quot;YOU WILL BECOME A PART OF ME&quot; he said demonically. he couldn&#39;t take it anymore he had to escape. There was no other choice. <br />
<br />
He ran towards the entrance and was at the door when his massive hand grapped me. &quot;No&quot; He screamed. The man thought he was about to die. About to enter hell and be tortured forever. He had done too many bad things he didn&#39;t deserve heaven. But what would god think of him. He was a murderer he had done to many bad things. He only deserved bad things to happen to him. But then a thought came across him. He didn&#39;t care. Strange but true. He didn&#39;t care. He understood why he had to do those things. and he embraces death.<br />
<br />
The gigantic hand was like a crimson blood cage. It was still growing every second. With a deafening scream in the background every second. His hand contracted in on itself and the man could only see darkness. &quot;FEEL THE POWER&quot; the demon said. But then the man felt like he was floating in the air he couldn&#39;t feel the hot palms anymore but air. A warm air all around him. He felt happy.<br />
<br />
But then it happened. Energy filled his body like a plague. It was filling with this embarrassing feeling of satisfaction. &quot;oooh yes&quot; he screamed in a loud voice. He didn&#39;t hold anything back &quot;oh yes&quot; he allowed it to carry him across the rapids of the energy. It was going to make him a masterpiece. He expanded in size, bigger and bigger. He was growing into what he wanted. What he needed. Divine power which he could destroy the demons with. He could feel his arm muscles grow in a magnificent way. They felt like two bowling bowls that he could carry with ease. His lefts felt like sandbags which were padded around them. His voice got deeper as well. He felt his neck itch in a magnificent way he couldn&#39;t help but laugh. It a demonic booming laugh. It was still dark though and he couldn&#39;t see what had happened to him. <br />
<br />
He opened his eyes and could see the room was gone he was standing in a room with a white light and a marble background. It was cold to stand on and then he realised he was completely naked. There were no mirrors in the room. But instead he reached down and touched his cock. It was massive and felt like a groping pipe. It had massive wires coming out of it which pumps ounces of blood to his cock. Meanwhile his arms felt amazing like something had grown a watermelon in them. He flexed them and felt a surge of warm energy. He kept flexing. It felt amazing. <br />
<br />
In the moment he had forgotten his plan. But then realised he had new features. He felt his head and felt two claws growing out of them. Massive horns. He also had swords growing out of fingers. He had no nails but daggers. He also felt more intelligent he felt a big relief had gone from his brain. His pecs were massive as well they bulged out in front of him and felt like he was wearing body armour. <br />
<br />
Why did this happen he thought and why did it stop. Why was he here he thought. He looked around and then realised he felt weaker in his left arm. He looked at his left arm and saw an andrillium ring there around it. it was the size of a tyre and glowed gold. He had grown bigger than he thought. But then someone must of contained it with this ring. But you can&#39;t contain a feral beast after it turns into a feral beast. So why was he like this. <br />
<br />
All of these answers could be answered by opening the door he looked at it and made a decision.</p>
