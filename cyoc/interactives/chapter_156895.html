<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Eli was performing drills with his team. Though he told himself it was to show the players how to execute them properly, the reason he was doing them was because he wanted to be playing himself. With the addition of Devin as the team’s kicker, Eli wanted more and more to be out on the field with the rest participating in a game.<br />
	<br />
When Devin had joined the team, Eli was impressed with how well he played, but since Pete had moved to wide receiver, the team had needed a new kicker. And he had made every field goal kick for the game he was a starter.<br />
	<br />
Another thing that Eli was enjoying was the fact that he had actually grown three inches. He had no idea how that was even possible for someone in their forty’s (as far as he knew, because he was really 25), but when he had gone to get dressed a week earlier and found that his pants were to short, he was left finally concerned about the changes he and the team were going through.<br />
	<br />
First and foremost, there was Gary, with his massive size and weight. Next were Tyler and Pete, two guys who went from being the smallest players to first stringers. After those two came John and Luther, who while not the shear size of Gary, were not to be forgotten. The next player was Kevin, who was now about the size of a college senior. And recently Hank and George had both caught up with John and Luther. Finally, Devin and Neil had changed. While he was thrilled to have Devin on the team, Eli wished that he had not been forced to cut Neil. But with Neil’s new huge gut, he could no longer keep up with the rest of the players. Sure he was a jerk, but Eli just didn’t like the fact that he had to cut a player.<br />
	<br />
Almost a dozen boys had gone through dramatic changes within the last few months, and while some change could be attributed to still being teenage boys, the amount of growth was just too much. Fortunately, it could not be ascribed too steroids; Eli had made sure to test the entire team after Devin joined.<br />
	<br />
These musings, however, slipped away because the Saturday night after Devins first game, Eli was able to organize another threesome with a new boy and a new girl.<br />
<br />
Gary was happy that the defensive line was now all massive. With Hank now almost as big as John and Luther, all four, especially Gary, were well over three hundred pounds. However, Gary decided to give Hank an additional twenty pounds and two inches of height. This would leave Hank at 6’4 and 353 pounds, Luther at 6’5 and 363 pounds and John at 6’8 and 357 pounds.<br />
Each one was between 85 to 100 pounds smaller than Gary, and Gary was still four inches taller than John. Only Tim had yet to be transformed.<br />
	<br />
Since the defensive line was almost finished, Gary decided to work more on the offensive line while changing Tim, the defensive end other than Hank. He had already changed George, so Gary chose Nick and Max, the offensive guards, to be transformed with Tim.<br />
	<br />
Tim had started at 6 feet and 4 inches and 317 pounds. Therefore, Gary gave Tim three pounds a day for two weeks and had Tim also grow two inches. Nick started at 6 feet three inches and 303 pounds. Editing Nick’s profile, Gary set is so that Nick would be an inch taller and with three pounds added a day for two weeks. Finally, Max started at 6 feet tall and weighed 302 pounds, so Gary caused him to grow to 6 feet 4 inches and gain two pounds of muscle daily for two weeks.<br />
	<br />
Gary knew that he was avoiding his problems. Being able to improve his teammates allowed his to not think about the fact that he had knocked up Lucy. Lucy had been on birth control, so Gary was really surprised when she told him after he had told her about his possible coming job. Being a professional football player, Gary knew he could support his coming family, but he also wanted to go and experience college; he just did not think he was prepared to be a father.<br />
	<br />
Finally, Gary turned once more to Coach Eli’s profile. Gary could not know that Eli was starting to suspect that something was causing the massive growth of the players. So seeing Eli’s profile, Gary could not resist decreasing Eli’s age by another year and give him two more inches and 1 pound a day. This would leave Eli at 6 feet 3 inches, 320 pounds and 24 years old.<br />
<br />
It was the day after initiating his last round of changes that Gary got a chance to talk with Coach Eli. Ever since learning that he would be a father soon, Gary had needed to talk with someone about whether he should go professional or continue his education.<br />
	<br />
“I just don’t know what to do Coach. Sure I love Lucy, and while I was hesitant at first by the thought of being a father, I’m now really looking forward to meeting my kid. I just don’t know if I should take the job or continue school…”<br />
	<br />
Listening to Gary, Eli was conflicted. Eli was thrilled that a student that he had coached had a chance to join a professional team, but he also knew that college would make sure that Gary would have multiple options in his future after football. Letting Gary finish his dialogue, Eli started, “I’m not sure what is the best thing for you Gary. I would love a chance to be back in college playing football again. But then I never had any kids. You guys on the football team throughout the years have kind of been the sons that I never had. But I will say this, if you decided to go to college instead of immediately going professional, you will have a lot more opportunities, and you will not have to worry as much if you happen to get hurt. Plus there are things that you will miss out on if you don’t attend a university. Even with a wife and child, there will be stuff you would like doing on campus.”<br />
	<br />
Looking up at his coach from where he sat, Gary knew he would never have to worry about getting hurt. With the Chronivac, Gary would be able to correct any problems, but Coach Eli was also correct in that there would be stuff he would want to do at college even if he had a wife and kid.<br />
	<br />
Conflicted, Gary asked, “What about you coach? Would you ever consider going back to school?”</p>
