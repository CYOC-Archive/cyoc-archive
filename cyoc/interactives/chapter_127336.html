<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A week passed as both Braiden and his girlfriend had gotten used to being ponies that In someways, they actually prefers being ponies. their only purpose was to please and keep the master happy as they doesn&#39;t even need to get a job or anything. they had Very little stress and anxiety that even the master keeps them well health.<br />
<br />
even though they each had their own stall that at lest they a bail of hay to lay in as his girlfriend was in, sleeping. it wasn&#39;t long after when Sebastian comes in. he was carrying a set of rubber gloves, a metal bucket filled with soup and water, two new sets of pony gears exactly the ones they are wearing, even a sponge that Braiden figured it was time for a bath as he went to her stall first and cleaned her up first.<br />
<br />
&quot;alright, giddy up. wake up now. it&#39;s time to get you out of that suit off. It&#39;s starting to get dirty that it&#39;s also smells.&quot; he says as he taps her with his boots that she soon wakes up. slowly waking up while getting up as he started to undresses her that she was then bathed. although she was agents it at first in the beginning that she soon realized what fun it would be to be bathed by someone and soon let him. first he removed the mask and scrubbed her head and was soon removing her pony outfit that when she was fully scrubbed and rinsed off is when he started to put on her new pony outfit. as her head was the last peace to be on her that before he did, he placed a ball gag on her as he then put on her mask, making it harder for her to speak as this was starting to turn Braiden on. when she was struggling to get her mask off so she could get the gag off of her with her mitten hooves that she didn&#39;t noticed him leaving the stall as Braiden could only hear her muffle now while thinking he didn&#39;t like hearing her talk. (this is what she looks like after her change of her pony outfit when he gave her a sponge bath.)<br />
<br />
<br />
soon it was Braiden&#39;s turn that he trots over to him when Sebastian smiled at the sight of what he was doing. &quot;Good boy.&quot; he said while taking off the mask as it was the first time he saw their faces. gently patting his head as he slowly removed the mitten hooves that Braiden&#39;s face and hands were now free as he then takes the suit fully off of him, until finally Braiden was completely naked.<br />
<br />
&quot;oh man, what a mess! well, guess it&#39;s time to get rid some of that body hair of yours. Sebastian said as he grabs the pony suit and puts it on his straw bed, with his girlfriend&#39;s hood she was once wearing as he also put the suit that wasn&#39;t Callum in the bin, so it could be cleaned.<br />
<br />
&quot;May I speak for a moment here Sebastian?&quot; Braiden interrupts him, before starting Braiden&#39;s spunge bath.<br />
<br />
&quot;well i guess we could while i bath you for a bit. what do you want to talk about?&quot; Sebastian replies that what came next surprised him a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Callum. return back to your human form. you can turn back now.&quot; Braiden said that the dust soon forms around the pony suit Callum once was and was then laying on the straw naked when the dust cleared.<br />
<br />
&quot;wha what&#39;s going on here? where did you come from? And Who are you?&quot; Sebastian said as he was shocked to see the pony suit they were both wearing turn into a naked boy all of a sudden in front of his eyes. Callum told Sebastian everything from the beginning as he was a suit for Braiden and a hood piece for his girlfriend as she was about to hand him the hood, after wearing it herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, you were a pony suit while being worn by both of them the whole time?&quot; Sebastian asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. Whatever Braiden tells me to be that soon turn into what he wants, even what you were seeing before.&quot; Callum answered that before Braiden had time to tell him what to be next, Sebastian quickly told him to listen to him now and help wash Braiden up. with in seconds, Callum was following his orders and was soon washing Braiden&#39;s body with a wet, soapy sponge. Sebastian was soon smiling that when it was time to dress him up in his new pony outfit, Sebastian gagged him the same way he did to his girlfriend.<br />
<br />
when it was over as Braiden couldn&#39;t speak anymore while struggling the same way his girlfriend did a few moments ago that Sebastian soon turned to Callum and told him to be a tiger mascot. sure enough that after a few seconds, there is a tiger mascot where Callum once stood in the stable halls. as he looked like the tiger mascot from the tv show saved by the bell that Braiden knew what episode he looked like as it was the first season of the 16th episode, save that tiger.<br />
<br />
<br />
gently, he walks over him and examines his suit form that as he did is where he thought he was nice, for a mascot uniform. Sebastian smiles and laughs a bit before folding him back up. backing up a bit that he told Callum to turn back as he shortly turns back to his human form, but still naked.<br />
<br />
&quot;this is so weird, and so cool. sweet! ok, that was only a test run. for the real thing, I want you to....<br />
<br />
(this is where you decide what Sebastian tells Callum what to become next, or even tell him what to do. feel free to add your own ideas to the story as there are a few listed down below. thank you and happy reading)</p>
