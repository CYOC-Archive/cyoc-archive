<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Emily slowly walked down the corridor not really sure where to go and not wanting to get caught. Her friends dared her to sneak back stage at the circus and steal a clown nose. It was a stupid college prank and she regretted getting goaded into it. She finally spotted a sign that said &quot;Clown Alley&quot; and a arrow pointed off to the right. She went that direction being even more careful. Her friends knew she was afraid of clowns and came up with this prank hoping she would run into a bunch and run out screaming. She would show them she wasn&#39;t scared. She finally reached a colorful curtain and listen to see if anybody was behind it. Not hearing anyone she slowly parted it to have a look. It was a explosion of color. There were colorful costumes everywhere, bright vanities lined up and trunks stacked up in corners. She slipped in and started to look around. She checked the vanities and instead of finding the colorful makeup she expected she found normal skin tones of foundation, muted colors of lipstick and no clown noses. It looked like a vanity of a supermodel not of a clown with colorful grease paint. She did find nose reduction cream weirdly enough but figured it must have been a prank that someone relabeled eye puffiness reduction cream. There were racks of colorful clothing and normal clothes, she searched some of the pockets but couldn&#39;t find anything. Turning to the trunks she opened them and found normal looking shoes and to her surprise normal wigs. She expected to find purple, green or some other bright color but these were blond, brown or black wigs styled for a average person. She looked around, besides the clown costumes she really hadn&#39;t found anything clownish and wondered if she was in the right area. Maybe they shared this area with another circus act. There was a door to the side and she decided to try that and then maybe back track and see if she could find something else. She had grown lax after not running into anybody and did not listen at the door. If she had listened she would have heard a quiet moaning coming from the other side. She threw open the door and walked through and right into a clown that was sitting down. She saw the clown and froze terror running up her spine as she tried to suppress a scream. The clown jumped back in the chair one hand holding a clown calendar with clowns posing scantily clad on it and the other had on his very erect and leaking penis. Emily&#39;s eyes fall down to the clown’s crotch and sees what he was doing and the horror of walking in on it doubles her already existing terror. The clown with his pants down around his ankles gripped his dick tight, he was on the edge of his orgasm when she walked in and couldn’t stop it now. His cock erupted shooting his cum into the air in a tall arch and right on to Emily&#39;s face. The cum splattered her face and began to run down in a thick glob that was soon added to with more cum shot from the clown&#39;s dick. Emily&#39;s mouth was open in surprise and terror got a direct hit as the second cum glob landed right in it. She closed her mouth and tried to raise her hands to defend herself scared out of her mind at what is happening. The clown arched his back and groaned, he sat there shaking in post orgasmic bliss as he shot off on to the poor girl that interrupted him. Cum splatters Emily&#39;s arms and hands as the command to turn and run finally makes it to her muscles. She turns and runs out of the room, the clown recovered from his orgasm calls for her to stop and gets up and tries to run after her but is tripped by his pants around his ankles. Emily swallows hard and tries to catch her breath as she runs down the corridor and the sweet/salty taste in her mouth tells her she just swallowed the clowns cum. She stumbles as she gags but recovers and runs outside. She runs around the corner and pauses bent over with her hands on her knees breathing hard. She looks down at her arms and sees the cum splattered on it and feels the stuff on her face. She takes a deep breath and exhales through her nose smelling the cum on her breath as she tries to wipe the drying white cum off her arms. She wipes her face with her hands feeling some of the wet cum on her fingers but still feeling dry patches of it on her face. She decides she needed to find a bathroom to wash it off before she could even face her friends. Her friends would think she wussed out and got scared but it would be better than showing up with cum all over her. They would think she gave a guy a blowjob or something and think she was a slut. The horror of that thought overrode the thought of being a scaredy cat. She laughed at the thought and found herself unable to stop.<br />
<br />
The clown finally was able to stand up and pulled his pants up. Poor girl, he tried to stop her and warn her. &#39;Oh, well she would figure it out on her own.&#39; He looked around and down at the calendar. &#39;It would be good to get some new faces around here.&#39; He laughed and decided to get ready for the show.</p>
