<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>I used only the beginning lines in the start of the original option as a starting point for this story vein. I mean to commit no copyright violation against the original anonymous author. I do believe as it is also part of the same next chapter for Jeff just a different outcome makes the original author&#39;s beginning extra meaningful to my take of it.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff looked over the options, and then found one he liked. “Cheerleader, 16 Years Old, Popular.&quot; read Jeff. &quot;Well if I&#39;m gonna go girl, I might as well be on top of the High School Girl Food Chain.&quot; said Jeff as he clicked on the option. As he did, His body began to change while he then approached a full length mirror. His hair lengthened past his shoulders as it then turned from black to dirty blonde. His face then morphed into the face of pretty young woman with his green eyes turning blue along with red lipstick appearing. &quot;Well hello gorgeous.&quot; said Jeff as he was shocked over his now feminine voice. As he placed his hands over his mouth he notices his hands becoming longer, and slimmer with his fingernails now garnished with red polish. His arms become slimmer as well with his body changing to accommodate a female cheerleader. &quot;I know what&#39;s next.&quot; said Jeff as he saw two round orbs form on his chest, and get slightly bigger. &quot;Nice, I&#39;m a C Cup.&quot; said Jeff as he cradled his new &quot;Girls&quot;.<br />
<br />
His legs began thin, and lengthen alone with his feet as his toes also gained the same red polish. His hips then flare out. &quot;One final part, I&#39;ll miss you little dude.&quot; said Jeff as he knew his manhood would be replaced with a womanhood. Jeff&#39;s manhood receded into his body, and morphing into a womanhood. A few seconds later, Jeff&#39;s inner workings converted to that of a young woman making Jeff a full fledged woman. &quot;Congratulations, It&#39;s a girl.&quot; said Jeff as she now placed her hands on her hips proudly in front of her rooms backdoor full-length mirror.<br />
<br />
Suddenly the girl staring into the mirror felt funny she developed a slight headache as she cradled her forehead with her left hand and leaned into it as her legs got weak and wobbly. Unable to see the machine screen in which she had facilitated her change she would have been alarmed at the glitches and software error warnings which had developed as the process entered the mental change loading screen. Within seconds the headache had passed and removing her hand from her forehead became a relief for the poor girl as she again stared at her reflection in the mirror. Something didn’t feel quite right about the reflection staring back at her. The girl knew of course that this was her reflection in the mirror, her name was Trisha Milanski and she was a rising member of the Corby High School cheer squad, and miss popular. The reflection seemed correct and felt somewhat normal to Trisha but she also had clear and descriptive memories of being Jeff Miller. Trisha knew that this type of thinking was nonsense as Jeff Miller was not only the quarterback of the Corby High Bats football team something she didn’t have the body for and he was also her hunk of a boyfriend. Calling him her “hunk of a boyfriend” didn’t seem right and she visibly frowned as she also developed a bad taste in her mouth to the thought but at the same time she knew by her jumbled memories that this was in fact correct. <br />
<br />
Looking across her pink wallpapered room adored with posters of boy bands and female singers Trisha saw a strange large monitored device sitting on her makeup table which she didn’t ever notice before. Walking up to the table sent alarm bells ringing throughout Trisha&#39;s body as walking with swinging hips and unruly breasts sent shivers through her body as to again something not seeming right with who she was. Inspecting the inert device Trisha was just about to try and turn it on when another alarming thought entered her mind “Wait I have cheer practice in under an hour!” Looking alarmed at forgetting such an important thing in her life until the last possible moment another thought entered her mind. Looking down at her outfit Trisha was relieved to see something she thought was normal about the experience. Trisha was wearing exactly what she believed was the correct outfit for a person like her to wear: White tennis shoes with white socks loose, baggy, denim jeans, and a light blue t-shirt. Exactly what a boy my age should be wearing” Trisha thought triumphantly but soon looked perplexed and alarmed when she caught the tell-tale sign of a bra underneath that blue t-shirt. The fear having not left her face Trisha walked over to the closet and with a look of trepidation opened the rolling doors to find her red and black cheer leading uniform hanging front and center. “Do I really have to wear that thing?” Trisha pleaded her mind but she already knew the answer as her distinct memories of fun times at cheer leading practice and at football games told her all she needed to know in regards to the expectations of the players and fans in seeing the skirted cheer squads lining the field sidelines.<br />
<br />
With shaking hands Trisha took the hanging one-piece uniform off the rack and laid it on the bed. “This is so weird” Trisha thought “I have memories of always being a girl but I have even stronger and more familiar memories of being a guy. Obviously I’m not one but I remember so well how I had such a crush on several of the cheerleaders as they did their routine and I watch in awe from the bleachers as Jeff.” Almost reflecting her realization in real time as to what she was discovering about herself Trisha’s facial expressions took on a fearful look “now I am the beautiful target of that love and affection from the stands!” Trisha knew what had to come next as her female memories became more pressing as the clock on her burrow wined down to the next hour. Keeping her eyes closed throughout the ordeal in order to avoid certain...reactions Trisha stripped off her clothes and easily as if she had done it her entire life put on the cheer leading uniform, her long white stockings, and small pink sneakers. Looking again in the mirror Trisha was amazed at how well she looked the part but that amazement was soon replaced by overwhelming sadness as she realized that his wasn’t really her even though it was and she just didn’t feel like herself in a cheer leading skirt. “I’m kinda liking this open and free feeling of a skirt or dress rather then the cramped confines of a pair of pants or shorts but still this doesn’t feel like something I would regularly be wearing even though I actually do all the time.”<br />
<br />
Sitting down at the makeup table Trisha expertly applied her makeup startling even herself at the ease in which she dolled herself up. Frowning at the mirror at her look one last time Trisha grabbed her pom-poms in the closet. Striking a cheer pose in front of the mirror with a frown on her face Trisha wanted so much to be wearing pants, a shirt, and to take off that damned bra and she didn’t want to go to practice either but she also knew that she couldn’t let her friends down. Pulling herself together Trisha Milanski left her room and made her way outside to the garage to retrieve her bicycle.</p>
